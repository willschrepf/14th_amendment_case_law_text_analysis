Because    summary    judgment    was\n\nimproperly granted, we vacate the remedial order, reverse the\n\nliability judgment, and remand.\n\n                                 I.    BACKGROUND\n\n     In    the    civil   rights      era       Louisiana   repealed    its    school\n\nsegregation      laws.     The   United         States   sued   Louisiana     in   1974\n\nalleging    that    the    State      was       still    maintaining    a   racially\n\n                                            1\n\fdiscriminatory system of higher education violating the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment1 and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2000d.2\n\n     In     1981    the   court    entered   a   consent   decree   under     which\n\nLouisiana     was    to    begin    affirmative     action   and    enhance    its\n\npredominately black public institutions of higher education.                    In\n\nDecember 1987 the United States moved for a hearing to determine\n\nLouisiana's compliance with this consent decree and to determine\n\nwhether the State and the governing boards of its colleges and\n\nuniversities were operating its system of public higher education\n\non a unitary basis.\n\n     The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment on the\n\nissue of liability, i.e., the question whether the State maintained\n\nan unlawfully segregated system of higher education.                The district\n\ncourt ruled for the United States, holding that the State had under\n\n\n1\n   The United States has since waived its constitutional claim.\nUpon a challenge to the United States' standing to assert a\nFourteenth Amendment violation, the district court correctly\ndetermined that the Title VI standard was the same as the\nconstitutional standard. United States v. Louisiana, 692 F. Supp.\n642, 649-50 (E.D. La. 1988); see also United States v. Fordice, 112\nS. Ct. 2727, 2738 n.7 (1992) (\"[T]he reach of Title VI's protection\nextends no further than the Fourteenth Amendment.\"); Regents of\nUniv. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 287 (1978) (opinion of\nPowell, J.) (Title VI proscribes \"only those racial classifications\nthat would violate the Equal Protection Clause or the Fifth\nAmendment\"); 438 U.S. at 352 (Brennan, White, Marshall, and\nBlackmun, JJ., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (\"Title\nVI's standard . . . is no broader than the Constitution's.\")\n2\n  This provision states, \"No person in the United States shall, on\nthe ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from\nparticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to\ndiscrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal\nfinancial assistance.\"\n\n                                         2\n\fthe consent decree failed to dismantle its racially dual structure.\n\nUnited States v. Louisiana, 692 F. Supp. 642, 653-57 (E.D. La.\n\n1988) (sometimes called the \"1988 liability order\").                Following\n\nlengthy hearings before a special master on the question of remedy,\n\nthe district court directed the State to implement the special\n\nmaster's recommended remedial plan as modified.           United States v.\n\nLouisiana, 718 F. Supp. 499, 515-21 (E.D. La. 1989).                Primarily\n\nthis 1989 remedial order required consolidation of the State's four\n\nhigher education boards into a single board, classification of the\n\ninstitutions    by     selective     admissions    and   separate     mission\n\nstatements,    a     comprehensive     community    college   system,     and\n\nconsolidating measures such as program transfer.           Id. at 515-19.\n\n     During the appeal and remand of the remedial order, this Court\n\ndecided Ayers, which held that a race-neutral admissions policy\n\nsatisfies a state's obligation to desegregate.            Ayers v. Allain,\n\n914 F.2d 676 (5th Cir. 1990) (en banc).             Considering Ayers and\n\nLouisiana's open admissions, the district court then vacated its\n\nearlier orders and granted summary judgment in favor of the State\n\nDefendants.    United States v. Louisiana, 751 F. Supp. 606, 608\n\n(E.D. La. 1990).        When Ayers was reversed, United States v.\n\nFordice, 112 S. Ct. 2727 (1992), this Court vacated the new summary\n\njudgment and remanded for reconsideration in light of Fordice.\n\n     The district court then ordered the parties to show cause why\n\nits 1988 liability order should not be reinstated and a revised\n\nremedial order should not be entered in light of Fordice.               After\n\nresponses were filed, the district court reinstated the 1988\n\n\n                                       3\n\fliability order and entered another revised remedial order (the\n\n\"1992 order\").       The State Defendants appeal.\n\n                     II.    JUSTICIABILITY OF LIABILITY\n\n      In   a   separate     appeal,   the   Southern   University   Board     of\n\nSupervisors complains that the district court lacked jurisdiction\n\nto abrogate the 1981 consent decree because the validity of the\n\nconsent decree was not a justiciable case or controversy.\n\n      The Southern Board argues that the only dispute about the\n\nconsent decree was whether the State had complied with it--not its\n\nvalidity or terms.         This is inaccurate.    Near the end of the term\n\nof   the   consent    decree,    when   the   United   States   moved   for    a\n\ndetermination of Louisiana's compliance with the consent decree, it\n\nalso requested a hearing to determine \"whether defendants . . . are\n\noperating the system of public higher education on a unitary basis\"\n\nand requested an order maintaining jurisdiction over the entire\n\nlitigation. The consent decree provided for the court's continuing\n\njurisdiction \"to insure that the Louisiana system of public higher\n\neducation is operated on a unitary basis in all respects.\"                  The\n\nconsent decree also provided that the Plaintiff could before\n\nDecember 31, 1987 request the court to determine whether Defendants\n\nwere operating the system of public higher education on a unitary\n\nbasis.     This is precisely what the United States did.\n\n      After    the   motions    for   summary   judgment   were   filed,    the\n\ndistrict court noted that the consent decree \"was directed more\n\ntowards merely enhancing the State's black schools as black schools\n\nrather than towards 'convert[ing] its white colleges and black\n\n\n                                        4\n\fcolleges to just colleges.'\"          692 F. Supp. at 658 (footnote\n\nomitted).    The court found a continuing constitutional violation,\n\nconcluded that the consent decree had not dismantled the dual\n\nsystem, and that a more effective remedy was required.\n\n     The     Southern   Board's    argument   that   the   court   lacked\n\njurisdiction because it sua sponte took a question about which\n\nthere was no case or controversy is without merit.           The parties\n\ncould not agree on whether the State had dismantled its dual\n\nsystem.     By the terms of the consent decree, no determination of\n\nwhether Defendants violated any law had been made.            The United\n\nStates' motion put at issue the efficacy of the consent decree in\n\nachieving a unitary system.        The court retained jurisdiction to\n\naddress this issue and properly reviewed the entire question\n\nwhether the Defendants were maintaining an unconstitutional dual\n\nsystem.\n\n                 III.   THE END OF THE CONSENT DECREE\n\n     The Southern Board next argues that the court's reason for\n\ninvalidating the consent decree in 1988--the continued racial\n\nidentifiability of the institutions--was erroneous in light of the\n\n1992 decision in Fordice.         The Southern Board is vague on what\n\nrelief it is requesting from this Court, but apparently it desires\n\nreinstatement of the consent decree.\n\n     The Southern Board's argument centers on how Fordice changes\n\na state's accountability for failure to obtain racially homogenized\n\nschools in the higher education context.         We agree that racial\n\nidentifiability, while relevant under Fordice, does not define the\n\n\n                                     5\n\fstandard for determining whether a state has dismantled its dual\n\nsystem (or whether a consent decree has been effective to achieve\n\na unitary system).       As of 1992 Fordice provides the standard by\n\nwhich to determine whether the state is maintaining an unlawful\n\ndual system, and the United States is now entitled to another\n\nhearing on the question of the State's liability, as discussed\n\nnext.   But the Fordice decision does not breathe any new life into\n\nthe consent decree.\n\n                           IV.    FORDICE ISSUES\n\n     The State first contends that the district court based its\n\nliability decision on nothing more than the racial identifiability\n\nof the institutions, even though Fordice established a stricter\n\nstandard for holding a state liable for unlawful segregation.              The\n\nState argues that the 1988 liability order was based solely on\n\nracial identifiability of the schools and boards.               The Southern\n\nBoard   also    argues   that    the   court   misinterpreted    Fordice    by\n\npresuming unlawful segregation exists if the schools are racially\n\nidentifiable.\n\n        A.     The Standard:    More than Racial Identifiability\n\n     We agree with the State Defendants that under Fordice, \"[t]hat\n\nan institution is predominately white or black does not in itself\n\nmake out a constitutional violation.\" Fordice, 112 S. Ct. at 2743.\n\nUnder Fordice liability is based on specific state policies or\n\npractices:       \"[A] State does not discharge its constitutional\n\nobligations [to dismantle its prior dual university system] until\n\nit eradicates policies and practices traceable to its prior de jure\n\n\n                                       6\n\fdual system that continue to foster segregation.\"                Id. at 2735.\n\n       If the State perpetuates policies and practices traceable\n       to its prior system that continue to have segregative\n       effects--whether by influencing student enrollment\n       decisions or by fostering segregation in other facets of\n       the university system--and such policies are without\n       sound educational justification and can be practicably\n       eliminated, the State has not satisfied its burden of\n       proving that it has dismantled its prior system.\n\nId. at 2737.      We read Fordice to require that each suspect state\n\npolicy or practice be analyzed to determine whether it is traceable\n\nto the prior de jure system, whether it continues to foster\n\nsegregation, whether it lacks sound educational justification, and\n\nwhether its elimination is practicable. This is the State's burden\n\nto show that it has dismantled its prior dual system at the\n\nliability stage of litigation.\n\n       We read Fordice to also mandate inquiry into the soundness of\n\nthe educational justification for challenged policies and the\n\npracticability of eliminating them in consideration of remedy once\n\nliability is found.       According to Fordice, \"the State may not leave\n\nin place policies rooted in its prior officially-segregated system\n\nthat    serve    to    maintain   the     racial     identifiability    of   its\n\nuniversities     if    those   policies     can    practicably   be   eliminated\n\nwithout eroding sound educational policies.\" Id. at 2743 (emphasis\n\nadded).   Fordice also directs that \"[i]f policies traceable to the\n\nde jure system are still in force and have discriminatory effects,\n\nthose policies . . . must be reformed to the extent practicable and\n\nconsistent      with   sound   educational        practices.\"     Id.   at   2736\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n       We interpret these directives as recognizing the need to\n\n                                        7\n\fconsider the practicability and soundness of educational practices\n\nin    determining      remedies   as     well     as    in     making       an    initial\n\ndetermination of liability.            We do not read Fordice as prohibiting\n\na bifurcated determination of liability and remedy, although some\n\nmatters may be pertinent to both aspects of the trial.\n\n      We agree with the State that the 1988 liability order was\n\nbased    on     the    undisputed       fact     of     the     persistent         racial\n\nidentifiability of Louisiana's public colleges and universities,\n\ndespite the efforts under the consent decree.                  692 F. Supp. at 644-\n\n46.     The reinstatement of the 1988 liability order in 1992,\n\nhowever, was based on more than the undisputed facts that were\n\nbefore the court in 1988 when it first found liability.                          In 1992,\n\nthe district court also considered the record created in the\n\nremedial hearings        before   the     special      master       in   1989     and   the\n\nremedial      proceedings     before    the    district       court      following      the\n\nspecial master's report.\n\n      The     district   court    found,       \"based    on    the       entire    record\n\n[]including      the   most   recent     submissions,\"         1)    that    the    State\n\n\"continues to act through its policies and practices in a manner\n\nthat promotes segregation . . .; 2) those policies and practices\n\nare traceable to Louisiana's long history and endorsement of\n\nsegregation; and 3) Louisiana's policies and practices are without\n\nsound educational justification and can be practically eliminated.\"\n\n1992 order at 17 (footnotes omitted).                  This holding demonstrates\n\nthat in its 1992 order the court reinstated the 1988 liability\n\nsummary judgment based on more than the racial composition of the\n\n\n                                          8\n\fschools.    The court considered the requirements of Fordice in\n\ndetermining liability in 1992.\n\n                     B.   Specific Analysis Required\n\n     The State also challenges the summary judgment liability\n\nruling on the ground that the court's findings3 are too generalized\n\nto satisfy Fordice, because they do not specifically identify state\n\npolicies    and    practices    that   extended   the   effects   of     past\n\ndiscrimination.     The district court recited these general findings\n\nonly after adopting the findings made in the earlier proceedings.\n\n1992 order at 17 (adopting by reference the court's \"findings of\n\nfact as set forth in its prior opinions and orders and reasons\");\n\nsee also id. at 2 (parties overlooked court's \"findings relative to\n\nthe issue of liability\"); id. at 12-14 (refusing to regard the\n\ncourt's earlier findings as outdated).        The court stated, \"[W]hen\n\nthe record in this case is viewed as a whole, the analytic\n\nframework    and    requisite    factual   inquiries    now   required     as\n\narticulated in Fordice were made by this Court long before it had\n\nthe benefit of the Supreme Court's guidance.\"           Id. at 17.4\n\n3\n   Federal Rule 52 does not require a court to make findings on a\nRule 56 motion, because \"findings\" imply decisions on disputed\nfacts. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a). On a summary judgment motion a\ncourt may, however, set forth as \"findings\" the facts which it\nconsiders undisputed on which its decision turns, as Judge Schwartz\nhas done in this case. Such a practice is \"greatly helpful to the\nappellate court in making clear the basis for the trial court's\ndecision.\"    United States for the Use and Benefit of Indus.\nInstrument Corp. v. Paul Hardeman, Inc., 320 F.2d 115, 116 (5th\nCir. 1963).\n4\n   The court also said its \"considered decision with respect to\nremedy necessarily involved inquiry into such matters as\neducational soundness of current state policies and the\npracticability of dispensing with them; the very same issues\n\n                                       9\n\f       Assessing the 1992 order in the framework of the adopted\n\nearlier opinions, we perceive that the district court indeed\n\nconsidered     individual      policies     and    practices    with       sufficient\n\nspecificity to satisfy Fordice, namely, Louisiana's open admissions\n\npolicy, and program duplication in proximate institutions.5                        The\n\ncourt also considered the four-board governance of Louisiana's\n\ninstitutions of higher education.\n\n       In its 1989 remedial order the court found that \"the racial\n\nidentifiability of Louisiana's state universities is especially\n\nevident in the coexistence of predominantly black institutions\n\n(PBIs)   and   predominantly        white      institutions    (PWIs)       in   close\n\ngeographic proximity in four areas of the state.\"                   718 F. Supp. at\n\n504.     The   court   found    that   program      duplication       at   proximate\n\ninstitutions has a \"stultifying effect on desegregation,\" and\n\n\"permits   schools     to   cater    to     students   of     one   race,    thereby\n\nhindering desegregation goals.\"                Id. at 513.     In 1992 the court\n\nfound that Louisiana has continued its dual system, \"perpetuated by\n\nduplicative programs, multiple boards, coexistence of PBIs and PWIs\n\nwith similar programs existing in close proximity to each other.\"\n\n1992 order at 13.       These findings sufficiently identify program\n\nduplication in proximate institutions as a policy that fosters\n\nsegregation today.\n\n\nconsidered in Fordice.\"         1992 order at 14-15.\n5\n  By \"proximate institutions\" we mean the four pairs of Louisiana\ninstitutions that are nearby each other, one of which is a\npredominantly black institution (or PBI), and one of which is a\npredominantly white institution (or PWI), namely, UNO and SUNO,\nLSU-BR and SU-BR, LSU-S and SUSBO, Louisiana Tech and Grambling.\n\n                                          10\n\f     We also find Fordice's \"traceability\" requirement implicit in\n\nthe district court's analysis.         The Supreme Court has concluded\n\nthat program duplication between a historically white college and\n\na historically black college in Mississippi was part of that\n\nstate's prior dual system:         \"the whole notice of 'separate but\n\nequal' required duplicative programs in two sets of schools--and\n\n. . . the present unnecessary duplication is a continuation of that\n\npractice.\"    Fordice, 112 S. Ct. at 2741.        When the proximate PBIs\n\nand PWIs in Louisiana were historically segregated by law, program\n\nduplication was intentional--to insure that the two sets of schools\n\nwere \"separate but equal.\"\n\n     The court also at least implicitly considered whether program\n\nduplication    in    proximate   institutions    lacks   sound    educational\n\njustification, in observing that program duplication is excessive,\n\nunnecessary, costly, and inefficient.            718 F. Supp. at 508, 513\n\nFinally, the court concluded that program duplication could be\n\npracticably eliminated, through elimination of the multi-board\n\nstructure     that   would   enable    program    transfers      and   program\n\nelimination, and through tiering or classifying institutions by\n\nselective admissions standards and revised mission statements. 718\n\nF. Supp. at 509-13.\n\n     That unnecessary program duplication in proximate PBIs and\n\nPWIs was considered by the district court to be an unlawful policy\n\nor practice is readily apparent from its findings.               Accordingly,\n\nwith respect to this practice, we reject the challenge that the\n\ncourt rendered its liability judgment on findings that were too\n\n\n                                      11\n\fgeneralized.        The district court indeed analyzed with sufficient\n\nspecificity       under      Fordice     the     State's       continuing       program\n\nduplication in proximate PBIs and PWIs as an unlawful practice.\n\n     The    district      court      also   criticized        both    the    four-board\n\ngovernance       and   the    open     admissions    policies         of    Louisiana's\n\ninstitutions of higher education as policies or practices which\n\nviolate    the    Fordice     standard.6         Under    Louisiana's        governance\n\nsystem, a Board of Regents has overall authority, while three\n\ngoverning boards manage specific colleges and universities.                          The\n\nremedial order disbands the four boards and orders a single board.\n\n     The United States has not challenged the four-board governing\n\nsystem as unlawful, but the court nevertheless found that the\n\ngovernance system violates the federal constitution.                        718 F. Supp.\n\nat 505; see also 1992 order at 15-16 (quoting its earlier findings\n\nregarding     the      multi-board      structure        as   an     example    of   the\n\nsufficiency of its findings to support a liability decision under\n\nFordice).

Much of the criticism of both the multi-\nboard system and the open admissions policies was that they foster\nprogram duplication and inefficiencies, and that their elimination\nwould help resolve the problem of program duplication.          For\nexample, the court found that the four-board system \"led to\nunnecessary . . . program duplication\" and that to an extent\nprogram duplication \"results from the multi-board structure.\" Id.\nat 15 (quoting 718 F. Supp. at 508). As for the open admissions\npolicy, the court noted that this policy fails to organize students\nby academic ability, resulting in program inefficiencies and the\nnecessity that each institution provide remedial programs. Id. at\n16 n.47 (quoting 718 F. Supp. at 510 n.19).\n    We express no opinion whether a remedial order addressing an\nunlawful policy, if any is found on remand, might include a\nrestructuring of the multi-board system or the open admissions\npolicy if these are not independently found to be unlawful\npolicies.\n\n                                            12\n\fof the four-board system cannot be determined under Fordice,\n\nbecause the challenged four-board system is not a \"policy or\n\npractice\" but a state constitutional provision.\n\n     We agree.        The Louisiana Constitution of 1974 created the\n\nfour-board system, La. Const. art. VIII, §§ 5-7; id. art. XIV, §§\n\n1-5 (transitional provisions); and laws have been enacted to carry\n\nthese    provisions    into     effect.         E.g.,    La.   Rev.    Stat.     Ann.\n\n§§ 17:1453-1555, 1831-54, 3121-33, 3215-22, 3351 (West 1982 & Supp.\n\n1993).    This court is not convinced that the Fordice analysis is\n\napplicable to determine whether the establishment of the four\n\nboards is unlawful.       Fordice addresses the \"surviving aspects of\n\n[the State's] prior dual system,\" Fordice, 112 S. Ct. at 2738; thus\n\nFordice comes    into    play    when     the    segregative    laws      have   been\n\nrepealed, but policies and practices traceable to the de jure dual\n\nsystem subsist. The four-board system of governance created by the\n\nState constitution in 1974 is not such a surviving \"policy or\n\npractice\" within the meaning of Fordice.                Its constitutionality is\n\ndetermined under different principles.\n\n     \"[T]he invidious quality of a law claimed to be racially\n\ndiscriminatory    must        ultimately        be   traced    to     a    racially\n\ndiscriminatory purpose.\"         Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 240,\n\n96 S. Ct. 2040, 2048 (1976).            \"Proof of racially discriminatory\n\nintent or purpose is required to show a violation of the Equal\n\nProtection Clause.\"      Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan\n\nHous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 265, 97 St. Ct. 555, 563 (1977).\n\nThis same analysis applies to a provision in a state constitution.\n\n\n                                        13\n\fHunter v. Underwood, 471 U.S. 220, 227-28, 105 S. Ct. 1916, 1920\n\n(1985) (applying approach of Arlington Heights to determine whether\n\nstate   constitutional      provision   violated    the    Equal     Protection\n\nClause).\n\n     The court found the four-board system unconstitutional without\n\nanalyzing   the   State's    constitutional      provisions     or    the   laws\n\neffectuating them under traditional equal protection principles,\n\nsuch as whether a provision has a disproportionate impact that can\n\nbe traced to a discriminatory purpose.7          The judgment is therefore\n\nreversed,   because   the    court   did   not   apply    the   correct     legal\n\nstandard in holding that the four-board system is unconstitutional.\n\n     The court also recognized Louisiana's open admissions policy\n\nas a policy which is \"counter-productive . . . in terms of . . .\n\nracial integration.\"     1992 order at 15-16 (quoting 718 F. Supp. at\n\n510).    This finding addresses the Fordice inquiry whether the\n\n\n7\n    The court found that the multi-board governing system has\n\"perpetuated\" and \"sustain[ed]\" a segregated higher education\nsystem. 718 F. Supp. at 505; 1992 order at 16 n.47. It also found\nthat the organization of the institutions of higher education under\nfour boards had \"little regard for logic or efficiency\" (1992 order\nat 16 n.47); and that the existence of four boards impairs the\nState's ability to enhance its historically black institutions\n(both by dissipating scarce resources and by leaving the State\nwithout an organizational structure with the power to make program\ndecisions statewide or power to give desirable programs to the\nhistorically black institutions) (1992 order at 15 (quoting 718 F.\nSupp. at 508)). After considering comparisons with alternative\nsystems, the court concluded that the multi-board system could be\neliminated in favor of a \"single-board solution,\" and by organizing\nthe institutions under a \"mission assignment framework\" instead of\nunder the framework of the four boards. 1992 order at 15 (quoting\n718 F. Supp at 508), 16 & n.47. This analysis approaches that of\nFordice, and the findings are persuasive, but the court did not\nanalyze the question whether the four-board system is traceable to\nde jure segregation in Louisiana.\n\n                                     14\n\fstate's   open    admissions         policy      fosters    segregation.            As     for\n\neducational justification, the court noted that the open admissions\n\npolicy    fails   to    meet    the    educational         objective        of    producing\n\ngraduates,   and       that    the   policy      is    inefficient      in       failing    to\n\norganize students by academic ability.                      Id.        The court found\n\ntiering the institutions by selective admission standards and\n\nclassifying them by revised mission statements to be feasible\n\nalternatives      to    open    admissions        at   every   institution.              More\n\nspecific consideration of the practicability of eliminating the\n\npolicy is not required under Fordice.\n\n     The open admissions policy was instituted after Louisiana's de\n\njure segregation         ended,      and   the    court    failed      to     address      the\n\npolicy's traceability to the state's prior de jure system.                               Under\n\nFordice, a policy is unconstitutional only if \"traceable to its\n\nprior [de jure] system.\"               Fordice, 112 S. Ct. at 2737.                        The\n\nquestion whether Louisiana's open admissions policy meets the\n\nFordice traceability requirement must be resolved (if challenged)\n\non remand.    \"[I]f challenged policies are not rooted in the prior\n\ndual system, the question becomes whether the fact of racial\n\nseparation establishes a new violation of the Fourteenth Amendment\n\nunder traditional principles.\"              Fordice, 112 S. Ct. at 2737 n.6.\n\n     In sum, we find that the district court adequately applied\n\nFordice to the State's practice of continuing program duplication\n\nin proximate institutions and to the State's open admissions\n\npolicy, except         with    respect     to    the    traceability        of     the    open\n\nadmissions    policy.          The    constitutionality           of    the      four-board\n\n\n                                           15\n\fgovernance system was not determined under the appropriate legal\n\nprinciples.\n\n                          C.      Disputed Facts\n\n     The State also challenges the summary judgment findings on the\n\nground that they are based on disputed facts.            The State and the\n\nSouthern Board urge that reinstatement of summary judgment on\n\nliability was inappropriate because some Fordice issues remain\n\ngenuinely disputed.      The district court relied on the special\n\nmaster's   determinations    of    factual    issues   after   the   remedial\n\nhearings and reinstated the summary judgment based in part on those\n\nfindings without holding another evidentiary hearing. According to\n\nthe United States, however, summary judgment on these findings is\n\nproper because the findings are based on undisputed evidence,\n\nlargely the State's own evidence.          Yet the State Defendants insist\n\nthat the court did not rely on undisputed facts, because the\n\nspecial master's findings were based on controverted evidence.\n\n     Summary judgment is appropriate only if the record discloses\n\n\"that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that\n\nthe moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).      Evidence adduced at a hearing may support\n\na summary judgment when the testimony is uncontradicted and the\n\nfactual basis for judgment admits no genuine controversy about\n\nmaterial matters.

The Board of Supervisors' expert, Dr. Donald\n\nSmith,   criticized    as     inaccurate       Dr.   Conrad's    definition     of\n\n\"duplication\"--as programs in two or more nearby institutions in\n\nthe same program category or subprogram category of the HEGIS\n\ndata.8     Dr. Smith notes that the HEGIS categories provide very\n\nlittle information about the content of a program.

McTarnaghan of Apr. 21, 1981, filed Sep. 4, 1981, at 117\n\n(\"[F]requently courses that . . . are titled quite differently are\n\nmuch more the same than those that are titled the same.\").                 In Dr.\n\nRobert   Berdahl's    opinion,     whether      a    program    offered   at   one\n\ninstitution    in   fact    duplicates     a    program   offered   at    another\n\ninstitution cannot be determined \"without doing a detailed onsight\n\ninspection the way accrediting teams do.             But just reading from the\n\ncollege catalog or reading a HEGIS number . . . seems a terribly\n\nsimplistic way to say these are duplicate programs.\"\n\n     Dr.    Smith    also    criticizes        Dr.   Conrad's    definition     of\n\n\"unnecessary\"--as carrying a program title outside the list Dr.\n\nConrad defines as \"core.\"           Cf. Conrad's Louisiana Curriculum\n\nAnalysis.     In Dr. Smith's opinion, Dr. Conrad's definition of an\n\n\n8\n   The acronym stands for Higher Education General Information\nSurvey. This was a compilation by the Department of Education of\nstatistics and information supplied by the institutions of higher\neducation to the federal government.\n\n                                      17\n\f\"unnecessary\" program would not agree with a college's own list of\n\nwhich of its offerings were not \"essential.\"                Similarly, Dr.\n\nBerdahl believes that Dr. Conrad \"takes a grossly over-simplified\n\napproach to    defining     unnecessary     program   duplication,\"    partly\n\nbecause Dr. Conrad does not consider student need in defining\n\nnecessary.9    In Dr. Smith's opinion, a finding of \"unnecessary\n\nduplication\" could be made only by examining a set of offerings in\n\na particular setting, considering the educational mission of an\n\ninstitution.\n\n       This evidence leaves room for different inferences:            we find\n\nthat   a   question   of   fact   remains   whether   unnecessary     program\n\nduplication exists in Louisiana's colleges and universities.\n\n       We also detect fact issues regarding the practicability of\n\neliminating program duplication. Dr. Smith notes the reluctance of\n\nfaculty to accept transfer or of faculty at a transferee university\n\nto receive transferring faculty happily.          He also asserts that a\n\nprogram cannot be moved without materially changing its substance,\n\n\n9\n   Dr. Berdahl explained,\n      To merely take the idea of every institution should offer a\n      general education core of subjects, but that anything they\n      offer beyond that at the Bachelor's level and then all masters\n      and then all doctoral duplication, is by definition\n      unnecessary, seems to me to play fast and loose with the word\n      unnecessary. . . . [Conrad says] that he did not at all\n      consider student need, which is universally . . . considered\n      a vital element in whether or not a program duplication is\n      necessary or unnecessary.\n     Dr. Berdahl would define \"unnecessary\" program duplication\nbeginning with a composite profile of what a \"normal\" four year\ncollege offers, which \"would go far beyond the minimum core of\ngeneral education.\"     To define the term unnecessary he would\nconsider not only this composite profile but also student need,\nquality, and state's ability to pay.\n\n                                     18\n\fin part because of the interactions between the courses in a\n\nprogram with the content of other courses offered at the same\n\nschool.\n\n      Dr. Smith believes that program transfer would damage the\n\nquality of the programs and of the university.10   The State adduced\n\nevidence that program transfers at two Georgia colleges resulted in\n\na drop in enrollment at both schools and failed to achieve the\n\nexpected transfer of students from one to the other.11   Dr. Cameron\n\nFincher testified that in Georgia, \"what they thought to be the\n\nprogram included more than what was transferred.\"    Fincher Dep. at\n\n79.   Besides courses in the major field, other courses have to be\n\ntaken.    Id. at 79-80.   He concluded that after reciprocal program\n\ntransfers from two institutions, \"the quality of both programs has\n\nbeen somewhat shaken because of the transfer.\"     Id. at 81.\n\n10\n   This factual dispute was further highlighted by the testimony\nof Dr. Berdahl.    Berdahl believes that in implementing program\ntransfers,\n     we are doing no favor to either the students who might\n     get hurt in the process of massive social engineering or\n     to the institutions that we are trying to pull programs\n     out of an organic context and graft them into a different\n     situation. . . . Program clusters, you know, programs\n     are related to each other.\n11\n   See Dep. of Dr. Cameron Fincher of Jun. 4, 1981, filed Sep. 4,\n1989, at 61-63. Individual choice of students defeated the plan to\ndesegregate: students selected \"surrogate majors\" at the school of\ntheir choice rather than transferring to the school with the first-\nchoice major. Id. at 76-77. For example, athletes who wanted a\nmajor in physical education, a program removed to a different\ncollege, simply found a major in a related field such as\n\"recreation and/or parks administration\" at their home institution\nrather than changing their selection of college.           Id. Dr.\nMcTarnaghan observed a similar reaction by students to terminating\nor transferring duplicative programs in Florida: students would\nremain loyal to their institution and change majors. McTarnaghan\nDep. at 68-69, 218-19, 225.\n\n                                  19\n\f     Inasmuch   as   this   testimony       defines   a   dispute   about   the\n\npracticability of program transfer, it seems at first to raise a\n\nremedial rather than a liability issue.          (Program transfer was one\n\nof several suggested remedies for unnecessary program duplication,\n\nalong with merger, cooperative programs, and program termination\n\naccompanied by establishing new programs.)                But we think this\n\ntestimony   also   bears    on   the   liability      determination    of   the\n\npracticability of eliminating unnecessary program duplication in\n\nproximate   institutions.         To    ascertain      the    feasibility    of\n\neliminating or remediating a policy, one can scarcely ignore the\n\nfeasibility of alternative or remedial measures.              The conflict in\n\ntestimony about program transfers thus reveals a disputed issue\n\nregarding the practicability of eliminating duplicate programs.\n\n     As for the educational justification for maintaining duplicate\n\nprograms at proximate institutions, the district court found that\n\nprogram duplication was excessive, costly, and inefficient.                 The\n\nState has not specifically pointed out evidence which raises a\n\nquestion of fact regarding the educational soundness of maintaining\n\nduplicate programs at proximate PBIs and PWIs.               Instead the State\n\nargues that the district court acknowledged a disputed issue\n\nregarding the educational justification for the continued existence\n\nof the proximate institutions in the following remark:              \"Among the\n\nproblems [of merging proximate institutions] are merging student\n\nbodies of highly disparate academic backgrounds, potential loss of\n\nqualified faculty and administrators who were attracted to a school\n\nbecause of its academic characteristics and goals, and undermining\n\n\n                                       20\n\fblack institutions such as Grambling and Southern with substantial\n\nalumni following.\"       718 F. Supp. at 507 (rejecting merger as a\n\npossible remedy).\n\n     Does this observation by the district court imply a disputed\n\nquestion whether some educational justification for continuing\n\nduplicate programs in proximate institutions may exist?            We think\n\nso, though our decision is made more difficult by the State's\n\nfailure to point out the evidence which demonstrates a disputed\n\nissue.   Implicit in the court's remark is the suggestion that\n\ncontinuing   duplicate    programs     at   proximate   institutions   might\n\nadvance the educational goals of classifying students by their\n\nlevel of preparedness and of retaining qualified faculty and\n\nadministrators at the schools which originally attracted them.              A\n\nfactfinder might infer that the advancement of these educational\n\ngoals provides    sound       educational   justification   for   continuing\n\nduplicate    programs    in    side-by-side   institutions.       Though   we\n\nconsider the issue to have been inadequately addressed by the\n\nparties, we discern an issue of fact regarding the soundness of\n\neducational justification for continuing duplicate programs.\n\n     Because of the disputed fact questions whether unnecessary\n\nprogram duplication in proximate institutions violated Fordice, the\n\ncourt improvidently rendered summary judgment on that basis.\n\n     Also, as noted previously, the open admissions policy was\n\ninstituted after Louisiana's de jure segregation ended.            We think\n\nthis fact inherently raises a genuine issue for trial because it\n\npermits an inference that the open admissions policy is not \"rooted\n\n\n                                      21\n\fin\" the State's prior de jure segregated system.                            The question\n\nwhether the open admissions policy meets the Fordice traceability\n\nrequirement must be resolved (if challenged) on remand.\n\n      We also find a fact issue whether an open admissions policy\n\nfosters segregation.          The district judge and the special master\n\nreached different conclusions about whether changing the open\n\nadmissions policy to a tiered system with graduated admission\n\nrequirements would affect desegregation efforts.                            The special\n\nmaster found, \"[t]here is no obvious and necessary connection\n\nbetween organization and desegregation. . . . Thus how state\n\nuniversities are organized can be viewed as an educational matter\n\nnot   rising    to     constitutional         levels.\"         The     district    court\n\nconcluded, however, that open admissions is \"counter-productive .\n\n. . in terms of . . . integration.\"                   1992 order at 15-16.        Though\n\nthe burden of pointing out issues of fact generally rests with the\n\nnon-moving     party    and    the    State       has   suggested      no    conflicting\n\nevidence on the point, we cannot help but find a fact issue because\n\nof the special master's and trial court's differing \"findings.\" No\n\nparty   has    suggested      any    issue       of   fact   regarding       educational\n\njustification for or the practicability of eliminating the open\n\nadmissions policy, and we discern none.\n\n      We   greatly      respect       the    district        court's    diligence     in\n\nattempting to resolve this protracted litigation expeditiously. We\n\nalso commend the trial judge for his obvious familiarity with the\n\nmassive record in this case and his circumspection in attempting to\n\nframe remedial measures.             In such an old case, where the state's\n\n\n                                            22\n\fcolleges and universities remain starkly racially identifiable, we\n\nremand for continued litigation with great reluctance.                       But in\n\nreviewing      the   reinstatement      of     summary    judgment,     we     have\n\nascertained disputed material facts.             To the extent that genuine\n\nissues of fact remain on the liability issues noted above, the\n\nsummary judgment on liability must be reversed.\n\n                               V.    DUE PROCESS\n\n     The    Southern   Board    and    the    State   also   argue    that    using\n\nevidence from the pre-Fordice remedial proceedings to determine\n\nliability under Fordice denied the State defendants due process.\n\nThe gist of this complaint is that the State Defendants had no\n\nreasonable opportunity to contest liability under the Fordice\n\nstandards.     Because of our remand today the State defendants will\n\nhave the opportunity to develop the record on the disputed Fordice\n\nissues and the due process violation, if any occurred, will be\n\ncured.\n\n                          VI.       REMEDIAL ISSUES\n\n     Because of the existence of factual disputes on liability, the\n\nremedial order is vacated and we do not reach the State Defendants'\n\nfinal assigned errors relating to remedy, with the single exception\n\nof one which has been previously decided.                The Southern Board of\n\nSupervisors argues that a single district judge lacks authority to\n\nenjoin   the    enforcement    of    the     state   constitutional    provision\n\nsetting forth the four-board governing structure of Louisiana\n\nhigher education, citing 28 U.S.C. § 2281 (repealed 1976).                      The\n\nstatute provides that an injunction restraining the enforcement of\n\n\n                                        23\n\fa state statute on a ground of unconstitutionality should not be\n\ngranted unless the application has been . . . determined by a\n\nthree-judge district court.\"\n\n       Though originally a three-judge district court ordered the\n\nsingle-board remedy in the 1989 remedial order, 718 F. Supp. at\n\n515-16, the later modified remedial orders embracing a single-board\n\nsystem were single-judge matters.          After the three-judge panel's\n\nremedial order, the State and the Southern Board filed direct\n\nappeals in the Supreme Court.         On the United States Government's\n\nmotion to dismiss on the ground that the three-judge court was not\n\nrequired, the Supreme Court dismissed the appeals for want of\n\njurisdiction.      110 S. Ct. 708 (1990).      This Court stated that the\n\nSupreme      Court's   dismissals   were    predicated   on   the    implicit\n\nconclusion \"that the case in the district court was not properly a\n\nthree-judge district court case\" under former § 2281.                We agree\n\nwith   the    interpretation   of   the    earlier   appellate     panel   that\n\nconsidered the matter.\n\n                                CONCLUSION\n\n       We reverse the summary adjudication of liability, vacate the\n\nremedial order, and remand for a determination of liability, and\n\nremedy if necessary, after resolution of any remaining factual\n\ndisputes.\n\n       Remedial    order   VACATED;    summary   judgment     on    liability\n\nREVERSED; REMANDED.\n\n\n\n\n                                      24\n\f",

Because summary judgment was improperly granted, we vacate the remedial order, reverse the liability judgment, and remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the civil rights era Louisiana repealed its school segregation laws.  The United States sued Louisiana in 1974 alleging that the State was still maintaining a racially discriminatory system of higher education violating the Fourteenth Amendment<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000d.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1981 the court entered a consent decree under which Louisiana was to begin affirmative action and enhance its predominately black public institutions of higher education.  In December 1987 the United States moved for a hearing to determine Louisiana's compliance with this consent decree and to determine whether the State and the governing boards of its colleges and universities were operating its system of public higher education on a unitary basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment on the issue of liability, i.e., the question whether the State maintained an unlawfully segregated system of higher education.  The district court ruled for the United States, holding that the State had under the consent decree failed to dismantle its racially dual structure.  United States v. Louisiana, 692 F.Supp. 642, 653-57 (E.D.La.1988) (sometimes called the \"1988 liability order\").  Following lengthy hearings before a special master on the question of remedy, the district court directed the State to implement the special master's recommended remedial plan as modified.  United States v. Louisiana, 718 F.Supp. 499, 515-21 (E.D.La.1989).  Primarily this 1989 remedial order required consolidation of the State's four higher education boards into a single board, classification of the institutions by selective admissions and separate mission statements, a comprehensive community college system, and consolidating measures such as program transfer.  Id. at 515-19.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the appeal and remand of the remedial order, this Court decided Ayers, which held that a race-neutral admissions policy satisfies a state's obligation to desegregate.  Ayers v. Allain, 914 F.2d 676 (5th Cir.1990) (en banc).  Considering Ayers and Louisiana's open admissions, the district court then vacated its earlier orders and granted summary judgment in favor of the State Defendants.  United States v. Louisiana, 751 F.Supp. 606, 608 (E.D.La.1990).  When Ayers was reversed, United States v. Fordice, --- U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 2727, 120 L.Ed.2d 575 (1992), this Court vacated the new summary judgment and remanded for reconsideration in light of Fordice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court then ordered the parties to show cause why its 1988 liability order should not be reinstated and a revised remedial order should not be entered in light of Fordice.   After responses were filed, the district court reinstated the 1988 liability order and entered another revised remedial order (the \"1992 order\").  811 F.Supp. 1151.   The State Defendants appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. JUSTICIABILITY OF LIABILITY</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a separate appeal, the Southern University Board of Supervisors complains that the district court lacked jurisdiction to abrogate the 1981 consent decree because the validity of the consent decree was not a justiciable case or controversy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Southern Board argues that the only dispute about the consent decree was whether the State had complied with it--not its validity or terms.  This is inaccurate.  Near the end of the term of the consent decree, when the United States moved for a determination of Louisiana's compliance with the consent decree, it also requested a hearing to determine \"whether defendants ... are operating the system of public higher education on a unitary basis\" and requested an order maintaining jurisdiction over the entire litigation.  The consent decree provided for the court's continuing jurisdiction \"to insure that the Louisiana system of public higher education is operated on a unitary basis in all respects.\"   The consent decree also provided that the Plaintiff could before December 31, 1987 request the court to determine whether Defendants were operating the system of public higher education on a unitary basis.  This is precisely what the United States did.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the motions for summary judgment were filed, the district court noted that the consent decree \"was directed more towards merely enhancing the State's black schools as black schools rather than towards 'convert[ing] its white colleges and black colleges to just colleges.' \"  692 F.Supp. at 658 (footnote omitted).  The court found a continuing constitutional violation, concluded that the consent decree had not dismantled the dual system, and that a more effective remedy was required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Southern Board's argument that the court lacked jurisdiction because it sua sponte took a question about which there was no case or controversy is without merit.  The parties could not agree on whether the State had dismantled its dual system.  By the terms of the consent decree, no determination of whether Defendants violated any law had been made.  The United States' motion put at issue the efficacy of the consent decree in achieving a unitary system.  The court retained jurisdiction to address this issue and properly reviewed the entire question whether the Defendants were maintaining an unconstitutional dual system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. THE END OF THE CONSENT DECREE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Southern Board next argues that the court's reason for invalidating the consent decree in 1988--the continued racial identifiability of the institutions--was erroneous in light of the 1992 decision in Fordice.   The Southern Board is vague on what relief it is requesting from this Court, but apparently it desires reinstatement of the consent decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Southern Board's argument centers on how Fordice changes a state's accountability for failure to obtain racially homogenized schools in the higher education context.  We agree that racial identifiability, while relevant under Fordice, does not define the standard for determining whether a state has dismantled its dual system (or whether a consent decree has been effective to achieve a unitary system).  As of 1992 Fordice provides the standard by which to determine whether the state is maintaining an unlawful dual system, and the United States is now entitled to another hearing on the question of the State's liability, as discussed next.  But the Fordice decision does not breathe any new life into the consent decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. FORDICE ISSUES</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The State first contends that the district court based its liability decision on nothing more than the racial identifiability of the institutions, even though Fordice established a stricter standard for holding a state liable for unlawful segregation.  The State argues that the 1988 liability order was based solely on racial identifiability of the schools and boards.  The Southern Board also argues that the court misinterpreted Fordice by presuming unlawful segregation exists if the schools are racially identifiable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>A. The Standard:  More than Racial Identifiability</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the State Defendants that under Fordice, \"[t]hat an institution is predominately white or black does not in itself make out a constitutional violation.\"  Fordice, --- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 2743.   Under Fordice liability is based on specific state policies or practices:  \"[A] State does not discharge its constitutional obligations [to dismantle its prior dual university system] until it eradicates policies and practices traceable to its prior de jure dual system that continue to foster segregation.\"  Id. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 2735.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p>If the State perpetuates policies and practices traceable to its prior system that continue to have segregative effects--whether by influencing student enrollment decisions or by fostering segregation in other facets of the university system--and such policies are without sound educational justification and can be practicably eliminated, the State has not satisfied its burden of proving that it has dismantled its prior system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 2737.   We read Fordice to require that each suspect state policy or practice be analyzed to determine whether it is traceable to the prior de jure system, whether it continues to foster segregation, whether it lacks sound educational justification, and whether its elimination is practicable.  This is the State's burden to show that it has dismantled its prior dual system at the liability stage of litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We read Fordice to also mandate inquiry into the soundness of the educational justification for challenged policies and the practicability of eliminating them in consideration of remedy once liability is found.  According to Fordice, \"the State may not leave in place policies rooted in its prior officially-segregated system that serve to maintain the racial identifiability of its universities if those policies can practicably be eliminated without eroding sound educational policies.\"  Id. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 2743 (emphasis added).  Fordice also directs that \"[i]f policies traceable to the de jure system are still in force and have discriminatory effects, those policies ... must be reformed to the extent practicable and consistent with sound educational practices.\"  Id. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 2736 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We interpret these directives as recognizing the need to consider the practicability and soundness of educational practices in determining remedies as well as in making an initial determination of liability.  We do not read Fordice as prohibiting a bifurcated determination of liability and remedy, although some matters may be pertinent to both aspects of the trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the State that the 1988 liability order was based on the undisputed fact of the persistent racial identifiability of Louisiana's public colleges and universities, despite the efforts under the consent decree.  692 F.Supp. at 644-46.   The reinstatement of the 1988 liability order in 1992, however, was based on more than the undisputed facts that were before the court in 1988 when it first found liability.  In 1992, the district court also considered the record created in the remedial hearings before the special master in 1989 and the remedial proceedings before the district court following the special master's report.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found, \"based on the entire record [ ]including the most recent submissions,\" 1) that the State \"continues to act through its policies and practices in a manner that promotes segregation ...;  2) those policies and practices are traceable to Louisiana's long history and endorsement of segregation;  and 3) Louisiana's policies and practices are without sound educational justification and can be practically eliminated.\"  1992 order 811 F.Supp. at 1159 (footnotes omitted).  This holding demonstrates that in its 1992 order the court reinstated the 1988 liability summary judgment based on more than the racial composition of the schools.  The court considered the requirements of Fordice in determining liability in 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Specific Analysis Required</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The State also challenges the summary judgment liability ruling on the ground that the court's findings<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> are too generalized to satisfy Fordice, because they do not specifically identify state policies and practices that extended the effects of past discrimination.  The district court recited these general findings only after adopting the findings made in the earlier proceedings.  1992 order 811 F.Supp. at 1159 (adopting by reference the court's \"findings of fact as set forth in its prior opinions and orders and reasons\");  see also id. at 1159 (parties overlooked court's \"findings relative to the issue of liability\");  id. at 1153 (refusing to regard the court's earlier findings as outdated).  The court stated, \"[W]hen the record in this case is viewed as a whole, the analytic framework and requisite factual inquiries now required as articulated in Fordice were made by this Court long before it had the benefit of the Supreme Court's guidance.\"  Id. at 1159.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assessing the 1992 order in the framework of the adopted earlier opinions, we perceive that the district court indeed considered individual policies and practices with sufficient specificity to satisfy Fordice, namely, Louisiana's open admissions policy, and program duplication in proximate institutions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  The court also considered the four-board governance of Louisiana's institutions of higher education.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its 1989 remedial order the court found that \"the racial identifiability of Louisiana's state universities is especially evident in the coexistence of predominantly black institutions (PBIs) and predominantly white institutions (PWIs) in close geographic proximity in four areas of the state.\"  718 F.Supp. at 504.   The court found that program duplication at proximate institutions has a \"stultifying effect on desegregation,\" and \"permits schools to cater to students of one race, thereby hindering desegregation goals.\"  Id. at 513.   In 1992 the court found that Louisiana has continued its dual system, \"perpetuated by duplicative programs, multiple boards, coexistence of PBIs and PWIs with similar programs existing in close proximity to each other.\"  1992 order 811 F.Supp. at 1157.   These findings sufficiently identify program duplication in proximate institutions as a policy that fosters segregation today.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also find Fordice 's \"traceability\" requirement implicit in the district court's analysis.  The Supreme Court has concluded that program duplication between a historically white college and a historically black college in Mississippi was part of that state's prior dual system:  \"the whole notice of 'separate but equal' required duplicative programs in two sets of schools--and ... the present unnecessary duplication is a continuation of that practice.\"  Fordice, --- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 2741.   When the proximate PBIs and PWIs in Louisiana were historically segregated by law, program duplication was intentional--to insure that the two sets of schools were \"separate but equal.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court also at least implicitly considered whether program duplication in proximate institutions lacks sound educational justification, in observing that program duplication is excessive, unnecessary, costly, and inefficient.  718 F.Supp. at 508, 513  Finally, the court concluded that program duplication could be practicably eliminated, through elimination of the multi-board structure that would enable program transfers and program elimination, and through tiering or classifying institutions by selective admissions standards and revised mission statements.  718 F.Supp. at 509-13.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That unnecessary program duplication in proximate PBIs and PWIs was considered by the district court to be an unlawful policy or practice is readily apparent from its findings.  Accordingly, with respect to this practice, we reject the challenge that the court rendered its liability judgment on findings that were too generalized.  The district court indeed analyzed with sufficient specificity under Fordice the State's continuing program duplication in proximate PBIs and PWIs as an unlawful practice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also criticized both the four-board governance and the open admissions policies of Louisiana's institutions of higher education as policies or practices which violate the Fordice standard.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Under Louisiana's governance system, a Board of Regents has overall authority, while three governing boards manage specific colleges and universities.  The remedial order disbands the four boards and orders a single board.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States has not challenged the four-board governing system as unlawful, but the court nevertheless found that the governance system violates the federal constitution.  718 F.Supp. at 505;  see also 1992 order 811 F.Supp. at 1158 (quoting its earlier findings regarding the multi-board structure as an example of the sufficiency of its findings to support a liability decision under Fordice ).   The Southern Board maintains that the constitutionality of the four-board system cannot be determined under Fordice, because the challenged four-board system is not a \"policy or practice\" but a state constitutional provision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree.  The Louisiana Constitution of 1974 created the four-board system, La.Const. art.  VIII, Secs. 5-7;  id. art.  XIV, Secs. 1-5 (transitional provisions);  and laws have been enacted to carry these provisions into effect.  E.g., La.Rev.Stat.Ann. Secs. 17:1453-1555, 1831-54, 3121-33, 3215-21, 3351 (West 1982 &amp; Supp.1993).  This court is not convinced that the Fordice analysis is applicable to determine whether the establishment of the four boards is unlawful.  Fordice addresses the \"surviving aspects of [the State's] prior dual system,\" Fordice, --- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 2738;  thus Fordice comes into play when the segregative laws have been repealed, but policies and practices traceable to the de jure dual system subsist.  The four-board system of governance created by the State constitution in 1974 is not such a surviving \"policy or practice\" within the meaning of Fordice.   Its constitutionality is determined under different principles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"[T]he invidious quality of a law claimed to be racially discriminatory must ultimately be traced to a racially discriminatory purpose.\"  Washington v.

Underwood, 471 U.S. 222, 227-28, 105 S.Ct. 1916, 1920, 85 L.Ed.2d 222 (1985) (applying approach of Arlington Heights to determine whether state constitutional provision violated the Equal Protection Clause).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court found the four-board system unconstitutional without analyzing the State's constitutional provisions or the laws effectuating them under traditional equal protection principles, such as whether a provision has a disproportionate impact that can be traced to a discriminatory purpose.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  The judgment is therefore reversed, because the court did not apply the correct legal standard in holding that the four-board system is unconstitutional.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court also recognized Louisiana's open admissions policy as a policy which is \"counter-productive ... in terms of ... racial integration.\"  1992 order 811 F.Supp. at 1158 (quoting 718 F.Supp. at 510).   This finding addresses the Fordice inquiry whether the state's open admissions policy fosters segregation.  As for educational justification, the court noted that the open admissions policy fails to meet the educational objective of producing graduates, and that the policy is inefficient in failing to organize students by academic ability.  Id.  The court found tiering the institutions by selective admission standards and classifying them by revised mission statements to be feasible alternatives to open admissions at every institution.  More specific consideration of the practicability of eliminating the policy is not required under Fordice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The open admissions policy was instituted after Louisiana's de jure segregation ended, and the court failed to address the policy's traceability to the state's prior de jure system.  Under Fordice, a policy is unconstitutional only if \"traceable to its prior [de jure ] system.\"  Fordice, --- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 2737.   The question whether Louisiana's open admissions policy meets the Fordice traceability requirement must be resolved (if challenged) on remand.  \"[I]f challenged policies are not rooted in the prior dual system, the question becomes whether the fact of racial separation establishes a new violation of the Fourteenth Amendment under traditional principles.\"  Fordice, --- U.S. at ---- n. 6, 112 S.Ct. at 2737 n. 6.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, we find that the district court adequately applied Fordice to the State's practice of continuing program duplication in proximate institutions and to the State's open admissions policy, except with respect to the traceability of the open admissions policy.  The constitutionality of the four-board governance system was not determined under the appropriate legal principles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Disputed Facts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The State also challenges the summary judgment findings on the ground that they are based on disputed facts.  The State and the Southern Board urge that reinstatement of summary judgment on liability was inappropriate because some Fordice issues remain genuinely disputed.  The district court relied on the special master's determinations of factual issues after the remedial hearings and reinstated the summary judgment based in part on those findings without holding another evidentiary hearing.  According to the United States, however, summary judgment on these findings is proper because the findings are based on undisputed evidence, largely the State's own evidence.  Yet the State Defendants insist that the court did not rely on undisputed facts, because the special master's findings were based on controverted evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Summary judgment is appropriate only if the record discloses \"that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"   Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).  Evidence adduced at a hearing may support a summary judgment when the testimony is uncontradicted and the factual basis for judgment admits no genuine controversy about material matters.

The Board of Supervisors' expert, Dr. Donald Smith, criticized as inaccurate Dr. Conrad's definition of \"duplication\"--as programs in two or more nearby institutions in the same program category or subprogram category of the HEGIS data.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Dr. Smith notes that the HEGIS categories provide very little information about the content of a program.  See also Dep. of Roy E. McTarnaghan of Apr. 21, 1981, filed Sep. 4, 1981, at 117 (\"[F]requently courses that ... are titled quite differently are much more the same than those that are titled the same.\").  In Dr. Robert Berdahl's opinion, whether a program offered at one institution in fact duplicates a program offered at another institution cannot be determined \"without doing a detailed onsight inspection the way accrediting teams do.  But just reading from the college catalog or reading a HEGIS number ... seems a terribly simplistic way to say these are duplicate programs.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Smith also criticizes Dr. Conrad's definition of \"unnecessary\"--as carrying a program title outside the list Dr. Conrad defines as \"core.\"   Cf. Conrad's Louisiana Curriculum Analysis.  In Dr. Smith's opinion, Dr. Conrad's definition of an \"unnecessary\" program would not agree with a college's own list of which of its offerings were not \"essential.\"   Similarly, Dr. Berdahl believes that Dr. Conrad \"takes a grossly over-simplified approach to defining unnecessary program duplication,\" partly because Dr. Conrad does not consider student need in defining necessary.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  In Dr. Smith's opinion, a finding of \"unnecessary duplication\" could be made only by examining a set of offerings in a particular setting, considering the educational mission of an institution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This evidence leaves room for different inferences:  we find that a question of fact remains whether unnecessary program duplication exists in Louisiana's colleges and universities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also detect fact issues regarding the practicability of eliminating program duplication.  Dr. Smith notes the reluctance of faculty to accept transfer or of faculty at a transferee university to receive transferring faculty happily.  He also asserts that a program cannot be moved without materially changing its substance, in part because of the interactions between the courses in a program with the content of other courses offered at the same school.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Smith believes that program transfer would damage the quality of the programs and of the university.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  The State adduced evidence that program transfers at two Georgia colleges resulted in a drop in enrollment at both schools and failed to achieve the expected transfer of students from one to the other.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  Dr. Cameron Fincher testified that in Georgia, \"what they thought to be the program included more than what was transferred.\"   Fincher Dep. at 79.  Besides courses in the major field, other courses have to be taken.  Id. at 79-80.  He concluded that after reciprocal program transfers from two institutions, \"the quality of both programs has been somewhat shaken because of the transfer.\"   Id. at 81.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Inasmuch as this testimony defines a dispute about the practicability of program transfer, it seems at first to raise a remedial rather than a liability issue.  (Program transfer was one of several suggested remedies for unnecessary program duplication, along with merger, cooperative programs, and program termination accompanied by establishing new programs.)   But we think this testimony also bears on the liability determination of the practicability of eliminating unnecessary program duplication in proximate institutions.  To ascertain the feasibility of eliminating or remediating a policy, one can scarcely ignore the feasibility of alternative or remedial measures.  The conflict in testimony about program transfers thus reveals a disputed issue regarding the practicability of eliminating duplicate programs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the educational justification for maintaining duplicate programs at proximate institutions, the district court found that program duplication was excessive, costly, and inefficient.  The State has not specifically pointed out evidence which raises a question of fact regarding the educational soundness of maintaining duplicate programs at proximate PBIs and PWIs.  Instead the State argues that the district court acknowledged a disputed issue regarding the educational justification for the continued existence of the proximate institutions in the following remark:  \"Among the problems [of merging proximate institutions] are merging student bodies of highly disparate academic backgrounds, potential loss of qualified faculty and administrators who were attracted to a school because of its academic characteristics and goals, and undermining black institutions such as Grambling and Southern with substantial alumni following.\"  718 F.Supp. at 507 (rejecting merger as a possible remedy).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Does this observation by the district court imply a disputed question whether some educational justification for continuing duplicate programs in proximate institutions may exist?   We think so, though our decision is made more difficult by the State's failure to point out the evidence that demonstrates a disputed issue.  Implicit in the court's remark is the suggestion that continuing duplicate programs at proximate institutions might advance the educational goals of classifying students by their level of preparedness and of retaining qualified faculty and administrators at the schools which originally attracted them.  A factfinder might infer that the advancement of these educational goals provides sound educational justification for continuing duplicate programs in side-by-side institutions.  Though we consider the issue to have been inadequately addressed by the parties, we discern an issue of fact regarding the soundness of educational justification for continuing duplicate programs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because of the disputed fact questions whether unnecessary program duplication in proximate institutions violated Fordice, the court improvidently rendered summary judgment on that basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Also, as noted previously, the open admissions policy was instituted after Louisiana's de jure segregation ended.  We think this fact inherently raises a genuine issue for trial because it permits an inference that the open admissions policy is not \"rooted in\" the State's prior de jure segregated system.  The question whether the open admissions policy meets the Fordice traceability requirement must be resolved (if challenged) on remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also find a fact issue whether an open admissions policy fosters segregation.  The district judge and the special master reached different conclusions about whether changing the open admissions policy to a tiered system with graduated admission requirements would affect desegregation efforts.  The special master found, \"[t]here is no obvious and necessary connection between organization and desegregation....  Thus how state universities are organized can be viewed as an educational matter not rising to constitutional levels.\"   The district court concluded, however, that open admissions is \"counter-productive ... in terms of ... integration.\"   1992 order at 15-16.  Though the burden of pointing out issues of fact generally rests with the non-moving party and the State has suggested no conflicting evidence on the point, we cannot help but find a fact issue because of the special master's and trial court's differing \"findings.\"   No party has suggested any issue of fact regarding educational justification for or the practicability of eliminating the open admissions policy, and we discern none.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We greatly respect the district court's diligence in attempting to resolve this protracted litigation expeditiously.  We also commend the trial judge for his obvious familiarity with the massive record in this case and his circumspection in attempting to frame remedial measures.  In such an old case, where the state's colleges and universities remain starkly racially identifiable, we remand for continued litigation with great reluctance.  But in reviewing the reinstatement of summary judgment, we have ascertained disputed material facts.  To the extent that genuine issues of fact remain on the liability issues noted above, the summary judgment on liability must be reversed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. DUE PROCESS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Southern Board and the State also argue that using evidence from the pre-Fordice remedial proceedings to determine liability under Fordice denied the State defendants due process.  The gist of this complaint is that the State Defendants had no reasonable opportunity to contest liability under the Fordice standards.  Because of our remand today the State defendants will have the opportunity to develop the record on the disputed Fordice issues and the due process violation, if any occurred, will be cured.VI. REMEDIAL ISSUES</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because of the existence of factual disputes on liability, the remedial order is vacated and we do not reach the State Defendants' final assigned errors relating to remedy, with the single exception of one which has been previously decided.  The Southern Board of Supervisors argues that a single district judge lacks authority to enjoin the enforcement of the state constitutional provision setting forth the four-board governing structure of Louisiana higher education, citing 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2281 (repealed 1976).  The statute provides that an injunction restraining the enforcement of a state statute on a ground of unconstitutionality should not be granted unless the application has been ... determined by a three-judge district court.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Though originally a three-judge district court ordered the single-board remedy in the 1989 remedial order, 718 F.Supp. at 515-16, the later modified remedial orders embracing a single-board system were single-judge matters.  After the three-judge panel's remedial order, the State and the Southern Board filed direct appeals in the Supreme Court.  On the United States Government's motion to dismiss on the ground that the three-judge court was not required, the Supreme Court dismissed the appeals for want of jurisdiction.  493 U.S. 1013, 110 S.Ct. 708, 107 L.Ed.2d 729 (1990).  This Court stated that the Supreme Court's dismissals were predicated on the implicit conclusion \"that the case in the district court was not properly a three-judge district court case\" under former Sec. 2281.  We agree with the interpretation of the earlier appellate panel that considered the matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reverse the summary adjudication of liability, vacate the remedial order, and remand for a determination of liability, and remedy if necessary, after resolution of any remaining factual disputes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Remedial order VACATED;  summary judgment on liability REVERSED;  REMANDED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The United States has since waived its constitutional claim.

Much of the criticism of both the multi-board system and the open admissions policies was that they foster program duplication and inefficiencies, and that their elimination would help resolve the problem of program duplication.  For example, the court found that the four-board system \"led to unnecessary ... program duplication\" and that to an extent program duplication \"results from the multi-board structure.\"  Id. at 1158 (quoting 718 F.Supp. at 508).   As for the open admissions policy, the court noted that this policy fails to organize students by academic ability, resulting in program inefficiencies and the necessity that each institution provide remedial programs.  Id. at 1158 n. 47 (quoting 718 F.Supp. at 510 n. 19)</p>\n        <p>We express no opinion whether a remedial order addressing an unlawful policy, if any is found on remand, might include a restructuring of the multi-board system or the open admissions policy if these are not independently found to be unlawful policies.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> The court found that the multi-board governing system has \"perpetuated\" and \"sustain[ed]\" a segregated higher education system.  718 F.Supp. at 505;  1992 order 811 F.Supp. at 1158 n. 47.   It also found that the organization of the institutions of higher education under four boards had \"little regard for logic or efficiency\" (1992 order 811 F.Supp. at 1158 n. 47);  and that the existence of four boards impairs the State's ability to enhance its historically black institutions (both by dissipating scarce resources and by leaving the State without an organizational structure with the power to make program decisions statewide or power to give desirable programs to the historically black institutions) (1992 order at 15 (quoting 718 F.Supp. at 508)).   After considering comparisons with alternative systems, the court concluded that the multi-board system could be eliminated in favor of a \"single-board solution,\" and by organizing the institutions under a \"mission assignment framework\" instead of under the framework of the four boards.  1992 order 811 F.Supp. at 1158 (quoting 718 F.Supp. at 508), at 1158 &amp; n. 47.

Because summary judgment was improperly granted, we vacate the remedial order, reverse the liability judgment, and remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the civil rights era Louisiana repealed its school segregation laws.  The United States sued Louisiana in 1974 alleging that the State was still maintaining a racially discriminatory system of higher education violating the Fourteenth Amendment<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000d.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1981 the court entered a consent decree under which Louisiana was to begin affirmative action and enhance its predominately black public institutions of higher education.  In December 1987 the United States moved for a hearing to determine Louisiana's compliance with this consent decree and to determine whether the State and the governing boards of its colleges and universities were operating its system of public higher education on a unitary basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment on the issue of liability, i.e., the question whether the State maintained an unlawfully segregated system of higher education.  The district court ruled for the United States, holding that the State had under the consent decree failed to dismantle its racially dual structure.  United States v. Louisiana, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2357965\"><a href=\"/opinion/2357965/united-states-v-state-of-la/\"><span class=\"volume\">692</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">642</span></a></span>, 653-57 (E.D.La.1988) (sometimes called the \"1988 liability order\").  Following lengthy hearings before a special master on the question of remedy, the district court directed the State to implement the special master's recommended remedial plan as modified.  United States v. Louisiana, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">718</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">499</span></span>, 515-21 (E.D.La.1989).  Primarily this 1989 remedial order required consolidation of the State's four higher education boards into a single board, classification of the institutions by selective admissions and separate mission statements, a comprehensive community college system, and consolidating measures such as program transfer.  Id. at 515-19.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the appeal and remand of the remedial order, this Court decided Ayers, which held that a race-neutral admissions policy satisfies a state's obligation to desegregate.  Ayers v.

Considering Ayers and Louisiana's open admissions, the district court then vacated its earlier orders and granted summary judgment in favor of the State Defendants.  United States v. Louisiana, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">751</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">606</span></span>, 608 (E.D.La.1990).  When Ayers was reversed, United States v. Fordice, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112782\"><a href=\"/opinion/112782/united-states-v-fordice/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">575</span></a></span> (1992), this Court vacated the new summary judgment and remanded for reconsideration in light of Fordice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court then ordered the parties to show cause why its 1988 liability order should not be reinstated and a revised remedial order should not be entered in light of Fordice.   After responses were filed, the district court reinstated the 1988 liability order and entered another revised remedial order (the \"1992 order\").  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">811</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1151</span></span>.   The State Defendants appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. JUSTICIABILITY OF LIABILITY</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a separate appeal, the Southern University Board of Supervisors complains that the district court lacked jurisdiction to abrogate the 1981 consent decree because the validity of the consent decree was not a justiciable case or controversy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Southern Board argues that the only dispute about the consent decree was whether the State had complied with it--not its validity or terms.  This is inaccurate.  Near the end of the term of the consent decree, when the United States moved for a determination of Louisiana's compliance with the consent decree, it also requested a hearing to determine \"whether defendants ... are operating the system of public higher education on a unitary basis\" and requested an order maintaining jurisdiction over the entire litigation.  The consent decree provided for the court's continuing jurisdiction \"to insure that the Louisiana system of public higher education is operated on a unitary basis in all respects.\"   The consent decree also provided that the Plaintiff could before December 31, 1987 request the court to determine whether Defendants were operating the system of public higher education on a unitary basis.  This is precisely what the United States did.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the motions for summary judgment were filed, the district court noted that the consent decree \"was directed more towards merely enhancing the State's black schools as black schools rather than towards 'convert[ing] its white colleges and black colleges to just colleges.' \"  692 F.Supp. at 658 (footnote omitted).  The court found a continuing constitutional violation, concluded that the consent decree had not dismantled the dual system, and that a more effective remedy was required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Southern Board's argument that the court lacked jurisdiction because it sua sponte took a question about which there was no case or controversy is without merit.  The parties could not agree on whether the State had dismantled its dual system.  By the terms of the consent decree, no determination of whether Defendants violated any law had been made.  The United States' motion put at issue the efficacy of the consent decree in achieving a unitary system.  The court retained jurisdiction to address this issue and properly reviewed the entire question whether the Defendants were maintaining an unconstitutional dual system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. THE END OF THE CONSENT DECREE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Southern Board next argues that the court's reason for invalidating the consent decree in 1988--the continued racial identifiability of the institutions--was erroneous in light of the 1992 decision in Fordice.   The Southern Board is vague on what relief it is requesting from this Court, but apparently it desires reinstatement of the consent decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Southern Board's argument centers on how Fordice changes a state's accountability for failure to obtain racially homogenized schools in the higher education context.  We agree that racial identifiability, while relevant under Fordice, does not define the standard for determining whether a state has dismantled its dual system (or whether a consent decree has been effective to achieve a unitary system).  As of 1992 Fordice provides the standard by which to determine whether the state is maintaining an unlawful dual system, and the United States is now entitled to another hearing on the question of the State's liability, as discussed next.  But the Fordice decision does not breathe any new life into the consent decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. FORDICE ISSUES</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The State first contends that the district court based its liability decision on nothing more than the racial identifiability of the institutions, even though Fordice established a stricter standard for holding a state liable for unlawful segregation.  The State argues that the 1988 liability order was based solely on racial identifiability of the schools and boards.  The Southern Board also argues that the court misinterpreted Fordice by presuming unlawful segregation exists if the schools are racially identifiable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>A. The Standard:  More than Racial Identifiability</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the State Defendants that under Fordice, \"[t]hat an institution is predominately white or black does not in itself make out a constitutional violation.\"  Fordice, --- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 2743.   Under Fordice liability is based on specific state policies or practices:  \"[A] State does not discharge its constitutional obligations [to dismantle its prior dual university system] until it eradicates policies and practices traceable to its prior de jure dual system that continue to foster segregation.\"  Id. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 2735.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p>If the State perpetuates policies and practices traceable to its prior system that continue to have segregative effects--whether by influencing student enrollment decisions or by fostering segregation in other facets of the university system--and such policies are without sound educational justification and can be practicably eliminated, the State has not satisfied its burden of proving that it has dismantled its prior system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 2737.   We read Fordice to require that each suspect state policy or practice be analyzed to determine whether it is traceable to the prior de jure system, whether it continues to foster segregation, whether it lacks sound educational justification, and whether its elimination is practicable.  This is the State's burden to show that it has dismantled its prior dual system at the liability stage of litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We read Fordice to also mandate inquiry into the soundness of the educational justification for challenged policies and the practicability of eliminating them in consideration of remedy once liability is found.  According to Fordice, \"the State may not leave in place policies rooted in its prior officially-segregated system that serve to maintain the racial identifiability of its universities if those policies can practicably be eliminated without eroding sound educational policies.\"  Id. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 2743 (emphasis added).  Fordice also directs that \"[i]f policies traceable to the de jure system are still in force and have discriminatory effects, those policies ... must be reformed to the extent practicable and consistent with sound educational practices.\"  Id. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 2736 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We interpret these directives as recognizing the need to consider the practicability and soundness of educational practices in determining remedies as well as in making an initial determination of liability.  We do not read Fordice as prohibiting a bifurcated determination of liability and remedy, although some matters may be pertinent to both aspects of the trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the State that the 1988 liability order was based on the undisputed fact of the persistent racial identifiability of Louisiana's public colleges and universities, despite the efforts under the consent decree.  692 F.Supp. at 644-46.   The reinstatement of the 1988 liability order in 1992, however, was based on more than the undisputed facts that were before the court in 1988 when it first found liability.  In 1992, the district court also considered the record created in the remedial hearings before the special master in 1989 and the remedial proceedings before the district court following the special master's report.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found, \"based on the entire record [ ]including the most recent submissions,\" 1) that the State \"continues to act through its policies and practices in a manner that promotes segregation ...;  2) those policies and practices are traceable to Louisiana's long history and endorsement of segregation;  and 3) Louisiana's policies and practices are without sound educational justification and can be practically eliminated.\"  1992 order 811 F.Supp. at 1159 (footnotes omitted).  This holding demonstrates that in its 1992 order the court reinstated the 1988 liability summary judgment based on more than the racial composition of the schools.  The court considered the requirements of Fordice in determining liability in 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Specific Analysis Required</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The State also challenges the summary judgment liability ruling on the ground that the court's findings<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> are too generalized to satisfy Fordice, because they do not specifically identify state policies and practices that extended the effects of past discrimination.  The district court recited these general findings only after adopting the findings made in the earlier proceedings.  1992 order 811 F.Supp. at 1159 (adopting by reference the court's \"findings of fact as set forth in its prior opinions and orders and reasons\");  see also id. at 1159 (parties overlooked court's \"findings relative to the issue of liability\");  id. at 1153 (refusing to regard the court's earlier findings as outdated).  The court stated, \"[W]hen the record in this case is viewed as a whole, the analytic framework and requisite factual inquiries now required as articulated in Fordice were made by this Court long before it had the benefit of the Supreme Court's guidance.\"  Id. at 1159.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assessing the 1992 order in the framework of the adopted earlier opinions, we perceive that the district court indeed considered individual policies and practices with sufficient specificity to satisfy Fordice, namely, Louisiana's open admissions policy, and program duplication in proximate institutions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  The court also considered the four-board governance of Louisiana's institutions of higher education.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its 1989 remedial order the court found that \"the racial identifiability of Louisiana's state universities is especially evident in the coexistence of predominantly black institutions (PBIs) and predominantly white institutions (PWIs) in close geographic proximity in four areas of the state.\"  718 F.Supp. at 504.   The court found that program duplication at proximate institutions has a \"stultifying effect on desegregation,\" and \"permits schools to cater to students of one race, thereby hindering desegregation goals.\"  Id. at 513.   In 1992 the court found that Louisiana has continued its dual system, \"perpetuated by duplicative programs, multiple boards, coexistence of PBIs and PWIs with similar programs existing in close proximity to each other.\"  1992 order 811 F.Supp. at 1157.   These findings sufficiently identify program duplication in proximate institutions as a policy that fosters segregation today.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also find Fordice 's \"traceability\" requirement implicit in the district court's analysis.  The Supreme Court has concluded that program duplication between a historically white college and a historically black college in Mississippi was part of that state's prior dual system:  \"the whole notice of 'separate but equal' required duplicative programs in two sets of schools--and ... the present unnecessary duplication is a continuation of that practice.\"  Fordice, --- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 2741.   When the proximate PBIs and PWIs in Louisiana were historically segregated by law, program duplication was intentional--to insure that the two sets of schools were \"separate but equal.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court also at least implicitly considered whether program duplication in proximate institutions lacks sound educational justification, in observing that program duplication is excessive, unnecessary, costly, and inefficient.  718 F.Supp. at 508, 513  Finally, the court concluded that program duplication could be practicably eliminated, through elimination of the multi-board structure that would enable program transfers and program elimination, and through tiering or classifying institutions by selective admissions standards and revised mission statements.  718 F.Supp. at 509-13.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That unnecessary program duplication in proximate PBIs and PWIs was considered by the district court to be an unlawful policy or practice is readily apparent from its findings.  Accordingly, with respect to this practice, we reject the challenge that the court rendered its liability judgment on findings that were too generalized.  The district court indeed analyzed with sufficient specificity under Fordice the State's continuing program duplication in proximate PBIs and PWIs as an unlawful practice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also criticized both the four-board governance and the open admissions policies of Louisiana's institutions of higher education as policies or practices which violate the Fordice standard.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Under Louisiana's governance system, a Board of Regents has overall authority, while three governing boards manage specific colleges and universities.  The remedial order disbands the four boards and orders a single board.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States has not challenged the four-board governing system as unlawful, but the court nevertheless found that the governance system violates the federal constitution.  718 F.Supp. at 505;  see also 1992 order 811 F.Supp. at 1158 (quoting its earlier findings regarding the multi-board structure as an example of the sufficiency of its findings to support a liability decision under Fordice ).   The Southern Board maintains that the constitutionality of the four-board system cannot be determined under Fordice, because the challenged four-board system is not a \"policy or practice\" but a state constitutional provision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree.  The Louisiana Constitution of 1974 created the four-board system, La.Const. art.  VIII, Secs. 5-7;  id. art.  XIV, Secs. 1-5 (transitional provisions);  and laws have been enacted to carry these provisions into effect.  E.g., La.Rev.Stat.Ann. Secs. 17:1453-1555, 1831-54, 3121-33, 3215-21, 3351 (West 1982 &amp; Supp.1993).  This court is not convinced that the Fordice analysis is applicable to determine whether the establishment of the four boards is unlawful.  Fordice addresses the \"surviving aspects of [the State's] prior dual system,\" Fordice, --- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 2738;  thus Fordice comes into play when the segregative laws have been repealed, but policies and practices traceable to the de jure dual system subsist.  The four-board system of governance created by the State constitution in 1974 is not such a surviving \"policy or practice\" within the meaning of Fordice.   Its constitutionality is determined under different principles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"[T]he invidious quality of a law claimed to be racially discriminatory must ultimately be traced to a racially discriminatory purpose.\"  Washington v.

This finding addresses the Fordice inquiry whether the state's open admissions policy fosters segregation.  As for educational justification, the court noted that the open admissions policy fails to meet the educational objective of producing graduates, and that the policy is inefficient in failing to organize students by academic ability.  Id.  The court found tiering the institutions by selective admission standards and classifying them by revised mission statements to be feasible alternatives to open admissions at every institution.

The question whether Louisiana's open admissions policy meets the Fordice traceability requirement must be resolved (if challenged) on remand.  \"[I]f challenged policies are not rooted in the prior dual system, the question becomes whether the fact of racial separation establishes a new violation of the Fourteenth Amendment under traditional principles.\"  Fordice, --- U.S. at ---- n. 6, 112 S.Ct. at 2737 n. 6.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, we find that the district court adequately applied Fordice to the State's practice of continuing program duplication in proximate institutions and to the State's open admissions policy, except with respect to the traceability of the open admissions policy.

The State and the Southern Board urge that reinstatement of summary judgment on liability was inappropriate because some Fordice issues remain genuinely disputed.  The district court relied on the special master's determinations of factual issues after the remedial hearings and reinstated the summary judgment based in part on those findings without holding another evidentiary hearing.  According to the United States, however, summary judgment on these findings is proper because the findings are based on undisputed evidence, largely the State's own evidence.  Yet the State Defendants insist that the court did not rely on undisputed facts, because the special master's findings were based on controverted evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Summary judgment is appropriate only if the record discloses \"that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"   Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).  Evidence adduced at a hearing may support a summary judgment when the testimony is uncontradicted and the factual basis for judgment admits no genuine controversy about material matters.

The Board of Supervisors' expert, Dr. Donald Smith, criticized as inaccurate Dr. Conrad's definition of \"duplication\"--as programs in two or more nearby institutions in the same program category or subprogram category of the HEGIS data.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Dr. Smith notes that the HEGIS categories provide very little information about the content of a program.  See also Dep. of Roy E. McTarnaghan of Apr. 21, 1981, filed Sep. 4, 1981, at 117 (\"[F]requently courses that ... are titled quite differently are much more the same than those that are titled the same.\").  In Dr. Robert Berdahl's opinion, whether a program offered at one institution in fact duplicates a program offered at another institution cannot be determined \"without doing a detailed onsight inspection the way accrediting teams do.  But just reading from the college catalog or reading a HEGIS number ... seems a terribly simplistic way to say these are duplicate programs.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Smith also criticizes Dr. Conrad's definition of \"unnecessary\"--as carrying a program title outside the list Dr. Conrad defines as \"core.\"   Cf. Conrad's Louisiana Curriculum Analysis.  In Dr. Smith's opinion, Dr. Conrad's definition of an \"unnecessary\" program would not agree with a college's own list of which of its offerings were not \"essential.\"   Similarly, Dr. Berdahl believes that Dr. Conrad \"takes a grossly over-simplified approach to defining unnecessary program duplication,\" partly because Dr. Conrad does not consider student need in defining necessary.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  In Dr. Smith's opinion, a finding of \"unnecessary duplication\" could be made only by examining a set of offerings in a particular setting, considering the educational mission of an institution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This evidence leaves room for different inferences:  we find that a question of fact remains whether unnecessary program duplication exists in Louisiana's colleges and universities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also detect fact issues regarding the practicability of eliminating program duplication.  Dr. Smith notes the reluctance of faculty to accept transfer or of faculty at a transferee university to receive transferring faculty happily.  He also asserts that a program cannot be moved without materially changing its substance, in part because of the interactions between the courses in a program with the content of other courses offered at the same school.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Smith believes that program transfer would damage the quality of the programs and of the university.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  The State adduced evidence that program transfers at two Georgia colleges resulted in a drop in enrollment at both schools and failed to achieve the expected transfer of students from one to the other.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  Dr. Cameron Fincher testified that in Georgia, \"what they thought to be the program included more than what was transferred.\"   Fincher Dep. at 79.  Besides courses in the major field, other courses have to be taken.  Id. at 79-80.  He concluded that after reciprocal program transfers from two institutions, \"the quality of both programs has been somewhat shaken because of the transfer.\"   Id. at 81.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Inasmuch as this testimony defines a dispute about the practicability of program transfer, it seems at first to raise a remedial rather than a liability issue.  (Program transfer was one of several suggested remedies for unnecessary program duplication, along with merger, cooperative programs, and program termination accompanied by establishing new programs.)   But we think this testimony also bears on the liability determination of the practicability of eliminating unnecessary program duplication in proximate institutions.  To ascertain the feasibility of eliminating or remediating a policy, one can scarcely ignore the feasibility of alternative or remedial measures.  The conflict in testimony about program transfers thus reveals a disputed issue regarding the practicability of eliminating duplicate programs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the educational justification for maintaining duplicate programs at proximate institutions, the district court found that program duplication was excessive, costly, and inefficient.  The State has not specifically pointed out evidence which raises a question of fact regarding the educational soundness of maintaining duplicate programs at proximate PBIs and PWIs.  Instead the State argues that the district court acknowledged a disputed issue regarding the educational justification for the continued existence of the proximate institutions in the following remark:  \"Among the problems [of merging proximate institutions] are merging student bodies of highly disparate academic backgrounds, potential loss of qualified faculty and administrators who were attracted to a school because of its academic characteristics and goals, and undermining black institutions such as Grambling and Southern with substantial alumni following.\"  718 F.Supp. at 507 (rejecting merger as a possible remedy).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Does this observation by the district court imply a disputed question whether some educational justification for continuing duplicate programs in proximate institutions may exist?   We think so, though our decision is made more difficult by the State's failure to point out the evidence that demonstrates a disputed issue.  Implicit in the court's remark is the suggestion that continuing duplicate programs at proximate institutions might advance the educational goals of classifying students by their level of preparedness and of retaining qualified faculty and administrators at the schools which originally attracted them.  A factfinder might infer that the advancement of these educational goals provides sound educational justification for continuing duplicate programs in side-by-side institutions.  Though we consider the issue to have been inadequately addressed by the parties, we discern an issue of fact regarding the soundness of educational justification for continuing duplicate programs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because of the disputed fact questions whether unnecessary program duplication in proximate institutions violated Fordice, the court improvidently rendered summary judgment on that basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Also, as noted previously, the open admissions policy was instituted after Louisiana's de jure segregation ended.  We think this fact inherently raises a genuine issue for trial because it permits an inference that the open admissions policy is not \"rooted in\" the State's prior de jure segregated system.  The question whether the open admissions policy meets the Fordice traceability requirement must be resolved (if challenged) on remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also find a fact issue whether an open admissions policy fosters segregation.  The district judge and the special master reached different conclusions about whether changing the open admissions policy to a tiered system with graduated admission requirements would affect desegregation efforts.  The special master found, \"[t]here is no obvious and necessary connection between organization and desegregation....  Thus how state universities are organized can be viewed as an educational matter not rising to constitutional levels.\"   The district court concluded, however, that open admissions is \"counter-productive ... in terms of ... integration.\"   1992 order at 15-16.  Though the burden of pointing out issues of fact generally rests with the non-moving party and the State has suggested no conflicting evidence on the point, we cannot help but find a fact issue because of the special master's and trial court's differing \"findings.\"   No party has suggested any issue of fact regarding educational justification for or the practicability of eliminating the open admissions policy, and we discern none.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We greatly respect the district court's diligence in attempting to resolve this protracted litigation expeditiously.  We also commend the trial judge for his obvious familiarity with the massive record in this case and his circumspection in attempting to frame remedial measures.  In such an old case, where the state's colleges and universities remain starkly racially identifiable, we remand for continued litigation with great reluctance.  But in reviewing the reinstatement of summary judgment, we have ascertained disputed material facts.  To the extent that genuine issues of fact remain on the liability issues noted above, the summary judgment on liability must be reversed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. DUE PROCESS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Southern Board and the State also argue that using evidence from the pre-Fordice remedial proceedings to determine liability under Fordice denied the State defendants due process.  The gist of this complaint is that the State Defendants had no reasonable opportunity to contest liability under the Fordice standards.  Because of our remand today the State defendants will have the opportunity to develop the record on the disputed Fordice issues and the due process violation, if any occurred, will be cured.VI. REMEDIAL ISSUES</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because of the existence of factual disputes on liability, the remedial order is vacated and we do not reach the State Defendants' final assigned errors relating to remedy, with the single exception of one which has been previously decided.  The Southern Board of Supervisors argues that a single district judge lacks authority to enjoin the enforcement of the state constitutional provision setting forth the four-board governing structure of Louisiana higher education, citing 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2281 (repealed 1976).  The statute provides that an injunction restraining the enforcement of a state statute on a ground of unconstitutionality should not be granted unless the application has been ... determined by a three-judge district court.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Though originally a three-judge district court ordered the single-board remedy in the 1989 remedial order, 718 F.Supp. at 515-16, the later modified remedial orders embracing a single-board system were single-judge matters.  After the three-judge panel's remedial order, the State and the Southern Board filed direct appeals in the Supreme Court.  On the United States Government's motion to dismiss on the ground that the three-judge court was not required, the Supreme Court dismissed the appeals for want of jurisdiction.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">493</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1013</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">729</span></span> (1990).  This Court stated that the Supreme Court's dismissals were predicated on the implicit conclusion \"that the case in the district court was not properly a three-judge district court case\" under former Sec. 2281.  We agree with the interpretation of the earlier appellate panel that considered the matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reverse the summary adjudication of liability, vacate the remedial order, and remand for a determination of liability, and remedy if necessary, after resolution of any remaining factual disputes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Remedial order VACATED;  summary judgment on liability REVERSED;  REMANDED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The United States has since waived its constitutional claim.

Much of the criticism of both the multi-board system and the open admissions policies was that they foster program duplication and inefficiencies, and that their elimination would help resolve the problem of program duplication.  For example, the court found that the four-board system \"led to unnecessary ... program duplication\" and that to an extent program duplication \"results from the multi-board structure.\"  Id. at 1158 (quoting 718 F.Supp. at 508).   As for the open admissions policy, the court noted that this policy fails to organize students by academic ability, resulting in program inefficiencies and the necessity that each institution provide remedial programs.

It also found that the organization of the institutions of higher education under four boards had \"little regard for logic or efficiency\" (1992 order 811 F.Supp. at 1158 n. 47);  and that the existence of four boards impairs the State's ability to enhance its historically black institutions (both by dissipating scarce resources and by leaving the State without an organizational structure with the power to make program decisions statewide or power to give desirable programs to the historically black institutions) (1992 order at 15 (quoting 718 F.Supp. at 508)).   After considering comparisons with alternative systems, the court concluded that the multi-board system could be eliminated in favor of a \"single-board solution,\" and by organizing the institutions under a \"mission assignment framework\" instead of under the framework of the four boards.  1992 order 811 F.Supp. at 1158 (quoting 718 F.Supp. at 508), at 1158 &amp; n. 47.
