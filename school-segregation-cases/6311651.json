Code, ยง 12900 et seq.), and a cause of action for violation of the\n\nInformation Practices Act (IPA; Civ. Code, ยง 1798 et seq.1) and additionally alleged\n\ncauses of action against Seals only for intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED)\n\nand negligent infliction of emotional distress (NIED). Following trial, the jury returned\n\nverdicts in favor of Defendants on the FEHA causes of action, against Defendants on the\n\nIPA cause of action, and against Seals on the IIED and NIED causes of action. The jury\n\nawarded Hurley $19,200 for past economic damages and $19,200 for past noneconomic\n\nlosses against both Defendants, and $28,800 in punitive damages against Seals only. The\n\ncourt denied Defendants' motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV). On\n\nappeal, Hurley contends the trial court erred by excluding evidence that was relevant to\n\nher FEHA causes of action.\n\n\n\n\n1      All further statutory references are to the Civil Code unless otherwise specified.\n                                              2\n\f       DPR and Seals filed appeals challenging the judgment against them on the IPA\n\ncause of action and the trial court's denial of their JNOV motions. In its appeal, DPR\n\ncontends: (1) there is insufficient evidence to support the finding it violated the IPA; and\n\n(2) the litigation privilege under section 47, subdivision (b), barred the IPA cause of\n\naction against it. In her appeal, Seals contends: (1) there is insufficient evidence to\n\nsupport the finding she violated the IPA; (2) the litigation privilege barred the IPA cause\n\nof action against her; (3) the IPA cause of action was alleged under, and the jury was\n\ninstructed on, a statute (i.e., ยง 1798.45) that was inapplicable to her; (4) there is\n\ninsufficient evidence to support the findings against her on the IIED and NIED causes of\n\naction; (5) the workers' compensation exclusivity doctrine barred the IIED and NIED\n\ncauses of action against her; and (6) the punitive damages award against her must be\n\nreversed for, inter alia, instructional error and insufficiency of the evidence to support it.\n\n       Based on our reasoning below, we affirm the judgment, except for the award of\n\neconomic damages against DPR, and modify the judgment accordingly.\n\n                   FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n       In December 2009, Hurley was hired by Seals as a staff services analyst (SSA) for\n\nDPR's Ocotillo Wells Off-Highway Motor Vehicle Recreation District (OWD). Seals\n\nwas Hurley's direct supervisor from the date of her hiring until she (Hurley) went on\n\nmedical leave on September 28, 2011. Kathy Dolinar, OWD's district superintendent,\n\nwas Seals's supervisor.\n\n       Seals socialized with her staff during and after work hours. She asked overly\n\npersonal questions of OWD employees and gave them unsolicited personal advice. Seals\n\n                                               3\n\fand other employees often discussed sex and sexual orientation. Seals expressed\n\nfrustration that Hurley did not share personal information with her. Seals was also\n\nknown to be a micromanager.\n\n       In January 2011, Hurley met with Seals regarding the addition of her domestic\n\npartner as a beneficiary of her health insurance. On or about September 27, 2011, Seals,\n\nwhile in her office, discussed with Charles Rennie, a DPR nonsupervisory employee,\n\nhow she might more effectively supervise Hurley. During that discussion, Seals\n\ndisclosed to Rennie information from Hurley's personnel file that she had failed her\n\nprobation in a prior job. At the time of the discussion, Hurley was standing outside of\n\nSeals's office, heard Seals discussing her personnel file with Rennie, and saw her\n\npersonnel file open on Seals's desk. Hurley became sick and threw up. She then went to\n\nher office, wrote an email to Dolinar about the incident, and told Seals she was leaving\n\nwork. Hurley went on medical leave the following day, September 28, and never\n\nreturned to work at OWD.2\n\n       In October 2011, Hurley filed a formal discrimination complaint with DPR's\n\nHuman Rights Office (HRO), alleging discrimination, harassment, and retaliation. In\n\nNovember or December, HRO began its investigation of Hurley's complaint. During the\n\ncourse of its investigation, HRO interviewed many employees. In March 2012, Seals was\n\nplaced on administrative leave for one month, which leave was twice extended for\n\n\n\n\n2     Hurley remained on leave until August 2012, when she accepted an SSA position\nat DPR's Monterey location.\n                                            4\n\fadditional one month periods. While on administrative leave, Seals asked Dolinar to\n\ndeliver to her home her (Seals's) supervisory drop file that she had maintained for Hurley\n\nso that she (Seals) could review it in preparation for her upcoming HRO interview\n\nregarding Hurley's complaint. Dolinar agreed and delivered the drop file to Seals at her\n\nhome.\n\n        HRO completed its investigation of Hurley's complaint in May 2012 and informed\n\nHurley and Seals of its determinations. Seals went on medical leave in June and, except\n\nfor a short period in August (during which she worked at DPR's Sacramento office),\n\nremained on medical leave thereafter. In late December, DPR notified Seals that her\n\nemployment was going to be terminated. In January 2013, Seals retired in lieu of\n\ntermination, but never returned the supervisory drop file to DPR.\n\n        In August 2012, Hurley accepted an SSA position at DPR's Monterey location.\n\nOn October 17, 2012, Hurley filed a complaint, alleging causes of action against both\n\nDPR and Seals for: (1) harassment based on sex and sexual orientation in violation of\n\nFEHA; (2) retaliation in violation of FEHA; (3) IIED; and (4) NIED. It also alleged\n\ncauses of action against DPR for: (1) failure to prevent harassment based on sex and\n\nsexual orientation in violation of FEHA; (2) employment discrimination based on sex and\n\nsexual orientation in violation of FEHA; (3) failure to remedy harassment in violation of\n\nFEHA; and (4) negligent hiring, retention, and supervision. On April 29 and 30, 2013,\n\nduring the course of discovery in this case, Seals's counsel delivered to Hurley over 9,000\n\npages of documents, including the supervisory drop file that Seals had retained after her\n\nretirement and given to her (Seals's) counsel. On or about December 20, 2013, Hurley\n\n                                             5\n\ffiled a motion for leave to file a first amended complaint, which would add causes of\n\naction against Defendants for: (1) invasion of constitutional right to privacy; (2) invasion\n\nof privacy by public disclosure; (3) breach of medical confidentiality; and (4) violation of\n\nthe IPA. On that date, the trial court granted Hurley's motion for leave and her first\n\namended complaint was filed. The court subsequently granted in part DPR's motion for\n\nsummary adjudication and dismissed the causes of action against DPR for IIED, NIED,\n\nand negligent hiring, retention, and supervision. The court denied Seals's motion for\n\nsummary adjudication on the four privacy causes of action.\n\n       During a four-week trial, 26 witnesses testified, including Hurley, Seals, and\n\nDolinar, and 71 exhibits were admitted into evidence. The jury returned verdicts in favor\n\nof Defendants on the FEHA causes of action, against Defendants on the IPA cause of\n\naction, and against Seals on the IIED and NIED causes of action. The jury awarded\n\nHurley $19,200 for past economic damages and $19,200 for past noneconomic losses\n\nagainst both Defendants and $28,800 in punitive damages against Seals only. On\n\nDecember 1, 2015, the trial court entered judgment on the jury verdict. On February 5,\n\n2016, the court denied Defendants' JNOV motions.\n\n       Hurley timely filed a notice of appeal. DPR and Seals each filed a timely notice of\n\nappeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                             6\n\f                                      DISCUSSION\n\n                                   HURLEY'S APPEAL\n\n                                              I\n\n                                  Exclusion of Evidence\n\n       Hurley contends the trial court erred by excluding certain evidence that was\n\nrelevant to her FEHA causes of action and therefore the judgment in favor of Defendants\n\non those causes of action must be reversed.\n\n       A. Admissibility of evidence; standard of review.\n\n       \"Except as otherwise provided by statute, all relevant evidence is admissible.\"\n\n(Evid. Code, ยง 351.) \"Relevant evidence\" is \"evidence, including evidence relevant to\n\nthe credibility of a witness or hearsay declarant, having any tendency in reason to prove\n\nor disprove any disputed fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action.\"\n\n(Evid. Code, ยง 210.) A trial court has broad discretion in determining the relevance of\n\nevidence, but it lacks discretion to admit irrelevant evidence. (People v. Cowan (2010)\n\n50 Cal.4th 401, 482.) An appellate court \"examines for abuse of discretion a decision on\n\nadmissibility that turns on the relevance of the evidence in question. [Citations.]\"\n\n(People v. Waidla (2000) 22 Cal.4th 690, 717-718.) Furthermore, Evidence Code section\n\n352 provides a trial court with discretion to exclude relevant evidence in certain\n\ncircumstances, stating:\n\n          \"The court in its discretion may exclude evidence if its probative\n          value is substantially outweighed by the probability that its\n          admission will (a) necessitate undue consumption of time or (b)\n          create substantial danger of undue prejudice, of confusing the issues,\n          or of misleading the jury.\"\n\n                                              7\n\f\"An exercise of discretion under Evidence Code section 352 will be disturbed on appeal\n\nonly if the trial court exercised it in an arbitrary, capricious, or patently absurd manner\n\nresulting in a manifest miscarriage of justice.\" (Boeken v. Philip Morris, Inc. (2005) 127\n\nCal.App.4th 1640, 1685.) Alternatively stated, \"[a] trial court's exercise of discretion in\n\nadmitting or excluding evidence is reviewable for abuse [citation] and will not be\n\ndisturbed except on a showing the trial court exercised its discretion in an arbitrary,\n\ncapricious, or patently absurd manner that resulted in a manifest miscarriage of justice.\"\n\n(People v. Rodriguez (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1, 9-10.)\n\n       To obtain reversal of a judgment based on evidentiary error, the appellant must\n\nshow that error was prejudicial. (Cal. Const., art. VI, ยง 13; Evid. Code, ยง 354.) Evidence\n\nCode section 354 provides in part: \"A verdict or finding shall not be set aside, nor shall\n\nthe judgment or decision based thereon be reversed, by reason of the erroneous exclusion\n\nof evidence unless the court which passes upon the effect of the error or errors is of the\n\nopinion that the error or errors complained of resulted in a miscarriage of justice . . . .\"\n\n\"Claims of evidentiary error under California law are reviewed for prejudice applying the\n\n'miscarriage of justice' or 'reasonably probable' harmless error standard of People v.\n\nWatson (1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836, 299 P.2d 243, that is embodied in article VI, section\n\n13 of the California Constitution. Under the Watson harmless error standard, it is the\n\nburden of appellants to show that it is reasonably probable that they would have received\n\na more favorable result at trial had the error not occurred. [Citations.]\" (Christ v.\n\n\n\n\n                                               8\n\fSchwartz (2016) 2 Cal.App.5th 440, 447 (Schwartz).) Article VI, section 13 of the\n\nCalifornia Constitution provides:\n\n           \"No judgment shall be set aside, or new trial granted, in any cause,\n           on the ground . . . of the improper admission or rejection of\n           evidence . . . , unless, after an examination of the entire cause,\n           including the evidence, the court shall be of the opinion that the error\n           complained of has resulted in a miscarriage of justice.\"\n\nLikewise, Code of Civil Procedure section 475 provides in part: \"No judgment, decision,\n\nor decree shall be reversed or affected by reason of any error, ruling, instruction, or\n\ndefect, unless it shall appear from the record that such error, ruling, instruction, or defect\n\nwas prejudicial, and also that by reason of such error, ruling, instruction, or defect, the\n\nsaid party complaining or appealing sustained and suffered substantial injury, and that a\n\ndifferent result would have been probable if such error, ruling, instruction, or defect had\n\nnot occurred or existed. There shall be no presumption that error is prejudicial, or that\n\ninjury was done if error is shown.\" A miscarriage of justice will be declared by an\n\nappellate court only if, after examining all of the evidence, it is of the opinion it is\n\nreasonably probable the appellant would have obtained a more favorable result had the\n\ntrial court not erred. (Cassim v. Allstate Ins. Co. (2004) 33 Cal.4th 780, 800 (Cassim).)\n\n       B. Appellant's burden on appeal.\n\n       A trial court's judgment or order is presumed to be correct. In Denham v. Superior\n\nCourt (1970) 2 Cal.3d 557 (Denham), the court stated:\n\n           \"[I]t is settled that: 'A judgment or order of the lower court is\n           presumed correct. All intendments and presumptions are indulged\n           to support it on matters as to which the record is silent, and error\n           must be affirmatively shown [by the appellant]. This is not only a\n           general principle of appellate practice but an ingredient of the\n\n                                               9\n\f            constitutional doctrine of reversible error.' [Citations.]\" (Id. at p.\n            564.)\n\n\"The burden of affirmatively demonstrating error is on the appellant.\" (Fundamental\n\nInvestment etc. Realty Fund v. Gradow (1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 966, 971 (Gradow).) The\n\nappellant has the additional burden on appeal of affirmatively demonstrating prejudice as\n\na result of an asserted error by a trial court. (Pool v. City of Oakland (1986) 42 Cal.3d\n\n1051, 1069 (Pool).) Therefore, an appellant has a dual burden: (1) to show error; and (2)\n\nto show that error was prejudicial and requires reversal of the judgment. (Gould v.\n\nCorinthian Colleges, Inc. (2011) 192 Cal.App.4th 1176, 1181 (Gould); In re Marriage of\n\nBehrens (1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 562, 575 (Behrens); Eisenberg et al., Cal. Practice\n\nGuide: Civil Appeals and Writs (The Rutter Group 2017) ยถ 8:291, p. 8-207 [\"The\n\n'prejudicial error' rule effectively imposes a dual burden on appellants: They must first\n\nprove error, and then must show the error was 'prejudicial.' [ยถ] . . . It may be necessary to\n\ndevote as much of appellant's opening brief to the prejudice issue as to establishing the\n\nerror itself.\"])\n\n        Furthermore, \"[a]n appellant must provide an argument and legal authority to\n\nsupport his contentions. This burden requires more than a mere assertion that the\n\njudgment is wrong. 'Issues do not have a life of their own: If they are not raised or\n\nsupported by argument or citation to authority, [they are] . . . waived.' [Citation.] It is\n\nnot our place to construct theories or arguments to undermine the judgment and defeat the\n\npresumption of correctness. When an appellant fails to raise a point, or asserts it but fails\n\nto support it with reasoned argument and citations to authority, we treat the point as\n\n\n                                               10\n\fwaived. [Citation.]\" (Benach v. County of Los Angeles (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 836, 852\n\n(Benach).)\n\n       C. Waiver.\n\n       Hurley asserts the trial court erred by excluding certain testimony and exhibits that\n\nwere relevant to her FEHA discrimination, harassment, retaliation, and failure to prevent\n\ndiscrimination, harassment, and retaliation causes of action. In her appellant's opening\n\nbrief, Hurley sets forth a virtual \"laundry list\" of certain evidence that was purportedly\n\nwrongly excluded by the court, which list consists of over 120 items of testimony and\n\nexhibits that she argues should have been admitted. In general, she argues those items of\n\nevidence were relevant to her FEHA claims: (1) as \"me too\" evidence under Pantoja v.\n\nAnton (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 87 (Pantoja) and related cases;3 (2) to prove Defendants'\n\nintent or another fact other than character or disposition (Evid. Code, ยง 1101, subd. (b));\n\nand/or (3) to impeach the credibility of Defendants' witnesses (id., subd. (c)). She argues\n\nthe court, in general, abused its discretion under Evidence Code section 352 by excluding\n\nthose items of evidence.\n\n       Importantly, Hurley also argues, in a conclusory manner, that the trial court's\n\nerrors in excluding those items of evidence constituted prejudicial error that requires\n\nreversal of the verdicts against her on the FEHA causes of action. In particular, in her\n\nopening brief, she argues: (1) \"the trial court abused its discretion in a series of\n\n\n\n3     \"Me too\" evidence presumably refers to evidence of similar conduct by\nDefendants involving employees other than Hurley. (Cf. Pantoja, supra, 198\nCal.App.4th at pp. 92, 109-110.)\n                                              11\n\fevidentiary rulings, which taken either individually or as a whole, clearly prejudiced\n\nAppellant, resulting in a miscarriage of justice;\" (2) \"[t]hese rulings taken together and\n\nseparately are prejudicial error;\" (3) \"[t]he trial court refused to allow testimony that\n\ndemonstrated [Defendants'] intent and motive to discriminate and harass [Hurley] under\n\n[Evidence] Code [section] 1101[, subdivisions (b) and (c)], requiring reversal as\n\nprejudicial error;\" (4) \"the trial court's exclusion of this evidence was prejudicial error;\"\n\n(5) \"[t]he superior court's exclusion of impeachment evidence was therefore reversible\n\nerror;\" (6) \"[t]he trial court's exclusion of [evidence of Hurley's] protected activities, the\n\ntiming of her protected activities and the response of [Defendants] to [Hurley's] protected\n\nactivities is at the heart of [Hurley's] retaliation case and such exclusion was prejudicial\n\nerror;\" and (7) \"[t]he trial court's exclusion of this testimony is manifest error, requiring\n\nretrial.\" In her reply brief, Hurley argues that the exclusion of her relevant evidence,\n\n\"when taken as a whole, along with the other testimony discussed herein, demonstrates\n\nthat it is reasonably probable that a more favorable result would have been reached\" had\n\nthat evidence been admitted. By so arguing only in a conclusory manner, Hurley wholly\n\nomits any substantive analysis or discussion of how the evidence that was purportedly\n\nwrongly excluded by the trial court probably would have affected the jury's verdicts on\n\nher FEHA causes of action had that evidence been admitted. In particular, she wholly\n\nomits any fair summarization of the evidence that was admitted at trial so that we could\n\nthen consider the question of whether it is reasonably probable she would have obtained a\n\nmore favorable result at trial had the court admitted the evidence that she asserts was\n\nwrongly excluded. (Cal. Const., art. VI, ยง 13; Evid. Code, ยง 354; Code Civ. Proc., ยง 475;\n\n                                              12\n\fCassim, supra, 33 Cal.4th at p. 800; Schwartz, supra, 2 Cal.App.5th at p. 447; Watson,\n\nsupra, 46 Cal.2d at p. 836.) Because Hurley has not presented any substantive legal\n\nanalysis or argument showing that the evidentiary errors of which she complains were\n\nprejudicial (i.e., the errors caused a miscarriage of justice or it is reasonably probable she\n\nwould have obtained a more favorable result absent the errors), we conclude she has\n\nwaived her contention on appeal that the trial court erred by excluding the items of\n\nevidence that she asserts were wrongly excluded. (Cf. Overhill Farms, Inc. v. Lopez\n\n(2010) 190 Cal.App.4th 1248, 1271 [appellant waived contention that trial court\n\nerroneously excluded evidence by failing to make any effort to show purported error was\n\nprejudicial]; Benach, supra, 149 Cal.App.4th at p. 852; Shaw v. County of Santa Cruz\n\n(2008) 170 Cal.App.4th 229, 282 [appellants \"fail[ed] to demonstrate how any claim of\n\nerror in the trial court's exclusion of evidence would have made any difference in the\n\noutcome\"].) Alternatively stated, by merely asserting the trial court's evidentiary errors\n\nwere prejudicial without presenting any substantive argument attempting to show how\n\nthose errors were prejudicial, Hurley waived her contention on appeal that the court erred\n\nby excluding the items of evidence and therefore we need not discuss the merits of that\n\ncontention. (Overhill Farms, at p. 1271; Shaw, at p. 282; People v. Ham (1970) 7\n\nCal.App.3d 768, 783 (Ham); Jones v. Superior Court (1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 92, 99\n\n(Jones).)\n\n       Even if Hurley did not waive her contention on appeal that the trial court erred by\n\nexcluding certain evidence, we nevertheless would conclude she has not carried her\n\nburden on appeal to show that the evidentiary errors of which she complains were\n\n                                              13\n\fprejudicial. She has not shown the purported evidentiary errors caused a miscarriage of\n\njustice (i.e., it is reasonably probable that she would have obtained a more favorable\n\nresult had the court not so erred). (Cal. Const., art. VI, ยง 13; Evid. Code, ยง 354; Code\n\nCiv. Proc., ยง 475; Cassim, supra, 33 Cal.4th at p. 800; Schwartz, supra, 2 Cal.App.5th at\n\np. 447; Watson, supra, 46 Cal.2d at p. 836.) As discussed ante, an appellant has two\n\nburdens on appeal: (1) to show error; and (2) to show that error was prejudicial. Hurley\n\ncannot carry her dual burdens on appeal by showing only error without additionally\n\nshowing that error was prejudicial. (Pool, supra, 42 Cal.3d at p. 1069; Gould, supra, 192\n\nCal.App.4th at p. 1181; Behrens, supra, 137 Cal.App.3d at p. 575; Eisenberg et al., Cal.\n\nPractice Guide: Civil Appeals and Writs, supra, at ยถ 8:291, p. 8-207.) Because Hurley\n\nhas made no attempt to show the evidentiary errors of which she complains were\n\nprejudicial, she has not carried her burden on appeal to show those errors were prejudicial\n\nand require reversal of the verdicts against her on the FEHA causes of action.4\n\n\n\n4       To the extent Hurley asserts the purported evidentiary errors are reversible per se,\nwe reject that assertion. The California Constitution, pertinent statutes, and long-standing\ncase law all require prejudicial error (i.e., a miscarriage of justice or showing that it is\nreasonably probable that the appellant would have obtained a more favorable result had\nthe trial court not so erred) before a judgment may be reversed based on evidentiary error.\n(Cal. Const., art. VI, ยง 13; Evid. Code, ยง 354; Code Civ. Proc., ยง 475; Cassim, supra, 33\nCal.4th at p. 800; Schwartz, supra, 2 Cal.App.5th at p. 447; Watson, supra, 46 Cal.2d at\np. 836.) Although Hurley cites Pantoja, supra, 198 Cal.App.4th 87 and Johnson v.\nUnited Cerebral Palsy/Spastic Children's Foundation (2009) 173 Cal.App.4th 740 as\nsupport for her argument that the trial court's evidentiary errors in this case were\nnecessarily prejudicial and require reversal of the FEHA verdicts against her, neither of\nthose cases hold that evidentiary error by exclusion of \"me too\" evidence or otherwise is\nreversible per se error. Rather, Pantoja implicitly applied the Watson standard for\nprejudicial error by discussing the evidence in that case and concluding: \"There is a\nreasonable probability that this [excluded] evidence of Anton's gender bias, which\n                                            14\n\fAccordingly, we affirm the verdicts in favor of Defendants on the FEHA causes of\n\naction.5\n\n                                 DEFENDANTS' APPEALS\n\n                                              II\n\n                     Substantial Evidence to Support the IPA Verdicts\n\n       Defendants contend the trial court erred by denying their JNOV motions because\n\nthere is insufficient evidence to support the jury's verdicts finding them liable for\n\nviolation of the IPA.\n\n       A. The IPA generally.\n\n       Enacted in 1977, the IPA generally limits the right of governmental agencies to\n\ndisclose personal information about an individual and imposes liability on agencies and\n\nindividuals for improperly disclosing personal information maintained by agencies.\n\n(ยงยง 1798.1, subd. (c), 1798.24, 1798.45, 1798.53; Bates v. Franchise Tax Bd. (2004) 124\n\n\n\n\ncorroborated Pantoja's other evidence of Anton's gender bias, would have tipped the\nbalance in a credibility contest like this case.\" (Pantoja, at p. 119, fn. omitted.) Johnson\ninvolved an appeal from a summary judgment and therefore did not address the question\nof the applicable standard of prejudice for evidentiary error at trial. (Johnson, at pp. 744-\n745, 768.) Therefore, Hurley does not show the trial court's purported evidentiary errors\nwere reversible per se.\n\n5      Even if we were to address the merits of Hurley's assertion that the trial court erred\nby excluding her listed evidence, based on our review of the record we strongly doubt\nthat she carried her burden on appeal to show the court abused its discretion under\nEvidence Code section 352 or otherwise by excluding any of those items of evidence,\nmuch less, as discussed above, that any such purported errors were prejudicial. (Denham,\nsupra, 2 Cal.3d at p. 564; Gradow, supra, 28 Cal.App.4th at p. 971; Pool, supra, 42\nCal.3d at p. 1069; Gould, supra, 192 Cal.App.4th at p. 1181.)\n                                             15\n\fCal.App.4th 367, 373; Jennifer M. v. Redwood Women's Health Center (2001) 88\n\nCal.App.4th 81, 87-88.) Importantly for this appeal, the IPA defines \"personal\n\ninformation\" as \"any information that is maintained by an agency that identifies or\n\ndescribes an individual, including, but not limited to, his or her name, social security\n\nnumber, physical description, home address, home telephone number, education,\n\nfinancial matters, and medical or employment history. It includes statements made by, or\n\nattributed to, the individual.\" (ยง 1798.3, subd. (a).) The IPA defines a \"record\" as \"any\n\nfile or grouping of information about an individual that is maintained by an agency by\n\nreference to an identifying particular such as the individual's name, photograph, finger or\n\nvoice print, or a number or symbol assigned to the individual.\" (ยง 1798.3, subd. (g).) It\n\ndefines \"disclose\" as \"to disclose, release, transfer, disseminate, or otherwise\n\ncommunicate all or any part of any record orally, in writing, or by electronic or any other\n\nmeans to any person or entity.\" (ยง 1798.3, subd. (c).)\n\n       Section 1798.24 limits disclosures of personal information maintained by an\n\nagency to certain persons and certain circumstances, stating in part:\n\n          \"An agency shall not disclose any personal information in a manner\n          that would link the information disclosed to the individual to whom\n          it pertains unless the information is disclosed, as follows: [ยถ] . . . [ยถ]\n\n          \"(d) To those officers, employees, attorneys, agents, or volunteers of\n          the agency that has custody of the information if the disclosure is\n          relevant and necessary in the ordinary course of the performance of\n          their official duties and is related to the purpose for which the\n          information was acquired.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                              16\n\fThe IPA also requires agencies to properly maintain records containing personal\n\ninformation.6 (ยง 1798.21.) If an agency violates its duties under the IPA, it may be\n\nsubject to liability for damages suffered by an individual. (ยง 1798.45.) Section 1798.45\n\nprovides in part:\n\n          \"An individual may bring a civil action against an agency whenever\n          such agency does any of the following: [ยถ] . . .\n\n          \"(b) Fails to maintain any record concerning any individual with\n          such accuracy, relevancy, timeliness, and completeness as is\n          necessary to assure fairness in any determination relating to the\n          qualifications, character, rights, opportunities of, or benefits to the\n          individual that may be made on the basis of such record, if, as a\n          proximate result of such failure, a determination is made which is\n          adverse to the individual.\n\n          \"(c) Fails to comply with any other provision of this chapter [e.g.,\n          ยง 1798.24], or any rule promulgated thereunder, in such a way as to\n          have an adverse effect on an individual.\" (Italics added.)\n\nLikewise, an individual may also be subject to liability for violation of the IPA.\n\n(ยง 1798.53.) Section 1798.53 provides in part: \"Any person, other than an employee of\n\nthe state or of a local government agency acting solely in his or her official capacity, who\n\nintentionally discloses information, not otherwise public, which they know or should\n\nreasonably know was obtained from personal information maintained by a state\n\n\n\n\n6       Section 1798.21 provides: \"Each agency shall establish appropriate and\nreasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to ensure compliance with\nthe provisions of this chapter, to ensure the security and confidentiality of records, and to\nprotect against anticipated threats or hazards to their security or integrity which could\nresult in any injury.\"\n                                             17\n\fagency . . . shall be subject to a civil action, for invasion of privacy, by the individual to\n\nwhom the information pertains.\"\n\n       B. Defendants' JNOV motions and trial court's order.\n\n       After the jury returned verdicts finding them liable on Hurley's cause of action for\n\nviolation of the IPA, Defendants filed JNOV motions, arguing, inter alia, that there was\n\ninsufficient evidence to support findings that they violated the IPA. DPR argued there\n\nwas insufficient evidence to support findings that it improperly maintained or disclosed\n\nany records containing Hurley's personal information and that she suffered an adverse\n\neffect from its alleged violation of the IPA. In particular, it argued there was insufficient\n\nevidence that the supervisory drop file delivered by Dolinar to Seals contained any\n\npersonal information. It also argued the evidence clearly showed that the drop file was\n\nproperly disclosed to Seals as relevant and necessary in the ordinary course of the\n\nperformance of her supervisory duties. Finally, it argued Hurley did not present\n\nsubstantial evidence showing she suffered an adverse effect from its alleged IPA\n\nviolation, testifying only that she was \"scared\" that Seals had possession of the drop file\n\ncontaining information about her.\n\n       Seals argued there was insufficient evidence to support a finding that she\n\nimproperly disclosed any records containing Hurley's personal information. In particular,\n\nshe argued that her disclosure to Rennie of information regarding Hurley and her (Seals's)\n\nsubsequent receipt of the supervisory drop file were proper because, inter alia, she (Seals)\n\nwas acting solely in her official capacity as a supervisor in so doing.\n\n\n\n                                              18\n\f       Hurley opposed both motions, arguing there was substantial evidence to support\n\nfindings that both DPR and Seals violated the IPA. Hurley argued, inter alia, that there\n\nwas substantial evidence to support findings that the supervisory drop file was a record\n\nthat contained her personal information, that DPR and Seals improperly disclosed her\n\npersonal information, and that she suffered an adverse effect from that disclosure.\n\n       The trial court issued an order denying both JNOV motions, finding there was\n\nsubstantial evidence to support the jury's verdicts finding that both DPR and Seals\n\nviolated the IPA.\n\n       C. Analysis.\n\n       Defendants assert the trial court erred by denying their JNOV motions to vacate\n\nthe verdicts against them on the IPA cause of action because there is insufficient evidence\n\nto support those verdicts.\n\n       \"A motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict may be granted only if it\n\nappears from the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the party securing the\n\nverdict, that there is no substantial evidence in support. [Citation.]\" (Sweatman v.\n\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (2001) 25 Cal.4th 62, 68.) On appeal from an order\n\ndenying a JNOV motion, \"the standard of review is whether any substantial evidenceโ\n\ncontradicted or uncontradictedโsupports the jury's conclusion. [Citations.]\" (Ibid.)\n\nAccordingly, we may reverse an order denying a JNOV motion \"only if, reviewing all the\n\nevidence in the light most favorable to [Hurley], resolving all conflicts, and drawing all\n\ninferences in her favor, and deferring to the implicit credibility determinations of the trier\n\n\n\n                                              19\n\fof fact, there was no substantial evidence to support the jury's verdict in her favor.\"\n\n(Begnal v. Canfield & Associates, Inc. (2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 66, 72.)\n\n       Record containing personal information. Applying that standard of review to the\n\nevidence admitted at trial, we conclude there is substantial evidence to support the\n\nverdicts against Defendants on Hurley's IPA cause of action. First, contrary to\n\nDefendants' assertion, there is substantial evidence to support a finding by the jury that\n\nSeals maintained on behalf of DPR a record regarding Hurley that contained her personal\n\ninformation within the meaning of the IPA. In particular, the supervisory drop file that\n\nSeals maintained regarding Hurley presumably identified Hurley by her name and\n\ncontained information about her, thereby meeting the IPA's definition of \"record.\"\n\n(ยง 1798.3, subd. (g).) Furthermore, the jury could reasonably infer that the drop file\n\ncontained \"personal information\" within the meaning of that term under the IPA. (Id.,\n\nsubd. (a).) Both Seals and Dolinar testified that a supervisory drop file typically would\n\ncontain work-related notes, counseling memoranda, and other documents regarding\n\ncorrective or disciplinary actions taken by a supervisor (e.g., Seals) and other matters\n\nregarding employees he or she supervises (e.g., Hurley). Furthermore, the jury could\n\nreasonably infer the file also contained a copy of Hurley's application to add her domestic\n\npartner as a beneficiary of her health insurance. That file also contained a note dated\n\nDecember 5, 2011, from Hurley's psychologist placing Hurley on leave for one month.\n\nSeals was also in possession of information, whether originating from Hurley's official\n\npersonnel file or the drop file, that Hurley had failed her probation at a prior job.\n\nAccordingly, there is substantial evidence to support a finding by the jury that Seals and\n\n                                              20\n\fDPR maintained information that \"identifie[d] or describe[d]\" Hurley within the meaning\n\nof section 1798.3, subdivision (a)'s definition of \"personal information.\"\n\n       Contrary to Defendants' assertion, the IPA's definition of \"record\" and \"personal\n\ninformation\" does not restrict an agency's maintenance of qualifying personal information\n\nto only a single, official personnel file. In support of their assertion, Defendants cite\n\nMoghadam v. Regents of University of California (2008) 169 Cal.App.4th 466\n\n(Moghadam). However, Moghadam is factually inapposite to this case and, in any event,\n\nwe are not persuaded by its reasoning. The crux of the plaintiff's claim against the\n\ndefendants in Moghadam was that they wrongfully refused to allow him to inspect and\n\nobtain copies of some of the midterm and final exams he took as a UCLA student. (Id. at\n\npp. 469-470.) Following the reasoning of Owasso Independent School District No. 1-011\n\nv. Falvo (2002) 534 U.S. 426 (Falvo), which interpreted and applied the Federal\n\nEducational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), Moghadam concluded the plaintiff's\n\nUCLA exams were not \"records\" under the IPA because they were not institutional\n\nrecords that were \"preserved in the ordinary course of business by a single, central\n\ncustodian.\" (Moghadam, at p. 480.) The court further concluded the plaintiff's exams did\n\nnot contain \"personal information\" under the IPA because they did not identify or\n\ndescribe him, but instead only discussed and analyzed the issues that were the subject of\n\nthe exams. (Id. at p. 483.) It stated: \"[A] record that contains only the individual's name,\n\nwithout any other identifying or descriptive information, is not 'personal information'\n\nwithin the meaning of the IPA.\" (Id. at p. 484.) Accordingly, the court concluded the\n\n\n\n                                              21\n\fplaintiff's student exams were not \"records\" containing \"personal information\" within the\n\nmeaning of the IPA. (Ibid.)\n\n       We decline to adopt Moghadam's interpretation of the term \"records\" under the\n\nIPA. There is nothing in the IPA's language showing that the Legislature intended to\n\nlimit the definition of \"records\" to only documents or other information maintained by an\n\nagency at a single, central location. The IPA defines a \"record\" as \"any file or grouping\n\nof information about an individual that is maintained by an agency by reference to an\n\nidentifying particular such as the individual's name, photograph, finger or voice print, or\n\na number or symbol assigned to the individual.\" (ยง 1798.3, subd. (g).) That definition\n\ndoes not expressly or implicitly include any requirement or limitation that the information\n\nbe maintained at a \"single, central location\" to qualify as a \"record\" under the IPA.\n\nFurthermore, Defendants' proffered interpretation that an agency's \"records\" under the\n\nIPA can only be maintained at a single, central location conflicts with other language in\n\nthe IPA that implicitly recognizes that personal information may be maintained at\n\nmultiple locations. For example, section 1798.34 generally provides individuals with the\n\nright to inspect an agency's records that contains personal information about them. Under\n\nthat statute, an agency is given up to 60 days after a request to permit an individual to\n\ninspect all personal information in \"records that are geographically dispersed.\"7\n\n\n\n\n7     If an agency's records containing personal information are active and not\ngeographically dispersed, the time period for permitting inspection by an individual is\nreduced to 30 days. (ยง 1798.34, subd. (a).)\n\n                                             22\n\f(ยง 1798.34, subd. (a).) It is impossible for records that are geographically dispersed to be\n\nmaintained by an agency at a single, central location. Accordingly, we reject Defendants'\n\nproffered interpretation of the term \"record\" under the IPA as being restricted to only a\n\nsingle, central location, such as the official personnel file maintained by DPR regarding\n\nHurley. Neither Moghadam nor Falvo persuades us to interpret the term \"record\" under\n\nIPA so restrictively. In particular, Falvo, on which Moghadam relied, involved FERPA,\n\na federal statute involving educational rights and definitions of terms different from those\n\nin the IPA.8\n\n       Contrary to Defendants' apparent assertion, there is nothing in the IPA's definition\n\nof \"personal information\" that restricts that information to that maintained by an agency\n\nin a single, central location. The IPA defines \"personal information\" as \"any information\n\nthat is maintained by an agency that identifies or describes an individual, including, but\n\nnot limited to, his or her name, social security number, physical description, home\n\naddress, home telephone number, education, financial matters, and medical or\n\nemployment history. It includes statements made by, or attributed to, the individual.\"\n\n(ยง 1798.3, subd. (a).) That statutory language does not include any geographic restriction\n\nor limitation on the location of the record containing personal information that is\n\nmaintained by an agency.\n\n\n\n8      For example, FERPA defines \"education records\" as \"those records, files,\ndocuments, and other materials which . . . [ยถ] (i) contain information directly related to a\nstudent; and [ยถ] (ii) are maintained by an educational agency or institution or by a\nperson acting for such agency or institution.\" (20 U.S.C. ยง 1232g(a)(4)(A); Moghadam,\nsupra, 169 Cal.App.4th at p. 478.)\n                                             23\n\f       Furthermore, contrary to Defendants' assertion, the information about Hurley that\n\nwas allegedly wrongfully disclosed in this case did not, as in Moghadam, consist solely\n\nof her name without any other identifying or descriptive information. (Cf. Moghadam,\n\nsupra, 169 Cal.App.4th at p. 484.) Rather, as discussed ante, there is substantial\n\nevidence to support a finding by the jury that Seals's supervisory drop file contained: (1)\n\nher work-related notes, counseling memoranda, and other documents regarding corrective\n\nor disciplinary actions and other matters regarding Hurley; (2) a copy of Hurley's\n\napplication to add her domestic partner as a beneficiary of her health insurance; and (3) a\n\nnote dated December 5, 2011, from Hurley's psychologist placing Hurley on leave for\n\none month. Seals also possessed information, whether originating from Hurley's official\n\npersonnel file or the drop file, that Hurley had failed her probation at a prior job. It\n\ncannot be reasonably disputed that the above information \"identifie[d] or describe[d]\"\n\nHurley within the meaning of \"personal information\" under the IPA. (ยง 1798.3, subd.\n\n(a).) Because the personal information that Defendants allegedly wrongfully disclosed\n\ndid not consist only of Hurley's name, Moghadam is factually inapposite and does not\n\nsupport Defendants' assertion that the information disclosed by them did not constitute\n\n\"personal information\" under the IPA.\n\n       Disclosure of personal information. Second, contrary to Defendants' assertion,\n\nthere is substantial evidence to support a finding that they disclosed personal information\n\nabout Hurley in violation of the IPA. In particular, there is substantial evidence that DPR\n\nand/or Seals improperly disclosed Hurley's personal information on at least two\n\noccasions. The evidence showed that on or about September 27, 2011, Seals disclosed to\n\n                                              24\n\fRennie information that she learned from Hurley's personnel file that she (Hurley) had\n\nfailed her probation at a prior job. That information clearly was personal information\n\nwithin the meaning of the IPA. Furthermore, the jury could reasonably find that Seals's\n\ndisclosure of that information to Rennie, a nonsupervisory DPR employee with a lesser\n\nrank than Hurley, was not \"relevant and necessary in the ordinary course of the\n\nperformance of [Seals's or Rennie's] official duties and [was not] related to the purpose\n\nfor which the information was acquired.\" (ยง 1798.24, subd. (d).) Although Defendants\n\nargued at trial that Rennie was Seals's de facto mentor, the jury could nevertheless\n\nreasonably reject Defendants' argument that Seals properly disclosed that personal\n\ninformation to Rennie under the IPA (i.e., the disclosure was relevant and necessary in\n\nthe ordinary course of performance of their official duties).9 (ยง 1798.24, subd. (d).)\n\n\n\n\n9       Furthermore, contrary to Defendants' assertion, the fact that Hurley's counsel in\nclosing argument implicitly referred only to disclosure of the supervisory drop file, and\nnot to the Rennie disclosure, did not preclude the jury from considering evidence that\nshowed violations of the IPA other than their wrongful disclosure of the supervisory drop\nfile and finding liability under the IPA based thereon. In closing, Hurley's counsel\nargued in pertinent part: \"The privacy violations is [sic] really a simple inquiry. Did Ms.\nSeals have a right to maintain and possess documents of Ms. Hurley's that related to her\nwork information, her medical information, her social security information? No. Those\nwere [DPR] documents and they affected her right to privacy. And they were distributed\nin the world, to her attorney.\" Defendants do not cite, and we are unaware of, any case or\nother authority supporting their assertion that counsels' closing arguments necessarily\nlimit what evidence a jury can consider and what legal theories a jury can apply in\ndeciding the issues before it (e.g., liability under the IPA). Therefore, we conclude the\njury could have based its verdicts finding Defendants liable for violations of the IPA on\nevidence other than DPR's alleged wrongful disclosure of the supervisory drop file to\nSeals and Seals's retention and disclosure to her counsel of that file thereafter (e.g.,\nSeals's disclosure to Rennie of Hurley's personal information).\n                                            25\n\f       The evidence also showed that after Seals was placed on administrative leave in\n\nMarch 2012, she asked Dolinar to deliver to her home the supervisory drop file for\n\nHurley so that she (Seals) could review it in preparation for her upcoming HRO interview\n\nregarding Hurley's complaint. Dolinar agreed and delivered the drop file to Seals at her\n\nhome. The jury could reasonably find that Dolinar, on behalf of DPR, improperly\n\ndisclosed to Seals personal information contained in the supervisory drop file regarding\n\nHurley in violation of the IPA. In particular, the jury could reasonably find that because\n\nat the time of that disclosure Seals was on administrative leave, she was not then Hurley's\n\nsupervisor and did not have any other relevant and necessary purpose in the ordinary\n\ncourse of the performance of her duties for the personal information about Hurley that\n\nwas contained in the drop file. (ยง 1798.24, subd. (d).) Although Defendants argued\n\nbelow and again argue on appeal that Seals merely used the drop file to help her prepare\n\nfor her HRO interview regarding Hurley's complaint, the jury could nevertheless\n\nreasonably reject their argument that the disclosure of the drop file's personal information\n\nto Seals for that purpose was \"relevant and necessary in the ordinary course of the\n\nperformance of [her] official duties\" within the meaning of the IPA. (ยง 1798.24, subd.\n\n(d).) Furthermore, as Hurley notes, Seals retained that supervisory drop file after her\n\nHRO interview and even after her retirement from DPR and subsequently gave it to her\n\nattorney in preparing her defense to the instant action. The jury could reasonably find\n\nthat the prolonged continuation of DPR's disclosure of the drop file's information to Seals\n\n(i.e., by not requesting and procuring its return from Seals to DPR) and her disclosure of\n\n\n\n                                            26\n\fthat personal information to her attorney also constituted improper disclosures of\n\npersonal information under the IPA.10 (ยง 1798.24, subd. (d).)\n\n       Adverse effect. Third, contrary to Defendants' assertion, there is substantial\n\nevidence to support a finding that Hurley suffered an adverse effect or adverse effects\n\nfrom their wrongful disclosures of her personal information in violation of the IPA.11 It\n\ncannot reasonably be disputed that emotional distress is one type of adverse effect a\n\n\n\n\n10      To the extent DPR argues in its appellant's reply brief that it could not have\nimproperly disclosed Hurley's personal information to Seals by her retention of the\nsupervisory drop file because she was already familiar with that information and cites\nanalogous federal cases in support of that argument (e.g., Quinn v. Stone (3d Cir. 1992)\n978 F.2d 126, 134; F.D.I.C. v. Dye (5th Cir. 1981) 642 F.2d 833, 836), DPR did not raise\nthat legal argument below or in its appellant's opening brief and therefore cannot\nbelatedly raise that new legal argument in its reply brief. (Julian v. Hartford\nUnderwriters Ins. Co. (2005) 35 Cal.4th 747, 761, fn. 4 [\"We decline to advance an\nargument that the [appellants] neither timely nor fully made.\"]; SCI California Funeral\nServices, Inc. v. Five Bridges Foundation (2012) 203 Cal.App.4th 549, 573, fn.18\n[\"appellant cannot salvage a forfeited argument by belatedly addressing the argument in\nits reply brief\"]; In re Marriage of Khera & Sameer (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 1467, 1477\n[\"Obvious reasons of fairness militate against consideration of an issue raised initially in\nthe reply brief of an appellant.\"]; Shade Foods, Inc. v.

Mahaffey (2013) 218 Cal.App.4th 1522, 1542 [striking new issue raised in\nreply brief because \"[t]here is absolutely no sound reason this issue could not have been\nraised in the . . . opening brief\"].) DPR did not make any attempt in its appellant's reply\nbrief to show it had a good reason for not raising that argument earlier and therefore it\nhas waived or forfeited that argument which was made for the first time in its reply brief.\n\n11     Because we conclude there is substantial evidence to support findings that Hurley\nsuffered adverse effects from Defendants' wrongful disclosures of her personal\ninformation, we need not, and do not, address the parties' arguments on whether there\nwas also substantial evidence to support a finding that Hurley suffered adverse effects\nfrom DPR's failure to properly maintain its records containing her personal information\nin violation of the IPA. (ยง 1798.21.)\n                                             27\n\fplaintiff can suffer from a violation of the IPA. (ยง 1798.45, subd. (c).) Lachtman v.\n\nRegents of the University of California (2007) 158 Cal.App.4th 187 (Lachtman), cited by\n\nDPR, is factually inapposite to this case and, in any event, does not hold otherwise.12\n\nContrary to Defendants' assertion, there is substantial evidence to support a finding that\n\nHurley suffered emotional distress as a result of both Seals's disclosure of her personal\n\ninformation to Rennie and DPR's disclosure to Seals of the supervisory drop file and her\n\nretention and disclosure of that file thereafter. Hurley testified that immediately after she\n\nwitnessed Seals's disclosure of her personal information to Rennie, she became sick and\n\nthrew up. Rennie also testified that after that incident Hurley appeared upset and left.\n\nSeals testified that after the Rennie incident Hurley left work early and went home sick.\n\nHurley went on medical leave the following day (i.e., September 28, 2011) and never\n\nreturned to work at OWD.13 Hurley testified at trial that following the Rennie incident\n\nshe was depressed and felt like she was being \"unraveled piece by piece.\" She testified\n\nshe was \"very, very sad\" and began seeing a therapist in October 2011. She testified she\n\ncould not stop crying and could not get out of bed, shower, or perform other basic tasks.\n\n\n\n12     Hurley correctly argues that because the plaintiff in Lachtman did not specifically\nallege any emotional distress damages from the alleged IPA violation, that case does not\nprovide any authority for DPR's apparent assertion that emotional distress suffered from\nan IPA violation cannot be an \"adverse effect\" pursuant to section 1798.45, subdivision\n(c). (Lachtman, supra, 158 Cal.App.4th at pp. 211-212.) Furthermore, because\nLachtman concluded the plaintiff did not prove any IPA violation, its discussion of the\n\"adverse effect\" requirement is dictum and does not provide any persuasive authority for\nDPR's argument. (Id. at p. 212.)\n\n13    As noted above, Hurley remained on leave until August 2012, when she accepted\nan SSA position at DPR's Monterey location.\n                                             28\n\fAccordingly, there is substantial evidence to support a finding that Hurley suffered\n\nemotional distress from Seals's disclosure of her personal information to Rennie.\n\n       There is also substantial evidence to support a finding that Hurley suffered\n\nemotional distress when she learned about DPR's disclosure of the supervisory drop file\n\nto Seals, her retention of that file, and her delivery of it to her attorney. Although\n\nDolinar, on behalf of DPR, delivered the drop file to Seals in March or April 2012 while\n\nshe (Seals) was on administrative leave, Hurley apparently did not learn of that disclosure\n\nof her personal information until Seals and her attorney delivered it to her (Hurley's)\n\nattorney in the course of discovery in the instant action, which delivery apparently\n\noccurred on April 29 or 30, 2013. Hurley then filed her first amended complaint on\n\nDecember 30, 2013, adding a cause of action against Defendants for violation of the IPA.\n\n       At trial, Hurley testified regarding the emotional distress she suffered when she\n\nlearned that Seals, Seals's attorney, and potentially other persons had her personal\n\ninformation contained in the supervisory drop file. Hurley stated she was \"really scared\"\n\nabout the fact that Seals had her personal information. In particular, Hurley stated Seals's\n\npossession of her personal information \"makes me feel like I have to check all the time\n\nand be careful with my credit and with . . . any of my information because she has,\n\nlike, . . . everything. So I feel like even in the future when this is all over, I'm still going\n\nto have to be checking because she still has my stuff.\" Although Hurley's testimony was\n\nrelatively brief on this issue, it nevertheless provided substantial evidence for the jury to\n\nreasonably infer that she suffered emotional distress from the fact that persons (e.g.,\n\nSeals) who should not have possession of her personal information did, in fact, have that\n\n                                               29\n\finformation. Contrary to DPR's assertion, Hurley's testimony that she did not personally\n\nknow what documents were included in the drop file or what Seals may have done with\n\nthe file (other than disclosing it to her attorney) does not show Hurley did not suffer\n\nemotional distress when she learned about DPR's wrongful disclosure of the file's\n\npersonal information.\n\n       Statutes of limitations. Furthermore, we reject DPR's argument that the applicable\n\nstatute of limitations bars any award of noneconomic damages against it. Section\n\n1798.49 generally provides: \"An action to enforce any liability created under Sections\n\n1798.45 to 1798.48, inclusive, may be brought . . . within two years from the date on\n\nwhich the cause of action arises . . . .\" Because section 1798.45 imposes liability on\n\nDPR, as an agency, for disclosing Hurley's personal information in violation of the IPA, a\n\ntwo-year statute of limitations applies to her IPA cause of action against DPR.\n\n(ยง 1798.49.) Therefore, because Hurley filed her first amended complaint on December\n\n30, 2013, adding the IPA cause of action against Defendants, her claim for damages,\n\nwhether economic or noneconomic, generally must be limited to damages arising out of\n\nIPA violations occurring on or after December 30, 2011. (ยง 1798.49.) Accordingly,\n\nHurley's claim for damages for emotional distress that she suffered from DPR's IPA\n\nviolations must be limited to those wrongful disclosures occurring on or after December\n\n30, 2011. Because Seals's disclosure of personal information to Rennie occurred in\n\nSeptember 2011, Hurley's claim for emotional distress damages, and proof of an adverse\n\neffect under section 1798.45, subdivision (c), is limited to DPR's subsequent disclosure of\n\nthe supervisory drop file to Seals in March or April 2012. As we concluded above, there\n\n                                             30\n\fis substantial evidence to support a finding that Hurley suffered emotional distress from\n\nDPR's disclosure of the drop file to Seals who, in turn, disclosed it to her attorney.\n\nBecause DPR's disclosure to Seals of the drop file occurred within the two-year period\n\nbefore Hurley filed her first amended complaint on December 30, 2013, there is\n\nsubstantial evidence to support the jury's finding that Hurley suffered an adverse effect\n\nfrom that disclosure within the meaning of section 1798.45, subdivision (c).\n\nAccordingly, we affirm the jury's award of $19,200 against DPR for past noneconomic\n\ndamages.14\n\n       We also reject Seals's argument that the applicable statute of limitations bars any\n\naward of noneconomic damages against her. Contrary to Seals's apparent assertion, the\n\ntwo-year statute of limitations set forth in section 1798.49 does not apply to her as an\n\nindividual. As quoted above, that statute of limitations applies only to liability imposed\n\nunder sections 1798.45 through 1798.48. (ยง 1798.49.) However, those sections apply\n\nonly to IPA actions against agencies. (See, e.g., ยง 1798.45 [\"An individual may bring a\n\ncivil action against an agency whenever such agency does any of the following . . . .\"].)\n\nHurley's IPA cause of action against Seals, as a nonagency individual, was necessarily\n\nbrought pursuant to section 1798.53.15 Seals does not cite, nor has our review of the IPA\n\n\n\n14     DPR does not make any substantive legal argument showing that the amount of\nnoneconomic damages awarded against it was incorrect or otherwise not supported by\nsubstantial evidence.\n\n15      Section 1798.53 provides in part: \"Any person, other than an employee of the\nstate or of a local government agency acting solely in his or her official capacity, who\nintentionally discloses information, not otherwise public, which they know or should\n                                             31\n\ffound, any provision in the IPA that expressly sets forth a statute of limitations that\n\napplies to IPA causes of action filed against individuals pursuant to section 1798.53.\n\nAccordingly, Code of Civil Procedure section 338, subdivision (a), the default statute of\n\nlimitations that generally applies to actions for personal injuries based on statutory\n\nviolations, necessarily applies to Hurley's IPA cause of action against Seals. That statute\n\nsets forth a three-year statute of limitations for \"[a]n action upon a liability created by\n\nstatute . . . .\" (Code Civ. Proc., ยง 338, subd. (a).) Because Hurley's IPA cause of action\n\nagainst Seals was necessarily based on her (Seals's) alleged liability under section\n\n1798.53, that alleged liability was based on \"a liability created by statute\" and therefore a\n\nthree-year statute of limitations applies to that cause of action. (Code Civ. Proc., ยง 338,\n\nsubd. (a).)\n\n       Applying that three-year statute of limitations to the evidence of Hurley's\n\nemotional distress or other adverse effects that she suffered as a result of Seals's wrongful\n\ndisclosure of her (Hurley's) personal information, we conclude Hurley's first amended\n\ncomplaint, filed on December 30, 2013, and adding the IPA cause of action against Seals,\n\nwas timely filed as to Seals's wrongful disclosures occurring on or after December 30,\n\n2010. Because both of Seals's wrongful disclosures discussed above (i.e., the Rennie\n\ndisclosure in September 2011 and drop file disclosure to her attorney apparently in April\n\n2013) occurred within that time period, the three-year statute of limitations that applies to\n\n\n\n\nreasonably know was obtained from personal information maintained by a state\nagency . . . , shall be subject to a civil action, for invasion of privacy, by the individual to\nwhom the information pertains.\"\n                                               32\n\fHurley's IPA cause of action against Seals did not bar any liability the jury imposed on\n\nher for emotional distress or other damages Hurley suffered as a result of the Rennie\n\ndisclosure and/or Seals's disclosure of the supervisory drop file to her attorney. Because\n\nthere is substantial evidence, as discussed ante, to support the jury's finding that Hurley\n\nsuffered emotional distress and thus an adverse effect or effects, from either or both of\n\nthose disclosures, we affirm the jury's award of $19,200 against Seals for past\n\nnoneconomic damages.16\n\n       Although we concluded, ante, that there is substantial evidence to support a\n\nfinding Hurley suffered an adverse effect in the form of emotional distress damages\n\nresulting from DPR's wrongful disclosure to Seals of her (Hurley's) personal information\n\ncontained in the supervisory drop file, we nevertheless conclude there is insufficient\n\nevidence to support a finding Hurley suffered an adverse effect in the form of economic\n\ndamages resulting from that disclosure. At trial, Hurley presented evidence of economic\n\ndamages that she suffered as a result of the Rennie disclosure in September 2011, which\n\nclaim for damages against DPR was, as discussed ante, barred by the section 1798.49\n\ntwo-year statute of limitations. In particular, Hurley testified that at the time she went on\n\nleave (i.e., September 28, 2011) her gross salary was $3,841 per month. She further\n\ntestified she was on leave without pay from that date through about August 2012, when\n\nshe accepted a position at DPR's Monterey location. However, the record does not\n\n\n\n16     Seals does not make any substantive legal argument showing that the amount of\nnoneconomic damages awarded against her was incorrect or otherwise not supported by\nsubstantial evidence.\n                                             33\n\fcontain any evidence showing Hurley suffered any economic damages following her\n\ndiscovery on April 29 or 30, 2013, that DPR had disclosed to Seals the supervisory drop\n\nfile when Seals was on administrative leave. The jury's award of $19,200 in economic\n\ndamages closely correlates with Hurley's evidence showing she lost wages of $3,841 per\n\nmonth, presumably during the five-month period while she was on leave until Seals\n\nherself went on leave and was no longer her supervisor (i.e., from October 2011 through\n\nFebruary 2012). Because five months of lost wages of $3,840 per month totals economic\n\ndamages of $19,200, we presume the jury calculated Hurley's economic damages based\n\non that five-month period of lost wages. However, those economic damages were based\n\non Defendants' September 2011 wrongful disclosure to Rennie of Hurley's personal\n\ninformation, which disclosure, as discussed ante, preceded the two-year statute of\n\nlimitations period applicable to DPR pursuant to section 1798.49. Therefore, any adverse\n\neffect resulting from that wrongful disclosure cannot provide the basis for an award of\n\neconomic damages against DPR. Because Hurley did not present substantial evidence\n\nshowing she suffered any economic damages as a result of her discovery in April 2013 of\n\nDPR's wrongful disclosure to Seals of the supervisory drop file or as a result of any other\n\npost-December 30, 2011, wrongful disclosure, we conclude there is insufficient evidence\n\nto support the jury's award of $19,200 in economic damages against DPR. Accordingly,\n\nthat part of the judgment must be stricken.17\n\n\n\n\n17    Because Seals does not, and could not persuasively, argue the jury's award of\n$19,200 in economic damages against her is barred by the statute of limitations\n                                            34\n\f                                             III\n\n                      Section 47, Subdivision (b), Litigation Privilege\n\n       Defendants also contend the trial court erred by denying their JNOV motions\n\nbecause the litigation privilege under section 47, subdivision (b), barred Hurley's IPA\n\ncause of action against them. In particular, they argue Hurley's IPA cause of action was\n\nbased solely on DPR's disclosure of the supervisory drop file to Seals in March or April\n\n2012 and her retention of that file and disclosure of it to her attorney thereafter, which\n\ndisclosures Hurley discovered in April 2013. However, because Seals's liability as an\n\nindividual defendant is supported by substantial evidence that she wrongfully disclosed\n\nHurley's personal information to Rennie on or about September 27, 2011, the IPA verdict\n\nagainst Seals can be affirmed based on that disclosure alone and therefore we need not\n\naddress whether she (Seals) can assert the litigation privilege against the IPA cause of\n\naction based on Hurley's discovery in April 2013 that DPR wrongfully disclosed to Seals\n\nthe supervisory drop file and Seals wrongfully retained that file and disclosed it to her\n\nattorney thereafter. In any event, because DPR's IPA liability can, as discussed ante, be\n\naffirmed solely on its disclosure to Seals of the supervisory drop file, we nevertheless\n\naddress the merits of the contention that Defendants' disclosures of that drop file were\n\nprotected by the litigation privilege under section 47, subdivision (b).\n\n\n\n\napplicable to Hurley's IPA claim against her, we affirm that award of economic damages\nagainst Seals.\n                                             35\n\f                                              A\n\n       The litigation privilege under section 47, subdivision (b), provides an affirmative\n\ndefense to defendants for liability based on certain communications made in legislative,\n\njudicial, or other official proceedings authorized by law. \"[T]he privilege applies to any\n\ncommunication (1) made in judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings; (2) by litigants or other\n\nparticipants authorized by law; (3) to achieve the objects of the litigation; and (4) that\n\nhave some connection or logical relation to the action.\" (Silberg v. Anderson (1990) 50\n\nCal.3d 205, 212.) In particular, the litigation privilege may apply to bar privacy causes of\n\naction based on common law, a statute, or a constitutional right. (Jacob B. v. County of\n\nShasta (2007) 40 Cal.4th 948, 962 (Jacob B.).)\n\n       However, the litigation privilege \"protects only against communicative acts and\n\nnot against noncommunicative acts. [Citation.]\" (Jacob B., supra, 40 Cal.4th at p. 956.)\n\nAlternatively stated, the privilege applies only to communicative acts and does not\n\nprotect tortious courses of conduct. (Olszewski v. Scripps Health (2003) 30 Cal.4th 798,\n\n830.) \"Because the litigation privilege protects only publications and communications, a\n\n'threshold issue in determining the applicability' of the privilege is whether the\n\ndefendant's conduct was communicative or noncommunicative.\" (Rusheen v. Cohen\n\n(2006) 37 Cal.4th 1048, 1058 (Rusheen).) For example, the litigation privilege has been\n\napplied to the filing of false declarations of service to obtain a default judgment. (Id. at p.\n\n1052.) \"[T]he key in determining whether the privilege applies is whether the injury\n\nallegedly resulted from an act that was communicative in its essential nature.\" (Id. at p.\n\n1058.) Furthermore, \"if the gravamen of the action is communicative, the litigation\n\n                                              36\n\fprivilege extends to noncommunicative acts that are necessarily related to the\n\ncommunicative conduct . . . . Stated another way, unless it is demonstrated that an\n\nindependent, noncommunicative, wrongful act was the gravamen of the action, the\n\nlitigation privilege applies.\" (Id. at p. 1065.) \"The following acts have been deemed\n\nnoncommunicative and thus unprivileged: prelitigation illegal recording of confidential\n\ntelephone conversations [citation]; eavesdropping on a telephone conversation [citation];\n\nand physician's negligent examination of patient causing physical injury [citation].\" (Id.\n\nat p. 1058.)\n\n                                               B\n\n       Defendants repeatedly asserted below the affirmative defense of the litigation\n\nprivilege to Hurley's IPA cause of action, but the trial court rejected its applicability to\n\nthe circumstances in this case. Because the gravamen of Hurley's IPA cause of action\n\nwas Defendants' noncommunicative act or acts of disclosure or transfer of her personal\n\ninformation in violation of the IPA, we conclude the litigation privilege does not apply to\n\npreclude their liability under the IPA. In particular, DPR's noncommunicative conduct of\n\ntransferring the supervisory drop file to Seals resulted in Hurley's injury under the IPA.\n\nLikewise, Seals's subsequent noncommunicative conduct of transferring the drop file to\n\nher attorney also resulted in injury to Hurley under the IPA. Contrary to Defendants'\n\nassertion, their wrongful conduct was not communicative in its essential nature.\n\n(Rusheen, supra, 37 Cal.4th at p. 1058.) Defendants' transfers of the supervisory drop\n\nfile to unauthorized persons in violation of the IPA is similar to other acts that have been\n\ndeemed noncommunicative and thus unprivileged, such as prelitigation illegal recording\n\n                                              37\n\fof confidential telephone conversations and eavesdropping on a telephone conversation.\n\n(Ibid.)\n\n          In Kimmel v. Goland (1990) 51 Cal.3d 202 (Kimmel), the court concluded the\n\nnoncommunicative acts of illegal recording of confidential telephone conversations were\n\nnot privileged under former section 47, subdivision (2), which was the predecessor to\n\nsection 47, subdivision (b). (Kimmel, at p. 205.) That tortious conduct was not\n\nprivileged even though it was done for the purpose of gathering evidence for future\n\nlitigation. (Ibid.) Kimmel stated: \"[P]ark management seeks statutory damages under\n\nPenal Code section 637.2 not for injuries arising from the broadcast and publication of\n\nprivate conversations, but from the recording of them. Moreover, since park\n\nmanagement's right to a statutory remedy accrued at the moment of the violation,\n\nplaintiffs' contention that the telephone conversations were made in anticipation of\n\nlitigation is simply irrelevant.\" (Kimmel, at p. 212.) As support for its conclusion,\n\nKimmel discussed an analogous hypothetical situation in which a prospective plaintiff\n\nengaged in prelitigation criminal conduct, stating:\n\n             \"Suppose, a prospective defendant kept important documents at\n             home. If a prospective plaintiff, in anticipation of litigation,\n             burglarized defendant's premises in order to obtain evidence,\n             plaintiffs here would apparently apply the privilege to protect the\n             criminal conduct. Such an extension of [former] section 47(2) is\n             untenable.\" (Kimmel, supra, 51 Cal.3d at p. 212.)\n\nAccordingly, Kimmel rejected the plaintiffs' argument that the litigation privilege\n\nprotected them from liability for their prelitigation, noncommunicative conduct in\n\nviolation of a statute. (Kimmel, supra, 51 Cal.3d at pp. 205, 212.)\n\n\n                                               38\n\f       We believe the conduct in this case is more similar to the nonprivileged,\n\nnoncommunicative conduct in Kimmel than the privileged communications or\n\npublications in the cases cited by Defendants (e.g., Rusheen, supra, 37 Cal.4th 1048;\n\nJacob B., supra, 40 Cal.4th 948). As discussed ante, the gravamen of Hurley's IPA cause\n\nof action is Defendants' violation of the IPA by transferring or disclosing her personal\n\ninformation, which conduct is noncommunicative in its essential nature. (Rusheen, at p.\n\n1058.) As in Kimmel, Hurley's \"right to a statutory remedy accrued at the moment of\n\n[Defendants' statutory] violation\" when they transferred her personal information to an\n\nunauthorized person or persons, and Defendants' assertion that such noncommunicative\n\nconduct was done in the course of the HRO investigation or in anticipation of litigation\n\n(i.e., Hurley's future lawsuit) is irrelevant. (Kimmel, supra, 51 Cal.3d at p. 212; cf. Susan\n\nS. v. Israels (1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 1290, 1301 [\"[T]he litigation privilege does not shield\n\ndefendants from liability for reading and disseminating Susan S.'s private mental health\n\nrecords for the purpose of gathering evidence to be used in the course of a criminal\n\nproceeding.\"].) Accordingly, we conclude the section 47, subdivision (b), litigation\n\nprivilege does not apply to protect Defendants from liability for their violations of the\n\nIPA in this case.\n\n                                             IV\n\n                       Seals's IPA Liability Under Section 1798.53\n\n       Seals contends that the trial court erred by denying her JNOV motion because\n\nHurley's IPA cause of action against her was alleged under, and the jury was instructed\n\non, a statute (i.e., ยง 1798.45) that was inapplicable to her. She argues that because she\n\n                                             39\n\fcould be found liable as an individual only under section 1798.53 and the jury was\n\ninstructed only on liability under section 1798.45, the IPA verdict against her must be\n\nreversed.\n\n                                                A\n\n          Hurley's first amended complaint, which added the IPA cause of action against\n\nDefendants, alleged violations of the IPA, but did not cite the specific statutes imposing\n\nliability on DPR as an agency (ยง 1798.45) or Seals as an individual (ยง 1798.53).\n\nHowever, Hurley proposed separate jury instructions for DPR's alleged IPA liability as an\n\nagency and Seals's alleged IPA liability as an individual, specifically citing as authority\n\nthe applicable statutes imposing their alleged respective liability (i.e., ยงยง 1798.45 &\n\n1798.53). DPR presented its own proposed instruction on the IPA cause of action. In\n\ndiscussing those proposed instructions at the beginning of the trial, the trial court and the\n\nparties' counsel specifically discussed the different bases for liability of an agency\n\n(ยง 1798.45) and an individual under the IPA (ยง 1798.53). Following a recess, the parties'\n\ncounsel informed the court that they had agreed on instructions for the IPA cause of\n\naction.\n\n          On conclusion of the trial, the court then instructed the jury on the IPA cause of\n\naction, paraphrasing section 1798.45 and stating in pertinent part:\n\n             \"Ms. Hurley claims that [DPR] and/or Ms. Seals violated the [IPA]\n             by disclosing records that contain her personal information. To\n             establish this claim against [DPR] and Ms. Seals, Ms. Hurley must\n             prove[:]\n\n\n\n\n                                               40\n\f          \"One, that [DPR] and/or Ms. Seals disclosed records containing\n          personal information about Ms. Hurley in a manner that would link\n          the information disclosed to Ms. Hurley.\n\n          \"Two, that the disclosure was not relevant and necessary in the\n          ordinary course of the performance of [DPR's] and/or Ms. Seals'[s]\n          official duties and was not related to the purpose for which the\n          information was acquired.\n\n          \"And three, that as a result, Ms. Hurley suffered an adverse\n          effect. . . .\"\n\nSeals's counsel did not object to that instruction or request any additional or clarifying\n\ninstructions.\n\n                                              B\n\n       Contrary to Seals's assertion, Hurley did not mistakenly allege a cause of action\n\nagainst her as an agency under section 1798.45 rather than as an individual under section\n\n1798.53. The first amended complaint did not specify the particular statute of the IPA\n\nunder which Hurley sought to impose liability on Seals. Furthermore, at the beginning of\n\nthe trial, Hurley proposed instructions that expressly sought to impose liability on Seals\n\nas an individual under section 1798.53.18 Nevertheless, based on the agreement of all\n\nparties' counsel, the trial court instructed the jury on Hurley's IPA cause of action against\n\nDefendants using language from section 1798.45 and not section 1798.53. To the extent\n\n\n\n\n18     As quoted above, section 1798.53 provides in part: \"Any person, other than an\nemployee of the state or of a local government agency acting solely in his or her official\ncapacity, who intentionally discloses information, not otherwise public, which they know\nor should reasonably know was obtained from personal information maintained by a state\nagency . . . shall be subject to a civil action, for invasion of privacy, by the individual to\nwhom the information pertains.\"\n                                             41\n\fSeals argues the court erred by so doing and/or that Hurley, in effect, forfeited any claim\n\nagainst her based on section 1798.53, Seals waived or forfeited, and apparently even\n\ninvited, any such error by the court or forfeiture by Hurley because Seals implicitly, if not\n\nexpressly, agreed to that instruction and did not timely object to the instruction given by\n\nthe court or request clarifying language regarding Hurley's IPA claim against her as an\n\nindividual.

County\n\nof Solano (1968) 265 Cal.App.2d 161, 171 (Hilts).)\n\n       We apply the principles, ante, to estop or bar Seals from challenging on appeal the\n\ninstructions given by the trial court that resulted in the jury's finding that she was liable to\n\nHurley on the IPA cause of action. Because Seals presumably adopted a deliberate trial\n\nstrategy by not objecting to the incomplete or inapplicable instructions and not requesting\n\nadditional or clarifying instructions on the IPA claim against her, Seals may not now on\n\nappeal use that tactical decision to claim prejudicial error and obtain reversal of the jury's\n\nverdict on the IPA cause of action against her. (Cf. Mesecher, supra, 9 Cal.App.4th at p.\n\n1686.) Accordingly, although we presume the trial court erroneously instructed on\n\nSeals's alleged liability under the IPA by giving an instruction only on section 1798.45\n\nand not on section 1798.53, we nevertheless conclude Seals cannot raise that error on\n\nappeal, nor can she raise the issue of whether, based on the instructions given, Hurley\n\nmistakenly sought liability against her under section 1798.45 rather than under section\n\n1798.53.\n\n       Based on the same reasoning, ante, we further conclude Seals cannot raise her\n\nalternative argument that there is insufficient evidence that would have supported a\n\nfinding by the jury that she was liable under section 1798.53. Although section 1798.53\n\nliability requires a finding that Seals \"intentionally\" disclosed personal information in\n\nviolation of the IPA, the jury was not instructed on that requirement because of her\n\n                                              43\n\ffailure to request additional or clarifying instructions setting forth that and other\n\nrequirements under section 1978.53. Accordingly, Seals has waived or forfeited her\n\ncontention on appeal that there is insufficient evidence to support a verdict finding her\n\nliable under section 1978.53 with its specific elements.

In particular, she argues there is insufficient evidence that she\n\nengaged in any extreme and outrageous conduct that would support her IIED liability.\n\n                                              A\n\n       The trial court instructed the jury with CACI No. 1600 on the IIED cause of\n\naction, stating:\n\n           \"[Hurley] claims that [Seals's] conduct caused her to suffer severe\n           emotional distress. To establish this claim, [Hurley] must prove all\n           of the following:\n\n           \"1. That [Seals's] conduct was outrageous;\n\n\n\n                                              44\n\f          \"2. [Seals] intended to cause [Hurley] emotional distress; or [ยถ]\n          [t]hat [Seals] acted with reckless disregard of the probability that\n          [Hurley] would suffer emotional distress, knowing that [Hurley] was\n          present when the conduct occurred;\n\n          \"3. That [Hurley] suffered severe emotional distress; and\n\n          \"4. That [Seals's] conduct was a substantial factor in causing\n          [Hurley's] severe emotional distress.\"\n\nThe court also instructed with CACI No. 1602 on the definition of \"outrageous conduct,\"\n\nstating in pertinent part: \" 'Outrageous conduct' is conduct so extreme that it goes beyond\n\nall possible bounds of decency. Conduct is outrageous if a reasonable person would\n\nregard the conduct as intolerable in a civilized community. Outrageous conduct does not\n\ninclude trivialities such as indignities, annoyances, hurt feelings, or bad manners that a\n\nreasonable person is expected to endure. . . .\" The court also instructed with CACI No.\n\n1603 on reckless disregard and CACI No. 1604 on severe emotional distress. The court\n\nalso instructed with CACI Nos. 1620 and 401 on the NIED cause of action. The jury\n\nreturned verdicts finding Seals liable on the IIED and NIED causes of action.\n\n                                             B\n\n       We conclude there is substantial evidence to support the jury's verdicts finding\n\nSeals liable on the IIED and NIED causes of action. In particular, as discussed ante,\n\nthere is evidence showing Hurley was outside of Seals's office when Seals discussed with\n\nRennie, a nonsupervisory DPR employee with a lesser rank than Hurley, information that\n\nHurley had failed her probation at a prior job. Immediately after witnessing that\n\nconversation, Hurley became ill, threw up, and left work for the remainder of the day,\n\nand she went on medical leave the following day. In addition, there was trial testimony\n\n                                             45\n\fthat while at a Sacramento hotel on a DPR business trip, Seals \"flashed\" her breasts in the\n\npresence of Hurley and others. Hurley also testified that when she told Seals that she\n\nwould be adding her domestic partner as a beneficiary of her health insurance, Seals\n\nreplied: \"So, you really like boobs better?\" Hurley also testified about other comments\n\nSeals made about her (Hurley's) sexual orientation and style of hair and clothing.\n\n       Contrary to Seals's assertion, evidence of her receipt and retention of the\n\nsupervisory drop file and subsequent transfer of that file to her attorney was not the\n\n\"only\" evidence in support of the jury's finding that Hurley suffered emotional distress.\n\nAs summarized ante, Hurley witnessed Seals discussing with Rennie her personal\n\ninformation (i.e., Hurley's failure of probation at a prior job), witnessed Seals flashing her\n\nbreasts, and was subjected to Seals's many comments about her sexual orientation and\n\nappearance. The jury could reasonably find that that evidence of Seals's conduct was\n\noutrageous conduct so as to support a finding against Seals on the IIED cause of action.\n\nAlthough Seals does not expressly address the sufficiency of the evidence to support the\n\njury's verdict on the NIED cause of action, we likewise conclude the jury could\n\nreasonably find that the evidence, ante, of Seals's conduct was also sufficient to support a\n\nfinding against Seals on the NIED cause of action (i.e., that Seals was negligent in\n\ncausing Hurley serious emotional distress). Because there is substantial evidence to\n\nsupport the IIED and NIED verdicts against Seals, the trial court did not err by denying\n\nSeals's JNOV motion on the ground of insufficiency of the evidence.\n\n       To the extent Seals also argues the jury's verdicts improperly allowed Hurley to\n\nreceive a double recovery for her emotional distress damages, the record does not support\n\n                                             46\n\fthat argument. The jury was given only one verdict form asking it to calculate Hurley's\n\npast noneconomic damages, which form was not specific to a particular cause of action.\n\nThe jury awarded Hurley a single amount of $19,200 for her past noneconomic damages\n\n(e.g., emotional distress damages). Therefore, contrary to Seals's assertion, Hurley was\n\nnot awarded double damages for the emotional distress she suffered based on her IPA,\n\nIIED, and/or NIED causes of action.\n\n                                            VI\n\n                       Workers' Compensation Exclusivity Doctrine\n\n       Seals contends the trial court erred by denying her JNOV motion because the\n\nworkers' compensation exclusivity doctrine necessarily applied to bar the IIED and NIED\n\ncauses of action against her.\n\n                                             A\n\n       Labor Code section 3602, subdivision (a),19 generally provides that employees\n\nmay seek compensation for job-related injuries against their employers only through the\n\nworkers' compensation system. In the context of emotional distress injuries, the\n\nCalifornia Supreme Court has held: \"So long as the basic conditions of compensation are\n\notherwise satisfied (Lab. Code, ยง 3600), and the employer's conduct neither contravenes\n\nfundamental public policy [citation] nor exceeds the risks inherent in the employment\n\n\n\n\n19        Labor Code section 3602, subdivision (a), provides: \"Where the conditions of\ncompensation set forth in Section 3600 concur, the right to recover compensation\nis . . . the sole and exclusive remedy of the employee or his or her dependents against the\nemployer. . . .\"\n                                            47\n\frelationship [citation], an employee's emotional distress injuries are subsumed under the\n\nexclusive remedy provisions of workers' compensation.\" (Livitsanos v. Superior Court\n\n(1992) 2 Cal.4th 744, 754 (Livitsanos).) Therefore, if a plaintiff's emotional distress\n\ninjuries occurred \"at the worksite, in the normal course of the employer-employee\n\nrelationship,\" the workers' compensation exclusivity doctrine will apply to bar an\n\nindependent action for intentional and/or negligent infliction of emotional distress.\n\n(Miklosy v. Regents of University of California (2008) 44 Cal.4th 876, 902 (Miklosy).)\n\nFor example, demotions and criticism of an employee's work practices that cause\n\nemotional injury are considered to be within the workers' compensation bargain. (Singh\n\nv. Southland Stone, U.S.A., Inc. (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 338, 367.)\n\n       Exceptions to application of the workers' compensation exclusivity doctrine exist\n\nwhere the conduct contravenes fundamental public policy or the conduct exceeds the\n\nrisks inherent in the employment relationship. (Livitsanos, supra, 2 Cal.4th at p. 754.)\n\nAlternatively stated, that doctrine does not apply where the employer \"stepped out of [its]\n\nproper role[].\" (Cole v. Fair Oaks Fire Protection Dist. (1987) 43 Cal.3d 148, 161.) In\n\nparticular, that doctrine does not apply to bar an employee's action for invasion of the\n\nconstitutional right to privacy or for false imprisonment. (Operating Engineers Local 3\n\nv. Johnson (2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 180, 191 (Johnson); Fermino v. Fedco, Inc.

In particular,\n\nthe court instructed:\n\n          \"To succeed on this defense, [Seals] must prove all of the following:\n\n          \"1. That the harm sustained by [Hurley] arose from the normal part\n          of the employment relationship between [Hurley] and [DPR];\n\n          \"2. That [DPR] had workers' compensation [insurance] covering\n          [Hurley] at the time of the harm or was self-insured for workers'\n          compensation at the time of [Hurley's] harm; and\n\n          \"3. That [Seals] was acting in the scope of her employment at the\n          time [Hurley] claims she was harmed.\"\n\nBy finding Seals liable under the IIED and NIED causes of action, the jury necessarily\n\nfound that the workers' compensation exclusivity doctrine did not apply and, in\n\nparticular, that Hurley's emotional distress damages did not arise from the normal part of\n\nher employment relationship.\n\n                                              C\n\n       Contrary to Seals's apparent assertion, we conclude there is substantial evidence to\n\nsupport the jury's finding that the workers' compensation exclusivity doctrine did not\n\napply to bar Hurley's IIED and NIED causes of action against her. The jury could\n\nreasonably find that Seals's initial receipt, retention, and subsequent delivery to her\n\nattorney of the supervisory drop file containing Hurley's personal information while she\n\n(Seals) was on administrative leave and medical leave and after her retirement exceeded\n\nthe risks inherent in Hurley's employment relationship and did not occur at the workplace\n\n                                             49\n\fin the normal course of the employer-employee relationship. (Livitsanos, supra,\n\n2 Cal.4th at p. 754; Miklosy, supra, 44 Cal.4th at p. 902.) Seals's conduct violated the\n\nIPA and did not occur either at the workplace or while she was acting as Hurley's\n\nsupervisor or otherwise within the scope of her (Seals's) employment. Furthermore,\n\nSeals's conduct was contrary to the IPA's fundamental public policy against improper\n\ndisclosures of personal information maintained by agencies. (ยง 1798.1 [\"the right to\n\nprivacy is a personal and fundamental right\"]; cf. Johnson, supra, 110 Cal.App.4th at p.\n\n191 [workers' compensation exclusivity doctrine did not bar action for violation of\n\nemployee's constitutional right to privacy]; Livitsanos, at p. 754 [recognizing\n\nfundamental public policy exception to workers' compensation exclusivity doctrine].)\n\nTherefore, contrary to Seals's assertion, the jury could reasonably find that the emotional\n\ndistress that Hurley suffered on discovery that Seals had possession of the supervisory\n\ndrop file containing her personal information and had delivered it to her attorney (and\n\npossibly others) was not a normal part of Hurley's employment relationship for which the\n\nworkers' compensation exclusivity doctrine applied.20 Accordingly, the trial court did\n\nnot err by denying Seals's JNOV motion on the grounds of the workers' compensation\n\nexclusivity doctrine.\n\n\n\n\n20       Although Seals's conduct regarding the supervisory drop file was sufficient, in\nitself, to support the IIED and NIED verdicts against her, there was also other conduct\n(e.g., Seals's flashing her breasts to Hurley and others at a hotel) that was not a normal\npart of Hurley's employment and not protected by the workers' compensation exclusivity\ndoctrine and therefore could provide additional support for the jury's verdicts on the IIED\nand NIED causes of action.\n                                            50\n\f                                             VII\n\n                          Punitive Damages Award Against Seals\n\n       Seals contends the trial court erred by denying her JNOV motion because it erred\n\nin instructing the jury on punitive damages and there was insufficient evidence to support\n\nan award of punitive damages against her. In particular, she argues the court failed to\n\ninstruct that Hurley had the burden to show by \"clear and convincing evidence\" that she\n\nacted with oppression, fraud, or malice, which showing is required for an award of\n\npunitive damages.\n\n                                              A\n\n       Section 3294, subdivision (a), provides: \"In an action for the breach of an\n\nobligation not arising from contract, where it is proven by clear and convincing evidence\n\nthat the defendant has been guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice, the plaintiff, in addition\n\nto the actual damages, may recover damages for the sake of example and by way of\n\npunishing the defendant.\" (Italics added.) \"Malice\" is defined as \"conduct which is\n\nintended by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or despicable conduct which is\n\ncarried on by the defendant with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety\n\nof others.\" (ยง 3294, subd.

The court instructed with CACI No. 3941, stating:\n\n           \"If you decide that [Seals's] conduct toward [Hurley] caused\n           [Hurley] harm, you must decide whether that conduct justifies an\n           award of punitive damages. At this time, you must decide whether\n           [Hurley] has proved by clear and convincing evidence that [Seals]\n           engaged in conduct towards [Hurley] with malice, oppression, or\n           fraud.

In that case, the plaintiff did not request an instruction, and the trial court did\n\nnot instruct, on the requirement that the jury find that the defendant's oppression, fraud,\n\nor malice was proved by clear and convincing evidence. (Id. at p. 1050.)\n\n       To the extent Seals argues the jury should also have been instructed with CACI\n\nNo. 20121 on the clear and convincing evidence standard, she waived or forfeited that\n\n\n\n\n21       CACI No. 201 states: \"Certain facts must be proved by clear and convincing\nevidence, which is a higher burden of proof.

Code, ยง 12900 et seq.), and a cause of action for violation of the\n\nInformation Practices Act (IPA; Civ. Code, ยง 1798 et seq.1) and additionally alleged\n\ncauses of action against Seals only for intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED)\n\nand negligent infliction of emotional distress (NIED). Following trial, the jury returned\n\nverdicts in favor of Defendants on the FEHA causes of action, against Defendants on the\n\nIPA cause of action, and against Seals on the IIED and NIED causes of action. The jury\n\nawarded Hurley $19,200 for past economic damages and $19,200 for past noneconomic\n\nlosses against both Defendants, and $28,800 in punitive damages against Seals only. The\n\ncourt denied Defendants' motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV). On\n\nappeal, Hurley contends the trial court erred by excluding evidence that was relevant to\n\nher FEHA causes of action.\n\n\n\n\n1      All further statutory references are to the Civil Code unless otherwise specified.\n                                              2\n\f       DPR and Seals filed appeals challenging the judgment against them on the IPA\n\ncause of action and the trial court's denial of their JNOV motions. In its appeal, DPR\n\ncontends: (1) there is insufficient evidence to support the finding it violated the IPA; and\n\n(2) the litigation privilege under section 47, subdivision (b), barred the IPA cause of\n\naction against it. In her appeal, Seals contends: (1) there is insufficient evidence to\n\nsupport the finding she violated the IPA; (2) the litigation privilege barred the IPA cause\n\nof action against her; (3) the IPA cause of action was alleged under, and the jury was\n\ninstructed on, a statute (i.e., ยง 1798.45) that was inapplicable to her; (4) there is\n\ninsufficient evidence to support the findings against her on the IIED and NIED causes of\n\naction; (5) the workers' compensation exclusivity doctrine barred the IIED and NIED\n\ncauses of action against her; and (6) the punitive damages award against her must be\n\nreversed for, inter alia, instructional error and insufficiency of the evidence to support it.\n\n       Based on our reasoning below, we affirm the judgment, except for the award of\n\neconomic damages against DPR, and modify the judgment accordingly.\n\n                   FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n       In December 2009, Hurley was hired by Seals as a staff services analyst (SSA) for\n\nDPR's Ocotillo Wells Off-Highway Motor Vehicle Recreation District (OWD). Seals\n\nwas Hurley's direct supervisor from the date of her hiring until she (Hurley) went on\n\nmedical leave on September 28, 2011. Kathy Dolinar, OWD's district superintendent,\n\nwas Seals's supervisor.\n\n       Seals socialized with her staff during and after work hours. She asked overly\n\npersonal questions of OWD employees and gave them unsolicited personal advice. Seals\n\n                                               3\n\fand other employees often discussed sex and sexual orientation. Seals expressed\n\nfrustration that Hurley did not share personal information with her. Seals was also\n\nknown to be a micromanager.\n\n       In January 2011, Hurley met with Seals regarding the addition of her domestic\n\npartner as a beneficiary of her health insurance. On or about September 27, 2011, Seals,\n\nwhile in her office, discussed with Charles Rennie, a DPR nonsupervisory employee,\n\nhow she might more effectively supervise Hurley. During that discussion, Seals\n\ndisclosed to Rennie information from Hurley's personnel file that she had failed her\n\nprobation in a prior job. At the time of the discussion, Hurley was standing outside of\n\nSeals's office, heard Seals discussing her personnel file with Rennie, and saw her\n\npersonnel file open on Seals's desk. Hurley became sick and threw up. She then went to\n\nher office, wrote an email to Dolinar about the incident, and told Seals she was leaving\n\nwork. Hurley went on medical leave the following day, September 28, and never\n\nreturned to work at OWD.2\n\n       In October 2011, Hurley filed a formal discrimination complaint with DPR's\n\nHuman Rights Office (HRO), alleging discrimination, harassment, and retaliation. In\n\nNovember or December, HRO began its investigation of Hurley's complaint. During the\n\ncourse of its investigation, HRO interviewed many employees. In March 2012, Seals was\n\nplaced on administrative leave for one month, which leave was twice extended for\n\n\n\n\n2     Hurley remained on leave until August 2012, when she accepted an SSA position\nat DPR's Monterey location.\n                                            4\n\fadditional one month periods. While on administrative leave, Seals asked Dolinar to\n\ndeliver to her home her (Seals's) supervisory drop file that she had maintained for Hurley\n\nso that she (Seals) could review it in preparation for her upcoming HRO interview\n\nregarding Hurley's complaint. Dolinar agreed and delivered the drop file to Seals at her\n\nhome.\n\n        HRO completed its investigation of Hurley's complaint in May 2012 and informed\n\nHurley and Seals of its determinations. Seals went on medical leave in June and, except\n\nfor a short period in August (during which she worked at DPR's Sacramento office),\n\nremained on medical leave thereafter. In late December, DPR notified Seals that her\n\nemployment was going to be terminated. In January 2013, Seals retired in lieu of\n\ntermination, but never returned the supervisory drop file to DPR.\n\n        In August 2012, Hurley accepted an SSA position at DPR's Monterey location.\n\nOn October 17, 2012, Hurley filed a complaint, alleging causes of action against both\n\nDPR and Seals for: (1) harassment based on sex and sexual orientation in violation of\n\nFEHA; (2) retaliation in violation of FEHA; (3) IIED; and (4) NIED. It also alleged\n\ncauses of action against DPR for: (1) failure to prevent harassment based on sex and\n\nsexual orientation in violation of FEHA; (2) employment discrimination based on sex and\n\nsexual orientation in violation of FEHA; (3) failure to remedy harassment in violation of\n\nFEHA; and (4) negligent hiring, retention, and supervision. On April 29 and 30, 2013,\n\nduring the course of discovery in this case, Seals's counsel delivered to Hurley over 9,000\n\npages of documents, including the supervisory drop file that Seals had retained after her\n\nretirement and given to her (Seals's) counsel. On or about December 20, 2013, Hurley\n\n                                             5\n\ffiled a motion for leave to file a first amended complaint, which would add causes of\n\naction against Defendants for: (1) invasion of constitutional right to privacy; (2) invasion\n\nof privacy by public disclosure; (3) breach of medical confidentiality; and (4) violation of\n\nthe IPA. On that date, the trial court granted Hurley's motion for leave and her first\n\namended complaint was filed. The court subsequently granted in part DPR's motion for\n\nsummary adjudication and dismissed the causes of action against DPR for IIED, NIED,\n\nand negligent hiring, retention, and supervision. The court denied Seals's motion for\n\nsummary adjudication on the four privacy causes of action.\n\n       During a four-week trial, 26 witnesses testified, including Hurley, Seals, and\n\nDolinar, and 71 exhibits were admitted into evidence. The jury returned verdicts in favor\n\nof Defendants on the FEHA causes of action, against Defendants on the IPA cause of\n\naction, and against Seals on the IIED and NIED causes of action. The jury awarded\n\nHurley $19,200 for past economic damages and $19,200 for past noneconomic losses\n\nagainst both Defendants and $28,800 in punitive damages against Seals only. On\n\nDecember 1, 2015, the trial court entered judgment on the jury verdict. On February 5,\n\n2016, the court denied Defendants' JNOV motions.\n\n       Hurley timely filed a notice of appeal. DPR and Seals each filed a timely notice of\n\nappeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                             6\n\f                                      DISCUSSION\n\n                                   HURLEY'S APPEAL\n\n                                              I\n\n                                  Exclusion of Evidence\n\n       Hurley contends the trial court erred by excluding certain evidence that was\n\nrelevant to her FEHA causes of action and therefore the judgment in favor of Defendants\n\non those causes of action must be reversed.\n\n       A.

In her appellant's opening\n\nbrief, Hurley sets forth a virtual \"laundry list\" of certain evidence that was purportedly\n\nwrongly excluded by the court, which list consists of over 120 items of testimony and\n\nexhibits that she argues should have been admitted. In general, she argues those items of\n\nevidence were relevant to her FEHA claims: (1) as \"me too\" evidence under Pantoja v.\n\nAnton (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">198</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

She argues\n\nthe court, in general, abused its discretion under Evidence Code section 352 by excluding\n\nthose items of evidence.\n\n       Importantly, Hurley also argues, in a conclusory manner, that the trial court's\n\nerrors in excluding those items of evidence constituted prejudicial error that requires\n\nreversal of the verdicts against her on the FEHA causes of action.

By so arguing only in a conclusory manner, Hurley wholly\n\nomits any substantive analysis or discussion of how the evidence that was purportedly\n\nwrongly excluded by the trial court probably would have affected the jury's verdicts on\n\nher FEHA causes of action had that evidence been admitted. In particular, she wholly\n\nomits any fair summarization of the evidence that was admitted at trial so that we could\n\nthen consider the question of whether it is reasonably probable she would have obtained a\n\nmore favorable result at trial had the court admitted the evidence that she asserts was\n\nwrongly excluded.

She has not shown the purported evidentiary errors caused a miscarriage of\n\njustice (i.e., it is reasonably probable that she would have obtained a more favorable\n\nresult had the court not so erred).

As discussed ante, an appellant has two\n\nburdens on appeal: (1) to show error; and (2) to show that error was prejudicial. Hurley\n\ncannot carry her dual burdens on appeal by showing only error without additionally\n\nshowing that error was prejudicial. (Pool, supra, 42 Cal.3d at p. 1069; Gould, supra, 192\n\nCal.App.4th at p. 1181; Behrens, supra, 137 Cal.App.3d at p. 575; Eisenberg et al., Cal.\n\nPractice Guide: Civil Appeals and Writs, supra, at ยถ 8:291, p. 8-207.) Because Hurley\n\nhas made no attempt to show the evidentiary errors of which she complains were\n\nprejudicial, she has not carried her burden on appeal to show those errors were prejudicial\n\nand require reversal of the verdicts against her on the FEHA causes of action.4\n\n\n\n4       To the extent Hurley asserts the purported evidentiary errors are reversible per se,\nwe reject that assertion. The California Constitution, pertinent statutes, and long-standing\ncase law all require prejudicial error (i.e., a miscarriage of justice or showing that it is\nreasonably probable that the appellant would have obtained a more favorable result had\nthe trial court not so erred) before a judgment may be reversed based on evidentiary error.\n(Cal.

Rather, Pantoja implicitly applied the Watson standard for\nprejudicial error by discussing the evidence in that case and concluding: \"There is a\nreasonable probability that this [excluded] evidence of Anton's gender bias, which\n                                            14\n\fAccordingly, we affirm the verdicts in favor of Defendants on the FEHA causes of\n\naction.5\n\n                                 DEFENDANTS' APPEALS\n\n                                              II\n\n                     Substantial Evidence to Support the IPA Verdicts\n\n       Defendants contend the trial court erred by denying their JNOV motions because\n\nthere is insufficient evidence to support the jury's verdicts finding them liable for\n\nviolation of the IPA.\n\n       A. The IPA generally.\n\n       Enacted in 1977, the IPA generally limits the right of governmental agencies to\n\ndisclose personal information about an individual and imposes liability on agencies and\n\nindividuals for improperly disclosing personal information maintained by agencies.\n\n(ยงยง 1798.1, subd.

Johnson\ninvolved an appeal from a summary judgment and therefore did not address the question\nof the applicable standard of prejudice for evidentiary error at trial. (Johnson, at pp. 744-\n745, 768.) Therefore, Hurley does not show the trial court's purported evidentiary errors\nwere reversible per se.\n\n5      Even if we were to address the merits of Hurley's assertion that the trial court erred\nby excluding her listed evidence, based on our review of the record we strongly doubt\nthat she carried her burden on appeal to show the court abused its discretion under\nEvidence Code section 352 or otherwise by excluding any of those items of evidence,\nmuch less, as discussed above, that any such purported errors were prejudicial.

Importantly for this appeal, the IPA defines \"personal\n\ninformation\" as \"any information that is maintained by an agency that identifies or\n\ndescribes an individual, including, but not limited to, his or her name, social security\n\nnumber, physical description, home address, home telephone number, education,\n\nfinancial matters, and medical or employment history. It includes statements made by, or\n\nattributed to, the individual.\" (ยง 1798.3, subd. (a).) The IPA defines a \"record\" as \"any\n\nfile or grouping of information about an individual that is maintained by an agency by\n\nreference to an identifying particular such as the individual's name, photograph, finger or\n\nvoice print, or a number or symbol assigned to the individual.\" (ยง 1798.3, subd.

If an agency violates its duties under the IPA, it may be\n\nsubject to liability for damages suffered by an individual. (ยง 1798.45.) Section 1798.45\n\nprovides in part:\n\n          \"An individual may bring a civil action against an agency whenever\n          such agency does any of the following: [ยถ] . . .\n\n          \"(b) Fails to maintain any record concerning any individual with\n          such accuracy, relevancy, timeliness, and completeness as is\n          necessary to assure fairness in any determination relating to the\n          qualifications, character, rights, opportunities of, or benefits to the\n          individual that may be made on the basis of such record, if, as a\n          proximate result of such failure, a determination is made which is\n          adverse to the individual.\n\n          \"(c) Fails to comply with any other provision of this chapter [e.g.,\n          ยง 1798.24], or any rule promulgated thereunder, in such a way as to\n          have an adverse effect on an individual.\" (Italics added.)\n\nLikewise, an individual may also be subject to liability for violation of the IPA.\n\n(ยง 1798.53.) Section 1798.53 provides in part: \"Any person, other than an employee of\n\nthe state or of a local government agency acting solely in his or her official capacity, who\n\nintentionally discloses information, not otherwise public, which they know or should\n\nreasonably know was obtained from personal information maintained by a state\n\n\n\n\n6       Section 1798.21 provides: \"Each agency shall establish appropriate and\nreasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to ensure compliance with\nthe provisions of this chapter, to ensure the security and confidentiality of records, and to\nprotect against anticipated threats or hazards to their security or integrity which could\nresult in any injury.\"\n                                             17\n\fagency . . . shall be subject to a civil action, for invasion of privacy, by the individual to\n\nwhom the information pertains.\"\n\n       B. Defendants' JNOV motions and trial court's order.\n\n       After the jury returned verdicts finding them liable on Hurley's cause of action for\n\nviolation of the IPA, Defendants filed JNOV motions, arguing, inter alia, that there was\n\ninsufficient evidence to support findings that they violated the IPA. DPR argued there\n\nwas insufficient evidence to support findings that it improperly maintained or disclosed\n\nany records containing Hurley's personal information and that she suffered an adverse\n\neffect from its alleged violation of the IPA. In particular, it argued there was insufficient\n\nevidence that the supervisory drop file delivered by Dolinar to Seals contained any\n\npersonal information. It also argued the evidence clearly showed that the drop file was\n\nproperly disclosed to Seals as relevant and necessary in the ordinary course of the\n\nperformance of her supervisory duties. Finally, it argued Hurley did not present\n\nsubstantial evidence showing she suffered an adverse effect from its alleged IPA\n\nviolation, testifying only that she was \"scared\" that Seals had possession of the drop file\n\ncontaining information about her.\n\n       Seals argued there was insufficient evidence to support a finding that she\n\nimproperly disclosed any records containing Hurley's personal information. In particular,\n\nshe argued that her disclosure to Rennie of information regarding Hurley and her (Seals's)\n\nsubsequent receipt of the supervisory drop file were proper because, inter alia, she (Seals)\n\nwas acting solely in her official capacity as a supervisor in so doing.\n\n\n\n                                              18\n\f       Hurley opposed both motions, arguing there was substantial evidence to support\n\nfindings that both DPR and Seals violated the IPA. Hurley argued, inter alia, that there\n\nwas substantial evidence to support findings that the supervisory drop file was a record\n\nthat contained her personal information, that DPR and Seals improperly disclosed her\n\npersonal information, and that she suffered an adverse effect from that disclosure.\n\n       The trial court issued an order denying both JNOV motions, finding there was\n\nsubstantial evidence to support the jury's verdicts finding that both DPR and Seals\n\nviolated the IPA.\n\n       C. Analysis.\n\n       Defendants assert the trial court erred by denying their JNOV motions to vacate\n\nthe verdicts against them on the IPA cause of action because there is insufficient evidence\n\nto support those verdicts.\n\n       \"A motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict may be granted only if it\n\nappears from the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the party securing the\n\nverdict, that there is no substantial evidence in support.

Applying that standard of review to the\n\nevidence admitted at trial, we conclude there is substantial evidence to support the\n\nverdicts against Defendants on Hurley's IPA cause of action. First, contrary to\n\nDefendants' assertion, there is substantial evidence to support a finding by the jury that\n\nSeals maintained on behalf of DPR a record regarding Hurley that contained her personal\n\ninformation within the meaning of the IPA. In particular, the supervisory drop file that\n\nSeals maintained regarding Hurley presumably identified Hurley by her name and\n\ncontained information about her, thereby meeting the IPA's definition of \"record.\"\n\n(ยง 1798.3, subd. (g).) Furthermore, the jury could reasonably infer that the drop file\n\ncontained \"personal information\" within the meaning of that term under the IPA. (Id.,\n\nsubd. (a).) Both Seals and Dolinar testified that a supervisory drop file typically would\n\ncontain work-related notes, counseling memoranda, and other documents regarding\n\ncorrective or disciplinary actions taken by a supervisor (e.g., Seals) and other matters\n\nregarding employees he or she supervises (e.g., Hurley). Furthermore, the jury could\n\nreasonably infer the file also contained a copy of Hurley's application to add her domestic\n\npartner as a beneficiary of her health insurance. That file also contained a note dated\n\nDecember 5, 2011, from Hurley's psychologist placing Hurley on leave for one month.\n\nSeals was also in possession of information, whether originating from Hurley's official\n\npersonnel file or the drop file, that Hurley had failed her probation at a prior job.\n\nAccordingly, there is substantial evidence to support a finding by the jury that Seals and\n\n                                              20\n\fDPR maintained information that \"identifie[d] or describe[d]\" Hurley within the meaning\n\nof section 1798.3, subdivision (a)'s definition of \"personal information.\"\n\n       Contrary to Defendants' assertion, the IPA's definition of \"record\" and \"personal\n\ninformation\" does not restrict an agency's maintenance of qualifying personal information\n\nto only a single, official personnel file. In support of their assertion, Defendants cite\n\nMoghadam v.

However, Moghadam is factually inapposite to this case and, in any event,\n\nwe are not persuaded by its reasoning. The crux of the plaintiff's claim against the\n\ndefendants in Moghadam was that they wrongfully refused to allow him to inspect and\n\nobtain copies of some of the midterm and final exams he took as a UCLA student. (Id. at\n\npp. 469-470.) Following the reasoning of Owasso Independent School District No. 1-011\n\nv. Falvo (2002) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118480\"><a href=\"/opinion/118480/owasso-independent-school-dist-no-i-011-v-falvo/\"><span class=\"volume\">534</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">426</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Falvo), which interpreted and applied the Federal\n\nEducational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), Moghadam concluded the plaintiff's\n\nUCLA exams were not \"records\" under the IPA because they were not institutional\n\nrecords that were \"preserved in the ordinary course of business by a single, central\n\ncustodian.\" (Moghadam, at p. 480.) The court further concluded the plaintiff's exams did\n\nnot contain \"personal information\" under the IPA because they did not identify or\n\ndescribe him, but instead only discussed and analyzed the issues that were the subject of\n\nthe exams. (Id. at p. 483.) It stated: \"[A] record that contains only the individual's name,\n\nwithout any other identifying or descriptive information, is not 'personal information'\n\nwithin the meaning of the IPA.\" (Id. at p. 484.) Accordingly, the court concluded the\n\n\n\n                                              21\n\fplaintiff's student exams were not \"records\" containing \"personal information\" within the\n\nmeaning of the IPA. (Ibid.)\n\n       We decline to adopt Moghadam's interpretation of the term \"records\" under the\n\nIPA. There is nothing in the IPA's language showing that the Legislature intended to\n\nlimit the definition of \"records\" to only documents or other information maintained by an\n\nagency at a single, central location. The IPA defines a \"record\" as \"any file or grouping\n\nof information about an individual that is maintained by an agency by reference to an\n\nidentifying particular such as the individual's name, photograph, finger or voice print, or\n\na number or symbol assigned to the individual.\" (ยง 1798.3, subd. (g).) That definition\n\ndoes not expressly or implicitly include any requirement or limitation that the information\n\nbe maintained at a \"single, central location\" to qualify as a \"record\" under the IPA.\n\nFurthermore, Defendants' proffered interpretation that an agency's \"records\" under the\n\nIPA can only be maintained at a single, central location conflicts with other language in\n\nthe IPA that implicitly recognizes that personal information may be maintained at\n\nmultiple locations. For example, section 1798.34 generally provides individuals with the\n\nright to inspect an agency's records that contains personal information about them. Under\n\nthat statute, an agency is given up to 60 days after a request to permit an individual to\n\ninspect all personal information in \"records that are geographically dispersed.\"7\n\n\n\n\n7     If an agency's records containing personal information are active and not\ngeographically dispersed, the time period for permitting inspection by an individual is\nreduced to 30 days. (ยง 1798.34, subd. (a).)\n\n                                             22\n\f(ยง 1798.34, subd. (a).) It is impossible for records that are geographically dispersed to be\n\nmaintained by an agency at a single, central location. Accordingly, we reject Defendants'\n\nproffered interpretation of the term \"record\" under the IPA as being restricted to only a\n\nsingle, central location, such as the official personnel file maintained by DPR regarding\n\nHurley. Neither Moghadam nor Falvo persuades us to interpret the term \"record\" under\n\nIPA so restrictively. In particular, Falvo, on which Moghadam relied, involved FERPA,\n\na federal statute involving educational rights and definitions of terms different from those\n\nin the IPA.8\n\n       Contrary to Defendants' apparent assertion, there is nothing in the IPA's definition\n\nof \"personal information\" that restricts that information to that maintained by an agency\n\nin a single, central location. The IPA defines \"personal information\" as \"any information\n\nthat is maintained by an agency that identifies or describes an individual, including, but\n\nnot limited to, his or her name, social security number, physical description, home\n\naddress, home telephone number, education, financial matters, and medical or\n\nemployment history. It includes statements made by, or attributed to, the individual.\"\n\n(ยง 1798.3, subd. (a).) That statutory language does not include any geographic restriction\n\nor limitation on the location of the record containing personal information that is\n\nmaintained by an agency.\n\n\n\n8      For example, FERPA defines \"education records\" as \"those records, files,\ndocuments, and other materials which . . . [ยถ] (i) contain information directly related to a\nstudent; and [ยถ] (ii) are maintained by an educational agency or institution or by a\nperson acting for such agency or institution.\" (20 U.S.C. ยง 1232g(a)(4)(A); Moghadam,\nsupra, 169 Cal.App.4th at p. 478.)\n                                             23\n\f       Furthermore, contrary to Defendants' assertion, the information about Hurley that\n\nwas allegedly wrongfully disclosed in this case did not, as in Moghadam, consist solely\n\nof her name without any other identifying or descriptive information. (Cf. Moghadam,\n\nsupra, 169 Cal.App.4th at p. 484.) Rather, as discussed ante, there is substantial\n\nevidence to support a finding by the jury that Seals's supervisory drop file contained: (1)\n\nher work-related notes, counseling memoranda, and other documents regarding corrective\n\nor disciplinary actions and other matters regarding Hurley; (2) a copy of Hurley's\n\napplication to add her domestic partner as a beneficiary of her health insurance; and (3) a\n\nnote dated December 5, 2011, from Hurley's psychologist placing Hurley on leave for\n\none month. Seals also possessed information, whether originating from Hurley's official\n\npersonnel file or the drop file, that Hurley had failed her probation at a prior job. It\n\ncannot be reasonably disputed that the above information \"identifie[d] or describe[d]\"\n\nHurley within the meaning of \"personal information\" under the IPA. (ยง 1798.3, subd.\n\n(a).) Because the personal information that Defendants allegedly wrongfully disclosed\n\ndid not consist only of Hurley's name, Moghadam is factually inapposite and does not\n\nsupport Defendants' assertion that the information disclosed by them did not constitute\n\n\"personal information\" under the IPA.\n\n       Disclosure of personal information. Second, contrary to Defendants' assertion,\n\nthere is substantial evidence to support a finding that they disclosed personal information\n\nabout Hurley in violation of the IPA. In particular, there is substantial evidence that DPR\n\nand/or Seals improperly disclosed Hurley's personal information on at least two\n\noccasions. The evidence showed that on or about September 27, 2011, Seals disclosed to\n\n                                              24\n\fRennie information that she learned from Hurley's personnel file that she (Hurley) had\n\nfailed her probation at a prior job. That information clearly was personal information\n\nwithin the meaning of the IPA. Furthermore, the jury could reasonably find that Seals's\n\ndisclosure of that information to Rennie, a nonsupervisory DPR employee with a lesser\n\nrank than Hurley, was not \"relevant and necessary in the ordinary course of the\n\nperformance of [Seals's or Rennie's] official duties and [was not] related to the purpose\n\nfor which the information was acquired.\" (ยง 1798.24, subd. (d).) Although Defendants\n\nargued at trial that Rennie was Seals's de facto mentor, the jury could nevertheless\n\nreasonably reject Defendants' argument that Seals properly disclosed that personal\n\ninformation to Rennie under the IPA (i.e., the disclosure was relevant and necessary in\n\nthe ordinary course of performance of their official duties).9 (ยง 1798.24, subd. (d).)\n\n\n\n\n9       Furthermore, contrary to Defendants' assertion, the fact that Hurley's counsel in\nclosing argument implicitly referred only to disclosure of the supervisory drop file, and\nnot to the Rennie disclosure, did not preclude the jury from considering evidence that\nshowed violations of the IPA other than their wrongful disclosure of the supervisory drop\nfile and finding liability under the IPA based thereon. In closing, Hurley's counsel\nargued in pertinent part: \"The privacy violations is [sic] really a simple inquiry. Did Ms.\nSeals have a right to maintain and possess documents of Ms. Hurley's that related to her\nwork information, her medical information, her social security information? No. Those\nwere [DPR] documents and they affected her right to privacy. And they were distributed\nin the world, to her attorney.\" Defendants do not cite, and we are unaware of, any case or\nother authority supporting their assertion that counsels' closing arguments necessarily\nlimit what evidence a jury can consider and what legal theories a jury can apply in\ndeciding the issues before it (e.g., liability under the IPA). Therefore, we conclude the\njury could have based its verdicts finding Defendants liable for violations of the IPA on\nevidence other than DPR's alleged wrongful disclosure of the supervisory drop file to\nSeals and Seals's retention and disclosure to her counsel of that file thereafter (e.g.,\nSeals's disclosure to Rennie of Hurley's personal information).\n                                            25\n\f       The evidence also showed that after Seals was placed on administrative leave in\n\nMarch 2012, she asked Dolinar to deliver to her home the supervisory drop file for\n\nHurley so that she (Seals) could review it in preparation for her upcoming HRO interview\n\nregarding Hurley's complaint. Dolinar agreed and delivered the drop file to Seals at her\n\nhome. The jury could reasonably find that Dolinar, on behalf of DPR, improperly\n\ndisclosed to Seals personal information contained in the supervisory drop file regarding\n\nHurley in violation of the IPA. In particular, the jury could reasonably find that because\n\nat the time of that disclosure Seals was on administrative leave, she was not then Hurley's\n\nsupervisor and did not have any other relevant and necessary purpose in the ordinary\n\ncourse of the performance of her duties for the personal information about Hurley that\n\nwas contained in the drop file. (ยง 1798.24, subd. (d).) Although Defendants argued\n\nbelow and again argue on appeal that Seals merely used the drop file to help her prepare\n\nfor her HRO interview regarding Hurley's complaint, the jury could nevertheless\n\nreasonably reject their argument that the disclosure of the drop file's personal information\n\nto Seals for that purpose was \"relevant and necessary in the ordinary course of the\n\nperformance of [her] official duties\" within the meaning of the IPA. (ยง 1798.24, subd.\n\n(d).) Furthermore, as Hurley notes, Seals retained that supervisory drop file after her\n\nHRO interview and even after her retirement from DPR and subsequently gave it to her\n\nattorney in preparing her defense to the instant action. The jury could reasonably find\n\nthat the prolonged continuation of DPR's disclosure of the drop file's information to Seals\n\n(i.e., by not requesting and procuring its return from Seals to DPR) and her disclosure of\n\n\n\n                                            26\n\fthat personal information to her attorney also constituted improper disclosures of\n\npersonal information under the IPA.10 (ยง 1798.24, subd. (d).)\n\n       Adverse effect. Third, contrary to Defendants' assertion, there is substantial\n\nevidence to support a finding that Hurley suffered an adverse effect or adverse effects\n\nfrom their wrongful disclosures of her personal information in violation of the IPA.11 It\n\ncannot reasonably be disputed that emotional distress is one type of adverse effect a\n\n\n\n\n10      To the extent DPR argues in its appellant's reply brief that it could not have\nimproperly disclosed Hurley's personal information to Seals by her retention of the\nsupervisory drop file because she was already familiar with that information and cites\nanalogous federal cases in support of that argument (e.g., Quinn v.

App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">187</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Lachtman), cited by\n\nDPR, is factually inapposite to this case and, in any event, does not hold otherwise.12\n\nContrary to Defendants' assertion, there is substantial evidence to support a finding that\n\nHurley suffered emotional distress as a result of both Seals's disclosure of her personal\n\ninformation to Rennie and DPR's disclosure to Seals of the supervisory drop file and her\n\nretention and disclosure of that file thereafter. Hurley testified that immediately after she\n\nwitnessed Seals's disclosure of her personal information to Rennie, she became sick and\n\nthrew up. Rennie also testified that after that incident Hurley appeared upset and left.\n\nSeals testified that after the Rennie incident Hurley left work early and went home sick.\n\nHurley went on medical leave the following day (i.e., September 28, 2011) and never\n\nreturned to work at OWD.13 Hurley testified at trial that following the Rennie incident\n\nshe was depressed and felt like she was being \"unraveled piece by piece.\" She testified\n\nshe was \"very, very sad\" and began seeing a therapist in October 2011. She testified she\n\ncould not stop crying and could not get out of bed, shower, or perform other basic tasks.\n\n\n\n12     Hurley correctly argues that because the plaintiff in Lachtman did not specifically\nallege any emotional distress damages from the alleged IPA violation, that case does not\nprovide any authority for DPR's apparent assertion that emotional distress suffered from\nan IPA violation cannot be an \"adverse effect\" pursuant to section 1798.45, subdivision\n(c). (Lachtman, supra, 158 Cal.App.4th at pp. 211-212.) Furthermore, because\nLachtman concluded the plaintiff did not prove any IPA violation, its discussion of the\n\"adverse effect\" requirement is dictum and does not provide any persuasive authority for\nDPR's argument. (Id. at p. 212.)\n\n13    As noted above, Hurley remained on leave until August 2012, when she accepted\nan SSA position at DPR's Monterey location.\n                                             28\n\fAccordingly, there is substantial evidence to support a finding that Hurley suffered\n\nemotional distress from Seals's disclosure of her personal information to Rennie.\n\n       There is also substantial evidence to support a finding that Hurley suffered\n\nemotional distress when she learned about DPR's disclosure of the supervisory drop file\n\nto Seals, her retention of that file, and her delivery of it to her attorney. Although\n\nDolinar, on behalf of DPR, delivered the drop file to Seals in March or April 2012 while\n\nshe (Seals) was on administrative leave, Hurley apparently did not learn of that disclosure\n\nof her personal information until Seals and her attorney delivered it to her (Hurley's)\n\nattorney in the course of discovery in the instant action, which delivery apparently\n\noccurred on April 29 or 30, 2013. Hurley then filed her first amended complaint on\n\nDecember 30, 2013, adding a cause of action against Defendants for violation of the IPA.\n\n       At trial, Hurley testified regarding the emotional distress she suffered when she\n\nlearned that Seals, Seals's attorney, and potentially other persons had her personal\n\ninformation contained in the supervisory drop file. Hurley stated she was \"really scared\"\n\nabout the fact that Seals had her personal information. In particular, Hurley stated Seals's\n\npossession of her personal information \"makes me feel like I have to check all the time\n\nand be careful with my credit and with . . . any of my information because she has,\n\nlike, . . . everything. So I feel like even in the future when this is all over, I'm still going\n\nto have to be checking because she still has my stuff.\" Although Hurley's testimony was\n\nrelatively brief on this issue, it nevertheless provided substantial evidence for the jury to\n\nreasonably infer that she suffered emotional distress from the fact that persons (e.g.,\n\nSeals) who should not have possession of her personal information did, in fact, have that\n\n                                               29\n\finformation. Contrary to DPR's assertion, Hurley's testimony that she did not personally\n\nknow what documents were included in the drop file or what Seals may have done with\n\nthe file (other than disclosing it to her attorney) does not show Hurley did not suffer\n\nemotional distress when she learned about DPR's wrongful disclosure of the file's\n\npersonal information.\n\n       Statutes of limitations. Furthermore, we reject DPR's argument that the applicable\n\nstatute of limitations bars any award of noneconomic damages against it. Section\n\n1798.49 generally provides: \"An action to enforce any liability created under Sections\n\n1798.45 to 1798.48, inclusive, may be brought . . . within two years from the date on\n\nwhich the cause of action arises . . . .\" Because section 1798.45 imposes liability on\n\nDPR, as an agency, for disclosing Hurley's personal information in violation of the IPA, a\n\ntwo-year statute of limitations applies to her IPA cause of action against DPR.\n\n(ยง 1798.49.) Therefore, because Hurley filed her first amended complaint on December\n\n30, 2013, adding the IPA cause of action against Defendants, her claim for damages,\n\nwhether economic or noneconomic, generally must be limited to damages arising out of\n\nIPA violations occurring on or after December 30, 2011. (ยง 1798.49.) Accordingly,\n\nHurley's claim for damages for emotional distress that she suffered from DPR's IPA\n\nviolations must be limited to those wrongful disclosures occurring on or after December\n\n30, 2011. Because Seals's disclosure of personal information to Rennie occurred in\n\nSeptember 2011, Hurley's claim for emotional distress damages, and proof of an adverse\n\neffect under section 1798.45, subdivision (c), is limited to DPR's subsequent disclosure of\n\nthe supervisory drop file to Seals in March or April 2012. As we concluded above, there\n\n                                             30\n\fis substantial evidence to support a finding that Hurley suffered emotional distress from\n\nDPR's disclosure of the drop file to Seals who, in turn, disclosed it to her attorney.\n\nBecause DPR's disclosure to Seals of the drop file occurred within the two-year period\n\nbefore Hurley filed her first amended complaint on December 30, 2013, there is\n\nsubstantial evidence to support the jury's finding that Hurley suffered an adverse effect\n\nfrom that disclosure within the meaning of section 1798.45, subdivision (c).\n\nAccordingly, we affirm the jury's award of $19,200 against DPR for past noneconomic\n\ndamages.14\n\n       We also reject Seals's argument that the applicable statute of limitations bars any\n\naward of noneconomic damages against her. Contrary to Seals's apparent assertion, the\n\ntwo-year statute of limitations set forth in section 1798.49 does not apply to her as an\n\nindividual. As quoted above, that statute of limitations applies only to liability imposed\n\nunder sections 1798.45 through 1798.48. (ยง 1798.49.) However, those sections apply\n\nonly to IPA actions against agencies. (See, e.g., ยง 1798.45 [\"An individual may bring a\n\ncivil action against an agency whenever such agency does any of the following . . . .\"].)\n\nHurley's IPA cause of action against Seals, as a nonagency individual, was necessarily\n\nbrought pursuant to section 1798.53.15 Seals does not cite, nor has our review of the IPA\n\n\n\n14     DPR does not make any substantive legal argument showing that the amount of\nnoneconomic damages awarded against it was incorrect or otherwise not supported by\nsubstantial evidence.\n\n15      Section 1798.53 provides in part: \"Any person, other than an employee of the\nstate or of a local government agency acting solely in his or her official capacity, who\nintentionally discloses information, not otherwise public, which they know or should\n                                             31\n\ffound, any provision in the IPA that expressly sets forth a statute of limitations that\n\napplies to IPA causes of action filed against individuals pursuant to section 1798.53.\n\nAccordingly, Code of Civil Procedure section 338, subdivision (a), the default statute of\n\nlimitations that generally applies to actions for personal injuries based on statutory\n\nviolations, necessarily applies to Hurley's IPA cause of action against Seals. That statute\n\nsets forth a three-year statute of limitations for \"[a]n action upon a liability created by\n\nstatute . . . .\" (Code Civ. Proc., ยง 338, subd. (a).) Because Hurley's IPA cause of action\n\nagainst Seals was necessarily based on her (Seals's) alleged liability under section\n\n1798.53, that alleged liability was based on \"a liability created by statute\" and therefore a\n\nthree-year statute of limitations applies to that cause of action. (Code Civ. Proc., ยง 338,\n\nsubd. (a).)\n\n       Applying that three-year statute of limitations to the evidence of Hurley's\n\nemotional distress or other adverse effects that she suffered as a result of Seals's wrongful\n\ndisclosure of her (Hurley's) personal information, we conclude Hurley's first amended\n\ncomplaint, filed on December 30, 2013, and adding the IPA cause of action against Seals,\n\nwas timely filed as to Seals's wrongful disclosures occurring on or after December 30,\n\n2010. Because both of Seals's wrongful disclosures discussed above (i.e., the Rennie\n\ndisclosure in September 2011 and drop file disclosure to her attorney apparently in April\n\n2013) occurred within that time period, the three-year statute of limitations that applies to\n\n\n\n\nreasonably know was obtained from personal information maintained by a state\nagency . . . , shall be subject to a civil action, for invasion of privacy, by the individual to\nwhom the information pertains.\"\n                                               32\n\fHurley's IPA cause of action against Seals did not bar any liability the jury imposed on\n\nher for emotional distress or other damages Hurley suffered as a result of the Rennie\n\ndisclosure and/or Seals's disclosure of the supervisory drop file to her attorney. Because\n\nthere is substantial evidence, as discussed ante, to support the jury's finding that Hurley\n\nsuffered emotional distress and thus an adverse effect or effects, from either or both of\n\nthose disclosures, we affirm the jury's award of $19,200 against Seals for past\n\nnoneconomic damages.16\n\n       Although we concluded, ante, that there is substantial evidence to support a\n\nfinding Hurley suffered an adverse effect in the form of emotional distress damages\n\nresulting from DPR's wrongful disclosure to Seals of her (Hurley's) personal information\n\ncontained in the supervisory drop file, we nevertheless conclude there is insufficient\n\nevidence to support a finding Hurley suffered an adverse effect in the form of economic\n\ndamages resulting from that disclosure. At trial, Hurley presented evidence of economic\n\ndamages that she suffered as a result of the Rennie disclosure in September 2011, which\n\nclaim for damages against DPR was, as discussed ante, barred by the section 1798.49\n\ntwo-year statute of limitations. In particular, Hurley testified that at the time she went on\n\nleave (i.e., September 28, 2011) her gross salary was $3,841 per month. She further\n\ntestified she was on leave without pay from that date through about August 2012, when\n\nshe accepted a position at DPR's Monterey location. However, the record does not\n\n\n\n16     Seals does not make any substantive legal argument showing that the amount of\nnoneconomic damages awarded against her was incorrect or otherwise not supported by\nsubstantial evidence.\n                                             33\n\fcontain any evidence showing Hurley suffered any economic damages following her\n\ndiscovery on April 29 or 30, 2013, that DPR had disclosed to Seals the supervisory drop\n\nfile when Seals was on administrative leave. The jury's award of $19,200 in economic\n\ndamages closely correlates with Hurley's evidence showing she lost wages of $3,841 per\n\nmonth, presumably during the five-month period while she was on leave until Seals\n\nherself went on leave and was no longer her supervisor (i.e., from October 2011 through\n\nFebruary 2012). Because five months of lost wages of $3,840 per month totals economic\n\ndamages of $19,200, we presume the jury calculated Hurley's economic damages based\n\non that five-month period of lost wages. However, those economic damages were based\n\non Defendants' September 2011 wrongful disclosure to Rennie of Hurley's personal\n\ninformation, which disclosure, as discussed ante, preceded the two-year statute of\n\nlimitations period applicable to DPR pursuant to section 1798.49. Therefore, any adverse\n\neffect resulting from that wrongful disclosure cannot provide the basis for an award of\n\neconomic damages against DPR. Because Hurley did not present substantial evidence\n\nshowing she suffered any economic damages as a result of her discovery in April 2013 of\n\nDPR's wrongful disclosure to Seals of the supervisory drop file or as a result of any other\n\npost-December 30, 2011, wrongful disclosure, we conclude there is insufficient evidence\n\nto support the jury's award of $19,200 in economic damages against DPR. Accordingly,\n\nthat part of the judgment must be stricken.17\n\n\n\n\n17    Because Seals does not, and could not persuasively, argue the jury's award of\n$19,200 in economic damages against her is barred by the statute of limitations\n                                            34\n\f                                             III\n\n                      Section 47, Subdivision (b), Litigation Privilege\n\n       Defendants also contend the trial court erred by denying their JNOV motions\n\nbecause the litigation privilege under section 47, subdivision (b), barred Hurley's IPA\n\ncause of action against them. In particular, they argue Hurley's IPA cause of action was\n\nbased solely on DPR's disclosure of the supervisory drop file to Seals in March or April\n\n2012 and her retention of that file and disclosure of it to her attorney thereafter, which\n\ndisclosures Hurley discovered in April 2013. However, because Seals's liability as an\n\nindividual defendant is supported by substantial evidence that she wrongfully disclosed\n\nHurley's personal information to Rennie on or about September 27, 2011, the IPA verdict\n\nagainst Seals can be affirmed based on that disclosure alone and therefore we need not\n\naddress whether she (Seals) can assert the litigation privilege against the IPA cause of\n\naction based on Hurley's discovery in April 2013 that DPR wrongfully disclosed to Seals\n\nthe supervisory drop file and Seals wrongfully retained that file and disclosed it to her\n\nattorney thereafter. In any event, because DPR's IPA liability can, as discussed ante, be\n\naffirmed solely on its disclosure to Seals of the supervisory drop file, we nevertheless\n\naddress the merits of the contention that Defendants' disclosures of that drop file were\n\nprotected by the litigation privilege under section 47, subdivision (b).\n\n\n\n\napplicable to Hurley's IPA claim against her, we affirm that award of economic damages\nagainst Seals.\n                                             35\n\f                                              A\n\n       The litigation privilege under section 47, subdivision (b), provides an affirmative\n\ndefense to defendants for liability based on certain communications made in legislative,\n\njudicial, or other official proceedings authorized by law. \"[T]he privilege applies to any\n\ncommunication (1) made in judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings; (2) by litigants or other\n\nparticipants authorized by law; (3) to achieve the objects of the litigation; and (4) that\n\nhave some connection or logical relation to the action.\" (Silberg v.

For example, the litigation privilege has been\n\napplied to the filing of false declarations of service to obtain a default judgment. (Id. at p.\n\n1052.) \"[T]he key in determining whether the privilege applies is whether the injury\n\nallegedly resulted from an act that was communicative in its essential nature.\" (Id. at p.\n\n1058.) Furthermore, \"if the gravamen of the action is communicative, the litigation\n\n                                              36\n\fprivilege extends to noncommunicative acts that are necessarily related to the\n\ncommunicative conduct . . . . Stated another way, unless it is demonstrated that an\n\nindependent, noncommunicative, wrongful act was the gravamen of the action, the\n\nlitigation privilege applies.\" (Id. at p. 1065.) \"The following acts have been deemed\n\nnoncommunicative and thus unprivileged: prelitigation illegal recording of confidential\n\ntelephone conversations [citation]; eavesdropping on a telephone conversation [citation];\n\nand physician's negligent examination of patient causing physical injury [citation].\" (Id.\n\nat p. 1058.)\n\n                                               B\n\n       Defendants repeatedly asserted below the affirmative defense of the litigation\n\nprivilege to Hurley's IPA cause of action, but the trial court rejected its applicability to\n\nthe circumstances in this case. Because the gravamen of Hurley's IPA cause of action\n\nwas Defendants' noncommunicative act or acts of disclosure or transfer of her personal\n\ninformation in violation of the IPA, we conclude the litigation privilege does not apply to\n\npreclude their liability under the IPA. In particular, DPR's noncommunicative conduct of\n\ntransferring the supervisory drop file to Seals resulted in Hurley's injury under the IPA.\n\nLikewise, Seals's subsequent noncommunicative conduct of transferring the drop file to\n\nher attorney also resulted in injury to Hurley under the IPA. Contrary to Defendants'\n\nassertion, their wrongful conduct was not communicative in its essential nature.\n\n(Rusheen, supra, 37 Cal.4th at p. 1058.) Defendants' transfers of the supervisory drop\n\nfile to unauthorized persons in violation of the IPA is similar to other acts that have been\n\ndeemed noncommunicative and thus unprivileged, such as prelitigation illegal recording\n\n                                              37\n\fof confidential telephone conversations and eavesdropping on a telephone conversation.\n\n(Ibid.)\n\n          In Kimmel v. Goland (1990) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2608831\"><a href=\"/opinion/2608831/kimmel-v-goland/\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">202</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Kimmel), the court concluded the\n\nnoncommunicative acts of illegal recording of confidential telephone conversations were\n\nnot privileged under former section 47, subdivision (2), which was the predecessor to\n\nsection 47, subdivision (b). (Kimmel, at p. 205.) That tortious conduct was not\n\nprivileged even though it was done for the purpose of gathering evidence for future\n\nlitigation. (Ibid.) Kimmel stated: \"[P]ark management seeks statutory damages under\n\nPenal Code section 637.2 not for injuries arising from the broadcast and publication of\n\nprivate conversations, but from the recording of them. Moreover, since park\n\nmanagement's right to a statutory remedy accrued at the moment of the violation,\n\nplaintiffs' contention that the telephone conversations were made in anticipation of\n\nlitigation is simply irrelevant.\" (Kimmel, at p. 212.) As support for its conclusion,\n\nKimmel discussed an analogous hypothetical situation in which a prospective plaintiff\n\nengaged in prelitigation criminal conduct, stating:\n\n             \"Suppose, a prospective defendant kept important documents at\n             home. If a prospective plaintiff, in anticipation of litigation,\n             burglarized defendant's premises in order to obtain evidence,\n             plaintiffs here would apparently apply the privilege to protect the\n             criminal conduct. Such an extension of [former] section 47(2) is\n             untenable.\" (Kimmel, supra, 51 Cal.3d at p. 212.)\n\nAccordingly, Kimmel rejected the plaintiffs' argument that the litigation privilege\n\nprotected them from liability for their prelitigation, noncommunicative conduct in\n\nviolation of a statute. (Kimmel, supra, 51 Cal.3d at pp. 205, 212.)\n\n\n                                               38\n\f       We believe the conduct in this case is more similar to the nonprivileged,\n\nnoncommunicative conduct in Kimmel than the privileged communications or\n\npublications in the cases cited by Defendants (e.g., Rusheen, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2582746\"><a href=\"/opinion/2582746/rusheen-v-cohen/\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1048</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">;\n\nJacob B., supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2626972\"><a href=\"/opinion/2626972/jacob-b-v-county-of-shasta/\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">948</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">). As discussed ante, the gravamen of Hurley's IPA cause\n\nof action is Defendants' violation of the IPA by transferring or disclosing her personal\n\ninformation, which conduct is noncommunicative in its essential nature. (Rusheen, at p.\n\n1058.) As in Kimmel, Hurley's \"right to a statutory remedy accrued at the moment of\n\n[Defendants' statutory] violation\" when they transferred her personal information to an\n\nunauthorized person or persons, and Defendants' assertion that such noncommunicative\n\nconduct was done in the course of the HRO investigation or in anticipation of litigation\n\n(i.e., Hurley's future lawsuit) is irrelevant.

Accordingly, we conclude the section 47, subdivision (b), litigation\n\nprivilege does not apply to protect Defendants from liability for their violations of the\n\nIPA in this case.\n\n                                             IV\n\n                       Seals's IPA Liability Under Section 1798.53\n\n       Seals contends that the trial court erred by denying her JNOV motion because\n\nHurley's IPA cause of action against her was alleged under, and the jury was instructed\n\non, a statute (i.e., ยง 1798.45) that was inapplicable to her. She argues that because she\n\n                                             39\n\fcould be found liable as an individual only under section 1798.53 and the jury was\n\ninstructed only on liability under section 1798.45, the IPA verdict against her must be\n\nreversed.\n\n                                                A\n\n          Hurley's first amended complaint, which added the IPA cause of action against\n\nDefendants, alleged violations of the IPA, but did not cite the specific statutes imposing\n\nliability on DPR as an agency (ยง 1798.45) or Seals as an individual (ยง 1798.53).\n\nHowever, Hurley proposed separate jury instructions for DPR's alleged IPA liability as an\n\nagency and Seals's alleged IPA liability as an individual, specifically citing as authority\n\nthe applicable statutes imposing their alleged respective liability (i.e., ยงยง 1798.45 &\n\n1798.53). DPR presented its own proposed instruction on the IPA cause of action. In\n\ndiscussing those proposed instructions at the beginning of the trial, the trial court and the\n\nparties' counsel specifically discussed the different bases for liability of an agency\n\n(ยง 1798.45) and an individual under the IPA (ยง 1798.53). Following a recess, the parties'\n\ncounsel informed the court that they had agreed on instructions for the IPA cause of\n\naction.\n\n          On conclusion of the trial, the court then instructed the jury on the IPA cause of\n\naction, paraphrasing section 1798.45 and stating in pertinent part:\n\n             \"Ms. Hurley claims that [DPR] and/or Ms. Seals violated the [IPA]\n             by disclosing records that contain her personal information.

The first amended complaint did not specify the particular statute of the IPA\n\nunder which Hurley sought to impose liability on Seals. Furthermore, at the beginning of\n\nthe trial, Hurley proposed instructions that expressly sought to impose liability on Seals\n\nas an individual under section 1798.53.18 Nevertheless, based on the agreement of all\n\nparties' counsel, the trial court instructed the jury on Hurley's IPA cause of action against\n\nDefendants using language from section 1798.45 and not section 1798.53. To the extent\n\n\n\n\n18     As quoted above, section 1798.53 provides in part: \"Any person, other than an\nemployee of the state or of a local government agency acting solely in his or her official\ncapacity, who intentionally discloses information, not otherwise public, which they know\nor should reasonably know was obtained from personal information maintained by a state\nagency . . . shall be subject to a civil action, for invasion of privacy, by the individual to\nwhom the information pertains.\"\n                                             41\n\fSeals argues the court erred by so doing and/or that Hurley, in effect, forfeited any claim\n\nagainst her based on section 1798.53, Seals waived or forfeited, and apparently even\n\ninvited, any such error by the court or forfeiture by Hurley because Seals implicitly, if not\n\nexpressly, agreed to that instruction and did not timely object to the instruction given by\n\nthe court or request clarifying language regarding Hurley's IPA claim against her as an\n\nindividual.

Because Seals presumably adopted a deliberate trial\n\nstrategy by not objecting to the incomplete or inapplicable instructions and not requesting\n\nadditional or clarifying instructions on the IPA claim against her, Seals may not now on\n\nappeal use that tactical decision to claim prejudicial error and obtain reversal of the jury's\n\nverdict on the IPA cause of action against her. (Cf. Mesecher, supra, 9 Cal.App.4th at p.\n\n1686.) Accordingly, although we presume the trial court erroneously instructed on\n\nSeals's alleged liability under the IPA by giving an instruction only on section 1798.45\n\nand not on section 1798.53, we nevertheless conclude Seals cannot raise that error on\n\nappeal, nor can she raise the issue of whether, based on the instructions given, Hurley\n\nmistakenly sought liability against her under section 1798.45 rather than under section\n\n1798.53.\n\n       Based on the same reasoning, ante, we further conclude Seals cannot raise her\n\nalternative argument that there is insufficient evidence that would have supported a\n\nfinding by the jury that she was liable under section 1798.53. Although section 1798.53\n\nliability requires a finding that Seals \"intentionally\" disclosed personal information in\n\nviolation of the IPA, the jury was not instructed on that requirement because of her\n\n                                              43\n\ffailure to request additional or clarifying instructions setting forth that and other\n\nrequirements under section 1978.53.

In particular, she argues there is insufficient evidence that she\n\nengaged in any extreme and outrageous conduct that would support her IIED liability.\n\n                                              A\n\n       The trial court instructed the jury with CACI No. 1600 on the IIED cause of\n\naction, stating:\n\n           \"[Hurley] claims that [Seals's] conduct caused her to suffer severe\n           emotional distress.

That [Seals's] conduct was outrageous;\n\n\n\n                                              44\n\f          \"2.

Conduct is outrageous if a reasonable person would\n\nregard the conduct as intolerable in a civilized community. Outrageous conduct does not\n\ninclude trivialities such as indignities, annoyances, hurt feelings, or bad manners that a\n\nreasonable person is expected to endure. . . .\" The court also instructed with CACI No.\n\n1603 on reckless disregard and CACI No. 1604 on severe emotional distress. The court\n\nalso instructed with CACI Nos. 1620 and 401 on the NIED cause of action. The jury\n\nreturned verdicts finding Seals liable on the IIED and NIED causes of action.\n\n                                             B\n\n       We conclude there is substantial evidence to support the jury's verdicts finding\n\nSeals liable on the IIED and NIED causes of action. In particular, as discussed ante,\n\nthere is evidence showing Hurley was outside of Seals's office when Seals discussed with\n\nRennie, a nonsupervisory DPR employee with a lesser rank than Hurley, information that\n\nHurley had failed her probation at a prior job. Immediately after witnessing that\n\nconversation, Hurley became ill, threw up, and left work for the remainder of the day,\n\nand she went on medical leave the following day. In addition, there was trial testimony\n\n                                             45\n\fthat while at a Sacramento hotel on a DPR business trip, Seals \"flashed\" her breasts in the\n\npresence of Hurley and others. Hurley also testified that when she told Seals that she\n\nwould be adding her domestic partner as a beneficiary of her health insurance, Seals\n\nreplied: \"So, you really like boobs better?\" Hurley also testified about other comments\n\nSeals made about her (Hurley's) sexual orientation and style of hair and clothing.\n\n       Contrary to Seals's assertion, evidence of her receipt and retention of the\n\nsupervisory drop file and subsequent transfer of that file to her attorney was not the\n\n\"only\" evidence in support of the jury's finding that Hurley suffered emotional distress.\n\nAs summarized ante, Hurley witnessed Seals discussing with Rennie her personal\n\ninformation (i.e., Hurley's failure of probation at a prior job), witnessed Seals flashing her\n\nbreasts, and was subjected to Seals's many comments about her sexual orientation and\n\nappearance. The jury could reasonably find that that evidence of Seals's conduct was\n\noutrageous conduct so as to support a finding against Seals on the IIED cause of action.\n\nAlthough Seals does not expressly address the sufficiency of the evidence to support the\n\njury's verdict on the NIED cause of action, we likewise conclude the jury could\n\nreasonably find that the evidence, ante, of Seals's conduct was also sufficient to support a\n\nfinding against Seals on the NIED cause of action (i.e., that Seals was negligent in\n\ncausing Hurley serious emotional distress). Because there is substantial evidence to\n\nsupport the IIED and NIED verdicts against Seals, the trial court did not err by denying\n\nSeals's JNOV motion on the ground of insufficiency of the evidence.\n\n       To the extent Seals also argues the jury's verdicts improperly allowed Hurley to\n\nreceive a double recovery for her emotional distress damages, the record does not support\n\n                                             46\n\fthat argument. The jury was given only one verdict form asking it to calculate Hurley's\n\npast noneconomic damages, which form was not specific to a particular cause of action.\n\nThe jury awarded Hurley a single amount of $19,200 for her past noneconomic damages\n\n(e.g., emotional distress damages). Therefore, contrary to Seals's assertion, Hurley was\n\nnot awarded double damages for the emotional distress she suffered based on her IPA,\n\nIIED, and/or NIED causes of action.\n\n                                            VI\n\n                       Workers' Compensation Exclusivity Doctrine\n\n       Seals contends the trial court erred by denying her JNOV motion because the\n\nworkers' compensation exclusivity doctrine necessarily applied to bar the IIED and NIED\n\ncauses of action against her.\n\n                                             A\n\n       Labor Code section 3602, subdivision (a),19 generally provides that employees\n\nmay seek compensation for job-related injuries against their employers only through the\n\nworkers' compensation system. In the context of emotional distress injuries, the\n\nCalifornia Supreme Court has held: \"So long as the basic conditions of compensation are\n\notherwise satisfied (Lab. Code, ยง 3600), and the employer's conduct neither contravenes\n\nfundamental public policy [citation] nor exceeds the risks inherent in the employment\n\n\n\n\n19        Labor Code section 3602, subdivision (a), provides: \"Where the conditions of\ncompensation set forth in Section 3600 concur, the right to recover compensation\nis . . . the sole and exclusive remedy of the employee or his or her dependents against the\nemployer. . . .\"\n                                            47\n\frelationship [citation], an employee's emotional distress injuries are subsumed under the\n\nexclusive remedy provisions of workers' compensation.\" (Livitsanos v.

Therefore, if a plaintiff's emotional distress\n\ninjuries occurred \"at the worksite, in the normal course of the employer-employee\n\nrelationship,\" the workers' compensation exclusivity doctrine will apply to bar an\n\nindependent action for intentional and/or negligent infliction of emotional distress.\n\n(Miklosy v.

In particular,\n\nthe court instructed:\n\n          \"To succeed on this defense, [Seals] must prove all of the following:\n\n          \"1. That the harm sustained by [Hurley] arose from the normal part\n          of the employment relationship between [Hurley] and [DPR];\n\n          \"2. That [DPR] had workers' compensation [insurance] covering\n          [Hurley] at the time of the harm or was self-insured for workers'\n          compensation at the time of [Hurley's] harm; and\n\n          \"3. That [Seals] was acting in the scope of her employment at the\n          time [Hurley] claims she was harmed.\"\n\nBy finding Seals liable under the IIED and NIED causes of action, the jury necessarily\n\nfound that the workers' compensation exclusivity doctrine did not apply and, in\n\nparticular, that Hurley's emotional distress damages did not arise from the normal part of\n\nher employment relationship.\n\n                                              C\n\n       Contrary to Seals's apparent assertion, we conclude there is substantial evidence to\n\nsupport the jury's finding that the workers' compensation exclusivity doctrine did not\n\napply to bar Hurley's IIED and NIED causes of action against her. The jury could\n\nreasonably find that Seals's initial receipt, retention, and subsequent delivery to her\n\nattorney of the supervisory drop file containing Hurley's personal information while she\n\n(Seals) was on administrative leave and medical leave and after her retirement exceeded\n\nthe risks inherent in Hurley's employment relationship and did not occur at the workplace\n\n                                             49\n\fin the normal course of the employer-employee relationship. (Livitsanos, supra,\n\n2 Cal.4th at p. 754; Miklosy, supra, 44 Cal.4th at p. 902.) Seals's conduct violated the\n\nIPA and did not occur either at the workplace or while she was acting as Hurley's\n\nsupervisor or otherwise within the scope of her (Seals's) employment. Furthermore,\n\nSeals's conduct was contrary to the IPA's fundamental public policy against improper\n\ndisclosures of personal information maintained by agencies. (ยง 1798.1 [\"the right to\n\nprivacy is a personal and fundamental right\"]; cf. Johnson, supra, 110 Cal.App.4th at p.\n\n191 [workers' compensation exclusivity doctrine did not bar action for violation of\n\nemployee's constitutional right to privacy]; Livitsanos, at p. 754 [recognizing\n\nfundamental public policy exception to workers' compensation exclusivity doctrine].)\n\nTherefore, contrary to Seals's assertion, the jury could reasonably find that the emotional\n\ndistress that Hurley suffered on discovery that Seals had possession of the supervisory\n\ndrop file containing her personal information and had delivered it to her attorney (and\n\npossibly others) was not a normal part of Hurley's employment relationship for which the\n\nworkers' compensation exclusivity doctrine applied.20 Accordingly, the trial court did\n\nnot err by denying Seals's JNOV motion on the grounds of the workers' compensation\n\nexclusivity doctrine.\n\n\n\n\n20       Although Seals's conduct regarding the supervisory drop file was sufficient, in\nitself, to support the IIED and NIED verdicts against her, there was also other conduct\n(e.g., Seals's flashing her breasts to Hurley and others at a hotel) that was not a normal\npart of Hurley's employment and not protected by the workers' compensation exclusivity\ndoctrine and therefore could provide additional support for the jury's verdicts on the IIED\nand NIED causes of action.\n                                            50\n\f                                             VII\n\n                          Punitive Damages Award Against Seals\n\n       Seals contends the trial court erred by denying her JNOV motion because it erred\n\nin instructing the jury on punitive damages and there was insufficient evidence to support\n\nan award of punitive damages against her. In particular, she argues the court failed to\n\ninstruct that Hurley had the burden to show by \"clear and convincing evidence\" that she\n\nacted with oppression, fraud, or malice, which showing is required for an award of\n\npunitive damages.\n\n                                              A\n\n       Section 3294, subdivision (a), provides: \"In an action for the breach of an\n\nobligation not arising from contract, where it is proven by clear and convincing evidence\n\nthat the defendant has been guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice, the plaintiff, in addition\n\nto the actual damages, may recover damages for the sake of example and by way of\n\npunishing the defendant.\" (Italics added.) \"Malice\" is defined as \"conduct which is\n\nintended by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or despicable conduct which is\n\ncarried on by the defendant with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety\n\nof others.\" (ยง 3294, subd.

The court instructed with CACI No. 3941, stating:\n\n           \"If you decide that [Seals's] conduct toward [Hurley] caused\n           [Hurley] harm, you must decide whether that conduct justifies an\n           award of punitive damages.
