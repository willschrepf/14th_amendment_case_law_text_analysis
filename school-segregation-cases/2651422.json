After the district court bound defendant\nover on unarmed robbery and assault charges, the circuit court questioned whether defendant was\ncompetent to stand trial. Initial examination supported defendant’s current incompetency but\nrevealed that defendant potentially could be rendered competent to stand trial within 15 months\nif provided appropriate treatment. For the next two months, defendant remained in county jail\nbecause no vacancies opened at an appropriate psychiatric facility. The circuit court then\ndetermined that the delay in treatment made it impossible to have defendant ready for trial within\nthe statutory period and dismissed the charges against defendant without prejudice. Because the\ncircuit court lacked statutory authority to dismiss the case over the prosecutor’s objections, we\nreverse.\n\n                                       I. BACKGROUND\n\n       On the afternoon of April 15, 2013, then 17-year-old defendant, along with six other\nyoung men, “jumped” a 16-year-old autistic boy and stole his portable gaming system. Detroit\npolice arrested defendant three days later. Defendant waived his rights and admitted, but\nminimized, his role in the attack. Following preliminary examination, the district court bound\ndefendant over for trial on charges of unarmed robbery and assault with intent to commit great\nbodily harm less than murder.\n\n       On June 6, 2013, the circuit court issued an “order for competency examination” to\ndetermine whether defendant was competent to stand trial. Defendant was released on bond until\nhis examination at the Center for Forensic Psychiatry (CFP). On July 27, 2013, family members\ntransported defendant to the center, where he met with a licensed psychologist, Cathie\nZmachinski. Accepting reports that defendant was “moderately impaired,” Zmachinski noted:\n\n\n                                               -1-\n\f       [Defendant] showed limited comprehension of questions. So, I simplified my\n       questions and comments which facilitated his understanding. His responses were\n       relevant but brief, usually only three to four words long. His thoughts were\n       coherent.     He required direct questioning in order to obtain related\n       information. . . . [Defendant] demonstrated other cognitive difficulties. He\n       showed limited abstract reasoning. He showed limited understanding of the world\n       around him. He showed limitations in expressing himself. He demonstrated\n       immature interests. . . . He also showed a tendency to agree without regard to the\n       specific content of some questions. Based on his clinical presentation and\n       understanding of his world, [defendant] appeared to be functioning in the mild\n       mentally retarded range. Additionally, he gave the indication that he was able to\n       process more information than indicated by his verbal responses.\n\nZmachinski described defendant’s memory deficits. In addition, she opined, “Besides his limited\ninsight into his cognitive abilities he showed limited insight into his affective life.”\n\n        Zmachinski also interviewed defendant’s mother, Tiffany Davis. Davis reported that\ndefendant had received special education services since kindergarten, was restless and had\ndifficulty staying on task at home. Davis indicated that defendant had been incarcerated for two\nmonths before being released on bond. During that time, the other inmates took advantage of\ndefendant and “beat [him] up.”\n\n       In relation to defendant’s competency to stand trial, Zmachinski opined:\n\n               It is my opinion that [defendant] has a limited understanding of the nature\n       and object of the proceedings against him. He was asked some questions about\n       the criminal justice system and in particular about his legal case. He\n       demonstrated the following. He said he could not remember the charges against\n       him. But he could acknowledge them. He was aware of the circumstances from\n       which those charges arose. When asked specifically, he claimed not to know\n       what happens were he to be found guilty or the maximum penalty given his\n       charges. He could recall his attorney “Came to my house-asked about my job-\n       same as you.” [Defendant] further indicated his mother was with him while\n       talking to his attorney, “She does a lot of talking.” He said he did not know the\n       jobs of the prosecutor or judge. He could not give an explanation of a plea\n       bargain or the essence of a trial. He did however say if you believe the witness\n       was lying, he would tell his attorney. Due to his limited expressive knowledge\n       about the legal system, he was given the CAST-MR. This measure is designed\n       for those with mental retardation. Individuals are asked questions about the\n       criminal justice system in a multiple choice format. Also they are asked questions\n       about various scenarios regarding the legal process. On this measure, [defendant]\n       could correctly identify the basic job of the witness, judge but not the jury, his\n       attorney and the prosecutor. He could identify such words as “Sentence, crime,\n       penitentiary, felony, misdemeanor, and time served.” He knew that if found\n       guilty, it would mean the prosecutor proved he did it. He could not identify plea\n       bargaining. Thus, he demonstrated greater knowledge about the system than\n       when asked more open ended questions. But he continued to show some limited\n\n                                               -2-\n\fknowledge. [Defendant] also was given various problematic scenarios related to\nlegal charges and arrest. He showed in his answers that he was capable of being\nprotective of himself in the jail and with the prosecutor. But he showed some\nproblems with situations requiring more than a black and white reasoning. His\noverall performance suggested he knows more about the process than he was able\nto express. Yet his knowledge was, in my opinion, still considered limited.\n\n        In regards to his ability to assist defense counsel in a rational manner,\nagain it is my opinion that this would be limited. To his favor, [defendant]\nprovided a rendition of the incident in question, one similar to that in the police\naccount. He could answer some questions but not others, including his\nunderstanding of his behaviors at that time. He was aware of some important\nelements about his case. For example, he kept repeating important aspects of the\nassaulted boy’s testimony. Although he could not elaborate why this was\nimportant, he seemed aware on a basic level that this testimony suggested he had\nminimal involvement in the crime. [Defendant] also showed an ability to control\nhis behavior within the interview. He also did not demonstrate emotional\ndifficulties. [Defendant] showed limitations in problem-solving and decision-\nmaking. He did better when he was given simple choices and the problem was\nspelled out for him. [Defendant] was quite passive. Given his cognitive abilities\nand limited knowledge of the legal process, it is my opinion [defendant] would\nnot communicate his concerns sufficiently to his attorney. He would not\nunderstand what has been said if more than simple language was used. Given his\nlimited knowledge of the process, this would further limit his comprehension of\nthe process as well as communications with his attorney. It is my opinion were he\nmore knowledgeable about the process he may be less passive and might express\nsome of his concerns. But nonetheless at the current time, it is my opinion that\n[defendant], due to his cognitive limitations as well as passivity would have\nsignificant difficulty assisting his attorney to resolve the current charges.\n\n        In summary, due to limited cognitive abilities although [defendant]\nshowed some knowledge about the criminal justice system, in my opinion it was\ninsufficient to be considered him [sic] capable of understanding the nature and\nobject of the proceedings against him. Additionally, again due to this limited\nknowledge and limited cognitive abilities, it is my opinion that he would have\nproblems assisting defense counsel in a rational manner. Therefore, it is my\nopinion that [defendant] was incompetent to stand trial.\n\n        The next question becomes whether there is a substantial probability that\n[defendant] could be expected to regain his competency within [the] time period\nprovided by statute and if he were provided with a structured, inpatient, hospital\nsetting with the provision of appropriate therapeutic intervention. It is my opinion\n[defendant] has some skills which he can draw upon to learn more about the legal\nprocess. So with education and treatment, he may acquire a greater knowledge of\nthe process. Additionally given his cognitive skills as being measured in the\nmoderately impaired range, I anticipate that his will take some time. But, it is my\nopinion that he would be able to gain the knowledge required. With that\n\n                                        -3-\n\f       knowledge, it is my opinion he would likely be able, in a basic way, to work with\n       his attorney to resolve the current charges.\n\nThis report was submitted to the circuit court on August 8, 2013. An August 9, 2013 letter from\nthe CFP director recommended that defendant be treated at Kalamazoo Psychiatric Hospital.\n\n        At an August 22, 2013 hearing on the matter, the circuit court followed the CFP’s\nrecommendation. However, the court noted, “I’m not completely sold on their conclusion about\nhis ability to . . . attain . . . [c]omptency. And my opinion is based on the fact that they have not\nreceived his school records and they have not received the Wayne County Jail information that\nthey have requested.” The court directed, “I’m going to have him placed there,” meaning the\npsychiatric hospital. The court then stated its intent to schedule a hearing “within the time period\nprescribed by law” to determine if defendant had attained competency. Defendant was returned\nto court custody that day and was transported back to the Wayne County Jail to await transport to\nthe Kalamazoo Psychiatric Hospital. The court’s subsequent order provided:\n\n       8. Commitment is necessary for the effective administration of the course of\n       treatment and therefore the defendant is committed to the custody of the State\n       Department of Mental Health and placed at the facility recommended by the\n       [CFP].\n\n        The court’s next scheduled hearing occurred on October 29, 2013. Defense counsel\ninformed the court that defendant had remained in jail since the August 22 hearing because the\nKalamazoo Psychiatric Hospital did not “anticipate a bed being available for [his] client between\nsix to eight weeks from today’s date.” Counsel argued that the administrative delay had\ninterfered with defendant’s right to be free on bond pending trial. Counsel did not request the\ndismissal of the charges, only that defendant be released to his mother’s care pending treatment.\nThe prosecution objected to defendant’s release on bond as the underlying offense was assaultive\nin nature and out of fear that defendant might “fall through the cracks if he is not there and\nwaiting for the bed when it becomes available.”\n\n        The court expressed displeasure at the course of events, noting defendant “has gone\nuntreated, basically, for five months.” The court continued:\n\n       I think that when a person who has been determined to not be competent is kept in\n       jail and not treated, it kind of gets to cruel and unusual punishment.\n\n               I mean, we have a place for people that are not competent. And it is in a\n       state facility to help them restore them to competence. I don’t want to be a part of\n       a system that jails incompetent people, that incarcerates people who don’t have\n       the capacity to stay in the criminal justice system.\n\n                To me, that’s not the way that you deal with, you know, mental health\n       challenges, to jail them and not treat them. And that’s exactly where [defendant]\n       is. He has been found not to be competent. And we have incarcerated a person\n       that is not competent, would not have known that he was on a wait list. . . .\n\n                                               ***\n\n                                                -4-\n\f       . . . But somebody believes that it’s all right to incarcerate incompetent people.\n       And I don’t.\n\n               Originally, this Court made a finding that, based on the report, that it was\n       likely that he would regain competence through treatment. There has been no\n       treatment. They’re projecting out that he still won’t be treated for another two\n       months.\n\n              I’m going to, based on the new information that I have, find that he would\n       not be restored to competence in the allotted time that they have to treat him\n       based on the fact that he is not being treated. And, therefore, I will leave the\n       People to their other remedy of trying to process [defendant] through the civil\n       branch. . . .\n\n                                               ***\n\n       . . . I can disagree with the findings that the [CFP] had said. They thought that,\n       based on what they saw, that they would be able to restore him. I have the ability\n       to accept their recommendations and their findings or say, you know, I don’t think\n       that that’s true. I disagree with the report. And so, I can find that he is\n       incompetent to stand trial and that there is not a substantial probability that\n       competency will be attained within the time established by law.\n\n       The prosecutor objected, “But doesn’t the Court need to have a hearing and have another\nindividual who would concur with that opinion[?]” The court disagreed with this approach:\n\n                No. No. It’s . . . a judicial decision. It’s not a, you know, here’s one\n       psychiatrist that says this. This is one psychiatrist that says that. It’s a judicial\n       determination whether I want to accept their findings or to reject their findings.\n       It’s not -- We’ve already -- You all have stipulated to the report, which is fine.\n\n               But I’m finding that that report now doesn’t provide this Court with the\n       information that I believe it needs in order to now look back and say: Oh. Okay.\n       Well, I still agree that there’s a probability that the defendant, if provided a course\n       of treatment, will attain competence to stand trial within the time limits\n       established. I don’t believe that that’s true now.\n\nUpon the prosecutor’s reiterated objection, the court continued:\n\n               An objection already for the first thing, that he shouldn’t be released. And\n       I don’t think this is a release thing. I think this is the Court can make a finding\n       that, based on the inaccuracies now, that the initial report that the Court received\n       back on August the 22nd, that incarcerating an incompetent person, first of all,\n       isn’t what the Department of Corrections wants to be involved in. I don’t think\n       justice says that we incarcerate people who are incompetent. There is a guess as\n       to when [defendant] will be treated, based on the letter that we all received.\n\n\n\n                                                -5-\n\f                And that’s not sufficient for this Court then to say that there is a\n       substantial probability that competence will be attained within the time limits\n       established. So, I am changing my findings, based on the new information, and\n       will leave the People to try to civilly commit [defendant], since they’re concerned\n       about his mental health, as we all are. And if he returns to competence through\n       the civil division, then certainly the People should, and I encourage them then, to\n       refile this and let a competent person proceed through the criminal justice system.\n\n       The circuit court subsequently entered an order dismissing the action without prejudice\non the following ground: “The court determines defendant is incompetent and likely will not\nachieve competency within the prescribed time period. Prosecutor will proceed in civil court.”\nThe court also entered a “finding and order on competency” repeating its directives.\n\n         The prosecutor appealed the circuit court’s dismissal of the charges against defendant. In\nhis appellate brief, the prosecutor contends that the circuit court “erred in at least two respects.”\nFirst, the court improperly “determined without holding a hearing that defendant could not attain\ncompetence within 15 months.”          While the court was permitted to change its mind, the\nprosecutor posits that a hearing where the prosecutor could present “additional facts germane to\nthe findings” was necessary. Second, the prosecutor asserts, the court “dismissed the case before\nexpiration of the 15 months from the initial finding that defendant was incompetent.”\n\n                                  II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n        The circuit court’s dismissal of the charges against defendant was based on its\ninterpretation of the competency-hearing statutes. We review de novo issues of statutory\ninterpretation. People v Plunkett, 485 Mich 50, 58; 780 NW2d 280 (2010).\n\n       The primary goal of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and give effect to the\n       Legislature’s intent. The first step in ascertaining the Legislature’s intent is to\n       review the specific language of the statute. The Legislature is presumed to have\n       intended the meaning it plainly expressed and, therefore, clear statutory language\n       must be enforced as written. [People v Szabo, 303 Mich App 737, 741; 846\n       NW2d 412 (2014) (citations omitted).]\n\n         This case also presents constitutional issues for both sides. On the one hand, the\nprosecution of a case is an executive act, and a “trial court’s authority over the discharge of the\nprosecutor’s duties is limited” to situations in which a prosecutor’s actions “are unconstitutional,\nillegal, or ultra vires.” People v Morrow, 214 Mich App 158, 160-161; 542 NW2d 324 (1995).\nSee also People v Sierb, 456 Mich 519, 533; 581 NW2d 219 (1998) (“[A]bsent a violation of the\nconstitution or specific statutory authority, we are not persuaded that we have the authority or the\nwisdom to monitor the performance of the elected prosecutor.”). Though a trial judge “may veto\nthe prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute further,” the opposite is not true; a trial judge generally\nmay not dismiss charges sua sponte over a prosecutor’s objection. Morrow, 214 Mich App at\n162. On the other side of the coin lies a criminal defendant’s constitutional liberty interest. In\nthis vein, the United States Supreme Court has held that a state may not hold a defendant\nindefinitely “simply on account of his incompetency to stand trial on the charges filed against\nhim.” Jackson v Indiana, 406 US 715, 720; 92 S Ct 1845; 32 L Ed 2d 435 (1972). Such\n\n                                                 -6-\n\findefinite commitment amounts to a due process violation. Id. at 731. We review de novo such\nconstitutional considerations. See People v Harper, 479 Mich 599, 610; 739 NW2d 523 (2007).\n\n                                   III. STATUTORY RUBRIC\n\n        In Michigan, the competence of criminal defendants to stand trial is governed by\nprovisions of the Mental Health Code. MCL 330.2020 et seq. As a general rule, a criminal\ndefendant is “presumed competent to stand trial.” MCL 330.2020(1). A criminal defendant\n“shall be determined incompetent to stand trial only if he is incapable because of his mental\ncondition of understanding the nature and object of the proceedings against him or of assisting in\nhis defense in a rational manner.” Id. The statute places this determination in the court’s hands.\nId. (“The court shall determine the capacity of a defendant . . . .”).\n\n       The prosecutor, defense counsel, and the trial court all hold the power to raise the issue of\na defendant’s competency. MCL 330.2024. When the issue arises, the court must order the\ndefendant’s examination by the CFP or other qualified facility. MCL 330.2026(1). The\ndefendant may remain in jail pending and even during the examination. MCL 330.2026(2).\nHowever, a report regarding the defendant’s competence must be presented to the court within\n60 days. MCL 330.2028(1).\n\n       “A defendant who is determined incompetent to stand trial shall not be proceeded against\nwhile he is incompetent.” MCL 330.2022(1). Once a defendant becomes competent, the\nprosecution may go forward. Whether the CFP opines that the defendant is competent or\nincompetent, the court must conduct a hearing within five days of receiving its report. MCL\n330.2030(1).\n\n       On the basis of the evidence admitted at the hearing, the court shall determine the\n       issue of the incompetence of the defendant to stand trial. If the defendant is\n       determined incompetent to stand trial, the court shall also determine whether there\n       is a substantial probability that the defendant, if provided a course of treatment,\n       will attain competence to stand trial within the time limit established by [MCL\n       330.2034]. [MCL 330.2030(2).]\n\nThe time limit established under MCL 330.2034(1) is “15 months or 1/3 of the maximum\nsentence the defendant could receive” if convicted as charged, “whichever is lesser.”\nDefendant’s charges come with 10 and 15-year maximum sentences. See MCL 750.84(1); MCL\n750.530(1). Accordingly, the 15-month period is applicable in the current case.\n\n        In the event the court determines that the defendant cannot be rendered competent to\nstand trial within 15 months, MCL 330.2031 permits the court to direct the prosecutor to pursue\ncivil commitment procedures:\n\n\n\n\n                                                -7-\n\f         the court may direct a prosecuting attorney to file a petition asserting that the\n         defendant is a person requiring treatment as defined by [MCL 330.14011] or\n         meets the criteria for judicial admission as defined by [MCL 330.15152] with the\n         probate court of the defendant’s county of residence.\n\n        If the court finds a substantial probability that the defendant could be rendered competent\nto stand trial within 15 months, MCL 330.2032 governs the provision of treatment:\n\n         (1) If the defendant is determined incompetent to stand trial, and if the court\n         determines that there is a substantial probability that, if provided a course of\n         treatment, he will attain competence to stand trial within the time limit established\n         by [MCL 330.2034], the court shall order him to undergo treatment to render him\n         competent to stand trial.\n\n         (2) The court shall appoint a medical supervisor of the course of treatment. The\n         supervisor may be any person or agency willing to supervise the course of\n         treatment, or the department of mental health.\n\n         (3) The court may commit the defendant to the custody of the department of\n         mental health, or to the custody of any other inpatient mental health facility if it\n         agrees, only if commitment is necessary for the effective administration of the\n         course of treatment. If the defendant, absent commitment to the department of\n         mental health or other inpatient facility, would otherwise be held in a jail or\n         similar place of detention pending trial, the court may enter an order restricting\n         the defendant in his movements to the buildings and grounds of the facility at\n         which he is to be treated.\n\n      MCL 330.2034, as discussed, creates a time limit for the provision of treatment, i.e. 15\nmonths:\n\n         (1) No order or combination of orders issued under [MCL 330.2032 or MCL\n         330.2040], or both, shall have force and effect for a total period in excess of 15\n\n\n1\n A “person requiring treatment,” as defined by MCL 330.1401(1), encompasses individuals with\nmental illness, not cognitive impairments.\n2\n    MCL 330.1515 provides:\n         A court may order the admission of an individual 18 years of age or older who\n         meets both of the following requirements:\n\n            (a) Has been diagnosed as an individual with an intellectual disability.\n\n            (b) Can be reasonably expected within the near future to intentionally or\n         unintentionally seriously physically injure himself or herself or another person,\n         and has overtly acted in a manner substantially supportive of that expectation.\n\n\n                                                 -8-\n\f       months or 1/3 of the maximum sentence the defendant could receive if convicted\n       of the charges against him, whichever is lesser; nor after the charges against the\n       defendant are dismissed.\n\n       (2) The court shall provide for notification of defense counsel, the prosecution,\n       and the medical supervisor of treatment whenever the charges against the\n       defendant are dismissed and whenever an order whose stated time period has not\n       elapsed is voided by the court.\n\n       (3) If the defendant is to be discharged or released because of the expiration of an\n       order or orders under [MCL 330.2032 or MCL 330.2040], the supervisor of\n       treatment prior to the discharge or release may file a petition asserting that the\n       defendant is a person requiring treatment as defined by [MCL 330.1401] or meets\n       the criteria for judicial admission as defined by [MCL 330.1515] with the probate\n       court of the defendant’s county of residence [, i.e. a civil commitment].\n\n       When a defendant has been deemed incompetent to stand trial, the medical supervisor of\ntreatment is required to periodically supplement his or her report to the court “at least once every\n90 days.” MCL 330.2038(1)(a). Reports are also required\n\n          (b) Whenever he is of the opinion that the defendant is no longer incompetent\n       to stand trial.\n\n          (c) Whenever he is of the opinion that there is not a substantial probability that\n       the defendant, with treatment, will attain competence to stand trial within the time\n       limit established by [MCL 330.2034]. [MCL 330.2038(1).]\n\n        MCL 330.2040 governs the determination of a defendant’s continued incompetency to\nstand trial:\n\n       (1) The court shall forthwith hear and redetermine the issue of the incompetence\n       of the defendant to stand trial and, if the defendant is redetermined incompetent to\n       stand trial, shall hear and determine whether the defendant has made progress\n       toward attaining competence to stand trial during his course of treatment,\n       whenever the court receives a report from the supervisor of treatment, unless the\n       defense waives the hearing, or whenever deemed appropriate by the court.\n\n       (2) [MCL 330.2030] shall govern hearings held pursuant to this section.\n\n       (3) If the defendant is not redetermined incompetent to stand trial at a hearing\n       held pursuant to this section, trial shall commence as soon as practicable. If the\n       defendant is redetermined incompetent to stand trial, and if the court determines\n       that the defendant has made progress toward attaining competence to stand trial,\n       the court may modify or continue any orders it previously issued under [MCL\n       330.2032].\n\n\n\n\n                                                -9-\n\fThe defendant’s time spent incarcerated or institutionalized pending competency to stand trial is\nnot simply wasted time; it may be credited against the defendant’s eventual sentence. MCL\n330.2042.\n\n       The dismissal of charges is governed by MCL 330.2044, which provides:\n\n       (1) The charges against a defendant determined incompetent to stand trial shall be\n       dismissed:\n\n          (a) When the prosecutor notifies the court of his intention not to prosecute the\n       case; or\n\n          (b) Fifteen months after the date on which the defendant was originally\n       determined incompetent to stand trial.\n\n       (2) When charges are dismissed pursuant to subsection (1), the same charges, or\n       other charges arising from the transaction which gave rise to the dismissed\n       charges, shall not subsequently be filed against the defendant, except as provided\n       in this section.\n\n                                              ***\n\n       (4) The court shall grant permission to again file charges if after a hearing it\n       determines that the defendant is competent to stand trial. Prior to the hearing, the\n       court may order the defendant to be examined by personnel of the center for\n       forensic psychiatry or other qualified person as an outpatient, but may not commit\n       the defendant to the center or any other facility for the examination.\n\n                                        IV. ANALYSIS\n\n       The prosecutor correctly contends that the circuit court was not permitted to dismiss the\ncharges under the circumstances presented.\n\n                                A. PREREQUISITE HEARING\n\n        It is within the power of the circuit court to “determine the capacity of a defendant.”\nMCL 330.2020(1). That decision, as with any judicial decision, must be based in fact. See\nDemosthenes v Baal, 495 US 731, 735; 110 S Ct 2223; 109 L Ed 2d 762 (1990). The judgment\nof a defendant’s competence and “whether there is a substantial probability that the defendant”\ncould attain competence must be based on “the evidence admitted at the hearing.” MCL\n330.2030(2). The circuit court conducted such a hearing on August 22, 2013. The only evidence\nat the hearing was the CFP report, which indicated that defendant’s cognitive impairment\nrendered him currently incompetent to stand trial, a point with which the court agreed. The\nreport also included the evaluator’s opinion that education regarding the legal process could\nallow defendant “in a basic way, to work with his attorney,” allowing him to potentially attain\ncompetence within 15 months. Although the court was “not completely sold” on this conclusion,\nit accepted the report and held defendant for treatment geared toward preparing him for trial.\n\n\n                                              -10-\n\f        The lack of treatment in the interim prompted the court to change its mind at the October\n29 hearing. The only evidence at the hearing was that the Kalamazoo Psychiatric Hospital would\nnot have an open bed for other six to eight weeks. From this fact alone, the circuit court jumped\nto the conclusion that defendant would not be able to attain the requisite level of competency to\nstand trial within the statutory 15-month period. More is required by the Mental Health Code,\nhowever.\n\n        MCL 330.2030(2) demands that a competency determination be made “[o]n the basis of\nthe evidence admitted at the hearing” following the presentation of the CFP report. MCL\n330.2040 similarly demands a hearing before a “redetermination” of competency is made. If the\ndefendant remains incompetent, MCL 330.2040(1) mandates that the court “hear and determine\nwhether the defendant has made progress toward attaining competence.” Such a hearing must be\nheld each time the CFP provides a supplemental report (unless waived by the defendant), or at\nother times “deemed appropriate by the court.” And any hearing conducted pursuant to MCL\n330.2040(1) must comport with MCL 330.2030. MCL 330.2040(2).\n\n       Here, there was no subsequent report from the CFP. Accordingly, the October 29 hearing\nwas scheduled based on the circuit court’s discretionary power under MCL 330.2040(1). The\nOctober 29 hearing had to be conducted consistent with the procedures of MCL 330.2030. MCL\n330.2030(2) provides, “The defense, prosecution, and the court on its own motion may present\nadditional evidence relevant to the issues to be determined at the hearing.” The court denied the\nprosecutor the opportunity to present additional evidence, ruling that competency is “a judicial\ndecision” and would be made solely on the stipulated CFP report. While the CFP report was\nadmissible, MCL 330.2030(3), this was not to the exclusion of other evidence the prosecutor\nmay have wanted to present. Absent a hearing at which the prosecutor could present evidence\nregarding defendant’s ability to attain competence, the court improperly rendered any decision\nregarding defendant’s continued incompetence.\n\n                                 B. REMEDY OF DISMISSAL\n\n        Moreover, with or without a hearing, dismissal of the charges against defendant was not\nthe proper remedy. MCL 330.2044 “is the procedural vehicle for enforcing a defendant’s right\nnot to be confined solely because of incompetency.” People v Miller, 440 Mich 631, 636; 489\nNW2d 60 (1992). MCL 330.2044(1) provides only two circumstances meriting a trial court’s\ndismissal of the criminal action: (a) upon notification by the prosecutor of his intent to drop the\ncharges, and (b) if the defendant remains incompetent to stand trial 15 months after the original\nincompetency ruling. Neither of these situations existed in this case. The prosecutor repeatedly\nexpressed his desire to pursue the pending charges. And at the time of the October 29, 2013\nhearing, 15 months had not elapsed since the original incompetency determination. Accordingly,\nthe circuit court lacked statutory authority simply to dismiss the matter.\n\n        In Jackson, 406 US at 717, the defendant was a deaf, mute, severely mentally impaired\nman who could only communicate through rudimentary sign language. On two separate\noccasions, the defendant stole property from women with a total value of $9. Id. Evidence at a\npretrial competency hearing revealed that no level of treatment could render the defendant\ncompetent to stand trial. Id. at 718-719, 725. Even so, the trial court ordered the defendant’s\ncommitment “until such time as [the Indiana Department of Mental Health] should certify to the\n\n                                               -11-\n\fcourt that ‘the defendant is sane.’ ” Id. at 719. The defendant’s appeal travelled all the way to\nthe Supreme Court because it amounted to an indefinite commitment despite that he had never\nbeen convicted of a criminal offense. Id.\n\n         The Indiana statutes governing “pretrial commitment of incompetent criminal\ndefendants,” like those in Michigan, grant the authority to render the incompetency decision to\nthe trial court alone. Id. at 720. The Indiana statutes, however, authorized the court to detain the\ncriminal defendant indefinitely in the treatment facility until “whenever the defendant shall\nbecome sane.” Id. Moreover, the Indiana scheme did not provide for periodic court review of\nthe criminal defendant’s mental condition. Id. The defendant in Jackson contended that the\ncourt should have proceeded under the state’s civil commitment procedures to protect the\ndefendant’s rights. Id. at 721. Under the civil procedure, a “feeble-minded” person may be\nreleased from confinement upon such time that the supervising agency deems that “the mental\nand physical condition of the patient justifies it.” Id.\n\n        Relevant to the current appeal, the United States Supreme Court held: “Indiana’s\nindefinite commitment of a criminal defendant solely on account of his incompetency to stand\ntrial does not square with the Fourteenth Amendment’s guarantee of due process.” Id. at 731.\nThe indefiniteness of the commitment period arises because the statutes take no account of the\ndefendant’s likelihood of improvement, requiring institutionalization until the defendant attains\nsanity. Id. at 725, 727.\n\n        The Court pointed to the federal procedures for managing incompetent criminal\ndefendants as a contrast. Under 18 USC 4246, a criminal defendant could be held before trial\n“until the accused shall be mentally competent to stand trial.” Federal courts had applied the\nsubsequent statutory provision, 18 USC 4247, to such pretrial commitments even though it\nfacially applied only to convicted defendants deemed incompetent while serving their sentences.\nJackson, 406 US at 731-732. Section 4247 permitted commitment of a prisoner, rather than\nrelease at the natural end of his sentence, if deemed “insane or mentally incompetent” and a\ndanger to himself or others. Jackson, 406 US at 732. Under this rubric, the prisoner must be\nreleased once he is no longer a danger. Id. The federal courts applied this statute to create “a\n‘rule of reasonableness’ ” for pretrial detention. Id. at 733. Specifically, if a defendant is\ndeemed incompetent to stand trial, he “can be held only for a ‘reasonable period of time’\nnecessary to determine whether there is a substantial chance of his attaining the capacity to stand\ntrial in the foreseeable future. If the chances are slight, or if the defendant does not in fact\nimprove, then he must be released” or granted a hearing to consider whether he poses a danger.\nId.\n\n       Later that same year, the United States Supreme Court considered the detention of\nincompetent individuals beyond the expiration of their criminal sentence. In McNeil v Director,\nPatuxent Institution, 407 US 245, 246; 92 S Ct 2083; 32 L Ed 2d 719 (1972), the defendant was\nconvicted of assault and sentenced to five years’ imprisonment. The sentencing court ordered\nthe defendant’s transport to Patuxent Institution, rather than prison, “to determine whether he\nshould be committed to that institution for an indeterminate term” as a defective delinquent. Id.\nThe defendant remained institutionalized after the expiration of his sentence, the Institution\nalleged, because he refused to cooperate so that a valid assessment could be made. Id. The\ndefendant’s challenge was not to the “criteria and procedures” governing Maryland defective-\n\n                                               -12-\n\fdelinquency hearings; no such hearing had yet been conducted. Id. at 248. Rather, the\ndefendant’s challenge was that “[h]is confinement rest[ed] wholly on the order committing him\nfor examination, in preparation for such a commitment hearing.” Id. “That order was made, not\non the basis of an adversary hearing, but on the basis of an ex parte judicial determination that\nthere was ‘reasonable cause to believe that the Defendant may be a Defective Delinquent,’ ” the\nCourt continued. Id. (citation omitted).\n\n        The Institution in McNeil raised two grounds to support its indefinite commitment of the\ndefendant: “that a commitment for observation need not be surrounded by the procedural\nsafeguards (such as an adversary hearing) that are appropriate for a final determination of\ndefective delinquency,” id. at 249, and that the defendant’s commitment was akin to a civil\ncontempt because his obstreperous behavior prevented examination. Id. at 250. The Supreme\nCourt rejected both contentions. In relation to the first, the Court held, “A confinement that is in\nfact indeterminate cannot rest on procedures designed to authorize a brief period of observation.”\nId. at 249. Citing Jackson, 406 US at 738, the McNeil Court further held:\n\n       If the commitment is properly regarded as a short-term confinement with a limited\n       purpose, as the respondent suggests, then lesser safeguards may be appropriate,\n       but by the same token, the duration of the confinement must be strictly limited.\n       “Due process requires that the nature and duration of commitment bear some\n       reasonable relation to the purpose for which the individual is committed.” Just as\n       that principle limits the permissible length of a commitment on account of\n       incompetence to stand trial, so it also limits the permissible length of a\n       commitment “for observation.” [McNeil, 407 US at 249-250.]\n\nThe Court declined to “set a precise time limit” as the Maryland statute actually included a six-\nmonth observation period. Id. at 250. The state had violated the intention of this protection by\npermitting repeated extensions. Id.\n\n         In relation to the second ground, the Court noted, “if confinement is to rest on a theory of\ncivil contempt, then due process requires a hearing to determine whether petitioner has in fact\nbehaved in a manner that amounts to contempt.” Id. at 251. The hearing would permit the trial\ncourt to determine whether the defendant’s contemptuous conduct was actually caused by mental\nillness, or whether it was a willful violation of court orders. Id. In McNeil, the defendant had\nessentially been confined on the basis of contempt “potentially for life, although he ha[d] never\nbeen determined to be in contempt by a procedure that comports with due process.” Id. The\nmeat of McNeil is that a defendant is entitled to a hearing and resolution of his competency\nwithin a reasonable time to ensure he is not held without just cause.\n\n        Just as stated in McNeil, in Michigan, a criminal defendant may not be held indefinitely.\nThe statutes provide a 15-month period in which the defendant must be rendered competent to\nstand trial. If the defendant cannot be so rendered, the prosecutor must pursue civil commitment\nmeasures to maintain the defendant in care. This Court has upheld detainment in the face of this\nstatutorily-designated reasonable-delay period.\n\n       In People v Davis, 123 Mich App 553, 557; 332 NW2d 606 (1983), a two-year delay\nseparated “the original order for commitment for forensic examination and the administration of\n\n                                                -13-\n\fthe examination.” During that time, the defendant had been the subject of a civil commitment\nand absconded for approximately seven months from the psychiatric institution. Id. at 556. The\ndefendant contended that the circuit court was required to dismiss the charges against him\npursuant to MCL 330.2044(1)(b) because 15 months had elapsed since he was first deemed\nincompetent and he had yet to attain competency to stand trial. Davis, 123 Mich App at 557.\nThis Court disagreed with the defendant’s calculation of the confinement period following the\ninitial competency determination. Id. Citing Jackson and McNeil, this Court held “that an\nindividual may not be committed to a psychiatric institution for an extended period except after a\ndue process hearing.” Id. at 558. In Davis, however, the defendant was held in the psychiatric\nfacility for a fixed period as a result of his guilty plea, so that no due process violation occurred.\nId. Ultimately, however, the Davis Court remanded for further consideration of the defendant’s\nspeedy trial claim. Id. at 560.\n\n         In People v Bowman, 141 Mich App 390, 393-396; 367 NW2d 867 (1985), the defendant\nwas repeatedly found incompetent to stand trial in both state court and a previous federal court\nprosecution. He eventually stood trial in state court when the administration of psychotropic\nmedications rendered him competent to understand the proceedings. Id. at 397. The question in\nBowman was the start date of the 15-month period for purposes of MCL 330.2044. Id. at 398.\nThis Court’s analysis, however, bears relevance to this appeal. The Bowman Court noted that\n“procedures for determining a criminal defendant’s competence to stand trial are ultimately\nrooted in principles of due process.” Id. at 399. The statutes therefore must “be interpreted in a\nmanner that protects incompetent defendants from indefinite denials of liberty.” Id. Construing\nvarious provisions together, this Court held that the mental health department has only 15\nmonths to treat the defendant so he can attain competency. Id. at 399-400. MCL 330.2044\nprotects a defendant from an indefinite wait after being found incompetent to stand trial, this\nCourt adjudged. “In order to protect defendants from an indefinite suspension of their right to\ntrial, as opposed to an indefinite suspension of their right to liberty, [MCL 330.2044] requires\nthat charges be dismissed 15 months after the determination of incompetency.” Bowman, 141\nMich App at 400.\n\n        The circuit court exaggerated the delay that arguably could be attributed to the\nprosecution in this case. Defendant was released on bond two months after his arrest, and\nremained free until the August 22 hearing. He was held in the Wayne County Jail from August\n22 through October 29, a period of two months and one week. The waiting list for the\nKalamazoo Psychiatric Hospital would have extended defendant’s jail confinement for\napproximately four months total after the issue of competency had been raised, but defendant\nhad in fact been detained for only two months at the relevant time. This delay bears no similarity\nto the indefinite confinements in Jackson, 406 US 715, and McNeil, 407 US 245. Moreover,\nneither statutory nor constitutional grounds supported dismissal of the charges based on the\ndelay. We do not suggest that the circuit court’s concern for incarcerating a cognitively-\nimpaired 17-year-old boy was misplaced, only that the court chose an impermissible remedy.\nOrdering defendant’s segregation in the jail or releasing defendant to his family’s care on house\narrest would have served the same purpose without violating the statutory provisions.\n\n       Given the lack of a proper hearing and the short duration of the delay, the court was not\npermitted to dismiss the charges over the prosecutor’s objection. We must therefore reverse.\n\n\n                                                -14-\n\f                      C. ALTERNATE GROUNDS FOR AFFIRMANCE\n\n        Defendant characterizes the legal arguments placed before this Court differently and we\nwill consider them as alternate grounds for affirming the circuit court’s decision. Defendant\nasserts that the circuit court actually dismissed the charges because “the court ordered\nexamination regarding Defendant’s competency to stand trial did not take place within the\nstatutorily mandated 60 days.” In this regard, defendant relies upon MCL 330.2028(1), which\ndirects that when a court orders a forensic examination of a defendant’s competency to stand trial\nunder MCL 330.2026, the initial CFP report must be submitted within 60 days. This deadline\nwas not relevant at the October 29 hearing. The court ordered defendant’s examination on June\n6, and the CFP had 60 days from that date to submit its initial report. The CFP submitted its\nreport to the court on August 8 without objection. After the August 22 hearing, the examining\nauthority had 90 days to submit a follow-up treatment report. MCL 330.2038(1)(a). Less than\n90 days elapsed between the August and October hearings and defendant raises no challenge\nbased on MCL 330.2038.\n\n        Defendant also claims that any error in dismissing the charges was harmless because the\ncourt’s order was entered without prejudice. In this regard, defendant cites Miller, 440 Miller\n631, for the proposition that “failure to adhere to the statutory requirements regarding dismissal,\nwhich allow for the refiling of charges, is merely a procedural error resulting in harmless error\nand does not require reversal.” Miller is inapposite.\n\n        In Miller, 440 Mich at 634-635, a defendant was found incompetent to stand trial,\nattained competency through treatment, but then regressed. The defendant was deemed\nincompetent to stand trial for a total period greater than 15 months. Further treatment returned\nthe defendant to competency, he stood trial, and was convicted of first-degree criminal sexual\nconduct. Id. at 635. Once the total period of the defendant’s incompetency to stand trial spanned\n15 months, the defendant repeatedly sought dismissal of the charges against him under MCL\n330.2044, but the trial court rejected his attempts. Id. This Court reversed the defendant’s\nconvictions, holding that dismissal was required because the defendant was incompetent at the\ntime he filed his motion and more than 15 months had elapsed since he was first adjudged\nincompetent to stand trial. Id.\n\n        The Supreme Court reversed this Court’s opinion and reinstated the defendant’s\nconvictions. The Court cited MCL 330.20144(3) and (4), which permit the prosecution to refile\ncharges against a defendant once he regains competency. Because the charges could be refiled,\nthe failure to dismiss the charges during the period of incompetency was harmless:\n\n       A violation of [MCL 330.2044(1)(b)] predicated solely on the erroneous denial of\n       a motion to dismiss constitutes a ground for reversal only where it is claimed that\n       the failure to dismiss denied defendant a substantive right, to wit: the barring of\n       the charge or prejudice caused by the delay resulting from a violation of [MCL\n       330.2044(1)(b)]. Failure to dismiss after expiration of a total period of fifteen\n       months is not error on which reversal can be predicated. [Miller, 440 Mich at\n       636.]\n\n\n\n                                               -15-\n\fThe Court continued:\n\n       Although hardly a model of clarity, the structure of the act and the legislative\n       history suggest that [MCL 330.2044(3) and (4)] are limitation provisions and that\n       reversal of a conviction would be warranted in respect to nonlife offenses only\n       where the time lapse from initial adjudication of incompetence exceeds one third\n       of the maximum sentence or causes prejudice to the defendant’s substantive\n       rights. [Id. at 637.]\n\n        Unlike in Miller, the circuit court in this case dismissed the charges against defendant\nbecause he had yet to begin treatment geared toward attaining competency, and treatment would\nlikely be delayed another two months. The court did not dismiss the charges because the 15-\nmonth statutory period had expired. Indeed, defendant’s period of incompetency had lasted\nnowhere near this limitation period. Based on the delay, the circuit court reversed its initial\ndetermination and found that defendant would not likely attain competence within the 15-month\nstatutory period. However, the delay in beginning defendant’s treatment was an insufficient\nbasis to support that defendant was unlikely to attain competence. The circuit court’s focus must\nbe “whether, if provided a course of treatment, a substantial probability exists that a defendant\nfound to be incompetent will attain competence within the time limit established.” Id. at 637-\n638 (emphasis added). Once the circuit court initially determined that defendant could attain\ncompetence, the Kalamazoo Psychiatric Hospital had a full “15 months within which to treat\ndefendant.” Bowman, 141 Mich App at 400. The hospital notified the court that it would be\nunable to treat defendant for another six to eight weeks, amounting to a total four-month delay\nbetween being adjudged incompetent to stand trial and beginning treatment. Though such a\ndelay is not preferable and should be avoided if at all possible, it is mere speculation that\ndefendant would remain incompetent for the entire 15 months provided by statute. MCL\n330.2034(1). Therefore, the circuit court lacked statutory authority to dismiss the charges and its\nerror was not harmless under Miller.\n\n        We reverse and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion. We do not retain\njurisdiction.\n\n\n\n                                                            /s/ Elizabeth L. Gleicher\n                                                            /s/ Mark J.

After the district court bound defendant\nover on unarmed robbery and assault charges, the circuit court questioned whether defendant was\ncompetent to stand trial. Initial examination supported defendant’s current incompetency but\nrevealed that defendant potentially could be rendered competent to stand trial within 15 months\nif provided appropriate treatment. For the next two months, defendant remained in county jail\nbecause no vacancies opened at an appropriate psychiatric facility. The circuit court then\ndetermined that the delay in treatment made it impossible to have defendant ready for trial within\nthe statutory period and dismissed the charges against defendant without prejudice. Because the\ncircuit court lacked statutory authority to dismiss the case over the prosecutor’s objections, we\nreverse.\n\n                                       I. BACKGROUND\n\n       On the afternoon of April 15, 2013, then 17-year-old defendant, along with six other\nyoung men, “jumped” a 16-year-old autistic boy and stole his portable gaming system. Detroit\npolice arrested defendant three days later. Defendant waived his rights and admitted, but\nminimized, his role in the attack. Following preliminary examination, the district court bound\ndefendant over for trial on charges of unarmed robbery and assault with intent to commit great\nbodily harm less than murder.\n\n       On June 6, 2013, the circuit court issued an “order for competency examination” to\ndetermine whether defendant was competent to stand trial. Defendant was released on bond until\nhis examination at the Center for Forensic Psychiatry (CFP). On July 27, 2013, family members\ntransported defendant to the center, where he met with a licensed psychologist, Cathie\nZmachinski. Accepting reports that defendant was “moderately impaired,” Zmachinski noted:\n\n\n                                               -1-\n\f       [Defendant] showed limited comprehension of questions. So, I simplified my\n       questions and comments which facilitated his understanding. His responses were\n       relevant but brief, usually only three to four words long. His thoughts were\n       coherent.     He required direct questioning in order to obtain related\n       information. . . . [Defendant] demonstrated other cognitive difficulties. He\n       showed limited abstract reasoning. He showed limited understanding of the world\n       around him. He showed limitations in expressing himself. He demonstrated\n       immature interests. . . . He also showed a tendency to agree without regard to the\n       specific content of some questions. Based on his clinical presentation and\n       understanding of his world, [defendant] appeared to be functioning in the mild\n       mentally retarded range. Additionally, he gave the indication that he was able to\n       process more information than indicated by his verbal responses.\n\nZmachinski described defendant’s memory deficits. In addition, she opined, “Besides his limited\ninsight into his cognitive abilities he showed limited insight into his affective life.”\n\n        Zmachinski also interviewed defendant’s mother, Tiffany Davis. Davis reported that\ndefendant had received special education services since kindergarten, was restless and had\ndifficulty staying on task at home. Davis indicated that defendant had been incarcerated for two\nmonths before being released on bond. During that time, the other inmates took advantage of\ndefendant and “beat [him] up.”\n\n       In relation to defendant’s competency to stand trial, Zmachinski opined:\n\n               It is my opinion that [defendant] has a limited understanding of the nature\n       and object of the proceedings against him. He was asked some questions about\n       the criminal justice system and in particular about his legal case. He\n       demonstrated the following. He said he could not remember the charges against\n       him. But he could acknowledge them. He was aware of the circumstances from\n       which those charges arose. When asked specifically, he claimed not to know\n       what happens were he to be found guilty or the maximum penalty given his\n       charges. He could recall his attorney “Came to my house-asked about my job-\n       same as you.” [Defendant] further indicated his mother was with him while\n       talking to his attorney, “She does a lot of talking.” He said he did not know the\n       jobs of the prosecutor or judge. He could not give an explanation of a plea\n       bargain or the essence of a trial. He did however say if you believe the witness\n       was lying, he would tell his attorney. Due to his limited expressive knowledge\n       about the legal system, he was given the CAST-MR. This measure is designed\n       for those with mental retardation. Individuals are asked questions about the\n       criminal justice system in a multiple choice format. Also they are asked questions\n       about various scenarios regarding the legal process. On this measure, [defendant]\n       could correctly identify the basic job of the witness, judge but not the jury, his\n       attorney and the prosecutor. He could identify such words as “Sentence, crime,\n       penitentiary, felony, misdemeanor, and time served.” He knew that if found\n       guilty, it would mean the prosecutor proved he did it. He could not identify plea\n       bargaining. Thus, he demonstrated greater knowledge about the system than\n       when asked more open ended questions. But he continued to show some limited\n\n                                               -2-\n\fknowledge. [Defendant] also was given various problematic scenarios related to\nlegal charges and arrest. He showed in his answers that he was capable of being\nprotective of himself in the jail and with the prosecutor. But he showed some\nproblems with situations requiring more than a black and white reasoning. His\noverall performance suggested he knows more about the process than he was able\nto express. Yet his knowledge was, in my opinion, still considered limited.\n\n        In regards to his ability to assist defense counsel in a rational manner,\nagain it is my opinion that this would be limited. To his favor, [defendant]\nprovided a rendition of the incident in question, one similar to that in the police\naccount. He could answer some questions but not others, including his\nunderstanding of his behaviors at that time. He was aware of some important\nelements about his case. For example, he kept repeating important aspects of the\nassaulted boy’s testimony. Although he could not elaborate why this was\nimportant, he seemed aware on a basic level that this testimony suggested he had\nminimal involvement in the crime. [Defendant] also showed an ability to control\nhis behavior within the interview. He also did not demonstrate emotional\ndifficulties. [Defendant] showed limitations in problem-solving and decision-\nmaking. He did better when he was given simple choices and the problem was\nspelled out for him. [Defendant] was quite passive. Given his cognitive abilities\nand limited knowledge of the legal process, it is my opinion [defendant] would\nnot communicate his concerns sufficiently to his attorney. He would not\nunderstand what has been said if more than simple language was used. Given his\nlimited knowledge of the process, this would further limit his comprehension of\nthe process as well as communications with his attorney. It is my opinion were he\nmore knowledgeable about the process he may be less passive and might express\nsome of his concerns. But nonetheless at the current time, it is my opinion that\n[defendant], due to his cognitive limitations as well as passivity would have\nsignificant difficulty assisting his attorney to resolve the current charges.\n\n        In summary, due to limited cognitive abilities although [defendant]\nshowed some knowledge about the criminal justice system, in my opinion it was\ninsufficient to be considered him [sic] capable of understanding the nature and\nobject of the proceedings against him. Additionally, again due to this limited\nknowledge and limited cognitive abilities, it is my opinion that he would have\nproblems assisting defense counsel in a rational manner. Therefore, it is my\nopinion that [defendant] was incompetent to stand trial.\n\n        The next question becomes whether there is a substantial probability that\n[defendant] could be expected to regain his competency within [the] time period\nprovided by statute and if he were provided with a structured, inpatient, hospital\nsetting with the provision of appropriate therapeutic intervention. It is my opinion\n[defendant] has some skills which he can draw upon to learn more about the legal\nprocess. So with education and treatment, he may acquire a greater knowledge of\nthe process. Additionally given his cognitive skills as being measured in the\nmoderately impaired range, I anticipate that his will take some time. But, it is my\nopinion that he would be able to gain the knowledge required. With that\n\n                                        -3-\n\f       knowledge, it is my opinion he would likely be able, in a basic way, to work with\n       his attorney to resolve the current charges.\n\nThis report was submitted to the circuit court on August 8, 2013. An August 9, 2013 letter from\nthe CFP director recommended that defendant be treated at Kalamazoo Psychiatric Hospital.\n\n        At an August 22, 2013 hearing on the matter, the circuit court followed the CFP’s\nrecommendation. However, the court noted, “I’m not completely sold on their conclusion about\nhis ability to . . . attain . . . [c]omptency. And my opinion is based on the fact that they have not\nreceived his school records and they have not received the Wayne County Jail information that\nthey have requested.” The court directed, “I’m going to have him placed there,” meaning the\npsychiatric hospital. The court then stated its intent to schedule a hearing “within the time period\nprescribed by law” to determine if defendant had attained competency. Defendant was returned\nto court custody that day and was transported back to the Wayne County Jail to await transport to\nthe Kalamazoo Psychiatric Hospital. The court’s subsequent order provided:\n\n       8. Commitment is necessary for the effective administration of the course of\n       treatment and therefore the defendant is committed to the custody of the State\n       Department of Mental Health and placed at the facility recommended by the\n       [CFP].\n\n        The court’s next scheduled hearing occurred on October 29, 2013. Defense counsel\ninformed the court that defendant had remained in jail since the August 22 hearing because the\nKalamazoo Psychiatric Hospital did not “anticipate a bed being available for [his] client between\nsix to eight weeks from today’s date.” Counsel argued that the administrative delay had\ninterfered with defendant’s right to be free on bond pending trial. Counsel did not request the\ndismissal of the charges, only that defendant be released to his mother’s care pending treatment.\nThe prosecution objected to defendant’s release on bond as the underlying offense was assaultive\nin nature and out of fear that defendant might “fall through the cracks if he is not there and\nwaiting for the bed when it becomes available.”\n\n        The court expressed displeasure at the course of events, noting defendant “has gone\nuntreated, basically, for five months.” The court continued:\n\n       I think that when a person who has been determined to not be competent is kept in\n       jail and not treated, it kind of gets to cruel and unusual punishment.\n\n               I mean, we have a place for people that are not competent. And it is in a\n       state facility to help them restore them to competence. I don’t want to be a part of\n       a system that jails incompetent people, that incarcerates people who don’t have\n       the capacity to stay in the criminal justice system.\n\n                To me, that’s not the way that you deal with, you know, mental health\n       challenges, to jail them and not treat them. And that’s exactly where [defendant]\n       is. He has been found not to be competent. And we have incarcerated a person\n       that is not competent, would not have known that he was on a wait list. . . .\n\n                                               ***\n\n                                                -4-\n\f       . . . But somebody believes that it’s all right to incarcerate incompetent people.\n       And I don’t.\n\n               Originally, this Court made a finding that, based on the report, that it was\n       likely that he would regain competence through treatment. There has been no\n       treatment. They’re projecting out that he still won’t be treated for another two\n       months.\n\n              I’m going to, based on the new information that I have, find that he would\n       not be restored to competence in the allotted time that they have to treat him\n       based on the fact that he is not being treated. And, therefore, I will leave the\n       People to their other remedy of trying to process [defendant] through the civil\n       branch. . . .\n\n                                               ***\n\n       . . . I can disagree with the findings that the [CFP] had said. They thought that,\n       based on what they saw, that they would be able to restore him. I have the ability\n       to accept their recommendations and their findings or say, you know, I don’t think\n       that that’s true. I disagree with the report. And so, I can find that he is\n       incompetent to stand trial and that there is not a substantial probability that\n       competency will be attained within the time established by law.\n\n       The prosecutor objected, “But doesn’t the Court need to have a hearing and have another\nindividual who would concur with that opinion[?]” The court disagreed with this approach:\n\n                No. No. It’s . . . a judicial decision. It’s not a, you know, here’s one\n       psychiatrist that says this. This is one psychiatrist that says that. It’s a judicial\n       determination whether I want to accept their findings or to reject their findings.\n       It’s not -- We’ve already -- You all have stipulated to the report, which is fine.\n\n               But I’m finding that that report now doesn’t provide this Court with the\n       information that I believe it needs in order to now look back and say: Oh. Okay.\n       Well, I still agree that there’s a probability that the defendant, if provided a course\n       of treatment, will attain competence to stand trial within the time limits\n       established. I don’t believe that that’s true now.\n\nUpon the prosecutor’s reiterated objection, the court continued:\n\n               An objection already for the first thing, that he shouldn’t be released. And\n       I don’t think this is a release thing. I think this is the Court can make a finding\n       that, based on the inaccuracies now, that the initial report that the Court received\n       back on August the 22nd, that incarcerating an incompetent person, first of all,\n       isn’t what the Department of Corrections wants to be involved in. I don’t think\n       justice says that we incarcerate people who are incompetent. There is a guess as\n       to when [defendant] will be treated, based on the letter that we all received.\n\n\n\n                                                -5-\n\f                And that’s not sufficient for this Court then to say that there is a\n       substantial probability that competence will be attained within the time limits\n       established. So, I am changing my findings, based on the new information, and\n       will leave the People to try to civilly commit [defendant], since they’re concerned\n       about his mental health, as we all are. And if he returns to competence through\n       the civil division, then certainly the People should, and I encourage them then, to\n       refile this and let a competent person proceed through the criminal justice system.\n\n       The circuit court subsequently entered an order dismissing the action without prejudice\non the following ground: “The court determines defendant is incompetent and likely will not\nachieve competency within the prescribed time period. Prosecutor will proceed in civil court.”\nThe court also entered a “finding and order on competency” repeating its directives.\n\n         The prosecutor appealed the circuit court’s dismissal of the charges against defendant. In\nhis appellate brief, the prosecutor contends that the circuit court “erred in at least two respects.”\nFirst, the court improperly “determined without holding a hearing that defendant could not attain\ncompetence within 15 months.”          While the court was permitted to change its mind, the\nprosecutor posits that a hearing where the prosecutor could present “additional facts germane to\nthe findings” was necessary. Second, the prosecutor asserts, the court “dismissed the case before\nexpiration of the 15 months from the initial finding that defendant was incompetent.”\n\n                                  II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n        The circuit court’s dismissal of the charges against defendant was based on its\ninterpretation of the competency-hearing statutes. We review de novo issues of statutory\ninterpretation. People v Plunkett, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">485</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 58; 780 NW2d 280 (2010).\n\n       The primary goal of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and give effect to the\n       Legislature’s intent. The first step in ascertaining the Legislature’s intent is to\n       review the specific language of the statute. The Legislature is presumed to have\n       intended the meaning it plainly expressed and, therefore, clear statutory language\n       must be enforced as written. [People v Szabo, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">303</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.

On the one hand, the\nprosecution of a case is an executive act, and a “trial court’s authority over the discharge of the\nprosecutor’s duties is limited” to situations in which a prosecutor’s actions “are unconstitutional,\nillegal, or ultra vires.” People v Morrow, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1237221\"><a href=\"/opinion/1237221/people-v-morrow/\"><span class=\"volume\">214</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.

Though a trial judge “may veto\nthe prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute further,” the opposite is not true; a trial judge generally\nmay not dismiss charges sua sponte over a prosecutor’s objection. Morrow, 214 Mich App at\n162. On the other side of the coin lies a criminal defendant’s constitutional liberty interest. In\nthis vein, the United States Supreme Court has held that a state may not hold a defendant\nindefinitely “simply on account of his incompetency to stand trial on the charges filed against\nhim.” Jackson v Indiana, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108556\"><a href=\"/opinion/108556/jackson-v-indiana/\"><span class=\"volume\">406</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">715</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 720; </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108556\"><a href=\"/opinion/108556/jackson-v-indiana/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

STATUTORY RUBRIC\n\n        In Michigan, the competence of criminal defendants to stand trial is governed by\nprovisions of the Mental Health Code. MCL 330.2020 et seq. As a general rule, a criminal\ndefendant is “presumed competent to stand trial.” MCL 330.2020(1). A criminal defendant\n“shall be determined incompetent to stand trial only if he is incapable because of his mental\ncondition of understanding the nature and object of the proceedings against him or of assisting in\nhis defense in a rational manner.” Id. The statute places this determination in the court’s hands.\nId. (“The court shall determine the capacity of a defendant . . . .”).\n\n       The prosecutor, defense counsel, and the trial court all hold the power to raise the issue of\na defendant’s competency. MCL 330.2024. When the issue arises, the court must order the\ndefendant’s examination by the CFP or other qualified facility. MCL 330.2026(1). The\ndefendant may remain in jail pending and even during the examination. MCL 330.2026(2).\nHowever, a report regarding the defendant’s competence must be presented to the court within\n60 days. MCL 330.2028(1).\n\n       “A defendant who is determined incompetent to stand trial shall not be proceeded against\nwhile he is incompetent.” MCL 330.2022(1). Once a defendant becomes competent, the\nprosecution may go forward. Whether the CFP opines that the defendant is competent or\nincompetent, the court must conduct a hearing within five days of receiving its report. MCL\n330.2030(1).\n\n       On the basis of the evidence admitted at the hearing, the court shall determine the\n       issue of the incompetence of the defendant to stand trial. If the defendant is\n       determined incompetent to stand trial, the court shall also determine whether there\n       is a substantial probability that the defendant, if provided a course of treatment,\n       will attain competence to stand trial within the time limit established by [MCL\n       330.2034]. [MCL 330.2030(2).]\n\nThe time limit established under MCL 330.2034(1) is “15 months or 1/3 of the maximum\nsentence the defendant could receive” if convicted as charged, “whichever is lesser.”\nDefendant’s charges come with 10 and 15-year maximum sentences. See MCL 750.84(1); MCL\n750.530(1). Accordingly, the 15-month period is applicable in the current case.\n\n        In the event the court determines that the defendant cannot be rendered competent to\nstand trial within 15 months, MCL 330.2031 permits the court to direct the prosecutor to pursue\ncivil commitment procedures:\n\n\n\n\n                                                -7-\n\f         the court may direct a prosecuting attorney to file a petition asserting that the\n         defendant is a person requiring treatment as defined by [MCL 330.14011] or\n         meets the criteria for judicial admission as defined by [MCL 330.15152] with the\n         probate court of the defendant’s county of residence.\n\n        If the court finds a substantial probability that the defendant could be rendered competent\nto stand trial within 15 months, MCL 330.2032 governs the provision of treatment:\n\n         (1) If the defendant is determined incompetent to stand trial, and if the court\n         determines that there is a substantial probability that, if provided a course of\n         treatment, he will attain competence to stand trial within the time limit established\n         by [MCL 330.2034], the court shall order him to undergo treatment to render him\n         competent to stand trial.\n\n         (2) The court shall appoint a medical supervisor of the course of treatment. The\n         supervisor may be any person or agency willing to supervise the course of\n         treatment, or the department of mental health.\n\n         (3) The court may commit the defendant to the custody of the department of\n         mental health, or to the custody of any other inpatient mental health facility if it\n         agrees, only if commitment is necessary for the effective administration of the\n         course of treatment. If the defendant, absent commitment to the department of\n         mental health or other inpatient facility, would otherwise be held in a jail or\n         similar place of detention pending trial, the court may enter an order restricting\n         the defendant in his movements to the buildings and grounds of the facility at\n         which he is to be treated.\n\n      MCL 330.2034, as discussed, creates a time limit for the provision of treatment, i.e. 15\nmonths:\n\n         (1) No order or combination of orders issued under [MCL 330.2032 or MCL\n         330.2040], or both, shall have force and effect for a total period in excess of 15\n\n\n1\n A “person requiring treatment,” as defined by MCL 330.1401(1), encompasses individuals with\nmental illness, not cognitive impairments.\n2\n    MCL 330.1515 provides:\n         A court may order the admission of an individual 18 years of age or older who\n         meets both of the following requirements:\n\n            (a) Has been diagnosed as an individual with an intellectual disability.\n\n            (b) Can be reasonably expected within the near future to intentionally or\n         unintentionally seriously physically injure himself or herself or another person,\n         and has overtly acted in a manner substantially supportive of that expectation.\n\n\n                                                 -8-\n\f       months or 1/3 of the maximum sentence the defendant could receive if convicted\n       of the charges against him, whichever is lesser; nor after the charges against the\n       defendant are dismissed.\n\n       (2) The court shall provide for notification of defense counsel, the prosecution,\n       and the medical supervisor of treatment whenever the charges against the\n       defendant are dismissed and whenever an order whose stated time period has not\n       elapsed is voided by the court.\n\n       (3) If the defendant is to be discharged or released because of the expiration of an\n       order or orders under [MCL 330.2032 or MCL 330.2040], the supervisor of\n       treatment prior to the discharge or release may file a petition asserting that the\n       defendant is a person requiring treatment as defined by [MCL 330.1401] or meets\n       the criteria for judicial admission as defined by [MCL 330.1515] with the probate\n       court of the defendant’s county of residence [, i.e. a civil commitment].\n\n       When a defendant has been deemed incompetent to stand trial, the medical supervisor of\ntreatment is required to periodically supplement his or her report to the court “at least once every\n90 days.” MCL 330.2038(1)(a). Reports are also required\n\n          (b) Whenever he is of the opinion that the defendant is no longer incompetent\n       to stand trial.\n\n          (c) Whenever he is of the opinion that there is not a substantial probability that\n       the defendant, with treatment, will attain competence to stand trial within the time\n       limit established by [MCL 330.2034]. [MCL 330.2038(1).]\n\n        MCL 330.2040 governs the determination of a defendant’s continued incompetency to\nstand trial:\n\n       (1) The court shall forthwith hear and redetermine the issue of the incompetence\n       of the defendant to stand trial and, if the defendant is redetermined incompetent to\n       stand trial, shall hear and determine whether the defendant has made progress\n       toward attaining competence to stand trial during his course of treatment,\n       whenever the court receives a report from the supervisor of treatment, unless the\n       defense waives the hearing, or whenever deemed appropriate by the court.\n\n       (2) [MCL 330.2030] shall govern hearings held pursuant to this section.\n\n       (3) If the defendant is not redetermined incompetent to stand trial at a hearing\n       held pursuant to this section, trial shall commence as soon as practicable. If the\n       defendant is redetermined incompetent to stand trial, and if the court determines\n       that the defendant has made progress toward attaining competence to stand trial,\n       the court may modify or continue any orders it previously issued under [MCL\n       330.2032].\n\n\n\n\n                                                -9-\n\fThe defendant’s time spent incarcerated or institutionalized pending competency to stand trial is\nnot simply wasted time; it may be credited against the defendant’s eventual sentence. MCL\n330.2042.\n\n       The dismissal of charges is governed by MCL 330.2044, which provides:\n\n       (1) The charges against a defendant determined incompetent to stand trial shall be\n       dismissed:\n\n          (a) When the prosecutor notifies the court of his intention not to prosecute the\n       case; or\n\n          (b) Fifteen months after the date on which the defendant was originally\n       determined incompetent to stand trial.\n\n       (2) When charges are dismissed pursuant to subsection (1), the same charges, or\n       other charges arising from the transaction which gave rise to the dismissed\n       charges, shall not subsequently be filed against the defendant, except as provided\n       in this section.\n\n                                              ***\n\n       (4) The court shall grant permission to again file charges if after a hearing it\n       determines that the defendant is competent to stand trial. Prior to the hearing, the\n       court may order the defendant to be examined by personnel of the center for\n       forensic psychiatry or other qualified person as an outpatient, but may not commit\n       the defendant to the center or any other facility for the examination.\n\n                                        IV. ANALYSIS\n\n       The prosecutor correctly contends that the circuit court was not permitted to dismiss the\ncharges under the circumstances presented.\n\n                                A. PREREQUISITE HEARING\n\n        It is within the power of the circuit court to “determine the capacity of a defendant.”\nMCL 330.2020(1). That decision, as with any judicial decision, must be based in fact. See\nDemosthenes v Baal, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112441\"><a href=\"/opinion/112441/demosthenes-v-baal/\"><span class=\"volume\">495</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">731</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 735; </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112441\"><a href=\"/opinion/112441/demosthenes-v-baal/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">762</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1990). The judgment\nof a defendant’s competence and “whether there is a substantial probability that the defendant”\ncould attain competence must be based on “the evidence admitted at the hearing.” MCL\n330.2030(2). The circuit court conducted such a hearing on August 22, 2013. The only evidence\nat the hearing was the CFP report, which indicated that defendant’s cognitive impairment\nrendered him currently incompetent to stand trial, a point with which the court agreed. The\nreport also included the evaluator’s opinion that education regarding the legal process could\nallow defendant “in a basic way, to work with his attorney,” allowing him to potentially attain\ncompetence within 15 months. Although the court was “not completely sold” on this conclusion,\nit accepted the report and held defendant for treatment geared toward preparing him for trial.\n\n\n                                              -10-\n\f        The lack of treatment in the interim prompted the court to change its mind at the October\n29 hearing. The only evidence at the hearing was that the Kalamazoo Psychiatric Hospital would\nnot have an open bed for other six to eight weeks. From this fact alone, the circuit court jumped\nto the conclusion that defendant would not be able to attain the requisite level of competency to\nstand trial within the statutory 15-month period. More is required by the Mental Health Code,\nhowever.\n\n        MCL 330.2030(2) demands that a competency determination be made “[o]n the basis of\nthe evidence admitted at the hearing” following the presentation of the CFP report. MCL\n330.2040 similarly demands a hearing before a “redetermination” of competency is made. If the\ndefendant remains incompetent, MCL 330.2040(1) mandates that the court “hear and determine\nwhether the defendant has made progress toward attaining competence.” Such a hearing must be\nheld each time the CFP provides a supplemental report (unless waived by the defendant), or at\nother times “deemed appropriate by the court.” And any hearing conducted pursuant to MCL\n330.2040(1) must comport with MCL 330.2030. MCL 330.2040(2).\n\n       Here, there was no subsequent report from the CFP. Accordingly, the October 29 hearing\nwas scheduled based on the circuit court’s discretionary power under MCL 330.2040(1). The\nOctober 29 hearing had to be conducted consistent with the procedures of MCL 330.2030. MCL\n330.2030(2) provides, “The defense, prosecution, and the court on its own motion may present\nadditional evidence relevant to the issues to be determined at the hearing.” The court denied the\nprosecutor the opportunity to present additional evidence, ruling that competency is “a judicial\ndecision” and would be made solely on the stipulated CFP report. While the CFP report was\nadmissible, MCL 330.2030(3), this was not to the exclusion of other evidence the prosecutor\nmay have wanted to present. Absent a hearing at which the prosecutor could present evidence\nregarding defendant’s ability to attain competence, the court improperly rendered any decision\nregarding defendant’s continued incompetence.\n\n                                 B. REMEDY OF DISMISSAL\n\n        Moreover, with or without a hearing, dismissal of the charges against defendant was not\nthe proper remedy. MCL 330.2044 “is the procedural vehicle for enforcing a defendant’s right\nnot to be confined solely because of incompetency.” People v Miller, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1348562\"><a href=\"/opinion/1348562/people-v-miller/\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">631</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 636; 489\nNW2d 60 (1992). MCL 330.2044(1) provides only two circumstances meriting a trial court’s\ndismissal of the criminal action: (a) upon notification by the prosecutor of his intent to drop the\ncharges, and (b) if the defendant remains incompetent to stand trial 15 months after the original\nincompetency ruling. Neither of these situations existed in this case. The prosecutor repeatedly\nexpressed his desire to pursue the pending charges. And at the time of the October 29, 2013\nhearing, 15 months had not elapsed since the original incompetency determination. Accordingly,\nthe circuit court lacked statutory authority simply to dismiss the matter.\n\n        In Jackson, 406 US at 717, the defendant was a deaf, mute, severely mentally impaired\nman who could only communicate through rudimentary sign language. On two separate\noccasions, the defendant stole property from women with a total value of $9. Id. Evidence at a\npretrial competency hearing revealed that no level of treatment could render the defendant\ncompetent to stand trial. Id. at 718-719, 725. Even so, the trial court ordered the defendant’s\ncommitment “until such time as [the Indiana Department of Mental Health] should certify to the\n\n                                               -11-\n\fcourt that ‘the defendant is sane.’ ” Id. at 719. The defendant’s appeal travelled all the way to\nthe Supreme Court because it amounted to an indefinite commitment despite that he had never\nbeen convicted of a criminal offense. Id.\n\n         The Indiana statutes governing “pretrial commitment of incompetent criminal\ndefendants,” like those in Michigan, grant the authority to render the incompetency decision to\nthe trial court alone. Id. at 720. The Indiana statutes, however, authorized the court to detain the\ncriminal defendant indefinitely in the treatment facility until “whenever the defendant shall\nbecome sane.” Id. Moreover, the Indiana scheme did not provide for periodic court review of\nthe criminal defendant’s mental condition. Id. The defendant in Jackson contended that the\ncourt should have proceeded under the state’s civil commitment procedures to protect the\ndefendant’s rights. Id. at 721. Under the civil procedure, a “feeble-minded” person may be\nreleased from confinement upon such time that the supervising agency deems that “the mental\nand physical condition of the patient justifies it.” Id.\n\n        Relevant to the current appeal, the United States Supreme Court held: “Indiana’s\nindefinite commitment of a criminal defendant solely on account of his incompetency to stand\ntrial does not square with the Fourteenth Amendment’s guarantee of due process.” Id. at 731.\nThe indefiniteness of the commitment period arises because the statutes take no account of the\ndefendant’s likelihood of improvement, requiring institutionalization until the defendant attains\nsanity. Id. at 725, 727.\n\n        The Court pointed to the federal procedures for managing incompetent criminal\ndefendants as a contrast. Under 18 USC 4246, a criminal defendant could be held before trial\n“until the accused shall be mentally competent to stand trial.” Federal courts had applied the\nsubsequent statutory provision, 18 USC 4247, to such pretrial commitments even though it\nfacially applied only to convicted defendants deemed incompetent while serving their sentences.\nJackson, 406 US at 731-732. Section 4247 permitted commitment of a prisoner, rather than\nrelease at the natural end of his sentence, if deemed “insane or mentally incompetent” and a\ndanger to himself or others. Jackson, 406 US at 732. Under this rubric, the prisoner must be\nreleased once he is no longer a danger. Id. The federal courts applied this statute to create “a\n‘rule of reasonableness’ ” for pretrial detention. Id. at 733. Specifically, if a defendant is\ndeemed incompetent to stand trial, he “can be held only for a ‘reasonable period of time’\nnecessary to determine whether there is a substantial chance of his attaining the capacity to stand\ntrial in the foreseeable future. If the chances are slight, or if the defendant does not in fact\nimprove, then he must be released” or granted a hearing to consider whether he poses a danger.\nId.\n\n       Later that same year, the United States Supreme Court considered the detention of\nincompetent individuals beyond the expiration of their criminal sentence. In McNeil v Director,\nPatuxent Institution, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108579\"><a href=\"/opinion/108579/mcneil-v-director-patuxent-institution/\"><span class=\"volume\">407</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">245</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 246; </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108579\"><a href=\"/opinion/108579/mcneil-v-director-patuxent-institution/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">719</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1972), the defendant was\nconvicted of assault and sentenced to five years’ imprisonment. The sentencing court ordered\nthe defendant’s transport to Patuxent Institution, rather than prison, “to determine whether he\nshould be committed to that institution for an indeterminate term” as a defective delinquent. Id.\nThe defendant remained institutionalized after the expiration of his sentence, the Institution\nalleged, because he refused to cooperate so that a valid assessment could be made. Id. The\ndefendant’s challenge was not to the “criteria and procedures” governing Maryland defective-\n\n                                               -12-\n\fdelinquency hearings; no such hearing had yet been conducted. Id. at 248. Rather, the\ndefendant’s challenge was that “[h]is confinement rest[ed] wholly on the order committing him\nfor examination, in preparation for such a commitment hearing.” Id. “That order was made, not\non the basis of an adversary hearing, but on the basis of an ex parte judicial determination that\nthere was ‘reasonable cause to believe that the Defendant may be a Defective Delinquent,’ ” the\nCourt continued. Id. (citation omitted).\n\n        The Institution in McNeil raised two grounds to support its indefinite commitment of the\ndefendant: “that a commitment for observation need not be surrounded by the procedural\nsafeguards (such as an adversary hearing) that are appropriate for a final determination of\ndefective delinquency,” id. at 249, and that the defendant’s commitment was akin to a civil\ncontempt because his obstreperous behavior prevented examination. Id. at 250. The Supreme\nCourt rejected both contentions. In relation to the first, the Court held, “A confinement that is in\nfact indeterminate cannot rest on procedures designed to authorize a brief period of observation.”\nId. at 249. Citing Jackson, 406 US at 738, the McNeil Court further held:\n\n       If the commitment is properly regarded as a short-term confinement with a limited\n       purpose, as the respondent suggests, then lesser safeguards may be appropriate,\n       but by the same token, the duration of the confinement must be strictly limited.\n       “Due process requires that the nature and duration of commitment bear some\n       reasonable relation to the purpose for which the individual is committed.” Just as\n       that principle limits the permissible length of a commitment on account of\n       incompetence to stand trial, so it also limits the permissible length of a\n       commitment “for observation.” [McNeil, 407 US at 249-250.]\n\nThe Court declined to “set a precise time limit” as the Maryland statute actually included a six-\nmonth observation period. Id. at 250. The state had violated the intention of this protection by\npermitting repeated extensions. Id.\n\n         In relation to the second ground, the Court noted, “if confinement is to rest on a theory of\ncivil contempt, then due process requires a hearing to determine whether petitioner has in fact\nbehaved in a manner that amounts to contempt.” Id. at 251. The hearing would permit the trial\ncourt to determine whether the defendant’s contemptuous conduct was actually caused by mental\nillness, or whether it was a willful violation of court orders. Id. In McNeil, the defendant had\nessentially been confined on the basis of contempt “potentially for life, although he ha[d] never\nbeen determined to be in contempt by a procedure that comports with due process.” Id. The\nmeat of McNeil is that a defendant is entitled to a hearing and resolution of his competency\nwithin a reasonable time to ensure he is not held without just cause.\n\n        Just as stated in McNeil, in Michigan, a criminal defendant may not be held indefinitely.\nThe statutes provide a 15-month period in which the defendant must be rendered competent to\nstand trial. If the defendant cannot be so rendered, the prosecutor must pursue civil commitment\nmeasures to maintain the defendant in care. This Court has upheld detainment in the face of this\nstatutorily-designated reasonable-delay period.\n\n       In People v Davis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1924478\"><a href=\"/opinion/1924478/people-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">553</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 557; 332 NW2d 606 (1983), a two-year delay\nseparated “the original order for commitment for forensic examination and the administration of\n\n                                                -13-\n\fthe examination.” During that time, the defendant had been the subject of a civil commitment\nand absconded for approximately seven months from the psychiatric institution. Id. at 556. The\ndefendant contended that the circuit court was required to dismiss the charges against him\npursuant to MCL 330.2044(1)(b) because 15 months had elapsed since he was first deemed\nincompetent and he had yet to attain competency to stand trial. Davis, 123 Mich App at 557.\nThis Court disagreed with the defendant’s calculation of the confinement period following the\ninitial competency determination. Id. Citing Jackson and McNeil, this Court held “that an\nindividual may not be committed to a psychiatric institution for an extended period except after a\ndue process hearing.” Id. at 558. In Davis, however, the defendant was held in the psychiatric\nfacility for a fixed period as a result of his guilty plea, so that no due process violation occurred.\nId. Ultimately, however, the Davis Court remanded for further consideration of the defendant’s\nspeedy trial claim. Id. at 560.\n\n         In People v Bowman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1664800\"><a href=\"/opinion/1664800/people-v-bowman/\"><span class=\"volume\">141</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">390</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 393-396; 367 NW2d 867 (1985), the defendant\nwas repeatedly found incompetent to stand trial in both state court and a previous federal court\nprosecution. He eventually stood trial in state court when the administration of psychotropic\nmedications rendered him competent to understand the proceedings. Id. at 397. The question in\nBowman was the start date of the 15-month period for purposes of MCL 330.2044. Id. at 398.\nThis Court’s analysis, however, bears relevance to this appeal. The Bowman Court noted that\n“procedures for determining a criminal defendant’s competence to stand trial are ultimately\nrooted in principles of due process.” Id. at 399. The statutes therefore must “be interpreted in a\nmanner that protects incompetent defendants from indefinite denials of liberty.” Id. Construing\nvarious provisions together, this Court held that the mental health department has only 15\nmonths to treat the defendant so he can attain competency. Id. at 399-400. MCL 330.2044\nprotects a defendant from an indefinite wait after being found incompetent to stand trial, this\nCourt adjudged. “In order to protect defendants from an indefinite suspension of their right to\ntrial, as opposed to an indefinite suspension of their right to liberty, [MCL 330.2044] requires\nthat charges be dismissed 15 months after the determination of incompetency.” Bowman, 141\nMich App at 400.\n\n        The circuit court exaggerated the delay that arguably could be attributed to the\nprosecution in this case. Defendant was released on bond two months after his arrest, and\nremained free until the August 22 hearing. He was held in the Wayne County Jail from August\n22 through October 29, a period of two months and one week. The waiting list for the\nKalamazoo Psychiatric Hospital would have extended defendant’s jail confinement for\napproximately four months total after the issue of competency had been raised, but defendant\nhad in fact been detained for only two months at the relevant time.

Moreover,\nneither statutory nor constitutional grounds supported dismissal of the charges based on the\ndelay. We do not suggest that the circuit court’s concern for incarcerating a cognitively-\nimpaired 17-year-old boy was misplaced, only that the court chose an impermissible remedy.\nOrdering defendant’s segregation in the jail or releasing defendant to his family’s care on house\narrest would have served the same purpose without violating the statutory provisions.\n\n       Given the lack of a proper hearing and the short duration of the delay, the court was not\npermitted to dismiss the charges over the prosecutor’s objection. We must therefore reverse.\n\n\n                                                -14-\n\f                      C. ALTERNATE GROUNDS FOR AFFIRMANCE\n\n        Defendant characterizes the legal arguments placed before this Court differently and we\nwill consider them as alternate grounds for affirming the circuit court’s decision. Defendant\nasserts that the circuit court actually dismissed the charges because “the court ordered\nexamination regarding Defendant’s competency to stand trial did not take place within the\nstatutorily mandated 60 days.” In this regard, defendant relies upon MCL 330.2028(1), which\ndirects that when a court orders a forensic examination of a defendant’s competency to stand trial\nunder MCL 330.2026, the initial CFP report must be submitted within 60 days. This deadline\nwas not relevant at the October 29 hearing. The court ordered defendant’s examination on June\n6, and the CFP had 60 days from that date to submit its initial report. The CFP submitted its\nreport to the court on August 8 without objection. After the August 22 hearing, the examining\nauthority had 90 days to submit a follow-up treatment report. MCL 330.2038(1)(a). Less than\n90 days elapsed between the August and October hearings and defendant raises no challenge\nbased on MCL 330.2038.\n\n        Defendant also claims that any error in dismissing the charges was harmless because the\ncourt’s order was entered without prejudice. In this regard, defendant cites Miller, 440 Miller\n631, for the proposition that “failure to adhere to the statutory requirements regarding dismissal,\nwhich allow for the refiling of charges, is merely a procedural error resulting in harmless error\nand does not require reversal.” Miller is inapposite.\n\n        In Miller, 440 Mich at 634-635, a defendant was found incompetent to stand trial,\nattained competency through treatment, but then regressed. The defendant was deemed\nincompetent to stand trial for a total period greater than 15 months. Further treatment returned\nthe defendant to competency, he stood trial, and was convicted of first-degree criminal sexual\nconduct. Id. at 635. Once the total period of the defendant’s incompetency to stand trial spanned\n15 months, the defendant repeatedly sought dismissal of the charges against him under MCL\n330.2044, but the trial court rejected his attempts. Id. This Court reversed the defendant’s\nconvictions, holding that dismissal was required because the defendant was incompetent at the\ntime he filed his motion and more than 15 months had elapsed since he was first adjudged\nincompetent to stand trial. Id.\n\n        The Supreme Court reversed this Court’s opinion and reinstated the defendant’s\nconvictions. The Court cited MCL 330.20144(3) and (4), which permit the prosecution to refile\ncharges against a defendant once he regains competency. Because the charges could be refiled,\nthe failure to dismiss the charges during the period of incompetency was harmless:\n\n       A violation of [MCL 330.2044(1)(b)] predicated solely on the erroneous denial of\n       a motion to dismiss constitutes a ground for reversal only where it is claimed that\n       the failure to dismiss denied defendant a substantive right, to wit: the barring of\n       the charge or prejudice caused by the delay resulting from a violation of [MCL\n       330.2044(1)(b)]. Failure to dismiss after expiration of a total period of fifteen\n       months is not error on which reversal can be predicated. [Miller, 440 Mich at\n       636.]\n\n\n\n                                               -15-\n\fThe Court continued:\n\n       Although hardly a model of clarity, the structure of the act and the legislative\n       history suggest that [MCL 330.2044(3) and (4)] are limitation provisions and that\n       reversal of a conviction would be warranted in respect to nonlife offenses only\n       where the time lapse from initial adjudication of incompetence exceeds one third\n       of the maximum sentence or causes prejudice to the defendant’s substantive\n       rights. [Id. at 637.]\n\n        Unlike in Miller, the circuit court in this case dismissed the charges against defendant\nbecause he had yet to begin treatment geared toward attaining competency, and treatment would\nlikely be delayed another two months. The court did not dismiss the charges because the 15-\nmonth statutory period had expired. Indeed, defendant’s period of incompetency had lasted\nnowhere near this limitation period. Based on the delay, the circuit court reversed its initial\ndetermination and found that defendant would not likely attain competence within the 15-month\nstatutory period. However, the delay in beginning defendant’s treatment was an insufficient\nbasis to support that defendant was unlikely to attain competence. The circuit court’s focus must\nbe “whether, if provided a course of treatment, a substantial probability exists that a defendant\nfound to be incompetent will attain competence within the time limit established.” Id. at 637-\n638 (emphasis added). Once the circuit court initially determined that defendant could attain\ncompetence, the Kalamazoo Psychiatric Hospital had a full “15 months within which to treat\ndefendant.” Bowman, 141 Mich App at 400. The hospital notified the court that it would be\nunable to treat defendant for another six to eight weeks, amounting to a total four-month delay\nbetween being adjudged incompetent to stand trial and beginning treatment. Though such a\ndelay is not preferable and should be avoided if at all possible, it is mere speculation that\ndefendant would remain incompetent for the entire 15 months provided by statute. MCL\n330.2034(1). Therefore, the circuit court lacked statutory authority to dismiss the charges and its\nerror was not harmless under Miller.\n\n        We reverse and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion. We do not retain\njurisdiction.\n\n\n\n                                                            /s/ Elizabeth L. Gleicher\n                                                            /s/ Mark J.
