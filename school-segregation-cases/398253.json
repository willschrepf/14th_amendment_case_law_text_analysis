See  Kerr-Selgas v.  American\r                                                                           \r\n\nAirlines, Inc., 69 F.3d 1205, 1206 (1st Cir. 1995).\r                        \r\n\n          Coastal  Fuels  of Puerto  Rico,  Inc. (\"Coastal\")  was\r\n\nformed in  1989  as a  wholly-owned subsidiary  of Coastal  Fuels\r\n\nMarketing,   Inc.  (\"CFMI\"),  a  company  that  ran  marine  fuel\r\n\noperations in  numerous ports  using a staff  of sales  agents in\r\n\nMiami,  Florida.  Caribbean  Petroleum Corp. (\"CAPECO\")  owns and\r\n\noperates a  refinery in  Bayam n, Puerto  Rico, which  produces a\r\n\n                               -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\nnumber of fuel products, as  well as residual fuel.   A principal\r\n\nuse of residual fuel is in the production of \"bunker fuel,\" which\r\n\nis  used by cruise ships  and other ocean-going vessels outfitted\r\n\nwith internal combustion or steam engines.\r\n\n          At trial,  Coastal  introduced  testimony  and  letters\r\n\nshowing that CAPECO  had committed to supply Coastal  on the same\r\n\nterms and conditions as other resellers in San Juan, Puerto Rico,\r\n\nin 1990, but Coastal deferred the start of its operations because\r\n\nof uncertainty  due to the  Gulf War.  Eventually,  Coastal began\r\n\nbusiness operations in Puerto Rico in October 1991, buying bunker\r\n\nfuel in San Juan and reselling it to ocean-going  liners at berth\r\n\nin San Juan  Harbor.  Based on CFMI's  experience and reputation,\r\n\nCoastal produced a business plan  which shows that it expected to\r\n\nreach a  sales volume of  100,000 barrels a  month, approximately\r\n\n25-30% of the  sales volume in  San Juan Harbor.   The plan  also\r\n\nshows that  Coastal  assumed it  could  obtain an  average  gross\r\n\nmargin (sales revenues less product costs) of $1.65 a barrel.\r\n\n          In  September  1991, CAPECO  agreed  to  charge Coastal\r\n\nprices  based on a formula involving the previous Thursday/Friday\r\n\nNew York market postings, minus discounts that varied  by volume.\r\n\nThese prices were to cover the six month period from October 1991\r\n\nto   March  1992.     Unknown  to  Coastal,   CAPECO  was  almost\r\n\nsimultaneously  offering Coastal's  two competitors  in San  Juan\r\n\nHarbor, Caribbean Fuel Oil Trading, Inc. (\"Caribbean\") and Harbor\r\n\nFuel Services, Inc. (\"Harbor\"), new contracts that gave Caribbean\r\n\n                               -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\nand Harbor bigger  discounts from the formula  price than Coastal\r\n\nreceived.1   Trial  evidence introduced  by  CAPECO's own  expert\r\n\nwitness quantified  the total  price discrimination  in favor  of\r\n\nCaribbean and Harbor as $682,451.78  for the period from  October\r\n\n1991 to April 1992.\r\n\n          Coastal filed this suit in  May of 1992 when it learned\r\n\nof CAPECO's price discrimination against it.  This court affirmed\r\n\nthe district court's denial of a preliminary injunction requiring\r\n\nthat CAPECO end  its price discrimination.  See  Coastal Fuels of\r                                                                           \r\n\nPuerto Rico, Inc.  v. Caribbean Petroleum Corp., 990  F.2d 25, 26\r                                                         \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1993).  After Coastal filed suit, CAPECO proposed a new\r\n\nprice  formula  to   Coastal.    According  to   trial  testimony\r\n\nintroduced by Coastal, CAPECO basically  made a \"take it or leave\r\n\nit\" offer,  which Coastal took.  Expert testimony Coastal offered\r\n\nat   trial   contended  that   competitively   significant  price\r\n\ndiscrimination  continued until Spring  of 1993, when  CAPECO cut\r\n\nCoastal off entirely.\r\n\n          Additionally,  Coastal presented  evidence that,  while\r\n\nthroughout  this period  CAPECO would  from time  to time  inform\r\n\nCoastal  that it  had  no  fuel available,  in  fact, CAPECO  had\r\n\navailable  fuel.   Coastal also  presented evidence  that  it was\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1  CAPECO  tried to argue below  and again argues here,  that the\r\ncontracts   it   executed   with  Caribbean   and   Harbor   were\r\nqualitatively different  in their non-price  terms and conditions\r\nfrom CAPECO's arrangement with Coastal, justifying the discounts.\r\nCoastal  responds  that  it  was  never  offered  the  terms  and\r\nconditions that Caribbean  and Harbor received.  In  light of the\r\njury's verdict  for Coastal  on the  price discrimination  claim,\r\nfrom conflicting evidence such as  this, we draw the (reasonable)\r\nconclusion in Coastal's favor.\r\n\n                               -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\ndiscriminated against  in terms  of the quality  of fuel  that it\r\n\nreceived  from  CAPECO.    Finally,  on  March  31, 1993,  CAPECO\r\n\ninformed  Coastal in  writing that  it  would not  sell any  more\r\n\nproduct to Coastal, and shortly  thereafter, Coastal went out  of\r\n\nbusiness.\r\n\n          The case was tried to a jury on claims (1) that  CAPECO\r\n\ndiscriminated  in  price in  violation  of  Section  2(a) of  the\r\n\nClayton Act, 38 Stat. 730 (1914) (current version  at 15 U.S.C.  \r\n\n13(a)), as  amended by  the  Robinson-Patman Act,  49 Stat.  1526\r\n\n(1936), and  in violation of  Section 263(a)  of Title 10  of the\r\n\nLaws  of  Puerto  Rico;  (2)  that  CAPECO  monopolized trade  or\r\n\ncommerce in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act and Section\r\n\n260 of  Title 10  of the  Laws of  Puerto Rico;  (3) that  CAPECO\r\n\nviolated Section  5141 of Title 31 of  the Puerto Rico Civil Code\r\n\nby engaging in  tortious conduct  that injured  Coastal; and  (4)\r\n\nthat  CAPECO  committed a  breach  of  contract  in violation  of\r\n\nSections 3371 et  seq. of Title 31 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code.\r                                \r\n\nAs   reflected   in   the   jury's   answers   to   the   Special\r\n\nInterrogatories, the jury found for Coastal on the first three of\r\n\nthese  claims, but  found for  CAPECO on  the breach  of contract\r\n\nclaim.  The jury awarded  damages of $1,500,000 for the antitrust\r\n\nviolations  combined  and  $500,000  for  the  Puerto  Rico  tort\r\n\nviolation.   The  antitrust damages  were trebled, see  15 U.S.C.\r                                                                \r\n\n  15(a), bringing the total award to $5,000,000.\r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r                                                \r\n\n                               -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\n          CAPECO  argues for a  reversal of the  district court's\r\n\njudgment,  or alternatively,  for a  new trial.   We  address the\r\n\narguments for reversal first.\r\n\n                               -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\n                    I.

With respect to matters of  law, our review\r\n\nis de novo.  Sandy River Nursing Care v.

With respect\r\n\nto these  issues, we review  the court's decision de  novo, using\r                                                                    \r\n\nthe  same  stringent  decisional  standards  that controlled  the\r\n\ndistrict  court.

Under these standards,\r              \r\n\njudgment for CAPECO  can only be ordered if  the evidence, viewed\r\n\nin the  light most favorable  to Coastal, points so  strongly and\r\n\noverwhelmingly in  favor of CAPECO, that a  reasonable jury could\r\n\nnot have arrived at a verdict for Coastal.

In  the instant\r\n\ncase, the price discrimination claims flow out of the same set of\r\n\nfacts and  require the same  evidence as the Sherman  Act claims.\r\n\nBecause  we uphold  the district  court's  jurisdiction over  the\r\n\nSherman Act  claims, see 15  U.S.C.   4 (1994)  (investing \"[t]he\r                                  \r\n\nseveral  district  courts  of  the  United  States  .  .  .  with\r\n\njurisdiction to  prevent and  restrain violations  of [Title  15]\r\n\nsections 1 to 7[,]\" which includes the Sherman Act), we also must\r\n\nconclude that the district court properly exercised supplementary\r\n\njurisdiction over the price discrimination claims.\r\n\n          Thus,  we conclude  that the  district  court erred  in\r\n\napplying section 2(a) of the Clayton Act to the conduct at issue,\r\n\nand accordingly  reverse that part  of its opinion.   However, we\r\n\nfind applicable section 263 of the Puerto Rico Anti-Monopoly Act,\r\n\n10 L.P.R.A.   263.

Given the\r\n\nrelative lack  of applicable section  263 case law and  the well-\r\n\ndeveloped jurisprudence concerning  Clayton Act section 2(a),  we\r\n\nwill focus on  the latter in  assessing the price  discrimination\r\n\nclaims.\r\n\n                    2.

Thus, the comparison that the Supreme\r\n\nCourt  drew   between  primary-line   price  discrimination   and\r\n\npredatory pricing  in Brooke  Group  stands on  a different,  and\r                                             \r\n\nstronger, footing than any comparison  that could be made between\r\n\nsecondary-line price discrimination  and other area of  antitrust\r\n\nlaw, including, but not only, predatory pricing. \r\n\n          Third, and  finally, the  holding of  the Brooke  Group\r                                                                           \r\n\nopinion  on its  face  applies only  to  primary-line cases,  not\r\n\nsecondary-line cases.  As a result, given the legislative history\r\n\nand statutory language distinctions, we will not presume, without\r\n\nmore guidance, that the Supreme Court intended in Brooke Group to\r                                                                        \r\n\nalter the well-established rule that it adopted in Morton  Salt.9\r                                                                         \r\n\nThus,  we hold that  the Morton Salt  rule continues  to apply to\r                                              \r\n\nsecondary-line injury cases such as the present one.\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n9   While concerns about overenforcement harming overall consumer\r\nwelfare may  be valid,  the Supreme Court  retains the  option of\r\nspeaking  further  on this  issue.

According to  CAPECO,  overall market\r\n\nforces depressed the  price for bunker fuel more  than 30 percent\r\n\nbetween late 1991  and early 1992,  and it was this  fact, rather\r\n\nthan CAPECO's price discrimination, that led to Coastal's demise.\r\n\nCAPECO  points to the  admission of Coastal's  CEO that Coastal's\r\n\nsales  agents based  their price  quotes to  ships on  the prices\r\n\nbeing charged by  competitors in San Juan and  other ports, often\r\n\nwithout  even  knowing  the  cost of  the  fuel  that  was  to be\r\n\ndelivered.   According to CAPECO,  if prices were set  when costs\r\n\nwere unknown,  then discounts from  CAPECO could not have  been a\r\n\nmaterial factor in setting prices.\r\n\n          We  reject  the  argument  that  this  evidence  rebuts\r\n\nCoastal's  prima facie  showing  of  price  discrimination.

Thus, in\r                                \r\n\nthis case,  the appellants  must \"persuade us  that the  facts of\r\n\nthis case  so conclusively  point to a  verdict in  [their] favor\r\n\nthat  fair-minded people could  not disagree about  the outcome.\"\r\n\nChedd-Angier Production Co., 756 F.2d at 934.\r                                     \r\n\n          Here,  neither section  2(a),  section 263,  nor  their\r\n\nattendant case  law, requires  that the  price discrimination  in\r\n\nquestion be directly  factored into the  prices that favored  and\r\n\ndisfavored  purchaser-resellers   offered  to   their  customers.\r\n\nPresumably,  regardless  of  whether these  costs  were  factored\r\n\ndirectly into  the prices  that  Coastal offered,  or were  later\r\n\ncalculated  into  Coastal's  bottom  line,  these costs  affected\r\n\nCoastal's pricing.  Certainly, no  argument can be made from this\r\n\nevidence  alone that bunker fuel  costs, no matter when accounted\r\n\nfor, were not causally connected to Coastal's lost profits.

On\r\n\nappeal, CAPECO does not complain that the court's instructions to\r\n\nthe jury on the actual  injury requirement were erroneous.

However,  we  need  not  consider  here  whether  this\r\nstandard, which is more favorable to Coastal, applies rather than\r\nthe  standard that CAPECO  advocates, since Coastal  actually did\r\nproffer evidence, albeit only employee testimony, that its prices\r\nwere causing it to lose business.\r\n\n                               -25-\r                                         -25-\r\r\n\nit was both inadmissible hearsay evidence, see Fed.

By contrast,  while Coastal offered similar testimony of\r\n\nfeedback   about  being  undersold,  it  also  put  forth  expert\r\n\n                               -26-\r                                         -26-\r\r\n\ntestimony that  Caribbean and  Harbor had  fully passed  on their\r\n\nlower  costs to  the  ships purchasing  marine  fuel.

CAPECO's  first argument\r                      \r\n\nis that the jury erred in finding San Juan Harbor as the relevant\r\n\ngeographic  market for  bunker  fuel.   In general,  the relevant\r\n\ngeographic  market consists of \"the  geographic area in which the\r\n\ndefendant   faces  competition   and   to  which   consumers  can\r\n\npractically   turn  for  alternative  sources  of  the  product.\"\r\n\nBaxley-DeLamar v.

Coastal apparently had the\r\n\ncapacity to import the residual oil and diesel into San Juan from\r\n\nAruba.   Coastal also  had storage capacity.   CAPECO  feared, so\r\n\nCoastal's theory  went, that  this would  allow  the refinery  in\r\n\nAruba to compete  with CAPECO  and threaten  CAPECO's ability  to\r\n\nsell  its targeted  10,000 barrels  of  residual oil  per day  to\r\n\ndealers.    Coastal's  argument  is  that  CAPECO,  fearing  that\r\n\n                               -28-\r                                         -28-\r\r\n\nCoastal's  affiliate posed a competitive threat, decided to drive\r\n\nCoastal  out  by  (1) engaging  in  price  discrimination against\r\n\nCoastal, (2) discriminating in the provision of residual oil, (3)\r\n\ndiscriminating in the quality of the residual  oil available, and\r\n\n(4) threatening to  cut off plaintiff entirely,  eventually doing\r\n\nso.\r\n\n          Coastal  successfully  argued  to  the  jury  that  the\r\n\nrelevant geographic market was San  Juan Harbor, since neither it\r\n\nnor  its competitors,  Caribbean  and  Harbor, could  practicably\r\n\nobtain supplies in San Juan Harbor from anyone other than CAPECO.\r\n\nCoastal produced  evidence that CAPECO  made 90% of the  sales of\r\n\nbunker  fuel to  resellers in the  San Juan Harbor  market -- and\r\n\nCAPECO does not dispute this figure on appeal.\r\n\n          CAPECO's main argument regarding monopoly power is that\r\n\nthe  choice  of  San  Juan  Harbor as  the  relevant  market  was\r\n\nincorrect.  Instead, it maintains that because the broader market\r\n\nfor bunker fuel  among cruise ships and other  vessels plying the\r\n\nwaters  of the  Caribbean  and  the  southeastern  United  States\r\n\nconstrains the  prices CAPECO  can charge  resellers in  San Juan\r\n\nHarbor, the proper geographic market should have been  defined to\r\n\ninclude a much  wider area.  A larger geographic  market would of\r\n\ncourse lead to a lower figure for the percentage of sales  in the\r\n\nmarket made  by CAPECO, likely defeating the monopoly power prong\r\n\nof the monopolization offense.\r\n\n          In  assessing CAPECO's argument,  we must bear  in mind\r\n\nthat \"market definition is a  question of fact\" and \"we therefore\r\n\n                               -29-\r                                         -29-\r\r\n\nmust affirm the jury's conclusion  unless the record is devoid of\r\n\nevidence   upon  which  the   jury  might  reasonably   base  its\r\n\nconclusion.\"  Weiss v.

Coastal presented  evidence that\r\n\nresellers in San  Juan (Harbor, Caribbean and  Coastal) purchased\r\n\n90% of their  supplies for bunker  fuel from CAPECO.   CAPECO, in\r\n\ncontrast,  has  argued  that  the  relevant  market  is  broader,\r\n\nconsisting of all  sales of residual oil  for bunker fuel in  the\r\n\nCaribbean  and  Southeastern United  States.   Our review  of the\r\n\nissue leads us to  conclude that it would  be unreasonable for  a\r\n\njuror  to infer  from the  evidence presented  that the  sales of\r\n\nresidual  oil for  bunker  fuel  outside of  San  Juan should  be\r\n\nexcluded from the relevant market.\r\n\n          The  residual oil CAPECO  sells is blended  with diesel\r\n\ninto bunker fuel  and sold by resellers like  Coastal, Harbor and\r\n\nCaribbean  to large ocean-going  vessels.  Residual  oil refiners\r\n\nand  bunker fuel  resellers exist  throughout  the Caribbean  and\r\n\nSoutheastern United States.   The parties  agree that the  ocean-\r\n\ngoing vessels can choose to  refuel from whatever supplier in the\r\n\nCaribbean and Southeastern United States offers the best terms as\r\n\nto price, quality and dependability.   The market for bunker fuel\r\n\nis  therefore extremely  fluid and  competitive,  as the  parties\r\n\nagree.\r\n\n          Coastal  argues  that,  because  of  this  competition,\r\n\nmargins  for  resellers  are  razor  thin  and  it  is  virtually\r\n\nimpossible for  a reseller in  San Juan, like Coastal,  to obtain\r\n\nresidual  oil  from  anyone  other  than  CAPECO.    Transporting\r\n\nsupplies from other  refineries, such as the refinery  Coastal is\r\n\naffiliated with in  Aruba, would increase the cost of the fuel to\r\n\n                               -33-\r                                         -33-\r\r\n\nsuch an extent (transportation costs, import taxes, risk of price\r\n\nchanges, and storage costs) that it is not an economically viable\r\n\nalternative.  (Of course, this is, it might be observed, somewhat\r\n\ninconsistent with  the theory  that CAPECO was  so afraid  of the\r\n\n'threat' from  Coastal and  its Aruba  affiliate,  that it  drove\r\n\nCoastal  out   of  business.)     Consequently,  Coastal  argues,\r\n\nresellers of bunker  fuel must purchase from CAPECO  when they do\r\n\nbusiness in San Juan.  In Coastal's view, the San Juan resellers'\r\n\ninability to purchase  from suppliers outside  of San Juan  makes\r\n\nSan Juan the relevant market.\r\n\n          We  do not agree.  The  touchstone of market definition\r\n\nis whether  a hypothetical  monopolist could  raise prices.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nRebel Oil Co., 51 F.3d at 1434.  Although a reseller based in San\r                       \r\n\nJuan  may have nowhere else to turn  to in San Juan for its fuel,\r\n\nCoastal  did  not  produce sufficient  evidence  that  this meant\r\n\nCAPECO has the ability to restrict supply and raise prices in San\r\n\nJuan to supracompetitive levels.   Indeed, the evidence points in\r\n\nthe other  direction.   CAPECO cannot sell  its residual  oil for\r\n\nbunker fuel  unless it does so at a  price at which the resellers\r\n\nwill  be able  to sell  the fuel to  its ultimate  consumers, the\r\n\nocean-going vessels.   Those ocean-going vessels can  go anywhere\r\n\nin the  Caribbean  and Southeastern  United States  to get  their\r\n\nbunker  fuel.   If  CAPECO  were  to  raise  its  prices  to  the\r\n\nresellers, the resellers  could not offer the bunker  fuel to the\r\n\nocean-going  vessels  at competitive  prices and  the ocean-going\r\n\nvessels would simply get their fuel at another port.\r\n\n                               -34-\r                                         -34-\r\r\n\n          Given these facts, the immobility of the resellers does\r\n\nnot mean  that CAPECO could  maximize profits  by raising  prices\r\n\nsignificantly above the competitive level.  Raising prices in San\r\n\nJuan  would repel the  ultimate consumers,  who would  seek other\r\n\nsuppliers.  The  resellers would either stop  purchasing residual\r\n\nfuel or  cease business,  or both.   CAPECO would  then lose  its\r\n\nability  to sell its residual oil for  bunker fuel and this would\r\n\nredound to the benefit of CAPECO's competitors.  While under most\r\n\ncircumstances  the  immobility  of  the  resellers  would  be  of\r\n\nconsiderable  importance  in  defining the  market,  it  does not\r\n\ncontrol  here  where  the  mobility  of  the  ultimate  consumers\r\n\nprotects  the immobile resellers.

While\r\n\nCoastal might, at least in theory, have shown that all refineries\r\n\nthroughout  the  Caribbean  and the  Southeastern  United  States\r\n\nbehaved like  a cartel and  priced their residual oil  to capture\r\n\nthe transportation  and other costs  of getting oil  from sources\r\n\noutside the  local ports,  it has  not done  so here  and it  has\r\n\nfailed  to produce evidence  sufficient for a  reasonable jury to\r\n\ninfer that such  was the case.

According to  CAPECO,\r\n\nbecause the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has recently declined to\r\n\nrule that violation of an antitrust statute will also necessarily\r\n\ngive  rise to a  violation of Article  1802, the  violation of an\r\n\nantitrust statute  does not give  rise to a  per se violation  of\r                                                             \r\n\nArticle 1802.

Additionally, CAPECO challenges the sufficiency of the\r\n\nevidence supporting the judgment on  this issue.  CAPECO asks for\r\n\na reversal of the verdict on these grounds.\r\n\n          CAPECO's  arguments may well  have merit.   However, we\r\n\nneed  express no opinion  regarding CAPECO's arguments  as CAPECO\r\n\nwaived them  by  failing  to  object  to  the  jury  instructions\r\n\nregarding the  Article 1802  claim.  See  Linn v.  Andover Newton\r                                                                           \r\n\nTheological School, Inc., 874  F.2d 1, 5.

By  failing to  object  to  the  jury\r\n\ninstructions,  CAPECO denied \"the judge an opportunity to correct\r\n\nhis  error,\" assuming that CAPECO  rightly contends that an error\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n13  Article 1802 states, in pertinent part, that:\r\n\n            [a]  person who  by  an  act or  omission\r\n            causes damage to another through fault or\r\n            negligence shall be obliged to repair the\r\n            damage so done.\r\n\nId.\r             \r\n\n                               -37-\r                                         -37-\r\r\n\nwas made.  Id.  While CAPECO may correctly contend that antitrust\r                        \r\n\nviolations  do not  fall within  the scope  of Article  1802, the\r\n\ndistrict court's jury  instructions were not strictly  limited to\r\n\nantitrust  offenses.    It  is  entirely  possible that,  had  an\r\n\nobjection been  made, the district  court could have  charged the\r\n\njury with antitrust offenses as an Article 1802 ground separately\r\n\nfrom  other Article  1802 grounds  that may  have applied  in the\r\n\npresent case.  For example,  it could have charged the jury  with\r\n\ntortious interference  with contractual  relations, since  CAPECO\r\n\nmay well have intentionally complicated, via its refusal to deal,\r\n\nCoastal's efforts to meet its obligations to deliver bunker fuel.\r\n\nSee General Office Products Corp. v.

As a  practical matter,  it would  be difficult,  if not\r\nimpossible, for a  juror to segregate antitrust damages  due to a\r\nmonopolization   offense   but   not   due   to   illegal   price\r\ndiscrimination  from   antitrust  damages   due  only  to   price\r\ndiscrimination, where as here, the  facts and conduct involved in\r\nboth allegations greatly overlap.  \r\n\n                               -41-\r                                         -41-\r\r\n\nallow  the  verdict   to  stand  despite  our   reversal  of  the\r\n\nmonopolization verdict,  there would exist the  strong likelihood\r\n\nthat the jury  had granted Coastal  a duplicative recovery  under\r\n\nmonopolization  and  tort  law,  for injury  caused  by  the same\r\n\nconduct, such as  refusal to  deal and  lying.

Duplicative Judgment\r\n\n          In  support of  its  request for  a  new trial,  CAPECO\r\n\nargues  that  the  damages awards  constituted  an  impermissible\r\n\ndouble recovery.   CAPECO contends that both  Coastal's antitrust\r\n\nand tort claims were grounded in  the same set of acts.   Because\r\n\nwe  vacate and remand the  antitrust damages for further findings\r\n\non price  discrimination damages, we  construe CAPECO's  argument\r\n\nthat price  discrimination  and  tort  damages  would  constitute\r\n\nduplicative damage recoveries,   see Borden  v. Paul Revere  Life\r                                                                           \r\n\nIns.

First,\r\n\nCAPECO failed  to object to  the form or  content of  the special\r\n\ninterrogatories to which the  jury answered.  Second, CAPECO  may\r\n\nwell have  waived its right  to raise  this issue here,  since it\r\n\nfailed to  raise the  issue  in a  timely manner  with the  trial\r\n\ncourt.  Previously, we have held  that a defendant may not  argue\r\n\n                               -43-\r                                         -43-\r\r\n\nverdict inconsistency  if he or  she failed to object  \"after the\r\n\nverdict  was read  and  before  the jury  was  discharged.\"   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nMcIsaac v.

This  rule is grounded in the realization that \"to decide\r\n\notherwise   would   countenance    'agreeable   acquiescence   to\r\n\nperceivable  error  as a  weapon  of appellate  advocacy.'\"   Id.\r                                                                           \r\n\n(quoting Merchant  v.

As  we have noted above,  Coastal may\r                 \r\n\nhave had a  legitimate Article 1802 claim apart  from any overlap\r\n\nwith antitrust law.  Had CAPECO chosen to object to  the district\r\n\ncourt's  instructions, the district court may have corrected this\r\n\nproblem.  Accordingly,  giving the district court the  benefit of\r\n\nthe doubt, had  it responded to a timely  objection by CAPECO and\r\n\ngiven  an  Article 1802  instruction  that did  not  overlap with\r\n\nantitrust  claims,  the  jury's  damages  verdicts  on  tort  and\r\n\nantitrust  claims could  have been  consistent.   Even  assuming,\r\n\narguendo,   that  CAPECO  correctly  asserts  that  such  overlap\r                  \r\n\noccurred,  to grant  CAPECO  a new  trial  now  on the  basis  of\r\n\nduplicative recovery  would allow it  to avoid the result  of its\r\n\nown failure to object to the Article 1802 instruction.\r\n\n                       B.  CAPECO's Experts\r                                 B.  CAPECO's Experts\r\n\n                               -44-\r                                         -44-\r\r\n\n          Additionally, CAPECO  argues that the  district court's\r\n\nrefusal to allow its two experts, Dr. Jorge Freyre (\"Dr. Freyre\")\r\n\nand  Dr. El as Guti rrez (\"Dr.  Guti rrez\"), to testify was based\r\n\non a fundamental error of law and was an abuse of discretion that\r\n\nrequires  that we  reverse the  district  court and  order a  new\r\n\ntrial.\r\n\n          In  order  to evaluate  CAPECO's  contentions, we  must\r\n\nreview the district court's orders leading up to the exclusion of\r\n\nthe  relevant  testimony.   The  district court's  June  22, 1993\r\n\nScheduling Order  stated that  \"[t]he parties  will announce  the\r\n\nnames and  qualifications of their  experts by October  1, 1993.\"\r\n\nThis  date was  modified subsequently  to December  1, 1993.   In\r\n\ncompliance  with   this  order,  CAPECO   named  C sar   Figueroa\r\n\n(\"Figueroa\")    and    Rafael    Mart nez-Margarida   (\"Mart nez-\r\n\nMargarida\").   On March  1, 1994,  pursuant to  a  motion by  new\r\n\ncounsel for Caribbean,  the district court modified  the previous\r\n\norder and issued a revised  scheduling order stating \"all experts\r\n\nare to be announced by March 30,\" and also specifying that expert\r\n\nreports to be used \"during each party's case-in-chief\" were to be\r\n\nexchanged on June 3, 1994,  and that expert rebuttal reports were\r\n\nto be exchanged  on July 1, 1994.   Upon CAPECO's June  1 motion,\r\n\nthe date for reports to be exchanged was extended  by an \"Omnibus\r\n\nOrder\" to  ten days after service of that order, dated August 15,\r\n\n1994.   On August  29, 1994, Coastal  delivered to  CAPECO expert\r\n\nreports  prepared by  Dr. Sherwin  and  Dr. Zalacain, and  CAPECO\r\n\nprovided  Coastal with  an expert  report  prepared by  Figueroa.\r\n\n                               -45-\r                                         -45-\r\r\n\nThese  experts were deposed between September 9 and September 14,\r\n\nand  thereafter  CAPECO  retained  experts  Dr.  Freyre  and  Dr.\r\n\nGuti rrez ostensibly as  rebuttal witnesses under Fed. R. Civ. P.\r\n\n26(a)(2)(C).  CAPECO informed Coastal on September 20, 1994, that\r\n\nit had retained  Dr. Freyre as a rebuttal  witness, and similarly\r\n\ninformed Coastal  of Dr. Guti rrez  on or about October  4, 1994.\r\n\nCAPECO informed  the  district court  about  Dr. Freyre  and  Dr.\r\n\nGuti rrez on October 5, 1995.\r\n\n          The  district  court   instructed  CAPECO  to   produce\r\n\nDr. Freyre  and Dr.  Guti rrez  and to  make  them available  for\r\n\ndepositions.  On  October 5 and October 6,  Coastal filed motions\r\n\nin limine to  exclude Dr. Freyre and Dr. Guti rrez, respectively,\r\n\non   the  theory   that  neither   witness   could  properly   be\r\n\ncharacterized as  a \"rebuttal\" witness within the meaning of Rule\r\n\n26(a)(2)(C), and thus both should have been disclosed previously.\r\n\nAfter  oral argument, the district court granted Coastal's motion\r\n\nand excluded the testimony of  Dr. Freyre and Dr. Guti rrez.  The\r\n\ndistrict court, upon  CAPECO's admission that  it planned to  use\r\n\nDr. Freyre  and Dr. Guti rrez  in its  case-in-chief, noted  that\r\n\n\"you got a problem  with my orders because you  have not complied\r\n\nwith my orders  insofar as Freyre and Guti rrez [are] concerned,\"\r\n\napparently referring  to the  previous scheduling order  deadline\r\n\nfor experts in the case-in-chief to be disclosed.\r\n\n          CAPECO  argues (1) that  because the Omnibus  Order did\r\n\nnot  provide  a deadline  for  the  exchange  of rebuttal  expert\r\n\nreports,   no  scheduling  order   applied,  and   therefore  the\r\n\n                               -46-\r                                         -46-\r\r\n\ndisclosure of Dr. Freyre and Dr. Guti rrez was controlled by Rule\r\n\n26(a)(2)(C);17  and (2) that the district court misconstrued Rule\r\n\n26(a)(2)(C) to signify that a defendant cannot offer testimony to\r\n\n\"contradict  or  rebut\"  under  Rule 26(a)(2)(C).    We  need not\r\n\nconsider whether  the district  court in  fact misconstrued  Rule\r\n\n26(a)(2)(C),  because,  for three  reasons, we  find no  abuse of\r\n\ndiscretion  in its  exclusion  of  these  witnesses  as  rebuttal\r\n\nwitnesses.  First, at no time  did CAPECO ever seek leave of  the\r\n\ncourt  to  announce  the  names  of  experts  not  disclosed   by\r\n\nDecember 1, 1993, as  originally required, or by  March 30, 1994,\r\n\nas  permitted by  the  trial court.   CAPECO's  motion of  June 1\r\n\nsought extension  principally  due to  alleged noncooperation  by\r\n\nCoastal  in discovery, making CAPECO's experts' task difficult to\r\n\ncomplete by the deadline then in effect.  We cannot  conclude, as\r\n\nCAPECO  does, that  the Omnibus  Order's  extension rendered  all\r\n\nother  orders unbinding.   Because  CAPECO  did not  ask for  its\r\n\nextension on the grounds it  now argues, the district court could\r\n\nnot  have  had  such an  effect  in  mind, nor  was  it  given an\r\n\nopportunity to consider such effect.   A trial court may \"readily\r\n\nexclude a  witness or exhibit  if some previous  order had set  a\r\n\ndeadline  for  identification and  the  proponent [has],  without\r\n\nadequate excuse, failed  to list the witness or  exhibit.\"  Fusco\r                                                                           \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n17    Rule  26's   schedule  concerning  the  duty   to  disclose\r\ninformation concerning expert witnesses and their opinions may be\r\naltered by  the court.

The  proximity in time  between\r\n\nCAPECO's attempts  to bring in  Dr. Freyre and Dr.  Guti rrez and\r\n\nactual trial casts doubt on  any argument that CAPECO was somehow\r\n\nmisled  into thinking  that previous  Scheduling  Orders did  not\r\n\napply.   Finally, even assuming  that CAPECO is correct  that the\r\n\nScheduling Order's  provisions regarding  rebuttal witnesses  had\r\n\nbeen superceded and  thus Rule 26(a)(2)(B) applied,  the district\r\n\ncourt  might still have enforced its previous deadlines regarding\r\n\nexperts in the case-in-chief.  For  better or for worse, at  oral\r\n\nargument  on October  21, 1994  (three days  before trial  was to\r\n\nstart),   counsel  for  CAPECO  identified  Dr.  Freyre  and  Dr.\r\n\nGuti rrez as witnesses in its case-in-chief.18\r\n\n          Given  the circumstances, we  cannot conclude  that the\r\n\nexclusion of the testimony of Dr. Freyre and Dr. Guti rrez was an\r\n\nabuse of discretion warranting a new trial.\r\n\n             C.

In Falls City,\r                                                                          \r\n\nthe  Supreme Court concluded  that Congress intended  the meeting\r\n\ncompetition  defense \"to allow reasonable pricing responses on an\r\n\narea-specific  basis  where   competitive  circumstances  warrant\r\n\nthem.\"   Id. at 448.   Here, the district court  could reasonably\r                      \r\n\nconclude  that the defense did not  apply, since there was a lack\r\n\nof  evidence, beyond CAPECO's own employees' testimony about what\r\n\nthey believed to  be the case, that CFMI offered  lower prices on\r\n\nbunker fuel in San Juan than CAPECO.  See Rose  Confections, Inc.\r                                                                           \r\n\nv.

CAPECO's Puerto Rico Law Tort Counterclaim\r                    D.  CAPECO's Puerto Rico Law Tort Counterclaim\r\n\n          CAPECO  contends  that  the  district  court  erred  in\r\n\ndismissing its counterclaim grounded in Article 1802, 31 L.P.R.A.\r\n\n  5141.  According  to CAPECO, it  was a compulsory  counterclaim\r\n\nand was thus  not barred by the one year  statute of limitations,\r\n\nat least to the extent of defeating the main claim.\r\n\n          We reject CAPECO's argument for two reasons.  First, in\r\n\nopposition  to Coastal's  motion  for  summary  judgment  on  the\r\n\ncounterclaim,  it failed  to  inform the  district  court of  the\r\n\ntheory  it  now  advances,  that  it is  entitled  to  recoupment\r\n\nnotwithstanding the  statute of  limitations.   Additionally, the\r\n\ngist of CAPECO's counterclaim argument  was that the threat posed\r\n\nby Coastal and CFMI allegedly working in concert forced CAPECO to\r\n\ngive Harbor  and  Caribbean discounts,  costing CAPECO  potential\r\n\nprofits.  Given that we  uphold the district court's finding that\r\n\nthese  discounts were illegal price discrimination, it appears at\r\n\nleast doubtful under Puerto Rico  law that CAPECO can collect for\r\n\nany lost profits thereby incurred.  See, e.g., Rubio-Sacarello v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nRoig,  84 D.P.R.  344, 351  (P.R. 1962)  (stating, in  a contract\r              \r\n\ncontext, that  one who  is guilty of  illegality cannot  bring an\r\n\naction).  As a result, we fail to find abuse of discretion by the\r\n\n                               -50-\r                                         -50-\r\r\n\ndistrict court  in its decision not to grant  a new trial on this\r\n\nbasis.\r\n\n                            CONCLUSION\r                                      CONCLUSION\r                                                \r\n\n          Coastal   succeeded  below   on  three   claims:  price\r\n\ndiscrimination, monopolization  and  tort.   CAPECO's failure  to\r\n\nmake the points below that it now argues on appeal hamstrung  its\r\n\nattempt to obtain  reversal of the price discrimination  and tort\r\n\nclaims.  But  the definition of relevant  market Coastal espoused\r\n\ncould  not  be  reasonably  adopted  by  the  jury,  since   this\r\n\ndefinition  was legally insufficient in neglecting to account for\r\n\ndownstream constraints on  the proposed monopoly, and  in failing\r\n\nto draw on  sufficient evidence regarding those constraints.\r\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district\r\n\ncourt is affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.\r                                                                   \r\n\n                               -51-\r                                         -51-\r\r\n",

See Kerr-Selgas v. American Airlines, Inc., 69 F.3d 1205, 1206 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Coastal Fuels of Puerto Rico, Inc.  (\"Coastal\") was formed in 1989 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Coastal Fuels Marketing, Inc.  (\"CFMI\"), a company that ran marine fuel operations in numerous ports using a staff of sales agents in Miami, Florida.   Caribbean Petroleum Corp.  (\"CAPECO\") owns and operates a refinery in Bayamon, Puerto Rico, which produces a number of fuel products, as well as residual fuel.   A principal use of residual fuel is in the production of \"bunker fuel,\" which is used by cruise ships and other ocean-going vessels outfitted with internal combustion or steam engines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, Coastal introduced testimony and letters showing that CAPECO had committed to supply Coastal on the same terms and conditions as other resellers in San Juan, Puerto Rico, in 1990, but Coastal deferred the start of its operations because of uncertainty due to the Gulf War.   Eventually, Coastal began business operations in Puerto Rico in October 1991, buying bunker fuel in San Juan and reselling it to ocean-going liners at berth in San Juan Harbor.   Based on CFMI's experience and reputation, Coastal produced a business plan which shows that it expected to reach a sales volume of 100,000 barrels a month, approximately 25-30% of the sales volume in San Juan Harbor.   The plan also shows that Coastal assumed it could obtain an average gross margin (sales revenues less product costs) of $1.65 a barrel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 1991, CAPECO agreed to charge Coastal prices based on a formula involving the previous Thursday/Friday New York market postings, minus discounts that varied by volume.   These prices were to cover the six month period from October 1991 to March 1992.   Unknown to Coastal, CAPECO was almost simultaneously offering Coastal's two competitors in San Juan Harbor, Caribbean Fuel Oil Trading, Inc.  (\"Caribbean\") and Harbor Fuel Services, Inc.  (\"Harbor\"), new contracts that gave Caribbean and Harbor bigger discounts from the formula price than Coastal received.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Trial evidence introduced by CAPECO's own expert witness quantified the total price discrimination in favor of Caribbean and Harbor as $682,451.78 for the period from October 1991 to April 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Coastal filed this suit in May of 1992 when it learned of CAPECO's price discrimination against it.   This court affirmed the district court's denial of a preliminary injunction requiring that CAPECO end its price discrimination.   See Coastal Fuels of Puerto Rico, Inc. v. Caribbean Petroleum Corp., 990 F.2d 25, 26 (1st Cir.1993).   After Coastal filed suit, CAPECO proposed a new price formula to Coastal.   According to trial testimony introduced by Coastal, CAPECO basically made a \"take it or leave it\" offer, which Coastal took.   Expert testimony Coastal offered at trial contended that competitively significant price discrimination continued until Spring of 1993, when CAPECO cut Coastal off entirely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, Coastal presented evidence that, while throughout this period CAPECO would from time to time inform Coastal that it had no fuel available, in fact, CAPECO had available fuel.   Coastal also presented evidence that it was discriminated against in terms of the quality of fuel that it received from CAPECO.   Finally, on March 31, 1993, CAPECO informed Coastal in writing that it would not sell any more product to Coastal, and shortly thereafter, Coastal went out of business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case was tried to a jury on claims (1) that CAPECO discriminated in price in violation of Section 2(a) of the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 730 (1914) (current version at 15 U.S.C. &#167; 13(a)), as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act, 49 Stat. 1526 (1936), and in violation of Section 263(a) of Title 10 of the Laws of Puerto Rico;  (2) that CAPECO monopolized trade or commerce in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act and Section 260 of Title 10 of the Laws of Puerto Rico;  (3) that CAPECO violated Section 5141 of Title 31 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code by engaging in tortious conduct that injured Coastal;  and (4) that CAPECO committed a breach of contract in violation of Sections 3371 et seq. of Title 31 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code.   As reflected in the jury's answers to the Special Interrogatories, the jury found for Coastal on the first three of these claims, but found for CAPECO on the breach of contract claim.   The jury awarded damages of $1,500,000 for the antitrust violations combined and $500,000 for the Puerto Rico tort violation.   The antitrust damages were trebled, see 15 U.S.C. &#167; 15(a), bringing the total award to $5,000,000.DISCUSSION</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CAPECO argues for a reversal of the district court's judgment, or alternatively, for a new trial.

With respect to these issues, we review the court's decision de novo, using the same stringent decisional standards that controlled the district court.   See Sullivan v. National Football League, 34 F.3d 1091, 1096 (1st Cir.1994);  Gallagher v. Wilton Enterprises, Inc., 962 F.2d 120, 125 (1st Cir.1992).   Under these standards, judgment for CAPECO can only be ordered if the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to Coastal, points so strongly and overwhelmingly in favor of CAPECO, that a reasonable jury could not have arrived at a verdict for Coastal.

A pair of sales at different prices makes out a prima facie case.   See Falls City Indus., Inc. v. Vanco Beverage, Inc., 460 U.S. 428, 444 n. 10, 103 S.Ct. 1282, 1293 n. 10, 75 L.Ed.2d 174 (1983);  FTC v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., 363 U.S. 536, 549, 80 S.Ct. 1267, 1274, 4 L.Ed.2d 1385 (1960) (\"[A] price discrimination within the meaning of [the statute] is merely a price difference.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 2(a) includes two offenses that differ substantially, but are covered by the same statutory language.   A \"primary-line\" violation occurs where the discriminating seller's price discrimination adversely impacts competition with the seller's direct competitors.   See, e.g., Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp., 509 U.S. 209, 219-21, 113 S.Ct. 2578, 2586, 125 L.Ed.2d 168, reh'g denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 13, 125 L.Ed.2d 765 (1993).   See generally Herbert Hovenkamp, Federal Antitrust Policy:  The Law of Competition and its Practice &#167; 8.8 (1994).   In contrast, a \"secondary-line\" violation occurs where the discriminating seller's price discrimination injures competition among his customers, that is, purchasers from the seller.   See, e.g., FTC v. Sun Oil Co., 371 U.S. 505, 519, 83 S.Ct. 358, 366, 9 L.Ed.2d 466 (1963);  Caribe BMW, Inc. v. Bayerische Motoren Werke, A.G., 19 F.3d 745, 748 (1st Cir.1994);  J.F. Feeser, Inc. v.

The theory of injury is generally that the defendant's lower price sales to the plaintiff's competitor (the favored purchaser) placed the plaintiff at a competitive disadvantage and caused it to lose business.   Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We address first CAPECO's contention that the district court erred in treating this case as one of secondary-line price discrimination rather than primary-line price discrimination.   Specifically, CAPECO protests the district court's instruction to the jury that injury to competition among competing purchaser-resellers may be inferred from proof of substantial price discrimination by a producer among competing purchaser-resellers, an inference appropriate to secondary-line discrimination.   See FTC v. Morton Salt Co., 334 U.S. 37, 50-51, 68 S.Ct. 822, 830, 92 L.Ed. 1196 (1948).   CAPECO argues that Coastal is affiliated with an organization that competes with CAPECO, and therefore this was a primary-line case;  as a result, the Morton Salt inference would not apply.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not consider the argument that this is a primary-line case, because CAPECO has chosen to make this argument for the first time on appeal.   While CAPECO did object to the Morton Salt instruction at the district court, that objection was directed at the use of the word \"infer\" couched in a generalized attack on the instruction as suggesting a presumption not borne out by case law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  We have noted before that \"Rule 51<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> means what it says:  the grounds for objection must be stated 'distinctly' after the charge to give the judge an opportunity to correct his [or her] error.\"  Linn v. Andover Newton Theological School, Inc., 874 F.2d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1989);  see also Jordan v. United States Lines, Inc., 738 F.2d 48, 51 (1st Cir.1984).   Leaving aside whether the district court in fact erred in making the questioned instruction, it seems clear that CAPECO did not set forth the argument it now advances when it objected to the instruction at issue.   And if CAPECO did intend to express this argument, it neither advised the district court judge of this problem in a manner that would allow him to make a correction, nor informed him what a satisfactory cure would be.  Linn, 874 F.2d at 5.   Because the argument was thus not preserved, we will reverse or award a new trial only if the error \"resulted in a miscarriage of justice or 'seriously affected the fairness, integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.' \"  Scarfo v. Cabletron Systems, Inc., 54 F.3d 931, 945 (1st Cir.1995) (quoting Lash v. Cutts, 943 F.2d 147, 152 (1st Cir.1991)).   We fail to find such concerns of judicial propriety implicated here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result, we analyze this case as one of secondary-line discrimination.   Thus, the theory of injury is that CAPECO sold bunker fuel to Coastal at an unfavorable price relative to Harbor and Caribbean, and consequently, competition between Coastal, Harbor and Caribbean was thereby injured.   On appeal, CAPECO makes three arguments based on what it purports to be required elements for Coastal's price discrimination damages claim:  first, that the sales in question were not \"in commerce\" and so section 2(a)'s prohibitions do not apply;  second, that Coastal failed to make the requisite showing of competitive injury to prevail;  and third, that Coastal failed to carry its burden of proving actual injury in order to be entitled to an award of money damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>1. \"In Commerce\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CAPECO argues, correctly we conclude, that section 2(a) of the Clayton Act does not apply because in the instant case, neither of the two transactions which evidence the alleged price discrimination crossed a state line.

For a transaction to qualify, the product at issue must physically cross a state boundary in either the sale to the favored buyer or the sale to the buyer allegedly discriminated against.

Southland Corp., 667 F.Supp. 757, 763 (D.Utah 1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, this issue is not dispositive, because the jury found that CAPECO violated the Puerto Rico price discrimination statute, which is identical to Section 2(a) except that it contains no interstate commerce requirement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  CAPECO has not challenged the district court's supplemental jurisdiction stemming from Coastal's Sherman Act claims.   The relevant statute states that \"in any civil action over which the district courts have original jurisdiction, the district courts shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action ... that they form part of the same case or controversy.\"  28 U.S.C. &#167; 1367 (1994).   In application, \"[i]f, considered without regard to their federal or state character, a plaintiff's claims are such that [it] would ordinarily be expected to try them all in one judicial proceeding, then, assuming substantiality of the federal issues, there is power in federal courts to hear the whole.\"  United Mine Workers of America v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 16 L.Ed.2d 218, (1966);  see Rodriguez v. Doral Mortgage Corp., 57 F.3d 1168, 1175-76 (1st Cir.1995) (interpreting and applying 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1367).   In the instant case, the price discrimination claims flow out of the same set of facts and require the same evidence as the Sherman Act claims.   Because we uphold the district court's jurisdiction over the Sherman Act claims, see 15 U.S.C. &#167; 4 (1994) (investing \"[t]he several district courts of the United States ... with jurisdiction to prevent and restrain violations of [Title 15] sections 1 to 7[,]\" which includes the Sherman Act), we also must conclude that the district court properly exercised supplementary jurisdiction over the price discrimination claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, we conclude that the district court erred in applying section 2(a) of the Clayton Act to the conduct at issue, and accordingly reverse that part of its opinion.   However, we find applicable section 263 of the Puerto Rico Anti-Monopoly Act, 10 L.P.R.A. &#167; 263.   Because section 263 was patterned after and is almost identical to section 2(a) of the Clayton Act, as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act, we look to the jurisprudence interpreting federal law as a guide in applying the statute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Given that the one key difference between the federal and Puerto Rico statutes is the lack of an \"in commerce\" requirement in the Puerto Rico analogue, we conclude that we should interpret section 263 as intended to extend the provisions of section 2(a) of the Clayton Act to price discrimination within Puerto Rico, the situation which we confront in the instant case.   Given the relative lack of applicable section 263 case law and the well-developed jurisprudence concerning Clayton Act section 2(a), we will focus on the latter in assessing the price discrimination claims.2. Injury to Competition</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CAPECO's second argument in support of reversing the price discrimination portion of the judgment is that Coastal failed to demonstrate injury to competition.   As noted above, we analyze this case as one of secondary-line price discrimination, and thus Coastal bears the burden of showing injury to competition between Coastal and its rival bunker fuel resellers, Harbor and Caribbean.   Addressing the burden of the secondary-line plaintiff, the Supreme Court has stated that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>[i]t would greatly handicap effective enforcement of the Act to require testimony to show that which we believe to be self-evident, namely, that there is a \"reasonable possibility\" that competition may be adversely affected by a practice under which manufacturers and producers sell their goods to some customers substantially cheaper than they sell like goods to the competitors of these customers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morton Salt Co., 334 U.S. at 50, 68 S.Ct. at 830.   As a result, the Supreme Court has held that \"for the purposes of section 2(a), injury to competition is established prima facie by proof of a substantial price discrimination between competing purchasers over time.\"  Falls City, 460 U.S. at 435, 103 S.Ct. at 1288 (citing Morton Salt, 334 U.S. at 46, 50-51, 68 S.Ct. at 828, 830);  see also Texaco, Inc. v. Hasbrouck, 496 U.S. 543, 559, 110 S.Ct. 2535, 2544, 110 L.Ed.2d 492 (1990);  Monahan's Marine, Inc. v. Boston Whaler, Inc., 866 F.2d 525, 528-529 (1st Cir.1989) (noting lower burden for antitrust plaintiff under Clayton Act, as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act, than under Sherman Act);  Boise Cascade Corp. v. FTC, 837 F.2d 1127, 1139 (D.C.Cir.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CAPECO challenges the district court's finding of competitive injury in two ways, arguing that the Morton Salt rule is no longer good law, or alternatively, that the Morton Salt rule was incorrectly applied in this case.   We first address CAPECO's direct challenge to the vitality of the Morton Salt rule, a challenge based on the Supreme Court's opinion in Brooke Group, 509 U.S. 209, 113 S.Ct. 2578.   In that case, the Supreme Court ruled that, because primary-line price discrimination injury is of the \"same general character\" as predatory pricing schemes actionable under Sherman Act section 2, Brooke Group, 509 U.S. at 221-23, 113 S.Ct. at 2587, a primary-line injury plaintiff bears the same substantive burden as under the Sherman Act, that is, the plaintiff must show that the predator stands some chance of recouping his losses, id. 509 U.S. at 223-24, 113 S.Ct. at 2588.   In so deciding, the Supreme Court implicitly overruled Utah Pie Co. v. Continental Baking Co., 386 U.S. 685, 87 S.Ct. 1326, 18 L.Ed.2d 406 (1967), in which the Supreme Court had set forth different standards for primary-line injury.  Brooke Group, 509 U.S. at 221-23, 113 S.Ct. at 2587 (explaining that Utah Pie was merely an \"early judicial inquiry\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to CAPECO, the Supreme Court's recent emphasis in Brooke Group on reconciling the area of price discrimination with other antitrust law requires that we find that the Morton Salt rule no longer is good law.   CAPECO notes that both primary-line and secondary-line price discrimination are prohibited by the same language of section 2(a) as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act.   Furthermore, CAPECO contends that the Supreme Court in Brooke Group apparently undercut any reliance on a principled distinction between the aims of section 2 of the Clayton Act and other antitrust laws' purported emphasis on protecting \"competition, not competitors,\" Brooke Group, 509 U.S. at 224, 113 S.Ct. at 2588 (emphasis in original) (citation omitted);  see also Monahan's Marine, Inc., 866 F.2d at 528-29 (not discussing the Morton Salt rule, but noting that \"unlike the Sherman Act, which protects 'competition not competitors,' ... the [Robinson-Patman] Act protects those who compete with a favored seller, not just the overall competitive process.\"  (emphasis in original)).   Thus, according to CAPECO, precedent that pre-dates Brooke Group and applies the Morton Salt rule must be reexamined.   See, e.g., 496 U.S. at 544, 110 S.Ct. at 2537;  Falls City, 460 U.S. at 436, 103 S.Ct. at 1289;  Boise Cascade v. FTC, 837 F.2d 1127, 1153 (D.C.Cir.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While CAPECO's argument has merit, we join the two other circuits that have addressed competitive injury in secondary-line cases since Brooke Group in refusing to disregard the rule the Supreme Court formulated in Morton Salt, for three reasons.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  First, the statutory structure that prohibits primary-line price discrimination \"stands on an entirely different footing\" than the statutory scheme that proscribes secondary-line discrimination.   See Rebel Oil Co., 51 F.3d at 1446.   Congress first forbade primary-line price discrimination with the Clayton Act of 1914, which originally condemned discrimination that might \"substantially ... lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce.\"   Clayton Antitrust Act, 38 Stat. 730 (1914) (codified as amended at 15 U.S.C. &#167; 13(a) (1994)).   The statute was intended to prevent large corporations from invading markets of small firms and charging predatory prices for the purpose of destroying marketwide competition, and thus specifically applied only to primary-line injury.   See H.R.Rep. No. 627, 63rd Cong., 2d Sess. &#167; 8 (1914);  E. Thomas Sullivan &amp; Jeffrey L. Harrison, Understanding Antitrust and Its Economic Implications &#167; 8.03 (1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By contrast, secondary-line discrimination is forbidden by the Robinson-Patman Act, 49 Stat. 1526 (1936), 15 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 13-13b, 21a (1988), which amended the original Clayton Act's price discrimination proscriptions.   Congress clearly intended the Robinson-Patman Act's provision to apply only to secondary-line cases, not to primary-line cases.   See H.R.Rep. No. 2287, 74th Cong., 2d Sess. &#167; 8 (1936),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> cited in Rebel Oil Co., 51 F.3d at 1446.   In contrast to the Sherman Act and the Clayton Act, which were intended to proscribe only conduct that threatens consumer welfare, the Robinson-Patman Act's framers \"intended to punish perceived economic evils not necessarily threatening to consumer welfare per se.\"  Rebel Oil Co., 51 F.3d at 1445.   See generally Hovenkamp &#167; 2.1a.   In particular, the Robinson-Patman Act's amendments to the Clayton Act stemmed from dissatisfaction with the original Clayton Act's inability to prevent large retail chains from obtaining volume discounts from big suppliers, at the disadvantage of small retailers who competed with the chains.   See S.Rep. No. 1502, 74th Cong., 2d Sess. &#167; 4 (1936);  H.R.Rep. No. 2287, 74th Cong., 2d Sess. &#167;&#167; 3-4 (1936);  see also Morton Salt, 334 U.S. at 49, 68 S.Ct. at 829 (\"Congress intended to protect a merchant from competitive injury attributable to discriminatory prices\");  Rebel Oil Co., 51 F.3d 1421, 1446;  Monahan's Marine, Inc., 866 F.2d at 528-29.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, we are persuaded by the reasoning of the Ninth Circuit's opinion in Rebel Oil Co. that the amendment to the Clayton Act effected by the Robinson-Patman Act supports the continued vitality of the Morton Salt rule, even in the face of Brooke Group's alteration of standards for primary-line price discrimination.   While the Clayton Act only proscribed conduct that may \"substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly[,]\" the new law added the following passage:  \"or to injure, destroy, or prevent competition with any person who either grants or knowingly receives the benefit of such discrimination, or with customers of either of them.\"   See Rebel Oil Co., 51 F.3d at 1447.   The purpose of this passage was to relieve secondary-line plaintiffs--small retailers who are disfavored by discriminating suppliers--from having to prove harm to competition marketwide, allowing them instead to impose liability simply by proving effects on individual competitors.   See id.;   H.R.Rep. No. 2287, 74th Cong., 2d Sess. &#167; 8 (1936).   Such legislative intent directly supports maintaining the Morton Salt rule, which puts into practice Congress' concern with placing the same burden on secondary-line plaintiffs that other antitrust plaintiffs face.   Thus, the comparison that the Supreme Court drew between primary-line price discrimination and predatory pricing in Brooke Group stands on a different, and stronger, footing than any comparison that could be made between secondary-line price discrimination and other area of antitrust law, including, but not only, predatory pricing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, and finally, the holding of the Brooke Group opinion on its face applies only to primary-line cases, not secondary-line cases.   As a result, given the legislative history and statutory language distinctions, we will not presume, without more guidance, that the Supreme Court intended in Brooke Group to alter the well-established rule that it adopted in Morton Salt.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  Thus, we hold that the Morton Salt rule continues to apply to secondary-line injury cases such as the present one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Morton Salt rule provides that, for the purposes of secondary-line claims under section 2(a), \"injury to competition is established prima facie by proof of a substantial price discrimination between competing purchasers over time.\"  Falls City Industries v. Vanco Beverage, Inc., 460 U.S. 428, 435, 103 S.Ct. 1282, 1288, 75 L.Ed.2d 174 (1983) (citing Morton Salt, 334 U.S. at 46, 50-51, 68 S.Ct. at 828, 830).   If the plaintiff makes such a showing, then \"[t]his inference may be overcome by evidence breaking the causal connection between a price differential and lost sales or profits.\"  Falls City, 460 U.S. at 435, 103 S.Ct. at 1288.   Barring evidence breaking that connection, however, \"for a[ ] plaintiff to prove competitive injury under Robinson-Patman, he [or she] need only show that a substantial price discrimination existed as between himself [or herself] and his [or her] competitors over a period of time.\"  Hasbrouck v. Texaco, Inc., 842 F.2d 1034, 1041 (9th Cir.1987), aff'd, 496 U.S. 543, 110 S.Ct. 2535, 110 L.Ed.2d 492 (1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here the jury properly inferred prima facie injury to competition since Coastal produced sufficient evidence before the jury to conclude (1) that the discrimination in question was continuous and substantial and (2) that the discrimination occurred in a business where profit margins were low and competition was keen.   4 Von Kalinowski, Antitrust Laws and Trade Regulation &#167; 31.04(1).   First, the discrimination lasted all 18 months that Coastal was in business, and always exceeded the five cents per barrel that witnesses testified was competitively significant.   Additionally, there was ample testimony that the marine fuel oil business, in which Coastal competed against Caribbean and Harbor, was characterized by thin margins and intense competition.   At any rate, on appeal, CAPECO does not make the argument that Coastal failed to produce evidence required for a prima facie showing of injury to competition under the Morton Salt rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, CAPECO argues that the Morton Salt inference was undercut by evidence \"breaking the causal connection\" between CAPECO's price discrimination and Coastal's lost sales or profits, Falls City, 460 U.S. at 435, 103 S.Ct. at 1288, and showing an absence of competitive injury, Boise Cascade Corp. v. FTC, 837 F.2d 1127, 1146 (D.C.Cir.1988).   According to CAPECO, overall market forces depressed the price for bunker fuel more than 30 percent between late 1991 and early 1992, and it was this fact, rather than CAPECO's price discrimination, that led to Coastal's demise.   CAPECO points to the admission of Coastal's CEO that Coastal's sales agents based their price quotes to ships on the prices being charged by competitors in San Juan and other ports, often without even knowing the cost of the fuel that was to be delivered.   According to CAPECO, if prices were set when costs were unknown, then discounts from CAPECO could not have been a material factor in setting prices.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject the argument that this evidence rebuts Coastal's prima facie showing of price discrimination.   In reviewing the jury verdict, \"[w]e are compelled ... even in a close case, to uphold the verdict unless the facts and inferences, when viewed in a light most favorable to the party for whom the jury held, point so strongly and overwhelmingly in favor of the movant that a reasonable jury could not have arrived at this conclusion.\"  Chedd-Angier Production Co. v. Omni Publications Int'l Ltd., 756 F.2d 930, 934 (1st Cir.1985);  see also Rodriguez v. Montalvo, 871 F.2d 163, 165 (1st Cir.1989);  Castro v. Stanley Works, 864 F.2d 961, 963 (1st Cir.1989);  Brown v. Freedman Baking Co., 810 F.2d 6, 12 (1st Cir.1987).   Thus, in this case, the appellants must \"persuade us that the facts of this case so conclusively point to a verdict in [their] favor that fair-minded people could not disagree about the outcome.\"  Chedd-Angier Production Co., 756 F.2d at 934.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, neither section 2(a), section 263, nor their attendant case law, requires that the price discrimination in question be directly factored into the prices that favored and disfavored purchaser-resellers offered to their customers.   Presumably, regardless of whether these costs were factored directly into the prices that Coastal offered, or were later calculated into Coastal's bottom line, these costs affected Coastal's pricing.   Certainly, no argument can be made from this evidence alone that bunker fuel costs, no matter when accounted for, were not causally connected to Coastal's lost profits.   See, e.g., Hasbrouck v. Texaco, Inc., 842 F.2d 1034, 1039-41 (9th Cir.1987), aff'd, 496 U.S. 543, 110 S.Ct. 2535, 110 L.Ed.2d 492 (1990) (finding that evidence that \"some portion\" of small extra discounts of 2cents - 5cents on gasoline was passed on by favored customers sufficient, particularly when retail gasoline market was \"strongly price sensitive\").   Additionally, the fact that Coastal's sales agents operated without complete knowledge of the prices at which other Coastal agents were purchasing the bunker fuel that would later be delivered does not, without more, show an absence of competitive injury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>3. Actual Injury</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CAPECO also contends that Coastal failed to present adequate evidence of actual injury to support the verdict.   On appeal, CAPECO does not complain that the court's instructions to the jury on the actual injury requirement were erroneous.   Thus, the only question regarding this issue is whether the evidence that Coastal presented to the jury was adequate to permit a reasonable inference of actual injury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we have concluded that Coastal has proved competitive injury under Title 10, Section 263 of the Laws of Puerto Rico, in order to collect damages as a private plaintiff, Coastal must show that CAPECO's offense was a \"material cause\" of injury.   See Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, 395 U.S. 100, 114 n. 9, 89 S.Ct. 1562, 1571 n. 9, 23 L.Ed.2d 129 (1969);  Hasbrouck, 842 F.2d at 1042;  Allen Pen Co. v. Springfield Photo Mount Co., 653 F.2d 17, 21-22 (1st Cir.1981).   Coastal was required to show that, as a result of CAPECO's price discrimination, it \"lost sales and profits.\"  Hasbrouck, 842 F.2d at 1042;  see Allen Pen Co., 653 F.2d 17, 21-22 (1st Cir.1981).   CAPECO contends that, to do so, Coastal was required to \"indicate and document specific losses of business [for Coastal] and corresponding gains by [favored competitors], or otherwise show that [Coastal's] losses were caused by [CAPECO's] practices.\"  Foremost-McKesson, Inc. v. Instrumentation Laboratory, Inc., 527 F.2d 417, 420 (5th Cir.1976);  see also Falls City, 460 U.S. at 437-38, 103 S.Ct. at 1290 (ruling that findings based on \"direct evidence of diverted sales\" \"more than established the competitive injury required for a prima facie case under section 2(a)\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming arguendo that CAPECO correctly claims that Coastal needed to show specific losses of business, CAPECO's argument fails to persuade us.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10-1\" id=\"fn10-1_ref\">10</a>  CAPECO concedes that a Coastal employee, Andrew McIntosh (\"McIntosh\") testified that Coastal was getting \"feedback\" from its customers that its prices were not competitive.   Whether or not to credit such testimony is a decision best left to the factfinder.   See Wytrwal v. Saco School Bd., 70 F.3d 165, 171 (1st Cir.1995);  Flanders &amp; Medeiros, Inc. v. Bogosian, 65 F.3d 198, 204 n. 4 (1st Cir.1995).   McIntosh's testimony, if believed, could lead a jury to reasonably infer actual injury in the form of lost sales.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CAPECO also contends that because McIntosh's testimony was based on statements other Coastal employees had made to him, it was both inadmissible hearsay evidence, see Fed.R.Evid. 802, and even if admissible, legally insufficient to support a finding of actual injury.   In making this argument, CAPECO cites two cases, Stelwagon Manufacturing Co. v. Tarmac Roofing Systems, Inc., 63 F.3d 1267, 1275-76 (3d Cir.1995), and Chrysler Credit Corp. v. J. Truett Payne Co., 670 F.2d 575, 581 (5th Cir.1982).   However, the two cases are inapposite.   Apparently unlike the defendant in Stelwagon, CAPECO did not make a lower court hearsay objection to the testimony in question.   See Stelwagon Mfg. Co., 63 F.3d at 1275, n. 17.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, the Fifth Circuit's opinion in J. Truett Payne is distinguishable in a significant manner from the instant case.   In a preceding Supreme Court opinion, the Court noted that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p>[a]lthough [Payne Co.'s owner] asserted that his salesmen and customers told him that the dealership was being undersold, he admitted that he did not know if his competitors did in fact pass on their lower costs to their customers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">J.

Likewise, Payne Co.'s expert witness did not testify that the lower costs were passed on in the retail price.  Id.  The Court found important the lack of evidence that competitors passed on discounts to customers.  Id. at 564, n. 4, 101 S.Ct. at 1928, n. 4.   On remand, the Fifth Circuit noted, in finding the evidence insufficient, that Payne Co.'s witnesses only \"spoke to either the supposed or hypothesized effect of the programs.\"  J. Truett Payne, 670 F.2d at 581.   By contrast, while Coastal offered similar testimony of feedback about being undersold, it also put forth expert testimony that Caribbean and Harbor had fully passed on their lower costs to the ships purchasing marine fuel.   Coastal's expert testified that \"CAPECO gave discriminatory low prices to Harbor and Caribbean ... [that] were fully passed on ... to the ships purchasing marine fuel.\"   Thus, because Coastal proffered evidence linking the discounts in question to actual, not hypothetical, effects, J. Truett Payne is inapposite.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that, once admitted, this evidence could have led the jury to reasonably infer actual injury to competition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.

Claims under this Puerto Rico analogue are to be analyzed in the same manner as claims under section 2 of the Sherman Act.   See R.W. Intern. Corp. v. Welch Food, Inc., 13 F.3d 478, 486-88 (1st Cir.1994);  Americana Indus., Inc. v. Wometco de Puerto Rico, 556 F.2d 625, 626-28 (1st Cir.1977);  see also Pressure Vessels of Puerto Rico v. Empire Gas of Puerto Rico, 94 JTS 144, (P.R.1994).   To successfully prove a monopolization offense, a plaintiff must show that (1) the defendant has monopoly power and (2) the defendant \"has engaged in impermissible 'exclusionary' practices with the design or effect of protecting or enhancing its monopoly position.\"   Hovenkamp &#167; 6.4a.   On appeal, CAPECO challenges the jury's verdict that it had monopoly power, and also contends that it did not engage in impermissible 'exclusionary' practices in order to protect or gain a monopoly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To determine whether a party has or could acquire monopoly power in a market, \"courts have found it necessary to consider the relevant market and the defendant's ability to lessen or destroy competition in that market.\"  Spectrum Sports v. McQuillan, 506 U.S. 447, 456, 113 S.Ct. 884, 890, 122 L.Ed.2d 247 (1993).   CAPECO's first argument is that the jury erred in finding San Juan Harbor as the relevant geographic market for bunker fuel.   In general, the relevant geographic market consists of \"the geographic area in which the defendant faces competition and to which consumers can practically turn for alternative sources of the product.\"  Baxley-DeLamar v. American Cemetery Assn., 938 F.2d 846, 850 (8th Cir.1991);  see also Tampa Electric Co. v. Nashville Coal Co., 365 U.S. 320, 327, 81 S.Ct. 623, 627, 5 L.Ed.2d 580 (1961).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its monopolization claim, Coastal argued that CAPECO took steps to drive it out of San Juan Harbor because Coastal is affiliated with a refinery in Aruba.   Coastal apparently had the capacity to import the residual oil and diesel into San Juan from Aruba.   Coastal also had storage capacity.   CAPECO feared, so Coastal's theory went, that this would allow the refinery in Aruba to compete with CAPECO and threaten CAPECO's ability to sell its targeted 10,000 barrels of residual oil per day to dealers.   Coastal's argument is that CAPECO, fearing that Coastal's affiliate posed a competitive threat, decided to drive Coastal out by (1) engaging in price discrimination against Coastal, (2) discriminating in the provision of residual oil, (3) discriminating in the quality of the residual oil available, and (4) threatening to cut off plaintiff entirely, eventually doing so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Coastal successfully argued to the jury that the relevant geographic market was San Juan Harbor, since neither it nor its competitors, Caribbean and Harbor, could practicably obtain supplies in San Juan Harbor from anyone other than CAPECO.   Coastal produced evidence that CAPECO made 90% of the sales of bunker fuel to resellers in the San Juan Harbor market--and CAPECO does not dispute this figure on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CAPECO's main argument regarding monopoly power is that the choice of San Juan Harbor as the relevant market was incorrect.   Instead, it maintains that because the broader market for bunker fuel among cruise ships and other vessels plying the waters of the Caribbean and the southeastern United States constrains the prices CAPECO can charge resellers in San Juan Harbor, the proper geographic market should have been defined to include a much wider area.   A larger geographic market would of course lead to a lower figure for the percentage of sales in the market made by CAPECO, likely defeating the monopoly power prong of the monopolization offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In assessing CAPECO's argument, we must bear in mind that \"market definition is a question of fact\" and \"we therefore must affirm the jury's conclusion unless the record is devoid of evidence upon which the jury might reasonably base its conclusion.\"  Weiss v. York Hospital, 745 F.2d 786, 825 (3d Cir.1984);  see also Rebel Oil Co., 51 F.3d at 1435 (stating that standard upon motion for directed verdict, judgment notwithstanding the verdict, and summary judgment is \"whether the jury, drawing all inferences in favor of the nonmoving party, could reasonably render a verdict in favor of the nonmoving party in light of the substantive law\") (citing Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 249-52, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2510-2512, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to show that CAPECO had monopoly power, Coastal was required to show that CAPECO had sufficient market power to raise price by restricting output.   IIA Phillip E. Areeda et al., Antitrust Law p 501 (1995).  \"[S]ubstantial market power that concerns antitrust law arises when the defendant (1) can profitably set prices well above its costs and (2) enjoys some protection against [a] rival's entry or expansion that would erode such supracompetitive prices and profits.\"   Id.  Market power can be shown through two types of proof.   A plaintiff can either show direct evidence of market power (perhaps by showing actual supracompetitive prices and restricted output) or circumstantial evidence of market power.  Rebel Oil Co., Inc. v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 51 F.3d 1421, 1434 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 515, 133 L.Ed.2d 424 (1995).   Market power may be proved circumstantially by showing that the defendant has a dominant share in a well-defined relevant market and that there are significant barriers to entry in that market and that existing competitors lack the capacity to increase their output in the short run.  Id.  Coastal's evidence at trial was of the circumstantial type and thus the question the parties have presented on appeal is whether Coastal supplied sufficient evidence for that CAPECO had a dominant share in the relevant market.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before determining market share, however, the relevant geographic market must be defined.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  Although, \"[f]inding the relevant market and its structure is not a goal in itself but a surrogate of market power,\" see Areeda, supra, p 531a, \"[m]arket definition is crucial.\"  Rebel Oil Co., 51 F.3d at 1434.  \"Without a definition of the relevant market, it is impossible to determine market share.\"  Id.  Proving market definition is the plaintiff's burden.   See H.J., Inc. v. Int'l Tel. &amp; Tel. Corp., 867 F.2d 1531 (8th Cir.1989) (\"The plaintiff carries the burden of describing a well-defined relevant market, both geographically and by product, which the defendants monopolized.\");  Neumann v. Reinforced Earth Co., 786 F.2d 424 (D.C.Cir.)  (\"The plaintiff bears the burden of establishing the relevant market.\"), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 851, 107 S.Ct. 181, 93 L.Ed.2d 116 (1986);  M.A.P.

Texaco, Inc., 691 F.2d 1303, 1306 (9th Cir.1982) (\"the proponent of [the monopolization] theory must identify the relevant product and geographic markets as a threshold requirement\").   Although Coastal has properly pointed out that the question of market definition is one of fact for the jury, a plaintiff must present sufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could find the existence of the proposed relevant market.   Cf. Flegel v. Christian Hosp. Northeast-Northwest, 4 F.3d 682 (8th Cir.1993) (affirming grant of summary judgment on grounds that there was insufficient evidence to support plaintiffs' proposed market definition).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A market may be any grouping of sales whose sellers, if unified by a hypothetical cartel or merger, could profitably raise prices significantly above the competitive level.   If the sales of other producers substantially constrain the price-increasing ability of the hypothetical cartel, these others are part of the market.   Areeda, supra, p 533b;  see also Rebel Oil Co., 51 F.3d at 1434 (relying on Professor Areeda's formulation of the test for the relevant market).  \"The definition of relevant market depends upon economic restraints which prevent sellers from raising prices above competitive levels.\"  H.J., Inc., 867 F.2d at 1537.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Coastal and CAPECO have presented two competing conceptions of the relevant market.   Coastal argues, and the jury found,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> that the relevant market was the market for residual oil for bunker fuel in San Juan.   Coastal presented evidence that resellers in San Juan (Harbor, Caribbean and Coastal) purchased 90% of their supplies for bunker fuel from CAPECO.   CAPECO, in contrast, has argued that the relevant market is broader, consisting of all sales of residual oil for bunker fuel in the Caribbean and Southeastern United States.   Our review of the issue leads us to conclude that it would be unreasonable for a juror to infer from the evidence presented that the sales of residual oil for bunker fuel outside of San Juan should be excluded from the relevant market.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The residual oil CAPECO sells is blended with diesel into bunker fuel and sold by resellers like Coastal, Harbor and Caribbean to large ocean-going vessels.   Residual oil refiners and bunker fuel resellers exist throughout the Caribbean and Southeastern United States.   The parties agree that the ocean-going vessels can choose to refuel from whatever supplier in the Caribbean and Southeastern United States offers the best terms as to price, quality and dependability.   The market for bunker fuel is therefore extremely fluid and competitive, as the parties agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Coastal argues that, because of this competition, margins for resellers are razor thin and it is virtually impossible for a reseller in San Juan, like Coastal, to obtain residual oil from anyone other than CAPECO.   Transporting supplies from other refineries, such as the refinery Coastal is affiliated with in Aruba, would increase the cost of the fuel to such an extent (transportation costs, import taxes, risk of price changes, and storage costs) that it is not an economically viable alternative.  (Of course, this is, it might be observed, somewhat inconsistent with the theory that CAPECO was so afraid of the 'threat' from Coastal and its Aruba affiliate, that it drove Coastal out of business.)   Consequently, Coastal argues, resellers of bunker fuel must purchase from CAPECO when they do business in San Juan.   In Coastal's view, the San Juan resellers' inability to purchase from suppliers outside of San Juan makes San Juan the relevant market.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not agree.   The touchstone of market definition is whether a hypothetical monopolist could raise prices.   See Rebel Oil Co., 51 F.3d at 1434.   Although a reseller based in San Juan may have nowhere else to turn to in San Juan for its fuel, Coastal did not produce sufficient evidence that this meant CAPECO has the ability to restrict supply and raise prices in San Juan to supracompetitive levels.   Indeed, the evidence points in the other direction.   CAPECO cannot sell its residual oil for bunker fuel unless it does so at a price at which the resellers will be able to sell the fuel to its ultimate consumers, the ocean-going vessels.   Those ocean-going vessels can go anywhere in the Caribbean and Southeastern United States to get their bunker fuel.   If CAPECO were to raise its prices to the resellers, the resellers could not offer the bunker fuel to the ocean-going vessels at competitive prices and the ocean-going vessels would simply get their fuel at another port.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given these facts, the immobility of the resellers does not mean that CAPECO could maximize profits by raising prices significantly above the competitive level.   Raising prices in San Juan would repel the ultimate consumers, who would seek other suppliers.   The resellers would either stop purchasing residual fuel or cease business, or both.   CAPECO would then lose its ability to sell its residual oil for bunker fuel and this would redound to the benefit of CAPECO's competitors.   While under most circumstances the immobility of the resellers would be of considerable importance in defining the market, it does not control here where the mobility of the ultimate consumers protects the immobile resellers.   Cf. Ball Memorial Hosp., Inc. v. Mutual Hosp. Ins., Inc., 784 F.2d 1325 (7th Cir.1986) (Easterbrook, J.)  (relevant market for purposes of health insurance coverage to Indiana consumers was \"regional or national\" not simply Indiana, even though Indiana consumers could not get insurance from any source other than defendant doing business in Indiana;  the mobility of potential rivals to the defendant protected the consumers whose mobility was restricted).   Under the circumstances here, defining the market as San Juan is too narrow.   It does not capture the likelihood of expanded sales by CAPECO's rivals in the event that CAPECO were to raise prices in San Juan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once the relevant market is defined to include a geographic region larger than San Juan (i.e., the Caribbean and Southeastern United States), Coastal has not satisfied its burden of showing that CAPECO had a dominant market share.   While Coastal might, at least in theory, have shown that all refineries throughout the Caribbean and the Southeastern United States behaved like a cartel and priced their residual oil to capture the transportation and other costs of getting oil from sources outside the local ports, it has not done so here and it has failed to produce evidence sufficient for a reasonable jury to infer that such was the case.   In short, Coastal has not shown that CAPECO had monopoly power over the relevant market.   Cf. Zoslaw v. MCA Distrib.  Corp., 693 F.2d 870, 886-87 (9th Cir.1982) (secondary-line price discrimination under Robinson-Patman Act does not necessarily violate Sherman Act), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1085, 103 S.Ct. 1777, 76 L.Ed.2d 349 (1983).   Accordingly, Coastal's monopolization claims fail under both section 2 of the Sherman Act and Title 10, Section 260 of the Laws of Puerto Rico and we reverse the monopolization verdicts.   We note that because we affirm the price discrimination verdict, the reversal on the monopolization theory, by itself, leaves unchanged the amount of antitrust damages awarded, subject to our discussion on damage evidentiary sufficiency in Part I.D., infra.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Puerto Rico Law Tort</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CAPECO also challenges the judgment on Coastal's claim under 31 L.P.R.A. 5141 (\"Article 1802\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  CAPECO claims that Coastal was required to allege and prove the elements of a recognized tort, and failed to do so.   According to CAPECO, because the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has recently declined to rule that violation of an antitrust statute will also necessarily give rise to a violation of Article 1802, the violation of an antitrust statute does not give rise to a per se violation of Article 1802.   See Pressure Vessels of Puerto Rico, 94 JTS 144, *438-39    Additionally, CAPECO challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the judgment on this issue.   CAPECO asks for a reversal of the verdict on these grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CAPECO's arguments may well have merit.   However, we need express no opinion regarding CAPECO's arguments as CAPECO waived them by failing to object to the jury instructions regarding the Article 1802 claim.   See Linn v. Andover Newton Theological School, Inc., 874 F.2d 1, 5.   These are not simply technical requirements.   By failing to object to the jury instructions, CAPECO denied \"the judge an opportunity to correct his error,\" assuming that CAPECO rightly contends that an error was made.  Id.  While CAPECO may correctly contend that antitrust violations do not fall within the scope of Article 1802, the district court's jury instructions were not strictly limited to antitrust offenses.   It is entirely possible that, had an objection been made, the district court could have charged the jury with antitrust offenses as an Article 1802 ground separately from other Article 1802 grounds that may have applied in the present case.   For example, it could have charged the jury with tortious interference with contractual relations, since CAPECO may well have intentionally complicated, via its refusal to deal, Coastal's efforts to meet its obligations to deliver bunker fuel.   See General Office Products Corp. v. A.M. Capen's Sons, Inc., 780 F.2d 1077, 1081 (1st Cir.1986) (noting that even in the absence of a contract, liability may be incurred under other judicial principles) (citing General Office Products Corp. v. A.M. Capen's Sons, Inc., No. 0-84-278, Trans.Op. at 6-7 (P.R. June 29, 1984)).   By failing to object to the instructions in question, CAPECO has deprived us of factual findings that would aid in the resolution of these issues.   Because of the generality of the instruction, we conclude that evidence existed of CAPECO's possibly tortious conduct sufficient for the jury to reasonably reach the verdict that it did.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CAPECO also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the Article 1802 findings.   However, CAPECO has waived review here of this argument too by failing to move at any time for a judgment as a matter of law on this ground under Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a), see Wells Real Estate, Inc. v. Greater Lowell Board of Realtors, 850 F.2d 803, 810 (1st Cir.1988) (\"[a]ppellate review may be obtained only on the specific ground stated in the motion for directed verdict\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result of CAPECO's failure to preserve its arguments for review on appeal, we affirm the judgment on the Article 1802 claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D. Sufficient Evidence on Damages</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CAPECO also argues that Coastal's evidence on damages was inadequate as a matter of law, and therefore, the jury's verdict on damages must be reversed.   In particular, CAPECO argues that, as a new market entrant, Coastal was required to use the \"yardstick\" method of estimating damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the issue of how accurately damages must be measured, \"there is a clear distinction between the [relatively high] measure of proof necessary to establish that [a plaintiff] has sustained some damage and the [relatively low] measure of proof necessary to enable the jury to fix the amount.\"  Story Parchment Co. v. Paterson Parchment Paper Co., 282 U.S. 555, 562, 51 S.Ct. 248, 250, 75 L.Ed. 544 (1931).   In the antitrust context, \"the most elementary conceptions of justice and public policy require that the wrongdoer shall bear the risk of the uncertainty which his own wrong has created.\"  Bigelow v. RKO Radio Pictures, 327 U.S. 251, 256, 66 S.Ct. 574, 576, 90 L.Ed. 652 (1946).   Nonetheless, the plaintiff must still produce evidence from which the jury can make a just and reasonable inference.  Wells Real Estate, Inc. v. Greater Lowell Board of Realtors, 850 F.2d 803, 816 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 955, 109 S.Ct. 392, 102 L.Ed.2d 381 (1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Citing Home Placement Service v. The Providence Journal Co., 819 F.2d 1199 (1st Cir.1987), CAPECO argues that Coastal was required to use the yardstick method for calculating lost profits, rather than the \"before-and-after\" method.  Id. at 1205-06.   Under the yardstick approach, the plaintiff attempts to identify a firm similar to the plaintiff in all respects but for the impact of the antitrust violation.   Hovenkamp &#167; 17.6b2.   By contrast, under the \"before-and-after\" method, the court looks at the plaintiff's business before the violation occurred, during the violation period, and after the violation ended, and estimates the amount by which the violation reduced the plaintiff's profits.   Id. &#167; 17.6b1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that whether a yardstick record must be used ultimately requires an appraisal of the reliability of a firm's track record, and the length of that track record is one factor to consider.   The plaintiff in Home Placement Service had operated as planned only weeks before the alleged violations began.  Home Placement Service can best be read as demonstrating both the type of situation in which a yardstick method is preferable, and the factors that should go into a court's evaluation of the comparability of the yardstick firm or firms with the plaintiff.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ultimately, the proper method should be determined by the district court in accord with the facts of the situation.   In this case, the district court will have exactly that opportunity, since we must vacate the district court's damages award and remand for further proceedings.   The district court charged the jury with an instruction to find an amount for \"antitrust damages,\" comprising awards for both price discrimination and monopolization claims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a>  Because we reverse the monopolization verdict, if left to stand, the jury's antitrust damages award would likely constitute an excessive recovery.   In coming to its conclusion, the jury may well have weighed harms resulting from conduct that was pleaded with respect to the monopolization offense (e.g. refusal to deal with a customer, lying, etc.) but would have been additional to harms resulting from price discrimination, the claim we uphold.   Furthermore, were we to allow the verdict to stand despite our reversal of the monopolization verdict, there would exist the strong likelihood that the jury had granted Coastal a duplicative recovery under monopolization and tort law, for injury caused by the same conduct, such as refusal to deal and lying.   The law \"abhors duplicative recoveries.\"  Dopp v. HTP Corp., 947 F.2d 506, 517 (1st Cir.1991) (vacating damage award for, among other reasons, \"a strong likelihood that the remedies thus far conferred overlap\").   Thus, we find that the district court's award rests on an error of law.   See Adams v. Zimmerman, 73 F.3d 1164, 1171, (1st Cir.1996) (stating that a \"district court's award is reviewed for an abuse of discretion unless it relies on an erroneous legal determination\").   As a result, we must vacate the antitrust damage award of $4.5 million ($1.5 million trebled), and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Arguments for a New Trial</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to its arguments for reversal of the district court's findings, CAPECO makes several arguments for reversal of the district court's denial of its motion for a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The authority to grant a new trial ... is confided almost entirely to the exercise of discretion on the part of the trial court.\"  Allied Chem.  Corp. v. Daiflon, Inc., 449 U.S. 33, 36, 101 S.Ct. 188, 190, 66 L.Ed.2d 193 (1980), cited in Wells Real Estate, Inc. v. Greater Lowell Bd. of Realtors, 850 F.2d 803, 810 (1st Cir.1988).  \"Only abuse of discretion will trigger reversal of a denial of a motion for new trial.\"  Velazquez v. Figueroa- Gomez, 996 F.2d 425, 427 (1993).   In reviewing for abuse of discretion, we must bear in mind that the trial court's discretion is quite limited concerning motions for new trials.  \"A trial judge may not upset the jury's verdict merely because he or she would have decided the case differently.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Duplicative Judgment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of its request for a new trial, CAPECO argues that the damages awards constituted an impermissible double recovery.   CAPECO contends that both Coastal's antitrust and tort claims were grounded in the same set of acts.   Because we vacate and remand the antitrust damages for further findings on price discrimination damages, we construe CAPECO's argument that price discrimination and tort damages would constitute duplicative damage recoveries, see Borden v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co., 935 F.2d 370, 382 (1st Cir.1991) (\"recovery against a defendant under one tort theory precludes any duplicative recovery for the same damages under some other tort theory\"), and so a new trial or remittitur is required, see Dopp v. HTP Corp., 947 F.2d 506, 516 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject this argument for three reasons.   First, CAPECO failed to object to the form or content of the special interrogatories to which the jury answered.   Second, CAPECO may well have waived its right to raise this issue here, since it failed to raise the issue in a timely manner with the trial court.   Previously, we have held that a defendant may not argue verdict inconsistency if he or she failed to object \"after the verdict was read and before the jury was discharged.\"   See McIsaac v. Didriksen Fishing Corp., 809 F.2d 129, 134 (1st Cir.1987).   This rule is grounded in the realization that \"to decide otherwise would countenance 'agreeable acquiescence to perceivable error as a weapon of appellate advocacy.' \"  Id. (quoting Merchant v. Ruhle, 740 F.2d 86, 92 (1st Cir.1984)).   The same concern should make us hesitate to consider arguments about verdict redundancy that were similarly not put forth below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, \"[a] special verdict will be upheld if there is a view of the case which makes the jury's answers consistent.\"  McIsaac, 809 F.2d at 133.   As we have noted above, Coastal may have had a legitimate Article 1802 claim apart from any overlap with antitrust law.   Had CAPECO chosen to object to the district court's instructions, the district court may have corrected this problem.   Accordingly, giving the district court the benefit of the doubt, had it responded to a timely objection by CAPECO and given an Article 1802 instruction that did not overlap with antitrust claims, the jury's damages verdicts on tort and antitrust claims could have been consistent.   Even assuming, arguendo, that CAPECO correctly asserts that such overlap occurred, to grant CAPECO a new trial now on the basis of duplicative recovery would allow it to avoid the result of its own failure to object to the Article 1802 instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. CAPECO's Experts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, CAPECO argues that the district court's refusal to allow its two experts, Dr. Jorge Freyre (\"Dr. Freyre\") and Dr. Elias Gutierrez (\"Dr. Gutierrez\"), to testify was based on a fundamental error of law and was an abuse of discretion that requires that we reverse the district court and order a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to evaluate CAPECO's contentions, we must review the district court's orders leading up to the exclusion of the relevant testimony.   The district court's June 22, 1993 Scheduling Order stated that \"[t]he parties will announce the names and qualifications of their experts by October 1, 1993.\"   This date was modified subsequently to December 1, 1993.   In compliance with this order, CAPECO named Cesar Figueroa (\"Figueroa\") and Rafael Martinez-Margarida (\"Martinez-Margarida\").   On March 1, 1994, pursuant to a motion by new counsel for Caribbean, the district court modified the previous order and issued a revised scheduling order stating \"all experts are to be announced by March 30,\" and also specifying that expert reports to be used \"during each party's case-in-chief\" were to be exchanged on June 3, 1994, and that expert rebuttal reports were to be exchanged on July 1, 1994.   Upon CAPECO's June 1 motion, the date for reports to be exchanged was extended by an \"Omnibus Order\" to ten days after service of that order, dated August 15, 1994.   On August 29, 1994, Coastal delivered to CAPECO expert reports prepared by Dr. Sherwin and Dr. Zalacain, and CAPECO provided Coastal with an expert report prepared by Figueroa.   These experts were deposed between September 9 and September 14, and thereafter CAPECO retained experts Dr. Freyre and Dr. Gutierrez ostensibly as rebuttal witnesses under Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(2)(C).   CAPECO informed Coastal on September 20, 1994, that it had retained Dr. Freyre as a rebuttal witness, and similarly informed Coastal of Dr. Gutierrez on or about October 4, 1994.   CAPECO informed the district court about Dr. Freyre and Dr. Gutierrez on October 5, 1995.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court instructed CAPECO to produce Dr. Freyre and Dr. Gutierrez and to make them available for depositions.   On October 5 and October 6, Coastal filed motions in limine to exclude Dr. Freyre and Dr. Gutierrez, respectively, on the theory that neither witness could properly be characterized as a \"rebuttal\" witness within the meaning of Rule 26(a)(2)(C), and thus both should have been disclosed previously.   After oral argument, the district court granted Coastal's motion and excluded the testimony of Dr. Freyre and Dr. Gutierrez.   The district court, upon CAPECO's admission that it planned to use Dr. Freyre and Dr. Gutierrez in its case-in-chief, noted that \"you got a problem with my orders because you have not complied with my orders insofar as Freyre and Gutierrez [are] concerned,\" apparently referring to the previous scheduling order deadline for experts in the case-in-chief to be disclosed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CAPECO argues (1) that because the Omnibus Order did not provide a deadline for the exchange of rebuttal expert reports, no scheduling order applied, and therefore the disclosure of Dr. Freyre and Dr. Gutierrez was controlled by Rule 26(a)(2)(C);<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a>  and (2) that the district court misconstrued Rule 26(a)(2)(C) to signify that a defendant cannot offer testimony to \"contradict or rebut\" under Rule 26(a)(2)(C).   We need not consider whether the district court in fact misconstrued Rule 26(a)(2)(C), because, for three reasons, we find no abuse of discretion in its exclusion of these witnesses as rebuttal witnesses.   First, at no time did CAPECO ever seek leave of the court to announce the names of experts not disclosed by December 1, 1993, as originally required, or by March 30, 1994, as permitted by the trial court.   CAPECO's motion of June 1 sought extension principally due to alleged noncooperation by Coastal in discovery, making CAPECO's experts' task difficult to complete by the deadline then in effect.   We cannot conclude, as CAPECO does, that the Omnibus Order's extension rendered all other orders unbinding.   Because CAPECO did not ask for its extension on the grounds it now argues, the district court could not have had such an effect in mind, nor was it given an opportunity to consider such effect.   A trial court may \"readily exclude a witness or exhibit if some previous order had set a deadline for identification and the proponent [has], without adequate excuse, failed to list the witness or exhibit.\"  Fusco v. General Motors Corp., 11 F.3d 259, 265 (1st Cir.1993);  see also Freund v. Fleetwood Enter., Inc., 956 F.2d 354 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, we cannot agree that the district court's March 1, 1994, Scheduling Order was necessarily superceded, given that that order scheduled trial for October 24, 1994, and in fact, trial began on that date.   The proximity in time between CAPECO's attempts to bring in Dr. Freyre and Dr. Gutierrez and actual trial casts doubt on any argument that CAPECO was somehow misled into thinking that previous Scheduling Orders did not apply.   Finally, even assuming that CAPECO is correct that the Scheduling Order's provisions regarding rebuttal witnesses had been superceded and thus Rule 26(a)(2)(B) applied, the district court might still have enforced its previous deadlines regarding experts in the case-in-chief.   For better or for worse, at oral argument on October 21, 1994 (three days before trial was to start), counsel for CAPECO identified Dr. Freyre and Dr. Gutierrez as witnesses in its case-in-chief.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the circumstances, we cannot conclude that the exclusion of the testimony of Dr. Freyre and Dr. Gutierrez was an abuse of discretion warranting a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. CAPECO's Meeting Competition Defense</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CAPECO also argues that the district court should have given jury instructions on the affirmative defense of meeting competition.   Section 2(b) of Clayton Act, as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act, permits a defendant to rebut a prima facie case of violation by showing that its lower price \"was made in good faith to meet an equally low price of a competitor.\"  15 U.S.C. &#167; 13(b).   The \"meeting competition\" defense can be raised only by a defendant who responds in good faith to the believed lower price of a competitor.  United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 438 U.S. 422, 98 S.Ct. 2864, 57 L.Ed.2d 854 (1978), appeal after remand, 600 F.2d 414 (3d Cir.1979), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 884, 100 S.Ct. 175, 62 L.Ed.2d 114 (1979).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not consider CAPECO's argument that it believed in good faith that it was responding to a competitive threat posed by Coastal in combination with its parent CFMI, because we conclude that even assuming that Coastal and CFMI were a single entity, they do not constitute a competitor in the same specific area as CAPECO, see Falls City, 460 U.S. at 448, 103 S.Ct. at 1295.   In Falls City, the Supreme Court concluded that Congress intended the meeting competition defense \"to allow reasonable pricing responses on an area-specific basis where competitive circumstances warrant them.\"  Id. at 448, 103 S.Ct. at 1295.   Here, the district court could reasonably conclude that the defense did not apply, since there was a lack of evidence, beyond CAPECO's own employees' testimony about what they believed to be the case, that CFMI offered lower prices on bunker fuel in San Juan than CAPECO.   See Rose Confections, Inc. v. Ambrosia Chocolate Co., 816 F.2d 381, 391-93 (8th Cir.1987) (ruling defense rejected where seller relied on \"assumption or speculation\" without verification that competitor's prices were in fact lower).   Therefore, we do not find abuse of discretion in the district court's denial of a new trial based on its refusal to issue a jury instruction on the meeting competition defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p>D. CAPECO's Puerto Rico Law Tort Counterclaim</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CAPECO contends that the district court erred in dismissing its counterclaim grounded in Article 1802, 31 L.P.R.A. &#167; 5141.   According to CAPECO, it was a compulsory counterclaim and was thus not barred by the one year statute of limitations, at least to the extent of defeating the main claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject CAPECO's argument for two reasons.   First, in opposition to Coastal's motion for summary judgment on the counterclaim, it failed to inform the district court of the theory it now advances, that it is entitled to recoupment notwithstanding the statute of limitations.   Additionally, the gist of CAPECO's counterclaim argument was that the threat posed by Coastal and CFMI allegedly working in concert forced CAPECO to give Harbor and Caribbean discounts, costing CAPECO potential profits.   Given that we uphold the district court's finding that these discounts were illegal price discrimination, it appears at least doubtful under Puerto Rico law that CAPECO can collect for any lost profits thereby incurred.   See, e.g., Rubio-Sacarello v. Roig, 84 D.P.R. 344, 351 (P.R.1962) (stating, in a contract context, that one who is guilty of illegality cannot bring an action).   As a result, we fail to find abuse of discretion by the district court in its decision not to grant a new trial on this basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Coastal succeeded below on three claims:  price discrimination, monopolization and tort.   CAPECO's failure to make the points below that it now argues on appeal hamstrung its attempt to obtain reversal of the price discrimination and tort claims.   But the definition of relevant market Coastal espoused could not be reasonably adopted by the jury, since this definition was legally insufficient in neglecting to account for downstream constraints on the proposed monopoly, and in failing to draw on sufficient evidence regarding those constraints.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the United States Court of International Trade</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> CAPECO tried to argue below and again argues here, that the contracts it executed with Caribbean and Harbor were qualitatively different in their non-price terms and conditions from CAPECO's arrangement with Coastal, justifying the discounts.   Coastal responds that it was never offered the terms and conditions that Caribbean and Harbor received.   In light of the jury's verdict for Coastal on the price discrimination claim, from conflicting evidence such as this, we draw the (reasonable) conclusion in Coastal's favor</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> We address this distinct argument below</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Fed.R.Civ.P. 51 states, in pertinent part, that</p>\n        <p>[n]o party shall assign as error the giving or the failure to give an instruction unless that party objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds of the objection.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> While this court has admitted \"occasional\" exceptions to the \"raise-or-waive\" principle, see National Assoc. of Social Workers v.

(\"Coastal\") was formed in 1989 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Coastal Fuels Marketing, Inc.  (\"CFMI\"), a company that ran marine fuel operations in numerous ports using a staff of sales agents in Miami, Florida.   Caribbean Petroleum Corp.  (\"CAPECO\") owns and operates a refinery in Bayamon, Puerto Rico, which produces a number of fuel products, as well as residual fuel.   A principal use of residual fuel is in the production of \"bunker fuel,\" which is used by cruise ships and other ocean-going vessels outfitted with internal combustion or steam engines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, Coastal introduced testimony and letters showing that CAPECO had committed to supply Coastal on the same terms and conditions as other resellers in San Juan, Puerto Rico, in 1990, but Coastal deferred the start of its operations because of uncertainty due to the Gulf War.   Eventually, Coastal began business operations in Puerto Rico in October 1991, buying bunker fuel in San Juan and reselling it to ocean-going liners at berth in San Juan Harbor.   Based on CFMI's experience and reputation, Coastal produced a business plan which shows that it expected to reach a sales volume of 100,000 barrels a month, approximately 25-30% of the sales volume in San Juan Harbor.   The plan also shows that Coastal assumed it could obtain an average gross margin (sales revenues less product costs) of $1.65 a barrel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 1991, CAPECO agreed to charge Coastal prices based on a formula involving the previous Thursday/Friday New York market postings, minus discounts that varied by volume.   These prices were to cover the six month period from October 1991 to March 1992.   Unknown to Coastal, CAPECO was almost simultaneously offering Coastal's two competitors in San Juan Harbor, Caribbean Fuel Oil Trading, Inc.  (\"Caribbean\") and Harbor Fuel Services, Inc.  (\"Harbor\"), new contracts that gave Caribbean and Harbor bigger discounts from the formula price than Coastal received.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Trial evidence introduced by CAPECO's own expert witness quantified the total price discrimination in favor of Caribbean and Harbor as $682,451.78 for the period from October 1991 to April 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Coastal filed this suit in May of 1992 when it learned of CAPECO's price discrimination against it.   This court affirmed the district court's denial of a preliminary injunction requiring that CAPECO end its price discrimination.   See Coastal Fuels of Puerto Rico, Inc. v. Caribbean Petroleum Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"603798\"><a href=\"/opinion/603798/coastal-fuels-of-puerto-rico-inc-v-caribbean-petroleum-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">990</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span>, 26 (1st Cir.1993).   After Coastal filed suit, CAPECO proposed a new price formula to Coastal.   According to trial testimony introduced by Coastal, CAPECO basically made a \"take it or leave it\" offer, which Coastal took.   Expert testimony Coastal offered at trial contended that competitively significant price discrimination continued until Spring of 1993, when CAPECO cut Coastal off entirely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, Coastal presented evidence that, while throughout this period CAPECO would from time to time inform Coastal that it had no fuel available, in fact, CAPECO had available fuel.   Coastal also presented evidence that it was discriminated against in terms of the quality of fuel that it received from CAPECO.   Finally, on March 31, 1993, CAPECO informed Coastal in writing that it would not sell any more product to Coastal, and shortly thereafter, Coastal went out of business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case was tried to a jury on claims (1) that CAPECO discriminated in price in violation of Section 2(a) of the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 730 (1914) (current version at 15 U.S.C. &#167; 13(a)), as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act, 49 Stat. 1526 (1936), and in violation of Section 263(a) of Title 10 of the Laws of Puerto Rico;  (2) that CAPECO monopolized trade or commerce in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act and Section 260 of Title 10 of the Laws of Puerto Rico;  (3) that CAPECO violated Section 5141 of Title 31 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code by engaging in tortious conduct that injured Coastal;  and (4) that CAPECO committed a breach of contract in violation of Sections 3371 et seq. of Title 31 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code.   As reflected in the jury's answers to the Special Interrogatories, the jury found for Coastal on the first three of these claims, but found for CAPECO on the breach of contract claim.   The jury awarded damages of $1,500,000 for the antitrust violations combined and $500,000 for the Puerto Rico tort violation.   The antitrust damages were trebled, see 15 U.S.C. &#167; 15(a), bringing the total award to $5,000,000.DISCUSSION</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CAPECO argues for a reversal of the district court's judgment, or alternatively, for a new trial.

Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We address first CAPECO's contention that the district court erred in treating this case as one of secondary-line price discrimination rather than primary-line price discrimination.   Specifically, CAPECO protests the district court's instruction to the jury that injury to competition among competing purchaser-resellers may be inferred from proof of substantial price discrimination by a producer among competing purchaser-resellers, an inference appropriate to secondary-line discrimination.   See FTC v. Morton Salt Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104547\"><a href=\"/opinion/104547/ftc-v-morton-salt-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">334</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span>, 50-51, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104547\"><a href=\"/opinion/104547/ftc-v-morton-salt-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">68</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

CAPECO argues that Coastal is affiliated with an organization that competes with CAPECO, and therefore this was a primary-line case;  as a result, the Morton Salt inference would not apply.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not consider the argument that this is a primary-line case, because CAPECO has chosen to make this argument for the first time on appeal.   While CAPECO did object to the Morton Salt instruction at the district court, that objection was directed at the use of the word \"infer\" couched in a generalized attack on the instruction as suggesting a presumption not borne out by case law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  We have noted before that \"Rule 51<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> means what it says:  the grounds for objection must be stated 'distinctly' after the charge to give the judge an opportunity to correct his [or her] error.\"  Linn v.

Leaving aside whether the district court in fact erred in making the questioned instruction, it seems clear that CAPECO did not set forth the argument it now advances when it objected to the instruction at issue.   And if CAPECO did intend to express this argument, it neither advised the district court judge of this problem in a manner that would allow him to make a correction, nor informed him what a satisfactory cure would be.

Thus, the theory of injury is that CAPECO sold bunker fuel to Coastal at an unfavorable price relative to Harbor and Caribbean, and consequently, competition between Coastal, Harbor and Caribbean was thereby injured.   On appeal, CAPECO makes three arguments based on what it purports to be required elements for Coastal's price discrimination damages claim:  first, that the sales in question were not \"in commerce\" and so section 2(a)'s prohibitions do not apply;  second, that Coastal failed to make the requisite showing of competitive injury to prevail;  and third, that Coastal failed to carry its burden of proving actual injury in order to be entitled to an award of money damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>1. \"In Commerce\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CAPECO argues, correctly we conclude, that section 2(a) of the Clayton Act does not apply because in the instant case, neither of the two transactions which evidence the alleged price discrimination crossed a state line.

In the instant case, the price discrimination claims flow out of the same set of facts and require the same evidence as the Sherman Act claims.   Because we uphold the district court's jurisdiction over the Sherman Act claims, see 15 U.S.C. &#167; 4 (1994) (investing \"[t]he several district courts of the United States ... with jurisdiction to prevent and restrain violations of [Title 15] sections 1 to 7[,]\" which includes the Sherman Act), we also must conclude that the district court properly exercised supplementary jurisdiction over the price discrimination claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, we conclude that the district court erred in applying section 2(a) of the Clayton Act to the conduct at issue, and accordingly reverse that part of its opinion.   However, we find applicable section 263 of the Puerto Rico Anti-Monopoly Act, 10 L.P.R.A. &#167; 263.   Because section 263 was patterned after and is almost identical to section 2(a) of the Clayton Act, as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act, we look to the jurisprudence interpreting federal law as a guide in applying the statute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Given that the one key difference between the federal and Puerto Rico statutes is the lack of an \"in commerce\" requirement in the Puerto Rico analogue, we conclude that we should interpret section 263 as intended to extend the provisions of section 2(a) of the Clayton Act to price discrimination within Puerto Rico, the situation which we confront in the instant case.   Given the relative lack of applicable section 263 case law and the well-developed jurisprudence concerning Clayton Act section 2(a), we will focus on the latter in assessing the price discrimination claims.2.

We first address CAPECO's direct challenge to the vitality of the Morton Salt rule, a challenge based on the Supreme Court's opinion in Brooke Group, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112893\"><a href=\"/opinion/112893/brooke-group-ltd-v-brown-williamson-tobacco-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">209</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112893\"><a href=\"/opinion/112893/brooke-group-ltd-v-brown-williamson-tobacco-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In that case, the Supreme Court ruled that, because primary-line price discrimination injury is of the \"same general character\" as predatory pricing schemes actionable under Sherman Act section 2, Brooke Group, 509 U.S. at 221-23, 113 S.Ct. at 2587, a primary-line injury plaintiff bears the same substantive burden as under the Sherman Act, that is, the plaintiff must show that the predator stands some chance of recouping his losses, id. 509 U.S. at 223-24, 113 S.Ct. at 2588.   In so deciding, the Supreme Court implicitly overruled Utah Pie Co. v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">406</span></a></span> (1967), in which the Supreme Court had set forth different standards for primary-line injury.  Brooke Group, 509 U.S. at 221-23, 113 S.Ct. at 2587 (explaining that Utah Pie was merely an \"early judicial inquiry\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to CAPECO, the Supreme Court's recent emphasis in Brooke Group on reconciling the area of price discrimination with other antitrust law requires that we find that the Morton Salt rule no longer is good law.   CAPECO notes that both primary-line and secondary-line price discrimination are prohibited by the same language of section 2(a) as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act.   Furthermore, CAPECO contends that the Supreme Court in Brooke Group apparently undercut any reliance on a principled distinction between the aims of section 2 of the Clayton Act and other antitrust laws' purported emphasis on protecting \"competition, not competitors,\" Brooke Group, 509 U.S. at 224, 113 S.Ct. at 2588 (emphasis in original) (citation omitted);  see also Monahan's Marine, Inc., 866 F.2d at 528-29 (not discussing the Morton Salt rule, but noting that \"unlike the Sherman Act, which protects 'competition not competitors,' ... the [Robinson-Patman] Act protects those who compete with a favored seller, not just the overall competitive process.\"  (emphasis in original)).   Thus, according to CAPECO, precedent that pre-dates Brooke Group and applies the Morton Salt rule must be reexamined.   See, e.g., 496 U.S. at 544, 110 S.Ct. at 2537;  Falls City, 460 U.S. at 436, 103 S.Ct. at 1289;  Boise Cascade v.

See Rebel Oil Co., 51 F.3d at 1446.   Congress first forbade primary-line price discrimination with the Clayton Act of 1914, which originally condemned discrimination that might \"substantially ... lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce.\"   Clayton Antitrust Act, 38 Stat. 730 (1914) (codified as amended at 15 U.S.C. &#167; 13(a) (1994)).   The statute was intended to prevent large corporations from invading markets of small firms and charging predatory prices for the purpose of destroying marketwide competition, and thus specifically applied only to primary-line injury.   See H.R.Rep. No. 627, 63rd Cong., 2d Sess. &#167; 8 (1914);  E. Thomas Sullivan &amp; Jeffrey L. Harrison, Understanding Antitrust and Its Economic Implications &#167; 8.03 (1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By contrast, secondary-line discrimination is forbidden by the Robinson-Patman Act, 49 Stat. 1526 (1936), 15 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 13-13b, 21a (1988), which amended the original Clayton Act's price discrimination proscriptions.   Congress clearly intended the Robinson-Patman Act's provision to apply only to secondary-line cases, not to primary-line cases.   See H.R.Rep. No. 2287, 74th Cong., 2d Sess. &#167; 8 (1936),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> cited in Rebel Oil Co., 51 F.3d at 1446.   In contrast to the Sherman Act and the Clayton Act, which were intended to proscribe only conduct that threatens consumer welfare, the Robinson-Patman Act's framers \"intended to punish perceived economic evils not necessarily threatening to consumer welfare per se.\"  Rebel Oil Co., 51 F.3d at 1445.   See generally Hovenkamp &#167; 2.1a.   In particular, the Robinson-Patman Act's amendments to the Clayton Act stemmed from dissatisfaction with the original Clayton Act's inability to prevent large retail chains from obtaining volume discounts from big suppliers, at the disadvantage of small retailers who competed with the chains.   See S.Rep. No. 1502, 74th Cong., 2d Sess. &#167; 4 (1936);  H.R.Rep. No. 2287, 74th Cong., 2d Sess. &#167;&#167; 3-4 (1936);  see also Morton Salt, 334 U.S. at 49, 68 S.Ct. at 829 (\"Congress intended to protect a merchant from competitive injury attributable to discriminatory prices\");  Rebel Oil Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"693406\"><a href=\"/opinion/693406/rebel-oil-company-inc-a-nevada-corporation-auto-flite-oil-company-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1421</span></a></span>, 1446;  Monahan's Marine, Inc., 866 F.2d at 528-29.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, we are persuaded by the reasoning of the Ninth Circuit's opinion in Rebel Oil Co. that the amendment to the Clayton Act effected by the Robinson-Patman Act supports the continued vitality of the Morton Salt rule, even in the face of Brooke Group's alteration of standards for primary-line price discrimination.   While the Clayton Act only proscribed conduct that may \"substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly[,]\" the new law added the following passage:  \"or to injure, destroy, or prevent competition with any person who either grants or knowingly receives the benefit of such discrimination, or with customers of either of them.\"   See Rebel Oil Co., 51 F.3d at 1447.   The purpose of this passage was to relieve secondary-line plaintiffs--small retailers who are disfavored by discriminating suppliers--from having to prove harm to competition marketwide, allowing them instead to impose liability simply by proving effects on individual competitors.   See id.;   H.R.Rep. No. 2287, 74th Cong., 2d Sess. &#167; 8 (1936).   Such legislative intent directly supports maintaining the Morton Salt rule, which puts into practice Congress' concern with placing the same burden on secondary-line plaintiffs that other antitrust plaintiffs face.   Thus, the comparison that the Supreme Court drew between primary-line price discrimination and predatory pricing in Brooke Group stands on a different, and stronger, footing than any comparison that could be made between secondary-line price discrimination and other area of antitrust law, including, but not only, predatory pricing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, and finally, the holding of the Brooke Group opinion on its face applies only to primary-line cases, not secondary-line cases.   As a result, given the legislative history and statutory language distinctions, we will not presume, without more guidance, that the Supreme Court intended in Brooke Group to alter the well-established rule that it adopted in Morton Salt.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  Thus, we hold that the Morton Salt rule continues to apply to secondary-line injury cases such as the present one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Morton Salt rule provides that, for the purposes of secondary-line claims under section 2(a), \"injury to competition is established prima facie by proof of a substantial price discrimination between competing purchasers over time.\"  Falls City Industries v.

First, the discrimination lasted all 18 months that Coastal was in business, and always exceeded the five cents per barrel that witnesses testified was competitively significant.   Additionally, there was ample testimony that the marine fuel oil business, in which Coastal competed against Caribbean and Harbor, was characterized by thin margins and intense competition.   At any rate, on appeal, CAPECO does not make the argument that Coastal failed to produce evidence required for a prima facie showing of injury to competition under the Morton Salt rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, CAPECO argues that the Morton Salt inference was undercut by evidence \"breaking the causal connection\" between CAPECO's price discrimination and Coastal's lost sales or profits, Falls City, 460 U.S. at 435, 103 S.Ct. at 1288, and showing an absence of competitive injury, Boise Cascade Corp. v.

According to CAPECO, overall market forces depressed the price for bunker fuel more than 30 percent between late 1991 and early 1992, and it was this fact, rather than CAPECO's price discrimination, that led to Coastal's demise.   CAPECO points to the admission of Coastal's CEO that Coastal's sales agents based their price quotes to ships on the prices being charged by competitors in San Juan and other ports, often without even knowing the cost of the fuel that was to be delivered.   According to CAPECO, if prices were set when costs were unknown, then discounts from CAPECO could not have been a material factor in setting prices.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject the argument that this evidence rebuts Coastal's prima facie showing of price discrimination.

Coastal apparently had the capacity to import the residual oil and diesel into San Juan from Aruba.   Coastal also had storage capacity.   CAPECO feared, so Coastal's theory went, that this would allow the refinery in Aruba to compete with CAPECO and threaten CAPECO's ability to sell its targeted 10,000 barrels of residual oil per day to dealers.   Coastal's argument is that CAPECO, fearing that Coastal's affiliate posed a competitive threat, decided to drive Coastal out by (1) engaging in price discrimination against Coastal, (2) discriminating in the provision of residual oil, (3) discriminating in the quality of the residual oil available, and (4) threatening to cut off plaintiff entirely, eventually doing so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Coastal successfully argued to the jury that the relevant geographic market was San Juan Harbor, since neither it nor its competitors, Caribbean and Harbor, could practicably obtain supplies in San Juan Harbor from anyone other than CAPECO.

A larger geographic market would of course lead to a lower figure for the percentage of sales in the market made by CAPECO, likely defeating the monopoly power prong of the monopolization offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In assessing CAPECO's argument, we must bear in mind that \"market definition is a question of fact\" and \"we therefore must affirm the jury's conclusion unless the record is devoid of evidence upon which the jury might reasonably base its conclusion.\"  Weiss v.

The parties agree that the ocean-going vessels can choose to refuel from whatever supplier in the Caribbean and Southeastern United States offers the best terms as to price, quality and dependability.   The market for bunker fuel is therefore extremely fluid and competitive, as the parties agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Coastal argues that, because of this competition, margins for resellers are razor thin and it is virtually impossible for a reseller in San Juan, like Coastal, to obtain residual oil from anyone other than CAPECO.   Transporting supplies from other refineries, such as the refinery Coastal is affiliated with in Aruba, would increase the cost of the fuel to such an extent (transportation costs, import taxes, risk of price changes, and storage costs) that it is not an economically viable alternative.  (Of course, this is, it might be observed, somewhat inconsistent with the theory that CAPECO was so afraid of the 'threat' from Coastal and its Aruba affiliate, that it drove Coastal out of business.)   Consequently, Coastal argues, resellers of bunker fuel must purchase from CAPECO when they do business in San Juan.   In Coastal's view, the San Juan resellers' inability to purchase from suppliers outside of San Juan makes San Juan the relevant market.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not agree.   The touchstone of market definition is whether a hypothetical monopolist could raise prices.   See Rebel Oil Co., 51 F.3d at 1434.   Although a reseller based in San Juan may have nowhere else to turn to in San Juan for its fuel, Coastal did not produce sufficient evidence that this meant CAPECO has the ability to restrict supply and raise prices in San Juan to supracompetitive levels.   Indeed, the evidence points in the other direction.   CAPECO cannot sell its residual oil for bunker fuel unless it does so at a price at which the resellers will be able to sell the fuel to its ultimate consumers, the ocean-going vessels.   Those ocean-going vessels can go anywhere in the Caribbean and Southeastern United States to get their bunker fuel.   If CAPECO were to raise its prices to the resellers, the resellers could not offer the bunker fuel to the ocean-going vessels at competitive prices and the ocean-going vessels would simply get their fuel at another port.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given these facts, the immobility of the resellers does not mean that CAPECO could maximize profits by raising prices significantly above the competitive level.   Raising prices in San Juan would repel the ultimate consumers, who would seek other suppliers.   The resellers would either stop purchasing residual fuel or cease business, or both.   CAPECO would then lose its ability to sell its residual oil for bunker fuel and this would redound to the benefit of CAPECO's competitors.   While under most circumstances the immobility of the resellers would be of considerable importance in defining the market, it does not control here where the mobility of the ultimate consumers protects the immobile resellers.   Cf. Ball Memorial Hosp., Inc. v. Mutual Hosp. Ins., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"465404\"><a href=\"/opinion/465404/ball-memorial-hospital-inc-v-mutual-hospital-insurance-inc-doing/\"><span class=\"volume\">784</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1325</span></a></span> (7th Cir.1986) (Easterbrook, J.)  (relevant market for purposes of health insurance coverage to Indiana consumers was \"regional or national\" not simply Indiana, even though Indiana consumers could not get insurance from any source other than defendant doing business in Indiana;  the mobility of potential rivals to the defendant protected the consumers whose mobility was restricted).   Under the circumstances here, defining the market as San Juan is too narrow.   It does not capture the likelihood of expanded sales by CAPECO's rivals in the event that CAPECO were to raise prices in San Juan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once the relevant market is defined to include a geographic region larger than San Juan (i.e., the Caribbean and Southeastern United States), Coastal has not satisfied its burden of showing that CAPECO had a dominant market share.   While Coastal might, at least in theory, have shown that all refineries throughout the Caribbean and the Southeastern United States behaved like a cartel and priced their residual oil to capture the transportation and other costs of getting oil from sources outside the local ports, it has not done so here and it has failed to produce evidence sufficient for a reasonable jury to infer that such was the case.   In short, Coastal has not shown that CAPECO had monopoly power over the relevant market.   Cf. Zoslaw v. MCA Distrib.  Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"411230\"><a href=\"/opinion/411230/charles-zoslaw-and-jane-zoslaw-husband-and-wife-dba-marin-music-centre-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">693</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">870</span></a></span>, 886-87 (9th Cir.1982) (secondary-line price discrimination under Robinson-Patman Act does not necessarily violate Sherman Act), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1085</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Accordingly, Coastal's monopolization claims fail under both section 2 of the Sherman Act and Title 10, Section 260 of the Laws of Puerto Rico and we reverse the monopolization verdicts.   We note that because we affirm the price discrimination verdict, the reversal on the monopolization theory, by itself, leaves unchanged the amount of antitrust damages awarded, subject to our discussion on damage evidentiary sufficiency in Part I.D., infra.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C.

According to CAPECO, because the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has recently declined to rule that violation of an antitrust statute will also necessarily give rise to a violation of Article 1802, the violation of an antitrust statute does not give rise to a per se violation of Article 1802.   See Pressure Vessels of Puerto Rico, 94 JTS 144, *438-39    Additionally, CAPECO challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the judgment on this issue.   CAPECO asks for a reversal of the verdict on these grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CAPECO's arguments may well have merit.   However, we need express no opinion regarding CAPECO's arguments as CAPECO waived them by failing to object to the jury instructions regarding the Article 1802 claim.   See Linn v. Andover Newton Theological School, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"522861\"><a href=\"/opinion/522861/edmund-h-linn-v-andover-newton-theological-school-inc-edmund-h-linn/\"><span class=\"volume\">874</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5.   These are not simply technical requirements.   By failing to object to the jury instructions, CAPECO denied \"the judge an opportunity to correct his error,\" assuming that CAPECO rightly contends that an error was made.  Id.  While CAPECO may correctly contend that antitrust violations do not fall within the scope of Article 1802, the district court's jury instructions were not strictly limited to antitrust offenses.   It is entirely possible that, had an objection been made, the district court could have charged the jury with antitrust offenses as an Article 1802 ground separately from other Article 1802 grounds that may have applied in the present case.   For example, it could have charged the jury with tortious interference with contractual relations, since CAPECO may well have intentionally complicated, via its refusal to deal, Coastal's efforts to meet its obligations to deliver bunker fuel.   See General Office Products Corp. v. A.M. Capen's Sons, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"463161\"><a href=\"/opinion/463161/general-office-products-corp-v-am-capens-sons-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">780</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1077</span></a></span>, 1081 (1st Cir.1986) (noting that even in the absence of a contract, liability may be incurred under other judicial principles) (citing General Office Products Corp. v.

By failing to object to the instructions in question, CAPECO has deprived us of factual findings that would aid in the resolution of these issues.   Because of the generality of the instruction, we conclude that evidence existed of CAPECO's possibly tortious conduct sufficient for the jury to reasonably reach the verdict that it did.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CAPECO also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the Article 1802 findings.

Id. at 1205-06.   Under the yardstick approach, the plaintiff attempts to identify a firm similar to the plaintiff in all respects but for the impact of the antitrust violation.   Hovenkamp &#167; 17.6b2.   By contrast, under the \"before-and-after\" method, the court looks at the plaintiff's business before the violation occurred, during the violation period, and after the violation ended, and estimates the amount by which the violation reduced the plaintiff's profits.

The plaintiff in Home Placement Service had operated as planned only weeks before the alleged violations began.  Home Placement Service can best be read as demonstrating both the type of situation in which a yardstick method is preferable, and the factors that should go into a court's evaluation of the comparability of the yardstick firm or firms with the plaintiff.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ultimately, the proper method should be determined by the district court in accord with the facts of the situation.   In this case, the district court will have exactly that opportunity, since we must vacate the district court's damages award and remand for further proceedings.   The district court charged the jury with an instruction to find an amount for \"antitrust damages,\" comprising awards for both price discrimination and monopolization claims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a>  Because we reverse the monopolization verdict, if left to stand, the jury's antitrust damages award would likely constitute an excessive recovery.   In coming to its conclusion, the jury may well have weighed harms resulting from conduct that was pleaded with respect to the monopolization offense (e.g. refusal to deal with a customer, lying, etc.) but would have been additional to harms resulting from price discrimination, the claim we uphold.   Furthermore, were we to allow the verdict to stand despite our reversal of the monopolization verdict, there would exist the strong likelihood that the jury had granted Coastal a duplicative recovery under monopolization and tort law, for injury caused by the same conduct, such as refusal to deal and lying.   The law \"abhors duplicative recoveries.\"  Dopp v.

CAPECO contends that both Coastal's antitrust and tort claims were grounded in the same set of acts.   Because we vacate and remand the antitrust damages for further findings on price discrimination damages, we construe CAPECO's argument that price discrimination and tort damages would constitute duplicative damage recoveries, see Borden v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"562609\"><a href=\"/opinion/562609/ronald-borden-v-the-paul-revere-life-insurance-company-ronald-borden-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">935</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">370</span></a></span>, 382 (1st Cir.1991) (\"recovery against a defendant under one tort theory precludes any duplicative recovery for the same damages under some other tort theory\"), and so a new trial or remittitur is required, see Dopp v.

First, CAPECO failed to object to the form or content of the special interrogatories to which the jury answered.   Second, CAPECO may well have waived its right to raise this issue here, since it failed to raise the issue in a timely manner with the trial court.   Previously, we have held that a defendant may not argue verdict inconsistency if he or she failed to object \"after the verdict was read and before the jury was discharged.\"   See McIsaac v. Didriksen Fishing Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"481636\"><a href=\"/opinion/481636/james-r-mcisaac-v-didriksen-fishing-corp-appeal-of-the-wise-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">809</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">129</span></a></span>, 134 (1st Cir.1987).   This rule is grounded in the realization that \"to decide otherwise would countenance 'agreeable acquiescence to perceivable error as a weapon of appellate advocacy.' \"  Id. (quoting Merchant v.

As we have noted above, Coastal may have had a legitimate Article 1802 claim apart from any overlap with antitrust law.   Had CAPECO chosen to object to the district court's instructions, the district court may have corrected this problem.   Accordingly, giving the district court the benefit of the doubt, had it responded to a timely objection by CAPECO and given an Article 1802 instruction that did not overlap with antitrust claims, the jury's damages verdicts on tort and antitrust claims could have been consistent.   Even assuming, arguendo, that CAPECO correctly asserts that such overlap occurred, to grant CAPECO a new trial now on the basis of duplicative recovery would allow it to avoid the result of its own failure to object to the Article 1802 instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. CAPECO's Experts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, CAPECO argues that the district court's refusal to allow its two experts, Dr. Jorge Freyre (\"Dr. Freyre\") and Dr. Elias Gutierrez (\"Dr. Gutierrez\"), to testify was based on a fundamental error of law and was an abuse of discretion that requires that we reverse the district court and order a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to evaluate CAPECO's contentions, we must review the district court's orders leading up to the exclusion of the relevant testimony.   The district court's June 22, 1993 Scheduling Order stated that \"[t]he parties will announce the names and qualifications of their experts by October 1, 1993.\"   This date was modified subsequently to December 1, 1993.   In compliance with this order, CAPECO named Cesar Figueroa (\"Figueroa\") and Rafael Martinez-Margarida (\"Martinez-Margarida\").   On March 1, 1994, pursuant to a motion by new counsel for Caribbean, the district court modified the previous order and issued a revised scheduling order stating \"all experts are to be announced by March 30,\" and also specifying that expert reports to be used \"during each party's case-in-chief\" were to be exchanged on June 3, 1994, and that expert rebuttal reports were to be exchanged on July 1, 1994.   Upon CAPECO's June 1 motion, the date for reports to be exchanged was extended by an \"Omnibus Order\" to ten days after service of that order, dated August 15, 1994.   On August 29, 1994, Coastal delivered to CAPECO expert reports prepared by Dr. Sherwin and Dr. Zalacain, and CAPECO provided Coastal with an expert report prepared by Figueroa.   These experts were deposed between September 9 and September 14, and thereafter CAPECO retained experts Dr. Freyre and Dr. Gutierrez ostensibly as rebuttal witnesses under Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(2)(C).   CAPECO informed Coastal on September 20, 1994, that it had retained Dr. Freyre as a rebuttal witness, and similarly informed Coastal of Dr. Gutierrez on or about October 4, 1994.   CAPECO informed the district court about Dr. Freyre and Dr. Gutierrez on October 5, 1995.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court instructed CAPECO to produce Dr. Freyre and Dr. Gutierrez and to make them available for depositions.   On October 5 and October 6, Coastal filed motions in limine to exclude Dr. Freyre and Dr. Gutierrez, respectively, on the theory that neither witness could properly be characterized as a \"rebuttal\" witness within the meaning of Rule 26(a)(2)(C), and thus both should have been disclosed previously.   After oral argument, the district court granted Coastal's motion and excluded the testimony of Dr. Freyre and Dr. Gutierrez.   The district court, upon CAPECO's admission that it planned to use Dr. Freyre and Dr. Gutierrez in its case-in-chief, noted that \"you got a problem with my orders because you have not complied with my orders insofar as Freyre and Gutierrez [are] concerned,\" apparently referring to the previous scheduling order deadline for experts in the case-in-chief to be disclosed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CAPECO argues (1) that because the Omnibus Order did not provide a deadline for the exchange of rebuttal expert reports, no scheduling order applied, and therefore the disclosure of Dr. Freyre and Dr. Gutierrez was controlled by Rule 26(a)(2)(C);<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a>  and (2) that the district court misconstrued Rule 26(a)(2)(C) to signify that a defendant cannot offer testimony to \"contradict or rebut\" under Rule 26(a)(2)(C).   We need not consider whether the district court in fact misconstrued Rule 26(a)(2)(C), because, for three reasons, we find no abuse of discretion in its exclusion of these witnesses as rebuttal witnesses.   First, at no time did CAPECO ever seek leave of the court to announce the names of experts not disclosed by December 1, 1993, as originally required, or by March 30, 1994, as permitted by the trial court.   CAPECO's motion of June 1 sought extension principally due to alleged noncooperation by Coastal in discovery, making CAPECO's experts' task difficult to complete by the deadline then in effect.   We cannot conclude, as CAPECO does, that the Omnibus Order's extension rendered all other orders unbinding.   Because CAPECO did not ask for its extension on the grounds it now argues, the district court could not have had such an effect in mind, nor was it given an opportunity to consider such effect.   A trial court may \"readily exclude a witness or exhibit if some previous order had set a deadline for identification and the proponent [has], without adequate excuse, failed to list the witness or exhibit.\"  Fusco v. General Motors Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"658541\"><a href=\"/opinion/658541/38-fed-r-evid-serv-677-prodliabrepcchp-13786-carol-gagne-fusco/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">259</span></a></span>, 265 (1st Cir.1993);  see also Freund v.

The proximity in time between CAPECO's attempts to bring in Dr. Freyre and Dr. Gutierrez and actual trial casts doubt on any argument that CAPECO was somehow misled into thinking that previous Scheduling Orders did not apply.   Finally, even assuming that CAPECO is correct that the Scheduling Order's provisions regarding rebuttal witnesses had been superceded and thus Rule 26(a)(2)(B) applied, the district court might still have enforced its previous deadlines regarding experts in the case-in-chief.   For better or for worse, at oral argument on October 21, 1994 (three days before trial was to start), counsel for CAPECO identified Dr. Freyre and Dr. Gutierrez as witnesses in its case-in-chief.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the circumstances, we cannot conclude that the exclusion of the testimony of Dr. Freyre and Dr. Gutierrez was an abuse of discretion warranting a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. CAPECO's Meeting Competition Defense</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CAPECO also argues that the district court should have given jury instructions on the affirmative defense of meeting competition.   Section 2(b) of Clayton Act, as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act, permits a defendant to rebut a prima facie case of violation by showing that its lower price \"was made in good faith to meet an equally low price of a competitor.\"  15 U.S.C. &#167; 13(b).   The \"meeting competition\" defense can be raised only by a defendant who responds in good faith to the believed lower price of a competitor.  United States v.

In Falls City, the Supreme Court concluded that Congress intended the meeting competition defense \"to allow reasonable pricing responses on an area-specific basis where competitive circumstances warrant them.\"  Id. at 448, 103 S.Ct. at 1295.   Here, the district court could reasonably conclude that the defense did not apply, since there was a lack of evidence, beyond CAPECO's own employees' testimony about what they believed to be the case, that CFMI offered lower prices on bunker fuel in San Juan than CAPECO.   See Rose Confections, Inc. v. Ambrosia Chocolate Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"486598\"><a href=\"/opinion/486598/rose-confections-inc-v-ambrosia-chocolate-company-a-division-of-wr/\"><span class=\"volume\">816</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">381</span></a></span>, 391-93 (8th Cir.1987) (ruling defense rejected where seller relied on \"assumption or speculation\" without verification that competitor's prices were in fact lower).   Therefore, we do not find abuse of discretion in the district court's denial of a new trial based on its refusal to issue a jury instruction on the meeting competition defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p>D. CAPECO's Puerto Rico Law Tort Counterclaim</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CAPECO contends that the district court erred in dismissing its counterclaim grounded in Article 1802, 31 L.P.R.A. &#167; 5141.   According to CAPECO, it was a compulsory counterclaim and was thus not barred by the one year statute of limitations, at least to the extent of defeating the main claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject CAPECO's argument for two reasons.   First, in opposition to Coastal's motion for summary judgment on the counterclaim, it failed to inform the district court of the theory it now advances, that it is entitled to recoupment notwithstanding the statute of limitations.   Additionally, the gist of CAPECO's counterclaim argument was that the threat posed by Coastal and CFMI allegedly working in concert forced CAPECO to give Harbor and Caribbean discounts, costing CAPECO potential profits.   Given that we uphold the district court's finding that these discounts were illegal price discrimination, it appears at least doubtful under Puerto Rico law that CAPECO can collect for any lost profits thereby incurred.   See, e.g., Rubio-Sacarello v. Roig, 84 D.P.R. 344, 351 (P.R.1962) (stating, in a contract context, that one who is guilty of illegality cannot bring an action).   As a result, we fail to find abuse of discretion by the district court in its decision not to grant a new trial on this basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Coastal succeeded below on three claims:  price discrimination, monopolization and tort.   CAPECO's failure to make the points below that it now argues on appeal hamstrung its attempt to obtain reversal of the price discrimination and tort claims.   But the definition of relevant market Coastal espoused could not be reasonably adopted by the jury, since this definition was legally insufficient in neglecting to account for downstream constraints on the proposed monopoly, and in failing to draw on sufficient evidence regarding those constraints.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the United States Court of International Trade</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> CAPECO tried to argue below and again argues here, that the contracts it executed with Caribbean and Harbor were qualitatively different in their non-price terms and conditions from CAPECO's arrangement with Coastal, justifying the discounts.
