FED. R. CRIM. P. 11(a)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sometime in 1998, FBI Special Agent David Bowdich was assigned to investigate a series of bank robberies that occurred in San Diego in 1997 and 1998, including the February 10, 1998, robbery of a Bank of America on Ulrich Street. Approximately two years later, Bowdich received information from an unnamed source that a person known as \"Ralphie Rabbit\" was a participant in the Ulrich Street robbery. Bowdich was led to believe that \"Ralphie Rabbit\" was an alias used by Raphyal Crawford.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bowdich conducted a background investigation on Crawford and learned that Crawford was on state parole. Bowdich also learned that Crawford had signed what is commonly referred to as a \"Fourth Waiver\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> as a condition of his parole. Specifically, the \"Fourth Waiver\" document contained the following parole conditions:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">You and your residence and any property under your control may be searched without a warrant by an agent of the Department of Corrections or any law enforcement officer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">You agree to search or seizure by a parole officer or other peace officer at any time of the day or night, with or without a search warrant, and with or without cause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bowdich testified that it is a common practice for law enforcement officers to use \"Fourth Waivers\" as a \"kind of tool to talk\" to a suspect about crimes. In order to talk to Crawford about the robbery, Bowdich contacted Crawford's parole agent, Carl Berner, and obtained his permission<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> to conduct a parole search of the residence where Crawford was living with his sister.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bowdich repeatedly testified that when he conducted the parole search on July 27, 2000, he did not expect to find any evidence linking Crawford to the Ulrich Street robbery or to any other criminal conduct, although he \"hoped\" he might find something that would show that Crawford was currently engaging in criminal activity. The robbery had occurred more than two years earlier; little physical evidence from the incident remained unaccounted for; Crawford was living in a different residence at the time of the robbery; and in the interim, he had been imprisoned in another state for an unrelated offense. Under these circumstances, Bowdich acknowledged that he did not expect the search to reveal any physical evidence of the bank robbery. Rather, he intended to use the parole search solely as a \"tool to see\" Crawford and to induce him to talk.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the early morning of July 27, Bowdich met four other law enforcement officials, including Detective Michael Gutierrez, and knocked on the door of Crawford's residence. When Crawford's sister Abdullah answered the door, Bowdich stated that the officers were there to conduct a parole search and Abdullah told them that Crawford was in the bedroom asleep with his eighteen-month-old daughter. Bowdich, Gutierrez, and at least one other officer went into the bedroom and found Crawford and his young child on the bed. Both Crawford and Gutierrez stated that the officers had their weapons drawn when they went into the bedroom.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The officers told Crawford that they were conducting a parole search, and escorted him to the living room, where he remained seated on a couch, under \"investigatory detention,\" through the course of the search. While the search was being conducted, he was not permitted to move, even to get a glass of water.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The search itself may have lasted as long as 50 minutes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> As expected, no evidence of any criminal activity was discovered. However, as planned, Bowdich used the time to initiate a conversation with Crawford. The discussion began with some \"chit chat\" that was designed \"to put Mr. Crawford at ease\" and dispel the \"meversus-you\" atmosphere. Then Bowdich told Crawford that, although he was not under arrest, he would really like him to talk about \"an old bank robbery case.\" Crawford initially stated that he did not know anything about the robbery, but Bowdich suspected that he knew more than he was letting on, and thought that Crawford would talk if he was placed in the \"right environment.\" Bowdich testified that he wanted to eliminate the distractions, bring Crawford to an area where Bowdich was in charge of the scene, and eliminate the possibility that he would end \"up in some hearing later where the defense is alleging that I've got five officers milling around, and that could be a coercive atmosphere.\" In order to make it \"as clean as possible,\" Bowdich asked Crawford whether he would be \"more comfortable\" talking to the officers at the FBI office. Crawford agreed to the suggested alternative and was escorted &#8212; with an officer on each side &#8212; to Bowdich's vehicle, which was parked outside.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Crawford was not handcuffed at any point. However, Crawford's sister testified that she assumed he was under arrest based on the length of the search, the way he was detained in the living room, and the fact that he was leaving with officers walking on both sides of him. Moreover, despite the fact that Crawford's own car was parked in front of the house, he was transported to the FBI office in Bowdich's unmarked car.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bowdich drove to the FBI offices, which were located about 20 minutes from the residence. Detective Gutierrez sat with Crawford in the back seat of the car. Bowdich and Gutierrez continued the \"chit chat\" with Crawford during the drive, as a means of putting him at ease.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After arriving at the FBI offices, Bowdich and Gutierrez took Crawford into an interview room, and closed the door \"for [] privacy.\" They then told Crawford that he was not in custody and could leave at any time. Bowdich began to read Crawford his <i>Miranda</i> rights, because he wanted to \"make the case cleaner.\" Crawford, however, interrupted in protest before Bowdich finished the second line of the warnings. Both agents again told Crawford that he was not in custody and could leave. Bowdich never completed the <i>Miranda</i> warnings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The interrogation continued for approximately an hour to an hour and a half.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> No weapons were drawn. Eventually, Crawford confessed that he was a participant in the February 10, 1998, robbery and admitted to having used a gun during the crime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 16, 2001, Crawford was indicted for armed bank robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2113(a) and (d) and for knowingly using and carrying a firearm in the commission of the robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 924(c)(1) and (2).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Crawford moved to suppress the statements that he made to the law enforcement officers on July 27. After three evidentiary hearings, the district court denied Crawford's motion on both Fourth and Fifth Amendment grounds. It specifically held that the initial detention of Crawford in his residence pursuant to the parole search was unlawful under <i>United States v. Knights,</i> 219 F.3d 1138 (9th Cir.2000);<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> however, under <i>Dunaway v. New York,</i> 442 U.S. 200, 99 S.Ct. 2248, 60 L.Ed.2d 824 (1979), and <i>Brown v. Illinois,</i> 422 U.S. 590, 95 S.Ct. 2254, 45 L.Ed.2d 416 (1975), the court found sufficient attenuating factors between detention and confession to purge the taint, rendering the subsequent statement admissible. The district court also rejected Crawford's Fifth Amendment claim that he was held in custody during the interrogation and therefore entitled to full <i>Miranda</i> warnings. Finally, the court determined that Crawford's confession was not involuntary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, Crawford entered a conditional guilty plea to the charged counts pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(a)(2). He reserved for appeal the denial of his motion to suppress.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> We review denials of motions to suppress <i>de novo. See United States v.

As the district court properly noted, however, federal law &#8212; not California law &#8212; governs the extent of the protection that the Fourth Amendment provides.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> <i>See Ooley,</i> 116 F.3d at 372; <i>Davis,</i> 932 F.2d at 758. Accordingly, we must look to federal law to determine the expectation of privacy that Crawford reasonably possesses; once this threshold is established, a state may not define away the constitutional protection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under federal law, Crawford's expectation of privacy in his own home is not wholly defeated by virtue of his parole status.

Wisconsin,</i> 483 U.S. 868, 873, 107 S.Ct. 3164, 97 L.Ed.2d 709 (1987).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> To find otherwise would be to equate a parolee's home with a prisoner's cell &#8212; a comparison that the Supreme Court has unequivocally rejected. <i>Compare Hudson v. Palmer,</i> 468 U.S. 517, 525-26, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984) (finding that the Fourth Amendment \"does not apply within the confines of a prison cell\"); <i>with Morrissey v. Brewer,</i> 408 U.S. 471, 482, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972) (\"Though the State properly subjects [a parolee] to many restrictions not applicable to other citizens, his condition is very different from that of confinement in a prison.\"). As we stated en banc over a generation ago:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the theory upon which courts have usually relied to justify stripping parolees of Fourth Amendment protection has been widely criticized.

However, it is implicit in the Court's statements in <i>Knights</i> and <i>Griffin</i> that probation and parole searches are limited by some reasonable and legally protectable privacy interest. <i>See Knights,</i> 534 U.S. at 119, 122 S.Ct. 587 (\"When an officer has reasonable suspicion that a probationer subject to a search condition is engaged in criminal activity, there is enough likelihood that criminal conduct is occurring that an intrusion on the probationer's significantly <i>diminished</i> privacy interests is reasonable.\") (emphasis added); <i>Griffin,</i> 483 U.S. at 875, 107 S.Ct. 3164 (\"Supervision [of parolees] is a `special need' of the State permitting a <i>degree</i> of impingement upon privacy that would not be constitutional if applied to the public at large. <i>That permissible degree is not unlimited, however</i>....\") (emphasis added). By mandating that we balance the government's interests against the privacy interests of a probationer or parolee, and by declaring the individual's privacy interests to be diminished but not extinguished, <i>see supra</i> section II.A.1, the Supreme Court has made it clear that in the case of searches pursuant to parole conditions, the ordinary search requirements are to be relaxed but not eliminated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the fact that a parole search invades the home must weigh heavily in the \"totality of the circumstances\" that determines whether such a search is reasonable. <i>See Knights,</i> 534 U.S. at 118, 122 S.Ct. 587; <i>see also Carter,</i> 525 U.S. at 88, 119 S.Ct. 469 (\"[T]he extent to which the Fourth Amendment protects people may depend upon where those people are.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a> As noted above, <i>supra</i> section II.A.1, the Supreme Court considers the home sacrosanct, and permits government searches of the home only pursuant to enhanced procedural safeguards.

The dissent correctly characterizes parole as a \"special need\" of the state, but incorrectly concludes that upon invocation of that phrase, Fourth Amendment protections vanish. <i>Griffin</i> itself stated otherwise.

City of Charleston,</i> 532 U.S. 67, 84, 121 S.Ct. 1281, 149 L.Ed.2d 205 (2001). Those factors are: (1) that the search was of Crawford's home, and (2) that the government's practice was designed to discover evidence of crime for future prosecution. As to the first factor, in a few exceptional \"special needs\" cases, searches not founded on any degree of individualized suspicion have been approved &#8212; but these searches have not involved the home. <i>See Bd. of Educ. v.

We are not free to adopt the <i>Reyes</i> \"suspicionless\" standard. As we have explained <i>supra,</i> in light of Supreme Court precedent applying the Fourth Amendment, a degree of individualized suspicion is constitutionally required in order to conduct a search of the home of a parolee.

To call this choice &#8212; either waiver or certain incarceration &#8212; \"free and voluntary\" would be to misconceive the concept of meaningful consent.

Indeed, under the government's theory, all parolees could be forced to waive all constitutional rights, including the right to due process in revocation proceedings, or even the right to trial on any new offense allegedly committed during the parole period.

Johns,</i> 891 F.2d 243, 244 (9th Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The pivotal question in determining attenuation is \"whether, granting establishment of the primary illegality, the evidence... has been come at by exploitation of that illegality or instead by means sufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the primary taint.\" <i>Wong Sun,</i> 371 U.S. at 487-88, 83 S.Ct. 407 (internal quotation marks omitted). In order to determine whether Crawford's statement was \"come at by exploitation of\" the illegal parole search and detention, we consider three factors: (1) the temporal proximity of the illegal search and detention to the statement; (2) the presence of any intervening circumstances; and, \"particularly,\" (3) the \"purpose and flagrancy\" of the official misconduct. <i>Taylor v. Alabama,</i> 457 U.S. 687, 690, 102 S.Ct. 2664, 73 L.Ed.2d 314 (1982); <i>Dunaway v. New York,</i> 442 U.S. 200, 218, 99 S.Ct. 2248, 60 L.Ed.2d 824 (1979); <i>Brown v. Illinois,</i> 422 U.S. 590, 603-04, 95 S.Ct. 2254, 45 L.Ed.2d 416 (1975). The \"burden of showing admissibility rests, of course, on the prosecution.\" <i>Brown,</i> 422 U.S. at 604, 95 S.Ct. 2254. The prosecution has not met that burden here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Temporal Proximity</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the district court correctly noted, the first factor weighs heavily in favor of suppressing the statements. Only a twenty-minute drive to the FBI offices separated Crawford's illegal detention and his interrogation. The district court was correct to find that so little elapsed time was insufficient to purge the taint. <i>See, e.g., Brown,</i> 422 U.S. at 604, 95 S.Ct. 2254 (less than two hours not sufficient to purge taint); <i>Taylor,</i> 457 U.S. at 691, 102 S.Ct. 2664 (six hours not sufficient); <i>United States v. Perez-Esparza,</i> 609 F.2d 1284, 1290 (9th Cir.1980) (three hours not sufficient); <i>United States v. George,</i> 883 F.2d 1407, 1416 (9th Cir.1989) (\"As best we are aware, no court has weighed the first factor against a defendant when his inculpatory statement followed illegal police conduct by only a few hours.\"). Although \"[t]he lack of a significant intervening period of time does not, in itself, require that the evidence be suppressed for want of sufficient attenuation,\" <i>United States v. Wellins,</i> 654 F.2d 550, 555 (9th Cir.1981), it does \"bear[] directly on the probability of taint,\" <i>United States v. Delgadillo-Velasquez,</i> 856 F.2d 1292, 1300 (9th Cir.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Intervening Circumstances</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court concluded that the limited time between the illegal parole search and Crawford's statements did not purge the taint, because it found the temporal proximity outweighed by the other two prongs of the attenuation test. Specifically, with respect to the second prong, the district court found the following intervening circumstances: (1) that Crawford was \"street savvy\" and thus must have known that the agents had found nothing in the search; (2) that Crawford was told several times that he was not under arrest and was free to leave; (3) that Crawford voluntarily chose the FBI office as the venue for the interrogation; and (4) that Crawford's interruption of the <i>Miranda</i> warnings showed his exercise of some free will.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By focusing on Crawford's state of mind rather than on intervening events, the district court misconceived the nature of the \"intervening circumstances\" analysis. The facts relied on by the district court are, like <i>Miranda</i> warnings, principally useful in determining whether a confession was voluntary for Fifth Amendment purposes. However, the determination that a statement is voluntary \"for purposes of the Fifth Amendment is merely a threshold requirement for Fourth Amendment analysis. The reason for this approach is clear: [t]he exclusionary rule, ... when utilized to effectuate the Fourth Amendment, serves interests and policies that are distinct from those it serves under the Fifth Amendment,\" <i>Taylor,</i> 457 U.S. at 690, 102 S.Ct. 2664 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted); <i>see also Brown,</i> 422 U.S. at 600-04, 95 S.Ct. 2254.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth Amendment attenuation analysis focuses on the circumstances that serve the twin interests of the exclusionary rule: deterrence and judicial integrity. <i>See, e.g., Brown,</i> 422 U.S. at 599-600, 95 S.Ct. 2254. We look not at the defendant's conduct, but rather at \"intervening events of significance\" that \"render inapplicable the deterrence and judicial integrity purposes that justify excluding [a tainted] statement.\" <i>See United States v. Ricardo D.,</i> 912 F.2d 337, 343 (9th Cir.1990); <i>Perez-Esparza,</i> 609 F.2d at 1289. Intervening circumstances that militate in favor of attenuation must be sufficiently important to ensure that potentially tainted evidence was \"come at by way of\" some process other than the exploitation of an illegal search. <i>Wong Sun,</i> 371 U.S. at 487-88, 83 S.Ct. 407. Examples include release from custody, an appearance before a magistrate, or consultation with an attorney, \"such that we would be able to say that [a defendant's decision to confess] was an `unconstrained, independent decision' that was completely unrelated to [the] initial unlawful\" violation. <i>George,</i> 883 F.2d at 1416; <i>see also Perez-Esparza,</i> 609 F.2d at 1289 (\"In some cases, the intervening, completely self-motivated decision of a putative defendant to inculpate himself is so unforeseeable an event, from the arresting officer's vantage point, that excluding the defendant's statement would serve no deterrent purpose.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There were no such intervening events here. Crawford was taken, in continuous law enforcement presence, directly from the site of his illegal search and detention to the site of his interrogation. He did not speak to an attorney, or, indeed, any individual other than Bowdich and Gutierrez.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn33\" id=\"fn33_ref\">33</a> No circumstance cited by the district court amounts to an event of the type or significance necessary to purge taint. As with the first factor, we find that the intervening circumstances prong weighs against a finding of attenuation. <i>See Perez-Esparza,</i> 609 F.2d at 1290 (\"The deterrence rationale was not vitiated, as in <i>Wong Sun,</i> by a lengthy period away from police influences. Nor, for the same reasons, can we find that [the defendant's] decision to speak was so independent of police pressures as to absolve the judicial system from the charge of savoring the forbidden fruits of unconstitutional conduct. The first two factors thus dictate a finding of no attenuation.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. \"Purpose and Flagrancy\" of the Official Misconduct</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court made a similar error in its analysis of the third, \"particularly important,\" prong. <i>George,</i> 883 F.2d at 1416. In holding that the third factor weighed in favor of attenuation, the district court credited the agents' testimony that they did not use any implied promises in their interrogation. As above, however, this type of analysis \"betrays a lingering confusion between `voluntariness' for purposes of the Fifth Amendment and the `causal connection' test established in <i>Brown.</i> Satisfying the Fifth Amendment is only the `threshold' condition of the Fourth Amendment analysis required by <i>Brown.</i>\" <i>Dunaway,</i> 442 U.S. at 219, 99 S.Ct. 2248.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead, under a proper analysis, this prong suggests suppression if the law enforcement officials conducted the illegal search with the purpose of extracting the evidence in question, or if they flagrantly broke the law in conducting the search. In reciting the <i>Brown</i> factors, courts usually choose a conjunctive phrasing (\"purpose <i>and</i> flagrancy\"), but the same courts then find in favor of taint if there is evidence of <i>either</i> improper purpose <i>or</i> flagrant illegality. <i>See, e.g., Taylor,</i> 457 U.S. at 693, 102 S.Ct. 2664 (only \"purpose\"); <i>Dunaway,</i> 442 U.S. at 218-19, 99 S.Ct. 2248 (only \"purpose\"); <i>United States v. Jenkins,</i> 938 F.2d 934, 941 (9th Cir.1991) (only \"flagrancy\"); <i>George,</i> 883 F.2d at 1416 (only \"flagrancy\"). We also find the disjunctive analysis more persuasive, and explicitly clarify that either improper purpose or flagrant illegality will support a determination that the third prong of the test weighs against attenuation. Although either element alone would suffice, we find both present here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bowdich testified extensively that the search was executed <i>in order to</i> induce Crawford to talk. In other words, the evidence that was ultimately obtained was not the mere byproduct of the search, but its primary objective. Moreover, by conducting the search solely to pressure Crawford into talking, Bowdich and his accompanying officers blatantly ignored then-existing Ninth Circuit law prohibiting \"law enforcement/investigatory\" parole searches.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn34\" id=\"fn34_ref\">34</a> <i>See supra</i> note 10. The search and detention was not questionably illegal; it was flagrantly so.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn35\" id=\"fn35_ref\">35</a> This combination calls for hornbook application of the exclusionary rule, which is designed to deter government officials from conducting illegal searches by suppressing the evidence that provoked the search. <i>See, e.g., Brown,</i> 422 U.S. at 605, 95 S.Ct. 2254 (refusing to purge taint where \"[t]he arrest, both in design and in execution, was investigatory. The detectives embarked upon this expedition for evidence in the hope that something might turn up.\"); <i>Perez-Esparza,</i> 609 F.2d at 1289 (\"When police purposely effect an illegal arrest or detention in the hope that custodial interrogation will yield incriminating statements, the deterrence rationale for application of the exclusionary rule is especially compelling.\"). In fact, we have found this factor \"decisive most often in those cases where [sic] police officers ... took a suspect into custody hoping that an interrogation would yield incriminating statements.\" <i>George,</i> 883 F.2d at 1416. We find that the third prong of the attenuation analysis therefore weighs heavily in favor of suppression.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find that, in both design and effect, Crawford's statements at the FBI offices were \"come at by exploitation of\" the illegal parole search. <i>Wong Sun,</i> 371 U.S. at 487-88, 83 S.Ct. 407. The government has not met its burden of showing that the taint of the search was attenuated by any of the factors articulated in <i>Brown</i> or its progeny. Therefore, as a fruit of the illegal search, Crawford's statements must be suppressed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because law enforcement officials conducted a search of Crawford's home without reasonable suspicion to believe that they would uncover evidence of criminal activity, we hold that the search violated the Fourth Amendment. The fact that Crawford signed a blanket \"Fourth Waiver\" as a mandatory condition of his parole does not serve to waive the minimum constitutional protection of reasonable suspicion to which he and other parolees are entitled. Moreover, as neither time, intervening events, nor the officers' motives purged the taint of the unconstitutional search, Crawford's subsequent statements must be suppressed. We therefore reverse the district court's denial of the motion to suppress and remand to allow Crawford to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Every court action protecting the constitutional rights of individuals evokes vigorous objections from those who foresee disastrous consequences; the comments of our learned dissenting colleague demonstrate that this opinion is no exception. Surely, law enforcement could succeed in incarcerating a greater number of dangerous individuals if we dispensed entirely with the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, or even with the Sixth. However, our Founders chose a Constitution that <i>balances</i> liberty and security, and that preserves to all individuals certain guarantees against the existence of a police state. We have sought to balance the relevant interests and thereby to honor our obligation to the Constitution. We very much doubt that what we have done will be understood or valued only by \"the Richard Allen Davises of the underworld.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn36\" id=\"fn36_ref\">36</a> <i>Post</i> at 737.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In referring to the parole condition as a \"Fourth Waiver,\" we adopt the government's preferred nomenclature.

Crawford's counsel pressed the issue, stating that he thought the \"quantum of information which was available\" to the investigators was relevant. The prosecutor replied that the information available to them was \"not relevant for determining\" the Fourth and Fifth Amendment issues. The court ultimately stated that it would assume for purposes of the motion that even though the government had information that Crawford was a participant in the robbery, there was not probable cause to arrest him<i>See infra</i> note 28. There is no evidence in the record regarding the nature or source of the information that led Bowdich to suspect Crawford. More important, Bowdich's testimony makes it clear that he had no reason to suspect that he would find evidence relating to a crime at Crawford's home, and thus had no basis other than the \"Fourth Waiver\" for the search. <i>See id.</i></p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Crawford and his sister thought that the search took about an hour, and police records indicate that the officers were in the residence from 8:20 a.m. until approximately 9:10 a.m</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> According to Crawford, he did not at first agree to leave.

Searches independently instituted by probation officers were deemed valid probation searches, while searches conducted at the request of police trying to evade Fourth Amendment requirements (\"subterfuge\" searches using probation officers as \"stalking horses\") were deemed invalid investigation searches. <i>See, e.g., id.</i></p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Knights,</i> the Supreme Court refused to consider the subjective \"actual motivations\" of individual officers, and disapproved the distinction between a search for probation purposes and a search for investigation purposes. <i>See Knights,</i> 534 U.S. at 116-18, 121, 122 S.Ct. 587. Instead, <i>Knights</i> required an objective reasonableness analysis, conducted by \"examining the totality of the circumstances, with [a] probation search condition being a salient circumstance.\" <i>Knights,</i> 534 U.S. at 118, 122 S.Ct. 587.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> This threshold inquiry is often discussed in terms of an individual's \"standing\" to invoke Fourth Amendment protections<i>See United States v.

In order to avoid confusion with the wholly different doctrine defining Article III \"standing,\" <i>see United States v. Gamez-Orduno,</i> 235 F.3d 453, 458 n. 7 (9th Cir.2000), the Supreme Court has strongly cautioned against using that particular label in the Fourth Amendment context. <i>See Carter,</i> 525 U.S. at 87-88, 119 S.Ct. 469 (\"The Minnesota courts analyzed whether respondents had a legitimate expectation of privacy under the rubric of `standing' doctrine, an analysis that this Court expressly rejected 20 years ago....

The district court's implicit factual finding that Crawford had a subjective expectation of privacy in his person and his home is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The government makes much of two facts purportedly showing that, despite the district court's finding, Crawford had no actual expectation of privacy. The first is Crawford's assessment of his reaction to Bowdich's assertion during the parole search that the officials could detain him simply because he was on parole. Crawford stated at trial that \"I mean, I just, you know, just took for granted that, you know, I'm on parole, that I don't have no rights at all, so I didn't really say nothing.\" This resigned submission to the officials' asserted authority does not invalidate Crawford's expectation of privacy in his own home.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The second fact is Crawford's signature on the \"Fourth Waiver,\" a compulsory parole condition that purports to permit a search of his home, at any time, with or without a warrant, with or without cause. The government claims that Crawford could not have had any subjective expectation of privacy after signing the condition. As discussed in Section II.A.3, <i>infra,</i> the \"Fourth Waiver\" does not extend so far, and Crawford's signature can only be deemed to reduce his expectation of privacy to, at most, the condition's lawful limits. Moreover, although Crawford may have known that he was potentially subject to police search, this court has \"rejected the argument that a person lacks a subjective expectation of privacy simply because he ... could have expected the police to intrude on his privacy.\" <i>United States v. Sandoval,</i> 200 F.3d 659, 660 (9th Cir.2000). Indeed, consistent with the testimony of Crawford's parole officer that parolees are sometimes \"very surprised\" by searches even after signing \"Fourth Waivers,\" Crawford stated that although he knew what a parole search entailed, he was \"shocked\" when the officials invaded his home. The natural shock that Crawford felt upon being roused from his own bed by law enforcement officials with weapons drawn is not consistent with the government's contention that Crawford actually had no expectation of privacy at all.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn14\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14_ref\">14</a>\n        <p> We recognize that the California Supreme Court has apparently determined that California law does not recognize as legitimate the expectation of privacy of a parolee subject to a \"properly imposed parole search condition,\"<i>People v.

Moreover, the \"hunch\" sentence is based entirely on the proposition, first rejected in another concurrence, authored by Judge Wright, <i>see id.</i> (Wright, J., concurring), and subsequently rejected by the Supreme Court in <i>Knights, see supra</i> note 10, that parole officers have a unique knowledge of the parolee that requires that their searches be governed by a different standard than those conducted by police officers.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">None of the thirteen judges on the en banc court, however, expressed any disagreement with the conclusions stated in the excerpt quoted in the text, <i>supra,</i> except for the dissenters &#8212; who would have imposed an even stricter standard on parole searches (i.e., requiring a warrant and probable cause). <i>See Latta,</i> 521 F.2d at 254-59 (Hufstedler, J., dissenting).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn17\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17_ref\">17</a>\n        <p> A state's assertion that it maintains legal custody of its parolees thus has limited impact on Fourth Amendment protections. The dissent's failure to recognize this shows only that our learned colleague has been bewitched by the California Penal Code and the California Supreme Court at the expense of the supremacy of the federal Constitution. The misguided urge to treat California's assertion of legal custody as dispositive, and on that basis to equate parole with prison, reappears throughout the dissent<i>See, e.g., post</i> at 724 (citing the custody provisions of CAL.

In the face of unequivocal instruction from the Supreme Court &#8212; and our own court sitting en banc &#8212; that parole and imprisonment are to be sharply distinguished in this context, the dissent incorrectly clings to a model of parole that the federal courts long ago disavowed.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn18\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18_ref\">18</a>\n        <p> The government contends that a parole search becomes reasonable when conducted pursuant to a compulsory \"Fourth Waiver\" condition, because the condition notifies the parolee of the possibility of suspicionless searches, and therefore nullifies a parolee's otherwise legitimate expectation of privacy in his own home.

The \"probable cause\" in question involved probable cause to believe that Crawford committed the two-year-old crime, not individualized suspicion that a search might disclose evidence of wrongdoing. The transcript of the district court hearing contains the following dialogue:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: And so it is clear from this record, jumps off the page, that [the parole search] was utilized for the purpose of setting the scene in order to get Mr. Crawford to admit his involvement ... because, up to that point in time, they did not have any evidence sufficient to establish even probable cause to believe that he had committed the robbery in question....</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT: Well, ... we know that they certainly didn't want to disclose their evidence, but they had probable cause.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">COUNSEL: I understand that, but I was prevented from going into that.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT: No, no, no. I just mean on the state of the record &#8212;</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">COUNSEL: All right. I will &#8212; I will concede that particular point, but I think that the inference is quite clear that they didn't believe that they had sufficient testimony...</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">This excerpt reveals only that defense counsel was willing to assume, for purposes of argument, that there may have been \"probable cause\" to believe that Crawford had been involved in the old robbery. Even that assumption is substantially undermined, however, by Bowdich's own uncontroverted testimony that the officials did not seek a warrant for Crawford's arrest at the time of the parole search because \"[w]e didn't have anything over him....\"</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">In any event, probable cause to believe that Crawford had participated in a bank robbery two and one half years earlier would not have justified a <i>search</i> of his residence. The individualized suspicion that is required to render a search reasonable is suspicion that the search may uncover evidence relating to a crime. As discussed <i>supra,</i> the record clearly reflects that the officers had no reasonable suspicion that a search of Crawford's home would disclose any such evidence.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn29\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29_ref\">29</a>\n        <p> Although federal law governs our holding that the parole search in this case did not comply with the requirements of the Fourth Amendment, the dissent proclaims that we may not properly issue our opinion without California's participation in the case<i>See post</i> at 736-737. The dissent cites 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2403(b) and FED. R. APP. PRO. 44, both of which apply only to constitutional challenges to state statutes. <i>Id.</i> Here, of course, we do not even construe, much less question the constitutionality of, any state statute. Moreover, California's interests in conducting parole searches, and its legal position regarding the searches, are fully explained in the record on appeal and in decisions of the California Supreme Court, including <i>People v. Reyes,</i> 19 Cal.4th 743, 80 Cal.Rptr.2d 734, 968 P.2d 445 (1998).

Rather, the government claims only that Crawford, like all parolees, consented in advance and in blanket fashion to otherwise unlawful searches when he signed the \"Fourth Waiver\" condition</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The government cites a string of California cases to support its consent theory. However, we again note that federal law governs the standard for a valid consent to search under the Fourth Amendment. <i>See Ooley,</i> 116 F.3d at 372; <i>Davis,</i> 932 F.2d at 758.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn31\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn31_ref\">31</a>\n        <p> The dissent harshly criticizes our alleged misrepresentation of the nature of the \"Fourth Waiver\" condition as a consensual waiver rather than as a mandatory rule governing all parolees<i>See post</i> at 724-725. We intend no such deceit and offer no such erroneous characterization. <i>See supra</i> note 1. We acknowledge that the record does not show that California has chosen to construe its parole condition as a waiver, and we do not intimate that it would do so. Nor does it matter how California characterizes the condition. We fully agree with the dissent that \"consent and waiver cannot be used to validate [mandatory] parole conditions,\" <i>post</i> at 725; as we explain <i>infra,</i> no construction of the condition as a purported \"waiver\" or demonstration of \"consent\" will allow California to accomplish indirectly what it may not accomplish directly.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Rather, we address (and dispose of) the argument that the \"Fourth Waiver\" condition functions as a blanket consent to search because that argument has been pressed upon us by the federal government in an effort to preserve the California practice. It would in our view be inappropriate simply to ignore the argument or to dismiss it summarily. Nevertheless, it should be plain that the government's consent theory hardly lies at the heart of our opinion. The theory is merely an additional argument that we must confront once we decide the principal question and hold that reasonable suspicion is required to search the home of a parolee subject to a parole condition. It is only because of the government's additional assertion that the condition constitutes valid consent eliminating all Fourth Amendment protection, that we are required to hold not only that the Fourth Amendment prevents the state from <i>imposing</i> a suspicionless search upon parolees in the home, but that a state is also precluded from conducting such a search on the ground that the parolee's signature on a mandatory parole condition waives his Fourth Amendment rights.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn32\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32_ref\">32</a>\n        <p> Our decision does not render the \"Fourth Waiver\" parole condition a nullity.

Indeed, his ability to consult with an attorney was the \"crucial factor in th[e] case,\" and the principal reason no taint was found. <i>Id.</i></p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn34\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn34_ref\">34</a>\n        <p> In 2000, a reasonable officer should have known that searches conducted for ordinary law enforcement purposes rather than purposes related to parole or probation were illegal under more than three decades of consistent Ninth Circuit precedent<i>See cases cited in Ooley,</i> 116 F.3d at 372. The fact that this distinction was subsequently discarded, <i>see Knights,</i> 534 U.S. at 121, 122 S.Ct. 587, does not render the officer's disregard of existing law any less flagrant.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn35\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn35_ref\">35</a>\n        <p> Several of our attenuation cases have suggested that \"flagrancy\" refers to the aggressive and frightening manner in which a search is conducted<i>See, e.g., George,</i> 883 F.2d at 1416 (holding that \"rushing into [the defendant's] apartment, with guns drawn\" weighs in favor of suppression); <i>Delgadillo-Velasquez,</i> 856 F.2d at 1300 (holding that an arrest calculated to cause surprise, fright, and confusion weighs in favor of suppressing a later confession). However, the finding that officers engaged in a \"flagrant\" illegal search can also refer to the degree to which searching officials intentionally overstepped the law. In both cases, looking to the flagrancy of the search suits the purposes of the taint analysis. The former bears on the likelihood that the evidence in question was flushed out by the illegal search, and therefore the degree to which the evidence would impugn judicial integrity if admitted; the latter bears on the need for increased deterrence. In either circumstance, a finding of flagrancy weighs in favor of suppressing the evidence in question.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn36\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn36_ref\">36</a>\n        <p> To persuade its readers that the preservation of individual rights is too costly, and that liberty must generally yield to security, the dissent deploys a bogeyman wholly unconnected to the case at hand.

Three months later, he abducted from her bedroom, sexually assaulted, and eventually strangled to death twelve-year-old Polly Klaas. Richard Allen Davis's vicious murder of Polly Klaas became the catalyst for Proposition 184, the \"fastest qualifying initiative in California history.\" <i>Ewing v. California,</i> 538 U.S. ___, 123 S.Ct. 1179, 155 L.Ed.2d 108 (2003). Hand in hand with Assembly Bill 971, Proposition 184 established a life sentence for specified felons in California who accumulate over time three felonies of a certain kind. The purpose of the law is \"to protect the public safety by providing lengthy prison terms for habitual felons.\" <i>Id.</i> at ___, 123 S.Ct. 1179. The fact that these \"three strikes\" criminals are eligible for parole, <i>id.,</i> makes Proposition 184 relevant to our understanding of Crawford's constitutional argument.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1\" id=\"fn1-1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question in this case is whether it is \"unreasonable\" in constitutional terms for California to subject convicted criminals like Richard Allen Davis while on parole to searches conducted by authorized law enforcement officers, so long as those searches are not \"arbitrary, capricious, or harassing.\" A related question is whether society is prepared to accept as \"reasonable\" a specific privacy right on the part of parolees against non-arbitrary, non-capricious, and non-harassing searches of their persons and abodes by officers lawfully authorized and commissioned by California to ensure that its parolees do not constitute a risk to public safety as they make the transition from prison to free society.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because my answer to both questions is emphatically \"no,\" I respectfully dissent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* On January 18, 1989, Raphyal Crawford was convicted in federal court of conspiracy to manufacture and distribute cocaine base. He was sentenced to federal prison for 87 months. While on supervised release from this conviction, he was arrested and charged in state court in San Diego, California, with possession of a firearm by a felon and possession of marijuana for sale. He was convicted of these crimes and sentenced to state prison. In addition, his federal supervised release was revoked. As it turns out, he also committed an armed robbery of a bank while on supervised release, but this crime was not discovered until later. Based on his extensive record, Crawford clearly constitutes a risk to public safety.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eventually, Crawford became a California state parolee. In this capacity, California law impressed on him a legal status that materially altered his relationship with the Fourth Amendment and its warrant requirement. California law on this subject is clear: \"Prisoners on parole shall remain under the legal custody of the department [of corrections] and shall be subject at any time to be taken back within the inclosure of the prison.\" Cal. Pen. Code &#167; 3056. As the district court correctly understood &#8212; before it became distracted by our mistaken decision in <i>United States v. Knights,</i> 219 F.3d 1138 (9th Cir.2000), since overturned by the Supreme Court in <i>United States v. Knights,</i> 534 U.S. 112, 122 S.Ct. 587, 151 L.Ed.2d 497 (2001) &#8212; \"[U]nder California law, a parolee is in fact in the custody of the Department of Corrections....\" <i>See Latta v. Fitzharris,</i> 521 F.2d 246 (9th Cir.1975) (en banc) (\"A California parolee is in a different position from that of an ordinary citizen.\" He is still serving his sentence.).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before continuing to discuss the legal ramifications of parole status in California, however, I must discuss a serious error that Judge Reinhardt has allowed to infect his opinion. It is a conceptual mistake to consider the imposition of conditions on a parolee as a \"waiver\" of rights. As Crawford's state parole officer correctly explained when confronted in district court by the federal prosecutor with this misleading characterization, \"I do not call them a `Fourth waiver'... my understanding of the Fourth waiver applies to probationers in the county.\" This single sentence &#8212; spoken by the only state official to make an appearance in this case &#8212; speaks volumes to anyone familiar with California criminal law and procedure, but it apparently went over the heads of the federal authorities, and the prosecutor's mistake has fouled up the resolution of this case ever since. In fact, California's Administrative Code says, \"The parole conditions are not a contract but are the specific rules governing all parolees whether or not the parolee has signed the form containing the parole conditions.\" Cal.Code. Regs. tit. 15, &#167; 2512(a). As the California Supreme Court has recognized:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The consent exception to the warrant requirement may not be invoked to validate the search of an adult parolee because under the Determinate Sentencing Act of 1976, parole is not a matter of choice. The Board of Prison Terms must provide a period of parole; the prisoner must accept it. (Pen.Code &#167; 3000 et seq.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>People v. Reyes,</i> 19 Cal.4th 743, 80 Cal. Rptr.2d 734, 968 P.2d 445, 448 (1998). What this explanation obviously means is that consent and waiver cannot be used to validate parole conditions, and neither can the lack thereof be used to invalidate them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This error, of course, did not originate with Judge Reinhardt. As far as I can tell from the record, the federal prosecutors and agents with whom it originated do not fully understand California law and persist to this day in calling parole conditions \"Fourth waivers.\" To quote Assistant United State's Attorney Hobson's exchange in the district court with her witness FBI Agent Bowdich, \"Now you called it a Fourth waiver. What are you referring to? What is it?\" Bowdich's answer was, \"It's a common term ... under the state parole or probation system.... Fourth waiver just means they're waiving their right to search and seizure.\" Wrong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In summary, the consent/waiver doctrine is irrelevant in this context. Thus, I conclude that the majority's willingness to entertain the Federal Government's disorientation on this issue is no more than knowingly allowing, tongue-in-cheek, a strawman to walk onto the chopping block so it can be hacked to death. The assertion that the consent argument is being answered in terms of consent jurisprudence \"just because the government raises it\" is too cute by half. We have no business \"adopting the government's preferred nomenclature\" that is wrong and analytically misleading. Scotch tape is not Scotch liquor just because the federal government says it is. Before we start branding anything as unconstitutional, at the very least we should have a <i>clear</i> picture of what we are assessing. So should have the federal prosecutor before attempting to defend it as a waiver of Fourth Amendment rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">California law provides that \"The Board of Prison Terms upon granting any parole to any prisoner may also impose on the parole any conditions that it may deem proper.\" Cal. Pen.Code &#167; 3053(a). Consequently, and according to the law, certain conditions were imposed on Crawford in connection with his release on parole in the year 2000. When Crawford was released on parole, whether he liked it or not, and whether he consented to it or not, he became subject to a search and seizure condition of parole that (1) recognized his status as still in custody, and (2) was designed to effectuate supervision of him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In recognition of Crawford's status, the Department of Corrections first imposed these standard conditions on him on October 13, 1999.

As State Parole Agent Berner explained in his testimony, \"I &#8212; when I have them initial the section (a) and (b) up above, I inform them that their residence and property under their control can be searched by a peace officer at any time.\" And, as Crawford told the district court in sworn testimony regarding parole officer Berner's advice to him that as a parolee he was subject to searches, \"I just, you know, just took that for granted that, you know, I'm on parole, that I don't have no rights at all.\" Thus, I conclude that Crawford had no subjective expectation of privacy whatsoever. Given the controlling laws, the appearance of the word \"agree\" under subsection (b) in Crawford's acknowledgment is essentially no more than acknowledgment of the force of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>In Reyes,</i> the California Supreme Court authoritatively explained the status of a parolee under California law and held that \"[w]hen <i>involuntary search conditions are properly imposed,</i> reasonable suspicion is no longer a prerequisite to conducting a search of the subject's person or property.\" 19 Cal.4th at 752, 80 Cal.Rptr.2d at 739, 968 P.2d at 450 (emphasis added). The court said in justification of its holding that \"[t]he state has a duty ... to protect the public, and the importance of [this interest] justifies the imposition of a warrantless search condition.\" <i>Id.</i> at 752, 80 Cal.Rptr.2d at 739, 968 P.2d at 450. The court held also that \"[b]ecause of society's interest both in assuring the parolee corrects his behavior and in protecting its citizens against dangerous criminals, a search pursuant to a parole condition, without reasonable suspicion, does not `intrude on a <i>reasonable</i> expectation of privacy, that is, an expectation that society is willing to recognize as legitimate.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 751, 80 Cal.Rptr.2d at 738, 968 P.2d at 449 (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court made it clear, however, that it was not declaring an unfettered open-season on parolees. In keeping with the principle that the permissible degree of impingement on a parolee's privacy is \"not unlimited,\" <i>Griffin v. Wisconsin,</i> 483 U.S. 868, 875, 107 S.Ct. 3164, 97 L.Ed.2d 709 (1987), the <i>Reyes</i> court established as a requirement of a reasonable parole condition search that it must <i>not</i> be \"arbitrary, capricious, or harassing.\" <i>Reyes,</i> 19 Cal.4th at 752, 80 Cal.Rptr.2d at 749, 968 P.2d at 450. It is equally noteworthy that California \"parolees are entitled to the benefit of the rule of announcement necessary to perfect a law enforcement officer's entry into a house.\" <i>Latta,</i> 521 F.2d at 248 (citing <i>People v. Rosales,</i> 68 Cal.2d 299, 66 Cal.Rptr. 1, 437 P.2d 489 (1968).).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of its well-reasoned analysis and logical conclusions, the California Supreme Court drew from and respected relevant federal constitutional law as articulated by the Supreme Court. From <i>Griffin,</i> the California court understood in connection with its own system of parole that a \"[s]tates operation of a probation system, like its operation of a ... prison... presents `special needs' beyond normal law enforcement....\" <i>Id.</i> at 748, 80 Cal.Rptr.2d at 736, 968 P.2d at 447(quoting <i>Griffin,</i> 483 U.S. at 873-74, 107 S.Ct. 3164). It then noted that \"although `some question of individualized suspicion is usually a prerequisite to a constitutional search or seizure[,] ... the Fourth Amendment imposes no irreducible requirement of such suspicion'\" <i>Id.</i> at 751, 80 Cal.Rptr.2d at 738, 968 P.2d at 449 (quoting <i>New Jersey v. T.L.O.,</i> 469 U.S. 325, 342, n. 8, 105 S.Ct. 733, 83 L.Ed.2d 720 (1985)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the court surveyed the United States Supreme Court's \"special needs\" cases. These cases involve hundreds of thousands of American citizens never convicted of a crime, and with respect to whom no suspicion of criminal behavior existed, and who have become subject to carefully <i>targeted</i> and narrowly tailored Fourth Amendment searches because, given the totality of the relevant circumstances, the searches when scrutinized through the lens of the Fourth Amendment are reasonable. With these cases in mind, the court concluded &#8212; correctly in my view &#8212; that parolees as a class are different, and that they have forfeited any right to challenge a proper parole search conducted by designated law enforcement authorities while still in constructive custody as they serve out their sentences and make the transition back into society under the regulatory control of the Department of Corrections.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to <i>Ferguson v. City of Charleston,</i> 532 U.S. 67, 74 n. 7, 121 S.Ct. 1281, 149 L.Ed.2d 205 (2001), the term \"special needs\" as used in <i>Griffin</i> and applied in <i>Reyes</i> made its first appearance in Fourth Amendment jurisprudence in Justice Blackmun's concurring opinion in <i>T.L.O.,</i> which upheld a marijuana-yielding warrantless search by school officials of a high school student's purse. As originally explained by Justice Blackmun in a passage later adopted by the full Court, the \"special needs\" category creates an exception to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement for searches conducted under categorical circumstances \"beyond the normal need for law enforcement\" that make the warrant and probable cause requirement \"impracticable.\" <i>T.L.O.,</i> 469 U.S. at 351, 105 S.Ct. 733 (Blackmun, J., concurring); <i>Griffin,</i> 483 U.S. at 873, 107 S.Ct. 3164.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsequent Supreme Court cases give us additional guidance as to how to determine whether a public safety search falls into the \"special needs\" category.

Here, too, the answer is in the affirmative. As in the case of the supervision of probationers, supervision as described in <i>Reyes</i> is designed to assume that parole serves (1) as a period of genuine rehabilitation and reintegration into society, and (2) as a device to see to it that \"the community is not harmed by the [parolee's] being at large.\" <i>Griffin,</i> 483 U.S. at 875, 107 S.Ct. 3164. <i>Griffin</i> recognized in connection with felons on probation that \"[r]ecent research suggests that more intensive supervision can reduce recidivism....\" <i>Id.</i> I see no reason why this observation would fail to apply to parolees.

(Aug 2002). Of that population, 126, 117 inmates were released on parole during that year. <i>Id.</i> Sadly, of that figure, 90,000 were returned to prison, either following a conviction of a new crime or for a technical violation of parole. <i>Id.</i> According to the California Policy Research Center, \"70% of the state's paroled felons reoffend within 18 months &#8212; the highest recidivism rate in the nation.\" Joan Petersilia, <i>Challenges of Prisoner Reentry and Parole in California,</i> 12 CPRC (June 2000).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1\" id=\"fn2-1_ref\">2</a> Crawford and Richard Allen Davis are only two of the State's paroled felons who reoffended.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p125\">\n      <span class=\"num\">125</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find a similar pattern of continuing criminality by parolees when we look at Federal statistics.

In this eye-opening work, which resulted from fifteen years of concentrated research, the doctors report on the incidence of crime committed by the subjects they studied. The doctors tell us that each of these men with whom they worked \"admits to having committed enough crimes to spend over 1,500 years in jail if he were convicted for all of them.\" 1 Samuel Yochelson and Stanton Samenow, <i>The Criminal Personality</i> 221. The doctors continue: \"If we were to calculate the total number of crimes committed by all the men with whom we have worked, it would be astronomic. However, that is not represented in crime statistics.... If one were to judge by official police records, he would be totally mislead about the extent of criminal activity.\" <i>Id.</i> To make this point, the doctors arrayed the startling criminal activity of their three representative subjects. The first had committed 64,000 crimes, but apprehended only seven times. <i>Id.</i> at 222. The second was responsible for 200,000 crimes. <i>Id.</i> at 223.

Another molested about 1,000 children per year when he was between 17 and 22, for a total of at least 5,000 acts, and was apprehended for only one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p131\">\n      <span class=\"num\">131</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 221-225.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p132\">\n      <span class=\"num\">132</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the Supreme Court's opinion in <i>Ewing,</i> a study by the <i>Sacramento Bee</i> of 223 habitual criminal offenders in California found that they had an aggregate of 1,165 prior felonies, an average of 5 apiece.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p133\">\n      <span class=\"num\">133</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prior convictions included 322 robberies and 262 burglaries.

In all, they were responsible for 17 homicides, 7 attempted slayings, and 91 sexual assaults and child molestations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p134\">\n      <span class=\"num\">134</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Ewing,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 123 S.Ct. 1179, 155 L.Ed.2d 108.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p135\">\n      <span class=\"num\">135</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I deduce from this information, as well as from California's legislative findings, that the control and supervision of parolees as they reintegrate into society involves an arena far different from the needs of \"normal\" law enforcement. Parolees, like drunk drivers on our highways, are a discrete group that are a demonstrable menace to the safety of the communities into which they are discharged. <i>See Mich. Dept. of State Police v. Sitz,</i> 496 U.S. 444, 451, 110 S.Ct. 2481, 110 L.Ed.2d 412 (1990) (\"No one can seriously dispute the magnitude of the drunken driving problem or the States' interest in eradicating it.\"). Parolees have demonstrated by their adjudicated criminal conduct a capacity and willingness to commit crimes serious enough to deprive them of liberty. They have not yet finished serving their sentences in connection with which they do not enjoy a presumption of innocence. Moreover, their collective behavior while on parole demonstrates the truth of the axiom that past behavior is the best predictor of future behavior. Thus, I conclude that the supervision of the members of this rationally identified group is a \"special need\" of California that transcends the scope of normal, everyday law enforcement concerns. Parole is first and foremost about supervising and controlling people who have demonstrated a propensity to break the law and for whom the State still has a responsibility to constrain and to mentor in connection with public safety. Like Alaska's version of \"Megan's Law\" involving the registration of sex offenders and the publication of information about them on the Internet, legislation approved by the Supreme Court in <i>Smith v. Doe,</i> 538 U.S. ___, 123 S.Ct. 1140, 155 L.Ed.2d 164 (2003), the purpose here is not punitive, but to enable state government in the context of a 4135 regulatory scheme to enhance public safety. <i>Id.</i> at ___, 123 S.Ct. 1140 (\"As the [Ninth Circuit] Court of Appeals acknowledged, the Act has a legitimate nonpunitive purpose of `public safety' which is advanced by alerting the public to the risk of sex offenders in their community.'\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p136\">\n      <span class=\"num\">136</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third question posed by <i>Griffin</i> is whether the \"`special needs' of its parole system justify [California's] search regulation as it has been interpreted by state corrections officials and state court.\" 483 U.S. at 875, 107 S.Ct. 3164. With <i>Reyes</i> in mind as well as the magnitude of the challenge, I think it is clear that the special needs of California's parole system make the warrant requirement impracticable. I conclude also that given all the relevant facts and circumstances, California's parolee search conditions are eminently reasonable. The statistics previously described leave no room for doubt that crime by parolees is a huge problem in California that demands government attention and action &#8212; one must look no further than Crawford and Richard Allen Davis. As in the case of the probation searches approved in <i>Griffin,</i> a warrant requirement would interfere with the parole system of supervision, \"setting up a magistrate rather than [the parole agent] as the judge of how close a supervision [the parolee] requires.\" <i>Id.</i> at 876, 107 S.Ct. 3164. <i>See also Latta,</i> 521 F.2d at 251-52 (dismissing the warrant requirement in this context as unreasonable). In addition, the delay inherent in obtaining a warrant would (1) hamper quick responses to evidence of misconduct, and (2) reduce the deterrent effect of the conditions. <i>Id.</i> Furthermore, the rules that normally pertain to the quantity and quality of information needed to secure a warrant are at odds with the essence and needs of the parole system. Again, as in the case of probation, \"The agency ... must be able to proceed on the basis of its entire experience with [the parolee], and to assess probabilities in the light of its knowledge of his life, character, and circumstances.\" <i>Id.</i> at 879, 107 S.Ct. 3164.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p137\">\n      <span class=\"num\">137</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the Supreme Court has not reached the question of whether a plenary search condition applicable to a parolee under California law so diminishes that persons expectation of privacy that a proper parole condition search is \"reasonable,\" its decision in <i>Knights</i> supports the California Supreme Court's conclusion. The <i>Knights</i> Court reminded us that \"[t]he touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is reasonableness, and the reasonableness of a search is determined `by assessing, on the one hand, the degree to which it intrudes upon an individual's privacy and, on the other, the degree to which it is needed for the promotion of legitimate governmental interests.'\" 534 U.S. at 118-19, 122 S.Ct. 587(quoting <i>Wyoming v. Houghton,</i> 526 U.S. 295, 300, 119 S.Ct. 1297, 143 L.Ed.2d 408 (1999)). In concluding that probationers have a reduced expectation of privacy, the Court relied on the need to \"protect[] society from future criminal violations.\" <i>Id.</i> at 119, 122 S.Ct. 587. This observation has even greater force when applied to parolees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p138\">\n      <span class=\"num\">138</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, <i>Griffin</i> postulates that although a parolee's right of privacy is definitely diminished as compared to the public at large, the \"permissible degree\" of such impingement \"is not unlimited.\" <i>Griffin</i> 483 U.S. at 875, 107 S.Ct. 3164. As I see it, the law in California adequately satisfies this check. When read in the light of <i>Reyes,</i> California's parole search conditions do not wholly eliminate a parolee's expectation or right of privacy. To the contrary, they authorize only narrowly tailored searches by a class of authorized officials rationally related to the individual's parole status. More importantly, according to <i>Reyes,</i> a parolee in California retains a right of privacy against government searches that are arbitrary, a right of privacy against searches that are capricious, and a right of privacy against searches that are harassing. These restrictions are meaningful, and they represent workable standards state and federal courts apply every day in assessing the propriety of a variety of government actions. These qualifications accomplish the constitutional goal of keeping parole searches within the scope of reason demanded by the Constitution by mandating that the search be justifiably within the purpose of parole conditions at issue. <i>See also Latta,</i> 521 F.2d at 252 (\"In a given case, what is done may be so unreasonable as to require that the search be held to violate the Fourth Amendment. For example, harassment or intimidation is no part of a parole officer's job.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p139\">\n      <span class=\"num\">139</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the Due Process Clause provides additional protection to parolees subject to parole condition searches. Should the manner in which such a search was conducted (1) \"shock the conscience\" of our community's sense of \"decency and fairness,\" or (2) was so \"brutal\" and \"offensive\" that it did not comport with traditional ideas of fair play and decency, then both the exclusionary rule as well as 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 would provide both remedy and redress. <i>See Rochin v. California,</i> 342 U.S. 165, 172, 72 S.Ct. 205, 96 L.Ed. 183 (1952). Just as the extraction by a physician of a blood sample from an unconscious driver suspected of vehicular manslaughter &#8212; or from a railroad worker or a Customs official &#8212; does not offend these concepts, <i>Breithaupt v. Abram,</i> 352 U.S. 432, 435-36, 77 S.Ct. 408, 1 L.Ed.2d 448 (1957), neither does a California parole condition search bridled by <i>Reyes.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p140\">\n      <span class=\"num\">140</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case is a good example of a search that was not arbitrary, not capricious, and not conducted to harass or to intimidate.

In <i>Edmond,</i> the Supreme Court declined to confer \"special needs\" status on city-operated vehicle checkpoints established for the purpose of interdicting unlawful drugs.

Similarly, in <i>Ferguson,</i> the Court disapproved of a combined hospital, police, and public policy to test pregnant patients for evidence of drug use and to turn over positive results to the police for prosecution. 532 U.S. at 69-73, 85-86, 121 S.Ct. 1281. The basis for the Court's determination was that the purpose of this program was \"indistinguishable from the general interest in crime control.\" <i>Id.</i> at 81, 121 S.Ct. 1281 (quoting <i>Edmond,</i> 531 U.S. at 44, 121 S.Ct. 447).

United States,</i> 389 U.S. 347, 351, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p154\">\n      <span class=\"num\">154</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Katz,</i> the Court rejected the idea that there is such a \"concept as a `constitutionally protected area' that can serve as a talismanic solution to every Fourth Amendment problem.\" <i>Id.</i> at 351, n. 9, 88 S.Ct. 507. In fact, although the Court recognized that a private home has been acknowledged to be a constitutionally protected area, the Court cautioned against a rigid analytical reliance on this principle. Saying that the \"effort to decide whether or not a given `area,' viewed in the abstract, is `constitutionally protected' deflects attention from the problem presented in this case.\" <i>Id.</i> at 351, 88 S.Ct. 507. I certainly acknowledge the constitutional protection usually afforded to a person in that person's home. On the other hand, with the idea in mind that the Fourth Amendment protects people, not places, and given Crawford's different status, I believe it is appropriate to give his lair far less protection than it would ordinarily attain. It is the status of the <i>person</i> that determines the privacy to which the person is entitled even in that person's residence. <i>Knights</i> fully supports this idea. Moreover, bodily fluids would seem to be on a par with homes, and the Court has had no problem including bodily fluid searches within the \"special needs\" category.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p155\">\n      <span class=\"num\">155</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What is important also to recognize from these cases is that the classes involved in them did not find their privacy rights \"wholly eliminated,\" just altered discretely and rationally to accommodate compelling public needs. That is exactly what California has done to parolees vis a vis parole searches.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p156\">\n      <span class=\"num\">156</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From all of the above, I conclude that Crawford's statements to law enforcement officials were not the fruit of any illegal search or detention. I conclude also that the conduct of the officers was, as required by <i>Latta,</i> demonstrably reasonable under the \"totality of the circumstances.\" <i>Knights,</i> 534 U.S. at 118, 122 S.Ct. 587; <i>Latta,</i> 521 F.2d at 250(A parolee and his home are subject to search by the parole officer when the officer reasonably believes that such search is necessary in the performance of his duties). <i>See also Rise v. Oregon,</i> 59 F.3d 1556 (9th Cir.1995) (Oregon statute requiring felons convicted of murder or specific sexual offenses to submit blood sample for DNA bank is reasonable and therefore does not violate the Fourth Amendment); <i>Russell v. Gregoire,</i> 124 F.3d 1079 (9th Cir.1997) (convicted sex offenders have no right of privacy preventing the state from requiring them to register as such and be subject to community notification of their residences). The purpose of the encounter, approved by Crawford's parole agent and well-within the scope of the applicable parole conditions, was not to harass or to annoy, but to investigate an armed robbery where Crawford had been identified by a co-conspirator as a participant who carried a firearm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p157\">\n      <span class=\"num\">157</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Attenuation is irrelevant. In sum, I would affirm Crawford's conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VI</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p158\">\n      <span class=\"num\">158</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What the majority opinion in this case does is far more serious than simply freeing a dangerous bank robber from federal prison. The opinion effectively holds unconstitutional a fundamental aspect of California's statutory parole system and laws. I quote to make this point from the opinion:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p159\">\n      <span class=\"num\">159</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, if the mandatory parole condition were deemed to be a valid blanket consent, any constitutional protection for parolees would be rendered illusory &#8212; every state could force its parolees to sign the blanket waiver as a condition of parole, and every parolee's constitutional rights would thereby instantly vanish. Indeed, under the government's theory, all parolees could be forced to waive all constitutional rights, including the right to due process in revocation proceedings, or even the right to trial on any new offense allegedly committed during the parole period. We hold that parolees may not generally be forced as a threshold condition of their parole to surrender by blanket waiver their Fourth Amendment rights, including those so recently recognized by <i>Knights.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p160\">\n      <span class=\"num\">160</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even though this passage is hopelessly confused in viewing this issue as one of consent and forced waivers, it blows an ill wind for California. We may have just thrown open the habeas gates to a flood of petitions, disabled electronic monitoring, crippled DNA banks, and who knows what else. Only the Richard Allen Davises of the underworld will herald this unsettling result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p161\">\n      <span class=\"num\">161</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not only is this opinion on the wrong track in its analysis and dead wrong on the merits, but it has accomplished this drastic result in a case where representatives of the California Attorney General have not appeared or been heard from to represent that State's interests. As far as I can tell, they do not even know of the existence of this case. Instead, we have had to rely on federal prosecutors who inexplicably do not appear to grasp the essence of the relevant California law. At the very least, federal law and respect for California compels us to invite California's Attorney General to intervene in this case, and, at a minimum, to file an amicus brief pursuant to F.R.A.P. 29 and to augment the record before we inflict such damage on California law and overturn the will of its Legislature as construed by the California Supreme Court. 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2403(b) reads:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p162\">\n      <span class=\"num\">162</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) In any action, suit, or proceeding in a court of the United States to which a State or any agency, officer, or employee thereof is not a party, wherein the constitutionality of any statute of that State affecting the public interest is drawn in question, the court shall certify such fact to the attorney general of the State, and shall permit the State to intervene for presentation of evidence, if evidence is otherwise admissible in the case, and for argument on the question of constitutionality.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p163\">\n      <span class=\"num\">163</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, Rule 44 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure contains the same requirement:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p164\">\n      <span class=\"num\">164</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) Constitutional Challenge to State Statute. If a party questions the constitutionality of a statute of a State in a proceeding in which that State or its agency, officer, or employee is not a party in an official capacity, the questioning party must give written notice to the circuit clerk immediately upon the filing of the record or as soon as the question is raised in the court of appeals. The clerk must then certify that fact to the attorney general of the State.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p165\">\n      <span class=\"num\">165</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With all respect to my colleagues, their studied refusal to accede to my request to allow California to appear in this case before we issue our opinion is distressing. We have violated the spirit of the law by excluding the sovereign entity most affected by this decision. As the Supreme Court said in <i>Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona,</i> 520 U.S. 43, 74, 117 S.Ct. 1055, 137 L.Ed.2d 170 (1997), \"the Attorney General had, at a minimum, a right secured by Congress, a right to present argument on appeal' on the question of constitutionality.'\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p166\">\n      <span class=\"num\">166</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I would hope that California would get wind of what this panel has done. The United States Attorneys Office should notify its state counterparts of this decision without delay. Thus, I file this dissent with the hope that this is not the end, but the beginning of the proper resolution of this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p167\">\n      <span class=\"num\">167</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">California's legislative decision to subject prison parolees to stringent supervision including searches was patently reasonable. As limited by the California Supreme Court in <i>Reyes,</i> and the Due Process Clause, these searches conform to the demands of the Fourth Amendment. Moreover, California's decision not to recognize a privacy right on the part of convicted felons to defeat these searches is rational and clearly not arbitrary, not capricious, not harassing, and not punitive. Crawford subjectively did not have any expectation of privacy in his residence, and any such objective expectation that any parolee might have had would not be \"one that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable.\" <i>Bond v. United States,</i> 529 U.S. 334, 338, 120 S.Ct. 1462, 146 L.Ed.2d 365 (2000) (quoting <i>Smith v. Maryland,</i> 442 U.S. 735, 99 S.Ct. 2577, 61 L.Ed.2d 220 (1979)). The test reiterated by the Supreme Court in <i>Minnesota v. Carter,</i> 525 U.S. 83, 88, 119 S.Ct. 469, 142 L.Ed.2d 373 (1998) is that \"in order to claim the protection of the Fourth Amendment, a defendant must demonstrate that he personally has an expectation of privacy in the place searched, and that his expectation... is one that has a source ... recognized and permitted by society.\" <i>Id.</i> at 83, 119 S.Ct. at 470. Crawford's case fails this test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p168\">\n      <span class=\"num\">168</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sirhan Sirhan shot and killed Senator Robert F. Kennedy in 1968 while Senator Kennedy was a candidate for the Presidency of the United States. Sirhan was convicted of murder and is serving a life sentence in prison in California. He is eligible for parole. If he is released on parole, it does not seem reasonable to exempt him from parole searches until someone has a suspicion that he has broken the law again. The same holds true for all three strikes felons imprisoned in California.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p169\">\n      <span class=\"num\">169</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One would think that if the Constitution permits life sentences for career criminals, <i>see Ewing,</i> and the \"Megan's Law\" posting on the Internet of the neighborhood addresses of registered sex offenders, <i>see Smith v. Doe,</i> 538 U.S. ___, 123 S.Ct. 1140, 155 L.Ed.2d 164 (2003), it would not be unreasonable for a state to keep a tight rein on parolees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p170\">\n      <span class=\"num\">170</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I would affirm Crawford's conviction and sentence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3-1\" id=\"fn3-1_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Although it is customary and generally appropriate to decide these issues in abstract and legal terms, I find it useful when deciding whether something is \"unreasonable\" to have a broader understanding of it, as did the voters in California. Otherwise, one loses the human element and all the ramifications of the decision. I apologize to my colleagues if they find this offensive. I freely admit this tendency may come not only from reading Supreme Court opinions, but also from twenty-three years of talking to people whose lives were permanently ruined by violent and heartless felons</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Justices Scalia and Stevens, although concurring in the result in<i>Skinner,</i> dissented in <i>Von Raab.</i> They did so because they could not find a real problem that would be solved by urine testing of Customs service employees. Here, parole searches are at least a partial solution to the danger, as this case demonstrates. A parole search took an armed bank robber off the streets of San Diego and put him where he belongs.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3-1_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Times change. So do our reasonable expectations of privacy. While writing this opinion, I traveled to San Francisco to work. When I arrived at my hotel, I opened my suitcase and found a piece of paper that was not there when I closed my suitcase in Boise. The paper reads:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">NOTIFICATION OF BAGGAGE INSPECTION</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">To protect you and your fellow passenger, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is required by law to inspect all checked baggage. As part of this process, some bags are opened and physically inspected. You bag was among those selected for physical inspection.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">During the inspection, your bag and its contents may have been searched for prohibited items. At the completion of the inspection, the contents were returned to your bag, which was resealed with a tamper-evident seal.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">If the TSA screener was unable to open your bag for inspection because it was locked, the screener may have been forced to break the locks on your bag. TSA sincerely regrets having to do this, and has taken care to reseal your bag upon completion of inspection. However, TSA is not liable for damage to your locks resulting from this necessary security precaution.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">It would appear that post September 11, 2001, all of us who travel by air are now subject to a \"special needs\" search, even Crawford. Does this mean we have wholly lost our right of privacy? Of course not. It means only that to protect ourselves from real danger, we need to adopt reasonable procedures that will increase our security against crime.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

FED. R. CRIM. P. 11(a)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sometime in 1998, FBI Special Agent David Bowdich was assigned to investigate a series of bank robberies that occurred in San Diego in 1997 and 1998, including the February 10, 1998, robbery of a Bank of America on Ulrich Street. Approximately two years later, Bowdich received information from an unnamed source that a person known as \"Ralphie Rabbit\" was a participant in the Ulrich Street robbery. Bowdich was led to believe that \"Ralphie Rabbit\" was an alias used by Raphyal Crawford.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bowdich conducted a background investigation on Crawford and learned that Crawford was on state parole. Bowdich also learned that Crawford had signed what is commonly referred to as a \"Fourth Waiver\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> as a condition of his parole. Specifically, the \"Fourth Waiver\" document contained the following parole conditions:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">You and your residence and any property under your control may be searched without a warrant by an agent of the Department of Corrections or any law enforcement officer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">You agree to search or seizure by a parole officer or other peace officer at any time of the day or night, with or without a search warrant, and with or without cause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bowdich testified that it is a common practice for law enforcement officers to use \"Fourth Waivers\" as a \"kind of tool to talk\" to a suspect about crimes. In order to talk to Crawford about the robbery, Bowdich contacted Crawford's parole agent, Carl Berner, and obtained his permission<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> to conduct a parole search of the residence where Crawford was living with his sister.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bowdich repeatedly testified that when he conducted the parole search on July 27, 2000, he did not expect to find any evidence linking Crawford to the Ulrich Street robbery or to any other criminal conduct, although he \"hoped\" he might find something that would show that Crawford was currently engaging in criminal activity. The robbery had occurred more than two years earlier; little physical evidence from the incident remained unaccounted for; Crawford was living in a different residence at the time of the robbery; and in the interim, he had been imprisoned in another state for an unrelated offense. Under these circumstances, Bowdich acknowledged that he did not expect the search to reveal any physical evidence of the bank robbery. Rather, he intended to use the parole search solely as a \"tool to see\" Crawford and to induce him to talk.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the early morning of July 27, Bowdich met four other law enforcement officials, including Detective Michael Gutierrez, and knocked on the door of Crawford's residence. When Crawford's sister Abdullah answered the door, Bowdich stated that the officers were there to conduct a parole search and Abdullah told them that Crawford was in the bedroom asleep with his eighteen-month-old daughter. Bowdich, Gutierrez, and at least one other officer went into the bedroom and found Crawford and his young child on the bed. Both Crawford and Gutierrez stated that the officers had their weapons drawn when they went into the bedroom.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The officers told Crawford that they were conducting a parole search, and escorted him to the living room, where he remained seated on a couch, under \"investigatory detention,\" through the course of the search. While the search was being conducted, he was not permitted to move, even to get a glass of water.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The search itself may have lasted as long as 50 minutes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> As expected, no evidence of any criminal activity was discovered. However, as planned, Bowdich used the time to initiate a conversation with Crawford. The discussion began with some \"chit chat\" that was designed \"to put Mr. Crawford at ease\" and dispel the \"meversus-you\" atmosphere. Then Bowdich told Crawford that, although he was not under arrest, he would really like him to talk about \"an old bank robbery case.\" Crawford initially stated that he did not know anything about the robbery, but Bowdich suspected that he knew more than he was letting on, and thought that Crawford would talk if he was placed in the \"right environment.\" Bowdich testified that he wanted to eliminate the distractions, bring Crawford to an area where Bowdich was in charge of the scene, and eliminate the possibility that he would end \"up in some hearing later where the defense is alleging that I've got five officers milling around, and that could be a coercive atmosphere.\" In order to make it \"as clean as possible,\" Bowdich asked Crawford whether he would be \"more comfortable\" talking to the officers at the FBI office. Crawford agreed to the suggested alternative and was escorted &#8212; with an officer on each side &#8212; to Bowdich's vehicle, which was parked outside.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Crawford was not handcuffed at any point. However, Crawford's sister testified that she assumed he was under arrest based on the length of the search, the way he was detained in the living room, and the fact that he was leaving with officers walking on both sides of him. Moreover, despite the fact that Crawford's own car was parked in front of the house, he was transported to the FBI office in Bowdich's unmarked car.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bowdich drove to the FBI offices, which were located about 20 minutes from the residence. Detective Gutierrez sat with Crawford in the back seat of the car. Bowdich and Gutierrez continued the \"chit chat\" with Crawford during the drive, as a means of putting him at ease.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After arriving at the FBI offices, Bowdich and Gutierrez took Crawford into an interview room, and closed the door \"for [] privacy.\" They then told Crawford that he was not in custody and could leave at any time. Bowdich began to read Crawford his <i>Miranda</i> rights, because he wanted to \"make the case cleaner.\" Crawford, however, interrupted in protest before Bowdich finished the second line of the warnings. Both agents again told Crawford that he was not in custody and could leave. Bowdich never completed the <i>Miranda</i> warnings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The interrogation continued for approximately an hour to an hour and a half.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> No weapons were drawn. Eventually, Crawford confessed that he was a participant in the February 10, 1998, robbery and admitted to having used a gun during the crime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 16, 2001, Crawford was indicted for armed bank robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2113(a) and (d) and for knowingly using and carrying a firearm in the commission of the robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 924(c)(1) and (2).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Crawford moved to suppress the statements that he made to the law enforcement officers on July 27. After three evidentiary hearings, the district court denied Crawford's motion on both Fourth and Fifth Amendment grounds. It specifically held that the initial detention of Crawford in his residence pursuant to the parole search was unlawful under <i>United States v. Knights,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">219</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1138</span></span> (9th Cir.2000);<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> however, under <i>Dunaway v.

Specifically, with respect to the second prong, the district court found the following intervening circumstances: (1) that Crawford was \"street savvy\" and thus must have known that the agents had found nothing in the search; (2) that Crawford was told several times that he was not under arrest and was free to leave; (3) that Crawford voluntarily chose the FBI office as the venue for the interrogation; and (4) that Crawford's interruption of the <i>Miranda</i> warnings showed his exercise of some free will.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By focusing on Crawford's state of mind rather than on intervening events, the district court misconceived the nature of the \"intervening circumstances\" analysis. The facts relied on by the district court are, like <i>Miranda</i> warnings, principally useful in determining whether a confession was voluntary for Fifth Amendment purposes. However, the determination that a statement is voluntary \"for purposes of the Fifth Amendment is merely a threshold requirement for Fourth Amendment analysis.

Nor, for the same reasons, can we find that [the defendant's] decision to speak was so independent of police pressures as to absolve the judicial system from the charge of savoring the forbidden fruits of unconstitutional conduct.

In holding that the third factor weighed in favor of attenuation, the district court credited the agents' testimony that they did not use any implied promises in their interrogation. As above, however, this type of analysis \"betrays a lingering confusion between `voluntariness' for purposes of the Fifth Amendment and the `causal connection' test established in <i>Brown.</i> Satisfying the Fifth Amendment is only the `threshold' condition of the Fourth Amendment analysis required by <i>Brown.</i>\" <i>Dunaway,</i> 442 U.S. at 219, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110096\"><a href=\"/opinion/110096/dunaway-v-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In reciting the <i>Brown</i> factors, courts usually choose a conjunctive phrasing (\"purpose <i>and</i> flagrancy\"), but the same courts then find in favor of taint if there is evidence of <i>either</i> improper purpose <i>or</i> flagrant illegality. <i>See, e.g., Taylor,</i> 457 U.S. at 693, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110760\"><a href=\"/opinion/110760/taylor-v-alabama/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In other words, the evidence that was ultimately obtained was not the mere byproduct of the search, but its primary objective. Moreover, by conducting the search solely to pressure Crawford into talking, Bowdich and his accompanying officers blatantly ignored then-existing Ninth Circuit law prohibiting \"law enforcement/investigatory\" parole searches.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn34\" id=\"fn34_ref\">34</a> <i>See supra</i> note 10. The search and detention was not questionably illegal; it was flagrantly so.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn35\" id=\"fn35_ref\">35</a> This combination calls for hornbook application of the exclusionary rule, which is designed to deter government officials from conducting illegal searches by suppressing the evidence that provoked the search. <i>See, e.g., Brown,</i> 422 U.S. at 605, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109304\"><a href=\"/opinion/109304/brown-v-illinois/\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In fact, we have found this factor \"decisive most often in those cases where [sic] police officers ... took a suspect into custody hoping that an interrogation would yield incriminating statements.\" <i>George,</i> 883 F.2d at 1416.

The government has not met its burden of showing that the taint of the search was attenuated by any of the factors articulated in <i>Brown</i> or its progeny.

CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because law enforcement officials conducted a search of Crawford's home without reasonable suspicion to believe that they would uncover evidence of criminal activity, we hold that the search violated the Fourth Amendment. The fact that Crawford signed a blanket \"Fourth Waiver\" as a mandatory condition of his parole does not serve to waive the minimum constitutional protection of reasonable suspicion to which he and other parolees are entitled. Moreover, as neither time, intervening events, nor the officers' motives purged the taint of the unconstitutional search, Crawford's subsequent statements must be suppressed. We therefore reverse the district court's denial of the motion to suppress and remand to allow Crawford to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Every court action protecting the constitutional rights of individuals evokes vigorous objections from those who foresee disastrous consequences; the comments of our learned dissenting colleague demonstrate that this opinion is no exception. Surely, law enforcement could succeed in incarcerating a greater number of dangerous individuals if we dispensed entirely with the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, or even with the Sixth. However, our Founders chose a Constitution that <i>balances</i> liberty and security, and that preserves to all individuals certain guarantees against the existence of a police state. We have sought to balance the relevant interests and thereby to honor our obligation to the Constitution.

Crawford's counsel pressed the issue, stating that he thought the \"quantum of information which was available\" to the investigators was relevant. The prosecutor replied that the information available to them was \"not relevant for determining\" the Fourth and Fifth Amendment issues. The court ultimately stated that it would assume for purposes of the motion that even though the government had information that Crawford was a participant in the robbery, there was not probable cause to arrest him<i>See infra</i> note 28. There is no evidence in the record regarding the nature or source of the information that led Bowdich to suspect Crawford. More important, Bowdich's testimony makes it clear that he had no reason to suspect that he would find evidence relating to a crime at Crawford's home, and thus had no basis other than the \"Fourth Waiver\" for the search. <i>See id.</i></p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Crawford and his sister thought that the search took about an hour, and police records indicate that the officers were in the residence from 8:20 a.m. until approximately 9:10 a.m</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> According to Crawford, he did not at first agree to leave.

Crawford stated at trial that \"I mean, I just, you know, just took for granted that, you know, I'm on parole, that I don't have no rights at all, so I didn't really say nothing.\" This resigned submission to the officials' asserted authority does not invalidate Crawford's expectation of privacy in his own home.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The second fact is Crawford's signature on the \"Fourth Waiver,\" a compulsory parole condition that purports to permit a search of his home, at any time, with or without a warrant, with or without cause. The government claims that Crawford could not have had any subjective expectation of privacy after signing the condition. As discussed in Section II.A.3, <i>infra,</i> the \"Fourth Waiver\" does not extend so far, and Crawford's signature can only be deemed to reduce his expectation of privacy to, at most, the condition's lawful limits. Moreover, although Crawford may have known that he was potentially subject to police search, this court has \"rejected the argument that a person lacks a subjective expectation of privacy simply because he ... could have expected the police to intrude on his privacy.\" <i>United States v. Sandoval,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767260\"><a href=\"/opinion/767260/united-states-v-rodrigo-sandoval/\"><span class=\"volume\">200</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">659</span></a></span>, 660 (9th Cir.2000). Indeed, consistent with the testimony of Crawford's parole officer that parolees are sometimes \"very surprised\" by searches even after signing \"Fourth Waivers,\" Crawford stated that although he knew what a parole search entailed, he was \"shocked\" when the officials invaded his home. The natural shock that Crawford felt upon being roused from his own bed by law enforcement officials with weapons drawn is not consistent with the government's contention that Crawford actually had no expectation of privacy at all.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn14\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14_ref\">14</a>\n        <p> We recognize that the California Supreme Court has apparently determined that California law does not recognize as legitimate the expectation of privacy of a parolee subject to a \"properly imposed parole search condition,\"<i>People v.

That concurring opinion correctly noted that the proper standard for a probation search falls somewhat short of probable cause but nevertheless requires specific facts that give rise to a reasonable belief that a search will produce the evidence sought. Moreover, the \"hunch\" sentence is based entirely on the proposition, first rejected in another concurrence, authored by Judge Wright, <i>see id.</i> (Wright, J., concurring), and subsequently rejected by the Supreme Court in <i>Knights, see supra</i> note 10, that parole officers have a unique knowledge of the parolee that requires that their searches be governed by a different standard than those conducted by police officers.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">None of the thirteen judges on the en banc court, however, expressed any disagreement with the conclusions stated in the excerpt quoted in the text, <i>supra,</i> except for the dissenters &#8212; who would have imposed an even stricter standard on parole searches (i.e., requiring a warrant and probable cause). <i>See Latta,</i> 521 F.2d at 254-59 (Hufstedler, J., dissenting).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn17\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17_ref\">17</a>\n        <p> A state's assertion that it maintains legal custody of its parolees thus has limited impact on Fourth Amendment protections. The dissent's failure to recognize this shows only that our learned colleague has been bewitched by the California Penal Code and the California Supreme Court at the expense of the supremacy of the federal Constitution. The misguided urge to treat California's assertion of legal custody as dispositive, and on that basis to equate parole with prison, reappears throughout the dissent<i>See, e.g., post</i> at 724 (citing the custody provisions of CAL. PEN. CODE &#167; 3056); at 724 (\"[U]nder California law, a parolee is in fact in the custody of the Department of Corrections....\"); 3161 (suggesting that the search condition was proper because Crawford was \"still in custody\"); at 728 (finding that \"parolees as a class are different\" because they are \"still in constructive custody\"); at 729 (\"Although parole restrictions and conditions strictly speaking are not prison regulations, they are akin to that category.\"); at 735 (distinguishing <i>Edmond</i> and <i>Ferguson,</i> in which the Supreme Court refused to approve suspicionless searches, in part because parolees are \"in custody and serving out prison sentences\"). In the face of unequivocal instruction from the Supreme Court &#8212; and our own court sitting en banc &#8212; that parole and imprisonment are to be sharply distinguished in this context, the dissent incorrectly clings to a model of parole that the federal courts long ago disavowed.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn18\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18_ref\">18</a>\n        <p> The government contends that a parole search becomes reasonable when conducted pursuant to a compulsory \"Fourth Waiver\" condition, because the condition notifies the parolee of the possibility of suspicionless searches, and therefore nullifies a parolee's otherwise legitimate expectation of privacy in his own home. We reject this contention. The parole condition certainly limits a parolee's expectation of privacy, but only as one \"salient circumstance.\" The Supreme Court has refused to allow this one factor to override all others<i>See</i> also note 10, <i>supra.</i></p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">We therefore reject the argument that a blanket \"Fourth Waiver\" parole condition eliminates a parolee's expectation of privacy so as to render any parole search reasonable. We address below, <i>see infra</i> section II.A.3, the different contention that the compulsory parole condition represents a parolee's consent to be subjected to otherwise unreasonable searches.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn19\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19_ref\">19</a>\n        <p> The<i>Knights</i> Court also concluded that the police need not obtain a warrant to search the home of a probationer subject to a \"Fourth Waiver\" condition. <i>See Knights,</i> 534 U.S. at 121, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118468\"><a href=\"/opinion/118468/united-states-v-knights/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The \"probable cause\" in question involved probable cause to believe that Crawford committed the two-year-old crime, not individualized suspicion that a search might disclose evidence of wrongdoing. The transcript of the district court hearing contains the following dialogue:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: And so it is clear from this record, jumps off the page, that [the parole search] was utilized for the purpose of setting the scene in order to get Mr. Crawford to admit his involvement ... because, up to that point in time, they did not have any evidence sufficient to establish even probable cause to believe that he had committed the robbery in question....</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT: Well, ... we know that they certainly didn't want to disclose their evidence, but they had probable cause.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">COUNSEL: I understand that, but I was prevented from going into that.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT: No, no, no. I just mean on the state of the record &#8212;</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">COUNSEL: All right. I will &#8212; I will concede that particular point, but I think that the inference is quite clear that they didn't believe that they had sufficient testimony...</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">This excerpt reveals only that defense counsel was willing to assume, for purposes of argument, that there may have been \"probable cause\" to believe that Crawford had been involved in the old robbery. Even that assumption is substantially undermined, however, by Bowdich's own uncontroverted testimony that the officials did not seek a warrant for Crawford's arrest at the time of the parole search because \"[w]e didn't have anything over him....\"</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">In any event, probable cause to believe that Crawford had participated in a bank robbery two and one half years earlier would not have justified a <i>search</i> of his residence. The individualized suspicion that is required to render a search reasonable is suspicion that the search may uncover evidence relating to a crime. As discussed <i>supra,</i> the record clearly reflects that the officers had no reasonable suspicion that a search of Crawford's home would disclose any such evidence.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn29\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29_ref\">29</a>\n        <p> Although federal law governs our holding that the parole search in this case did not comply with the requirements of the Fourth Amendment, the dissent proclaims that we may not properly issue our opinion without California's participation in the case<i>See post</i> at 736-737.

Rather, the government claims only that Crawford, like all parolees, consented in advance and in blanket fashion to otherwise unlawful searches when he signed the \"Fourth Waiver\" condition</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The government cites a string of California cases to support its consent theory. However, we again note that federal law governs the standard for a valid consent to search under the Fourth Amendment. <i>See Ooley,</i> 116 F.3d at 372; <i>Davis,</i> 932 F.2d at 758.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn31\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn31_ref\">31</a>\n        <p> The dissent harshly criticizes our alleged misrepresentation of the nature of the \"Fourth Waiver\" condition as a consensual waiver rather than as a mandatory rule governing all parolees<i>See post</i> at 724-725. We intend no such deceit and offer no such erroneous characterization. <i>See supra</i> note 1. We acknowledge that the record does not show that California has chosen to construe its parole condition as a waiver, and we do not intimate that it would do so. Nor does it matter how California characterizes the condition. We fully agree with the dissent that \"consent and waiver cannot be used to validate [mandatory] parole conditions,\" <i>post</i> at 725; as we explain <i>infra,</i> no construction of the condition as a purported \"waiver\" or demonstration of \"consent\" will allow California to accomplish indirectly what it may not accomplish directly.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Rather, we address (and dispose of) the argument that the \"Fourth Waiver\" condition functions as a blanket consent to search because that argument has been pressed upon us by the federal government in an effort to preserve the California practice. It would in our view be inappropriate simply to ignore the argument or to dismiss it summarily. Nevertheless, it should be plain that the government's consent theory hardly lies at the heart of our opinion. The theory is merely an additional argument that we must confront once we decide the principal question and hold that reasonable suspicion is required to search the home of a parolee subject to a parole condition. It is only because of the government's additional assertion that the condition constitutes valid consent eliminating all Fourth Amendment protection, that we are required to hold not only that the Fourth Amendment prevents the state from <i>imposing</i> a suspicionless search upon parolees in the home, but that a state is also precluded from conducting such a search on the ground that the parolee's signature on a mandatory parole condition waives his Fourth Amendment rights.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn32\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32_ref\">32</a>\n        <p> Our decision does not render the \"Fourth Waiver\" parole condition a nullity.

However, the finding that officers engaged in a \"flagrant\" illegal search can also refer to the degree to which searching officials intentionally overstepped the law. In both cases, looking to the flagrancy of the search suits the purposes of the taint analysis. The former bears on the likelihood that the evidence in question was flushed out by the illegal search, and therefore the degree to which the evidence would impugn judicial integrity if admitted; the latter bears on the need for increased deterrence.

He was convicted of these crimes and sentenced to state prison. In addition, his federal supervised release was revoked.

As Crawford's state parole officer correctly explained when confronted in district court by the federal prosecutor with this misleading characterization, \"I do not call them a `Fourth waiver'... my understanding of the Fourth waiver applies to probationers in the county.\" This single sentence &#8212; spoken by the only state official to make an appearance in this case &#8212; speaks volumes to anyone familiar with California criminal law and procedure, but it apparently went over the heads of the federal authorities, and the prosecutor's mistake has fouled up the resolution of this case ever since. In fact, California's Administrative Code says, \"The parole conditions are not a contract but are the specific rules governing all parolees whether or not the parolee has signed the form containing the parole conditions.\" Cal.Code. Regs. tit. 15, &#167; 2512(a). As the California Supreme Court has recognized:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The consent exception to the warrant requirement may not be invoked to validate the search of an adult parolee because under the Determinate Sentencing Act of 1976, parole is not a matter of choice. The Board of Prison Terms must provide a period of parole; the prisoner must accept it. (Pen.Code &#167; 3000 et seq.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>People v.

What this explanation obviously means is that consent and waiver cannot be used to validate parole conditions, and neither can the lack thereof be used to invalidate them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This error, of course, did not originate with Judge Reinhardt. As far as I can tell from the record, the federal prosecutors and agents with whom it originated do not fully understand California law and persist to this day in calling parole conditions \"Fourth waivers.\" To quote Assistant United State's Attorney Hobson's exchange in the district court with her witness FBI Agent Bowdich, \"Now you called it a Fourth waiver. What are you referring to? What is it?\" Bowdich's answer was, \"It's a common term ... under the state parole or probation system.... Fourth waiver just means they're waiving their right to search and seizure.\" Wrong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In summary, the consent/waiver doctrine is irrelevant in this context. Thus, I conclude that the majority's willingness to entertain the Federal Government's disorientation on this issue is no more than knowingly allowing, tongue-in-cheek, a strawman to walk onto the chopping block so it can be hacked to death. The assertion that the consent argument is being answered in terms of consent jurisprudence \"just because the government raises it\" is too cute by half. We have no business \"adopting the government's preferred nomenclature\" that is wrong and analytically misleading. Scotch tape is not Scotch liquor just because the federal government says it is. Before we start branding anything as unconstitutional, at the very least we should have a <i>clear</i> picture of what we are assessing. So should have the federal prosecutor before attempting to defend it as a waiver of Fourth Amendment rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">California law provides that \"The Board of Prison Terms upon granting any parole to any prisoner may also impose on the parole any conditions that it may deem proper.\" Cal. Pen.Code &#167; 3053(a). Consequently, and according to the law, certain conditions were imposed on Crawford in connection with his release on parole in the year 2000. When Crawford was released on parole, whether he liked it or not, and whether he consented to it or not, he became subject to a search and seizure condition of parole that (1) recognized his status as still in custody, and (2) was designed to effectuate supervision of him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In recognition of Crawford's status, the Department of Corrections first imposed these standard conditions on him on October 13, 1999.

As State Parole Agent Berner explained in his testimony, \"I &#8212; when I have them initial the section (a) and (b) up above, I inform them that their residence and property under their control can be searched by a peace officer at any time.\" And, as Crawford told the district court in sworn testimony regarding parole officer Berner's advice to him that as a parolee he was subject to searches, \"I just, you know, just took that for granted that, you know, I'm on parole, that I don't have no rights at all.\" Thus, I conclude that Crawford had no subjective expectation of privacy whatsoever. Given the controlling laws, the appearance of the word \"agree\" under subsection (b) in Crawford's acknowledgment is essentially no more than acknowledgment of the force of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>In Reyes,</i> the California Supreme Court authoritatively explained the status of a parolee under California law and held that \"[w]hen <i>involuntary search conditions are properly imposed,</i> reasonable suspicion is no longer a prerequisite to conducting a search of the subject's person or property.\" 19 Cal.4th at 752, 80 Cal.Rptr.2d at 739, 968 P.2d at 450 (emphasis added).

With these cases in mind, the court concluded &#8212; correctly in my view &#8212; that parolees as a class are different, and that they have forfeited any right to challenge a proper parole search conducted by designated law enforcement authorities while still in constructive custody as they serve out their sentences and make the transition back into society under the regulatory control of the Department of Corrections.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to <i>Ferguson v.

Parolees, like drunk drivers on our highways, are a discrete group that are a demonstrable menace to the safety of the communities into which they are discharged. <i>See Mich. Dept. of State Police v. Sitz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112459\"><a href=\"/opinion/112459/michigan-dept-of-state-police-v-sitz/\"><span class=\"volume\">496</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">444</span></a></span>, 451, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112459\"><a href=\"/opinion/112459/michigan-dept-of-state-police-v-sitz/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">412</span></a></span> (1990) (\"No one can seriously dispute the magnitude of the drunken driving problem or the States' interest in eradicating it.\"). Parolees have demonstrated by their adjudicated criminal conduct a capacity and willingness to commit crimes serious enough to deprive them of liberty. They have not yet finished serving their sentences in connection with which they do not enjoy a presumption of innocence. Moreover, their collective behavior while on parole demonstrates the truth of the axiom that past behavior is the best predictor of future behavior. Thus, I conclude that the supervision of the members of this rationally identified group is a \"special need\" of California that transcends the scope of normal, everyday law enforcement concerns. Parole is first and foremost about supervising and controlling people who have demonstrated a propensity to break the law and for whom the State still has a responsibility to constrain and to mentor in connection with public safety.

With <i>Reyes</i> in mind as well as the magnitude of the challenge, I think it is clear that the special needs of California's parole system make the warrant requirement impracticable. I conclude also that given all the relevant facts and circumstances, California's parolee search conditions are eminently reasonable. The statistics previously described leave no room for doubt that crime by parolees is a huge problem in California that demands government attention and action &#8212; one must look no further than Crawford and Richard Allen Davis. As in the case of the probation searches approved in <i>Griffin,</i> a warrant requirement would interfere with the parole system of supervision, \"setting up a magistrate rather than [the parole agent] as the judge of how close a supervision [the parolee] requires.\" <i>Id.</i> at 876, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111959\"><a href=\"/opinion/111959/griffin-v-wisconsin/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In addition, the delay inherent in obtaining a warrant would (1) hamper quick responses to evidence of misconduct, and (2) reduce the deterrent effect of the conditions. <i>Id.</i> Furthermore, the rules that normally pertain to the quantity and quality of information needed to secure a warrant are at odds with the essence and needs of the parole system. Again, as in the case of probation, \"The agency ... must be able to proceed on the basis of its entire experience with [the parolee], and to assess probabilities in the light of its knowledge of his life, character, and circumstances.\" <i>Id.</i> at 879, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111959\"><a href=\"/opinion/111959/griffin-v-wisconsin/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

When read in the light of <i>Reyes,</i> California's parole search conditions do not wholly eliminate a parolee's expectation or right of privacy. To the contrary, they authorize only narrowly tailored searches by a class of authorized officials rationally related to the individual's parole status. More importantly, according to <i>Reyes,</i> a parolee in California retains a right of privacy against government searches that are arbitrary, a right of privacy against searches that are capricious, and a right of privacy against searches that are harassing. These restrictions are meaningful, and they represent workable standards state and federal courts apply every day in assessing the propriety of a variety of government actions. These qualifications accomplish the constitutional goal of keeping parole searches within the scope of reason demanded by the Constitution by mandating that the search be justifiably within the purpose of parole conditions at issue. <i>See also Latta,</i> 521 F.2d at 252 (\"In a given case, what is done may be so unreasonable as to require that the search be held to violate the Fourth Amendment.

Should the manner in which such a search was conducted (1) \"shock the conscience\" of our community's sense of \"decency and fairness,\" or (2) was so \"brutal\" and \"offensive\" that it did not comport with traditional ideas of fair play and decency, then both the exclusionary rule as well as 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 would provide both remedy and redress. <i>See Rochin v.

I quote to make this point from the opinion:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p159\">\n      <span class=\"num\">159</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, if the mandatory parole condition were deemed to be a valid blanket consent, any constitutional protection for parolees would be rendered illusory &#8212; every state could force its parolees to sign the blanket waiver as a condition of parole, and every parolee's constitutional rights would thereby instantly vanish. Indeed, under the government's theory, all parolees could be forced to waive all constitutional rights, including the right to due process in revocation proceedings, or even the right to trial on any new offense allegedly committed during the parole period. We hold that parolees may not generally be forced as a threshold condition of their parole to surrender by blanket waiver their Fourth Amendment rights, including those so recently recognized by <i>Knights.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p160\">\n      <span class=\"num\">160</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even though this passage is hopelessly confused in viewing this issue as one of consent and forced waivers, it blows an ill wind for California. We may have just thrown open the habeas gates to a flood of petitions, disabled electronic monitoring, crippled DNA banks, and who knows what else. Only the Richard Allen Davises of the underworld will herald this unsettling result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p161\">\n      <span class=\"num\">161</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not only is this opinion on the wrong track in its analysis and dead wrong on the merits, but it has accomplished this drastic result in a case where representatives of the California Attorney General have not appeared or been heard from to represent that State's interests. As far as I can tell, they do not even know of the existence of this case. Instead, we have had to rely on federal prosecutors who inexplicably do not appear to grasp the essence of the relevant California law. At the very least, federal law and respect for California compels us to invite California's Attorney General to intervene in this case, and, at a minimum, to file an amicus brief pursuant to F.R.A.P. 29 and to augment the record before we inflict such damage on California law and overturn the will of its Legislature as construed by the California Supreme Court. 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2403(b) reads:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p162\">\n      <span class=\"num\">162</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) In any action, suit, or proceeding in a court of the United States to which a State or any agency, officer, or employee thereof is not a party, wherein the constitutionality of any statute of that State affecting the public interest is drawn in question, the court shall certify such fact to the attorney general of the State, and shall permit the State to intervene for presentation of evidence, if evidence is otherwise admissible in the case, and for argument on the question of constitutionality.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p163\">\n      <span class=\"num\">163</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, Rule 44 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure contains the same requirement:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p164\">\n      <span class=\"num\">164</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) Constitutional Challenge to State Statute. If a party questions the constitutionality of a statute of a State in a proceeding in which that State or its agency, officer, or employee is not a party in an official capacity, the questioning party must give written notice to the circuit clerk immediately upon the filing of the record or as soon as the question is raised in the court of appeals. The clerk must then certify that fact to the attorney general of the State.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p165\">\n      <span class=\"num\">165</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With all respect to my colleagues, their studied refusal to accede to my request to allow California to appear in this case before we issue our opinion is distressing. We have violated the spirit of the law by excluding the sovereign entity most affected by this decision. As the Supreme Court said in <i>Arizonans for Official English v.

As limited by the California Supreme Court in <i>Reyes,</i> and the Due Process Clause, these searches conform to the demands of the Fourth Amendment. Moreover, California's decision not to recognize a privacy right on the part of convicted felons to defeat these searches is rational and clearly not arbitrary, not capricious, not harassing, and not punitive. Crawford subjectively did not have any expectation of privacy in his residence, and any such objective expectation that any parolee might have had would not be \"one that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable.\" <i>Bond v.

A parole search took an armed bank robber off the streets of San Diego and put him where he belongs.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3-1_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Times change. So do our reasonable expectations of privacy. While writing this opinion, I traveled to San Francisco to work. When I arrived at my hotel, I opened my suitcase and found a piece of paper that was not there when I closed my suitcase in Boise. The paper reads:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">NOTIFICATION OF BAGGAGE INSPECTION</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">To protect you and your fellow passenger, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is required by law to inspect all checked baggage. As part of this process, some bags are opened and physically inspected. You bag was among those selected for physical inspection.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">During the inspection, your bag and its contents may have been searched for prohibited items. At the completion of the inspection, the contents were returned to your bag, which was resealed with a tamper-evident seal.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">If the TSA screener was unable to open your bag for inspection because it was locked, the screener may have been forced to break the locks on your bag. TSA sincerely regrets having to do this, and has taken care to reseal your bag upon completion of inspection. However, TSA is not liable for damage to your locks resulting from this necessary security precaution.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">It would appear that post September 11, 2001, all of us who travel by air are now subject to a \"special needs\" search, even Crawford. Does this mean we have wholly lost our right of privacy? Of course not. It means only that to protect ourselves from real danger, we need to adopt reasonable procedures that will increase our security against crime.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
