Nadel argued for appellant; Derek L.\n                       Tabone argued for appellee.\n20\n21   Before: KURTZ, LAFFERTY and TAYLOR, Bankruptcy Judges.\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26        *\n           This disposition is not appropriate for publication.\n27   Although it may be cited for whatever persuasive value it may\n     have (see Fed. R. App. P. 32.1), it has no precedential value.\n28   See 9th Cir. BAP Rule 8024-1.\n\f 1                              INTRODUCTION\n 2        On remand from this Panel, the bankruptcy court determined\n 3   that chapter 71 debtor Ana Beatriz Betancourt’s fraudulent\n 4   transfer scheme caused plaintiff Matthew Ballmer’s predecessor in\n 5   interest to suffer an injury giving rise to a legally cognizable\n 6   claim that could result in a money judgment.   Based on this\n 7   determination and others, the bankruptcy court held – for the\n 8   second time – that Betancourt’s debt to Matthew arose from “a\n 9   willful and malicious injury to another entity” within the\n10   meaning of § 523(a)(6), and the bankruptcy court entered an\n11   amended judgment after remand in favor of Matthew.\n12        Betancourt now appeals for the second time.   As this Panel\n13   directed in its disposition of Betancourt’s first appeal, the\n14   bankruptcy court duly identified a legally cognizable claim that\n15   could result in a money judgment in support of its § 523(a)(6)\n16   judgment.   None of the points Betancourt raises on appeal justify\n17   reversal.   Accordingly, we AFFIRM.\n18                                  FACTS\n19        Our prior decision, Betancourt v. Ballmer\n20   (In re Betancourt), 2015 WL 3500322 (Mem. Dec.) (9th Cir. BAP\n21   June 3, 2015), laid out the pertinent facts in great detail.    We\n22   will revisit only those facts necessary to set the stage for this\n23   second decision.\n24        Matthew is the son of Paul Ballmer and is the successor by\n25\n          1\n26         Unless specified otherwise, all chapter and section\n     references are to the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §§ 101-1532, and\n27   all \"Rule\" references are to the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy\n     Procedure, Rules 1001-9037. All \"Civil Rule\" references are to\n28   the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\n                                      2\n\f 1   assignment to Paul’s interest in a judgment debt against La Fe,\n 2   Inc. – Betancourt’s wholly-owned corporation.2   Paul obtained\n 3   this judgment by default when neither Betancourt nor La Fe’s\n 4   counsel of record Robert Rein appeared for the duly scheduled\n 5   trial set in Paul’s contract action against La Fe.\n 6        Betancourt strenuously complained in the bankruptcy court\n 7   that this state court judgment was unjust, but neither she nor\n 8   Rein made any effort either to have it set aside or to appeal it.\n 9   Instead, at the time of the December 2004 trial and immediately\n10   thereafter, Betancourt, her significant other, Calvin Larson, and\n11   Rein were busy perfecting a series of transfers that effectively\n12   stripped La Fe of its only assets: vacant land located in\n13   Topanga, California.   In our prior decision, we generally\n14   identified this land as consisting of three parcels and referred\n15   to them as parcel 30-7, parcel 30-10 and parcel 27-29.\n16   A.   Parcel 30-7\n17        On behalf of La Fe, Betancourt conveyed parcel 30-7 from\n18   La Fe to Rein as an individual.   The 30-7 grant deed was dated\n19   October 2, 2002, but was not recorded until July 2004, well after\n20   Paul had commenced his 2003 state court contract action.\n21        Rein supposedly paid $200,000 cash for parcel 30-7, but the\n22   evidence in the record indicates that these funds never made it\n23   to La Fe.   In fact, Betancourt admitted at trial that La Fe had\n24   no bank account in which to deposit any consideration paid.\n25\n26\n27\n          2\n           We refer to Matthew and Paul by their first names for the\n28   sake of clarity. No disrespect is intended.\n\n                                       3\n\f 1   B.   Parcel 30-10\n 2            Betancourt conveyed parcel 30-10 from La Fe to Rein’s\n 3   wholly owned corporation, Racada Corp.     Like the 30-7 deed, the\n 4   30-10 deed was dated October 2, 2002, and was executed by\n 5   Betancourt on behalf of La Fe.     Unlike the 30-7 deed, the 30-10\n 6   deed was not recorded until December 20, 2004 – the week after\n 7   Betancourt failed to appear for the state court trial.\n 8        The only “consideration” Racada ever gave for parcel 30-10\n 9   was a promise to pay $100,000 secured by a deed of trust naming\n10   Larson as the beneficiary.3    Whereas the 30-10 deed was dated\n11   October 2, 2002, the Racada deed of trust was not executed until\n12   December 10, 2004 (a few days before the state court trial) and\n13   was not recorded until December 20, 2004 (the same day as the\n14   30-10 deed was recorded).     Neither Racada nor Rein ever made any\n15   payment on the missing note.     In February 2007, Rein executed, on\n16   behalf of Racada, an assignment of deed of trust purporting to\n17   assign the beneficial interest under the 30-10 deed of trust to\n18   Betancourt, even though the holder of the beneficial interest\n19   supposedly was Larson.     At the bankruptcy court trial held in\n20   December 2013, neither Betancourt nor Rein were able explain how\n21   Racada as the trustor could convey the beneficial interest in the\n22   30-10 deed of trust from Larson to Betancourt.     Even so,\n23   Betancourt substituted in a new trustee in 2007, and in 2008 the\n24   new trustee executed a trustee’s deed upon sale conveying title\n25   to Betancourt.     Betancourt is identified in the trustee’s deed as\n26\n          3\n27         It is not clear from the record who held the promissory\n     note or who was named as payee in the promissory note. The note\n28   apparently never was produced in discovery or presented at trial.\n\n                                        4\n\f 1   the foreclosing beneficiary for a credit bid of roughly $124,000\n 2   – the full amount of the debt Racada allegedly owed.\n 3   C.   Parcel 27-29\n 4        On behalf of La Fe, Betancourt conveyed parcel 27-29 to\n 5   Larson.4   The 27-29 grant deed is dated March 27, 1998, but was\n 6   not recorded until December 20, 2004 – at the same time the 30-10\n 7   grant deed and trust deed were recorded.    Inexplicably, in\n 8   October 1998 Larson recorded a deed of trust covering some of the\n 9   same parcels.    The 27-29 deed of trust was dated February 15,\n10   1992, was executed by Betancourt on behalf of La Fe and named\n11   Larson as beneficiary.    If Larson already owned parcel 27-29 per\n12   the 27-29 grant deed executed on March 27, 1998, why would Larson\n13   have needed to record in October 1998 the 27-29 deed of trust?\n14        Betancourt’s attempts to explain these transactions did not\n15   clarify matters.    At times she indicated that Larson really owned\n16   parcel 27-29; at other times she indicated that parcel 27-29\n17   secured roughly $500,000 in “loans” Larson made, which enabled\n18   La Fe to purchase and pay some of the expenses of parcel 27-29;\n19   and at other times she indicated that Larson’s $500,000\n20   constituted a capital investment in La Fe.    Nor was Betancourt\n21   able to explain why, in December 2004, she executed and recorded\n22   a quitclaim deed conveying any interest she had as an individual\n23   in parcel 27-29 to Larson.\n24        In 2007, Larson conveyed parcel 27-29 to Betancourt for no\n25   consideration.    Thus, the net effect of all of the transfer\n26\n27\n          4\n           At least for property tax purposes, what we refer to as\n28   parcel 27-29 actually consists of multiple distinct parcels.\n\n                                       5\n\f 1   documents recorded between 2004 and 2008 was the transfer of all\n 2   three parcels away from La Fe; parcels 30-10 and 27-29 ended up\n 3   in Betancourt’s hands – without her (or anyone else) having paid\n 4   any consideration to La Fe for these transfers.\n 5   D.   The Bankruptcy Court’s First Decision And This Panel’s First\n 6   Decision\n 7        Looking at the timing and nature of the above-referenced\n 8   transactions, the bankruptcy court concluded after a one-day\n 9   trial in December 2013 that Betancourt engaged in a “flurry of\n10   activity” in December 2004 to transfer out of La Fe all of its\n11   assets.    The bankruptcy court found that Betancourt undertook\n12   these actions for the specific purpose of preventing Paul from\n13   collecting from La Fe’s assets any judgment he obtained.    The\n14   bankruptcy court further found that there was no evidence of any\n15   consideration paid by Larson for parcel 27-29.    With respect to\n16   parcel 30-10, the bankruptcy court found that La Fe did not\n17   receive any consideration for this property and that Rein had\n18   served as a “straw man” to enable Betancourt to strip this asset\n19   from La Fe.5\n20        According to the bankruptcy court, the evidence demonstrated\n21   that, before Betancourt transferred them away, La Fe had equity\n22   in each of the above-referenced parcels: $200,000 in parcel 30-7;\n23   $100,000 in 30-10; and $100,000 in parcel 27-29.    Based on all of\n24\n25        5\n           The bankruptcy court opined that parcel 30-7 was not part\n26   of Betancourt’s scheme to denude La Fe of assets because the\n     evidence demonstrated that Rein actually paid $200,000 for this\n27   property. The bankruptcy court did not make any finding\n     regarding the disposition of the $200,000 in sale proceeds, but\n28   it is fairly clear that La Fe never received them.\n\n                                       6\n\f 1   the above, the bankruptcy court held that Matthew had suffered a\n 2   willful and malicious injury within the meaning of § 523(a)(6).\n 3         Betancourt appealed the bankruptcy court’s December 2013\n 4   judgment, and this Panel issued a decision in June 2015 remanding\n 5   the matter to the bankruptcy court for additional findings.\n 6   Among other things, we said that the bankruptcy court needed to\n 7   make a finding on Betancourt’s subjective state of mind – whether\n 8   she subjectively intended to injure Paul when she made the\n 9   transfers described above.\n10         In addition, we asked the bankruptcy court to make more\n11   specific findings regarding any injury resulting from\n12   Betancourt’s actions, as follows:\n13   (1)   if the injury was to Paul’s property, identifying the\n14         specific property interest of Paul’s that Betancourt injured\n15         by transferring away La Fe’s assets;\n16   (2)   if the injury was to Paul personally, identifying the\n17         “legally cognizable claim which could result in a monetary\n18         judgment” against Betancourt arising from the injury (citing\n19         Quarre v. Saylor (In re Saylor), 178 B.R. 209, 213-14 (9th\n20         Cir. BAP 1995), aff’d & adopted, 108 F.3d 219 (9th Cir.\n21         1997)); and\n22   (3)   a finding quantifying the injury resulting from Betancourt’s\n23         conduct – and segregating the nondischargeable debt (if any)\n24         arising from Betancourt’s willful and malicious property\n25         transfers from the dischargeable judgment debt arising from\n26         her breach of her contract with Paul.\n27   E.    Proceedings on Remand\n28         On remand, the bankruptcy court reviewed the evidence from\n\n                                      7\n\f 1   the December 2013 trial and gave the parties the opportunity to\n 2   present new evidence.   The only new evidence initially presented\n 3   consisted of Betancourt’s additional trial testimony.   However,\n 4   after presentation of the supplemental trial testimony, the\n 5   bankruptcy court issued an order asking the parties to present\n 6   evidence on two new issues: (1) when Paul and Matthew first\n 7   actually discovered Betancourt’s transfers of La Fe’s assets; and\n 8   (2) “when it would have been reasonable to discover the\n 9   transfers.”\n10        In response to this order, Paul filed a declaration stating\n11   that he did not actually learn of the transfers until July 2011.\n12   Paul explained that he recorded an abstract of judgment in\n13   February 2005 and that he thought the resulting judgment lien\n14   against La Fe’s real property eventually would result in the\n15   satisfaction of his judgment.   Paul further explained that health\n16   issues prevented him from making any further judgment enforcement\n17   efforts until July 2011, when he discovered the transfers after\n18   conducting a routine title search.\n19        In spite of the clear language in the bankruptcy court’s\n20   February 2016 order directing both Paul and Matthew to file\n21   declarations, Matthew did not file any declaration.   Betancourt\n22   filed her own declaration in response to Paul’s declaration\n23   contending that, even if Paul did not actually know of the\n24   transfers, he reasonably should have known of them much earlier\n25   than 2011 – as all of them were evidenced by recorded documents\n26   in the public record.   Betancourt further complained that, in\n27   contravention of the bankruptcy court’s order, Matthew had not\n28   submitted a declaration and had not presented any evidence\n\n                                      8\n\f 1   regarding when he actually learned of the transfers or the reason\n 2   why he had not discovered the transfers earlier.\n 3        Matthew filed a reply addressing the points made in\n 4   Betancourt’s declaration.     Matthew essentially argued that Paul’s\n 5   declaration sufficed to address the issues raised by the\n 6   bankruptcy court in its February 2016 order.\n 7   F.   The Bankruptcy Court’s First Decision On Remand\n 8        Based on all of the above evidence, the bankruptcy court\n 9   found that Betancourt carried out her scheme of transfers of\n10   La Fe’s property with the intent to harm Paul by stripping La Fe\n11   of assets from which his judgment could be satisfied.\n12        As for the issues regarding the nature and extent of Paul’s\n13   injury, the bankruptcy court determined that there was no injury\n14   to any property interest of Paul’s; however, according to the\n15   court, Paul was personally injured by Betancourt’s scheme of\n16   transfers.     And that injury, the bankruptcy court opined,\n17   constituted a legally cognizable claim which could result in a\n18   monetary judgment against Betancourt.     Citing Cal Civ. Code\n19   § 3439.08(b)(1)6 and Murray v. Bammer (In re Bammer), 131 F.3d\n20\n21        6\n              This section provides in relevant part:\n22\n                  (1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the\n23                creditor may recover judgment for the value of the\n                  asset transferred, as adjusted under subdivision (c),\n24                or the amount necessary to satisfy the creditor's\n                  claim, whichever is less. The judgment may be entered\n25                against the following:\n26\n                  (A) The first transferee of the asset or the person for\n27                whose benefit the transfer was made.\n\n28                                                         (continued...)\n\n                                        9\n\f 1   788 (9th Cir. 1997), abrogated in part on other grounds by,\n 2   Kawaauhau v. Geiger, 523 U.S. 57 (1998), the bankruptcy court\n 3   posited that Betancourt would have transferee liability as a\n 4   secondary transferee of the fraudulent transfers.     By 2008, the\n 5   bankruptcy court pointed out, Betancourt ended up holding legal\n 6   title to both parcel 30-10 and parcel 27-29, and she did not\n 7   qualify for the good faith transferee safe harbors set forth in\n 8   § 3439.08(b)(1)(B).7\n 9        The bankruptcy court also determined the amount of the\n10   nondischargeable debt.     Based on the value of parcels 30-10 and\n11   27-29 ($100,000 each) and the amount of debt the Ballmers were\n12   prevented from collecting as a result of Betancourt’s actually\n13   fraudulent transfers ($85,626), the bankruptcy court concluded\n14   that Matthew held a potential monetary claim for $85,626, plus\n15   interest, under Cal. Civ. Code §§ 3439.04(a)(1) and\n16   3439.08(b)(2).     According to the bankruptcy court, this claim\n17   arose from a willful and malicious injury within the meaning of\n18   § 523(a)(6).\n19        But the bankruptcy court concluded that Matthew did not\n20   actually have a legally cognizable claim for monetary damages\n21\n          6\n22            (...continued)\n                  (B) An immediate or mediate transferee of the first\n23                transferee, other than either of the following:\n\n24                (i) A good faith transferee that took for value.\n25                (ii) An immediate or mediate good faith transferee of a\n26                person described in clause (i).\n          7\n27         Neither Betancourt nor Larson ever obtained title to parcel\n     30-7, so the bankruptcy court did not consider that parcel as\n28   part of its assessment of the injury to Paul.\n\n                                       10\n\f 1   that could be excepted from discharge under § 523(a)(6) given\n 2   that the Ballmers had failed to demonstrate that their claim was\n 3   not time barred under the applicable statute of limitations.\n 4   Because the Ballmers sought to avail themselves of the “discovery\n 5   rule” set forth in § 3439.09(a),8 and because plaintiffs invoking\n 6   this discovery rule bear the burden of proof to establish their\n 7   entitlement to apply it, the bankruptcy court held that Matthew’s\n 8   failure to submit a declaration regarding when he actually\n 9   discovered the transfers was fatal to both the fraudulent\n10   transfer claim and, in turn, his nondischargeability claim.9\n11   G.   Matthew’s Motion For Relief From Judgment And The Bankruptcy\n12        Court’s Amended Judgment On Remand\n13        After the bankruptcy court entered its judgment upon remand,\n14   Matthew filed a motion pursuant to Rules 9023 and 9024 seeking\n15\n          8\n16            This section provides in relevant part:\n17                A cause of action with respect to a transfer\n                  or obligation under this chapter is\n18\n                  extinguished unless action is brought . . .\n19\n                  (a) Under paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of\n20                Section 3439.04, not later than four years\n                  after the transfer was made or the obligation\n21                was incurred or, if later, not later than one\n22                year after the transfer or obligation was or\n                  could reasonably have been discovered by the\n23                claimant.\n          9\n24         On the other hand, the bankruptcy court concluded that\n     there was sufficient evidence in the record for it to conclude\n25   that neither of the Ballmers reasonably should have discovered\n26   the transfers (and their fraudulent nature) before Paul actually\n     discovered them in 2011. Thus, had Matthew filed a declaration\n27   establishing that he did not actually discover the the fraudulent\n     transfers before Paul did, the Ballmers would have prevailed on\n28   the statute of limitations issue.\n\n                                       11\n\f 1   retrial or relief from judgment.      Matthew asserted that his\n 2   failure to file a declaration regarding when he actually\n 3   discovered Betancourt’s transfers was the result of his counsel’s\n 4   misreading of the bankruptcy court’s order and had resulted in a\n 5   miscarriage of justice.   In his accompanying declaration, Matthew\n 6   explained that he took the assignment of the judgment from his\n 7   father in 2007 only because of his father’s health issues and\n 8   that the only knowledge he (Matthew) had regarding the subject\n 9   transfers was the information he received from his father, which\n10   his father shared with him after he discovered the transfers in\n11   July 2011.\n12        In her opposition to Matthew’s motion, Betancourt argued\n13   that the language in the February 2016 order was more than clear\n14   regarding what evidence was necessary and that Matthew should not\n15   be permitted under either Rule 9023 or Rule 9024 to present\n16   evidence that was clearly available to him well before the\n17   court’s decision and judgment.\n18        The bankruptcy court held that Matthew was entitled to\n19   relief from judgment.   Even though Matthew’s motion did not focus\n20   on excusable neglect as a ground for relief, the bankruptcy court\n21   ruled that Matthew’s counsel’s excusable neglect supported the\n22   granting of relief under Civil Rule 60(b)(1) (which is made\n23   applicable in bankruptcy cases and adversary proceedings by\n24   Rule 9024).   Applying the four factors from Pioneer Inv. Servs.\n25   Co. v. Brunswick Assocs. Ltd., 507 U.S. 380, 395 (1993), the\n26   bankruptcy court concluded: (1) that the facts presented\n27   established excusable neglect; (2) that Matthew (belatedly) had\n28   established his lack of actual knowledge of the transfers; and\n\n                                      12\n\f 1   (3) that Matthew was entitled to an amended judgment against\n 2   Betancourt excepting from discharge her debt in the amount of\n 3   $85,626.73, plus interest, for a total of $101,850.49.\n 4        The bankruptcy court entered its amended judgment upon\n 5   remand on January 12, 2017, and Betancourt timely appealed.\n 6                             JURISDICTION\n 7        The bankruptcy court had jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n 8   §§ 1334 and 157(b)(2)(I), and we have jurisdiction under\n 9   28 U.S.C. § 158.\n10                                 ISSUES\n11   1.

Intent Finding\n21        Betancourt, first, challenges the bankruptcy court’s finding\n22   that she conducted the fraudulent transfers with the subjective\n23   intent to injure Paul.   An injury only is “willful” if the debtor\n24   subjectively intended to cause injury or “actually believed that\n25\n          10\n26         Assignees of a debt, like Matthew, typically can pursue\n     the same nondischargeability claims as would have been available\n27   to their assignor. See New Falls Corp. v. Boyajian\n     (In re Boyajian), 367 B.R. 138, 145–48 (9th Cir. BAP 2007),\n28   aff'd, 564 F.3d 1088 (9th Cir. 2009).\n\n                                     14\n\f 1   injury was substantially certain to occur.”   In re Betancourt,\n 2   2015 WL 3500322, at *5 (citing Carrillo v. Su (In re Su),\n 3   290 F.3d 1140, 1144–45 (9th Cir. 2002)).\n 4        The bankruptcy court’s intent finding was supported by ample\n 5   evidence.   The timing and nature of the transfer of La Fe’s real\n 6   property, first, away from La Fe and, later, into Betancourt’s\n 7   hands is suggestive of an intent to injure Paul.   Moreover, the\n 8   bankruptcy court found not credible Betancourt’s attempts to\n 9   offer alternate explanations for the transfers.\n10        On appeal, Betancourt contends that, because Larson and\n11   Racada gave consideration for the transfers they received, she\n12   could not have made the transfers with the intent to injure Paul.\n13   As a preliminary matter, it is far from clear that either the\n14   so-called antecedent debt owed to Larson or Racada’s note and\n15   deed of trust constituted any consideration to La Fe.   The\n16   bankruptcy court found to the contrary, that La Fe received no\n17   consideration for the transfer of parcel 30-10 or for the\n18   transfer of parcel 27-29.   And the record supports this finding.\n19        But even if we were to hold that La Fe did receive some\n20   consideration, or received reasonably equivalent value, this\n21   would not justify reversal of the bankruptcy court’s intent\n22   finding.    The bankruptcy court’s intent finding was based on the\n23   entirety of the circumstances and the presence or absence of\n24   consideration was only one of a number of factors the bankruptcy\n25   court considered.   We cannot say that, given the nature and\n26   timing of Betancourt’s transfers of La Fe’s properties, the\n27   ostensible presence of some consideration precluded a finding\n28   that Betancourt subjectively intended to injure Paul.\n\n                                      15\n\f 1        Our analysis is bolstered by the law governing actually\n 2   fraudulent transfers under Cal. Civ. Code § 3439.04(a)(1).     The\n 3   absence of reasonably equivalent value is not a prerequisite to\n 4   finding that a debtor made a transfer with the actual intent to\n 5   hinder, delay, or defraud her creditors.    In re Ezra, 537 B.R. at\n 6   930 (citing Wolkowitz v. Beverly (In re Beverly), 374 B.R. 221,\n 7   235 (9th Cir. BAP 2007), aff'd in part and adopted, 551 F.3d 1092\n 8   (9th Cir. 2008)).     Indeed, the presence or absence of reasonably\n 9   equivalent value is just one of several factors courts typically\n10   consider when assessing whether the debtor had the requisite\n11   state of mind to commit an actual fraudulent transfer.    See Cal.\n12   Civ. Code § 3439.04(b) (listing factors); see also In re Ezra,\n13   537 B.R. at 930-31 (explaining that these factors – also known as\n14   badges of fraud – are not prerequisites and should not be applied\n15   formulaically).\n16        In short, the bankruptcy court’s intent finding was\n17   adequately supported by the record and the asserted presence of\n18   consideration for the subject transfers does not render the\n19   bankruptcy court’s intent finding clearly erroneous.\n20   B.   Type Of Injury\n21        Our prior decision required the bankruptcy court, on remand,\n22   to determine whether the nature of the injury to Paul resulting\n23   from Betancourt’s willful and malicious conduct would give rise\n24   to a legally cognizable claim for damages under California law.\n25   In re Betancourt, 2015 WL 3500322, at *7 (citing In re Saylor,\n26   178 B.R. at 213–214).    The bankruptcy court on remand duly\n27   determined that, as a result of her willful and malicious\n28   conduct, Betancourt had transferee liability under Cal Civ. Code\n\n                                       16\n\f 1   § 3439.08(b)(1).\n 2        In making this determination, the bankruptcy court cited in\n 3   support In re Bammer, 131 F.3d at 790.   In Bammer, a son\n 4   attempted to help his mother evade the consequences of her\n 5   embezzlement by implementing a fraudulent transfer scheme\n 6   designed to strip her of the remaining equity in her residence.\n 7   Steven Bammer carried out this scheme by taking out a loan\n 8   secured by a third mortgage against his mother’s house.     The\n 9   Ninth Circuit court of appeals held that the injury caused by\n10   Steven Bammer’s instigation and receipt of the fraudulent\n11   transfer was a willful and malicious injury that gave rise to a\n12   nondischargeable debt under § 523(a)(6).\n13        Betancourt attacks on appeal the bankruptcy court’s reliance\n14   on Bammer.   Betancourt argues that Bammer is distinguishable\n15   because, unlike in Bammer, Larson and Racada gave consideration\n16   for the transfers of parcels 30-10 and 27-29.   More specifically,\n17   Betancourt contends that, in light of the consideration La Fe\n18   allegedly received, no actionable injury to Paul occurred under\n19   the fraudulent transfer statutes.\n20        As we explained above, however, the bankruptcy court found\n21   that La Fe received no consideration for the transfers, and the\n22   record supports this finding.   Consequently, Betancourt’s attempt\n23   to distinguish Bammer is unavailing.\n24        In any event, the bankruptcy court’s determination that Paul\n25   had a legally cognizable monetary claim against Betancourt under\n26   California law did not hinge on Bammer or on the presence or\n27   absence of consideration; instead, the determination hinged on\n28   Cal. Civ. Code § 3439.08(b)(1), which provides that the creditor\n\n                                     17\n\f 1   victimized by the fraudulent transfer “may recover judgment for\n 2   the value of the asset transferred, or the amount necessary to\n 3   satisfy the creditor's claim, whichever is less.”   Furthermore,\n 4   Cal. Civ. Code § 3439.08(b)(1) permits the creditor to recover\n 5   judgment against both immediate and mediate transferees, subject\n 6   to certain safe harbors not applicable here.   Simply put, this\n 7   California fraudulent transfer statute established Paul’s right\n 8   to a monetary damages claim against Betancourt arising from her\n 9   receipt of the fraudulently transferred property.\n10        Betancourt alternately argues that there was no evidence in\n11   the record of the value of the transferred property and that she\n12   could not have any fraudulent transfer liability without evidence\n13   of such value.   Under the above-referenced California statute,\n14   Cal. Civ. Code § 3439.08(b)(1), damages against the transferee\n15   are, indeed, limited to the value of the property transferred or\n16   the amount of the creditor’s claim, whichever is less.   However,\n17   as a factual matter, Betancourt’s alternate argument lacks merit.\n18   The bankruptcy court found that, at the time of the transfer,\n19   La Fe had equity in each of the transferred parcels: $100,000 in\n20   30-10 and $100,000 in parcel 27-29.   And there was sufficient\n21   evidence in the record to support this finding.   The aggregate\n22   value of these two properties – $200,000 – exceeded the amount\n23   Paul was owed, so the value of the properties did not limit the\n24   amount of Paul’s monetary claim against Betancourt or the amount\n25   nondischargeable under § 523(a)(6).\n26        In short, we reject all of Betancourt’s theories on appeal\n27   attempting to explain why Paul did not suffer the type of injury\n28\n\n                                     18\n\f 1   covered by § 523(a)(6).11\n 2   C.   The Motion For Relief From Judgment And Application Of The\n 3        Discovery Rule To The Fraudulent Transfer Claim\n 4        Under Civil Rule 60(b)(1), a court may grant a party relief\n 5   from judgment based on excusable neglect after considering all of\n 6   the surrounding circumstances and ordinarily after focusing on\n 7   the following four factors:\n 8        (1) the danger of prejudice to the non-moving party,\n          (2) the length of delay and its potential impact on\n 9        judicial proceedings, (3) the reason for the delay,\n          including whether it was within the reasonable control\n10        of the movant, and (4) whether the moving party's\n          conduct was in good faith.\n11\n12   Pincay v. Andrews, 389 F.3d 853, 855, 859 (9th Cir. 2004)\n13   (en banc) (citing Pioneer, 507 U.S. at 395); see also Briones v.\n14   Riviera Hotel & Casino, 116 F.3d 379, 381-82 (9th Cir. 1997)\n15   (applying Pioneer’s four-factor test to Civil Rule 60(b) motion).\n16        Here, the bankruptcy court duly applied the Pioneer four-\n17   factor test to determine that Matthew should be given relief from\n18   judgment and permitted to submit an additional declaration\n19   establishing his lack of actual knowledge of the fraudulent\n20   transfers until 2011, when his father advised him of the results\n21   of his routine title search.   Betancourt has not directly\n22\n23\n          11\n           An injury only is actionable under § 523(a)(6) when it\n24   arises from conduct that is recognized as tortious under state\n     law. See Lockerby v. Sierra, 535 F.3d 1038, 1041 (9th Cir. 2008)\n25   (citing Petralia v. Jercich (In re Jercich), 238 F.3d 1202, 1206\n26   (9th Cir. 2001). At oral argument before this Panel, Betancourt\n     acknowledged her concession in the bankruptcy court that an\n27   actual fraudulent transfer action under California law qualifies\n     as an intentional tort. Nor has Betancourt attempted to withdraw\n28   this concession on appeal.\n\n                                     19\n\f 1   challenged on appeal the bankruptcy court’s specific Pioneer\n 2   findings.    Instead, she argues that, as a matter of law,\n 3   Matthew’s “mistake” was beyond the scope of Civil Rule 60(b)\n 4   excusable neglect relief.    As Betancourt put it, Matthew’s\n 5   counsel’s noncompliance with the clear and unequivocal language\n 6   of the bankruptcy court’s order directing both Matthew and Paul\n 7   to file additional evidence on the discovery rule issue “cannot\n 8   be grounds to grant” a motion for relief based on excusable\n 9   neglect.    In support of this contention, Betancourt relies on\n10   Engleson v. Burlington Northern Railroad Co., 972 F.2d 1038 (9th\n11   Cir. 1992), but Betancourt’s reliance on Engleson is misplaced.\n12   Engleson was decided before Pioneer.    Subsequent to Pioneer, the\n13   Ninth Circuit has clarified that counsel error in responding to\n14   directives in court orders and rules is not per se excluded from\n15   excusable neglect relief.    See Pincay, 389 F.3d at 859.\n16        Betancourt also attempts to argue that the excusable neglect\n17   standard was inapplicable because Matthew did not demonstrate the\n18   existence of any neglect or error.    Instead, Betancourt claims,\n19   Matthew made an affirmative strategic decision not to present\n20   into evidence his own declaration, and an intentional, calculated\n21   failure to present sufficient evidence in support of an issue on\n22   which Matthew bore the burden of proof is not the type of conduct\n23   that should be addressed by way of an excusable neglect motion.\n24        We might have considered this argument more persuasive but\n25   for the unusual procedural history pertaining to the presentation\n26   of evidence on the discovery rule issue.    Recall that the\n27   bankruptcy court issued an order after the close of evidence on\n28   remand raising the discovery rule issue and directing the parties\n\n                                      20\n\f 1   to present additional evidence.    This order provided in part as\n 2   follows:\n 3        The parties will have a period of time to do discovery\n          and present evidence of the date(s) when either of the\n 4        Ballmers or their agents did or should reasonably have\n          discovered the transfers. This can be by way of\n 5        declaration, interrogatory, deposition, or other\n          evidence. The Court will review the evidence and\n 6        determine whether a further evidentiary hearing is\n          required.\n 7\n 8   Order To Provide Further Evidence (February 16, 2016) at 4:5-10.\n 9        Based on this language and other language in its order, the\n10   bankruptcy court found that its order was ambiguous and that the\n11   ambiguity had caused Matthew’s counsel to misinterpret what was\n12   required.    The bankruptcy court further found, in terms of\n13   assessing the reason for Matthew’s counsel’s error, that it\n14   resulted from this misinterpretation – and not from any strategic\n15   decision to withhold evidence as Betancourt asserted.    We cannot\n16   say that the bankruptcy court’s findings regarding the reason for\n17   Matthew’s counsel’s error were clearly erroneous.    Nor can we say\n18   that its other findings on the Pioneer factors – lack of\n19   prejudice to Betancourt, the limited amount of delay caused by\n20   Matthew’s error and the Ballmers’ good faith – were clearly\n21   erroneous.\n22        Accordingly, the bankruptcy court did not abuse its\n23   discretion in granting Matthew’s motion for relief based on\n24   excusable neglect.\n25        Betancourt also challenges on appeal the bankruptcy court’s\n26   determination that Matthew met his burden of proof to establish\n27   the applicability of the discovery rule in order to extend the\n28   fraudulent transfer statute of limitation.    More specifically,\n\n                                       21\n\f 1   Betancourt challenges the bankruptcy court’s finding that Matthew\n 2   and his father Paul had acted diligently despite their failure to\n 3   earlier discover the fraudulent nature of Betancourt’s transfers.\n 4   The bankruptcy court correctly found Matthew bore the burden of\n 5   proof on this issue.   See Samuels v. Mix, 22 Cal.4th 1, 10, 91\n 6   Cal. Rptr. 2d 273, 989 P.2d 701 (1999).   “To successfully rely on\n 7   the discovery rule, a plaintiff must prove (a) lack of knowledge;\n 8   (b) lack of a means of obtaining knowledge (in the exercise of\n 9   reasonable diligence the facts could not have been discovered at\n10   an earlier date); [and] (c) how and when he did actually discover\n11   the [claim].”   Migliori v. Boeing N. Am., Inc., 114 F. Supp. 2d\n12   976, 982 (C.D. Cal. 2000) (citations and internal quotation marks\n13   omitted).\n14        Betancourt contends that the bankruptcy court erred when it\n15   held that, notwithstanding their obligation to exercise\n16   reasonable diligence, Matthew and Paul did not have reason to\n17   discover the fraudulent nature of the transfers until they\n18   actually did in July 2011 – nearly seven years after the\n19   December 2004 recordation of the conveyances transferring away\n20   La Fe’s real property.   In so holding, the bankruptcy court\n21   determined that the 2004 recordation of the conveyances did not\n22   put the Ballmers on constructive notice or give them actual\n23   knowledge of the fraudulent nature of the transfers.   As a matter\n24   of California law, we agree with the bankruptcy court that the\n25   recordation did not put the Ballmers – as judgment creditors – on\n26   constructive notice.   See Cal. Civ. Code § 1213 (stating that\n27   recordation only puts “subsequent purchasers and mortgagees” on\n28   constructive notice); cf. McCabe v. Grey, 20 Cal. 509, 516 (1862)\n\n                                     22\n\f 1   (construing predecessor statute and holding that “the only effect\n 2   of recording a conveyance is to impart notice to subsequent\n 3   purchasers and mortgagees.”).\n 4        As a factual matter, there was nothing clearly erroneous\n 5   about the bankruptcy court’s finding that the Ballmers had acted\n 6   in a reasonably diligent manner even though they failed to\n 7   discover earlier the fraudulent nature of the transfers.      As the\n 8   court explained, the Ballmers, as judgment creditors, were not\n 9   obliged to conduct any sort of inquiry into La Fe’s real property\n10   assets or to aggressively attempt to enforce their judgment\n11   against La Fe.   California law grants judgment creditors an\n12   initial right to enforce a judgment for a period of ten years,\n13   with an option to renew the judgment thereafter.       See Cal. Civ.\n14   Proc. Code §§ 683.020; 683.110.\n15        Moreover, it is not uncommon, in California, to simply\n16   record an abstract of judgment and then wait for the judgment\n17   debtor to attempt to sell or hypothecate his or her real property\n18   in order to collect on a judgment.     See generally   Cal. Prac.\n19   Guide Enf. J. & Debt §§ 6:150, et seq. (The Rutter Group eds.\n20   2017) (describing numerous practical advantages of using a\n21   recorded abstract of judgment as a judgment enforcement device).\n22   As set forth in the record, Paul recorded an abstract of judgment\n23   shortly after he obtained the judgment against La Fe.      On this\n24   record, the Ballmers were not required to do anything more in\n25   order to act diligently with respect to their judgment against\n26   La Fe.\n27        Thus, we reject all of Betancourt’s arguments related to the\n28   bankruptcy court’s application of the discovery rule in favor of\n\n                                       23\n\f 1   Matthew.   Given that none of Betancourt’s arguments on appeal\n 2   have any merit, we will AFFIRM.\n 3                               CONCLUSION\n 4        For the reasons set forth above, the bankruptcy court’s\n 5   amended judgment on remand is AFFIRMED.\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n\n                                       24\n\f",

BAP Rule 8024-1.\n\f 1                              INTRODUCTION\n 2        On remand from this Panel, the bankruptcy court determined\n 3   that chapter 71 debtor Ana Beatriz Betancourt’s fraudulent\n 4   transfer scheme caused plaintiff Matthew Ballmer’s predecessor in\n 5   interest to suffer an injury giving rise to a legally cognizable\n 6   claim that could result in a money judgment.   Based on this\n 7   determination and others, the bankruptcy court held – for the\n 8   second time – that Betancourt’s debt to Matthew arose from “a\n 9   willful and malicious injury to another entity” within the\n10   meaning of § 523(a)(6), and the bankruptcy court entered an\n11   amended judgment after remand in favor of Matthew.\n12        Betancourt now appeals for the second time.   As this Panel\n13   directed in its disposition of Betancourt’s first appeal, the\n14   bankruptcy court duly identified a legally cognizable claim that\n15   could result in a money judgment in support of its § 523(a)(6)\n16   judgment.   None of the points Betancourt raises on appeal justify\n17   reversal.   Accordingly, we AFFIRM.\n18                                  FACTS\n19        Our prior decision, Betancourt v. Ballmer\n20   (In re Betancourt), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3500322</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Mem. Dec.) (9th Cir. BAP\n21   June 3, 2015), laid out the pertinent facts in great detail.    We\n22   will revisit only those facts necessary to set the stage for this\n23   second decision.\n24        Matthew is the son of Paul Ballmer and is the successor by\n25\n          1\n26         Unless specified otherwise, all chapter and section\n     references are to the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §§ 101-1532, and\n27   all \"Rule\" references are to the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy\n     Procedure, Rules 1001-9037. All \"Civil Rule\" references are to\n28   the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\n                                      2\n\f 1   assignment to Paul’s interest in a judgment debt against La Fe,\n 2   Inc. – Betancourt’s wholly-owned corporation.2   Paul obtained\n 3   this judgment by default when neither Betancourt nor La Fe’s\n 4   counsel of record Robert Rein appeared for the duly scheduled\n 5   trial set in Paul’s contract action against La Fe.\n 6        Betancourt strenuously complained in the bankruptcy court\n 7   that this state court judgment was unjust, but neither she nor\n 8   Rein made any effort either to have it set aside or to appeal it.\n 9   Instead, at the time of the December 2004 trial and immediately\n10   thereafter, Betancourt, her significant other, Calvin Larson, and\n11   Rein were busy perfecting a series of transfers that effectively\n12   stripped La Fe of its only assets: vacant land located in\n13   Topanga, California.   In our prior decision, we generally\n14   identified this land as consisting of three parcels and referred\n15   to them as parcel 30-7, parcel 30-10 and parcel 27-29.\n16   A.   Parcel 30-7\n17        On behalf of La Fe, Betancourt conveyed parcel 30-7 from\n18   La Fe to Rein as an individual.   The 30-7 grant deed was dated\n19   October 2, 2002, but was not recorded until July 2004, well after\n20   Paul had commenced his 2003 state court contract action.\n21        Rein supposedly paid $200,000 cash for parcel 30-7, but the\n22   evidence in the record indicates that these funds never made it\n23   to La Fe.   In fact, Betancourt admitted at trial that La Fe had\n24   no bank account in which to deposit any consideration paid.\n25\n26\n27\n          2\n           We refer to Matthew and Paul by their first names for the\n28   sake of clarity. No disrespect is intended.\n\n                                       3\n\f 1   B.   Parcel 30-10\n 2            Betancourt conveyed parcel 30-10 from La Fe to Rein’s\n 3   wholly owned corporation, Racada Corp.     Like the 30-7 deed, the\n 4   30-10 deed was dated October 2, 2002, and was executed by\n 5   Betancourt on behalf of La Fe.     Unlike the 30-7 deed, the 30-10\n 6   deed was not recorded until December 20, 2004 – the week after\n 7   Betancourt failed to appear for the state court trial.\n 8        The only “consideration” Racada ever gave for parcel 30-10\n 9   was a promise to pay $100,000 secured by a deed of trust naming\n10   Larson as the beneficiary.3    Whereas the 30-10 deed was dated\n11   October 2, 2002, the Racada deed of trust was not executed until\n12   December 10, 2004 (a few days before the state court trial) and\n13   was not recorded until December 20, 2004 (the same day as the\n14   30-10 deed was recorded).     Neither Racada nor Rein ever made any\n15   payment on the missing note.     In February 2007, Rein executed, on\n16   behalf of Racada, an assignment of deed of trust purporting to\n17   assign the beneficial interest under the 30-10 deed of trust to\n18   Betancourt, even though the holder of the beneficial interest\n19   supposedly was Larson.     At the bankruptcy court trial held in\n20   December 2013, neither Betancourt nor Rein were able explain how\n21   Racada as the trustor could convey the beneficial interest in the\n22   30-10 deed of trust from Larson to Betancourt.     Even so,\n23   Betancourt substituted in a new trustee in 2007, and in 2008 the\n24   new trustee executed a trustee’s deed upon sale conveying title\n25   to Betancourt.     Betancourt is identified in the trustee’s deed as\n26\n          3\n27         It is not clear from the record who held the promissory\n     note or who was named as payee in the promissory note. The note\n28   apparently never was produced in discovery or presented at trial.\n\n                                        4\n\f 1   the foreclosing beneficiary for a credit bid of roughly $124,000\n 2   – the full amount of the debt Racada allegedly owed.\n 3   C.   Parcel 27-29\n 4        On behalf of La Fe, Betancourt conveyed parcel 27-29 to\n 5   Larson.4   The 27-29 grant deed is dated March 27, 1998, but was\n 6   not recorded until December 20, 2004 – at the same time the 30-10\n 7   grant deed and trust deed were recorded.    Inexplicably, in\n 8   October 1998 Larson recorded a deed of trust covering some of the\n 9   same parcels.    The 27-29 deed of trust was dated February 15,\n10   1992, was executed by Betancourt on behalf of La Fe and named\n11   Larson as beneficiary.    If Larson already owned parcel 27-29 per\n12   the 27-29 grant deed executed on March 27, 1998, why would Larson\n13   have needed to record in October 1998 the 27-29 deed of trust?\n14        Betancourt’s attempts to explain these transactions did not\n15   clarify matters.    At times she indicated that Larson really owned\n16   parcel 27-29; at other times she indicated that parcel 27-29\n17   secured roughly $500,000 in “loans” Larson made, which enabled\n18   La Fe to purchase and pay some of the expenses of parcel 27-29;\n19   and at other times she indicated that Larson’s $500,000\n20   constituted a capital investment in La Fe.    Nor was Betancourt\n21   able to explain why, in December 2004, she executed and recorded\n22   a quitclaim deed conveying any interest she had as an individual\n23   in parcel 27-29 to Larson.\n24        In 2007, Larson conveyed parcel 27-29 to Betancourt for no\n25   consideration.    Thus, the net effect of all of the transfer\n26\n27\n          4\n           At least for property tax purposes, what we refer to as\n28   parcel 27-29 actually consists of multiple distinct parcels.\n\n                                       5\n\f 1   documents recorded between 2004 and 2008 was the transfer of all\n 2   three parcels away from La Fe; parcels 30-10 and 27-29 ended up\n 3   in Betancourt’s hands – without her (or anyone else) having paid\n 4   any consideration to La Fe for these transfers.\n 5   D.   The Bankruptcy Court’s First Decision And This Panel’s First\n 6   Decision\n 7        Looking at the timing and nature of the above-referenced\n 8   transactions, the bankruptcy court concluded after a one-day\n 9   trial in December 2013 that Betancourt engaged in a “flurry of\n10   activity” in December 2004 to transfer out of La Fe all of its\n11   assets.    The bankruptcy court found that Betancourt undertook\n12   these actions for the specific purpose of preventing Paul from\n13   collecting from La Fe’s assets any judgment he obtained.    The\n14   bankruptcy court further found that there was no evidence of any\n15   consideration paid by Larson for parcel 27-29.    With respect to\n16   parcel 30-10, the bankruptcy court found that La Fe did not\n17   receive any consideration for this property and that Rein had\n18   served as a “straw man” to enable Betancourt to strip this asset\n19   from La Fe.5\n20        According to the bankruptcy court, the evidence demonstrated\n21   that, before Betancourt transferred them away, La Fe had equity\n22   in each of the above-referenced parcels: $200,000 in parcel 30-7;\n23   $100,000 in 30-10; and $100,000 in parcel 27-29.    Based on all of\n24\n25        5\n           The bankruptcy court opined that parcel 30-7 was not part\n26   of Betancourt’s scheme to denude La Fe of assets because the\n     evidence demonstrated that Rein actually paid $200,000 for this\n27   property. The bankruptcy court did not make any finding\n     regarding the disposition of the $200,000 in sale proceeds, but\n28   it is fairly clear that La Fe never received them.\n\n                                       6\n\f 1   the above, the bankruptcy court held that Matthew had suffered a\n 2   willful and malicious injury within the meaning of § 523(a)(6).\n 3         Betancourt appealed the bankruptcy court’s December 2013\n 4   judgment, and this Panel issued a decision in June 2015 remanding\n 5   the matter to the bankruptcy court for additional findings.\n 6   Among other things, we said that the bankruptcy court needed to\n 7   make a finding on Betancourt’s subjective state of mind – whether\n 8   she subjectively intended to injure Paul when she made the\n 9   transfers described above.\n10         In addition, we asked the bankruptcy court to make more\n11   specific findings regarding any injury resulting from\n12   Betancourt’s actions, as follows:\n13   (1)   if the injury was to Paul’s property, identifying the\n14         specific property interest of Paul’s that Betancourt injured\n15         by transferring away La Fe’s assets;\n16   (2)   if the injury was to Paul personally, identifying the\n17         “legally cognizable claim which could result in a monetary\n18         judgment” against Betancourt arising from the injury (citing\n19         Quarre v.

Proceedings on Remand\n28         On remand, the bankruptcy court reviewed the evidence from\n\n                                      7\n\f 1   the December 2013 trial and gave the parties the opportunity to\n 2   present new evidence.   The only new evidence initially presented\n 3   consisted of Betancourt’s additional trial testimony.   However,\n 4   after presentation of the supplemental trial testimony, the\n 5   bankruptcy court issued an order asking the parties to present\n 6   evidence on two new issues: (1) when Paul and Matthew first\n 7   actually discovered Betancourt’s transfers of La Fe’s assets; and\n 8   (2) “when it would have been reasonable to discover the\n 9   transfers.”\n10        In response to this order, Paul filed a declaration stating\n11   that he did not actually learn of the transfers until July 2011.\n12   Paul explained that he recorded an abstract of judgment in\n13   February 2005 and that he thought the resulting judgment lien\n14   against La Fe’s real property eventually would result in the\n15   satisfaction of his judgment.   Paul further explained that health\n16   issues prevented him from making any further judgment enforcement\n17   efforts until July 2011, when he discovered the transfers after\n18   conducting a routine title search.\n19        In spite of the clear language in the bankruptcy court’s\n20   February 2016 order directing both Paul and Matthew to file\n21   declarations, Matthew did not file any declaration.   Betancourt\n22   filed her own declaration in response to Paul’s declaration\n23   contending that, even if Paul did not actually know of the\n24   transfers, he reasonably should have known of them much earlier\n25   than 2011 – as all of them were evidenced by recorded documents\n26   in the public record.   Betancourt further complained that, in\n27   contravention of the bankruptcy court’s order, Matthew had not\n28   submitted a declaration and had not presented any evidence\n\n                                      8\n\f 1   regarding when he actually learned of the transfers or the reason\n 2   why he had not discovered the transfers earlier.\n 3        Matthew filed a reply addressing the points made in\n 4   Betancourt’s declaration.     Matthew essentially argued that Paul’s\n 5   declaration sufficed to address the issues raised by the\n 6   bankruptcy court in its February 2016 order.\n 7   F.   The Bankruptcy Court’s First Decision On Remand\n 8        Based on all of the above evidence, the bankruptcy court\n 9   found that Betancourt carried out her scheme of transfers of\n10   La Fe’s property with the intent to harm Paul by stripping La Fe\n11   of assets from which his judgment could be satisfied.\n12        As for the issues regarding the nature and extent of Paul’s\n13   injury, the bankruptcy court determined that there was no injury\n14   to any property interest of Paul’s; however, according to the\n15   court, Paul was personally injured by Betancourt’s scheme of\n16   transfers.     And that injury, the bankruptcy court opined,\n17   constituted a legally cognizable claim which could result in a\n18   monetary judgment against Betancourt.     Citing Cal Civ.

By 2008, the\n 5   bankruptcy court pointed out, Betancourt ended up holding legal\n 6   title to both parcel 30-10 and parcel 27-29, and she did not\n 7   qualify for the good faith transferee safe harbors set forth in\n 8   § 3439.08(b)(1)(B).7\n 9        The bankruptcy court also determined the amount of the\n10   nondischargeable debt.     Based on the value of parcels 30-10 and\n11   27-29 ($100,000 each) and the amount of debt the Ballmers were\n12   prevented from collecting as a result of Betancourt’s actually\n13   fraudulent transfers ($85,626), the bankruptcy court concluded\n14   that Matthew held a potential monetary claim for $85,626, plus\n15   interest, under Cal. Civ. Code §§ 3439.04(a)(1) and\n16   3439.08(b)(2).     According to the bankruptcy court, this claim\n17   arose from a willful and malicious injury within the meaning of\n18   § 523(a)(6).\n19        But the bankruptcy court concluded that Matthew did not\n20   actually have a legally cognizable claim for monetary damages\n21\n          6\n22            (...continued)\n                  (B) An immediate or mediate transferee of the first\n23                transferee, other than either of the following:\n\n24                (i) A good faith transferee that took for value.\n25                (ii) An immediate or mediate good faith transferee of a\n26                person described in clause (i).\n          7\n27         Neither Betancourt nor Larson ever obtained title to parcel\n     30-7, so the bankruptcy court did not consider that parcel as\n28   part of its assessment of the injury to Paul.\n\n                                       10\n\f 1   that could be excepted from discharge under § 523(a)(6) given\n 2   that the Ballmers had failed to demonstrate that their claim was\n 3   not time barred under the applicable statute of limitations.\n 4   Because the Ballmers sought to avail themselves of the “discovery\n 5   rule” set forth in § 3439.09(a),8 and because plaintiffs invoking\n 6   this discovery rule bear the burden of proof to establish their\n 7   entitlement to apply it, the bankruptcy court held that Matthew’s\n 8   failure to submit a declaration regarding when he actually\n 9   discovered the transfers was fatal to both the fraudulent\n10   transfer claim and, in turn, his nondischargeability claim.9\n11   G.   Matthew’s Motion For Relief From Judgment And The Bankruptcy\n12        Court’s Amended Judgment On Remand\n13        After the bankruptcy court entered its judgment upon remand,\n14   Matthew filed a motion pursuant to Rules 9023 and 9024 seeking\n15\n          8\n16            This section provides in relevant part:\n17                A cause of action with respect to a transfer\n                  or obligation under this chapter is\n18\n                  extinguished unless action is brought . . .\n19\n                  (a) Under paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of\n20                Section 3439.04, not later than four years\n                  after the transfer was made or the obligation\n21                was incurred or, if later, not later than one\n22                year after the transfer or obligation was or\n                  could reasonably have been discovered by the\n23                claimant.\n          9\n24         On the other hand, the bankruptcy court concluded that\n     there was sufficient evidence in the record for it to conclude\n25   that neither of the Ballmers reasonably should have discovered\n26   the transfers (and their fraudulent nature) before Paul actually\n     discovered them in 2011. Thus, had Matthew filed a declaration\n27   establishing that he did not actually discover the the fraudulent\n     transfers before Paul did, the Ballmers would have prevailed on\n28   the statute of limitations issue.\n\n                                       11\n\f 1   retrial or relief from judgment.      Matthew asserted that his\n 2   failure to file a declaration regarding when he actually\n 3   discovered Betancourt’s transfers was the result of his counsel’s\n 4   misreading of the bankruptcy court’s order and had resulted in a\n 5   miscarriage of justice.   In his accompanying declaration, Matthew\n 6   explained that he took the assignment of the judgment from his\n 7   father in 2007 only because of his father’s health issues and\n 8   that the only knowledge he (Matthew) had regarding the subject\n 9   transfers was the information he received from his father, which\n10   his father shared with him after he discovered the transfers in\n11   July 2011.\n12        In her opposition to Matthew’s motion, Betancourt argued\n13   that the language in the February 2016 order was more than clear\n14   regarding what evidence was necessary and that Matthew should not\n15   be permitted under either Rule 9023 or Rule 9024 to present\n16   evidence that was clearly available to him well before the\n17   court’s decision and judgment.\n18        The bankruptcy court held that Matthew was entitled to\n19   relief from judgment.   Even though Matthew’s motion did not focus\n20   on excusable neglect as a ground for relief, the bankruptcy court\n21   ruled that Matthew’s counsel’s excusable neglect supported the\n22   granting of relief under Civil Rule 60(b)(1) (which is made\n23   applicable in bankruptcy cases and adversary proceedings by\n24   Rule 9024).

Intent Finding\n21        Betancourt, first, challenges the bankruptcy court’s finding\n22   that she conducted the fraudulent transfers with the subjective\n23   intent to injure Paul.   An injury only is “willful” if the debtor\n24   subjectively intended to cause injury or “actually believed that\n25\n          10\n26         Assignees of a debt, like Matthew, typically can pursue\n     the same nondischargeability claims as would have been available\n27   to their assignor.

The timing and nature of the transfer of La Fe’s real\n 6   property, first, away from La Fe and, later, into Betancourt’s\n 7   hands is suggestive of an intent to injure Paul.   Moreover, the\n 8   bankruptcy court found not credible Betancourt’s attempts to\n 9   offer alternate explanations for the transfers.\n10        On appeal, Betancourt contends that, because Larson and\n11   Racada gave consideration for the transfers they received, she\n12   could not have made the transfers with the intent to injure Paul.\n13   As a preliminary matter, it is far from clear that either the\n14   so-called antecedent debt owed to Larson or Racada’s note and\n15   deed of trust constituted any consideration to La Fe.   The\n16   bankruptcy court found to the contrary, that La Fe received no\n17   consideration for the transfer of parcel 30-10 or for the\n18   transfer of parcel 27-29.   And the record supports this finding.\n19        But even if we were to hold that La Fe did receive some\n20   consideration, or received reasonably equivalent value, this\n21   would not justify reversal of the bankruptcy court’s intent\n22   finding.    The bankruptcy court’s intent finding was based on the\n23   entirety of the circumstances and the presence or absence of\n24   consideration was only one of a number of factors the bankruptcy\n25   court considered.   We cannot say that, given the nature and\n26   timing of Betancourt’s transfers of La Fe’s properties, the\n27   ostensible presence of some consideration precluded a finding\n28   that Betancourt subjectively intended to injure Paul.\n\n                                      15\n\f 1        Our analysis is bolstered by the law governing actually\n 2   fraudulent transfers under Cal. Civ. Code § 3439.04(a)(1).     The\n 3   absence of reasonably equivalent value is not a prerequisite to\n 4   finding that a debtor made a transfer with the actual intent to\n 5   hinder, delay, or defraud her creditors.    In re Ezra, 537 B.R. at\n 6   930 (citing Wolkowitz v. Beverly (In re Beverly), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1550663\"><a href=\"/opinion/1550663/in-re-beverly/\"><span class=\"volume\">374</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">221</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n 7   235 (9th Cir.

Indeed, the presence or absence of reasonably\n 9   equivalent value is just one of several factors courts typically\n10   consider when assessing whether the debtor had the requisite\n11   state of mind to commit an actual fraudulent transfer.    See Cal.\n12   Civ. Code § 3439.04(b) (listing factors); see also In re Ezra,\n13   537 B.R. at 930-31 (explaining that these factors – also known as\n14   badges of fraud – are not prerequisites and should not be applied\n15   formulaically).\n16        In short, the bankruptcy court’s intent finding was\n17   adequately supported by the record and the asserted presence of\n18   consideration for the subject transfers does not render the\n19   bankruptcy court’s intent finding clearly erroneous.\n20   B.   Type Of Injury\n21        Our prior decision required the bankruptcy court, on remand,\n22   to determine whether the nature of the injury to Paul resulting\n23   from Betancourt’s willful and malicious conduct would give rise\n24   to a legally cognizable claim for damages under California law.\n25   In re Betancourt, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3500322</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *7 (citing In re Saylor,\n26   178 B.R. at 213–214).    The bankruptcy court on remand duly\n27   determined that, as a result of her willful and malicious\n28   conduct, Betancourt had transferee liability under Cal Civ. Code\n\n                                       16\n\f 1   § 3439.08(b)(1).\n 2        In making this determination, the bankruptcy court cited in\n 3   support In re Bammer, 131 F.3d at 790.   In Bammer, a son\n 4   attempted to help his mother evade the consequences of her\n 5   embezzlement by implementing a fraudulent transfer scheme\n 6   designed to strip her of the remaining equity in her residence.\n 7   Steven Bammer carried out this scheme by taking out a loan\n 8   secured by a third mortgage against his mother’s house.     The\n 9   Ninth Circuit court of appeals held that the injury caused by\n10   Steven Bammer’s instigation and receipt of the fraudulent\n11   transfer was a willful and malicious injury that gave rise to a\n12   nondischargeable debt under § 523(a)(6).\n13        Betancourt attacks on appeal the bankruptcy court’s reliance\n14   on Bammer.   Betancourt argues that Bammer is distinguishable\n15   because, unlike in Bammer, Larson and Racada gave consideration\n16   for the transfers of parcels 30-10 and 27-29.   More specifically,\n17   Betancourt contends that, in light of the consideration La Fe\n18   allegedly received, no actionable injury to Paul occurred under\n19   the fraudulent transfer statutes.\n20        As we explained above, however, the bankruptcy court found\n21   that La Fe received no consideration for the transfers, and the\n22   record supports this finding.   Consequently, Betancourt’s attempt\n23   to distinguish Bammer is unavailing.\n24        In any event, the bankruptcy court’s determination that Paul\n25   had a legally cognizable monetary claim against Betancourt under\n26   California law did not hinge on Bammer or on the presence or\n27   absence of consideration; instead, the determination hinged on\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span>   <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.</span> <span class=\"page\">Civ</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.

Simply put, this\n 7   California fraudulent transfer statute established Paul’s right\n 8   to a monetary damages claim against Betancourt arising from her\n 9   receipt of the fraudulently transferred property.\n10        Betancourt alternately argues that there was no evidence in\n11   the record of the value of the transferred property and that she\n12   could not have any fraudulent transfer liability without evidence\n13   of such value.   Under the above-referenced California statute,\n1</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span>   <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.</span> <span class=\"page\">Civ</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Code § 3439.08(b)(1), damages against the transferee\n15   are, indeed, limited to the value of the property transferred or\n16   the amount of the creditor’s claim, whichever is less.   However,\n17   as a factual matter, Betancourt’s alternate argument lacks merit.\n18   The bankruptcy court found that, at the time of the transfer,\n19   La Fe had equity in each of the transferred parcels: $100,000 in\n20   30-10 and $100,000 in parcel 27-29.   And there was sufficient\n21   evidence in the record to support this finding.   The aggregate\n22   value of these two properties – $200,000 – exceeded the amount\n23   Paul was owed, so the value of the properties did not limit the\n24   amount of Paul’s monetary claim against Betancourt or the amount\n25   nondischargeable under § 523(a)(6).\n26        In short, we reject all of Betancourt’s theories on appeal\n27   attempting to explain why Paul did not suffer the type of injury\n28\n\n                                     18\n\f 1   covered by § 523(a)(6).11\n 2   C.

At oral argument before this Panel, Betancourt\n     acknowledged her concession in the bankruptcy court that an\n27   actual fraudulent transfer action under California law qualifies\n     as an intentional tort. Nor has Betancourt attempted to withdraw\n28   this concession on appeal.\n\n                                     19\n\f 1   challenged on appeal the bankruptcy court’s specific Pioneer\n 2   findings.    Instead, she argues that, as a matter of law,\n 3   Matthew’s “mistake” was beyond the scope of Civil Rule 60(b)\n 4   excusable neglect relief.    As Betancourt put it, Matthew’s\n 5   counsel’s noncompliance with the clear and unequivocal language\n 6   of the bankruptcy court’s order directing both Matthew and Paul\n 7   to file additional evidence on the discovery rule issue “cannot\n 8   be grounds to grant” a motion for relief based on excusable\n 9   neglect.    In support of this contention, Betancourt relies on\n10   Engleson v. Burlington Northern Railroad Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"588899\"><a href=\"/opinion/588899/jerry-l-engleson-steven-a-braaten-kathryne-e-pike-joseph-m-corcoran/\"><span class=\"volume\">972</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1038</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th\n11   Cir. 1992), but Betancourt’s reliance on Engleson is misplaced.\n12   Engleson was decided before Pioneer.    Subsequent to Pioneer, the\n13   Ninth Circuit has clarified that counsel error in responding to\n14   directives in court orders and rules is not per se excluded from\n15   excusable neglect relief.    See Pincay, 389 F.3d at 859.\n16        Betancourt also attempts to argue that the excusable neglect\n17   standard was inapplicable because Matthew did not demonstrate the\n18   existence of any neglect or error.    Instead, Betancourt claims,\n19   Matthew made an affirmative strategic decision not to present\n20   into evidence his own declaration, and an intentional, calculated\n21   failure to present sufficient evidence in support of an issue on\n22   which Matthew bore the burden of proof is not the type of conduct\n23   that should be addressed by way of an excusable neglect motion.\n24        We might have considered this argument more persuasive but\n25   for the unusual procedural history pertaining to the presentation\n26   of evidence on the discovery rule issue.    Recall that the\n27   bankruptcy court issued an order after the close of evidence on\n28   remand raising the discovery rule issue and directing the parties\n\n                                      20\n\f 1   to present additional evidence.    This order provided in part as\n 2   follows:\n 3        The parties will have a period of time to do discovery\n          and present evidence of the date(s) when either of the\n 4        Ballmers or their agents did or should reasonably have\n          discovered the transfers. This can be by way of\n 5        declaration, interrogatory, deposition, or other\n          evidence. The Court will review the evidence and\n 6        determine whether a further evidentiary hearing is\n          required.\n 7\n 8   Order To Provide Further Evidence (February 16, 2016) at 4:5-10.\n 9        Based on this language and other language in its order, the\n10   bankruptcy court found that its order was ambiguous and that the\n11   ambiguity had caused Matthew’s counsel to misinterpret what was\n12   required.    The bankruptcy court further found, in terms of\n13   assessing the reason for Matthew’s counsel’s error, that it\n14   resulted from this misinterpretation – and not from any strategic\n15   decision to withhold evidence as Betancourt asserted.    We cannot\n16   say that the bankruptcy court’s findings regarding the reason for\n17   Matthew’s counsel’s error were clearly erroneous.    Nor can we say\n18   that its other findings on the Pioneer factors – lack of\n19   prejudice to Betancourt, the limited amount of delay caused by\n20   Matthew’s error and the Ballmers’ good faith – were clearly\n21   erroneous.\n22        Accordingly, the bankruptcy court did not abuse its\n23   discretion in granting Matthew’s motion for relief based on\n24   excusable neglect.\n25        Betancourt also challenges on appeal the bankruptcy court’s\n26   determination that Matthew met his burden of proof to establish\n27   the applicability of the discovery rule in order to extend the\n28   fraudulent transfer statute of limitation.    More specifically,\n\n                                       21\n\f 1   Betancourt challenges the bankruptcy court’s finding that Matthew\n 2   and his father Paul had acted diligently despite their failure to\n 3   earlier discover the fraudulent nature of Betancourt’s transfers.\n 4   The bankruptcy court correctly found Matthew bore the burden of\n 5   proof on this issue.

Cal. 2000) (citations and internal quotation marks\n13   omitted).\n14        Betancourt contends that the bankruptcy court erred when it\n15   held that, notwithstanding their obligation to exercise\n16   reasonable diligence, Matthew and Paul did not have reason to\n17   discover the fraudulent nature of the transfers until they\n18   actually did in July 2011 – nearly seven years after the\n19   December 2004 recordation of the conveyances transferring away\n20   La Fe’s real property.   In so holding, the bankruptcy court\n21   determined that the 2004 recordation of the conveyances did not\n22   put the Ballmers on constructive notice or give them actual\n23   knowledge of the fraudulent nature of the transfers.   As a matter\n24   of California law, we agree with the bankruptcy court that the\n25   recordation did not put the Ballmers – as judgment creditors – on\n26   constructive notice.   See Cal. Civ. Code § 1213 (stating that\n27   recordation only puts “subsequent purchasers and mortgagees” on\n28   constructive notice); cf. McCabe v. Grey, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.</span> <span class=\"page\">509</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 516 (1862)\n\n                                     22\n\f 1   (construing predecessor statute and holding that “the only effect\n 2   of recording a conveyance is to impart notice to subsequent\n 3   purchasers and mortgagees.”).\n 4        As a factual matter, there was nothing clearly erroneous\n 5   about the bankruptcy court’s finding that the Ballmers had acted\n 6   in a reasonably diligent manner even though they failed to\n 7   discover earlier the fraudulent nature of the transfers.      As the\n 8   court explained, the Ballmers, as judgment creditors, were not\n 9   obliged to conduct any sort of inquiry into La Fe’s real property\n10   assets or to aggressively attempt to enforce their judgment\n11   against La Fe.   California law grants judgment creditors an\n12   initial right to enforce a judgment for a period of ten years,\n13   with an option to renew the judgment thereafter.       See Cal. Civ.\n14   Proc. Code §§ 683.020; 683.110.\n15        Moreover, it is not uncommon, in California, to simply\n16   record an abstract of judgment and then wait for the judgment\n17   debtor to attempt to sell or hypothecate his or her real property\n18   in order to collect on a judgment.     See generally   Cal. Prac.\n19   Guide Enf. J. & Debt §§ 6:150, et seq. (The Rutter Group eds.\n20   2017) (describing numerous practical advantages of using a\n21   recorded abstract of judgment as a judgment enforcement device).\n22   As set forth in the record, Paul recorded an abstract of judgment\n23   shortly after he obtained the judgment against La Fe.      On this\n24   record, the Ballmers were not required to do anything more in\n25   order to act diligently with respect to their judgment against\n26   La Fe.\n27        Thus, we reject all of Betancourt’s arguments related to the\n28   bankruptcy court’s application of the discovery rule in favor of\n\n                                       23\n\f 1   Matthew.   Given that none of Betancourt’s arguments on appeal\n 2   have any merit, we will AFFIRM.\n 3                               CONCLUSION\n 4        For the reasons set forth above, the bankruptcy court’s\n 5   amended judgment on remand is AFFIRMED.\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n\n                                       24\n\f</pre>",
