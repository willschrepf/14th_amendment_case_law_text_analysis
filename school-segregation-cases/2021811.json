Appellant-Buck Green, who is black, raises the principal question of whether this policy violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e et seq.  (Supp.  II, 1972) and 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1981 (1970), because this practice allegedly operates to disqualify blacks for employment at a substantially higher rate than whites and is not job related.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Green on his own behalf and as a class action filed this suit November 7, 1972, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief as well as back pay.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The district court denied Green relief on his individual claim and that of the class.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Green brings this timely appeal.  We outline the undisputed facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 29, 1970, Green, then 29 years of age, applied for employment as a clerk at MoPac's personnel office in the corporate headquarters in St. Louis, Missouri.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  In response to a question on an application form, Green disclosed that he had been convicted in December 1967 for refusing military induction.  He stated that he had served 21 months in prison until paroled on July 24, 1970.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  After reviewing the application form, MoPac's personnel officer informed Green that he was not qualified for employment at MoPac because of his conviction and prison record.  Green, thereafter, sought relief under Title VII, and, when administrative conciliation failed, he brought this action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since 1948, MoPac has followed the policy of disqualifying for employment any applicant with a conviction for any crime other than a minor traffic offense.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Prior to 1972, MoPac also investigated an applicant's arrest record, but after the decision in Gregory v. Litton Systems, Inc., 472 F.2d 631 (9th Cir. 1972), MoPac eliminated any arrest inquiry from its application form and ceased using arrest records as an employment criterion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Green makes the following contentions on this appeal: (1) MoPac's policy of not hiring any person convicted of a criminal offense has a racially discriminatory effect and violates Title VII; (2) this policy is not justified by any business necessity; and (3) the district court erred in restricting the class only to black persons denied employment consideration because of a conviction record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>I. Whether Green proved a prima facie case of discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the employment practice in question is facially neutral, an employment test or practice which operates to exclude a disproportionate percentage of blacks violates Title VII unless the employer can establish that the practice is justified as a business necessity.  Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 431, 91 S.Ct. 849, 28 L.Ed.2d 158 (1971); see Boston Chapter N.A.A.C.P., Inc. v. Beecher, 504 F.2d 1017, 1019 (1st Cir. 1974); Wallace v. Debron Corp., 494 F.2d 674, 675 (8th Cir. 1974); United States v. Georgia Power Co., 474 F.2d 906, 911 (5th Cir. 1973); Gregory v. Litton Systems, Inc., 316 F.Supp. 401, 403 (C.D.Cal.1970), aff'd, 472 F.2d 631 (9th Cir. 1972).  Once a prima facie case of substantially disparate impact is made the burden shifts to the employer to justify the employment practice or test as a business necessity.  McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973); Rogers v. International Paper Co., 510 F.2d 1340, 1348-49 (8th Cir. 1975); Rodriguez v. East Texas Motor Freight, 505 F.2d 40, 54 (5th Cir. 1974); Hester v. Southern Ry. Co., 497 F.2d 1374, 1381 (5th Cir. 1974).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, we examine the threshold question of whether Green has presented a prima facie case.  A disproportionate racial impact may be established statistically in any of three ways.  The first procedure considers whether blacks as a class (or at least blacks in a specified geographical area) are excluded by the employment practice in question at a substantially higher rate than whites.  See Griggs v. Duke Power Co., supra, 401 U.S. at 430 n. 6, 91 S.Ct. 849, 28 L.Ed.2d 158 (on the requirement of a high school diploma, the Court cited statistics from the U. S. Census Bureau that in North Carolina only 12 percent of black males had completed high school while 34 percent of white males had done so); United States v. Georgia Power Co., 474 F.2d 906, 918 (5th Cir. 1973) (the court cited statistics from the South and from the Atlanta area showing that a substantially higher percentage of whites had completed high school than blacks); Gregory v. Litton Systems, Inc., 316 F.Supp. 401, 403 (C.D.Cal.1970), aff'd, 472 F.2d 631 (9th Cir. 1972) (the court cited national arrest statistics showing that blacks suffered a disproportionately high percentage of arrests); Johnson v. Pike Corp., 332 F.Supp. 490, 494 (C.D.Cal.1971) (the court cited general studies indicating that blacks' wages were garnished at a disproportionately high rate).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second procedure focuses on a comparison of the percentage of black and white job applicants actually excluded by the employment practice or test of the particular company or governmental agency in question.  See Griggs v. Duke Power Co., supra, 401 U.S. at 430 n. 6, 91 S.Ct. 849, 28 L.Ed.2d 158; Vulcan Society of the New York City Fire Dept. v. Civil Service Comm. of the City of New York, 490 F.2d 387, 392 (2d Cir. 1973); Bridgeport Guard, Inc. v. Members of the Bridgeport Civil Service Comm., 482 F.2d 1333, 1335 (2d Cir. 1973); cf. Rogers v. International Paper Co., supra, 510 F.2d at 1348-49.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, a third procedure examines the level of employment of blacks by the company or governmental agency in comparison to the percentage of blacks in the relevant geographical area.  See Bridgeport Guard, Inc. v. Members of the Bridgeport Civil Service Comm., supra, 482 F.2d at 1335-36; United States v. Georgia Power Co., supra, 474 F.2d at 910; Butts v. Nichols, 381 F.Supp. 573, 579 (S.D.Ia.1974) (three-judge court); Cf.  Rodriguez v. East Texas Motor Freight, supra, 505 F.2d at 54-55.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Green alleged that MoPac discriminates against blacks generally in its employment practices, the district court focused only on whether a disparate impact could be statistically demonstrated by MoPac's policy of automatically rejecting all applicants with a conviction for an offense other than minor traffic infractions.  Here, we consider a sweeping disqualification of all persons with a past record of some unlawful behavior, See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, supra, 411 U.S. at 806, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668, rather than a test directed at a precise measurement of intelligence or skills.  The disparity of impact, if any, will be disclosed by an examination of how that policy affects applicants and potential applicants.  We agree with the approach taken by the district court and primarily limit our statistical analysis to the effect of MoPac's policies against both blacks and whites in the general population in the area from which employees are drawn (metropolitan St. Louis), and the effect of this policy upon black and white applicants for employment with MoPac.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Initially, we note that the district court recognized statistical data and treatises offered into evidence by the plaintiff which indicate that blacks are convicted of crimes at a rate at least two to three times greater than the percentage of blacks in the populations of certain geographical areas.  Dr. Ronald Christensen, a qualified expert witness for the plaintiff, concluded that it is between 2.2 and 6.7 times as likely that a black person will have a criminal conviction record during his lifetime than that a white person will have such a record.  He further concluded that in urban areas from 36.9 percent to 78.1 percent of all black persons would incur a conviction during their lifetimes, but that from only 11.6 percent to 16.8 percent of all white persons would acquire a conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MoPac's records of employment applications at its corporate headquarters during the period from September 1, 1971, through November 7, 1973,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> disclose that 3,282 blacks and 5,206 whites applied for employment.  Of these individuals, 174 blacks (5.3 percent of the black applicants) and 118 whites (2.23 percent of the white applicants) were rejected because of their conviction records.  Thus, statistically, the policy operated automatically to exclude from employment 53 of every 1,000 black applicants but only 22 of every 1,000 white applicants.  The rejection rate for blacks is two and one-half times that of whites under this policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the district court recognized that these statistics denote a disparate impact, the court further compared the number of blacks rejected (174) to the total pool of applicants (8,488)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> and deemed the resulting figure of 2.05 percent as showing a \"De minimis discriminatory effect\" when compared to the percentage of blacks (16 percent) in the St. Louis metropolitan area.  (381 F.Supp. 996.)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court's use of additional statistics supporting a conclusion of a De minimis discriminatory effect suffers from two principal defects.  First, comparing the number of black applicants rejected because of a conviction record to the total number of applicants does not reflect a disparity of impact separately against each race.  Moreover, because more whites than blacks applied for employment (3,282 blacks and 5,206 whites) a comparison of the rejected blacks to the total number of applicants serves to dilute the actual discriminatory impact against blacks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, comparing the resulting percentage of 2.05 against the percent of blacks in the relevant population area is of no assistance for the issue in Title VII cases focuses on whether an employer has discriminated against any individual \"because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\"  42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-2(a)(1).  The issue to be examined statistically is whether the questioned employment practice operates in a disparate manner upon a minority race or group, not whether the individuals actually suffering from a discriminatory practice are statistically large in number.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An employment criterion must be examined for its operation on a racially exclusionary basis thus its effect must be measured upon blacks separately and upon whites separately.  See Griggs v. Duke Power Co., supra, 401 U.S. at 430 n.6, 91 S.Ct. 849, 28 L.Ed.2d 158; United States v. Georgia Power Co.,  supra, 474 F.2d at 918; Gregory v. Litton Systems, Inc., supra,316 F.Supp. at 403; Johnson v. Pike Corp., supra, 332 F.Supp. at 494; Cf. Note, Employment Discrimination: Statistics and Preferences Under Title VII,59 Va.L.Rev. 463, 468 (1973).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statistics established that MoPac's employment practice under consideration disqualifies black applicants or potential black applicants for employment at a substantially higher rate than whites.  Thus, Green has established a prima facie case of discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>II. Is MoPac's employment practice justified by \"Business Necessity?\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once a prima facie case of discrimination has been established, the defendants must show that the employment practice in question is justified by \"business necessity.\"  The seminal decision for business necessity, of course, is Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 91 S.Ct. 849, 28 L.Ed.2d 158 (1971), where the Court, in discussing the reach and intent of equal employment opportunity cases under Title VII said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>The district court's statistical summary is as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <pre>    118  (whites rejected due to conviction)  X 100 = 1.4%\n--------------------------------------------\n  8,488  (total number of applicants)\n    174  (blacks rejected due to conviction)  X 100 = 2.05%\n--------------------------------------------\n  8,488  (total number of applicants)</pre>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>(Title VII) proscribes not only overt discrimination but also practices that are fair in form, but discriminatory in operation.  The touchstone is business necessity.  If an employment practice which operates to exclude Negroes cannot be shown to be related to job performance, the practice is prohibited.  * * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>What is required by Congress is the removal of artificial, arbitrary, and unnecessary barriers to employment when the barriers operate invidiously to discriminate on the basis of racial or other impermissible classification.  (Id. at 431, 91 S.Ct. at 853.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>What Congress has commanded is that any tests used must measure the person for the job and not the person in the abstract.  (Id. at 436, 91 S.Ct. at 856.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Griggs, the Court considered professionally prepared aptitude tests and a requirement of a high school diploma by which the employer sought to measure the skills of the prospective employee to perform the required work.  Here, the employment requirement does not seek to measure technical aptitude or ability but serves as an absolute bar to employment because of some prior unlawful act committed by the applicant.  The Supreme Court, in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), acknowledged a distinction between the employment tests struck down in Griggs standardized testing devices which, however neutral on their face, were not job related and operated to exclude a disproportionate percentage of blacks and the qualification asserted in the McDonnell Douglas case where the applicant for employment, Green, had engaged in a seriously disruptive act against his prospective employer.  Id. at 806, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 1826, 36 L.Ed.2d 668.  But, Justice Powell's opinion for a unanimous court added a caveat to its holding in these words:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>(P)etitioner (McDonnell Douglas) does not seek his (Green's) exclusion on the basis of a testing device which overstates what is necessary for competent performance, or through some Sweeping disqualification of all those with any past record of unlawful behavior, however remote, insubstantial, or unrelated to applicant's personal qualifications as an employee.  (Id. (emphasis added).)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We perceive this comment to suggest that a sweeping disqualification for employment resting solely on past behavior can violate Title VII where that employment practice has a disproportionate racial impact and rests upon a tenuous or insubstantial basis.  Although the Supreme Court has not directly addressed this type of employment qualification, similar employment criteria have been examined and struck down by the courts as discriminatory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Carter v. Gallagher, 452 F.2d 315 (8th Cir. 1971), Cert. denied, 406 U.S. 950, 92 S.Ct. 2045, 32 L.Ed.2d 338 (1972), an En banc court reviewed a decree of the district court relating to the recruitment, examination, and hiring practices in the Minneapolis, Minnesota, Fire Department, which allegedly discriminated against blacks and other minority groups.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The City of Minneapolis had routinely disqualified applicants for the position of fire fighter for a prior felony or misdemeanor conviction.  The district court decree in pertinent part had limited the disqualification to a time period of five years, after a felony conviction or after incarceration had ended and a time period of two years after a misdemeanor conviction or two years after incarceration for such conviction had ended.  The decree had provided further that any rejection of an applicant for employment because of a conviction of a crime must be based on a finding that the applicant's behavior giving rise to the conviction furnished an inference that the applicant could not fulfill the duties of a fire fighter.  Id. at 321.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the parties agreed that a conviction for a felony or misdemeanor should not \"per se constitute an absolute bar to employment.\"  Id. at 326.  In reviewing this part of the decree, we said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p>The trial court in its discretion may require the defendants to submit to it for approval a rule with respect to the consideration to be given to an applicant's conviction record, which at a minimum should not treat conviction as an absolute bar to employment.  We would not consider any rule giving fair consideration to the bearing of the conviction upon applicant's fitness for the fire fighter job to be inappropriate.

Nichols, 381 F.Supp. 573 (S.D.Ia.1974) (three-judge court), the court ruled that a provision of the Iowa Code prohibiting the employment of felons in civil service positions violated the Equal Protection Clause of the fourteenth amendment.  Although the case did not arise under Title VII, the language of the court in discussing the relationship of a conviction to employment is instructive:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p>There is no doubt that the State could logically prohibit and refuse employment in certain positions where the felony conviction would directly reflect on the felon's qualifications for the job (E. g., conviction of embezzlement and a job requiring the handling of large sums of money).  The Iowa statutory scheme, however, has an across-the-board prohibition against the employment of felons in civil service positions.  There is simply no tailoring in an effort to limit these statutes to conform to what might be legitimate state interests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p>(The Iowa provision) suffers from a total lack of such narrowing criteria.  As a result, the statute is both over and under inclusive: persons who clearly could serve the public interest are denied civil service jobs, while misdemeanants convicted of crimes indicating a lack of probity suffer no disqualification.  In short, no consideration is given to the nature and seriousness of the crime in relation to the job sought.

But, as recognized by the district court, MoPac has not empirically validated its policy with respect to conviction records, 381 F.Supp. at 996, nor shown that a less restrictive alternative with a lesser racial impact would not serve as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MoPac's witness, Dr. Robert N.

Although the reasons MoPac advances for its absolute bar can serve as relevant considerations in making individual hiring decisions, they in no way justify an absolute policy which sweeps so broadly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We cannot conceive of any business necessity that would automatically place every individual convicted of any offense, except a minor traffic offense, in the permanent ranks of the unemployed.  This is particularly true for blacks who have suffered and still suffer from the burdens of discrimination in our society.  To deny job opportunities to these individuals because of some conduct which may be remote in time or does not significantly bear upon the particular job requirements is an unnecessarily harsh and unjust burden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we hold that appellant-Green and all other blacks who have been summarily denied employment by MoPac on the basis of conviction records have been discriminated against on the basis of race in violation of Title VII and that the district court should enjoin MoPac's practice of using convictions as an absolute bar to employment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  With respect to appellant-Green, the district court should determine whether on the date of his application his background and experience qualified him for any position with MoPac.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>  If the court so finds, it should award him back pay.  See Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, --- U.S. ---, 95 S.Ct. 2362, 45 L.Ed.2d 280 (1975).  The record does not disclose whether other members of the class also disqualified by their criminal record would have otherwise been eligible for employment with the company.  Under these circumstances, we do not feel that MoPac is obligated for any back pay for the class.

Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 91 S.Ct. 849, 28 L.Ed.2d 158 (1971), found an adequate disparate effect when it was shown that the aptitude tests used there disqualified 94 percent of blacks, while only 42 percent of whites were excluded because of inability to pass the tests.  The disparity in the present case was a ratio of 5.3 percent blacks excluded to 2.23 percent whites.  As found by the District Court, this appears to be De minimus in light of the total number employed by MoPac.  In 1970, the year that Green was rejected, 29 percent of the employees hired by MoPac in the St. Louis Metropolitan area were black, although blacks comprised only 16.4 percent of that area.  Green v. Missouri Pac. Ry., 381 F.Supp. 992, 998-1000 (E.D.Mo. 1974).  Contrary to the panel holding in the instant case, it does not appear that black applicants were disqualified at a \"substantially higher\" rate than whites.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Title VII is remedial in nature, not punitive.  It is intended to ensure nondiscriminatory and fair employment practices, not to invade every province normally reserved for the employers' business judgment.  MoPac's policy disqualified a very small percentage of All applicants and affected only 3 percent more blacks than whites.  It is conceivable that Any qualification for employment or promotion can be shown by statistics or otherwise to have Some effect, however minimal, on blacks, women or other protected groups.  This is not to say that these qualifications are \"built-in headwinds\" for the protected groups.  Griggs v. Duke Power Co., supra 401 U.S. at 432, 91 S.Ct. 849.  Title VII should be construed in a manner to preserve the employers' right to make reasonable business judgments in these matters based upon the exigencies of the particular business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence in the above case, as was that presented in Butts v.

In effect, the present case has judicially created a new Title VII protected class persons with conviction records.

Here, we consider a sweeping disqualification of all persons with a past record of some unlawful behavior, See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, supra, 411 U.S. at 806, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The disparity of impact, if any, will be disclosed by an examination of how that policy affects applicants and potential applicants.  We agree with the approach taken by the district court and primarily limit our statistical analysis to the effect of MoPac's policies against both blacks and whites in the general population in the area from which employees are drawn (metropolitan St. Louis), and the effect of this policy upon black and white applicants for employment with MoPac.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Initially, we note that the district court recognized statistical data and treatises offered into evidence by the plaintiff which indicate that blacks are convicted of crimes at a rate at least two to three times greater than the percentage of blacks in the populations of certain geographical areas.  Dr. Ronald Christensen, a qualified expert witness for the plaintiff, concluded that it is between 2.2 and 6.7 times as likely that a black person will have a criminal conviction record during his lifetime than that a white person will have such a record.  He further concluded that in urban areas from 36.9 percent to 78.1 percent of all black persons would incur a conviction during their lifetimes, but that from only 11.6 percent to 16.8 percent of all white persons would acquire a conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MoPac's records of employment applications at its corporate headquarters during the period from September 1, 1971, through November 7, 1973,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> disclose that 3,282 blacks and 5,206 whites applied for employment.  Of these individuals, 174 blacks (5.3 percent of the black applicants) and 118 whites (2.23 percent of the white applicants) were rejected because of their conviction records.  Thus, statistically, the policy operated automatically to exclude from employment 53 of every 1,000 black applicants but only 22 of every 1,000 white applicants.  The rejection rate for blacks is two and one-half times that of whites under this policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the district court recognized that these statistics denote a disparate impact, the court further compared the number of blacks rejected (174) to the total pool of applicants (8,488)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> and deemed the resulting figure of 2.05 percent as showing a \"De minimis discriminatory effect\" when compared to the percentage of blacks (16 percent) in the St. Louis metropolitan area.

First, comparing the number of black applicants rejected because of a conviction record to the total number of applicants does not reflect a disparity of impact separately against each race.  Moreover, because more whites than blacks applied for employment (3,282 blacks and 5,206 whites) a comparison of the rejected blacks to the total number of applicants serves to dilute the actual discriminatory impact against blacks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, comparing the resulting percentage of 2.05 against the percent of blacks in the relevant population area is of no assistance for the issue in Title VII cases focuses on whether an employer has discriminated against any individual \"because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\"  42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-2(a)(1).  The issue to be examined statistically is whether the questioned employment practice operates in a disparate manner upon a minority race or group, not whether the individuals actually suffering from a discriminatory practice are statistically large in number.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An employment criterion must be examined for its operation on a racially exclusionary basis thus its effect must be measured upon blacks separately and upon whites separately.

The district court decree in pertinent part had limited the disqualification to a time period of five years, after a felony conviction or after incarceration had ended and a time period of two years after a misdemeanor conviction or two years after incarceration for such conviction had ended.  The decree had provided further that any rejection of an applicant for employment because of a conviction of a crime must be based on a finding that the applicant's behavior giving rise to the conviction furnished an inference that the applicant could not fulfill the duties of a fire fighter.

Although the case did not arise under Title VII, the language of the court in discussing the relationship of a conviction to employment is instructive:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p>There is no doubt that the State could logically prohibit and refuse employment in certain positions where the felony conviction would directly reflect on the felon's qualifications for the job (E. g., conviction of embezzlement and a job requiring the handling of large sums of money).  The Iowa statutory scheme, however, has an across-the-board prohibition against the employment of felons in civil service positions.  There is simply no tailoring in an effort to limit these statutes to conform to what might be legitimate state interests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p>(The Iowa provision) suffers from a total lack of such narrowing criteria.  As a result, the statute is both over and under inclusive: persons who clearly could serve the public interest are denied civil service jobs, while misdemeanants convicted of crimes indicating a lack of probity suffer no disqualification.  In short, no consideration is given to the nature and seriousness of the crime in relation to the job sought.  The time elapsing since the conviction, the degree of the felon's rehabilitation, and the circumstances under which the crime was committed are similarly ignored.  (Id.

But, as recognized by the district court, MoPac has not empirically validated its policy with respect to conviction records, 381 F.Supp. at 996, nor shown that a less restrictive alternative with a lesser racial impact would not serve as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MoPac's witness, Dr. Robert N.

This is particularly true for blacks who have suffered and still suffer from the burdens of discrimination in our society.

For example, one current employee has been convicted of disturbing the peace while another employee has been convicted of possession of intoxicants by a minor.  Nevertheless, as a policy matter, MoPac denies employment to any person with a conviction record for a felony or misdemeanor (excepting minor traffic offenses)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> These figures reflect the only available data</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> </p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> The district court utilized the St. Louis metropolitan area as the appropriate area for population statistics.

These include standardized tests as well as qualifying or disqualifying personal history or background requirements.  29 C.F.R. &#167; 1607.2.  The district court rejected these guidelines as inappropriate for MoPac's employment practice here in question.  The application of these guidelines to the use of conviction data in a less restrictive way is not now before us and, therefore, we need not resolve that question</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn14\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14_ref\">14</a>\n        <p> We note that Green's conviction was for refusal to submit to military induction after he had been denied conscientious objector status.  He has paid his debt to society for a nonviolent crime.  It is difficult to view this conviction as related to any job qualification except in a most remote way.  Although one of MoPac's witnesses, Dr. McMurry, expressed some reservations about Green, we note that Green worked as a clerk during his 21 months of imprisonment and at the time of trial in this case was employed by the Lead Poisoning Control Service of the City of St. Louis and had received a \"superior\" rating from his supervisor.  The supervisor testified that \"superior\" ratings are given very infrequently</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn15\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15_ref\">15</a>\n        <p> The district court initially ruled against Green on this issue in Green v.
