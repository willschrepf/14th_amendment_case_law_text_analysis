Code, &#167;&#167; 10446, 6920.\n\nColeman, Spain, Stewart  Davies and J. W. Gillon, all of Birmingham, for appellee.\n\nProper method of attacking sufficiency of a motion to transfer a cause from law to equity is by demurrer. Code, &#167; 6489. In absence of demurrer, averments of motion will be liberally construed and amendable defects treated as amended. Jefferson Lbr. Co. v. Powers,  223 Ala. 63 ,  134 So. 464 . Suit to foreclose mortgage, being an action in equity, is not one in which a party is entitled to a jury trial. Wiltsie, Mtg. Fcl., 4th Ed., &#167; 552; Southern Steel Co. v. Hopkins,  157 Ala. 175 , 47 So. 274 , 20 L.R.A., N.S., 848, 131 Am.St.Rep. 20, 16 Ann.Cas. 690; Cook v. Schmidt,  100 Ala. 582 ,  13 So. 686 .

Ordway,  82 Ala. 463 , 2 So. 276 ; Id.,  76 Ala. 347 . An unwitnessed and unacknowledged mortgage may be valid in a court of equity, though not in a court of law. Cross v. Bank of Ensley,  203 Ala. 561 , 84 So. 267 ; Markham v. Wallace,  147 Ala. 243 ,  41 So. 304 ; Wiltsie, Mtg. Fcl., 4th Ed., &#167; 18. If value of property is in excess of homestead exemption, a court of equity can enforce an unacknowledged mortgage to the extent of such excess. Authorities supra. Party to whom a mortgage is delivered for collection or to whom it is transferred without transfer of the debt cannot validly foreclose in his own name. Ritter v. Moseley,  226 Ala. 648 ,  148 So. 143 . The rights, duties, liabilities and property of corporations entering into a merger become vested in the consolidated corporation.
