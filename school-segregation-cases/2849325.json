Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann.</span> § 74.351(a) (West Supp. 2009)\r\n(requiring health care liability claimants to serve expert reports within 120\r\ndays of filing original petition).  Woo moved to dismiss the action and\r\nattached an affidavit from her attorney, Jonathan Bell, to support a claim for\r\nattorney’s fees and costs under section 74.351(b) of the Civil Practice and\r\nRemedies Code.  <i>See</i> <span>Tex. Civ.\r\nPrac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann.</span> § 74.351(b) (West Supp. 2009) (requiring\r\ntrial courts to dismiss claims and award attorney’s fees and costs if a health\r\ncare liability claimant fails to timely serve an expert report).  The affidavit\r\ncontained the following paragraph:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"BlockQuote\">Following the hearing on Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss, the\r\ntotal reasonable and necessary attorney’s fees of $5,456.50 and costs of\r\n$115.00, and thus, the total fees and costs incurred by the Defendant will\r\nequal $5,571.50.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">Bell provided an explanation\r\nfor his calculations, which included billing rates and the number of hours allocated\r\nbetween himself, two other attorneys, and two paralegals.  The affidavit\r\nfurther contained a description of the type of work completed and Bell’s averment\r\nthat he had defended health care liability cases for ten years, was familiar\r\nwith the amount of legal work necessary to defend such a claim, and was familiar\r\nwith what constitutes a reasonable fee for those services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">            On the day of the\r\nhearing pertaining to Woo’s motion to dismiss, Durst filed a written response but\r\ndid not attach an affidavit or any other evidence to refute Bell’s affidavit.  Rodney\r\nMoton, Durst’s attorney, argued that the affidavit contained hearsay, but he\r\ndid not present any evidence to contradict the affidavit or otherwise request that\r\nthe trial court afford a further opportunity to file or present evidence.  The\r\ntrial court dismissed the claim against Woo and awarded her attorney’s fees and\r\ncosts in the amount of $5,571.50 with an additional $10,000 in the event of\r\nDurst’s unsuccessful appeal.  Boyd moved to dismiss and for an award of\r\nattorney’s fees several weeks later, and the trial court granted the motion,\r\nawarding fees and costs in the amount of $5,423.50.  This appeal followed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\" align=\"center\"><b><span>Dismissal\r\nfor Failure to Serve Expert Report</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\"><b>A.<span>         \r\n</span></b><b>Standard of Review</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">We review for an abuse\r\nof discretion a trial court’s ruling on a motion to dismiss based on the\r\nclaimant’s failure to timely serve an expert report.  <i>Kingwood Specialty\r\nHosp., Ltd. v.

Sch. Dist. v. Scott</i>, 309 S.W.3d 927, 930 (Tex. 2010).  We must consider\r\nand interpret a statute in its entirety, not in isolated portions.  <i>Helena\r\nChem. Co. v. Wilkins</i>, 47 S.W.3d 486, 493 (Tex. 2001).  When possible, we\r\ninterpret two provisions of the same statute to be consistent.  <i>Tex. Dept.\r\nof Pub. Safety v. J.H.J.</i>, 274 S.W.3d 803, 808 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th\r\nDist.] 2008, no pet.) (citing <i>Wilkins</i>, 47 S.W.3d at 493).  “We must\r\npresume that the Legislature intends an entire statute to be effective and that\r\na just and reasonable result is intended.”  <i>Wilkins</i>, 47 S.W.3d at 493.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">Section 74.351(a) requires a claimant in a health\r\ncare liability action to serve “one or more expert reports” on each opposing\r\nparty or party’s attorney within 120 days from the date of filing the original\r\npetition.  <i>See</i> <span>Tex. Civ. Prac.\r\n&amp; Rem. Code Ann.</span> § 74.351(a).  Durst argues that the plain\r\nmeaning of section 74.351(i) negates the 120-day time period in section\r\n74.351(a).  Section 74.351(i), in its entirety, appears as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"BlockQuote\">Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a\r\nclaimant may satisfy any requirement of this section for serving an expert\r\nreport by serving reports of separate experts regarding different physicians or\r\nhealth care providers or regarding different issues arising from the conduct of\r\na physician or health care provider, such as issues of liability and causation.\r\nNothing in this section shall be construed to mean that a single expert must\r\naddress all liability and causation issues with respect to all physicians or\r\nhealth care providers or with respect to both liability and causation issues\r\nfor a physician or health care provider.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\"><span>Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann.</span> § 74.351(i) (West Supp.\r\n2009).  Durst argues that the plain meaning of “notwithstanding any other\r\nprovision of this section, a claimant may satisfy any requirement of this\r\nsection,” is that a claimant who serves multiple reports in accordance with\r\nsection 74.351(i) does not need to file any report within the 120-day time\r\nperiod required by section 74.351(a) or within any prescribed time period\r\nwhatsoever.  In particular, she argues that the 120-day time period is a\r\n“provision of this section” that is “satisfied” by serving reports from\r\nseparate experts under section 74.351(i).  Durst argues this court should hold that\r\nthe 120-day time period does not apply when a claimant chooses to use multiple\r\nexperts to satisfy the service requirement in section 74.351(a).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">Durst’s interpretation is inconsistent with a plain\r\nreading of the two subsections.  We read section 74.351(i) consistently with\r\nsection 74.351(a) so that the 120-day time period still applies to a claimant\r\nserving multiple expert reports.  Section 74.351(i) is not an “alternate\r\nservice provision,” as Durst suggests.  In fact, Durst’s argument is belied by\r\nthe plain language of the provision.  Section 74.351(i) does not merely state “a\r\nclaimant may satisfy any requirement of this section.”  Instead, it states “a\r\nclaimant may satisfy any requirement of this section for serving an expert\r\nreport.”  Thus, section 74.351(i) allows a claimant to serve multiple reports from\r\nseparate experts or on separate issues (“reports of separate experts”), instead\r\nof serving “an expert report.”  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">Further, we should interpret this provision to be\r\nconsistent with the service deadline in section 74.351(a).  A claimant may\r\n“satisfy” the service requirement in section 74.351(a) by serving separate\r\nexpert reports, but the service must still comply with the 120-day deadline. \r\nThis is the only reasonable interpretation of section 74.351(a), and it gives\r\nfull meaning to the Legislature’s intent of requiring health care liability\r\nclaimants to serve expert reports within 120 days of filing an original\r\npetition.  Adopting Durst’s view of the statute would essentially (1) eliminate\r\nany deadline for filing expert reports when the claimant has more than one\r\nexpert and (2) permit an end-run on the section 74.351(a) deadline even after\r\nit had passed by employing an additional expert.  We reject such an interpretation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">Durst’s first issue is overruled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\"><b>C.<span>         \r\n</span></b><b>Docket Control Order</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">Also in her first issue, Durst suggests there is “no\r\nconflict between section 74.351 and the deadline established by the Docket\r\nControl Order (‘DCO’) for submitting expert reports” only when section 74.351(i)\r\nis interpreted to supersede other provisions for a deadline.  Woo and Boyd argue\r\nthat there is no evidence in the record to suggest the docket control order in\r\nthis case extended the 120-day filing requirement.  We agree.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">Although the 120-day deadline for serving an expert\r\nreport under section 74.351(a) may be “extended by written agreement of the\r\naffected parties,” <span>Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp;\r\nRem. Code Ann.</span> § 74.351(a), a routine docket control order specifying\r\nthe deadline will not suffice for an extension.  <i>See Spectrum Healthcare Res.,\r\nInc. v. McDaniel</i>, 306 S.W.3d 249, 253 (Tex. 2010).  For a docket control\r\norder to extend the threshold expert report filing deadline in section\r\n74.351(a), the parties “must make a clear acknowledgement of their intent to do\r\nso,” and the order must make an “explicit reference to that specific\r\ndeadline.”  <i>Id.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">Durst did not include any citations to the record in her\r\nbrief, and we cannot find the alleged docket control order in the appellate\r\nrecord.  Accordingly, the record does not support a conclusion that a docket\r\ncontrol order extended the time for filing expert reports.  The issue has been\r\nwaived.  <i>See</i> <span>Tex. R. App. P.</span>\r\n38.1(i); <i>see also Nguyen v. Kosnoski</i>, 93 S.W.3d 186, 188 (Tex.\r\nApp.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2002, no pet.) (“Moreover, an issue not supported by\r\nreferences to the record is waived.”).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\"><b>D.<span>         \r\n</span></b><b>Defendant’s Service of Discovery Requests</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">In her second issue, Durst argues that Woo waived the\r\nexpert report service requirement by serving discovery requests before expiration\r\nof the time for Durst to serve her expert report.  Woo and Boyd respond that\r\nserving discovery requests does not operate as a waiver of their right to a\r\ndismissal for a plaintiff’s failure to file a timely expert report.  We agree\r\nwith Woo and Boyd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">Durst correctly notes that discovery is stayed until\r\na claimant has served an expert report as required by section 74.351(a).  <i>See</i>\r\n<span>Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann.</span>\r\n§ 74.351(s) (West Supp. 2009).  However, a defendant’s service of\r\ndiscovery requests does not waive the defendant’s right to receive a timely\r\nexpert report or to request that the claim be dismissed under section 74.351(b)\r\nshould the claimant fail to supply a timely expert report.  <i>Quint v.\r\nAlexander</i>, No. 03-04-00819-CV, 2005 WL 2805576, at *5 (Tex. App.—Austin\r\nOct. 28, 2005, pet. denied) (mem. op.) (citing <i>Jernigan</i>, 111 S.W.3d at\r\n157–58 (holding that participating in discovery is not so inconsistent with\r\nassertion of a right to dismiss as to operate as a waiver of the right to\r\nassert dismissal under the predecessor statute to section 74.351(b))). \r\nInstead, the defendant who violates the section 74.351(s) stay and ultimately\r\nobtains a dismissal forfeits the right to recover attorney’s fees incurred in\r\nthe premature discovery process.  <i>See Awoniyi v. McWilliams</i>, 261 S.W.3d\r\n162, 167 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2008, no pet.) (holding that a\r\ndefendant may not recover attorney’s fees for early discovery if the claim is\r\nultimately dismissed due to the claimant’s failure to file a report).<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[1]</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">Durst’s second issue is overruled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\" align=\"center\"><b><span>Attorney’s Fees</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">In her third issue, Durst argues that the award of\r\nattorney’s fees to Woo should be vacated because Bell’s affidavit contains\r\nhearsay.  Specifically, Durst complains about statements in the affidavit identifying\r\nthe attorneys, the number of hours worked, and their hourly rates.  However, Durst\r\ndoes not complain about the paragraph that reflects Bell’s qualifications to provide\r\nexpert testimony or the paragraph in which he states the total amount charged and\r\nhis opinion regarding the reasonableness and necessity of attorney’s fees.  Woo\r\nresponds that the affidavit contains legally sufficient evidence for the award,\r\nand Durst failed to present any controverting evidence.  We agree with Woo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">If a trial court properly dismisses a health care\r\nliability claim because the claimant failed to timely file an expert report,\r\nthen the trial court must award attorney’s fees to the affected physicians.  <span>Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann.</span> §\r\n74.351(b).  A request for attorney’s fees under section 74.351(b) may be\r\nsupported by an affidavit rather than live testimony, <i>see Ramchandani v.\r\nJimenez</i>, 314 S.W.3d 148, 154 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2010, no\r\npet.), and an attorney is not required to parse the total fee by showing in the\r\naffidavit the number of hours and billing rates for different individuals who\r\nworked on the matter.  <i>See Garcia v. Gomez</i>, 319 S.W.3d 638, 641–42 (Tex.\r\n2010) (holding there was sufficient evidence to support an attorney’s fee award\r\nwhen the defendant’s counsel testified that he had practiced medical\r\nmalpractice litigation for twenty-five years and the reasonable attorney’s fee\r\nwas $12,200).  Accordingly, if an affidavit contains some evidence supporting\r\nthe reasonableness of incurred attorney’s fees, the trial court does not commit\r\nreversible error by awarding such fees even if a portion of the affidavit\r\ncontains hearsay evidence.  <i>See id.</i> (requiring some evidence that the\r\nfee is reasonable and was incurred).  When a defendant’s attorney gives an\r\nopinion on the reasonable amount of fees incurred and the claimant fails to present\r\ncontroverting evidence, there is some evidence to support the trial court’s\r\naward of attorney’s fees.  <i>See id. </i>(holding that a brief statement about\r\nreasonable attorney’s fees was sufficient when the claimant presented no\r\ncontroverting evidence).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">Here, Durst’s attorney objected to hearsay in the\r\naffidavit, but the affiant included other statements supporting the award. \r\nBell’s summary statement was sufficient to support the attorney’s fee award because\r\nDurst did not file a controverting affidavit or present live testimony.  <i>See\r\nid.</i>  Bell described his extensive experience defending medical malpractice cases\r\nand stated that he is familiar with what constitutes a reasonable fee for those\r\nservices.  Durst’s attorney could have filed his own affidavit or provided his\r\nown controverting testimony in an evidentiary hearing, but he chose not to do\r\nso.  Accordingly, the trial court did not err in awarding attorney’s fees for\r\nthe amount stated in the affidavit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">Durst’s third issue is overruled.  Having overruled\r\nall of Durst’s issues, we affirm the trial court’s judgment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\"> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\"> </p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<span><br clear=\"all\">\r\n</span>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"WordSection2\">\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>                                                                                    </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>                                                                        /s/        Sharon\r\nMcCally</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>                                                                                    Justice</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Panel consists of Justices Anderson,\r\nSeymore, and McCally.</span></p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div><br clear=\"all\">\r\n\r\n<hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\">\r\n\r\n<div id=\"ftn1\">\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoFootnoteText\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[1]</span></span></span>\r\nDurst argued in the trial court that Bell’s affidavit supporting attorney’s\r\nfees improperly included fees for discovery.  Bell clearly did not segregate\r\nthe fees attributable to discovery in his affidavit, which included Bell’s\r\nstatement that “it was necessary to prepare discovery.”  However, Durst did not\r\nassert this argument on appeal, and we will not reverse a trial court’s\r\njudgment on unassigned error.  <i>See, e.g.</i>, <i>Pat Baker Co. v.

Code Ann.</span> § 74.351(a) (West Supp. 2009)\r\n(requiring health care liability claimants to serve expert reports within 120\r\ndays of filing original petition).  Woo moved to dismiss the action and\r\nattached an affidavit from her attorney, Jonathan Bell, to support a claim for\r\nattorney’s fees and costs under section 74.351(b) of the Civil Practice and\r\nRemedies Code.  <i>See</i> <span>Tex. Civ.\r\nPrac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann.</span> § 74.351(b) (West Supp. 2009) (requiring\r\ntrial courts to dismiss claims and award attorney’s fees and costs if a health\r\ncare liability claimant fails to timely serve an expert report).  The affidavit\r\ncontained the following paragraph:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"BlockQuote\">Following the hearing on Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss, the\r\ntotal reasonable and necessary attorney’s fees of $5,456.50 and costs of\r\n$115.00, and thus, the total fees and costs incurred by the Defendant will\r\nequal $5,571.50.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">Bell provided an explanation\r\nfor his calculations, which included billing rates and the number of hours allocated\r\nbetween himself, two other attorneys, and two paralegals.  The affidavit\r\nfurther contained a description of the type of work completed and Bell’s averment\r\nthat he had defended health care liability cases for ten years, was familiar\r\nwith the amount of legal work necessary to defend such a claim, and was familiar\r\nwith what constitutes a reasonable fee for those services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">            On the day of the\r\nhearing pertaining to Woo’s motion to dismiss, Durst filed a written response but\r\ndid not attach an affidavit or any other evidence to refute Bell’s affidavit.  Rodney\r\nMoton, Durst’s attorney, argued that the affidavit contained hearsay, but he\r\ndid not present any evidence to contradict the affidavit or otherwise request that\r\nthe trial court afford a further opportunity to file or present evidence.  The\r\ntrial court dismissed the claim against Woo and awarded her attorney’s fees and\r\ncosts in the amount of $5,571.50 with an additional $10,000 in the event of\r\nDurst’s unsuccessful appeal.  Boyd moved to dismiss and for an award of\r\nattorney’s fees several weeks later, and the trial court granted the motion,\r\nawarding fees and costs in the amount of $5,423.50.  This appeal followed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\" align=\"center\"><b><span>Dismissal\r\nfor Failure to Serve Expert Report</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\"><b>A.<span>         \r\n</span></b><b>Standard of Review</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">We review for an abuse\r\nof discretion a trial court’s ruling on a motion to dismiss based on the\r\nclaimant’s failure to timely serve an expert report.  <i>Kingwood Specialty\r\nHosp., Ltd. v.

Civ. Prac.\r\n&amp; Rem. Code Ann.</span> § 74.351(a).  Durst argues that the plain\r\nmeaning of section 74.351(i) negates the 120-day time period in section\r\n74.351(a).  Section 74.351(i), in its entirety, appears as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"BlockQuote\">Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a\r\nclaimant may satisfy any requirement of this section for serving an expert\r\nreport by serving reports of separate experts regarding different physicians or\r\nhealth care providers or regarding different issues arising from the conduct of\r\na physician or health care provider, such as issues of liability and causation.\r\nNothing in this section shall be construed to mean that a single expert must\r\naddress all liability and causation issues with respect to all physicians or\r\nhealth care providers or with respect to both liability and causation issues\r\nfor a physician or health care provider.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\"><span>Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann.</span> § 74.351(i) (West Supp.\r\n2009).  Durst argues that the plain meaning of “notwithstanding any other\r\nprovision of this section, a claimant may satisfy any requirement of this\r\nsection,” is that a claimant who serves multiple reports in accordance with\r\nsection 74.351(i) does not need to file any report within the 120-day time\r\nperiod required by section 74.351(a) or within any prescribed time period\r\nwhatsoever.  In particular, she argues that the 120-day time period is a\r\n“provision of this section” that is “satisfied” by serving reports from\r\nseparate experts under section 74.351(i).  Durst argues this court should hold that\r\nthe 120-day time period does not apply when a claimant chooses to use multiple\r\nexperts to satisfy the service requirement in section 74.351(a).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">Durst’s interpretation is inconsistent with a plain\r\nreading of the two subsections.  We read section 74.351(i) consistently with\r\nsection 74.351(a) so that the 120-day time period still applies to a claimant\r\nserving multiple expert reports.  Section 74.351(i) is not an “alternate\r\nservice provision,” as Durst suggests.  In fact, Durst’s argument is belied by\r\nthe plain language of the provision.  Section 74.351(i) does not merely state “a\r\nclaimant may satisfy any requirement of this section.”  Instead, it states “a\r\nclaimant may satisfy any requirement of this section for serving an expert\r\nreport.”  Thus, section 74.351(i) allows a claimant to serve multiple reports from\r\nseparate experts or on separate issues (“reports of separate experts”), instead\r\nof serving “an expert report.”  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">Further, we should interpret this provision to be\r\nconsistent with the service deadline in section 74.351(a).  A claimant may\r\n“satisfy” the service requirement in section 74.351(a) by serving separate\r\nexpert reports, but the service must still comply with the 120-day deadline. \r\nThis is the only reasonable interpretation of section 74.351(a), and it gives\r\nfull meaning to the Legislature’s intent of requiring health care liability\r\nclaimants to serve expert reports within 120 days of filing an original\r\npetition.  Adopting Durst’s view of the statute would essentially (1) eliminate\r\nany deadline for filing expert reports when the claimant has more than one\r\nexpert and (2) permit an end-run on the section 74.351(a) deadline even after\r\nit had passed by employing an additional expert.  We reject such an interpretation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">Durst’s first issue is overruled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\"><b>C.<span>         \r\n</span></b><b>Docket Control Order</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">Also in her first issue, Durst suggests there is “no\r\nconflict between section 74.351 and the deadline established by the Docket\r\nControl Order (‘DCO’) for submitting expert reports” only when section 74.351(i)\r\nis interpreted to supersede other provisions for a deadline.  Woo and Boyd argue\r\nthat there is no evidence in the record to suggest the docket control order in\r\nthis case extended the 120-day filing requirement.  We agree.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">Although the 120-day deadline for serving an expert\r\nreport under section 74.351(a) may be “extended by written agreement of the\r\naffected parties,” <span>Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp;\r\nRem. Code Ann.</span> § 74.351(a), a routine docket control order specifying\r\nthe deadline will not suffice for an extension.  <i>See Spectrum Healthcare Res.,\r\nInc. v. McDaniel</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"895206\"><a href=\"/opinion/895206/spectrum-healthcare-resources-v-mcdaniel/\"><span class=\"volume\">306</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">249</span></a></span>, 253 (Tex. 2010).  For a docket control\r\norder to extend the threshold expert report filing deadline in section\r\n74.351(a), the parties “must make a clear acknowledgement of their intent to do\r\nso,” and the order must make an “explicit reference to that specific\r\ndeadline.”  <i>Id.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">Durst did not include any citations to the record in her\r\nbrief, and we cannot find the alleged docket control order in the appellate\r\nrecord.  Accordingly, the record does not support a conclusion that a docket\r\ncontrol order extended the time for filing expert reports.  The issue has been\r\nwaived.  <i>See</i> <span>Tex.

Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann.</span>\r\n§ 74.351(s) (West Supp. 2009).  However, a defendant’s service of\r\ndiscovery requests does not waive the defendant’s right to receive a timely\r\nexpert report or to request that the claim be dismissed under section 74.351(b)\r\nshould the claimant fail to supply a timely expert report.  <i>Quint v.\r\nAlexander</i>, No. 03-04-00819-CV, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2005</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2805576</span></span>, at *5 (Tex.
