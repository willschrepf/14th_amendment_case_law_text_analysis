Baird,    405 U.S. 438,453, there\n             is a right ‘to be free from unwarranted            governmental\n             intrusion    into matters     80 fundamentally      affecting  a\n             person    as the decision     whether    to bear or beget a child.’\n\n                        “By acting     to penalize      the pregnant teacher for\n                deciding   to bear    a child,     overly    restrictive     maternity\n                leave regulations       can constitute       a heavy burden on the\n                exercise     of these protected       freedoms.         Because public\n                school maternity        leave rules directly         affect ‘one of\n                the basic civil rights of man, ’ Skinner v.

The question     before\n                 us in these cases is whether            the interests     advanced    in\n                 support of the rules of the Cleveland              and Chesterfield\n                 County School Boards can justify              the particular     procedure\n                 they have adopted. ” (42 LW at 4189) (emphasis                   added)\n\n\n        It concluded   that the mandatory   “cut-off”   dates had no rational    rela-\ntionship   to any valid state interests   of continuity   of teaching since,  in some\ninstancea,     it could have the opposite      effect.    As to the goal of maintaining\nhealthy    teachers in the classroom,       the Court pointed to the fact that the\nmedical     witnesses    agreed unanimously        that the ability of any one pregnant\nwoman to continue at work past any fixed time in her pregnancy                   is very\n much an individual       matter.   “Thus,    the conclusive      presumption   embodied\nin these rules.      . . ie neither   Inecessarily     nor universally    true, ’ and is\n violative   of the Due Process      Clause.”      (42 LW at 4190)\n\n\n\n\n                                              p.    1172\n\f.,   ’\n\n\n\n\n     The Honorable         Joe Allen,    page 4    (I-I-251)\n\n\n\n\n            The Court’8 decision,    however,    cannot be read as condemning\n     out of hand all rules requiring    separation   of an employee   at a certain,\n     fixed time before delivery.     In a footnote  to its holding, the Court said:\n\n                               “This is not to say that the only means for pro-\n                       viding appropriate       protection    for the rights of preg-\n                       nant teachers      ir an individualized       determination      in\n                       each case and in every circumstance.

We\n                       therefore     have no occarion      to decide whether such\n                       regulations     might be justif ied by considerations            not\n                       presented     in these records-        for example,        widespread\n                       medical     coneenaus     about the ‘disabling’       effect of\n                       pregnancy      on a teacher’s    job performance         during these\n                       latter daye., or evidence        showing that such firm cut-\n                       offs were the only rearonable           method of avoiding the\n                       possibility     of labor beginning      wtile   some teacher was\n                       in the classroom,        or proof that adequate         substitutes\n                       could not be procured         without at leant some minimal\n                        lead timeand      certainty    as to the dates upon which their\n                       employment       was to begin. ” (footnote        13, 42 LW at 4191)\n\n               As to when an employee        may return to work after delivery,          the\n         Court in h   Fleur   struck    down as unconstitutionally      arbitrary   and irra-\n         Honal a requirement      of the Cleveland   Board of Education        that return\n         could not be effected    until at least three months after delivery.

As we\n             noted in Eisenstadt       v.

Because public\n                school maternity        leave rules directly         affect ‘one of\n                the basic civil rights of man, ’ Skinner v.

The question     before\n                 us in these cases is whether            the interests     advanced    in\n                 support of the rules of the Cleveland              and Chesterfield\n                 County School Boards can justify              the particular     procedure\n                 they have adopted. ” (42 LW at 4189) (emphasis                   added)\n\n\n        It concluded   that the mandatory   “cut-off”   dates had no rational    rela-\ntionship   to any valid state interests   of continuity   of teaching since,  in some\ninstancea,     it could have the opposite      effect.    As to the goal of maintaining\nhealthy    teachers in the classroom,       the Court pointed to the fact that the\nmedical     witnesses    agreed unanimously        that the ability of any one pregnant\nwoman to continue at work past any fixed time in her pregnancy                   is very\n much an individual       matter.   “Thus,    the conclusive      presumption   embodied\nin these rules.      . . ie neither   Inecessarily     nor universally    true, ’ and is\n violative   of the Due Process      Clause.”      (42 LW at 4190)\n\n\n\n\n                                              p.    1172\n\f.,   ’\n\n\n\n\n     The Honorable         Joe Allen,    page 4    (I-I-251)\n\n\n\n\n            The Court’8 decision,    however,    cannot be read as condemning\n     out of hand all rules requiring    separation   of an employee   at a certain,\n     fixed time before delivery.     In a footnote  to its holding, the Court said:\n\n                               “This is not to say that the only means for pro-\n                       viding appropriate       protection    for the rights of preg-\n                       nant teachers      ir an individualized       determination      in\n                       each case and in every circumstance.

The\n         Court upheld the requirement        of a medical  certificate.\n\n                 The facts involved   in La Four took place prior to the 1972 amend-\n         ments to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act making those provisions             appli-\n         cable,    with certain exceptions,    to state agencies     and educational  inrtitu-\n         tionr.

And other reasonable\n        regulations,   such aa the requirement      of notice,    may be required,       provided\n        they are required      of G temporarily     dirabled    per8or.s.\n\n\n                The decision as to when that should be will have to be determined\n        on a case-by-case    basis unless there is sufficient unanimity among the\n        medical    community  that a “reasonable”  date prior to delivery could be\n        agreed   upon.\n\n               Your   recond   question     asks:\n\n                               “If your answer        to the first quertion is yea,\n                        and a female   employee        is dismissed   because of her\n                        pregnancy:\n\n                                “a.

A\npregnant woman,       upon taking leave of absence      to have her child,      should\nbe allowed    to exhaust her vacation     time and sick leave and, if it is the\nagency’s   policy to extend sick leave in the event of other types of tempo-\nrary disability,     she should be entitled to similar     consideration.\n\n       The pregnant      woman’s      right\n                                      to future employment     in the same or\nany other rtate agency,    her righta to job clarrification,   compensation,\nretirement   benefits, and other job benefits   should be determined    exactly\nas if her leave were occasioned     by an injury or illness.\n\n       Your   third   question     arkr:\n\n                       “If your answer           to the first quertion is no;\n                and a female   employee           is dismiraed   because of preg-\n                nancy:\n\n                       “a.

No definite  rule may be rtated,\nbut remedies    might include reinrtatement     with or without back pay, back\npay without reinstatement,       and/or other remedies     made legally appropriate\nby the circumatancer      of a given care.\n\n       Your fourth      quertion    ir:\n\n                       “May etatc agencies    and officea  grant temporary\n                leaves of absence without any pay to pregnant female\n                employees,    and at the end of such leave,    reinrtate ruch\n                employees   in the same job claraification    and at the #ame\n                rate of compensation    that they previously   held? ”\n\n        We think our answers to the firat and second quertions    answer your\nfourth.
