The Debtors have continued in the management and operation of their business and property as debtors-in-possession pursuant to sections 1107 and 1108 of the Bankruptcy Code. No trustee or examiner has been appointed in the Debtors' chapter 11 cases.</p>\n<p>B. <i>Jurisdiction and Venue.</i> This Court has jurisdiction over these proceedings pursuant to sections 157(b) and 1334 of title 28 of the United States Code and over the persons and property affected hereby. This Court's consideration of the DIP Motion constitutes a core proceeding under section 157(b)(2) of title 28 of the United States Code. Venue for these cases and the proceedings regarding the DIP Motion is proper in this district under sections 1408 and 1409 of title 28 of the United States Code.</p>\n<p>C. <i>Committee Formation.</i> On April 24, 2009 the United States Trustee for the Southern District of New York (the <i>\"United States Trustee\"</i>) appointed an official committee of unsecured creditors in the Case (the <i>\"Creditors' Committee\"</i>).</p>\n<p>D. <i>Notice.</i> The Final Hearing was held in accordance with Bankruptcy Rule 4001 and Local Rule 4001-2. Notice of the Final Hearing and the relief requested in the DIP Motion was provided by the Debtors on April 16, 2009, whether by telecopy, email, overnight courier or hand delivery, to parties in interest, including: (i) the Office of the United States Trustee for the Southern District of New York (Attn: Greg M. Zipes); (ii) the Securities and Exchange Commission; (iii) the Internal Revenue Service; (iv) EuroHypo AG, New York Branch, administrative agent for the lenders to certain of the Debtors under (a) the Second Amended and Restated Credit <span class=\"star-pagination\">*125</span> Agreement dated as of February 24, 2006 and (b) the Loan Agreement, dated as of July 11, 2008, as amended; (v) Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as administrative agent for the lenders to certain of the Debtors under certain Loan Agreements, dated as of January 2, 2008 and February 29, 2008, respectively; (vi) Goldman Sachs Mortgage Company, as administrative agent for the lenders to certain of the Debtors under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of November 3, 2008; (vii) Wilmington Trust FSB, as indenture trustee under (a) that certain Indenture, dated as of May 5, 2006, and (b) that certain Indenture, dated as of April 16, 2007; (viii) LaSalle Bank National Association and Wilmington Trust FSB,<sup>[3]</sup> as indenture trustee under that certain Junior Subordinated Indenture, dated as of February 24, 2006; (ix) The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation, as indenture trustee under that certain Indenture, dated as of February 24, 1995; (x) those creditors holding the 100 largest unsecured claims against the Debtors' estates (on a consolidated basis); (xi) the Property Lenders (as defined in the DIP Motion); (xii) counsel to Pershing Square Capital Management, L.P.; (xiii) counsel to the Agent; and (xiv) counsel to the Creditors' Committee. Such notice of the Final Hearing and the relief requested in the DIP Motion is due and sufficient notice and complies with sections 102(1) and 364(c) of the Bankruptcy Code, Bankruptcy Rules 2002, 4001(c), 4001(d) and the Local Rules.</p>\n<p>E. <i>Need for Postpetition Financing.</i> Entry of this Order is necessary to prevent substantial harm to the Debtors' estates that would otherwise result if the Debtors fail to obtain the financing contemplated herein to preserve the Debtors' assets and continue their operations, and, by the power vested in the Court pursuant to sections 105(a) and 364(c) of the Bankruptcy Code, and is hereby approved. The Debtors will suffer substantial harm unless this Court immediately authorizes the Debtors to obtain loans and other financial accommodations from the Lenders in accordance with the terms of this Order, the DIP Loan Documents, and any other documents, instruments, or agreements related thereto or delivered or executed in connection therewith (the DIP Loan Documents, together with such documents, instruments, and agreements, the <i>\"DIP Documents\"</i>).</p>\n<p>F. <i>No Comparable Credit Available on More Favorable Terms.</i> The Debtors have made reasonable efforts, under the circumstances, to locate financing of the type contemplated by this Order, and the Court expressly finds that the Debtors are unable to obtain, in the ordinary course of business or otherwise, financing of the type contemplated herein on an unsecured basis. Specifically, the Debtors have been unable to obtain unsecured credit allowable under sections 364(a), 364(b), 364(c)(1) and 503(b)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code as an administrative expense. The Debtors are also unable to obtain secured credit, allowable only under Bankruptcy Code sections 364(c)(2) and 364(c)(3), on more favorable terms and conditions than those provided in the DIP Documents and this Order.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*126</span> G. <i>Lenders' Requirements.</i> The Lenders are willing to lend money and provide other financial accommodations to the Debtors only on the terms and conditions and with the protections provided herein and in the DIP Documents and are relying on such terms, conditions, and protections in agreeing to lend money and provide financial accommodations to the Debtors hereunder.</p>\n<p>H. <i>Good Faith.</i> The terms and conditions of the DIP Documents have been negotiated in good faith and at arms' length by all parties involved, the payment of the Goldman Indebtedness (as defined in Paragraph I below) reflects the Debtors' exercise of prudent business judgment, and the Lenders and the Debtors have offered sufficient proof thereof. Accordingly, the Court expressly finds that the terms of the DIP Documents have been extended in good faith and that any credit extended, loans to be made, or other financial accommodations granted to the Debtors pursuant to the DIP Documents shall, in each case, be deemed to be extended in good faith, as that term is used in section 364(e) of the Bankruptcy Code.</p>\n<p>I. <i>Debtors' Acknowledgements and Agreements Regarding the Prepetition Goldman Facility.</i> Prior to the Petition Date, certain of the Debtors, as borrowers or guarantors (the <i>\"Goldman Facility Debtors\"</i>),<sup>[4]</sup> were party to that certain Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of November 3, 2008 (as in effect on the date hereof, the <i>\"Goldman Credit Agreement\"</i>), with Goldman Sachs Mortgage Company, as administrative agent (together, with its successors and assigns, the <i>\"Goldman Facility Agent\"</i>) and the lenders party thereto (the <i>\"Goldman Lenders\"</i>) with all related documents and agreements, as amended or modified, (the <i>\"Prepetition Goldman Facility\"</i>). The Debtors acknowledge and agree that: (i) the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the loans advanced under the Prepetition Goldman Facility is $215,000,000, which, together with accrued and unpaid prepetition contract and default rate interest of $86,597.22, accrued and unpaid postpetition contract and default rate interest of $2,511,319.44, and accrued and unpaid prepetition and postpetition fees, costs and expenses, accrued solely as permitted under Section 9.16 of the Goldman Credit Agreement, and reasonable estimates thereof as set forth in the Payoff Letter (as defined below), amounts to a total indebtedness of $214,950,822.66 (including the credit referenced in (a) below and the postpetition fees and expenses referenced herein) as of May 15, 2009 and, together with any per diem postpetition interest accruing thereafter until payment in full of unpaid principal amount of the loans advanced under the Prepetition Goldman Facility in accordance with this Order (collectively, the <i>\"Goldman Indebtedness\"</i>): (ii) as of the Petition Date and as of the date of this Order, the Goldman Indebtedness is secured by valid, binding, enforceable, and properly perfected liens on and security interests in certain real property and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*127</span> personal property of the Goldman Facility Debtors as described in the Prepetition Goldman Facility (the <i>\"Prepetition Goldman Liens\"</i>) with a salable value the Debtors believe is in excess of the Goldman Indebtedness; (iii) as of the Petition Date and as of the date of this Order, the Goldman Indebtedness constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligations of the respective Goldman Facility Debtors, enforceable in accordance with the terms of the Prepetition Goldman Facility (other than in respect of the stay of enforcement arising from section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code); and (iv) the Goldman Lenders and the Goldman Facility Debtors entered into an agreement, dated as of April 15, 2009 (the <i>\"Incentive Agreement\"</i>), pursuant to which if the Goldman Facility Debtors repay the Goldman Indebtedness in full in cash on or before June 1, 2009, (a) the Goldman Facility Debtors shall be entitled to be paid $3,225,000 which is an amount equal to 1.5% of the unpaid principal amount of the loans outstanding under the Prepetition Goldman Facility and (b) an affiliate of the Goldman Facility Debtors as of the repayment date shall be entitled to a rebate of a fee of $1,075,000 paid in connection with the Incentive Agreement which is an amount equal to 0.5% of the unpaid principal amount of the loans that were outstanding as of April 15, 2009 under the Prepetition Goldman Facility as of the date of the Incentive Agreement.</p>\n<p>J. <i>Section 506(c) and Section 552(b) Waiver.</i> In light of the Lenders' agreement to subordinate their liens and superpriority claims to the Carve-Out, the Lenders are entitled to a waiver of (i) the provisions of section 506(c) of the Bankruptcy Code and (ii) any \"equities of the case\" claims under section 552(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, in each case, in respect of the DIP Documents.</p>\n<p>K. <i>Immediate Entry of the Order.</i> The Debtors have requested that this Order become immediately effective and enforceable upon entry, notwithstanding any provisions that may apply in Bankruptcy Rules 6004(h), 6006(d), 7062, or 9014 or any other Bankruptcy Rule, or Rule 62(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The Debtors have demonstrated good cause for the entry of this Order and for this Order to become immediately effective and enforceable upon entry. Among other things, entry of this Order and the immediate effectiveness and enforceability of this Order upon entry will minimize the disruption of the Debtors' business operations and permit the Debtors to satisfy their operating expenses, will increase the possibilities for confirmation of a successful chapter 11 plan for the Debtors, and is in the best interests of the Debtors, their creditors, and the Debtors' bankruptcy estates. The terms of the borrowings and other financial accommodations authorized hereby are fair and reasonable under the circumstances and reflect the Debtors' exercise of prudent business judgment consistent with their fiduciary duties.</p>\n<p>ACCORDINGLY, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p>1. <i>Motion Granted.</i> The DIP Motion is granted in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this Order and the DIP Documents. Any objections and reservations of rights included therein, to the extent not withdrawn with prejudice, settled, or resolved are hereby overruled on the merits.</p>\n<p>2. <i>Approval of Entry into DIP Documents.</i> The Debtors shall be and hereby are authorized to borrow money and seek other financial accommodations from the Lenders on the terms and conditions contained in this Order and the DIP Documents, and the DIP Documents, including, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*128</span> without limitation, the DIP Credit Agreement, are expressly approved by this Court. To effectuate and evidence the terms and conditions of the borrowings and extensions of credit and other financial accommodations to be made to the Debtors by the Lenders pursuant to the terms of this Order, the Debtors are hereby authorized and directed to enter into the DIP Credit Agreement substantially in the form appended as <i>Exhibit 1</i> hereto and any other DIP Documents that may be entered into in connection with the DIP Credit Agreement, which agreements are hereby expressly approved by this Court.</p>\n<p>3. <i>Enforceable Obligations.</i> Upon execution and delivery of the DIP Credit Agreement and the other DIP Documents, such agreements and documents shall constitute valid and binding obligations of the Obligors, enforceable against the Obligors, their estates and any successors thereto and their creditors in accordance with their terms.</p>\n<p>4. <i>Protection of Lenders and Other Rights.</i> From and after the Petition Date, the Obligors shall use the proceeds of the extensions of credit under the DIP Loan Documents only for the purposes specifically set forth in the DIP Loan Documents and this Order, including to satisfy and discharge in full the Goldman Indebtedness and for general working capital purposes not otherwise restricted by the DIP Credit Agreement. In connection therewith, upon the Closing Date, the Obligors shall direct the Lenders to transfer immediately available funds to the Goldman Facility Agent or any proper assignee or designee thereof an amount necessary to pay in full the unpaid amount of the Goldman Indebtedness, as set forth in the pay-off letter from the Goldman Facility Agent to the Goldman Facility Debtors and GGP, dated May 15, 2009 (the <i>\"Payoff Letter\"</i>). Upon the receipt of the transferred funds by the Goldman Facility Agent: (i) all of the Debtors' obligations under the Prepetition Goldman Facility and any other unpaid amounts under the Goldman Indebtedness shall be considered finally satisfied in full; <i>provided, however,</i> that the indemnities provided in Section 5.18 of the Goldman Credit Agreement that by their express terms survive repayment of the Goldman Indebtedness shall remain in full force and effect for all purposes (the <i>\"Goldman Facility Indemnity\"</i>); (ii) all liens, encumbrances, and any other interests in the Debtors' (or any affiliate's) property held by the Goldman Facility Agent or otherwise arising under the Goldman Prepetition Facility shall be deemed fully released, and the Goldman Lenders and/or the Goldman Facility Agent are hereby directed upon request of the Goldman Facility Debtors or the Lenders to promptly deliver to the Goldman Facility Debtors or the Lenders documents in recordable form as are necessary to evidence the release of such liens, encumbrances, and interests; and (iii) all parties shall be forever barred from attempting to enforce any such lien, encumbrance or other interest in the Debtors' or any affiliate's property that arose under the terms of the Prepetition Goldman Facility; <i>provided, however</i> to the extent the Goldman Lenders and/or the Goldman Facility Agent incur fees and expenses in connection with (A) any inquiry or request by the Debtors, the Creditors' Committee, or any other party in interest, relating to the Prepetition Goldman Facility, the Goldman Indebtedness, the Prepetition Goldman Liens, and/or the prepetition activities of any of the Goldman Lenders and/or Goldman Facility Agent (and/or its and/or their successors or assigns) in connection with the Prepetition Goldman Facility, the Goldman Indebtedness, or the Prepetition Goldman Liens; or (B) defending an Avoidance Action as described in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*129</span> paragraph 5(a) below ((A) and (B) collectively, the <i>\"Avoidance Action Defense\"</i>), the Goldman Lenders and/or the Goldman Facility Agent shall have a first priority lien on the prepetition collateral previously securing the Goldman Indebtedness in an amount not to exceed the lesser of (a) $1,000,000 and (b) the reasonable unpaid fees and expenses incurred by the Goldman Facility Agent in connection with the Avoidance Action Defense (the <i>\"Goldman Facility Indemnity Lien\"</i>). The claims under the Goldman Facility Indemnity in excess of the amount of the Goldman Facility Indemnity Lien shall constitute an administrative expense claim under section 503(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, which administrative expense shall not exceed $1,000,000; <i>provided, however,</i> that such administrative expense shall be subject to the DIP Liens in all respects; <i>provided, further,</i> that nothing herein limits the rights of the Goldman Facility Agent and/or the Goldman Lenders to file unsecured claims with respect to the Goldman Facility Indemnity.</p>\n<p>5. <i>Goldman Refinancing Examination Period.</i></p>\n<p>(a) <i>Avoidance Actions.</i> Notwithstanding the terms of paragraph 4, any party-in-interest with standing (including the Creditors' Committee) shall have 210 days from the date of the entry of this Order (the <i>\"Avoidance Action Deadline\"</i>) to file an adversary complaint with this Court (i) challenging the validity, enforceability, extent or priority of the Prepetition Goldman Liens or (ii) otherwise asserting any claims or causes of action against the Goldman Facility Agent or any of the Goldman Lenders (and/or its successors and/or assigns, if applicable) (an <i>\"Avoidance Action\"</i>) arising out of the Prepetition Goldman Facility, the Goldman Indebtedness, and/or the prepetition activities of the Goldman Facility Agent or any of the Goldman Lenders (and/or its and or their successors and assigns, if applicable). Any Avoidance Action may be filed by the Creditors' Committee or such other party in the name of the Debtors without leave of the Bankruptcy Court.</p>\n<p>(b) <i>Failure to File or Successfully Prosecute an Avoidance Action.</i> To the extent that (i) an Avoidance Action is not filed by the Avoidance Action Deadline by the Creditors' Committee or such other party or (ii) if an Avoidance Action is so filed and the Goldman Facility Agent or any of the Goldman Lenders (and/or its and/or their successors and assigns, if applicable) ultimately prevails in its defense thereof pursuant to a final non-appealable order: (A) the Goldman Indebtedness shall constitute allowed claims in an amount equal to the payment made to the Goldman Facility Agent or an assignee or designee thereof (and/or its and/or their successors and assigns, if applicable) pursuant to Paragraph 4 of this Order for all purposes in the Debtors' bankruptcy proceedings and any subsequent proceedings under the Bankruptcy Code and shall not be subject to avoidance, reduction, recovery, set off, offset, recharacterization, subordination (whether equitable, contractual, or otherwise), counterclaim, cross-claim, defense, or any other challenge under the Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable federal, state, or local law or regulation by any person or entity (including, without limitation, any trustee, successor trustee, examiner, or responsible person in these or any subsequent proceedings under the Bankruptcy Code); (B) the Prepetition Goldman Lien shall be deemed legal, valid, binding, enforceable, perfected, and otherwise unavoidable first priority liens and security interests, as of the Petition Date, and shall not be subject to any claim (as such term is defined in the Bankruptcy Code), counterclaim, cross-claim, defense, avoidance, reduction, recovery, set off, offset, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*130</span> recharacterization, subordination (whether equitable, contractual, or otherwise), or any other challenge under the Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable federal, state, or local law or regulation, by any person or entity (including, without limitation, any trustee, successor trustee, examiner, or responsible person in these or any subsequent proceedings under the Bankruptcy Code); (C) the payment of the Goldman Indebtedness authorized and directed by this Order shall be final and irreversible; and (D) each Debtor shall be deemed to have irrevocably waived and released any and all \"claims\" (as such term is defined in the Bankruptcy Code), counterclaim, cross-claims, causes of action, defenses, offsets, and setoff rights against the Goldman Facility Agent and each of the Goldman Lenders, in their respective capacities as Goldman Facility Agent and/or Goldman Lender, and not in any other capacity or in respect of any other relationship it or they may have, or have had, with the Debtors, whether arising at law or in equity, including, without limitation, those asserting avoidance, reduction, recovery, set off, offset, recharacterization, subordination (whether equitable, contractual, or otherwise), or any other challenge arising under or pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable federal, state, or local law or regulation.</p>\n<p>(c) <i>Lenders' Senior Priority to the Prepetition Goldman Lien.</i> The release of liens, encumbrances, and interests effectuated by this Order with respect to the Prepetition Goldman Facility shall be final upon the entry of this Order and the payment of the Goldman Indebtedness as provided in Paragraph 4, and no remedy or relief with respect to any Avoidance Action shall involve the re-establishment of any such liens, encumbrances, or interests, or any other interests, in the Collateral; <i>provided, however,</i> that (i) this Paragraph 5(c) shall not apply with respect to the Goldman Facility Indemnity Lien and (ii) nothing in this paragraph or in this Order is intended to or shall prevent or prejudice the right of the Goldman Lenders and/or the Goldman Facility Agent, if any, to seek to obtain, establish, or reinstate any lien, encumbrance, or interest in collateral in the event that in connection with any Avoidance Action or otherwise, the Goldman Lenders and/or the Goldman Facility Agent are required to repay or return funds received, or pay any money into the estate, on account of or in repayment of all or any portion of the Goldman Indebtedness, provided such lien is subject to the Prepetition Liens, the DIP Liens and the Adequate Protection Liens, as defined below; <i>provided, however,</i> that the rights of any parties in interest with respect to any such relief sought are hereby expressly preserved.</p>\n<p>6. <i>Post-Petition Liens.</i> Upon entry of this Order, the Agent, for the benefit of itself and the Lenders, is hereby granted valid, perfected, enforceable, and non-avoidable security interests, liens, and mortgages (the <i>\"DIP Liens\"</i>) in the Collateral; <i>provided, however,</i> in no event shall the Collateral (or any component thereof) include or be deemed to include: (i) the Debtors' claims and causes of action under chapter 5 of the Bankruptcy Code and any other avoidance or similar action under the Bankruptcy Code or similar state law and the proceeds thereof, whether received by judgment, settlement or otherwise; (ii) the Capital Stock of any Foreign Subsidiary, other than 65% in total voting power of such Capital Stock and 100% of non-voting Capital Stock, in each case, of a first tier Foreign Subsidiary of any Obligor; (iii) any contracts, instruments, licenses, license agreements or other documents (or any rights thereunder), to the extent (and only to the extent) that the grant of a security interest would (A) <span class=\"star-pagination\">*131</span> constitute a violation of a restriction in favor of a third party on such grant, (B) give any other party to such contract, instrument, license, license agreement or other document the right to terminate its obligations thereunder, or (C) violate any law; <i>provided,</i> that the limitation set forth in this clause (iii) shall not affect, limit, restrict or impair the grant by an Obligor of a security interest pursuant to the DIP Loan Documents in any such right, to the extent that an otherwise applicable prohibition or restriction on such grant is rendered ineffective by any applicable law, including the Uniform Commercial Code (the \"<i>UCC</i>\") or the Bankruptcy Code; (iv) any direct or indirect interest in any Capital Stock of any joint venture, partnership or other entity if and for so long as the grant of such security interest or Lien shall constitute a default under or termination pursuant to the terms in effect as of the Petition Date of the joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other organizational documents of, or contract or other agreement of (or purporting to cover the assets of) such joint venture, partnership or entity or its direct or indirect parent, or require the payment of a fee, penalty or similar increased costs or result in the loss of economic benefit or the abandonment or invalidation of such Obligor's or any Subsidiary's interest in such Capital Stock or shall otherwise adversely impact such interest in such joint venture, partnership or other entity; <i>provided that</i> the limitation set forth in this clause (iv) shall not affect, limit, restrict or impair the grant by an Obligor of a security interest pursuant to the DIP Loan Documents in any such right, to the extent that an otherwise applicable prohibition or restriction on such grant (whether applicable to such Obligor or to any parent company or Person owned by such Obligor) is rendered ineffective by any applicable law, including the UCC or the Bankruptcy Code; (v) any Ground Lease of a Debtor that has been assumed pursuant to section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code if the granting of a Lien hereunder would cause a default under or allow the termination of such Ground Lease (it being agreed that, to the extent the Lien granted pursuant to this paragraph attaches to any such Ground Lease prior to a Debtor's assumption thereof, such Lien shall automatically be released upon such assumption and any Mortgage evidencing such Lien shall automatically terminate); (vi) the Gift Card and Lotto Accounts; (vii) any Real Estate of the Non-Debtor Guarantor; and (viii) any Shopping Center Properties (defined in Paragraph 8 below) that are subject to a valid, unavoidable, prepetition lien, <i>provided, however,</i> that, notwithstanding anything set forth in the Order or the DIP Documents to the contrary, as security for the obligations under the DIP Loan Documents, the Agent, on behalf of the Lenders, shall have a pledge of the unencumbered equity of any subsidiary holding a Shopping Center Property; <i>provided, further,</i> that any such security interest and Lien shall attach immediately and automatically after any such disqualifying condition specified in clause (iii), (iv) or (v) of this Paragraph shall cease to exist.

(\"<i>U.S. Bank</i>\") in the Main Operating Account, any lien granted to a Lender or any other party shall be subordinated to U.S. Bank's asserted claim to $1,717,336.18 in the Main Operating Account; <i>provided, further,</i> that (i) the rights of any parties in interest to object to U.S. Bank's asserted setoff rights, its claims, and the forms of relief noted herein are expressly preserved and (ii) the Debtors' rights, generally, with respect to the Bank Accounts maintained at U.S. Bank are expressly preserved; <i>provided, further,</i> that other than holders of the Adequate Protection Obligations, the Agent, and the Lenders, no other Person shall have any lien or security interest in the Main Operating Account or in any funds in the Main Operating Account. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the financial institution (the \"<i>Bank</i>\") at which the Main Operating Account is maintained is authorized to charge back, offset, expense or deduct from the Main Operating Account the service charges incurred by the Bank on account of the Debtors' cash management expenses, returned checks or other returned items, including, but not limited to, dishonored checks, wire transfers, drafts, ACH Transfers or other debits, regardless of whether such amounts were deposited prepetition and regardless of whether the returned items relate to prepetition or postpetition items, and that solely the normal service charges and fees (the \"<i>Service Charges</i>\") may be assessed and deducted in the ordinary course of business from funds held in the Main Operating Account, and the automatic stay provisions of section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code are modified to allow the Bank to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*133</span> assess and collect such charges, but the automatic stay shall remain in full force and effect for all other purposes as to the Bank, including, but not limited to, any setoff rights (other than with respect to the Service Charges) that the Bank may possess. Should the Debtors transfer or otherwise utilize funds from the Main Operating Account outside of the Debtors' ordinary course of business, except as otherwise permitted under the DIP Credit Agreement or this Order, the Agent's valid, binding, perfected, enforceable, and non-avoidable liens and fully-perfected security interests in the Main Operating Account (subject and junior only to the liens securing the Adequate Protection Obligations as set forth in Paragraph 8(a) below), and all funds contained therein shall transfer and attach, on the same senior priority basis, to the Debtors' interest in such funds wherever deposited, in the proceeds and other assets created from any such use of the funds held in the Main Operating Account outside the ordinary course of the Debtors' business. During the existence of an Event of Default, all amounts held in the Main Operating Account or any Cash Collateral Account (other than amounts held in the Main Operating Account subject to the Liens in favor of the Adequate Protection Parties), at the election of the Agent, shall be applied as required by section 11.2(e) of the DIP Credit Agreement; <i>provided, however,</i> that notwithstanding the existence of an Event of Default or an acceleration of the Obligations, funds that are not subject to the first lien of the Agent shall not be transferred out of the Main Operating Account other than for ordinary course expenditures to protect and preserve the Collateral (including all documented payroll expenses (including benefits), operating expenses of the Properties, taxes, insurance premiums, ground rents with respect to the Properties, and cash management, in each case, in the ordinary course of business) and the Adequate Protection Payments; <i>provided further,</i> that notwithstanding the existence of an Event of Default or an acceleration of the Obligations, the Debtors may continue to use Cash Collateral so long as such Cash Collateral that is subject to the liens of the Adequate Protection Parties is applied to the Adequate Protection Obligations.</p>\n<p>(d) <i>General Priority of DIP Liens.</i> Subject to the provisions above (including the liens securing the Goldman Facility Indemnity set forth in Paragraph 4 and the Adequate Protection Obligations set forth more particularly in section 8(a) below), the DIP Liens shall, subject to the provisions of the Carve-Out, be at all times senior to the rights of the Debtors, their estates, and all of their creditors, and shall at all times be senior to the rights of any successor trustee, examiner, or responsible person in these or any subsequent proceedings under the Bankruptcy Code.</p>\n<p>(e) <i>Perfection of Postpetition Liens.</i> The Agent shall not be required to file financing statements, mortgages, notices of liens, or other documents in any jurisdiction or take any other action in order to validate, perfect, or establish the priority of the DIP Liens granted to them by this Order or the DIP Loan Documents. The DIP Liens granted in this Order and in the DIP Loan Documents to secure repayment of any of the Obligations are deemed perfected hereby and no further notice, filing or other act shall be required to effect such perfection. If the Lenders shall, in their sole discretion, choose to file (in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the DIP Loan Documents) financing statements, mortgages, or other documents or otherwise confirm perfection of such security interests, liens, and mortgages, the Lenders are authorized <span class=\"star-pagination\">*134</span> (to the extent not prohibited by the DIP Loan Documents) to effect such filings and recordings and all such financing statements, mortgages, or similar documents shall be deemed to have been filed or recorded at the time and on the date of entry of this Order. A photocopy of this Order may, in the discretion of the Lenders, be filed with or recorded in filing or recording offices in addition to or in lieu of such financing statements, notices of lien or similar instruments, and all filing offices are directed hereby to accept such copy of this Order for filing and recording.</p>\n<p>7. <i>Superpriority Administrative Claim Status.</i> The Obligations and the Debtors' use (if any) of Cash Collateral pursuant to the Carve-Out or otherwise pursuant to this Order shall constitute an administrative expense under section 364(c)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code, with priority, subject to the section 507(b) claims of the Adequate Protection Parties as set forth in paragraph 8(b) below and the provisions of the Carve-Out, over all other claims or costs or expenses of administration of the kinds specified in, or ordered pursuant to, any provision of the Bankruptcy Code (the \"<i>Superpriority Administrative Claim</i>\"), and shall at all times be senior to the rights of the Debtors or any successor trustee, examiner, or responsible person in these or any subsequent proceedings under the Bankruptcy Code. With the exception of the fees and expenses permitted by the Carve-Out, no costs or expenses of administration that have been or may be incurred in these cases, any conversion of any of these cases pursuant to sections 105 or 1112 of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise, or in any other future proceedings related hereto, and no priority claims, are or will be prior to or on a parity with any claim of the Lenders against the Debtors arising out of loans and extensions of credit or other financial accommodations made by the Lenders to the Debtors.</p>\n<p>8. <i>Use of Cash Collateral and Adequate Protection Parties.</i> Holders of claims against any of the Debtors, which claims are secured by the \"Shopping Center Properties,\" as such term is defined in the DIP Motion, or in any other real property of a Debtor whose cash constitutes Cash Collateral and whose cash the Debtors use (such properties collectively, the \"<i>Adequate Protection Properties</i>\" and such claimholders collectively, the \"<i>Adequate Protection Parties</i>\"), are entitled, pursuant to sections 361 and 363(e) of the Bankruptcy Code, to adequate protection of their interests in their respective prepetition collateral including the Cash Collateral (collectively, the <i>\"Prepetition Collateral</i>\"), for and equal in amount to the aggregate diminution in the value of the Adequate Protection Parties' interest in the Prepetition Collateral as may be determined by the Court (the \"<i>Aggregate Value Diminution</i>\"). Pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Order and the DIP Loan Documents, each Debtor is authorized to use all Cash Collateral, wherever it may be located and regardless of whether it is in an account controlled by any Adequate Protection Party. All Adequate Protection Parties are ordered to relinquish control over all Cash Collateral to the Debtors and shall not interfere with any effort by the Debtors or their banks to redirect Cash Collateral to the Main Operating Account. As adequate protection, the applicable Adequate Protection Parties are hereby granted the following (collectively, the \"<i>Adequate Protection Obligations</i>\"):</p>\n<p>(a) <i>Adequate Protection Liens.</i> Each applicable Adequate Protection Party is hereby granted (effective and perfected upon the date of this Order and without the necessity of execution by the Debtors <span class=\"star-pagination\">*135</span> of mortgages, security agreements, pledge agreements, financing statements or other agreements) (i) a continuing, valid, binding, enforceable, and automatically perfected postpetition first-priority security interest in, and lien on (A) the Intercompany Claims (as defined in the DIP Motion) that its respective Debtor receives on account of the net cash that flows into the Debtors' centralized Cash Management System and (B) the Main Operating Account (the \"<i>Adequate Protection First Liens</i>\") and (ii) upon the repayment in full of the Goldman Indebtedness pursuant to Paragraph 4 of this Order, a second-priority lien on the properties currently securing the Prepetition Goldman Facility (the \"<i>Adequate Protection Second Liens</i>\"), which liens shall be junior to (a) the DIP Liens and (b) the Goldman Facility Indemnity Lien, in each case of (A) and (B) above, in an amount equal to the lesser of (x) the Aggregate Value Diminution (after taking into account the value of the Prepetition Collateral) and (y) the postpetition net positive balance of the Intercompany Claim of the Debtor whose property constitutes Prepetition Collateral of the Adequate Protection Party (the Adequate Protection First Liens and the Adequate Protection Second Liens granted to each Adequate Protection Party pursuant to this paragraph, collectively, the \"<i>Adequate Protection Liens</i>\"); <i>provided, however,</i> that the Adequate Protection Liens shall be subject and subordinate only to any liens on the Collateral that are senior to, or pari passu with, the Prepetition Liens and the Carve-Out, and <i>provided further,</i> however, that notwithstanding the above, the Adequate Protection Second Liens shall be subject and subordinate to the DIP Liens and the Goldman Facility Indemnity Lien. Whether or not payments on account of the Adequate Protection Obligations are made, the holders of the Adequate Protection Second Liens shall not be entitled to exercise any rights or remedies with respect to the Adequate Protection Second Liens until the Obligations have been paid in full in cash or converted to equity and/or post reorganization debt in the manner contemplated by the DIP Credit Agreement. Notwithstanding anything set forth herein, until the DIP Obligations are paid in full, the Debtors shall not use the Collateral or the sale proceeds thereof to pay the Adequate Protection Obligations.

Any financial reports provided by the Debtors pursuant to this paragraph 8(e) shall be simultaneously provided to counsel to the Lenders and counsel to the Creditors' Committee.</p>\n<p>9. <i>Carve-Out.</i> The DIP Liens, the Adequate Protection Liens, and the Superpriority Administrative Claim shall be subject to: (i) any unpaid fees due to the United States Trustee pursuant to section 1930 of title 28 of the United States Code or otherwise and any fees due to the Clerk of the Court of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York; (ii) all reasonable fees and expenses incurred by a trustee under section 726(b) of the Bankruptcy Code in an amount not exceeding $500,000 (the \"<i>Chapter 7 Carve-Out\");</i> (iii) the reasonable expenses of members of any statutory committee (excluding fees and expenses of professional persons employed by such committee members individually); (iv) to the extent allowed at any time, all unpaid fees and expenses allowed by the Bankruptcy Court of professionals or professional firms retained pursuant to section 327 or 1103 of the Bankruptcy Code (the \"<i>Professional Persons</i>\") through the date of the acceleration of the maturity of the Term Loan; and (v) after the date of acceleration of the maturity of the Term Loan, to the extent allowed at any time, the payment of the fees and expenses of Professional Persons in an aggregate amount not to exceed $25 million minus the Chapter 7 Carve-Out (plus the amounts specified in items (i) through (iv) hereof) (the amount of all such permitted uses being defined herein as the \"<i>Carve-Out</i>\"). The Carve-Out shall exclude any fees and expenses incurred in connection with (a) any action or inaction that is in violation of or a default under any of the DIP Documents or this Order or (b) the assertion or joinder in any claim, counterclaim, action, proceeding, application, motion, objection, defenses or other contested matter, the purpose of which is to seek any order, judgment, determination or similar relief (x) invalidating, setting aside, avoiding, or subordinating, in whole or in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*137</span> part, (i) the Obligations, (ii) the DIP Liens, or (iii) any of the Agent's or Lenders' rights under the DIP Documents or (y) preventing, hindering, or delaying, whether directly or indirectly, the Agent's or Lenders' assertion or enforcement of the DIP Liens or realization upon any Collateral.</p>\n<p>10. <i>Authorization to Use Proceeds of DIP Loan Documents.</i> To the extent that the Lenders make advances or extend credit under this Order and the DIP Credit Agreement, the Debtors shall use such loans, and shall otherwise use their Cash Collateral and other assets, solely in a manner that is consistent with the terms of this Order and the DIP Loan Documents. So long as the Term Loan has not been accelerated, the Debtors are hereby authorized to use any cash proceeds of the Collateral as provided in this Order and the DIP Loan Documents.</p>\n<p>11. <i>Limitations on the Use of Proceeds.</i> No proceeds of loans or other financial accommodations made by the Lenders hereunder, and no Cash Collateral (including the Carve-Out), may be used to compensate services rendered or expenses incurred in connection with, directly or indirectly, (i) the modification, stay, or amendment of this Order without the consent of the Lenders or (ii) a violation, breach, or default of this Order or any of the DIP Documents, including, without limitation, any claim or action the purpose of which is to seek or the result of which would be to obtain any relief (a) invalidating, setting aside, avoiding, or subordinating, in whole or in part, any of the Obligations or the DIP Liens in the Collateral or (b) preventing, hindering, or otherwise delaying, whether directly or indirectly, the Lenders' or the Agent's assertion, enforcement, or realization upon any Collateral as permitted by this Order or such documents.</p>\n<p>12. <i>Sale of the Collateral and Resulting Proceeds.</i> Any proceeds of the sale, lease, or other disposition of the Collateral shall be applied in the manner consistent with this Order and the terms of the DIP Loan Documents, and the Debtors hereby irrevocably waive any right to direct the manner or application of any payments to the Lenders or any other receipts by the Lenders of proceeds of the Collateral contrary to the provisions of the DIP Loan Documents.

Any Adequate Protection Party who wishes to revise the contact information contained in the Adequate Protection Party Exhibit shall notify the Debtors in writing of such change and, to the extent one Adequate Protection Party seeks to replace another, such Adequate Protection Party shall also provide notice to the Adequate Protection Party to be replaced (the \"<i>Replacement Notice</i>\") which Replacement Notice shall be countersigned by the Adequate Protection Party to be replaced or such other arrangement as the Debtors may determine in their sole discretion shall be acceptable to evidence the replacement of the applicable Adequate Protection Party.</p>\n<p>(k) <i>Reimbursement of Costs and Expenses.</i> The Agent and Lenders shall be promptly reimbursed by the Debtors without further motion to, hearing by, or order of this Court for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including, without limitation, all filing and recording fees, attorneys' and paralegals' fees and expenses, and out-of-pocket expenses) (the \"<i>Expense Reimbursement</i>\"), in each case, as provided for in the DIP Documents; <i>provided, however,</i> that the Agent shall serve, by facsimile or electronic mail, each Expense Reimbursement on the United States Trustee, counsel to the Debtors, and counsel to the Creditors' Committee (the \"<i>Expense Reimbursement Notice Parties</i>\"). If, after ten (10) Business Days after receipt by the Expense Reimbursement Notice Parties of any Expense Reimbursement, the Expense Reimbursement Notice Parties do not deliver to the Agent an objection to the reasonableness of such Expense Reimbursement, then the Debtors shall promptly pay the Agent and the Lenders such Expense Reimbursement.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*142</span> <i>(l) Releases.</i> The Debtors hereby each release and discharge the Agent, the Lenders, and their attorneys, officers, directors, affiliates, agents, and employees (the \"<i>Lender Parties</i>\") from any and all claims and causes of action arising out of the Lender Parties' relationship with any of the Debtors in connection with, in any manner directly or indirectly, the Loan Documents, this Order, the negotiation of any of the foregoing, or any action or inaction in connection therewith or the facilities, consideration, agreements, documents, or reimbursements related to the foregoing.</p>\n<p>(m) <i>No Third Party Beneficiary.</i> No party not referenced in this Order is intended to be or shall be deemed to be a third party beneficiary of the provisions of this Order or any of the DIP Documents.</p>\n<p>(n) <i>Action by Lenders.</i> Any action authorized to be taken on behalf of the Lenders as a whole by the Majority Lenders or by the Agent pursuant the terms of any of the DIP Documents shall be deemed to be the action of the Lenders under this Order.</p>\n<p>(<i>o</i>) <i>Amendment of Order.</i> The Debtors shall, with the consent of the DIP Lenders, be entitled to amend this Order so as to make any non-substantive, non-material changes, <i>provided</i> that the Debtors provide counsel to the Creditors' Committee and the Order Amendment Notice Parties five (5) Business Days' notice in advance of any such amendment (the \"<i>Order Amendment Notice Period</i>\") and the Debtors shall file such amended order with the Court; <i>provided, further,</i> that if the Order Amendment Notice Parties or the Creditors' Committee notify the Debtors and the Agent that it objects to such an amendment to the Order within the Order Amendment Notice Period, such amended Order shall not become effective absent entry of an Order of the Court authorizing such amendment unless such objection is resolved or withdrawn. Notice of any amendment of the Order shall be provided to all parties entitled to receive notice of such amended Order.</p>\n<p>(p) <i>Order Controlling.</i> To the extent any terms of this Order are inconsistent with the terms set forth in the DIP Documents, the terms of this Order shall control.</p>\n<p>18. <i>Limitations on Liens.</i> Notwithstanding anything in this Order, (including clause (viii) in the first paragraph of Paragraph 6 above), any order authorizing use of cash collateral entered prior to the date hereof, any Order entered approving the operation of the Debtors' cash management system (including docket #43), the DIP Credit Agreement and related documents to the contrary, the Debtors are not authorized to use distributions on account of the direct or indirect equity interests in GGP Ivanhoe, Inc., or its subsidiaries, including cash dividends, the equity interests, or any proceeds of the foregoing, to the extent subject to the lien of Ivanhoe Capital LP and nothing herein or in the other Orders and documents referred to above shall be deemed to authorize or grant a lien or security interest to, or encumbrance in favor of, any party in or on any of such property or any of the proceeds thereof or to eliminate, modify, subordinate or cut off any lien or security interest Ivanhoe Capital LP would otherwise have, if any, in such property or proceeds. The foregoing shall not prejudice the right of the Debtors and Ivanhoe Capital LP to seek further relief from the Court after notice to each other nor prevent GGP Limited Partnership or the any of the Debtors from using Ivanhoe Capital LP's cash collateral upon consent by Ivanhoe Capital LP.</p>\n<p>19. <i>Immediate Effectiveness.</i> Notwithstanding Bankruptcy Rules 6004(h), <span class=\"star-pagination\">*143</span> 6006(d), 7062, or 9014 or any other Bankruptcy Rule, or Rule 62(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, this Order shall be valid and fully effective immediately upon its entry, and, upon such entry, shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Agent, the Lenders, the Debtors, their estates, and their respective successors and assigns (including, without limitation, any trustee, examiner, or responsible person hereinafter appointed as a representative of any of the estates in these or any subsequent proceedings under the Bankruptcy Code), and the terms and provisions of this Order as well as the liens, security interests, and mortgages and other terms of the DIP Credit Agreement and the other DIP Documents shall continue in these proceedings and any superseding proceedings under the Bankruptcy Code, and such liens, security interests, and mortgages shall maintain their priority as provided by this Order, until satisfied and discharged. This Order likewise shall be immediately binding and effective on the terms set forth above with respect to any other debtor that shall become part of the Case upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition or entry of the order for relief for such debtor, and, at such time, such debtor shall be deemed party to all of the DIP Documents; <i>provided, however,</i> that with respect to such subsequent debtor, subject to (x) the right of any party in interest to move, within 20 days after the date on which such subsequent debtor files its bankruptcy petition, to restrict the application of this Order to the subsequent debtor's case and (y) the Debtors' rights to object to such relief.</p>\n<p>20. <i>Notice.</i> The Debtors shall, within three (3) Business Days, serve by mail a copy of this Order on the Notice Parties and any other persons which the Debtors know are entitled to notice under Bankruptcy Rule 4001(c).

Subject to Section 10.1, the Lenders agree, on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, to make a single advance in the amount equal to its Commitment or such lesser amount as is authorized by the Financing Order to the Borrowers on or, at the Lenders' option, before the date which is two (2) Business Days following the Entry Date.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*175</span> (b) No Liability.

The Agent shall record on its books the principal amount of the Term Loan owing to each Lender from time to time. In addition, each Lender is authorized, at such Lender's option, to note the date and amount of each payment or prepayment of principal of such Lender's Term Loan in its books and records, including computer records, such books and records constituting presumptive evidence, absent manifest error, of the accuracy of the information contained therein.</p>\n<p>(d) Term Notes.

Subject to Section 2.5, all interest charges on the Obligations shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and actual days elapsed (which results in more interest being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365-day year).</p>\n<p>(b) The basis for determining the LIBOR Rate and the Interest Period with respect to the Term Loan or any portion of the Term Loan (as the Borrowers may elect), shall be selected by the Borrowers and notified to Agent pursuant to the applicable Funding Notice or Continuation Notice, as the case may be.</p>\n<p>(c) The Borrowers shall deliver a Continuation Notice to Agent no later than 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) at least three Business Days in advance of the expiration of any Interest Period.</p>\n<p>(d) In the event the Borrowers fail to specify an Interest Period for determining the LIBOR Rate in the applicable Funding Notice or Continuation Notice, or if the Borrowers fail to deliver a Continuation Notice as required pursuant to clause (c) above, the LIBOR Rate for <span class=\"star-pagination\">*176</span> the related Term Loan will be automatically determined using one-month LIBOR for purposes of clause (b) of the definition of \"LIBOR Rate.\"</p>\n<p>(e) Default Rate.

Subject to Section 2.5, the Borrowers agree to pay, to the Agent for the Agent's own account, collateral management, agency and administrative fees at the times and in the amounts separately agreed in writing among the Borrowers and the Agent, provided that the amount of such fees shall not exceed $30,000 per month but may be required to be paid annually in advance.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*177</span> ARTICLE 3</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>PAYMENTS AND PREPAYMENTS</h2>\n<p>Section 3.1 Term Loan. The Borrowers jointly and severally agree to repay the outstanding principal balance of the Term Loan plus all accrued but unpaid interest thereon, together with all other non-contingent Obligations, on the Maturity Date; provided that the General Partner (on its own behalf and on behalf of GGPLP) shall have the right to elect to convert the outstanding principal amount of the Term Loan, the Exit Fee and accrued and unpaid interest due and owing upon the Plan Date (the \"Conversion Amount\") to equity and/or debt to the extent permitted by, and in the manner set forth on, Schedule 3.1-A. Accrued and unpaid interest on the Term Loan shall be due and payable on each Payment Date (beginning on June 1, 2009) and on the Maturity Date, and the Borrowers agree to pay such accrued and unpaid interest on such dates (it being understood that the payment of interest on the Maturity Date may be paid by conversion of such amounts to the extent permitted by the preceding sentence).</p>\n<p>Section 3.2 Optional Prepayment of the Term Loan. The Borrowers may prepay the principal of the Term Loan, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time by (a) providing to the Agent two (2) Business Days prior written notice of its intention to make such prepayment and (b) paying to the Agent (i) all accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being prepaid and (ii) the required Exit Fee, in each case concurrently with the making of such prepayment; provided, however, that each such optional prepayment shall be in a minimum principal amount of $1,000,000 and integral multiples of $500,000 in excess thereof.</p>\n<p>Section 3.3 Mandatory Prepayments of the Term Loan. The Borrowers shall prepay the principal amount of the Term Loan at the following times and in the following amounts:</p>\n<p>(a) (i) in the case of a sale or disposition pursuant to Section 9.8(d) within two (2) Business Days (during which period no Obligor shall be entitled to make any Restricted Payments) and (ii) in the case of any sale or disposition of condominiums pursuant to Section 9.8(f)(i), on or before the last Business Day of the applicable Fiscal Quarter during which such sale or disposition was made of (A) any First Lien Property (or any Debtor owning such First Lien Property or its direct or indirect parent holding company) or (B) any Negative Pledge Property (or any Debtor owning such Negative Pledge Property or its direct or indirect parent holding company), all proceeds of such sale or other disposition net of (1) the reasonable and customary out-of-pocket costs and expenses of such sale or disposition paid to Persons that are not Obligors or their Subsidiaries, (2) the amount applied to all obligations secured by a Pre-Petition Lien on the asset being sold or the Capital Stock of the Person (or the direct holding company of such Person) owning such asset being sold which is secured by any Pre-Petition Lien, (3) the amount of sales and transfer taxes that are payable by a Debtor or any Affiliate in connection therewith, (4) in the case of a sale or disposition of (x) First Lien Property, to the extent the net proceeds of all such sales or dispositions since the Closing Date exceed $75,000,000 in the aggregate and (y) Negative Pledge Property, the Negative Pledge Property <span class=\"star-pagination\">*178</span> Retention Amount, if applicable, and (5) an amount equal to the Exit Fee that will be payable in connection with such sale or disposition;</p>\n<p>(b) with respect to the Loss Proceeds of any Casualty or Condemnation with respect to any Property of any Debtor, at the time and in the amount of such prepayment as required by Section 9.4(e), net of an amount equal to the Exit Fee that will be payable in connection with the application of such Loss Proceeds;</p>\n<p>(c) notwithstanding any of the other provisions of this Section 3.3, so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, if any prepayment of the Term Loan is required to be made on a date other than on the last day of the Interest Period therefor and Breakage Costs would be payable as a result of prepayment on such other date, the Borrowers may, if Lenders have been requested in writing to, and have elected not to, waive such Breakage Costs, retain such amount of any such prepayment otherwise required to be made hereunder in a Breakage Prepayment Account (or pursuant to other arrangements satisfactory to the Agent) until the last day of such Interest Period, at which time such prepayment shall be made. For purposes of this clause (c), the term \"Breakage Prepayment Account\" means a deposit or securities account established by a Borrower with a bank or other financial institution designated by the Agent and over which the Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal for application in accordance with this clause (c), pursuant to an account control agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Agent. If the maturity of the Term Loan has been accelerated pursuant to Section 11.2, or if the Term Loan has matured in accordance with its terms the Agent shall at the direction of the Majority Lenders, apply all amounts on deposit in the Breakage Prepayment Accounts (or otherwise held by the Agent) to satisfy any of the Obligations; and</p>\n<p>(d) notwithstanding any of the other provisions of this Section 3.3, so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, any prepayment of the Term Loan required to be made pursuant to this Section may, at the election of the Borrowers, be maintained in a Prepayment Cash Collateral Account (or pursuant to other arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Agent) and, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, such amount shall not be required to be applied to reduce the principal amount of the Term Loan at such time as would otherwise be required by this Section 3.3. For purposes of this clause (d), the term \"Prepayment Cash Collateral Account\" means a deposit or securities account established by a Borrower with a bank designated by the Agent and over which the Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal for application in accordance with this clause (d), provided that the Borrowers shall have the right to reasonably direct the investment of amounts on deposit in a Prepayment Cash Collateral Account in Cash Equivalents as the Borrowers shall elect. If the maturity of the Term Loan has been accelerated pursuant to Section 11.2 or if the Term Loan has matured in accordance with its terms, the Agent shall at the direction of the Majority Lenders apply all amounts on deposit in the Prepayment Cash Collateral Accounts (or otherwise held by the Agent) to satisfy any of the Obligations.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*179</span> Section 3.4 Payments by the Borrowers.</p>\n<p>(a) All payments to be made by the Borrowers shall be made without set-off, recoupment, or counterclaim except as otherwise expressly permitted hereunder. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrowers shall be made to the Agent, for the account of the Lenders (but in any event in one wire transfer), at the Agent's address set forth in Section 15.7, and shall be made in Dollars and in immediately available funds, no later than 3:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the date specified herein. Any payment received by the Agent later than 3:00 p.m. (New York City time) may, at the option of the Agent, be deemed to have been received on the following Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue.</p>\n<p>(b) Unless the Agent receives notice from the Borrowers prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders that the Borrowers will not make such payment in full as and when required, the Agent may assume that the Borrowers have made such payment in full to the Agent on such date in immediately available funds and the Agent may (but shall not be so required), in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to each Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender. If and to the extent the Borrowers have not made such payment in full to the Agent, each Lender shall repay to the Agent on demand such amount distributed to such Lender, together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Rate for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date repaid.</p>\n<p>(c) The Borrowers agree to compensate each Lender for any loss, cost or expense (collectively, \"Breakage Costs\") actually incurred by such Lender as a result of the making of a payment of the Term Loan for any reason (including, without limitation, the acceleration of the maturity of the Term Loan following an Event of Default) on a day that is not the last day of the applicable interest period. To avoid doubt \"Breakage Costs\" shall not include the interest margins applicable to such prepaid Term Loan. Each Lender will furnish to the Borrowers a certificate setting forth the basis and amount of each request by such Lender for compensation under this Section 3.4(c), which certificate shall provide reasonable detail as to the calculation of such Breakage Costs. Such certificate shall constitute prima facie evidence of the amount of such Breakage Costs, which shall be calculated by each Lender on a reasonable basis, consistent with the basis on which such calculations are then being made by similarly situated banks or financial institutions generally.</p>\n<p>Section 3.5 Apportionment, Application, and Reversal of Payments. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, aggregate principal and interest payments shall be apportioned ratably among the Lenders (according to the unpaid principal balance of the Term Loan to which such payments relate held by each Lender) and payments of the fees (including, without limitation, the Exit Fees) shall, as applicable, be apportioned ratably among the Lenders as of the date such fees are received by the Agent. Except as specifically provided otherwise herein or in the Financing Order, all payments shall be remitted to the Agent and all such payments not constituting payment of specific fees, and all proceeds of Accounts or other Collateral received by the Agent, shall be applied, ratably, subject to the provisions of this Agreement, FIRST, to pay any interest or fees then due with respect to, or which constitute, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*180</span> Obligations, SECOND, to pay or prepay principal of the Term Loan under this Agreement, and THIRD, to the payment of any other Obligation. The Agent shall promptly distribute to each Lender, pursuant to the applicable wire transfer instructions received from each Lender in writing, such funds as it may be entitled to receive.</p>\n<p>Section 3.6 Indemnity for Returned Payments. If, after receipt of any payment which is applied to the payment of all or any part of the Obligations, the Agent or any Lender is for any reason compelled to surrender such payment or proceeds to any Person because such payment or application of proceeds is invalidated, declared fraudulent, set aside, determined to be void or voidable as a preference, impermissible set-off, or a diversion of trust funds, or for any other reason, then the Obligations or part thereof intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued and this Agreement shall continue in full force as if such payment or proceeds had not been received by the Agent or such Lender and the Borrowers shall be liable to pay to the Agent and the Lenders, and hereby do indemnify the Agent and the Lenders and hold the Agent and the Lenders harmless for, the amount of such payment or proceeds surrendered. The provisions of this Section 3.6 shall be and remain effective notwithstanding any contrary action which may have been taken by the Agent or any Lender in reliance upon such payment or application of proceeds, and any such contrary action so taken shall be without prejudice to the Agent's and the Lenders' rights under this Agreement and shall be deemed to have been conditioned upon such payment or application of proceeds having become final and irrevocable. The provisions of this Section 3.6 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.</p>\n<p>Section 3.7 The Agent's Books and Records. The Obligors agree that the Agent's books and records showing the Obligations and the transactions pursuant to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be admissible in any action or proceeding arising therefrom, and shall constitute rebuttably presumptive proof thereof, irrespective of whether any Obligation is also evidenced by a promissory note or other instrument. Such books and records shall be deemed correct, accurate, and binding on the Borrowers and an account stated (except for corrections of errors discovered by the Agent) in the absence of evidence to the contrary. In the event a timely written notice of objections is given by the Borrowers, only the items to which exception is expressly made will be considered to be disputed by the Borrowers.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>ARTICLE 4</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>CASH COLLATERAL ACCOUNTS</h2>\n<p>Section 4.1 Cash Collateral Accounts.</p>\n<p>(a) All cash of the Obligors shall be deposited by the Obligors in one or more accounts subject to the perfected Agent's Lien by virtue of, and having the priority set forth in, the Financing Order and, except for the Main Operating Account, if at any time required by the Agent upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, under its exclusive dominion and control upon written notice to the General Partner and the applicable financial institution. Such funds shall be held in a Cash Collateral Account until such time as the amounts held therein are applied by the relevant Obligors to pay expenses or otherwise <span class=\"star-pagination\">*181</span> used in accordance with this Agreement. So long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, amounts held in a Cash Collateral Account shall be available to the Obligors for use in a manner or for a purpose not prohibited by this Agreement. During the existence of an Event of Default all amounts held in any Cash Collateral Account (other than amounts held in the Main Operating Account subject to the Liens in favor of the Adequate Protection Parties (as defined in the Financing Order)), at the election of the Agent, shall be applied as required by Section 11.2(e); provided that during the existence of an Event of Default (1) notwithstanding the existence of such Event of Default or an acceleration of the Obligations, funds in the Main Operating Account that are not subject to the first priority Agent's Lien shall not be transferred out of the Main Operating Account other than for ordinary course expenditures to protect and preserve the Collateral, (including all documented payroll expenses (including benefits), operating expenses of the Properties, taxes, insurance premiums, ground rents with respect to the Properties, and cash management, in each case, in the ordinary course of business, and the adequate protection payments) and (2) funds in any Cash Collateral Account that are subject to the first priority Agent's Lien (x) may, until otherwise directed by Agent, be transferred out of the Cash Collateral Accounts only for ordinary course expenditures to protect and preserve the Collateral (including all documented payroll expenses (including benefits), operating expenses of the Properties, taxes, insurance premiums, ground rents with respect to the Properties, and cash management, in each case, in the ordinary course of business and (y) at the Agent's sole discretion and with the consent of the Majority Lenders, any funds in the Cash Collateral Accounts that are subject to the first priority Agent's Lien may instead be applied at the direction of the Agent.</p>\n<p>(b) If no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Obligors may invest the funds in any Cash Collateral Account as permitted by the Bankruptcy Court.</p>\n<p>(c) The Non-Debtor Guarantor shall maintain one or more accounts for the collection of the revenues and income of the Non-Debtor Guarantor and its Subsidiaries.

any change or alteration that is adverse in any material respect to the Lenders to (i) the consolidated cash management system of the Obligors, as such system existed on the Petition Date (other than changes in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices), or (ii) any order entered by the Bankruptcy Court in the Debtors' chapter 11 cases approving such cash management system, or</p>\n<p>(p) a Change in Control.</p>\n<p>Section 11.2 Remedies.</p>\n<p>(a) If an Event of Default exists, the Agent may, in its discretion, and shall, at the direction of the Majority Lenders, at any time or times and in any order, without notice to or demand on any Obligor, restrict the amount of or refuse to permit any Lender to make the Term Loan. If an Event of Default exists, the Agent shall, at the direction of the Majority Lenders, do one or more of the following, in addition to the action described in the preceding sentence, at any time or times and in any order, without notice to or demand on any Obligor except as required by Section 11.2(e): (A) terminate the Commitments and the other obligations of the Agent and the Lenders under this Agreement; (B) declare any or all Obligations to be immediately due and payable; and (C) pursue its other rights and remedies under the Loan Documents, the Financing Order and/or applicable law. Except as otherwise provided in the Financing Order, the Agent and the Lenders may exercise any of the foregoing remedies without demand and without further application to or order of the Bankruptcy Court.</p>\n<p>(b) Each Obligor recognizes that the Agent may be unable to effect a public sale of any or all of the Collateral that constitutes securities to be sold by reason of certain prohibitions contained in the laws of any jurisdiction outside the United States or in applicable federal or state securities laws but may be compelled to resort to one or more private sales thereof to a restricted group of purchasers who will be obliged to agree, among other things, to acquire such Collateral to be sold for their own account for investment and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof. Each Obligor acknowledges and agrees that any such private sale may result in prices and other terms less favorable to the seller than if such sale were a public sale and, notwithstanding such circumstances, agrees that any such private sale shall, to the extent permitted by law, be deemed to have been made in a commercially reasonable manner. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*229</span> Unless required by a Legal Requirement, the Agent shall not be under any obligation to delay a sale of any of such Collateral to be sold for the period of time necessary to permit the issuer of such securities to register such securities under the laws of any jurisdiction outside the United States or under any applicable federal or state securities laws, even if such issuer would agree to do so. Each Obligor further agrees to do or cause to be done, to the extent that such Obligor may do so under Legal Requirements, all such other acts and things as may be necessary to make such sales or resales of any portion or all of such Collateral or other property to be sold valid and binding and in compliance with any and all Legal Requirements at the Obligors' expense. Each Obligor further agrees that a breach of any of the covenants contained in this Section 11.2(b) will cause irreparable injury to the Agent and the Lenders for which there is no adequate remedy at law and, as a consequence, agrees that each covenant contained in this Section 11.2(b) shall be specifically enforceable against such Obligor, and each Obligor hereby waives and agrees, to the fullest extent permitted by law, not to assert as a defense against an action for specific performance of such covenants that (i) such Obligor's failure to perform such covenants will not cause irreparable injury to the Agent and the Lenders or (ii) the Agent or the Lenders have an adequate remedy at law in respect of such breach. Each Obligor further acknowledges the impossibility of ascertaining the amount of damages which would be suffered by the Agent and the Lenders by reason of a breach of any of the covenants contained in this Section 11.2(b) and, consequently, agrees that, if such Obligor shall breach any of such covenants and the Agent or the Lenders shall sue for damages for such breach, such Obligor shall pay to the Agent, for the benefit of the Agent and the Lenders, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, an aggregate amount equal to the value of the Collateral or other property to be sold on the date the Agent shall demand compliance with this Section 11.2(b).</p>\n<p>(c) If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing: (i) the Agent shall have for the benefit of the Lenders, in addition to all other rights of the Agent and the Lenders, the rights and remedies of a secured party under the UCC; (ii) the Agent may, at any time, take possession of, foreclose on and/or request a receiver of the Collateral and keep it on any Obligor's premises, at no cost to the Agent or any Lender, or remove any part of it to such other place or places as the Agent may desire, or the Obligors shall, upon the Agent's demand, at the Obligors' cost, assemble the Collateral and make it available to the Agent at a place reasonably convenient to the Agent; (iii) the Agent may sell and deliver any Collateral at public or private sales, for cash, upon credit, or otherwise, at such prices and upon such terms as the Agent deems advisable, in its sole discretion, and may, if the Agent deems it reasonable, postpone or adjourn any sale of the Collateral by an announcement at the time and place of sale or of such postponed or adjourned sale, (iv) the Agent may hold, lease, develop, manage, operate, control and otherwise use the First Lien Properties upon such terms and conditions as the Agent may deem reasonable under the circumstances (making such repairs, alterations, additions and improvements and taking other actions, from time to time, as the Agent deems reasonably necessary or desirable), exercise all such rights and powers of each Obligor with respect to the First Lien Properties, whether in the name of Obligor or otherwise, including without limitation the right to make, cancel, enforce or modify leases, obtain and evict tenants, and demand, sue for, collect and receive all rents, in each case, in accordance with the standards applicable to the Agent under the Loan Documents; (v) the Agent may employ consultants to inspect the First Lien Properties and to assure compliance by each Obligor of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*230</span> terms and conditions of the Loan Documents and to take any other reasonable actions, as the Agent deems reasonably necessary or desirable, in connection with the First Lien Properties (including preparing for the disposition thereof), and all actual, reasonable, out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred in connection therewith shall be borne by the Obligors and (vi) upon demand from the Agent, the applicable Obligor shall direct the grantor or licensor of, or the contracting party to, any property agreement with respect to any First Lien Property to recognize and accept the Agent, for the benefit of and on behalf of the Lenders, as the party to such agreement for any and all purposes as fully as it would recognize and accept such Obligor and the performance of such Obligor thereunder and, in such events, without further notice or demand and at such Obligor's sole cost and expense, the Agent, for the benefit of and on behalf of the Lenders, may exercise all rights of such Obligor arising under such agreements. Without in any way requiring notice to be given in the following manner, each Obligor agrees that any notice by the Agent of sale, disposition, or other intended action hereunder or in connection herewith, whether required by the UCC or otherwise, shall constitute reasonable notice to such Obligor if such notice is mailed by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, or is delivered personally against receipt, at least ten (10) Business Days prior to such action to the Obligors' address specified in or pursuant to Section 15.7. If any Collateral is sold on terms other than payment in full at the time of sale, no credit shall be given against the Obligations until the Agent or the Lenders receive payment, and if the buyer defaults in payment, the Agent may resell the Collateral. In the event the Agent seeks to take possession of all or any portion of the Collateral by judicial process, each Obligor irrevocably waives: (A) the posting of any bond, surety, or security with respect thereto which might otherwise be required; (B) any demand for possession prior to the commencement of any suit or action to recover the Collateral; and (C) any requirement that the Agent retain possession and not dispose of any Collateral until after trial or final judgment. Each Obligor agrees that the Agent has no obligation to preserve rights to the Collateral or marshal any Collateral for the benefit of any Person. The Agent is hereby granted a license or other right to use, without charge, each Obligor's labels, patents, copyrights, name, trade secrets, trade names, trademarks, and advertising matter, or any similar property, in completing production of, advertising, or selling any Collateral, and each such Obligor's rights under all licenses and all franchise agreements shall inure to the Agent's benefit for such purpose. The proceeds of sale shall be applied first to all expenses of sale, including reasonable attorneys' fees, and then to the Obligations. The Agent will return any excess to the applicable Obligor and the Obligors shall remain liable for any deficiency.</p>\n<p>(d) The Obligors acknowledge and agree that the Lenders would not provide the Term Loan if, among other things, they were not assured that if an Event of Default specifically occurs, the Agent, on behalf of the Lenders, may obtain all amounts in the Cash Collateral Accounts (other than amounts held in the Main Operating Account subject to the Liens in favor of the Adequate Protection Parties (as defined in the Financing Order)) and apply them immediately to the Obligations, and otherwise exercise the other rights and remedies available to the Agent.</p>\n<p>(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) neither the Agent nor any Lender shall take any action under this Section 11.2 (or similar provisions of any Loan <span class=\"star-pagination\">*231</span> Document) except after compliance with any applicable notice requirements applicable thereto set forth in accordance with the Financing Order, and (ii) following the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, all amounts received by the Agent on account of the Obligations, from the Obligors and/or all amounts with respect to the proceeds of any Collateral (including, after the Agent has given the General Partner notice of the exercise of control, all amounts in the Cash Collateral Accounts, other than amounts held in the Main Operating Account subject to the Liens in favor of the Adequate Protection Parties (as defined in the Financing Order)) shall be (subject to the proviso below) promptly disbursed by the Agent as follows, unless otherwise agreed by the Agent and the Majority Lenders: (A) first, to the payment of expenses incurred by the Agent in the performance of its duties and the enforcement of the rights and remedies of the Agent and the Lenders under the Loan Documents, including, without limitation, all costs and expenses of collection, reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs and other amounts required to be paid or reimbursed by the Obligors to the Agent or the Lenders as provided by this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents; (B) second, to the Lenders, pro rata in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares, until interest accrued on the Term Loan has been paid in full; (C) third, to the Lenders, pro rata in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares, until principal of the Term Loan then due and payable (if any) has been paid in full; (D) fourth, to the Agent, any remaining amount owed to the Agent pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (E) fifth, to each Lender, any remaining amount owed to such Lender pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any other Loan Document hereof multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is all remaining amounts owed to such Lender hereunder and thereunder and the denominator of which is the aggregate of all remaining amounts due all Lenders hereunder and thereunder, until all such remaining amounts have been paid in full and (F) lastly, to the extent the non-contingent Obligations have been paid in full, to the Borrowers; provided that during the existence of an Event of Default (1) notwithstanding the existence of such Event of Default or an acceleration of the Obligations, funds in the Main Operating Account that are not subject to the first priority Agent's Lien shall not be transferred out of the Main Operating Account other than for ordinary course expenditures to protect and preserve the Collateral (including all documented payroll expenses (including benefits), operating expenses of the Properties, taxes, insurance premiums, ground rents with respect to the Properties, and cash management, in each case, in the ordinary course of business, and the adequate protection payments), (2) funds in any Cash Collateral Account that are subject to the first priority Agent's Lien (x) may, until otherwise directed by Agent, be transferred out of the Cash Collateral Accounts only for ordinary course expenditures to protect and preserve the Adequate Protection Properties (as defined in the Financing Order) (including all documented payroll expenses (including benefits), operating expenses of such Properties, taxes, insurance premiums, ground rents with respect to such Properties, and cash management, in each case, in the ordinary course of business) and (y) at the Agent's sole discretion and with the consent of the Majority Lenders, any funds in the Cash Collateral Accounts that are subject to the first priority Agent's Lien may instead be applied at the direction of the Agent and (3) all proceeds received by the Agent and the Lenders in respect of sales of Collateral subject to a Pre-Petition Lien shall first be paid to the holder of such Pre-Petition Lien to the extent of its priority interest in such proceeds. The order of priority set forth in this Section 11.2(e) and the related provisions of this Agreement are set forth solely to determine the rights and priorities of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*232</span> Agent and the Lenders as among themselves. The order of priority set forth in this Section 11.2(e) may at any time and from time to time be changed by the Agent and the Lenders without necessity of notice to or consent of or approval by any Obligor or any other Person.</p>\n<p>(f) An Event of Default shall occur as set forth in this Agreement even if an act or circumstance which gives rise, directly or indirectly, to such Event of Default has been authorized by the Bankruptcy Court or another court or tribunal with jurisdiction over the Case. Neither the Agent nor any Lender shall have any obligation whatsoever to object to any relief requested by any Debtor from the Bankruptcy Court or another court or tribunal with jurisdiction over the Case if and because such relief would or may constitute, or would or may lead to, an Event of Default, or the Agent's or any Lender's failure to object to such relief shall not limit the Events of Default under this Agreement, constitute a waiver or release of rights and remedies under this Agreement, estop or preclude the Agent or any Lender from fully enforcing the same, or have any res judicata effect on whether an Event of Default has occurred under this Agreement. Each Debtor shall be fully responsible for determining whether any relief it seeks from the Bankruptcy Court or another court or tribunal with jurisdiction over the Case would or may constitute, or would or may lead to, an Event of Default under this Agreement, and authorization for such relief shall not limit in any manner whatsoever such Debtor's obligation to fully comply with all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement.</p>\n<p>(g) Without limiting the remedies of the Agent and the Lenders hereunder, each Obligor further agrees that a breach of any of the covenants and agreements of the Obligors contained in paragraphs (4) of Schedule 3.1-A will cause irreparable injury to the Agent and the Lenders for which there is no adequate remedy at law and, as a consequence, agrees that each such covenant and agreement contained in paragraphs (4) of Schedule 3.1-A shall be specifically enforceable against such Obligor, and the Agent and the Lenders shall be entitled to obtain injunctive relief with respect thereto without any bond or other security being required, and each Obligor hereby waives and agrees, to the fullest extent permitted by law, not to assert as a defense against an action for specific performance of such covenants that (i) such Obligor's failure to perform such covenants will not cause irreparable injury to the Agent and the Lenders or (ii) the Agent or the Lenders have an adequate remedy at law in respect of such breach.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>ARTICLE 12</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>GUARANTY</h2>\n<p>Section 12.1 Guaranty, Limitation of Liability.</p>\n<p>(a) Each Guarantor, jointly and severally, hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the punctual payment when due, whether at scheduled maturity or on any date of a required prepayment or by acceleration, demand or otherwise, of all Obligations of each other Obligor now or hereafter existing under or in respect of the Loan Documents, whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, and whether for principal, interest, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*233</span> premiums, fees, indemnities, contract causes of action, costs, expenses or otherwise (such Obligations being the \"Guaranteed Obligations\"), and agrees to pay any and all reasonable outof-pocket expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable out-of-pocket fees and expenses of counsel but excluding allocated costs of in-house counsel) incurred by the Agent or any Lender in enforcing any rights under this Guaranty or any other Loan Document. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Guarantor's liability shall extend to all amounts that constitute part of the Guaranteed Obligations and would be owed by any other Obligor to the Agent or any Lender under or in respect of the Loan Documents but for the fact that they are unenforceable or not allowable due to the existence of a bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding involving such other Obligor.</p>\n<p>(b) Each Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably agrees that in the event any payment shall be required to be made to the Agent or any Lender under this Guaranty, such Guarantor will contribute, to the maximum extent permitted by law, such amounts to each other Guarantor so as to maximize the aggregate amount paid to the Agent and the Lenders under or in respect of the Loan Documents.</p>\n<p>Section 12.2 Guaranty Absolute. Each Guarantor guarantees that the Guaranteed Obligations will be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents, regardless of any law, regulation or order now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction affecting any of such terms or the rights of the Agent or any Lender with respect thereto. The Obligations of each Guarantor under or in respect of this Guaranty are independent of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other Obligations of any other Obligor under or in respect of the Loan Documents, and a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against each Guarantor to enforce this Guaranty, irrespective of whether any action is brought against any Borrower or any other Obligor or whether any Borrower or any other Obligor is joined in any such action or actions.

Each Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably agrees not to exercise any rights that it may now have or hereafter acquire against any Borrower or any other Obligor that arise from the existence, payment, performance or enforcement of such Guarantor's Obligations under or in respect of this Guaranty or any other Loan Document, including, without limitation, any right of subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or indemnification and any right to participate in any claim or remedy of the Agent or any Lender against any Borrower or any other Obligor, whether or not such claim, remedy or right arises in equity or under contract, statute or common law, including, without limitation, the right to take or receive from any Borrower or any other Obligor, directly or indirectly, in cash or other property or by set-off or in any other manner, payment or security on account of such claim, remedy or right, unless and until all of the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty shall have been paid in full in cash and the Commitments shall have expired or been terminated. If any amount shall be paid to any Guarantor in violation of the immediately preceding sentence at any time prior to the latest of (a) the payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty and (b) the Maturity Date, such amount shall be received and held in trust for the benefit of the Agent and the Lenders, shall be segregated from other property and funds of such Guarantor and shall forthwith be paid or delivered to the Agent in the same form as so received (with any necessary endorsement or assignment) to be credited and applied to the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents, or to be held as Collateral for any Guaranteed Obligations or other amounts payable under this Guaranty thereafter arising. If (i) any Guarantor shall make payment to the Agent of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations, (ii) all of the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty shall have been paid in full in cash and (iii) the Maturity Date shall have occurred, the Agent and the Lenders will, at such Guarantor's request and expense, execute and deliver to such Guarantor appropriate documents, without recourse and without representation or warranty, necessary to evidence the transfer by subrogation to such Guarantor of an interest in the Guaranteed Obligations resulting from such payment made by such Guarantor pursuant to this Guaranty.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*236</span> Section 12.5 Guaranty Supplements.

No Guarantor shall have the right to assign its rights hereunder or any interest herein or delegate any of its duties, liabilities or obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document without the prior written consent of the Majority Lenders.</p>\n<p>Section 12.7 Limitation on Guaranty. Notwithstanding any provision of this Guaranty to the contrary, it is intended that this Guaranty, and any Liens granted hereunder by each Guarantor to secure the obligations and liabilities arising pursuant to this Guaranty, not constitute a \"Fraudulent Conveyance\" (as defined below). Consequently, each Guarantor agrees that if this Guaranty, or any Liens securing the obligations and liabilities arising pursuant to this Guaranty, would, but for the application of this sentence, constitute a Fraudulent Conveyance, this Guaranty and each such Lien shall be valid and enforceable only to the maximum extent that would not cause this Guaranty or such Lien to constitute a Fraudulent Conveyance, and this Guaranty shall automatically be deemed to have been amended accordingly at all relevant times. For purposes hereof, \"Fraudulent Conveyance\" means a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer applicable under Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code or any fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer under the provisions of any applicable fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer law or similar law of any state, nation or other governmental unit, as in effect from time to time.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*237</span> ARTICLE 13</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>AMENDMENTS; WAIVERS; PARTICIPATIONS; ASSIGNMENTS; SUCCESSORS</h2>\n<p>Section 13.1 No Waivers; Cumulative Remedies. No failure by the Agent or any Lender to exercise any right, remedy, or option under this Agreement, or in any other agreement between or among any Obligor and the Agent and/or any Lender, or delay by the Agent or any Lender in exercising the same, will operate as a waiver thereof. No waiver by the Agent or the Lenders on any occasion shall affect or diminish the Agent's and each Lender's rights thereafter to require strict performance by any Obligor of any provision of this Agreement. The Agent's and each Lender's rights will be cumulative and not exclusive of any other right or remedy.</p>\n<p>Section 13.2 Amendments and Waivers. No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, and no consent with respect to any departure by any Obligor therefrom, shall be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Majority Lenders (or by the Agent at the written consent of the Majority Lenders) and the Obligors and then any such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given, provided that no such waiver, amendment, or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by all the affected Lenders, do any of the following:</p>\n<blockquote>(a) increase or extend the Commitment of any Lender;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(b) postpone or delay any date fixed by this Agreement or any other Loan Document for any payment of principal, interest or fees;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(c) reduce the principal of, or the rate of interest specified herein on, the Term Loan or reduce any fees payable hereunder or under any other Loan Document;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(d) amend this Section;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(e) release all or substantially all of the Collateral or all or substantially all of the value of the Guarantees under Article 12;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(f) change the definition of Majority Lenders;

provided that the Obligors and the Agent may continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with the interest so assigned to an Assignee until (x) written notice of such assignment, together with payment instructions, addresses, and related information with respect to the Assignee, shall have been given to the General Partner and the Agent by such Lender and the Assignee; and (y) such Lender and its Assignee shall have delivered to the Agent an Assignment and Acceptance in a form reasonably acceptable to the Agent (\"Assignment and Acceptance\") together with any Term Note or Term Notes subject to such assignment and a recordation fee (payable by such Lender or such Assignee) of $3,500.</p>\n<p>(b) From and after the date that the Agent notifies the assignor Lender that it has received an executed Assignment and Acceptance, (i) the Assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent that rights and obligations have been assigned to it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, shall have the rights and obligations of a Lender under the Loan Documents (including the obligations pursuant to Schedule 3.1-A and Schedule 3.1-B), and (ii) the assignor Lender shall, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents have been assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, relinquish its rights and be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all or the remaining portion of an assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto).</p>\n<p>(c) By executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance, the assigning Lender thereunder and the Assignee thereunder confirm to and agree with each other and the other parties hereto as follows: (i) other than as provided in such Assignment and Acceptance, such assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to any statements, warranties, or representations made in or in connection with this Agreement or the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency, or value of this Agreement or any other Loan Document furnished pursuant hereto or the attachment, perfection, or priority of any Lien granted by any Obligor to the Agent or any Lender in the Collateral; (ii) such assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to the financial condition of any Obligor or the performance or observance by any Obligor of any of its obligations under this Agreement or any other Loan Document furnished pursuant hereto; (iii) such Assignee confirms that it has received a copy of this Agreement, together with such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into such Assignment and Acceptance; (iv) such Assignee will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent, such assigning Lender or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement; (v) such Assignee appoints and authorizes the Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement as are delegated to the Agent by the terms hereof, together with such powers, including the discretionary rights and incidental power, as are reasonably incidental thereto;

The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, in the absence of manifest error, and the Borrowers, the Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as the owner of the Term Loan and any Term Notes evidencing such Term Loan recorded therein for all purposes of this Agreement. Any assignment of any Term Loan, whether or not evidenced by a Term Note, shall be effective only upon appropriate entries with respect thereto being made in the Register. Any assignment of all or part of a Term Loan evidenced by a Term Note shall be registered on the Register only upon surrender for registration of assignment of the Term Note evidencing such Term Loan, accompanied by a duly executed Assignment and Acceptance; thereupon one or more new Term Notes in the same aggregate principal amount shall be issued to the assigning Lender and/or the designated Eligible Assignee (as applicable), and the old Term Notes shall be returned by the Agent to the Borrowers marked \"canceled.\" The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrowers or any Lender (with respect to any entry relating to such Lender's Term Loan) at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. The Register shall be treated, solely for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 5f. 103-1(c) (which relates to whether an obligation is in registered form for purposes of claiming exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code with respect to payments of \"portfolio interest\" received by a Non-U.S. Lender), as being maintained by the Agent as agent for the Borrowers; provided that the Agent shall have no duty or obligation whatsoever to or for the benefit of the Borrowers in connection with such matter.</p>\n<p>(e) Immediately upon satisfaction of the requirements of Section 13.3(a) and Section 13.3(d), this Agreement shall be deemed to be amended to the extent, but only to the extent, necessary to reflect the addition of the Assignee and the resulting adjustment of the Commitments arising therefrom. The Commitment allocated to each Assignee shall reduce such Commitments of the assigning Lender pro tanto.</p>\n<p>(f) Any Lender may at any time sell to one or more commercial banks, financial institutions, or other Persons (a \"Participant\") participating interests in any Term Loan, the Commitment of that Lender, and the other interests of that Lender (the \"originating Lender\") hereunder and under the other Loan Documents; provided that (i) the originating Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged (including the obligations pursuant to Schedule 3.1-A and Schedule 3.1-B), (ii) the originating Lender shall remain solely responsible for the performance of such obligations, (iii) the Obligors and the Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with the originating Lender in connection with the originating Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, (iv) no Lender shall transfer or grant any participating interest under which the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*240</span> Participant has rights to approve any amendment to, or any consent or waiver with respect to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (v) all amounts payable by the Obligors hereunder shall be determined as if such Lender had not sold such participation, and (vi) at any time on or prior to the Maturity Date, no Disqualified Lender may, without the Borrowers' prior written consent, be a Participant unless the maturity of the Term Loan has been accelerated; except that, if amounts outstanding under this Agreement shall have been declared or shall have become due and payable upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, each Participant shall be deemed to have the right of set-off in respect of its participating interest in amounts owing under this Agreement to the same extent and subject to the same limitation as if the amount of its participating interest were owing directly to it as a Lender under this Agreement.</p>\n<p>(g) In the event that any Lender sells participations in a Term Loan, such Lender shall, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrowers, maintain, or cause to be maintained, a register, on which it enters the name of all Participants in the Term Loan held by it and the principal amount (and stated interest thereon) of the portion of the Term Loan that is the subject of the participation (the \"Participant Register\"). A Term Loan (and the note, if any, evidencing the same) may be participated in whole or in part only by registration of such participation on the Participant Register. Any participation of such Term Loan (and the note, if any, evidencing the same) may be effected only by the registration of such participation on the Participant Register. The Participant Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrowers and any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. The Participant Register shall be treated, solely for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 5f.103-1(c) (which relates to whether an obligation is in registered form for purposes of claiming exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code with respect to payments of \"portfolio interest\" received by a Non-U.S. Lender), as being maintained by the applicable Lender as agent for the Borrowers; provided that such Lender shall have no duty or obligation whatsoever to or for the benefit of the Borrowers in connection with such matter.</p>\n<p>(h) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, any Lender may at any time create a security interest in, or pledge, all or any portion of its rights under and interest in this Agreement in favor of any Federal Reserve Bank, in accordance with Regulation A of the Federal Reserve Board or U.S. Treasury Regulation 31 CFR §203.14, or any Federal Home Loan Bank, and such Federal Reserve Bank and/or Federal Home Loan Bank may enforce such pledge or security interest in any manner permitted under applicable law.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>ARTICLE 14</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>THE AGENT</h2>\n<p>Section 14.1 Appointment and Authorization. Each Lender hereby designates and appoints the Agent as its agent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and each Lender hereby irrevocably authorizes the Agent to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and each other Loan Document and to exercise such powers and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*241</span> perform such duties as are expressly delegated to it by the terms of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The Agent agrees to act as such on the express conditions contained in this Article 14. The provisions of this Article 14 are solely for the benefit of the Agent and the Lenders and no Obligor shall have rights as a third party beneficiary of any of the provisions contained herein other than with respect to Section 14.9, Section 14.10 and Section 14.11. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained elsewhere in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document, the Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, nor shall the Agent have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Lender, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations, or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist against the Agent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, the use of the term \"agent\" in this Agreement with reference to the Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law. Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between independent contracting parties. Except as expressly otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Agent shall have and may use its sole discretion with respect to exercising or refraining from exercising any discretionary rights or taking or refraining from taking any actions which the Agent is expressly entitled to take or assert under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, including the exercise of rights and remedies pursuant to Section 11.2, and any action so taken or not taken shall be deemed consented to by the Lenders.</p>\n<p>Section 14.2 Delegation of Duties. The Agent may execute any of its duties under this Agreement or any other Loan Document by or through agents, sub-agents, employees, or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. The Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agent, sub-agent, employee, or attorney-in-fact that it selects as long as such selection was made without gross negligence or willful misconduct.</p>\n<p>Section 14.3 Liability of the Agent. None of the Agent-Related Persons shall (a) be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by any of them under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the transactions contemplated hereby (except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct), or (b) be responsible in any manner to any of the Lenders for any recital, statement, representation, or warranty made by any Obligor or any Affiliate of any Obligor, or any officer thereof, contained in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document, or in any certificate, report, statement, or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by the Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or the validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability, or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or for any failure of any Obligor to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder. No Agent-Related Person shall be under any obligation to any Lender to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or to inspect the properties, books, or records of any Obligor or any Affiliate of any Obligor. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*242</span> Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no Agent-Related Person: (i) shall have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Majority Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents); <i>provided</i> that such Agent-Related Person shall not be required to take any action that, in its judgment or the judgment of its counsel, may expose such Person to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable Requirements of Law; and (ii) shall, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to Borrowers or any of their Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the person serving as Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Section 14.4 Reliance by the Agent.</h2>\n<p>(a) The Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram, facsimile, telex, or telephone message, statement, or other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent, or made by the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including, without limitation, counsel to the Obligors), independent accountants, and other experts selected by the Agent. The Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Majority Lenders as it deems appropriate and, if it so requests, it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement or any other Loan Document in accordance with a request or consent of the Majority Lenders (or all Lenders if so required by the terms of this Agreement) and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all of the Lenders.</p>\n<p>(b) For purposes of determining compliance with the conditions specified in Section 10.1, each Lender that has executed this Agreement shall be deemed to have consented to, approved, or accepted or to be satisfied with, each document or other matter either sent by the Agent to such Lender for consent, approval, acceptance, or satisfaction, or required thereunder to be consented to or approved by or acceptable or satisfactory to such Lender.</p>\n<p>Section 14.5 Notice of Default. The Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, unless the Agent shall have received written notice from a Lender or an Obligor referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a \"notice of default.\" The Agent will notify the Lenders of its receipt of any such notice. The Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as may be requested by the Majority Lenders in accordance with Article 11; provided that unless and until the Agent has received any such <span class=\"star-pagination\">*243</span> request, the Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable.</p>\n<p>Section 14.6 Credit Decision. Each Lender acknowledges that none of the Agent-Related Persons has made any representation or warranty to it, and that no act by the Agent hereinafter taken, including any review of the affairs of the Obligors and their Affiliates, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by any Agent-Related Person to any Lender. Each Lender represents to the Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition, and creditworthiness of the Obligors and their Affiliates, and all applicable bank regulatory laws relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, and made its own decision to enter into this Agreement and to extend credit to the Obligors. Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals, and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make such investigations as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition, and creditworthiness of the Obligors. Except for notices, reports, and other documents expressly herein required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Agent, the Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition, or creditworthiness of the Obligors which may come into the possession of any of the Agent-Related Persons.</p>\n<p>Section 14.7 Indemnification. WHETHER OR NOT THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY ARE CONSUMMATED, THE LENDERS SHALL INDEMNIFY UPON DEMAND THE AGENT-RELATED PERSONS (TO THE EXTENT NOT REIMBURSED BY OR ON BEHALF OF THE OBLIGORS AND WITHOUT LIMITING THE OBLIGATION OF THE OBLIGORS TO DO SO), PRO RATA, FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL INDEMNIFIED LIABILITIES AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED IN SECTION 15.10; PROVIDED THAT NO LENDER SHALL BE LIABLE FOR THE PAYMENT TO THE AGENT-RELATED PERSONS OF ANY PORTION OF SUCH INDEMNIFIED LIABILITIES RESULTING SOLELY FROM SUCH PERSON'S GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT WITHOUT LIMITATION OF THE FOREGOING, EACH LENDER SHALL REIMBURSE THE AGENT UPON DEMAND FOR ITS RATABLE SHARE OF ANY COSTS OR OUT-OF-POCKET EXPENSES (INCLUDING COSTS AND EXPENSES SET FORTH IN SECTION 15.6) INCURRED BY THE AGENT IN CONNECTION WITH THE PREPARATION, EXECUTION, DELIVERY, ADMINISTRATION, MODIFICATION, AMENDMENT, OR ENFORCEMENT (WHETHER THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS, LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, OR OTHERWISE) OF, OR LEGAL ADVICE IN RESPECT OF RIGHTS OR RESPONSIBILITIES UNDER, THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT, OR ANY DOCUMENT CONTEMPLATED BY OR REFERRED TO HEREIN, TO THE EXTENT THAT THE AGENT IS NOT REIMBURSED FOR SUCH EXPENSES BY OR ON BEHALF OF THE OBLIGORS THE UNDERTAKING IN THIS SECTION SHALL SURVIVE THE <span class=\"star-pagination\">*244</span> PAYMENT OF ALL OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER AND THE RESIGNATION OR REPLACEMENT OF THE AGENT.</p>\n<p>Section 14.8 The Agent in Individual Capacity. The Agent and its Affiliates may make loans to, issue letters of credit for the account of, accept deposits from, acquire equity interests in and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust, financial advisory, underwriting, or other business with the Obligors and their Affiliates as though it were not the Agent hereunder and without notice to or consent of the Lenders. The Lenders acknowledge that, pursuant to such activities, the Agent or its Affiliates may receive information regarding the Obligors or their Affiliates (including information that may be subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of the Obligors or such Affiliates) and acknowledge that the Agent shall be under no obligation to provide such information to them. With respect to its Term Loan, the Agent as a Lender shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Agent, and the terms \"Lender\" and \"Lenders\" include the Agent in its individual capacity as a Lender hereunder.</p>\n<p>Section 14.9 Successor Agent. The Agent may resign as the Agent upon 30 days notice to the Lenders and the Borrowers, such resignation to be effective, subject to the next succeeding paragraph of this Section 14.9, upon the acceptance of a successor agent to its appointment as Agent. If the Agent resigns under this Agreement, the Majority Lenders shall, with the consent of the General Partner if the Term Loan has not been accelerated (which consent may be withheld in it's sole and absolute discretion), appoint from among the Lenders a successor agent for the Lenders. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as successor agent hereunder, such successor agent shall succeed to all the rights, powers, and duties of the retiring Agent and the term \"Agent\" shall mean such successor agent and the retiring Agent's appointment, powers, and duties as the Agent shall be terminated. After any retiring Agent's resignation hereunder as Agent, the provisions of this Section 14.9 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was the Agent under this Agreement.</p>\n<p>If no such successor Agent shall have been so appointed by the Majority Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Agent may on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above provided that if the Agent shall notify Borrower and the Lenders that no qualifying Person has accepted such appointment, then such resignation shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice and (1) the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (except that in the case of any Collateral held by the Agent on behalf of the Lenders under any of the Loan Documents, the retiring Agent shall continue to hold such Collateral as nominee until such time as a successor Agent is appointed) and (2) all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through an Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender directly, until such time as the Majority Lenders appoint a successor Agent as provided for above in this Section 14.9.</p>\n<p>After the retiring Agent's resignation hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article 14 and Section 15.10 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such <span class=\"star-pagination\">*245</span> retiring Agent and its sub-agents in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring Agent was acting as Agent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Section 14.10 Withholding Tax</h2>\n<p>(a) Each of the Lenders and the Agent shall provide in favor of the Obligors and the Agent the following forms:</p>\n<blockquote>(i) Each Non-U.S. Lender shall deliver to the Borrowers and the Agent either (i) two copies of either U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN (claiming exemption from, or a reduction of, U.S. withholding tax under an income tax treaty), Form W-8ECI (claiming exemption from U.S. withholding tax because the income is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business) or Form W-8IMY including any required statements and Forms W-8BEN and W-8ECI, or any subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto, as applicable, or (ii) in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender entitled to an exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code with respect to payments of \"portfolio interest,\" two copies of Form W-8BEN (certifying that such Non-U.S. Lender is a beneficial owner of the Term Loan), Form W-8IMY including any required statements and Forms W-8BEN and W-8ECI or any subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto, and a certificate satisfactory to the Agent and the General Partner that such Non-U.S. Lender Party is not (1) a \"bank\" within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (2) a \"10 percent shareholder\" of the General Partner within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code or (3) a \"controlled foreign corporation\" described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code.

Such forms shall be delivered by each Non-U.S. Lender prior to the date of the first payment by the Borrower hereunder made to such Non-U.S. Lender and on or before the date, if any, that such Non-U.S. Lender designates a New Lending Office. In addition, each Non-U.S. Lender shall deliver such forms promptly upon the obsolescence or invalidity of any form previously delivered by such Non-U.S. Lender or as reasonably requested from time to time by the General Partner or the Agent. Each Non-U.S. Lender shall promptly notify the General Partner and the Agent at any time it determines that it is no longer in a position to provide any previously delivered form, statement, or certificate to the Borrowers or the Agent (or any other form, statement, or form of certification adopted by the IRS for such purpose). Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph, a Non-U.S. Lender shall not be required to deliver any form pursuant to this paragraph that such Non-U.S. Lender is not legally able to deliver.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(ii) Each U.S. Lender shall deliver to the Borrowers and the Agent two copies of U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-9, or any subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto, properly completed and duly executed by such U.S. Lender certifying that such U.S. Lender is entitled to an exemption from United States backup withholding tax on all payments by the Borrowers under this Agreement and the other <span class=\"star-pagination\">*246</span> Loan Documents. Such forms shall be delivered by each U.S. Lender on or before the date it becomes a party to this Agreement.

The Lenders hereby irrevocably authorize the Agent, at the request of the General Partner, to subordinate any Agent's Lien to the holder of any Lien described in clauses (b), (d), (f), (j) (if and to the extent applicable), (m), (o), (p), (s), (t), and (v) of the definition of Permitted Liens; in each case to the extent the underlying transaction is not prohibited hereby.</p>\n<p>(b) Upon receipt by the Agent of any authorization required pursuant to Section 14.11(a) to release any Agent's Liens upon particular types or items of Collateral, and upon at least two Business Days prior written request (or such shorter time period as the Agent may agree) by the General Partner, the Agent shall (and is hereby irrevocably authorized by the Lenders to) execute such documents as may be necessary to evidence the release of the Agent's Liens upon such Collateral; provided that (i) the Agent shall not be required to execute any such document on terms which, in the Agent's good-faith opinion, would expose the Agent to liability or create any material obligation or entail any material adverse consequence other than the release of such Liens without recourse or warranty, and (ii) such release shall not in any manner discharge, affect, or impair the Obligations or any Liens (other than those expressly being released) upon (or obligations of the Obligors in respect of) all interests retained by any Obligor, including the proceeds of any sale, all of which shall continue to constitute part of the Collateral.</p>\n<p>(c) The Agent shall have no obligation whatsoever to any of the Lenders to assure that the Collateral exists or is owned by any Obligor or is cared for, protected, or insured or has been encumbered, or that the Agent's Liens have been properly or sufficiently or lawfully created, perfected, protected, or enforced or are entitled to any particular priority, or to exercise at all or in any particular manner or under any duty of care, disclosure, or fidelity, or to continue exercising, any of the rights, authorities, and powers granted or available to the Agent pursuant to any of the Loan Documents, it being understood and agreed that in respect of the Collateral, or any act, omission, or event related thereto, the Agent may act in any manner it may deem appropriate, in its sole discretion given the Agent's own interest in the Collateral in its capacity as one of the Lenders and that the Agent shall have no other duty or liability whatsoever to any Lender as to any of the foregoing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Section 14.12 Restrictions on Actions by the Lenders; Sharing of Payments.</h2>\n<p>(a) Each Lender hereby waives any and all rights to set-off against the Obligations, any amounts owing by such Lender to any Obligor or any accounts unrelated to the Term Loan of any Obligor now or hereafter maintained with such Lender.

The General Partner (on its own behalf and on behalf of the other Borrower) shall have the right by delivering written notice to the Lenders no later than the earlier of (x) the date that is 45 days prior to the Maturity Date, (y) the time of the approval by the Bankruptcy Court of a disclosure statement for the POR and (z) the date an order is entered approving a Qualified Backstop Party in connection with a potential Qualified Rights Offering, to elect (which election shall be irrevocable unless (i) otherwise consented to by all Lenders or (ii) the POR with respect to which such election applies is not approved by the Bankruptcy Court) to pay on the Plan Date (a) all or a portion of the sum of (i) the outstanding principal amount of the Term Loan, (ii) accrued and unpaid interest due and owing on the Plan Date and (iii) the Exit Fee then due and payable by issuing to the Lenders the Conversion Shares; <i>provided, however,</i> that in no event shall such conversion result in the Lenders' receipt in the aggregate of Common Stock in connection herewith equaling more than (A) 8.0% (on a Fully-Distributed Basis) of the aggregate amount of Common Stock distributed in connection with the POR or (B) 9.9% of the aggregate amount of Common Stock actually distributed in connection with the POR on the Plan Date (without giving effect to any Common Stock the distribution of which is subject to any contingency, holdback or other similar arrangement) (herein, the <i>\"Maximum Conversion Shares\");</i> and/or (b) all or a portion of the outstanding principal amount of the Term Loan by issuing to the Lenders conversion debt. Notwithstanding the prior language, the General Partner shall have the right to withdraw its conversion election made in accordance with (z) above, or if (y) and (z) occur substantially concurrently, (y) and (z), and such election shall be of no further force and effect, if the General Partner determines that the rights offering contemplated by clause (z) in the first sentence is not, or is unlikely to be, a Qualified Rights Offering.</p>\n<p>2. The right of the General Partner to make the election and effect the conversion described in <i>paragraph 1</i> above is subject to all of the following conditions precedent having been satisfied on the Plan Date (except if and to the extent that any such condition has been expressly waived in writing by the Majority Lenders):</p>\n<p>a. There is no continuing Event of Default;</p>\n<p>b. In the case of conversion of any portion of the Term Loan to Conversion Shares, and only in such case, the Common Stock is, or all necessary and appropriate actions have been taken, including receipt of approval for listing, such that the Common Stock will be, within five Business Days after the Plan Date, quoted on the New York Stock Exchange or The NASDAQ Global Market;</p>\n<p>c. The Plan Date occurs within 24 months of the date hereof;</p>\n<p>d. The General Partner and its direct and indirect consolidated subsidiaries (<i>\"Consolidated GGP\"</i>) shall not have divested assets (after giving effect to transactions contemplated to be made in the POR, and including foreclosures after the commencement of the Case) that generated more than 20% of the net operating <span class=\"star-pagination\">*272</span> income of Consolidated GGP in its fiscal year 2008;</p>\n<p>e. The Exit Fee then due and payable shall have been paid in full at or prior to the time of such conversion; and</p>\n<p>f. In the case of conversion of all or any portion of the Term Loan to conversion debt, and only in such case, conversion debt shall have the following terms: (i) principal amount shall be less than or equal to six times the last twelve months net operating income of real property on which the Lenders have a first lien (<i>\"First Lien Properties\"</i>), provided that no tenant shall represent greater than 10% of the aggregate rent of the First Lien Properties in the last twelve months; (ii) collateral shall be comprised of the first mortgage liens on the First Lien Properties and related personal property, Borrowers' wholly-owned land and a lien on the Borrowers' cash collateral account; (iii) interest rate and other economic terms shall be the same as the Term Loan, provided that the Borrowers shall not be required to pay an origination, commitment, extension, exit or other comparable or substitute fee, or any prepayment premium, penalty or fee; (iv) non-economic terms of the conversion debt shall be substantially similar to the terms of the Term Loan provided that the bankruptcy concepts shall be generally removed and, in the case of the Subsidiaries owning the First Lien Properties, there shall be no or minimal baskets for indebtedness, liens and asset sales; (v) the General Partner and Lenders shall negotiate loan conversion documents in good faith; and (vi) Borrowers' direct parent and subsidiaries shall provide guarantees reasonably satisfactory to the Lenders that carve out all of the Negative Pledge Debtors, provided that such Persons grant no guarantees to other creditors.</p>\n<p>3. If and to the extent there is a Value Differential, the General Partner shall be obligated to pay an amount in cash and/or Common Stock (<i>\"Value Differential Shares\"</i>), at the General Partner's election, ratably to the Lenders, equal to such Value Differential. The General Partner shall make its election as to the form of consideration in which it intends to pay the Value Differential, if any, and publicly announce the same by filing (or furnishing) a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission, no later than the open of trading on the third Trading Day preceding the Value Differential Valuation Period (indicating its election and the percentages, if any, of the Value Differential to be paid in cash and through the issuance of Value Differential Shares). That portion of the Value Differential, if any, payable in cash shall be paid not later than 30 calendar days following the Trading Valuation Date. The number of Value Differential Shares issuable in respect of that portion of the Value Differential, if any, payable in Value Differential Shares shall be determined on the seventh Trading Day following the Trading Valuation Date, subsequent to market close on such date, and such Value Differential Shares shall be issued no later than 10:00 AM Eastern Time on the tenth Trading Day following the Trading Valuation Date. The number of Value Differential Shares issuable shall be determined by dividing (x) the dollar amount of the Value Differential payable in Value Differential Shares by (y) the product of (i) 97.0% multiplied by (ii) the average of each Trading Day's volume-weighted average price with respect to trading of the Common Stock during normal trading hours (9:30 AM to 4:00 PM Eastern Time) for the period beginning on the first Trading Day following the Trading Valuation Date and ending on the seventh <span class=\"star-pagination\">*273</span> Trading Day following the Trading Valuation Date. If payment of the Value Differential is not made in full when due, any amount not paid on such date shall be overdue and shall bear interest at the Default Rate from such payment date to the date payment is made (it being understood that the foregoing shall not in any way be construed as a limitation on any legal remedies to which the Lenders may be entitled as a result of any failure by the General Partner to pay the Value Differential when due). No Value Differential Shares shall be issuable to any Lender, and no Lender shall have any right to receive Value Differential Shares, to the extent that the issuance or potential issuance thereof would result in such Lender beneficially owning (within the meaning of Section 13(d) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) more than 9.9% of the Common Stock; provided, however, that no Lender shall be deemed to beneficially own more than 9.9% of the Common Stock due to a group, trust, account, agreement, or other arrangement, implicit or explicit, with any other Lender solely as a result of any relationship created by this <i>Schedule 3.1-A</i> unless such Lenders reasonably conclude, based on advice of counsel, that such Lenders are or would be a group (within the meaning of Section 13(d) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) with respect to the Common Stock and that such Lenders could, depending on the number of Value Differential Shares issuable, be required to disclose on a Schedule 13D that each such Lender beneficially owns more than 9.9% of the Common Stock as a result of receiving Value Differential Shares. To the extent any Lender is precluded from receiving Value Differential Shares to which it would be entitled but for the restriction set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, such Lender shall be entitled to receive cash in lieu of any Value Differential Shares that would otherwise have been issuable but for such restriction. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no payment shall be made in respect of a Value Differential if a Qualified Rights Offering has been made. If there is no Qualified Rights Offering, then no Lender shall, during the Value Differential Valuation Period, sell, assign or dispose of Common Stock or Common Stock derivatives in an amount greater than 10.0% of such Lender's Conversion Shares on any one Trading Day.</p>\n<p>4. The General Partner shall take all necessary and appropriate measures to cause the Conversion Shares and any Value Differential Shares to be freely tradable, upon issuance to the Lenders, without registration (<i>e.g.,</i> pursuant to Section 1145 of the Bankruptcy Code). If and to the extent the Majority Lenders determine in good faith that Conversion Shares and/or any Value Differential Shares will or may not be freely tradable, upon issuance to the Lenders, without registration, the General Partner covenants and agrees that following written notification by the Majority Lenders to the General Partner of such determination no later than 30 Business Days after the Plan Date (such date, the <i>\"Request Date\"</i>), the General Partner shall, at its expense, prepare and file with the Securities and Exchange Commission a registration statement on Form S-3, if available (or, if not available, on Form S-1 or another appropriate form), covering the shares of Common Stock of the Lenders received by such Lenders as a result of the conversion described in <i>paragraph 1(a)</i> hereof and any Value Differential Shares that may be issuable in satisfaction of the Value Differential (collectively, the <i>\"Registrable Shares\"</i>), and, to the extent the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*274</span> registration statement has not theretofore been declared effective or is not automatically effective upon such filing, the General Partner shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to be declared or become effective as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than 180 days after the Request Date, and will use commercially reasonable efforts to keep such registration statement effective and usable for the resale of such Registrable Shares from the date of its initial effectiveness until such time as all Registrable Shares have been sold pursuant to the registration statement or all remaining Registrable Shares may otherwise be freely resold under the Securities Act without limitation or restriction. The registration contemplated by this <i>paragraph 4</i> shall be effected only once. The registration rights contemplated by this <i>paragraph 4</i> shall be effected pursuant to the terms of <i>Schedule 3.1-B.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Defined Terms:</i></h2>\n<p><i>\"Common Stock\"</i> means the common stock of the General Partner.</p>\n<p><i>\"Common Stock Equivalent\"</i> means any security or instrument that (i) directly or indirectly is convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock, (ii) by its terms is expressly linked to the price or performance of the Common Stock or (iii) by its terms expressly participates in dividends or distributions in respect of, or votes as a class with, the Common Stock; <i>provided, however,</i> that \"Common Stock Equivalent\" excludes (a) any security or instrument issued in the ordinary course of business pursuant to board approved employee benefits plans of the General Partner (an <i>\"Employee Benefits Plan\"</i>) or any other option, warrant or other security or instrument issued or issuable in the ordinary course of business to employees, officers or directors of the General Partner pursuant to a General Partner board-approved incentive, retention, benefit or similar compensation plan and (b) any rights issued pursuant to the General Partner's shareholder rights plan (provided such rights have not separated from the Common Stock and no triggering event under the rights plan has occurred).</p>\n<p><i>\"Conversion Amount\"</i> means the sum of (i) the outstanding principal of the Term Loan, (ii) accrued and unpaid interest due and owing on the Plan Date and (iii) the Exit Fee then due and payable that is repaid by the issuance of shares of Common Stock on the Maturity Date in accordance with this <i>Schedule 3.1-A.</i></p>\n<p><i>\"Conversion Shares\"</i> means that number of shares of Common Stock determined by dividing the Conversion Amount, stated in U.S. dollars, by the lowest of (i) the value of one share of Common Stock based on the value attributable to one such share in the POR, (ii) the lowest net price per share received from any other purchaser of Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents in connection with the POR (other than as a result of settling Claims, and provided that any reinstatement or reaffirmation of any Common Stock or Common Stock equivalents of the General Partner in conjunction with the POR shall be treated as an issuance at the lesser of the POR or market value), whether by public offering, private placement, or pursuant to a rights offering to the pre-petition stakeholders of the General Partner in connection with the POR, and (iii) the lowest net price per share received by the General Partner from any issuance of Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents to any unaffiliated third party for cash or in exchange for assets in connection with the POR (other than Claims) <span class=\"star-pagination\">*275</span> (such lowest price, which may be the Qualified Rights Offering Price Per Share, the <i>\"Initial Conversion Price\"</i>). Any fractional share resulting from such calculation shall be paid in cash. For purposes of this definition and for purposes of the second sentence of the definition of \"Value Differential\" below, \"per share\" when used with respect to the issuance of any Common Stock Equivalents shall mean the price per share of Common Stock implied by such Common Stock Equivalent determined using a customary methodology agreed between the Majority Lenders and the General Partner; <i>provided</i> that, in the event that the Majority Lenders and the General Partner are unable to agree on such a methodology, each of the Majority Lenders and the General Partner shall select an independent valuation expert, and such independent valuation experts shall in turn jointly select a third independent valuation expert, who shall determine an appropriate valuation methodology and apply such methodology to determine the price per share.</p>\n<p><i>\"Fully-Distributed Basis\"</i> means, with respect to any class of Common Stock of the kind or class having power generally to vote in the election of directors, the Common Stock that would be distributed after giving effect to the distribution of all Plan Distributable Securities.</p>\n<p><i>\"Plan Distributable Securities\"</i> means all Common Stock and all Common Stock Equivalents (including any Common Stock and Common Stock Equivalents of the General Partner that are reinstated or reaffirmed in conjunction with the POR) which will be exercised or exchanged or otherwise converted to Common Stock prior to or concurrently with distribution of such security under the POR with respect to which an entitlement to distribution exists under the POR (whether or not such entitlement is subject to contingency, holdback or other similar arrangement).</p>\n<p><i>\"POR\"</i> means the plan of reorganization with respect to the Debtors as confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court.</p>\n<p><i>\"Qualified Backstop Party\"</i> means an independent third party that (i) is not an Affiliate of the General Partner, and (ii) does not beneficially own more than 15% of the voting stock including voting stock derivatives (including any swap or short sale) of the General Partner.</p>\n<p><i>\"Qualified Rights Offering\"</i> means a rights offering to pre-petition stakeholders of the General Partner and/or its Affiliates in connection with the POR that meets the following qualifications: (i) subscribed to be sold to at least 50 ultimate purchasers who are not affiliated with each other (or 25 ultimate purchasers who are not affiliated with each other if such rights offering is made solely to creditors of the General Partner debtors in their capacity as such); (ii) the offered shares shall be listed on the New York Stock Exchange or The NASDAQ Global Market within five Trading Days of completion of the rights offering; (iii) the issue size is at least three times the Conversion Amount; (iv) the rights offering is conducted by a nationally known financial advisor at a price representing a discount to POR reorganization value designed to achieve a fully subscribed offering at such price as may be determined by such nationally known financial advisor and a nationally known financial advisor selected by the Agent (acting at the direction of the Majority Lenders) (and, if such financial advisors are unable so to agree, such financial advisors shall select another nationally recognized financial advisor, which third financial advisor shall determine the amount of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*276</span> discount); and (v) if and to the extent applicable, the offered shares are priced with reference to the trading market for the Common Stock prior to the commencement of the rights offering. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Qualified Backstop Party agrees to a contractual backstop of at least 40% of the rights being offered in such rights offering meeting the criteria of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of this definition, such rights offering shall be deemed to be a Qualified Rights Offering for all purposes except that the Qualified Rights Offering Price Per Share in such case shall be deemed to be equal to the lowest price per share (which shall be calculated net of any fees and other payments made to such third party in connection with the backstop arrangements) of Common Stock obtained by the General Partner and/or its Affiliates in such Qualified Rights Offering from any Qualified Backstop Party or any other purchaser in such rights offering.</p>\n<p><i>\"Qualified Rights Offering Price Per Share\"</i> means the lower of (i) the lowest price per share (which shall be calculated net of any fees and other payments made to such third party in connection with the backstop arrangements) of Common Stock obtained by the General Partner and/or its Affiliates in a Qualified Rights Offering from any Qualified Backstop Party or any other purchaser in such rights offering and (ii) the POR reorganization value per share.</p>\n<p><i>\"Trading Day\"</i> means a trading day consisting of a full trading session with respect to which the Common Stock is registered under the Exchange Act and traded on the New York Stock Exchange or The NASDAQ Stock Market.</p>\n<p><i>\"Trading Valuation Date\"</i> means the fortieth Trading Day following confirmation of the POR.</p>\n<p><i>\"Value Differential\"</i> means the amount derived (if a positive number) by subtracting (i) the product of (A) the number of shares of Common Stock issued as Conversion Shares multiplied by (B) the lesser of (x) the average of each Trading Day's volume-weighted average price with respect to trading of the Common Stock during normal trading hours (9:30 AM to 4:00 PM Eastern Time) for the period (the <i>\"Value Differential Valuation Period\"</i>) beginning on the twentieth Trading Day following confirmation of the POR and ending on the fortieth Trading Day following confirmation of the POR and (y) the Subsequent Issuance Price (if any) (as defined below), from (ii) the product of (A) the number of shares of Common Stock issued as Conversion Shares multiplied by (B) the Initial Conversion Price.

To the extent the Registration Statement has not theretofore been declared effective or is not automatically effective upon such filing, the General Partner shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Registration Statement to be declared or become effective as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than 180 days after the Reg Rights Start Date, and the General Partner shall use commercially reasonable efforts to keep such Registration Statement effective and usable for the resale of such Registrable Securities from the date of its initial effectiveness until such time as all Registrable Securities have been sold pursuant to the Registration Statement or all remaining Registrable Securities may otherwise be freely resold under the Securities Act without limitation or restriction.</p>\n<p>(c) Any registration pursuant to this <i>Section 2.1</i> shall, to the extent possible, be effected by means of a shelf registration under the Securities Act (a <i>\"Shelf Registration Statement\"</i>) in accordance with the methods and distribution set forth in the Shelf Registration Statement and Rule 415.

If the General Partner notifies the Holders in accordance with <i>Section 2.3(f)(v)</i> to suspend the use of the Prospectus until the requisite changes to the Prospectus have been made, then the Holders and any underwriters shall suspend use of such Prospectus.</p>\n<p>(i) Use commercially reasonable efforts to procure the cooperation of the General Partner's transfer agent in settling any offering or sale of Registrable Securities, including with respect to the transfer of physical security instruments into book-entry form in accordance with any procedures reasonably requested by the Holders or any managing underwriter(s).</p>\n<p>(j) Use its commercially reasonable efforts to take such actions as are under its control to become or remain a well-known seasoned issuer (as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act) (and not become an ineligible issuer (as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act)) during the period when such Registration Statement remains in effect.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*282</span> (k) Enter into an underwriting agreement in form, scope and substance as is customarily entered into for similar underwritten offerings of equity securities by similar companies and take all such other actions reasonably requested by the Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities being sold in connection therewith or by the managing underwriter(s), if any, to expedite or facilitate the underwritten disposition of such Registrable Securities, and in connection therewith as customary for any similar underwritten offering, (i) make such representations and warranties to the Holders that are selling stockholders and the managing underwriter(s), if any, with respect to the business of the General Partner and its subsidiaries, and the Registration Statement, Prospectus and documents, if any, incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference therein, in each case, in form, substance and scope as are customarily made by the issuer in similar underwritten offerings of equity securities by similar companies, and, if true, confirm the same if and when requested, (ii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to furnish underwriters opinions of counsel to the General Partner, addressed to the managing underwriter(s), if any, covering the matters customarily covered in the opinions requested in similar underwritten offerings of equity securities by similar companies, (iii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain \"cold comfort\" letters from the independent certified public accountants of the General Partner (and, if necessary, any other independent certified public accountants of any business acquired by the General Partner for which financial statements and financial data are included in the Registration Statement) who have certified the financial statements included in such Registration Statement, addressed to each of the managing underwriter(s), if any, such letters to be in customary form and covering matters of the type customarily covered in \"cold comfort\" letters in connection with similar underwritten offerings of equity securities by similar companies, (iv) if an underwriting agreement is entered into, the same shall contain indemnification provisions and procedures customary in similar underwritten offerings of equity securities by similar companies, and (v) deliver such documents and certificates as may be reasonably requested by the Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities being sold in connection therewith, their counsel and the managing underwriter(s), if any, to evidence the continued validity of the representations and warranties made pursuant to clause (i) above and to evidence compliance with any customary conditions contained in the underwriting agreement or other agreement entered into by the General Partner.</p>\n<p>(<i>l</i>) Make available for inspection by a representative of Holders, the managing underwriter(s), if any, and any attorneys or accountants retained by such Holders or managing underwriter(s), at the offices where normally kept, during reasonable business hours, financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents and properties of the General Partner, and cause the officers, directors and employees of the General Partner to supply all information in each case reasonably requested by any such representative, managing underwriter(s), attorney or accountant in connection with such Registration Statement;

If it so elects, after receipt of such notice, an indemnifying party, jointly with any other indemnifying parties receiving such notice, may assume the defense of such action with counsel chosen by it (such counsel to be reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified parties), <i>provided</i> that the indemnified party shall be entitled to participate in (but not control) the defense of such action with counsel chosen by it, the fees and expenses of which shall be paid by the indemnifying party if the indemnifying party has reasonably concluded there would be a conflict if one counsel were to represent both the indemnified and the indemnifying party, and by the indemnified party in all other circumstances. In no event shall the indemnifying party or parties be liable for a settlement of an action with respect to which they have assumed the defense if such settlement is effected without the written consent of the indemnifying party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), or for the fees and expenses of more than (i) one counsel for the General Partner, its officer, directors and controlling Persons as a group, (ii) one counsel for the selling Holders and their controlling Persons as a group and (iii) one counsel for the underwriters or agents and their controlling Persons as a group, in each case, in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.</p>\n<p>(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this <i>Section 2.7</i> and <i>Section 2.8,</i> in no event will any (i) Holder be required to undertake liability to any person under <i>Section 2.7</i> or <i>Section 2.8</i> for any amounts in excess of the dollar amount of the proceeds to be received by such Holder from the sale of such Holder's Registrable Securities (after deducting any fees, discounts and commissions applicable thereto) pursuant <span class=\"star-pagination\">*286</span> to any Registration Statement under which such Registrable Securities are to be registered under the Securities Act and (ii) underwriter, selling agent or other securities professional be required to undertake liability to any person hereunder for any amounts in excess of the discount, commission or other compensation payable to such underwriter, selling agent or other securities professional with respect to the Registrable Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public.</p>\n<p>(f) The obligations of the General Partner under this <i>Section 2.7</i> and <i>Section 2.8</i> shall be in addition to any liability which the General Partner may otherwise have to any indemnified person and the obligations of any indemnified person under this <i>Section 2.7</i> and <i>Section 2.8</i> shall be in addition to any liability which such indemnified person may otherwise have to the General Partner. The remedies provided in this <i>Section 2.7</i> and <i>Section 2.8</i> are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to an indemnified party at law or in equity.</p>\n<p>(g) The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.</p>\n<p>2.8 <i>Contribution.</i> (a) If the indemnification provided for in <i>Section 2.7</i> is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under <i>Section 2.7(a)</i> or <i>Section 2.7(b)</i> above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of such indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by such indemnifying party or by such indemnified party, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this <i>Section 2.8</i> were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Holders or any underwriters, selling agents or other securities professionals or all of them were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this <i>Section 2.8(a).</i> The obligations of Holders and any underwriters, selling agents or other securities professionals in this <i>Section 2.8(a)</i> to contribute shall be several in proportion to the percentage of principal amount or number of shares, as applicable, of Registrable Securities registered or underwritten, as the case may be, by them and not joint.</p>\n<p>(b) No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be <span class=\"star-pagination\">*287</span> entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

(<i>\"GGP\"</i>), and their debtor affiliates, as debtors and debtors in possession (the <i>\"Debtors\"</i>)<sup>[1]</sup> for entry of an order authorizing the Debtors to, among other things:</p>\n<p>(i) enter into (a) a Senior Secured Debtor in Possession Credit, Security and Guaranty Agreement (the <i>\"DIP Credit Agreement\"</i>), attached hereto as <i>Exhibit 1</i> (as such agreement may be amended or modified from time to time),<sup>[2]</sup> by and among GGP and GGP Limited Partnership (collectively, the <i>\"Borrowers\"</i>), the guarantors party thereto (collectively, the <i>\"Guarantors\"</i>), and the other lenders from time to time party thereto (collectively, the <i>\"Lenders\"</i>) and UBS, AG, as the Administrative Agent for the Lenders (the <i>\"Agent\"</i>); and (b) all other Loan Documents (together with the DIP Credit Agreement, the <i>\"DIP Loan Documents\"</i>);</p>\n<p>(ii) borrow, pursuant to the DIP Loan Documents, $400,000,000 and seek other financial accommodations from the Lenders pursuant to the DIP Credit Agreement, the other DIP Loan Documents, and this Order;</p>\n<p>(iii) grant non-priming liens, security interests, and mortgages in substantially all of the Obligors' assets (subject to certain exceptions more fully set forth in the DIP Loan Documents and this Order) to secure repayment of the borrowings made under the DIP Loan Documents by, and financial accommodations made to, the Debtors;</p>\n<p>(iv) use the proceeds arising from the DIP Loan Documents in a manner consistent with the terms and conditions of the DIP Loan Documents and this Order;</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*124</span> (v) use \"Cash Collateral\" as such term is defined in section 363(a) of the Bankruptcy Code (the <i>\"Cash Collateral\"</i>);</p>\n<p>(vi) grant, as set forth more fully below, replacement liens and superpriority claims to the Adequate Protection Parties (defined below) to the extent of any diminution in value of such Adequate Protection Parties' respective interests in property of the Debtors or their estates, as adequate protection for the use of Cash Collateral;</p>\n<p>(vii) vacate and modify the automatic stay imposed by section 362 of title 11 of the United States Code (the <i>\"Bankruptcy Code</i>\") to the extent necessary to implement and effectuate the terms and provisions of the DIP Loan Documents and this Order;</p>\n<p>(viii) pay all amounts contemplated to be paid under the DIP Documents (as defined below), including all fees and expenses set forth therein; and</p>\n<p>(ix) waive any applicable stay of the effectiveness of this Order and provide for the immediate effectiveness of this Order.</p>\n<p>The Court having considered the DIP Motion, examined the exhibits attached thereto, and having completed a final hearing (the <i>\"Final Hearing\"</i>) as provided for under section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code, Rule 4001(c) of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure (the <i>\"Bankruptcy Rules\"</i>), and Rule 4001-2 of the Local Bankruptcy Rules for the Southern District of New York (the <i>\"Local Rules\"</i>) and finding the Debtors provided adequate notice to all necessary parties and that no further notice is required:</p>\n<p>BASED UPON THE RECORD ESTABLISHED AT THE FINAL HEARING, THE COURT HEREBY MAKES THE FOLLOWING FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW:</p>\n<p>A. <i>Petition Date.</i> Commencing on April 16, 2009 (the <i>\"Petition Date\"</i>) and continuing thereafter, the Debtors each filed voluntary petitions under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. The Debtors have continued in the management and operation of their business and property as debtors-in-possession pursuant to sections 1107 and 1108 of the Bankruptcy Code. No trustee or examiner has been appointed in the Debtors' chapter 11 cases.</p>\n<p>B. <i>Jurisdiction and Venue.</i> This Court has jurisdiction over these proceedings pursuant to sections 157(b) and 1334 of title 28 of the United States Code and over the persons and property affected hereby. This Court's consideration of the DIP Motion constitutes a core proceeding under section 157(b)(2) of title 28 of the United States Code. Venue for these cases and the proceedings regarding the DIP Motion is proper in this district under sections 1408 and 1409 of title 28 of the United States Code.</p>\n<p>C. <i>Committee Formation.</i> On April 24, 2009 the United States Trustee for the Southern District of New York (the <i>\"United States Trustee\"</i>) appointed an official committee of unsecured creditors in the Case (the <i>\"Creditors' Committee\"</i>).</p>\n<p>D. <i>Notice.</i> The Final Hearing was held in accordance with Bankruptcy Rule 4001 and Local Rule 4001-2. Notice of the Final Hearing and the relief requested in the DIP Motion was provided by the Debtors on April 16, 2009, whether by telecopy, email, overnight courier or hand delivery, to parties in interest, including: (i) the Office of the United States Trustee for the Southern District of New York (Attn: Greg M. Zipes); (ii) the Securities and Exchange Commission; (iii) the Internal Revenue Service; (iv) EuroHypo AG, New York Branch, administrative agent for the lenders to certain of the Debtors under (a) the Second Amended and Restated Credit <span class=\"star-pagination\">*125</span> Agreement dated as of February 24, 2006 and (b) the Loan Agreement, dated as of July 11, 2008, as amended; (v) Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as administrative agent for the lenders to certain of the Debtors under certain Loan Agreements, dated as of January 2, 2008 and February 29, 2008, respectively; (vi) Goldman Sachs Mortgage Company, as administrative agent for the lenders to certain of the Debtors under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of November 3, 2008; (vii) Wilmington Trust FSB, as indenture trustee under (a) that certain Indenture, dated as of May 5, 2006, and (b) that certain Indenture, dated as of April 16, 2007; (viii) LaSalle Bank National Association and Wilmington Trust FSB,<sup>[3]</sup> as indenture trustee under that certain Junior Subordinated Indenture, dated as of February 24, 2006; (ix) The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation, as indenture trustee under that certain Indenture, dated as of February 24, 1995; (x) those creditors holding the 100 largest unsecured claims against the Debtors' estates (on a consolidated basis); (xi) the Property Lenders (as defined in the DIP Motion); (xii) counsel to Pershing Square Capital Management, L.P.; (xiii) counsel to the Agent; and (xiv) counsel to the Creditors' Committee. Such notice of the Final Hearing and the relief requested in the DIP Motion is due and sufficient notice and complies with sections 102(1) and 364(c) of the Bankruptcy Code, Bankruptcy Rules 2002, 4001(c), 4001(d) and the Local Rules.</p>\n<p>E. <i>Need for Postpetition Financing.</i> Entry of this Order is necessary to prevent substantial harm to the Debtors' estates that would otherwise result if the Debtors fail to obtain the financing contemplated herein to preserve the Debtors' assets and continue their operations, and, by the power vested in the Court pursuant to sections 105(a) and 364(c) of the Bankruptcy Code, and is hereby approved. The Debtors will suffer substantial harm unless this Court immediately authorizes the Debtors to obtain loans and other financial accommodations from the Lenders in accordance with the terms of this Order, the DIP Loan Documents, and any other documents, instruments, or agreements related thereto or delivered or executed in connection therewith (the DIP Loan Documents, together with such documents, instruments, and agreements, the <i>\"DIP Documents\"</i>).</p>\n<p>F. <i>No Comparable Credit Available on More Favorable Terms.</i> The Debtors have made reasonable efforts, under the circumstances, to locate financing of the type contemplated by this Order, and the Court expressly finds that the Debtors are unable to obtain, in the ordinary course of business or otherwise, financing of the type contemplated herein on an unsecured basis. Specifically, the Debtors have been unable to obtain unsecured credit allowable under sections 364(a), 364(b), 364(c)(1) and 503(b)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code as an administrative expense. The Debtors are also unable to obtain secured credit, allowable only under Bankruptcy Code sections 364(c)(2) and 364(c)(3), on more favorable terms and conditions than those provided in the DIP Documents and this Order.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*126</span> G. <i>Lenders' Requirements.</i> The Lenders are willing to lend money and provide other financial accommodations to the Debtors only on the terms and conditions and with the protections provided herein and in the DIP Documents and are relying on such terms, conditions, and protections in agreeing to lend money and provide financial accommodations to the Debtors hereunder.</p>\n<p>H. <i>Good Faith.</i> The terms and conditions of the DIP Documents have been negotiated in good faith and at arms' length by all parties involved, the payment of the Goldman Indebtedness (as defined in Paragraph I below) reflects the Debtors' exercise of prudent business judgment, and the Lenders and the Debtors have offered sufficient proof thereof. Accordingly, the Court expressly finds that the terms of the DIP Documents have been extended in good faith and that any credit extended, loans to be made, or other financial accommodations granted to the Debtors pursuant to the DIP Documents shall, in each case, be deemed to be extended in good faith, as that term is used in section 364(e) of the Bankruptcy Code.</p>\n<p>I. <i>Debtors' Acknowledgements and Agreements Regarding the Prepetition Goldman Facility.</i> Prior to the Petition Date, certain of the Debtors, as borrowers or guarantors (the <i>\"Goldman Facility Debtors\"</i>),<sup>[4]</sup> were party to that certain Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of November 3, 2008 (as in effect on the date hereof, the <i>\"Goldman Credit Agreement\"</i>), with Goldman Sachs Mortgage Company, as administrative agent (together, with its successors and assigns, the <i>\"Goldman Facility Agent\"</i>) and the lenders party thereto (the <i>\"Goldman Lenders\"</i>) with all related documents and agreements, as amended or modified, (the <i>\"Prepetition Goldman Facility\"</i>). The Debtors acknowledge and agree that: (i) the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the loans advanced under the Prepetition Goldman Facility is $215,000,000, which, together with accrued and unpaid prepetition contract and default rate interest of $86,597.22, accrued and unpaid postpetition contract and default rate interest of $2,511,319.44, and accrued and unpaid prepetition and postpetition fees, costs and expenses, accrued solely as permitted under Section 9.16 of the Goldman Credit Agreement, and reasonable estimates thereof as set forth in the Payoff Letter (as defined below), amounts to a total indebtedness of $214,950,822.66 (including the credit referenced in (a) below and the postpetition fees and expenses referenced herein) as of May 15, 2009 and, together with any per diem postpetition interest accruing thereafter until payment in full of unpaid principal amount of the loans advanced under the Prepetition Goldman Facility in accordance with this Order (collectively, the <i>\"Goldman Indebtedness\"</i>): (ii) as of the Petition Date and as of the date of this Order, the Goldman Indebtedness is secured by valid, binding, enforceable, and properly perfected liens on and security interests in certain real property and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*127</span> personal property of the Goldman Facility Debtors as described in the Prepetition Goldman Facility (the <i>\"Prepetition Goldman Liens\"</i>) with a salable value the Debtors believe is in excess of the Goldman Indebtedness; (iii) as of the Petition Date and as of the date of this Order, the Goldman Indebtedness constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligations of the respective Goldman Facility Debtors, enforceable in accordance with the terms of the Prepetition Goldman Facility (other than in respect of the stay of enforcement arising from section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code); and (iv) the Goldman Lenders and the Goldman Facility Debtors entered into an agreement, dated as of April 15, 2009 (the <i>\"Incentive Agreement\"</i>), pursuant to which if the Goldman Facility Debtors repay the Goldman Indebtedness in full in cash on or before June 1, 2009, (a) the Goldman Facility Debtors shall be entitled to be paid $3,225,000 which is an amount equal to 1.5% of the unpaid principal amount of the loans outstanding under the Prepetition Goldman Facility and (b) an affiliate of the Goldman Facility Debtors as of the repayment date shall be entitled to a rebate of a fee of $1,075,000 paid in connection with the Incentive Agreement which is an amount equal to 0.5% of the unpaid principal amount of the loans that were outstanding as of April 15, 2009 under the Prepetition Goldman Facility as of the date of the Incentive Agreement.</p>\n<p>J. <i>Section 506(c) and Section 552(b) Waiver.</i> In light of the Lenders' agreement to subordinate their liens and superpriority claims to the Carve-Out, the Lenders are entitled to a waiver of (i) the provisions of section 506(c) of the Bankruptcy Code and (ii) any \"equities of the case\" claims under section 552(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, in each case, in respect of the DIP Documents.</p>\n<p>K. <i>Immediate Entry of the Order.</i> The Debtors have requested that this Order become immediately effective and enforceable upon entry, notwithstanding any provisions that may apply in Bankruptcy Rules 6004(h), 6006(d), 7062, or 9014 or any other Bankruptcy Rule, or Rule 62(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The Debtors have demonstrated good cause for the entry of this Order and for this Order to become immediately effective and enforceable upon entry. Among other things, entry of this Order and the immediate effectiveness and enforceability of this Order upon entry will minimize the disruption of the Debtors' business operations and permit the Debtors to satisfy their operating expenses, will increase the possibilities for confirmation of a successful chapter 11 plan for the Debtors, and is in the best interests of the Debtors, their creditors, and the Debtors' bankruptcy estates. The terms of the borrowings and other financial accommodations authorized hereby are fair and reasonable under the circumstances and reflect the Debtors' exercise of prudent business judgment consistent with their fiduciary duties.</p>\n<p>ACCORDINGLY, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p>1. <i>Motion Granted.</i> The DIP Motion is granted in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this Order and the DIP Documents. Any objections and reservations of rights included therein, to the extent not withdrawn with prejudice, settled, or resolved are hereby overruled on the merits.</p>\n<p>2. <i>Approval of Entry into DIP Documents.</i> The Debtors shall be and hereby are authorized to borrow money and seek other financial accommodations from the Lenders on the terms and conditions contained in this Order and the DIP Documents, and the DIP Documents, including, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*128</span> without limitation, the DIP Credit Agreement, are expressly approved by this Court. To effectuate and evidence the terms and conditions of the borrowings and extensions of credit and other financial accommodations to be made to the Debtors by the Lenders pursuant to the terms of this Order, the Debtors are hereby authorized and directed to enter into the DIP Credit Agreement substantially in the form appended as <i>Exhibit 1</i> hereto and any other DIP Documents that may be entered into in connection with the DIP Credit Agreement, which agreements are hereby expressly approved by this Court.</p>\n<p>3. <i>Enforceable Obligations.</i> Upon execution and delivery of the DIP Credit Agreement and the other DIP Documents, such agreements and documents shall constitute valid and binding obligations of the Obligors, enforceable against the Obligors, their estates and any successors thereto and their creditors in accordance with their terms.</p>\n<p>4. <i>Protection of Lenders and Other Rights.</i> From and after the Petition Date, the Obligors shall use the proceeds of the extensions of credit under the DIP Loan Documents only for the purposes specifically set forth in the DIP Loan Documents and this Order, including to satisfy and discharge in full the Goldman Indebtedness and for general working capital purposes not otherwise restricted by the DIP Credit Agreement. In connection therewith, upon the Closing Date, the Obligors shall direct the Lenders to transfer immediately available funds to the Goldman Facility Agent or any proper assignee or designee thereof an amount necessary to pay in full the unpaid amount of the Goldman Indebtedness, as set forth in the pay-off letter from the Goldman Facility Agent to the Goldman Facility Debtors and GGP, dated May 15, 2009 (the <i>\"Payoff Letter\"</i>). Upon the receipt of the transferred funds by the Goldman Facility Agent: (i) all of the Debtors' obligations under the Prepetition Goldman Facility and any other unpaid amounts under the Goldman Indebtedness shall be considered finally satisfied in full; <i>provided, however,</i> that the indemnities provided in Section 5.18 of the Goldman Credit Agreement that by their express terms survive repayment of the Goldman Indebtedness shall remain in full force and effect for all purposes (the <i>\"Goldman Facility Indemnity\"</i>); (ii) all liens, encumbrances, and any other interests in the Debtors' (or any affiliate's) property held by the Goldman Facility Agent or otherwise arising under the Goldman Prepetition Facility shall be deemed fully released, and the Goldman Lenders and/or the Goldman Facility Agent are hereby directed upon request of the Goldman Facility Debtors or the Lenders to promptly deliver to the Goldman Facility Debtors or the Lenders documents in recordable form as are necessary to evidence the release of such liens, encumbrances, and interests; and (iii) all parties shall be forever barred from attempting to enforce any such lien, encumbrance or other interest in the Debtors' or any affiliate's property that arose under the terms of the Prepetition Goldman Facility; <i>provided, however</i> to the extent the Goldman Lenders and/or the Goldman Facility Agent incur fees and expenses in connection with (A) any inquiry or request by the Debtors, the Creditors' Committee, or any other party in interest, relating to the Prepetition Goldman Facility, the Goldman Indebtedness, the Prepetition Goldman Liens, and/or the prepetition activities of any of the Goldman Lenders and/or Goldman Facility Agent (and/or its and/or their successors or assigns) in connection with the Prepetition Goldman Facility, the Goldman Indebtedness, or the Prepetition Goldman Liens; or (B) defending an Avoidance Action as described in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*129</span> paragraph 5(a) below ((A) and (B) collectively, the <i>\"Avoidance Action Defense\"</i>), the Goldman Lenders and/or the Goldman Facility Agent shall have a first priority lien on the prepetition collateral previously securing the Goldman Indebtedness in an amount not to exceed the lesser of (a) $1,000,000 and (b) the reasonable unpaid fees and expenses incurred by the Goldman Facility Agent in connection with the Avoidance Action Defense (the <i>\"Goldman Facility Indemnity Lien\"</i>). The claims under the Goldman Facility Indemnity in excess of the amount of the Goldman Facility Indemnity Lien shall constitute an administrative expense claim under section 503(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, which administrative expense shall not exceed $1,000,000; <i>provided, however,</i> that such administrative expense shall be subject to the DIP Liens in all respects; <i>provided, further,</i> that nothing herein limits the rights of the Goldman Facility Agent and/or the Goldman Lenders to file unsecured claims with respect to the Goldman Facility Indemnity.</p>\n<p>5. <i>Goldman Refinancing Examination Period.</i></p>\n<p>(a) <i>Avoidance Actions.</i> Notwithstanding the terms of paragraph 4, any party-in-interest with standing (including the Creditors' Committee) shall have 210 days from the date of the entry of this Order (the <i>\"Avoidance Action Deadline\"</i>) to file an adversary complaint with this Court (i) challenging the validity, enforceability, extent or priority of the Prepetition Goldman Liens or (ii) otherwise asserting any claims or causes of action against the Goldman Facility Agent or any of the Goldman Lenders (and/or its successors and/or assigns, if applicable) (an <i>\"Avoidance Action\"</i>) arising out of the Prepetition Goldman Facility, the Goldman Indebtedness, and/or the prepetition activities of the Goldman Facility Agent or any of the Goldman Lenders (and/or its and or their successors and assigns, if applicable). Any Avoidance Action may be filed by the Creditors' Committee or such other party in the name of the Debtors without leave of the Bankruptcy Court.</p>\n<p>(b) <i>Failure to File or Successfully Prosecute an Avoidance Action.</i> To the extent that (i) an Avoidance Action is not filed by the Avoidance Action Deadline by the Creditors' Committee or such other party or (ii) if an Avoidance Action is so filed and the Goldman Facility Agent or any of the Goldman Lenders (and/or its and/or their successors and assigns, if applicable) ultimately prevails in its defense thereof pursuant to a final non-appealable order: (A) the Goldman Indebtedness shall constitute allowed claims in an amount equal to the payment made to the Goldman Facility Agent or an assignee or designee thereof (and/or its and/or their successors and assigns, if applicable) pursuant to Paragraph 4 of this Order for all purposes in the Debtors' bankruptcy proceedings and any subsequent proceedings under the Bankruptcy Code and shall not be subject to avoidance, reduction, recovery, set off, offset, recharacterization, subordination (whether equitable, contractual, or otherwise), counterclaim, cross-claim, defense, or any other challenge under the Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable federal, state, or local law or regulation by any person or entity (including, without limitation, any trustee, successor trustee, examiner, or responsible person in these or any subsequent proceedings under the Bankruptcy Code);

(ii) the Capital Stock of any Foreign Subsidiary, other than 65% in total voting power of such Capital Stock and 100% of non-voting Capital Stock, in each case, of a first tier Foreign Subsidiary of any Obligor; (iii) any contracts, instruments, licenses, license agreements or other documents (or any rights thereunder), to the extent (and only to the extent) that the grant of a security interest would (A) <span class=\"star-pagination\">*131</span> constitute a violation of a restriction in favor of a third party on such grant, (B) give any other party to such contract, instrument, license, license agreement or other document the right to terminate its obligations thereunder, or (C) violate any law; <i>provided,</i> that the limitation set forth in this clause (iii) shall not affect, limit, restrict or impair the grant by an Obligor of a security interest pursuant to the DIP Loan Documents in any such right, to the extent that an otherwise applicable prohibition or restriction on such grant is rendered ineffective by any applicable law, including the Uniform Commercial Code (the \"<i>UCC</i>\") or the Bankruptcy Code; (iv) any direct or indirect interest in any Capital Stock of any joint venture, partnership or other entity if and for so long as the grant of such security interest or Lien shall constitute a default under or termination pursuant to the terms in effect as of the Petition Date of the joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other organizational documents of, or contract or other agreement of (or purporting to cover the assets of) such joint venture, partnership or entity or its direct or indirect parent, or require the payment of a fee, penalty or similar increased costs or result in the loss of economic benefit or the abandonment or invalidation of such Obligor's or any Subsidiary's interest in such Capital Stock or shall otherwise adversely impact such interest in such joint venture, partnership or other entity;

(v) any Ground Lease of a Debtor that has been assumed pursuant to section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code if the granting of a Lien hereunder would cause a default under or allow the termination of such Ground Lease (it being agreed that, to the extent the Lien granted pursuant to this paragraph attaches to any such Ground Lease prior to a Debtor's assumption thereof, such Lien shall automatically be released upon such assumption and any Mortgage evidencing such Lien shall automatically terminate); (vi) the Gift Card and Lotto Accounts; (vii) any Real Estate of the Non-Debtor Guarantor; and (viii) any Shopping Center Properties (defined in Paragraph 8 below) that are subject to a valid, unavoidable, prepetition lien, <i>provided, however,</i> that, notwithstanding anything set forth in the Order or the DIP Documents to the contrary, as security for the obligations under the DIP Loan Documents, the Agent, on behalf of the Lenders, shall have a pledge of the unencumbered equity of any subsidiary holding a Shopping Center Property; <i>provided, further,</i> that any such security interest and Lien shall attach immediately and automatically after any such disqualifying condition specified in clause (iii), (iv) or (v) of this Paragraph shall cease to exist.

(\"<i>U.S. Bank</i>\") in the Main Operating Account, any lien granted to a Lender or any other party shall be subordinated to U.S. Bank's asserted claim to $1,717,336.18 in the Main Operating Account; <i>provided, further,</i> that (i) the rights of any parties in interest to object to U.S. Bank's asserted setoff rights, its claims, and the forms of relief noted herein are expressly preserved and (ii) the Debtors' rights, generally, with respect to the Bank Accounts maintained at U.S. Bank are expressly preserved; <i>provided, further,</i> that other than holders of the Adequate Protection Obligations, the Agent, and the Lenders, no other Person shall have any lien or security interest in the Main Operating Account or in any funds in the Main Operating Account. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the financial institution (the \"<i>Bank</i>\") at which the Main Operating Account is maintained is authorized to charge back, offset, expense or deduct from the Main Operating Account the service charges incurred by the Bank on account of the Debtors' cash management expenses, returned checks or other returned items, including, but not limited to, dishonored checks, wire transfers, drafts, ACH Transfers or other debits, regardless of whether such amounts were deposited prepetition and regardless of whether the returned items relate to prepetition or postpetition items, and that solely the normal service charges and fees (the \"<i>Service Charges</i>\") may be assessed and deducted in the ordinary course of business from funds held in the Main Operating Account, and the automatic stay provisions of section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code are modified to allow the Bank to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*133</span> assess and collect such charges, but the automatic stay shall remain in full force and effect for all other purposes as to the Bank, including, but not limited to, any setoff rights (other than with respect to the Service Charges) that the Bank may possess. Should the Debtors transfer or otherwise utilize funds from the Main Operating Account outside of the Debtors' ordinary course of business, except as otherwise permitted under the DIP Credit Agreement or this Order, the Agent's valid, binding, perfected, enforceable, and non-avoidable liens and fully-perfected security interests in the Main Operating Account (subject and junior only to the liens securing the Adequate Protection Obligations as set forth in Paragraph 8(a) below), and all funds contained therein shall transfer and attach, on the same senior priority basis, to the Debtors' interest in such funds wherever deposited, in the proceeds and other assets created from any such use of the funds held in the Main Operating Account outside the ordinary course of the Debtors' business. During the existence of an Event of Default, all amounts held in the Main Operating Account or any Cash Collateral Account (other than amounts held in the Main Operating Account subject to the Liens in favor of the Adequate Protection Parties), at the election of the Agent, shall be applied as required by section 11.2(e) of the DIP Credit Agreement; <i>provided, however,</i> that notwithstanding the existence of an Event of Default or an acceleration of the Obligations, funds that are not subject to the first lien of the Agent shall not be transferred out of the Main Operating Account other than for ordinary course expenditures to protect and preserve the Collateral (including all documented payroll expenses (including benefits), operating expenses of the Properties, taxes, insurance premiums, ground rents with respect to the Properties, and cash management, in each case, in the ordinary course of business) and the Adequate Protection Payments; <i>provided further,</i> that notwithstanding the existence of an Event of Default or an acceleration of the Obligations, the Debtors may continue to use Cash Collateral so long as such Cash Collateral that is subject to the liens of the Adequate Protection Parties is applied to the Adequate Protection Obligations.</p>\n<p>(d) <i>General Priority of DIP Liens.</i> Subject to the provisions above (including the liens securing the Goldman Facility Indemnity set forth in Paragraph 4 and the Adequate Protection Obligations set forth more particularly in section 8(a) below), the DIP Liens shall, subject to the provisions of the Carve-Out, be at all times senior to the rights of the Debtors, their estates, and all of their creditors, and shall at all times be senior to the rights of any successor trustee, examiner, or responsible person in these or any subsequent proceedings under the Bankruptcy Code.</p>\n<p>(e) <i>Perfection of Postpetition Liens.</i> The Agent shall not be required to file financing statements, mortgages, notices of liens, or other documents in any jurisdiction or take any other action in order to validate, perfect, or establish the priority of the DIP Liens granted to them by this Order or the DIP Loan Documents. The DIP Liens granted in this Order and in the DIP Loan Documents to secure repayment of any of the Obligations are deemed perfected hereby and no further notice, filing or other act shall be required to effect such perfection. If the Lenders shall, in their sole discretion, choose to file (in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the DIP Loan Documents) financing statements, mortgages, or other documents or otherwise confirm perfection of such security interests, liens, and mortgages, the Lenders are authorized <span class=\"star-pagination\">*134</span> (to the extent not prohibited by the DIP Loan Documents) to effect such filings and recordings and all such financing statements, mortgages, or similar documents shall be deemed to have been filed or recorded at the time and on the date of entry of this Order. A photocopy of this Order may, in the discretion of the Lenders, be filed with or recorded in filing or recording offices in addition to or in lieu of such financing statements, notices of lien or similar instruments, and all filing offices are directed hereby to accept such copy of this Order for filing and recording.</p>\n<p>7. <i>Superpriority Administrative Claim Status.</i> The Obligations and the Debtors' use (if any) of Cash Collateral pursuant to the Carve-Out or otherwise pursuant to this Order shall constitute an administrative expense under section 364(c)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code, with priority, subject to the section 507(b) claims of the Adequate Protection Parties as set forth in paragraph 8(b) below and the provisions of the Carve-Out, over all other claims or costs or expenses of administration of the kinds specified in, or ordered pursuant to, any provision of the Bankruptcy Code (the \"<i>Superpriority Administrative Claim</i>\"), and shall at all times be senior to the rights of the Debtors or any successor trustee, examiner, or responsible person in these or any subsequent proceedings under the Bankruptcy Code. With the exception of the fees and expenses permitted by the Carve-Out, no costs or expenses of administration that have been or may be incurred in these cases, any conversion of any of these cases pursuant to sections 105 or 1112 of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise, or in any other future proceedings related hereto, and no priority claims, are or will be prior to or on a parity with any claim of the Lenders against the Debtors arising out of loans and extensions of credit or other financial accommodations made by the Lenders to the Debtors.</p>\n<p>8. <i>Use of Cash Collateral and Adequate Protection Parties.</i> Holders of claims against any of the Debtors, which claims are secured by the \"Shopping Center Properties,\" as such term is defined in the DIP Motion, or in any other real property of a Debtor whose cash constitutes Cash Collateral and whose cash the Debtors use (such properties collectively, the \"<i>Adequate Protection Properties</i>\" and such claimholders collectively, the \"<i>Adequate Protection Parties</i>\"), are entitled, pursuant to sections 361 and 363(e) of the Bankruptcy Code, to adequate protection of their interests in their respective prepetition collateral including the Cash Collateral (collectively, the <i>\"Prepetition Collateral</i>\"), for and equal in amount to the aggregate diminution in the value of the Adequate Protection Parties' interest in the Prepetition Collateral as may be determined by the Court (the \"<i>Aggregate Value Diminution</i>\"). Pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Order and the DIP Loan Documents, each Debtor is authorized to use all Cash Collateral, wherever it may be located and regardless of whether it is in an account controlled by any Adequate Protection Party. All Adequate Protection Parties are ordered to relinquish control over all Cash Collateral to the Debtors and shall not interfere with any effort by the Debtors or their banks to redirect Cash Collateral to the Main Operating Account. As adequate protection, the applicable Adequate Protection Parties are hereby granted the following (collectively, the \"<i>Adequate Protection Obligations</i>\"):</p>\n<p>(a) <i>Adequate Protection Liens.</i> Each applicable Adequate Protection Party is hereby granted (effective and perfected upon the date of this Order and without the necessity of execution by the Debtors <span class=\"star-pagination\">*135</span> of mortgages, security agreements, pledge agreements, financing statements or other agreements) (i) a continuing, valid, binding, enforceable, and automatically perfected postpetition first-priority security interest in, and lien on (A) the Intercompany Claims (as defined in the DIP Motion) that its respective Debtor receives on account of the net cash that flows into the Debtors' centralized Cash Management System and (B) the Main Operating Account (the \"<i>Adequate Protection First Liens</i>\") and (ii) upon the repayment in full of the Goldman Indebtedness pursuant to Paragraph 4 of this Order, a second-priority lien on the properties currently securing the Prepetition Goldman Facility (the \"<i>Adequate Protection Second Liens</i>\"), which liens shall be junior to (a) the DIP Liens and (b) the Goldman Facility Indemnity Lien, in each case of (A) and (B) above, in an amount equal to the lesser of (x) the Aggregate Value Diminution (after taking into account the value of the Prepetition Collateral) and (y) the postpetition net positive balance of the Intercompany Claim of the Debtor whose property constitutes Prepetition Collateral of the Adequate Protection Party (the Adequate Protection First Liens and the Adequate Protection Second Liens granted to each Adequate Protection Party pursuant to this paragraph, collectively, the \"<i>Adequate Protection Liens</i>\"); <i>provided, however,</i> that the Adequate Protection Liens shall be subject and subordinate only to any liens on the Collateral that are senior to, or pari passu with, the Prepetition Liens and the Carve-Out, and <i>provided further,</i> however, that notwithstanding the above, the Adequate Protection Second Liens shall be subject and subordinate to the DIP Liens and the Goldman Facility Indemnity Lien. Whether or not payments on account of the Adequate Protection Obligations are made, the holders of the Adequate Protection Second Liens shall not be entitled to exercise any rights or remedies with respect to the Adequate Protection Second Liens until the Obligations have been paid in full in cash or converted to equity and/or post reorganization debt in the manner contemplated by the DIP Credit Agreement. Notwithstanding anything set forth herein, until the DIP Obligations are paid in full, the Debtors shall not use the Collateral or the sale proceeds thereof to pay the Adequate Protection Obligations.

Any financial reports provided by the Debtors pursuant to this paragraph 8(e) shall be simultaneously provided to counsel to the Lenders and counsel to the Creditors' Committee.</p>\n<p>9. <i>Carve-Out.</i> The DIP Liens, the Adequate Protection Liens, and the Superpriority Administrative Claim shall be subject to: (i) any unpaid fees due to the United States Trustee pursuant to section 1930 of title 28 of the United States Code or otherwise and any fees due to the Clerk of the Court of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York; (ii) all reasonable fees and expenses incurred by a trustee under section 726(b) of the Bankruptcy Code in an amount not exceeding $500,000 (the \"<i>Chapter 7 Carve-Out\");</i> (iii) the reasonable expenses of members of any statutory committee (excluding fees and expenses of professional persons employed by such committee members individually); (iv) to the extent allowed at any time, all unpaid fees and expenses allowed by the Bankruptcy Court of professionals or professional firms retained pursuant to section 327 or 1103 of the Bankruptcy Code (the \"<i>Professional Persons</i>\") through the date of the acceleration of the maturity of the Term Loan; and (v) after the date of acceleration of the maturity of the Term Loan, to the extent allowed at any time, the payment of the fees and expenses of Professional Persons in an aggregate amount not to exceed $25 million minus the Chapter 7 Carve-Out (plus the amounts specified in items (i) through (iv) hereof) (the amount of all such permitted uses being defined herein as the \"<i>Carve-Out</i>\"). The Carve-Out shall exclude any fees and expenses incurred in connection with (a) any action or inaction that is in violation of or a default under any of the DIP Documents or this Order or (b) the assertion or joinder in any claim, counterclaim, action, proceeding, application, motion, objection, defenses or other contested matter, the purpose of which is to seek any order, judgment, determination or similar relief (x) invalidating, setting aside, avoiding, or subordinating, in whole or in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*137</span> part, (i) the Obligations, (ii) the DIP Liens, or (iii) any of the Agent's or Lenders' rights under the DIP Documents or (y) preventing, hindering, or delaying, whether directly or indirectly, the Agent's or Lenders' assertion or enforcement of the DIP Liens or realization upon any Collateral.</p>\n<p>10. <i>Authorization to Use Proceeds of DIP Loan Documents.</i> To the extent that the Lenders make advances or extend credit under this Order and the DIP Credit Agreement, the Debtors shall use such loans, and shall otherwise use their Cash Collateral and other assets, solely in a manner that is consistent with the terms of this Order and the DIP Loan Documents. So long as the Term Loan has not been accelerated, the Debtors are hereby authorized to use any cash proceeds of the Collateral as provided in this Order and the DIP Loan Documents.</p>\n<p>11. <i>Limitations on the Use of Proceeds.</i> No proceeds of loans or other financial accommodations made by the Lenders hereunder, and no Cash Collateral (including the Carve-Out), may be used to compensate services rendered or expenses incurred in connection with, directly or indirectly, (i) the modification, stay, or amendment of this Order without the consent of the Lenders or (ii) a violation, breach, or default of this Order or any of the DIP Documents, including, without limitation, any claim or action the purpose of which is to seek or the result of which would be to obtain any relief (a) invalidating, setting aside, avoiding, or subordinating, in whole or in part, any of the Obligations or the DIP Liens in the Collateral or (b) preventing, hindering, or otherwise delaying, whether directly or indirectly, the Lenders' or the Agent's assertion, enforcement, or realization upon any Collateral as permitted by this Order or such documents.</p>\n<p>12. <i>Sale of the Collateral and Resulting Proceeds.</i> Any proceeds of the sale, lease, or other disposition of the Collateral shall be applied in the manner consistent with this Order and the terms of the DIP Loan Documents, and the Debtors hereby irrevocably waive any right to direct the manner or application of any payments to the Lenders or any other receipts by the Lenders of proceeds of the Collateral contrary to the provisions of the DIP Loan Documents.

In the absence of immediate and full payment in cash of all of the Obligations at 9:00 a.m. (New York time) on the fifth (5th) Business Day after the date on which the Agent shall have given written notice (by facsimile or otherwise) to the Debtors and their counsel, counsel of record for the Creditors' Committee, the parties listed on the Adequate Protection Exhibit (as may be amended or supplemented in accordance with Paragraph 17(j) herein) (the \"<i>Order Amendment Notice Parties</i>\") and the United States Trustee of the Agent's intention to exercise and enforce the rights granted to the Lenders under the DIP Documents, this Order, and applicable law, the automatic stay is hereby deemed vacated, and the Agent shall be permitted to exercise such rights and remedies under such agreements, documents, and applicable law as to all or such part of the Collateral as the Agent shall, in its sole discretion, elect, including, but not limited to, the Agent's right to foreclose on the mortgages <span class=\"star-pagination\">*138</span> placed on the Primary Properties under this Order and the DIP Loan Documents. Upon such enforcement by the Agent, the Debtors shall cooperate with the Agent in the disposition of the Collateral and shall not otherwise interfere or actively encourage others to interfere with the Agent's enforcement of its rights.</p>\n<p>(b) Upon receipt of written notice by counsel to the Debtors and counsel to the Creditors' Committee of an Event of Default of any of the Debtors' Obligations, the Lenders and/or the Agent, as applicable, may immediately charge interest at the Default Rate set forth in the DIP Credit Agreement.</p>\n<p>14. <i>Enforcement of Remedies in the Bankruptcy Court.</i> In addition to the remedies set forth in the DIP Loan Documents and to provide for an orderly disposition of the Collateral, upon an occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default and written request by the Agent to counsel to the Debtors (with a copy delivered simultaneously to counsel to the Creditors' Committee), the Debtors shall, at the sole expense of the Debtors' bankruptcy estates and on such terms as set forth by the Agent, file: (i) a motion or motions seeking to sell, assume and assign, or otherwise dispose of any or all of the Collateral as the Agent may direct pursuant to sections 363 and 365 of the Bankruptcy Code; and (ii) any further motions necessary to maximize the value received from the sale or disposition of the Collateral, including, but not limited to, motions to retain any additional professionals to assist the Debtors in the sale of the Collateral.

If any or all of the provisions of this Order are hereafter modified, vacated, or stayed by subsequent order of this or any other Court, such stay, modification, or vacation shall not affect the validity of any debt to the Lenders incurred pursuant to this Order or the DIP Documents prior to the later of (i) the effective date of such stay, modification, or vacation and (ii) receipt of written notice thereof by counsel to the Agent at the addresses set forth in section 15.7 of the DIP Credit Agreement (the \"<i>Effective Time</i>\"), or otherwise affect the validity and enforceability of any DIP Lien or priority authorized hereby. Notwithstanding any such stay, modification, or vacation, any advances of funds made pursuant to this Order by the Lenders to or for the benefit of the Debtors prior to the Effective Time shall be governed in all respects by the original provisions of this Order.</p>\n<p>16. <i>Good Faith.</i> The Court has considered and determined the matters addressed in this Order pursuant to its power under section 364(c) of the Bankruptcy Code to authorize the Debtors to obtain credit and other financial accommodations on the terms agreed to by and between the Debtors and the Lenders and as set forth in this Order, the DIP Credit Agreement, and the other DIP Documents, and thus, each of the terms and conditions of the DIP Documents, as part of an authorization under such section, is subject to the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*139</span> protections contained in section 364(e) of the Bankruptcy Code.</p>\n<p>17. <i>Miscellaneous.</i></p>\n<p>(a) <i>Section 364 Waiver.</i> In consideration of the financing and other accommodations made available pursuant hereto, the Debtors irrevocably waive any right to: (i) grant or impose, or request that the Court grant or impose, under section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise, liens, security interests, or mortgages on any property, equal or superior to the priority of the DIP Liens, except as provided under the Carve-Out and the DIP Loan Documents (including the Adequate Protection Obligations); and (ii) seek authority to use Cash Collateral as defined in section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code other than as permitted by this Order, the DIP Credit Agreement, and the other DIP Loan Documents.

Such waiver shall be binding upon any successor trustee, examiner, or responsible person in these or any subsequent proceedings under the Bankruptcy Code.</p>\n<p>(b) <i>Modification of the Automatic Stay.</i> The automatic stay provisions of section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code are hereby modified as to the Agent to the extent necessary to permit the Agent to implement the provisions of this Order and the DIP Documents, thereby permitting the Agent, inter alia, (i) to receive and apply collections, payments, or proceeds of Collateral, (ii) to file any financing statements or other instruments and documents, if any, evidencing its security interests in and liens and mortgages on the Collateral, in each case, to the extent permitted by, and in accordance with, the DIP Loan Documents; (iii) to charge any fees and interest accruing under the DIP Loan Documents, and (iv) to take any or all of the actions permitted by the DIP Documents and this Order upon an Event of a Default or following acceleration of the Term Loan (<i>provided, however,</i> the Agent shall comply with the notice requirements of Rule 4001-2 of the Local Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure for the Southern District of New York).</p>\n<p>(c) <i>Prohibition of Alterations to Lenders Rights Under the DIP Documents.</i> The DIP Liens and rights, remedies, and benefits granted to the Agent pursuant to this Order and the DIP Documents shall not be modified, altered, or impaired in any manner by any plan of reorganization or order of confirmation for any of the Debtors, or by any other financings of, extensions of credit to, or incurring of debt by any of the Debtors, whether pursuant to sections 363 or 364 of the Bankruptcy Code, or otherwise, or by any other order of this Court. In connection therewith, no order (i) converting the chapter 11 case of any of the Major Entities under sections 105 or 1112 of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise shall be entered unless such order expressly provides, prior to any other relief set forth therein, for the final payment in full in cash of all of the non-contingent Obligations and treatment of the contingent Obligations in accordance with the provisions the DIP Credit Agreement, unless such Debtor would cease to be a Major Entity upon giving effect to transactions permitted under Section 9.8 of the DIP Credit Agreement, <i>provided</i> that any mandatory prepayments required under Section 3.3 of the DIP Credit Agreement shall occur substantially contemporaneously with or prior to such dismissal; or (ii) confirming any plan in any of the Major Entities' chapter 11 cases shall be entered unless such order and such plan provides for the final payment in full in cash of all the non-contingent Obligations <span class=\"star-pagination\">*140</span> and treatment of contingent Obligations in accordance with the provisions of the DIP Loan Documents on or before the effective date of such plan or, as of such time, the conversion of certain Obligations to equity and/or post reorganization indebtedness in the manner contemplated by the DIP Credit Agreement. The DIP Credit Agreement and the other DIP Documents are, to the extent applicable, hereby assumed, and none of such agreements may be rejected, abrogated, or disaffirmed in these or any subsequent proceedings under the Bankruptcy Code, including the conversion of any of these cases.</p>\n<p>(d) <i>Prohibitions In the Event of Dismissal of Any of the Cases.</i> Except to the extent provided in the DIP Loan Documents, the Debtors shall not seek dismissal of any of the chapter 11 cases of the Major Entities unless and until all of the non-contingent Obligations shall have been finally paid in full in cash or, as of such time, converted to equity and/or post reorganization indebtedness in accordance with the provisions of, and in the manner contemplated by, the DIP Credit Agreement, unless such Debtor would cease to be a Major Entity upon giving effect to transactions permitted under Section 9.8 of the DIP Credit Agreement; provided that any mandatory prepayments required under Section 3.3 of the DIP Credit Agreement shall occur substantially contemporaneously with or prior to such dismissal. If an order dismissing any of the cases of the Debtors under section 1112 of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise is at any time entered: (i) the priority claims and DIP Liens granted to the Agent pursuant to this Order and the DIP Loan Documents in the Collateral of such Debtor shall continue in full force and effect and shall maintain their priorities as provided in this Order until the Obligations shall have been finally paid in full in cash, or converted to equity in the manner contemplated by the DIP Credit Agreement; (ii) this Court shall retain jurisdiction, notwithstanding such dismissal, for purposes of interpreting this Order; and (iii) such order shall not modify the rights granted to the Lenders pursuant to this paragraph.</p>\n<p>(e) <i>Section 506(c) Waiver.</i> No costs or expenses of administration shall be imposed against the Agent or the Lenders, the Obligations, or the Collateral in respect of the DIP Loan Documents under section 506(c) of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise, and no action or inaction on the part of the Agent or the Lenders shall be deemed to constitute a consent to such surcharge.</p>\n<p>(f) <i>Section 552(b) Waiver.</i> The Agent and Lenders shall be entitled to all of the rights and benefits of section 552(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, and the \"equities of the case\" exception under section 552(b) of the Bankruptcy Code shall not apply to the Agent and the Lenders with respect to proceeds, product, offspring or profits of any of the Collateral.</p>\n<p>(g) <i>No Marshaling.</i> The Agent and the Lenders shall not be subject to the equitable doctrine of \"marshaling\" or any other similar doctrine with respect to any of the Collateral.</p>\n<p>(h) <i>Amendment.</i> The Debtors and the Agent may amend or waive any provision of the DIP Documents without the need for further approval from this Court <i>provided that:</i> (i) the DIP Documents, as so modified, are not materially different from the DIP Documents approved in this Order; (ii) notice of all amendments to the DIP Documents are filed with the Court; and (iii) notice of all amendments to the DIP Documents (other than those that are ministerial or technical and do not adversely affect the Debtors) is provided five (5) Business Days' in advance to counsel to the Creditors' Committee (the \"<i>Amendment</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*141</span> <i>Notice Period</i>\"), all parties requesting notice in these cases, the Order Amendment Notice Parties, and the United States Trustee; <i>provided, however,</i> that if the Creditors' Committee notifies the Debtors and the Agent that it objects to such an amendment within the Amendment Notice Period, such amendment shall not become effective absent entry of an Order of the Court authorizing such amendment unless such objection is resolved or withdrawn.</p>\n<p>(i) <i>Amendment of Organic Documents.</i> Each Debtor shall, and shall cause each applicable entity that it controls to, implement any necessary amendment to its certificate of incorporation, bylaws or comparable governing documents such that ownership of (1) any equity securities issued in connection with the provisions of the DIP Documents (including the conversion of all or a portion of the Term Loan, any accrued and unpaid interest, and the Exit Fee into equity and/or post reorganization indebtedness into equity under the terms therein) and (2) any other equity securities received in respect of pre-petition securities of the Debtors owned by the Lenders will not, in any case, (A) violate any applicable limitations on ownership, and (B) have any adverse consequences under any provisions in such governing documents or any shareholder rights plan or similar arrangements.</p>\n<p>(j) <i>Amendment of Adequate Protection Party Exhibit.</i> The Adequate Protection Party Exhibit filed as an exhibit to the Debtors' Reply, dated May 6, 2009, may be amended, <i>provided that</i> such exhibit, as so amended, shall be served within two (2) business days therefrom on (a) the U.S. Trustee, (b) the Adequate Protection Parties, (c) the Creditors' Committee, and (d) the Lenders. To the extent the Debtors are required to make any Adequate Protection Payments to any Adequate Protection Party, the Debtors shall rely on the contact and/or payment information contained in the Adequate Protection Party Exhibit. Any Adequate Protection Party who wishes to revise the contact information contained in the Adequate Protection Party Exhibit shall notify the Debtors in writing of such change and, to the extent one Adequate Protection Party seeks to replace another, such Adequate Protection Party shall also provide notice to the Adequate Protection Party to be replaced (the \"<i>Replacement Notice</i>\") which Replacement Notice shall be countersigned by the Adequate Protection Party to be replaced or such other arrangement as the Debtors may determine in their sole discretion shall be acceptable to evidence the replacement of the applicable Adequate Protection Party.</p>\n<p>(k) <i>Reimbursement of Costs and Expenses.</i> The Agent and Lenders shall be promptly reimbursed by the Debtors without further motion to, hearing by, or order of this Court for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including, without limitation, all filing and recording fees, attorneys' and paralegals' fees and expenses, and out-of-pocket expenses) (the \"<i>Expense Reimbursement</i>\"), in each case, as provided for in the DIP Documents; <i>provided, however,</i> that the Agent shall serve, by facsimile or electronic mail, each Expense Reimbursement on the United States Trustee, counsel to the Debtors, and counsel to the Creditors' Committee (the \"<i>Expense Reimbursement Notice Parties</i>\"). If, after ten (10) Business Days after receipt by the Expense Reimbursement Notice Parties of any Expense Reimbursement, the Expense Reimbursement Notice Parties do not deliver to the Agent an objection to the reasonableness of such Expense Reimbursement, then the Debtors shall promptly pay the Agent and the Lenders such Expense Reimbursement.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*142</span> <i>(l) Releases.</i> The Debtors hereby each release and discharge the Agent, the Lenders, and their attorneys, officers, directors, affiliates, agents, and employees (the \"<i>Lender Parties</i>\") from any and all claims and causes of action arising out of the Lender Parties' relationship with any of the Debtors in connection with, in any manner directly or indirectly, the Loan Documents, this Order, the negotiation of any of the foregoing, or any action or inaction in connection therewith or the facilities, consideration, agreements, documents, or reimbursements related to the foregoing.</p>\n<p>(m) <i>No Third Party Beneficiary.</i> No party not referenced in this Order is intended to be or shall be deemed to be a third party beneficiary of the provisions of this Order or any of the DIP Documents.</p>\n<p>(n) <i>Action by Lenders.</i> Any action authorized to be taken on behalf of the Lenders as a whole by the Majority Lenders or by the Agent pursuant the terms of any of the DIP Documents shall be deemed to be the action of the Lenders under this Order.</p>\n<p>(<i>o</i>) <i>Amendment of Order.</i> The Debtors shall, with the consent of the DIP Lenders, be entitled to amend this Order so as to make any non-substantive, non-material changes, <i>provided</i> that the Debtors provide counsel to the Creditors' Committee and the Order Amendment Notice Parties five (5) Business Days' notice in advance of any such amendment (the \"<i>Order Amendment Notice Period</i>\") and the Debtors shall file such amended order with the Court; <i>provided, further,</i> that if the Order Amendment Notice Parties or the Creditors' Committee notify the Debtors and the Agent that it objects to such an amendment to the Order within the Order Amendment Notice Period, such amended Order shall not become effective absent entry of an Order of the Court authorizing such amendment unless such objection is resolved or withdrawn. Notice of any amendment of the Order shall be provided to all parties entitled to receive notice of such amended Order.</p>\n<p>(p) <i>Order Controlling.</i> To the extent any terms of this Order are inconsistent with the terms set forth in the DIP Documents, the terms of this Order shall control.</p>\n<p>18. <i>Limitations on Liens.</i> Notwithstanding anything in this Order, (including clause (viii) in the first paragraph of Paragraph 6 above), any order authorizing use of cash collateral entered prior to the date hereof, any Order entered approving the operation of the Debtors' cash management system (including docket #43), the DIP Credit Agreement and related documents to the contrary, the Debtors are not authorized to use distributions on account of the direct or indirect equity interests in GGP Ivanhoe, Inc., or its subsidiaries, including cash dividends, the equity interests, or any proceeds of the foregoing, to the extent subject to the lien of Ivanhoe Capital LP and nothing herein or in the other Orders and documents referred to above shall be deemed to authorize or grant a lien or security interest to, or encumbrance in favor of, any party in or on any of such property or any of the proceeds thereof or to eliminate, modify, subordinate or cut off any lien or security interest Ivanhoe Capital LP would otherwise have, if any, in such property or proceeds. The foregoing shall not prejudice the right of the Debtors and Ivanhoe Capital LP to seek further relief from the Court after notice to each other nor prevent GGP Limited Partnership or the any of the Debtors from using Ivanhoe Capital LP's cash collateral upon consent by Ivanhoe Capital LP.</p>\n<p>19. <i>Immediate Effectiveness.</i> Notwithstanding Bankruptcy Rules 6004(h), <span class=\"star-pagination\">*143</span> 6006(d), 7062, or 9014 or any other Bankruptcy Rule, or Rule 62(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, this Order shall be valid and fully effective immediately upon its entry, and, upon such entry, shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Agent, the Lenders, the Debtors, their estates, and their respective successors and assigns (including, without limitation, any trustee, examiner, or responsible person hereinafter appointed as a representative of any of the estates in these or any subsequent proceedings under the Bankruptcy Code), and the terms and provisions of this Order as well as the liens, security interests, and mortgages and other terms of the DIP Credit Agreement and the other DIP Documents shall continue in these proceedings and any superseding proceedings under the Bankruptcy Code, and such liens, security interests, and mortgages shall maintain their priority as provided by this Order, until satisfied and discharged. This Order likewise shall be immediately binding and effective on the terms set forth above with respect to any other debtor that shall become part of the Case upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition or entry of the order for relief for such debtor, and, at such time, such debtor shall be deemed party to all of the DIP Documents; <i>provided, however,</i> that with respect to such subsequent debtor, subject to (x) the right of any party in interest to move, within 20 days after the date on which such subsequent debtor files its bankruptcy petition, to restrict the application of this Order to the subsequent debtor's case and (y) the Debtors' rights to object to such relief.</p>\n<p>20. <i>Notice.</i> The Debtors shall, within three (3) Business Days, serve by mail a copy of this Order on the Notice Parties and any other persons which the Debtors know are entitled to notice under Bankruptcy Rule 4001(c).

Subject to Section 10.1, the Lenders agree, on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, to make a single advance in the amount equal to its Commitment or such lesser amount as is authorized by the Financing Order to the Borrowers on or, at the Lenders' option, before the date which is two (2) Business Days following the Entry Date.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*175</span> (b) No Liability.

The Agent shall record on its books the principal amount of the Term Loan owing to each Lender from time to time. In addition, each Lender is authorized, at such Lender's option, to note the date and amount of each payment or prepayment of principal of such Lender's Term Loan in its books and records, including computer records, such books and records constituting presumptive evidence, absent manifest error, of the accuracy of the information contained therein.</p>\n<p>(d) Term Notes.

Subject to Section 2.5, all interest charges on the Obligations shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and actual days elapsed (which results in more interest being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365-day year).</p>\n<p>(b) The basis for determining the LIBOR Rate and the Interest Period with respect to the Term Loan or any portion of the Term Loan (as the Borrowers may elect), shall be selected by the Borrowers and notified to Agent pursuant to the applicable Funding Notice or Continuation Notice, as the case may be.</p>\n<p>(c) The Borrowers shall deliver a Continuation Notice to Agent no later than 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) at least three Business Days in advance of the expiration of any Interest Period.</p>\n<p>(d) In the event the Borrowers fail to specify an Interest Period for determining the LIBOR Rate in the applicable Funding Notice or Continuation Notice, or if the Borrowers fail to deliver a Continuation Notice as required pursuant to clause (c) above, the LIBOR Rate for <span class=\"star-pagination\">*176</span> the related Term Loan will be automatically determined using one-month LIBOR for purposes of clause (b) of the definition of \"LIBOR Rate.\"</p>\n<p>(e) Default Rate.

Subject to Section 2.5, the Borrowers agree to pay, to the Agent for the Agent's own account, collateral management, agency and administrative fees at the times and in the amounts separately agreed in writing among the Borrowers and the Agent, provided that the amount of such fees shall not exceed $30,000 per month but may be required to be paid annually in advance.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*177</span> ARTICLE 3</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>PAYMENTS AND PREPAYMENTS</h2>\n<p>Section 3.1 Term Loan. The Borrowers jointly and severally agree to repay the outstanding principal balance of the Term Loan plus all accrued but unpaid interest thereon, together with all other non-contingent Obligations, on the Maturity Date; provided that the General Partner (on its own behalf and on behalf of GGPLP) shall have the right to elect to convert the outstanding principal amount of the Term Loan, the Exit Fee and accrued and unpaid interest due and owing upon the Plan Date (the \"Conversion Amount\") to equity and/or debt to the extent permitted by, and in the manner set forth on, Schedule 3.1-A. Accrued and unpaid interest on the Term Loan shall be due and payable on each Payment Date (beginning on June 1, 2009) and on the Maturity Date, and the Borrowers agree to pay such accrued and unpaid interest on such dates (it being understood that the payment of interest on the Maturity Date may be paid by conversion of such amounts to the extent permitted by the preceding sentence).</p>\n<p>Section 3.2 Optional Prepayment of the Term Loan. The Borrowers may prepay the principal of the Term Loan, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time by (a) providing to the Agent two (2) Business Days prior written notice of its intention to make such prepayment and (b) paying to the Agent (i) all accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being prepaid and (ii) the required Exit Fee, in each case concurrently with the making of such prepayment; provided, however, that each such optional prepayment shall be in a minimum principal amount of $1,000,000 and integral multiples of $500,000 in excess thereof.</p>\n<p>Section 3.3 Mandatory Prepayments of the Term Loan. The Borrowers shall prepay the principal amount of the Term Loan at the following times and in the following amounts:</p>\n<p>(a) (i) in the case of a sale or disposition pursuant to Section 9.8(d) within two (2) Business Days (during which period no Obligor shall be entitled to make any Restricted Payments) and (ii) in the case of any sale or disposition of condominiums pursuant to Section 9.8(f)(i), on or before the last Business Day of the applicable Fiscal Quarter during which such sale or disposition was made of (A) any First Lien Property (or any Debtor owning such First Lien Property or its direct or indirect parent holding company) or (B) any Negative Pledge Property (or any Debtor owning such Negative Pledge Property or its direct or indirect parent holding company), all proceeds of such sale or other disposition net of (1) the reasonable and customary out-of-pocket costs and expenses of such sale or disposition paid to Persons that are not Obligors or their Subsidiaries, (2) the amount applied to all obligations secured by a Pre-Petition Lien on the asset being sold or the Capital Stock of the Person (or the direct holding company of such Person) owning such asset being sold which is secured by any Pre-Petition Lien, (3) the amount of sales and transfer taxes that are payable by a Debtor or any Affiliate in connection therewith, (4) in the case of a sale or disposition of (x) First Lien Property, to the extent the net proceeds of all such sales or dispositions since the Closing Date exceed $75,000,000 in the aggregate and (y) Negative Pledge Property, the Negative Pledge Property <span class=\"star-pagination\">*178</span> Retention Amount, if applicable, and (5) an amount equal to the Exit Fee that will be payable in connection with such sale or disposition;</p>\n<p>(b) with respect to the Loss Proceeds of any Casualty or Condemnation with respect to any Property of any Debtor, at the time and in the amount of such prepayment as required by Section 9.4(e), net of an amount equal to the Exit Fee that will be payable in connection with the application of such Loss Proceeds;</p>\n<p>(c) notwithstanding any of the other provisions of this Section 3.3, so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, if any prepayment of the Term Loan is required to be made on a date other than on the last day of the Interest Period therefor and Breakage Costs would be payable as a result of prepayment on such other date, the Borrowers may, if Lenders have been requested in writing to, and have elected not to, waive such Breakage Costs, retain such amount of any such prepayment otherwise required to be made hereunder in a Breakage Prepayment Account (or pursuant to other arrangements satisfactory to the Agent) until the last day of such Interest Period, at which time such prepayment shall be made. For purposes of this clause (c), the term \"Breakage Prepayment Account\" means a deposit or securities account established by a Borrower with a bank or other financial institution designated by the Agent and over which the Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal for application in accordance with this clause (c), pursuant to an account control agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Agent. If the maturity of the Term Loan has been accelerated pursuant to Section 11.2, or if the Term Loan has matured in accordance with its terms the Agent shall at the direction of the Majority Lenders, apply all amounts on deposit in the Breakage Prepayment Accounts (or otherwise held by the Agent) to satisfy any of the Obligations; and</p>\n<p>(d) notwithstanding any of the other provisions of this Section 3.3, so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, any prepayment of the Term Loan required to be made pursuant to this Section may, at the election of the Borrowers, be maintained in a Prepayment Cash Collateral Account (or pursuant to other arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Agent) and, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, such amount shall not be required to be applied to reduce the principal amount of the Term Loan at such time as would otherwise be required by this Section 3.3. For purposes of this clause (d), the term \"Prepayment Cash Collateral Account\" means a deposit or securities account established by a Borrower with a bank designated by the Agent and over which the Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal for application in accordance with this clause (d), provided that the Borrowers shall have the right to reasonably direct the investment of amounts on deposit in a Prepayment Cash Collateral Account in Cash Equivalents as the Borrowers shall elect. If the maturity of the Term Loan has been accelerated pursuant to Section 11.2 or if the Term Loan has matured in accordance with its terms, the Agent shall at the direction of the Majority Lenders apply all amounts on deposit in the Prepayment Cash Collateral Accounts (or otherwise held by the Agent) to satisfy any of the Obligations.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*179</span> Section 3.4 Payments by the Borrowers.</p>\n<p>(a) All payments to be made by the Borrowers shall be made without set-off, recoupment, or counterclaim except as otherwise expressly permitted hereunder. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrowers shall be made to the Agent, for the account of the Lenders (but in any event in one wire transfer), at the Agent's address set forth in Section 15.7, and shall be made in Dollars and in immediately available funds, no later than 3:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the date specified herein. Any payment received by the Agent later than 3:00 p.m. (New York City time) may, at the option of the Agent, be deemed to have been received on the following Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue.</p>\n<p>(b) Unless the Agent receives notice from the Borrowers prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders that the Borrowers will not make such payment in full as and when required, the Agent may assume that the Borrowers have made such payment in full to the Agent on such date in immediately available funds and the Agent may (but shall not be so required), in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to each Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender. If and to the extent the Borrowers have not made such payment in full to the Agent, each Lender shall repay to the Agent on demand such amount distributed to such Lender, together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Rate for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date repaid.</p>\n<p>(c) The Borrowers agree to compensate each Lender for any loss, cost or expense (collectively, \"Breakage Costs\") actually incurred by such Lender as a result of the making of a payment of the Term Loan for any reason (including, without limitation, the acceleration of the maturity of the Term Loan following an Event of Default) on a day that is not the last day of the applicable interest period. To avoid doubt \"Breakage Costs\" shall not include the interest margins applicable to such prepaid Term Loan. Each Lender will furnish to the Borrowers a certificate setting forth the basis and amount of each request by such Lender for compensation under this Section 3.4(c), which certificate shall provide reasonable detail as to the calculation of such Breakage Costs. Such certificate shall constitute prima facie evidence of the amount of such Breakage Costs, which shall be calculated by each Lender on a reasonable basis, consistent with the basis on which such calculations are then being made by similarly situated banks or financial institutions generally.</p>\n<p>Section 3.5 Apportionment, Application, and Reversal of Payments. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, aggregate principal and interest payments shall be apportioned ratably among the Lenders (according to the unpaid principal balance of the Term Loan to which such payments relate held by each Lender) and payments of the fees (including, without limitation, the Exit Fees) shall, as applicable, be apportioned ratably among the Lenders as of the date such fees are received by the Agent. Except as specifically provided otherwise herein or in the Financing Order, all payments shall be remitted to the Agent and all such payments not constituting payment of specific fees, and all proceeds of Accounts or other Collateral received by the Agent, shall be applied, ratably, subject to the provisions of this Agreement, FIRST, to pay any interest or fees then due with respect to, or which constitute, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*180</span> Obligations, SECOND, to pay or prepay principal of the Term Loan under this Agreement, and THIRD, to the payment of any other Obligation. The Agent shall promptly distribute to each Lender, pursuant to the applicable wire transfer instructions received from each Lender in writing, such funds as it may be entitled to receive.</p>\n<p>Section 3.6 Indemnity for Returned Payments. If, after receipt of any payment which is applied to the payment of all or any part of the Obligations, the Agent or any Lender is for any reason compelled to surrender such payment or proceeds to any Person because such payment or application of proceeds is invalidated, declared fraudulent, set aside, determined to be void or voidable as a preference, impermissible set-off, or a diversion of trust funds, or for any other reason, then the Obligations or part thereof intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued and this Agreement shall continue in full force as if such payment or proceeds had not been received by the Agent or such Lender and the Borrowers shall be liable to pay to the Agent and the Lenders, and hereby do indemnify the Agent and the Lenders and hold the Agent and the Lenders harmless for, the amount of such payment or proceeds surrendered. The provisions of this Section 3.6 shall be and remain effective notwithstanding any contrary action which may have been taken by the Agent or any Lender in reliance upon such payment or application of proceeds, and any such contrary action so taken shall be without prejudice to the Agent's and the Lenders' rights under this Agreement and shall be deemed to have been conditioned upon such payment or application of proceeds having become final and irrevocable. The provisions of this Section 3.6 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.</p>\n<p>Section 3.7 The Agent's Books and Records. The Obligors agree that the Agent's books and records showing the Obligations and the transactions pursuant to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be admissible in any action or proceeding arising therefrom, and shall constitute rebuttably presumptive proof thereof, irrespective of whether any Obligation is also evidenced by a promissory note or other instrument. Such books and records shall be deemed correct, accurate, and binding on the Borrowers and an account stated (except for corrections of errors discovered by the Agent) in the absence of evidence to the contrary. In the event a timely written notice of objections is given by the Borrowers, only the items to which exception is expressly made will be considered to be disputed by the Borrowers.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>ARTICLE 4</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>CASH COLLATERAL ACCOUNTS</h2>\n<p>Section 4.1 Cash Collateral Accounts.</p>\n<p>(a) All cash of the Obligors shall be deposited by the Obligors in one or more accounts subject to the perfected Agent's Lien by virtue of, and having the priority set forth in, the Financing Order and, except for the Main Operating Account, if at any time required by the Agent upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, under its exclusive dominion and control upon written notice to the General Partner and the applicable financial institution. Such funds shall be held in a Cash Collateral Account until such time as the amounts held therein are applied by the relevant Obligors to pay expenses or otherwise <span class=\"star-pagination\">*181</span> used in accordance with this Agreement. So long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, amounts held in a Cash Collateral Account shall be available to the Obligors for use in a manner or for a purpose not prohibited by this Agreement. During the existence of an Event of Default all amounts held in any Cash Collateral Account (other than amounts held in the Main Operating Account subject to the Liens in favor of the Adequate Protection Parties (as defined in the Financing Order)), at the election of the Agent, shall be applied as required by Section 11.2(e); provided that during the existence of an Event of Default (1) notwithstanding the existence of such Event of Default or an acceleration of the Obligations, funds in the Main Operating Account that are not subject to the first priority Agent's Lien shall not be transferred out of the Main Operating Account other than for ordinary course expenditures to protect and preserve the Collateral, (including all documented payroll expenses (including benefits), operating expenses of the Properties, taxes, insurance premiums, ground rents with respect to the Properties, and cash management, in each case, in the ordinary course of business, and the adequate protection payments) and (2) funds in any Cash Collateral Account that are subject to the first priority Agent's Lien (x) may, until otherwise directed by Agent, be transferred out of the Cash Collateral Accounts only for ordinary course expenditures to protect and preserve the Collateral (including all documented payroll expenses (including benefits), operating expenses of the Properties, taxes, insurance premiums, ground rents with respect to the Properties, and cash management, in each case, in the ordinary course of business and (y) at the Agent's sole discretion and with the consent of the Majority Lenders, any funds in the Cash Collateral Accounts that are subject to the first priority Agent's Lien may instead be applied at the direction of the Agent.</p>\n<p>(b) If no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Obligors may invest the funds in any Cash Collateral Account as permitted by the Bankruptcy Court.</p>\n<p>(c) The Non-Debtor Guarantor shall maintain one or more accounts for the collection of the revenues and income of the Non-Debtor Guarantor and its Subsidiaries.

any change or alteration that is adverse in any material respect to the Lenders to (i) the consolidated cash management system of the Obligors, as such system existed on the Petition Date (other than changes in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices), or (ii) any order entered by the Bankruptcy Court in the Debtors' chapter 11 cases approving such cash management system, or</p>\n<p>(p) a Change in Control.</p>\n<p>Section 11.2 Remedies.</p>\n<p>(a) If an Event of Default exists, the Agent may, in its discretion, and shall, at the direction of the Majority Lenders, at any time or times and in any order, without notice to or demand on any Obligor, restrict the amount of or refuse to permit any Lender to make the Term Loan. If an Event of Default exists, the Agent shall, at the direction of the Majority Lenders, do one or more of the following, in addition to the action described in the preceding sentence, at any time or times and in any order, without notice to or demand on any Obligor except as required by Section 11.2(e): (A) terminate the Commitments and the other obligations of the Agent and the Lenders under this Agreement; (B) declare any or all Obligations to be immediately due and payable; and (C) pursue its other rights and remedies under the Loan Documents, the Financing Order and/or applicable law. Except as otherwise provided in the Financing Order, the Agent and the Lenders may exercise any of the foregoing remedies without demand and without further application to or order of the Bankruptcy Court.</p>\n<p>(b) Each Obligor recognizes that the Agent may be unable to effect a public sale of any or all of the Collateral that constitutes securities to be sold by reason of certain prohibitions contained in the laws of any jurisdiction outside the United States or in applicable federal or state securities laws but may be compelled to resort to one or more private sales thereof to a restricted group of purchasers who will be obliged to agree, among other things, to acquire such Collateral to be sold for their own account for investment and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof. Each Obligor acknowledges and agrees that any such private sale may result in prices and other terms less favorable to the seller than if such sale were a public sale and, notwithstanding such circumstances, agrees that any such private sale shall, to the extent permitted by law, be deemed to have been made in a commercially reasonable manner. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*229</span> Unless required by a Legal Requirement, the Agent shall not be under any obligation to delay a sale of any of such Collateral to be sold for the period of time necessary to permit the issuer of such securities to register such securities under the laws of any jurisdiction outside the United States or under any applicable federal or state securities laws, even if such issuer would agree to do so. Each Obligor further agrees to do or cause to be done, to the extent that such Obligor may do so under Legal Requirements, all such other acts and things as may be necessary to make such sales or resales of any portion or all of such Collateral or other property to be sold valid and binding and in compliance with any and all Legal Requirements at the Obligors' expense. Each Obligor further agrees that a breach of any of the covenants contained in this Section 11.2(b) will cause irreparable injury to the Agent and the Lenders for which there is no adequate remedy at law and, as a consequence, agrees that each covenant contained in this Section 11.2(b) shall be specifically enforceable against such Obligor, and each Obligor hereby waives and agrees, to the fullest extent permitted by law, not to assert as a defense against an action for specific performance of such covenants that (i) such Obligor's failure to perform such covenants will not cause irreparable injury to the Agent and the Lenders or (ii) the Agent or the Lenders have an adequate remedy at law in respect of such breach. Each Obligor further acknowledges the impossibility of ascertaining the amount of damages which would be suffered by the Agent and the Lenders by reason of a breach of any of the covenants contained in this Section 11.2(b) and, consequently, agrees that, if such Obligor shall breach any of such covenants and the Agent or the Lenders shall sue for damages for such breach, such Obligor shall pay to the Agent, for the benefit of the Agent and the Lenders, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, an aggregate amount equal to the value of the Collateral or other property to be sold on the date the Agent shall demand compliance with this Section 11.2(b).</p>\n<p>(c) If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing: (i) the Agent shall have for the benefit of the Lenders, in addition to all other rights of the Agent and the Lenders, the rights and remedies of a secured party under the UCC; (ii) the Agent may, at any time, take possession of, foreclose on and/or request a receiver of the Collateral and keep it on any Obligor's premises, at no cost to the Agent or any Lender, or remove any part of it to such other place or places as the Agent may desire, or the Obligors shall, upon the Agent's demand, at the Obligors' cost, assemble the Collateral and make it available to the Agent at a place reasonably convenient to the Agent; (iii) the Agent may sell and deliver any Collateral at public or private sales, for cash, upon credit, or otherwise, at such prices and upon such terms as the Agent deems advisable, in its sole discretion, and may, if the Agent deems it reasonable, postpone or adjourn any sale of the Collateral by an announcement at the time and place of sale or of such postponed or adjourned sale, (iv) the Agent may hold, lease, develop, manage, operate, control and otherwise use the First Lien Properties upon such terms and conditions as the Agent may deem reasonable under the circumstances (making such repairs, alterations, additions and improvements and taking other actions, from time to time, as the Agent deems reasonably necessary or desirable), exercise all such rights and powers of each Obligor with respect to the First Lien Properties, whether in the name of Obligor or otherwise, including without limitation the right to make, cancel, enforce or modify leases, obtain and evict tenants, and demand, sue for, collect and receive all rents, in each case, in accordance with the standards applicable to the Agent under the Loan Documents; (v) the Agent may employ consultants to inspect the First Lien Properties and to assure compliance by each Obligor of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*230</span> terms and conditions of the Loan Documents and to take any other reasonable actions, as the Agent deems reasonably necessary or desirable, in connection with the First Lien Properties (including preparing for the disposition thereof), and all actual, reasonable, out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred in connection therewith shall be borne by the Obligors and (vi) upon demand from the Agent, the applicable Obligor shall direct the grantor or licensor of, or the contracting party to, any property agreement with respect to any First Lien Property to recognize and accept the Agent, for the benefit of and on behalf of the Lenders, as the party to such agreement for any and all purposes as fully as it would recognize and accept such Obligor and the performance of such Obligor thereunder and, in such events, without further notice or demand and at such Obligor's sole cost and expense, the Agent, for the benefit of and on behalf of the Lenders, may exercise all rights of such Obligor arising under such agreements. Without in any way requiring notice to be given in the following manner, each Obligor agrees that any notice by the Agent of sale, disposition, or other intended action hereunder or in connection herewith, whether required by the UCC or otherwise, shall constitute reasonable notice to such Obligor if such notice is mailed by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, or is delivered personally against receipt, at least ten (10) Business Days prior to such action to the Obligors' address specified in or pursuant to Section 15.7. If any Collateral is sold on terms other than payment in full at the time of sale, no credit shall be given against the Obligations until the Agent or the Lenders receive payment, and if the buyer defaults in payment, the Agent may resell the Collateral. In the event the Agent seeks to take possession of all or any portion of the Collateral by judicial process, each Obligor irrevocably waives: (A) the posting of any bond, surety, or security with respect thereto which might otherwise be required; (B) any demand for possession prior to the commencement of any suit or action to recover the Collateral; and (C) any requirement that the Agent retain possession and not dispose of any Collateral until after trial or final judgment. Each Obligor agrees that the Agent has no obligation to preserve rights to the Collateral or marshal any Collateral for the benefit of any Person. The Agent is hereby granted a license or other right to use, without charge, each Obligor's labels, patents, copyrights, name, trade secrets, trade names, trademarks, and advertising matter, or any similar property, in completing production of, advertising, or selling any Collateral, and each such Obligor's rights under all licenses and all franchise agreements shall inure to the Agent's benefit for such purpose. The proceeds of sale shall be applied first to all expenses of sale, including reasonable attorneys' fees, and then to the Obligations. The Agent will return any excess to the applicable Obligor and the Obligors shall remain liable for any deficiency.</p>\n<p>(d) The Obligors acknowledge and agree that the Lenders would not provide the Term Loan if, among other things, they were not assured that if an Event of Default specifically occurs, the Agent, on behalf of the Lenders, may obtain all amounts in the Cash Collateral Accounts (other than amounts held in the Main Operating Account subject to the Liens in favor of the Adequate Protection Parties (as defined in the Financing Order)) and apply them immediately to the Obligations, and otherwise exercise the other rights and remedies available to the Agent.</p>\n<p>(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) neither the Agent nor any Lender shall take any action under this Section 11.2 (or similar provisions of any Loan <span class=\"star-pagination\">*231</span> Document) except after compliance with any applicable notice requirements applicable thereto set forth in accordance with the Financing Order, and (ii) following the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, all amounts received by the Agent on account of the Obligations, from the Obligors and/or all amounts with respect to the proceeds of any Collateral (including, after the Agent has given the General Partner notice of the exercise of control, all amounts in the Cash Collateral Accounts, other than amounts held in the Main Operating Account subject to the Liens in favor of the Adequate Protection Parties (as defined in the Financing Order)) shall be (subject to the proviso below) promptly disbursed by the Agent as follows, unless otherwise agreed by the Agent and the Majority Lenders: (A) first, to the payment of expenses incurred by the Agent in the performance of its duties and the enforcement of the rights and remedies of the Agent and the Lenders under the Loan Documents, including, without limitation, all costs and expenses of collection, reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs and other amounts required to be paid or reimbursed by the Obligors to the Agent or the Lenders as provided by this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents; (B) second, to the Lenders, pro rata in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares, until interest accrued on the Term Loan has been paid in full; (C) third, to the Lenders, pro rata in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares, until principal of the Term Loan then due and payable (if any) has been paid in full; (D) fourth, to the Agent, any remaining amount owed to the Agent pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (E) fifth, to each Lender, any remaining amount owed to such Lender pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any other Loan Document hereof multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is all remaining amounts owed to such Lender hereunder and thereunder and the denominator of which is the aggregate of all remaining amounts due all Lenders hereunder and thereunder, until all such remaining amounts have been paid in full and (F) lastly, to the extent the non-contingent Obligations have been paid in full, to the Borrowers; provided that during the existence of an Event of Default (1) notwithstanding the existence of such Event of Default or an acceleration of the Obligations, funds in the Main Operating Account that are not subject to the first priority Agent's Lien shall not be transferred out of the Main Operating Account other than for ordinary course expenditures to protect and preserve the Collateral (including all documented payroll expenses (including benefits), operating expenses of the Properties, taxes, insurance premiums, ground rents with respect to the Properties, and cash management, in each case, in the ordinary course of business, and the adequate protection payments), (2) funds in any Cash Collateral Account that are subject to the first priority Agent's Lien (x) may, until otherwise directed by Agent, be transferred out of the Cash Collateral Accounts only for ordinary course expenditures to protect and preserve the Adequate Protection Properties (as defined in the Financing Order) (including all documented payroll expenses (including benefits), operating expenses of such Properties, taxes, insurance premiums, ground rents with respect to such Properties, and cash management, in each case, in the ordinary course of business) and (y) at the Agent's sole discretion and with the consent of the Majority Lenders, any funds in the Cash Collateral Accounts that are subject to the first priority Agent's Lien may instead be applied at the direction of the Agent and (3) all proceeds received by the Agent and the Lenders in respect of sales of Collateral subject to a Pre-Petition Lien shall first be paid to the holder of such Pre-Petition Lien to the extent of its priority interest in such proceeds. The order of priority set forth in this Section 11.2(e) and the related provisions of this Agreement are set forth solely to determine the rights and priorities of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*232</span> Agent and the Lenders as among themselves. The order of priority set forth in this Section 11.2(e) may at any time and from time to time be changed by the Agent and the Lenders without necessity of notice to or consent of or approval by any Obligor or any other Person.</p>\n<p>(f) An Event of Default shall occur as set forth in this Agreement even if an act or circumstance which gives rise, directly or indirectly, to such Event of Default has been authorized by the Bankruptcy Court or another court or tribunal with jurisdiction over the Case. Neither the Agent nor any Lender shall have any obligation whatsoever to object to any relief requested by any Debtor from the Bankruptcy Court or another court or tribunal with jurisdiction over the Case if and because such relief would or may constitute, or would or may lead to, an Event of Default, or the Agent's or any Lender's failure to object to such relief shall not limit the Events of Default under this Agreement, constitute a waiver or release of rights and remedies under this Agreement, estop or preclude the Agent or any Lender from fully enforcing the same, or have any res judicata effect on whether an Event of Default has occurred under this Agreement. Each Debtor shall be fully responsible for determining whether any relief it seeks from the Bankruptcy Court or another court or tribunal with jurisdiction over the Case would or may constitute, or would or may lead to, an Event of Default under this Agreement, and authorization for such relief shall not limit in any manner whatsoever such Debtor's obligation to fully comply with all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement.</p>\n<p>(g) Without limiting the remedies of the Agent and the Lenders hereunder, each Obligor further agrees that a breach of any of the covenants and agreements of the Obligors contained in paragraphs (4) of Schedule 3.1-A will cause irreparable injury to the Agent and the Lenders for which there is no adequate remedy at law and, as a consequence, agrees that each such covenant and agreement contained in paragraphs (4) of Schedule 3.1-A shall be specifically enforceable against such Obligor, and the Agent and the Lenders shall be entitled to obtain injunctive relief with respect thereto without any bond or other security being required, and each Obligor hereby waives and agrees, to the fullest extent permitted by law, not to assert as a defense against an action for specific performance of such covenants that (i) such Obligor's failure to perform such covenants will not cause irreparable injury to the Agent and the Lenders or (ii) the Agent or the Lenders have an adequate remedy at law in respect of such breach.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>ARTICLE 12</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>GUARANTY</h2>\n<p>Section 12.1 Guaranty, Limitation of Liability.</p>\n<p>(a) Each Guarantor, jointly and severally, hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the punctual payment when due, whether at scheduled maturity or on any date of a required prepayment or by acceleration, demand or otherwise, of all Obligations of each other Obligor now or hereafter existing under or in respect of the Loan Documents, whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, and whether for principal, interest, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*233</span> premiums, fees, indemnities, contract causes of action, costs, expenses or otherwise (such Obligations being the \"Guaranteed Obligations\"), and agrees to pay any and all reasonable outof-pocket expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable out-of-pocket fees and expenses of counsel but excluding allocated costs of in-house counsel) incurred by the Agent or any Lender in enforcing any rights under this Guaranty or any other Loan Document. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Guarantor's liability shall extend to all amounts that constitute part of the Guaranteed Obligations and would be owed by any other Obligor to the Agent or any Lender under or in respect of the Loan Documents but for the fact that they are unenforceable or not allowable due to the existence of a bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding involving such other Obligor.</p>\n<p>(b) Each Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably agrees that in the event any payment shall be required to be made to the Agent or any Lender under this Guaranty, such Guarantor will contribute, to the maximum extent permitted by law, such amounts to each other Guarantor so as to maximize the aggregate amount paid to the Agent and the Lenders under or in respect of the Loan Documents.</p>\n<p>Section 12.2 Guaranty Absolute. Each Guarantor guarantees that the Guaranteed Obligations will be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents, regardless of any law, regulation or order now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction affecting any of such terms or the rights of the Agent or any Lender with respect thereto. The Obligations of each Guarantor under or in respect of this Guaranty are independent of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other Obligations of any other Obligor under or in respect of the Loan Documents, and a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against each Guarantor to enforce this Guaranty, irrespective of whether any action is brought against any Borrower or any other Obligor or whether any Borrower or any other Obligor is joined in any such action or actions.

Each Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably agrees not to exercise any rights that it may now have or hereafter acquire against any Borrower or any other Obligor that arise from the existence, payment, performance or enforcement of such Guarantor's Obligations under or in respect of this Guaranty or any other Loan Document, including, without limitation, any right of subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or indemnification and any right to participate in any claim or remedy of the Agent or any Lender against any Borrower or any other Obligor, whether or not such claim, remedy or right arises in equity or under contract, statute or common law, including, without limitation, the right to take or receive from any Borrower or any other Obligor, directly or indirectly, in cash or other property or by set-off or in any other manner, payment or security on account of such claim, remedy or right, unless and until all of the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty shall have been paid in full in cash and the Commitments shall have expired or been terminated. If any amount shall be paid to any Guarantor in violation of the immediately preceding sentence at any time prior to the latest of (a) the payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty and (b) the Maturity Date, such amount shall be received and held in trust for the benefit of the Agent and the Lenders, shall be segregated from other property and funds of such Guarantor and shall forthwith be paid or delivered to the Agent in the same form as so received (with any necessary endorsement or assignment) to be credited and applied to the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents, or to be held as Collateral for any Guaranteed Obligations or other amounts payable under this Guaranty thereafter arising. If (i) any Guarantor shall make payment to the Agent of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations, (ii) all of the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty shall have been paid in full in cash and (iii) the Maturity Date shall have occurred, the Agent and the Lenders will, at such Guarantor's request and expense, execute and deliver to such Guarantor appropriate documents, without recourse and without representation or warranty, necessary to evidence the transfer by subrogation to such Guarantor of an interest in the Guaranteed Obligations resulting from such payment made by such Guarantor pursuant to this Guaranty.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*236</span> Section 12.5 Guaranty Supplements.

No Guarantor shall have the right to assign its rights hereunder or any interest herein or delegate any of its duties, liabilities or obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document without the prior written consent of the Majority Lenders.</p>\n<p>Section 12.7 Limitation on Guaranty. Notwithstanding any provision of this Guaranty to the contrary, it is intended that this Guaranty, and any Liens granted hereunder by each Guarantor to secure the obligations and liabilities arising pursuant to this Guaranty, not constitute a \"Fraudulent Conveyance\" (as defined below). Consequently, each Guarantor agrees that if this Guaranty, or any Liens securing the obligations and liabilities arising pursuant to this Guaranty, would, but for the application of this sentence, constitute a Fraudulent Conveyance, this Guaranty and each such Lien shall be valid and enforceable only to the maximum extent that would not cause this Guaranty or such Lien to constitute a Fraudulent Conveyance, and this Guaranty shall automatically be deemed to have been amended accordingly at all relevant times. For purposes hereof, \"Fraudulent Conveyance\" means a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer applicable under Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code or any fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer under the provisions of any applicable fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer law or similar law of any state, nation or other governmental unit, as in effect from time to time.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*237</span> ARTICLE 13</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>AMENDMENTS; WAIVERS; PARTICIPATIONS; ASSIGNMENTS; SUCCESSORS</h2>\n<p>Section 13.1 No Waivers; Cumulative Remedies. No failure by the Agent or any Lender to exercise any right, remedy, or option under this Agreement, or in any other agreement between or among any Obligor and the Agent and/or any Lender, or delay by the Agent or any Lender in exercising the same, will operate as a waiver thereof. No waiver by the Agent or the Lenders on any occasion shall affect or diminish the Agent's and each Lender's rights thereafter to require strict performance by any Obligor of any provision of this Agreement. The Agent's and each Lender's rights will be cumulative and not exclusive of any other right or remedy.</p>\n<p>Section 13.2 Amendments and Waivers. No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, and no consent with respect to any departure by any Obligor therefrom, shall be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Majority Lenders (or by the Agent at the written consent of the Majority Lenders) and the Obligors and then any such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given, provided that no such waiver, amendment, or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by all the affected Lenders, do any of the following:</p>\n<blockquote>(a) increase or extend the Commitment of any Lender;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(b) postpone or delay any date fixed by this Agreement or any other Loan Document for any payment of principal, interest or fees;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(c) reduce the principal of, or the rate of interest specified herein on, the Term Loan or reduce any fees payable hereunder or under any other Loan Document;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(d) amend this Section;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(e) release all or substantially all of the Collateral or all or substantially all of the value of the Guarantees under Article 12;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(f) change the definition of Majority Lenders;

provided that the Obligors and the Agent may continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with the interest so assigned to an Assignee until (x) written notice of such assignment, together with payment instructions, addresses, and related information with respect to the Assignee, shall have been given to the General Partner and the Agent by such Lender and the Assignee; and (y) such Lender and its Assignee shall have delivered to the Agent an Assignment and Acceptance in a form reasonably acceptable to the Agent (\"Assignment and Acceptance\") together with any Term Note or Term Notes subject to such assignment and a recordation fee (payable by such Lender or such Assignee) of $3,500.</p>\n<p>(b) From and after the date that the Agent notifies the assignor Lender that it has received an executed Assignment and Acceptance, (i) the Assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent that rights and obligations have been assigned to it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, shall have the rights and obligations of a Lender under the Loan Documents (including the obligations pursuant to Schedule 3.1-A and Schedule 3.1-B), and (ii) the assignor Lender shall, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents have been assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, relinquish its rights and be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all or the remaining portion of an assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto).</p>\n<p>(c) By executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance, the assigning Lender thereunder and the Assignee thereunder confirm to and agree with each other and the other parties hereto as follows: (i) other than as provided in such Assignment and Acceptance, such assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to any statements, warranties, or representations made in or in connection with this Agreement or the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency, or value of this Agreement or any other Loan Document furnished pursuant hereto or the attachment, perfection, or priority of any Lien granted by any Obligor to the Agent or any Lender in the Collateral; (ii) such assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to the financial condition of any Obligor or the performance or observance by any Obligor of any of its obligations under this Agreement or any other Loan Document furnished pursuant hereto; (iii) such Assignee confirms that it has received a copy of this Agreement, together with such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into such Assignment and Acceptance; (iv) such Assignee will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent, such assigning Lender or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement; (v) such Assignee appoints and authorizes the Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement as are delegated to the Agent by the terms hereof, together with such powers, including the discretionary rights and incidental power, as are reasonably incidental thereto;

The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, in the absence of manifest error, and the Borrowers, the Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as the owner of the Term Loan and any Term Notes evidencing such Term Loan recorded therein for all purposes of this Agreement. Any assignment of any Term Loan, whether or not evidenced by a Term Note, shall be effective only upon appropriate entries with respect thereto being made in the Register. Any assignment of all or part of a Term Loan evidenced by a Term Note shall be registered on the Register only upon surrender for registration of assignment of the Term Note evidencing such Term Loan, accompanied by a duly executed Assignment and Acceptance; thereupon one or more new Term Notes in the same aggregate principal amount shall be issued to the assigning Lender and/or the designated Eligible Assignee (as applicable), and the old Term Notes shall be returned by the Agent to the Borrowers marked \"canceled.\" The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrowers or any Lender (with respect to any entry relating to such Lender's Term Loan) at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. The Register shall be treated, solely for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 5f. 103-1(c) (which relates to whether an obligation is in registered form for purposes of claiming exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code with respect to payments of \"portfolio interest\" received by a Non-U.S. Lender), as being maintained by the Agent as agent for the Borrowers; provided that the Agent shall have no duty or obligation whatsoever to or for the benefit of the Borrowers in connection with such matter.</p>\n<p>(e) Immediately upon satisfaction of the requirements of Section 13.3(a) and Section 13.3(d), this Agreement shall be deemed to be amended to the extent, but only to the extent, necessary to reflect the addition of the Assignee and the resulting adjustment of the Commitments arising therefrom. The Commitment allocated to each Assignee shall reduce such Commitments of the assigning Lender pro tanto.</p>\n<p>(f) Any Lender may at any time sell to one or more commercial banks, financial institutions, or other Persons (a \"Participant\") participating interests in any Term Loan, the Commitment of that Lender, and the other interests of that Lender (the \"originating Lender\") hereunder and under the other Loan Documents; provided that (i) the originating Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged (including the obligations pursuant to Schedule 3.1-A and Schedule 3.1-B), (ii) the originating Lender shall remain solely responsible for the performance of such obligations, (iii) the Obligors and the Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with the originating Lender in connection with the originating Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, (iv) no Lender shall transfer or grant any participating interest under which the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*240</span> Participant has rights to approve any amendment to, or any consent or waiver with respect to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (v) all amounts payable by the Obligors hereunder shall be determined as if such Lender had not sold such participation, and (vi) at any time on or prior to the Maturity Date, no Disqualified Lender may, without the Borrowers' prior written consent, be a Participant unless the maturity of the Term Loan has been accelerated; except that, if amounts outstanding under this Agreement shall have been declared or shall have become due and payable upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, each Participant shall be deemed to have the right of set-off in respect of its participating interest in amounts owing under this Agreement to the same extent and subject to the same limitation as if the amount of its participating interest were owing directly to it as a Lender under this Agreement.</p>\n<p>(g) In the event that any Lender sells participations in a Term Loan, such Lender shall, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrowers, maintain, or cause to be maintained, a register, on which it enters the name of all Participants in the Term Loan held by it and the principal amount (and stated interest thereon) of the portion of the Term Loan that is the subject of the participation (the \"Participant Register\"). A Term Loan (and the note, if any, evidencing the same) may be participated in whole or in part only by registration of such participation on the Participant Register. Any participation of such Term Loan (and the note, if any, evidencing the same) may be effected only by the registration of such participation on the Participant Register. The Participant Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrowers and any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. The Participant Register shall be treated, solely for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 5f.103-1(c) (which relates to whether an obligation is in registered form for purposes of claiming exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code with respect to payments of \"portfolio interest\" received by a Non-U.S. Lender), as being maintained by the applicable Lender as agent for the Borrowers; provided that such Lender shall have no duty or obligation whatsoever to or for the benefit of the Borrowers in connection with such matter.</p>\n<p>(h) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, any Lender may at any time create a security interest in, or pledge, all or any portion of its rights under and interest in this Agreement in favor of any Federal Reserve Bank, in accordance with Regulation A of the Federal Reserve Board or U.S. Treasury Regulation 31 CFR §203.14, or any Federal Home Loan Bank, and such Federal Reserve Bank and/or Federal Home Loan Bank may enforce such pledge or security interest in any manner permitted under applicable law.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>ARTICLE 14</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>THE AGENT</h2>\n<p>Section 14.1 Appointment and Authorization. Each Lender hereby designates and appoints the Agent as its agent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and each Lender hereby irrevocably authorizes the Agent to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and each other Loan Document and to exercise such powers and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*241</span> perform such duties as are expressly delegated to it by the terms of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The Agent agrees to act as such on the express conditions contained in this Article 14. The provisions of this Article 14 are solely for the benefit of the Agent and the Lenders and no Obligor shall have rights as a third party beneficiary of any of the provisions contained herein other than with respect to Section 14.9, Section 14.10 and Section 14.11. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained elsewhere in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document, the Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, nor shall the Agent have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Lender, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations, or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist against the Agent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, the use of the term \"agent\" in this Agreement with reference to the Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law. Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between independent contracting parties. Except as expressly otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Agent shall have and may use its sole discretion with respect to exercising or refraining from exercising any discretionary rights or taking or refraining from taking any actions which the Agent is expressly entitled to take or assert under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, including the exercise of rights and remedies pursuant to Section 11.2, and any action so taken or not taken shall be deemed consented to by the Lenders.</p>\n<p>Section 14.2 Delegation of Duties. The Agent may execute any of its duties under this Agreement or any other Loan Document by or through agents, sub-agents, employees, or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. The Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agent, sub-agent, employee, or attorney-in-fact that it selects as long as such selection was made without gross negligence or willful misconduct.</p>\n<p>Section 14.3 Liability of the Agent. None of the Agent-Related Persons shall (a) be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by any of them under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the transactions contemplated hereby (except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct), or (b) be responsible in any manner to any of the Lenders for any recital, statement, representation, or warranty made by any Obligor or any Affiliate of any Obligor, or any officer thereof, contained in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document, or in any certificate, report, statement, or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by the Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or the validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability, or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or for any failure of any Obligor to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder. No Agent-Related Person shall be under any obligation to any Lender to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or to inspect the properties, books, or records of any Obligor or any Affiliate of any Obligor. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*242</span> Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no Agent-Related Person: (i) shall have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Majority Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents); <i>provided</i> that such Agent-Related Person shall not be required to take any action that, in its judgment or the judgment of its counsel, may expose such Person to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable Requirements of Law; and (ii) shall, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to Borrowers or any of their Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the person serving as Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Section 14.4 Reliance by the Agent.</h2>\n<p>(a) The Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram, facsimile, telex, or telephone message, statement, or other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent, or made by the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including, without limitation, counsel to the Obligors), independent accountants, and other experts selected by the Agent. The Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Majority Lenders as it deems appropriate and, if it so requests, it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement or any other Loan Document in accordance with a request or consent of the Majority Lenders (or all Lenders if so required by the terms of this Agreement) and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all of the Lenders.</p>\n<p>(b) For purposes of determining compliance with the conditions specified in Section 10.1, each Lender that has executed this Agreement shall be deemed to have consented to, approved, or accepted or to be satisfied with, each document or other matter either sent by the Agent to such Lender for consent, approval, acceptance, or satisfaction, or required thereunder to be consented to or approved by or acceptable or satisfactory to such Lender.</p>\n<p>Section 14.5 Notice of Default. The Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, unless the Agent shall have received written notice from a Lender or an Obligor referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a \"notice of default.\" The Agent will notify the Lenders of its receipt of any such notice. The Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as may be requested by the Majority Lenders in accordance with Article 11; provided that unless and until the Agent has received any such <span class=\"star-pagination\">*243</span> request, the Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable.</p>\n<p>Section 14.6 Credit Decision. Each Lender acknowledges that none of the Agent-Related Persons has made any representation or warranty to it, and that no act by the Agent hereinafter taken, including any review of the affairs of the Obligors and their Affiliates, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by any Agent-Related Person to any Lender. Each Lender represents to the Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition, and creditworthiness of the Obligors and their Affiliates, and all applicable bank regulatory laws relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, and made its own decision to enter into this Agreement and to extend credit to the Obligors. Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals, and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make such investigations as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition, and creditworthiness of the Obligors. Except for notices, reports, and other documents expressly herein required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Agent, the Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition, or creditworthiness of the Obligors which may come into the possession of any of the Agent-Related Persons.</p>\n<p>Section 14.7 Indemnification. WHETHER OR NOT THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY ARE CONSUMMATED, THE LENDERS SHALL INDEMNIFY UPON DEMAND THE AGENT-RELATED PERSONS (TO THE EXTENT NOT REIMBURSED BY OR ON BEHALF OF THE OBLIGORS AND WITHOUT LIMITING THE OBLIGATION OF THE OBLIGORS TO DO SO), PRO RATA, FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL INDEMNIFIED LIABILITIES AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED IN SECTION 15.10; PROVIDED THAT NO LENDER SHALL BE LIABLE FOR THE PAYMENT TO THE AGENT-RELATED PERSONS OF ANY PORTION OF SUCH INDEMNIFIED LIABILITIES RESULTING SOLELY FROM SUCH PERSON'S GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT WITHOUT LIMITATION OF THE FOREGOING, EACH LENDER SHALL REIMBURSE THE AGENT UPON DEMAND FOR ITS RATABLE SHARE OF ANY COSTS OR OUT-OF-POCKET EXPENSES (INCLUDING COSTS AND EXPENSES SET FORTH IN SECTION 15.6) INCURRED BY THE AGENT IN CONNECTION WITH THE PREPARATION, EXECUTION, DELIVERY, ADMINISTRATION, MODIFICATION, AMENDMENT, OR ENFORCEMENT (WHETHER THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS, LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, OR OTHERWISE) OF, OR LEGAL ADVICE IN RESPECT OF RIGHTS OR RESPONSIBILITIES UNDER, THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT, OR ANY DOCUMENT CONTEMPLATED BY OR REFERRED TO HEREIN, TO THE EXTENT THAT THE AGENT IS NOT REIMBURSED FOR SUCH EXPENSES BY OR ON BEHALF OF THE OBLIGORS THE UNDERTAKING IN THIS SECTION SHALL SURVIVE THE <span class=\"star-pagination\">*244</span> PAYMENT OF ALL OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER AND THE RESIGNATION OR REPLACEMENT OF THE AGENT.</p>\n<p>Section 14.8 The Agent in Individual Capacity. The Agent and its Affiliates may make loans to, issue letters of credit for the account of, accept deposits from, acquire equity interests in and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust, financial advisory, underwriting, or other business with the Obligors and their Affiliates as though it were not the Agent hereunder and without notice to or consent of the Lenders. The Lenders acknowledge that, pursuant to such activities, the Agent or its Affiliates may receive information regarding the Obligors or their Affiliates (including information that may be subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of the Obligors or such Affiliates) and acknowledge that the Agent shall be under no obligation to provide such information to them. With respect to its Term Loan, the Agent as a Lender shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Agent, and the terms \"Lender\" and \"Lenders\" include the Agent in its individual capacity as a Lender hereunder.</p>\n<p>Section 14.9 Successor Agent. The Agent may resign as the Agent upon 30 days notice to the Lenders and the Borrowers, such resignation to be effective, subject to the next succeeding paragraph of this Section 14.9, upon the acceptance of a successor agent to its appointment as Agent. If the Agent resigns under this Agreement, the Majority Lenders shall, with the consent of the General Partner if the Term Loan has not been accelerated (which consent may be withheld in it's sole and absolute discretion), appoint from among the Lenders a successor agent for the Lenders. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as successor agent hereunder, such successor agent shall succeed to all the rights, powers, and duties of the retiring Agent and the term \"Agent\" shall mean such successor agent and the retiring Agent's appointment, powers, and duties as the Agent shall be terminated. After any retiring Agent's resignation hereunder as Agent, the provisions of this Section 14.9 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was the Agent under this Agreement.</p>\n<p>If no such successor Agent shall have been so appointed by the Majority Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Agent may on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above provided that if the Agent shall notify Borrower and the Lenders that no qualifying Person has accepted such appointment, then such resignation shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice and (1) the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (except that in the case of any Collateral held by the Agent on behalf of the Lenders under any of the Loan Documents, the retiring Agent shall continue to hold such Collateral as nominee until such time as a successor Agent is appointed) and (2) all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through an Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender directly, until such time as the Majority Lenders appoint a successor Agent as provided for above in this Section 14.9.</p>\n<p>After the retiring Agent's resignation hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article 14 and Section 15.10 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such <span class=\"star-pagination\">*245</span> retiring Agent and its sub-agents in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring Agent was acting as Agent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Section 14.10 Withholding Tax</h2>\n<p>(a) Each of the Lenders and the Agent shall provide in favor of the Obligors and the Agent the following forms:</p>\n<blockquote>(i) Each Non-U.S. Lender shall deliver to the Borrowers and the Agent either (i) two copies of either U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN (claiming exemption from, or a reduction of, U.S. withholding tax under an income tax treaty), Form W-8ECI (claiming exemption from U.S. withholding tax because the income is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business) or Form W-8IMY including any required statements and Forms W-8BEN and W-8ECI, or any subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto, as applicable, or (ii) in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender entitled to an exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code with respect to payments of \"portfolio interest,\" two copies of Form W-8BEN (certifying that such Non-U.S. Lender is a beneficial owner of the Term Loan), Form W-8IMY including any required statements and Forms W-8BEN and W-8ECI or any subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto, and a certificate satisfactory to the Agent and the General Partner that such Non-U.S. Lender Party is not (1) a \"bank\" within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (2) a \"10 percent shareholder\" of the General Partner within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code or (3) a \"controlled foreign corporation\" described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code.

Such forms shall be delivered by each Non-U.S. Lender prior to the date of the first payment by the Borrower hereunder made to such Non-U.S. Lender and on or before the date, if any, that such Non-U.S. Lender designates a New Lending Office. In addition, each Non-U.S. Lender shall deliver such forms promptly upon the obsolescence or invalidity of any form previously delivered by such Non-U.S. Lender or as reasonably requested from time to time by the General Partner or the Agent. Each Non-U.S. Lender shall promptly notify the General Partner and the Agent at any time it determines that it is no longer in a position to provide any previously delivered form, statement, or certificate to the Borrowers or the Agent (or any other form, statement, or form of certification adopted by the IRS for such purpose). Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph, a Non-U.S. Lender shall not be required to deliver any form pursuant to this paragraph that such Non-U.S. Lender is not legally able to deliver.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(ii) Each U.S. Lender shall deliver to the Borrowers and the Agent two copies of U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-9, or any subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto, properly completed and duly executed by such U.S. Lender certifying that such U.S. Lender is entitled to an exemption from United States backup withholding tax on all payments by the Borrowers under this Agreement and the other <span class=\"star-pagination\">*246</span> Loan Documents. Such forms shall be delivered by each U.S. Lender on or before the date it becomes a party to this Agreement.

The Lenders hereby irrevocably authorize the Agent, at the request of the General Partner, to subordinate any Agent's Lien to the holder of any Lien described in clauses (b), (d), (f), (j) (if and to the extent applicable), (m), (o), (p), (s), (t), and (v) of the definition of Permitted Liens; in each case to the extent the underlying transaction is not prohibited hereby.</p>\n<p>(b) Upon receipt by the Agent of any authorization required pursuant to Section 14.11(a) to release any Agent's Liens upon particular types or items of Collateral, and upon at least two Business Days prior written request (or such shorter time period as the Agent may agree) by the General Partner, the Agent shall (and is hereby irrevocably authorized by the Lenders to) execute such documents as may be necessary to evidence the release of the Agent's Liens upon such Collateral; provided that (i) the Agent shall not be required to execute any such document on terms which, in the Agent's good-faith opinion, would expose the Agent to liability or create any material obligation or entail any material adverse consequence other than the release of such Liens without recourse or warranty, and (ii) such release shall not in any manner discharge, affect, or impair the Obligations or any Liens (other than those expressly being released) upon (or obligations of the Obligors in respect of) all interests retained by any Obligor, including the proceeds of any sale, all of which shall continue to constitute part of the Collateral.</p>\n<p>(c) The Agent shall have no obligation whatsoever to any of the Lenders to assure that the Collateral exists or is owned by any Obligor or is cared for, protected, or insured or has been encumbered, or that the Agent's Liens have been properly or sufficiently or lawfully created, perfected, protected, or enforced or are entitled to any particular priority, or to exercise at all or in any particular manner or under any duty of care, disclosure, or fidelity, or to continue exercising, any of the rights, authorities, and powers granted or available to the Agent pursuant to any of the Loan Documents, it being understood and agreed that in respect of the Collateral, or any act, omission, or event related thereto, the Agent may act in any manner it may deem appropriate, in its sole discretion given the Agent's own interest in the Collateral in its capacity as one of the Lenders and that the Agent shall have no other duty or liability whatsoever to any Lender as to any of the foregoing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Section 14.12 Restrictions on Actions by the Lenders; Sharing of Payments.</h2>\n<p>(a) Each Lender hereby waives any and all rights to set-off against the Obligations, any amounts owing by such Lender to any Obligor or any accounts unrelated to the Term Loan of any Obligor now or hereafter maintained with such Lender.

The General Partner (on its own behalf and on behalf of the other Borrower) shall have the right by delivering written notice to the Lenders no later than the earlier of (x) the date that is 45 days prior to the Maturity Date, (y) the time of the approval by the Bankruptcy Court of a disclosure statement for the POR and (z) the date an order is entered approving a Qualified Backstop Party in connection with a potential Qualified Rights Offering, to elect (which election shall be irrevocable unless (i) otherwise consented to by all Lenders or (ii) the POR with respect to which such election applies is not approved by the Bankruptcy Court) to pay on the Plan Date (a) all or a portion of the sum of (i) the outstanding principal amount of the Term Loan, (ii) accrued and unpaid interest due and owing on the Plan Date and (iii) the Exit Fee then due and payable by issuing to the Lenders the Conversion Shares; <i>provided, however,</i> that in no event shall such conversion result in the Lenders' receipt in the aggregate of Common Stock in connection herewith equaling more than (A) 8.0% (on a Fully-Distributed Basis) of the aggregate amount of Common Stock distributed in connection with the POR or (B) 9.9% of the aggregate amount of Common Stock actually distributed in connection with the POR on the Plan Date (without giving effect to any Common Stock the distribution of which is subject to any contingency, holdback or other similar arrangement) (herein, the <i>\"Maximum Conversion Shares\");</i> and/or (b) all or a portion of the outstanding principal amount of the Term Loan by issuing to the Lenders conversion debt. Notwithstanding the prior language, the General Partner shall have the right to withdraw its conversion election made in accordance with (z) above, or if (y) and (z) occur substantially concurrently, (y) and (z), and such election shall be of no further force and effect, if the General Partner determines that the rights offering contemplated by clause (z) in the first sentence is not, or is unlikely to be, a Qualified Rights Offering.</p>\n<p>2. The right of the General Partner to make the election and effect the conversion described in <i>paragraph 1</i> above is subject to all of the following conditions precedent having been satisfied on the Plan Date (except if and to the extent that any such condition has been expressly waived in writing by the Majority Lenders):</p>\n<p>a. There is no continuing Event of Default;</p>\n<p>b. In the case of conversion of any portion of the Term Loan to Conversion Shares, and only in such case, the Common Stock is, or all necessary and appropriate actions have been taken, including receipt of approval for listing, such that the Common Stock will be, within five Business Days after the Plan Date, quoted on the New York Stock Exchange or The NASDAQ Global Market;</p>\n<p>c. The Plan Date occurs within 24 months of the date hereof;</p>\n<p>d. The General Partner and its direct and indirect consolidated subsidiaries (<i>\"Consolidated GGP\"</i>) shall not have divested assets (after giving effect to transactions contemplated to be made in the POR, and including foreclosures after the commencement of the Case) that generated more than 20% of the net operating <span class=\"star-pagination\">*272</span> income of Consolidated GGP in its fiscal year 2008;</p>\n<p>e. The Exit Fee then due and payable shall have been paid in full at or prior to the time of such conversion; and</p>\n<p>f. In the case of conversion of all or any portion of the Term Loan to conversion debt, and only in such case, conversion debt shall have the following terms: (i) principal amount shall be less than or equal to six times the last twelve months net operating income of real property on which the Lenders have a first lien (<i>\"First Lien Properties\"</i>), provided that no tenant shall represent greater than 10% of the aggregate rent of the First Lien Properties in the last twelve months; (ii) collateral shall be comprised of the first mortgage liens on the First Lien Properties and related personal property, Borrowers' wholly-owned land and a lien on the Borrowers' cash collateral account; (iii) interest rate and other economic terms shall be the same as the Term Loan, provided that the Borrowers shall not be required to pay an origination, commitment, extension, exit or other comparable or substitute fee, or any prepayment premium, penalty or fee; (iv) non-economic terms of the conversion debt shall be substantially similar to the terms of the Term Loan provided that the bankruptcy concepts shall be generally removed and, in the case of the Subsidiaries owning the First Lien Properties, there shall be no or minimal baskets for indebtedness, liens and asset sales; (v) the General Partner and Lenders shall negotiate loan conversion documents in good faith; and (vi) Borrowers' direct parent and subsidiaries shall provide guarantees reasonably satisfactory to the Lenders that carve out all of the Negative Pledge Debtors, provided that such Persons grant no guarantees to other creditors.</p>\n<p>3. If and to the extent there is a Value Differential, the General Partner shall be obligated to pay an amount in cash and/or Common Stock (<i>\"Value Differential Shares\"</i>), at the General Partner's election, ratably to the Lenders, equal to such Value Differential. The General Partner shall make its election as to the form of consideration in which it intends to pay the Value Differential, if any, and publicly announce the same by filing (or furnishing) a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission, no later than the open of trading on the third Trading Day preceding the Value Differential Valuation Period (indicating its election and the percentages, if any, of the Value Differential to be paid in cash and through the issuance of Value Differential Shares). That portion of the Value Differential, if any, payable in cash shall be paid not later than 30 calendar days following the Trading Valuation Date. The number of Value Differential Shares issuable in respect of that portion of the Value Differential, if any, payable in Value Differential Shares shall be determined on the seventh Trading Day following the Trading Valuation Date, subsequent to market close on such date, and such Value Differential Shares shall be issued no later than 10:00 AM Eastern Time on the tenth Trading Day following the Trading Valuation Date. The number of Value Differential Shares issuable shall be determined by dividing (x) the dollar amount of the Value Differential payable in Value Differential Shares by (y) the product of (i) 97.0% multiplied by (ii) the average of each Trading Day's volume-weighted average price with respect to trading of the Common Stock during normal trading hours (9:30 AM to 4:00 PM Eastern Time) for the period beginning on the first Trading Day following the Trading Valuation Date and ending on the seventh <span class=\"star-pagination\">*273</span> Trading Day following the Trading Valuation Date. If payment of the Value Differential is not made in full when due, any amount not paid on such date shall be overdue and shall bear interest at the Default Rate from such payment date to the date payment is made (it being understood that the foregoing shall not in any way be construed as a limitation on any legal remedies to which the Lenders may be entitled as a result of any failure by the General Partner to pay the Value Differential when due). No Value Differential Shares shall be issuable to any Lender, and no Lender shall have any right to receive Value Differential Shares, to the extent that the issuance or potential issuance thereof would result in such Lender beneficially owning (within the meaning of Section 13(d) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) more than 9.9% of the Common Stock; provided, however, that no Lender shall be deemed to beneficially own more than 9.9% of the Common Stock due to a group, trust, account, agreement, or other arrangement, implicit or explicit, with any other Lender solely as a result of any relationship created by this <i>Schedule 3.1-A</i> unless such Lenders reasonably conclude, based on advice of counsel, that such Lenders are or would be a group (within the meaning of Section 13(d) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) with respect to the Common Stock and that such Lenders could, depending on the number of Value Differential Shares issuable, be required to disclose on a Schedule 13D that each such Lender beneficially owns more than 9.9% of the Common Stock as a result of receiving Value Differential Shares. To the extent any Lender is precluded from receiving Value Differential Shares to which it would be entitled but for the restriction set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, such Lender shall be entitled to receive cash in lieu of any Value Differential Shares that would otherwise have been issuable but for such restriction. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no payment shall be made in respect of a Value Differential if a Qualified Rights Offering has been made. If there is no Qualified Rights Offering, then no Lender shall, during the Value Differential Valuation Period, sell, assign or dispose of Common Stock or Common Stock derivatives in an amount greater than 10.0% of such Lender's Conversion Shares on any one Trading Day.</p>\n<p>4. The General Partner shall take all necessary and appropriate measures to cause the Conversion Shares and any Value Differential Shares to be freely tradable, upon issuance to the Lenders, without registration (<i>e.g.,</i> pursuant to Section 1145 of the Bankruptcy Code). If and to the extent the Majority Lenders determine in good faith that Conversion Shares and/or any Value Differential Shares will or may not be freely tradable, upon issuance to the Lenders, without registration, the General Partner covenants and agrees that following written notification by the Majority Lenders to the General Partner of such determination no later than 30 Business Days after the Plan Date (such date, the <i>\"Request Date\"</i>), the General Partner shall, at its expense, prepare and file with the Securities and Exchange Commission a registration statement on Form S-3, if available (or, if not available, on Form S-1 or another appropriate form), covering the shares of Common Stock of the Lenders received by such Lenders as a result of the conversion described in <i>paragraph 1(a)</i> hereof and any Value Differential Shares that may be issuable in satisfaction of the Value Differential (collectively, the <i>\"Registrable Shares\"</i>), and, to the extent the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*274</span> registration statement has not theretofore been declared effective or is not automatically effective upon such filing, the General Partner shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to be declared or become effective as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than 180 days after the Request Date, and will use commercially reasonable efforts to keep such registration statement effective and usable for the resale of such Registrable Shares from the date of its initial effectiveness until such time as all Registrable Shares have been sold pursuant to the registration statement or all remaining Registrable Shares may otherwise be freely resold under the Securities Act without limitation or restriction. The registration contemplated by this <i>paragraph 4</i> shall be effected only once. The registration rights contemplated by this <i>paragraph 4</i> shall be effected pursuant to the terms of <i>Schedule 3.1-B.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Defined Terms:</i></h2>\n<p><i>\"Common Stock\"</i> means the common stock of the General Partner.</p>\n<p><i>\"Common Stock Equivalent\"</i> means any security or instrument that (i) directly or indirectly is convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock, (ii) by its terms is expressly linked to the price or performance of the Common Stock or (iii) by its terms expressly participates in dividends or distributions in respect of, or votes as a class with, the Common Stock; <i>provided, however,</i> that \"Common Stock Equivalent\" excludes (a) any security or instrument issued in the ordinary course of business pursuant to board approved employee benefits plans of the General Partner (an <i>\"Employee Benefits Plan\"</i>) or any other option, warrant or other security or instrument issued or issuable in the ordinary course of business to employees, officers or directors of the General Partner pursuant to a General Partner board-approved incentive, retention, benefit or similar compensation plan and (b) any rights issued pursuant to the General Partner's shareholder rights plan (provided such rights have not separated from the Common Stock and no triggering event under the rights plan has occurred).</p>\n<p><i>\"Conversion Amount\"</i> means the sum of (i) the outstanding principal of the Term Loan, (ii) accrued and unpaid interest due and owing on the Plan Date and (iii) the Exit Fee then due and payable that is repaid by the issuance of shares of Common Stock on the Maturity Date in accordance with this <i>Schedule 3.1-A.</i></p>\n<p><i>\"Conversion Shares\"</i> means that number of shares of Common Stock determined by dividing the Conversion Amount, stated in U.S. dollars, by the lowest of (i) the value of one share of Common Stock based on the value attributable to one such share in the POR, (ii) the lowest net price per share received from any other purchaser of Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents in connection with the POR (other than as a result of settling Claims, and provided that any reinstatement or reaffirmation of any Common Stock or Common Stock equivalents of the General Partner in conjunction with the POR shall be treated as an issuance at the lesser of the POR or market value), whether by public offering, private placement, or pursuant to a rights offering to the pre-petition stakeholders of the General Partner in connection with the POR, and (iii) the lowest net price per share received by the General Partner from any issuance of Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents to any unaffiliated third party for cash or in exchange for assets in connection with the POR (other than Claims) <span class=\"star-pagination\">*275</span> (such lowest price, which may be the Qualified Rights Offering Price Per Share, the <i>\"Initial Conversion Price\"</i>). Any fractional share resulting from such calculation shall be paid in cash. For purposes of this definition and for purposes of the second sentence of the definition of \"Value Differential\" below, \"per share\" when used with respect to the issuance of any Common Stock Equivalents shall mean the price per share of Common Stock implied by such Common Stock Equivalent determined using a customary methodology agreed between the Majority Lenders and the General Partner; <i>provided</i> that, in the event that the Majority Lenders and the General Partner are unable to agree on such a methodology, each of the Majority Lenders and the General Partner shall select an independent valuation expert, and such independent valuation experts shall in turn jointly select a third independent valuation expert, who shall determine an appropriate valuation methodology and apply such methodology to determine the price per share.</p>\n<p><i>\"Fully-Distributed Basis\"</i> means, with respect to any class of Common Stock of the kind or class having power generally to vote in the election of directors, the Common Stock that would be distributed after giving effect to the distribution of all Plan Distributable Securities.</p>\n<p><i>\"Plan Distributable Securities\"</i> means all Common Stock and all Common Stock Equivalents (including any Common Stock and Common Stock Equivalents of the General Partner that are reinstated or reaffirmed in conjunction with the POR) which will be exercised or exchanged or otherwise converted to Common Stock prior to or concurrently with distribution of such security under the POR with respect to which an entitlement to distribution exists under the POR (whether or not such entitlement is subject to contingency, holdback or other similar arrangement).</p>\n<p><i>\"POR\"</i> means the plan of reorganization with respect to the Debtors as confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court.</p>\n<p><i>\"Qualified Backstop Party\"</i> means an independent third party that (i) is not an Affiliate of the General Partner, and (ii) does not beneficially own more than 15% of the voting stock including voting stock derivatives (including any swap or short sale) of the General Partner.</p>\n<p><i>\"Qualified Rights Offering\"</i> means a rights offering to pre-petition stakeholders of the General Partner and/or its Affiliates in connection with the POR that meets the following qualifications: (i) subscribed to be sold to at least 50 ultimate purchasers who are not affiliated with each other (or 25 ultimate purchasers who are not affiliated with each other if such rights offering is made solely to creditors of the General Partner debtors in their capacity as such); (ii) the offered shares shall be listed on the New York Stock Exchange or The NASDAQ Global Market within five Trading Days of completion of the rights offering; (iii) the issue size is at least three times the Conversion Amount; (iv) the rights offering is conducted by a nationally known financial advisor at a price representing a discount to POR reorganization value designed to achieve a fully subscribed offering at such price as may be determined by such nationally known financial advisor and a nationally known financial advisor selected by the Agent (acting at the direction of the Majority Lenders) (and, if such financial advisors are unable so to agree, such financial advisors shall select another nationally recognized financial advisor, which third financial advisor shall determine the amount of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*276</span> discount); and (v) if and to the extent applicable, the offered shares are priced with reference to the trading market for the Common Stock prior to the commencement of the rights offering. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Qualified Backstop Party agrees to a contractual backstop of at least 40% of the rights being offered in such rights offering meeting the criteria of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of this definition, such rights offering shall be deemed to be a Qualified Rights Offering for all purposes except that the Qualified Rights Offering Price Per Share in such case shall be deemed to be equal to the lowest price per share (which shall be calculated net of any fees and other payments made to such third party in connection with the backstop arrangements) of Common Stock obtained by the General Partner and/or its Affiliates in such Qualified Rights Offering from any Qualified Backstop Party or any other purchaser in such rights offering.</p>\n<p><i>\"Qualified Rights Offering Price Per Share\"</i> means the lower of (i) the lowest price per share (which shall be calculated net of any fees and other payments made to such third party in connection with the backstop arrangements) of Common Stock obtained by the General Partner and/or its Affiliates in a Qualified Rights Offering from any Qualified Backstop Party or any other purchaser in such rights offering and (ii) the POR reorganization value per share.</p>\n<p><i>\"Trading Day\"</i> means a trading day consisting of a full trading session with respect to which the Common Stock is registered under the Exchange Act and traded on the New York Stock Exchange or The NASDAQ Stock Market.</p>\n<p><i>\"Trading Valuation Date\"</i> means the fortieth Trading Day following confirmation of the POR.</p>\n<p><i>\"Value Differential\"</i> means the amount derived (if a positive number) by subtracting (i) the product of (A) the number of shares of Common Stock issued as Conversion Shares multiplied by (B) the lesser of (x) the average of each Trading Day's volume-weighted average price with respect to trading of the Common Stock during normal trading hours (9:30 AM to 4:00 PM Eastern Time) for the period (the <i>\"Value Differential Valuation Period\"</i>) beginning on the twentieth Trading Day following confirmation of the POR and ending on the fortieth Trading Day following confirmation of the POR and (y) the Subsequent Issuance Price (if any) (as defined below), from (ii) the product of (A) the number of shares of Common Stock issued as Conversion Shares multiplied by (B) the Initial Conversion Price.

To the extent the Registration Statement has not theretofore been declared effective or is not automatically effective upon such filing, the General Partner shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Registration Statement to be declared or become effective as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than 180 days after the Reg Rights Start Date, and the General Partner shall use commercially reasonable efforts to keep such Registration Statement effective and usable for the resale of such Registrable Securities from the date of its initial effectiveness until such time as all Registrable Securities have been sold pursuant to the Registration Statement or all remaining Registrable Securities may otherwise be freely resold under the Securities Act without limitation or restriction.</p>\n<p>(c) Any registration pursuant to this <i>Section 2.1</i> shall, to the extent possible, be effected by means of a shelf registration under the Securities Act (a <i>\"Shelf Registration Statement\"</i>) in accordance with the methods and distribution set forth in the Shelf Registration Statement and Rule 415.

If the General Partner notifies the Holders in accordance with <i>Section 2.3(f)(v)</i> to suspend the use of the Prospectus until the requisite changes to the Prospectus have been made, then the Holders and any underwriters shall suspend use of such Prospectus.</p>\n<p>(i) Use commercially reasonable efforts to procure the cooperation of the General Partner's transfer agent in settling any offering or sale of Registrable Securities, including with respect to the transfer of physical security instruments into book-entry form in accordance with any procedures reasonably requested by the Holders or any managing underwriter(s).</p>\n<p>(j) Use its commercially reasonable efforts to take such actions as are under its control to become or remain a well-known seasoned issuer (as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act) (and not become an ineligible issuer (as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act)) during the period when such Registration Statement remains in effect.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*282</span> (k) Enter into an underwriting agreement in form, scope and substance as is customarily entered into for similar underwritten offerings of equity securities by similar companies and take all such other actions reasonably requested by the Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities being sold in connection therewith or by the managing underwriter(s), if any, to expedite or facilitate the underwritten disposition of such Registrable Securities, and in connection therewith as customary for any similar underwritten offering, (i) make such representations and warranties to the Holders that are selling stockholders and the managing underwriter(s), if any, with respect to the business of the General Partner and its subsidiaries, and the Registration Statement, Prospectus and documents, if any, incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference therein, in each case, in form, substance and scope as are customarily made by the issuer in similar underwritten offerings of equity securities by similar companies, and, if true, confirm the same if and when requested, (ii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to furnish underwriters opinions of counsel to the General Partner, addressed to the managing underwriter(s), if any, covering the matters customarily covered in the opinions requested in similar underwritten offerings of equity securities by similar companies, (iii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain \"cold comfort\" letters from the independent certified public accountants of the General Partner (and, if necessary, any other independent certified public accountants of any business acquired by the General Partner for which financial statements and financial data are included in the Registration Statement) who have certified the financial statements included in such Registration Statement, addressed to each of the managing underwriter(s), if any, such letters to be in customary form and covering matters of the type customarily covered in \"cold comfort\" letters in connection with similar underwritten offerings of equity securities by similar companies, (iv) if an underwriting agreement is entered into, the same shall contain indemnification provisions and procedures customary in similar underwritten offerings of equity securities by similar companies, and (v) deliver such documents and certificates as may be reasonably requested by the Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities being sold in connection therewith, their counsel and the managing underwriter(s), if any, to evidence the continued validity of the representations and warranties made pursuant to clause (i) above and to evidence compliance with any customary conditions contained in the underwriting agreement or other agreement entered into by the General Partner.</p>\n<p>(<i>l</i>) Make available for inspection by a representative of Holders, the managing underwriter(s), if any, and any attorneys or accountants retained by such Holders or managing underwriter(s), at the offices where normally kept, during reasonable business hours, financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents and properties of the General Partner, and cause the officers, directors and employees of the General Partner to supply all information in each case reasonably requested by any such representative, managing underwriter(s), attorney or accountant in connection with such Registration Statement;

If it so elects, after receipt of such notice, an indemnifying party, jointly with any other indemnifying parties receiving such notice, may assume the defense of such action with counsel chosen by it (such counsel to be reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified parties), <i>provided</i> that the indemnified party shall be entitled to participate in (but not control) the defense of such action with counsel chosen by it, the fees and expenses of which shall be paid by the indemnifying party if the indemnifying party has reasonably concluded there would be a conflict if one counsel were to represent both the indemnified and the indemnifying party, and by the indemnified party in all other circumstances. In no event shall the indemnifying party or parties be liable for a settlement of an action with respect to which they have assumed the defense if such settlement is effected without the written consent of the indemnifying party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), or for the fees and expenses of more than (i) one counsel for the General Partner, its officer, directors and controlling Persons as a group, (ii) one counsel for the selling Holders and their controlling Persons as a group and (iii) one counsel for the underwriters or agents and their controlling Persons as a group, in each case, in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.</p>\n<p>(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this <i>Section 2.7</i> and <i>Section 2.8,</i> in no event will any (i) Holder be required to undertake liability to any person under <i>Section 2.7</i> or <i>Section 2.8</i> for any amounts in excess of the dollar amount of the proceeds to be received by such Holder from the sale of such Holder's Registrable Securities (after deducting any fees, discounts and commissions applicable thereto) pursuant <span class=\"star-pagination\">*286</span> to any Registration Statement under which such Registrable Securities are to be registered under the Securities Act and (ii) underwriter, selling agent or other securities professional be required to undertake liability to any person hereunder for any amounts in excess of the discount, commission or other compensation payable to such underwriter, selling agent or other securities professional with respect to the Registrable Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public.</p>\n<p>(f) The obligations of the General Partner under this <i>Section 2.7</i> and <i>Section 2.8</i> shall be in addition to any liability which the General Partner may otherwise have to any indemnified person and the obligations of any indemnified person under this <i>Section 2.7</i> and <i>Section 2.8</i> shall be in addition to any liability which such indemnified person may otherwise have to the General Partner. The remedies provided in this <i>Section 2.7</i> and <i>Section 2.8</i> are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to an indemnified party at law or in equity.</p>\n<p>(g) The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.</p>\n<p>2.8 <i>Contribution.</i> (a) If the indemnification provided for in <i>Section 2.7</i> is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under <i>Section 2.7(a)</i> or <i>Section 2.7(b)</i> above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of such indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by such indemnifying party or by such indemnified party, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this <i>Section 2.8</i> were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Holders or any underwriters, selling agents or other securities professionals or all of them were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this <i>Section 2.8(a).</i> The obligations of Holders and any underwriters, selling agents or other securities professionals in this <i>Section 2.8(a)</i> to contribute shall be several in proportion to the percentage of principal amount or number of shares, as applicable, of Registrable Securities registered or underwritten, as the case may be, by them and not joint.</p>\n<p>(b) No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be <span class=\"star-pagination\">*287</span> entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
