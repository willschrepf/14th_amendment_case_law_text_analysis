Jackson, an attorney who was disqualified by the\r\ntrial court from representing appellants Brian Charles Smith, Robert Hammond, David Talton, and\r\nJohn Collins, individually and on behalf of others similarly situated, appeared before this Court for\r\na show cause hearing related to his continued attempts to represent appellants.  Jackson argues that\r\nbecause no appellate court has explicitly ruled on the propriety of his disqualification, there has been\r\nno ruling on the merits and, therefore, he and appellants may appeal that disqualification.  We hold\r\nthat Jackson may not participate in this appeal in any capacity.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><strong>Factual Background</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tOn July 9, 2004, appellant Smith, represented by Jackson, filed a petition in the trial\r\ncourt, appealing from the suspension of his driver's license for non-payment of child support.  The\r\npetition was amended in September 2004 to add appellants Hammond, Talton, Collins, individually\r\nand on behalf of others similarly situated.  In February 2005, appellees Greg Abbott, Attorney\r\nGeneral of the State of Texas, and Cynthia Bryant, or her successor, as Director of Title IV-D\r\nAgency, filed a motion to disqualify Jackson, stating that Jackson was formerly employed as the\r\npresiding administrative law judge for the Child Support Division of the Attorney General's Office\r\n(\"OAG\") at the time appellants' licenses were suspended, that he had used confidential information\r\nobtained through that employment to solicit clients, including appellants, and that he had violated\r\nthe separation agreement he signed upon ending his employment with the OAG.  A hearing was held\r\non the motion on February 22, 2005, and the trial court granted appellees' motion on March 11,\r\n2005, ordering Jackson withdrawn as attorney of record in the case and ordering him to notify\r\nappellants of his withdrawal and of any pending deadlines.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tOn April 25, 2005, Jackson filed a petition for writ of mandamus on appellants'\r\nbehalf in this Court, signing the document as appellants' attorney and complaining of the trial court's\r\ndecision to disqualify him (cause number 03-05-00226-CV).  This Court denied the petition for writ\r\nof mandamus in May 2005.  Jackson then filed a petition for writ of mandamus on appellants' behalf\r\nwith the supreme court, signing it as appellants' attorney.  The supreme court denied the petition in\r\nAugust 2005, and he filed a motion for rehearing on appellants' behalf, which was denied in October\r\n2005 (cause number 05-0457).  On December 1, Jackson filed in the trial court a motion to reinstate\r\ncounsel or clarify its order, signing the motion as appellants' attorney.  The trial court denied that\r\nmotion on February 23, 2006, and on April 13, 2006, Jackson filed in this Court another petition for\r\nwrit of mandamus and an emergency motion to stay his disqualification pending resolution of his\r\npetition for writ of mandamus.  Those documents were brought in the names of Samuel T. Jackson\r\nand Brian C. Smith, et al., and Jackson signed them as attorney for relators (cause number 03-06-00209-CV).  This Court denied both the emergency motion and the petition on April 14.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tOn March 23, 2006, between the date the court overruled the motion to reconsider\r\nJackson's disqualification and the date Jackson filed his second petition for writ of mandamus, the\r\ntrial court granted appellees' plea to the jurisdiction and dismissed appellants' suit with prejudice. \r\nOn June 26, Jackson, still signing as appellants' attorney, filed a notice of appeal on appellants'\r\nbehalf and on his own behalf, stating that appellees and Jackson wished \"to appeal . . . from the\r\njudgment dismissing with prejudice their claims, entered . . . on March 23, 2006.\"  The OAG soon\r\nfiled a motion to dismiss the appeal based on Jackson's disqualification.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tThis Court ordered Jackson to appear at a show cause hearing on September 23, 2006. \r\nPrior to the hearing, Jackson filed a response asserting that: appeal from his disqualification was not\r\nprecluded by the \"law of the case\" doctrine; the appellate courts' denials of his petitions for writ of\r\nmandamus were not rulings on the merits of his disqualification; his disqualification does not\r\npreclude him from proceeding as appellants' attorney as to their claims against appellee the State\r\nOffice of Administrative Hearings (\"SOAH\"), which did not file a motion to disqualify;<sup> (1)</sup> Jackson\r\nis entitled to represent himself in an appeal from the disqualification; appellants should be allowed\r\nto properly perfect their appeal, should the disqualification be upheld; and appellants' and Jackson's\r\nright to appeal is constitutionally protected.  Following the show cause hearing, Jackson filed a letter\r\nbrief further asserting that this appeal may not be dismissed without a written decision, his\r\ndisqualification did not divest him of the authority to perfect the appeal, Jackson may challenge the\r\ndisqualification on his own behalf, and this Court must determine the propriety of the\r\ndisqualification before dismissing the appeal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><strong>Discussion</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tJackson was disqualified from acting as appellants' attorney in March 2005.  This\r\nCourt denied a petition for writ of mandamus complaining of that disqualification in May, and the\r\nsupreme court denied a similar petition in August and a motion for rehearing in October. \r\nNotwithstanding those decisions, Jackson filed a motion for reconsideration and then again sought\r\nmandamus relief, which this Court denied.  Despite having been disqualified more than a year earlier\r\nand repeatedly being denied relief from that disqualification, Jackson filed a notice of appeal on\r\nappellants' behalf, purporting to be appellants' attorney.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tJackson is correct that the supreme court has held that a denial of a petition for writ\r\nof mandamus does not amount to a decision on the merits of the case.  <em>See In re AIU Ins. Co.</em>, 148\r\nS.W.3d 109, 119 (Tex. 2004).  However, having been denied mandamus relief not once, but three\r\ntimes, Jackson may not proceed in the trial court as if the disqualification order is of no effect until\r\nit is ruled on through an appeal.  Unless stayed, a trial court's order must be given effect and is\r\npresumptively valid unless and until an appellate court reverses that order, either through an original\r\nproceeding or through an appeal.  Jackson did not obtain a stay from the disqualification order, and\r\nthe order did not limit his disqualification only to the claims involving the OAG.<sup> (2)</sup>  The trial court's\r\norder and the subsequent denials of extraordinary relief had the effect of disqualifying Jackson from\r\nfurther participation in the case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tJackson prepared and filed a \"joint notice of appeal\" in his and appellants' names,\r\nstating that they wished to appeal the trial court's March 23, 2006 judgment \"dismissing with\r\nprejudice their claims.\"  He argues that he is \"entitled to appeal from the disqualification <em>on his own\r\nbehalf</em>\" and that he has a right to challenge his disqualification on his own behalf, citing to several\r\ncases in an attempt to answer this Court's inquiry as to authority for his proposition.  However,\r\nseveral of the cases Jackson cites involve appeals brought by attorneys sanctioned in court orders for\r\nmisconduct.  <em>See Weeks v. Independent Sch. Dist. No. I-89</em>, 230 F.3d 1201, 1205, 1207 (10th Cir.\r\n2000) (attorney had standing to appeal disqualification order involving finding that attorney had\r\nviolated Oklahoma Rules of Professional Conduct); <em>United States v. Talao</em>, 222 F.3d 1133, 1136 (9th\r\nCir. 2000) (allowing attorney to appeal from trial court's finding of a violation of California Rules\r\nof Professional Conduct); <em>Walker v. City of Mesquite</em>, 129 F.3d 831, 832 (5th Cir. 1997) (trial court\r\nissued opinion finding attorney guilty of \"blatant misconduct\" and violating duty of candor; court\r\nof appeals held that attorney could appeal from order without waiting until end of litigation);\r\n<em>Sullivan v. Committee on Admissions &amp; Grievances</em>, 395 F.2d 954, 956 (D.C. Cir. 1967) (allowing\r\nattorney's appeal from trial court's determination that attorney \"was guilty of proscribed conduct\"). \r\nIn this case, Jackson has not been sanctioned.  Instead, in its order,  the trial court granted appellees'\r\nmotion to disqualify Jackson without comment.  Thus, Jackson has not shown that his professional\r\nreputation will be damaged if he is not allowed to appeal on his own behalf.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tAlthough Jackson cites several cases that he argues show that Texas courts allow\r\nattorneys to appeal from their disqualification, a review of Texas case law shows that Texas courts\r\ndiscuss <em>a party's right </em>to counsel of its choosing, not <em>an attorney's right </em>to a particular client. \r\nJackson cites to a case from our sister court in El Paso, in which the defendant and its law firm \"as\r\nan intervenor\" filed a joint notice of appeal.  <em>See Cimarron Agric., Ltd. v. Guitar Holding Co., L.P.</em>,\r\n209 S.W.3d 197, 202 n.2 (Tex. App.--El Paso 2006, no pet.) (emphasis added).  However, the court\r\nin <em>Cimarron</em> stated, \"Regardless of whether [the law firm] has standing individually, Cimarron does\r\nhave standing to assert the claims related to the trial court's disqualification order.\"  <em>Id</em>.  The court\r\ndid <em>not </em>address whether the law firm had a right to bring an appeal from its disqualification.  Our\r\nreview of the law related to disqualification reveals that complaints or appeals arising from such\r\norders are generally brought by the client-party, not by the disqualified attorney.  <em>See</em>, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>In re\r\nSanders</em>, 153 S.W.3d 54, 56 (Tex. 2004); <em>In re Nitla, S.A. de C.V.</em>, 92 S.W.3d 419, 421 (Tex. 2002);\r\n<em>Anderson Producing, Inc. v. Koch Oil Co.</em>, 929 S.W.2d 416, 418 (Tex. 1996);  <em>Spears v. Fourth\r\nCourt of Appeals</em>, 797 S.W.2d 654, 655 (Tex. 1990); <em>In re Budzyn</em>, 206 S.W.3d 721, 721 (Tex.\r\nApp.--Houston [1st Dist.] 2006, orig. proceeding); <em>In re T.E.D.</em>, No. 12-06-00143-CV, 2006 Tex.\r\nApp. LEXIS 6758, *1 (Tex. App.--Tyler July 31, 2006, orig. proceeding); <em>In re Moore</em>, 153 S.W.3d\r\n527, 528 (Tex. App.--Tyler 2004, orig. proceeding).  <em>But see Cochran v. Cochran</em>, 333 S.W.2d 635,\r\n637 (Tex. Civ. App.--Houston 1960, writ ref'd n.r.e.) (disqualified attorneys appealed along with\r\nclient from trial court's disqualification order).  In any event, this is not the question squarely before\r\nus, and we need not resolve this question here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tJackson points out that the supreme court did not raise any concerns about a\r\ndisqualified law firm's ability to bring an appeal on its client's behalf in <em>Metropolitan Life Insurance\r\nCo. v. Syntek Finance Corp.</em>, 881 S.W.2d 319, 320 (Tex. 1994).  However, in <em>Syntek Finance</em>, the\r\ntrial court denied a motion to disqualify the insurance company's counsel, but the court of appeals\r\nheld that the denial was an abuse of discretion and reversed the case for a new trial.  <em>Id</em>.  The\r\ninsurance company then appealed to the supreme court.  <em>Id</em>.  In that case, once disqualified by the\r\ncourt of appeals, the attorney discussed by the court of appeals did not participate in the appeal to\r\nthe supreme court; although it is not clear whether the remaining attorneys for the insurance\r\ncompany were from the disqualified law firm, it appears they were.  <em>See id.</em>; <em>Syntek Fin. Corp. v.\r\nMetropolitan Life Ins. Co.</em>, 880 S.W.2d 26, 28 (Tex. App.--Dallas 1994), <em>rev'd</em>, 881 S.W.2d at 320. \r\nWe believe <em>Syntek Finance </em>is distinguishable from this case both because the attorney specifically\r\ndiscussed and disqualified did not participate in the appeal to the supreme court and because the\r\nsupreme court reviewed the court of appeals's opinion reversing the trial court and disqualifying\r\ncounsel, whereas this is an appeal from the trial court's order of dismissal entered well after Jackson\r\nwas disqualified and his petitions for extraordinary relief were denied.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tJackson also notes cases in which this Court did not comment on a disqualified\r\nattorney's lack of authority to bring a petition for writ of mandamus on behalf of his or her client. \r\n<em>See In re Cerberus Capital Mgmt., L.P.</em>, 161 S.W.3d 531, 531 (Tex. App.--Austin 2004, orig.\r\nproceeding); <em>In re Wallingford</em>, 64 S.W.3d 22, 23 (Tex. App.--Austin 1999, orig. proceeding).<sup> (3)</sup> \r\nHowever, we are not concerned in this proceeding with Jackson's authority to bring an original\r\nproceeding on appellants' behalf.  Indeed, Jackson has done just that, filing two petitions for writ of\r\nmandamus in this Court and one in the supreme court.  In the original proceedings, we did not take\r\nissue with Jackson's involvement in the case.  The question before us now is whether Jackson,\r\nhaving been disqualified and denied extraordinary relief three times, may continue to proceed in this\r\nCourt and the trial court as if he had not been disqualified.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t  Finally, we note that the notice of appeal does not state that the parties seek to appeal\r\nfrom the order of Jackson's disqualification.  It says only that the parties wish to appeal from the\r\norder dismissing appellants' claims.  The claims that were dismissed did not belong to Jackson, and\r\nJackson was not a party to that dismissal order.  Jackson may not appeal from the dismissal on his\r\nown behalf.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tJackson has not shown that he is aggrieved by the trial court's disqualification order\r\nto an extent that he can assert a right to appeal, and he may not appeal on his own behalf from his\r\ndisqualification.  That complaint rests with appellants.  Unless and until the trial court's order is\r\noverturned, the order is presumed to be valid and must be given effect.  Jackson may not file further\r\ndocuments on appellants' behalf, as he has long been disqualified from this case and he is, therefore,\r\nno longer a part of this proceeding in any capacity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tDue to the nature of this case, we will not dismiss the appeal outright.  Instead, in the\r\ninterest of justice, we will allow appellants fifteen days in which to decide whether they wish to file\r\nan amended notice of appeal to reflect that Jackson is not a party and is not representing them any\r\nlonger.  Appellants may either proceed pro se and represent themselves, or they may retain new\r\ncounsel to represent them.<sup> (4)</sup>  If appellants do not file an amended notice of appeal by April 4, 2007,\r\nthis Court will dismiss the appeal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tIt is ordered March 19, 2007.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before Chief Justice Law, Justices Patterson and Puryear\r\n</p><p>1.   SOAH filed a letter in response to Jackson's first petition for writ of mandamus (in cause\r\nnumber 03-05-00226-CV), stating that it \"wishe[d] to continue the neutral position it maintained in\r\nthe district court in this case.  SOAH, therefore, [did] not have a response for or against relator's\r\npetition for writ of mandamus.\"  However, following the show cause hearing in this Court, SOAH\r\njoined the OAG in a letter brief asserting that we should dismiss Jackson's appeal of his\r\ndisqualification.  In that letter, SOAH states that it participated in the disqualification hearing and\r\nconcurred in the OAG's arguments and, thus, did not waive the issue of Jackson's disqualification. \r\n</p><p>2.   It is not clear that the claims could even be so segregated or that the reasons asserted by the\r\nOAG for disqualification would not apply with equal force to SOAH.\r\n</p><p>3.   Jackson also cites <em>HECI Exploration Co. v. Clajon Gas Co.</em>, stating that we did not then\r\nhave misgivings about disqualified counsel filing a post-judgment appeal.  843 S.W.2d 622\r\n(Tex. App.--Austin 1992, writ denied).  However, in that case, HECI contended that the trial court\r\nshould have disqualified Clajon's counsel.  <em>Id</em>. at 626.  Counsel was not already disqualified during\r\nthe appeal.  <em>See id</em>.  All but one of the other cases Jackson cites involved original proceedings\r\ncomplaining of an attorney's disqualification.  The remaining case, <em>Cochran v. Cochran</em>, does not\r\naddress the issue.  333 S.W.2d 635, 637 (Tex. Civ. App.--Houston 1960, writ ref'd n.r.e.).\r\n</p><p>4.   Jackson complains that if appellants retain new counsel, counsel will have \"little incentive\r\nto challenge the disqualification of [his or her] predecessor.\"  However, if appellants retain new\r\ncounsel, they may ask that attorney to raise the disqualification complaint as part of the appeal.  If\r\nthey opt not to pursue that complaint, that is their prerogative.  </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>",

Jackson, an attorney who was disqualified by the\r\ntrial court from representing appellants Brian Charles Smith, Robert Hammond, David Talton, and\r\nJohn Collins, individually and on behalf of others similarly situated, appeared before this Court for\r\na show cause hearing related to his continued attempts to represent appellants.  Jackson argues that\r\nbecause no appellate court has explicitly ruled on the propriety of his disqualification, there has been\r\nno ruling on the merits and, therefore, he and appellants may appeal that disqualification.  We hold\r\nthat Jackson may not participate in this appeal in any capacity.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><strong>Factual Background</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tOn July 9, 2004, appellant Smith, represented by Jackson, filed a petition in the trial\r\ncourt, appealing from the suspension of his driver's license for non-payment of child support.  The\r\npetition was amended in September 2004 to add appellants Hammond, Talton, Collins, individually\r\nand on behalf of others similarly situated.  In February 2005, appellees Greg Abbott, Attorney\r\nGeneral of the State of Texas, and Cynthia Bryant, or her successor, as Director of Title IV-D\r\nAgency, filed a motion to disqualify Jackson, stating that Jackson was formerly employed as the\r\npresiding administrative law judge for the Child Support Division of the Attorney General's Office\r\n(\"OAG\") at the time appellants' licenses were suspended, that he had used confidential information\r\nobtained through that employment to solicit clients, including appellants, and that he had violated\r\nthe separation agreement he signed upon ending his employment with the OAG.  A hearing was held\r\non the motion on February 22, 2005, and the trial court granted appellees' motion on March 11,\r\n2005, ordering Jackson withdrawn as attorney of record in the case and ordering him to notify\r\nappellants of his withdrawal and of any pending deadlines.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tOn April 25, 2005, Jackson filed a petition for writ of mandamus on appellants'\r\nbehalf in this Court, signing the document as appellants' attorney and complaining of the trial court's\r\ndecision to disqualify him (cause number 03-05-00226-CV).  This Court denied the petition for writ\r\nof mandamus in May 2005.  Jackson then filed a petition for writ of mandamus on appellants' behalf\r\nwith the supreme court, signing it as appellants' attorney.  The supreme court denied the petition in\r\nAugust 2005, and he filed a motion for rehearing on appellants' behalf, which was denied in October\r\n2005 (cause number 05-0457).  On December 1, Jackson filed in the trial court a motion to reinstate\r\ncounsel or clarify its order, signing the motion as appellants' attorney.  The trial court denied that\r\nmotion on February 23, 2006, and on April 13, 2006, Jackson filed in this Court another petition for\r\nwrit of mandamus and an emergency motion to stay his disqualification pending resolution of his\r\npetition for writ of mandamus.  Those documents were brought in the names of Samuel T. Jackson\r\nand Brian C. Smith, et al., and Jackson signed them as attorney for relators (cause number 03-06-00209-CV).  This Court denied both the emergency motion and the petition on April 14.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tOn March 23, 2006, between the date the court overruled the motion to reconsider\r\nJackson's disqualification and the date Jackson filed his second petition for writ of mandamus, the\r\ntrial court granted appellees' plea to the jurisdiction and dismissed appellants' suit with prejudice. \r\nOn June 26, Jackson, still signing as appellants' attorney, filed a notice of appeal on appellants'\r\nbehalf and on his own behalf, stating that appellees and Jackson wished \"to appeal . . . from the\r\njudgment dismissing with prejudice their claims, entered . . . on March 23, 2006.\"  The OAG soon\r\nfiled a motion to dismiss the appeal based on Jackson's disqualification.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tThis Court ordered Jackson to appear at a show cause hearing on September 23, 2006. \r\nPrior to the hearing, Jackson filed a response asserting that: appeal from his disqualification was not\r\nprecluded by the \"law of the case\" doctrine; the appellate courts' denials of his petitions for writ of\r\nmandamus were not rulings on the merits of his disqualification; his disqualification does not\r\npreclude him from proceeding as appellants' attorney as to their claims against appellee the State\r\nOffice of Administrative Hearings (\"SOAH\"), which did not file a motion to disqualify;<sup> (1)</sup> Jackson\r\nis entitled to represent himself in an appeal from the disqualification; appellants should be allowed\r\nto properly perfect their appeal, should the disqualification be upheld; and appellants' and Jackson's\r\nright to appeal is constitutionally protected.  Following the show cause hearing, Jackson filed a letter\r\nbrief further asserting that this appeal may not be dismissed without a written decision, his\r\ndisqualification did not divest him of the authority to perfect the appeal, Jackson may challenge the\r\ndisqualification on his own behalf, and this Court must determine the propriety of the\r\ndisqualification before dismissing the appeal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><strong>Discussion</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tJackson was disqualified from acting as appellants' attorney in March 2005.  This\r\nCourt denied a petition for writ of mandamus complaining of that disqualification in May, and the\r\nsupreme court denied a similar petition in August and a motion for rehearing in October. \r\nNotwithstanding those decisions, Jackson filed a motion for reconsideration and then again sought\r\nmandamus relief, which this Court denied.  Despite having been disqualified more than a year earlier\r\nand repeatedly being denied relief from that disqualification, Jackson filed a notice of appeal on\r\nappellants' behalf, purporting to be appellants' attorney.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tJackson is correct that the supreme court has held that a denial of a petition for writ\r\nof mandamus does not amount to a decision on the merits of the case.  <em>See In re AIU Ins. Co.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894598\"><a href=\"/opinion/894598/in-re-aiu-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">148</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">109</span></a></span>, 119 (Tex. 2004).  However, having been denied mandamus relief not once, but three\r\ntimes, Jackson may not proceed in the trial court as if the disqualification order is of no effect until\r\nit is ruled on through an appeal.  Unless stayed, a trial court's order must be given effect and is\r\npresumptively valid unless and until an appellate court reverses that order, either through an original\r\nproceeding or through an appeal.  Jackson did not obtain a stay from the disqualification order, and\r\nthe order did not limit his disqualification only to the claims involving the OAG.<sup> (2)</sup>  The trial court's\r\norder and the subsequent denials of extraordinary relief had the effect of disqualifying Jackson from\r\nfurther participation in the case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tJackson prepared and filed a \"joint notice of appeal\" in his and appellants' names,\r\nstating that they wished to appeal the trial court's March 23, 2006 judgment \"dismissing with\r\nprejudice their claims.\"  He argues that he is \"entitled to appeal from the disqualification <em>on his own\r\nbehalf</em>\" and that he has a right to challenge his disqualification on his own behalf, citing to several\r\ncases in an attempt to answer this Court's inquiry as to authority for his proposition.  However,\r\nseveral of the cases Jackson cites involve appeals brought by attorneys sanctioned in court orders for\r\nmisconduct.  <em>See Weeks v. Independent Sch. Dist. No. I-89</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"160295\"><a href=\"/opinion/160295/weeks-v-independent-school/\"><span class=\"volume\">230</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1201</span></a></span>, 1205, 1207 (10th Cir.\r\n2000) (attorney had standing to appeal disqualification order involving finding that attorney had\r\nviolated Oklahoma Rules of Professional Conduct); <em>United States v.

Committee on Admissions &amp; Grievances</em>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">395</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">954</span></span>, 956 (D.C. Cir. 1967) (allowing\r\nattorney's appeal from trial court's determination that attorney \"was guilty of proscribed conduct\"). \r\nIn this case, Jackson has not been sanctioned.  Instead, in its order,  the trial court granted appellees'\r\nmotion to disqualify Jackson without comment.  Thus, Jackson has not shown that his professional\r\nreputation will be damaged if he is not allowed to appeal on his own behalf.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tAlthough Jackson cites several cases that he argues show that Texas courts allow\r\nattorneys to appeal from their disqualification, a review of Texas case law shows that Texas courts\r\ndiscuss <em>a party's right </em>to counsel of its choosing, not <em>an attorney's right </em>to a particular client. \r\nJackson cites to a case from our sister court in El Paso, in which the defendant and its law firm \"as\r\nan intervenor\" filed a joint notice of appeal.  <em>See Cimarron Agric., Ltd. v. Guitar Holding Co., L.P.</em>,\r\n<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1385102\"><a href=\"/opinion/1385102/cimarron-agr-v-guitar-holding-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">209</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">197</span></a></span>, 202 n.2 (Tex. App.--El Paso 2006, no pet.) (emphasis added).  However, the court\r\nin <em>Cimarron</em> stated, \"Regardless of whether [the law firm] has standing individually, Cimarron does\r\nhave standing to assert the claims related to the trial court's disqualification order.\"  <em>Id</em>.  The court\r\ndid <em>not </em>address whether the law firm had a right to bring an appeal from its disqualification.  Our\r\nreview of the law related to disqualification reveals that complaints or appeals arising from such\r\norders are generally brought by the client-party, not by the disqualified attorney.  <em>See</em>, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>In re\r\nSanders</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894622\"><a href=\"/opinion/894622/in-re-sanders/\"><span class=\"volume\">153</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">54</span></a></span>, 56 (Tex. 2004); <em>In re Nitla, S.A. de C.V.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1752732\"><a href=\"/opinion/1752732/in-re-nitla-sa-de-cv/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">419</span></a></span>, 421 (Tex. 2002);\r\n<em>Anderson Producing, Inc. v.

Civ. App.--Houston 1960, writ ref'd n.r.e.) (disqualified attorneys appealed along with\r\nclient from trial court's disqualification order).  In any event, this is not the question squarely before\r\nus, and we need not resolve this question here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tJackson points out that the supreme court did not raise any concerns about a\r\ndisqualified law firm's ability to bring an appeal on its client's behalf in <em>Metropolitan Life Insurance\r\nCo. v. Syntek Finance Corp.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1660583\"><a href=\"/opinion/1660583/metropolitan-life-ins-v-syntek-finance/\"><span class=\"volume\">881</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">319</span></a></span>, 320 (Tex. 1994).  However, in <em>Syntek Finance</em>, the\r\ntrial court denied a motion to disqualify the insurance company's counsel, but the court of appeals\r\nheld that the denial was an abuse of discretion and reversed the case for a new trial.  <em>Id</em>.  The\r\ninsurance company then appealed to the supreme court.  <em>Id</em>.  In that case, once disqualified by the\r\ncourt of appeals, the attorney discussed by the court of appeals did not participate in the appeal to\r\nthe supreme court; although it is not clear whether the remaining attorneys for the insurance\r\ncompany were from the disqualified law firm, it appears they were.  <em>See id.</em>; <em>Syntek Fin. Corp. v.\r\nMetropolitan Life Ins. Co.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2392985\"><a href=\"/opinion/2392985/syntek-finance-corp-v-metropolitan-life-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">880</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span>, 28 (Tex. App.--Dallas 1994), <em>rev'd</em>, 881 S.W.2d at 320. \r\nWe believe <em>Syntek Finance </em>is distinguishable from this case both because the attorney specifically\r\ndiscussed and disqualified did not participate in the appeal to the supreme court and because the\r\nsupreme court reviewed the court of appeals's opinion reversing the trial court and disqualifying\r\ncounsel, whereas this is an appeal from the trial court's order of dismissal entered well after Jackson\r\nwas disqualified and his petitions for extraordinary relief were denied.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tJackson also notes cases in which this Court did not comment on a disqualified\r\nattorney's lack of authority to bring a petition for writ of mandamus on behalf of his or her client. \r\n<em>See In re Cerberus Capital Mgmt., L.P.</em>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">161</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">531</span></span>, 531 (Tex. App.--Austin 2004, orig.\r\nproceeding); <em>In re Wallingford</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1874831\"><a href=\"/opinion/1874831/in-re-wallingford/\"><span class=\"volume\">64</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span>, 23 (Tex. App.--Austin 1999, orig. proceeding).<sup> (3)</sup> \r\nHowever, we are not concerned in this proceeding with Jackson's authority to bring an original\r\nproceeding on appellants' behalf.  Indeed, Jackson has done just that, filing two petitions for writ of\r\nmandamus in this Court and one in the supreme court.  In the original proceedings, we did not take\r\nissue with Jackson's involvement in the case.  The question before us now is whether Jackson,\r\nhaving been disqualified and denied extraordinary relief three times, may continue to proceed in this\r\nCourt and the trial court as if he had not been disqualified.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t  Finally, we note that the notice of appeal does not state that the parties seek to appeal\r\nfrom the order of Jackson's disqualification.  It says only that the parties wish to appeal from the\r\norder dismissing appellants' claims.  The claims that were dismissed did not belong to Jackson, and\r\nJackson was not a party to that dismissal order.  Jackson may not appeal from the dismissal on his\r\nown behalf.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tJackson has not shown that he is aggrieved by the trial court's disqualification order\r\nto an extent that he can assert a right to appeal, and he may not appeal on his own behalf from his\r\ndisqualification.  That complaint rests with appellants.  Unless and until the trial court's order is\r\noverturned, the order is presumed to be valid and must be given effect.  Jackson may not file further\r\ndocuments on appellants' behalf, as he has long been disqualified from this case and he is, therefore,\r\nno longer a part of this proceeding in any capacity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tDue to the nature of this case, we will not dismiss the appeal outright.  Instead, in the\r\ninterest of justice, we will allow appellants fifteen days in which to decide whether they wish to file\r\nan amended notice of appeal to reflect that Jackson is not a party and is not representing them any\r\nlonger.  Appellants may either proceed pro se and represent themselves, or they may retain new\r\ncounsel to represent them.<sup> (4)</sup>  If appellants do not file an amended notice of appeal by April 4, 2007,\r\nthis Court will dismiss the appeal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tIt is ordered March 19, 2007.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before Chief Justice Law, Justices Patterson and Puryear\r\n</p><p>1.   SOAH filed a letter in response to Jackson's first petition for writ of mandamus (in cause\r\nnumber 03-05-00226-CV), stating that it \"wishe[d] to continue the neutral position it maintained in\r\nthe district court in this case.  SOAH, therefore, [did] not have a response for or against relator's\r\npetition for writ of mandamus.\"  However, following the show cause hearing in this Court, SOAH\r\njoined the OAG in a letter brief asserting that we should dismiss Jackson's appeal of his\r\ndisqualification.  In that letter, SOAH states that it participated in the disqualification hearing and\r\nconcurred in the OAG's arguments and, thus, did not waive the issue of Jackson's disqualification. \r\n</p><p>2.   It is not clear that the claims could even be so segregated or that the reasons asserted by the\r\nOAG for disqualification would not apply with equal force to SOAH.\r\n</p><p>3.   Jackson also cites <em>HECI Exploration Co. v. Clajon Gas Co.</em>, stating that we did not then\r\nhave misgivings about disqualified counsel filing a post-judgment appeal.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2364267\"><a href=\"/opinion/2364267/heci-exploration-co-v-clajon-gas-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">843</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">622</span></a></span>\r\n(Tex. App.--Austin 1992, writ denied).  However, in that case, HECI contended that the trial court\r\nshould have disqualified Clajon's counsel.  <em>Id</em>. at 626.  Counsel was not already disqualified during\r\nthe appeal.  <em>See id</em>.  All but one of the other cases Jackson cites involved original proceedings\r\ncomplaining of an attorney's disqualification.  The remaining case, <em>Cochran v. Cochran</em>, does not\r\naddress the issue.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2465773\"><a href=\"/opinion/2465773/cochran-v-cochran/\"><span class=\"volume\">333</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">635</span></a></span>, 637 (Tex. Civ. App.--Houston 1960, writ ref'd n.r.e.).\r\n</p><p>4.   Jackson complains that if appellants retain new counsel, counsel will have \"little incentive\r\nto challenge the disqualification of [his or her] predecessor.\"  However, if appellants retain new\r\ncounsel, they may ask that attorney to raise the disqualification complaint as part of the appeal.  If\r\nthey opt not to pursue that complaint, that is their prerogative.  </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>",
