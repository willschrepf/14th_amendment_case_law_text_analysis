Post, individually and as the natural\nparents of Todd R. Murray; Debra Jones, as personal representative of the Estate of Todd\nR. Murray, deceased, for and on behalf of the heirs of Todd R. Murray, and the Ute Indian\nTribe of the Uintah and Ouray Reservation.” Plaintiffs Jones and Post are the biological\nparents of Todd R. Murray, a 21-year old member of the Ute Indian Tribe, whose death\nis the basis for the above captioned case, filed against the United States for violation of\n\fa radio dispatch from his patrol car advising the Utah central Police Dispatch that he was\npursuing a car containing ‘two tribal males’ for a speeding violation.” Trooper Swenson\nlater testified2 that the vehicle was traveling 74 miles per hour in a 65 mile an hour zone.\nThe driver of the vehicle was 17-year-old Uriah Kurip, and his lone passenger was the\ndecedent, 21-year-old Todd Murray. The alleged speeding violation occurred just outside\nthe boundary of the Ute Tribe’s Uncompaghre Reservation in Utah. In what Trooper\nSwenson later testified he viewed as an attempt to evade police pursuit, Mr. Kurip turned\noff U.S. Highway 40, onto State Road 88, an intersection located more than two miles\noutside the boundary of the Uncompahgre Reservation. Although Trooper Swenson\nbegan his pursuit off the Uncompaghre Reservation, the pursuit carried into the\nUncompaghre Reservation, land held by the Ute Indians, and ended 25 miles south of\nthe intersection of U.S. 40 and State Road 8 at the intersection of Seep Ridge Road and\nTurkey Track Road, an intersection also inside the boundary of the Uncompaghre\nReservation. Once stopped, Mr. Kurip and Mr. Murray exited their vehicle and stood on\neither side of the vehicle. The amended complaint reflects that Trooper Swenson testified\nthat he exited his vehicle with his gun drawn and ordered the two to the ground. Mr. Kurip\nand Mr. Murray exchanged looks and Trooper Swenson repeated the command two or\nthree times, after which Mr. Kurip and Mr. Murray ran from their vehicle in opposite\ndirections. Trooper Swenson pursued Mr. Kurip on foot and quickly apprehended him.\n\n       Responding to Trooper Swenson’s earlier radio dispatch requests for help, off-duty\nVernal City police officer Vance Norton was next to arrive on the scene, dressed in street\nclothes and driving his personal vehicle. Officer Norton set off on foot in pursuit of Mr.\nMurray. Utah Highway Patrol Trooper Craig Young and Uintah County Deputy Anthoney\nByron subsequently joined in the search. Officer Norton later testified he eventually\nencountered Mr. Murray as Mr. Murray was rounding a hill. According to the amended\ncomplaint, Officer Norton testified he saw Mr. Murray before Mr. Murray saw him. Officer\nNorton allegedly raised his gun and shouted, “POLICE—GET TO THE GROUND.”\n(capitalization in original). Also, according to the amended complaint, Officer Norton\nrecalled seeing something in Mr. Murray’s hand, but admitted that he could not tell what\nwas in Mr. Murray’s hand. Defendant indicates in its motion to dismiss that it was later\ndetermined Mr. Murray was carrying an illegally purchased .380 caliber handgun. Further,\naccording to plaintiffs’ amended complaint, Officer Norton indicated Mr. Murray raised his\nhand and fired shots, and Officer Norton, in turn, fired two rounds at Mr. Murray. The\namended complaint states that “Norton alleges that Murray then turned the gun on himself\nand pulled the trigger. Officer Norton contacted dispatch, advised that shots had been\nfired and that Murray had shot himself.” “At the time of the shooting, Officers Byron and\nYoung state they were approaching from the south with their firearms drawn. Officers\nByron and Young worked together to handcuff Murray.” Plaintiffs contend that Trooper\n\n\nthe Ute treaties and federal statutes and breach of trust in violation of the Ute treaties\nfederal statutes.\n2 Although the amended complaint repeatedly refers to “testimony” by multiple individuals,\nthe amended complaint does not indicate how or under what circumstances the\n“testimony” was taken.\n                                             2\n\fSwenson, Officer Norton, “Defendant” Byron, and “Defendant” Young3 are not cross-\ndeputized by the federal government or the Ute Tribe to exercise law enforcement powers\nover Native Americans inside the Ute Tribe’s Reservation.4\n\n        After the shooting, a number of other officers arrived at the scene, including\nSpecial Agents Rex Ashdown and David Ryan with the Federal Bureau of Investigation\n(FBI) and various officials from the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). In their amended\ncomplaint, plaintiffs allege that the FBI and BIA officers “ostensibly assumed jurisdiction\nof the scene” because “the shooting scene was in Indian Country,” yet “[t]he FBI and BIA\nofficers on the scene were complicit in the State officers’ improper assertion of\njurisdictional authority over the shooting site.” Plaintiffs further allege that Raymond\n\n3 Although plaintiffs refer to Officers Young and Bryon as “defendants” in the amended\ncomplaint, the only proper defendant in the United States Court of Federal Claims is the\nUnited States. See Rule 10(a) of the Rules of the United States Court of Federal Claims\n(RCFC) (2014) (“The title of the complaint must name all the parties . . . , with the United\nStates designated as the party defendant.”). The United States Supreme Court has\nindicated that for suits filed in the United States Court of Federal Claims and its\npredecessors, “[i]f the relief sought is against others than the United States the suit as to\nthem must be ignored as beyond the jurisdiction of the court.” United States v. Sherwood,\n312 U.S. 584, 588 (1941) (citation omitted) Slattery v. United States, 635 F.3d 1298, 1321\nn.1 (Fed. Cir.), aff’d, 710 F.3d 1336 (Fed. Cir.), cert. denied, 134 S. Ct. 1276 (2014); May\nv. United States, 80 Fed. Cl. 442, 444 (“Jurisdiction, then, is limited to suits against the\nUnited States.”), aff’d, 293 F. App’x 775 (Fed. Cir.), reh’g and reh’g en banc denied (Fed.\nCir. 2008). Stated differently, “the only proper defendant for any matter before this court\nis the United States, not its officers, nor any other individual.” Stephenson v. United\nStates, 58 Fed. Cl. 186, 190 (2003) (emphasis in original); see also United States v.\nSherwood, 312 U.S. at 588; Brown v. United States, 105 F.3d 621, 623 (Fed. Cir.), reh’g\ndenied (Fed. Cir. 1997); Hover v. United States, 113 Fed. Cl. 295, 296 (2013) (“As an\ninitial matter, it is well settled that the United States is the only proper defendant in the\nUnited States Court of Federal Claims.”); Warren v. United States, 106 Fed. Cl. 507, 510-\n11 (2012) (“It is well settled that the United States is the only proper defendant in the\nCourt of Federal Claims.”). Therefore, the court only refers to the United States as the\ndefendant in the above captioned case.\n4Plaintiffs amended the complaint after defendant filed a motion to dismiss the complaint.\nPlaintiffs allege in the amended complaint:\n\n       Murray was shot after being pursued at gun-point by two Utah state\n       Highway Troopers, a Uintah County Sheriff’s Deputy, and an off-duty Vernal\n       City, Utah, police officer. The pursuit took place over tribal trust lands more\n       than 25 miles inside the northern boundary of the U&O Reservation. The\n       four shooting-involved officers had no criminal jurisdiction over Indians\n       inside the U&O Reservation. The officers also had no probable cause to\n       believe that Todd Murray had committed any crime.\n\n(internal citation omitted).\n                                             3\n\fWissiup, a member of the Ute Tribe and a certified law enforcement officer was excluded\nfrom the scene. In addition, plaintiffs contend that the law enforcement officers did not\nsegregate, question, or search the officers involved in Mr. Murray’s shooting, nor properly\nprocess their firearms.\n\n        At 11:30 a.m., immediately following the shooting, “Officer Norton contacted\ndispatch, advised that shots had been fired and that Murray had shot himself.” Plaintiffs\nallege that an ambulance did not arrive on the scene until 12:02 p.m., and further allege\nthat prior to its arrival, Mr. Murray was alive, but no state or federal officer provided him\nmedical aid. According to the amended complaint, when the ambulance arrived on the\nscene, Mr. Murray’s “breathing was labored, his limbs were twitching, and he was\nunconscious. There was a copious amount of blood around his head.” The ambulance\ntransported Mr. Murray to Ashely Valley Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead\nat 1:19 p.m. According to the amended complaint, the “FBI and the BIA officers then\nallowed the Utah state, county and municipal officers to transport Murray’s body to the\nThomson-Blackburn Vernal Mortuary (Mortuary) in Vernal, Utah, for holding overnight\nuntil the body could be transported to the Utah State Medical Examiner’s office for an\nautopsy the next day.”\n\n        Plaintiffs contend that the FBI and BIA officers “took no action to secure Todd\nMurray’s remains or the crime scene itself.” Plaintiffs also assert that “municipal officers\npresent at the medical center proceeded to violate Murray’s dignity and to tamper with\nthe physical evidence.” While at the hospital, plaintiffs allege that Mr. Murray’s body was\nunnecessarily and inappropriately disrobed, manipulated, and photographed. Officer\nByron was allegedly photographed with his finger inserted in Mr. Murray’s head wound.\nPlaintiffs assert that BIA Officer Kevin Myore was present at the medical center and\n“condoned and participated in, or failed to prevent, the illegal and unethical desecration\nof Mr. Murray’s remains and the spoliation of critical evidence.” Plaintiffs also claim that\n“Special Agent Ashdown took no action to secure and preserve Mr. Murray’s body at the\nMortuary” and instead was “complicit in the additional acts of horrific desecration and\nevidence tampering that took place at the Mortuary.” Further, plaintiffs claim that the\nVernal City Police Chief Gary Jensen “admits” to inserting a needle into Mr. Murray to\ndraw blood, and allege that “Chief Jensen then allegedly directed a mortuary employee\nto make an unauthorized incision to Murray’s jugular vein, from which two vials of blood\nwere purportedly drawn, although neither the Utah state nor the federal law enforcement\nofficers have ever accounted for the blood vials drawn from Murray’s body at the\nMortuary.” Plaintiffs also contend, “[n]either the Mortuary, nor any law enforcement\nofficers, obtained the permission of Mr. Murray's next of kin to desecrate Todd Murray’s\nremains in this manner.”\n\n       The amended complaint states that Mr. Murray’s body was next transported to the\nUtah Office of the Medical Examiner. The Utah Office of the Medical Examiner allegedly\n“elected to forego an autopsy and to perform only a simple external examination of Mr.\nMurray’s body.” Plaintiffs indicate that:\n\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\f       OME’s [Utah Office of the Medical Examiner’s] final pathological diagnosis\n       was that the entrance wound on Mr. Murray's head was on the lateral left\n       scalp and the exit wound was on the upper posterior right scalp. Thus, the\n       gunshot wound that killed Todd R. Murray entered on the left side of Mr.\n       Murray's head and exited on the right side of Mr. Murray's head.\n\n(emphasis in original). Plaintiffs further note that the Utah Office of the Medical Examiner\nreported that Mr. Murray arrived with his hands “bagged” and that no soot was found on\neither of Mr. Murray’s hands, his left hand was clean and free of any debris or blood, and\nhis right hand was bloody. Moreover, plaintiffs allege that “the FBI officers and the BIA\nofficers allowed the Utah Medical Examiner’s Office to list the cause of Todd Murray’s\ndeath as a suicide, when the Medical Examiner himself later testified that he could not\nrule out the possibility that Todd Murray was shot in the back of his head execution style.”\nPlaintiffs, therefore, challenge Officer’s Norton version of events and state that “Todd\nMurray did not shoot himself execution-style in the back of his head.” (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\n        In addition, plaintiffs contend that “all of the evidence the FBI and BIA officers were\nresponsible for—and that would have been of a dispositive nature in this case—has been\ndestroyed or altered,” and that, throughout, the FBI and BIA officers disregarded proper\ninvestigatory procedure and preservation of evidence. Specifically, plaintiffs contend that\nthe firearm that Mr. Murray allegedly fired during his encounter with Officer Norton was\ndestroyed by the FBI and not forensically tested and that Mr. Murray’s person or clothing\nwere never forensically tested. Plaintiffs contend the same regarding preservation and\nforensic testing of Officer Norton’s firearm, personal vehicle, person, and clothing.\nPlaintiffs further contend that Officer Norton was not sequestered, but was allowed free\naccess to the scene of the shooting, thereby giving Officer Norton the “opportunity to\ntamper with the physical evidence.” Plaintiffs also allege other failures, including lack of\ndocumentation of the scene, failure to administer medical aid to Mr. Murray, improper\nhandling of, and tampering with, Mr. Murray’s body at the medical center, mortuary, and\nUtah Office of the Medical Examiner, resulting in “significantly altered and potentially\ndestroyed critical evidence,” and failure by the Utah Office of the Medical Examiner to\nperform an autopsy of Mr. Murray’s body.\n\n       According to the complaint, “[t]hree weeks after the shooting, members of Todd\nMurray’s family met with FBI Agent Ashdown.” Plaintiffs allege that “[t]he family members\nexplained to Agent Ashdown that Todd Murray was a right-handed individual; they told\nAshdown it would have been impossible for Murray to shoot himself in the back of the\nhead, above and behind his left ear.”5 Mr. Murray’s family urged Special Agent Ashdown\nto investigate and revisit the circumstances of Mr. Murray’s death. According to plaintiffs,\nSpecial Agent Ashdown “promised the family members that the FBI would conduct a full\ninvestigation” yet despite this promise, the United States has never conducted a civil or\n\n\n5 According to the amended complaint, “Agent Ashdown admitted to the family members\nthat it would be impossible for a right-handed individual to shoot himself in the back of the\nhead, above and behind his left ear.”\n                                              5\n\fcriminal investigation into “the actions of any single individual” involved in the\ncircumstances surrounding Mr. Murray’s death, nor of the investigatory and preservation\nprocedures immediately following. Plaintiffs contend that Special Agent Ashdown later\nadmitted under oath that he conducted no investigation into the shooting of Mr. Murray\nlargely because of his long-standing relationship with Officer Norton.\n\n        On July 17, 2009, Debra Jones, individually, as the natural parent of Todd Murray,\nand as personal representative of the Estate of Todd R. Murray for and on behalf of Mr.\nMurray’s heirs, and Arden Post, individually and as the natural parent of Todd Murray,\nfiled suit in the Uintah County Court regarding the death of Mr. Murray. See Jones et al.\nv. Norton et al., 3 F. Supp. 3d 1170 (D. Utah 2014).6 The plaintiffs brought suit in the\nDistrict Court and asserted civil rights claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (2006) and 42\nU.S.C. § 1985 (2006) against Uintah County and the City of Vernal, and against law\nenforcement officers, in their individual, as well as in their official, capacities. Plaintiffs\nsought upwards of $3,000,000.00 in damages. “In their § 1983 claims against the\nIndividual Defendants, the Plaintiffs allege illegal seizure, excessive force, and failure to\nintervene to prevent the officers' unconstitutional acts. Under § 1985, they allege\nconspiracy to obstruct justice and conspiracy to violate Mr. Murray's civil rights based on\nracial animus.” Jones et al. v. Norton et al., 3 F. Supp. 3d. at 1177. Plaintiffs alleged\nadditional numerous causes of action, including illegal seizure, use of excessive force,\nassault/battery, and wrongful death. Subsequently, the suit was removed to the United\nStates District Court for the District of Utah on August 20, 2009.\n\n        On March 12, 2013, while the District Court case was pending, plaintiffs mailed a\nletter to senior officials at the United States Department of the Interior, giving notice of\ntheir intent to file suit against the United States. The letter was titled “Notice of Claim\nconcerning the April 1, 2007 Shooting Death of Todd Murray, Ute Indian tribal member.”\nThe letter states:\n\n         Dear Messrs. Toulou, Smith, and Washburn and Secretary of the Interior:\n\n         Our law firm represents the Ute Indian Tribe of the Uintah and Ouray\n         Reservation (“Tribe” or “Ute Tribe”). We also represent tribal members\n         Debra Jones and Arden Post who are the parents of Todd Murray, a tribal\n         member who was shot to death in an encounter with Utah state and local\n         police on the Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation in Utah (“U&O\n         Reservation”) in 2007. Please accept this letter as our notice of claim to\n         your respective agencies of our intent to file a complaint against the United\n         States based on breaches of the 1863 and 1868 Ute Treaties and the United\n         States’ violation of its trust obligations to the Ute Tribe and its members.\n\n         We plan to file suit in the Federal Court of Claims and allege that the Federal\n         Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), by and\n         through their employees, committed wrongs upon the person or property of\n\n\n6   The Ute Indian Tribe was not a party to the District Court litigation.\n                                                6\n\fthe Indians, namely decedent Todd Murray his family and the Ute Indian\nTribe as a whole. Included with our letter are the Plaintiffs’ (i) Third\nAmended Complaint, (ii) motion for default judgment on liability based on\ntampering [sic] destruction of critical evidence, and (iii) motion for summary\njudgment under Counts 1, 3 and 5 filed in the parents’ private cause of\naction, DEBRA JONES, et al., v, VANCE NORTON, et al., Civil Case No.\n2:09-cv-00730, U.S. District Court, District of Utah, Central Division.\n\nThe attached filings give an overview of the sequence of events that\ntranspired on April 1, 2007 as well as a clear indication of the egregious\nactions of the law enforcement officers who participated in this\n“investigation.” The FBI and the BIA representatives who were present on\nApril 1, 2007 and who participated in the “investigation” contributed to the\ntravesties by (1) failing to protect the Ute Tribe’s interests as a sovereign in\nthe crime scene, (2) failing to properly preserve and protect evidence from\nbeing tampered with and destroyed, and (3) failing to conduct their own\nindependent investigation into the death of Todd Murray. As a result of the\naforementioned failures, the Murray family and the Ute Indian Tribe are\nseeking damages from the United States in the amount of $10 million, as\nwell as reimbursement of litigation costs and attorney fees.\n\nAttached to this letter is a summary of the relevant Treaty obligations that\nhave been violated by the actions and inactions of the United States in this\ncase. Under Article 6 of the 1863 Treaty, the Ute Indian bands agreed to\nforego \"private revenge or retaliation\" for injuries suffered by the Tribe and\nindividual tribal members as the result of the “misconduct of individuals.” In\nreturn the United States guaranteed the Tribe and individual tribal members\na right to legal redress for \"any robbery violence, or murder\" committed \"on\nan Indian or Indians\" belonging to the Ute Indian bands. Article 6 of the 1868\nTreaty promised that any person violating the territorial integrity of the\nReservation and causing harm to the Tribe or its tribal members would be\n\"punished according to the laws of the United States.\" In violation of these\ntreaty obligations, the United States has failed to investigate or to prosecute\nthe individuals involved in the shooting death of 21 year-old Todd Murray in\nApril 2007, and the subsequent conspiracy to suppress, alter, and destroy\ncritical evidence.\n\nPlease feel free to contact our office should you require any additional\ninformation regarding this forthcoming claim.\n\n\nSincerely,\n\nSandra L. Denton\n\n\n\n\n                                       7\n\f(footnote omitted). The March 12, 2013 letter attached almost four hundred pages of\nexhibits, including filings in the District Court such as the plaintiffs’ third amended\ncomplaint, the motion for summary judgment, and plaintiffs’ motion for allegedly the\ntampering and destruction of critical evidence.\n\n        On March 7, 2014, the District Court granted the defendant’s motion for summary\njudgment, and denied plaintiffs’ cross motion. See Jones et al. v. Norton et al., 3 F. Supp.\n3d 1170. On April 1, 2014, plaintiffs appealed the District Court’s decision to the United\nStates Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. See Jones et al. v. Norton et al., No. 14-\n4040 (10th Cir. appeal docketed Apr. 1, 2014). On November 18, 2014, plaintiffs filed\nanother appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, appealing the\nDistric Court’s amended judgment. See Jones et al. v. Norton et al., No. 14-4144 (10th\nCir. appeal docketed Nov. 18, 2014).7 To date, the Tenth Circuit has not issued a decision\non plaintiffs’ appeal.\n\n        In the District Court case, the Court considered whether Mr. Murray was “seized”\nfor 4th Amendment purposes.8 Most relevant to the above captioned case, “[t]he Plaintiffs\ncontend that Detective Norton seized Mr. Murray when he (1) fired shots at Mr. Murray;\nand (2) according to Plaintiffs, shot Mr. Murray in the head.” Jones et al. v. Norton et al.,\n3 F. Supp. 3d at 1189. The District Court determined that “[t]he record does not support\ntheir claim and no reasonable jury could find against Detective Norton,” and that “[t]he\nevidence clearly shows that Mr. Murray shot himself.” Id. at 1189, 1190. The District Court\nalso determined:\n\n         [T]he Plaintiffs' evidence is sparse, circumstantial, subject to more than one\n         interpretation, and, at times, very speculative. Moreover, evidence to the\n         contrary is strong and is consistent with a self-inflicted gunshot wound.\n         Deputy Byron testified that he did not see Detective Norton next to Mr.\n\n\n7On October 15, 2014, the District Court amended its judgement “to reflect the award of\ncosts” to the defendants. See Jones et al. v. Norton et al., No. 2: 09–CV–730–TC, 2014\nWL 909569 (D. Utah Oct, 15, 2014).\n8   As indicated by the District Court:\n\n         The Plaintiffs contend that officers Norton, Young, Byron, and Swenson\n         seized Mr. Murray on the Reservation and so a violation of Mr. Murray's\n         Fourth Amendment rights necessarily occurred. They focus on the following\n         events: (1) Trooper Swenson's order to Mr. Kurip and Mr. Murray to stop\n         after the car chase ended and the men got out of the car; (2) the forming of\n         a police perimeter to entrap Mr. Murray; (3) Detective Norton firing at Mr.\n         Murray twice; (4) when Detective Norton's bullet allegedly entered Mr.\n         Murray's head; and (5) Deputy Byron handcuffing Mr. Murray while Trooper\n         Young pointed his gun as cover for Deputy Byron.\n\nJones et al. v. Norton et al., 3 F. Supp. 3d at 1186 (footnotes omitted).\n                                               8\n\f       Murray when Mr. Murray dropped to the ground. Detective Norton testified\n       that he was up on a hill when he saw Mr. Murray shoot himself.\n\n       The Deputy Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Edward Leis, who conducted the\n       physical examination of Mr. Murray's body, concluded in his report that the\n       wound was caused by a gun shot “in close proximity to the skin surface\n       when it was discharged.” He based his conclusion on “abundant soot at the\n       inferior margin of the defect [the wound] and some marginal abrasion is also\n       noted at the inferior margin.” In his testimony, he elaborated on his\n       conclusion that the gun was in contact with Mr. Murray's head when it was\n       fired:\n\n              At the perimeter, there are several triangular shaped tears of\n              the wound. That's a result of the gun being pressed up against\n              the skin surface when it's discharged and gases causing the\n              scalp to be separated from the underlying skull. When the\n              scalp lifts up, it stretches and it tears and gets its characteristic\n              stellae appearance.\n\n       The smaller wound on the right side of Mr. Murray's head was, in Dr. Leis'\n       opinion, the exit wound. After Dr. Leis certified that Mr. Murray's death was\n       a suicide resulting from a gunshot wound to the head, he added an\n       additional cause of death (based on results from testing of Mr. Murray's\n       bodily fluids). Because the tests showed the presence of drugs and alcohol\n       in Mr. Murray's system, Dr. Leis issued an amended death certificate which\n       added “Acute alcohol intoxication; recent methamphetamine use” as\n       contributing to Mr. Murray's death.\n\n       Detective Norton was more than 100 yards away when Mr. Murray was\n       shot. Dr. Leis testified that there was no evidence that the wound could have\n       been caused by a shot coming from that far away. Plaintiffs maintain that\n       Detective Norton was not 100 yards away, but was right next to Mr. Murray\n       and so he had the capability of inflicting the contact wound. But the actual\n       evidence in the record (that is, testimony by Detective Norton and Deputy\n       Byron) shows that Detective Norton was not right next to Mr. Murray when\n       the fatal shot was fired.\n\nId. at 1190-91 (footnotes omitted).\n\n      The District Court noted that plaintiffs also alleged the defendant conspired to\ncover up the killing of Mr. Murray, stating, “[s]ummed up, Plaintiffs’ argument is that\nDefendants engaged in ‘[a] conspiracy to cover up a killing.’ Plaintiffs’ theory is that\nDetective Norton shot and killed Mr. Murray, and that the rest of the Defendants conspired\nto cover-up that killing and protect Detective Norton.” Id. at 1197 (footnotes omitted).\nAddressing the plaintiffs’ alleged conspiracy, the court stated: “The focus of the Plaintiffs’\n\n\n\n                                               9\n\fconspiracy theory is the failure to give aid and their spoliation argument about the\ndestruction of evidence.” Id. at 1202.\n\n         Turning to plaintiffs’ claims of the defendants’ failure to give medical aid to Mr.\nMurray, and the defendants’ “interference with Mr. Murray's due process right of access\nto courts via the failure to preserve critical evidence and the affirmative destruction of\ncritical evidence,” the District Court determined,\n\n       [n]one of that testimony could allow a reasonable jury to conclude that\n       Individual Defendants were deliberately indifferent to Mr. Murray's situation,\n       or that they knew that there was a substantial risk of significant harm to Mr.\n       Murray if they did not provide first aid. If anything, the evidence shows that\n       at least three of the Individual Defendants (Young, Davis, and Slaugh) were\n       concerned that attempts to provide any kind of aid to Mr. Murray would do\n       more harm than good.\n\nId. at 1210. The District Court stated: “[i]n sum, there is no evidence before the court to\nsupport a finding that the inaction by each individual defendant was part of a conspiracy\nto let Mr. Murray die.” Id. at 1203. The District Court also determined that, “[b]ased on the\nfacts as detailed and explained in its spoliation order, the court concludes that no\nreasonable jury could conclude that Defendants conspired to ‘effectively eliminate[ ] all\nprobative evidence’ and ‘clean the closet of evidence that would have allowed Plaintiffs\nto build their case.’”9 Id. at 1204 (quoting various plaintiffs’ briefs; omissions in original;\nfootnote omitted). Therefore, the District Court concluded that “the Defendants did not\nviolate Mr. Murray's civil rights for failing to provide medical aid, nor did the Defendants\nfail to preserve evidence.”10 Id. at 1210 (footnote omitted).\n\n\n\n9 In relation to plaintiffs’ claim that defendants’ conspired to violate Mr. Murray's civil rights,\nthe District Court explained that the plaintiffs asked “the court to infer the existence of\nsuch a conspiracy (much like they asked the court to infer racial animus) from a handful\nof facts and the Plaintiffs' speculative characterization of those facts as so ‘brazen and\nflagrant’ and ‘unjustifiable and irrational’ that they support a finding of conspiracy.” Jones\net al. v. Norton et al., 3 F. Supp. 3d. at 1201 (footnote omitted).\n10The defendants’ alleged failure to preserve evidence was discussed in detail in the\nDistrict Court’s spoliation order. See Jones et al. v. Norton et al., No. 2: 09–CV–730–TC,\n2014 WL 909569. For instance, the plaintiffs argued that “critical evidence was lost\nbecause Mr. Murray's hands were not bagged properly and Mr. Murray's body was not\nproperly preserved because the body bag was incorrectly sealed.” The District Court,\nhowever, determined, that:\n\n       There is no evidence to show that Mr. Murray's hands were bagged\n       improperly. Plaintiffs argue that Mr. Murray's hands must have been\n       improperly bagged because some photographs showed his hands bagged\n       and others did not, but there is no evidence to show who, when, and where\n                                                10\n\f        On April 1, 2013, approximately three weeks after plaintiffs mailed the March 12,\n2013 letter to the Department of the Interior officials, giving notice of their intent to file suit\nin this court, and exactly six years after Todd Murray’s death, plaintiffs filed suit in this\ncourt. Plaintiffs’ suit in this court was consistent with the information submitted in the\nMarch 12, 2013 letter.\n\n       In response, defendant filed a motion to dismiss, pursuant to RCFC 12(b)(1) and\nRCFC 12(b)(6), alleging lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim.\nNotably, defendant argued that “[i]n addition to the various individuals identified in the\nComplaint, Plaintiffs aver that the FBI, BIA, the State of Utah, Unitah County, Vernal city,\nand various non-federal enforcement agencies are ‘bad men’ as that term is used in the\ntreaties.” According to defendant, “[t]he federal government and various state\nenforcement agencies, however, cannot be ‘bad men’ as that term is used in the treaties.”\n\n      Plaintiffs subsequently moved to amend the complaint, and in support of their\nmotion stated:\n\n       The Plaintiffs’ proposed amendments [sic] correct the pleading deficiencies\n       cited by the United States in its motion to dismiss the complaint. The\n       amendments include additional factual allegations to make clear the\n       substance of the Plaintiffs’ allegations, and to make clear that Plaintiffs\n       sought administrative review of Todd Murray’s shooting death before filing\n       this action. The amendments also make clear that Plaintiffs’ claims are\n       based on the actions and inactions of individual federal officers, not the\n       actions or inactions of the federal agencies employing those officers, i.e.,\n       the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Indian Affairs.\n\n       The court granted plaintiffs’ motion, after which plaintiffs filed an amended\ncomplaint. Plaintiffs’ amended complaint, which asserts numerous claims for relief,\nalleges that the United States committed cognizable wrongs upon Mr. Murray and the Ute\nTribe. According to plaintiffs’ amended complaint, the United States, by and through the\nconduct of the FBI and BIA, violated the guarantees of two Ute Treaties, entered into and\nsigned in 1863 and 1868. Plaintiffs also advance a breach of trust claim for the same\nalleged violations and injustices. For these alleged injuries, plaintiffs seek compensatory\ndamages in the amount of $10,000,000.00, as well as costs, attorney’s fees, “and all other\ndamages permitted by the Treaties with the Utes, and such other and further relief as this\nCourt deems proper.”\n\n     Specifically, plaintiffs’ claims for relief, set forth in the amended complaint, are: “I.\nVIOLATION OF THE UTE TREATIES AND OTHHER [sic] FEDERAL LAWS,” and “I. [sic]\n\n\n       Mr. Murray's hands were bagged, or when the bags were removed. And\n       there is no evidence to show that the body bag was sealed.\n\nId. at *11.\n                                                11\n\fBREACH OF TRUST IN VIOLATION OF THE UTE TREATIES AND OTHER FEDERAL\nLAW.” (capitalization in original). Within the alleged “VIOLATION OF THE UTE\nTREATIES AND OTHHER [sic] FEDERAL LAWS,” (capitalization in original) plaintiffs\nallege:\n\n       By their actions and inactions, the FBI and BIA officers committed wrongs\n       to Todd Murray, the Murray family and the Ute Tribe (i) by acting in concert\n       with state/county/municipal officers, expressly or impliedly, in concocting, or\n       permitting to be concocted, a false story that Todd Murray shot himself in\n       the back of his head, execution style, above and behind his left ear; (ii) by\n       failing to take custody of Murray’s body and to secure the body against\n       desecration and spoliation of evidence; [sic] (iv) by participating in, tacitly\n       allowing, or failing to prevent, the desecration of Murray’s body and the\n       spoliation of critical evidence both at the shooting scene and afterwards at\n       the Medical Center, Blackburn Mortuary, and at the Utah OME; (v) the\n       failure to insure that a proper autopsy was performed on Murray’s body; (vi)\n       by failing to conduct any kind of investigation into Todd Murray’s murder;\n       and (vii) by failing to protect the territorial integrity of the Tribe’s reservation\n       boundary and the Tribe’s sovereign interests in the crime scene where\n       Murray was shot.[11]\n\n(emphasis in original).\n\n        Regarding the “BREACH OF TRUST IN VIOLATION OF THE UTE TREATIES\nAND OTHHER [sic] FEDERAL LAW,” (capitalization in original) plaintiffs claim that “[i]n\nviolation of federal law and its treaty obligations, the United States has failed to investigate\nor prosecute the individuals involved in the shooting death of 21 year-old Todd Murray on\nApril 1, 2007, or the subsequent conspiracy to suppress, alter, and destroy critical\n\n\n11The court notes that preceeding the list of allegations in plaintiffs’ amended complaint,\nplaintiffs also claim:\n\n       In April 2007, Todd Murray, Todd Murray’s family, and the Ute Indian Tribe\n       suffered “injuries” at the hands of “bad men” as those terms are used in the\n       Ute Treaties of 1863 and 1868. These injuries include (i) the extra-territorial\n       police pursuit, assault upon and murder of Todd Murray, (ii) the conspiracy\n       to cover up Todd Murray’s murder, (iii) the failure of federal officers to take\n       custody of Murray’s body and to secure the body against desecration and\n       spoliation of evidence; (iv) the desecration of Murray’s body and the\n       spoliation of critical evidence both at the shooting scene and afterwards at\n       the Medical Center, Blackburn Mortuary, and at the Utah OME; (v) the\n       failure to insure that a proper autopsy was performed on Murray’s body;\n       [sic] (vii) failure of federal officers to conduct any kind of investigation into\n       Todd Murray’s murder; and (vi) the failure of federal officers to protect the\n       territorial integrity of the Tribe’s reservation boundary and the Tribe’s\n       sovereign interests in the crime scene where Murray was shot.\n                                               12\n\fevidence related to the shooting death.” Plaintiffs claim that “[b]y failing to investigate\nTodd Murray’s death and by taking no action to promote justice in Indian Country, Special\nAgent Rex Ashdown and David Ryan and BIA Officers James Beck, Terrance Cuch and\nKevin Myore breached their duties to the Ute Tribe, to Todd Murray, and to Murray’s\nfamily under the Ute Treaties of 1863 and 1868. . . .”\n\n       Plaintiffs further allege:\n\n       The United States has also breached its trust obligations to the Tribe and\n       Murray’s family by failing to protect the territorial integrity of the Tribe’s\n       reservation and the Tribe’s sovereign interest in the shooting site, thus\n       allowing unauthorized persons to trespass on the Ute homeland and cause\n       harm to tribal members with complete impunity. The Defendant’s breach of\n       its trust and treaty obligations has resulted in substantial loss to the Tribe.\n       Todd Murray was a registered tribal member and a lineal descendant of Ute\n       blood. The Ute Tribe is a small tribe with less than 4,000 members.\n       Unremitting tribal membership is an integral part of the Tribe’s ability to\n       sustain its lineage and culture. The Defendant is liable in damages for such\n       loss.\n\n        In response to the amended complaint, defendant, again, filed a motion to dismiss\nboth counts pursuant to RCFC 12(b)(1) and RCFC 12(b)(6), for lack of subject matter\njurisdiction, and failure to state a claim, respectively. For count one, defendant contends\nthat the violation of the Ute Treaties should be dismissed “for lack of jurisdiction and for\nfailure to state a claim.” Defendant argues that “[p]laintiffs have not complied with the\nterms of the Treaty and have not exhausted the administrative remedies required by the\nexpress terms of the Treaty.” Defendant contends that even if the court found jurisdiction\nunder the “bad men” provision12 of the 1868 Treaty with the Utes, “plaintiffs do not state\na cognizable claim under the ‘bad men’ provision.” For count two, defendant contends\nthat, “[p]laintiffs’ breach-of-trust claims are barred by the United States’ sovereign\nimmunity because plaintiffs did not allege the violation of a specific statutory or regulatory\nmoney-mandating duty,” and that the Treaties involved “do not impose a nondiscretionary\nfiduciary duty upon the United States to prosecute alleged ‘bad men’ without exercising\nits prosecutorial discretion.”\n\n                                       DISCUSSION\n\nBackground of the Ute Treaties\n\n\n      Many of the plaintiffs’ claims center on particular provisions of two treaties\nexecuted, and ratified, in the mid-19th century. The first treaty was concluded on October\n7, 1863. See Treaty with the Utah Tabeguache Band, October 7, 1863, 13 Stat. 673\n\n12 Both defendant and plaintiffs use the phrases “bad men” provision and “bad men”\nclause, in their filings. For simplicity, unless quoting directly, the court adopts the phrase\n“bad men” provision.\n                                             13\n\f(referred to by the parties as the 1863 Treaty).13 Through the 1863 Treaty, the\nTabeguache Band of Ute Indians ceded their rights and interest to vast tracts of land in\nthe Western United States. See id. Article 1 of the 1863 Treaty states: “It is admitted by\nthe Tabeguache band of Utah Indians that they reside within the territorial limits of the\nUnited States, acknowledging their supremacy, and claim their protection. The said band\nalso admits the right of the United States to regulate all trade and intercourse with them.”\nArticle 2 of the 1863 Treaty states, in part: “Said Tabeguache band of Utah Indians hereby\ncede, convey, and relinquish all of their claim, right, title, and interest in and to any and\nall of their lands within the territory of the United States, wherever situated, excepting that\nwhich is included within the following boundaries. . . .” Id. In return: “[f]or the period of ten\nyears the said band shall receive, annually, by such distribution as the Secretary of the\nInterior may direct, ten thousand dollars' worth of goods, and also ten thousand dollars'\nworth of provisions.” Id.\n\n       Article 10 of the 1863 Treaty provides:\n\n       Each family that shall announce through its head to the agent of the band a\n       willingness and determination to begin and follow the pursuits of agriculture,\n       by farming or raising stock and growing wool, upon such lands and\n       according to such regulations as the Secretary of the Interior may prescribe,\n       shall receive the following donations of stock to aid them in their endeavor\n       to gain a livelihood by such new pursuits, viz.:\n\n       Of cattle, one head annually during five years, beginning with the ratification\n       of this treaty.\n\n       Of sheep, ten head annually during the first two years after the ratification\n       of this treaty, and five head annually during the three years thereafter.\n\n       The Secretary of the Interior may also direct that their share of annuity\n       goods and provisions shall be of a character suited to such change of life:\n       Provided, however, That such stock shall only be donated as long as such\n       family shall in good faith keep and use the same for the purpose indicated\n       in this article.\n\n       All the Indians of said band who may adopt and conform to the provisions\n       of this article shall be protected in the quiet and peaceable possession of\n       their said lands and property.\n\nId. (emphasis in original).\n\n\n\n\n13On March 25, 1864, the United States Senate advised ratification, with amendments,\nwhich were assented to by the Tribe on October 8, 1864. See 13 Stat. 673. The 1863\nTreaty was then signed by President Lincoln on December 14, 1864. See id.\n                                               14\n\f       In March of 1868, the United States concluded another treaty with the Ute. See\nTreaty with the Ute, March 2, 1868, 15 Stat. 619 (referred to by the parties as the 1868\nTreaty).14 As noted in the preamble and Article 1 of the 1868 Treaty:\n\n       Articles of a treaty and agreement made and entered into at Washington\n       City, D.C., on the second day of March, one thousand eight hundred and\n       sixty-eight, by and between Nathaniel G. Taylor, Commissioner of Indian\n       Affairs, Alexander C. Hunt, governor of Colorado Territory and ex-officio\n       superintendent of Indian affairs, and Kit Carson, duly authorized to\n       represent the United States, of the one part, and the representatives of the\n       Tabaquache[15], Muache, Capote, Weeminuche, Yampa, Grand River, and\n       Uintah bands of Ute Indians, (whose names are hereto subscribed,) duly\n       authorized and empowered to act for the body of the people of said bands,\n       of the other part, witness:\n\n       Article I. All the provisions of the treaty concluded with the Tabequache\n       band of Utah Indians, October seventh, one thousand eight hundred and\n       sixty-three, as amended by the Senate of the United States and proclaimed\n       December fourteenth, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-four, which are\n       not inconsistent with the provisions of this treaty, as hereinafter provided,\n       are hereby reaffirmed and declared to be applicable and to continue in force\n       as well to the other bands, respectively, parties to this treaty, as to the\n       Tabequache band of Utah Indians.\n\nId. Article 2 of the 1868 Treaty states, in part:\n\n       [T]he United States now solemnly agree that no persons, except those\n       herein authorized so to do, and except such officers, agents, and employes\n       [sic] of the Government as may be authorized to enter upon Indian\n       reservations in discharge of duties enjoined by law shall ever be permitted\n       to pass over, settle upon, or reside in the Territory described in this article,\n       except as herein otherwise provided.\n\nId. Art. 2. The 1868 Treaty reaffirmed and incorporated the provisions of the 1863 Treaty,\nbut also created new guarantees and promises. For example, Article 5 the 1868 Treaty\nestablished how to resolve “depredation on person or property”:\n\n       The United States agree that the agents for said Indians, in the future, shall\n       make their homes at the agency buildings; that they shall reside among the\n\n\n14On July 25, 1868, the United States Senate advised ratification, with amendments,\nwhich were assented to by the Tribe in August and September 1868. See 15 Stat. 619.\nThe 1868 Treaty was then signed by President Johnson on November 6, 1868. See id.\n15Although the 1868 Treaty uses the spelling “Tabaquache” in the preamble, all other\nspellings of the Tribe are “Tabequache.”\n                                              15\n\f        Indians, and keep an office open at all times for the purpose of prompt and\n        diligent inquiry into such matters of complaint by and against the Indians,\n        as may be presented for investigation under the provisions of their treaty\n        stipulations, as also for the faithful discharge of other duties enjoined on\n        them by law. In all cases of depredation on person or property, they shall\n        cause the evidence to be taken in writing and forwarded, together with their\n        finding, to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, whose decision, subject to\n        the revision of the Secretary of the Interior, shall be binding on the parties\n        to this treaty.\n\nId. Art. 5. Article 6 states in full:\n\n        If bad men among the whites or among other people, subject to the authority\n        of the United States, shall commit any wrong upon the person or property\n        of the Indians, the United States will, upon proof made to the agent and\n        forwarded to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs at Washington City,\n        proceed at once to cause the offender to be arrested and punished\n        according to the laws of the United States, and also reimburse the injured\n        person for the loss sustained.\n\n        If bad men among the Indians shall commit a wrong or depredation upon\n        the person or property of any one, white, black, or Indian, subject to the\n        authority of the United States and at peace therewith, the tribes herein\n        named solemnly agree that they will, on proof made to their agent and\n        notice to him, deliver up the wrongdoer to the United States, to be tried and\n        punished according to its laws, and in case they wilfully refuse so to do the\n        person injured shall be reimbursed for his loss from the annuities or other\n        moneys due or to become due to them under this or other treaties made\n        with the United States.\n\nId. Art. 6. This provision is often referred to by courts and litigants as the “bad men”\nprovision. “Bad men” provisions are common in Native American treaties of this time\nperiod, and appear to have been fairly standard in Native American treaties during the\n19th century. As explained by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit\nin Tsosie v. United States, 825 F.2d 393 (Fed. Cir. 1987):\n\n        The treaty in question [the Navajo Treaty] is one of nine made in 1868, by and\n        between commissioners representing the United States and chiefs of various\n        previously hostile Indian tribes. The treaties were all duly ratified, proclaimed, and\n        published in volume fifteen of the Statutes at Large. All say that peace is their\n        object and all contain “bad men” articles in similar language.\n\nId. at 395; see also Elk v. United States, 87 Fed. Cl. 70, 81 & 81 n.16 (2009) (noting that\nother 1868 treaties “contain ‘bad men’ clauses identical to that in the Sioux Treaty, citing\nthe Najavo Treaty and noting the earlier 1868 Ute Treaty), appeal dismissed, 449 F.

Further, plaintiffs contend that “[t]he United States\nagreed to protect and reimburse the Ute Indians for all harm, injury, unjust, or unmerited\ntreatment inflicted upon any tribal member or tribal property by non-whites on the\nreservation,” but that the United States failed to honor its obligations under the 1868\nTreaty by not investigating and prosecuting the alleged wrongdoers.\n\nJurisdiction\n        Defendant argues that this court lacks jurisdiction over plaintiffs’ case because\nplaintiffs have not complied with the terms of the 1868 Ute Treaty, and further argues that\nplaintiffs have not stated a cognizable claim under the “bad men” provision.

In Ontario Power Generation,\nInc. v.

See Ontario Power Generation, Inc. v. United States, 369 F.3d 1298,\n1301 (Fed. Cir. 2004). The court wrote:\n       The underlying monetary claims are of three types. . . . First, claims alleging\n       the existence of a contract between the plaintiff and the government fall\n       within the Tucker Act’s waiver. . . . Second, the Tucker Act’s waiver\n       encompasses claims where “the plaintiff has paid money over to the\n       Government, directly or in effect, and seeks return of all or part of that sum.”\n       Eastport S.S. [Corp. v. United States, 178 Ct. Cl. 599, 605–06,] 372 F.2d\n       [1002,] 1007-08 [(1967)] (describing illegal exaction claims as claims “in\n       which ‘the Government has the citizen’s money in its pocket’” (quoting\n       Clapp v. United States, 127 Ct. Cl. 505, 117 F. Supp. 576, 580 (1954))\n       . . . . Third, the Court of Federal Claims has jurisdiction over those claims\n       where “money has not been paid but the plaintiff asserts that he is\n       nevertheless entitled to a payment from the treasury.” Eastport S.S., 372\n       F.2d at 1007. Claims in this third category, where no payment has been\n       made to the government, either directly or in effect, require that the\n       “particular provision of law relied upon grants the claimant, expressly or by\n       implication, a right to be paid a certain sum.” Id.; see also [United States v.\n       ]Testan, 424 U.S. [392,] 401-02 [(1976)] (“Where the United States is the\n       defendant and the plaintiff is not suing for money improperly exacted or\n       retained, the basis of the federal claim-whether it be the Constitution, a\n       statute, or a regulation-does not create a cause of action for money\n       damages unless, as the Court of Claims has stated, that basis ‘in itself . . .\n       can fairly be interpreted as mandating compensation by the Federal\n       Government for the damage sustained.’” (quoting Eastport S.S., 372 F.2d\n       at 1009)). This category is commonly referred to as claims brought under a\n       “money-mandating” statute.\nOntario Power Generation, Inc. v.

As\nalso discussed further below, the “bad men” provision of the 1868 Ute Treaty provides a\nbasis for jurisdiction in this court.\n\n\n                                             21\n\fAdministrative Exhaustion\n\n        Defendant argues that administrative exhaustion is a “jurisdictional prerequisite” to\njudicial review. The defendant relies on language in the 1868 Ute Treaty, which reads:\n\n       In all cases of depredation on person or property, they shall cause the\n       evidence to be taken in writing and forwarded, together with their finding, to\n       the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, whose decision, subject to the revision\n       of the Secretary of the Interior, shall be binding on the parties to this [1868]\n       treaty.\n\n1868 Treaty, Art. 5. Defendant contends that this language mandates full administrative\nreview, allowing the Department of the Interior an opportunity to issue a “binding decision”\nbefore a plaintiff can seek relief from the courts. Defendant states that “throughout the six\nyears following Mr. Murray’s death, Plaintiffs have had every opportunity to present a ‘bad\nmen’ claim to the Department of the Interior (‘DOI’), as agreed upon by both the Tribe and\nthe United States. See Treaty with the Ute Indians, 15 Stat. 619 (1868). Plaintiffs have\nnot.” (internal citation omitted). According to defendant, “plaintiffs have not complied with\nthe terms of the Treaty and have not exhausted the administrative remedies required by\nthe express terms of the Treaty.” As a consequence, defendant argues,\n\n       DOI has not been provided with an opportunity to “cause the evidence to be\n       taken in writing and forwarded, together with [the government agent’s]\n       finding, to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, whose decision, subject to\n       the revision of the Secretary of the Interior, shall be binding on the parties\n       to this treaty.” Art. 5, 1868 Treaty. Having failed to exhaust their\n       administrative remedies, Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint should be\n       dismissed.\n\n(alterations in original). Defendant urges this court to dismiss plaintiffs’ claims in the\nUnited States Court of Federal Claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n\n        In response, plaintiffs argue they have satisfied the exhaustion requirements of the\ntreaty by way of their March 12, 2013 letter to Department of the Interior officials, placing\nthe Department of the Interior on notice of plaintiffs’ intention to file suit in this court.\nPlaintiffs allege that the court “has previously analyzed this specific bad men treaty clause\nand has held that the only prerequisite required before suit is filed is that a notice of claim\nmust be sent to the agency and a copy be sent to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs in\nWashington.” Moreover, plaintiffs argue that the exhaustion requirement is non-\njurisdictional, maintaining that any requirement to exhaust administrative remedies is\npurely prudential and, therefore, subject to the court’s discretion.\n\n       “The doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies is one among related\ndoctrines—including abstention, finality, and ripeness—that govern the timing of federal-\ncourt decision making.” McCarthy v. Madigan, 503 U.S. 140, 144 (1992), superseded by\nstatute as recognized in Garrett v. Hawk, 127 F.3d 1263 (10th Cir. 1997).

Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 88 (2006); Sandvik Steel Co. v.\nUnited States, 164 F.3d 596, 599 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (The general rule is that “no one is\nentitled to judicial relief for a supposed or threatened injury until the prescribed\nadministrative remedy has been exhausted.”); Burlington N. R.R. Co. v. United States,\n752 F.2d 627, 629 (Fed. Cir. 1985).\n      “Exhaustion of administrative remedies serves two main purposes.” Woodford v.\nNgo, 548 U.S. at 89; In re DBC, 545 F.3d 1373, 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2008). As described by\nthe United States Supreme Court, the first, and primary, purpose is the development of a\nproper factual background:\n       A primary purpose is, of course, the avoidance of premature interruption of\n       the administrative process. The agency, like a trial court, is created for the\n       purpose of applying a statute in the first instance. Accordingly, it is normally\n       desirable to let the agency develop the necessary factual background upon\n       which decisions should be based. And since agency decisions are\n       frequently of a discretionary nature or frequently require expertise, the\n       agency should be given the first chance to exercise that discretion or to\n       apply that expertise.\nMcKart v. United States, 395 U.S. at 193–94; see also Kappos v. Hyatt, 132 S. Ct. 1690,\n1692 (2012) (noting that “‘the avoidance of premature interruption of the administrative\nprocess’” is the “primary purpose” of the doctrine of administrative exhaustion). Under this\ntheory, “[t]he administrative agency is created as a separate entity and invested with\ncertain powers and duties. The courts ordinarily should not interfere with an agency until\nit has completed its action, or else has clearly exceeded its jurisdiction.” McKart v. United\nStates, 395 U.S. at 194. “Exhaustion gives an agency ‘an opportunity to correct its own\nmistakes with respect to the programs it administers before it is hauled into federal court,’\nand it discourages ‘disregard of [the agency's] procedures.’” Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S.\nat 89 (quoting McKart v. United States, 395 U.S. at 195) (alteration in original); In re DBC,\n545 F.3d at 1378; see also Kentucky v. United States, 62 Fed. Cl. 445, 453 (2004)\n(“‘When administrative remedies have not been exhausted, “judicial review of\nadministrative action is inappropriate,” since it is “a general rule that courts should not\ntopple over administrative decisions unless the administrative body not only has erred but\nhas erred against objection made at the time appropriate under its practice.”’” (quoting\nSandvik Steel Co. v. United States, 164 F.3d at 599 (quoting Sharp Corp. v. United States,\n837 F.2d 1058, 1062 (Fed. Cir. 1988))), aff’d, 424 F.3d 1222 (Fed. Cir. 2005); see also\nMcCarthy v. Madigan, 503 U.S. at 145 (“Correlatively, exhaustion principles apply with\nspecial force when ‘frequent and deliberate flouting of administrative processes’ could\nweaken an agency's effectiveness by encouraging disregard of its procedures.” (quoting\nMcKart v. United States, 395 U.S. at 195)).\n\n     The second purpose for requiring exhaustion of administrative remedies is judicial\neconomy. “And of course it is generally more efficient for the administrative process to go\n\n                                              23\n\fforward without interruption than it is to permit the parties to seek aid from the courts at\nvarious intermediate stages.” McKart v. United States, 395 U.S. at 194. “Claims generally\ncan be resolved much more quickly and economically in proceedings before an agency\nthan in litigation in federal court. In some cases, claims are settled at the administrative\nlevel, and in others, the proceedings before the agency convince the losing party not to\npursue the matter in federal court.” Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. at 88; see also McCarthy\nv. Madigan, 503 U.S. at 145 (“When an agency has the opportunity to correct its own\nerrors, a judicial controversy may well be mooted, or at least piecemeal appeals may be\navoided.”). “And it can serve judicial efficiency by promoting development of an agency\nrecord that is adequate for later court review and by giving an agency a full opportunity to\ncorrect errors and thereby narrow or even eliminate disputes needing judicial resolution.”\nItochu Bldg.

Salfi,\n422 U.S. 749 (1975) (the doctrine of administrative exhaustion may allow an agency “to\ncompile a record which is adequate for judicial review”).\n         “Proper exhaustion demands compliance with an agency's deadlines and other\ncritical procedural rules because no adjudicative system can function effectively without\nimposing some orderly structure on the course of its proceedings.” Woodford v. Ngo, 548\nU.S. at 90-91; see also Arctic Slope Native Assoc., Ltd. v. Sebelius, 583 F.3d 785, 793\n(Fed.

Cl. 465, 473 (2010). “The fact that the\nadministrative remedy was provided by a regulation rather than by a statute does not\nmake the exhaustion doctrine inapplicable or inappropriate.” Sandvik Steel Co. v. United\nStates, 164 F.3d at 600; see also Itochu Bldg. Products v. United States, 733 F.3d at\n1145 n.1 (“Failure to exploit an available agency remedy, even if not specifically required,\ncan constitute a failure to exhaust in appropriate circumstances.” (citing Corus Staal BV\nv. United States, 502 F.3d 1370, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (“The exhaustion requirement in\nthis context is therefore not simply a creature of court decision, as is sometimes the case,\nbut is a requirement explicitly imposed by the agency as a prerequisite to judicial\nreview.\")).\n         The facts of a particular case, however, can call for an exception to otherwise\nrequiring administrative exhaustion. See, e.g., McKart v. United States, 395 U.S. at 197\n(“We cannot agree that application of the exhaustion doctrine would be proper in the\ncircumstances of the present case.”). “‘[A]dministrative remedies need not be pursued if\nthe litigant's interests in immediate judicial review outweigh the government's interests in\nthe efficiency or administrative autonomy that the exhaustion doctrine is designed to\nfurther.’” McCarthy v.

United States, 502 F.3d at 1381; Bernklau v. Principi, 291 F.3d\n795, 801 (Fed. Cir. 2002).\n        Plaintiffs allege the exhaustion requirement has been satisfied by the notice of their\nintent to file suit against the United States indicated in the March 12, 2013 letter\naddressed to senior officials at the Department of the Interior. The March 12, 2013 letter\nstates:\n\n       Dear Messrs. Toulou, Smith, and Washburn and Secretary of the Interior:\n\n       Our law firm represents the Ute Indian Tribe of the Uintah and Ouray\n       Reservation (“Tribe” or “Ute Tribe”). We also represent tribal members\n       Debra Jones and Arden Post who are the parents of Todd Murray, a tribal\n       member who was shot to death in an encounter with Utah state and local\n       police on the Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation in Utah (“U&O\n       Reservation”) in 2007. Please accept this letter as our notice of claim to\n       your respective agencies of our intent to file a complaint against the United\n       States based on breaches of the 1863 and 1868 Ute Treaties and the United\n       States’ violation of its trust obligations to the Ute Tribe and its members.\n\n       We plan to file suit in the Federal Court of Claims and allege that the Federal\n       Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), by and\n       through their employees, committed wrongs upon the person or property of\n       the Indians, namely decedent Todd Murray his family and the Ute Indian\n       Tribe as a whole. Included with our letter are the Plaintiffs’ (i) Third\n       Amended Complaint, (ii) motion for default judgment on liability based on\n       tampering [sic] destruction of critical evidence, and (iii) motion for summary\n       judgment under Counts 1, 3 and 5 filed in the parents’ private cause of\n       action, DEBRA JONES, et al., v, VANCE NORTON, et al., Civil Case No.\n       2:09-cv-00730, U.S. District Court, District of Utah, Central Division.\n\n       The attached filings give an overview of the sequence of events that\n       transpired on April 1, 2007 as well as a clear indication of the egregious\n       actions of the law enforcement officers who participated in this\n       “investigation.” The FBI and the BIA representatives who were present on\n       April 1, 2007 and who participated in the “investigation” contributed to the\n       travesties by (1) failing to protect the Ute Tribe’s interests as a sovereign in\n       the crime scene, (2) failing to properly preserve and protect evidence from\n       being tampered with and destroyed, and (3) failing to conduct their own\n       independent investigation into the death of Todd Murray. As a result of the\n       aforementioned failures, the Murray family and the Ute Indian Tribe are\n\n                                             25\n\f       seeking damages from the United States in the amount of $10 million, as\n       well as reimbursement of litigation costs and attorney fees.\n\n       Attached to this letter is a summary of the relevant Treaty obligations that\n       have been violated by the actions and inactions of the United States in this\n       case. Under Article 6 of the 1863 Treaty, the Ute Indian bands agreed to\n       forego “private revenge or retaliation” for injuries suffered by the Tribe and\n       individual tribal members as the result of the “misconduct of individuals.” In\n       return the United States guaranteed the Tribe and individual tribal members\n       a right to legal redress for “any robbery violence, or murder” committed “on\n       an Indian or Indians” belonging to the Ute Indian bands. Article 6 of the 1868\n       Treaty promised that any person violating the territorial integrity of the\n       Reservation and causing harm to the Tribe or its tribal members would be\n       “punished according to the laws of the United States.” In violation of these\n       treaty obligations, the United States has failed to investigate or to prosecute\n       the individuals involved in the shooting death of 21 year-old Todd Murray in\n       April 2007, and the subsequent conspiracy to suppress, alter, and destroy\n       critical evidence.\n\n       Please feel free to contact our office should you require any additional\n       information regarding this forthcoming claim.\n\n\n       Sincerely,\n\n       Sandra L. Denton\n\n(footnote omitted). As noted above, the March 12, 2013 letter attached almost four\nhundred pages of exhibits, including filings in the District Court such as the plaintiffs’ third\namended complaint, plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment, and plaintiffs’ motion for\ntampering and destruction of critical evidence.\n\n       In Elk v. United States, 70 Fed. Cl. 405 (2006), the United States Court of Federal\nClaims addressed a similar issue of exhaustion as is raised by defendants in the current\ncase under review by this court, albeit under a different treaty, and found no jurisdictional\nrequirement to exhaust administrative remedies. In Elk v. United States, a member of the\nOglala Sioux Tribe brought suit after she was sexually assaulted by a United States Army\nrecruiter in a remote area of the reservation. See id. at 406. The “bad men” provision of\nthe 1868 Sioux treaty, served as the legal basis for the plaintiff’s complaint. As in the\npresent action, the Elk plaintiff claimed to have been “wronged” by “bad men” and sought\nreimbursement from the United States. Id. at 405. The government in Elk moved to\ndismiss plaintiff’s claim, arguing that the treaty required “proof” to be “made to the agent\nand forwarded to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs at Washington City,” and that this,\nas a textual matter, plainly suggested a jurisdictional requirement to exhaust\nadministrative remedies. See id. While recognizing the requirements that the language\nimposed, the court ultimately held that the plaintiff did not have to await a formal\n\n                                              26\n\fadministrative decision from the agency before bringing suit. See id. at 407. After careful\nreview of the relevant provisions of the 1868 Sioux treaty, the Elk court held that formal\nadministrative exhaustion was not a prerequisite to bringing suit, concluding that “nothing\nin the Sioux Treaty indicates that a claimant must await a decision from Interior before\nfiling suit.” Id. The Elk court determined that “under well established principles, a statute\nor other Congressional enactment creates an independent duty to exhaust only when it\ncontains ‘sweeping and direct’ statutory language indicating that there is no federal\njurisdiction prior to exhaustion, or the exhaustion requirement is treated as an element of\nthe underlying claim.” Id. Because the 1868 Sioux Treaty at issue contained no such\nlanguage, the Elk court declined to require exhaustion as a prerequisite to judicial\njurisdiction.18\n\n       A predecessor court to the Court of Federal Claims previously found, under the\nspecific facts of the case, that exhaustion of administrative remedies was a jurisdictional\nrequirement when specific treaty language both (1) unmistakably mandates\nadministrative review by an executive agency and (2) sets forth a procedure for so doing.\nSee Begay v. United States, 219 Ct. Cl. 599 (1979); see also Tsosie v. United States, 11\nCl. Ct. 62 (1986), aff’d and remanded, 825 F.2d 393 (Fed. Cir. 1987). In Begay, the\nparents of female boarding school students administered by the BIA brought suit after\ndiscovering that their daughters had been sexually assaulted by some of the faculty. Id.\nat 600. Plaintiffs claimed that the sexual assault was a “wrong” inflicted by “bad men” and,\ntherefore, sought reimbursement from the United States. The “bad men” provision of the\n\n\n18 The court notes that defendant in the above captioned case, like the defendant in Elk,\ncites to the unpublished opinion in Zephier v. United States, No. 03-768L (Fed. Cl. Oct.\n29, 2004). The Elk court wrote as follows:\n\n       The other case cited by defendant, the unpublished opinion in Zephier, et\n       al. v. United States, No. 03–768L (Fed. Cl. Oct. 29, 2004), concerned a\n       situation in which the plaintiff did not file a claim with Interior under the Sioux\n       Treaty before filing suit. This court dismissed the complaint for lack of\n       jurisdiction, finding that “the courts either have found that the plain language\n       of the treaties mandates exhaustion of administrative remedies or have\n       accepted without question that such remedies are available.” Id. at 13. But,\n       with all due respect, the latter statement does not flow from the analysis that\n       precedes it, which, inter alia, overlooks several key distinctions. For\n       example, while the court noted the significant differences between the\n       Navajo and Sioux treaties, id. at 12 n.4, it freely cited cases involving the\n       former as precedent for construing the latter—a non sequitur. And while it\n       suggested that Begay II is not precedential, id. at 11, but rather only\n       persuasive, id. at 11 n.3, it, nonetheless, proceeded to apply that case as if\n       it had resolved definitively the precise issue before the court, doing so\n       largely without further independent analysis of the exhaustion issue.\n\nElk v. United States, 70 Fed. Cl. at 411. Therefore, the Elk court determined, “[a]t best,\nthen, Zephier is inapposite; at all events, its analysis is unpersuasive. Id.\n                                               27\n\fNavajo Treaty of 1868, served as the legal basis for the plaintiffs’ complaint. After careful\nreview of the treaty’s provisions, the court suspended litigation and granted the\nDepartment of Interior a period of ninety days to issue a decision on the matter. Id. at\n602-03. In making this determination, the court relied on a passage in the Navajo Treaty\nof 1868, which provided:\n\n         [T]he President may prescribe such rules and regulations for ascertaining\n         damages under this article as in his judgment may be proper; but no such\n         damage shall be adjusted and paid until examined and passed upon by the\n         Commissioner of Indian Affairs.\n\nTreaty with the Navajo, June 1, 1868, 15 Stat. 667, Art. 1.\n\n        The Begay court found this provision to be particularly dispositive. In light of the\nclear and unambiguous language, which withheld damages until “examined and passed\nupon” by the agency, the court found the requirement of exhaustion to be jurisdictional,\nand, therefore, the Begay court declined to assert jurisdiction over a “bad men” claim “in\nview of the specific references in [the treaty] to administrative consideration . . . .” Begay\nv. United States, 219 Ct. Cl. at 602. Likewise, in Tsosie v. United States, 11 Cl. Ct. 62,\nthe court in reviewing the “bad men” provision of the Navajo Treaty of 1868 concluded\nthat “there must first be an administrative decision by the Department of the Interior,”\nbefore submitting a claim to the judiciary. Id. at 75 (citing Begay v. United States, 219 Ct.\nCl. at 602).\n\n        When comparing the Sioux and the Navajo Treaties side by side, the treaties differ\nwith respect to an exhaustion requirement, as reflected in the decisions discussed above.\nCompare Elk v. United States, 70 Fed. Cl. at 407, with Begay v. United States, 219 Ct.\nCl. at 602, and, Tsosie v. United States, 11 Cl. Ct. at 75. The court in Elk addressed the\ndifferences, ultimately concluding that the Navajo Treaty is unique in precluding the\npayment of damages until the claim is “thoroughly examined and passed upon” by the\nagency. See Elk v. United States, 70 Fed. Cl. at 407.19 The Sioux Treaty contains no such\nlimitation. Id. Furthermore, the court in Elk observed that the Sioux Treaty “neither\nspecifies the particulars of the proof that should be supplied [to the agency] nor indicates\nthat the claimant must wait any particular time for an agency to respond to her claim.” Id.\n\n\n\n\n19   The court notes that the Elk court observed that:\n\n         [T]he court in Begay I, denied its motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' complaint\n         and retained jurisdiction while ordering the Assistant Secretary of Interior to\n         render an opinion within 90 days. Id. at 603. The Begay orders thus hardly\n         stands [sic] for the proposition that a claimant must obtain an actual decision\n         from Interior before bringing suit under the Tucker Act.\n\nElk v. United States, 70 Fed. Cl. at 411 (emphasis in original).\n                                               28\n\f        The language of the 1868 Ute Treaty more closely resembles the language of the\nSioux Treaty than the Navajo Treaty. The Ute Treaty also contains no “sweeping and\ndirect language,” requiring administrative exhaustion. Unlike the Navajo Treaty, the Ute\nTreaty does not withhold damages until “passed upon” by the Department of the Interior.\nSee Elk v. United States, 70 Fed. Cl. at 407. Nor does the Ute Treaty specify the manner\nand means for bringing a claim in court. Article 5 of the Ute Treaty states only:\n\n       In all cases of depredation on person or property, they shall cause the\n       evidence to be taken in writing and forwarded, together with their finding, to\n       the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, whose decision, subject to the revision\n       of the Secretary of the Interior, shall be binding on the parties to this treaty.\n\nAs noted above, although the 1868 Ute Treaty requires evidence of any depredation or\nwrong “to be taken in writing and forwarded together with their finding to the\nCommissioner of Indian Affairs,” 1868 Treaty, Art. 5, forwarding such evidence is the “only\nprerequisite to suit required by the treaty.” Hebah v. United States, 428 F.2d 1334, 1340,\n192 Ct. Cl. 785 (1970) (Hebah I).\n\n        In the March 12, 2013 letter, plaintiffs specifically identified the 1868 Ute Treaty,\nand indicated “[p]lease accept this letter as our notice of claim to your respective agencies\nof our intent to file a complaint against the United States based on breaches of the 1863\nand 1868 Ute Treaties and the United States’ violation of its trust obligations to the Ute\nTribe and its members.” The March 12, 2013 letter also indicated, “[a]ttached to this letter\nis a summary of the relevant Treaty obligations that have been violated by the actions\nand inactions of the United States in this case.”\n\n         In addition, the March 12, 2013 letter identified the wrong plaintiffs alleged, with\nplaintiffs’ counsel indicating “[w]e also represent tribal members Debra Jones and Arden\nPost who are the parents of Todd Murray, a tribal member who was shot to death in an\nencounter with Utah state and local police on the Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation in\nUtah (U&O Reservation) in 2007.” Plaintiffs identified the agencies which allegedly had\ncommitted the improper acts, and stated that the “Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the\nBureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), by and through their employees, committed wrongs upon\nthe person or property of the Indians, namely decedent Todd Murray.” The March 12,\n2013 letter, while not providing additional details about the death of Mr. Murray, included\nas attachments selected filings from the District Court litigation, which, as plaintiffs\nindicated, “give an overview of the sequence of events that transpired on April 1, 2007 as\nwell as a clear indication of the egregious actions of the law enforcement officers who\nparticipated in this ‘investigation.’”\n\n        Although plaintiffs’ counsel could have provided more narrative detail about the\ndeath of Mr. Murray in the March 12, 2013 letter to more fully amplify on the “proof”\nrequirement, the court believes the letter labelled “notice of claim” sent to the Department\nof Interior, together with the exhibits attached to the letter, satisfied the plaintiffs’\nexhaustion requirements under the specific facts presented in the above captioned case.\nMoreover, the United States was aware of the death of Mr. Murray in 2007, and the record\n\n                                              29\n\freflects that no criminal prosecutions of Special Agent Rex Ashdown and David Ryan of\nthe FBI or the various officials present at the scene from the BIA occurred, suggesting the\ndecision not to prosecute reflects the view of the United States. There was a “federal\ncriminal matter involving the [Mr. Murray’s] firearm,” in which “[t]he purchaser pled guilty\nin federal court to a charge of making a false statement in connection with the purchase\nof the firearm.” Jones et al. v. Norton, et al., 2014 WL 909569, at *4. In addition, on\nFebruary 1, 2011, one of the attorneys from plaintiffs’ counsel’s firm sent the Department\nof Justice, specifically, the Director of the Office of Tribal Justice and the Chief of the Civil\nRights Division, a letter titled: “The Shooting Death of Todd Murray, Ute Indian tribal\nmember Jones v. Norton, et al., Case No. 2:09-cv-00730 U.S. District Court for the District\nof Utah, Central Division And the Continued Violation of Criminal Law Enforcement\nJurisdiction on the Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation, and the Continued Harassment,\nRacial Targeting, and Violation of Tribal Members’ Civil Rights by Utah State, County,\nand Local Law Enforcement Officers.” The letter provided background information to the\nDepartment of Justice about Mr. Murray’s death and noted that “no officer-involved\nshooting investigation was conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the State\nof Utah, the County of Uintah, Vernal City, or any disinterested party.” The letter\nconcluded:\n\n       In summary, by this letter we are requesting that the Department of Justice\n       conduct an investigation into the actions of Utah state/county/local law\n       enforcement agencies and officers for violations of the Ute Treaty of 1868\n       and any other applicable federal law. Unfortunately, this is not the Tribe’s\n       first request for a federal investigation. See attached letters dated February\n       14, 2011, and March 18, 2011. In the year since these letters were sent, the\n       conduct of Utah state, county and local police has only gotten worse. I would\n       appreciate communication from your respective offices on our investigation\n       requests.\n\n(internal citation omitted).\n\n       Even when exhaustion requirements have not been met, the United States\nSupreme Court has found exceptions to the exhaustion doctrine in “at least three broad\nsets of circumstances in which the interests of the individual weigh heavily against\nrequiring administrative exhaustion.” See McCarthy v. Madigan, 503 U.S. at 146.20 The\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, in Wilson ex rel. Estate of Wilson\nv. United States, summarized the three exceptions articulated by the United States\nSupreme Court, as follows:\n\n       The [United States Supreme] Court went on to explain three sets of\n       circumstances in which the interests of the individual weigh heavily against\n       requiring administrative exhaustion: (1) where there is an unreasonable or\n\n\n20The Supreme Court, noted, however “this Court has declined to require exhaustion in\nsome circumstances even where administrative and judicial interests would counsel\notherwise.” McCarthy v. Madigan, 503 U.S. at 146.\n                                               30\n\f       indefinite timeframe for administrative action; (2) where there is some doubt\n       as to whether the agency is empowered to grant effective relief; and (3)\n       where the administrative body is shown to be biased or has otherwise\n       predetermined the issue before it.\nWilson ex rel. Estate of Wilson v. United, 405 F.3d 1002, 1011 (Fed. Cir. 2005). The\ndetermination of when and how to apply an exception to the general exhaustion doctrine\nis highly case specific and emphasizes practicality, keeping in mind the overall balance\nof “‘the interest of the individual in retaining prompt access to a federal judicial forum,’”\nwith “deciding when exhaustion is demanded in order to protect ‘institutional interests.’”\nSee Itochu Bldg. Products v. United States, 733 F.3d at 1145 (quoting McCarthy v.\nMadigan, 503 U.S. at 146 (“In determining whether exhaustion is required, federal courts\nmust balance the interest of the individual in retaining prompt access to a federal judicial\nforum against countervailing institutional interests favoring exhaustion. . . . Application of\nthis balancing principle is ‘intensely practical,’” (quoting Bowen v. City of New York, 476\nU.S. 467, 484 (1986))); Rollock Co. v. United States, 115 Fed. Cl. 317, 322 (2014); Elk v.\nUnited States, 70 Fed. Cl. at 408.\n        “First, exhaustion may not be required when exhaustion of the administrative\nremedy may prejudice the plaintiff,” such as “‘from an unreasonable or indefinite\ntimeframe for administrative action.’” See Itochu Bldg. Products v. United States, 733 F.3d\nat 1145 (quoting McCarthy v. Madigan, 503 U.S. at 147). “Even where the administrative\ndecisionmaking schedule is otherwise reasonable and definite, a particular plaintiff may\nsuffer irreparable harm if unable to secure immediate judicial consideration of his claim.”\nMcCarthy v. Madigan, 503 U.S. at 147. In Gibson v. Berryhill, 411 U.S. 564, 575 n.14\n(1973), although discussing state administrative remedies, the United States Supreme\nCourt wrote: “State administrative remedies have been deemed inadequate by federal\ncourts and hence not subject to the exhaustion requirement . . . [m]ost often . . . because\nof delay by the agency . . . .” Such delay is not characterized by any specific time limit in\nwhich to respond to claims. See, e.g., Walker v. Southern Ry. Co., 385 U.S. 196, 198\n(1966), reh'g denied, 385 U.S. 1020 (1967) (holding that plaintiffs are not required to wait\nten years or more on the administrative board to decide their claim); Smith v. Illinois Bell\nTel. Co., 270 U.S. 587, 591–592 (1926) (finding that an injured public service company\n“is not required indefinitely to await a decision of the rate-making tribunal before applying\nto a federal court . . . .”).\n         “Second, an administrative remedy may be inadequate ‘because of some doubt as\nto whether the agency was empowered to grant effective relief.’” McCarthy v. Madigan,\n503 U.S. at 147 (quoting Gibson v. Berryhill, 411 U.S. at 575 n.14); Elk v. United States,\n70 Fed. Cl. at 408; see also McNeese v. Bd. of Ed. for Cmty. Unit Sch. Dist. 187, 373\nU.S. 668, 675 (1963) (finding that student plaintiffs did not have to exhaust administrative\nremedies when the school superintendent did not have authority to grant the requested\nrelief).\n       “Third, an administrative remedy may be inadequate where the administrative body\nis shown to be biased or has otherwise predetermined the issue before it.” McCarthy v.\nMadigan, 503 U.S. at 148; Maggitt v. West, 202 F.3d 1370, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Rollock\nCo. v. United States, 115 Fed. Cl. at 322; Elk v. United States, 70 Fed.

For example, the United States Supreme Court in Houghton v. Shafer held that it\nwould be futile to require the petitioner to exhaust the administrative remedy of appeal to\nthe Attorney General of Pennsylvania, or another officer, in light of the Attorney General's\nsubmission that the rules were “validly and correctly applied to petitioner” and “strictly\nenforced throughout the entire correctional system . . . .” See Houghton v. Shafer, 392\nU.S. 639, 640 (1968); see also Aldrich v. United States, 31 Fed. Cl. 554, 557 (1994)\n(holding that “the interests of the individual ‘weigh heavily against requiring administrative\nexhaustion’ . . . where the administrative body is shown to have predetermined the issue.”\n(quoting McCarthy v. Madigan, 503 U.S. at 140)), aff’d, 56 F.3d 83 (Fed. Cir. 1995). In\nsuch a circumstance, continuing with the agency process is often termed “futile.” See\nItochu Bldg. Products v. United States, 733 F.3d at 1146 (“For example, a party often is\npermitted to bypass an available avenue of administrative challenge if pursuing that route\nwould clearly be futile, i.e., where it is clear that additional filings with the agency would\nbe ineffectual.” (citing Corus Staal BV v. United States, 502 F.3d at 1378–79 (futility\napplies in situations where plaintiffs “‘would be “required to go through obviously useless\nmotions in order to preserve their rights”’” (quoting Walsh v. United States, 151 Ct. Cl.\n507, 511 (1960))))).\n        Plaintiffs only urge the first exception to the exhaustion doctrine would apply if\nplaintiffs did not otherwise meet the exhaustion requirements, based on when there is an\nunreasonable or indefinite timeframe for administrative action. Plaintiffs argue that “it is\nclear that Plaintiffs would be unduly prejudiced by having to embark upon an ill-defined\nadministrative process with a potentially indefinite timeframe for action.” Plaintiffs claim\nthat the “events in question occurred more than seven years ago, and what little evidence\nwas not spoliated by federal/state/local law enforcement officers is in danger of\ndisappearing as memories fade with the passage of time. Plaintiffs have been litigating\nfor years in an effort to get their day in court and they would be unduly prejudiced by an\nadministrative decision that could take years and might get them no closer to a remedy\nthan where they are today.” Plaintiffs also allege that “it is questionable whether the\nDepartment of the Interior can adequately grant effective relief in this case in light of the\ncomplex and multiple constitutional issues that are play in the case.” (internal citation\nomitted).\n        Defendant responds that “Plaintiffs’ extensive litigation in the district court of Utah,\nwhere Plaintiffs fully, fairly, and forcefully presented their case, further ameliorates any\nconcern that additional time spent adjudicating this matter before DOI may prejudice\nPlaintiffs. Indeed, Plaintiffs have not explained what they would present here that they\nhave not already presented to that court.” Defendant also claims that the plaintiffs’\nargument that this case is complex and has multiple constitutional issues “does not\nsquare with their request for relief that is far more straightforward than the premise of their\nargument suggests: They seek monetary damages pursuant to the ‘bad men’ clause of\nthe 1868 Treaty.” The court agrees with defendant that plaintiffs’ claims in this court do\nnot involve “complex and multiple constitutional issues.” There is no certainty as to how\nlong the Department of the Interior might take in responding to plaintiffs’ claims. Plaintiffs’\nlengthy litigation history, however, does not mean a further delay at the Department of\nthe Interior would not have a negative impact on plaintiffs. Plaintiffs’ exhaustion\n\n                                              32\n\frequirements may well have been met under the 1868 Treaty by virtue of the March 12,\n2013 letter. Even, however, for the sake of argument, if the exhaustion requirements were\nnot met, because the facts of the case stem from the April 1, 2007 death of Mr. Murray,\nand because the previous litigation has continued since 2009, the court concludes that a\nrequirement to force plaintiffs now to exhaust administrative remedies at the Department\nof the Interior presents a further unreasonable or “indefinite timeframe for administrative\naction.” Therefore, this court concludes that, on one or both grounds, the exhaustion\ndoctrine does not preclude this court from taking jurisdiction over plaintiffs’ claims.\n“Bad Men” Provision\n\n       Defendant argues in its motion to dismiss that “Plaintiffs’ do not state a cognizable\nclaim under the ‘bad men’ provision.” Plaintiffs allege in their complaint that “Todd Murray,\nTodd Murray’s family, and the Ute Indian Tribe suffered ‘injuries’ at the hands of ‘bad\nmen’ as those terms are used in the Ute Treaties of 1863 and 1868.” As indicated above,\nthe “bad men” provision at issue in the 1868 Treaty provides:\n\n       If bad men among the whites, or among other people subject to the authority\n       of the United States, shall commit any wrong upon the person or property\n       of the Indian, the United States will, upon proof made to the agent and\n       forwarded to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs at Washington City,\n       proceed at once to cause the offender to be arrested and punished\n       according to the laws of the United States, and also reimburse the injured\n       person for the loss sustained.\n\n1868 Treaty, Art. 6. Defendant contends that many of plaintiffs’ alleged wrongs are not\ncontemplated by the terms of the treaty and, therefore, plaintiffs fail to state a claim with\nrespect to the “bad men” provision.\n\n        In examining what must be pled in order to state a claim, under both RCFC 8(a)(2)\nand Rule (8)(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a plaintiff need only state in\nthe complaint “a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled\nto relief.” RCFC 8(a)(2); Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2) (2015); see also Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly,\n550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007). The United States Supreme Court stated:\n\n       While a complaint attacked by a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss does not\n       need detailed factual allegations, [Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 47\n       (1957)]; Sanjuan v. American Bd. of Psychiatry and Neurology, Inc., 40 F.3d\n       247, 251 (7th Cir. 1994), a plaintiff’s obligation to provide the “grounds” of\n       his “entitle[ment] to relief” requires more than labels and conclusions, and a\n       formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do, see\n       Papasan v. Allain, 478 U.S. 265, 286 (1986) (on a motion to dismiss, courts\n       “are not bound to accept as true a legal conclusion couched as a factual\n       allegation”). Factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief\n       above the speculative level, see 5 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice\n       and Procedure § 1216, pp. 235-36 (3d ed. 2004) (hereinafter Wright &\n       Miller) (“[T]he pleading must contain something more . . . than . . . a\n\n                                             33\n\f       statement of facts that merely creates a suspicion [of] a legally cognizable\n       right of action”), on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint\n       are true (even if doubtful in fact), see, e.g., Swierkiewicz v.

Cl. at 734, argued that “[t]he ‘bad men’ provision should be construed to\nallow a private right of action by individual Indians against the United States,” noting that\njurisdiction has been found “under ‘bad men’ provisions of this or similar treaties,\nincluding: Tsosie v. United States, 11 Cl. Ct. 62 (1986) (Tsosie I); Tsosie v. United States,\n825 F.2d 393 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (Tsosie II); Hebah v. United States, 192 Ct. Cl. 785, 428\nF.2d 1334 (1970) (Hebah I); Hebah v.

The court\nnotes, however, that the 1863 Ute Treaty, standing alone, is not money mandating and\ncannot provide an alternate basis for jurisdiction in this court over plaintiffs’ claims.\n       Specifically, to state a cognizable claim under the “bad men” provision of a treaty,\nthe plaintiffs must clear several hurdles. “At least two inquiries are required to determine\nwhether a claim fits within the ‘bad men’ provision: [(1)] whether the man is a ‘bad man’\nwithin the meaning of the treaty; and [(2)] whether he committed a ‘wrong’ within the\nmeaning of the treaty.” Garreaux v. United States, 77 Fed. Cl. at 736 (citing Hebah v.\nUnited States, 456 F.2d 696, 702, 197 Ct. Cl. 729, cert. denied, 409 U.S. 870 (1972)\n(Hebah II)); see also Hernandez v. United States, 93 Fed. Cl. 193, 200 (2010) (citing Ex\nparte Kan-gi-shun-ca, 109 U.S. 556, 567–68 (1883) (“[I]n order to constitute a cause of\naction under this provision, ‘bad men’ must have ‘committed a wrong’ within the sense of\nthe treaty.”). A “wrong,” as defined by the 1868 treaty, encompasses affirmative criminal\nacts, but not omissions or acts of negligence. See Garreaux v. United States, 77 Fed. Cl.\nat 736 (discussing the Fort Laramie Treaty of April 29, 1868 between the United States\nand Sioux); Hernandez v. United States, 93 Fed. Cl. at 200 (“In order to bring action under\nthe Fort Laramie Treaty a Native American must be a victim of an affirmative criminal act,\nand the person committing the act must be a specific white man or men.”).\n\n       The first question for the purposes of the motion to dismiss is whether the individual\ndefendants named in the amended complaint by plaintiffs qualify as “bad men.” To\nproperly bring a “bad men” claim, the plaintiff first must identify particular individuals as\n“bad men.” See Garreaux v. United States, 77 Fed. Cl. at 737. The most recent decision\nby the Federal Circuit on “bad men” provisions, Richard v. United States, interpreting the\nFort Laramie Treaty of 1868, concluded that the “bad men” provisions “are not limited to\n‘an agent, employee, representative, or otherwise acting in any other capacity for or on\nbehalf of the United States.’” Richard v. United States, 677 F.3d 1141, 1153 (Fed. Cir.\n\n\n                                             35\n\f2012).21 Federal agencies, however, are not “bad men” under the language of the treaty.\nSee id. In Garreaux, an elderly Indian tenant brought suit against the Department of\nHousing and Urban Development (HUD) for the negligent supervision and administration\nof a Mutual Help and Occupancy Agreement, alleging that the HUD’s negligence caused\nher to lose her home Garreaux v. United States, 77 Fed. Cl. at 734. Because it was “not\na claim against specified white men, but against the federal government or HUD as an\nentity,” the court declined to hear the tenant’s claim. Id. at 737. The court explained that\nthe “plaintiff ha[d] not alleged sufficient facts stating who the ‘bad men’ are.” Id. In light of\nthis and other deficiencies, the Garreaux court granted the defendant’s motion to dismiss.\nSee id.\n\n        In specifically naming the allegedly responsible parties, plaintiffs pass the first\nhurdle. The plaintiffs’ complaint names FBI agents Rex Ashdown and David Ryan, BIA\nofficials James Beck, Terrance Cuch, and Kevin Myore, and all of the Utah\nstate/county/municipal law enforcement officers involved in the events of April 1, 2007,22\nas “bad men.” Plaintiffs further name the owners and employees of the Thomson-\nBlackburn Vernal Mortuary, the State of Utah, Uintah County, and Vernal City as “bad\nmen.” Excepting the mention of the State of Utah, Uintah County, and Vernal City, the\nplaintiffs successfully identify specific individuals as alleged “bad men,” and, therefore,\nsatisfy the first phase of the analysis.\n\n        As to the second hurdle, accepting the facts of the complaint as true for the\npurpose of defendant’s motion to dismiss, plaintiffs allege possible cognizable “wrongs,”\nif properly proven, as to certain allegations, but not as to others. Plaintiffs allege a host of\ninjuries, encompassing both actions and omissions, as follows:\n\n       By their actions and inactions, the FBI and BIA officers committed wrongs\n       to Todd Murray, the Murray family and the Ute Tribe (i) by acting in concert\n       with state/county/municipal officers, expressly or impliedly, in concocting, or\n\n\n21 The Federal Circuit in Richard noted that the Fort Laramie Treaty “‘is one of nine made\nin 1868. . . . The treaties were all duly ratified, proclaimed, and published in volume fifteen\nof the Statutes at Large. All say that peace is their object and all contain “bad men” articles\nin similar language.’” Richard v. United States, 677 F.3d at 1142 n.2 (quoting Tsosie v.\nUnited States, 825 F.2d at 395) (emphasis in original). One of the 1868 treaties is the\n1868 Ute Treaty. As identified in Elk, the Choctaw treaty “contained a host of other\nprovisions like those found in the 1867–68 Indian Peace Commission treaties, including\nthe Fort Laramie treaty with the Sioux. Indeed, all of the latter treaties [including the Ute\n1868 Treaty] contain ‘bad men’ clauses identical to that in the Sioux Treaty.” Elk v. United\nStates, 87 Fed. Cl. at 80-81.\n22As noted in the District Court litigation, the Utah officials include: Vernal City Police\nOfficer Vance Norton, Vernal City, Vernal City Police Department, the Utah Highway\nPatrol, the State of Utah, Blackburn Mortuary, Uintah County, State Troopers Dave\nSwenson, Craig Young, Rex Olsen, and Jeff Chugg, Uintah County Sherriff’s Sergeant\nBevan Watkins and Deputy Troy Slaugh, and Utah Division Wildlife Officer Sean Davis.\n                                               36\n\f       permitting to be concocted, a false story that Todd Murray shot himself in\n       the back of his head, execution style, above and behind his left ear; (ii) by\n       failing to take custody of Murray’s body and to secure the body against\n       desecration and spoliation of evidence; [sic] (iv) by participating in, tacitly\n       allowing, or failing to prevent, the desecration of Murray’s body and the\n       spoliation of critical evidence both at the shooting scene and afterwards at\n       the Medical Center, Blackburn Mortuary, and at the Utah OME; (v) the\n       failure to insure that a proper autopsy was performed on Murray’s body; (vi)\n       by failing to conduct any kind of investigation into Todd Murray’s murder;\n       and (vii) by failing to protect the territorial integrity of the Tribe’s reservation\n       boundary and the Tribe’s sovereign interests in the crime scene where\n       Murray was shot.\n\n         Defendant argues that “[t]he Bad men clause is limited to affirmative criminal acts.”\nIn Hebah II, the Court of Claims construed “wrong” according to its common or plain\nmeaning. See Hebah II, 456 F.2d at 704, 197 Ct. Cl. 729. In Hebah II, the Court of Claims\naddressed the death by shooting of plaintiff's husband by tribal policeman Norman Moss.\nId. at 699.23 With the help of a dictionary, the court defined a wrong as “[a]ction or conduct\nwhich inflicts harm without due provocation or just cause; serious injury wantonly inflicted\nor undeservedly sustained; unjust or unmerited treatment.” Id. Plaintiffs in the above\ncaptioned case argue that this definition is particularly broad and encompasses omissions\nof the sort alleged in the amended complaint. The court notes, however, that defendant\nin Hebah II argued that “the plain language of the Treaty of 1868 requires that no\nreimbursement be made to one who sustains a loss while violating the laws of the United\nStates, and that deceased was violating the laws of the United States when he suffered\nhis ‘loss.’” Id. at 705. Defendant in Hebah II also argued that the shooting officer\n“committed no wrong upon deceased because the arrest attempt was lawfully made and,\nunder the circumstances, the shooting of deceased was justified,” and the court agreed\nthat it “was regrettable but reasonable for Moss to shoot to kill decedent. Having\ndetermined that the killing of deceased was reasonable under the circumstances herein,\nit follows that the killing was with reason or just cause. Therefore, Moss did not commit a\n“wrong” within the meaning of the Treaty of 1868 [between the United States and the\nEastern Band of Shoshonees and the Bannack Tribe of Indians].” Id. at 705, 710.\n\n       In Garreaux v. United States, 77 Fed. Cl. at 736, however, the United States Court\nof Federal Claims narrowed its understanding of the term, “wrong.” The court observed a\nlong line of precedent in which bad men claims were “rooted” in behavior that was\n\n\n23The Court of Claims further explained, the “Decedent returned to Apartment 18 at Tigee\nVillage about midnight on March 13, 1968. He was drunk, angry and carrying a one pint\nbottle and a one-half pint bottle of whisky,” and “[s]hortly after going to bed, Mr. Hebah\nstarted to choke Mrs. Hebah,” who eventually fled to a neighbor’s house who called Wind\nRiver Reservation police station. Hebbah II, 456 F.2d at 699. “Mrs. Hebah explained to\nOfficer Moss that her husband was drunk, armed with a rifle, had plenty of ammunition,\nthat he had chased her brother and son out of the apartment, that he had threatened her\nwith bodily harm, and that she and her daughter had fled from the apartment.” Id. at 700.\n                                               37\n\f“criminal in nature.” Id. The Garreaux court emphasized its unwillingness to “stretch the\nbounds of the ‘bad men’ provision to encompass not a criminal claim, but a claim for\nnegligence,” and noted that the “primary intent” of the provision was to “guard against\naffirmative criminal acts.” Id. Furthermore, the court in Garreaux observed that the\npunishment for inflicting a “wrong” is arrest and prosecution. See id. at 734.\n\n        In Hernandez v. United States, 93 Fed. Cl. at 199, this court again adopted a\nnarrow interpretation of the term “wrong,” resolving the ambiguity in light of the treaty’s\noverall purpose. In Hernandez, a tribal prisoner at the Tecumseh State Correctional\nFacility in Nebraska brought suit, claiming, inter alia, that the United States violated the\nguarantees of the bad men provision by “fail[ing] to arrest suspected ‘wrongdoers’” Id. at\n198. The Hernandez court observed that the provision, typically, is only applied to\naffirmative criminal acts and not omissions. Ultimately, the court rested its determination\non the “primary intent” of the “bad men” clause, which “was to keep the peace between\nNative Americans and non-Native Americans.” Id. “[A]s such, the Fort Laramie Treaty has\nbeen applied to affirmative criminal acts and not mere acts of negligence.” Id. Because\narresting and criminally prosecuting individuals for civil wrongs does not logically follow,\n“wrongs,” as defined by the 1868 Treaty, are only allegations of criminal wrongs. A more\nexpansive interpretation would render the remedy provided for inappropriate. Thus, in\norder for the provision to maintain its coherence, the court concludes that “wrongs” is\nlimited to criminal wrongs. In sum, the 1868 Treaty language and the relevant case law\nsupports a narrow understanding of what constitutes a “wrong,” one that encompasses\nonly affirmative criminal acts.\n\n       Applying an affirmative acts test, most of the plaintiffs’ alleged wrongs fail to state\na cognizable claim under the “bad men” provision of a treaty. While, as plaintiffs note, it\nis doubtless true that “a person can be wronged by the inaction of another,” inaction is\nnot a recognized harm under the 1868 Treaty. Since allegations (ii), (v), (vi), and (vii)\nallege only omissions, they do not qualify as “wrongs” for purposes of a “bad men” claim\nunder the provision of the 1868 Treaty. Accordingly, allegations (ii), (v), (vi), and (vii),\ntherefore, are dismissed for failure to state a claim.\n\n        Nevertheless, accepting plaintiffs’ allegations as true, allegations (i) and (iv) qualify\nas potential, cognizable “wrongs” under the 1868 Treaty. In fact, in Hebah II the court\nexplicitly recognized that “the killing of an Indian without just cause or reason would be a\nwrong within the meaning of the Treaty of 1868.” Hebah II, 456 F.2d at 704, 197 Ct. Cl.\n729. Therefore, because plaintiffs allege that the FBI and BIA, “by acting in concert with\nstate/county/municipal officers, expressly or impliedly, in concocting, or permitting to be\nconcocted, a false story that Todd Murray shot himself in the back of his head, execution\nstyle, above and behind his left ear,” and “by participating in, tacitly allowing, or failing to\nprevent, the desecration of Murray’s body and the spoliation of critical evidence both at\nthe shooting scene and afterwards at the Medical Center, Blackburn Mortuary, and at the\nUtah OME,” the court denies the defendant’s motion to dismiss as to allegations (i) and\n(iv) of the amended complaint. The court also notes, however, that defendant is correct\nthat the “bad men” provision “does not include, as plaintiffs, suggest the universe of off-\nreservation activities that would have occurred ‘but for’ the initial conduct on the\n\n                                               38\n\freservation.” Therefore, to the extent allegation (iv), which includes “the desecration of\nMurray’s body and the spoliation of critical evidence both at the shooting scene and\nafterwards at the Medical Center, Blackburn Mortuary, and at the Utah OME,” includes\nthe desecration of Mr. Murray’s body and spoliation of critical evidence that did not take\nplace on the reservation, but at the medical center and mortuary, those allegations are\nnot covered by the “bad men” provision of the 1868 Treaty. For example, as explained in\nthe District Court’s spoliation order, ”[a]fter the completion of the federal criminal matter\ninvolving the [Mr. Murray’s] firearm, the judge hearing the case signed, on November 14,\n2008, an order forfeiting the firearm to the government. Shortly thereafter, the firearm was\ndestroyed. Agent Ryan did not notify any of the Defendants that the firearm would be\ndestroyed.” Jones et al. v. Norton et al., 2014 WL 909569, at *4 (footnote omitted).\nTherefore, the destruction of Mr. Murray’s weapon did not take place not on Tribal lands.\n\n        Although the court recognizes allegations (i) and (iv) qualify as potential cognizable\nwrongs under the 1868 Treaty, implicit in Hebah II, is the conclusion that, as defendant\nargues, “actions permissibly taken by law enforcement officers are not ‘wrong’ and cannot\nsupport a finding of liability under the ‘bad men’ provision.”24 See Hebah II, 456 F.2d at\n708, 710, 197 Ct. Cl. 729. As noted above, the record does not reflect any criminal\nprosecutions of Special Agent Rex Ashdown and David Ryan of the FBI or the various\nofficials present from the BIA, suggesting that the decision not to prosecute indicates the\nactions taken by the federal officers were considered permissible by the appropriate\nauthorities. The court, however, cannot infer from the absence of prosecutions that all the\nFBI and BIA actions were taken permissibly. Therefore, the court addresses allegations\n(i) and (iv) of the amended complaint.\n\nIssue Preclusion\n\n        Accepting the plaintiffs’ factual allegations as true and that parts of allegations (i)\nand (iv) in plaintiffs’ complaint qualify as potentially cognizable “wrongs,” defendant,\nnevertheless, argues that “[t]he doctrine of issue preclusion prevents the re-litigation of\nPlaintiffs’ only cognizable claim for relief under the Bad Men clause.” Defendant argues:\n\n       The district court of Utah entered an order in Plaintiffs’ lawsuit against the\n       state law enforcement officers and mortuary that rejects with finality the\n       keystone of Plaintiffs’ argument that they constructed over the course of five\n       years of litigation: that the state defendants allegedly trespassed on tribal\n       lands, executed Mr. Murray, and subsequently engaged in a conspiracy to\n       thwart any investigation into his murder.\n\nTherefore, defendant contends that “[p]laintiffs’ lawsuit in the Court of Federal Claims\ndoes not provide them with an additional opportunity to litigate the ultimate facts of this\n\n\n24Defendant further argues that “[t]he text and history of the treaty also indicates that the\nUnited States and the tribe were primarily concerned with criminal acts that injured either\nthe individual tribal members or their property, such as robbery, assault, and murder,”\nand, therefore, not claims of conspiracy to destroy evidence.\n                                              39\n\fcentral thesis that the Utah district court concluded was without merit.” (internal citation\nomitted). “This is no less true,” defendant argues, “even though Plaintiffs’ appeal to the\nTenth Circuit remains pending.” Defendant argues there is no question that “the issues\ncurrently at stake are identical, were actually litigated in the Utah district court, and that\nPlaintiffs had a full and fair opportunity to litigate those issues. That Plaintiffs’ bring\ndifferent claims is immaterial. The fundamental point of contention—Mr. Murray’s cause\nof death—has been resolved.” In response, plaintiffs argue that “[i]ssue\npreclusion/collateral estoppel does not apply to Plaintiffs’ action in the Court of Claims\nbecause Plaintiffs have challenged the district court’s purely legal rulings on appeal.\nAccordingly, not only does [sic] the Utah district court’s rulings lack finality, but, more\nimportantly, the Plaintiffs have not been afforded a full and fair opportunity in which to\nconclusively litigate their claims in Norton.”\n\n         The rule of issue preclusion precludes a party from re-litigating an issue that was\n“litigated and resolved in a valid court determination essential to the prior judgment.” New\nHampshire v. Maine, 532 U.S. 742, 748-49 (2001). In addition, “[u]nder collateral\nestoppel, once a court has decided an issue of fact or law necessary to its judgment, that\ndecision may preclude relitigation of the issue in a suit on a different cause of action\ninvolving a party to the first case.” Allen v. McCurry, 449 U.S. 90, 94 (1980); see also\nUnited States v. Mendoza, 464 U.S. 154, 158 (1984) (“Under the judicially-developed\ndoctrine of collateral estoppel, once a court has decided an issue of fact or law necessary\nto its judgment, that decision is conclusive in a subsequent suit based on a different cause\nof action involving a party to the prior litigation.”). “When an issue of ultimate fact has\nonce been determined by a valid and final judgment, that issue cannot again be litigated\nbetween the same parties in any future lawsuit.” Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U.S. 436, 443\n(1970). The United States Supreme Court has explained that issue preclusion guards\nagainst “the expense and vexation attending multiple lawsuits, conserves judicial\nresources, and fosters reliance on judicial action by minimizing the possibility of\ninconsistent decisions.” Montana v. United States, 440 U.S. 147, 153–54 (1979) (footnote\nomitted). The Supreme Court has indicated clearly that:\n\n       Issue preclusion bars successive litigation of “an issue of fact or law” that\n       “is actually litigated and determined by a valid and final judgment, and . . .\n       is essential to the judgment.” Restatement (Second) of Judgments § 27\n       (1980) (hereinafter Restatement). If a judgment does not depend on a given\n       determination, relitigation of that determination is not precluded. Id., § 27,\n       Comment h.\n\nBobby v. Bies, 556 U.S. 825, 834 (2009).25\n\n       The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has directed that:\n\n\n25 The Supreme Court has explained that “[i]ssue preclusion refers to the effect of a\njudgment in foreclosing relitigation of a matter that has been litigated and decided. This\neffect also is referred to as direct or collateral estoppel.” Migra v. Warren City Sch. Dist.\nBd. of Educ., 465 U.S. 75, 77 n.1 (1984).\n                                             40\n\f       Collateral estoppel is generally appropriate if “(1) an issue is identical to one\n       decided in the first action; (2) the issue was actually litigated in the first\n       action; (3) the resolution of the issue was essential to a final judgment in the\n       first action; and (4) the party defending against issue preclusion had a full\n       and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the first action.”\n\nBiafora v. United States, 773 F.3d 1326, 1333 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Shell Petroleum,\nInc. v. United States, 319 F.3d 1334, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2003)). The Federal Circuit,\nhowever, has indicated that “[o]n procedural issues not unique to this circuit's exclusive\njurisdiction, we apply the law of the regional circuit. . . .” Dana v. E.S. Originals, Inc., 342\nF.3d 1320, 1323 (Fed. Cir. 2003); see also Aspex Eyewear, Inc. v. Zenni Optical Inc., 713\nF.3d 1377, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2013). Because the District Court’s decision is from the District\nof Utah, the court applies the law of the Tenth Circuit.\n\n      The Tenth Circuit has explained that “[c]ollateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, is\ndesigned to prevent needless relitigation and bring about some finality to litigation.” Moss\nv. Kopp, 559 F.3d 1155, 1161 (10th Cir. 2009) (footnote omitted). The Tenth Circuit has\ndetermined along the same lines that issue preclusion applies when:\n\n       (1) the issue previously decided is identical with the one presented in the\n       action in question, (2) the prior action has been finally adjudicated on the\n       merits, (3) the party against whom the doctrine is invoked was a party, or in\n       privity with a party, to the prior adjudication, and (4) the party against whom\n       the doctrine is raised had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in\n       the prior action.\n\nPark Lake Res. Ltd. Liab. Co. v. United States Dep't of Agric., 378 F.3d 1132, 1136 (10th\nCir. 2004); see also Stan Lee Media, Inc. v. Walt Disney Co., 774 F.3d 1292, 1297 (10th\nCir. 2014); Bushco v. Shurtleff, 729 F.3d 1294, 1301 (10th Cir. 2013); Murdock v. Ute\nIndian Tribe of Uintah and Ouray Reservation, 975 F.2d 683, 687 (10th Cir. 1992) (“In the\nTenth Circuit, collateral estoppel requires that four elements be met: (1) the issue\npreviously decided is identical with the one presented in the action in question, (2) the\nprior action has been finally adjudicated on the merits, (3) the party against whom the\ndoctrine is invoked was a party or in privity with a party to the prior adjudication, and (4)\nthe party against whom the doctrine is raised had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the\nissue in the prior action.”) (internal quotations omitted), cert. denied, 507 U.S. 1042\n(1993). The Tenth Circuit also has held that “[i]ssue preclusion “bars a party from\nrelitigating an issue once it has suffered an adverse determination on the issue, even if\nthe issue arises when the party is pursuing or defending against a different claim.” Bushco\nv. Shurtleff, 729 F.3d at 1301; see also Moss v. Kopp, 559 F.3d at 1161; Burrell v. Armijo,\n456 F.3d 1159, 1172 (10th Cir. 2006), cert. denied, 549 U.S. 1167 (2007). Quoting the\nUnited States Supreme Court, the Tenth Circuit has indicated, “‘once an issue is actually\nand necessarily determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, that determination is\nconclusive in subsequent suits based on a different cause of action involving a party to\n\n\n\n                                              41\n\fthe prior litigation.’” Estate of True v. Comm’r, 290 F.3d 1210, 1222 (10th Cir. 2004)\n(quoting Montana v. United States, 440 U.S. at 153).\n\n         Both parties agree that the decisions from the Tenth Circuit govern the collateral\nestoppel inquiry. Both parties further agree on the Tenth Circuit’s four part standard for\ndetermining the applicability of collateral estoppel: (1) an issue is identical to one decided\nin the first action; (2) the prior action has been finally adjudicated on the merits; (3) the\nparty against whom the doctrine is invoked was a party or in privity with a party to the\nprior adjudication, the resolution of the issue was essential to a final judgment in the first\naction; and (4) the party defending against issue preclusion had a full and fair opportunity\nto litigate the issue in the first action. See, e.g., Park Lake Res. Ltd. Liab. Co. v. United\nStates Dep't of Agric., 378 F.3d at 1136. Finally, both parties agree that collateral estoppel\nis available as a defense by the United States, even though the United States was not a\nparty to the original suit, assuming the party who will be bound by the preclusion had a\nfull and fair opportunity to litigate the precluded issue.26\n\n        Defendant claims that the decision of the United States District Court for the District\nof Utah in Jones et al. v. Norton et al., 3 F.Supp.3d 1170 is a valid and final judgment as\nto Mr. Murray’s cause of death, one that precludes re-litigation.27 Plaintiffs respond that\n“Collateral estoppel can only apply if all four requirements are met,” and according to\nplaintiffs, “[t]hat is not the case here. Three out of the four collateral estoppel factors are\nnot satisfied. Plaintiffs acknowledge, however, that the third requirement for collateral\nestoppel is met, because they were parties to the district court adjudication in Norton.”\n\n      Regarding the first element of collateral estoppel, whether an issue is identical to\none decided in the first action, plaintiffs argue that there is “no identity of issues” between\n\n\n26Because the United States was not a party to the Norton suit in the United States District\nCourt for the District of Utah, but the plaintiffs were, the use of collateral estoppel would\nbe defensive, non-mutual issue preclusion. See Parklane Hoisery Co. v. Shore, 439 U.S.\n322, 326 n.4 (1979). Relatedly, the parties agree that 28 U.S.C § 1500 (2012) does not\napply to the above captioned case, because the District Court case was not against the\nUnited States or an agent of the United States, even though this case was filed after the\nDistrict Court was filed. See United States v. Tohono O'Odham Nation, 131 S. Ct. 1723,\n1727-28 (2011). Further, the parties also agree that doctrine of law of the case is\ninapplicable here as this case is distinct from the Norton case and was filed in a different\ncourt.\n27 Defendant also argues that “Plaintiffs likewise miss the mark with their argument that\nthe supposed ‘mass spoliation of critical evidence’ deprived them of a full and fair\nopportunity to litigate. As an initial matter, their argument goes to the underlying\ninvestigation. And the matter of spoliation was intensely litigated over the course of five\nyears in the district court of Utah, with extensive discovery, briefing, and an evidentiary\nhearing.” Defendant also argues, “[t]hat Plaintiffs disagree with Judge Campbell’s\nconclusion is clear. But this lawsuit provides them with no occasion to rely on the same\nevidence or introduce new evidence in an attempt to reach a different result.”\n                                              42\n\fthe present suit and the one litigated in the United States District Court for the District of\nUtah. Plaintiffs also claim that the issues before the District Court related to allegations of\nillegal seizure, excessive force, and conspiracy, whereas the issue before this court\ninvolve the breach of federal treaties, the “wrongs” of various law enforcement officials\nand trust obligations. Defendant argues that the “issues currently at stake are identical,”\nand the “identity of issues in both cases is similarly made apparent in the Utah district\ncourt’s rejection of Plaintiffs’ conspiracy theory, that is, that the individuals involved in that\nday’s events engaged in a conspiracy to cover up Mr. Murray’s ‘execution.’” Defendant\nstates “[i]ndeed, Plaintiffs’ suggestion that this Court ‘review the same evidence and come\nto a different conclusion,’ highlights the very necessity of issue preclusion: to prevent\nneedless relitigation and bring about some finality to litigation.” (internal citation omitted).\nDefendant also points to plaintiffs’ response to the motion to dismiss to support their point:\n\n       The difference between the original Complaint and the proposed First\n       Amended Complaint is that the Amended Complaint makes explicit what is\n       only implicit in the original Complaint. The Utah state, county, and municipal\n       officers committed a wrong by pursuing Murray at gunpoint without\n       jurisdiction and without probable cause, by shooting Murray execution-style,\n       and by then conspiring to cover-up the execution-style shooting and to\n       obstruct justice.\n\n(emphasis in original).\n\n        On March 7, 2014 the District Court of Utah granted the defendant’s motion for\nsummary judgment, and denied plaintiffs’ cross motion. See generally Jones et al. v.\nNorton et al., 3 F. Supp. 3d 1170. On April 1, 2014, plaintiffs appealed the District Court’s\ndecision to the United State Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. See Jones et al. v.\nNorton et al., No. 14-4040 (10th Cir. appeal docketed Apr. 1, 2014).28 The District Court\nin Norton concluded that “[t]he evidence clearly shows that Mr. Murray shot himself.” Id.\nat 1190. This conclusion comes up in several contexts in the Distrct Court case, including\nwhether Mr. Murray was “seized” for Fourth Amendment purposes by the defendants.\nPlaintiffs in the District Court action argued Mr. Murray was seized, and further claimed\nthat Detective Norton shot Mr. Murray execution style. The District Court, however,\ndetermined:\n\n       the Plaintiffs’ evidence is sparse, circumstantial, subject to more than one\n       interpretation, and, at times, very speculative. Moreover, evidence to the\n       contrary is strong and is consistent with a self-inflicted gunshot wound.\n       Deputy Byron testified that he did not see Detective Norton next to Mr.\n       Murray when Mr. Murray dropped to the ground. Detective Norton testified\n       that he was up on a hill when he saw Mr. Murray shoot himself.\n\n\n28As noted above, on November 18, 2014, plaintiffs filed another appeal to the United\nState Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, appealing the amended judgment entered\nby the District Court. See Jones et al. v. Norton et al., No. 14-4144 (filed 10th Cir. Nov.\n18, 2014).\n                                               43\n\f       The Deputy Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Edward Leis, who conducted the\n       physical examination of Mr. Murray's body, concluded in his report that the\n       wound was caused by a gun shot “in close proximity to the skin surface\n       when it was discharged.” He based his conclusion on “abundant soot at the\n       inferior margin of the defect [the wound] and some marginal abrasion is also\n       noted at the inferior margin.” In his testimony, he elaborated on his\n       conclusion that the gun was in contact with Mr. Murray’s head when it was\n       fired:\n\n              At the perimeter, there are several triangular shaped tears of\n              the wound. That's a result of the gun being pressed up against\n              the skin surface when it's discharged and gases causing the\n              scalp to be separated from the underlying skull. When the\n              scalp lifts up, it stretches and it tears and gets its characteristic\n              stellae appearance.\n\n       The smaller wound on the right side of Mr. Murray’s head was, in Dr. Leis’\n       opinion, the exit wound. After Dr. Leis certified that Mr. Murray’s death was\n       a suicide resulting from a gunshot wound to the head, he added an\n       additional cause of death (based on results from testing of Mr. Murray’s\n       bodily fluids). Because the tests showed the presence of drugs and alcohol\n       in Mr. Murray's system, Dr. Leis issued an amended death certificate which\n       added “Acute alcohol intoxication; recent methamphetamine use” as\n       contributing to Mr. Murray’s death.\n\n       Detective Norton was more than 100 yards away when Mr. Murray was\n       shot. Dr. Leis testified that there was no evidence that the wound could have\n       been caused by a shot coming from that far away. Plaintiffs maintain that\n       Detective Norton was not 100 yards away, but was right next to Mr. Murray\n       and so he had the capability of inflicting the contact wound. But the actual\n       evidence in the record (that is, testimony by Detective Norton and Deputy\n       Byron) shows that Detective Norton was not right next to Mr. Murray when\n       the fatal shot was fired.\n\nId. at 1190-91 (footnotes omitted). Therefore, the District Court concluded that “[a]ll of the\ndirect evidence presented by the Defendants, including Dr. Leis’ testimony and report,\nsupports the conclusion that Mr. Murray shot himself. Plaintiffs offer no more than\nspeculation and no reasonable jury could find that Detective Norton shot Mr. Murray in\nthe head at point-blank range.” The District Court also determined that Mr. Murray’s death\nwas a suicide. See id. at 1191. The District Court stated, “[b]ased on the facts as detailed\nand explained in its spoliation order, the court concludes that no reasonable jury could\nconclude that Defendants conspired to ‘effectively eliminate[ ] all probative evidence’ and\n‘clean the closet of evidence that would have allowed Plaintiffs to build their case.’” Id. at\n1204 (quoting various plaintiffs’ briefs; omissions in original; footnote omitted).\n\n\n\n                                               44\n\f        Addressing plaintiffs’ conspiracy theory, the District Court indicated, “[s]ummed up,\nPlaintiffs’ argument is that Defendants engaged in ‘[a] conspiracy to cover up a killing.’\nPlaintiffs’ theory is that Detective Norton shot and killed Mr. Murray, and that the rest of\nthe Defendants conspired to cover-up that killing and protect Detective Norton.” Id. at\n1197 (footnotes omitted). Explaining the conspiracy, the court noted that, “[t]he focus of\nthe Plaintiffs’ conspiracy theory is the failure to give aid and their spoliation argument\nabout the destruction of evidence.” Id. at 1202. Turning to plaintiffs’ claims of the\ndefendants’ failure to give medical aid to Mr. Murray, and the defendants’ “interference\nwith Mr. Murray's due process right of access to courts via the failure to preserve critical\nevidence and the affirmative destruction of critical evidence,” the District Court\ndetermined “[n]one of that testimony could allow a reasonable jury to conclude that\nIndividual Defendants were deliberately indifferent to Mr. Murray’s situation, or that they\nknew that there was a substantial risk of significant harm to Mr. Murray if they did not\nprovide first aid. If anything, the evidence shows that at least three of the Individual\nDefendants (Young, Davis, and Slaugh) were concerned that attempts to provide any kind\nof aid to Mr. Murray would do more harm than good.” Id. at 1210. The court determined,\n“[i]n sum, there is no evidence before the court to support a finding that the inaction by\neach individual defendant was part of a conspiracy to let Mr. Murray die.” Id. at 1203.\n\n        The thoroughness of the District Court’s findings and decision, after years of\ndiscovery and multiple briefings, demonstrates a comprehensive review of the\ncircumstances of the death of Mr. Murray and the actions of the officials in the aftermath\nof his death. Nonetheless plaintiffs claim that:\n\n       The district court’s statements and rulings concerning the manner of\n       Murray’s death, the desecration of Murray’s body, the sufficiency of\n       evidence showing a conspiracy, the extra-jurisdictional pursuit of Murray,\n       and the handcuffing of Murray are not preclusive in this action because the\n       issues to be litigated here—whether the actions and omissions of the Utah\n       and federal law enforcement officers violated the 1863 and 1868 Ute\n       Treaties—are not identical to the issues adjudicated by the district court in\n       that court’s dispositive rulings.\n\n         The court agrees with defendant that the issues identified in the amended\ncomplaint filed in this court, namely the allegations that officials committed “a wrong by\npursuing Murray at gunpoint without jurisdiction and without probable cause, by shooting\nMurray execution-style, and by then conspiring to cover-up the execution-style shooting\nand to obstruct justice,” presents identical issues with those decided in the District Court\nlitigation.\n\n        Regarding the second element of the collateral estoppel test, whether the prior\naction has been finally adjudicated on the merits, defendant contends that the District\nCourt’s “order on summary judgment is final for purposes of issue preclusion, even though\nPlaintiffs’ appeal remains pending.” In response, plaintiffs declare that the decisions by\nthe District Court “have not been conclusively adjudicated on the merits because those\nrulings are being challenged on appeal and are currently pending de novo review by the\n\n                                             45\n\fTenth Circuit.” (emphasis in original). The Tenth Circuit has made clear that “[t]he\nappealability of a judgment, however, does not hinder its preclusive effect.” MACTEC,\nInc. v. Gorelick, 427 F.3d 821, 832 (10th Cir. 2005) (citing 15A Charles Alan Wright et al.,\nFederal Practice and Procedure § 4433, at 78–85 (2d ed. 1992)), cert. denied, 547 U.S.\n1040 (2006). Wright & Miller emphasize that, as a general rule, a final judgment from a\nlower court carries res judicata effect even though it is still subject to review by an\nappellate court. See 15A Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice and Procedure §\n4433, at 78–85; see also Leo v. Garmin Int’l, Inc., 464 F. App’x 737, 740 (10th Cir.)\n(unpublished), cert. denied, 133 S. Ct. 484 (2012). Moreover, as noted by the United\nStates Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, prior adjudications are considered final\nwhen they are “sufficiently firm to be accorded conclusive effect.” Dana v. E.S. Originals,\nInc., 342 F.3d at 1323 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Judgments § 13 (1982))\n(applying 11th Circuit law).29 The District Court’s decision in Jones et al. v. Norton et al.,\n3 F. Supp. 3d 1170, was issued after years of discovery and more than four and a half\nyears after the case was removed to Federal Court. The District Court judge issued a\nspoliation order and a 71 page decision granting the defendant’s motion for summary\njudgment, which fully reviewed the factual circumstances and legal issues raised in the\ncase.\n\n        Plaintiffs also allege that “to be considered adjudicated on the merits, the previous\nissues adjudicated must have been necessary to the judgment.” As determined when\nconsidering the first element of collateral estoppel, all of the issues defendant raises as\nbearing on estoppel were necessary to the District Court’s decision to grant summary\njudgment to the defendant. The District Court carefully considered the allegations of\nmurder, as well as the spoliation claims in determining that there were no constitutional\nviolations by the officials. Each were a necessary element of the summary judgment\ndecision. Therefore, for purposes of collateral estoppel, the careful and thorough\nsummary judgment decision issued by the District of Utah should be considered a final\njudgment on the issue adjudicated on its merits by this court.30\n\n       Regarding the third element of the collateral estoppel test, whether the party\nagainst whom the doctrine is invoked was a party or was in privity with a party to the prior\nadjudication, “Plaintiffs acknowledge that the third requirement for collateral estoppel is\n\n\n\n29 The Federal Circuit has interpreted this to mean decisions that are “adequately\ndeliberated” in which the “parties were fully heard in the prior proceeding.” Dana v. E.S.\nOriginals, Inc., 342 F.3d at 1323.\n30 Although not clearly established by the Tenth Circuit, other federal appellate courts\nhave made clear that issue preclusion applies to summary judgment decisions, and the\nsummary judgment decision by the District Court in Norton thorough and detailed on the\nrelevant issues. See Exhibitors Poster Exch., Inc. v. Nat’l Screen Serv. Corp., 421 F.2d\n1313, 1319 (5th Cir. 1970); see also Shoup v. Bell & Howell Co., 872 F.2d 1178, 1181\n(4th Cir. 1989); Hubicki v. ACF Indus., Inc., 484 F.2d 519, 524 (3rd Cir. 1973); 18A\nCharles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice and Procedure § 4444.\n                                             46\n\fmet, because they were parties to the district court adjudication in Norton.” Therefore, the\nthird element is not in dispute.31\n\n        Finally, for the fourth element of the collateral estoppel test, whether the party\ndefending against issue preclusion had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in\nthe first action, defendant contends that “[t]he district court provided Plaintiffs with a full\nand fair opportunity to litigate the matters involved in Norton.” Plaintiffs respond that they\nhave not been afforded a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the first action as\n“Plaintiffs have not yet been heard on appeal.” Plaintiffs also argue that “[c]ritical in this\ncase is that the Plaintiffs, through no fault of their own, were deprived of crucial evidence\nin Norton due to the mass spoliation of critical evidence that occurred as a result of the\nState and federal officers’ intentional tampering with, destruction and/or loss of, and\nfailure to collect and preserve evidence.”\n\n       For a full and fair opportunity, the Tenth Circuit has indicated “as to the ‘“inquiry\ninto whether a party had a full and fair opportunity to litigate an issue . . . [we] focus on\nwhether there were significant procedural limitations in the prior proceeding, whether the\nparty had the incentive to litigate fully the issue, or whether effective litigation was limited\nby the nature or relationship of the parties.”’” Burrell v. Armijo, 456 F.3d at 1172 (quoting\nMurdock v. Ute Indian Tribe of Uintah & Ouray Reservation, 975 F.2d 683, 689 (10th Cir.\n1992) (internal citations omitted)). As noted above, plaintiffs originally filed their case in\nNorton with the Uintah County Court on July 17, 2009, and then the case was removed\nto the United States District Court for the District of Utah on August 20, 2009. The District\nCourt, more than four and a half years after the removal to federal court, after issuing a\nspoliation order, issued a 71 page decision, granting the defendant’s motion for summary\n\n\n31The Court notes that the Ute Tribe was not a party to the District Court action. No one,\nhowever, has suggested to the court that the plaintiffs are in privity with the Tribe.\nMoreover, the court notes that the Ute Tribe, independent of the other plaintiffs, cannot\nsustain a claim under the “bad men” provision of the 1868 Treaty. Article 6 of the Treaty\nstates:\n\n       If bad men among the whites or among other people, subject to the authority\n       of the United States, shall commit any wrong upon the person or property\n       of the Indians, the United States will, upon proof made to the agent and\n       forwarded to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs at Washington City,\n       proceed at once to cause the offender to be arrested and punished\n       according to the laws of the United States, and also reimburse the injured\n       person for the loss sustained.\n\nId. Art. 6 (emphasis added). The Tribe is not an “injured person,” Mr. Murray was the\ninjured person, and his parents brought suit on his behalf. See Hernandez v. United\nStates, 93 Fed. Cl. at 200 (“In order to bring action under the Fort Laramie Treaty a Native\nAmerican must be a victim of an affirmative criminal act, and the person committing the\nact must be a specific white man or men.”) (emphasis added). The Tribe alone cannot\nprosecute a claim under the “bad men” provision of the 1868 Treaty.\n                                              47\n\fjudgment. As noted by defendant, in the District Court litigation, “Plaintiffs’ expert report\nsummarize[ed] the nearly 1,000 pages of documents then available, including an\nextensive list of depositions.” Although plaintiffs argue they “have not yet been heard on\nappeal,” this court determines that plaintiffs have not demonstrated a proper reason to\nprevent preclusion following the District Court’s final judgment. Nor, in the court’s view,\ndoes the existence of an appeal speak to the plaintiffs’ ability to have had a full and fair\nopportunity to litigate the facts of what occurred before the federal District Court, which it\nappears plaintiffs have been afforded.\n\n        Regarding the argument that plaintiffs “were deprived of crucial evidence in Norton\ndue to the mass spoliation of critical evidence that occurred,” defendant argues that “[a]s\nan initial matter, their argument goes to the underlying investigation, not the district court\nproceeding. The matter of spoliation was intensely litigated over the course of five years\nin the district court of Utah, with extensive discovery, briefing, and an evidentiary hearing.”\nThe District Court determined, “[b]ased on the facts as detailed and explained in its\nspoliation order, the court concludes that no reasonable jury could conclude that\nDefendants conspired to ‘effectively eliminate[ ] all probative evidence’ and ‘clean the\ncloset of evidence that would have allowed Plaintiffs to build their case.’” Jones et al. v.\nNorton et al., 3 F. Supp. 3d at 1204 (footnote omitted; omissions in original). The District\nCourt concluded that there was no failure on the part of the defendants to preserve\nevidence. Plaintiffs appear to be arguing that the District Court’s decision was wrong and\nthat demonstrates plaintiffs did not have a full and fair opportunity to litigate. As discussed\nabove, the District Court’s decision was thorough and comprehensive. Plaintiffs had a fair\nand full opportunity to litigate the spoliation issues.32\n\n       As all four elements of the collateral estoppel test have been met, plaintiffs are\nestopped from litigating the factual circumstances of Todd Murray’s death, and the\nallegations of the destruction of evidence. Therefore, for allegation (i), that the FBI or the\nBIA officers committed wrongs to Todd Murray, the Murray family and the Ute Tribe “by\nacting in concert with state/county/municipal officers, expressly or impliedly, in\nconcocting, or permitting to be concocted, a false story that Todd Murray shot himself in\nthe back of his head, execution style, above and behind his left ear,” plaintiffs have failed\nto state a claim. Likewise, for allegation (iv), that the FBI or the BIA officers committed\nwrongs to Todd Murray, the Murray family and the Ute Tribe “by participating in, tacitly\nallowing, or failing to prevent, the desecration of Murray’s body and the spoliation of\n\n\n32 Although the District Court decision addressed only the state and local officers named\nin the suit, in the District Court’s spoliation order, the District Court noted that “[t]he State\nDefendants and Uintah County Defendants had no responsibility to ensure that Detective\nNorton's firearm was tested. . . . As part of his investigation, Agent Ashdown possibly\nshould have taken Detective Norton's firearm to have necessary tests performed. But\nAgent Ashdown is not a named Defendant.” Jones et al. v. Norton, et al., 2014 WL\n909569, at *7. As determined above, however, only affirmative acts trigger the “bad men”\nprovision of the 1868 Treaty. Plaintiffs offer no claims as to what affirmative action by\nfederal officials took place on Tribal lands which would implicate the “bad men” provision\nof the 1868 Treaty.\n                                               48\n\fcritical evidence both at the shooting scene and afterwards at the Medical Center,\nBlackburn Mortuary, and at the Utah OME,” plaintiffs have failed to state a claim. The\nremaining portions of plaintiffs’ allegations (i) and (iv) in the amended complaint for\nviolation of the 1863 and 1868 Treaties and other federal laws are dismissed for failure\nto state a claim.33\n\nBreach of Trust\n\n        Regarding Count II of plaintiffs’ amended complaint, “BREACH OF TRUST IN\nVIOLATION OF THE UTE TREATIES AND OTHER FEDERAL LAW defendant argues\nthat this court lacks subject matter jurisdiction. (capitalization in original).\n\n       The plaintiffs’ amended complaint states, in part:\n\n       By failing to investigate Todd Murray’s death and by taking no action to\n       promote justice in Indian Country, Special Agent Rex Ashdown and David\n       Ryan and BIA Officers James Beck, Terrance Cuch and Kevin Myore\n       breached their duties to the Ute Tribe, to Todd Murray, and to Murray’s\n33As noted above, plaintiffs also included a separate, additional list of allegations in the\namended complaint against the defendant claiming:\n\n       In April 2007, Todd Murray, Todd Murray’s family, and the Ute Indian Tribe\n       suffered “injuries” at the hands of “bad men” as those terms are used in the\n       Ute Treaties of 1863 and 1868. These injuries include (i) the extra-territorial\n       police pursuit, assault upon and murder of Todd Murray, (ii) the conspiracy\n       to cover up Todd Murray’s murder, (iii) the failure of federal officers to take\n       custody of Murray’s body and to secure the body against desecration and\n       spoliation of evidence; (iv) the desecration of Murray’s body and the\n       spoliation of critical evidence both at the shooting scene and afterwards at\n       the Medical Center, Blackburn Mortuary, and at the Utah OME; (v) the\n       failure to insure that a proper autopsy was performed on Murray’s body;\n       [sic] (vii) failure of federal officers to conduct any kind of investigation into\n       Todd Murray’s murder; and (vi) the failure of federal officers to protect the\n       territorial integrity of the Tribe’s reservation boundary and the Tribe’s\n       sovereign interests in the crime scene where Murray was shot.\n\nThe court notes that of these additional claims, numbers (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi), and (viii),\noverlap with the allegations in the amended complaint addressed above. For claim (i),\nfrom the separate list of claims, “the extra-territorial police pursuit, assault upon and\nmurder of Todd Murray,” the extra-territorial pursuit also is not covered by the “bad men”\nprovision of the 1868 Treaty. For the remaining elements of claim (i) from the separate,\nadditional list of claims, “assault upon and murder of Todd Murray,” the United States\nDistrict Court for the District of Utah determined that the Mr. Murray’s injury is consistent\nwith a self-inflicted gunshot wound, and, in this court, plaintiffs are estopped from claiming\notherwise. Therefore, if the court were to consider the additional claims, additional claim\n(i) also fails to state a claim.\n                                               49\n\f       family under the Ute Treaties of 1863 and 1868 and under the various\n       federal laws listed under Paragraph 10 above.[34]\n                                             ...\n       In violation of federal law and its treaty obligations, the United States has\n       failed to investigate or prosecute the individuals involved in the shooting\n       death of 21 year-old Todd Murray on April 1, 2007, or the subsequent\n       conspiracy to suppress, alter, and destroy critical evidence related to the\n       shooting death.\n\n       The United States has also breached its trust obligations to the Tribe and\n       Murray’s family by failing to protect the territorial integrity of the Tribe’s\n       reservation and the Tribe’s sovereign interest in the shooting site, thus\n       allowing unauthorized persons to trespass on the Ute homeland and cause\n       harm to tribal members with complete impunity.\n\n\n34 The federal laws listed in paragraph include “the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848,\nincluding, without limitation, the Indian Country Crimes Act, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1151, 1152; the\nMajor Crimes Act, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1153, 2343; the Assimilative Crimes Act, 18 U.S.C. § 13;\nPublic Law 280, U.S.C. §1162; the Indian Civil Rights Act, 25 U.S.C. §§ 1301, 1302, 1321;\nand 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981, 1983, 1985.” Plaintiffs do not explain how any of the citations\nlisted establish money-mandating statutes to invoke jurisdiction in this court. Moreover,\nthis court specifically does not have jurisdiction under the Civil Rights Acts inclusive of 42\nU.S.C. §§ 1981, 1983, 1985. See Pikulin v. United States, 97 Fed. Cl. 71, 77 (2011).\nFurthermore, the Federal Circuit has held that the Indian Civil Rights Act “does not impose\nduties upon the federal government or its officials.” Wopsock v. Natchees, 454 F.3d 1327,\n1333 (Fed. Cir. 2006). In addition, to the extent plaintiffs seek to raise claims based on\ntortious behavior by invoking these or other statutes separate from their claims of\nviolations of the 1863 and 1868 Treaties, this court lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate those\nclaims. The Tucker Act expressly excludes tort claims, including those committed by\nfederal officials, from the jurisdiction of the United States Court of Federal Claims. See\n28 U.S.C. § 1491(a) (“The United States Court of Federal Claims shall have jurisdiction\nto render judgment upon any claim against the United States founded either upon the\nConstitution, or any Act of Congress or any regulation of an executive department, or\nupon any express or implied contract with the United States, or for liquidated or\nunliquidated damages in cases not sounding in tort.”); see also Keene Corp. v. United\nStates, 508 U.S. 200, 214 (1993); Rick’s Mushroom Serv., Inc. v. United States, 521 F.3d\nat 1343. Moreover, to the extent, plaintiffs seek to raise claims of criminal behavior by\ninvoking these or other statutes, separate from their claims of violations of the 1863 and\n1868 Treaties, this court also lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate those claims. See Joshua v.\nUnited States, 17 F.3d 378, 379 (Fed. Cir. 1994); see also Cooper v. United States, 104\nFed. Cl. 306, 312 (2012) (holding that “this court does not have jurisdiction over [plaintiff’s]\nclaims because the court may review neither criminal matters, nor the decisions of district\ncourts.”) (internal citations omitted); Mendes v. United States, 88 Fed. Cl. 759, 762,\nappeal dismissed, 375 F. App’x 4 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Hufford v. United States, 87 Fed. Cl.\n696, 702 (2009) (holding that the United States Court of Federal Claims lacked jurisdiction\nover claims arising from the violation of a criminal statute).\n                                              50\n\f       Plaintiffs contend that the 1863 and 1868 Ute Treaties created, and impose,\nspecific fiduciary duties on the United States, namely to protect Indian lands from\n“unauthorized state intrusion” and to prosecute and “punish any ‘bad man’ that commits\nany wrong upon the person or property of the Indians.” Plaintiffs claim that the United\nStates “promised” these guarantees to the Ute people, and allege that in failing to prevent\ntrespass onto tribal lands and in neglecting to investigate and prosecute the alleged “bad\nmen,” the United States has breached its duties under the treaty agreement.\n\n       As noted above, the Tucker Act grants jurisdiction to this court as follows:\n\n       The United States Court of Federal Claims shall have jurisdiction to render\n       judgment upon any claim against the United States founded either upon the\n       Constitution, or any Act of Congress or any regulation of an executive\n       department, or upon any express or implied contract with the United States,\n       or for liquidated or unliquidated damages in cases not sounding in tort.\n\n28 U.S.C. § 1491(a)(1). As interpreted by the United States Supreme Court, and as\ndiscussed above, the Tucker Act waives sovereign immunity to allow jurisdiction over\nclaims against the United States (1) founded on an express or implied contract with the\nUnited States, (2) seeking a refund from a prior payment made to the government, or (3)\nbased on federal constitutional, statutory, or regulatory law mandating compensation by\nthe federal government for damages sustained. See Navajo Nation II, 556 U.S. at 289–\n90; Mitchell II, 463 U.S. at 216; see also Greenlee Cnty., Ariz. v. United States, 487 F.3d\nat 875; Palmer v. United States, 168 F.3d at 1314.\n\n       To prove that a statute or regulation is money-mandating, a plaintiff must\ndemonstrate that an independent source of substantive law relied upon “‘can fairly be\ninterpreted as mandating compensation by the Federal Government.’” Navajo Nation II,\n556 U.S. at 290 (quoting United States v. Testan, 424 U.S. at 400); see also United States\nv. White Mountain Apache Tribe, 537 U.S. at 472; Mitchell II, 463 U.S. at 217; Blueport\nCo., LLC v. United States, 533 F.3d at 1383. The source of law granting monetary relief\nmust be distinct from the Tucker Act itself. See Navajo Nation II, 556 U.S. at 290 (The\nTucker Act does not create “substantive rights; [it is simply a] jurisdictional provision[] that\noperate[s] to waive sovereign immunity for claims premised on other sources of law (e.g.,\nstatutes or contracts).”).\n\n       As explained by the Supreme Court in Navajo Nation II:\n\n       Neither the Tucker Act nor the Indian Tucker Act creates substantive rights;\n       they are simply jurisdictional provisions that operate to waive sovereign\n       immunity for claims premised on other sources of law (e.g., statutes or\n       contracts). United States v. Testan, 424 U.S. 392, 400, 96 S. Ct. 948, 47\n       L.Ed.2d 114 (1976); United States v. Mitchell, 445 U.S. 535, 538, 100 S. Ct.\n       1349, 63 L.Ed.2d 607 (1980) (Mitchell I). The other source of law need not\n       explicitly provide that the right or duty it creates is enforceable through a\n\n                                              51\n\f      suit for damages, but it triggers liability only if it “‘can fairly be interpreted as\n      mandating compensation by the Federal Government.’” Testan, supra, at\n      400, 96 S. Ct. 948 (quoting Eastport S.S. Corp. v. United States, 178 Ct. Cl.\n      599, 607, 372 F.2d 1002, 1009 (1967)); see also United States v. Mitchell,\n      463 U.S. 206, 218, 103 S. Ct. 2961, 77 L.Ed.2d 580 (1983) (Mitchell II);\n      Navajo I, 537 U.S., at 503, 123 S. Ct. 1079.\n\n      As we explained in Navajo I, there are thus two hurdles that must be cleared\n      before a tribe can invoke jurisdiction under the Indian Tucker Act. First, the\n      tribe “must identify a substantive source of law that establishes specific\n      fiduciary or other duties, and allege that the Government has failed faithfully\n      to perform those duties.” Id., at 506, 123 S. Ct. 1079. “If that threshold is\n      passed, the court must then determine whether the relevant source of\n      substantive law ‘can fairly be interpreted as mandating compensation for\n      damages sustained as a result of a breach of the duties [the governing law]\n      impose[s].’” Ibid. (alteration in original). At the second stage, principles of\n      trust law might be relevant “in drawing the inference that Congress intended\n      damages to remedy a breach.” United States v. White Mountain Apache\n      Tribe, 537 U.S. 465, 477, 123 S. Ct. 1126, 155 L.Ed.2d 40 (2003).\n\nNavajo Nation II, 556 U.S. at 290-91; see also Mitchell II, 463 U.S. at 216. The Supreme\nCourt in Mitchell II also noted that the existence of “a general trust relationship between\nthe United States and the Indian people” is undisputed. See Mitchell II, 463 U.S. at 225.\nIn the Navajo Nation I, the Supreme Court noted that\n\n      To state a claim cognizable under the Indian Tucker Act, Mitchell I and\n      Mitchell II thus instruct, a Tribe must identify a substantive source of law\n      that establishes specific fiduciary or other duties, and allege that the\n      Government has failed faithfully to perform those duties. See 463 U.S., at\n      216–217, 219, 103 S. Ct. 2961. If that threshold is passed, the court must\n      then determine whether the relevant source of substantive law “can fairly\n      be interpreted as mandating compensation for damages sustained as a\n      result of a breach of the duties [the governing law] impose[s].” Id., at 219,\n      103 S. Ct. 2961. Although “the undisputed existence of a general trust\n      relationship between the United States and the Indian people” can\n      “reinforc[e]” the conclusion that the relevant statute or regulation imposes\n      fiduciary duties, id., at 225, 103 S. Ct. 2961, that relationship alone is\n      insufficient to support jurisdiction under the Indian Tucker Act. Instead, the\n      analysis must train on specific rights-creating or duty-imposing statutory or\n      regulatory prescriptions. Those prescriptions need not, however, expressly\n      provide for money damages; the availability of such damages may be\n      inferred.\n\nNavajo Nation I, 537 U.S. at 506; see also Round Valley Indian Tribes v. United States,\n97 Fed. Cl. 500, 510 (2011) (quoting Navajo Nation I, 537 U.S. at 490) (“The ‘general\n\n\n\n                                               52\n\ftrust relationship between the United States and the Indian people’ alone . . . is insufficient\nto establish jurisdiction” in the Court of Federal Claims.).\n\n        In describing the “two hurdles, the Navajo Nation court explained that “[f]irst, the\ntribe ‘must identify a substantive source of law that establishes specific fiduciary or other\nduties, and allege that the Government has failed faithfully to perform those duties.’” Id.\nat 290 (quoting United States v. Navajo Nation, 537 U.S. at 506). Regarding the second\nhurdle, the Navajo Nation II court noted\n\n       “If that threshold is passed, the court must then determine whether the\n       relevant source of substantive law ‘can fairly be interpreted as mandating\n       compensation for damages sustained as a result of a breach of the duties\n       [the governing law] impose[s].’” Ibid. (alteration in original). At the second\n       stage, principles of trust law might be relevant “in drawing the inference that\n       Congress intended damages to remedy a breach.” United States v. White\n       Mountain Apache Tribe, 537 U.S. 465, 477, 123 S. Ct. 1126, 155 L.Ed.2d\n       40 (2003).\n\nNavajo Nation II, 556 U.S. at 290-91. Specifically, “[t]he Government . . . is not a private\ntrustee.” United States v. Jicarilla Apache Nation, 131 S. Ct. 2313, 2323 (2011). As such,\nthe Indian trust relationship “is defined and governed by statutes rather than the common\nlaw,” id. and “[t]he Government assumes Indian trust responsibilities only to the extent it\nexpressly accepts those responsibilities by statute.” Id. at 2325. The Supreme Court in\nJicarilla Apache Nation, determined, therefore, “Congress may style its relations with the\nIndians a ‘trust’ without assuming all the fiduciary duties of a private trustee, creating a\ntrust relationship that is ‘limited’ or ‘bare’ compared to a trust relationship between private\nparties at common law.” Id. at 2323 (quoting Mitchell I, 445 U.S. at 542). The trust\nrelationship, therefore, is limited to the management of tribal lands and assets.\n\n         In its motion to dismiss, defendant contends that the plaintiffs’ breach of trust claim\n“fail[s] to identify a substantive source of law that establishes specific fiduciary duties.”\nDefendant argues that “a fiduciary duty only arises if it is plain from the relevant statutes\nor regulations that the government has accepted such a responsibility.” Defendant\ncontends that because plaintiffs’ claims have no foundation in any substantive body of\nlaw, it fails to acquire subject-matter jurisdiction under the Tucker Act and therefore\nwarrants dismissal pursuant to RCFC 12(b)(1).\n\n        Plaintiffs correctly note that the Supreme Court has held that “any ambiguities in\nthe language of an Indian treaty must be resolved in favor of the Indians and courts must\nendeavor to ‘give effect to the terms as the Indians themselves would have understood\nthem.’” (quoting Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa Indians v. Minnesota, 526 U.S. 172, 196-\n203 (1999)). Defendant argues, however, “Plaintiffs fail to identify any specific,\nunambiguous language in the Treaties that impose a fiduciary duty on the United States\nto guard against the assertion of state criminal jurisdiction.” Plaintiffs respond that Article\n10 of the 1863 Treaty and Article 2 and Article 6 of the 1868 Treaty confer upon the Ute\ntribe the substantive source of law that establishes specific fiduciary or other duties.\n\n                                              53\n\f       Article 10 of the 1863 Treaty provides:\n\n       Each family that shall announce through its head to the agent of the band a\n       willingness and determination to begin and follow the pursuits of agriculture,\n       by farming or raising stock and growing wool, upon such lands and\n       according to such regulations as the Secretary of the Interior may prescribe,\n       shall receive the following donations of stock to aid them in their endeavor\n       to gain a livelihood by such new pursuits, viz.:\n\n       Of cattle, one head annually during five years, beginning with the ratification\n       of this treaty.\n\n       Of sheep, ten head annually during the first two years after the ratification\n       of this treaty, and five head annually during the three years thereafter.\n\n       The Secretary of the Interior may also direct that their share of annuity\n       goods and provisions shall be of a character suited to such change of life:\n       Provided, however, That such stock shall only be donated as long as such\n       family shall in good faith keep and use the same for the purpose indicated\n       in this article.\n\n       All the Indians of said band who may adopt and conform to the provisions\n       of this article shall be protected in the quiet and peaceable possession of\n       their said lands and property.\n\n1863 Treaty, Art. 10 (emphasis in original). Plaintiffs also contend generally that the\nUnited States, “due to its absolute jurisdiction and control over Indian lands . . . has a\nspecific fiduciary duty to protect the reservation from the imposition of state criminal\njurisdiction over tribal members.” Plaintiffs, however, only cite to Navajo Tribe of Indians,\n624 F.2d at 989, and 25 U.S.C. § 200 (2012), which requires “a report or record” be\nsubmitted to the superintendent of the reservation whenever an Indian is confined or\nimprisoned on lands held in reserve. Plaintiffs do not elaborate how this creates the\nexistence of specific fiduciary duties between the United States and the Ute Indians, or\nany duties that are money-mandating regarding the alleged imprisonment or confinement.\nMoreover, Article 10 only addresses the land allotment for the Ute Indians who wish to\n“begin and follow agricultural or pastoral pursuits by farming or raising stock and growing\nwool, upon such lands and according to such regulations as the Secretary of the Interior\nmay prescribe” Id. Article 10 of the 1863 Treaty does not provide a specific fiduciary\nmoney mandating duty.\n\n      Plaintiffs also allege that Article 2 of the 1868 Ute Treaty establishes a duty to\nprevent trespass. In relevant part, Article 2 reads:\n\n       [N]o persons, except those authorized so to do, and except such officers,\n       agents, and employes [sic] of the Government as may be authorized to\n\n                                             54\n\f       enter upon Indian reservations in discharge of duties enjoined by law shall\n       ever be permitted to pass over, settle upon, or reside in the Territory\n       described in this article, except as herein otherwise provided.\n\n1868 Treaty, Art. 2. Defendant, notes, however, that “[p]laintiffs admit that ‘some courts\nhave held that the duty of the United States to ensure the quiet enjoyment of reservation\nlands does not make the government liable for general trespasses by third parties.’”\nMoreover, defendant notes that “[c]onspicuously absent in the events that constitute the\nalleged trespass of state law enforcement officials on the Reservation is the presence of\nany federal law enforcement officer.” In the amended complaint, the plaintiffs specifically\nidentify state officers, but not the federal officers, as having no right to be on the\nreservation. The amended complaint states: “Murray was shot after being pursued at gun-\npoint by two Utah state Highway Troopers, a Uintah County Sheriff’s Deputy, and an off-\nduty Vernal City, Utah, police officer. The pursuit took place over tribal trust lands more\nthan 25 miles inside the northern boundary of the U&O Reservation. The four shooting-\ninvolved officers had no criminal jurisdiction over Indians inside the U&O Reservation.”\nFor each of the four state officers, the amended complaint also alleges they are “not\ncross-deputized by the federal government or the Ute Tribe to exercise law enforcement\npowers over Native Americans inside the Ute Tribe’s Reservation.” The plaintiffs, do not,\nhowever, make a cross-deputized claim against any of the federal officials.\n\n          Finally, according to plaintiffs, the United States’ failure to prosecute the bad men\nwho murdered Mr. Murray and conspired to cover up the murder on April 1, 2007\nrepresents a breach of trust. Article 6 of the 1868 Treaty promises that “the United States\nwill . . . proceed at once to cause the offender to be arrested and punished according to\nthe laws of the United States.” 1868 Treaty, Art. 6. Plaintiffs argue that\n\n       The “bad men” clause of the 1868 Treaty, further expands the duty of the\n       U.S. to protect not only the Ute Tribe as a whole in its quiet possession of\n       the reservation lands, but also the individual Ute Indians against “any\n       wrong” perpetrated on them by any non-Indian.\n\n       Defendant contends that the 1868 Ute Treaty provision is not trust-creating, but\nrather bestows discretionary power upon the United States to prosecute bad men.\nMoreover, defendant states “[w]e do not question that the Treaty requires payment to\nindividuals under the ‘Bad Men’ clause, if the requirements of the Treaty are met. The\nTreaties, however, impose a duty upon the government to only pay individual members,\nnot the Tribe, in the event that unauthorized persons cause harm to person or property.”\n(emphasis in original). Moreover, for count one, this court did not find the United States\nhad violated the “bad men” provision as a result of the actions involving Mr. Murray’s\ndeath, and for count two, plaintiffs’ claims are repetitive of count one, as they specifically\nrepeat and re-allege the claims in count two.\n\n       None of the citations to the 1863 and 1868 Treaties provide a source of jurisdiction\nfor the breach of trust claims alleged by plaintiffs. Furthermore, none of the plaintiffs’\nbreach of trust claims identify any substantive law containing the “express language of a\n\n                                              55\n\ftrust.” See Samish Indian Nation v. United States, 419 F.3d at 1368. Moreover, plaintiffs\nhave not demonstrated how “[t]he United States has also breached its trust obligations to\nthe Tribe and Murray’s family by failing to protect the territorial integrity of the Tribe’s\nreservation and the Tribe’s sovereign interest in the shooting site, thus allowing\nunauthorized persons to trespass on the Ute homeland and cause harm to tribal members\nwith complete impunity,” or that “[t]he Defendant’s breach of its trust and treaty obligations\nhas resulted in substantial loss to the Tribe.” The court agrees with defendant that, “[i]n\nfact, Plaintiffs have not identified any ‘specific right-creating or duty-imposing statutory or\nregulatory prescriptions’ that establish ‘specific fiduciary or other duties’ that the United\nStates allegedly has failed to fulfill” as part of its trust duties. (quoting Navajo I, 537 U.S.\nat 506).\n\n        The court also agrees with defendant that “authority to institute both civil and\ncriminal litigation on behalf of the United States is committed to the discretion of the\nAttorney General.” (citing 28 U.S.C. § 516 (2012). The defendant further argues that “[t]he\nAttorney General’s exercise of his discretion to file litigation on behalf of the United States\nis ‘presumptively immune from judicial review.’” (quoting Shoshone Bannock Tribes v.\nReno, 56 F.3d 1476, 1480 (D.C. Cir. 1995)). Article 6 of the 1868 Treaty provides that the\nUnited States will “reimburse the injured person for the loss sustained,” however, payment\nis contingent on the “bad men” “offender” being “arrested and punished according to the\nlaws of the United States. . . .” 1868 Treaty, Art. 6. As noted above, the record does not\nreflect any prosecutions were initiated against any individuals named by the plaintiffs in\nthe above captioned case. Moreover, the decision issued by the United States District\nCourt for the District of Utah did not find any culpability on the part of any individual\naccused by plaintiffs in the death of Mr. Murray, further suggesting no reimbursement to\nthe plaintiffs is warranted. For the foregoing reasons, defendant’s motion to dismiss\nplaintiffs’ breach of trust claims for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction is granted.\n\n                                       CONCLUSION\n\n        Because plaintiffs have failed to state a claim and have not demonstrated\njurisdiction is proper in this court, defendant’s motion to dismiss is GRANTED. Plaintiffs’\namended complaint is DISMISSED. The Clerk's Office shall enter JUDGMENT consistent\nwith this opinion.\n\n       IT IS SO ORDERED.\n\n\n                                                            s/Marian Blank Horn\n                                                            MARIAN BLANK HORN\n                                                                     Judge\n\n\n\n\n                                              56\n\f",

Post, individually and as the natural\nparents of Todd R. Murray; Debra Jones, as personal representative of the Estate of Todd\nR. Murray, deceased, for and on behalf of the heirs of Todd R. Murray, and the Ute Indian\nTribe of the Uintah and Ouray Reservation.” Plaintiffs Jones and Post are the biological\nparents of Todd R. Murray, a 21-year old member of the Ute Indian Tribe, whose death\nis the basis for the above captioned case, filed against the United States for violation of\n\fa radio dispatch from his patrol car advising the Utah central Police Dispatch that he was\npursuing a car containing ‘two tribal males’ for a speeding violation.” Trooper Swenson\nlater testified2 that the vehicle was traveling 74 miles per hour in a 65 mile an hour zone.\nThe driver of the vehicle was 17-year-old Uriah Kurip, and his lone passenger was the\ndecedent, 21-year-old Todd Murray. The alleged speeding violation occurred just outside\nthe boundary of the Ute Tribe’s Uncompaghre Reservation in Utah. In what Trooper\nSwenson later testified he viewed as an attempt to evade police pursuit, Mr. Kurip turned\noff U.S. Highway 40, onto State Road 88, an intersection located more than two miles\noutside the boundary of the Uncompahgre Reservation. Although Trooper Swenson\nbegan his pursuit off the Uncompaghre Reservation, the pursuit carried into the\nUncompaghre Reservation, land held by the Ute Indians, and ended 25 miles south of\nthe intersection of U.S. 40 and State Road 8 at the intersection of Seep Ridge Road and\nTurkey Track Road, an intersection also inside the boundary of the Uncompaghre\nReservation. Once stopped, Mr. Kurip and Mr. Murray exited their vehicle and stood on\neither side of the vehicle. The amended complaint reflects that Trooper Swenson testified\nthat he exited his vehicle with his gun drawn and ordered the two to the ground. Mr. Kurip\nand Mr. Murray exchanged looks and Trooper Swenson repeated the command two or\nthree times, after which Mr. Kurip and Mr. Murray ran from their vehicle in opposite\ndirections. Trooper Swenson pursued Mr. Kurip on foot and quickly apprehended him.\n\n       Responding to Trooper Swenson’s earlier radio dispatch requests for help, off-duty\nVernal City police officer Vance Norton was next to arrive on the scene, dressed in street\nclothes and driving his personal vehicle. Officer Norton set off on foot in pursuit of Mr.\nMurray. Utah Highway Patrol Trooper Craig Young and Uintah County Deputy Anthoney\nByron subsequently joined in the search. Officer Norton later testified he eventually\nencountered Mr. Murray as Mr. Murray was rounding a hill. According to the amended\ncomplaint, Officer Norton testified he saw Mr. Murray before Mr. Murray saw him. Officer\nNorton allegedly raised his gun and shouted, “POLICE—GET TO THE GROUND.”\n(capitalization in original). Also, according to the amended complaint, Officer Norton\nrecalled seeing something in Mr. Murray’s hand, but admitted that he could not tell what\nwas in Mr. Murray’s hand. Defendant indicates in its motion to dismiss that it was later\ndetermined Mr. Murray was carrying an illegally purchased .380 caliber handgun. Further,\naccording to plaintiffs’ amended complaint, Officer Norton indicated Mr. Murray raised his\nhand and fired shots, and Officer Norton, in turn, fired two rounds at Mr. Murray. The\namended complaint states that “Norton alleges that Murray then turned the gun on himself\nand pulled the trigger. Officer Norton contacted dispatch, advised that shots had been\nfired and that Murray had shot himself.” “At the time of the shooting, Officers Byron and\nYoung state they were approaching from the south with their firearms drawn. Officers\nByron and Young worked together to handcuff Murray.” Plaintiffs contend that Trooper\n\n\nthe Ute treaties and federal statutes and breach of trust in violation of the Ute treaties\nfederal statutes.\n2 Although the amended complaint repeatedly refers to “testimony” by multiple individuals,\nthe amended complaint does not indicate how or under what circumstances the\n“testimony” was taken.\n                                             2\n\fSwenson, Officer Norton, “Defendant” Byron, and “Defendant” Young3 are not cross-\ndeputized by the federal government or the Ute Tribe to exercise law enforcement powers\nover Native Americans inside the Ute Tribe’s Reservation.4\n\n        After the shooting, a number of other officers arrived at the scene, including\nSpecial Agents Rex Ashdown and David Ryan with the Federal Bureau of Investigation\n(FBI) and various officials from the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). In their amended\ncomplaint, plaintiffs allege that the FBI and BIA officers “ostensibly assumed jurisdiction\nof the scene” because “the shooting scene was in Indian Country,” yet “[t]he FBI and BIA\nofficers on the scene were complicit in the State officers’ improper assertion of\njurisdictional authority over the shooting site.” Plaintiffs further allege that Raymond\n\n3 Although plaintiffs refer to Officers Young and Bryon as “defendants” in the amended\ncomplaint, the only proper defendant in the United States Court of Federal Claims is the\nUnited States. See Rule 10(a) of the Rules of the United States Court of Federal Claims\n(RCFC) (2014) (“The title of the complaint must name all the parties . . . , with the United\nStates designated as the party defendant.”). The United States Supreme Court has\nindicated that for suits filed in the United States Court of Federal Claims and its\npredecessors, “[i]f the relief sought is against others than the United States the suit as to\nthem must be ignored as beyond the jurisdiction of the court.” United States v.

The pursuit took place over tribal trust lands more\n       than 25 miles inside the northern boundary of the U&O Reservation. The\n       four shooting-involved officers had no criminal jurisdiction over Indians\n       inside the U&O Reservation. The officers also had no probable cause to\n       believe that Todd Murray had committed any crime.\n\n(internal citation omitted).\n                                             3\n\fWissiup, a member of the Ute Tribe and a certified law enforcement officer was excluded\nfrom the scene. In addition, plaintiffs contend that the law enforcement officers did not\nsegregate, question, or search the officers involved in Mr. Murray’s shooting, nor properly\nprocess their firearms.\n\n        At 11:30 a.m., immediately following the shooting, “Officer Norton contacted\ndispatch, advised that shots had been fired and that Murray had shot himself.” Plaintiffs\nallege that an ambulance did not arrive on the scene until 12:02 p.m., and further allege\nthat prior to its arrival, Mr. Murray was alive, but no state or federal officer provided him\nmedical aid. According to the amended complaint, when the ambulance arrived on the\nscene, Mr. Murray’s “breathing was labored, his limbs were twitching, and he was\nunconscious. There was a copious amount of blood around his head.” The ambulance\ntransported Mr. Murray to Ashely Valley Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead\nat 1:19 p.m. According to the amended complaint, the “FBI and the BIA officers then\nallowed the Utah state, county and municipal officers to transport Murray’s body to the\nThomson-Blackburn Vernal Mortuary (Mortuary) in Vernal, Utah, for holding overnight\nuntil the body could be transported to the Utah State Medical Examiner’s office for an\nautopsy the next day.”\n\n        Plaintiffs contend that the FBI and BIA officers “took no action to secure Todd\nMurray’s remains or the crime scene itself.” Plaintiffs also assert that “municipal officers\npresent at the medical center proceeded to violate Murray’s dignity and to tamper with\nthe physical evidence.” While at the hospital, plaintiffs allege that Mr. Murray’s body was\nunnecessarily and inappropriately disrobed, manipulated, and photographed. Officer\nByron was allegedly photographed with his finger inserted in Mr. Murray’s head wound.\nPlaintiffs assert that BIA Officer Kevin Myore was present at the medical center and\n“condoned and participated in, or failed to prevent, the illegal and unethical desecration\nof Mr. Murray’s remains and the spoliation of critical evidence.” Plaintiffs also claim that\n“Special Agent Ashdown took no action to secure and preserve Mr. Murray’s body at the\nMortuary” and instead was “complicit in the additional acts of horrific desecration and\nevidence tampering that took place at the Mortuary.” Further, plaintiffs claim that the\nVernal City Police Chief Gary Jensen “admits” to inserting a needle into Mr. Murray to\ndraw blood, and allege that “Chief Jensen then allegedly directed a mortuary employee\nto make an unauthorized incision to Murray’s jugular vein, from which two vials of blood\nwere purportedly drawn, although neither the Utah state nor the federal law enforcement\nofficers have ever accounted for the blood vials drawn from Murray’s body at the\nMortuary.” Plaintiffs also contend, “[n]either the Mortuary, nor any law enforcement\nofficers, obtained the permission of Mr. Murray's next of kin to desecrate Todd Murray’s\nremains in this manner.”\n\n       The amended complaint states that Mr. Murray’s body was next transported to the\nUtah Office of the Medical Examiner. The Utah Office of the Medical Examiner allegedly\n“elected to forego an autopsy and to perform only a simple external examination of Mr.\nMurray’s body.” Plaintiffs indicate that:\n\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\f       OME’s [Utah Office of the Medical Examiner’s] final pathological diagnosis\n       was that the entrance wound on Mr. Murray's head was on the lateral left\n       scalp and the exit wound was on the upper posterior right scalp. Thus, the\n       gunshot wound that killed Todd R. Murray entered on the left side of Mr.\n       Murray's head and exited on the right side of Mr. Murray's head.\n\n(emphasis in original). Plaintiffs further note that the Utah Office of the Medical Examiner\nreported that Mr. Murray arrived with his hands “bagged” and that no soot was found on\neither of Mr. Murray’s hands, his left hand was clean and free of any debris or blood, and\nhis right hand was bloody. Moreover, plaintiffs allege that “the FBI officers and the BIA\nofficers allowed the Utah Medical Examiner’s Office to list the cause of Todd Murray’s\ndeath as a suicide, when the Medical Examiner himself later testified that he could not\nrule out the possibility that Todd Murray was shot in the back of his head execution style.”\nPlaintiffs, therefore, challenge Officer’s Norton version of events and state that “Todd\nMurray did not shoot himself execution-style in the back of his head.” (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\n        In addition, plaintiffs contend that “all of the evidence the FBI and BIA officers were\nresponsible for—and that would have been of a dispositive nature in this case—has been\ndestroyed or altered,” and that, throughout, the FBI and BIA officers disregarded proper\ninvestigatory procedure and preservation of evidence. Specifically, plaintiffs contend that\nthe firearm that Mr. Murray allegedly fired during his encounter with Officer Norton was\ndestroyed by the FBI and not forensically tested and that Mr. Murray’s person or clothing\nwere never forensically tested. Plaintiffs contend the same regarding preservation and\nforensic testing of Officer Norton’s firearm, personal vehicle, person, and clothing.\nPlaintiffs further contend that Officer Norton was not sequestered, but was allowed free\naccess to the scene of the shooting, thereby giving Officer Norton the “opportunity to\ntamper with the physical evidence.” Plaintiffs also allege other failures, including lack of\ndocumentation of the scene, failure to administer medical aid to Mr. Murray, improper\nhandling of, and tampering with, Mr. Murray’s body at the medical center, mortuary, and\nUtah Office of the Medical Examiner, resulting in “significantly altered and potentially\ndestroyed critical evidence,” and failure by the Utah Office of the Medical Examiner to\nperform an autopsy of Mr. Murray’s body.\n\n       According to the complaint, “[t]hree weeks after the shooting, members of Todd\nMurray’s family met with FBI Agent Ashdown.” Plaintiffs allege that “[t]he family members\nexplained to Agent Ashdown that Todd Murray was a right-handed individual; they told\nAshdown it would have been impossible for Murray to shoot himself in the back of the\nhead, above and behind his left ear.”5 Mr. Murray’s family urged Special Agent Ashdown\nto investigate and revisit the circumstances of Mr. Murray’s death. According to plaintiffs,\nSpecial Agent Ashdown “promised the family members that the FBI would conduct a full\ninvestigation” yet despite this promise, the United States has never conducted a civil or\n\n\n5 According to the amended complaint, “Agent Ashdown admitted to the family members\nthat it would be impossible for a right-handed individual to shoot himself in the back of the\nhead, above and behind his left ear.”\n                                              5\n\fcriminal investigation into “the actions of any single individual” involved in the\ncircumstances surrounding Mr. Murray’s death, nor of the investigatory and preservation\nprocedures immediately following. Plaintiffs contend that Special Agent Ashdown later\nadmitted under oath that he conducted no investigation into the shooting of Mr. Murray\nlargely because of his long-standing relationship with Officer Norton.\n\n        On July 17, 2009, Debra Jones, individually, as the natural parent of Todd Murray,\nand as personal representative of the Estate of Todd R. Murray for and on behalf of Mr.\nMurray’s heirs, and Arden Post, individually and as the natural parent of Todd Murray,\nfiled suit in the Uintah County Court regarding the death of Mr. Murray.

Subsequently, the suit was removed to the United\nStates District Court for the District of Utah on August 20, 2009.\n\n        On March 12, 2013, while the District Court case was pending, plaintiffs mailed a\nletter to senior officials at the United States Department of the Interior, giving notice of\ntheir intent to file suit against the United States. The letter was titled “Notice of Claim\nconcerning the April 1, 2007 Shooting Death of Todd Murray, Ute Indian tribal member.”\nThe letter states:\n\n         Dear Messrs. Toulou, Smith, and Washburn and Secretary of the Interior:\n\n         Our law firm represents the Ute Indian Tribe of the Uintah and Ouray\n         Reservation (“Tribe” or “Ute Tribe”). We also represent tribal members\n         Debra Jones and Arden Post who are the parents of Todd Murray, a tribal\n         member who was shot to death in an encounter with Utah state and local\n         police on the Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation in Utah (“U&O\n         Reservation”) in 2007. Please accept this letter as our notice of claim to\n         your respective agencies of our intent to file a complaint against the United\n         States based on breaches of the 1863 and 1868 Ute Treaties and the United\n         States’ violation of its trust obligations to the Ute Tribe and its members.\n\n         We plan to file suit in the Federal Court of Claims and allege that the Federal\n         Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), by and\n         through their employees, committed wrongs upon the person or property of\n\n\n6   The Ute Indian Tribe was not a party to the District Court litigation.\n                                                6\n\fthe Indians, namely decedent Todd Murray his family and the Ute Indian\nTribe as a whole. Included with our letter are the Plaintiffs’ (i) Third\nAmended Complaint, (ii) motion for default judgment on liability based on\ntampering [sic] destruction of critical evidence, and (iii) motion for summary\njudgment under Counts 1, 3 and 5 filed in the parents’ private cause of\naction, DEBRA JONES, et al., v, VANCE NORTON, et al., Civil Case No.\n2:09-cv-00730, U.S. District Court, District of Utah, Central Division.\n\nThe attached filings give an overview of the sequence of events that\ntranspired on April 1, 2007 as well as a clear indication of the egregious\nactions of the law enforcement officers who participated in this\n“investigation.” The FBI and the BIA representatives who were present on\nApril 1, 2007 and who participated in the “investigation” contributed to the\ntravesties by (1) failing to protect the Ute Tribe’s interests as a sovereign in\nthe crime scene, (2) failing to properly preserve and protect evidence from\nbeing tampered with and destroyed, and (3) failing to conduct their own\nindependent investigation into the death of Todd Murray. As a result of the\naforementioned failures, the Murray family and the Ute Indian Tribe are\nseeking damages from the United States in the amount of $10 million, as\nwell as reimbursement of litigation costs and attorney fees.\n\nAttached to this letter is a summary of the relevant Treaty obligations that\nhave been violated by the actions and inactions of the United States in this\ncase. Under Article 6 of the 1863 Treaty, the Ute Indian bands agreed to\nforego \"private revenge or retaliation\" for injuries suffered by the Tribe and\nindividual tribal members as the result of the “misconduct of individuals.” In\nreturn the United States guaranteed the Tribe and individual tribal members\na right to legal redress for \"any robbery violence, or murder\" committed \"on\nan Indian or Indians\" belonging to the Ute Indian bands. Article 6 of the 1868\nTreaty promised that any person violating the territorial integrity of the\nReservation and causing harm to the Tribe or its tribal members would be\n\"punished according to the laws of the United States.\" In violation of these\ntreaty obligations, the United States has failed to investigate or to prosecute\nthe individuals involved in the shooting death of 21 year-old Todd Murray in\nApril 2007, and the subsequent conspiracy to suppress, alter, and destroy\ncritical evidence.\n\nPlease feel free to contact our office should you require any additional\ninformation regarding this forthcoming claim.\n\n\nSincerely,\n\nSandra L. Denton\n\n\n\n\n                                       7\n\f(footnote omitted). The March 12, 2013 letter attached almost four hundred pages of\nexhibits, including filings in the District Court such as the plaintiffs’ third amended\ncomplaint, the motion for summary judgment, and plaintiffs’ motion for allegedly the\ntampering and destruction of critical evidence.\n\n        On March 7, 2014, the District Court granted the defendant’s motion for summary\njudgment, and denied plaintiffs’ cross motion.

They focus on the following\n         events: (1) Trooper Swenson's order to Mr. Kurip and Mr. Murray to stop\n         after the car chase ended and the men got out of the car; (2) the forming of\n         a police perimeter to entrap Mr. Murray; (3) Detective Norton firing at Mr.\n         Murray twice; (4) when Detective Norton's bullet allegedly entered Mr.\n         Murray's head; and (5) Deputy Byron handcuffing Mr. Murray while Trooper\n         Young pointed his gun as cover for Deputy Byron.\n\nJones et al. v.

Detective Norton testified\n       that he was up on a hill when he saw Mr. Murray shoot himself.\n\n       The Deputy Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Edward Leis, who conducted the\n       physical examination of Mr. Murray's body, concluded in his report that the\n       wound was caused by a gun shot “in close proximity to the skin surface\n       when it was discharged.” He based his conclusion on “abundant soot at the\n       inferior margin of the defect [the wound] and some marginal abrasion is also\n       noted at the inferior margin.” In his testimony, he elaborated on his\n       conclusion that the gun was in contact with Mr. Murray's head when it was\n       fired:\n\n              At the perimeter, there are several triangular shaped tears of\n              the wound. That's a result of the gun being pressed up against\n              the skin surface when it's discharged and gases causing the\n              scalp to be separated from the underlying skull. When the\n              scalp lifts up, it stretches and it tears and gets its characteristic\n              stellae appearance.\n\n       The smaller wound on the right side of Mr. Murray's head was, in Dr. Leis'\n       opinion, the exit wound. After Dr. Leis certified that Mr. Murray's death was\n       a suicide resulting from a gunshot wound to the head, he added an\n       additional cause of death (based on results from testing of Mr. Murray's\n       bodily fluids). Because the tests showed the presence of drugs and alcohol\n       in Mr. Murray's system, Dr. Leis issued an amended death certificate which\n       added “Acute alcohol intoxication; recent methamphetamine use” as\n       contributing to Mr. Murray's death.\n\n       Detective Norton was more than 100 yards away when Mr. Murray was\n       shot. Dr. Leis testified that there was no evidence that the wound could have\n       been caused by a shot coming from that far away. Plaintiffs maintain that\n       Detective Norton was not 100 yards away, but was right next to Mr. Murray\n       and so he had the capability of inflicting the contact wound. But the actual\n       evidence in the record (that is, testimony by Detective Norton and Deputy\n       Byron) shows that Detective Norton was not right next to Mr. Murray when\n       the fatal shot was fired.\n\nId. at 1190-91 (footnotes omitted).\n\n      The District Court noted that plaintiffs also alleged the defendant conspired to\ncover up the killing of Mr. Murray, stating, “[s]ummed up, Plaintiffs’ argument is that\nDefendants engaged in ‘[a] conspiracy to cover up a killing.’ Plaintiffs’ theory is that\nDetective Norton shot and killed Mr. Murray, and that the rest of the Defendants conspired\nto cover-up that killing and protect Detective Norton.” Id. at 1197 (footnotes omitted).\nAddressing the plaintiffs’ alleged conspiracy, the court stated: “The focus of the Plaintiffs’\n\n\n\n                                               9\n\fconspiracy theory is the failure to give aid and their spoliation argument about the\ndestruction of evidence.” Id. at 1202.\n\n         Turning to plaintiffs’ claims of the defendants’ failure to give medical aid to Mr.\nMurray, and the defendants’ “interference with Mr. Murray's due process right of access\nto courts via the failure to preserve critical evidence and the affirmative destruction of\ncritical evidence,” the District Court determined,\n\n       [n]one of that testimony could allow a reasonable jury to conclude that\n       Individual Defendants were deliberately indifferent to Mr. Murray's situation,\n       or that they knew that there was a substantial risk of significant harm to Mr.\n       Murray if they did not provide first aid. If anything, the evidence shows that\n       at least three of the Individual Defendants (Young, Davis, and Slaugh) were\n       concerned that attempts to provide any kind of aid to Mr. Murray would do\n       more harm than good.\n\nId. at 1210. The District Court stated: “[i]n sum, there is no evidence before the court to\nsupport a finding that the inaction by each individual defendant was part of a conspiracy\nto let Mr. Murray die.” Id. at 1203. The District Court also determined that, “[b]ased on the\nfacts as detailed and explained in its spoliation order, the court concludes that no\nreasonable jury could conclude that Defendants conspired to ‘effectively eliminate[ ] all\nprobative evidence’ and ‘clean the closet of evidence that would have allowed Plaintiffs\nto build their case.’”9 Id. at 1204 (quoting various plaintiffs’ briefs; omissions in original;\nfootnote omitted). Therefore, the District Court concluded that “the Defendants did not\nviolate Mr. Murray's civil rights for failing to provide medical aid, nor did the Defendants\nfail to preserve evidence.”10 Id. at 1210 (footnote omitted).\n\n\n\n9 In relation to plaintiffs’ claim that defendants’ conspired to violate Mr. Murray's civil rights,\nthe District Court explained that the plaintiffs asked “the court to infer the existence of\nsuch a conspiracy (much like they asked the court to infer racial animus) from a handful\nof facts and the Plaintiffs' speculative characterization of those facts as so ‘brazen and\nflagrant’ and ‘unjustifiable and irrational’ that they support a finding of conspiracy.” Jones\net al. v.

For instance, the plaintiffs argued that “critical evidence was lost\nbecause Mr. Murray's hands were not bagged properly and Mr. Murray's body was not\nproperly preserved because the body bag was incorrectly sealed.” The District Court,\nhowever, determined, that:\n\n       There is no evidence to show that Mr. Murray's hands were bagged\n       improperly. Plaintiffs argue that Mr. Murray's hands must have been\n       improperly bagged because some photographs showed his hands bagged\n       and others did not, but there is no evidence to show who, when, and where\n                                                10\n\f        On April 1, 2013, approximately three weeks after plaintiffs mailed the March 12,\n2013 letter to the Department of the Interior officials, giving notice of their intent to file suit\nin this court, and exactly six years after Todd Murray’s death, plaintiffs filed suit in this\ncourt. Plaintiffs’ suit in this court was consistent with the information submitted in the\nMarch 12, 2013 letter.\n\n       In response, defendant filed a motion to dismiss, pursuant to RCFC 12(b)(1) and\nRCFC 12(b)(6), alleging lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim.\nNotably, defendant argued that “[i]n addition to the various individuals identified in the\nComplaint, Plaintiffs aver that the FBI, BIA, the State of Utah, Unitah County, Vernal city,\nand various non-federal enforcement agencies are ‘bad men’ as that term is used in the\ntreaties.” According to defendant, “[t]he federal government and various state\nenforcement agencies, however, cannot be ‘bad men’ as that term is used in the treaties.”\n\n      Plaintiffs subsequently moved to amend the complaint, and in support of their\nmotion stated:\n\n       The Plaintiffs’ proposed amendments [sic] correct the pleading deficiencies\n       cited by the United States in its motion to dismiss the complaint. The\n       amendments include additional factual allegations to make clear the\n       substance of the Plaintiffs’ allegations, and to make clear that Plaintiffs\n       sought administrative review of Todd Murray’s shooting death before filing\n       this action. The amendments also make clear that Plaintiffs’ claims are\n       based on the actions and inactions of individual federal officers, not the\n       actions or inactions of the federal agencies employing those officers, i.e.,\n       the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Indian Affairs.\n\n       The court granted plaintiffs’ motion, after which plaintiffs filed an amended\ncomplaint. Plaintiffs’ amended complaint, which asserts numerous claims for relief,\nalleges that the United States committed cognizable wrongs upon Mr. Murray and the Ute\nTribe. According to plaintiffs’ amended complaint, the United States, by and through the\nconduct of the FBI and BIA, violated the guarantees of two Ute Treaties, entered into and\nsigned in 1863 and 1868. Plaintiffs also advance a breach of trust claim for the same\nalleged violations and injustices. For these alleged injuries, plaintiffs seek compensatory\ndamages in the amount of $10,000,000.00, as well as costs, attorney’s fees, “and all other\ndamages permitted by the Treaties with the Utes, and such other and further relief as this\nCourt deems proper.”\n\n     Specifically, plaintiffs’ claims for relief, set forth in the amended complaint, are: “I.\nVIOLATION OF THE UTE TREATIES AND OTHHER [sic] FEDERAL LAWS,” and “I.

These injuries include (i) the extra-territorial\n       police pursuit, assault upon and murder of Todd Murray, (ii) the conspiracy\n       to cover up Todd Murray’s murder, (iii) the failure of federal officers to take\n       custody of Murray’s body and to secure the body against desecration and\n       spoliation of evidence; (iv) the desecration of Murray’s body and the\n       spoliation of critical evidence both at the shooting scene and afterwards at\n       the Medical Center, Blackburn Mortuary, and at the Utah OME; (v) the\n       failure to insure that a proper autopsy was performed on Murray’s body;\n       [sic] (vii) failure of federal officers to conduct any kind of investigation into\n       Todd Murray’s murder; and (vi) the failure of federal officers to protect the\n       territorial integrity of the Tribe’s reservation boundary and the Tribe’s\n       sovereign interests in the crime scene where Murray was shot.\n                                               12\n\fevidence related to the shooting death.” Plaintiffs claim that “[b]y failing to investigate\nTodd Murray’s death and by taking no action to promote justice in Indian Country, Special\nAgent Rex Ashdown and David Ryan and BIA Officers James Beck, Terrance Cuch and\nKevin Myore breached their duties to the Ute Tribe, to Todd Murray, and to Murray’s\nfamily under the Ute Treaties of 1863 and 1868. . . .”\n\n       Plaintiffs further allege:\n\n       The United States has also breached its trust obligations to the Tribe and\n       Murray’s family by failing to protect the territorial integrity of the Tribe’s\n       reservation and the Tribe’s sovereign interest in the shooting site, thus\n       allowing unauthorized persons to trespass on the Ute homeland and cause\n       harm to tribal members with complete impunity. The Defendant’s breach of\n       its trust and treaty obligations has resulted in substantial loss to the Tribe.\n       Todd Murray was a registered tribal member and a lineal descendant of Ute\n       blood. The Ute Tribe is a small tribe with less than 4,000 members.\n       Unremitting tribal membership is an integral part of the Tribe’s ability to\n       sustain its lineage and culture. The Defendant is liable in damages for such\n       loss.\n\n        In response to the amended complaint, defendant, again, filed a motion to dismiss\nboth counts pursuant to RCFC 12(b)(1) and RCFC 12(b)(6), for lack of subject matter\njurisdiction, and failure to state a claim, respectively. For count one, defendant contends\nthat the violation of the Ute Treaties should be dismissed “for lack of jurisdiction and for\nfailure to state a claim.” Defendant argues that “[p]laintiffs have not complied with the\nterms of the Treaty and have not exhausted the administrative remedies required by the\nexpress terms of the Treaty.” Defendant contends that even if the court found jurisdiction\nunder the “bad men” provision12 of the 1868 Treaty with the Utes, “plaintiffs do not state\na cognizable claim under the ‘bad men’ provision.” For count two, defendant contends\nthat, “[p]laintiffs’ breach-of-trust claims are barred by the United States’ sovereign\nimmunity because plaintiffs did not allege the violation of a specific statutory or regulatory\nmoney-mandating duty,” and that the Treaties involved “do not impose a nondiscretionary\nfiduciary duty upon the United States to prosecute alleged ‘bad men’ without exercising\nits prosecutorial discretion.”\n\n                                       DISCUSSION\n\nBackground of the Ute Treaties\n\n\n      Many of the plaintiffs’ claims center on particular provisions of two treaties\nexecuted, and ratified, in the mid-19th century. The first treaty was concluded on October\n7, 1863. See Treaty with the Utah Tabeguache Band, October 7, 1863, 13 Stat. 673\n\n12 Both defendant and plaintiffs use the phrases “bad men” provision and “bad men”\nclause, in their filings. For simplicity, unless quoting directly, the court adopts the phrase\n“bad men” provision.\n                                             13\n\f(referred to by the parties as the 1863 Treaty).13 Through the 1863 Treaty, the\nTabeguache Band of Ute Indians ceded their rights and interest to vast tracts of land in\nthe Western United States. See id. Article 1 of the 1863 Treaty states: “It is admitted by\nthe Tabeguache band of Utah Indians that they reside within the territorial limits of the\nUnited States, acknowledging their supremacy, and claim their protection. The said band\nalso admits the right of the United States to regulate all trade and intercourse with them.”\nArticle 2 of the 1863 Treaty states, in part: “Said Tabeguache band of Utah Indians hereby\ncede, convey, and relinquish all of their claim, right, title, and interest in and to any and\nall of their lands within the territory of the United States, wherever situated, excepting that\nwhich is included within the following boundaries. . . .” Id. In return: “[f]or the period of ten\nyears the said band shall receive, annually, by such distribution as the Secretary of the\nInterior may direct, ten thousand dollars' worth of goods, and also ten thousand dollars'\nworth of provisions.” Id.\n\n       Article 10 of the 1863 Treaty provides:\n\n       Each family that shall announce through its head to the agent of the band a\n       willingness and determination to begin and follow the pursuits of agriculture,\n       by farming or raising stock and growing wool, upon such lands and\n       according to such regulations as the Secretary of the Interior may prescribe,\n       shall receive the following donations of stock to aid them in their endeavor\n       to gain a livelihood by such new pursuits, viz.:\n\n       Of cattle, one head annually during five years, beginning with the ratification\n       of this treaty.\n\n       Of sheep, ten head annually during the first two years after the ratification\n       of this treaty, and five head annually during the three years thereafter.\n\n       The Secretary of the Interior may also direct that their share of annuity\n       goods and provisions shall be of a character suited to such change of life:\n       Provided, however, That such stock shall only be donated as long as such\n       family shall in good faith keep and use the same for the purpose indicated\n       in this article.\n\n       All the Indians of said band who may adopt and conform to the provisions\n       of this article shall be protected in the quiet and peaceable possession of\n       their said lands and property.\n\nId. (emphasis in original).\n\n\n\n\n13On March 25, 1864, the United States Senate advised ratification, with amendments,\nwhich were assented to by the Tribe on October 8, 1864. See 13 Stat. 673. The 1863\nTreaty was then signed by President Lincoln on December 14, 1864. See id.\n                                               14\n\f       In March of 1868, the United States concluded another treaty with the Ute. See\nTreaty with the Ute, March 2, 1868, 15 Stat. 619 (referred to by the parties as the 1868\nTreaty).14 As noted in the preamble and Article 1 of the 1868 Treaty:\n\n       Articles of a treaty and agreement made and entered into at Washington\n       City, D.C., on the second day of March, one thousand eight hundred and\n       sixty-eight, by and between Nathaniel G. Taylor, Commissioner of Indian\n       Affairs, Alexander C. Hunt, governor of Colorado Territory and ex-officio\n       superintendent of Indian affairs, and Kit Carson, duly authorized to\n       represent the United States, of the one part, and the representatives of the\n       Tabaquache[15], Muache, Capote, Weeminuche, Yampa, Grand River, and\n       Uintah bands of Ute Indians, (whose names are hereto subscribed,) duly\n       authorized and empowered to act for the body of the people of said bands,\n       of the other part, witness:\n\n       Article I. All the provisions of the treaty concluded with the Tabequache\n       band of Utah Indians, October seventh, one thousand eight hundred and\n       sixty-three, as amended by the Senate of the United States and proclaimed\n       December fourteenth, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-four, which are\n       not inconsistent with the provisions of this treaty, as hereinafter provided,\n       are hereby reaffirmed and declared to be applicable and to continue in force\n       as well to the other bands, respectively, parties to this treaty, as to the\n       Tabequache band of Utah Indians.\n\nId. Article 2 of the 1868 Treaty states, in part:\n\n       [T]he United States now solemnly agree that no persons, except those\n       herein authorized so to do, and except such officers, agents, and employes\n       [sic] of the Government as may be authorized to enter upon Indian\n       reservations in discharge of duties enjoined by law shall ever be permitted\n       to pass over, settle upon, or reside in the Territory described in this article,\n       except as herein otherwise provided.\n\nId. Art. 2. The 1868 Treaty reaffirmed and incorporated the provisions of the 1863 Treaty,\nbut also created new guarantees and promises. For example, Article 5 the 1868 Treaty\nestablished how to resolve “depredation on person or property”:\n\n       The United States agree that the agents for said Indians, in the future, shall\n       make their homes at the agency buildings; that they shall reside among the\n\n\n14On July 25, 1868, the United States Senate advised ratification, with amendments,\nwhich were assented to by the Tribe in August and September 1868. See 15 Stat. 619.\nThe 1868 Treaty was then signed by President Johnson on November 6, 1868. See id.\n15Although the 1868 Treaty uses the spelling “Tabaquache” in the preamble, all other\nspellings of the Tribe are “Tabequache.”\n                                              15\n\f        Indians, and keep an office open at all times for the purpose of prompt and\n        diligent inquiry into such matters of complaint by and against the Indians,\n        as may be presented for investigation under the provisions of their treaty\n        stipulations, as also for the faithful discharge of other duties enjoined on\n        them by law. In all cases of depredation on person or property, they shall\n        cause the evidence to be taken in writing and forwarded, together with their\n        finding, to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, whose decision, subject to\n        the revision of the Secretary of the Interior, shall be binding on the parties\n        to this treaty.\n\nId. Art. 5. Article 6 states in full:\n\n        If bad men among the whites or among other people, subject to the authority\n        of the United States, shall commit any wrong upon the person or property\n        of the Indians, the United States will, upon proof made to the agent and\n        forwarded to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs at Washington City,\n        proceed at once to cause the offender to be arrested and punished\n        according to the laws of the United States, and also reimburse the injured\n        person for the loss sustained.\n\n        If bad men among the Indians shall commit a wrong or depredation upon\n        the person or property of any one, white, black, or Indian, subject to the\n        authority of the United States and at peace therewith, the tribes herein\n        named solemnly agree that they will, on proof made to their agent and\n        notice to him, deliver up the wrongdoer to the United States, to be tried and\n        punished according to its laws, and in case they wilfully refuse so to do the\n        person injured shall be reimbursed for his loss from the annuities or other\n        moneys due or to become due to them under this or other treaties made\n        with the United States.\n\nId. Art. 6. This provision is often referred to by courts and litigants as the “bad men”\nprovision. “Bad men” provisions are common in Native American treaties of this time\nperiod, and appear to have been fairly standard in Native American treaties during the\n19th century.

Further, plaintiffs contend that “[t]he United States\nagreed to protect and reimburse the Ute Indians for all harm, injury, unjust, or unmerited\ntreatment inflicted upon any tribal member or tribal property by non-whites on the\nreservation,” but that the United States failed to honor its obligations under the 1868\nTreaty by not investigating and prosecuting the alleged wrongdoers.\n\nJurisdiction\n        Defendant argues that this court lacks jurisdiction over plaintiffs’ case because\nplaintiffs have not complied with the terms of the 1868 Ute Treaty, and further argues that\nplaintiffs have not stated a cognizable claim under the “bad men” provision.

As\nalso discussed further below, the “bad men” provision of the 1868 Ute Treaty provides a\nbasis for jurisdiction in this court.\n\n\n                                             21\n\fAdministrative Exhaustion\n\n        Defendant argues that administrative exhaustion is a “jurisdictional prerequisite” to\njudicial review. The defendant relies on language in the 1868 Ute Treaty, which reads:\n\n       In all cases of depredation on person or property, they shall cause the\n       evidence to be taken in writing and forwarded, together with their finding, to\n       the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, whose decision, subject to the revision\n       of the Secretary of the Interior, shall be binding on the parties to this [1868]\n       treaty.\n\n1868 Treaty, Art. 5. Defendant contends that this language mandates full administrative\nreview, allowing the Department of the Interior an opportunity to issue a “binding decision”\nbefore a plaintiff can seek relief from the courts. Defendant states that “throughout the six\nyears following Mr. Murray’s death, Plaintiffs have had every opportunity to present a ‘bad\nmen’ claim to the Department of the Interior (‘DOI’), as agreed upon by both the Tribe and\nthe United States. See Treaty with the Ute Indians, 15 Stat. 619 (1868). Plaintiffs have\nnot.” (internal citation omitted). According to defendant, “plaintiffs have not complied with\nthe terms of the Treaty and have not exhausted the administrative remedies required by\nthe express terms of the Treaty.” As a consequence, defendant argues,\n\n       DOI has not been provided with an opportunity to “cause the evidence to be\n       taken in writing and forwarded, together with [the government agent’s]\n       finding, to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, whose decision, subject to\n       the revision of the Secretary of the Interior, shall be binding on the parties\n       to this treaty.” Art. 5, 1868 Treaty. Having failed to exhaust their\n       administrative remedies, Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint should be\n       dismissed.\n\n(alterations in original). Defendant urges this court to dismiss plaintiffs’ claims in the\nUnited States Court of Federal Claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n\n        In response, plaintiffs argue they have satisfied the exhaustion requirements of the\ntreaty by way of their March 12, 2013 letter to Department of the Interior officials, placing\nthe Department of the Interior on notice of plaintiffs’ intention to file suit in this court.\nPlaintiffs allege that the court “has previously analyzed this specific bad men treaty clause\nand has held that the only prerequisite required before suit is filed is that a notice of claim\nmust be sent to the agency and a copy be sent to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs in\nWashington.” Moreover, plaintiffs argue that the exhaustion requirement is non-\njurisdictional, maintaining that any requirement to exhaust administrative remedies is\npurely prudential and, therefore, subject to the court’s discretion.\n\n       “The doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies is one among related\ndoctrines—including abstention, finality, and ripeness—that govern the timing of federal-\ncourt decision making.” McCarthy v.

As described by\nthe United States Supreme Court, the first, and primary, purpose is the development of a\nproper factual background:\n       A primary purpose is, of course, the avoidance of premature interruption of\n       the administrative process. The agency, like a trial court, is created for the\n       purpose of applying a statute in the first instance. Accordingly, it is normally\n       desirable to let the agency develop the necessary factual background upon\n       which decisions should be based. And since agency decisions are\n       frequently of a discretionary nature or frequently require expertise, the\n       agency should be given the first chance to exercise that discretion or to\n       apply that expertise.\nMcKart v.

Article 6 of the 1868\n       Treaty promised that any person violating the territorial integrity of the\n       Reservation and causing harm to the Tribe or its tribal members would be\n       “punished according to the laws of the United States.” In violation of these\n       treaty obligations, the United States has failed to investigate or to prosecute\n       the individuals involved in the shooting death of 21 year-old Todd Murray in\n       April 2007, and the subsequent conspiracy to suppress, alter, and destroy\n       critical evidence.\n\n       Please feel free to contact our office should you require any additional\n       information regarding this forthcoming claim.\n\n\n       Sincerely,\n\n       Sandra L. Denton\n\n(footnote omitted). As noted above, the March 12, 2013 letter attached almost four\nhundred pages of exhibits, including filings in the District Court such as the plaintiffs’ third\namended complaint, plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment, and plaintiffs’ motion for\ntampering and destruction of critical evidence.\n\n       In Elk v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">70</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Fed. Cl.</span> <span class=\"page\">405</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2006), the United States Court of Federal\nClaims addressed a similar issue of exhaustion as is raised by defendants in the current\ncase under review by this court, albeit under a different treaty, and found no jurisdictional\nrequirement to exhaust administrative remedies. In Elk v. United States, a member of the\nOglala Sioux Tribe brought suit after she was sexually assaulted by a United States Army\nrecruiter in a remote area of the reservation. See id. at 406. The “bad men” provision of\nthe 1868 Sioux treaty, served as the legal basis for the plaintiff’s complaint. As in the\npresent action, the Elk plaintiff claimed to have been “wronged” by “bad men” and sought\nreimbursement from the United States. Id. at 405. The government in Elk moved to\ndismiss plaintiff’s claim, arguing that the treaty required “proof” to be “made to the agent\nand forwarded to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs at Washington City,” and that this,\nas a textual matter, plainly suggested a jurisdictional requirement to exhaust\nadministrative remedies. See id. While recognizing the requirements that the language\nimposed, the court ultimately held that the plaintiff did not have to await a formal\n\n                                              26\n\fadministrative decision from the agency before bringing suit. See id. at 407. After careful\nreview of the relevant provisions of the 1868 Sioux treaty, the Elk court held that formal\nadministrative exhaustion was not a prerequisite to bringing suit, concluding that “nothing\nin the Sioux Treaty indicates that a claimant must await a decision from Interior before\nfiling suit.” Id. The Elk court determined that “under well established principles, a statute\nor other Congressional enactment creates an independent duty to exhaust only when it\ncontains ‘sweeping and direct’ statutory language indicating that there is no federal\njurisdiction prior to exhaustion, or the exhaustion requirement is treated as an element of\nthe underlying claim.” Id. Because the 1868 Sioux Treaty at issue contained no such\nlanguage, the Elk court declined to require exhaustion as a prerequisite to judicial\njurisdiction.18\n\n       A predecessor court to the Court of Federal Claims previously found, under the\nspecific facts of the case, that exhaustion of administrative remedies was a jurisdictional\nrequirement when specific treaty language both (1) unmistakably mandates\nadministrative review by an executive agency and (2) sets forth a procedure for so doing.\nSee Begay v.

The “bad men” provision of the\n\n\n18 The court notes that defendant in the above captioned case, like the defendant in Elk,\ncites to the unpublished opinion in Zephier v. United States, No. 03-768L (Fed. Cl. Oct.\n29, 2004). The Elk court wrote as follows:\n\n       The other case cited by defendant, the unpublished opinion in Zephier, et\n       al. v. United States, No. 03–768L (Fed. Cl. Oct. 29, 2004), concerned a\n       situation in which the plaintiff did not file a claim with Interior under the Sioux\n       Treaty before filing suit. This court dismissed the complaint for lack of\n       jurisdiction, finding that “the courts either have found that the plain language\n       of the treaties mandates exhaustion of administrative remedies or have\n       accepted without question that such remedies are available.” Id. at 13. But,\n       with all due respect, the latter statement does not flow from the analysis that\n       precedes it, which, inter alia, overlooks several key distinctions. For\n       example, while the court noted the significant differences between the\n       Navajo and Sioux treaties, id. at 12 n.4, it freely cited cases involving the\n       former as precedent for construing the latter—a non sequitur. And while it\n       suggested that Begay II is not precedential, id. at 11, but rather only\n       persuasive, id. at 11 n.3, it, nonetheless, proceeded to apply that case as if\n       it had resolved definitively the precise issue before the court, doing so\n       largely without further independent analysis of the exhaustion issue.\n\nElk v. United States, 70 Fed. Cl. at 411. Therefore, the Elk court determined, “[a]t best,\nthen, Zephier is inapposite; at all events, its analysis is unpersuasive. Id.\n                                               27\n\fNavajo Treaty of 1868, served as the legal basis for the plaintiffs’ complaint. After careful\nreview of the treaty’s provisions, the court suspended litigation and granted the\nDepartment of Interior a period of ninety days to issue a decision on the matter. Id. at\n602-03. In making this determination, the court relied on a passage in the Navajo Treaty\nof 1868, which provided:\n\n         [T]he President may prescribe such rules and regulations for ascertaining\n         damages under this article as in his judgment may be proper; but no such\n         damage shall be adjusted and paid until examined and passed upon by the\n         Commissioner of Indian Affairs.\n\nTreaty with the Navajo, June 1, 1868, 15 Stat. 667, Art. 1.\n\n        The Begay court found this provision to be particularly dispositive. In light of the\nclear and unambiguous language, which withheld damages until “examined and passed\nupon” by the agency, the court found the requirement of exhaustion to be jurisdictional,\nand, therefore, the Begay court declined to assert jurisdiction over a “bad men” claim “in\nview of the specific references in [the treaty] to administrative consideration . . . .” Begay\nv. United States, 219 Ct. Cl. at 602. Likewise, in Tsosie v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cl. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">62</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\nthe court in reviewing the “bad men” provision of the Navajo Treaty of 1868 concluded\nthat “there must first be an administrative decision by the Department of the Interior,”\nbefore submitting a claim to the judiciary. Id. at 75 (citing Begay v. United States, 219 Ct.\nCl. at 602).\n\n        When comparing the Sioux and the Navajo Treaties side by side, the treaties differ\nwith respect to an exhaustion requirement, as reflected in the decisions discussed above.\nCompare Elk v. United States, 70 Fed. Cl. at 407, with Begay v. United States, 219 Ct.\nCl. at 602, and, Tsosie v. United States, 11 Cl. Ct. at 75. The court in Elk addressed the\ndifferences, ultimately concluding that the Navajo Treaty is unique in precluding the\npayment of damages until the claim is “thoroughly examined and passed upon” by the\nagency. See Elk v. United States, 70 Fed. Cl. at 407.19 The Sioux Treaty contains no such\nlimitation. Id. Furthermore, the court in Elk observed that the Sioux Treaty “neither\nspecifies the particulars of the proof that should be supplied [to the agency] nor indicates\nthat the claimant must wait any particular time for an agency to respond to her claim.” Id.\n\n\n\n\n19   The court notes that the Elk court observed that:\n\n         [T]he court in Begay I, denied its motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' complaint\n         and retained jurisdiction while ordering the Assistant Secretary of Interior to\n         render an opinion within 90 days. Id. at 603. The Begay orders thus hardly\n         stands [sic] for the proposition that a claimant must obtain an actual decision\n         from Interior before bringing suit under the Tucker Act.\n\nElk v. United States, 70 Fed. Cl. at 411 (emphasis in original).\n                                               28\n\f        The language of the 1868 Ute Treaty more closely resembles the language of the\nSioux Treaty than the Navajo Treaty. The Ute Treaty also contains no “sweeping and\ndirect language,” requiring administrative exhaustion. Unlike the Navajo Treaty, the Ute\nTreaty does not withhold damages until “passed upon” by the Department of the Interior.\nSee Elk v. United States, 70 Fed. Cl. at 407. Nor does the Ute Treaty specify the manner\nand means for bringing a claim in court. Article 5 of the Ute Treaty states only:\n\n       In all cases of depredation on person or property, they shall cause the\n       evidence to be taken in writing and forwarded, together with their finding, to\n       the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, whose decision, subject to the revision\n       of the Secretary of the Interior, shall be binding on the parties to this treaty.\n\nAs noted above, although the 1868 Ute Treaty requires evidence of any depredation or\nwrong “to be taken in writing and forwarded together with their finding to the\nCommissioner of Indian Affairs,” 1868 Treaty, Art. 5, forwarding such evidence is the “only\nprerequisite to suit required by the treaty.” Hebah v.

Plaintiffs have been litigating\nfor years in an effort to get their day in court and they would be unduly prejudiced by an\nadministrative decision that could take years and might get them no closer to a remedy\nthan where they are today.” Plaintiffs also allege that “it is questionable whether the\nDepartment of the Interior can adequately grant effective relief in this case in light of the\ncomplex and multiple constitutional issues that are play in the case.” (internal citation\nomitted).\n        Defendant responds that “Plaintiffs’ extensive litigation in the district court of Utah,\nwhere Plaintiffs fully, fairly, and forcefully presented their case, further ameliorates any\nconcern that additional time spent adjudicating this matter before DOI may prejudice\nPlaintiffs. Indeed, Plaintiffs have not explained what they would present here that they\nhave not already presented to that court.” Defendant also claims that the plaintiffs’\nargument that this case is complex and has multiple constitutional issues “does not\nsquare with their request for relief that is far more straightforward than the premise of their\nargument suggests: They seek monetary damages pursuant to the ‘bad men’ clause of\nthe 1868 Treaty.” The court agrees with defendant that plaintiffs’ claims in this court do\nnot involve “complex and multiple constitutional issues.” There is no certainty as to how\nlong the Department of the Interior might take in responding to plaintiffs’ claims. Plaintiffs’\nlengthy litigation history, however, does not mean a further delay at the Department of\nthe Interior would not have a negative impact on plaintiffs. Plaintiffs’ exhaustion\n\n                                              32\n\frequirements may well have been met under the 1868 Treaty by virtue of the March 12,\n2013 letter. Even, however, for the sake of argument, if the exhaustion requirements were\nnot met, because the facts of the case stem from the April 1, 2007 death of Mr. Murray,\nand because the previous litigation has continued since 2009, the court concludes that a\nrequirement to force plaintiffs now to exhaust administrative remedies at the Department\nof the Interior presents a further unreasonable or “indefinite timeframe for administrative\naction.” Therefore, this court concludes that, on one or both grounds, the exhaustion\ndoctrine does not preclude this court from taking jurisdiction over plaintiffs’ claims.\n“Bad Men” Provision\n\n       Defendant argues in its motion to dismiss that “Plaintiffs’ do not state a cognizable\nclaim under the ‘bad men’ provision.” Plaintiffs allege in their complaint that “Todd Murray,\nTodd Murray’s family, and the Ute Indian Tribe suffered ‘injuries’ at the hands of ‘bad\nmen’ as those terms are used in the Ute Treaties of 1863 and 1868.” As indicated above,\nthe “bad men” provision at issue in the 1868 Treaty provides:\n\n       If bad men among the whites, or among other people subject to the authority\n       of the United States, shall commit any wrong upon the person or property\n       of the Indian, the United States will, upon proof made to the agent and\n       forwarded to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs at Washington City,\n       proceed at once to cause the offender to be arrested and punished\n       according to the laws of the United States, and also reimburse the injured\n       person for the loss sustained.\n\n1868 Treaty, Art. 6. Defendant contends that many of plaintiffs’ alleged wrongs are not\ncontemplated by the terms of the treaty and, therefore, plaintiffs fail to state a claim with\nrespect to the “bad men” provision.\n\n        In examining what must be pled in order to state a claim, under both RCFC 8(a)(2)\nand Rule (8)(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a plaintiff need only state in\nthe complaint “a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled\nto relief.” RCFC 8(a)(2); Fed.

Id. at 737. The court explained that\nthe “plaintiff ha[d] not alleged sufficient facts stating who the ‘bad men’ are.” Id. In light of\nthis and other deficiencies, the Garreaux court granted the defendant’s motion to dismiss.\nSee id.\n\n        In specifically naming the allegedly responsible parties, plaintiffs pass the first\nhurdle.

Plaintiffs allege a host of\ninjuries, encompassing both actions and omissions, as follows:\n\n       By their actions and inactions, the FBI and BIA officers committed wrongs\n       to Todd Murray, the Murray family and the Ute Tribe (i) by acting in concert\n       with state/county/municipal officers, expressly or impliedly, in concocting, or\n\n\n21 The Federal Circuit in Richard noted that the Fort Laramie Treaty “‘is one of nine made\nin 1868. . . .

As identified in Elk, the Choctaw treaty “contained a host of other\nprovisions like those found in the 1867–68 Indian Peace Commission treaties, including\nthe Fort Laramie treaty with the Sioux. Indeed, all of the latter treaties [including the Ute\n1868 Treaty] contain ‘bad men’ clauses identical to that in the Sioux Treaty.” Elk v. United\nStates, 87 Fed. Cl. at 80-81.\n22As noted in the District Court litigation, the Utah officials include: Vernal City Police\nOfficer Vance Norton, Vernal City, Vernal City Police Department, the Utah Highway\nPatrol, the State of Utah, Blackburn Mortuary, Uintah County, State Troopers Dave\nSwenson, Craig Young, Rex Olsen, and Jeff Chugg, Uintah County Sherriff’s Sergeant\nBevan Watkins and Deputy Troy Slaugh, and Utah Division Wildlife Officer Sean Davis.\n                                               36\n\f       permitting to be concocted, a false story that Todd Murray shot himself in\n       the back of his head, execution style, above and behind his left ear; (ii) by\n       failing to take custody of Murray’s body and to secure the body against\n       desecration and spoliation of evidence; [sic] (iv) by participating in, tacitly\n       allowing, or failing to prevent, the desecration of Murray’s body and the\n       spoliation of critical evidence both at the shooting scene and afterwards at\n       the Medical Center, Blackburn Mortuary, and at the Utah OME; (v) the\n       failure to insure that a proper autopsy was performed on Murray’s body; (vi)\n       by failing to conduct any kind of investigation into Todd Murray’s murder;\n       and (vii) by failing to protect the territorial integrity of the Tribe’s reservation\n       boundary and the Tribe’s sovereign interests in the crime scene where\n       Murray was shot.\n\n         Defendant argues that “[t]he Bad men clause is limited to affirmative criminal acts.”\nIn Hebah II, the Court of Claims construed “wrong” according to its common or plain\nmeaning. See Hebah II, 456 F.2d at 704, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">197</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ct. Cl.</span> <span class=\"page\">729</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. In Hebah II, the Court of Claims\naddressed the death by shooting of plaintiff's husband by tribal policeman Norman Moss.\nId. at 699.23 With the help of a dictionary, the court defined a wrong as “[a]ction or conduct\nwhich inflicts harm without due provocation or just cause; serious injury wantonly inflicted\nor undeservedly sustained; unjust or unmerited treatment.” Id. Plaintiffs in the above\ncaptioned case argue that this definition is particularly broad and encompasses omissions\nof the sort alleged in the amended complaint. The court notes, however, that defendant\nin Hebah II argued that “the plain language of the Treaty of 1868 requires that no\nreimbursement be made to one who sustains a loss while violating the laws of the United\nStates, and that deceased was violating the laws of the United States when he suffered\nhis ‘loss.’” Id. at 705. Defendant in Hebah II also argued that the shooting officer\n“committed no wrong upon deceased because the arrest attempt was lawfully made and,\nunder the circumstances, the shooting of deceased was justified,” and the court agreed\nthat it “was regrettable but reasonable for Moss to shoot to kill decedent. Having\ndetermined that the killing of deceased was reasonable under the circumstances herein,\nit follows that the killing was with reason or just cause. Therefore, Moss did not commit a\n“wrong” within the meaning of the Treaty of 1868 [between the United States and the\nEastern Band of Shoshonees and the Bannack Tribe of Indians].” Id. at 705, 710.\n\n       In Garreaux v. United States, 77 Fed. Cl. at 736, however, the United States Court\nof Federal Claims narrowed its understanding of the term, “wrong.” The court observed a\nlong line of precedent in which bad men claims were “rooted” in behavior that was\n\n\n23The Court of Claims further explained, the “Decedent returned to Apartment 18 at Tigee\nVillage about midnight on March 13, 1968. He was drunk, angry and carrying a one pint\nbottle and a one-half pint bottle of whisky,” and “[s]hortly after going to bed, Mr. Hebah\nstarted to choke Mrs. Hebah,” who eventually fled to a neighbor’s house who called Wind\nRiver Reservation police station. Hebbah II, 456 F.2d at 699. “Mrs. Hebah explained to\nOfficer Moss that her husband was drunk, armed with a rifle, had plenty of ammunition,\nthat he had chased her brother and son out of the apartment, that he had threatened her\nwith bodily harm, and that she and her daughter had fled from the apartment.” Id. at 700.\n                                               37\n\f“criminal in nature.” Id. The Garreaux court emphasized its unwillingness to “stretch the\nbounds of the ‘bad men’ provision to encompass not a criminal claim, but a claim for\nnegligence,” and noted that the “primary intent” of the provision was to “guard against\naffirmative criminal acts.” Id. Furthermore, the court in Garreaux observed that the\npunishment for inflicting a “wrong” is arrest and prosecution. See id. at 734.\n\n        In Hernandez v. United States, 93 Fed. Cl. at 199, this court again adopted a\nnarrow interpretation of the term “wrong,” resolving the ambiguity in light of the treaty’s\noverall purpose. In Hernandez, a tribal prisoner at the Tecumseh State Correctional\nFacility in Nebraska brought suit, claiming, inter alia, that the United States violated the\nguarantees of the bad men provision by “fail[ing] to arrest suspected ‘wrongdoers’” Id. at\n198. The Hernandez court observed that the provision, typically, is only applied to\naffirmative criminal acts and not omissions. Ultimately, the court rested its determination\non the “primary intent” of the “bad men” clause, which “was to keep the peace between\nNative Americans and non-Native Americans.” Id. “[A]s such, the Fort Laramie Treaty has\nbeen applied to affirmative criminal acts and not mere acts of negligence.” Id. Because\narresting and criminally prosecuting individuals for civil wrongs does not logically follow,\n“wrongs,” as defined by the 1868 Treaty, are only allegations of criminal wrongs. A more\nexpansive interpretation would render the remedy provided for inappropriate. Thus, in\norder for the provision to maintain its coherence, the court concludes that “wrongs” is\nlimited to criminal wrongs. In sum, the 1868 Treaty language and the relevant case law\nsupports a narrow understanding of what constitutes a “wrong,” one that encompasses\nonly affirmative criminal acts.\n\n       Applying an affirmative acts test, most of the plaintiffs’ alleged wrongs fail to state\na cognizable claim under the “bad men” provision of a treaty. While, as plaintiffs note, it\nis doubtless true that “a person can be wronged by the inaction of another,” inaction is\nnot a recognized harm under the 1868 Treaty. Since allegations (ii), (v), (vi), and (vii)\nallege only omissions, they do not qualify as “wrongs” for purposes of a “bad men” claim\nunder the provision of the 1868 Treaty. Accordingly, allegations (ii), (v), (vi), and (vii),\ntherefore, are dismissed for failure to state a claim.\n\n        Nevertheless, accepting plaintiffs’ allegations as true, allegations (i) and (iv) qualify\nas potential, cognizable “wrongs” under the 1868 Treaty. In fact, in Hebah II the court\nexplicitly recognized that “the killing of an Indian without just cause or reason would be a\nwrong within the meaning of the Treaty of 1868.” Hebah II, 456 F.2d at 704, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">197</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ct. Cl.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">729</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Therefore, because plaintiffs allege that the FBI and BIA, “by acting in concert with\nstate/county/municipal officers, expressly or impliedly, in concocting, or permitting to be\nconcocted, a false story that Todd Murray shot himself in the back of his head, execution\nstyle, above and behind his left ear,” and “by participating in, tacitly allowing, or failing to\nprevent, the desecration of Murray’s body and the spoliation of critical evidence both at\nthe shooting scene and afterwards at the Medical Center, Blackburn Mortuary, and at the\nUtah OME,” the court denies the defendant’s motion to dismiss as to allegations (i) and\n(iv) of the amended complaint. The court also notes, however, that defendant is correct\nthat the “bad men” provision “does not include, as plaintiffs, suggest the universe of off-\nreservation activities that would have occurred ‘but for’ the initial conduct on the\n\n                                               38\n\freservation.” Therefore, to the extent allegation (iv), which includes “the desecration of\nMurray’s body and the spoliation of critical evidence both at the shooting scene and\nafterwards at the Medical Center, Blackburn Mortuary, and at the Utah OME,” includes\nthe desecration of Mr. Murray’s body and spoliation of critical evidence that did not take\nplace on the reservation, but at the medical center and mortuary, those allegations are\nnot covered by the “bad men” provision of the 1868 Treaty. For example, as explained in\nthe District Court’s spoliation order, ”[a]fter the completion of the federal criminal matter\ninvolving the [Mr. Murray’s] firearm, the judge hearing the case signed, on November 14,\n2008, an order forfeiting the firearm to the government. Shortly thereafter, the firearm was\ndestroyed. Agent Ryan did not notify any of the Defendants that the firearm would be\ndestroyed.” Jones et al. v. Norton et al., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2014</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">909569</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *4 (footnote omitted).\nTherefore, the destruction of Mr. Murray’s weapon did not take place not on Tribal lands.\n\n        Although the court recognizes allegations (i) and (iv) qualify as potential cognizable\nwrongs under the 1868 Treaty, implicit in Hebah II, is the conclusion that, as defendant\nargues, “actions permissibly taken by law enforcement officers are not ‘wrong’ and cannot\nsupport a finding of liability under the ‘bad men’ provision.”24 See Hebah II, 456 F.2d at\n708, 710, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">197</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ct.

As noted above, the record does not reflect any criminal\nprosecutions of Special Agent Rex Ashdown and David Ryan of the FBI or the various\nofficials present from the BIA, suggesting that the decision not to prosecute indicates the\nactions taken by the federal officers were considered permissible by the appropriate\nauthorities. The court, however, cannot infer from the absence of prosecutions that all the\nFBI and BIA actions were taken permissibly. Therefore, the court addresses allegations\n(i) and (iv) of the amended complaint.\n\nIssue Preclusion\n\n        Accepting the plaintiffs’ factual allegations as true and that parts of allegations (i)\nand (iv) in plaintiffs’ complaint qualify as potentially cognizable “wrongs,” defendant,\nnevertheless, argues that “[t]he doctrine of issue preclusion prevents the re-litigation of\nPlaintiffs’ only cognizable claim for relief under the Bad Men clause.” Defendant argues:\n\n       The district court of Utah entered an order in Plaintiffs’ lawsuit against the\n       state law enforcement officers and mortuary that rejects with finality the\n       keystone of Plaintiffs’ argument that they constructed over the course of five\n       years of litigation: that the state defendants allegedly trespassed on tribal\n       lands, executed Mr. Murray, and subsequently engaged in a conspiracy to\n       thwart any investigation into his murder.\n\nTherefore, defendant contends that “[p]laintiffs’ lawsuit in the Court of Federal Claims\ndoes not provide them with an additional opportunity to litigate the ultimate facts of this\n\n\n24Defendant further argues that “[t]he text and history of the treaty also indicates that the\nUnited States and the tribe were primarily concerned with criminal acts that injured either\nthe individual tribal members or their property, such as robbery, assault, and murder,”\nand, therefore, not claims of conspiracy to destroy evidence.\n                                              39\n\fcentral thesis that the Utah district court concluded was without merit.” (internal citation\nomitted). “This is no less true,” defendant argues, “even though Plaintiffs’ appeal to the\nTenth Circuit remains pending.” Defendant argues there is no question that “the issues\ncurrently at stake are identical, were actually litigated in the Utah district court, and that\nPlaintiffs had a full and fair opportunity to litigate those issues. That Plaintiffs’ bring\ndifferent claims is immaterial. The fundamental point of contention—Mr. Murray’s cause\nof death—has been resolved.” In response, plaintiffs argue that “[i]ssue\npreclusion/collateral estoppel does not apply to Plaintiffs’ action in the Court of Claims\nbecause Plaintiffs have challenged the district court’s purely legal rulings on appeal.\nAccordingly, not only does [sic] the Utah district court’s rulings lack finality, but, more\nimportantly, the Plaintiffs have not been afforded a full and fair opportunity in which to\nconclusively litigate their claims in Norton.”\n\n         The rule of issue preclusion precludes a party from re-litigating an issue that was\n“litigated and resolved in a valid court determination essential to the prior judgment.” New\nHampshire v.

And the matter of spoliation was intensely litigated over the course of five\nyears in the district court of Utah, with extensive discovery, briefing, and an evidentiary\nhearing.” Defendant also argues, “[t]hat Plaintiffs disagree with Judge Campbell’s\nconclusion is clear. But this lawsuit provides them with no occasion to rely on the same\nevidence or introduce new evidence in an attempt to reach a different result.”\n                                              42\n\fthe present suit and the one litigated in the United States District Court for the District of\nUtah. Plaintiffs also claim that the issues before the District Court related to allegations of\nillegal seizure, excessive force, and conspiracy, whereas the issue before this court\ninvolve the breach of federal treaties, the “wrongs” of various law enforcement officials\nand trust obligations. Defendant argues that the “issues currently at stake are identical,”\nand the “identity of issues in both cases is similarly made apparent in the Utah district\ncourt’s rejection of Plaintiffs’ conspiracy theory, that is, that the individuals involved in that\nday’s events engaged in a conspiracy to cover up Mr. Murray’s ‘execution.’” Defendant\nstates “[i]ndeed, Plaintiffs’ suggestion that this Court ‘review the same evidence and come\nto a different conclusion,’ highlights the very necessity of issue preclusion: to prevent\nneedless relitigation and bring about some finality to litigation.” (internal citation omitted).\nDefendant also points to plaintiffs’ response to the motion to dismiss to support their point:\n\n       The difference between the original Complaint and the proposed First\n       Amended Complaint is that the Amended Complaint makes explicit what is\n       only implicit in the original Complaint. The Utah state, county, and municipal\n       officers committed a wrong by pursuing Murray at gunpoint without\n       jurisdiction and without probable cause, by shooting Murray execution-style,\n       and by then conspiring to cover-up the execution-style shooting and to\n       obstruct justice.\n\n(emphasis in original).\n\n        On March 7, 2014 the District Court of Utah granted the defendant’s motion for\nsummary judgment, and denied plaintiffs’ cross motion.

Supp. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1170</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. On April 1, 2014, plaintiffs appealed the District Court’s\ndecision to the United State Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. See Jones et al. v.\nNorton et al., No. 14-4040 (10th Cir. appeal docketed Apr. 1, 2014).28 The District Court\nin Norton concluded that “[t]he evidence clearly shows that Mr. Murray shot himself.” Id.\nat 1190. This conclusion comes up in several contexts in the Distrct Court case, including\nwhether Mr. Murray was “seized” for Fourth Amendment purposes by the defendants.\nPlaintiffs in the District Court action argued Mr. Murray was seized, and further claimed\nthat Detective Norton shot Mr. Murray execution style. The District Court, however,\ndetermined:\n\n       the Plaintiffs’ evidence is sparse, circumstantial, subject to more than one\n       interpretation, and, at times, very speculative. Moreover, evidence to the\n       contrary is strong and is consistent with a self-inflicted gunshot wound.\n       Deputy Byron testified that he did not see Detective Norton next to Mr.\n       Murray when Mr. Murray dropped to the ground. Detective Norton testified\n       that he was up on a hill when he saw Mr. Murray shoot himself.\n\n\n28As noted above, on November 18, 2014, plaintiffs filed another appeal to the United\nState Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, appealing the amended judgment entered\nby the District Court. See Jones et al. v. Norton et al., No. 14-4144 (filed 10th Cir. Nov.\n18, 2014).\n                                               43\n\f       The Deputy Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Edward Leis, who conducted the\n       physical examination of Mr. Murray's body, concluded in his report that the\n       wound was caused by a gun shot “in close proximity to the skin surface\n       when it was discharged.” He based his conclusion on “abundant soot at the\n       inferior margin of the defect [the wound] and some marginal abrasion is also\n       noted at the inferior margin.” In his testimony, he elaborated on his\n       conclusion that the gun was in contact with Mr. Murray’s head when it was\n       fired:\n\n              At the perimeter, there are several triangular shaped tears of\n              the wound. That's a result of the gun being pressed up against\n              the skin surface when it's discharged and gases causing the\n              scalp to be separated from the underlying skull. When the\n              scalp lifts up, it stretches and it tears and gets its characteristic\n              stellae appearance.\n\n       The smaller wound on the right side of Mr. Murray’s head was, in Dr. Leis’\n       opinion, the exit wound. After Dr. Leis certified that Mr. Murray’s death was\n       a suicide resulting from a gunshot wound to the head, he added an\n       additional cause of death (based on results from testing of Mr. Murray’s\n       bodily fluids). Because the tests showed the presence of drugs and alcohol\n       in Mr. Murray's system, Dr. Leis issued an amended death certificate which\n       added “Acute alcohol intoxication; recent methamphetamine use” as\n       contributing to Mr. Murray’s death.\n\n       Detective Norton was more than 100 yards away when Mr. Murray was\n       shot. Dr. Leis testified that there was no evidence that the wound could have\n       been caused by a shot coming from that far away. Plaintiffs maintain that\n       Detective Norton was not 100 yards away, but was right next to Mr. Murray\n       and so he had the capability of inflicting the contact wound. But the actual\n       evidence in the record (that is, testimony by Detective Norton and Deputy\n       Byron) shows that Detective Norton was not right next to Mr. Murray when\n       the fatal shot was fired.\n\nId. at 1190-91 (footnotes omitted). Therefore, the District Court concluded that “[a]ll of the\ndirect evidence presented by the Defendants, including Dr. Leis’ testimony and report,\nsupports the conclusion that Mr. Murray shot himself. Plaintiffs offer no more than\nspeculation and no reasonable jury could find that Detective Norton shot Mr. Murray in\nthe head at point-blank range.” The District Court also determined that Mr. Murray’s death\nwas a suicide. See id. at 1191. The District Court stated, “[b]ased on the facts as detailed\nand explained in its spoliation order, the court concludes that no reasonable jury could\nconclude that Defendants conspired to ‘effectively eliminate[ ] all probative evidence’ and\n‘clean the closet of evidence that would have allowed Plaintiffs to build their case.’” Id. at\n1204 (quoting various plaintiffs’ briefs; omissions in original; footnote omitted).\n\n\n\n                                               44\n\f        Addressing plaintiffs’ conspiracy theory, the District Court indicated, “[s]ummed up,\nPlaintiffs’ argument is that Defendants engaged in ‘[a] conspiracy to cover up a killing.’\nPlaintiffs’ theory is that Detective Norton shot and killed Mr. Murray, and that the rest of\nthe Defendants conspired to cover-up that killing and protect Detective Norton.” Id. at\n1197 (footnotes omitted). Explaining the conspiracy, the court noted that, “[t]he focus of\nthe Plaintiffs’ conspiracy theory is the failure to give aid and their spoliation argument\nabout the destruction of evidence.” Id. at 1202. Turning to plaintiffs’ claims of the\ndefendants’ failure to give medical aid to Mr. Murray, and the defendants’ “interference\nwith Mr. Murray's due process right of access to courts via the failure to preserve critical\nevidence and the affirmative destruction of critical evidence,” the District Court\ndetermined “[n]one of that testimony could allow a reasonable jury to conclude that\nIndividual Defendants were deliberately indifferent to Mr. Murray’s situation, or that they\nknew that there was a substantial risk of significant harm to Mr. Murray if they did not\nprovide first aid. If anything, the evidence shows that at least three of the Individual\nDefendants (Young, Davis, and Slaugh) were concerned that attempts to provide any kind\nof aid to Mr. Murray would do more harm than good.” Id. at 1210. The court determined,\n“[i]n sum, there is no evidence before the court to support a finding that the inaction by\neach individual defendant was part of a conspiracy to let Mr. Murray die.” Id. at 1203.\n\n        The thoroughness of the District Court’s findings and decision, after years of\ndiscovery and multiple briefings, demonstrates a comprehensive review of the\ncircumstances of the death of Mr. Murray and the actions of the officials in the aftermath\nof his death. Nonetheless plaintiffs claim that:\n\n       The district court’s statements and rulings concerning the manner of\n       Murray’s death, the desecration of Murray’s body, the sufficiency of\n       evidence showing a conspiracy, the extra-jurisdictional pursuit of Murray,\n       and the handcuffing of Murray are not preclusive in this action because the\n       issues to be litigated here—whether the actions and omissions of the Utah\n       and federal law enforcement officers violated the 1863 and 1868 Ute\n       Treaties—are not identical to the issues adjudicated by the district court in\n       that court’s dispositive rulings.\n\n         The court agrees with defendant that the issues identified in the amended\ncomplaint filed in this court, namely the allegations that officials committed “a wrong by\npursuing Murray at gunpoint without jurisdiction and without probable cause, by shooting\nMurray execution-style, and by then conspiring to cover-up the execution-style shooting\nand to obstruct justice,” presents identical issues with those decided in the District Court\nlitigation.\n\n        Regarding the second element of the collateral estoppel test, whether the prior\naction has been finally adjudicated on the merits, defendant contends that the District\nCourt’s “order on summary judgment is final for purposes of issue preclusion, even though\nPlaintiffs’ appeal remains pending.” In response, plaintiffs declare that the decisions by\nthe District Court “have not been conclusively adjudicated on the merits because those\nrulings are being challenged on appeal and are currently pending de novo review by the\n\n                                             45\n\fTenth Circuit.” (emphasis in original).

Supp. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1170</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, was issued after years of discovery and more than four and a half\nyears after the case was removed to Federal Court. The District Court judge issued a\nspoliation order and a 71 page decision granting the defendant’s motion for summary\njudgment, which fully reviewed the factual circumstances and legal issues raised in the\ncase.\n\n        Plaintiffs also allege that “to be considered adjudicated on the merits, the previous\nissues adjudicated must have been necessary to the judgment.” As determined when\nconsidering the first element of collateral estoppel, all of the issues defendant raises as\nbearing on estoppel were necessary to the District Court’s decision to grant summary\njudgment to the defendant. The District Court carefully considered the allegations of\nmurder, as well as the spoliation claims in determining that there were no constitutional\nviolations by the officials. Each were a necessary element of the summary judgment\ndecision. Therefore, for purposes of collateral estoppel, the careful and thorough\nsummary judgment decision issued by the District of Utah should be considered a final\njudgment on the issue adjudicated on its merits by this court.30\n\n       Regarding the third element of the collateral estoppel test, whether the party\nagainst whom the doctrine is invoked was a party or was in privity with a party to the prior\nadjudication, “Plaintiffs acknowledge that the third requirement for collateral estoppel is\n\n\n\n29 The Federal Circuit has interpreted this to mean decisions that are “adequately\ndeliberated” in which the “parties were fully heard in the prior proceeding.” Dana v.

As noted above, plaintiffs originally filed their case in\nNorton with the Uintah County Court on July 17, 2009, and then the case was removed\nto the United States District Court for the District of Utah on August 20, 2009. The District\nCourt, more than four and a half years after the removal to federal court, after issuing a\nspoliation order, issued a 71 page decision, granting the defendant’s motion for summary\n\n\n31The Court notes that the Ute Tribe was not a party to the District Court action. No one,\nhowever, has suggested to the court that the plaintiffs are in privity with the Tribe.\nMoreover, the court notes that the Ute Tribe, independent of the other plaintiffs, cannot\nsustain a claim under the “bad men” provision of the 1868 Treaty. Article 6 of the Treaty\nstates:\n\n       If bad men among the whites or among other people, subject to the authority\n       of the United States, shall commit any wrong upon the person or property\n       of the Indians, the United States will, upon proof made to the agent and\n       forwarded to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs at Washington City,\n       proceed at once to cause the offender to be arrested and punished\n       according to the laws of the United States, and also reimburse the injured\n       person for the loss sustained.\n\nId. Art. 6 (emphasis added). The Tribe is not an “injured person,” Mr. Murray was the\ninjured person, and his parents brought suit on his behalf. See Hernandez v. United\nStates, 93 Fed. Cl. at 200 (“In order to bring action under the Fort Laramie Treaty a Native\nAmerican must be a victim of an affirmative criminal act, and the person committing the\nact must be a specific white man or men.”) (emphasis added). The Tribe alone cannot\nprosecute a claim under the “bad men” provision of the 1868 Treaty.\n                                              47\n\fjudgment. As noted by defendant, in the District Court litigation, “Plaintiffs’ expert report\nsummarize[ed] the nearly 1,000 pages of documents then available, including an\nextensive list of depositions.” Although plaintiffs argue they “have not yet been heard on\nappeal,” this court determines that plaintiffs have not demonstrated a proper reason to\nprevent preclusion following the District Court’s final judgment. Nor, in the court’s view,\ndoes the existence of an appeal speak to the plaintiffs’ ability to have had a full and fair\nopportunity to litigate the facts of what occurred before the federal District Court, which it\nappears plaintiffs have been afforded.\n\n        Regarding the argument that plaintiffs “were deprived of crucial evidence in Norton\ndue to the mass spoliation of critical evidence that occurred,” defendant argues that “[a]s\nan initial matter, their argument goes to the underlying investigation, not the district court\nproceeding. The matter of spoliation was intensely litigated over the course of five years\nin the district court of Utah, with extensive discovery, briefing, and an evidentiary hearing.”\nThe District Court determined, “[b]ased on the facts as detailed and explained in its\nspoliation order, the court concludes that no reasonable jury could conclude that\nDefendants conspired to ‘effectively eliminate[ ] all probative evidence’ and ‘clean the\ncloset of evidence that would have allowed Plaintiffs to build their case.’” Jones et al. v.\nNorton et al., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The District\nCourt concluded that there was no failure on the part of the defendants to preserve\nevidence. Plaintiffs appear to be arguing that the District Court’s decision was wrong and\nthat demonstrates plaintiffs did not have a full and fair opportunity to litigate. As discussed\nabove, the District Court’s decision was thorough and comprehensive. Plaintiffs had a fair\nand full opportunity to litigate the spoliation issues.32\n\n       As all four elements of the collateral estoppel test have been met, plaintiffs are\nestopped from litigating the factual circumstances of Todd Murray’s death, and the\nallegations of the destruction of evidence. Therefore, for allegation (i), that the FBI or the\nBIA officers committed wrongs to Todd Murray, the Murray family and the Ute Tribe “by\nacting in concert with state/county/municipal officers, expressly or impliedly, in\nconcocting, or permitting to be concocted, a false story that Todd Murray shot himself in\nthe back of his head, execution style, above and behind his left ear,” plaintiffs have failed\nto state a claim.

As determined above, however, only affirmative acts trigger the “bad men”\nprovision of the 1868 Treaty. Plaintiffs offer no claims as to what affirmative action by\nfederal officials took place on Tribal lands which would implicate the “bad men” provision\nof the 1868 Treaty.\n                                               48\n\fcritical evidence both at the shooting scene and afterwards at the Medical Center,\nBlackburn Mortuary, and at the Utah OME,” plaintiffs have failed to state a claim.

These injuries include (i) the extra-territorial\n       police pursuit, assault upon and murder of Todd Murray, (ii) the conspiracy\n       to cover up Todd Murray’s murder, (iii) the failure of federal officers to take\n       custody of Murray’s body and to secure the body against desecration and\n       spoliation of evidence; (iv) the desecration of Murray’s body and the\n       spoliation of critical evidence both at the shooting scene and afterwards at\n       the Medical Center, Blackburn Mortuary, and at the Utah OME; (v) the\n       failure to insure that a proper autopsy was performed on Murray’s body;\n       [sic] (vii) failure of federal officers to conduct any kind of investigation into\n       Todd Murray’s murder; and (vi) the failure of federal officers to protect the\n       territorial integrity of the Tribe’s reservation boundary and the Tribe’s\n       sovereign interests in the crime scene where Murray was shot.\n\nThe court notes that of these additional claims, numbers (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi), and (viii),\noverlap with the allegations in the amended complaint addressed above. For claim (i),\nfrom the separate list of claims, “the extra-territorial police pursuit, assault upon and\nmurder of Todd Murray,” the extra-territorial pursuit also is not covered by the “bad men”\nprovision of the 1868 Treaty. For the remaining elements of claim (i) from the separate,\nadditional list of claims, “assault upon and murder of Todd Murray,” the United States\nDistrict Court for the District of Utah determined that the Mr. Murray’s injury is consistent\nwith a self-inflicted gunshot wound, and, in this court, plaintiffs are estopped from claiming\notherwise. Therefore, if the court were to consider the additional claims, additional claim\n(i) also fails to state a claim.\n                                               49\n\f       family under the Ute Treaties of 1863 and 1868 and under the various\n       federal laws listed under Paragraph 10 above.[34]\n                                             ...\n       In violation of federal law and its treaty obligations, the United States has\n       failed to investigate or prosecute the individuals involved in the shooting\n       death of 21 year-old Todd Murray on April 1, 2007, or the subsequent\n       conspiracy to suppress, alter, and destroy critical evidence related to the\n       shooting death.\n\n       The United States has also breached its trust obligations to the Tribe and\n       Murray’s family by failing to protect the territorial integrity of the Tribe’s\n       reservation and the Tribe’s sovereign interest in the shooting site, thus\n       allowing unauthorized persons to trespass on the Ute homeland and cause\n       harm to tribal members with complete impunity.\n\n\n34 The federal laws listed in paragraph include “the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848,\nincluding, without limitation, the Indian Country Crimes Act, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1151, 1152; the\nMajor Crimes Act, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1153, 2343; the Assimilative Crimes Act, 18 U.S.C. § 13;\nPublic Law 280, U.S.C. §1162; the Indian Civil Rights Act, 25 U.S.C. §§ 1301, 1302, 1321;\nand 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981, 1983, 1985.” Plaintiffs do not explain how any of the citations\nlisted establish money-mandating statutes to invoke jurisdiction in this court.

As such,\nthe Indian trust relationship “is defined and governed by statutes rather than the common\nlaw,” id. and “[t]he Government assumes Indian trust responsibilities only to the extent it\nexpressly accepts those responsibilities by statute.” Id. at 2325. The Supreme Court in\nJicarilla Apache Nation, determined, therefore, “Congress may style its relations with the\nIndians a ‘trust’ without assuming all the fiduciary duties of a private trustee, creating a\ntrust relationship that is ‘limited’ or ‘bare’ compared to a trust relationship between private\nparties at common law.” Id. at 2323 (quoting Mitchell I, 445 U.S. at 542). The trust\nrelationship, therefore, is limited to the management of tribal lands and assets.\n\n         In its motion to dismiss, defendant contends that the plaintiffs’ breach of trust claim\n“fail[s] to identify a substantive source of law that establishes specific fiduciary duties.”\nDefendant argues that “a fiduciary duty only arises if it is plain from the relevant statutes\nor regulations that the government has accepted such a responsibility.” Defendant\ncontends that because plaintiffs’ claims have no foundation in any substantive body of\nlaw, it fails to acquire subject-matter jurisdiction under the Tucker Act and therefore\nwarrants dismissal pursuant to RCFC 12(b)(1).\n\n        Plaintiffs correctly note that the Supreme Court has held that “any ambiguities in\nthe language of an Indian treaty must be resolved in favor of the Indians and courts must\nendeavor to ‘give effect to the terms as the Indians themselves would have understood\nthem.’” (quoting Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa Indians v.

Defendant argues, however, “Plaintiffs fail to identify any specific,\nunambiguous language in the Treaties that impose a fiduciary duty on the United States\nto guard against the assertion of state criminal jurisdiction.” Plaintiffs respond that Article\n10 of the 1863 Treaty and Article 2 and Article 6 of the 1868 Treaty confer upon the Ute\ntribe the substantive source of law that establishes specific fiduciary or other duties.\n\n                                              53\n\f       Article 10 of the 1863 Treaty provides:\n\n       Each family that shall announce through its head to the agent of the band a\n       willingness and determination to begin and follow the pursuits of agriculture,\n       by farming or raising stock and growing wool, upon such lands and\n       according to such regulations as the Secretary of the Interior may prescribe,\n       shall receive the following donations of stock to aid them in their endeavor\n       to gain a livelihood by such new pursuits, viz.:\n\n       Of cattle, one head annually during five years, beginning with the ratification\n       of this treaty.\n\n       Of sheep, ten head annually during the first two years after the ratification\n       of this treaty, and five head annually during the three years thereafter.\n\n       The Secretary of the Interior may also direct that their share of annuity\n       goods and provisions shall be of a character suited to such change of life:\n       Provided, however, That such stock shall only be donated as long as such\n       family shall in good faith keep and use the same for the purpose indicated\n       in this article.\n\n       All the Indians of said band who may adopt and conform to the provisions\n       of this article shall be protected in the quiet and peaceable possession of\n       their said lands and property.\n\n1863 Treaty, Art. 10 (emphasis in original). Plaintiffs also contend generally that the\nUnited States, “due to its absolute jurisdiction and control over Indian lands . . . has a\nspecific fiduciary duty to protect the reservation from the imposition of state criminal\njurisdiction over tribal members.” Plaintiffs, however, only cite to Navajo Tribe of Indians,\n624 F.2d at 989, and 25 U.S.C. § 200 (2012), which requires “a report or record” be\nsubmitted to the superintendent of the reservation whenever an Indian is confined or\nimprisoned on lands held in reserve. Plaintiffs do not elaborate how this creates the\nexistence of specific fiduciary duties between the United States and the Ute Indians, or\nany duties that are money-mandating regarding the alleged imprisonment or confinement.\nMoreover, Article 10 only addresses the land allotment for the Ute Indians who wish to\n“begin and follow agricultural or pastoral pursuits by farming or raising stock and growing\nwool, upon such lands and according to such regulations as the Secretary of the Interior\nmay prescribe” Id. Article 10 of the 1863 Treaty does not provide a specific fiduciary\nmoney mandating duty.\n\n      Plaintiffs also allege that Article 2 of the 1868 Ute Treaty establishes a duty to\nprevent trespass. In relevant part, Article 2 reads:\n\n       [N]o persons, except those authorized so to do, and except such officers,\n       agents, and employes [sic] of the Government as may be authorized to\n\n                                             54\n\f       enter upon Indian reservations in discharge of duties enjoined by law shall\n       ever be permitted to pass over, settle upon, or reside in the Territory\n       described in this article, except as herein otherwise provided.\n\n1868 Treaty, Art. 2. Defendant, notes, however, that “[p]laintiffs admit that ‘some courts\nhave held that the duty of the United States to ensure the quiet enjoyment of reservation\nlands does not make the government liable for general trespasses by third parties.’”\nMoreover, defendant notes that “[c]onspicuously absent in the events that constitute the\nalleged trespass of state law enforcement officials on the Reservation is the presence of\nany federal law enforcement officer.” In the amended complaint, the plaintiffs specifically\nidentify state officers, but not the federal officers, as having no right to be on the\nreservation. The amended complaint states: “Murray was shot after being pursued at gun-\npoint by two Utah state Highway Troopers, a Uintah County Sheriff’s Deputy, and an off-\nduty Vernal City, Utah, police officer. The pursuit took place over tribal trust lands more\nthan 25 miles inside the northern boundary of the U&O Reservation. The four shooting-\ninvolved officers had no criminal jurisdiction over Indians inside the U&O Reservation.”\nFor each of the four state officers, the amended complaint also alleges they are “not\ncross-deputized by the federal government or the Ute Tribe to exercise law enforcement\npowers over Native Americans inside the Ute Tribe’s Reservation.” The plaintiffs, do not,\nhowever, make a cross-deputized claim against any of the federal officials.\n\n          Finally, according to plaintiffs, the United States’ failure to prosecute the bad men\nwho murdered Mr. Murray and conspired to cover up the murder on April 1, 2007\nrepresents a breach of trust. Article 6 of the 1868 Treaty promises that “the United States\nwill . . . proceed at once to cause the offender to be arrested and punished according to\nthe laws of the United States.” 1868 Treaty, Art. 6. Plaintiffs argue that\n\n       The “bad men” clause of the 1868 Treaty, further expands the duty of the\n       U.S. to protect not only the Ute Tribe as a whole in its quiet possession of\n       the reservation lands, but also the individual Ute Indians against “any\n       wrong” perpetrated on them by any non-Indian.\n\n       Defendant contends that the 1868 Ute Treaty provision is not trust-creating, but\nrather bestows discretionary power upon the United States to prosecute bad men.\nMoreover, defendant states “[w]e do not question that the Treaty requires payment to\nindividuals under the ‘Bad Men’ clause, if the requirements of the Treaty are met. The\nTreaties, however, impose a duty upon the government to only pay individual members,\nnot the Tribe, in the event that unauthorized persons cause harm to person or property.”\n(emphasis in original). Moreover, for count one, this court did not find the United States\nhad violated the “bad men” provision as a result of the actions involving Mr. Murray’s\ndeath, and for count two, plaintiffs’ claims are repetitive of count one, as they specifically\nrepeat and re-allege the claims in count two.\n\n       None of the citations to the 1863 and 1868 Treaties provide a source of jurisdiction\nfor the breach of trust claims alleged by plaintiffs. Furthermore, none of the plaintiffs’\nbreach of trust claims identify any substantive law containing the “express language of a\n\n                                              55\n\ftrust.” See Samish Indian Nation v. United States, 419 F.3d at 1368. Moreover, plaintiffs\nhave not demonstrated how “[t]he United States has also breached its trust obligations to\nthe Tribe and Murray’s family by failing to protect the territorial integrity of the Tribe’s\nreservation and the Tribe’s sovereign interest in the shooting site, thus allowing\nunauthorized persons to trespass on the Ute homeland and cause harm to tribal members\nwith complete impunity,” or that “[t]he Defendant’s breach of its trust and treaty obligations\nhas resulted in substantial loss to the Tribe.” The court agrees with defendant that, “[i]n\nfact, Plaintiffs have not identified any ‘specific right-creating or duty-imposing statutory or\nregulatory prescriptions’ that establish ‘specific fiduciary or other duties’ that the United\nStates allegedly has failed to fulfill” as part of its trust duties. (quoting Navajo I, 537 U.S.\nat 506).\n\n        The court also agrees with defendant that “authority to institute both civil and\ncriminal litigation on behalf of the United States is committed to the discretion of the\nAttorney General.” (citing 28 U.S.C. § 516 (2012). The defendant further argues that “[t]he\nAttorney General’s exercise of his discretion to file litigation on behalf of the United States\nis ‘presumptively immune from judicial review.’” (quoting Shoshone Bannock Tribes v.\nReno, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"697619\"><a href=\"/opinion/697619/shoshone-bannock-tribes-v-janet-reno-attorney-general-of-the-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">56</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1476</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1480 (D.C. Cir. 1995)). Article 6 of the 1868 Treaty provides that the\nUnited States will “reimburse the injured person for the loss sustained,” however, payment\nis contingent on the “bad men” “offender” being “arrested and punished according to the\nlaws of the United States. . . .” 1868 Treaty, Art. 6. As noted above, the record does not\nreflect any prosecutions were initiated against any individuals named by the plaintiffs in\nthe above captioned case. Moreover, the decision issued by the United States District\nCourt for the District of Utah did not find any culpability on the part of any individual\naccused by plaintiffs in the death of Mr. Murray, further suggesting no reimbursement to\nthe plaintiffs is warranted. For the foregoing reasons, defendant’s motion to dismiss\nplaintiffs’ breach of trust claims for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction is granted.\n\n                                       CONCLUSION\n\n        Because plaintiffs have failed to state a claim and have not demonstrated\njurisdiction is proper in this court, defendant’s motion to dismiss is GRANTED. Plaintiffs’\namended complaint is DISMISSED. The Clerk's Office shall enter JUDGMENT consistent\nwith this opinion.\n\n       IT IS SO ORDERED.\n\n\n                                                            s/Marian Blank Horn\n                                                            MARIAN BLANK HORN\n                                                                     Judge\n\n\n\n\n                                              56\n\f</pre>",
