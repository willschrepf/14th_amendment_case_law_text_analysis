Any disposition provides at the least that the court assumes the duty of\ncare, contrcd, protection, and reasonable discipline of the child. Placing the child with a\nrelative temporarily extinguishes the parent’s right to have physical possession of the\nchild. The placing of a child with TYC is obviously the disposition which most thoroughly\nalters the rights, privileges, duties, and powers of a parent   However, no mention of the\ndifferent alterations of the parental powers and duties is made in the Texas Family Code.\n\n\n\n\n                                          p. 328\n\f.   1\n\n\n\n\n        Honorable Ron Jackson     -   Page Three         (MW-105)\n\n\n\n             One reacing of the law would give TYC very broad powers as a result of a court’s\n        commitment of a child to its care. Section 5102(3) of the Family Code defines guardian”\n        as\n\n                   the person who, under court order, is the guardian of the person of\n                   the child or the public or private agency with whom the child has\n                   been placed by a coup t\n\n        This plainly makes TYC the guardian of a child committed to it under section 54.04 of the\n        Family Code. Title 2 of the Family Code does not define “guardian” as a term of art but\n        does define the term “managing conservator,” in section 14.02. In the context of the\n        Probate Code, it has been squarely held that guardianship and managing conservatorship\n        are the same. Guardianship of Henson, 551 S.W.2d 136 (Tex. Civ. App. -- Cotpus Christi\n        1977, writ ref’d n.r.e.1. However, the definition of managing conservator in the Family\n        Code seems specially designed to deal with the problems raised in a divorce. This reading\n        would give TYC far more power over -its wards than we believe the legislature\n        contemplated    We therefore rest our opinion on other grouncb.\n\n               TYC originated with the Gatesville School for Boys in 1869. From that date until the\n        present TYC and its predecessors have provided medical services of all sorts to the\n        juveniles committed to its care with only the most general authorization.    For instance,\n        Acts 1913, 33rd Leg., lst C.S., ch. 6, SS 12,13, at 7, provided:\n\n                   The superintendent shall divide the inmates into such classes and\n                   shall house, feed and train them in such manner as he deems best\n                   for the development and advancement of the child. All inmates\n                   shall be provided with shelter, wholesome food and suitable\n                   clothing, books, means of healthful recreation and other material\n                   necessary for their training, at the expense of the state, except as\n                   otherwise provided by law.\n\n        This statute was the sole authority for education, housing, medical care and other\n        treatment of juveniles from its enactment until 1949. It is still on the books as V.T.C.S.\n        article 5129. That medical care was authorized by this very general language, and that the\n        legislature in fact was aware that such medical care was provided, is demonstrated by the\n        reference to a “resident nurse” in Acts 1913, 1st C.S., 33rd Leg., ch. 6, S 15, at 7. The\n        section was amended slightly and the words “school physician” were substituted for\n        “resident nurse” in 1945. Acts 1945, 49th Leg., ch. 247, S 1, at 385.\n\n              In 1949, the state legislature transferred the control of the State Training Schools,\n        including the Gatesville School for boys, from the Board of Control to a newly created\n        State Youth Development Council, V.T.C.S. art 5143c, and in 1957, to TYC. V.T.C.S. art.\n        5143d. In each ease it was specifically provided that the new agency would succeed to all\n        the powers and rights of its predecessor. Art. 5143q S 6; art 51434 S 5(c).\n\n              The 1949 legislation concerning juveniles was an attempt by the legislature to\n        organize and modernize the system of State Training Schools. The great bulk of article\n\n\n\n\n                                             P.    329\n\fHonorable Ron Jackson        -   Page Four         (Mw-105)\n\n\n\n5143c, the major 1949 statute, is devoted to laying out a blueprint for the organization of\nstate administrative  and judicial procedures dealing with juveniles.   Several sections of\nthe law also address the authority of the newly created state agency to deal with its\nwar&.     It seems clear from the fact that the original section which granted similar\nauthority, article 5129, was not repealed that the provisions of article 5143~ were meant\nmerely to elucidate and not to limit the powers of the state agency.\n\n      The new sections addressed the iszie in language somewhat more specific than the\nold, but still very generaL For example, article 5143c, section 1 stated that the purpose of\nthe act was to develop\n\n            in all children the spiritual,  mental, and physical resources\n            necessary for complete citizenship responsibility and participa-\n            tion . . .\n\nSection 2 of the article provided    significantly    for the purposes of interpretation,\n\n            This Act shall be liberally      construed     to accomplish    the purpose\n            herein sought.\n\n(Emphasis added.      It was also provided   in section 19 of article 5143~ that:\n\n            As a means of correcting the socially harmful tendencies           of a child\n            committed to it, the Council may:\n\n              . ...\n\n              (b) Require such modes of life and conduct as seem best adapted\n           to fit him for return to full liberty without daqer to the public;\n              (cl Provide such medical or psychiatric          treatment   as is\n           necessary; . . .\n\nArticle 5143c, section 26(a) contains evidence that the legislature considered medical care\nand treatment of its wards to be among the responsibilities of the agency. It provides\nthat:\n\n           For the purpose of carrying out its duties, the Council is authorized\n           to make use of law enforcement, detention, supervisory, medical,\n           educational,    correctional,  segregative,    and other    facilities,\n           institutions and agencies, within the State. . . .\n\nIn addition to these very broad guidelines, the agency           was given extensive rule-making\npowers, article 5143+ section 22; and the power to order         a child’s confinement “under such\nconditions as it believes best designed for his welfare          and the interests of the public,”\narticle 5143c, S 18. The 1957 legislation reorganized             the system again, but left the\nsubstantive provisions quoted above virtually intact.\n\n\n\n\n                                              p.     336\n\f.   I\n\n\n\n\n         Honorable Ron Jackson      -   Page Five        (MW-105)\n\n\n\n               Summarizing the historical grant of authority to TYC and its predecessors, we\n         conclude that this authority was broad indeed. Prior to 1949 it plainly included the power\n         to consent to medical care Nothing in the 1949 and 1957 enactments changed that. When\n         an emergency situation required hospitalization of a TYC ward, the superintendent of the\n         school signed the hospital’s consent form. For most matters, however, no consent form\n         was required because most ordinary medical care was provided by the schools themselves.\n         Every TYC institution has and has had for many years a staff physician, a staff dentist, a\n         staff psychiatrist and a staff of several nurses.\n\n                When the legislature enacted the Family Code, it did not repeal any section of\n         article 5143d. On the contrary, the statement of purpose in section 51.01 of the Family\n         Code indicates that the broad aims and grant of power under article 5143d were to be\n         continued undiminished     It was again emphasized that the purpose was to “provide for the\n         care, the protection, and the wholesome moral, mental, and h icsl development of\n         children” coming within the provisions of Title 3 of the Family   ’ %!ZK     Section 5LOl(l).\n         (Emphasis added.     According to article 51.01(4), the state intends to give its wards “the\n         care that should be provided by parents”        Under article 5143d, section 23(a) TYC is\n         enjoined to provide for the needs of a child ‘!as those needs would be met in an adequate\n         home.” Rather than limiting the authority of the state to act to provide care for\n         delinquent children, the drafters of the Family Code intended to give the state adequate\n         power to upgrade the quality of services provided Dawson, Commentary on Title 3, Texas\n         Family Code, 5 Tex. Tech L. Rev. 509 (1974). It was considered that the state would be\n         acting as a “parent”\n\n               TYC is authorized to consent to medical treatment of its wards when parents have\n         not responded to a request for consent. The conclusion that TYC has the power to consent\n         to medical care for its wards is thus supported by the historical practice and the statutory\n         scheme creating TYC. It would be anomalous to find that the legislature, having charged\n         TYC with the care of delinquent youths, failed to grant the agency the power to consent\n         to such care on behalf of its wards. The order of a juvenile court committing a child to\n         TYC should be construed as a judicial order, within the meaning of section 12.04 of the\n         Family Code, which grants to TYC, as the child’s guardian, a power to consent to medical\n         care which supersedes that of the parents\n\n                Turning to the second question, we find that its resolution is slightly more complex.\n          This is so because TYC’s power is limited. TYC’s guardianship powers under article 5143d\n          extend only so far as is necessary to accomplish the statutory purpose. While its authority\n          supersedes the power of the parent in many respects, some residuum of parental power\n          remains. For example, TYC may not require its wards to submit to religious training\n          because the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States prohibits it.\n          Parents may do so. In the area of medical care, the state’s power to consent to medical\n          treatment    and procedures extends only to those which are reasonably calculated to\n        . improve a child’s prospects for future health and rehabilitation, and thus for reintegration\n          mto society.    We conclude that while TYC has the power to override some parental\n          objections, its decisions would be subject to attack by a parent or a guardian ad litem of\n          the child, on the ground that the decisions would not be in the child’s best interest        In\n          such a situation the wishes of the child would be extremely important       The resolution of\n\n\n\n\n                                                    P.    331\n\fHonorable Ron Jackson     -   Page Six        (NW-105)\n\n\n\nthis conflict would depend upon the nature of the medical procedlae proposed and the\nrelative weight of the various interests of the parent, child, and state which it involved\nThis balancing of competing interests by a court comports with the scheme envisioned by\nsection 35.01 of the Family Code. It is important to note, however, that section 35.01 does\nnot overn the situation being discussed When TYC has notice of a parental objectio=\nshou d seek a judicial determination of its authority in a court having jurisdiction of the\n2- .\n\n       Even in the face of parental objections, TYC has independent authority to compel\ntreatment of its warcb for infectious or contagious diseeses. Jacobson v. Massachusetts,\n197 U.S. 11(1905); Abney v. Fox, 250 S.W. 210 (Tex. Civ. App - Austin 1923, writ ref’dl. It\nis also true that a mmor may consent to the diagnosis and treatment of any infectious,\ncontagious, or communicable disease which is required by law or regulation to be reported\nto a local health officer. Sec. 35.03 Texas Family Code. Such laws and regulations exist\nin Texas. See V.T.C.S. art 4477, Rules l-33. In an emergency situation, and possibly in\nother situations, actual consent of either parents or child is not necessary since consent\nwill normally be implied -See Mm                    222 S.W. 225 (Tex. Comm’n App 19201,\njdgm t admted\n\n       In answer to your third question, the objections of a minor to medical treatment may\nin the ordinary course of things be overridden by TYC. TYC always has the duty to act in\nthe child’s best interest, and a decision by TYC to require one of its wards to undergo any\nparticular medical treatment would be subject to attack on this ground, but we think that\nrequiring medical treatment is generally within TYC’s grant of authority under article\n5143d We note, but do not address, the question of the extent of the constitutional right\narticulated in Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973).

Compare Chapters 15 and 17 of Title 2, with\n                   Chapters 51, 52, 53 and 54 of Title 3.

Any disposition provides at the least that the court assumes the duty of\ncare, contrcd, protection, and reasonable discipline of the child. Placing the child with a\nrelative temporarily extinguishes the parent’s right to have physical possession of the\nchild. The placing of a child with TYC is obviously the disposition which most thoroughly\nalters the rights, privileges, duties, and powers of a parent   However, no mention of the\ndifferent alterations of the parental powers and duties is made in the Texas Family Code.\n\n\n\n\n                                          p. 328\n\f.   1\n\n\n\n\n        Honorable Ron Jackson     -   Page Three         (MW-105)\n\n\n\n             One reacing of the law would give TYC very broad powers as a result of a court’s\n        commitment of a child to its care.

Title 2 of the Family Code does not define “guardian” as a term of art but\n        does define the term “managing conservator,” in section 14.02. In the context of the\n        Probate Code, it has been squarely held that guardianship and managing conservatorship\n        are the same.

However, the definition of managing conservator in the Family\n        Code seems specially designed to deal with the problems raised in a divorce. This reading\n        would give TYC far more power over -its wards than we believe the legislature\n        contemplated    We therefore rest our opinion on other grouncb.\n\n               TYC originated with the Gatesville School for Boys in 1869. From that date until the\n        present TYC and its predecessors have provided medical services of all sorts to the\n        juveniles committed to its care with only the most general authorization.    For instance,\n        Acts 1913, 33rd Leg., lst C.S., ch. 6, SS 12,13, at 7, provided:\n\n                   The superintendent shall divide the inmates into such classes and\n                   shall house, feed and train them in such manner as he deems best\n                   for the development and advancement of the child. All inmates\n                   shall be provided with shelter, wholesome food and suitable\n                   clothing, books, means of healthful recreation and other material\n                   necessary for their training, at the expense of the state, except as\n                   otherwise provided by law.\n\n        This statute was the sole authority for education, housing, medical care and other\n        treatment of juveniles from its enactment until 1949. It is still on the books as V.T.C.S.\n        article 5129. That medical care was authorized by this very general language, and that the\n        legislature in fact was aware that such medical care was provided, is demonstrated by the\n        reference to a “resident nurse” in Acts 1913, 1st C.S., 33rd Leg., ch. 6, S 15, at 7. The\n        section was amended slightly and the words “school physician” were substituted for\n        “resident nurse” in 1945. Acts 1945, 49th Leg., ch. 247, S 1, at 385.\n\n              In 1949, the state legislature transferred the control of the State Training Schools,\n        including the Gatesville School for boys, from the Board of Control to a newly created\n        State Youth Development Council, V.T.C.S. art 5143c, and in 1957, to TYC. V.T.C.S. art.\n        5143d. In each ease it was specifically provided that the new agency would succeed to all\n        the powers and rights of its predecessor. Art. 5143q S 6; art 51434 S 5(c).\n\n              The 1949 legislation concerning juveniles was an attempt by the legislature to\n        organize and modernize the system of State Training Schools. The great bulk of article\n\n\n\n\n                                             P.    329\n\fHonorable Ron Jackson        -   Page Four         (Mw-105)\n\n\n\n5143c, the major 1949 statute, is devoted to laying out a blueprint for the organization of\nstate administrative  and judicial procedures dealing with juveniles.   Several sections of\nthe law also address the authority of the newly created state agency to deal with its\nwar&.     It seems clear from the fact that the original section which granted similar\nauthority, article 5129, was not repealed that the provisions of article 5143~ were meant\nmerely to elucidate and not to limit the powers of the state agency.\n\n      The new sections addressed the iszie in language somewhat more specific than the\nold, but still very generaL For example, article 5143c, section 1 stated that the purpose of\nthe act was to develop\n\n            in all children the spiritual,  mental, and physical resources\n            necessary for complete citizenship responsibility and participa-\n            tion . . .\n\nSection 2 of the article provided    significantly    for the purposes of interpretation,\n\n            This Act shall be liberally      construed     to accomplish    the purpose\n            herein sought.\n\n(Emphasis added.      It was also provided   in section 19 of article 5143~ that:\n\n            As a means of correcting the socially harmful tendencies           of a child\n            committed to it, the Council may:\n\n              . ...\n\n              (b) Require such modes of life and conduct as seem best adapted\n           to fit him for return to full liberty without daqer to the public;\n              (cl Provide such medical or psychiatric          treatment   as is\n           necessary; . . .\n\nArticle 5143c, section 26(a) contains evidence that the legislature considered medical care\nand treatment of its wards to be among the responsibilities of the agency. It provides\nthat:\n\n           For the purpose of carrying out its duties, the Council is authorized\n           to make use of law enforcement, detention, supervisory, medical,\n           educational,    correctional,  segregative,    and other    facilities,\n           institutions and agencies, within the State. . . .\n\nIn addition to these very broad guidelines, the agency           was given extensive rule-making\npowers, article 5143+ section 22; and the power to order         a child’s confinement “under such\nconditions as it believes best designed for his welfare          and the interests of the public,”\narticle 5143c, S 18. The 1957 legislation reorganized             the system again, but left the\nsubstantive provisions quoted above virtually intact.\n\n\n\n\n                                              p.     336\n\f.   I\n\n\n\n\n         Honorable Ron Jackson      -   Page Five        (MW-105)\n\n\n\n               Summarizing the historical grant of authority to TYC and its predecessors, we\n         conclude that this authority was broad indeed. Prior to 1949 it plainly included the power\n         to consent to medical care Nothing in the 1949 and 1957 enactments changed that. When\n         an emergency situation required hospitalization of a TYC ward, the superintendent of the\n         school signed the hospital’s consent form. For most matters, however, no consent form\n         was required because most ordinary medical care was provided by the schools themselves.\n         Every TYC institution has and has had for many years a staff physician, a staff dentist, a\n         staff psychiatrist and a staff of several nurses.\n\n                When the legislature enacted the Family Code, it did not repeal any section of\n         article 5143d. On the contrary, the statement of purpose in section 51.01 of the Family\n         Code indicates that the broad aims and grant of power under article 5143d were to be\n         continued undiminished     It was again emphasized that the purpose was to “provide for the\n         care, the protection, and the wholesome moral, mental, and h icsl development of\n         children” coming within the provisions of Title 3 of the Family   ’ %!ZK     Section 5LOl(l).\n         (Emphasis added.     According to article 51.01(4), the state intends to give its wards “the\n         care that should be provided by parents”        Under article 5143d, section 23(a) TYC is\n         enjoined to provide for the needs of a child ‘!as those needs would be met in an adequate\n         home.” Rather than limiting the authority of the state to act to provide care for\n         delinquent children, the drafters of the Family Code intended to give the state adequate\n         power to upgrade the quality of services provided Dawson, Commentary on Title 3, Texas\n         Family Code, 5 Tex. Tech L. Rev. 509 (1974). It was considered that the state would be\n         acting as a “parent”\n\n               TYC is authorized to consent to medical treatment of its wards when parents have\n         not responded to a request for consent. The conclusion that TYC has the power to consent\n         to medical care for its wards is thus supported by the historical practice and the statutory\n         scheme creating TYC. It would be anomalous to find that the legislature, having charged\n         TYC with the care of delinquent youths, failed to grant the agency the power to consent\n         to such care on behalf of its wards. The order of a juvenile court committing a child to\n         TYC should be construed as a judicial order, within the meaning of section 12.04 of the\n         Family Code, which grants to TYC, as the child’s guardian, a power to consent to medical\n         care which supersedes that of the parents\n\n                Turning to the second question, we find that its resolution is slightly more complex.\n          This is so because TYC’s power is limited. TYC’s guardianship powers under article 5143d\n          extend only so far as is necessary to accomplish the statutory purpose. While its authority\n          supersedes the power of the parent in many respects, some residuum of parental power\n          remains. For example, TYC may not require its wards to submit to religious training\n          because the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States prohibits it.\n          Parents may do so. In the area of medical care, the state’s power to consent to medical\n          treatment    and procedures extends only to those which are reasonably calculated to\n        . improve a child’s prospects for future health and rehabilitation, and thus for reintegration\n          mto society.    We conclude that while TYC has the power to override some parental\n          objections, its decisions would be subject to attack by a parent or a guardian ad litem of\n          the child, on the ground that the decisions would not be in the child’s best interest        In\n          such a situation the wishes of the child would be extremely important       The resolution of\n\n\n\n\n                                                    P.    331\n\fHonorable Ron Jackson     -   Page Six        (NW-105)\n\n\n\nthis conflict would depend upon the nature of the medical procedlae proposed and the\nrelative weight of the various interests of the parent, child, and state which it involved\nThis balancing of competing interests by a court comports with the scheme envisioned by\nsection 35.01 of the Family Code.

Comm’n App 19201,\njdgm t admted\n\n       In answer to your third question, the objections of a minor to medical treatment may\nin the ordinary course of things be overridden by TYC. TYC always has the duty to act in\nthe child’s best interest, and a decision by TYC to require one of its wards to undergo any\nparticular medical treatment would be subject to attack on this ground, but we think that\nrequiring medical treatment is generally within TYC’s grant of authority under article\n5143d We note, but do not address, the question of the extent of the constitutional right\narticulated in Roe v.
