A justice of the Supreme Court, for good cause shown, may extend the time for applying for a writ of certiorari for a period not exceeding sixty days.' 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2101(c).

Teague v. Regional Commissioner of Customs, 394 U.S. 977, 982, 89 S.Ct. 1457, 22 L.Ed.2d 756 (dissenting opinion). And in Ray v.

Yet I can see no reason why mailing or other transmission to this Court shall not be construed as an application for relief within the meaning of the time provisions of &#167; 2101(c).

Then on the day the petition was due he forwarded it prepaid on Piedmont Airlines to Washington and arranged to have someone deliver it to the Court. But the airline lost all the papers.

How can we possibly say that it does injustice to &#167; 2101(c) to conclude that these efforts for review were not 'taken or applied for within ninety days' with the meaning of &#167; 2101(c)?
