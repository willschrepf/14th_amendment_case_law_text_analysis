Nelson specially concurs and dissents.\n\n                                        Introduction\n\n       I concur with this Court’s appointment of Dr. Janine Pease-PrettyOn Top to be the\n\nfifth member and chairperson of the reapportionment commission. I strongly dissent,\n\nhowever, from the manner in which we have exercised our power of appointment under\n\nArticle V, Section 14(2) of the Montana Constitution. This entire process of appointment,\n\nincluding all of this Court’s deliberationson this matter, should have been open to the public.\n\n       In this regard, and as pointed out by the specially concmring Justices,my dtssent does\n\nnot arise from a ruling by this Court in responseto an original proceeding or suit to open to\n\nthe public our deliberations on this matter. Rather, the genesisof my disagreement is the\n\n5-2 rejection of my motion, made before we began our discussionson this appointment, that\n\nwe conduct our deliberations and make our decision on this particular matter in open\n\nsessions. As noted, the more conventional route for raising this issue would have been an\n\nadversary proceeding filed in or against this Court. Notwithstanding, in the twenty-seven\n\nyears since the adoption of the 1972Constitution, no one has seenfit to file such a challenge.\n\nWhy, I do not know, but I suspectthat the reason for this failure goes more to the politics of\n\nnot wanting to go head-to-head with the highest court in this State on a controversial issue\n\ndirectly affecting the fundamental way we conduct our business,rather than it does with the\n\nmerits of the constitutional arguments for and against.\n\n       More to the point, however, how this issue was raised is of little consequence.The\n\n\n                                               2\n\f;-~\nI     fact of the matter is that no one and no organization should have to sue us or even request\nI\n      that we conform our own operations to the clear and unambiguous mandate of the\n\n      Constitution.   As we stated in Associated Press v. Bd. of Public Educ. (1991), 246 Mont.\n\n      386,391, 804 P.2d 376,379, “[flirst and foremost, is the realization that the Constitution is\n\n      the supreme law of this State. Its mandate must befollowed by each of the three branches\n\n      ofgovernment.” [Emphasis added]. Therefore, it is with this mandate that I begin.\n\n                                               Discussion\n\n             Article II, Section 9 of the Montana Constitution provides:\n\n                    Right to know. No person shall be deprived of the right to examine\n             documentsor to observe the deliberations of allpublic bodies or agenciesof\n             state government and its subdivisions,except in casesin which the demand of\n             individualprivacy clearly exceedsthe merits ofpublic disclosure. [Emphasis\n             added.]\n\n      My researchrevealsno Montana caselaw ruling on the applicability or inapplicability of this\n\n      constitutional provision to the judicial branch or, more specifically, to the proceedings and\n\n      deliberations of this Court. Therefore, I turn to the rules of constitutional construction.\n\n             In resolving disputes of constitutional construction, this Court applies the rules of\n\n      statutory construction.   Under those rules, the intent of the framers of the Constitution is\n\n      controlling and that intent must first be determined from the plain language of the words\n\n      used. Butte-Silver Bow Local Govern. v. State (1989), 235 Mont. 398,403,768 P.2d 327,\n\n      330 (citation omitted). Moreover, under these rules, if the language is clear and\n\n      unambiguous, no further interpretation is required. Love11v. State Comp. Mut. Ins. Fund\n\n\n                                                    3\n\f(1993), 260 Mont. 279, 285, 860 P.2d 95, 99 (citation omitted). The courts may not go\n\nfurther and apply any other means of interpretation, Tongue River Elec. Coop. v. Mont.\n\nPower Co. (1981), 195 Mont. 511, 515, 636 P.2d 862, 864 (citation omitted), nor may a\n\njudge insert into a constitutional provision what has been omitted or omit what has been\n\ninserted, see 5 l-2-101, MCA.\n\n       Applying these well-settled rules of constitutional construction, it is clear that the\n\nplain language of Article II, Section 9, does not exempt this Court from the provision’s\n\nmandate. Rather, Montana’s constitutional “right to know” unambiguously covers the\n\ndeliberations ofallpublic   bodies of state government.\n\n       Nonetheless,even ignoring the clarity of Article II, Section 9, and the dictates of our\n\nconstitutional construction jurisprudence, the proceedings of the 1972 Constitutional\n\nConvention also lead to the conclusion that the “right to know” requirements do not apply\n\nexclusively to the legislative and executive branchesof state government and its subdivisions\n\nto the exclusion of the judicial branch.\n\n       In point of fact, the delegatesto the Constitutional Convention amendedthe language\n\nof what becameArticle II, Section 8 of the Montana Constitution, which gives the public the\n\nright to participate in the operations of governmental agencies, on Delegate Berg’s motion,\n\nso as to exclude the judicial branch. See Montana Constitutional Convention, Verbatim\n\nTranscript, March 7,1972, pp. 1663-67(comments ofDelegates Berg, Dahood, and McNeil).\n\nNotwithstanding that these same delegates discussedthe language of what became Article\n\n\n                                              4\n\fII,   Section 9 of the Montana Constitution on the same afternoon that they amended the\n\nlanguage of what became Article II, Section 8, they did not even discuss amending the\n\nlanguage of what became Article II, Section 9, so as to exclude the judicial branch. See\n\nMontana Constitutional Convention, Verbatim Transcript, March 7, 1972, pp. 1667-1680.\n\n         Delegate Berg, however, subsequentlymoved to amend the languageof what became\n\nArticle II, Section 9, out of his concern that the phrase “public bodies” could be interpreted\n\nto include juries, grand juries, or the deliberations of this Court. Montana Constitutional\n\nConvention, Verbatim Transcript, March 16, 1972, pp. 2499-2501. Delegate Dahood stated\n\nthat he agreed with Delegate Berg and that the committee was “not trying to upset any\n\ntraditional rule of procedure with respectto anything within thejudiciary.” Notwithstanding,\n\nDelegate Dahood statedthat he would not amendthe section as Delegate Berg had suggested.\n\nDelegate Berg then stated in his closing statement in support of his motion that “my purpose\n\nin asking to delete the word[s] ‘bodies or’ is to eliminate the potential interpretation that it\n\nmight include juries, grand juries, [or] Supreme Court deliberations.”                Montana\n\nConstitutional Convention, Verbatim Transcript, March 16, 1972, p. 2501. Despite Delegate\n\nBerg’s concerns, his motion failed.        Montana Constitutional Convention, Verbatim\n\nTranscript, March 16, 1972, p. 2501.\n\n         Thus, even though Delegate Berg expressedthe same concern with regard to what\n\nbecame Article II, Section 8, and what became Article II, Section 9, the delegatesamended\n\nonly the languageof what becameArticle II, Section 8, so as to exclude the judicial branch.\n\n\n                                               5\n\f                                    __..~   ~~_--   ~.~ __._,~~.~.~~,..~. _. ~,~~~~\n\nMore to the point, the delegatesdeclined to amend the language of what became Article II,\n\nSection 9, so as to exclude the judicial branch even though faced with the sameconcern that\n\nprompted them to amend what becameArticle II, Section 8.\n\n       Hence, not only the plain language but also the constitutional history of these\n\ncompanion provisions of the Montana Constitution show that Article II, Section 9, is broader\n\nthan Article II, Section 8. Article II, Section 9, gives the public the right to observe the\n\ndeliberations of allpublic bodies and agencieswhile Article II, Section 8, gives the public\n\nthe right topnvticipnte only in the operationsof agencies. That, of course, begs the question\n\nwhether this Court is a “public body.” The answer to this question is undeniably “yes.”\n\n       In Common Cause v. Statutory Committee (1994), 263 Mont. 324,329, 868 P.2d GO4,\n\n607, we noted that the rights which Article II, Section 9, guarantees are protected and\n\nimplemented primarily through Montana’s open meeting statutes, codified at 9s 2-3-201, et\n\nseq., MCA. One of these statutes, 5 2-3-203(l), MCA, provides:\n\n       All meetings ofpublic or governmental bodies, boards, bureaus,commissions,\n       agenciesof the state, or any political subdivision of the state or organizations\n       or agenciessupported in whole or in part by public funds or expending public\n       funds must be open to the public. [Emphasis added.]\n\nIn Conrnzon Cause, we recognized that the legislature did not define “public body” or\n\n“governmental body” in the open meeting statutes. Common Cause, 263 Mont. at 330, 868\n\nP.2d at 608. Thus, we gave the words in these phrases their “plain, ordinary and usual\n\nmeaning” and stated that “the common understandingof the phrase ‘public or governmental\n\nbody’ would include a group of individuals organized for a governmental or public purpose.”\n\n                                               6,\n\fCommon Cause, 263 Mont. at 330,        868   P.2d at   608   (citations omitted). There can be no\n\ndoubt, this Court is a group of individuals organizedby and under the Montana Constitution\n\nfor a governmental purpose. It follows, then, that this Court is a public or governmental\n\nbody.\n\n        Similarly, in Grent Fulls Tribune Co., Inc. v. Day, 1998MT 133,y 16,289 Mont. 155,\n\n7 16,959 P.2d 508,~ 16, this Court, in determining whether the Department of Corrections\n\nCommittee for Private Prison Screening and Evaluation was a “public body,” looked to the\n\nMontana Procurement Act, which defines “governmental body” as\n\n        a department, commission, council, board, bureau, committee, institution,\n        legislative body, agency, government corporation, or other entity,\n        instrumentality, or official of the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of\n        this state, including the board of regents and the Montana university system.\n\nSection 18-4-123(1 l), MCA (emphasis added). We stated that, since the committee was a\n\ncommittee of the executive branch of government, and a “governmental body” for purposes\n\nof procurement, “it necessarily follows that it is an agency of state government to which\n\nArticle II, Section 9, applies.” Great Falls Tribune, 7 17. This Court is clearly an “entity\n\n   of the     judicial branch of this state,” and, therefore, a “governmental body.” Section\n\n1%4-123( 1l), MCA. Thus, it “necessarily follows” that this Court is a “public body” to\n\nwhich Article II, Section 9, applies. Great Falls Tribune, 7 17.\n\n        The same conclusion can be drawn from our decision in Becky v. Butte-Silver Bow\n\nSch. Dist. I (1995), 274 Mont. 131, 906 P.2d 193. In Becky, this Court, in determining\n\nwhether the records of an organization were “documents of public bodies,” looked to 5 2-6-\n\n                                                7\n\f101(2)(a),     MCA,   which statesthat “public writings” are\n\n         the written acts or records of the acts of the sovereign authority, of official\n         bodies and tribunals, and of public officers, legislative,,judiciaZ,and executive,\n         whether of this state, of the United States, of a sister state, or of a foreign\n         country;\n\nBecky, 274 Mont. at 137,906 P.Zd at 197 (quoting 3 2-6-101(2)(a), MCA) (emphasisadded).\n\nSection 2-6-101, MCA, also states that there are four classesof public writings and that\n\n“judicial records” are one of the classes. Section 2-6-101(3)(b), MCA.         Finally, although\n\nwe recognizedthat “documents of public bodies” is not defined in the Montana Constitution,\n\nwe stated that “it must reasonably be held to mean documents generated or maintained by\n\na public body which are somehow related to the function and duties of that body.” Becky,\n\n274 Mont. at 138,906 P.2d at 197\n\n         Applying the definiti,:n of “public writings” found in $2-6-101(2)(a), MCA, it is clear\n\nthat most, if not all, of the d’ cuments which this Court generatesand maintains are “public\n\nwritings,” and, therefore, a: j: “documents of a public body.” Thus, since the documents\n\nwhich this Court generates 3nd maintains are “documents of a public body,” it follows\n\n(perhaps backwardly) that 1,lis Court is a “public body” to which Article II, Section 9,\n\napplies.\n\n             As these cases de: ronstrate, this Court has been particularly vigilant and\n\nuncompromising in protectin : Montanans’ constitutional “right to know” and in rejecting\n\nother governmental bodies’ at empts to limit or subvert this right. In Great Fulls Tribune,\n\nfor example, the committee arg.ted that the public’s right to observe its meetings with private\n\n                                                 8\n\f                                             .       .\n\n\n\n\ncompanies which had submitted proposalsto build a private correctional facility in Montana\n\nand to review the papers associatedwith the companies’ proposals was outweighed by the\n\ncompanies’ right to privacy in the information that they had submitted. Great Falls Tribune,\n\n18. We held, however, that the Great Falls Tribune had a constitutional right under Article\n\nII, Section 9, to observe the committee’s deliberations and to examine the committee’s\n\ndocuments, including proposalsthat had been submitted to it. Great Fulls Tribune, 133. We\n\nalso stated that the only exception to the public’s right to observe the committee’s\n\ndeliberations and documents concerned information to which the companies had a privacy\n\ninterest. Great Falls Tribune, 7 33.\n\n       In sum, and basedon the foregoing, if there exists somevalid argument for exempting\n\nthe deliberations and decision-making processesof this Court from the operation of Article\n\nII, Section 9, the rationale is neither apparent in the tenor of our prior jurisprudence nor,\n\nmore importantly, in the plain languageof the constitutional provision itself or in the history\n\nof its adoption.\n\n       And, with regard to the latter, while the concurring Justices read the Constitutional\n\nConvention history of Article II, Section 9, a great deal more restrictively than 1 do,\n\nnevertheless that history--and our disagreement over what it means--is largely academic.\n\nFor, as we made eminently clear in Associated Press,\n\n              [t]he language of [Article II, Section 91 speaksfor itself. It applies to\n       all persons and all public bodies of the state and its subdivisions without\n       exception. Under such circumstances, it is our duty to interpret the intent of\n       the framers from the language of the provision alone and not to resort to\n\n                                                 9\n\f   ,     ‘I                                                                               .,\n\n\n\n\n       extrinsic aids or rules of construction in determining the intent of the delegates\n       to the Constitutional Convention.\n\nAssociatedPress, 246 Mont. at 392, 804 P.2d at 379 (quoting Great Falls Tribune v. District\n\nCourt (1980), 186 Mont. 433,437-38, 608 P.2d 116, 119.\n\n       Similarly irrelevant are the concurring Justices’ concerns as to the impact of\n\ncomplying with Article II, Section 9, on the operationsand functioning of this Court. In this\n\nregard, I make three observations. First, since we are bound by the “right to know” provision\n\nof the Constitution of Montana, we, and litigants, will simply have to deal with the\n\nconsequences changesthat flow from opening our deliberationsand operate accordingly.\n           and\n\nOther public bodies of state government seemto be able to comply with the requirements of\n\nArticle II, Section 9, and, yet, function quite well. I find it difficult to believe that, given the\n\ncaliber of the justices serving on this Court, that we are not, likewise, up to the task.\n\n Likewise, I refuse to be cowed by the concurrences’\n                                                   paradeof horribles-internal memos and\n\n proposed opinions being made public, media blitzes, massesof the unwashed converging\n\n upon the Court, cases settling, criminals jumping bail. Good griefl            If, before a final\n\n opinion is handed down, litigants want to settle, jump bail or jump off a bridge, for that\n\n matter, they can, and often do that now. If votes change between the time of initial\n\n discussion and final opinion, then those who acted prematurely will have to bear the\n\n consequences their bad or good decision.\n             of\n\n         Second,in my experience,every public body that has been faced with the prospect of\n\n opening its operations to the press and public has put forth a whole list of problems and\n\n                                                  10\n\f.-__..      ---.__-                                                              -\n\n\nreascms    why   it is unique;   why   “right   to know”    should   not apply   to it; why   the functions   and,\n\n\nperhaps, very existence of the body itself will be compromised by the changesthat will be\n\nforced upon it; and why the public will run amuck or abuse the new found information\n\ngleaned from open meetings. In point of fact, in the many caseswhere we have rejected\n\nthese very arguments and have, instead, required compliance with the Constitution, the sky\n\ndid not fall; the sun rose the next day; the public body complied; and the business of\n\ngovernment went on. Again, and despite the concurring Justices’ concerns, I suggest that\n\nthis Court would continue to function quite effectively and quite well if we opened our\n\ndeliberations and proceedings in compliance with Article II, Section 9.\n\n          Third, the concurring Justicesraise the specterof opening to the press and public the\n\ndeliberationsof trial juries. In doing so, they read more into my dissent than I have written.\n\nMy present concern is with the applicability of Article II, Section 9, to the operations of this\n\nCourt. I agree that there are fundamental differences in the functioning of trial juries that\n\nmay well, if not likely, preclude the provision’s applications to those bodies. That, however,\n\nhas absolutely nothing to do with the matter at issue. I believe that the requirements of\n\nArticle II, Section 9, apply to the operationsof this Court, and that is all this dissentis about.\n\n          Finally, even assumingnrgtle/zdo,that somehow the “right to know” provisions of the\n\nMontana Constitution do not apply to the judicial deliberations and decision-making\n\nprocessesof this Court, the exercise of our power of appointment under Article V, Section\n\n14(2), is not a judicial function but is, rather, an administrative one. We are not here called\n\n\n                                                           11\n\fupon to decide a justiciable controversy, to rule on a legal question, to interpret the law or\n\nthe Constitution, to issue a writ, to discipline an attorney, to make rules governing the\n\npractice and procedure before the courts of this State, or to appoint persons to committees\n\nand commissions that directly affect the operation of the courts and the administration of\n\njustice--all traditional judicial functions.\n\n       To the contrary, we are here simply executing a default power to appoint the fifth\n\nperson to a bi-partisan commission whose decisions will impact primarily the legislative\n\nbranch and the future balance of political power between the Democrat and Republican\n\nparties, between urban and agriculture interests, and between Indians and non-Indians in this\n\nState. Requiring judges to make an appointment to a non-judicial, political commission--\n\neven where that requirement is basedin the Constitution--does not make the appointment or\n\nthe process and deliberations leading up to it a judicial function any more than is a judge’s\n\n performance of the administrative act of hiring, supervising, demoting or tiring a judicial\n\n employee a judicial function. Simply put--and the law is clear on this point--not every\n\n official act required of a court is a judicial function becausethe act in question happens to\n\n be performed by a judge. SeeForrester v. White (1988), 484 U.S. 219,227, 108 S.Ct. 538,\n\n 544, 98 L.Ed.2d 555; Clarkv. Dussault (1994), 265 Mont. 479, 487-88, 878 P.2d 239, 244;\n\n C/ark, 265 Mont. at 490-93, 878 P.2d at 246-48 (Nelson, J., concurring).~\n\n         Indeed, in this context and recognizing the exercise of our appointment authority\n\n under Article V, Section 14(2), for what it is--an administrative decision impacting primarily\n\n\n                                                12\n\fthe legislative branch--I find it ironic, to say the least, that decisions of this Court and the\n\ndistrict courts have preserved Montanans’ “right to know” and to observe the making of\n\nsimilar sorts of decisions in the pre-session and in-session political party caucusesagainst\n\nlegislative attempts to keep those proceedings and deliberations closed to the press and\n\npublic. SeeAssoc. Press v. SenateRepublican Caucus (1997), 286 Mont. 172,95 1 P.2d 65.\n\nYet, this Court is unwilling to subject its own processes and deliberations involving\n\nessentially the samesort of decisionto the constitutionally-mandatedpublic scrutiny that we\n\nhave held applies to the legislature. I cannot accept this double standard.\n\n       Justice Leaphart, however, believesthe doublestandardis justified--in fact, mandated-\n\n-because our appointment authority is grounded in the Constitution itself. I cannot agree.\n\nThere is no basis for concluding that the discharge of our obligations under Article V,\n\nSection 14(2)--whether those are characterized as judicial or administrative--and under\n\nArticle II, Section 9, are incompatible or are mutually exclusive. Indeed, the fallacy of this\n\nargument is that it assumesthat this Court will be unable to act “judicially”; that we will be\n\nunableto perform “uniquely judicial” functions; that somehow we will be less “independent”\n\nor not as “apolitical”; and that we will fail the test of “impartiality” if we open our\n\nproceedings and deliberationsto the public, as the Constitution, Article II, Section 9, clearly\n\nrequires. Nonsense.\n\n       I cannot for a moment believe that the members of this Court will suddenly transform\n\ninto a bunch of political hacks, unable to render impartial, independent decisions--judicial\n\n\n                                               13\n\f                                        .   .

I        ,.\n\n\n\n\nor administrative--subject to the pressures of lobbying and paralyzed by an inability to\n\nentertain thoughtful discussions, if we open our decision-making processes to public\n\nscrutiny. In fact, if anything, the opposite is the more likely consequence. Like Justice\n\nTrieweiler, I can think of no better guarantee of impartiality, of prepared, thoughtful\n\ndiscussionand comment and ofjudicious decision-making than knowing that the collective\n\nprocessesand individual comments and opinions of this Court’s members will be subject to\n\nobservation and probing analysis and reporting by the media and careful examination by\n\ninterested members of the public. I can think of no better guarantee against litigants and\n\nattorneys lobbying the members of this Court (assuming arguendo that anyone would be\n\nunethical and, frankly, stupid enoughto do that) than their knowing that such efforts would\n\nmost likely headline the morning paper.\n\n       why, after all, did the framers include Article II, Section 9, in the Constihltion? The\n\nanswer is self-evident. Elected officials, government bureaucratsand public officers are less\n\nlikely to cut deals and comers if they have to operate in a fish bowl. Very simply, when\n\n public employees and officials--judges included--perform the public’s business, the public\n\n is entitled to observe and to understandhow they are going about it. More to the point, if,\n\n as Justice Leaphart argues, the judiciary is, by its very nature and as a distinct branch of\n\n government, already pure of purpose, intention and action, what conceivable harm would\n\n follow in simply letting the press and public observe that first-hand? If we’ve nothing to\n\n hide, then what need have we of secrecy? Is this Court incapableof complying with the right\n\n\n                                                    14\n\f   ,   .        4.\n                                                                                        ‘I,       .\n            ’        I     *\n                                            *.       .

We should all resign if we are that inept. Contrary to\n\nthe concurring Justice’s comments, open deliberations will not make this a less effective\n\nCourt; it will make us all better justices.\n\n           Likewise, I am similarly unpersuadedby Justice Leaphart’s reliance on the fact that\n\nother courts have determined that ‘Ijudicial deliberations are confidential.” Our obligation\n\nto open our deliberations is, as I have discussed at length above, required by Article II,\n\nSection 9, of the Montana Constitution. Justice Leaphart appears to concede that this\n\nprovision is broader than similar provisions in other states. That should end the discussion.\n\nThis Court is bound by this State’sConstitution not some other state’s or by common law\n\ntradition. Moreover, how many times has this Court announcedits determination to find its\n\nown unique path in the requirements of Montana’s own unique Constitution, proudly--nay,\n\n defiantly--“refusing to march lockstep” with other jurisdictions, state and federal? There is\n\n no good reason, much less a legal one, why we must suddenly fall in behind the parade on\n\n this issue either.\n\n           Finally, as to Justice Leaphart’s discussion of the reach of other provisions of\n\n Montana’s Constitution, I can only note that we have not determined the scope of those. I\n\n am not willing to offer any opinion at this time as to how those provisions might or might not\n\n be read. We have, however, and as pointed out above,unequivocally held that the language\n\n of Article II, Section 9, speaks for itself without reference to extrinsic aids, rules of\n\n\n                                                     15\n\f                                      .      .        .\n\nconstruction or resort to the history of the Constitutional Convention; that these provisions\n\napply to all persons and all public bodies of the state without exception; and that the\n\nmandates of Article II, Section 9 must be followed by each of the three branches of\n\ngovernment. AssociatedPress, 246 Mont. at 391-92,804 P.2d at 379. Either we meant what\n\nwe said, or, at the earliest opportunity, we should overrule these statements as meaningless,\n\nsanctimonious, claptrap.\n\n       In closing, I am satisfied that the person this Court has appointed is well-qualified to\n\nchair the reapportionment commission. Her vote will likely be crucial on many important\n\ndecisions to be made by the commission in the coming months. But, the names of other\n\nwell-qualified persons’were also placedbefore this Court for considerationand were, in fact,\n\nfairly considered. Had the process been open, the public would have been informed and\n\nwould have benefited from our discussionsand deliberations. Had we simply complied with\n\nArticle II, Section 9, the integrity of the entire appointment process would have been\n\nenhanced and verified. And, unfortunately, since we did not open our deliberations and\n\ndiscussions to the public, those who will now speculate and criticize our choice will find\n\nample fodder in the ignorance which is always bred of secrecy.\n\n        We, as a Court, had a unique chance--certainly one unprecedented in Montana and,\n\n\n\n\n        ’ Thoseinclude:E.

Sadly, we squanderedthis opportunity. In that I dissent.\n\n\n\n\n    Justice Terry N. Trieweiler concurs in the foregoing special concurrence and dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                                                17\n\f      Justice Terry N. Trieweiler specially concurs and dissents.\n\n      I likewise concur with this Court’s appointment of Dr. Janine Pease-PrettyOn Top\n\nto be the fifth member and chair of the reapportionment commission.\n\n      I also concur, however, with Justice Nelson’s dissent from the manner in which this\n\nCourt has made its decision.\n\n      JusticeNelson hasaccuratelyand capablyanalyzedthe constitutional requirement that\n\nthis Court’s deliberations be subject to public observation. I would simply like to add my\n\npersonalobservationregardingwhat I believe would be practical benefits from greater public\n\nscrutiny of this Court’s performance.\n\n       I have now served on this Court for eight and one-half years. During that service,\n\nthere have been times when I felt the Court did not function well as an institution. During\n\nthose times, greater public scrutiny would have led to constructive criticism and ultimate\n\nimprovement in the processby which this Court arrived at its decisions.\n\n       At other times, it has been my opinion that this Court has performed with unique\n\ndistinction. Public scrutiny at those times, would have enhancedpublic confidence in the\n\nCourt as an institution and the process by which many significant issues in this State have\n\nbeen decided.\n\n       I do not agree with those who suggest that the members of this Court could not\n\n function as candidly and effectively as they do now if the Court’s deliberationswere open to\n\n the public. While certainly over the course of eight and one-half years remarks have been\n\n\n                                             18\n\f madc   during   conf‘crcnce   which   wouldn't   have been made       with   reporters present,     no one can\n\n\nseriously contend that those remarks contributed anything of a positive nature to the decision\n\nmaking process.\n\n        Furthermore, it has always mystified me how this Court can continue to operate\n\nprivately in the face of an obvious constitutional mandate to the contrary on the basis that it\n\nis simply a more effective way to proceed, when at the same time the judiciary prohibits\n\nschool boards from discussing collective bargaining strategy privately (set Great Fulls\n\nTribune v. Great Falls Pz&. SC/Z.(1992), 255 Mont. 125, 841 P.2d 502); tells local\n\ngovernment that it cannot discusslitigation strategy privately (see The Associated Press I/.\n\nthe Bomd ofPub. Educ. (1991), 246 Mont. 386, 804 P.2d 376; and prohibits the legislative\n\ncaucusesfrom discussingpartisan strategy privately (see The Associated Press v.

Certainly, these public bodies felt strongly that these functions could be performed\n\nmore “effectively” without public scrutiny.\n\n        I concur with JusticeNelson’sconstitutional analysisof our obligation to conduct our\n\nbusiness publicly, and simply add that openness is not only constitutionally required, I\n\nbelieve it would lead to a consistently better product       and a judicial        institution     in which   the\n\n\npublic has greater confidence.\n\n\n                                                         e----\n                                                          MT&\n\n                                                         /         Y          Justice\n\n                                                    19\n\f                                                                                .        1,\n                                                                            ,       c\n                                         .’       ’\n                                              I\n\n\n\n\n      Justice Jim Regnier specially concurs.\n\n       1 enthusiastically concur in the Court’s appointment of Dr. Pretty On Top to this\n\nimportant position. I alsojoin my colleagues,\n                                            JusticesNelson and Trieweiler, in their strong\n\nbelief in open government. It is not only the right view, it is mandated by our Constitution.\n\nAs Justice Nelson correctly notes regarding Montana’s constitutional Right to Know, this\n\nCourt has been “vigilant and uncompromising in rejecting other governmental bodies’\n\nattempts to limit or subvert this right.” For the reasonsstatedbelow, however, I do not share\n\nthe dissenting view that Article II, Section 9 of Montana’s Constitution applies to the\n\ndeliberations of the Montana SupremeCourt.\n\n       At the outset, I think that it is important to appreciatethe context in which this matter\n\nis before us. This Court is exercisingits power of appointmentpursuant to Article V, Section\n\n14(2) of Montana’s Constitution and Title 5, Chapter 1 of the Montana Code Annotated.\n\nTheseprovisions provide that the Montana SupremeCourt shall appoint the fifth member of\n\nthe Montana Districting and Apportionment Commission in the event the Commission is\n\nunable to reach agreement on a fifth member. The issue addressedby the dissent, that is\n\nwhether the deliberations of the Montana Supreme Court regarding this appointment are\n\n subject to Article II, Section9, is not before us as a contestedissue. In the usual case,parties\n\n to a dispute tile briefs with this Court setting forth legal argumentsto support their respective\n\n positions. When we were informed that the Commission was unable to select a fifth\n\n member, we proceededto place this matter on our weekly agendain the samemanner as any\n\n\n                                                  20\n\f                                             .         ,\n\n\nother matter is addressedby this Court. No person or entity has filed an original action in\n\nthis Court contesting the manner in which we determined to proceed.\n\n         1 recognize that some may interpret my view that the deliberations of this Court are\n\nexempt from the provisions of Article II, Section 9, as disingenuous. Indeed, many may\n\ncriticize such a position when this Court has forced other public bodies to open up their\n\ndeliberations to public view and the necessary scrutiny that follows.         However, after\n\nreviewing the applicabletranscript of the Constitutional Convention, it seemsclear to me that\n\nthe Delegates never intended the provisions of Article II, Section 9 to apply to the\n\ndeliberationsof this Court. Furthermore, in my view, opening the conferences of this Court\n\nto the public would detract from, rather than improve, our ability to servethe citizens of this\n\nstate.\n\n         Any scrutiny of a constimtional provision must begin with an examination of the text\n\nin question. The dissent suggeststhat a plain reading of Article II, Section 9 leads one to the\n\ninescapable conclusion that the provision applies to the deliberation of judicial bodies, in\n\nparticular, the deliberations of this Court.          Therefore, under our accepted rules of\n\nconstruction, the dissent argues we should go no further in our analysis. From my reading\n\nof the provision, however, it is not clear that the phrase “deliberations of all public bodies”\n\n found in Article II, Section 9, includes the deliberations of the Montana Supreme Court.\n\n Since the adoption of our current Constitution, I am unaware of any actions filed in this\n\n Court or any district court in this state contending Montana’s constitutional Right to Know\n\n\n                                                 21\n\f                                            .\n\n\nincludesthe right to observethe deliberationsof this Court. The absenceof such a challenge\n\nsuggests to me that it is not clear and unambiguous that this provision applies to such\n\ndeliberations. As the dissent points out, Article II, Section 9 has been the subject of\n\nconsiderablelitigation as it appliesto various governmentalbodies. No litigation, however,\n\nhas ever alleged that the proceedings of this Court were in violation of the provision.\n\nAlthough we have defined “public body” in a variety of ways as contested cases were\n\npresentedto us, none of thesecasesinvolved the preciseissueaddressedhere, that is whether\n\nthis Court is considered a “public body” for the purposes of Article II, Section 9.\n\n        A review of the transcript of the Montana Constitutional Convention of 1972 is\n\nhelpful in analyzing this important question. Justice Nelson correctly points out that the\n\nDelegates to the Constitutional Convention specifically amended the language of what\n\nbecameArticle II, Section 8 of the Montana Constitution which gives the public the right to\n\nparticipate in the operations of governmental agencies.\n\n       Article II, Section 8 of Montana’s Constitution provides:\n\n       Right of participation. The public has the right to expect governmental\n       agenciesto afford such reasonableopportunity for citizen participation in the\n       operation of the agenciesprior to final decision as may be provided by law.\n\nThe relevant transcript relating to Section 8 disclosesthat DelegateBerg was concernedthat\n\n an earlier draft which used the word “government” rather than “governmental agencies”\n\n might reasonablybe interpreted to include the judiciary which unquestionably is a branch of\n\n the government. Delegate Berg pointed out that this provision could be interpreted to mean\n\n\n                                                22\n\fthat the public would not only have the right to observetrials and other judicial proceedings,\n\nbut would also have the right, in some fashion, to participate in the judicial process such as\n\npreparing jury instructions or providing input to the court in the preparation of the court’s\n\norders. Delegate McNeil had a similar concern that the provision might be interpreted as\n\nproviding the public the right to actually participate by way of vote in the legislature or the\n\nMontana Supreme Court. Addressing these concerns, the text was ultimately amended by\n\nsubstituting the term “governmental agencies” for “government.”                See Montana\n\nConstitutional Convention, Verbatim Transcript, March 7, 1972, pp. 1663-67.\n\n       The dissent posits that Delegate Berg’s proposed amendment to Section 8, and its\n\nacceptance the Delegates,shedslight on the ultimate breadth and meaning of Section 9.\n          by\n\nDelegate Berg also moved to amend the language of what becameArticle II, Section 9 out\n\n of concern that the phrase “public bodies” might be interpretedto include juries, grandjuries,\n\n or the deliberations of this Court. Delegate Dahood, Chairman of the Bill of Rights\n\n Committee, responded:\n\n        And.I think the interpretation that he has given could possibly be laid against\n        this section, but I am very reluctant to rise in opposition to Delegate Berg on\n        this issuebecauseI’m certainly in accord with everything that he says, except\n        I’m not satisjied in my mind andjudgment that a court could conceivably give\n        that interpretation to ‘bodies”. We are referring there to public bodies;\n        perhaps city councils,perhaps some bureaucratic groups or some bureau that\n        may have beenestablishedperhapsfor someparticular specialpublic purpose\n               I think our commentsclearly indicate that we are not trying to upset any\n         traditional rule ofprocedure with respect to anything within the judiciary.\n\n\n\n\n                                               23\n\f(Emphasisadded.) See Montana Constitutional Convention, Verbatim Transcript, March 16,\n\n1972, at 2499-500.\n\n       From the actions of the Delegatesrelating to Delegate Berg’s proposed amendments\n\nto Sections 8 and 9 of Article II, the dissent reasons that since the Delegates accepted\n\nDelegate Berg’s argument and amendedArticle II, Section 8, but refused to amend Article\n\nII, Section 9 wher Delegate Berg made a similar suggestion, the conclusion is that the\n\nDelegates intended that Article II, Section 9 be broader in scopethan Section 8.\n\n       My review of the transcript indicates that there were logical reasons to support the\n\nDelegates’ action of voting in favor of Delegate Berg’s proposed amendment to Section 8,\n\nwhile rejecting his proposedamendmentto Section9. There is no questionthat a preliminary\n\ndraft of Section 8 which used the term “government” might very legitimately have been\n\ninterpreted to include the judiciary, which unquestionably is a branch of the government.\n\nThus, it is clear to me that the Delegates felt that Delegate Berg’s concerns about Section 8\n\nwere justified.\n\n       Notwithstanding their vote on the Section 8 amendment,my reading of the transcript\n\ndiscloses that the Delegates did not intend that Article II, Section 9 should apply to\n\ndeliberations of this Court, juries or grand juries. In fact, very little discussion took place\n\nafter Delegate Dahood, a lawyer, seemedto convince the Delegates that no “court could\n\nconceivably give that interpretation to ‘bodies’     [and that] our comments clearly indicate\n\nthat we are not trying to upset any traditional rule of procedure with respect to anything with\n\n\n                                              24\n\f                                             .        .\n\n\nthe judiciary.”   My interpretation of this dialogue at the Convention is that the Delegates\n\nwere apparently persuaded that Delegate Berg’s proposed amendment to Section 9 was\n\nunnecessary. 1 seenothing in the transcript to suggestthat the framers ever intended that\n\nArticle II, Section 9 be interpreted as the dissent suggests.\n\n       The reasoningof Delegate Dahood was sound at the Convention and is sound today.\n\nIf we were to conclude that Article II, Section 9 applies to the deliberations of the Montana\n\nSupremeCourt, the judicial processof this institution, aswe know it, would be significantly\n\ndifferent and, in my view, compromised. It is not uncommon for this Court to deliberate on\n\na particular casefor months, even after the briefing is completed and oral argument has been\n\nconducted. During this time additionalresearchis pursued,the transcript of the proceedings\n\nbelow is reviewed by the Justices, and proposed opinions and dissents are circulated and\n\ndiscussed during Court conferences. Preliminary votes quite often change as the case\n\nprogressesto a final written opinion. If the public, which of course includes the parties to\n\nthe litigation, were able to observethese deliberations, there is no question in my mind that\n\nthe parties would act in anticipation of the Court’s decision. The opinion ultimately handed\n\ndown by this Court, in many instances,may be entirely different than the parties’ prediction.\n\nI don’t believe such a processwould benefit anyone.\n\n        My other major concern is that the judicial process itself would be detrimentally\n\nimpacted by the public attention that would no doubt be directed to the Court as it deliberates\n\nover cases. Efforts to lobby the Court both directly and indirectly would inevitably occur\n\n\n                                                 25\n\fespecially in high profile or controversial matters. Unlike the legislative process, where\n\ncontinuousinteraction with the citizenry is desirable,\n                                                     judicial decision making functions best\n\nin an environment where such influences are avoided. Soundjudicial decisionsare made by\n\nreflecting on principles of law, hopefully unswayedby public opinion. In fact, many judicial\n\ndecisions are unpopular, as members of this Court are acutely aware. However, the\n\nunpopular decision is more often than not the legally correct one. I believe our ability to\n\nfunction in such a fashion would be significantly jeopardized by open conferences.\n\n       Finally, under the analysis of the dissent, one might logically suggestthat the entire\n\njury deliberation processwould necessarily also be open to the public. It is hard for me to\n\nimagine how such a jury system could function. Ordinary citizens who are called to jury\n\nduty are the true heroesin our system ofjustice. Jurors make difficult decisions that affect\n\nthe very liberty and property of the persons involved in the litigation. The time-honored\n\ntradition in this country has always been that no one, not the lawyers, the judge, the media,\n\nor anyone, is allowed to observe, participate or invade jury deliberations. Imagine, for\n\ninstance,the spectacleof a criminal jury sitting in judgment of an accusedwho is present in\n\nthe jury room during deliberations.\n\n       JusticeNelson points out that even if one concedesthat the Right to Know provisions\n\n do not apply to judicial deliberations, our function in making this appointment to the\n\n Montana Districting andApportionment Commission was purely administrative in nature and\n\n most certainly subject to the provisions of Article II, Section 9. This Court is involved in\n\n\n                                              26\n\f                                             .    ‘1   .\n\n\n\n\nmany functions which are not technically judicial, such as adopting rules governing the\n\nprocedure of the Court and making appointmentsto various commissions of the Court, only\n\nto name a few. I think it would be an unwieldy process if we were to attempt to segregate\n\nout our judicial functions from administrative ones for the purpose of Article II, Section 9.\n\nMy interpretation of Delegate Dahood’s comments that “we are not trying to upset any\n\ntraditional rule of procedure with respect to anything within the judiciary” applies to our\n\nadministrative functions as well.\n\n       In my view, Article II, Section 9, commonly referred to as Montana’s constitutional\n\nRight to Know provision, does not and was never intended to apply to deliberations of the\n\nMontana Supreme Court.\n\n\n\n\n        Chief Justice J. A. Tumage, JusticeW.                   , and Justice Karla M. Gray\njoin in the foregoing specially concurring opinion of Justice Jim Regnier.\n\n\n\n\n                                                              / h++e-v-\n                                                                Justice\n\n\n\n\n                                                                 Jus ‘ce\n\n                                                 27\n\f                    0\nJustice W. William Leaphart, specially con&rmg.,\n\n\n       I find myself in the anomalousposition of replying to a dissent in a matter in which\n\nthere is no opinion by the Court and no adverseparties who have tiled briefs and framed the\n\nissues. Despite this unusual posture, the dissenters have sua sponte raised some very\n\nprofound issues about the deliberative process of judges and juries in light of the\n\nconstitutional right to know andI take this opportunity to expressmy disagreementwith their\n\ninterpretation of our constitutional guarantees.\n\n       The dissent argues that all deliberations of this Court should be open to the public\n\nunder the right to know provision of the Montana Constitution.’ In particular, JusticeNelson\n\n contendsthat our appointment of a fifth commissioner to the reapportionment commission\n\n is, like the hiring or firing of a court employee,an administrative matter that should be open\n\n to the public. As I will elaborate below, I disagreethat our deliberations are subject to the\n\n right to know provision. Furthermore, I do not agree that our constitutional obligation to\n\n appoint a commissioner is, asthe dissent argues,a mere administrative matter like the hiring\n\n or firing of a court employee.\n\n        Whether this Court’s appointment of a fifth member of the reapportionment\n\n commission is a judicial action should turn on whether that action is judicial in the sensethat\n\n  it is unique to this Court. Is the action of a distinctive nature that no other governmental\n\n\n\n         ’ For convenienceI have denoted Justice Nelson’s special concurrence and dissent\n  as “the dissent,” becauseJustice Trieweiler, in his special concurrence and dissent, states\n  that he is in agreement with Justice Nelson’s constitutional analysis of the right to know\n  provision.\n\n                                                28\n\fentity can perform?\n\n      I submit that the answer to the inquiry is readily apparent: Montana’s Constitution\n\nexpresslyprovides that when the legislative appointeescannot agree on the appointment of\n\na fifth member to the reapportionment commission, “a major@ of the supreme court shall\n\nselect&n.” Art. V, Sec. 14(2), Mont. Const. (emphasisadded). The Constitution mandates\n\nthat this Court and no other entity perform the appointment task.\n\n       Although we could end the inquiry here, I note that the Constitutional Convention\n\nhistory shows that the framers intended that this Court’s appointment of fifth commission\n\nmembers embody the institutional characteristicsthat uniquely distinguish the judiciary. The\n\nMontana Constitutional Convention Comments provide:\n\n       The committee considers reapportionment and redistricting to be a\n       troublesome and time consuming matter for a legislative body becauseof the\n       legislature’s difficulty in being objective. . . The committee recognized that\n       redistricting and reapportionmenthas political repercussions,so the proposed\n       section provides for bipartisanism in the method of selection of the first four\n       members. The fifth member of the commission becomesthe key vote and his\n       selection by the other four members is to insure impartiality.\n\nI Montana Constitutional Convention, Comments, p. 393.              Thus, the Constitutional\n\nConvention framers’ commentsmake clear that in the eventthat legislative appointeescannot\n\nagree on a fifth member for the commission, our Constitution’s framers intended that an\n\n apolitical, independent entity make the appointment: Montana’s Supreme Court.\n\n        It strains credulity to supposethat the framers intended that this Court make such\n\n appointments without observing the very judicial traditions that enable it to operate as an\n\n\n                                             29\n\f    apolitical and independentbranch of government. As Montana SupremeCourt justices who\n\n    are constitutionally required to make this appointment when the partisan legislative\n\n    appointeescannot agreeamong themselves,I submit that we act in our judicial capacity and\n\n    not as mere administrators.\n\n          Turning then to the broader question of whether our deliberations of judicial matters\n\n    are subject to the right to know provision, I am not aware of any appellate court that allows\n\n    the public to observe its deliberations. I am also not aware of any other state that has a\n\n    similarly broad constitutional right to know provision. ’ However, other state courts have\nI\n    expressly affirmed the common-law tradition ofprivate judicial deliberations. For example,\n\n    in In Re Inquiry Concerning a Judge, Gridley (Fla. 1982), 417 So.2d 950, 955, the court\n\n    observedthat “judicial deliberations are confidential.” In People v. Mallory (Mich. 1967)\n\n    147N.W.2d 66 (Souris, J. concurring), a judge offered a cogent discussionof that common-\n\n\n            2 Other states’constitutional right to know or observeprovisions are expressly\n    limited. Article XI, Section 5 of North Dakota’s constitution provides that “‘[u]nZess\n    otherwise provided by law, all meetings of public or governmental bodies, boards,\n    bureaus, commissions, or agenciesof the state or any political subdivision of the state, or\n     organizations or agenciessupported in whole or in part by public funds, or expending\n    public funds, shall be open to the public.” Art. XI, Sec. 5, N.D. Const. (emphasis added).\n     Similarly, Article XII, Section 3 of Louisiana’s constitution provides that “[n]o person\n     shall be denied the right to observe the deliberations of public bodies and examine public\n     documents, except in casesestablished by law. Art. XII, Sec. 3, La. Const. (emphasis\n     added). Part one, Article 8 of the New Hampshire constitution provides that “[a]11power\n     residing originally in, and being derived from, the people, all the magistrates and officers\n     of government are their substitutes and agents, and at all times accountableto them.\n     Government, therefore, should be open, accessible,accountable, and responsive. To that\n     end, the public’s right of accessto governmental proceedings and records shall not be\n     unreasonably restricted.” Pt. one, Art. 8, N.H. Const. (emphasis added).\n\n                                                  30\n\f                                                                                                .\n                                                                            .   I,   *\n\n\n\n\nlaw tradition:\n\n       It has been my understanding that views expressedby judges of an appellate\n       court while deliberating upon their decisionsare confidential until they appear\n       in an opinion, if they ever do, over the signature of the author. Such privacy\n       permits judges to discuss freely among themselves all issues involved in a\n       case, to advancetentative views for the sometimes enlightening reactions of\n       wiser colleaguesand to criticize candidly and sometimes bluntly the notions\n       offered by other colleagues, all without fear of subsequentembarrassment to\n        any member of the Court by public disclosure of anything said or written\n       which does not survive the ordeal as a subscribed formal opinion. In my\n       judgment such freedom of expressionin camera should be encouragedamong\n        Justiceswhose duty it is to strive, at least, to reach majority accord when that\n        can be achievedwithout compromise of legal principles.\n\nMallory,     147 N.W.2d at 74.\n\n           Federal courts have also affirmed the confidentiality of judicial deliberations,\n\nrecognizing that candiddeliberations areessentialto an independentjudiciary and suggesting\n\nthat there is a judicial privilege. In United Statesv. Nixon (1974), 418 U.S. 683,94 S.Ct.\n\n 3090,41 L.Ed.2d 1039, the Court recognized that\n\n           [h]uman experience teaches that those who expect public dissemination of\n           their remarks may well temper candor with a concern for appearancesand for\n           their own interests to the detriment of the decisiomnakingprocess. Whatever\n           the nature of the privilege of confidentiality of Presidential communications\n           in the exercise of Art. II powers, the privilege can be said to derive from the\n           supremacyof eachbranch within its own assignedareaof constitutional duties.\n           Certain powers and privileges flow from the nature of enumerated powers.\n\n Niuon, 418 U.S. at 705,94 S.Ct. at 3106,41 L.Ed.2d at 1062. The Nixon Court concluded\n\n that “[t]he expectation of a President to the confidentiality of his conversations and\n\n correspondence,like the claim of confidentiality ofjudicial deliberations, for example, has\n\n all the values to which we accord deferencefor the privacy of all citizens.” Nixon, 418 U.S.\n\n                                                 31\n\f   ,   ,,‘s\n\n\n               ‘/   .      *                ,.”\n\n\n\n\nat 708,94 S.Ct. at 3107,41 L.Ed.2d at 1063-64(emphasisadded). The Eleventh Circuit has\n\nrecognized a judicial privilege in confidential judicial communications. See Matter of\n\nCertain Complaints Under Investigation (1 lth Cir. 1986), 783 F.2d 1488, 1520 (concluding\n\n“there exists a privilege . protecting confidential communications among judges and their\n\nstaffs in the performance of their judicial duties. . . In the main, the privilege can extend\n\nonly to communications amongjudges and others relating to official judicial business”).\n\n         In two fundamental respects I disagree with the dissent. First, when Montana’s\n\nconstitutional right to know provision (hereafter, right to know provision) is read with regard\n\nto established canons of construction and to the interdependent structure of Montana’s\n\nConstitution, it is clear that judicial deliberations fall well outside the scope of the public’s\n\nright to know. Second, to treat Montana’s judiciary as a “public body” would do real\n\nviolence to the Montana Constitution’s requirement of an independentjudiciary that serves\n\nas a distinct branch of government.\n\n              It should be apparent that the meaning of “public bodies” is ambiguous: if nothing\n\n else, the long arduous procession of decisions cited by the dissent evinces the patent\n\n ambiguity of that phrase. NOTare those casesin agreement about the meaning of the right\n\n to know provision’s recognition of public bodies and agenciesof state government. FOT\n\n example, in SJL of Montana Assoc. v. City of Billings (1993), 263 Mont. 142, 867 P.2d\n\n 1084, the Court examined the constitutional history of the right to know provision for\n\n guidance in determining the elusive statutory meaning of “agency” under Montana’s open\n\n\n                                                   32\n\f                                                                         ,   ,,   .\n\n\n\nmeeting laws and concluded:\n\n       The following remarks exemplify the thrust of the debate on “governmental\n       agencies”: DELEGATE DaHOOD: . . Once again, I want to point out, we\n       have in mind the governmental agenciesthat are miniature legislatures who\n       put together rules and regulations that affect us all.\n\n       DELEGATE MCNEIL: . . I think . . [governmental agencies] is what the\n       committee intended to reach with this, and that is appointive commissions,\n       bureaus, so forth.\n\nSIL, 263 Mont. at 148, 867 P.2d at 1087-88. The SJL Court concluded that “[i]t is obvious\n\nfrom these and other remarks that the framers of the Constitution were concerned with\n\ngovernmental entities which had rule-making authority and regulatory powers.” SJL, 263\n\nMont. at 149, 867 P.2d at 1088. However, in a dissentingopinion, Justice Trieweiler argued\n\nthat “[t]he majority opinion ignores the plain language of Article II, Section 9, Montana\n\nConstitution. . . . What was prohibited fey a previous decision of the Court] is exactly what\n\nwas done in this case.” SJL, 263 Mont. at 150-51, 867 P.2d at 1089 (Trieweiler, J.\n\n dissenting). I raise SJL not to argue the merits of that decision but rather to show that the\n\n meaning of the phrase, “public bodies or agencies, is hardly plain and unambiguous.\n                                                  ”\n\n        Moreover, it is an established rule of construction that words in a statute or\n\n constitution not be treated as mere surplusage;we presume that each word has a particular\n\n and intended significance. However, the dissent urges that this Court is simply “a group of\n\n individuals organized by and under the Montana Constitution for a governmental purpose”\n\n and that the Court is a “public body” under the right to know provision. Thus, under the\n\n dissent’s construction, a “public body” is the substantive equivalent of a branch of\n\n                                               33\n\fgovernment. The dissenthas therefore renderedArticle III, Sectionl’s recognition of distinct\n\nbranchesof government mere surplusage. SeeArt. III, Sec. 1, Mont. Const. (providing that\n\n“[t]he power of the government of this state is divided into three distinct branches”)\n\n(emphasis added). I do not agree that the Montana Constitution’s separation of powers\n\nprovision can be so easily dismissed.\n\n       Yet another establishedrule of construction is that when statutory or constitutional\n\nlanguage is ambiguous, a court may consider the intent of its drafters. The Montana\n\nConstitutional Convention Comments to the right to know provision provide in part that it\n\nis a companion to the right of participation and that\n\n       Both arise out of the increasing concern of citizens and commentators alike\n       that government’ssheerbignessthreatensthe effective exercise of citizenship.\n         . . The provision stipulates that persons have the rights to examine\n       governmentaldocumentsand the deliberationsof all public bodies or agencies\n       except to the extent that the demandsof individual privacy outweigh the needs\n       of the public right of disclosure. . . . The committee intends by this provision\n       that the deliberation and resolution of all public matters must be subject to\n       public scrutiny.\n\n II Montana Constitutional Convention, Comments, p. 631 (emphasis added).                 This\n\n constitutional history establishesthat the delegateswere concerned with the dangers of a\n\n large complex government that could secretly undertake actions that affect the public.\n\n        However, the Constitutional Convention Delegates’ legitimate concerns about the\n\n dangersof a secretive large government simply do not implicate the judiciary. The judiciary\n\n is perhapsunique among Montana’s three branches of government in that it cannot secretly\n\n take actions that affect the public. Montana’s Constitution expressly requires that “[a]\n\n                                              34\n\f    ,   ,,‘,\n\n\n               ~,      ,                           ,   0    ,                   ,   I.\n\n\n\n\nmajority [of the Supreme Court] shall join in and pronounce decisions, which must be in\n\nwriting.”           Art. VII, Sec. 3, Mont.   Const. The decisions of Montana’s Supreme Court are\n\npublic, open to public scrutiny, and subject to challenge. Further, Montana Supreme Court\n\njustices are individually accountablefor their decisions.\n\n         Although the dissentdisregardsthe structure of the right to know provision, a cogent\n\nlogical structure underlies and organizesthe right to know provision’s requirement that the\n\ndeliberations of all public bodies be open unless “the demand of individual privacy clearly\n\nexceedsthe merits of public disclosure.” Art. II, Sec. 9, Mont. Const. The structure of the\n\nright to know provision presupposes an independententity will balance individual rights\n                                   that\n\nto privacy with the merits of public disclosure.\n\n          Montana’s Constitutional Convention Delegates explicitly presumed that Montana’s\n\njudiciary would be the entity that balancesinterestsin privacy and public disclosure. During\n\ndiscussionofthe right to know provision, Convention DelegateCate proposedan amendment\n\nthat would allow the legislatureto “set the situations in which individual privacy exceedsthe\n\nmerits of public disclosure.” V Montana Constitutional Convention, Verbatim Transcript\n\n (hereafter, transcript), p. 1671. Arguing in opposition to Delegate Cate’s proposed\n\n amendment,Delegate Foster responded“Now, it was the thinking of the committee that, in\n\n fact, the courts would have to strike the balancebetween the merits of public disclosure and\n\n the merits of privacy, and our committee had faith in our courts to strike this balance. And\n\n we did not feel that this particular provision should be left to the Legislature to interpret.”\n\n\n                                                           35\n\fSee transcript at 1672. Even the delegates who voiced support for Delegate Cate’s\n\namendmentrecognized that the judiciary would balanceindividual privacy with the merits\n\nof public disclosure. For example, Delegate Loendorf expressedapprehensionthat if an\n\nagency barred his attending a public meeting on the grounds that his attendance would\n\nviolate the privacy of an individual, he would “have to go to court and attempt to get an order\n\nallowing [him] to attend.” See transcript at 1674. Arguing as well for Delegate Cate’s\n\nproposedamendment,DelegateBrown cautionedthat he could seewhere “this [right to know\n\nprovision] would be abusedby a County Commissioner, a Governor, other state officials,\n\nusing this exception in our present Constitution to deny accessto public documents. As a\n\nresult, you’d have to go to court and end up ultimately with the Supreme Court.”           See\n\ntranscript at 1677. Delegate Cate’s amendment was defeated.\n\n       Our Constitutional Convention history clearly establishes that the Constitutional\n\nDelegates intended that Montana’sjudiciary balance individual privacy and the merits of\n\npublic disclosure. 1 conclude that to construeMontana’sjudiciary as a “public body” would\n\ngive an unconstitutional effect to the right to know provision. If this Court ruled that its\n\n conferences were open to the public, the Court would violate the constitutional mandate,\n\n which is clearly established by the structure of the right to know provision and by its\n\n constitutional history, that this Court balance individual needsfor privacy with the merits of\n\n public disclosure. Again, in determining that the judiciary must balance those interests, the\n\n Constitutional Delegates recognized that the Court was no “public body” but rather was a\n\n\n                                               36\n\f                                                                                          .   #,   .\n\n\n\n\ndistinct branch of government.\n\n      I emphasizethat the dissenthas investedthe right to know provision with an absolute\n\nreach. Under the dissent’s interpretation, “public bodies” describe any group of people\n\norganized for a governmental purpose. If other parts of Montana’s Constitution were also\n\ninterpreted without regard for and independent of the structure of Montana’s Constitution,\n\nwe would have surprising results. Consider, for example, Article II, Section 12, which\n\nprovides in part that the right to bear arms “in defense of [one’s] own home, person, and\n\nproperty      shall not be called in question.” Art. II, Sec. 12, Mont. Const. (emphasis\n\nadded). If that constitutional provision were accorded an absolute reach, the phrase “shall\n\nnot be called in question” would enableindividuals to openly carry firearms in any situation\n\nor setting.j Defendants on trial for murder could insist upon the right to brandish firearms\n\nduring their trials. Consider, too, Article II, Section 13, which provides that “[a]11 elections\n\nshall be free and open, and no power, civil or military, shall at any time interfere to prevent\n\nthe i?eeexerciseof the right of suffrage.” Art. II, Sec. 13, Mont. Const. (emphasis added).\n\nIndividuals could read the phrase “shall [not] at any time interfere” to provide that they are\n\n free to vote whenever their consciencesdictate, in November or in August, and at any time\n\n of the day or night. I submit that Montana’s Constitution must be construed as a coherent\n\n integrated structure and that divesting phrasessuch as “public bodies” from their structured\n\n context also divests them of their intended and appropriate meanings.\n\n\n        3I recognize that this provision does not allow the carrying of concealed weapons.\n\n                                               31\n\f      Finally, the right to know provision upon which the dissentrelies in arguing for open\n\nconferences guaranteesnot only the right to “observe the deliberations of all public bodies\n\nor agenciesof state government” but also the right to “examine documents” of such public\n\nbodies. Art. II, Sec. 9, Mont. Const. If, as the dissent argues, the courts of this State are\n\nconsideredpublic bodies or agencies,then all internal working papers of the courts should\n\nbe subject to public examination. Thus, when a justice of this Court prepares a proposed\n\nopinion in a matter before the Court, that proposed opinion (historically circulated only to\n\nother justices) would have to be made available to the public. If the proposed opinion\n\npertainedto a matter of public concern,members of the public and interest groups would be\n\ninspired to support or oppose the proposed opinion by writing letters to the justices, by\n\nconducting a media blitz, or by appearing en masse at the court conference where the\n\nproposed opinion is to be discussed. Perhapsmore importantly, when parties to an appeal\n\nread such a proposed opinion, they will have seenthe proverbial “writing on the wall” and\n\nbe inclined to settle the case or take evasive action based on the views expressed in the\n\nproposed opinion, ignoring the fact that the votes could changein subsequentconferences\n\nwhen the proposed opinion is discussed. A defendant facing serious criminal charges who\n\nsees an adversepreliminary vote or proposed opinion may well jump bail or worse, again\n\nignoring the fact that a preliminary vote or opinion might not accurately reflect the final\n\npublished decision.\n\n       In contendingthat subjecting our decision making processto probing analysis by the\n\n\n                                              38\n\f                                                                                             >,       .\n                                                                                         ’        .\n\n\n\n\nnews media and to searchingexaminationby the public would benefit this Court, the dissent\n\nhas misconstrued the nature of judicial decision making and advanced the notion of an\n\nindependentyet receptive-to-public-opinionjudiciary that cannot withstand serious scrutiny.\n\nThis Court’s decisions already receive probing analysis by the media and searching\n\nexamination by the public. Every decision of this Court is published and available to the\n\npublic. Thus, there is a disingenuouscharacter to the dissent’s argument that this Court’s\n\nopinions will benefit from public scrutiny, becausethat public scrutiny occurs with every\n\ndecision of this Court. The real questionthen is not whether public scrutiny will benefit this\n\nCourt: as a matter of judicial tradition, public scrutiny attends every judicial decision.\n\nRather, the real question is whether public scrutiny of this Court’s private deliberations is\n\nappropriate. For all the reasonsthat I discuss elsewhere in this concurring opinion, I am\n\nconvinced that openingjudicial deliberationsto the public would damagethe independence\n\nof this Court as a separatebranch of government. Further, I believe that the dissent has\n\nembraced a rose-colored conception ofjudges that belies human reality. It cannot be true\n\nthat justices will be positively influenced by opening our deliberationsto the public yet also\n\nbe true that justices, as elected officials, will never be negatively influenced by inevitable\n\n pressures to make decisions based on political considerations rather than legal principles.\n\n 1 emphasizethat as a Court, we already receive the benefit of public scrutiny. There being\n\n no further benefit that we can anticipate, it would be senseless invite probing analysis of\n                                                                 to\n\n our deliberations by the news media and by concerned members of the public in the\n\n\n                                               39\n\fexpectation that we will, if we humanly can, turn a deaf ear to those analyses when\n\nconsidering proposed opinions and preliminary votes on pressing social issues. Were I a\n\nlitigant advocating an unpopular legal position, I would not want to advancemy cause in\n\nsuch an atmosphere.\n\n       In my view, the framers of our Constitution did not envision the deliberations of\n\njudges being made in such a politically charged environment. Furthermore, the framers\n\nwould not have chosento abandonthe centuries-old common-law tradition of confidential\n\njudicial deliberations without even five minutes of discussion to suggest that they intended\n\nsuch a momentous changein judicial decision making. In responding to concerns that the\n\nright to know provision might be interpreted to include juries, grand juries, and the\n\ndeliberations of the Supreme Court, Delegate Dahood opined that no “court could\n\nconceivably give that interpretation to ‘bodies.’ ” VII Montana Constitutional Convention,\n\nVerbatim Transcript, pp. 2499-2500. I agree with Justice Regnier that the absenceof any\n\nfarther discussion on this point indicates that the delegateswere persuaded by Delegate\n\nDahood’scomments and that they did not intend to take the unprecedented step of opening\n\njury and court deliberationsto the public. Although Justice Nelson eschewsthe suggestion\n\nthat his application of the right to know, without exception, necessarily extends to the\n\n opening ofjury deliberations, the fact is that juries clearly fit his definition of a public body\n\n subject to the right to know, in other words, a “group of individuals organized for a\n\n governmental purpose.”\n\n\n                                                40\n\f      To sum up, I do not believe that this or any other court may strip itself of the privacy\n\nof its judicial deliberations yet serve as an effective, independent and distinct branch of\n\ngovernment.    The common-law tradition of private judicial conferences reflects this\n\nfundamental truth. Openingjudicial conferencesto public observationwould thwart fruitful\n\ncandid discussion of issues; exposejustices to political pressures;and encourageparties to\n\nact upon conference votes and proposed opinions that often differ from final published\n\njudicial decisions. Moreover, establishedcanonsofjudicial construction, the interdependent\n\nstructure of Montana’sConstitution, andMontana’sConstitutional Convention history all lead\n\nto the conclusion that judicial deliberations fall outside the scope of the public’s right to\n\nknow. Contrary to the dissent, I am persuadedthat this conclusion strengthens the right to\n\nknow provision and its express concern for individual privacy interests.               As the\n\nConstitutional Delegates wisely acknowledged, an independentjudiciary is necessary to\n\nbalance interests in privacy and public disclosure.\n\n\n\n\n Chief Justice J. A.

I strongly dissent,\n\nhowever, from the manner in which we have exercised our power of appointment under\n\nArticle V, Section 14(2) of the Montana Constitution. This entire process of appointment,\n\nincluding all of this Court’s deliberationson this matter, should have been open to the public.\n\n       In this regard, and as pointed out by the specially concmring Justices,my dtssent does\n\nnot arise from a ruling by this Court in responseto an original proceeding or suit to open to\n\nthe public our deliberations on this matter. Rather, the genesisof my disagreement is the\n\n5-2 rejection of my motion, made before we began our discussionson this appointment, that\n\nwe conduct our deliberations and make our decision on this particular matter in open\n\nsessions. As noted, the more conventional route for raising this issue would have been an\n\nadversary proceeding filed in or against this Court. Notwithstanding, in the twenty-seven\n\nyears since the adoption of the 1972Constitution, no one has seenfit to file such a challenge.\n\nWhy, I do not know, but I suspectthat the reason for this failure goes more to the politics of\n\nnot wanting to go head-to-head with the highest court in this State on a controversial issue\n\ndirectly affecting the fundamental way we conduct our business,rather than it does with the\n\nmerits of the constitutional arguments for and against.\n\n       More to the point, however, how this issue was raised is of little consequence.The\n\n\n                                               2\n\f;-~\nI     fact of the matter is that no one and no organization should have to sue us or even request\nI\n      that we conform our own operations to the clear and unambiguous mandate of the\n\n      Constitution.

Rather, Montana’s constitutional “right to know” unambiguously covers the\n\ndeliberations ofallpublic   bodies of state government.\n\n       Nonetheless,even ignoring the clarity of Article II, Section 9, and the dictates of our\n\nconstitutional construction jurisprudence, the proceedings of the 1972 Constitutional\n\nConvention also lead to the conclusion that the “right to know” requirements do not apply\n\nexclusively to the legislative and executive branchesof state government and its subdivisions\n\nto the exclusion of the judicial branch.\n\n       In point of fact, the delegatesto the Constitutional Convention amendedthe language\n\nof what becameArticle II, Section 8 of the Montana Constitution, which gives the public the\n\nright to participate in the operations of governmental agencies, on Delegate Berg’s motion,\n\nso as to exclude the judicial branch. See Montana Constitutional Convention, Verbatim\n\nTranscript, March 7,1972, pp. 1663-67(comments ofDelegates Berg, Dahood, and McNeil).\n\nNotwithstanding that these same delegates discussedthe language of what became Article\n\n\n                                              4\n\fII,   Section 9 of the Montana Constitution on the same afternoon that they amended the\n\nlanguage of what became Article II, Section 8, they did not even discuss amending the\n\nlanguage of what became Article II, Section 9, so as to exclude the judicial branch. See\n\nMontana Constitutional Convention, Verbatim Transcript, March 7, 1972, pp. 1667-1680.\n\n         Delegate Berg, however, subsequentlymoved to amend the languageof what became\n\nArticle II, Section 9, out of his concern that the phrase “public bodies” could be interpreted\n\nto include juries, grand juries, or the deliberations of this Court. Montana Constitutional\n\nConvention, Verbatim Transcript, March 16, 1972, pp. 2499-2501. Delegate Dahood stated\n\nthat he agreed with Delegate Berg and that the committee was “not trying to upset any\n\ntraditional rule of procedure with respectto anything within thejudiciary.” Notwithstanding,\n\nDelegate Dahood statedthat he would not amendthe section as Delegate Berg had suggested.\n\nDelegate Berg then stated in his closing statement in support of his motion that “my purpose\n\nin asking to delete the word[s] ‘bodies or’ is to eliminate the potential interpretation that it\n\nmight include juries, grand juries, [or] Supreme Court deliberations.”                Montana\n\nConstitutional Convention, Verbatim Transcript, March 16, 1972, p. 2501. Despite Delegate\n\nBerg’s concerns, his motion failed.        Montana Constitutional Convention, Verbatim\n\nTranscript, March 16, 1972, p. 2501.\n\n         Thus, even though Delegate Berg expressedthe same concern with regard to what\n\nbecame Article II, Section 8, and what became Article II, Section 9, the delegatesamended\n\nonly the languageof what becameArticle II, Section 8, so as to exclude the judicial branch.\n\n\n                                               5\n\f                                    __..~   ~~_--   ~.~ __._,~~.~.~~,..~. _. ~,~~~~\n\nMore to the point, the delegatesdeclined to amend the language of what became Article II,\n\nSection 9, so as to exclude the judicial branch even though faced with the sameconcern that\n\nprompted them to amend what becameArticle II, Section 8.\n\n       Hence, not only the plain language but also the constitutional history of these\n\ncompanion provisions of the Montana Constitution show that Article II, Section 9, is broader\n\nthan Article II, Section 8. Article II, Section 9, gives the public the right to observe the\n\ndeliberations of allpublic bodies and agencieswhile Article II, Section 8, gives the public\n\nthe right topnvticipnte only in the operationsof agencies. That, of course, begs the question\n\nwhether this Court is a “public body.” The answer to this question is undeniably “yes.”\n\n       In Common Cause v. Statutory Committee (1994), 263 Mont. 324,329, 868 P.2d GO4,\n\n607, we noted that the rights which Article II, Section 9, guarantees are protected and\n\nimplemented primarily through Montana’s open meeting statutes, codified at 9s 2-3-201, et\n\nseq., MCA. One of these statutes, 5 2-3-203(l), MCA, provides:\n\n       All meetings ofpublic or governmental bodies, boards, bureaus,commissions,\n       agenciesof the state, or any political subdivision of the state or organizations\n       or agenciessupported in whole or in part by public funds or expending public\n       funds must be open to the public. [Emphasis added.]\n\nIn Conrnzon Cause, we recognized that the legislature did not define “public body” or\n\n“governmental body” in the open meeting statutes. Common Cause, 263 Mont. at 330, 868\n\nP.2d at 608. Thus, we gave the words in these phrases their “plain, ordinary and usual\n\nmeaning” and stated that “the common understandingof the phrase ‘public or governmental\n\nbody’ would include a group of individuals organized for a governmental or public purpose.”\n\n                                               6,\n\fCommon Cause, 263 Mont. at 330,        868   P.2d at   608   (citations omitted). There can be no\n\ndoubt, this Court is a group of individuals organizedby and under the Montana Constitution\n\nfor a governmental purpose. It follows, then, that this Court is a public or governmental\n\nbody.\n\n        Similarly, in Grent Fulls Tribune Co., Inc. v. Day, 1998MT 133,y 16,289 Mont. 155,\n\n7 16,959 P.2d 508,~ 16, this Court, in determining whether the Department of Corrections\n\nCommittee for Private Prison Screening and Evaluation was a “public body,” looked to the\n\nMontana Procurement Act, which defines “governmental body” as\n\n        a department, commission, council, board, bureau, committee, institution,\n        legislative body, agency, government corporation, or other entity,\n        instrumentality, or official of the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of\n        this state, including the board of regents and the Montana university system.\n\nSection 18-4-123(1 l), MCA (emphasis added). We stated that, since the committee was a\n\ncommittee of the executive branch of government, and a “governmental body” for purposes\n\nof procurement, “it necessarily follows that it is an agency of state government to which\n\nArticle II, Section 9, applies.” Great Falls Tribune, 7 17. This Court is clearly an “entity\n\n   of the     judicial branch of this state,” and, therefore, a “governmental body.” Section\n\n1%4-123( 1l), MCA. Thus, it “necessarily follows” that this Court is a “public body” to\n\nwhich Article II, Section 9, applies. Great Falls Tribune, 7 17.\n\n        The same conclusion can be drawn from our decision in Becky v. Butte-Silver Bow\n\nSch. Dist. I (1995), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">274</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mont.</span> <span class=\"page\">131</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"883463\"><a href=\"/opinion/883463/becky-v-butte-silver-bow-sch-dist-1/\"><span class=\"volume\">906</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">193</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. In Becky, this Court, in determining\n\nwhether the records of an organization were “documents of public bodies,” looked to 5 2-6-\n\n                                                7\n\f101(2)(a),     MCA,   which statesthat “public writings” are\n\n         the written acts or records of the acts of the sovereign authority, of official\n         bodies and tribunals, and of public officers, legislative,,judiciaZ,and executive,\n         whether of this state, of the United States, of a sister state, or of a foreign\n         country;\n\nBecky, 274 Mont. at 137,906 P.Zd at 197 (quoting 3 2-6-101(2)(a), MCA) (emphasisadded).\n\nSection 2-6-101, MCA, also states that there are four classesof public writings and that\n\n“judicial records” are one of the classes. Section 2-6-101(3)(b), MCA.         Finally, although\n\nwe recognizedthat “documents of public bodies” is not defined in the Montana Constitution,\n\nwe stated that “it must reasonably be held to mean documents generated or maintained by\n\na public body which are somehow related to the function and duties of that body.” Becky,\n\n274 Mont. at 138,906 P.2d at 197\n\n         Applying the definiti,:n of “public writings” found in $2-6-101(2)(a), MCA, it is clear\n\nthat most, if not all, of the d’ cuments which this Court generatesand maintains are “public\n\nwritings,” and, therefore, a: j: “documents of a public body.” Thus, since the documents\n\nwhich this Court generates 3nd maintains are “documents of a public body,” it follows\n\n(perhaps backwardly) that 1,lis Court is a “public body” to which Article II, Section 9,\n\napplies.\n\n             As these cases de: ronstrate, this Court has been particularly vigilant and\n\nuncompromising in protectin : Montanans’ constitutional “right to know” and in rejecting\n\nother governmental bodies’ at empts to limit or subvert this right. In Great Fulls Tribune,\n\nfor example, the committee arg.ted that the public’s right to observe its meetings with private\n\n                                                 8\n\f                                             .       .\n\n\n\n\ncompanies which had submitted proposalsto build a private correctional facility in Montana\n\nand to review the papers associatedwith the companies’ proposals was outweighed by the\n\ncompanies’ right to privacy in the information that they had submitted. Great Falls Tribune,\n\n18. We held, however, that the Great Falls Tribune had a constitutional right under Article\n\nII, Section 9, to observe the committee’s deliberations and to examine the committee’s\n\ndocuments, including proposalsthat had been submitted to it. Great Fulls Tribune, 133. We\n\nalso stated that the only exception to the public’s right to observe the committee’s\n\ndeliberations and documents concerned information to which the companies had a privacy\n\ninterest. Great Falls Tribune, 7 33.\n\n       In sum, and basedon the foregoing, if there exists somevalid argument for exempting\n\nthe deliberations and decision-making processesof this Court from the operation of Article\n\nII, Section 9, the rationale is neither apparent in the tenor of our prior jurisprudence nor,\n\nmore importantly, in the plain languageof the constitutional provision itself or in the history\n\nof its adoption.\n\n       And, with regard to the latter, while the concurring Justices read the Constitutional\n\nConvention history of Article II, Section 9, a great deal more restrictively than 1 do,\n\nnevertheless that history--and our disagreement over what it means--is largely academic.\n\nFor, as we made eminently clear in Associated Press,\n\n              [t]he language of [Article II, Section 91 speaksfor itself. It applies to\n       all persons and all public bodies of the state and its subdivisions without\n       exception. Under such circumstances, it is our duty to interpret the intent of\n       the framers from the language of the provision alone and not to resort to\n\n                                                 9\n\f   ,     ‘I                                                                               .,\n\n\n\n\n       extrinsic aids or rules of construction in determining the intent of the delegates\n       to the Constitutional Convention.\n\nAssociatedPress, 246 Mont. at 392, 804 P.2d at 379 (quoting Great Falls Tribune v.

In this\n\nregard, I make three observations. First, since we are bound by the “right to know” provision\n\nof the Constitution of Montana, we, and litigants, will simply have to deal with the\n\nconsequences changesthat flow from opening our deliberationsand operate accordingly.\n           and\n\nOther public bodies of state government seemto be able to comply with the requirements of\n\nArticle II, Section 9, and, yet, function quite well. I find it difficult to believe that, given the\n\ncaliber of the justices serving on this Court, that we are not, likewise, up to the task.\n\n Likewise, I refuse to be cowed by the concurrences’\n                                                   paradeof horribles-internal memos and\n\n proposed opinions being made public, media blitzes, massesof the unwashed converging\n\n upon the Court, cases settling, criminals jumping bail. Good griefl            If, before a final\n\n opinion is handed down, litigants want to settle, jump bail or jump off a bridge, for that\n\n matter, they can, and often do that now. If votes change between the time of initial\n\n discussion and final opinion, then those who acted prematurely will have to bear the\n\n consequences their bad or good decision.\n             of\n\n         Second,in my experience,every public body that has been faced with the prospect of\n\n opening its operations to the press and public has put forth a whole list of problems and\n\n                                                  10\n\f.-__..      ---.__-                                                              -\n\n\nreascms    why   it is unique;   why   “right   to know”    should   not apply   to it; why   the functions   and,\n\n\nperhaps, very existence of the body itself will be compromised by the changesthat will be\n\nforced upon it; and why the public will run amuck or abuse the new found information\n\ngleaned from open meetings. In point of fact, in the many caseswhere we have rejected\n\nthese very arguments and have, instead, required compliance with the Constitution, the sky\n\ndid not fall; the sun rose the next day; the public body complied; and the business of\n\ngovernment went on. Again, and despite the concurring Justices’ concerns, I suggest that\n\nthis Court would continue to function quite effectively and quite well if we opened our\n\ndeliberations and proceedings in compliance with Article II, Section 9.\n\n          Third, the concurring Justicesraise the specterof opening to the press and public the\n\ndeliberationsof trial juries. In doing so, they read more into my dissent than I have written.\n\nMy present concern is with the applicability of Article II, Section 9, to the operations of this\n\nCourt. I agree that there are fundamental differences in the functioning of trial juries that\n\nmay well, if not likely, preclude the provision’s applications to those bodies. That, however,\n\nhas absolutely nothing to do with the matter at issue. I believe that the requirements of\n\nArticle II, Section 9, apply to the operationsof this Court, and that is all this dissentis about.\n\n          Finally, even assumingnrgtle/zdo,that somehow the “right to know” provisions of the\n\nMontana Constitution do not apply to the judicial deliberations and decision-making\n\nprocessesof this Court, the exercise of our power of appointment under Article V, Section\n\n14(2), is not a judicial function but is, rather, an administrative one. We are not here called\n\n\n                                                           11\n\fupon to decide a justiciable controversy, to rule on a legal question, to interpret the law or\n\nthe Constitution, to issue a writ, to discipline an attorney, to make rules governing the\n\npractice and procedure before the courts of this State, or to appoint persons to committees\n\nand commissions that directly affect the operation of the courts and the administration of\n\njustice--all traditional judicial functions.\n\n       To the contrary, we are here simply executing a default power to appoint the fifth\n\nperson to a bi-partisan commission whose decisions will impact primarily the legislative\n\nbranch and the future balance of political power between the Democrat and Republican\n\nparties, between urban and agriculture interests, and between Indians and non-Indians in this\n\nState. Requiring judges to make an appointment to a non-judicial, political commission--\n\neven where that requirement is basedin the Constitution--does not make the appointment or\n\nthe process and deliberations leading up to it a judicial function any more than is a judge’s\n\n performance of the administrative act of hiring, supervising, demoting or tiring a judicial\n\n employee a judicial function. Simply put--and the law is clear on this point--not every\n\n official act required of a court is a judicial function becausethe act in question happens to\n\n be performed by a judge.

I cannot accept this double standard.\n\n       Justice Leaphart, however, believesthe doublestandardis justified--in fact, mandated-\n\n-because our appointment authority is grounded in the Constitution itself. I cannot agree.\n\nThere is no basis for concluding that the discharge of our obligations under Article V,\n\nSection 14(2)--whether those are characterized as judicial or administrative--and under\n\nArticle II, Section 9, are incompatible or are mutually exclusive. Indeed, the fallacy of this\n\nargument is that it assumesthat this Court will be unable to act “judicially”; that we will be\n\nunableto perform “uniquely judicial” functions; that somehow we will be less “independent”\n\nor not as “apolitical”; and that we will fail the test of “impartiality” if we open our\n\nproceedings and deliberationsto the public, as the Constitution, Article II, Section 9, clearly\n\nrequires. Nonsense.\n\n       I cannot for a moment believe that the members of this Court will suddenly transform\n\ninto a bunch of political hacks, unable to render impartial, independent decisions--judicial\n\n\n                                               13\n\f                                        .   .

I        ,.\n\n\n\n\nor administrative--subject to the pressures of lobbying and paralyzed by an inability to\n\nentertain thoughtful discussions, if we open our decision-making processes to public\n\nscrutiny. In fact, if anything, the opposite is the more likely consequence. Like Justice\n\nTrieweiler, I can think of no better guarantee of impartiality, of prepared, thoughtful\n\ndiscussionand comment and ofjudicious decision-making than knowing that the collective\n\nprocessesand individual comments and opinions of this Court’s members will be subject to\n\nobservation and probing analysis and reporting by the media and careful examination by\n\ninterested members of the public. I can think of no better guarantee against litigants and\n\nattorneys lobbying the members of this Court (assuming arguendo that anyone would be\n\nunethical and, frankly, stupid enoughto do that) than their knowing that such efforts would\n\nmost likely headline the morning paper.\n\n       why, after all, did the framers include Article II, Section 9, in the Constihltion? The\n\nanswer is self-evident. Elected officials, government bureaucratsand public officers are less\n\nlikely to cut deals and comers if they have to operate in a fish bowl. Very simply, when\n\n public employees and officials--judges included--perform the public’s business, the public\n\n is entitled to observe and to understandhow they are going about it. More to the point, if,\n\n as Justice Leaphart argues, the judiciary is, by its very nature and as a distinct branch of\n\n government, already pure of purpose, intention and action, what conceivable harm would\n\n follow in simply letting the press and public observe that first-hand? If we’ve nothing to\n\n hide, then what need have we of secrecy? Is this Court incapableof complying with the right\n\n\n                                                    14\n\f   ,   .        4.\n                                                                                        ‘I,       .\n            ’        I     *\n                                            *.       .

We should all resign if we are that inept. Contrary to\n\nthe concurring Justice’s comments, open deliberations will not make this a less effective\n\nCourt; it will make us all better justices.\n\n           Likewise, I am similarly unpersuadedby Justice Leaphart’s reliance on the fact that\n\nother courts have determined that ‘Ijudicial deliberations are confidential.” Our obligation\n\nto open our deliberations is, as I have discussed at length above, required by Article II,\n\nSection 9, of the Montana Constitution. Justice Leaphart appears to concede that this\n\nprovision is broader than similar provisions in other states. That should end the discussion.\n\nThis Court is bound by this State’sConstitution not some other state’s or by common law\n\ntradition. Moreover, how many times has this Court announcedits determination to find its\n\nown unique path in the requirements of Montana’s own unique Constitution, proudly--nay,\n\n defiantly--“refusing to march lockstep” with other jurisdictions, state and federal? There is\n\n no good reason, much less a legal one, why we must suddenly fall in behind the parade on\n\n this issue either.\n\n           Finally, as to Justice Leaphart’s discussion of the reach of other provisions of\n\n Montana’s Constitution, I can only note that we have not determined the scope of those. I\n\n am not willing to offer any opinion at this time as to how those provisions might or might not\n\n be read. We have, however, and as pointed out above,unequivocally held that the language\n\n of Article II, Section 9, speaks for itself without reference to extrinsic aids, rules of\n\n\n                                                     15\n\f                                      .      .        .\n\nconstruction or resort to the history of the Constitutional Convention; that these provisions\n\napply to all persons and all public bodies of the state without exception; and that the\n\nmandates of Article II, Section 9 must be followed by each of the three branches of\n\ngovernment. AssociatedPress, 246 Mont. at 391-92,804 P.2d at 379. Either we meant what\n\nwe said, or, at the earliest opportunity, we should overrule these statements as meaningless,\n\nsanctimonious, claptrap.\n\n       In closing, I am satisfied that the person this Court has appointed is well-qualified to\n\nchair the reapportionment commission. Her vote will likely be crucial on many important\n\ndecisions to be made by the commission in the coming months. But, the names of other\n\nwell-qualified persons’were also placedbefore this Court for considerationand were, in fact,\n\nfairly considered. Had the process been open, the public would have been informed and\n\nwould have benefited from our discussionsand deliberations. Had we simply complied with\n\nArticle II, Section 9, the integrity of the entire appointment process would have been\n\nenhanced and verified. And, unfortunately, since we did not open our deliberations and\n\ndiscussions to the public, those who will now speculate and criticize our choice will find\n\nample fodder in the ignorance which is always bred of secrecy.\n\n        We, as a Court, had a unique chance--certainly one unprecedented in Montana and,\n\n\n\n\n        ’ Thoseinclude:E.

I would simply like to add my\n\npersonalobservationregardingwhat I believe would be practical benefits from greater public\n\nscrutiny of this Court’s performance.\n\n       I have now served on this Court for eight and one-half years. During that service,\n\nthere have been times when I felt the Court did not function well as an institution. During\n\nthose times, greater public scrutiny would have led to constructive criticism and ultimate\n\nimprovement in the processby which this Court arrived at its decisions.\n\n       At other times, it has been my opinion that this Court has performed with unique\n\ndistinction. Public scrutiny at those times, would have enhancedpublic confidence in the\n\nCourt as an institution and the process by which many significant issues in this State have\n\nbeen decided.\n\n       I do not agree with those who suggest that the members of this Court could not\n\n function as candidly and effectively as they do now if the Court’s deliberationswere open to\n\n the public. While certainly over the course of eight and one-half years remarks have been\n\n\n                                             18\n\f madc   during   conf‘crcnce   which   wouldn't   have been made       with   reporters present,     no one can\n\n\nseriously contend that those remarks contributed anything of a positive nature to the decision\n\nmaking process.\n\n        Furthermore, it has always mystified me how this Court can continue to operate\n\nprivately in the face of an obvious constitutional mandate to the contrary on the basis that it\n\nis simply a more effective way to proceed, when at the same time the judiciary prohibits\n\nschool boards from discussing collective bargaining strategy privately (set Great Fulls\n\nTribune v.

Certainly, these public bodies felt strongly that these functions could be performed\n\nmore “effectively” without public scrutiny.\n\n        I concur with JusticeNelson’sconstitutional analysisof our obligation to conduct our\n\nbusiness publicly, and simply add that openness is not only constitutionally required, I\n\nbelieve it would lead to a consistently better product       and a judicial        institution     in which   the\n\n\npublic has greater confidence.\n\n\n                                                         e----\n                                                          MT&\n\n                                                         /         Y          Justice\n\n                                                    19\n\f                                                                                .        1,\n                                                                            ,       c\n                                         .’       ’\n                                              I\n\n\n\n\n      Justice Jim Regnier specially concurs.\n\n       1 enthusiastically concur in the Court’s appointment of Dr. Pretty On Top to this\n\nimportant position. I alsojoin my colleagues,\n                                            JusticesNelson and Trieweiler, in their strong\n\nbelief in open government. It is not only the right view, it is mandated by our Constitution.\n\nAs Justice Nelson correctly notes regarding Montana’s constitutional Right to Know, this\n\nCourt has been “vigilant and uncompromising in rejecting other governmental bodies’\n\nattempts to limit or subvert this right.” For the reasonsstatedbelow, however, I do not share\n\nthe dissenting view that Article II, Section 9 of Montana’s Constitution applies to the\n\ndeliberations of the Montana SupremeCourt.\n\n       At the outset, I think that it is important to appreciatethe context in which this matter\n\nis before us. This Court is exercisingits power of appointmentpursuant to Article V, Section\n\n14(2) of Montana’s Constitution and Title 5, Chapter 1 of the Montana Code Annotated.\n\nTheseprovisions provide that the Montana SupremeCourt shall appoint the fifth member of\n\nthe Montana Districting and Apportionment Commission in the event the Commission is\n\nunable to reach agreement on a fifth member. The issue addressedby the dissent, that is\n\nwhether the deliberations of the Montana Supreme Court regarding this appointment are\n\n subject to Article II, Section9, is not before us as a contestedissue. In the usual case,parties\n\n to a dispute tile briefs with this Court setting forth legal argumentsto support their respective\n\n positions. When we were informed that the Commission was unable to select a fifth\n\n member, we proceededto place this matter on our weekly agendain the samemanner as any\n\n\n                                                  20\n\f                                             .         ,\n\n\nother matter is addressedby this Court. No person or entity has filed an original action in\n\nthis Court contesting the manner in which we determined to proceed.\n\n         1 recognize that some may interpret my view that the deliberations of this Court are\n\nexempt from the provisions of Article II, Section 9, as disingenuous. Indeed, many may\n\ncriticize such a position when this Court has forced other public bodies to open up their\n\ndeliberations to public view and the necessary scrutiny that follows.         However, after\n\nreviewing the applicabletranscript of the Constitutional Convention, it seemsclear to me that\n\nthe Delegates never intended the provisions of Article II, Section 9 to apply to the\n\ndeliberationsof this Court. Furthermore, in my view, opening the conferences of this Court\n\nto the public would detract from, rather than improve, our ability to servethe citizens of this\n\nstate.\n\n         Any scrutiny of a constimtional provision must begin with an examination of the text\n\nin question. The dissent suggeststhat a plain reading of Article II, Section 9 leads one to the\n\ninescapable conclusion that the provision applies to the deliberation of judicial bodies, in\n\nparticular, the deliberations of this Court.          Therefore, under our accepted rules of\n\nconstruction, the dissent argues we should go no further in our analysis. From my reading\n\nof the provision, however, it is not clear that the phrase “deliberations of all public bodies”\n\n found in Article II, Section 9, includes the deliberations of the Montana Supreme Court.\n\n Since the adoption of our current Constitution, I am unaware of any actions filed in this\n\n Court or any district court in this state contending Montana’s constitutional Right to Know\n\n\n                                                 21\n\f                                            .\n\n\nincludesthe right to observethe deliberationsof this Court. The absenceof such a challenge\n\nsuggests to me that it is not clear and unambiguous that this provision applies to such\n\ndeliberations. As the dissent points out, Article II, Section 9 has been the subject of\n\nconsiderablelitigation as it appliesto various governmentalbodies. No litigation, however,\n\nhas ever alleged that the proceedings of this Court were in violation of the provision.\n\nAlthough we have defined “public body” in a variety of ways as contested cases were\n\npresentedto us, none of thesecasesinvolved the preciseissueaddressedhere, that is whether\n\nthis Court is considered a “public body” for the purposes of Article II, Section 9.\n\n        A review of the transcript of the Montana Constitutional Convention of 1972 is\n\nhelpful in analyzing this important question. Justice Nelson correctly points out that the\n\nDelegates to the Constitutional Convention specifically amended the language of what\n\nbecameArticle II, Section 8 of the Montana Constitution which gives the public the right to\n\nparticipate in the operations of governmental agencies.\n\n       Article II, Section 8 of Montana’s Constitution provides:\n\n       Right of participation. The public has the right to expect governmental\n       agenciesto afford such reasonableopportunity for citizen participation in the\n       operation of the agenciesprior to final decision as may be provided by law.\n\nThe relevant transcript relating to Section 8 disclosesthat DelegateBerg was concernedthat\n\n an earlier draft which used the word “government” rather than “governmental agencies”\n\n might reasonablybe interpreted to include the judiciary which unquestionably is a branch of\n\n the government. Delegate Berg pointed out that this provision could be interpreted to mean\n\n\n                                                22\n\fthat the public would not only have the right to observetrials and other judicial proceedings,\n\nbut would also have the right, in some fashion, to participate in the judicial process such as\n\npreparing jury instructions or providing input to the court in the preparation of the court’s\n\norders. Delegate McNeil had a similar concern that the provision might be interpreted as\n\nproviding the public the right to actually participate by way of vote in the legislature or the\n\nMontana Supreme Court. Addressing these concerns, the text was ultimately amended by\n\nsubstituting the term “governmental agencies” for “government.”                See Montana\n\nConstitutional Convention, Verbatim Transcript, March 7, 1972, pp. 1663-67.\n\n       The dissent posits that Delegate Berg’s proposed amendment to Section 8, and its\n\nacceptance the Delegates,shedslight on the ultimate breadth and meaning of Section 9.\n          by\n\nDelegate Berg also moved to amend the language of what becameArticle II, Section 9 out\n\n of concern that the phrase “public bodies” might be interpretedto include juries, grandjuries,\n\n or the deliberations of this Court. Delegate Dahood, Chairman of the Bill of Rights\n\n Committee, responded:\n\n        And.I think the interpretation that he has given could possibly be laid against\n        this section, but I am very reluctant to rise in opposition to Delegate Berg on\n        this issuebecauseI’m certainly in accord with everything that he says, except\n        I’m not satisjied in my mind andjudgment that a court could conceivably give\n        that interpretation to ‘bodies”. We are referring there to public bodies;\n        perhaps city councils,perhaps some bureaucratic groups or some bureau that\n        may have beenestablishedperhapsfor someparticular specialpublic purpose\n               I think our commentsclearly indicate that we are not trying to upset any\n         traditional rule ofprocedure with respect to anything within the judiciary.\n\n\n\n\n                                               23\n\f(Emphasisadded.) See Montana Constitutional Convention, Verbatim Transcript, March 16,\n\n1972, at 2499-500.\n\n       From the actions of the Delegatesrelating to Delegate Berg’s proposed amendments\n\nto Sections 8 and 9 of Article II, the dissent reasons that since the Delegates accepted\n\nDelegate Berg’s argument and amendedArticle II, Section 8, but refused to amend Article\n\nII, Section 9 wher Delegate Berg made a similar suggestion, the conclusion is that the\n\nDelegates intended that Article II, Section 9 be broader in scopethan Section 8.\n\n       My review of the transcript indicates that there were logical reasons to support the\n\nDelegates’ action of voting in favor of Delegate Berg’s proposed amendment to Section 8,\n\nwhile rejecting his proposedamendmentto Section9. There is no questionthat a preliminary\n\ndraft of Section 8 which used the term “government” might very legitimately have been\n\ninterpreted to include the judiciary, which unquestionably is a branch of the government.\n\nThus, it is clear to me that the Delegates felt that Delegate Berg’s concerns about Section 8\n\nwere justified.\n\n       Notwithstanding their vote on the Section 8 amendment,my reading of the transcript\n\ndiscloses that the Delegates did not intend that Article II, Section 9 should apply to\n\ndeliberations of this Court, juries or grand juries. In fact, very little discussion took place\n\nafter Delegate Dahood, a lawyer, seemedto convince the Delegates that no “court could\n\nconceivably give that interpretation to ‘bodies’     [and that] our comments clearly indicate\n\nthat we are not trying to upset any traditional rule of procedure with respect to anything with\n\n\n                                              24\n\f                                             .        .\n\n\nthe judiciary.”   My interpretation of this dialogue at the Convention is that the Delegates\n\nwere apparently persuaded that Delegate Berg’s proposed amendment to Section 9 was\n\nunnecessary. 1 seenothing in the transcript to suggestthat the framers ever intended that\n\nArticle II, Section 9 be interpreted as the dissent suggests.\n\n       The reasoningof Delegate Dahood was sound at the Convention and is sound today.\n\nIf we were to conclude that Article II, Section 9 applies to the deliberations of the Montana\n\nSupremeCourt, the judicial processof this institution, aswe know it, would be significantly\n\ndifferent and, in my view, compromised. It is not uncommon for this Court to deliberate on\n\na particular casefor months, even after the briefing is completed and oral argument has been\n\nconducted. During this time additionalresearchis pursued,the transcript of the proceedings\n\nbelow is reviewed by the Justices, and proposed opinions and dissents are circulated and\n\ndiscussed during Court conferences. Preliminary votes quite often change as the case\n\nprogressesto a final written opinion. If the public, which of course includes the parties to\n\nthe litigation, were able to observethese deliberations, there is no question in my mind that\n\nthe parties would act in anticipation of the Court’s decision. The opinion ultimately handed\n\ndown by this Court, in many instances,may be entirely different than the parties’ prediction.\n\nI don’t believe such a processwould benefit anyone.\n\n        My other major concern is that the judicial process itself would be detrimentally\n\nimpacted by the public attention that would no doubt be directed to the Court as it deliberates\n\nover cases. Efforts to lobby the Court both directly and indirectly would inevitably occur\n\n\n                                                 25\n\fespecially in high profile or controversial matters. Unlike the legislative process, where\n\ncontinuousinteraction with the citizenry is desirable,\n                                                     judicial decision making functions best\n\nin an environment where such influences are avoided. Soundjudicial decisionsare made by\n\nreflecting on principles of law, hopefully unswayedby public opinion. In fact, many judicial\n\ndecisions are unpopular, as members of this Court are acutely aware. However, the\n\nunpopular decision is more often than not the legally correct one. I believe our ability to\n\nfunction in such a fashion would be significantly jeopardized by open conferences.\n\n       Finally, under the analysis of the dissent, one might logically suggestthat the entire\n\njury deliberation processwould necessarily also be open to the public. It is hard for me to\n\nimagine how such a jury system could function. Ordinary citizens who are called to jury\n\nduty are the true heroesin our system ofjustice. Jurors make difficult decisions that affect\n\nthe very liberty and property of the persons involved in the litigation. The time-honored\n\ntradition in this country has always been that no one, not the lawyers, the judge, the media,\n\nor anyone, is allowed to observe, participate or invade jury deliberations. Imagine, for\n\ninstance,the spectacleof a criminal jury sitting in judgment of an accusedwho is present in\n\nthe jury room during deliberations.\n\n       JusticeNelson points out that even if one concedesthat the Right to Know provisions\n\n do not apply to judicial deliberations, our function in making this appointment to the\n\n Montana Districting andApportionment Commission was purely administrative in nature and\n\n most certainly subject to the provisions of Article II, Section 9. This Court is involved in\n\n\n                                              26\n\f                                             .    ‘1   .\n\n\n\n\nmany functions which are not technically judicial, such as adopting rules governing the\n\nprocedure of the Court and making appointmentsto various commissions of the Court, only\n\nto name a few. I think it would be an unwieldy process if we were to attempt to segregate\n\nout our judicial functions from administrative ones for the purpose of Article II, Section 9.\n\nMy interpretation of Delegate Dahood’s comments that “we are not trying to upset any\n\ntraditional rule of procedure with respect to anything within the judiciary” applies to our\n\nadministrative functions as well.\n\n       In my view, Article II, Section 9, commonly referred to as Montana’s constitutional\n\nRight to Know provision, does not and was never intended to apply to deliberations of the\n\nMontana Supreme Court.\n\n\n\n\n        Chief Justice J. A. Tumage, JusticeW.                   , and Justice Karla M. Gray\njoin in the foregoing specially concurring opinion of Justice Jim Regnier.\n\n\n\n\n                                                              / h++e-v-\n                                                                Justice\n\n\n\n\n                                                                 Jus ‘ce\n\n                                                 27\n\f                    0\nJustice W. William Leaphart, specially con&rmg.,\n\n\n       I find myself in the anomalousposition of replying to a dissent in a matter in which\n\nthere is no opinion by the Court and no adverseparties who have tiled briefs and framed the\n\nissues. Despite this unusual posture, the dissenters have sua sponte raised some very\n\nprofound issues about the deliberative process of judges and juries in light of the\n\nconstitutional right to know andI take this opportunity to expressmy disagreementwith their\n\ninterpretation of our constitutional guarantees.\n\n       The dissent argues that all deliberations of this Court should be open to the public\n\nunder the right to know provision of the Montana Constitution.’ In particular, JusticeNelson\n\n contendsthat our appointment of a fifth commissioner to the reapportionment commission\n\n is, like the hiring or firing of a court employee,an administrative matter that should be open\n\n to the public. As I will elaborate below, I disagreethat our deliberations are subject to the\n\n right to know provision. Furthermore, I do not agree that our constitutional obligation to\n\n appoint a commissioner is, asthe dissent argues,a mere administrative matter like the hiring\n\n or firing of a court employee.\n\n        Whether this Court’s appointment of a fifth member of the reapportionment\n\n commission is a judicial action should turn on whether that action is judicial in the sensethat\n\n  it is unique to this Court. Is the action of a distinctive nature that no other governmental\n\n\n\n         ’ For convenienceI have denoted Justice Nelson’s special concurrence and dissent\n  as “the dissent,” becauseJustice Trieweiler, in his special concurrence and dissent, states\n  that he is in agreement with Justice Nelson’s constitutional analysis of the right to know\n  provision.\n\n                                                28\n\fentity can perform?\n\n      I submit that the answer to the inquiry is readily apparent: Montana’s Constitution\n\nexpresslyprovides that when the legislative appointeescannot agree on the appointment of\n\na fifth member to the reapportionment commission, “a major@ of the supreme court shall\n\nselect&n.” Art. V, Sec. 14(2), Mont. Const. (emphasisadded). The Constitution mandates\n\nthat this Court and no other entity perform the appointment task.\n\n       Although we could end the inquiry here, I note that the Constitutional Convention\n\nhistory shows that the framers intended that this Court’s appointment of fifth commission\n\nmembers embody the institutional characteristicsthat uniquely distinguish the judiciary. The\n\nMontana Constitutional Convention Comments provide:\n\n       The committee considers reapportionment and redistricting to be a\n       troublesome and time consuming matter for a legislative body becauseof the\n       legislature’s difficulty in being objective. . . The committee recognized that\n       redistricting and reapportionmenthas political repercussions,so the proposed\n       section provides for bipartisanism in the method of selection of the first four\n       members. The fifth member of the commission becomesthe key vote and his\n       selection by the other four members is to insure impartiality.\n\nI Montana Constitutional Convention, Comments, p. 393.              Thus, the Constitutional\n\nConvention framers’ commentsmake clear that in the eventthat legislative appointeescannot\n\nagree on a fifth member for the commission, our Constitution’s framers intended that an\n\n apolitical, independent entity make the appointment: Montana’s Supreme Court.\n\n        It strains credulity to supposethat the framers intended that this Court make such\n\n appointments without observing the very judicial traditions that enable it to operate as an\n\n\n                                             29\n\f    apolitical and independentbranch of government. As Montana SupremeCourt justices who\n\n    are constitutionally required to make this appointment when the partisan legislative\n\n    appointeescannot agreeamong themselves,I submit that we act in our judicial capacity and\n\n    not as mere administrators.\n\n          Turning then to the broader question of whether our deliberations of judicial matters\n\n    are subject to the right to know provision, I am not aware of any appellate court that allows\n\n    the public to observe its deliberations. I am also not aware of any other state that has a\n\n    similarly broad constitutional right to know provision. ’ However, other state courts have\nI\n    expressly affirmed the common-law tradition ofprivate judicial deliberations. For example,\n\n    in In Re Inquiry Concerning a Judge, Gridley (Fla. 1982), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">417</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">950</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 955, the court\n\n    observedthat “judicial deliberations are confidential.” In People v. Mallory (Mich. 1967)\n\n    147N.W.2d 66 (Souris, J. concurring), a judge offered a cogent discussionof that common-\n\n\n            2 Other states’constitutional right to know or observeprovisions are expressly\n    limited. Article XI, Section 5 of North Dakota’s constitution provides that “‘[u]nZess\n    otherwise provided by law, all meetings of public or governmental bodies, boards,\n    bureaus, commissions, or agenciesof the state or any political subdivision of the state, or\n     organizations or agenciessupported in whole or in part by public funds, or expending\n    public funds, shall be open to the public.” Art. XI, Sec. 5, N.D. Const. (emphasis added).\n     Similarly, Article XII, Section 3 of Louisiana’s constitution provides that “[n]o person\n     shall be denied the right to observe the deliberations of public bodies and examine public\n     documents, except in casesestablished by law. Art. XII, Sec. 3, La. Const. (emphasis\n     added). Part one, Article 8 of the New Hampshire constitution provides that “[a]11power\n     residing originally in, and being derived from, the people, all the magistrates and officers\n     of government are their substitutes and agents, and at all times accountableto them.\n     Government, therefore, should be open, accessible,accountable, and responsive. To that\n     end, the public’s right of accessto governmental proceedings and records shall not be\n     unreasonably restricted.” Pt. one, Art. 8, N.H. Const. (emphasis added).\n\n                                                  30\n\f                                                                                                .\n                                                                            .   I,   *\n\n\n\n\nlaw tradition:\n\n       It has been my understanding that views expressedby judges of an appellate\n       court while deliberating upon their decisionsare confidential until they appear\n       in an opinion, if they ever do, over the signature of the author. Such privacy\n       permits judges to discuss freely among themselves all issues involved in a\n       case, to advancetentative views for the sometimes enlightening reactions of\n       wiser colleaguesand to criticize candidly and sometimes bluntly the notions\n       offered by other colleagues, all without fear of subsequentembarrassment to\n        any member of the Court by public disclosure of anything said or written\n       which does not survive the ordeal as a subscribed formal opinion. In my\n       judgment such freedom of expressionin camera should be encouragedamong\n        Justiceswhose duty it is to strive, at least, to reach majority accord when that\n        can be achievedwithout compromise of legal principles.\n\nMallory,     147 N.W.2d at 74.\n\n           Federal courts have also affirmed the confidentiality of judicial deliberations,\n\nrecognizing that candiddeliberations areessentialto an independentjudiciary and suggesting\n\nthat there is a judicial privilege. In United Statesv. Nixon (1974), 418 U.S. 683,94 S.Ct.\n\n 3090,41 L.Ed.2d 1039, the Court recognized that\n\n           [h]uman experience teaches that those who expect public dissemination of\n           their remarks may well temper candor with a concern for appearancesand for\n           their own interests to the detriment of the decisiomnakingprocess.

First, when Montana’s\n\nconstitutional right to know provision (hereafter, right to know provision) is read with regard\n\nto established canons of construction and to the interdependent structure of Montana’s\n\nConstitution, it is clear that judicial deliberations fall well outside the scope of the public’s\n\nright to know. Second, to treat Montana’s judiciary as a “public body” would do real\n\nviolence to the Montana Constitution’s requirement of an independentjudiciary that serves\n\nas a distinct branch of government.\n\n              It should be apparent that the meaning of “public bodies” is ambiguous: if nothing\n\n else, the long arduous procession of decisions cited by the dissent evinces the patent\n\n ambiguity of that phrase. NOTare those casesin agreement about the meaning of the right\n\n to know provision’s recognition of public bodies and agenciesof state government. FOT\n\n example, in SJL of Montana Assoc. v.

I think . .

The SJL Court concluded that “[i]t is obvious\n\nfrom these and other remarks that the framers of the Constitution were concerned with\n\ngovernmental entities which had rule-making authority and regulatory powers.” SJL, 263\n\nMont. at 149, 867 P.2d at 1088. However, in a dissentingopinion, Justice Trieweiler argued\n\nthat “[t]he majority opinion ignores the plain language of Article II, Section 9, Montana\n\nConstitution. . . . What was prohibited fey a previous decision of the Court] is exactly what\n\nwas done in this case.” SJL, 263 Mont. at 150-51, 867 P.2d at 1089 (Trieweiler, J.\n\n dissenting). I raise SJL not to argue the merits of that decision but rather to show that the\n\n meaning of the phrase, “public bodies or agencies, is hardly plain and unambiguous.\n                                                  ”\n\n        Moreover, it is an established rule of construction that words in a statute or\n\n constitution not be treated as mere surplusage;we presume that each word has a particular\n\n and intended significance. However, the dissent urges that this Court is simply “a group of\n\n individuals organized by and under the Montana Constitution for a governmental purpose”\n\n and that the Court is a “public body” under the right to know provision. Thus, under the\n\n dissent’s construction, a “public body” is the substantive equivalent of a branch of\n\n                                               33\n\fgovernment. The dissenthas therefore renderedArticle III, Sectionl’s recognition of distinct\n\nbranchesof government mere surplusage. SeeArt. III, Sec. 1, Mont. Const. (providing that\n\n“[t]he power of the government of this state is divided into three distinct branches”)\n\n(emphasis added). I do not agree that the Montana Constitution’s separation of powers\n\nprovision can be so easily dismissed.\n\n       Yet another establishedrule of construction is that when statutory or constitutional\n\nlanguage is ambiguous, a court may consider the intent of its drafters. The Montana\n\nConstitutional Convention Comments to the right to know provision provide in part that it\n\nis a companion to the right of participation and that\n\n       Both arise out of the increasing concern of citizens and commentators alike\n       that government’ssheerbignessthreatensthe effective exercise of citizenship.\n         . . The provision stipulates that persons have the rights to examine\n       governmentaldocumentsand the deliberationsof all public bodies or agencies\n       except to the extent that the demandsof individual privacy outweigh the needs\n       of the public right of disclosure. . . . The committee intends by this provision\n       that the deliberation and resolution of all public matters must be subject to\n       public scrutiny.\n\n II Montana Constitutional Convention, Comments, p. 631 (emphasis added).                 This\n\n constitutional history establishesthat the delegateswere concerned with the dangers of a\n\n large complex government that could secretly undertake actions that affect the public.\n\n        However, the Constitutional Convention Delegates’ legitimate concerns about the\n\n dangersof a secretive large government simply do not implicate the judiciary. The judiciary\n\n is perhapsunique among Montana’s three branches of government in that it cannot secretly\n\n take actions that affect the public. Montana’s Constitution expressly requires that “[a]\n\n                                              34\n\f    ,   ,,‘,\n\n\n               ~,      ,                           ,   0    ,                   ,   I.\n\n\n\n\nmajority [of the Supreme Court] shall join in and pronounce decisions, which must be in\n\nwriting.”           Art. VII, Sec. 3, Mont.   Const. The decisions of Montana’s Supreme Court are\n\npublic, open to public scrutiny, and subject to challenge. Further, Montana Supreme Court\n\njustices are individually accountablefor their decisions.\n\n         Although the dissentdisregardsthe structure of the right to know provision, a cogent\n\nlogical structure underlies and organizesthe right to know provision’s requirement that the\n\ndeliberations of all public bodies be open unless “the demand of individual privacy clearly\n\nexceedsthe merits of public disclosure.” Art. II, Sec. 9, Mont. Const. The structure of the\n\nright to know provision presupposes an independententity will balance individual rights\n                                   that\n\nto privacy with the merits of public disclosure.\n\n          Montana’s Constitutional Convention Delegates explicitly presumed that Montana’s\n\njudiciary would be the entity that balancesinterestsin privacy and public disclosure. During\n\ndiscussionofthe right to know provision, Convention DelegateCate proposedan amendment\n\nthat would allow the legislatureto “set the situations in which individual privacy exceedsthe\n\nmerits of public disclosure.” V Montana Constitutional Convention, Verbatim Transcript\n\n (hereafter, transcript), p. 1671. Arguing in opposition to Delegate Cate’s proposed\n\n amendment,Delegate Foster responded“Now, it was the thinking of the committee that, in\n\n fact, the courts would have to strike the balancebetween the merits of public disclosure and\n\n the merits of privacy, and our committee had faith in our courts to strike this balance. And\n\n we did not feel that this particular provision should be left to the Legislature to interpret.”\n\n\n                                                           35\n\fSee transcript at 1672. Even the delegates who voiced support for Delegate Cate’s\n\namendmentrecognized that the judiciary would balanceindividual privacy with the merits\n\nof public disclosure. For example, Delegate Loendorf expressedapprehensionthat if an\n\nagency barred his attending a public meeting on the grounds that his attendance would\n\nviolate the privacy of an individual, he would “have to go to court and attempt to get an order\n\nallowing [him] to attend.” See transcript at 1674. Arguing as well for Delegate Cate’s\n\nproposedamendment,DelegateBrown cautionedthat he could seewhere “this [right to know\n\nprovision] would be abusedby a County Commissioner, a Governor, other state officials,\n\nusing this exception in our present Constitution to deny accessto public documents. As a\n\nresult, you’d have to go to court and end up ultimately with the Supreme Court.”           See\n\ntranscript at 1677. Delegate Cate’s amendment was defeated.\n\n       Our Constitutional Convention history clearly establishes that the Constitutional\n\nDelegates intended that Montana’sjudiciary balance individual privacy and the merits of\n\npublic disclosure. 1 conclude that to construeMontana’sjudiciary as a “public body” would\n\ngive an unconstitutional effect to the right to know provision. If this Court ruled that its\n\n conferences were open to the public, the Court would violate the constitutional mandate,\n\n which is clearly established by the structure of the right to know provision and by its\n\n constitutional history, that this Court balance individual needsfor privacy with the merits of\n\n public disclosure. Again, in determining that the judiciary must balance those interests, the\n\n Constitutional Delegates recognized that the Court was no “public body” but rather was a\n\n\n                                               36\n\f                                                                                          .   #,   .\n\n\n\n\ndistinct branch of government.\n\n      I emphasizethat the dissenthas investedthe right to know provision with an absolute\n\nreach. Under the dissent’s interpretation, “public bodies” describe any group of people\n\norganized for a governmental purpose. If other parts of Montana’s Constitution were also\n\ninterpreted without regard for and independent of the structure of Montana’s Constitution,\n\nwe would have surprising results. Consider, for example, Article II, Section 12, which\n\nprovides in part that the right to bear arms “in defense of [one’s] own home, person, and\n\nproperty      shall not be called in question.” Art. II, Sec. 12, Mont. Const. (emphasis\n\nadded). If that constitutional provision were accorded an absolute reach, the phrase “shall\n\nnot be called in question” would enableindividuals to openly carry firearms in any situation\n\nor setting.j Defendants on trial for murder could insist upon the right to brandish firearms\n\nduring their trials. Consider, too, Article II, Section 13, which provides that “[a]11 elections\n\nshall be free and open, and no power, civil or military, shall at any time interfere to prevent\n\nthe i?eeexerciseof the right of suffrage.” Art. II, Sec. 13, Mont. Const. (emphasis added).\n\nIndividuals could read the phrase “shall [not] at any time interfere” to provide that they are\n\n free to vote whenever their consciencesdictate, in November or in August, and at any time\n\n of the day or night. I submit that Montana’s Constitution must be construed as a coherent\n\n integrated structure and that divesting phrasessuch as “public bodies” from their structured\n\n context also divests them of their intended and appropriate meanings.\n\n\n        3I recognize that this provision does not allow the carrying of concealed weapons.\n\n                                               31\n\f      Finally, the right to know provision upon which the dissentrelies in arguing for open\n\nconferences guaranteesnot only the right to “observe the deliberations of all public bodies\n\nor agenciesof state government” but also the right to “examine documents” of such public\n\nbodies. Art. II, Sec. 9, Mont. Const. If, as the dissent argues, the courts of this State are\n\nconsideredpublic bodies or agencies,then all internal working papers of the courts should\n\nbe subject to public examination. Thus, when a justice of this Court prepares a proposed\n\nopinion in a matter before the Court, that proposed opinion (historically circulated only to\n\nother justices) would have to be made available to the public. If the proposed opinion\n\npertainedto a matter of public concern,members of the public and interest groups would be\n\ninspired to support or oppose the proposed opinion by writing letters to the justices, by\n\nconducting a media blitz, or by appearing en masse at the court conference where the\n\nproposed opinion is to be discussed. Perhapsmore importantly, when parties to an appeal\n\nread such a proposed opinion, they will have seenthe proverbial “writing on the wall” and\n\nbe inclined to settle the case or take evasive action based on the views expressed in the\n\nproposed opinion, ignoring the fact that the votes could changein subsequentconferences\n\nwhen the proposed opinion is discussed. A defendant facing serious criminal charges who\n\nsees an adversepreliminary vote or proposed opinion may well jump bail or worse, again\n\nignoring the fact that a preliminary vote or opinion might not accurately reflect the final\n\npublished decision.\n\n       In contendingthat subjecting our decision making processto probing analysis by the\n\n\n                                              38\n\f                                                                                             >,       .\n                                                                                         ’        .\n\n\n\n\nnews media and to searchingexaminationby the public would benefit this Court, the dissent\n\nhas misconstrued the nature of judicial decision making and advanced the notion of an\n\nindependentyet receptive-to-public-opinionjudiciary that cannot withstand serious scrutiny.\n\nThis Court’s decisions already receive probing analysis by the media and searching\n\nexamination by the public. Every decision of this Court is published and available to the\n\npublic. Thus, there is a disingenuouscharacter to the dissent’s argument that this Court’s\n\nopinions will benefit from public scrutiny, becausethat public scrutiny occurs with every\n\ndecision of this Court. The real questionthen is not whether public scrutiny will benefit this\n\nCourt: as a matter of judicial tradition, public scrutiny attends every judicial decision.\n\nRather, the real question is whether public scrutiny of this Court’s private deliberations is\n\nappropriate. For all the reasonsthat I discuss elsewhere in this concurring opinion, I am\n\nconvinced that openingjudicial deliberationsto the public would damagethe independence\n\nof this Court as a separatebranch of government. Further, I believe that the dissent has\n\nembraced a rose-colored conception ofjudges that belies human reality. It cannot be true\n\nthat justices will be positively influenced by opening our deliberationsto the public yet also\n\nbe true that justices, as elected officials, will never be negatively influenced by inevitable\n\n pressures to make decisions based on political considerations rather than legal principles.\n\n 1 emphasizethat as a Court, we already receive the benefit of public scrutiny. There being\n\n no further benefit that we can anticipate, it would be senseless invite probing analysis of\n                                                                 to\n\n our deliberations by the news media and by concerned members of the public in the\n\n\n                                               39\n\fexpectation that we will, if we humanly can, turn a deaf ear to those analyses when\n\nconsidering proposed opinions and preliminary votes on pressing social issues. Were I a\n\nlitigant advocating an unpopular legal position, I would not want to advancemy cause in\n\nsuch an atmosphere.\n\n       In my view, the framers of our Constitution did not envision the deliberations of\n\njudges being made in such a politically charged environment. Furthermore, the framers\n\nwould not have chosento abandonthe centuries-old common-law tradition of confidential\n\njudicial deliberations without even five minutes of discussion to suggest that they intended\n\nsuch a momentous changein judicial decision making. In responding to concerns that the\n\nright to know provision might be interpreted to include juries, grand juries, and the\n\ndeliberations of the Supreme Court, Delegate Dahood opined that no “court could\n\nconceivably give that interpretation to ‘bodies.’ ” VII Montana Constitutional Convention,\n\nVerbatim Transcript, pp. 2499-2500. I agree with Justice Regnier that the absenceof any\n\nfarther discussion on this point indicates that the delegateswere persuaded by Delegate\n\nDahood’scomments and that they did not intend to take the unprecedented step of opening\n\njury and court deliberationsto the public. Although Justice Nelson eschewsthe suggestion\n\nthat his application of the right to know, without exception, necessarily extends to the\n\n opening ofjury deliberations, the fact is that juries clearly fit his definition of a public body\n\n subject to the right to know, in other words, a “group of individuals organized for a\n\n governmental purpose.”\n\n\n                                                40\n\f      To sum up, I do not believe that this or any other court may strip itself of the privacy\n\nof its judicial deliberations yet serve as an effective, independent and distinct branch of\n\ngovernment.    The common-law tradition of private judicial conferences reflects this\n\nfundamental truth. Openingjudicial conferencesto public observationwould thwart fruitful\n\ncandid discussion of issues; exposejustices to political pressures;and encourageparties to\n\nact upon conference votes and proposed opinions that often differ from final published\n\njudicial decisions. Moreover, establishedcanonsofjudicial construction, the interdependent\n\nstructure of Montana’sConstitution, andMontana’sConstitutional Convention history all lead\n\nto the conclusion that judicial deliberations fall outside the scope of the public’s right to\n\nknow. Contrary to the dissent, I am persuadedthat this conclusion strengthens the right to\n\nknow provision and its express concern for individual privacy interests.               As the\n\nConstitutional Delegates wisely acknowledged, an independentjudiciary is necessary to\n\nbalance interests in privacy and public disclosure.\n\n\n\n\n Chief Justice J. A.
