Hatter, District Judge, Presiding\n\n            Argued and Submitted August 30, 2017\n                    Pasadena, California\n\n                         Filed March 12, 2018\n\n Before: William A. Fletcher and Sandra S. Ikuta, Circuit\n     Judges, and Sarah Evans Barker,* District Judge.\n\n                  Opinion by Judge W. Fletcher\n\n\n\n\n     *\n       The Honorable Sarah Evans Barker, United States District Judge for\nthe Southern District of Indiana, sitting by designation.\n\f2              KING V. COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES\n\n                            SUMMARY**\n\n\n                             Civil Rights\n\n    The panel reversed the district court’s grant of summary\njudgment in favor of the County of Los Angeles and Sheriff\nBaca in his official capacity, and affirmed the district court’s\ngrant of summary judgment in favor of Sheriff Baca in his\nindividual capacity in an action brought pursuant to 42\nU.S.C. § 1983 by a civil detainee alleging that the conditions\nof his confinement violated substantive due process.\n\n    Plaintiff was incarcerated in a Los Angeles County jail for\nalmost eight years as a civil detainee while awaiting the\nadjudication of an involuntary commitment petition under\nCalifornia’s Sexually Violent Predator Act. For more than\nsix of his years in the County jail, plaintiff was confined in\nAdministrative Segregation along with criminal detainees.\n\n    Citing Jones v. Blanas, 393 F.3d 918, 931–35 (9th Cir.\n2004), the panel first noted that under the Due Process Clause\nof the Fourteenth Amendment, an individual detained under\ncivil process cannot be subjected to conditions that amount to\npunishment. Under Jones, conditions are presumptively\npunitive if (1) they are similar to those that a pre-trial\ndetainee’s criminal counterpart would face, and (2) are more\nrestrictive than conditions faced by individuals following\ncivil commitment. The panel then held that plaintiff’s\nconfinement triggered both of the presumptions set forth in\nJones. As to the first presumption, the panel concluded that\n\n    **\n       This summary constitutes no part of the opinion of the court. It has\nbeen prepared by court staff for the convenience of the reader.\n\f             KING V. COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES                     3\n\nsexually violent predator detainees in the Twin Towers\nCorrectional Facility were subject to essentially the same\nconditions of confinement as their criminal counterparts. As\nto the second presumption, the panel concluded that\nconditions in the sexually violent predator unit in the facility\nwere more restrictive than conditions at Coalinga State\nHospital. The panel further held that plaintiff’s confinement\nin administrative segregation also triggered both Jones’\npresumptions.\n\n    The panel held that on remand, the district court, in\nevaluating any rebuttal to the Jones presumptions, should\nconsider the conditions in the Los Angeles County jails to\ndetermine whether, given those conditions and the realities\nfacing the jail administrators, it is possible to rebut the Jones\npresumptions for sexually violent predator detainees held in\nthose jails.\n\n    In affirming the district court’s summary judgment in\nfavor of Sheriff Baca in his individual capacity, the panel\nheld that the record did not establish that Sheriff Baca\nsupervised the day-to-day operations of the correctional\nfacility, that he was personally involved in any constitutional\ndeprivation plaintiff may have suffered, or the requisite\ncausal connection for liability in his individual capacity.\n\n    The panel did not reach the question whether the district\ncourt was correct in its application of Younger v. Harris, 401\nU.S. 37 (1971), for plaintiff’s claim for injunctive relief has\nbeen mooted by his transfer to Coalinga State Hospital and by\nhis death in the fall of 2017. In light of plaintiff’s death\nduring the pendency of this appeal, the panel instructed the\nclerk of this court to hold the mandate for ninety days,\npending a motion for substitution of a personal representative\n\f4            KING V. COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES\n\nunder Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 43(a)(1). If no\nmotion for substitution was filed within ninety days, the panel\nheld that this appeal would be subject to dismissal as moot.\n\n\n                         COUNSEL\n\nAri J.

Mathevosian (argued) and Henry Patrick Nelson,\nNelson & Fulton, Los Angeles, California, for Defendants-\nAppellees.\n\n\n                         OPINION\n\nW. FLETCHER, Circuit Judge:\n\n    Plaintiff William King was incarcerated in a Los Angeles\nCounty jail for almost eight years, from November 2005 to\nAugust 2013, as a civil detainee while awaiting the\nadjudication of an involuntary commitment petition under\nCalifornia’s Sexually Violent Predator Act (“SVPA”). The\nreason for the extensive delay in adjudicating the petition\ndoes not appear in the record. For more than six of his years\nin the county jail, King was confined in Administrative\nSegregation (“AdSeg”) along with criminal detainees. As an\nSVP detainee, King was compelled to wear a distinctive red\nuniform that made clear that he had been convicted of a sex\ncrime. As a result, King was attacked in AdSeg by a criminal\n\f             KING V. COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES                  5\n\ninmate who slashed King’s cheek, chin, neck, and thigh with\na modified razor while shouting, “Die, baby raper, die!”\n\n    King brought suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, contending\nthat his conditions of confinement violated substantive due\nprocess. See Jones v. Blanas, 393 F.3d 918, 931–35 (9th Cir.\n2004). He appeals a grant of summary judgment in favor of\nthe County of Los Angeles and Sheriff Leroy Baca\n(“Defendants”). We reverse as to King’s claims for damages\nagainst the County and against Sheriff Baca in his official\ncapacity. We affirm as to King’s claim for damages against\nSheriff Baca in his individual capacity. King died during the\npendency of this appeal, rendering moot his claim for\ninjunctive relief.\n\n                       I. Background\n\n    Because this case was resolved at summary judgment, we\nrelate the facts in the light most favorable to King, the non-\nmoving party. See Holmes v. Cal. Army Nat’l Guard, 124\nF.3d 1126, 1131–32 (9th Cir. 1997). Because King was pro\nse, we consider as evidence all factual statements made in\nmotions and pleadings that were based on his personal\nknowledge, admissible in evidence, and attested to under\npenalty of perjury. Jones, 393 F.3d at 923.\n\n    The SVPA authorizes the civil commitment of “sexually\nviolent predator[s].” See Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code §§ 6600.05,\n6604. A “sexually violent predator” is a “person who has\nbeen convicted of a sexually violent offense against one or\nmore victims and who has a diagnosed mental disorder that\nmakes the person a danger to the health and safety of others\nin that it is likely that he or she will engage in sexually\nviolent criminal behavior.” Id. § 6600. Inmates held during\n\f6            KING V. COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES\n\nthe pendency of SVPA commitment proceedings are civil\ndetainees. Jones, 393 F.3d at 922.\n\n    In November 2005, a petition was filed to commit King\nunder the SVPA, and a successive petition was filed in 2007.\nKing had previously served sentences for two rape\nconvictions. Pending the resolution of the petition, King was\ndetained at the Twin Towers Correctional Facility (“TTCF”),\na Los Angeles County jail. TTCF houses SVP detainees in\nthe jail’s SVP unit.\n\n    The SVP unit consists of one or more “pods” in a\n“module,” or section, of TTCF. A pod in the SVP unit\ncontains sixteen two-person cells in which detainees sleep,\nand a communal day room. In the day room are eight metal\ntables, each with four attached metal stools, and a television.\nThe floor is concrete. The television is encased in a metal\nand plexiglass box. For a time, the day room contained\nportable bunks on which several detainees, including King,\nslept. Finally, each module has a single room with one large\nwindow facing outside and covered by a metal-wire mesh\nscreen, for detainees’ “outdoor recreation.”\n\n    Detainees in the SVP unit were housed separately from\nthe jail’s criminal population, but were subject to essentially\nthe same regime. Except during the holidays, SVP detainees\nwere locked in their cells at night. SVP detainees were not\nallowed to make or receive direct telephone calls. They were\nnot allowed to have “contact visits” with anyone, including\nfamily members. They were not allowed to possess property\nsuch as personal radios, televisions, computers, telephones,\nand athletic shoes and clothing. They were not allowed direct\naccess to photocopy machines, even if they were representing\nthemselves in legal proceedings.\n\f             KING V. COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES                  7\n\n    “As a courtesy,” SVP detainees received a few\n“privileges” that were not available to the criminal detainee\npopulation. Jail regulations provided, “Upon availability, and\nas a courtesy, SVP inmates may be issued one extra blanket.”\n “As a courtesy, SVP inmates may receive hot water servings\nduring [the] AM shift and at the discretion of module staff.”\n“As a courtesy, plastic chairs are permitted in the SVP inmate\npod and shall not be assigned to any particular inmate. No\nmore than 10 chairs are permitted in the pod at any given\ntime. Chairs will be permitted after the morning meal and\nshall be removed from the pod at 2130 hours.” “As a\ncourtesy, each SVP inmate may retain a cardboard property\nbox, green property bag and 3 file folders for the storage of\nlegal material.”       “As a courtesy, daily television\nprogramming may be scheduled by SVP inmates.” “As a\ncourtesy, SVP inmates are permitted visits seven days a\nweek, but no more than two thirty-minute visits per week.”\nDuring such visits, “SVP inmates shall be handcuffed to the\nsingle-cuff chain attached to the visiting stool.”\n\n    The precise dates King was housed in the SVP unit are\nnot entirely clear. For purposes of this opinion, we rely on\nKing’s “Inmate Information” log maintained by TTCF.\nAccording to the log, King was housed in the SVP unit from\nNovember 2005 until February 2006, and again from March\n2007 to February 2008, for a total of a year and three months.\n\n    For the remainder of his time at TTCF, King was\nconfined in AdSeg along with criminal detainees, in\nconditions indistinguishable from theirs. Detention in AdSeg\nwas highly restrictive. AdSeg inmates were housed in single-\nperson cells and had “their dayroom time alone.” Inmates\nwere handcuffed when moved out of their cells. They were\nnot allowed out of their cells for religious services.\n\f8            KING V. COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES\n\nAccording to official jail policy, they were given “a minimum\nof three hours of [outdoor] exercise and recreation . . . over a\nperiod of seven days.” According to King, however, he was\nnever let out of his cell for “more than thirty minutes a day to\nshower and make a brief phone call.”\n\n    According to his “Inmate Information” log, King spent\njust over a year in AdSeg, from February 2006 to March\n2007. After less than a year back in the SVP unit, he was\nreturned to AdSeg in February 2008, where he remained until\nAugust 2013. His total time in AdSeg was about six and a\nhalf years.\n\n    Defendants claim that King was kept in AdSeg because of\nhis “violent tendencies.” During King’s time at TTCF, he\nwas involved in several disciplinary incidents, and was\neventually designated as a “High Security K-10” status\ninmate. According to one of the Sheriff’s deputies, “[a] K-\n10 classification is utilized for inmates who, based on\nconfirmed information, require administrative segregation\nfrom the general population at all times.”\n\n    King provides evidence that, if believed, shows that he\nwas improperly given a K-10 classification. Among other\nthings, King asserts that another inmate lied to convince jail\nstaff that King was dangerous and violent, and that jail\nofficials did not follow appropriate procedures to determine\nthe truth of the inmate’s charges against King. Taking the\nfacts in the light most favorable to King, there is a genuine\nissue of material fact as to whether King displayed violent\ntendencies sufficient to justify assigning him to AdSeg.\n\n    King’s detention in AdSeg was particularly harsh because\nof his SVP detainee status. To distinguish types of detainees\n\f            KING V. COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES                  9\n\nand inmates, TTCF required uniforms of different colors.\nSVP detainees wore red uniforms. Juveniles were the only\nother inmates who wore red uniforms. King was almost sixty\nyears old in 2006, when he was first placed in AdSeg, which\nreadily distinguished him from juveniles. While in AdSeg,\nKing was threatened repeatedly with death for being a “child\nmolester.” Someone taped signs at or next to King’s cell,\nsingling him out as a “child molester.” One criminal inmate\n“spent his entire half-hour out-of-cell time exhorting other\nAd. Seg. residents to fulfill their [duty] to kill all child\nmolesters.” In November 2006, a criminal inmate attacked\nKing with a “makeshift knife” or “altered razor” while\nscreaming, “Die, baby raper, die!” King was cut on his left\ncheek, chin, neck, and thigh. King repeatedly requested that\nhe be returned to the SVP unit. After his placement in AdSeg\nin February 2008, his requests to return to the SVP unit were\nconsistently denied.\n\n    In April 2012, Defendants attempted to transfer King out\nof TTCF to Coalinga State Hospital (“Coalinga”), even\nthough his petition had not yet been adjudicated. Coalinga\nwas the designated hospital for persons committed as\n“sexually violent predators.” Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code\n§ 6600.05. For reasons unexplained in the record, after six\nand a half years of confinement in TTCF, King’s civil\ncommitment process still had not been completed. King\nfeared that consenting to the transfer to Coalinga would\nprejudice his ability to contest his civil commitment, and he\ntherefore informed the Mental Health Court that he wished to\nstay in TTCF pending the resolution of his petition. In\nAugust 2013, King was finally transferred to Coalinga.\n\n    To describe the conditions at Coalinga, we take judicial\nnotice of the undisputed and publicly available information\n\f10           KING V. COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES\n\ndisplayed on government websites. Daniels-Hall v. Nat’l\nEduc. Ass’n, 629 F.3d 992, 998–99 (9th Cir. 2010); see\nDepartment of State Hospitals – Coalinga, Cal. Dep’t of State\nHospitals, http://www.dsh.ca.gov/coalinga/ (hereinafter\n“Coalinga Website”). We do not consider the descriptions\noffered by King before he was transferred to Coalinga, as he\ndid not have personal knowledge of the facility at the time.\n\n    Conditions at Coalinga differ significantly from those at\nTTCF. SVPs at Coalinga are treated as “patients” by a staff\nthat includes “psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers,\nrehabilitation therapists, registered nurses, psychiatric\ntechnicians, and other medical and clinical staff.” Coalinga\nWebsite at Home. Patients live in dorms, not cells. Coalinga\nWebsite at Facilities. Patients may make and receive calls\nusing the public telephone in their unit, and the phone\nnumbers for these units are posted online. Coalinga Website\nat Family and Friend Resources, Visitor Information. As part\nof their treatment, patients are encouraged to have visits from\nfriends and family members. Coalinga Website at Visitor\nInformation. Patients may hug and kiss their visitors at the\nbeginning and end of each visit, and may hold hands during\nvisits. Id. Patients can receive packages from family\nmembers and vendors, and can possess “personal items” such\nas shoes and caps. Coalinga Website at Family and Friend\nResources, Statewide Contraband List.\n\n    At Coalinga, opportunities for recreation, education, and\nreligious practice are numerous. Inmates can gather and\ninteract at Coalinga’s large socialization courtyard, or the\nfacility’s eight smaller social courtyards, visitor’s courtyard,\nor eight landscaped atriums. Coalinga Website at Facilities.\nIndoor sports such as basketball, badminton, and volleyball\nare available in the gymnasium. Id. Outdoor sports are\n\f             KING V. COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES                  11\n\navailable in sixteen sports yards and in the baseball\n“courtyard.” Id. Religious services are provided in\nCoalinga’s two chapels, sweat lodge, and religious library.\nId. Weekly services, study groups, and religious counseling\nare offered. Id. Coalinga also has vocational workshops for\neducation, training, and production. Id. Coalinga uses its\nfacilities in a treatment program that seeks to cultivate\n“prosocial behaviors and [the] constructive use of leisure\ntime.” Coalinga Website at Treatment. As their treatment\nprogresses, “SVPs can petition annually for release, be\nrecommended for outpatient status by [Department of State\nHospitals] practitioners, or be determined to no longer meet\nSVP criteria.” Coalinga Website at Home.\n\n   King remained at Coalinga from August 2013 until his\ndeath in the fall of 2017, after we heard argument of this\nappeal.\n\n                    II. Procedural History\n\n    On November 23, 2010, King filed a pro se complaint\nagainst Defendants, alleging that the conditions of his\nconfinement in the SVP unit and in AdSeg violated his right\nto due process. He sought monetary damages and injunctive\nrelief under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\n\n   The district court dismissed as time barred King’s claims\nbased on his detention between November 2005 and January\n2006. For the remaining period, the district court granted\nsummary judgment in favor of Defendants. With respect to\nKing’s detention in the SVP unit, the district court found that\nKing had not provided admissible evidence of conditions at\nCoalinga, preventing the court from making the necessary\ncomparisons under Jones v. Blanas, 393 F.3d 918 (9th Cir.\n\f12           KING V. COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES\n\n2004). With respect to King’s detention in AdSeg, the court\nfound that there was no genuine issue of material fact as to\nwhether there was a legitimate, non-punitive justification for\nholding King in AdSeg, pointing to his alleged “violent\ntendencies.” The court rejected King’s claims against Sheriff\nBaca in his individual capacity on the additional ground that\nKing had not established a causal connection between Sheriff\nBaca’s conduct and King’s placement in AdSeg.\n\n    King appealed. We initially dismissed King’s appeal as\nuntimely, but subsequently vacated the dismissal order.\n\n                   III. Standard of Review\n\n    We review de novo a district court’s grant of summary\njudgment, considering the record in the light most favorable\nto the non-moving party. Jones, 393 F.3d at 922. Summary\njudgment must be reversed if “any rational trier of fact could\nresolve a material factual issue in favor of the nonmoving\nparty.” A.G. v. Paradise Valley Unified Sch. Dist. No. 69,\n815 F.3d 1195, 1202 (9th Cir. 2016). We also review de novo\na district court’s application of Younger abstention.\nGilbertson v. Albright, 381 F.3d 965, 982 n.19 (9th Cir. 2004)\n(en banc).\n\n                        IV. Discussion\n\n     Section 1983 provides:\n\n        Every person who, under color of any statute,\n        ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of\n        any State . . . subjects, or causes to be\n        subjected, any citizen of the United States . .\n        . to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or\n\f             KING V. COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES                    13\n\n        immunities secured by the Constitution and\n        laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an\n        action at law, suit in equity, or other proper\n        proceeding for redress[.]\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1983. “The purpose of § 1983 is to deter state\nactors from using the badge of their authority to deprive\nindividuals of their federally guaranteed rights.” McDade v.\nWest, 223 F.3d 1135, 1139 (9th Cir. 2000). To establish a\nclaim under § 1983, King must show the violation of a federal\nright by a person acting under color of state law. West v.\nAtkins, 487 U.S. 42, 48 (1988). To establish liability on the\npart of the County or Sheriff Baca in his official capacity,\nKing must show that a county policy or custom caused his\ninjury. See Monell v. Dep’t of Soc. Servs. of City of N.Y., 436\nU.S. 658, 690–91 (1978).\n\n                 A. Substantive Due Process\n\n    Under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment, “an individual detained under civil process . . .\ncannot be subjected to conditions that ‘amount to\npunishment.’” Jones, 393 F.3d at 932 (quoting Bell v.\nWolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 536 (1979)). We held in Jones that\nindividuals who are civilly detained pending commitment\nproceedings under the SVPA are “entitled to protections at\nleast as great as those afforded to a civilly committed\nindividual[.]” Id. Jones established two presumptions: First,\nconditions of confinement are presumptively punitive if they\nare “identical to, similar to, or more restrictive than, those in\nwhich [a civil pre-trial detainee’s] criminal counterparts are\nheld.” Id.; see also Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307,\n321–22 (1982) (requiring civil detainees be given “more\nconsiderate treatment” than criminal detainees). Second,\n\f14           KING V. COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES\n\nconditions of confinement are presumptively punitive if “an\nindividual awaiting SVPA adjudication is detained under\nconditions more restrictive than those the individual would\nface following SVPA commitment.” Jones, 393 F.3d at 933.\nIf either presumption applies, the burden shifts to the\ndefendant to show (1) “legitimate, non-punitive interests\njustifying the conditions of [the detainee’s] confinement” and\n(2) “that the restrictions imposed . . . [are] not ‘excessive’ in\nrelation to these interests.” Id. at 935.\n\n                 1. The Jones Presumptions\n\n       We hold that King’s confinement in the SVP unit triggers\nboth of the Jones presumptions. As to the first presumption,\ncomparing the conditions of confinement in the SVP unit “to\n. . . those in which [the SVP detainees’] criminal counterparts\n[we]re held” in TTCF, we conclude that conditions were\n“similar.” Id. at 932. The only difference between the\nconditions of confinement for SVP detainees and their\ncriminal counterparts was that SVP detainees were provided\nspecified “privileges,” not as a right but “as a courtesy”: an\nextra blanket “upon availability”; “hot water servings” at the\ndiscretion of staff; “no more than” ten plastic chairs in the\nday room during the day; “a cardboard box, a green property\nbag and 3 file folders”; the ability to schedule television\nprogramming; and no-contact thirty-minute visits twice a\nweek while chained to a metal stool. These “privileges” did\nnot change the basic nature of the SVP detainees’\nincarceration in TTCF. The reality was that SVP detainees in\nTTCF were subject to essentially the same conditions of\nconfinement as their criminal counterparts. They were\nconfined to their pod; they were not allowed outside and were\nexposed to fresh air only through a screened window; and\n\f             KING V. COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES                  15\n\nthey were given minimal opportunity for recreation and\nexercise.\n\n    As to the second presumption, comparing the conditions\nof confinement for those “awaiting SVPA adjudication” to\nthose “following SVPA commitment,” we conclude that\nconditions in the SVP unit in TTCF were “more restrictive”\nthan conditions at Coalinga. Id. at 933. The comparison\nbetween the two facilities is so stark that we need not belabor\nthe point.\n\n    We hold, further, that King’s confinement in AdSeg also\ntriggers both presumptions. As to the first presumption, the\nconditions in AdSeg to which King was subjected were\n“substantially more restrictive” than even the conditions\nfaced by the jail’s general criminal population. Id. at 934.\nFor King, they were especially harsh, as he was required to\nwear a red uniform, signaling that he was an SVP detainee\nand therefore, in the view of some of the criminal detainees,\na child molester or rapist. As a direct result, King was\nviciously attacked while in AdSeg. As to the second\npresumption, the conditions in AdSeg were vastly different\nfrom the conditions at Coalinga.\n\n         2. Legitimate, Non-Punitive Justifications\n\n    The Jones presumptions can be rebutted by showing\n“legitimate, non-punitive government interests,” and by\nshowing that restrictions are not “excessive in relation to\nthose interests.” Id. at 932, 935. Such interests “include\nensuring a detainee’s presence at trial, maintaining jail\nsecurity, and effective management of a detention facility.”\nId. at 932. A defendant must “identify the specific\npenological interests involved and then demonstrate both that\n\f16           KING V. COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES\n\nthose specific interests are the actual bases for their policies\nand that the policies are reasonably related to the furtherance\nof the identified interests.” See Walker v. Sumner, 917 F.2d\n382, 386 (9th Cir. 1990). Even if legitimate, non-punitive\ninterests are identified, conditions of confinement may still be\n“excessive” if they are “employed to achieve objectives that\ncould be accomplished in so many alternative and less harsh\nmethods.” Jones, 393 F.3d at 934 (quoting Hallstrom v. City\nof Garden City, 991 F.2d 1473, 1484 (9th Cir. 1993)). King\nhas asked us to remand to the district court to require\nDefendants to offer such rebuttal.\n\n    In evaluating any rebuttal to the Jones presumptions on\nremand, the district court should consider the conditions in\nthe Los Angeles County jails to determine whether, given\nthose conditions and the realities facing the jail\nadministrators, it is possible to rebut the Jones presumptions\nfor SVP detainees held in those jails. Compare Lynch v.\nBaxley, 744 F.2d 1452, 1458, 1462 (11th Cir. 1984) (holding\nthat in light of the harsh conditions in Alabama’s jails, and\ngiven that even “[t]emporary confinement in jail is\nparticularly harmful to those who are mentally ill,”\nindividuals awaiting civil commitment proceedings must “be\ndetained in the nearest state, regional, community, county or\nprivate hospital or mental health facility which provides\nquarters for mentally ill patients”). The district court should\nalso take into consideration the extended period during which\nKing was held in TTCF. It is one thing to confine an SVP\ndetainee in a county jail for a few months while awaiting\nadjudication of a civil commitment petition. For such brief\nperiods, it may be justifiable to hold him in an SVP unit and\nto subject him to many of the jail’s rules and policies.\nFurther, if during that period he commits a serious\ndisciplinary infraction, it may be permissible to confine him\n\f             KING V. COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES                   17\n\nfor a limited time in AdSeg, as long as appropriate procedural\nprotections are provided before such confinement. However,\nit is quite another thing to confine an SVP detainee for an\nextended period in a county jail’s SVP unit or AdSeg. In this\ncase, King was confined as a civil detainee in TTCF for\nalmost eight years—in the SVP unit for a year and three\nmonths, and in AdSeg for six and a half years.\n\n B. Liability of the County and Sheriff Baca in His Official\n                          Capacity\n\n     A county is subject to Section 1983 liability “if its\npolicies, whether set by the government’s lawmakers or by\nthose whose edicts or acts . . . may fairly be said to represent\nofficial policy, caused the particular constitutional violation\nat issue.” Streit v. County of Los Angeles, 236 F.3d 552, 559\n(9th Cir. 2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). The Los\nAngeles County Sheriff, “when functioning as the\nadministrator of the local jail, is a County actor.” Id. at 565.\nThus, Sheriff Baca may be held liable in his official capacity\nfor the policies and practices of the county jails under his\nadministrative control. Cortez v. County of Los Angeles, 294\nF.3d 1186, 1190–92 (9th Cir. 2002).\n\n    The conditions of King’s confinement were governed by\ntwo Unit Orders issued by the Sheriff’s Department. First,\nUnit Order 5-17-310 established TTCF’s SVP unit policy,\nextending generally applicable jail restrictions to inmates in\nthe SVP unit and authorizing certain “courtesy” privileges.\nSecond, Unit Order 5-17-011 established TTCF’s AdSeg\npolicy, including criteria for holding inmates in AdSeg and\nrestrictions on AdSeg inmates. These policies “guided, or at\nleast governed” the actions of TTCF officials in their\ntreatment of King. Id. at 1190. As a result, the County and\n\f18            KING V. COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES\n\nSheriff Baca in his official capacity may be held liable in\ndamages for any aspect of King’s detention that violated the\nDue Process Clause.\n\n     C. Liability of Sheriff Baca in His Individual Capacity\n\n    A county official sued in his individual capacity may be\nheld liable as a supervisor under § 1983 “if there exists either\n(1) his or her personal involvement in the constitutional\ndeprivation, or (2) a sufficient causal connection between the\nsupervisor’s wrongful conduct and the constitutional\nviolation.” Starr v. Baca, 652 F.3d 1202, 1207 (9th Cir.\n2011) (quoting Hansen v. Black, 885 F.2d 642, 646 (9th Cir.\n1989)). “The requisite causal connection [for liability in a\ndefendant’s individual capacity] can be established . . . by\n[the defendant] setting in motion a series of acts by others, or\nby knowingly refus[ing] to terminate a series of acts by\nothers, which [the supervisor] knew or reasonably should\nhave known would cause others to inflict a constitutional\ninjury.” Id. at 1207–08 (quoting Dubner v. City & Cty. of\nS.F., 266 F.3d 959, 968 (9th Cir. 2001)) (internal citation and\nquotation marks omitted). The record in this case does not\nestablish that Sheriff Baca supervised the day-to-day\noperations of TTCF, that he was personally involved in any\nconstitutional deprivation King may have suffered, or the\nrequisite causal connection for liability in his individual\ncapacity.\n\n                    D. Younger Abstention\n\n    Defendants argue that we should abstain under Younger\nv. Harris, 401 U.S. 37 (1971). Younger established a “strong\nfederal policy against federal-court interference with\npending state judicial proceedings absent extraordinary\n\f             KING V. COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES                   19\n\ncircumstances.” Middlesex Cty. Ethics Comm. v. Garden\nState Bar Ass’n, 457 U.S. 423, 431 (1982). This policy\napplies to criminal judicial proceedings and civil judicial\nproceedings that implicate important state interests. Id. at\n432.\n\n    The district court applied Younger abstention to deny\nrelief only “[t]o the extent [King] seeks removal from Ad-\nSeg.” We do not reach the question whether the district court\nwas correct in this application of Younger, for King’s claim\nfor injunctive relief has been mooted by his transfer to\nCoalinga in August 2013, and by his death in the fall of 2017.\nFor the remaining claims for damages, the most that Younger\ncould possibly require is a stay pending the completion of the\nstate proceedings, see Gilbertson, 381 F.3d at 968, but there\nare no pending state proceedings.\n\n                  E. Substitution of Parties\n\n    In light of King’s death during the pendency of this\nappeal, we instruct the clerk of this court to hold the mandate\nfor ninety days, pending a motion for substitution of a\npersonal representative under Federal Rule of Appellate\nProcedure 43(a)(1). If no motion for substitution is filed\nwithin ninety days, this appeal is subject to dismissal as moot.\n\n                         Conclusion\n\n    Involuntary civil commitment is a “massive curtailment\nof liberty” that requires the protections of due process.\nUnited States v. Budell, 187 F.3d 1137, 1141 (9th Cir. 1999)\n(quoting Humphrey v. Cady, 405 U.S. 504, 509 (1972)). We\nreverse the district court’s grant of summary judgment in\nfavor of the County and Sheriff Baca in his official capacity,\n\f20           KING V. COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES\n\nand affirm the district court’s grant in favor of Sheriff Baca\nin his individual capacity.        We remand for further\nproceedings.\n\n    REVERSED in part, AFFIRMED in part, and\nREMANDED.\n\f",

FLETCHER, Circuit Judge:\n\n    Plaintiff William King was incarcerated in a Los Angeles\nCounty jail for almost eight years, from November 2005 to\nAugust 2013, as a civil detainee while awaiting the\nadjudication of an involuntary commitment petition under\nCalifornia’s Sexually Violent Predator Act (“SVPA”). The\nreason for the extensive delay in adjudicating the petition\ndoes not appear in the record. For more than six of his years\nin the county jail, King was confined in Administrative\nSegregation (“AdSeg”) along with criminal detainees. As an\nSVP detainee, King was compelled to wear a distinctive red\nuniform that made clear that he had been convicted of a sex\ncrime. As a result, King was attacked in AdSeg by a criminal\n\f             KING V. COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES                  5\n\ninmate who slashed King’s cheek, chin, neck, and thigh with\na modified razor while shouting, “Die, baby raper, die!”\n\n    King brought suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, contending\nthat his conditions of confinement violated substantive due\nprocess. See Jones v. Blanas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"788793\"><a href=\"/opinion/788793/oscar-w-jones-v-lou-blanas-county-of-sacramento/\"><span class=\"volume\">393</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">918</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 931–35 (9th Cir.\n2004). He appeals a grant of summary judgment in favor of\nthe County of Los Angeles and Sheriff Leroy Baca\n(“Defendants”). We reverse as to King’s claims for damages\nagainst the County and against Sheriff Baca in his official\ncapacity. We affirm as to King’s claim for damages against\nSheriff Baca in his individual capacity. King died during the\npendency of this appeal, rendering moot his claim for\ninjunctive relief.\n\n                       I. Background\n\n    Because this case was resolved at summary judgment, we\nrelate the facts in the light most favorable to King, the non-\nmoving party. See Holmes v. Cal. Army Nat’l Guard, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1126</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1131–32 (9th Cir. 1997). Because King was pro\nse, we consider as evidence all factual statements made in\nmotions and pleadings that were based on his personal\nknowledge, admissible in evidence, and attested to under\npenalty of perjury. Jones, 393 F.3d at 923.\n\n    The SVPA authorizes the civil commitment of “sexually\nviolent predator[s].” See Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code §§ 6600.05,\n6604. A “sexually violent predator” is a “person who has\nbeen convicted of a sexually violent offense against one or\nmore victims and who has a diagnosed mental disorder that\nmakes the person a danger to the health and safety of others\nin that it is likely that he or she will engage in sexually\nviolent criminal behavior.” Id. § 6600. Inmates held during\n\f6            KING V. COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES\n\nthe pendency of SVPA commitment proceedings are civil\ndetainees. Jones, 393 F.3d at 922.\n\n    In November 2005, a petition was filed to commit King\nunder the SVPA, and a successive petition was filed in 2007.\nKing had previously served sentences for two rape\nconvictions. Pending the resolution of the petition, King was\ndetained at the Twin Towers Correctional Facility (“TTCF”),\na Los Angeles County jail. TTCF houses SVP detainees in\nthe jail’s SVP unit.\n\n    The SVP unit consists of one or more “pods” in a\n“module,” or section, of TTCF. A pod in the SVP unit\ncontains sixteen two-person cells in which detainees sleep,\nand a communal day room. In the day room are eight metal\ntables, each with four attached metal stools, and a television.\nThe floor is concrete. The television is encased in a metal\nand plexiglass box. For a time, the day room contained\nportable bunks on which several detainees, including King,\nslept. Finally, each module has a single room with one large\nwindow facing outside and covered by a metal-wire mesh\nscreen, for detainees’ “outdoor recreation.”\n\n    Detainees in the SVP unit were housed separately from\nthe jail’s criminal population, but were subject to essentially\nthe same regime. Except during the holidays, SVP detainees\nwere locked in their cells at night. SVP detainees were not\nallowed to make or receive direct telephone calls. They were\nnot allowed to have “contact visits” with anyone, including\nfamily members. They were not allowed to possess property\nsuch as personal radios, televisions, computers, telephones,\nand athletic shoes and clothing. They were not allowed direct\naccess to photocopy machines, even if they were representing\nthemselves in legal proceedings.\n\f             KING V. COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES                  7\n\n    “As a courtesy,” SVP detainees received a few\n“privileges” that were not available to the criminal detainee\npopulation. Jail regulations provided, “Upon availability, and\nas a courtesy, SVP inmates may be issued one extra blanket.”\n “As a courtesy, SVP inmates may receive hot water servings\nduring [the] AM shift and at the discretion of module staff.”\n“As a courtesy, plastic chairs are permitted in the SVP inmate\npod and shall not be assigned to any particular inmate. No\nmore than 10 chairs are permitted in the pod at any given\ntime. Chairs will be permitted after the morning meal and\nshall be removed from the pod at 2130 hours.” “As a\ncourtesy, each SVP inmate may retain a cardboard property\nbox, green property bag and 3 file folders for the storage of\nlegal material.”       “As a courtesy, daily television\nprogramming may be scheduled by SVP inmates.” “As a\ncourtesy, SVP inmates are permitted visits seven days a\nweek, but no more than two thirty-minute visits per week.”\nDuring such visits, “SVP inmates shall be handcuffed to the\nsingle-cuff chain attached to the visiting stool.”\n\n    The precise dates King was housed in the SVP unit are\nnot entirely clear. For purposes of this opinion, we rely on\nKing’s “Inmate Information” log maintained by TTCF.\nAccording to the log, King was housed in the SVP unit from\nNovember 2005 until February 2006, and again from March\n2007 to February 2008, for a total of a year and three months.\n\n    For the remainder of his time at TTCF, King was\nconfined in AdSeg along with criminal detainees, in\nconditions indistinguishable from theirs. Detention in AdSeg\nwas highly restrictive. AdSeg inmates were housed in single-\nperson cells and had “their dayroom time alone.” Inmates\nwere handcuffed when moved out of their cells. They were\nnot allowed out of their cells for religious services.\n\f8            KING V. COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES\n\nAccording to official jail policy, they were given “a minimum\nof three hours of [outdoor] exercise and recreation . . . over a\nperiod of seven days.” According to King, however, he was\nnever let out of his cell for “more than thirty minutes a day to\nshower and make a brief phone call.”\n\n    According to his “Inmate Information” log, King spent\njust over a year in AdSeg, from February 2006 to March\n2007. After less than a year back in the SVP unit, he was\nreturned to AdSeg in February 2008, where he remained until\nAugust 2013. His total time in AdSeg was about six and a\nhalf years.\n\n    Defendants claim that King was kept in AdSeg because of\nhis “violent tendencies.” During King’s time at TTCF, he\nwas involved in several disciplinary incidents, and was\neventually designated as a “High Security K-10” status\ninmate. According to one of the Sheriff’s deputies, “[a] K-\n10 classification is utilized for inmates who, based on\nconfirmed information, require administrative segregation\nfrom the general population at all times.”\n\n    King provides evidence that, if believed, shows that he\nwas improperly given a K-10 classification. Among other\nthings, King asserts that another inmate lied to convince jail\nstaff that King was dangerous and violent, and that jail\nofficials did not follow appropriate procedures to determine\nthe truth of the inmate’s charges against King. Taking the\nfacts in the light most favorable to King, there is a genuine\nissue of material fact as to whether King displayed violent\ntendencies sufficient to justify assigning him to AdSeg.\n\n    King’s detention in AdSeg was particularly harsh because\nof his SVP detainee status. To distinguish types of detainees\n\f            KING V. COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES                  9\n\nand inmates, TTCF required uniforms of different colors.\nSVP detainees wore red uniforms. Juveniles were the only\nother inmates who wore red uniforms. King was almost sixty\nyears old in 2006, when he was first placed in AdSeg, which\nreadily distinguished him from juveniles. While in AdSeg,\nKing was threatened repeatedly with death for being a “child\nmolester.” Someone taped signs at or next to King’s cell,\nsingling him out as a “child molester.” One criminal inmate\n“spent his entire half-hour out-of-cell time exhorting other\nAd. Seg. residents to fulfill their [duty] to kill all child\nmolesters.” In November 2006, a criminal inmate attacked\nKing with a “makeshift knife” or “altered razor” while\nscreaming, “Die, baby raper, die!” King was cut on his left\ncheek, chin, neck, and thigh. King repeatedly requested that\nhe be returned to the SVP unit. After his placement in AdSeg\nin February 2008, his requests to return to the SVP unit were\nconsistently denied.\n\n    In April 2012, Defendants attempted to transfer King out\nof TTCF to Coalinga State Hospital (“Coalinga”), even\nthough his petition had not yet been adjudicated. Coalinga\nwas the designated hospital for persons committed as\n“sexually violent predators.” Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code\n§ 6600.05. For reasons unexplained in the record, after six\nand a half years of confinement in TTCF, King’s civil\ncommitment process still had not been completed. King\nfeared that consenting to the transfer to Coalinga would\nprejudice his ability to contest his civil commitment, and he\ntherefore informed the Mental Health Court that he wished to\nstay in TTCF pending the resolution of his petition. In\nAugust 2013, King was finally transferred to Coalinga.\n\n    To describe the conditions at Coalinga, we take judicial\nnotice of the undisputed and publicly available information\n\f10           KING V. COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES\n\ndisplayed on government websites. Daniels-Hall v. Nat’l\nEduc.

Procedural History\n\n    On November 23, 2010, King filed a pro se complaint\nagainst Defendants, alleging that the conditions of his\nconfinement in the SVP unit and in AdSeg violated his right\nto due process. He sought monetary damages and injunctive\nrelief under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\n\n   The district court dismissed as time barred King’s claims\nbased on his detention between November 2005 and January\n2006. For the remaining period, the district court granted\nsummary judgment in favor of Defendants. With respect to\nKing’s detention in the SVP unit, the district court found that\nKing had not provided admissible evidence of conditions at\nCoalinga, preventing the court from making the necessary\ncomparisons under Jones v.

COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES\n\n2004). With respect to King’s detention in AdSeg, the court\nfound that there was no genuine issue of material fact as to\nwhether there was a legitimate, non-punitive justification for\nholding King in AdSeg, pointing to his alleged “violent\ntendencies.” The court rejected King’s claims against Sheriff\nBaca in his individual capacity on the additional ground that\nKing had not established a causal connection between Sheriff\nBaca’s conduct and King’s placement in AdSeg.\n\n    King appealed. We initially dismissed King’s appeal as\nuntimely, but subsequently vacated the dismissal order.\n\n                   III.

To establish liability on the\npart of the County or Sheriff Baca in his official capacity,\nKing must show that a county policy or custom caused his\ninjury. See Monell v. Dep’t of Soc. Servs. of City of N.Y., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109881\"><a href=\"/opinion/109881/monell-v-new-york-city-dept-of-social-servs/\"><span class=\"volume\">436</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">658</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 690–91 (1978).\n\n                 A. Substantive Due Process\n\n    Under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment, “an individual detained under civil process . . .\ncannot be subjected to conditions that ‘amount to\npunishment.’” Jones, 393 F.3d at 932 (quoting Bell v.\nWolfish, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110075\"><a href=\"/opinion/110075/bell-v-wolfish/\"><span class=\"volume\">441</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">520</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 536 (1979)). We held in Jones that\nindividuals who are civilly detained pending commitment\nproceedings under the SVPA are “entitled to protections at\nleast as great as those afforded to a civilly committed\nindividual[.]” Id. Jones established two presumptions: First,\nconditions of confinement are presumptively punitive if they\nare “identical to, similar to, or more restrictive than, those in\nwhich [a civil pre-trial detainee’s] criminal counterparts are\nheld.” Id.; see also Youngberg v. Romeo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110746\"><a href=\"/opinion/110746/youngberg-v-romeo/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">307</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n321–22 (1982) (requiring civil detainees be given “more\nconsiderate treatment” than criminal detainees). Second,\n\f14           KING V. COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES\n\nconditions of confinement are presumptively punitive if “an\nindividual awaiting SVPA adjudication is detained under\nconditions more restrictive than those the individual would\nface following SVPA commitment.” Jones, 393 F.3d at 933.\nIf either presumption applies, the burden shifts to the\ndefendant to show (1) “legitimate, non-punitive interests\njustifying the conditions of [the detainee’s] confinement” and\n(2) “that the restrictions imposed . . . [are] not ‘excessive’ in\nrelation to these interests.” Id. at 935.\n\n                 1. The Jones Presumptions\n\n       We hold that King’s confinement in the SVP unit triggers\nboth of the Jones presumptions. As to the first presumption,\ncomparing the conditions of confinement in the SVP unit “to\n. . . those in which [the SVP detainees’] criminal counterparts\n[we]re held” in TTCF, we conclude that conditions were\n“similar.” Id. at 932. The only difference between the\nconditions of confinement for SVP detainees and their\ncriminal counterparts was that SVP detainees were provided\nspecified “privileges,” not as a right but “as a courtesy”: an\nextra blanket “upon availability”; “hot water servings” at the\ndiscretion of staff; “no more than” ten plastic chairs in the\nday room during the day; “a cardboard box, a green property\nbag and 3 file folders”; the ability to schedule television\nprogramming; and no-contact thirty-minute visits twice a\nweek while chained to a metal stool. These “privileges” did\nnot change the basic nature of the SVP detainees’\nincarceration in TTCF. The reality was that SVP detainees in\nTTCF were subject to essentially the same conditions of\nconfinement as their criminal counterparts. They were\nconfined to their pod; they were not allowed outside and were\nexposed to fresh air only through a screened window; and\n\f             KING V. COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES                  15\n\nthey were given minimal opportunity for recreation and\nexercise.\n\n    As to the second presumption, comparing the conditions\nof confinement for those “awaiting SVPA adjudication” to\nthose “following SVPA commitment,” we conclude that\nconditions in the SVP unit in TTCF were “more restrictive”\nthan conditions at Coalinga. Id. at 933. The comparison\nbetween the two facilities is so stark that we need not belabor\nthe point.\n\n    We hold, further, that King’s confinement in AdSeg also\ntriggers both presumptions. As to the first presumption, the\nconditions in AdSeg to which King was subjected were\n“substantially more restrictive” than even the conditions\nfaced by the jail’s general criminal population. Id. at 934.\nFor King, they were especially harsh, as he was required to\nwear a red uniform, signaling that he was an SVP detainee\nand therefore, in the view of some of the criminal detainees,\na child molester or rapist. As a direct result, King was\nviciously attacked while in AdSeg. As to the second\npresumption, the conditions in AdSeg were vastly different\nfrom the conditions at Coalinga.\n\n         2. Legitimate, Non-Punitive Justifications\n\n    The Jones presumptions can be rebutted by showing\n“legitimate, non-punitive government interests,” and by\nshowing that restrictions are not “excessive in relation to\nthose interests.” Id. at 932, 935. Such interests “include\nensuring a detainee’s presence at trial, maintaining jail\nsecurity, and effective management of a detention facility.”\nId. at 932. A defendant must “identify the specific\npenological interests involved and then demonstrate both that\n\f16           KING V. COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES\n\nthose specific interests are the actual bases for their policies\nand that the policies are reasonably related to the furtherance\nof the identified interests.” See Walker v. Sumner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"550359\"><a href=\"/opinion/550359/andrew-john-walker-v-george-w-sumner/\"><span class=\"volume\">917</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">382</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 386 (9th Cir. 1990). Even if legitimate, non-punitive\ninterests are identified, conditions of confinement may still be\n“excessive” if they are “employed to achieve objectives that\ncould be accomplished in so many alternative and less harsh\nmethods.” Jones, 393 F.3d at 934 (quoting Hallstrom v. City\nof Garden City, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"605587\"><a href=\"/opinion/605587/susan-hallstrom-robert-hallstrom-v-city-of-garden-city-randy-w-snapp-sgt/\"><span class=\"volume\">991</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1473</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1484 (9th Cir. 1993)). King\nhas asked us to remand to the district court to require\nDefendants to offer such rebuttal.\n\n    In evaluating any rebuttal to the Jones presumptions on\nremand, the district court should consider the conditions in\nthe Los Angeles County jails to determine whether, given\nthose conditions and the realities facing the jail\nadministrators, it is possible to rebut the Jones presumptions\nfor SVP detainees held in those jails. Compare Lynch v.\nBaxley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"442180\"><a href=\"/opinion/442180/jean-p-lynch-individually-and-on-behalf-of-all-persons-similarly/\"><span class=\"volume\">744</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1452</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1458, 1462 (11th Cir. 1984) (holding\nthat in light of the harsh conditions in Alabama’s jails, and\ngiven that even “[t]emporary confinement in jail is\nparticularly harmful to those who are mentally ill,”\nindividuals awaiting civil commitment proceedings must “be\ndetained in the nearest state, regional, community, county or\nprivate hospital or mental health facility which provides\nquarters for mentally ill patients”). The district court should\nalso take into consideration the extended period during which\nKing was held in TTCF. It is one thing to confine an SVP\ndetainee in a county jail for a few months while awaiting\nadjudication of a civil commitment petition. For such brief\nperiods, it may be justifiable to hold him in an SVP unit and\nto subject him to many of the jail’s rules and policies.\nFurther, if during that period he commits a serious\ndisciplinary infraction, it may be permissible to confine him\n\f             KING V. COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES                   17\n\nfor a limited time in AdSeg, as long as appropriate procedural\nprotections are provided before such confinement. However,\nit is quite another thing to confine an SVP detainee for an\nextended period in a county jail’s SVP unit or AdSeg. In this\ncase, King was confined as a civil detainee in TTCF for\nalmost eight years—in the SVP unit for a year and three\nmonths, and in AdSeg for six and a half years.\n\n B. Liability of the County and Sheriff Baca in His Official\n                          Capacity\n\n     A county is subject to Section 1983 liability “if its\npolicies, whether set by the government’s lawmakers or by\nthose whose edicts or acts . . . may fairly be said to represent\nofficial policy, caused the particular constitutional violation\nat issue.” Streit v. County of Los Angeles, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771618\"><a href=\"/opinion/771618/valerie-streit-individually-and-as-class-representative-diego-santillana/\"><span class=\"volume\">236</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">552</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 559\n(9th Cir. 2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). The Los\nAngeles County Sheriff, “when functioning as the\nadministrator of the local jail, is a County actor.” Id. at 565.\nThus, Sheriff Baca may be held liable in his official capacity\nfor the policies and practices of the county jails under his\nadministrative control. Cortez v. County of Los Angeles, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"778165\"><a href=\"/opinion/778165/moreno-avalos-cortez-mauricio-robert-avalos-terry-leach-lydia-avalos/\"><span class=\"volume\">294</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1186</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1190–92 (9th Cir. 2002).\n\n    The conditions of King’s confinement were governed by\ntwo Unit Orders issued by the Sheriff’s Department. First,\nUnit Order 5-17-310 established TTCF’s SVP unit policy,\nextending generally applicable jail restrictions to inmates in\nthe SVP unit and authorizing certain “courtesy” privileges.\nSecond, Unit Order 5-17-011 established TTCF’s AdSeg\npolicy, including criteria for holding inmates in AdSeg and\nrestrictions on AdSeg inmates. These policies “guided, or at\nleast governed” the actions of TTCF officials in their\ntreatment of King. Id. at 1190. As a result, the County and\n\f18            KING V. COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES\n\nSheriff Baca in his official capacity may be held liable in\ndamages for any aspect of King’s detention that violated the\nDue Process Clause.\n\n     C. Liability of Sheriff Baca in His Individual Capacity\n\n    A county official sued in his individual capacity may be\nheld liable as a supervisor under § 1983 “if there exists either\n(1) his or her personal involvement in the constitutional\ndeprivation, or (2) a sufficient causal connection between the\nsupervisor’s wrongful conduct and the constitutional\nviolation.” Starr v. Baca, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">652</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1202</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1207 (9th Cir.\n2011) (quoting Hansen v. Black, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"529383\"><a href=\"/opinion/529383/kathleen-hansen-v-ronald-l-black/\"><span class=\"volume\">885</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">642</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 646 (9th Cir.\n1989)). “The requisite causal connection [for liability in a\ndefendant’s individual capacity] can be established . . . by\n[the defendant] setting in motion a series of acts by others, or\nby knowingly refus[ing] to terminate a series of acts by\nothers, which [the supervisor] knew or reasonably should\nhave known would cause others to inflict a constitutional\ninjury.” Id. at 1207–08 (quoting Dubner v. City & Cty. of\nS.F., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"775072\"><a href=\"/opinion/775072/robin-a-dubner-v-city-and-county-of-san-francisco-michael-hennessey/\"><span class=\"volume\">266</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">959</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 968 (9th Cir. 2001)) (internal citation and\nquotation marks omitted). The record in this case does not\nestablish that Sheriff Baca supervised the day-to-day\noperations of TTCF, that he was personally involved in any\nconstitutional deprivation King may have suffered, or the\nrequisite causal connection for liability in his individual\ncapacity.\n\n                    D. Younger Abstention\n\n    Defendants argue that we should abstain under Younger\nv. Harris, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108263\"><a href=\"/opinion/108263/younger-v-harris/\"><span class=\"volume\">401</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1971). Younger established a “strong\nfederal policy against federal-court interference with\npending state judicial proceedings absent extraordinary\n\f             KING V. COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES                   19\n\ncircumstances.” Middlesex Cty. Ethics Comm. v.

This policy\napplies to criminal judicial proceedings and civil judicial\nproceedings that implicate important state interests. Id. at\n432.\n\n    The district court applied Younger abstention to deny\nrelief only “[t]o the extent [King] seeks removal from Ad-\nSeg.” We do not reach the question whether the district court\nwas correct in this application of Younger, for King’s claim\nfor injunctive relief has been mooted by his transfer to\nCoalinga in August 2013, and by his death in the fall of 2017.\nFor the remaining claims for damages, the most that Younger\ncould possibly require is a stay pending the completion of the\nstate proceedings, see Gilbertson, 381 F.3d at 968, but there\nare no pending state proceedings.\n\n                  E. Substitution of Parties\n\n    In light of King’s death during the pendency of this\nappeal, we instruct the clerk of this court to hold the mandate\nfor ninety days, pending a motion for substitution of a\npersonal representative under Federal Rule of Appellate\nProcedure 43(a)(1). If no motion for substitution is filed\nwithin ninety days, this appeal is subject to dismissal as moot.\n\n                         Conclusion\n\n    Involuntary civil commitment is a “massive curtailment\nof liberty” that requires the protections of due process.\nUnited States v.
