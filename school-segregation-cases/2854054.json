Anthony Riccardo, an\ninmate of the Centralia Correctional Center in Illinois,\nneeded a new cellmate after his former cellmate complained\nabout being housed with him. Normally that pairing would\nhave been made by Centralia’s placement office, but when\nthe evening of May 28, 1997, arrived and some inmates\nremained unassigned after the regular placement officers\nhad left, the task fell to Lt. Larry Rausch, who was serving\nthe second shift. Rausch matched Riccardo with Juan\nGarcia, a pairing that should have lasted only until the\nplacement officers on the day shift could review matters.\n\f2                                                No. 02-1961\n\nTwo days later Garcia sexually assaulted Riccardo, who\nsued Rausch under 42 U.S.C. §1983. A jury concluded that\nRausch had subjected Riccardo to cruel and unusual\npunishment and awarded $1.5 million in compensatory\ndamages. The district court entered judgment on this ver-\ndict, and Rausch appeals.\n  His lead-off argument is that Riccardo failed to use his\nadministrative remedies. If so, then 42 U.S.C. §1997e(a),\npart of the Prison Litigation Reform Act, forecloses this suit\neven though Riccardo challenges a discrete incident and\nwants a form of relief—money damages—that the ad-\nministrative process in Illinois does not provide. See Porter\nv. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516 (2002); Booth v. Churner, 532 U.S.\n731 (2001). Riccardo did file an administrative grievance,\nbut Rausch contends it was too late (in February 1998,\nwhile Illinois sets a limit of six months) and asked the state\nto prosecute Garcia rather than do anything about Rausch\nand the classification system.\n   Prisoners must follow state rules about the time and\ncontent of grievances. See Pozo v. McCaughtry, 286 F.3d\n1022 (7th Cir. 2002); Strong v. David, 297 F.3d 646 (7th Cir.\n2002). Failure to do this means failure to use (and thus to\nexhaust) available remedies. Yet the state’s administrative\napparatus did not reject Riccardo’s grievance as untimely;\nit accepted and denied the grievance on the merits. At the\ntime of these events, Illinois permitted a filing after six\nmonths when the prisoner had good cause, see 20 Ill.\nAdmin. Code §504.810 (1997). The official handling the\ngrievance must have found good cause; anyway, we held in\nPozo that, when a state treats a filing as timely and\nresolves it on the merits, the federal judiciary will not\nsecond-guess that action, for the grievance has served its\nfunction of alerting the state and inviting corrective action.\n286 F.3d at 1025.\n  As for the content of this grievance: true enough, its main\nobjective was to have Garcia prosecuted. (Riccardo deemed\n\fNo. 02-1961                                                 3\n\ninadequate Garcia’s punishment within the prison system.)\nBut it also at least hinted at problems in prison administra-\ntion. Riccardo wrote: “[T]he administration don’t [sic] do\nthere [sic] job. [A sexual assault] should’ve never [sic]\nhappen again.” This language is ambiguous. There are two\nprincipal ways to reduce the number of sexual assaults in\nprison: better steps ex ante to separate potential aggressors\nfrom potential victims; and harsher penalties ex post in\norder to deter future assaults. Riccardo did not distinguish\nbetween the two, and a prison administration receiving\nsuch a grievance should have considered both. Illinois has\nnot adopted any rule governing the level of detail required\nof prisoners’ grievances. “When the administrative rulebook\nis silent, a grievance suffices if it alerts the prison to the\nnature of the wrong for which redress is sought. As in a\nnotice-pleading system, the grievant need not lay out the\nfacts, articulate legal theories, or demand particular relief.\nAll the grievance need do is object intelligibly to some\nasserted shortcoming.” Strong, 297 F.3d at 650. The\ndocument that Riccardo filed is at the border of intelligibil-\nity; it is hard to imagine much less that a prisoner could do\nand still alert the prison; yet this grievance did complain\nthat Garcia had committed a rape and that “the administra-\ntion don’t do there job.” A generous construction of this\ngrievance would have induced the prison to consider the\npossibility that the guards could have prevented this\nassault. So we conclude that Riccardo exhausted the\nadministrative process. If Illinois wants grievances to be\nmore detailed, it must adopt appropriate regulations and\ninform prisoners what is required of them. Riccardo is\nentitled to a decision on the merits of his constitutional\nclaim.\n  Because Riccardo prevailed at trial, we recap the facts\nin the light most favorable to his position. Riccardo was\nanally raped by his cellmate at Cook County Jail, shortly\nafter his conviction for aggravated assault. When he arrived\n\f4                                                No. 02-1961\n\nat Centralia Correctional Center in November 1996, he told\nthe prison psychologist that he did not feel safe. After a\nstint in segregation for violating prison rules, Riccardo\ndeclined to return to the general population. He told guards\nthat a cellmate in the segregation unit had stolen some of\nhis property and objected to spending another day with that\ncellmate. He believed that the responsible inmate belonged\nto the Latin Kings gang and that the Latin Kings may have\nbeen preparing to kill him—though he did not say why he\nbelieved this. But Centralia allows inmates to veto housing\nwith persons they declare to be enemies, so the prison found\nRiccardo a new cellmate. When, after a few days, that\ncellmate objected to spending more time with Riccardo,\nanother pairing was required. (The segregation unit was too\ncrowded to permit Riccardo a cell of his own.)\n  During the afternoon of May 28, Garcia had offered\nto help Riccardo retrieve his stolen property. Riccardo took\nthis as an ill omen rather than as a genuine offer of assist-\nance and told Lt. Alemond that he feared for his life if celled\nwith Garcia. Although Alemond said that he would “take\ncare of it,” he did nothing—he did not either find a cellmate\nfor Riccardo or alert Lt. Rausch, Alemond’s replacement on\nthe next shift. About 9:30 that evening, Rausch brought\nGarcia to Riccardo’s cell and told him that Garcia was his\nnew cellmate. Before the cells were locked for the night,\nRiccardo sought out Rausch in private and told him that he\nbelieved that the Latin Kings had a “hit” out on him, and\nthat he feared for his life if celled with Garcia. Rausch\nreplied that there was no place else to put Garcia (or\nRiccardo) that evening, and that he could not refuse\nhousing while in segregation. Rausch then brought Riccardo\nand Garcia back together and asked each, in turn, if he had\na problem with the other. Riccardo shook his head in the\nnegative. Rausch took that as agreement to the assignment.\nThat was Riccardo’s last contact with Rausch. As we have\nmentioned, nothing untoward happened that evening or the\n\fNo. 02-1961                                               5\n\nnext, but during the evening of May 30 Garcia compelled\nRiccardo to perform oral sex. The record does not suggest\nthat this assault had any connection to the Latin Kings.\nDuring the time between assignment and assault, Riccardo\ndid not ask for a different cellmate (though he did file two\ngrievances on May 29 about other matters). Circumstances\nbrought out at trial suggest that other guards should have\nrecognized on May 30 that problems had developed between\nRiccardo and Garcia; their failure to intervene may be\nculpable but cannot be attributed to Rausch, whose liability\ndepends exclusively on his actions the evening of May 28.\n  Rausch did not assault Riccardo and is not vicariously\nliable for Garcia’s crime. Like other guards, however,\nRausch was required to refrain from placing Riccardo in\nharm’s way gratuitously. The qualification “gratuitously” is\nimportant, because prisons are dangerous places. Inmates\nget there by violent acts, and many prisoners have a\npropensity to commit more. Guards cannot turn away\npersons committed by the courts; nor do individual guards\nhave any control over crowding and other systemic cir-\ncumstances. All that can be expected is that guards act\nresponsibly under the circumstances that confront them.\nSee McGill v. Duckworth, 944 F.2d 344 (7th Cir. 1991). A\nguard may be responsible without being credulous. Some\nprisoners are manipulative and cry “wolf” in an effort to\nhave a cell to themselves or choose a favored cellmate.\nOther prisoners perceive specters in every shadow, even\nthough their fears are unsupported. (There is, for example,\nno reason to think that the Latin Kings ever had it in for\nRiccardo. He did not belong to a rival gang, and there is no\nhistory of violent or overtly hostile encounters between\nRiccardo and any gang member.) Guards therefore must\ndiscriminate between serious risks of harm and feigned or\nimagined ones, which is not an easy task given the brief\ntime and scant information available to make each of the\nmany decisions that fill every day’s work.\n\f6                                                No. 02-1961\n\n  The eighth amendment does not demand that guards\nperform this task flawlessly. It does not even hold them to\nthe negligence standard. Liability is possible, instead, only\nwhen a guard is deliberately indifferent to a substantial\nrisk of serious harm. See Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S.\n25 (1993); Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. 294 (1991); Estelle\nv. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97 (1976). “Deliberate indifference”\nmeans subjective awareness. See Farmer v. Brennan,\n511 U.S. 825 (1994). It is not enough, the Court held in\nFarmer, that the guard ought to have recognized the risk.\nInstead, “the official must both be aware of facts from which\nthe inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of\nserious harm exists, and he must also draw the inference.”\nId. at 837.\n  Rausch contends that Riccardo did not face a “substantial\nrisk of serious harm” from Garcia on the evening of May 28,\n1997; that, if such a risk was present, Rausch did not\nappreciate its existence; and that at all events he is entitled\nto qualified immunity because reasonable officers would not\nnecessarily have understood that the law clearly required\nRiccardo and Garcia to be in separate cells. The first two\nmatters (the objective and subjective components of the\neighth amendment) are for the jury in the first instance,\nwith appellate review limited to the question whether any\nreasonable juror could have found that the requisite level of\nrisk existed, and that Rausch knew it. Immunity, however,\nis a matter of law for the court, to be decided without\ndeference to the jury’s resolution—and preferably before the\ncase goes to the jury. See Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 202\n(2001); Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635 (1987). The\ndistrict court brushed aside Rausch’s invocation of immu-\nnity, writing that a guard cannot benefit from immunity if\nthe action taken was not a reasonable response to a risk\nactually foreseen. That approach, which merges immunity\nand the merits, is incompatible with Saucier and its\npredecessors. See 533 U.S. at 203-06. Immunity protects\n\fNo. 02-1961                                                  7\n\nofficials who act at the “hazy border” (id. at 206) between\nthe lawful and the forbidden. That Rausch may have\noverstepped the line does not mean that every reasonable\nofficer would have been bound to know that Rausch acted\nimproperly. We need not pursue the immunity defense,\nhowever, because Saucier calls on appellate courts to\naddress the merits first, see id. at 201, and Rausch is\nentitled to prevail outright: no reasonable juror could have\nconcluded, on this record, that Rausch actually recognized\nthat placing Garcia and Riccardo together exposed Riccardo\nto substantial risk.\n   Now it might seem that Rausch had to appreciate\nthe risk, because (a) Riccardo claimed to fear for his life\nif celled with any member of the Latin Kings, and (b) Garcia\nin fact harmed Riccardo. One problem with relying on how\nthings turned out to show knowledge of risk beforehand\nis that Garcia did not act for the Latin Kings; he told\nRiccardo that he was fulfilling a personal fantasy,\nand Riccardo believed this explanation. Thus the risk\nthat Riccardo professed to fear (a “hit”) did not come to\npass. Even under the law of negligence, this is an important\ndistinction. If a school district entrusts a bus to a driver\nwith a bad drinking record, and the tipsy driver runs the\nbus off the road while speeding, the school district is liable;\nbut if instead there is an accident for which the driver is not\nat fault (a tree falls on bus), or the driver collapses of a\nheart attack while on the road, the district is not liable,\nbecause that was not the type of risk created or increased\nby the negligent conduct even though hiring this particular\ndriver was in the causal chain. See, e.g., Berry v. Sugar\nNotch Borough, 191 Pa. 345, 43 A. 240 (1899). The risk from\nwhich Riccardo sought protection was not realized; for all\nthis record shows, the (objectively evaluated) risk to\nRiccardo of sharing a cell with Garcia was no greater than\nthe risk of sharing a cell with any other prisoner.\n\f8                                               No. 02-1961\n\n  As for Rausch’s subjective assessment: though Riccardo\ninitially asserted mortal fear, when later asked whether\nhe “had a problem” with Garcia he shook his head to\ngive a negative answer. Rausch then had to decide which\nstatement to believe. Riccardo argues, and the jury evi-\ndently concluded, that Rausch should have believed the first\nstatement, communicated in private, rather than the\nsecond, communicated in Garcia’s presence. A rational\njury could have thought that guards should give priority\nto statements made in private. (Rausch testified that, if\nRiccardo had claimed to “have a problem” with Garcia, they\nwould have been separated; but Riccardo might have feared\nthe consequences in a later encounter in the prison’s\ngeneral population.) Still, what Rausch should have\nbelieved is not the right question; we need to know what he\ndid believe. No reasonable jury could have found, in light of\nRiccardo’s denial of “a problem” with Garcia and Rausch’s\ndecision to act accordingly, that Rausch subjectively\nappreciated that his action would expose Riccardo to a\nsubstantial risk of serious harm.\n  As we have already explained, prisoners may object to\npotential cellmates in an effort to manipulate assignments,\nor out of ignorance; thus although a protest may demon-\nstrate risk it does not necessarily do so. The Constitution\ndoes not oblige guards to believe whatever inmates say.\nHow does a reasonable guard separate fact from fiction?\nRausch knew when making the assignment at least two\nthings beyond Riccardo’s contradictory assertions. First,\nRausch knew that Garcia was himself in segregation for\nprotection from the Latin Kings (or at least a subset of\nthem). Perhaps Garcia was manipulating the system\nhimself, falsely asserting to fear the Latin Kings so that\nhe could serve as their assassin; but at least at first cut\nGarcia could not be deemed a gang enforcer (and, as we\nlearned ex post, his attack on Riccardo was neither a “hit”\nnor gang related). Second, Rausch knew that Garcia had a\n\fNo. 02-1961                                                 9\n\nclean record in prison. He had not been disciplined for acts\nof violence (let alone for sexual assault). That makes it\nreasonable for Rausch to have deemed Riccardo’s initial\nprotestation unjustified. It is not as if Rausch housed\nRiccardo with a known sexual predator.\n  Riccardo might have responded to these facts by show-\ning that there is a strong correlation between prisoners’\nprofessions of fear and actual violence. How many murders\n(or homosexual assaults) occur in Centralia (or the Illinois\nprison system) per hundred inmate-years of custody? How\nmany violent events were preceded by requests for protec-\ntion? How many requests for protection were dishonored,\nyet nothing untoward happened? Data along these lines\nwould have enabled a jury (and the court) to evaluate actual\nrisks. If violence is common at Centralia, and inmates have\ngood track records in identifying potential aggressors, then\nguards who do not have their heads in the sand must\nactually (that is, subjectively) understand the risk an\ninmate faces when a protest is disregarded. But if violence\nis rare, or if there is poor correlation between inmates’\nalarums and subsequent violence, then Riccardo’s initial\nprotest would not have provided Rausch with actual\nknowledge of an impending assault. The record does not\ncontain any evidence along these lines. At oral argument\nRiccardo’s counsel expressed dismay at the idea that\ninmates’ professions of fear should be put to an empirical\ntest. As counsel saw things, prisoners are unerringly ac-\ncurate in appreciating the risks they face and invariably\ntruthful in dealing with the staff. That seems to us unlikely;\nand if it is so it must be proved to be so and was not.\n  Rausch also was entitled to believe that his assignment\nof Garcia and Riccardo to share a cell would last for one\nnight only. During the next day shift the placement office,\narmed with better information, was supposed to make a\nfresh evaluation and, if appropriate, a new assignment.\nApparently that did not happen; the record does not show\n\f10                                               No. 02-1961\n\nwhy. (Maybe it did happen and the staff approved Rausch’s\naction.) If Rausch knew that the staff charged with this re-\nsponsibility routinely failed to carry it out, then he might\nhave been obliged to take additional precautions (such as\nseparate interviews of Garcia and Riccardo to probe these\nissues more deeply) before making an assignment. Rausch\nhimself testified that separate interviews would have been\nbetter practice, but the Constitution does not enforce all\n“better practices”; this is one respect in which the eighth\namendment standard differs from the negligence standard.\nBut Riccardo does not contend, and the record does not\ndemonstrate, that disregard of the classification system\nat Centralia was so common that Rausch was bound to\nknow that his assignment would last indefinitely. Nor was\nRausch bound to foresee that, if Riccardo was in genuine\nfear, he would neglect to complain the next day, when he\nreadily could have done so. (Recall that Riccardo filed\ntwo grievances on May 29 about other subjects.) Riccardo\ntestified that he was too terrified to protest and was put off\nby Rausch’s assertion that prisoners in segregation can’t\nrefuse assignments; yet grievances are confidential (so\nGarcia would not have known), and prisoners often appeal\nover the head of a guard who has told them that something\ncan’t or won’t be done. Riccardo had already objected to, and\nobtained the removal of, at least one cellmate assigned to\nhim in segregation. At all events, the question on the table\nis what Rausch knew (or deliberately avoided learning) on\nMay 28; and there is no evidence that Rausch subjectively\nbelieved that Riccardo would fail to use his opportunity to\nseek further review the next day.\n  Illinois is free, if it wishes, to give prisoners veto power\nover the identity of their cellmates. But the eighth amend-\nment does not do so of its own force, and prisoners cannot\nuse the Constitution to achieve this control indirectly by\nmaking unsubstantiated assertions. The constitutional\nquestion is not what Riccardo (initially) said, but what\n\fNo. 02-1961                                               11\n\nRausch actually believed. This record does not permit a\nreasonable jury to find that Rausch knew or deliberately\ndisregarded the fact that his actions subjected Riccardo to\na substantial risk of serious harm, so the judgment is\n                                                 REVERSED.\n\n\n\n\n  WILLIAMS, Circuit Judge, dissenting. While I agree that\nAnthony Riccardo did in fact exhaust his administrative\nremedies, I disagree with the majority’s decision to overturn\nthe judgment in this action as a reasonable jury had ample\nevidence to find that Lieutenant Larry Rausch was deliber-\nately indifferent to the substantial risk of harm Riccardo\nfaced by being celled with Juan Garcia. Therefore, I respect-\nfully dissent.\n  On May 30, 1997, while celled with Juan Garcia, a known\nmember of the Latin Kings, Riccardo’s head was forcibly\nshaven by Garcia such that Riccardo was “bleeding pretty\nbad.” Tr. I at 81-82. Garcia then attempted to sodomize\nRiccardo; however, he was able to resist. Tr. II at 50. After\nRiccardo resisted, Garcia ejaculated on Riccardo’s feet. Tr.\nI at 83-84. Riccardo was then forced to perform oral sex on\nGarcia for 15 to 20 minutes. Id. The assault ended when an\nofficer walked by the cell. As the majority notes, the events\nwhich give rise to Lt. Rausch’s liability are limited to the\nhappenings on the evening of May 28, 1997, when Lt.\n\f12                                                  No. 02-1961\n\nRausch replaced Lt. Alemond1 as the lieutenant in charge\nof the segregation and receiving units at Centralia prison.2\n  On appeal, Lt. Rausch contends, and the majority agrees,\nthat the evidence introduced at trial was legally insufficient\nto support a finding of liability under the Eighth Amend-\nment. To sustain overturning a jury verdict, the record\nmust demonstrate no “legally sufficient evidentiary basis\nfor a reasonable jury to find for the non-moving party.”\nPayne v. Milwaukee County, 146 F.3d 430, 432 (7th Cir.\n1998). While undertaking this assessment, we analyze the\n“the totality of the evidence,” Sheenan v. Donlen Corp., 173\nF.3d 1039, 1043 (7th Cir. 1999), and are obliged to leave the\njudgment undisturbed unless the moving party can show\nthat “no rational jury could have brought in a verdict\nagainst him.” EEOC v. G-K-G, Inc., 39 F.3d 740, 745 (7th\nCir. 1994). It is not within the province of the appellate\ncourts to “reweigh the evidence.” Knox v. State of Indiana,\n93 F.3d 1327, 1332 (7th Cir. 1996). Lastly, and most\nimportantly, all reasonable inferences must be analyzed in\nthe light most favorable to Riccardo as the non-moving\nparty. Sheenan, 173 F.3d at 1044.\n  In Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 834 (1994) the Court\nbifurcated the standard for Eighth Amendment liability\ninto an objective element and a subjective element. First,\nthe potential harm to the inmate must be objectively\nserious. Id. (citing Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. 294, 298\n\n\n1\n  Riccardo previously complained to Lt. Alemond that he feared\nbeing celled with Garcia because he was a Latin King, however,\nthe record reveals that this previous complaint was not voiced to\nLt. Rausch and therefore may not support a finding of liability\nagainst him.\n2\n  Lt. Rausch testified that he had no recollection of the events\nwhich transpired on May 28. Tr. III at 68. Thus, the jury was left\nwith Riccardo’s testimony concerning the events of that evening.\n\fNo. 02-1961                                                 13\n\n(1991)). Second, under the subjective prong, the prison\nofficial must “deliberately disregard” this potential harm by\nbeing “aware of facts from which the inference could be\ndrawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and\n[also] draw[ing] the inference.” Id. at 838.\n   The second inquiry is a question of fact, sustainable\nthrough circumstantial evidence, id. at 842, mandating\nan “inquiry into a prison official’s state of mind.” Id. at 837\n(quoting Wilson, 501 U.S. at 299). “A prisoner normally\nproves actual knowledge of impending harm by showing\nthat he complained to prison officials about a specific threat\nto his safety.” McGill v. Duckworth, 944 F.2d 344, 349 (7th\nCir. 1991) (reasoning that the scienter requirement is\nsatisfied when a prison guard, “[s]uspect[s] something is\ntrue but shut[s] [his] eyes for fear of what [he] will learn” or\n“[goes] out of [his] way to avoid acquiring unwelcomed\nknowledge”).\n  The Supreme Court also cautioned that an “Eighth\nAmendment claimant need not show that a prison official\nacted or failed to act believing that harm actually would\nbefall an inmate; it is enough that the official acted or failed\nto act despite his knowledge of a substantial risk of serious\nharm.” Farmer, 511 U.S. at 842. Likewise, a claimant need\nnot prove that a prison official was aware of the specific\ntype of harm which befell the prisoner, only that the prison\nofficial was aware that a substantial risk of some type of\ndanger existed. See Haley v. Gross, 86 F.3d 630, 643 n.33\n(7th Cir. 1996) (applying Farmer, 511 U.S. at 843) (uphold-\ning jury verdict for $1.65 million based on a finding that\nprison guards were deliberately indifferent by failing to\nrespond to a prisoner’s repeated request to be removed from\ncell when his cellmate set fire to cell causing the cellmate’s\ndeath and plaintiff’s severe burns). Thus, it was Riccardo’s\nburden to show that Lt. Rausch actually knew that there\nwas a substantial risk that Garcia would harm Riccardo. Id.\nHowever, Lt. Rausch would be shielded from liability if no\n\f14                                               No. 02-1961\n\nobjectively serious risk existed, he was unaware of the\nimpending risk, McGill, 944 F.2d at 349, or he took reason-\nable steps to abate it, whether successful or not, Farmer,\n511 U.S. at 844.\n  Admittedly, there is evidence in the record to support a\nfinding that Garcia did not objectively pose a substantial\nthreat to Riccardo—namely, the fact that Garcia was also\nplaced in segregation for “enemy protection,” allegedly from\nthe Latin Kings, and that Garcia had no history of sexual\nassault. However, that is not the standard by which this\ncase should be reviewed. The standard is whether there\nexists a legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable\njury to find in favor of Riccardo. Payne, 146 F.3d at 432.\n  A jury could have reasonably believed that Lt. Rausch\nwas deliberately indifferent to the substantial risk of harm\nto Riccardo. It is undisputed that Garcia was a member of\nthe Latin Kings. In their first interaction, Riccardo pri-\nvately pulled Lt. Rausch aside and expressed his fear of\nbeing celled with Garcia. Thus, Riccardo has presented\nsufficient evidence to support the finding that Lt. Rausch\nwas made aware of the potential harm. See McGill, 944\nF.2d at 349. The jury could have further found that Lt.\nRausch’s decision to question Riccardo in front of Garcia\nwas not a reasonable way to abate the potential danger\nto Riccardo. Moreover, Lt. Rausch admitted that “[i]f\n[Riccardo] would have told me he feared for his life, if he\nrefused housing or thought there was a threat to his safe-\nty[,] he would not have been placed—they would not have\nbeen placed together.” Tr. III at 73. Thus, a jury could have\ndetermined that Lt. Rausch’s admission, coupled with his\nprior statements to Riccardo on May 28 that Riccardo could\nnot turn down a housing assignment in segregation, and\nthat Riccardo could not be moved to another cell due to a\nlack of space, amounted to Lt. Rausch “deliberately”\n\fNo. 02-1961                                                    15\n\navoiding learning that Riccardo was in danger.3 Such an\nanalysis avoids the use of ex post occurrences, such as the\nfact that Garcia did in fact assault Riccardo, to sustain a\nfinding of deliberate indifference. Moreover, the fact that\nLt. Rausch is able to point to evidence in the record to sup-\nport his position does not mandate reversal of the jury’s\nverdict. Our sole duty as an appellate court is to analyze\nwhether the record supports the jury’s determination. It is\nnot our function to reweigh the evidence. Knox, 93 F.3d at\n1332.\n  I am further troubled by the majority’s reliance on\nRiccardo’s second statement to Lt. Rausch (made in front of\nGarcia) to sustain overturning the jury’s verdict. As it\nstands, the deliberate indifference inquiry is an inherently\nfactual determination, Farmer, 511 U.S. at 842, which re-\nquires an “inquiry into a prison official’s state of mind,” id.\nat 837.4 Thus, whether this second statement is used to\n\n\n\n3\n  Significantly, Riccardo was actually housed in the receiving unit\nas opposed to the segregation unit during the assault. The jury\nheard testimony that the receiving unit is only used to house\ninmates when the segregation unit is full. Tr. I at 24. Thus, Lt.\nRausch’s statement to Riccardo that there was no place else to\nhouse him carried even greater weight. The jury also heard tes-\ntimony that it would have required more work for Lt. Rausch to\nmove Riccardo from a cell in receiving to a cell in segregation due\nto the time of the alleged refusal and the occupancy of receiving\nand segregation, Tr. III at 75-77, further supporting Riccardo’s\nbelief that any additional complaints about his cell assignment\nwould have been futile. Finally, the jury was told a prisoner may\nbe moved from one cell to another at any time. Tr. I at 25. There-\nfore, the jury had ample evidence to support its finding that Lt.\nRausch’s actions rose to the level of deliberate indifference.\n4\n  The Supreme Court’s discussion only further highlights the\npropriety of allowing a jury to make this determination:\n                                                   (continued...)\n\f16                                                      No. 02-1961\n\nsupport the assertion that there was no “objective” risk to\nRiccardo or that Lt. Rausch was stripped of his “subjective”\nknowledge of the harm, it is clear that Lt. Rausch’s credibil-\nity and sincerity are integral components to the usefulness\nof this interaction. In essence, the majority accepts Lt.\nRausch’s assertion that his second discussion with Riccardo\nin front of Garcia was a sincere investigation of the poten-\ntial risk to Riccardo. However, the jury found otherwise.\nFurther, when asked to review the defendant’s Rule 50\nmotion, the district court aptly stated:\n      [T]here is ample evidence from which to conclude\n      that Rausch’s attempt to ascertain the seriousness\n      of the threat was mere pretense, and that because\n      he did not want to go to the extra effort to find\n      different accommodations for Garcia, he recklessly\n      disregarded what he knew to be a dangerous sit-\n      uation. That decision to essentially disregard the\n      threat is where liability lies. A jury could have\n      reasonably inferred that Rausch crossed the line\n      from gross negligence to deliberate indifference\n\n\n\n4\n    (...continued)\n       When instructing juries in deliberate indifference cases\n       with such issues of proof, courts should be careful to\n       ensure that the requirement of subjective culpability is\n       not lost. It is not enough to merely find that a reasonable\n       person would have known, or that the defendant should\n       have known, and juries should be instructed accordingly.\nId. at n.8; accord Lewis v. Richards, 107 F.3d 549, 556 (7th Cir.\n1997) (Flaum, C.J., concurring) (“In view of the Supreme Court,\nthe safeguard against jurors whose outrage at prison violence\nmight lead them to sanction officials in the absence of an Eighth\nAmendment violation is not a relaxed summary judgment stand-\nard, but jury instructions that properly convey the applicable law.\nLower federal courts, in my view, should exhibit a similar faith in\nthe willingness of juries to follow the law.”).\n\fNo. 02-1961                                                    17\n\n    based on the ludicrousness of ‘asking’ each inmate\n    if he had a problem with the other. Credibility had\n    to have been the key to the jury’s analysis, thus the\n    Court cannot interject its own credibility determi-\n    nations; and if it could, having observed both par-\n    ties’ testimony, it may well have reached the same\n    conclusion as the jury. [. . .]\n    [A] prison official will only be freed from liability if\n    he responded reasonably to the risk. As mentioned\n    above, Rausch’s method of questioning could be\n    perceived as deliberately forcing plaintiff to make a\n    Hobson’s choice.\nRiccardo v. Rausch, No. 99-CV-372-CJP, at 15 (S.D. Ill.\nMar. 7, 2002) (order denying F.R.C.P. Rule 50(b) motion)\n(citations omitted) (emphasis in original). By taking Lt.\nRausch at his word, the majority’s decision has the effect of\nimmunizing prison officials from liability based on po-\ntentially unreasonable or contrived actions, and sanctions\nLt. Rausch’s admittedly unreasonable behavior.\n  In an attempt to break the causal link between Lt.\nRausch’s actions and the harm to Riccardo, the majority\nasserts that “the risk that Riccardo professed to fear (a ‘hit’)\ndid not come to pass.” Majority opinion at 7. The inquiry,\nhowever, is not whether “a hit” was actually put out on\nRiccardo as that would constitute the sort of impermissible\nex post determination eschewed by the majority. Rather, the\nfocus is solely on whether Lt. Rausch was made aware that\na substantial risk of some type of danger existed prior to the\nactual event. See Haley, 86 F.3d at 643 n.33. Under the\nmajority’s analysis are we to presume that Riccardo’s pleas\nfor protection would only guard against murder or physical\nbeating? For the purposes of an Eighth Amendment\ninquiry, in the prison context, I find no real distinction\nbetween “a hit” and a sexual assault.\n  The majority also frees Lt. Rausch of liability based on\nthe assertion that Lt. Rausch was under no duty to foresee\n\f18                                                  No. 02-1961\n\nthat Riccardo would not complain to other prison officials\nbetween May 28, the date of Lt. Rausch and Riccardo’s\ninteraction, and May 30, when the assault actually took\nplace. The record reveals, however, that Garcia closely\nwatched Riccardo’s actions impeding Riccardo’s ability to\nhave a private conversation with prison guards outside of\nGarcia’s presence. Tr. I at 76-82; Tr. II at 42-43. Further,\nwhen Riccardo attempted to alert prison officials, Garcia\nresponded with escalating violence. Tr. II at 46-47. In light\nof Riccardo’s reasonable belief that he could not refuse his\nhousing assignment and that there was no other available\ncell, see note 3, supra, Riccardo did not realistically have\nthe ability to complain to other guards without alerting\nGarcia and incurring his wrath.\n  The majority’s decision to question the adequacy of\nRiccardo’s pleas for protection by requiring evidence con-\ncerning the overall number of sexual assaults at Centralia\nprison is also curious. See Lewis, 107 F.3d at 556 (Flaum,\nC.J., concurring) (“[T]he majority’s emphasis upon the ade-\nquacy of Lewis’s pleas for protection strikes me as in-\nappropriate.”). The prison recognizes that “some prisoners\nare manipulative and cry ‘wolf’,” majority opinion at 5,\nand has created a procedure to deal with this recurring pos-\nsibility. A prisoner’s request for a cell transfer is always\nhonored if the prisoner alleges a fear for his personal safety,\nTr. I at 44, but the prison deals with potential frivolity by\ntreating every request as a potential disciplinary violation.\nId.5 Thus, the prison has created a procedure whereby a\nprisoner is moved first, and questions concerning the sin-\ncerity of the request are asked later. In addition, the\ninquiry under the Eighth Amendment is an individualized\none, i.e., Riccardo was required to prove, based on the\n\n\n5\n  Major Lawrence Jefferson was clear that “if [a prisoner is] just\nrefusing housing just to refuse housing with no reason, then we'll\nmove him for that, but he’ll get a ticket for that.” Id.\n\fNo. 02-1961                                               19\n\nindividual facts of his case, that he was subjected to an\nobjectively serious harm and that Lt. Rausch was “aware of\nfacts from which the inference could be drawn that a\nsubstantial risk of serious harm exist[ed].” Farmer, 511\nU.S. at 838.\n  Finally, though unpursued by the majority, defendant\nargues that should a constitutional violation be found, he is\nnevertheless entitled to qualified immunity. According to\nLt. Rausch, previous case law must show that “no rea-\nsonable prison official would have believed it was constitu-\ntional either to cell an inmate with someone who gave\nconflicting answers when asked (in the other inmate’s\npresence) if he had a problem with that inmate, or to rely\non a policy requiring review of all placement decisions for\nsuitability within hours.” Appellant’s Brief at 33. However,\nthe Supreme Court in Hope v. Pelzer, expressly rejected the\nnotion that in order for a right to be “clearly established”\nprevious case law must contain facts which are “materially\nsimilar” to the facts contained in the underlying action. 536\nU.S. 730, 739 (2002); see also Burgess v. Lowery, 201 F.3d\n942, 944-45 (7th Cir. 2000). Rather, the Court focused on\nwhether the prior case law would place officers on notice\nthat their conduct is unlawful. Id. It is clear that Farmer\nput prison guards on notice that they have a duty, under\nthe Eighth Amendment, to protect inmates from being\ngratuitously beaten or raped by other inmates. See id. at\n833; see also Haley, 86 F.3d at 646 (rejecting qualified\nimmunity defense in light of Farmer decision which further\nelucidated “deliberate indifference” standard).\n  In light of the aforementioned, I must agree with the trial\ncourt that a reasonable jury had ample evidence to sustain\nthis verdict and thus I respectfully dissent.\n\f20                                        No. 02-1961\n\nA true Copy:\n      Teste:\n\n                    ________________________________\n                    Clerk of the United States Court of\n                      Appeals for the Seventh Circuit\n\n\n\n\n               USCA-02-C-0072—2-27-04\n\f",

Anthony Riccardo, an\ninmate of the Centralia Correctional Center in Illinois,\nneeded a new cellmate after his former cellmate complained\nabout being housed with him. Normally that pairing would\nhave been made by Centralia’s placement office, but when\nthe evening of May 28, 1997, arrived and some inmates\nremained unassigned after the regular placement officers\nhad left, the task fell to Lt. Larry Rausch, who was serving\nthe second shift. Rausch matched Riccardo with Juan\nGarcia, a pairing that should have lasted only until the\nplacement officers on the day shift could review matters.\n\f2                                                No. 02-1961\n\nTwo days later Garcia sexually assaulted Riccardo, who\nsued Rausch under 42 U.S.C. §1983. A jury concluded that\nRausch had subjected Riccardo to cruel and unusual\npunishment and awarded $1.5 million in compensatory\ndamages. The district court entered judgment on this ver-\ndict, and Rausch appeals.\n  His lead-off argument is that Riccardo failed to use his\nadministrative remedies. If so, then 42 U.S.C. §1997e(a),\npart of the Prison Litigation Reform Act, forecloses this suit\neven though Riccardo challenges a discrete incident and\nwants a form of relief—money damages—that the ad-\nministrative process in Illinois does not provide.

Riccardo did file an administrative grievance,\nbut Rausch contends it was too late (in February 1998,\nwhile Illinois sets a limit of six months) and asked the state\nto prosecute Garcia rather than do anything about Rausch\nand the classification system.\n   Prisoners must follow state rules about the time and\ncontent of grievances. See Pozo v. McCaughtry, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"777277\"><a href=\"/opinion/777277/rodosvaldo-pozo-v-gary-mccaughtry-randall-gerritson-and-david-hautamaki/\"><span class=\"volume\">286</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1022</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th Cir. 2002); Strong v.

Failure to do this means failure to use (and thus to\nexhaust) available remedies. Yet the state’s administrative\napparatus did not reject Riccardo’s grievance as untimely;\nit accepted and denied the grievance on the merits. At the\ntime of these events, Illinois permitted a filing after six\nmonths when the prisoner had good cause, see 20 Ill.\nAdmin. Code §504.810 (1997). The official handling the\ngrievance must have found good cause; anyway, we held in\nPozo that, when a state treats a filing as timely and\nresolves it on the merits, the federal judiciary will not\nsecond-guess that action, for the grievance has served its\nfunction of alerting the state and inviting corrective action.\n286 F.3d at 1025.\n  As for the content of this grievance: true enough, its main\nobjective was to have Garcia prosecuted. (Riccardo deemed\n\fNo. 02-1961                                                 3\n\ninadequate Garcia’s punishment within the prison system.)\nBut it also at least hinted at problems in prison administra-\ntion. Riccardo wrote: “[T]he administration don’t [sic] do\nthere [sic] job. [A sexual assault] should’ve never [sic]\nhappen again.” This language is ambiguous. There are two\nprincipal ways to reduce the number of sexual assaults in\nprison: better steps ex ante to separate potential aggressors\nfrom potential victims; and harsher penalties ex post in\norder to deter future assaults. Riccardo did not distinguish\nbetween the two, and a prison administration receiving\nsuch a grievance should have considered both. Illinois has\nnot adopted any rule governing the level of detail required\nof prisoners’ grievances. “When the administrative rulebook\nis silent, a grievance suffices if it alerts the prison to the\nnature of the wrong for which redress is sought. As in a\nnotice-pleading system, the grievant need not lay out the\nfacts, articulate legal theories, or demand particular relief.\nAll the grievance need do is object intelligibly to some\nasserted shortcoming.” Strong, 297 F.3d at 650. The\ndocument that Riccardo filed is at the border of intelligibil-\nity; it is hard to imagine much less that a prisoner could do\nand still alert the prison; yet this grievance did complain\nthat Garcia had committed a rape and that “the administra-\ntion don’t do there job.” A generous construction of this\ngrievance would have induced the prison to consider the\npossibility that the guards could have prevented this\nassault. So we conclude that Riccardo exhausted the\nadministrative process. If Illinois wants grievances to be\nmore detailed, it must adopt appropriate regulations and\ninform prisoners what is required of them. Riccardo is\nentitled to a decision on the merits of his constitutional\nclaim.\n  Because Riccardo prevailed at trial, we recap the facts\nin the light most favorable to his position. Riccardo was\nanally raped by his cellmate at Cook County Jail, shortly\nafter his conviction for aggravated assault. When he arrived\n\f4                                                No. 02-1961\n\nat Centralia Correctional Center in November 1996, he told\nthe prison psychologist that he did not feel safe. After a\nstint in segregation for violating prison rules, Riccardo\ndeclined to return to the general population. He told guards\nthat a cellmate in the segregation unit had stolen some of\nhis property and objected to spending another day with that\ncellmate. He believed that the responsible inmate belonged\nto the Latin Kings gang and that the Latin Kings may have\nbeen preparing to kill him—though he did not say why he\nbelieved this. But Centralia allows inmates to veto housing\nwith persons they declare to be enemies, so the prison found\nRiccardo a new cellmate. When, after a few days, that\ncellmate objected to spending more time with Riccardo,\nanother pairing was required. (The segregation unit was too\ncrowded to permit Riccardo a cell of his own.)\n  During the afternoon of May 28, Garcia had offered\nto help Riccardo retrieve his stolen property. Riccardo took\nthis as an ill omen rather than as a genuine offer of assist-\nance and told Lt. Alemond that he feared for his life if celled\nwith Garcia. Although Alemond said that he would “take\ncare of it,” he did nothing—he did not either find a cellmate\nfor Riccardo or alert Lt. Rausch, Alemond’s replacement on\nthe next shift. About 9:30 that evening, Rausch brought\nGarcia to Riccardo’s cell and told him that Garcia was his\nnew cellmate. Before the cells were locked for the night,\nRiccardo sought out Rausch in private and told him that he\nbelieved that the Latin Kings had a “hit” out on him, and\nthat he feared for his life if celled with Garcia. Rausch\nreplied that there was no place else to put Garcia (or\nRiccardo) that evening, and that he could not refuse\nhousing while in segregation. Rausch then brought Riccardo\nand Garcia back together and asked each, in turn, if he had\na problem with the other. Riccardo shook his head in the\nnegative. Rausch took that as agreement to the assignment.\nThat was Riccardo’s last contact with Rausch. As we have\nmentioned, nothing untoward happened that evening or the\n\fNo. 02-1961                                               5\n\nnext, but during the evening of May 30 Garcia compelled\nRiccardo to perform oral sex. The record does not suggest\nthat this assault had any connection to the Latin Kings.\nDuring the time between assignment and assault, Riccardo\ndid not ask for a different cellmate (though he did file two\ngrievances on May 29 about other matters). Circumstances\nbrought out at trial suggest that other guards should have\nrecognized on May 30 that problems had developed between\nRiccardo and Garcia; their failure to intervene may be\nculpable but cannot be attributed to Rausch, whose liability\ndepends exclusively on his actions the evening of May 28.\n  Rausch did not assault Riccardo and is not vicariously\nliable for Garcia’s crime. Like other guards, however,\nRausch was required to refrain from placing Riccardo in\nharm’s way gratuitously. The qualification “gratuitously” is\nimportant, because prisons are dangerous places. Inmates\nget there by violent acts, and many prisoners have a\npropensity to commit more. Guards cannot turn away\npersons committed by the courts; nor do individual guards\nhave any control over crowding and other systemic cir-\ncumstances. All that can be expected is that guards act\nresponsibly under the circumstances that confront them.\nSee McGill v. Duckworth, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"567976\"><a href=\"/opinion/567976/herbert-f-mcgill-plaintiff-appelleecross-appellant-v-jack-r-duckworth/\"><span class=\"volume\">944</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">344</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th Cir. 1991). A\nguard may be responsible without being credulous. Some\nprisoners are manipulative and cry “wolf” in an effort to\nhave a cell to themselves or choose a favored cellmate.\nOther prisoners perceive specters in every shadow, even\nthough their fears are unsupported. (There is, for example,\nno reason to think that the Latin Kings ever had it in for\nRiccardo. He did not belong to a rival gang, and there is no\nhistory of violent or overtly hostile encounters between\nRiccardo and any gang member.) Guards therefore must\ndiscriminate between serious risks of harm and feigned or\nimagined ones, which is not an easy task given the brief\ntime and scant information available to make each of the\nmany decisions that fill every day’s work.\n\f6                                                No. 02-1961\n\n  The eighth amendment does not demand that guards\nperform this task flawlessly. It does not even hold them to\nthe negligence standard. Liability is possible, instead, only\nwhen a guard is deliberately indifferent to a substantial\nrisk of serious harm. See Helling v.

It is not enough, the Court held in\nFarmer, that the guard ought to have recognized the risk.\nInstead, “the official must both be aware of facts from which\nthe inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of\nserious harm exists, and he must also draw the inference.”\nId. at 837.\n  Rausch contends that Riccardo did not face a “substantial\nrisk of serious harm” from Garcia on the evening of May 28,\n1997; that, if such a risk was present, Rausch did not\nappreciate its existence; and that at all events he is entitled\nto qualified immunity because reasonable officers would not\nnecessarily have understood that the law clearly required\nRiccardo and Garcia to be in separate cells. The first two\nmatters (the objective and subjective components of the\neighth amendment) are for the jury in the first instance,\nwith appellate review limited to the question whether any\nreasonable juror could have found that the requisite level of\nrisk existed, and that Rausch knew it. Immunity, however,\nis a matter of law for the court, to be decided without\ndeference to the jury’s resolution—and preferably before the\ncase goes to the jury. See Saucier v.

The\ndistrict court brushed aside Rausch’s invocation of immu-\nnity, writing that a guard cannot benefit from immunity if\nthe action taken was not a reasonable response to a risk\nactually foreseen. That approach, which merges immunity\nand the merits, is incompatible with Saucier and its\npredecessors. See 533 U.S. at 203-06. Immunity protects\n\fNo. 02-1961                                                  7\n\nofficials who act at the “hazy border” (id. at 206) between\nthe lawful and the forbidden. That Rausch may have\noverstepped the line does not mean that every reasonable\nofficer would have been bound to know that Rausch acted\nimproperly. We need not pursue the immunity defense,\nhowever, because Saucier calls on appellate courts to\naddress the merits first, see id. at 201, and Rausch is\nentitled to prevail outright: no reasonable juror could have\nconcluded, on this record, that Rausch actually recognized\nthat placing Garcia and Riccardo together exposed Riccardo\nto substantial risk.\n   Now it might seem that Rausch had to appreciate\nthe risk, because (a) Riccardo claimed to fear for his life\nif celled with any member of the Latin Kings, and (b) Garcia\nin fact harmed Riccardo. One problem with relying on how\nthings turned out to show knowledge of risk beforehand\nis that Garcia did not act for the Latin Kings; he told\nRiccardo that he was fulfilling a personal fantasy,\nand Riccardo believed this explanation. Thus the risk\nthat Riccardo professed to fear (a “hit”) did not come to\npass. Even under the law of negligence, this is an important\ndistinction. If a school district entrusts a bus to a driver\nwith a bad drinking record, and the tipsy driver runs the\nbus off the road while speeding, the school district is liable;\nbut if instead there is an accident for which the driver is not\nat fault (a tree falls on bus), or the driver collapses of a\nheart attack while on the road, the district is not liable,\nbecause that was not the type of risk created or increased\nby the negligent conduct even though hiring this particular\ndriver was in the causal chain. See, e.g., Berry v. Sugar\nNotch Borough, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">191</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Pa.</span> <span class=\"page\">345</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span> <span class=\"page\">240</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1899). The risk from\nwhich Riccardo sought protection was not realized; for all\nthis record shows, the (objectively evaluated) risk to\nRiccardo of sharing a cell with Garcia was no greater than\nthe risk of sharing a cell with any other prisoner.\n\f8                                               No. 02-1961\n\n  As for Rausch’s subjective assessment: though Riccardo\ninitially asserted mortal fear, when later asked whether\nhe “had a problem” with Garcia he shook his head to\ngive a negative answer. Rausch then had to decide which\nstatement to believe. Riccardo argues, and the jury evi-\ndently concluded, that Rausch should have believed the first\nstatement, communicated in private, rather than the\nsecond, communicated in Garcia’s presence. A rational\njury could have thought that guards should give priority\nto statements made in private. (Rausch testified that, if\nRiccardo had claimed to “have a problem” with Garcia, they\nwould have been separated; but Riccardo might have feared\nthe consequences in a later encounter in the prison’s\ngeneral population.) Still, what Rausch should have\nbelieved is not the right question; we need to know what he\ndid believe. No reasonable jury could have found, in light of\nRiccardo’s denial of “a problem” with Garcia and Rausch’s\ndecision to act accordingly, that Rausch subjectively\nappreciated that his action would expose Riccardo to a\nsubstantial risk of serious harm.\n  As we have already explained, prisoners may object to\npotential cellmates in an effort to manipulate assignments,\nor out of ignorance; thus although a protest may demon-\nstrate risk it does not necessarily do so. The Constitution\ndoes not oblige guards to believe whatever inmates say.\nHow does a reasonable guard separate fact from fiction?\nRausch knew when making the assignment at least two\nthings beyond Riccardo’s contradictory assertions. First,\nRausch knew that Garcia was himself in segregation for\nprotection from the Latin Kings (or at least a subset of\nthem). Perhaps Garcia was manipulating the system\nhimself, falsely asserting to fear the Latin Kings so that\nhe could serve as their assassin; but at least at first cut\nGarcia could not be deemed a gang enforcer (and, as we\nlearned ex post, his attack on Riccardo was neither a “hit”\nnor gang related). Second, Rausch knew that Garcia had a\n\fNo. 02-1961                                                 9\n\nclean record in prison. He had not been disciplined for acts\nof violence (let alone for sexual assault). That makes it\nreasonable for Rausch to have deemed Riccardo’s initial\nprotestation unjustified. It is not as if Rausch housed\nRiccardo with a known sexual predator.\n  Riccardo might have responded to these facts by show-\ning that there is a strong correlation between prisoners’\nprofessions of fear and actual violence. How many murders\n(or homosexual assaults) occur in Centralia (or the Illinois\nprison system) per hundred inmate-years of custody? How\nmany violent events were preceded by requests for protec-\ntion? How many requests for protection were dishonored,\nyet nothing untoward happened? Data along these lines\nwould have enabled a jury (and the court) to evaluate actual\nrisks. If violence is common at Centralia, and inmates have\ngood track records in identifying potential aggressors, then\nguards who do not have their heads in the sand must\nactually (that is, subjectively) understand the risk an\ninmate faces when a protest is disregarded. But if violence\nis rare, or if there is poor correlation between inmates’\nalarums and subsequent violence, then Riccardo’s initial\nprotest would not have provided Rausch with actual\nknowledge of an impending assault. The record does not\ncontain any evidence along these lines. At oral argument\nRiccardo’s counsel expressed dismay at the idea that\ninmates’ professions of fear should be put to an empirical\ntest. As counsel saw things, prisoners are unerringly ac-\ncurate in appreciating the risks they face and invariably\ntruthful in dealing with the staff. That seems to us unlikely;\nand if it is so it must be proved to be so and was not.\n  Rausch also was entitled to believe that his assignment\nof Garcia and Riccardo to share a cell would last for one\nnight only. During the next day shift the placement office,\narmed with better information, was supposed to make a\nfresh evaluation and, if appropriate, a new assignment.\nApparently that did not happen; the record does not show\n\f10                                               No. 02-1961\n\nwhy. (Maybe it did happen and the staff approved Rausch’s\naction.) If Rausch knew that the staff charged with this re-\nsponsibility routinely failed to carry it out, then he might\nhave been obliged to take additional precautions (such as\nseparate interviews of Garcia and Riccardo to probe these\nissues more deeply) before making an assignment. Rausch\nhimself testified that separate interviews would have been\nbetter practice, but the Constitution does not enforce all\n“better practices”; this is one respect in which the eighth\namendment standard differs from the negligence standard.\nBut Riccardo does not contend, and the record does not\ndemonstrate, that disregard of the classification system\nat Centralia was so common that Rausch was bound to\nknow that his assignment would last indefinitely. Nor was\nRausch bound to foresee that, if Riccardo was in genuine\nfear, he would neglect to complain the next day, when he\nreadily could have done so. (Recall that Riccardo filed\ntwo grievances on May 29 about other subjects.) Riccardo\ntestified that he was too terrified to protest and was put off\nby Rausch’s assertion that prisoners in segregation can’t\nrefuse assignments; yet grievances are confidential (so\nGarcia would not have known), and prisoners often appeal\nover the head of a guard who has told them that something\ncan’t or won’t be done. Riccardo had already objected to, and\nobtained the removal of, at least one cellmate assigned to\nhim in segregation. At all events, the question on the table\nis what Rausch knew (or deliberately avoided learning) on\nMay 28; and there is no evidence that Rausch subjectively\nbelieved that Riccardo would fail to use his opportunity to\nseek further review the next day.\n  Illinois is free, if it wishes, to give prisoners veto power\nover the identity of their cellmates. But the eighth amend-\nment does not do so of its own force, and prisoners cannot\nuse the Constitution to achieve this control indirectly by\nmaking unsubstantiated assertions. The constitutional\nquestion is not what Riccardo (initially) said, but what\n\fNo. 02-1961                                               11\n\nRausch actually believed. This record does not permit a\nreasonable jury to find that Rausch knew or deliberately\ndisregarded the fact that his actions subjected Riccardo to\na substantial risk of serious harm, so the judgment is\n                                                 REVERSED.\n\n\n\n\n  WILLIAMS, Circuit Judge, dissenting. While I agree that\nAnthony Riccardo did in fact exhaust his administrative\nremedies, I disagree with the majority’s decision to overturn\nthe judgment in this action as a reasonable jury had ample\nevidence to find that Lieutenant Larry Rausch was deliber-\nately indifferent to the substantial risk of harm Riccardo\nfaced by being celled with Juan Garcia. Therefore, I respect-\nfully dissent.\n  On May 30, 1997, while celled with Juan Garcia, a known\nmember of the Latin Kings, Riccardo’s head was forcibly\nshaven by Garcia such that Riccardo was “bleeding pretty\nbad.” Tr. I at 81-82. Garcia then attempted to sodomize\nRiccardo; however, he was able to resist. Tr. II at 50. After\nRiccardo resisted, Garcia ejaculated on Riccardo’s feet. Tr.\nI at 83-84. Riccardo was then forced to perform oral sex on\nGarcia for 15 to 20 minutes. Id. The assault ended when an\nofficer walked by the cell. As the majority notes, the events\nwhich give rise to Lt. Rausch’s liability are limited to the\nhappenings on the evening of May 28, 1997, when Lt.\n\f12                                                  No. 02-1961\n\nRausch replaced Lt. Alemond1 as the lieutenant in charge\nof the segregation and receiving units at Centralia prison.2\n  On appeal, Lt. Rausch contends, and the majority agrees,\nthat the evidence introduced at trial was legally insufficient\nto support a finding of liability under the Eighth Amend-\nment. To sustain overturning a jury verdict, the record\nmust demonstrate no “legally sufficient evidentiary basis\nfor a reasonable jury to find for the non-moving party.”\nPayne v.

Rausch and therefore may not support a finding of liability\nagainst him.\n2\n  Lt. Rausch testified that he had no recollection of the events\nwhich transpired on May 28. Tr. III at 68. Thus, the jury was left\nwith Riccardo’s testimony concerning the events of that evening.\n\fNo. 02-1961                                                 13\n\n(1991)).

Likewise, a claimant need\nnot prove that a prison official was aware of the specific\ntype of harm which befell the prisoner, only that the prison\nofficial was aware that a substantial risk of some type of\ndanger existed. See Haley v.

Thus, it was Riccardo’s\nburden to show that Lt. Rausch actually knew that there\nwas a substantial risk that Garcia would harm Riccardo. Id.\nHowever, Lt. Rausch would be shielded from liability if no\n\f14                                               No. 02-1961\n\nobjectively serious risk existed, he was unaware of the\nimpending risk, McGill, 944 F.2d at 349, or he took reason-\nable steps to abate it, whether successful or not, Farmer,\n511 U.S. at 844.\n  Admittedly, there is evidence in the record to support a\nfinding that Garcia did not objectively pose a substantial\nthreat to Riccardo—namely, the fact that Garcia was also\nplaced in segregation for “enemy protection,” allegedly from\nthe Latin Kings, and that Garcia had no history of sexual\nassault. However, that is not the standard by which this\ncase should be reviewed. The standard is whether there\nexists a legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable\njury to find in favor of Riccardo. Payne, 146 F.3d at 432.\n  A jury could have reasonably believed that Lt. Rausch\nwas deliberately indifferent to the substantial risk of harm\nto Riccardo. It is undisputed that Garcia was a member of\nthe Latin Kings. In their first interaction, Riccardo pri-\nvately pulled Lt. Rausch aside and expressed his fear of\nbeing celled with Garcia. Thus, Riccardo has presented\nsufficient evidence to support the finding that Lt. Rausch\nwas made aware of the potential harm. See McGill, 944\nF.2d at 349. The jury could have further found that Lt.\nRausch’s decision to question Riccardo in front of Garcia\nwas not a reasonable way to abate the potential danger\nto Riccardo. Moreover, Lt. Rausch admitted that “[i]f\n[Riccardo] would have told me he feared for his life, if he\nrefused housing or thought there was a threat to his safe-\nty[,] he would not have been placed—they would not have\nbeen placed together.” Tr. III at 73. Thus, a jury could have\ndetermined that Lt. Rausch’s admission, coupled with his\nprior statements to Riccardo on May 28 that Riccardo could\nnot turn down a housing assignment in segregation, and\nthat Riccardo could not be moved to another cell due to a\nlack of space, amounted to Lt. Rausch “deliberately”\n\fNo. 02-1961                                                    15\n\navoiding learning that Riccardo was in danger.3 Such an\nanalysis avoids the use of ex post occurrences, such as the\nfact that Garcia did in fact assault Riccardo, to sustain a\nfinding of deliberate indifference. Moreover, the fact that\nLt. Rausch is able to point to evidence in the record to sup-\nport his position does not mandate reversal of the jury’s\nverdict. Our sole duty as an appellate court is to analyze\nwhether the record supports the jury’s determination. It is\nnot our function to reweigh the evidence. Knox, 93 F.3d at\n1332.\n  I am further troubled by the majority’s reliance on\nRiccardo’s second statement to Lt. Rausch (made in front of\nGarcia) to sustain overturning the jury’s verdict. As it\nstands, the deliberate indifference inquiry is an inherently\nfactual determination, Farmer, 511 U.S. at 842, which re-\nquires an “inquiry into a prison official’s state of mind,” id.\nat 837.4 Thus, whether this second statement is used to\n\n\n\n3\n  Significantly, Riccardo was actually housed in the receiving unit\nas opposed to the segregation unit during the assault. The jury\nheard testimony that the receiving unit is only used to house\ninmates when the segregation unit is full. Tr. I at 24. Thus, Lt.\nRausch’s statement to Riccardo that there was no place else to\nhouse him carried even greater weight. The jury also heard tes-\ntimony that it would have required more work for Lt. Rausch to\nmove Riccardo from a cell in receiving to a cell in segregation due\nto the time of the alleged refusal and the occupancy of receiving\nand segregation, Tr. III at 75-77, further supporting Riccardo’s\nbelief that any additional complaints about his cell assignment\nwould have been futile. Finally, the jury was told a prisoner may\nbe moved from one cell to another at any time. Tr. I at 25. There-\nfore, the jury had ample evidence to support its finding that Lt.\nRausch’s actions rose to the level of deliberate indifference.\n4\n  The Supreme Court’s discussion only further highlights the\npropriety of allowing a jury to make this determination:\n                                                   (continued...)\n\f16                                                      No. 02-1961\n\nsupport the assertion that there was no “objective” risk to\nRiccardo or that Lt. Rausch was stripped of his “subjective”\nknowledge of the harm, it is clear that Lt. Rausch’s credibil-\nity and sincerity are integral components to the usefulness\nof this interaction. In essence, the majority accepts Lt.\nRausch’s assertion that his second discussion with Riccardo\nin front of Garcia was a sincere investigation of the poten-\ntial risk to Riccardo. However, the jury found otherwise.\nFurther, when asked to review the defendant’s Rule 50\nmotion, the district court aptly stated:\n      [T]here is ample evidence from which to conclude\n      that Rausch’s attempt to ascertain the seriousness\n      of the threat was mere pretense, and that because\n      he did not want to go to the extra effort to find\n      different accommodations for Garcia, he recklessly\n      disregarded what he knew to be a dangerous sit-\n      uation. That decision to essentially disregard the\n      threat is where liability lies.

It is not enough to merely find that a reasonable\n       person would have known, or that the defendant should\n       have known, and juries should be instructed accordingly.\nId. at n.8; accord Lewis v.

Credibility had\n    to have been the key to the jury’s analysis, thus the\n    Court cannot interject its own credibility determi-\n    nations; and if it could, having observed both par-\n    ties’ testimony, it may well have reached the same\n    conclusion as the jury. [. . .]\n    [A] prison official will only be freed from liability if\n    he responded reasonably to the risk. As mentioned\n    above, Rausch’s method of questioning could be\n    perceived as deliberately forcing plaintiff to make a\n    Hobson’s choice.\nRiccardo v. Rausch, No. 99-CV-372-CJP, at 15 (S.D. Ill.\nMar. 7, 2002) (order denying F.R.C.P. Rule 50(b) motion)\n(citations omitted) (emphasis in original). By taking Lt.\nRausch at his word, the majority’s decision has the effect of\nimmunizing prison officials from liability based on po-\ntentially unreasonable or contrived actions, and sanctions\nLt. Rausch’s admittedly unreasonable behavior.\n  In an attempt to break the causal link between Lt.\nRausch’s actions and the harm to Riccardo, the majority\nasserts that “the risk that Riccardo professed to fear (a ‘hit’)\ndid not come to pass.” Majority opinion at 7. The inquiry,\nhowever, is not whether “a hit” was actually put out on\nRiccardo as that would constitute the sort of impermissible\nex post determination eschewed by the majority. Rather, the\nfocus is solely on whether Lt. Rausch was made aware that\na substantial risk of some type of danger existed prior to the\nactual event. See Haley, 86 F.3d at 643 n.33. Under the\nmajority’s analysis are we to presume that Riccardo’s pleas\nfor protection would only guard against murder or physical\nbeating? For the purposes of an Eighth Amendment\ninquiry, in the prison context, I find no real distinction\nbetween “a hit” and a sexual assault.\n  The majority also frees Lt. Rausch of liability based on\nthe assertion that Lt. Rausch was under no duty to foresee\n\f18                                                  No. 02-1961\n\nthat Riccardo would not complain to other prison officials\nbetween May 28, the date of Lt. Rausch and Riccardo’s\ninteraction, and May 30, when the assault actually took\nplace. The record reveals, however, that Garcia closely\nwatched Riccardo’s actions impeding Riccardo’s ability to\nhave a private conversation with prison guards outside of\nGarcia’s presence. Tr. I at 76-82; Tr. II at 42-43. Further,\nwhen Riccardo attempted to alert prison officials, Garcia\nresponded with escalating violence. Tr. II at 46-47. In light\nof Riccardo’s reasonable belief that he could not refuse his\nhousing assignment and that there was no other available\ncell, see note 3, supra, Riccardo did not realistically have\nthe ability to complain to other guards without alerting\nGarcia and incurring his wrath.\n  The majority’s decision to question the adequacy of\nRiccardo’s pleas for protection by requiring evidence con-\ncerning the overall number of sexual assaults at Centralia\nprison is also curious. See Lewis, 107 F.3d at 556 (Flaum,\nC.J., concurring) (“[T]he majority’s emphasis upon the ade-\nquacy of Lewis’s pleas for protection strikes me as in-\nappropriate.”). The prison recognizes that “some prisoners\nare manipulative and cry ‘wolf’,” majority opinion at 5,\nand has created a procedure to deal with this recurring pos-\nsibility. A prisoner’s request for a cell transfer is always\nhonored if the prisoner alleges a fear for his personal safety,\nTr. I at 44, but the prison deals with potential frivolity by\ntreating every request as a potential disciplinary violation.\nId.5 Thus, the prison has created a procedure whereby a\nprisoner is moved first, and questions concerning the sin-\ncerity of the request are asked later. In addition, the\ninquiry under the Eighth Amendment is an individualized\none, i.e., Riccardo was required to prove, based on the\n\n\n5\n  Major Lawrence Jefferson was clear that “if [a prisoner is] just\nrefusing housing just to refuse housing with no reason, then we'll\nmove him for that, but he’ll get a ticket for that.” Id.\n\fNo. 02-1961                                               19\n\nindividual facts of his case, that he was subjected to an\nobjectively serious harm and that Lt. Rausch was “aware of\nfacts from which the inference could be drawn that a\nsubstantial risk of serious harm exist[ed].” Farmer, 511\nU.S. at 838.\n  Finally, though unpursued by the majority, defendant\nargues that should a constitutional violation be found, he is\nnevertheless entitled to qualified immunity. According to\nLt. Rausch, previous case law must show that “no rea-\nsonable prison official would have believed it was constitu-\ntional either to cell an inmate with someone who gave\nconflicting answers when asked (in the other inmate’s\npresence) if he had a problem with that inmate, or to rely\non a policy requiring review of all placement decisions for\nsuitability within hours.” Appellant’s Brief at 33. However,\nthe Supreme Court in Hope v. Pelzer, expressly rejected the\nnotion that in order for a right to be “clearly established”\nprevious case law must contain facts which are “materially\nsimilar” to the facts contained in the underlying action. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121169\"><a href=\"/opinion/121169/hope-v-pelzer/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">730</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 739 (2002); see also Burgess v.

Rather, the Court focused on\nwhether the prior case law would place officers on notice\nthat their conduct is unlawful. Id. It is clear that Farmer\nput prison guards on notice that they have a duty, under\nthe Eighth Amendment, to protect inmates from being\ngratuitously beaten or raped by other inmates. See id. at\n833; see also Haley, 86 F.3d at 646 (rejecting qualified\nimmunity defense in light of Farmer decision which further\nelucidated “deliberate indifference” standard).\n  In light of the aforementioned, I must agree with the trial\ncourt that a reasonable jury had ample evidence to sustain\nthis verdict and thus I respectfully dissent.\n\f20                                        No. 02-1961\n\nA true Copy:\n      Teste:\n\n                    ________________________________\n                    Clerk of the United States Court of\n                      Appeals for the Seventh Circuit\n\n\n\n\n               USCA-02-C-0072—2-27-04\n\f</pre>",
