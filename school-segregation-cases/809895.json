Introduction\n\n      Defendant-Appellee Elizabeth E., at all times relevant to this appeal, was a\n\nstudent in the Jefferson County, Colorado school system with substantial\n\nbehavioral and emotional issues for which she required special education under\n\nthe Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act (“IDEA” or the “Act”), 20\n\nU.S.C. § 1400. In November 2008, Elizabeth’s parents, Roxanne B. and David E.\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\f(“Parents”), enrolled her at Innercept, LLC (“Innercept”), a residential treatment\n\ncenter in Idaho, and sought reimbursement from Plaintiff-Appellant Jefferson\n\nCounty School District R-1 (the “District”). See 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii).\n\nAn Impartial Hearing Officer (IHO) concluded Parents were entitled to\n\nreimbursement for the placement under the Act. That decision was affirmed by a\n\nstate Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), whose decision was, in turn, affirmed by\n\nthe United States District Court for the District of Colorado. The District\n\nappeals, arguing Innercept is not a reimbursable placement under the IDEA and\n\nthat Parents’ conduct precluded reimbursement. Exercising jurisdiction pursuant\n\nto 28 U.S.C. § 1291, this court affirms the judgment of the district court.\n\nII.   Background\n\n      A. Statutory Framework\n\n      The IDEA provides federal funding to states to assist with the education of\n\ndisabled children on the condition that states comply with the Act’s “extensive\n\ngoals and procedures.” Bd. of Educ. v. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176, 179 (1982). 1 One\n\nof the Act’s stated purposes is “to ensure that all children with disabilities have\n\navailable to them a free appropriate public education that emphasizes special\n\neducation and related services designed to meet their unique needs and prepare\n\nthem for further education, employment, and independent living.” 20 U.S.C.\n\n      1\n      The IDEA was originally titled the Education of the Handicapped Act; its\nname was changed in 1990. See Ellenberg v. N.M. Military Inst., 478 F.3d 1262,\n1268 n.1 (10th Cir. 2007).\n\n                                         -3-\n\f§ 1400(d)(1)(A). States that receive federal funding under the IDEA must\n\nprovide all eligible students with a free appropriate public education (“FAPE”).\n\nId. § 1412(a)(1)(A); Sytsema v. Acad. Sch. Dist. No. 20, 538 F.3d 1306, 1312\n\n(10th Cir. 2008). “To provide an eligible student with a FAPE, states must\n\ndevelop an [Individualized Education Plan] for each qualifying student.”\n\nSytsema, 538 F.3d at 1312. An Individualized Education Plan (“IEP”) is a\n\ndetailed written document which describes the student’s educational goals for an\n\nacademic year and establishes a plan to achieve those goals. See id.; 20 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1414(d)(1)(A)(I). The Act sets forth detailed procedures through which an IEP\n\nis to be developed with the participation of the child’s parents, teachers, special\n\neducation teachers, school officials, and other parties with knowledge of the\n\nchild’s special needs. See generally 20 U.S.C. § 1414(d). Further, the Act\n\nrequires states to develop and maintain procedural safeguards to ensure disabled\n\nchildren receive a FAPE. See id. § 1415. Such procedures include an impartial\n\ndue process hearing to address parental complaints over a school district’s actions\n\nwith respect to a child’s IEP. Id. § 1415(f).\n\n      B. Factual Background\n\n      Though the parties disagree on the import of certain facts, their versions of\n\nevents which gave rise to these proceedings are substantially identical and any\n\ndifferences are not material to our analysis. Elizabeth was born in 1991. Parents\n\nbecame her foster parents when she was sixteen months old after she was\n\n                                          -4-\n\fneglected by her birth parents. Parents adopted Elizabeth when she was three-\n\nand-a-half years old. In March 2000, Elizabeth and Parents moved to Colorado\n\nwhere she attended public school and was identified as a student eligible for\n\nspecial education under the IDEA.\n\n      Pursuant to two consecutive mediated settlements between Parents and the\n\nDistrict concerning whether the District was meeting its IDEA obligations,\n\nElizabeth attended ninth and tenth grade at Humanex Academy, a private school\n\nin Colorado which specializes in the education of children with significant\n\nlearning disabilities and emotional and behavioral issues. At Humanex, Elizabeth\n\nwould typically start out well early in the year but struggle academically and\n\nsocially by the end of the year. By the end of the 2007-08 school year, Elizabeth\n\nhad not earned enough credits to advance to the eleventh grade. Parents and the\n\nDistrict began discussions related to Elizabeth’s placement options. On August\n\n11, 2008, Parents and the District entered into a settlement agreement pursuant to\n\nwhich the District would pay tuition at Humanex during the 2008-09 academic\n\nyear. The agreement also called for an IEP team meeting to be convened by\n\nAugust 29, 2008, to arrange for an evaluation of Elizabeth. Meanwhile,\n\nElizabeth’s behavior at home began to deteriorate, and Parents commenced\n\nconsideration of temporary psychiatric hospitalization options for her. Parents\n\nadvised the District they were considering such hospitalization on August 15,\n\n2008. On August 20, 2008, Elizabeth was admitted to the Aspen Institute for\n\n                                         -5-\n\fBehavioral Assessment in Utah; on August 26, Parents notified the District of the\n\nplacement by email.\n\n      On September 24, 2008, the director of Humanex notified Parents that the\n\nDistrict had withdrawn Elizabeth from the school because it was unwilling to\n\nincur the cost of her tuition when she was not in attendance. The District took\n\nthis position notwithstanding an agreement it had with Humanex whereby it\n\nwould be refunded at the end of the semester for any months Elizabeth did not\n\nattend. Parents, through counsel, notified the District they considered the\n\nnonpayment of Elizabeth’s tuition at Humanex a breach of the parties’ settlement\n\nagreement. The District, also through counsel, responded: “[I]t appears that at\n\nthis point, the settlement agreement is moot, as parents have unilaterally placed\n\nElizabeth at the Aspen Center in Utah. As such, Elizabeth is not a District\n\nstudent, and the District has no on-going responsibility to Elizabeth under the\n\nIDEA.”\n\n      In a letter dated November 10, 2008, Parents notified the District they\n\nintended to enroll Elizabeth at Innercept in Idaho in ten business days and that\n\nthey would seek reimbursement for the cost of the placement. See 34 C.F.R.\n\n§ 300.104. On November 20, 2008, the District responded:\n\n      As you are aware, pursuant to a settlement agreement, the District\n      was in the process of evaluating Elizabeth to develop an\n      individualized education program and appropriate placement for\n      Elizabeth when her parents unilaterally placed her in a program in\n      Utah. It now appears that her parents are transferring Elizabeth to a\n\n                                         -6-\n\f      program in Idaho. The School District will not be providing\n      reimbursement to the family, but stands ready, willing, and able to\n      provide Elizabeth with a free appropriate public education if she\n      returns to the School District.\n\nOn December 3, 2008, Elizabeth’s mother stated in an email to the District:\n\n      [We] think that a more productive and cost-efficient way to move\n      forward, rather than drawing lines in the sand, is to start anew and all\n      work together to complete Elizabeth’s IEP. How would you like to\n      proceed with this process? What do you think the next steps should\n      be? Who do you see participating on the IEP team?\n\nThe District responded on December 9, 2008:\n\n      [Because] you unilaterally placed her in Idaho, the District does not\n      presently have an obligation to evaluate, convene IEP team meetings\n      for, or otherwise serve Elizabeth under the IDEA. However . . . the\n      District stands ready, willing, and able to evaluate and provide\n      Elizabeth with a free appropriate public education upon her return to\n      the District.\n\nIn response to another email from Elizabeth’s mother stating Elizabeth “is still\n\nunder contract with Jefferson County for the 2008–09 school year,” the District\n\nreiterated it would re-engage in the effort to provide an IEP for Elizabeth only if\n\nshe returned to Jefferson County.\n\n      Parents requested an administrative due process hearing and reimbursement\n\nfor Elizabeth’s placement at Innercept. See 20 U.S.C. § 1415(f). After\n\nconducting a five-day hearing in August 2009, the IHO issued a decision\n\nconcluding the District failed to make a FAPE available to Elizabeth in a timely\n\nmanner prior to her enrollment at Innercept, that Innercept was a reimbursable\n\nplacement under the IDEA, and Parents were entitled to reimbursement from the\n\n                                         -7-\n\fDistrict for that enrollment. The IHO declined to deny or reduce reimbursement\n\nbased on the District’s allegations that Parents failed to provide sufficient notice\n\nprior to Elizabeth’s placement, failed to make Elizabeth available for an\n\nevaluation, or otherwise acted unreasonably. An ALJ affirmed substantially all of\n\nthe IHO’s conclusions, reversing only the IHO’s award of travel costs to and from\n\nInnercept for family therapy. The District then brought an action in the United\n\nStates District Court for the District of Colorado, seeking review of the ALJ’s\n\ndecision pursuant to 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(3)(A). The district court affirmed the\n\ndecision of the ALJ.\n\n      At no point before the ALJ, district court, or this court has the District\n\nchallenged the IHO’s conclusion it failed to provide a FAPE to Elizabeth.\n\nInstead, the District advances two defenses to reimbursement under the IDEA.\n\nFirst, the District argues Elizabeth’s placement at Innercept is not reimbursable\n\nunder the IDEA because it does not provide her with “special education” and\n\n“related services” as defined in the Act. Second, the District argues\n\nreimbursement should have been reduced or denied pursuant to 20 U.S.C. §\n\n1412(a)(10)(C)(iii).\n\n\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\fIII.   Discussion\n\n       A.    Appropriateness of Innercept Under the IDEA\n\n             1.     Standard of Review\n\n       This court reviews the judgment of the district court de novo, applying the\n\nsame standard as the district court. L.B. ex rel. K.B. v. Nebo Sch. Dist., 379 F.3d\n\n966, 974 (10th Cir. 2004). “Unlike the deferential review typically afforded to\n\nadministrative adjudication of statutory claims, Congress requires district courts\n\nto apply a modified de novo standard when reviewing agency disposition in the\n\nIDEA context.” Garcia v. Bd. of Educ., 520 F.3d 1116, 1125 (10th Cir. 2008).\n\nSpecifically, 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(2)(C) states that a district court adjudicating an\n\nIDEA appeal “shall receive the records of the administrative proceedings . . . hear\n\nadditional evidence at the request of a party; and . . . basing its decision on the\n\npreponderance of the evidence, shall grant such relief as the court determines is\n\nappropriate.” Additionally, “though the statute specifies that review is de novo,\n\nthe Supreme Court has interpreted the requirement that the district court receive\n\nthe administrative record to mean that due weight must be given to the\n\nadministrative proceedings, the fact findings of which are considered prima facie\n\ncorrect.” Garcia, 520 F.3d at 1125 (citation and quotations omitted).\n\n             2.     Residential Placements Under the IDEA\n\n       20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii) provides:\n\n\n\n\n                                          -9-\n\f      If the parents of a child with a disability, who previously received\n      special education and related services under the authority of a public\n      agency, enroll the child in a private elementary school or secondary\n      school without the consent of or referral by the public agency, a\n      court or a hearing officer may require the agency to reimburse the\n      parents for the cost of that enrollment if the court or hearing officer\n      finds that the agency had not made a free appropriate public\n      education available to the child in a timely manner prior to that\n      enrollment.\n\nSee also Sch. Comm. of Town of Burlington v. Dep’t of Educ., 471 U.S. 359, 369\n\n(1985). Parents who make unilateral placements at a private school, however, “do\n\nso at their own financial risk. They are entitled to reimbursement only if a federal\n\ncourt concludes both that the public placement violated IDEA and that the private\n\nschool placement was proper under the Act.” Florence Cnty. Sch. Dist. Four v.\n\nCarter, 510 U.S. 7, 15 (1993) (citation and quotation omitted). Although it did\n\nnot provide a FAPE to Elizabeth, the District contends Parents are still not\n\nentitled to reimbursement because the placement at Innercept was not “proper”\n\nunder the IDEA. More precisely, the District contends the cost of Elizabeth’s\n\nplacement at Innercept is not reimbursable because the services provided do not\n\nconstitute “special education” and “related services” under the Act.\n\n      Courts have taken different approaches in determining whether a private\n\nresidential placement is reimbursable under the IDEA. In Kruelle v. New Castle\n\nCounty School District, 642 F.2d 687, 693–94 (3d Cir. 1981), the Third Circuit\n\nheld that when determining whether a residential placement is reimbursable as\n\nspecial education under the Act the “[a]nalysis must focus . . . on whether\n\n                                        -10-\n\ffull-time placement may be considered necessary for educational purposes, or\n\nwhether the residential placement is a response to medical, social or emotional\n\nproblems that are segregable from the learning process.” Kruelle involved a\n\nclaim for reimbursement by the parents of Paul Kruelle, a child with an I.Q. well\n\nbelow thirty who suffered from severe physical and emotional problems. Id. at\n\n688–89. After concluding the school district’s proffered educational plan did not\n\nprovide a FAPE within the meaning of the Act, the district court ordered the\n\nschool district to provide reimbursement for a full-time residential program. Id.\n\nat 690. Affirming this judgment, the court rejected the argument that the\n\nresidential placement was not reimbursable because it was required for non-\n\neducational reasons, such as medical and domiciliary care, noting “the concept of\n\neducation is necessarily broad with respect to persons such as Paul,” id. at 693,\n\nwho could not walk, dress himself, or eat unaided, id. at 688. The discussion in\n\nKruelle addressed only whether the residential placement at issue provided\n\n“special education,” within the meaning of the Act. Id. at 694 n.23.\n\n      Recently, in Mary T. v. School District of Philadelphia, 575 F.3d 235,\n\n248–49 (3d Cir. 2009), the Third Circuit clarified its holding in Kruelle,\n\nconcluding the parents of a child with severe emotional disabilities were not\n\nentitled to reimbursement for the child’s placement in a long-term psychiatric\n\nresidential treatment center. The treatment center had no educational\n\naccreditation, on-site school, special education teachers, or school affiliation. Id.\n\n                                         -11-\n\fat 239. Citing Kruelle, the Third Circuit noted, “not all services that can be\n\nbroadly construed as educational are cognizable under IDEA . . . because\n\nultimately any life support system or medical aid can be construed as related to a\n\nchild’s ability to learn.” 575 F.3d at 244 (quotation omitted). Further, the court\n\nrejected the argument that a residential placement provides special education so\n\nlong as it utilizes similar modalities employed by schools. Id. at 245. Instead,\n\n“the relevant consideration is not the tool the institution uses, but rather the\n\nsubstantive goal sought to be achieved through the use of that tool.” Id. Because\n\nthe services offered by the residential treatment center in Mary T. were designed\n\nto help the child manage her medical condition, rather than to address her\n\neducational needs, the court concluded they were not reimbursable as special\n\neducation under the IDEA. Id. Stated differently, the court concluded the child’s\n\nlearning needs and medical needs were “severable.” Id. at 246. The court also\n\nconcluded the child’s treatment was not a “related service,” under the Act but was\n\ninstead an excluded “medical service” for which the Act does not provide\n\nreimbursement. Id. at 246–47; 20 U.S.C. § 1401(26)(A).\n\n      The Third Circuit approach has been followed, to varying degrees, by the\n\nFirst, Second, Fourth, Sixth, Eighth, Ninth, 2 Eleventh, and D.C. Circuits. See\n\n      2\n        Citing Clovis Unified School District v. California Office of Administrative\nHearings, 903 F.2d 635, 643 (9th Cir. 1990), the District argues the Ninth Circuit\nrejects the severability approach of the other circuits. In Clovis, the court stated\nthat when determining whether a placement is reimbursable as a related service\n                                                                        (continued...)\n\n                                          -12-\n\fRichardson Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Michael Z., 580 F.3d 286, 298 n.8 (5th Cir. 2009)\n\n(collecting cases). The Seventh, and, more recently, the Fifth Circuits have taken\n\na somewhat different approach. In Dale M. ex rel. Alice M. v. Board of\n\nEducation, 237 F.3d 813, 817 (7th Cir. 2001), the Seventh Circuit held that when\n\ndetermining the scope of the “related services” which are reimbursable under the\n\nAct, “[t]he essential distinction is between services primarily oriented toward\n\nenabling a child to obtain an education and services oriented more toward\n\nenabling the child to engage in noneducational activities.” Thus, the court\n\nconcluded the placement of a child with serious behavioral problems at a private\n\nboarding school was not reimbursable because the principal service provided by\n\nthe school to the child was confinement. Id. at 816–17. (“[T]he Elan School does\n\n\n      2\n       (...continued)\nunder the Act the “analysis must focus on whether . . . [the] placement may be\nconsidered necessary for educational purposes, or whether the placement is a\nresponse to medical, social, or emotional problems that is necessary quite apart\nfrom the learning process.” Id. (citing Kruelle v. New Castle Cnty. Sch. Dist., 642\nF.2d 687, 693 (3d Cir. 1990)). Although the court stated it was rejecting a\nversion of the severability analysis used by a lower court, it expressly relied upon\nKruelle in formulating its holding. Id. While we question the applicability of\nKruelle to the Act’s definition of “related services,” see infra Part III.A.2., other\ncases in the Ninth Circuit subsequent to Clovis confirm that its interpretation of\nthe Act is closer to the majority of circuits than to that of the Fifth or Seventh.\nSee, e.g., Seattle Sch. Dist. No. 1 v. B.S. ex rel. A.S., 82 F.3d 1493, 1502 (9th Cir.\n1996) (“That A.S.’s disability, like most disabilities under the IDEA, stems from\nmedical or psychiatric disorders, . . . and that Intermountain’s program addresses\nthese disorders in an attempt to ensure that A.S. is able to benefit from her\neducation, does not render the program invalid or remove the District’s financial\nresponsibility.”) In any event, our disposition of this appeal does not turn on the\ninterpretation of Ninth Circuit case law.\n\n                                         -13-\n\fnot provide psychological services, at least to Dale. For him all it provides is\n\nconfinement. . . . Elan is a jail substitute”). The court also purported to\n\ndistinguish Kruelle, suggesting the placement at issue was a response to problems\n\nwhich were segregable from the learning process. Id. at 818.\n\n      The Fifth Circuit explicitly rejected the Third Circuit’s approach,\n\ncontending it “expands school district liability beyond that required by IDEA.”\n\nMichael Z., 580 F.3d at 299. Instead, the Fifth Circuit set forth the following test:\n\n“In order for a residential placement to be appropriate under IDEA, the placement\n\nmust be 1) essential in order for the disabled child to receive a meaningful\n\neducational benefit, and 2) primarily oriented toward enabling the child to obtain\n\nan education.” Id. at 299. It clarified the first prong of its test to mean that “if a\n\nchild is able to receive an educational benefit without the residential placement . .\n\n. the school is not required to pay for it under IDEA.” Id. at 300. The second\n\nprong is “necessarily a fact-intensive inquiry,” requiring the court to consider a\n\nvariety of factors related to the placement including, but not limited to, the initial\n\nmotivation for the placement and the manner in which progress at the facility is\n\njudged. Id. at 301. Under the Fifth Circuit’s approach, after conducting an\n\n“analysis of the services as a whole,” courts “must then examine each constituent\n\npart of the placement to weed out inappropriate treatments from the appropriate\n\n(and therefore reimbursable) ones.” Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -14-\n\f      Here, the ALJ and district court concluded the placement at Innercept was\n\nreimbursable under the IDEA regardless of which approach was used to evaluate\n\nit. Under its application of the Third Circuit’s framework, the court concluded\n\nElizabeth’s medical, social, and emotional problems were not segregable from the\n\nlearning process. See Kruelle, 642 F.2d at 693. This conclusion rested on several\n\npieces of evidence. First, Aspen’s final report on Elizabeth indicated residential\n\ntreatment was necessary for Elizabeth to receive necessary clinical and\n\npsychiatric care and “remain[] on a clear and successful academic path.” In\n\nparticular, the report indicated Elizabeth “is likely to show improvements in her\n\nschool performance and behavior at a[] [residential treatment center] because of\n\nthe clinical milieu that pervades the academic environment.” Additionally, the\n\ncourt cited testimony before the IHO from Dr. Partha Gandhi, the director of\n\npsychology at Aspen; Dr. George Ullrich, the medical director and attending\n\npsychiatrist at Innercept; and David Miller, an assistant principal and counselor at\n\nHumanex, all indicating Elizabeth’s mental health and emotional needs were\n\nintertwined with her academic success.\n\n      Under the Fifth and Seventh Circuit tests, the ALJ and district court also\n\nconcluded the placement at Innercept was reimbursable. This conclusion, too,\n\nrested on several pieces of evidence: Innercept is a state-accredited educational\n\ninstitution in which Elizabeth worked toward her high school diploma. Elizabeth\n\nhad stated to the principal and director of education at Innercept that graduation\n\n                                         -15-\n\fwas important to her; her schedule at Innercept included three hours of classroom\n\ntime in the morning and one hour to ninety minutes of homework during the\n\nevening; and Innercept provided one-on-one instruction to Elizabeth for those\n\ntimes she was unable to participate in the classroom. The district court concluded\n\nthese factors made the case distinguishable from those in which parents sought\n\nreimbursement for placement at psychiatric hospitals which merely happened to\n\nprovide some educational services. Cf. Butler v. Evans, 225 F.3d 887, 893 (7th\n\nCir. 2000) (denying reimbursement for placement at hospital where “[t]here is\n\nscant evidence that the hospital provided or was equipped to provide anything\n\nmore than meager educational services.”).\n\n      The parties and amici differ as to the framework this court should adopt for\n\ndetermining whether a residential placement is reimbursable under the Act.\n\nParents, while maintaining the district court correctly concluded they were\n\nentitled to reimbursement under any test, urge the court to follow the Third\n\nCircuit approach. The District concedes it cannot prevail under the Third Circuit\n\napproach. It therefore argues this court should apply the “primarily oriented” test\n\nof the Seventh or Fifth Circuit and conclude the district court erred in determining\n\nInnercept was a reimbursable placement under the IDEA. In this case, however,\n\nit is unnecessary to endorse either approach because Elizabeth’s placement at\n\nInnercept is reimbursable under a straightforward application of the statutory text.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -16-\n\f      20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii) vests courts and hearing officers with the\n\nauthority to order reimbursement to parents who unilaterally enroll their child in a\n\n“private . . . secondary school without the consent of or referral by the public\n\nagency . . . .” 20 U.S.C. § 1401(27) defines “secondary school” as “a nonprofit\n\ninstitutional day or residential school, including a public secondary charter\n\nschool, that provides secondary education, as determined under State law . . . .”\n\n(emphasis added). Thus, one pre-requisite for the reimbursement of any private\n\nresidential placement is that it be at an institution with educational accreditation\n\nunder state law. Beyond that, there are two components of a FAPE under the\n\nIDEA: special education and related services. 20 U.S.C. § 1401(9). The Act\n\ndefines “special education” as “specially designed instruction, at no cost to\n\nparents, to meet the unique needs of a child with a disability, including . . .\n\ninstruction conducted in the classroom, in the home, in hospitals and institutions,\n\nand in other settings.” 20 U.S.C. § 1401(29)(A). The Act also provides a lengthy\n\ndefinition of the term “related services”:\n\n      The term “related services” means transportation, and such\n      developmental, corrective, and other supportive services (including\n      . . . psychological services, . . . social work services, school nurse\n      services designed to enable a child with a disability to receive a free\n      appropriate public education as described in the individualized\n      education program of the child, counseling services . . . and medical\n      services, except that such medical services shall be for diagnostic\n      and evaluation purposes only) as may be required to assist a child\n      with a disability to benefit from special education . . . .\n\n\n\n\n                                          -17-\n\f20 U.S.C. § 1401(26)(A). The Act’s definition of “related services” expressly\n\ncontemplates that a child is receiving some type of special education. Therefore,\n\na parental placement which does not provide the child with specially designed\n\ninstruction is not reimbursable even if some services provided at the placement\n\nmight otherwise be classifiable under the Act’s definition of “related services.”\n\n      If a child is receiving special education, however, Supreme Court precedent\n\nindicates the scope of the Act’s definition of “related services” is relatively broad.\n\nIn Irving Independent School District. v. Tatro, 468 U.S. 883, 891 (1984), the\n\nCourt held that the administration of clean intermittent catheterization services to\n\na public school student was a “related service” which the school was obliged to\n\nprovide under the Act because, without such services, the child could not remain\n\nat school during the day. The Court also concluded such services did not fall\n\nwithin the Act’s definition of “medical services,” for which a school district is\n\nonly obligated to provide for diagnostic and evaluation purposes. Id. at 891–92.\n\nThe Court approved Department of Education regulations which limited\n\nexcludable “medical services” to “services provided by a licensed physician.” Id.\n\nat 892. The Court reinforced this holding in Cedar Rapids Community School\n\nDistrict v. Garret F. ex rel Charlene F., 526 U.S. 66, 73 (1999), concluding a\n\nschool district was required to provide continuous one-on-one nursing services\n\nduring the school day to a ventilator-dependant public school student. Further,\n\nthe Court reaffirmed Tatro’s holding that the scope of the “medical services”\n\n                                         -18-\n\fexception under the Act is limited to services which must be performed by a\n\nphysician. Id. at 74, 76 (“Continuous services may be more costly and may\n\nrequire additional school personnel, but they are not thereby more ‘medical.’”).\n\n      The plain language of the Act thus supplies the appropriate framework\n\nthrough which to determine whether a unilateral private school placement without\n\nthe consent of or referral by the school district is reimbursable. A court or\n\nhearing officer must:\n\n      (1) Determine whether the school district provided or made a FAPE\n      available to the disabled child in a timely manner; if it did, the\n      unilateral parental placement is not reimbursable. See 20 U.S.C.\n      § 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii); then\n\n      (2) Determine whether the private placement is a state-accredited\n      elementary or secondary school; if not, the placement is not\n      reimbursable. Id. §§ 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii), 1401(27); then\n\n      (3) Determine whether the private placement provides special\n      education, i.e., “specially designed instruction . . . to meet the unique\n\n\n\n\n                                         -19-\n\f      needs 3 of a child with a disability”; if the placement provides no such\n      instruction, it is not reimbursable. Id. § 1401(29)(A).\n\n      (4) If the private placement provides additional services beyond\n      specially designed instruction to meet the child’s unique needs,\n      determine whether such additional services can be characterized as\n      “related services” under the Act, i.e., “transportation, and such\n      developmental, corrective, and other supportive services . . . as may\n      be required to assist a child with a disability to benefit from special\n      education,” excepting medical services which are not for diagnostic\n      and evaluation purposes. Id. § 1401(26). If the additional services\n      cannot be so characterized, they are not reimbursable.\n\n      Because this appeal can be resolved by a straightforward application of the\n\nstatutory text, it is unnecessary to adopt either the so-called “inextricably\n\nintertwined” 4 approach of the Third Circuit or the “primarily oriented” standard of\n\n      3\n        The concurrence suggests that the scope of the statutory term “special\neducation” should be limited to specially designed instruction to meet the unique\neducational needs of a child with a disability. Concurring Op. at 3–4. This\ninterpretation is plausible, although it leaves open the question of how broadly the\nterm “educational needs” can be construed. See, e.g., Kruelle, 642 F.2d at 693\n(“Where basic self-help and social skills . . . are lacking, formal education begins\nat that point.”(quotation omitted)); B.S., 82 F.3d at 1500 (“Everyone agrees that\nA.S. is exceptionally bright and thus was able to test appropriately on\nstandardized tests. This is not the sine qua non of ‘educational benefit,’\nhowever.”); see also H.R. Rep. 98-140, 1983 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2088, 2106\n(discussing possible amendment of Act’s definition of “special education” to refer\nto “unique educational needs” of disabled child but also noting “[i]t is the intent\nof the committee that the term ‘unique educational needs’ be broadly construed to\ninclude the handicapped child’s academic, social, health emotional,\ncommunicative, physical and vocational needs.”)). It is unnecessary to determine\nthe outer limits of this statutory term here, however, because the instruction at\nInnercept was designed to meet Elizabeth’s educational needs. See supra Part\nIII.A.3.\n      4\n       The term “inextricably intertwined test” itself appears to have been coined\nnot by any circuits which purportedly apply it, but rather by a circuit which\n                                                                       (continued...)\n\n                                         -20-\n\fthe Fifth and Seventh Circuits. 5 This permits us to avoid some of the interpretive\n\ndifficulties presented by the approaches of the other circuits. To begin, the case\n\nlaw is frequently imprecise as to what portion of the Act is being interpreted\n\nwhen a determination is made that a residential placement is reimbursable. For\n\nexample, the so-called “inextricably intertwined test” originally addressed only\n\nthe scope of the term “special education” under the Act, and was silent as to the\n\nscope of the term “related services.” Kruelle, 642 F.2d at 694 & n.23; see also\n\nMary T., 575 F.3d at 245–46 (applying Kruelle only to determine whether\n\ncontested services constitute “special education” under the Act). Subsequent to\n\nKruelle, however, both courts which purport to adopt and courts which purport to\n\nbreak from the Third Circuit approach frequently conflate the two statutory\n\nprovisions. See, e.g., Clovis Unified Sch. Dist. v. Cal. Office of Admin. Hearings,\n\n903 F.2d 635, 643–44 (9th Cir. 1990); Michael Z., 580 F.3d at 298; Dale M., 237\n\nF.3d at 817–18.\n\n\n\n\n      4\n       (...continued)\nrejected it. Compare Richardson Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Michael Z., 580 F.3d 286,\n298 (5th Cir. 2009), with Mary T. v. Sch. Dist., 575 F.3d 235, 243–44 (3d. Cir.\n2009), and Kruelle, 642 F.2d at 693.\n      5\n        The concurrence opines that the court’s opinion “venture[s] beyond . . .\nterra firma to offer a new (four step) test . . . for assessing private placements.”\nConcurring Op. at 2. The court’s opinion is not nearly so ambitious as to propose\na new test. The claims presented on appeal have merely been resolved by\napplying the plain text of the statute.\n\n                                        -21-\n\f      Considering the two provisions of the Act separately and in sequence also\n\nhighlights the fact-specific nature of most IDEA reimbursement claims. Thus,\n\ndetermining whether a child’s needs are “segregable” (as the Third Circuit defines\n\nthe term), while potentially helpful in some instances, is not central to a\n\nreviewing court’s task in every case. Assuredly, there are some cases in which\n\ncourts must decide just how broadly the Act’s definition of “special education”\n\nextends in order to effectuate the Act’s requirement that all children, no matter\n\nhow disabled, receive some meaningful educational benefit. See Kruelle, 642\n\nF.2d at 693; Thompson R2-J Sch. Dist. v. Luke P., 540 F.3d 1143, 1149 (10th Cir.\n\n2008); see also supra Part III.A.2 n.3. However, for others it may be clear or\n\nuncontested that a placement provides the type of “specially designed instruction”\n\ncontemplated by the Act, and the dispute will instead center on whether additional\n\nsupportive services provided at the placement are “required to assist” the child to\n\nobtain a meaningful educational benefit, i.e., whether such services are “related\n\nservices” under the Act.\n\n      A straightforward application of the Act’s text also dispenses with the need\n\nto fully dissect the amorphous, judicially crafted “primarily oriented” standard of\n\nthe Fifth and Seventh Circuits. Put simply, it is not at all clear that determining\n\nwhether a placement is “primarily oriented toward enabling a child to obtain an\n\neducation” sheds any light on the question of whether a placement provides\n\nspecially designed instruction to meet a child’s unique needs or whether\n\n                                         -22-\n\fadditional services provided by a placement are required to assist the child to\n\nbenefit from such instruction. In particular, in the context of the statutory term\n\n“related services,” the “primarily oriented” requirement is both over-inclusive and\n\nunder-inclusive. It is not difficult to imagine a residential placement providing\n\nservices that are required for a child to receive a meaningful education but are not\n\nthemselves “primarily oriented” toward educational goals. Conversely, it is also\n\npossible to imagine services which can be construed as primarily oriented toward\n\neducation but which are not required for a particular child to obtain an\n\neducational benefit.\n\n      Unquestionably, the genesis of the “primarily oriented” test is a concern\n\nwith expanding school district liability beyond the requirements of the IDEA. See\n\nMichael Z., 580 F.3d at 299. While a valid concern, the Act’s reimbursement\n\nprovisions already vest courts and hearing officers with the discretion to reduce or\n\ndeny reimbursement at multiple stages. See 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii)\n\n(describing circumstances in which a court or hearing officer “may require the\n\nagency to reimburse the parents for the cost” of private school enrollment\n\n(emphasis added)); id. § 1412(a)(10)(C)(iii) (describing circumstances in which\n\nreimbursement “may be reduced or denied” (emphasis added)). As both the\n\nSupreme Court and this court have made clear, the cost of the private placement\n\nand its impact on the school district’s budget is always a relevant consideration\n\n\n\n\n                                         -23-\n\ffor a court or hearing officer when fashioning relief. Carter, 510 U.S. at 15; L.B.,\n\n379 F.3d at 979 n.18.\n\n             3.    Elizabeth’s Placement at Innercept\n\n      Applying the above principles to the present case, this court concludes\n\nElizabeth’s placement at Innercept is reimbursable under the Act. Because\n\napplication of the plain text of the statute does not require any additional fact-\n\nfinding and would not require the district court to address issues it has not already\n\nconsidered, remand is unnecessary. Application of the first two steps is\n\nstraightforward: the District did not provide a FAPE to Elizabeth and has not\n\nchallenged that conclusion on appeal. Supra Part III.A.1. Further, the record\n\nindicates Innercept is an accredited educational facility in the state of Idaho\n\nstaffed by state-accredited teachers. It thus meets the Act’s definition of a\n\n“secondary school” as determined under state law. 20 U.S.C. § 1401(27).\n\n      As to the third step, the unchallenged findings of the IHO, ALJ, and district\n\ncourt support the conclusion that Innercept provided specially designed\n\ninstruction to meet Elizabeth’s unique needs. The IHO, ALJ, and district court\n\neach found Elizabeth’s time at Innercept included several hours per day of\n\ntraditional classroom instruction and one to one-and-a-half hours of directed\n\nhomework. Further, the district court found Innercept provides for one-on-one\n\ninstruction outside the classroom for times when Elizabeth was unable to\n\nparticipate in the classroom. Finally, although not noted by the district court, the\n\n                                         -24-\n\frecord before the IHO also indicates Elizabeth was enrolled in courses such as\n\nEnglish, World History, Math Concepts, and Speech.\n\n      Having determined the placement at Innercept includes appropriate “special\n\neducation,” as defined in the Act, we proceed to determine whether the remainder\n\nof the services for which Parents sought reimbursement constitute “related\n\nservices.” Notably, the District has never challenged the reimbursability of any\n\nof the specific services provided at Innercept. 6 Instead, the District has argued\n\nthat, according to the final report from Aspen, at least some of Elizabeth’s\n\neducational needs could be addressed in a non-residential setting. This argument,\n\nhowever, ignores the report’s conclusion that Elizabeth “is likely to show\n\nimprovements in her school performance and behavior at a[] [residential treatment\n\ncenter] because of the clinical milieu that pervades the academic environment.” It\n\nalso ignores the testimony of Dr. Gandhi, Dr. Ullrich, and David Miller indicating\n\nthat Elizabeth’s educational needs could not be addressed without also addressing\n\n\n      6\n         The closest the District ever came to developing such an argument was its\nassertion before the district court that $7,350.00 of Innercept’s $9,800.00 per\nmonth cost was medical in nature. Parents argued in response that the only\n“medical” services provided at Innercept were those provided by a licensed\nphysician, and that they amounted to four percent of Innercept’s total monthly\ncost. The district court concluded there was insufficient information in the record\nfor it to determine precisely how much reimbursement Parents were entitled to for\n“special education” and “related services” under the Act and how much of\nInnercept’s cost was not reimbursable as a medical service. The court therefore\ndirected Parents to obtain more detailed invoices from Innercept which\ndistinguished between services provided by physicians and non-physicians,\nordering reimbursement only for the latter.\n\n                                         -25-\n\fher behavioral needs. Finally, the District has argued Elizabeth’s placement at\n\nInnercept is not reimbursable because Elizabeth would have required mental\n\nhealth services regardless of whether she was receiving educational services. As\n\nset forth supra Part III.A.2, this argument relies on a reading of the Act at odds\n\nwith its plain language. Because the placement at Innercept provided both\n\nspecially designed instruction to meet Elizabeth’s unique needs and services\n\nrequired for her to benefit from that instruction, the district court properly\n\nconcluded it was reimbursable.\n\n      B.     Reduction or Denial of Reimbursement\n\n             1.     Statutory Framework and Standard of Review\n\n      When a disabled child is enrolled in a private school by her parents, 20\n\nU.S.C. § 1412(a)(10)(C)(iii) provides:\n\n      The cost of reimbursement . . . may be reduced or denied—\n\n      (I) if—\n\n             (aa) at the most recent IEP meeting that the parents\n             attended prior to removal of the child from the public\n             school, the parents did not inform the IEP Team that\n             they were rejecting the placement proposed by the\n             public agency to provide a free appropriate public\n             education to their child, including stating their concerns\n             and their intent to enroll their child in a private school at\n             public expense; or\n\n             (bb) 10 business days (including any holidays that occur\n             on a business day) prior to the removal of the child from\n             the public school, the parents did not give written notice\n\n\n                                         -26-\n\f             to the public agency of the information described in item\n             (aa);\n\n      (II) if, prior to the parents’ removal of the child from the public\n      school, the public agency informed the parents, through the notice\n      requirements described in section 1415(b)(3) of this title, of its intent\n      to evaluate the child (including a statement of the purpose of the\n      evaluation that was appropriate and reasonable), but the parents did\n      not make the child available for such evaluation; or\n\n      (III) upon a judicial finding of unreasonableness with respect to\n      actions taken by the parents.\n\nThus, even if a private placement is otherwise reimbursable under the IDEA, in\n\nsome circumstances the conduct of a child’s parents in obtaining the placement\n\nmay preclude or reduce reimbursement.\n\n      Here, the District argues, reimbursement should have been denied because\n\nParents did not comply with the ten-day notice requirement of\n\n§ 1412(a)(10)(C)(iii)(I)(bb) and because Parents did not make Elizabeth available\n\nfor an evaluation per § 1412(a)(10)(C)(iii)(II). In briefing this issue, neither the\n\nDistrict nor Parents address the standard of review. While, as a general matter,\n\nthis court applies a “modified de novo” standard of review in IDEA cases, see\n\nsupra Part III.A.1, because § 1412(a)(10)(C)(iii) describes circumstances in\n\nwhich a court may reduce or deny reimbursement, some courts have held a district\n\ncourt’s judgment under this portion of the Act is reviewed only for abuse of\n\ndiscretion. See Ashland Sch. Dist. v. E.H., 587 F.3d 1175, 1184 (9th Cir. 2009);\n\nMichael Z., 580 F.3d at 301. Here, the district court concluded Parents neither\n\n\n                                         -27-\n\fprovided insufficient notice to the District nor failed to timely make Elizabeth\n\navailable for evaluation and that even if presented with a closer question of\n\nsufficiency of notice or failure to make Elizabeth available for evaluation, it\n\nwould not have reduced or denied reimbursement. Nonetheless, the standard of\n\nreview issue need not be resolved here because even under a modified de novo\n\nstandard of review the district court properly refused to reduce or deny\n\nreimbursement under 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(10)(C)(iii).\n\n             2.    Ten-day Notice Requirement\n\n      To begin, Parents complied with the ten-day notice provision of\n\n§ 1412(a)(10)(C)(iii)(I) by notifying the District via a letter dated November 10,\n\n2008, of their intent to enroll Elizabeth at Innercept in ten business days. The\n\nDistrict, however, argues § 1412(a)(10)(C)(iii)(I)(bb) required Parents to provide\n\nten days’ notice of their intent to place Elizabeth at the Aspen Institute, and that\n\ntheir failure to do so constitutes grounds to reduce or deny reimbursement for\n\nElizabeth’s placement at Innercept. As noted by the IHO, ALJ, and district court,\n\nthe reference in § 1412(a)(10)(C)(iii)(I)(bb) to “the removal of the child from the\n\npublic school” cannot be read to cover every instance in which a child is\n\ntemporarily absent from school. In context, the limitations on reimbursement in\n\n§ 1412(a)(10)(C)(iii) affect § 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii), which addresses reimbursement\n\nfor the cost of enrollment in private school. Thus, the term “removal” in\n\n\n\n\n                                         -28-\n\f§ 1412(a)(10)(C)(iii)(I)(bb) must refer to disenrollment from the public school\n\nsystem with the intent to place the child in a private school.\n\n      A close reading of the ten-day notice provision confirms this interpretation\n\nof the statute. Section 1412(a)(10)(C)(iii)(I)(bb) of the IDEA states\n\nreimbursement may be reduced or denied if “10 business days . . . prior to the\n\nremoval of the child from the public school, the parents [fail to] give written\n\nnotice to the public agency of the information described in item (aa).” The\n\ninformation described in item (aa) includes the parents’ objection to the\n\nplacement proposed by the school district and their intent to enroll their child in\n\nprivate school at public expense. Here, even by the time Elizabeth was placed for\n\nevaluation and treatment at Aspen, Parents were not rejecting any placement\n\nproposed by the District because the IEP for the coming school year had not yet\n\nbeen completed and the District had not yet proposed a placement for that year.\n\nFurther, Parents could not have informed the District of their intent to enroll\n\nElizabeth in private school at public expense ten days prior to her placement at\n\nAspen because there is no evidence in the record indicating they had such\n\nintentions at that time. 7 Thus, the District’s reading of the statute would put\n\nParents in an impossible position, requiring them to come forward with non-\n\n\n\n\n      7\n       Parents have never sought reimbursement under the IDEA for Elizabeth’s\nhospitalization at Aspen.\n\n                                         -29-\n\fexistent information simply to remain eligible for reimbursement under the Act in\n\nthe event the District failed to provide a FAPE.\n\n      Finally, the District’s reading of the statute is inconsistent with its purpose:\n\naffording school districts the opportunity to address parental objections to a\n\nproposed IEP prior to the removal of a disabled child from public school. Berger\n\nv. Medina City Sch. Dist., 348 F.3d 513, 523 (6th Cir. 2003). Here, the notice\n\nprovided by Parents afforded the District with just such an opportunity. The\n\nDistrict’s refusal to take advantage of that opportunity stemmed from its\n\nerroneous position that it had no IDEA obligation to Elizabeth whatsoever\n\nbecause she was not physically present in Colorado. The ALJ and district court\n\neach concluded this position was legally untenable, and the District no longer\n\nadvances it on appeal. See Catlin v. Sobol, 93 F.3d 1112, 1123 (2d Cir. 1996)\n\n(noting that under the IDEA a child’s residence is the same as that of the child’s\n\nparents). The district court therefore correctly refused to reduce or deny\n\nreimbursement based on the IDEA’s ten-day notice provision.\n\n             3.    Failure to Make Elizabeth Available for Evaluation\n\n      The District also argues reimbursement should have been reduced or denied\n\nunder § 1412(a)(10)(C)(iii)(II) because Parents failed to make Elizabeth available\n\nfor an IEP evaluation after receiving notice of the District’s intent to conduct one.\n\nThe District cites cases indicating parents who unilaterally remove a child from a\n\npublic school system and place the child out of state before the public school is\n\n                                         -30-\n\fable to conduct an evaluation may lose their eligibility for reimbursement under\n\n§ 1412(a)(10)(C)(iii)(II). See, e.g., Patricia P. v. Bd. of Educ., 203 F.3d 462, 469\n\n(7th Cir. 2000). Here, however, it was the District who unilaterally withdrew\n\nElizabeth from Humanex upon learning of her hospitalization at Aspen. As of\n\nOctober 7, 2008, the District made clear its position it had no ongoing\n\nresponsibility to Elizabeth under the IDEA. As late as December 2008, well after\n\nthe ten-day notice period for Elizabeth’s placement at Innercept had elapsed,\n\nElizabeth’s mother offered “to start anew and all work together to complete\n\nElizabeth’s IEP.” The District declined, reiterating its position that, because\n\nElizabeth was in Idaho, it did not “presently have an obligation to evaluate,\n\nconvene IEP team meetings for, or otherwise serve Elizabeth under the IDEA.”\n\nBased on these facts, the IHO, ALJ, and district court concluded the District\n\nextinguished any obligation Parents had to make Elizabeth available for\n\nevaluation under § 1412(a)(10)(C)(iii)(II).\n\n      Urging a contrary conclusion, the District identifies three communications\n\nin which it stated it stood “ready, willing, and able” to serve Elizabeth under the\n\nIDEA should she return to Colorado. These communications, however, do not\n\nsatisfy the District’s obligations under the statute. Section 1412(a)(10)(C)(iii)(II)\n\nrequires that a public agency which gives notice of its intent to evaluate a child\n\nmust do so “through the notice requirements described in [20 U.S.C.]\n\n§1415(b)(3).” Section 1415(b)(3) requires educational agencies to provide\n\n                                         -31-\n\f“[w]ritten prior notice to the parents of the child . . . whenever the local\n\neducational agency . . . proposes to initiate or change; or . . . refuses to initiate or\n\nchange, the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of the child, or\n\nthe provision of a free appropriate public education to the child.” Such “written\n\nprior notice” must be “in accordance with [20 U.S.C. § 1415(c)(1)]”, id., which\n\nprovides:\n\n      The notice required by subsection (b)(3) shall include —\n\n             (A) a description of the action proposed or refused by\n             the agency;\n\n             (B) an explanation of why the agency proposes or\n             refuses to take the action and a description of each\n             evaluation procedure, assessment, record, or report the\n             agency used as a basis for the proposed or refused\n             action;\n\n             (C) a statement that the parents of a child with a\n             disability have protection under the procedural\n             safeguards of this subchapter and, if this notice is not an\n             initial referral for evaluation, the means by which a copy\n             of a description of the procedural safeguards can be\n             obtained;\n\n             (D) sources for parents to contact to obtain assistance in\n             understanding the provisions of this subchapter;\n\n             (E) a description of other options considered by the IEP Team\n             and the reason why those options were rejected; and\n\n             (F) a description of the factors that are relevant to the agency's\n             proposal or refusal.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -32-\n\fSee also 34 C.F.R. § 300.503. None of the communications identified by the\n\nDistrict meet these requirements, and the District makes no attempt to show that\n\nthey do. Because the District did not properly “inform[] the parents . . . of its\n\nintent to evaluate the child,” 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(10)(C)(iii)(II), the district court\n\nproperly refused to reduce or deny reimbursement to Parents based on their\n\nalleged failure to make Elizabeth available for such an evaluation. 8\n\nIV.   Conclusion\n\n      For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n      8\n        Aside from its failure to comply with the notice requirements of 20 U.S.C.\n§ 1415(b)(3), the District’s characterization of its statements that it stood “ready\nwilling and able” to provide a FAPE to Elizabeth as a request to conduct an\nevaluation is dubious. Read in context with the District’s repeated statements that\nit had no obligation to Elizabeth under the IDEA because she was not physically\npresent in Colorado, at most the communications identified by the District could\nbe read for the proposition that the District’s offer to evaluate Elizabeth was\nconditioned on her permanent return to Colorado. The IDEA makes no allowance\nfor such a condition.\n\n                                         -33-\n\f11-1334, Jefferson County School District R-1 v. Elizabeth E.\n\nGORSUCH, J., Circuit Judge, concurring in the judgment.\n\n      The court’s judgment is undoubtedly right and easily arrived at. To be\n\nsure, the Third, Fifth, and Seventh Circuits have adopted somewhat different (if\n\nalso somewhat overlapping) tests for determining when public schools must pay\n\nprivate school tuition for disabled students. See Richardson Indep. Sch. Dist. v.\n\nMichael Z., 580 F.3d 286 (5th Cir. 2009); Dale M. ex rel. Alice M. v. Bd. of\n\nEduc., 237 F.3d 813 (7th Cir. 2001); Kruelle v. New Castle Cnty. Sch. Dist., 642\n\nF.2d 687 (3d Cir. 1981). But as the district court rightly recognized, there’s no\n\nneed to invite ourselves into their dispute. No need because all of the available\n\ntests point to the same conclusion in this particular case: Elizabeth is entitled to a\n\nprivate placement.\n\n      As the district court explained, the defendant school district failed to\n\nprovide Elizabeth with a free and appropriate public education, her private\n\nplacement was essential to ensure she received a meaningful educational benefit,\n\nand the private placement was primarily oriented toward enabling her to obtain an\n\neducation. All this, the district court concluded, made Elizabeth’s private\n\nplacement appropriate under any plausible test — even under the test favored by\n\nthe school district and adopted by the Fifth Circuit. See Richardson, 580 F.3d at\n\n299. Neither did the school district in this case present any serious challenge to\n\nthe specific amounts Elizabeth incurred in connection with her private placement\n\n(for her education or related services); instead, as the district court observed, the\n\fschool district effectively chose to confine its attack to the propriety of her\n\nplacement in the first place.\n\n      My colleagues and I agree with the district court’s holdings on all these\n\ncounts and no doubt this forms the narrowest and controlling ground for affirming\n\nthe case before us. For their part, my colleagues venture beyond this terra firma\n\nto offer a new (four step) test of their own for assessing private placements —\n\none that shares much in common with but also differs from the copious competing\n\ntests already circulating among circuit courts. I do not for a moment question the\n\nvalue of my colleagues’ enterprise: stirring the pot may help courts find just the\n\nright recipe in the end. In particular, my colleagues do well to remind us that\n\ndeciding whether a private school placement is appropriate (step 3) is an\n\nanalytically separate and distinct task from the job of ascertaining whether each\n\nrelated service provided by that school (step 4) is subject to reimbursement by a\n\npublic school district. Op. at 20-21. But it is equally clear that a new test isn’t\n\nnecessary to the disposition of this case: Elizabeth wins under any test. See\n\nNLRB v. Int’l Bhd. of Elec. Workers, 481 U.S. 573, 591 n.15 (1987) (statements\n\n“unnecessary to the disposition ” are “dict[a]” ); United States v. Villarreal - Ortiz,\n\n553 F.3d 1326, 1328 n.3 (10th Cir. 2009) (same).\n\n      Beyond that, I offer only this. In venturing their own test, my colleagues\n\ndo not expressly condition private placement on a showing that it is essential to\n\nprovide a meaningful educational benefit to the child. Instead, prong three of\n\n                                           -2-\n\ftheir test says merely that private placement is appropriate if it provides\n\n“specially designed instruction . . . to meet the [child’s] unique needs.” Op. at\n\n19. Reading that passage in isolation, one might forgive future litigants if they\n\nwonder whether my colleagues believe public school districts must pay for private\n\nschool placement even if the new school’s “instruction” is limited to addressing\n\nsocial or emotional problems or life challenges.\n\n      Such a reading, however, would be mistaken. Under IDEA, public school\n\nofficials must evaluate the disabled students they serve and offer them\n\nindividualized plans “reasonably calculated to enable [them] to receive\n\neducational benefits.” Bd. of Educ. v. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176, 182, 207 (1982)\n\n(emphasis added); see also Thompson R2-J Sch. Dist. v. Luke P. ex rel. Jeff P.,\n\n540 F.3d 1143, 1148-50 (10th Cir. 2008). If the public school fails to provide\n\nsome meaningful educational benefit to the child, it must finance a private\n\nplacement to get the job done. 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii); see\n\nalso Winkelman ex rel. Winkelman v. Parma City Sch. Dist., 550 U.S. 516, 524,\n\n526 (2007). However else they may disagree, all of our sister circuits agree a\n\nprivate placement under IDEA is permissible only if it is necessary to supply the\n\nchild with a meaningful educational benefit the public school has proven unable\n\nor unwilling to supply — not to address purely social, emotional, or medical\n\nneeds. See, e.g., Kruelle, 642 F.2d at 693 (IDEA requires courts to ask whether\n\nplacement “may be considered necessary for educational purposes” rather than to\n\n                                         -3-\n\faddress “medical, social, or emotional” issues); Mary T. v. Sch. Dist. of Phila.,\n\n575 F.3d 235, 245-46 (3d Cir. 2009) (the required “link . . . between placement\n\nand the student’s learning needs” was absent where the instructional program\n\naddressed “medical, rather than educational, conditions”); Richardson, 580 F.3d\n\nat 298-300 (first component of its test is whether private placement is “essential\n\nin order for the disabled child to receive a meaningful educational benefit” rather\n\nthan to address “medical, social, or emotional problems”); Dale M., 237 F.3d at\n\n817 (same). This conclusion unsurprisingly aligns with Congress’s stated purpose\n\nin enacting IDEA: its wish to ensure public schools address the “educational\n\nneeds” of “children with disabilities,” not to force public schools to displace all\n\nother social service agencies and become the providers of first resort of all\n\nmedical, emotional, and social care and instruction. 20 U.S.C. § 1400(c)(2)\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n      Certainly I do not read my colleagues as disagreeing with this (rare, in this\n\narena) point of agreement among our sister courts. There is nothing in my\n\ncolleagues’ opinion openly registering any disagreement; to the contrary, their\n\nopinion appears to sound regular notes of concurrence even if the terms of their\n\nproffered test aren’t entirely clear. See, e.g., Op. at 22 (noting that “related\n\nservices” under their fourth test must “assist the child to obtain a meaningful\n\neducational benefit” (emphasis added) (internal quotation mark omitted)); id. at\n\n25 (expert testimony that “Elizabeth’s educational needs could not be addressed\n\n                                          -4-\n\fwithout also addressing her behavioral needs” supports reimbursement (emphasis\n\nadded)). Neither does their logic suggest that IDEA mandates reimbursement for\n\nservices unnecessary to supply a meaningful educational benefit — services our\n\nexisting circuit precedent places wholly outside the “free appropriate public\n\neducation” the school district must supply. See, e.g., Thompson, 540 F.3d at\n\n1150.\n\n        With these observations, I am pleased to join the court’s judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\f",

Introduction\n\n      Defendant-Appellee Elizabeth E., at all times relevant to this appeal, was a\n\nstudent in the Jefferson County, Colorado school system with substantial\n\nbehavioral and emotional issues for which she required special education under\n\nthe Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act (“IDEA” or the “Act”), 20\n\nU.S.C. § 1400. In November 2008, Elizabeth’s parents, Roxanne B. and David E.\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\f(“Parents”), enrolled her at Innercept, LLC (“Innercept”), a residential treatment\n\ncenter in Idaho, and sought reimbursement from Plaintiff-Appellant Jefferson\n\nCounty School District R-1 (the “District”). See 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii).\n\nAn Impartial Hearing Officer (IHO) concluded Parents were entitled to\n\nreimbursement for the placement under the Act. That decision was affirmed by a\n\nstate Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), whose decision was, in turn, affirmed by\n\nthe United States District Court for the District of Colorado. The District\n\nappeals, arguing Innercept is not a reimbursable placement under the IDEA and\n\nthat Parents’ conduct precluded reimbursement. Exercising jurisdiction pursuant\n\nto 28 U.S.C. § 1291, this court affirms the judgment of the district court.\n\nII.   Background\n\n      A. Statutory Framework\n\n      The IDEA provides federal funding to states to assist with the education of\n\ndisabled children on the condition that states comply with the Act’s “extensive\n\ngoals and procedures.” Bd. of Educ. v. Rowley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110774\"><a href=\"/opinion/110774/hendrick-hudson-dist-bd-of-ed-v-rowley/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">176</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 179 (1982). 1 One\n\nof the Act’s stated purposes is “to ensure that all children with disabilities have\n\navailable to them a free appropriate public education that emphasizes special\n\neducation and related services designed to meet their unique needs and prepare\n\nthem for further education, employment, and independent living.” 20 U.S.C.\n\n      1\n      The IDEA was originally titled the Education of the Handicapped Act; its\nname was changed in 1990. See Ellenberg v. N.M. Military Inst., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"168892\"><a href=\"/opinion/168892/ellenberg-v-nm-military-inst/\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1262</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n1268 n.1 (10th Cir. 2007).\n\n                                         -3-\n\f§ 1400(d)(1)(A). States that receive federal funding under the IDEA must\n\nprovide all eligible students with a free appropriate public education (“FAPE”).\n\nId. § 1412(a)(1)(A); Sytsema v. Acad. Sch. Dist. No. 20, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"171152\"><a href=\"/opinion/171152/sytsema-ex-rel-sytsema-v-academy-school-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">538</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1306</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1312\n\n(10th Cir. 2008). “To provide an eligible student with a FAPE, states must\n\ndevelop an [Individualized Education Plan] for each qualifying student.”\n\nSytsema, 538 F.3d at 1312. An Individualized Education Plan (“IEP”) is a\n\ndetailed written document which describes the student’s educational goals for an\n\nacademic year and establishes a plan to achieve those goals. See id.; 20 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1414(d)(1)(A)(I). The Act sets forth detailed procedures through which an IEP\n\nis to be developed with the participation of the child’s parents, teachers, special\n\neducation teachers, school officials, and other parties with knowledge of the\n\nchild’s special needs. See generally 20 U.S.C. § 1414(d). Further, the Act\n\nrequires states to develop and maintain procedural safeguards to ensure disabled\n\nchildren receive a FAPE. See id. § 1415. Such procedures include an impartial\n\ndue process hearing to address parental complaints over a school district’s actions\n\nwith respect to a child’s IEP. Id. § 1415(f).\n\n      B. Factual Background\n\n      Though the parties disagree on the import of certain facts, their versions of\n\nevents which gave rise to these proceedings are substantially identical and any\n\ndifferences are not material to our analysis. Elizabeth was born in 1991. Parents\n\nbecame her foster parents when she was sixteen months old after she was\n\n                                          -4-\n\fneglected by her birth parents. Parents adopted Elizabeth when she was three-\n\nand-a-half years old. In March 2000, Elizabeth and Parents moved to Colorado\n\nwhere she attended public school and was identified as a student eligible for\n\nspecial education under the IDEA.\n\n      Pursuant to two consecutive mediated settlements between Parents and the\n\nDistrict concerning whether the District was meeting its IDEA obligations,\n\nElizabeth attended ninth and tenth grade at Humanex Academy, a private school\n\nin Colorado which specializes in the education of children with significant\n\nlearning disabilities and emotional and behavioral issues. At Humanex, Elizabeth\n\nwould typically start out well early in the year but struggle academically and\n\nsocially by the end of the year. By the end of the 2007-08 school year, Elizabeth\n\nhad not earned enough credits to advance to the eleventh grade. Parents and the\n\nDistrict began discussions related to Elizabeth’s placement options. On August\n\n11, 2008, Parents and the District entered into a settlement agreement pursuant to\n\nwhich the District would pay tuition at Humanex during the 2008-09 academic\n\nyear. The agreement also called for an IEP team meeting to be convened by\n\nAugust 29, 2008, to arrange for an evaluation of Elizabeth. Meanwhile,\n\nElizabeth’s behavior at home began to deteriorate, and Parents commenced\n\nconsideration of temporary psychiatric hospitalization options for her. Parents\n\nadvised the District they were considering such hospitalization on August 15,\n\n2008. On August 20, 2008, Elizabeth was admitted to the Aspen Institute for\n\n                                         -5-\n\fBehavioral Assessment in Utah; on August 26, Parents notified the District of the\n\nplacement by email.\n\n      On September 24, 2008, the director of Humanex notified Parents that the\n\nDistrict had withdrawn Elizabeth from the school because it was unwilling to\n\nincur the cost of her tuition when she was not in attendance. The District took\n\nthis position notwithstanding an agreement it had with Humanex whereby it\n\nwould be refunded at the end of the semester for any months Elizabeth did not\n\nattend. Parents, through counsel, notified the District they considered the\n\nnonpayment of Elizabeth’s tuition at Humanex a breach of the parties’ settlement\n\nagreement. The District, also through counsel, responded: “[I]t appears that at\n\nthis point, the settlement agreement is moot, as parents have unilaterally placed\n\nElizabeth at the Aspen Center in Utah. As such, Elizabeth is not a District\n\nstudent, and the District has no on-going responsibility to Elizabeth under the\n\nIDEA.”\n\n      In a letter dated November 10, 2008, Parents notified the District they\n\nintended to enroll Elizabeth at Innercept in Idaho in ten business days and that\n\nthey would seek reimbursement for the cost of the placement. See 34 C.F.R.\n\n§ 300.104. On November 20, 2008, the District responded:\n\n      As you are aware, pursuant to a settlement agreement, the District\n      was in the process of evaluating Elizabeth to develop an\n      individualized education program and appropriate placement for\n      Elizabeth when her parents unilaterally placed her in a program in\n      Utah. It now appears that her parents are transferring Elizabeth to a\n\n                                         -6-\n\f      program in Idaho. The School District will not be providing\n      reimbursement to the family, but stands ready, willing, and able to\n      provide Elizabeth with a free appropriate public education if she\n      returns to the School District.\n\nOn December 3, 2008, Elizabeth’s mother stated in an email to the District:\n\n      [We] think that a more productive and cost-efficient way to move\n      forward, rather than drawing lines in the sand, is to start anew and all\n      work together to complete Elizabeth’s IEP. How would you like to\n      proceed with this process? What do you think the next steps should\n      be? Who do you see participating on the IEP team?\n\nThe District responded on December 9, 2008:\n\n      [Because] you unilaterally placed her in Idaho, the District does not\n      presently have an obligation to evaluate, convene IEP team meetings\n      for, or otherwise serve Elizabeth under the IDEA. However . . . the\n      District stands ready, willing, and able to evaluate and provide\n      Elizabeth with a free appropriate public education upon her return to\n      the District.\n\nIn response to another email from Elizabeth’s mother stating Elizabeth “is still\n\nunder contract with Jefferson County for the 2008–09 school year,” the District\n\nreiterated it would re-engage in the effort to provide an IEP for Elizabeth only if\n\nshe returned to Jefferson County.\n\n      Parents requested an administrative due process hearing and reimbursement\n\nfor Elizabeth’s placement at Innercept. See 20 U.S.C. § 1415(f). After\n\nconducting a five-day hearing in August 2009, the IHO issued a decision\n\nconcluding the District failed to make a FAPE available to Elizabeth in a timely\n\nmanner prior to her enrollment at Innercept, that Innercept was a reimbursable\n\nplacement under the IDEA, and Parents were entitled to reimbursement from the\n\n                                         -7-\n\fDistrict for that enrollment. The IHO declined to deny or reduce reimbursement\n\nbased on the District’s allegations that Parents failed to provide sufficient notice\n\nprior to Elizabeth’s placement, failed to make Elizabeth available for an\n\nevaluation, or otherwise acted unreasonably. An ALJ affirmed substantially all of\n\nthe IHO’s conclusions, reversing only the IHO’s award of travel costs to and from\n\nInnercept for family therapy. The District then brought an action in the United\n\nStates District Court for the District of Colorado, seeking review of the ALJ’s\n\ndecision pursuant to 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(3)(A). The district court affirmed the\n\ndecision of the ALJ.\n\n      At no point before the ALJ, district court, or this court has the District\n\nchallenged the IHO’s conclusion it failed to provide a FAPE to Elizabeth.\n\nInstead, the District advances two defenses to reimbursement under the IDEA.\n\nFirst, the District argues Elizabeth’s placement at Innercept is not reimbursable\n\nunder the IDEA because it does not provide her with “special education” and\n\n“related services” as defined in the Act. Second, the District argues\n\nreimbursement should have been reduced or denied pursuant to 20 U.S.C. §\n\n1412(a)(10)(C)(iii).\n\n\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\fIII.

Parents who make unilateral placements at a private school, however, “do\n\nso at their own financial risk.

Although it did\n\nnot provide a FAPE to Elizabeth, the District contends Parents are still not\n\nentitled to reimbursement because the placement at Innercept was not “proper”\n\nunder the IDEA. More precisely, the District contends the cost of Elizabeth’s\n\nplacement at Innercept is not reimbursable because the services provided do not\n\nconstitute “special education” and “related services” under the Act.\n\n      Courts have taken different approaches in determining whether a private\n\nresidential placement is reimbursable under the IDEA. In Kruelle v. New Castle\n\nCounty School District, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">642</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">687</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 693–94 (3d Cir. 1981), the Third Circuit\n\nheld that when determining whether a residential placement is reimbursable as\n\nspecial education under the Act the “[a]nalysis must focus . . . on whether\n\n                                        -10-\n\ffull-time placement may be considered necessary for educational purposes, or\n\nwhether the residential placement is a response to medical, social or emotional\n\nproblems that are segregable from the learning process.” Kruelle involved a\n\nclaim for reimbursement by the parents of Paul Kruelle, a child with an I.Q. well\n\nbelow thirty who suffered from severe physical and emotional problems. Id. at\n\n688–89. After concluding the school district’s proffered educational plan did not\n\nprovide a FAPE within the meaning of the Act, the district court ordered the\n\nschool district to provide reimbursement for a full-time residential program. Id.\n\nat 690. Affirming this judgment, the court rejected the argument that the\n\nresidential placement was not reimbursable because it was required for non-\n\neducational reasons, such as medical and domiciliary care, noting “the concept of\n\neducation is necessarily broad with respect to persons such as Paul,” id. at 693,\n\nwho could not walk, dress himself, or eat unaided, id. at 688. The discussion in\n\nKruelle addressed only whether the residential placement at issue provided\n\n“special education,” within the meaning of the Act. Id. at 694 n.23.\n\n      Recently, in Mary T. v. School District of Philadelphia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1213773\"><a href=\"/opinion/1213773/mary-t-v-school-dist-of-philadelphia/\"><span class=\"volume\">575</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">235</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n248–49 (3d Cir. 2009), the Third Circuit clarified its holding in Kruelle,\n\nconcluding the parents of a child with severe emotional disabilities were not\n\nentitled to reimbursement for the child’s placement in a long-term psychiatric\n\nresidential treatment center. The treatment center had no educational\n\naccreditation, on-site school, special education teachers, or school affiliation. Id.\n\n                                         -11-\n\fat 239. Citing Kruelle, the Third Circuit noted, “not all services that can be\n\nbroadly construed as educational are cognizable under IDEA . . . because\n\nultimately any life support system or medical aid can be construed as related to a\n\nchild’s ability to learn.” 575 F.3d at 244 (quotation omitted). Further, the court\n\nrejected the argument that a residential placement provides special education so\n\nlong as it utilizes similar modalities employed by schools. Id. at 245. Instead,\n\n“the relevant consideration is not the tool the institution uses, but rather the\n\nsubstantive goal sought to be achieved through the use of that tool.” Id. Because\n\nthe services offered by the residential treatment center in Mary T. were designed\n\nto help the child manage her medical condition, rather than to address her\n\neducational needs, the court concluded they were not reimbursable as special\n\neducation under the IDEA. Id. Stated differently, the court concluded the child’s\n\nlearning needs and medical needs were “severable.” Id. at 246. The court also\n\nconcluded the child’s treatment was not a “related service,” under the Act but was\n\ninstead an excluded “medical service” for which the Act does not provide\n\nreimbursement. Id. at 246–47; 20 U.S.C. § 1401(26)(A).\n\n      The Third Circuit approach has been followed, to varying degrees, by the\n\nFirst, Second, Fourth, Sixth, Eighth, Ninth, 2 Eleventh, and D.C. Circuits. See\n\n      2\n        Citing Clovis Unified School District v.

The Seventh, and, more recently, the Fifth Circuits have taken\n\na somewhat different approach. In Dale M. ex rel. Alice M. v. Board of\n\nEducation, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771757\"><a href=\"/opinion/771757/dale-m-by-his-mother-and-next-friend-alice-m-v-board-of-education-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">237</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">813</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 817 (7th Cir. 2001), the Seventh Circuit held that when\n\ndetermining the scope of the “related services” which are reimbursable under the\n\nAct, “[t]he essential distinction is between services primarily oriented toward\n\nenabling a child to obtain an education and services oriented more toward\n\nenabling the child to engage in noneducational activities.” Thus, the court\n\nconcluded the placement of a child with serious behavioral problems at a private\n\nboarding school was not reimbursable because the principal service provided by\n\nthe school to the child was confinement. Id. at 816–17. (“[T]he Elan School does\n\n\n      2\n       (...continued)\nunder the Act the “analysis must focus on whether . . . [the] placement may be\nconsidered necessary for educational purposes, or whether the placement is a\nresponse to medical, social, or emotional problems that is necessary quite apart\nfrom the learning process.” Id. (citing Kruelle v. New Castle Cnty. Sch.

Although the court stated it was rejecting a\nversion of the severability analysis used by a lower court, it expressly relied upon\nKruelle in formulating its holding. Id. While we question the applicability of\nKruelle to the Act’s definition of “related services,” see infra Part III.A.2., other\ncases in the Ninth Circuit subsequent to Clovis confirm that its interpretation of\nthe Act is closer to the majority of circuits than to that of the Fifth or Seventh.\nSee, e.g., Seattle Sch. Dist. No. 1 v. B.S. ex rel. A.S., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"717567\"><a href=\"/opinion/717567/seattle-school-district-no-1-a-municipal-corporation-v-bs-as-parent/\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1493</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1502 (9th Cir.\n1996) (“That A.S.’s disability, like most disabilities under the IDEA, stems from\nmedical or psychiatric disorders, . . . and that Intermountain’s program addresses\nthese disorders in an attempt to ensure that A.S. is able to benefit from her\neducation, does not render the program invalid or remove the District’s financial\nresponsibility.”) In any event, our disposition of this appeal does not turn on the\ninterpretation of Ninth Circuit case law.\n\n                                         -13-\n\fnot provide psychological services, at least to Dale. For him all it provides is\n\nconfinement. . . . Elan is a jail substitute”). The court also purported to\n\ndistinguish Kruelle, suggesting the placement at issue was a response to problems\n\nwhich were segregable from the learning process. Id. at 818.\n\n      The Fifth Circuit explicitly rejected the Third Circuit’s approach,\n\ncontending it “expands school district liability beyond that required by IDEA.”\n\nMichael Z., 580 F.3d at 299. Instead, the Fifth Circuit set forth the following test:\n\n“In order for a residential placement to be appropriate under IDEA, the placement\n\nmust be 1) essential in order for the disabled child to receive a meaningful\n\neducational benefit, and 2) primarily oriented toward enabling the child to obtain\n\nan education.” Id. at 299. It clarified the first prong of its test to mean that “if a\n\nchild is able to receive an educational benefit without the residential placement . .\n\n. the school is not required to pay for it under IDEA.” Id. at 300. The second\n\nprong is “necessarily a fact-intensive inquiry,” requiring the court to consider a\n\nvariety of factors related to the placement including, but not limited to, the initial\n\nmotivation for the placement and the manner in which progress at the facility is\n\njudged. Id. at 301. Under the Fifth Circuit’s approach, after conducting an\n\n“analysis of the services as a whole,” courts “must then examine each constituent\n\npart of the placement to weed out inappropriate treatments from the appropriate\n\n(and therefore reimbursable) ones.” Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -14-\n\f      Here, the ALJ and district court concluded the placement at Innercept was\n\nreimbursable under the IDEA regardless of which approach was used to evaluate\n\nit. Under its application of the Third Circuit’s framework, the court concluded\n\nElizabeth’s medical, social, and emotional problems were not segregable from the\n\nlearning process. See Kruelle, 642 F.2d at 693. This conclusion rested on several\n\npieces of evidence. First, Aspen’s final report on Elizabeth indicated residential\n\ntreatment was necessary for Elizabeth to receive necessary clinical and\n\npsychiatric care and “remain[] on a clear and successful academic path.” In\n\nparticular, the report indicated Elizabeth “is likely to show improvements in her\n\nschool performance and behavior at a[] [residential treatment center] because of\n\nthe clinical milieu that pervades the academic environment.” Additionally, the\n\ncourt cited testimony before the IHO from Dr. Partha Gandhi, the director of\n\npsychology at Aspen; Dr. George Ullrich, the medical director and attending\n\npsychiatrist at Innercept; and David Miller, an assistant principal and counselor at\n\nHumanex, all indicating Elizabeth’s mental health and emotional needs were\n\nintertwined with her academic success.\n\n      Under the Fifth and Seventh Circuit tests, the ALJ and district court also\n\nconcluded the placement at Innercept was reimbursable. This conclusion, too,\n\nrested on several pieces of evidence: Innercept is a state-accredited educational\n\ninstitution in which Elizabeth worked toward her high school diploma. Elizabeth\n\nhad stated to the principal and director of education at Innercept that graduation\n\n                                         -15-\n\fwas important to her; her schedule at Innercept included three hours of classroom\n\ntime in the morning and one hour to ninety minutes of homework during the\n\nevening; and Innercept provided one-on-one instruction to Elizabeth for those\n\ntimes she was unable to participate in the classroom. The district court concluded\n\nthese factors made the case distinguishable from those in which parents sought\n\nreimbursement for placement at psychiatric hospitals which merely happened to\n\nprovide some educational services. Cf. Butler v. Evans, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770306\"><a href=\"/opinion/770306/andrea-n-butler-emmalea-butler-and-ted-butler-v-h-dean-evans/\"><span class=\"volume\">225</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">887</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 893 (7th\n\nCir. 2000) (denying reimbursement for placement at hospital where “[t]here is\n\nscant evidence that the hospital provided or was equipped to provide anything\n\nmore than meager educational services.”).\n\n      The parties and amici differ as to the framework this court should adopt for\n\ndetermining whether a residential placement is reimbursable under the Act.\n\nParents, while maintaining the district court correctly concluded they were\n\nentitled to reimbursement under any test, urge the court to follow the Third\n\nCircuit approach. The District concedes it cannot prevail under the Third Circuit\n\napproach. It therefore argues this court should apply the “primarily oriented” test\n\nof the Seventh or Fifth Circuit and conclude the district court erred in determining\n\nInnercept was a reimbursable placement under the IDEA. In this case, however,\n\nit is unnecessary to endorse either approach because Elizabeth’s placement at\n\nInnercept is reimbursable under a straightforward application of the statutory text.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -16-\n\f      20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii) vests courts and hearing officers with the\n\nauthority to order reimbursement to parents who unilaterally enroll their child in a\n\n“private . . . secondary school without the consent of or referral by the public\n\nagency . . . .” 20 U.S.C. § 1401(27) defines “secondary school” as “a nonprofit\n\ninstitutional day or residential school, including a public secondary charter\n\nschool, that provides secondary education, as determined under State law . . . .”\n\n(emphasis added). Thus, one pre-requisite for the reimbursement of any private\n\nresidential placement is that it be at an institution with educational accreditation\n\nunder state law. Beyond that, there are two components of a FAPE under the\n\nIDEA: special education and related services. 20 U.S.C. § 1401(9). The Act\n\ndefines “special education” as “specially designed instruction, at no cost to\n\nparents, to meet the unique needs of a child with a disability, including . . .\n\ninstruction conducted in the classroom, in the home, in hospitals and institutions,\n\nand in other settings.” 20 U.S.C. § 1401(29)(A). The Act also provides a lengthy\n\ndefinition of the term “related services”:\n\n      The term “related services” means transportation, and such\n      developmental, corrective, and other supportive services (including\n      . . . psychological services, . . . social work services, school nurse\n      services designed to enable a child with a disability to receive a free\n      appropriate public education as described in the individualized\n      education program of the child, counseling services . . . and medical\n      services, except that such medical services shall be for diagnostic\n      and evaluation purposes only) as may be required to assist a child\n      with a disability to benefit from special education . . . .\n\n\n\n\n                                          -17-\n\f20 U.S.C. § 1401(26)(A). The Act’s definition of “related services” expressly\n\ncontemplates that a child is receiving some type of special education. Therefore,\n\na parental placement which does not provide the child with specially designed\n\ninstruction is not reimbursable even if some services provided at the placement\n\nmight otherwise be classifiable under the Act’s definition of “related services.”\n\n      If a child is receiving special education, however, Supreme Court precedent\n\nindicates the scope of the Act’s definition of “related services” is relatively broad.\n\nIn Irving Independent School District. v. Tatro, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111261\"><a href=\"/opinion/111261/irving-independent-school-dist-v-tatro/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">883</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 891 (1984), the\n\nCourt held that the administration of clean intermittent catheterization services to\n\na public school student was a “related service” which the school was obliged to\n\nprovide under the Act because, without such services, the child could not remain\n\nat school during the day. The Court also concluded such services did not fall\n\nwithin the Act’s definition of “medical services,” for which a school district is\n\nonly obligated to provide for diagnostic and evaluation purposes. Id. at 891–92.\n\nThe Court approved Department of Education regulations which limited\n\nexcludable “medical services” to “services provided by a licensed physician.” Id.\n\nat 892. The Court reinforced this holding in Cedar Rapids Community School\n\nDistrict v. Garret F. ex rel Charlene F., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118269\"><a href=\"/opinion/118269/cedar-rapids-community-school-dist-v-garret-f/\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">66</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 73 (1999), concluding a\n\nschool district was required to provide continuous one-on-one nursing services\n\nduring the school day to a ventilator-dependant public school student. Further,\n\nthe Court reaffirmed Tatro’s holding that the scope of the “medical services”\n\n                                         -18-\n\fexception under the Act is limited to services which must be performed by a\n\nphysician. Id. at 74, 76 (“Continuous services may be more costly and may\n\nrequire additional school personnel, but they are not thereby more ‘medical.’”).\n\n      The plain language of the Act thus supplies the appropriate framework\n\nthrough which to determine whether a unilateral private school placement without\n\nthe consent of or referral by the school district is reimbursable. A court or\n\nhearing officer must:\n\n      (1) Determine whether the school district provided or made a FAPE\n      available to the disabled child in a timely manner; if it did, the\n      unilateral parental placement is not reimbursable. See 20 U.S.C.\n      § 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii); then\n\n      (2) Determine whether the private placement is a state-accredited\n      elementary or secondary school; if not, the placement is not\n      reimbursable. Id. §§ 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii), 1401(27); then\n\n      (3) Determine whether the private placement provides special\n      education, i.e., “specially designed instruction . . . to meet the unique\n\n\n\n\n                                         -19-\n\f      needs 3 of a child with a disability”; if the placement provides no such\n      instruction, it is not reimbursable. Id. § 1401(29)(A).\n\n      (4) If the private placement provides additional services beyond\n      specially designed instruction to meet the child’s unique needs,\n      determine whether such additional services can be characterized as\n      “related services” under the Act, i.e., “transportation, and such\n      developmental, corrective, and other supportive services . . . as may\n      be required to assist a child with a disability to benefit from special\n      education,” excepting medical services which are not for diagnostic\n      and evaluation purposes. Id. § 1401(26). If the additional services\n      cannot be so characterized, they are not reimbursable.\n\n      Because this appeal can be resolved by a straightforward application of the\n\nstatutory text, it is unnecessary to adopt either the so-called “inextricably\n\nintertwined” 4 approach of the Third Circuit or the “primarily oriented” standard of\n\n      3\n        The concurrence suggests that the scope of the statutory term “special\neducation” should be limited to specially designed instruction to meet the unique\neducational needs of a child with a disability. Concurring Op. at 3–4. This\ninterpretation is plausible, although it leaves open the question of how broadly the\nterm “educational needs” can be construed. See, e.g., Kruelle, 642 F.2d at 693\n(“Where basic self-help and social skills . . . are lacking, formal education begins\nat that point.”(quotation omitted)); B.S., 82 F.3d at 1500 (“Everyone agrees that\nA.S. is exceptionally bright and thus was able to test appropriately on\nstandardized tests. This is not the sine qua non of ‘educational benefit,’\nhowever.”); see also H.R. Rep. 98-140, 1983 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2088, 2106\n(discussing possible amendment of Act’s definition of “special education” to refer\nto “unique educational needs” of disabled child but also noting “[i]t is the intent\nof the committee that the term ‘unique educational needs’ be broadly construed to\ninclude the handicapped child’s academic, social, health emotional,\ncommunicative, physical and vocational needs.”)). It is unnecessary to determine\nthe outer limits of this statutory term here, however, because the instruction at\nInnercept was designed to meet Elizabeth’s educational needs. See supra Part\nIII.A.3.\n      4\n       The term “inextricably intertwined test” itself appears to have been coined\nnot by any circuits which purportedly apply it, but rather by a circuit which\n                                                                       (continued...)\n\n                                         -20-\n\fthe Fifth and Seventh Circuits. 5 This permits us to avoid some of the interpretive\n\ndifficulties presented by the approaches of the other circuits. To begin, the case\n\nlaw is frequently imprecise as to what portion of the Act is being interpreted\n\nwhen a determination is made that a residential placement is reimbursable. For\n\nexample, the so-called “inextricably intertwined test” originally addressed only\n\nthe scope of the term “special education” under the Act, and was silent as to the\n\nscope of the term “related services.” Kruelle, 642 F.2d at 694 & n.23; see also\n\nMary T., 575 F.3d at 245–46 (applying Kruelle only to determine whether\n\ncontested services constitute “special education” under the Act). Subsequent to\n\nKruelle, however, both courts which purport to adopt and courts which purport to\n\nbreak from the Third Circuit approach frequently conflate the two statutory\n\nprovisions.

Thus,\n\ndetermining whether a child’s needs are “segregable” (as the Third Circuit defines\n\nthe term), while potentially helpful in some instances, is not central to a\n\nreviewing court’s task in every case. Assuredly, there are some cases in which\n\ncourts must decide just how broadly the Act’s definition of “special education”\n\nextends in order to effectuate the Act’s requirement that all children, no matter\n\nhow disabled, receive some meaningful educational benefit. See Kruelle, 642\n\nF.2d at 693; Thompson R2-J Sch. Dist. v. Luke P., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"171177\"><a href=\"/opinion/171177/thompson-r2-j-school-v-luke-p-ex-rel-jeff-p/\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1143</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1149 (10th Cir.\n\n2008); see also supra Part III.A.2 n.3. However, for others it may be clear or\n\nuncontested that a placement provides the type of “specially designed instruction”\n\ncontemplated by the Act, and the dispute will instead center on whether additional\n\nsupportive services provided at the placement are “required to assist” the child to\n\nobtain a meaningful educational benefit, i.e., whether such services are “related\n\nservices” under the Act.\n\n      A straightforward application of the Act’s text also dispenses with the need\n\nto fully dissect the amorphous, judicially crafted “primarily oriented” standard of\n\nthe Fifth and Seventh Circuits. Put simply, it is not at all clear that determining\n\nwhether a placement is “primarily oriented toward enabling a child to obtain an\n\neducation” sheds any light on the question of whether a placement provides\n\nspecially designed instruction to meet a child’s unique needs or whether\n\n                                         -22-\n\fadditional services provided by a placement are required to assist the child to\n\nbenefit from such instruction. In particular, in the context of the statutory term\n\n“related services,” the “primarily oriented” requirement is both over-inclusive and\n\nunder-inclusive. It is not difficult to imagine a residential placement providing\n\nservices that are required for a child to receive a meaningful education but are not\n\nthemselves “primarily oriented” toward educational goals. Conversely, it is also\n\npossible to imagine services which can be construed as primarily oriented toward\n\neducation but which are not required for a particular child to obtain an\n\neducational benefit.\n\n      Unquestionably, the genesis of the “primarily oriented” test is a concern\n\nwith expanding school district liability beyond the requirements of the IDEA. See\n\nMichael Z., 580 F.3d at 299. While a valid concern, the Act’s reimbursement\n\nprovisions already vest courts and hearing officers with the discretion to reduce or\n\ndeny reimbursement at multiple stages. See 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii)\n\n(describing circumstances in which a court or hearing officer “may require the\n\nagency to reimburse the parents for the cost” of private school enrollment\n\n(emphasis added)); id. § 1412(a)(10)(C)(iii) (describing circumstances in which\n\nreimbursement “may be reduced or denied” (emphasis added)). As both the\n\nSupreme Court and this court have made clear, the cost of the private placement\n\nand its impact on the school district’s budget is always a relevant consideration\n\n\n\n\n                                         -23-\n\ffor a court or hearing officer when fashioning relief. Carter, 510 U.S. at 15; L.B.,\n\n379 F.3d at 979 n.18.\n\n             3.    Elizabeth’s Placement at Innercept\n\n      Applying the above principles to the present case, this court concludes\n\nElizabeth’s placement at Innercept is reimbursable under the Act. Because\n\napplication of the plain text of the statute does not require any additional fact-\n\nfinding and would not require the district court to address issues it has not already\n\nconsidered, remand is unnecessary. Application of the first two steps is\n\nstraightforward: the District did not provide a FAPE to Elizabeth and has not\n\nchallenged that conclusion on appeal. Supra Part III.A.1. Further, the record\n\nindicates Innercept is an accredited educational facility in the state of Idaho\n\nstaffed by state-accredited teachers. It thus meets the Act’s definition of a\n\n“secondary school” as determined under state law. 20 U.S.C. § 1401(27).\n\n      As to the third step, the unchallenged findings of the IHO, ALJ, and district\n\ncourt support the conclusion that Innercept provided specially designed\n\ninstruction to meet Elizabeth’s unique needs. The IHO, ALJ, and district court\n\neach found Elizabeth’s time at Innercept included several hours per day of\n\ntraditional classroom instruction and one to one-and-a-half hours of directed\n\nhomework. Further, the district court found Innercept provides for one-on-one\n\ninstruction outside the classroom for times when Elizabeth was unable to\n\nparticipate in the classroom. Finally, although not noted by the district court, the\n\n                                         -24-\n\frecord before the IHO also indicates Elizabeth was enrolled in courses such as\n\nEnglish, World History, Math Concepts, and Speech.\n\n      Having determined the placement at Innercept includes appropriate “special\n\neducation,” as defined in the Act, we proceed to determine whether the remainder\n\nof the services for which Parents sought reimbursement constitute “related\n\nservices.” Notably, the District has never challenged the reimbursability of any\n\nof the specific services provided at Innercept. 6 Instead, the District has argued\n\nthat, according to the final report from Aspen, at least some of Elizabeth’s\n\neducational needs could be addressed in a non-residential setting. This argument,\n\nhowever, ignores the report’s conclusion that Elizabeth “is likely to show\n\nimprovements in her school performance and behavior at a[] [residential treatment\n\ncenter] because of the clinical milieu that pervades the academic environment.” It\n\nalso ignores the testimony of Dr. Gandhi, Dr. Ullrich, and David Miller indicating\n\nthat Elizabeth’s educational needs could not be addressed without also addressing\n\n\n      6\n         The closest the District ever came to developing such an argument was its\nassertion before the district court that $7,350.00 of Innercept’s $9,800.00 per\nmonth cost was medical in nature. Parents argued in response that the only\n“medical” services provided at Innercept were those provided by a licensed\nphysician, and that they amounted to four percent of Innercept’s total monthly\ncost. The district court concluded there was insufficient information in the record\nfor it to determine precisely how much reimbursement Parents were entitled to for\n“special education” and “related services” under the Act and how much of\nInnercept’s cost was not reimbursable as a medical service. The court therefore\ndirected Parents to obtain more detailed invoices from Innercept which\ndistinguished between services provided by physicians and non-physicians,\nordering reimbursement only for the latter.\n\n                                         -25-\n\fher behavioral needs. Finally, the District has argued Elizabeth’s placement at\n\nInnercept is not reimbursable because Elizabeth would have required mental\n\nhealth services regardless of whether she was receiving educational services. As\n\nset forth supra Part III.A.2, this argument relies on a reading of the Act at odds\n\nwith its plain language. Because the placement at Innercept provided both\n\nspecially designed instruction to meet Elizabeth’s unique needs and services\n\nrequired for her to benefit from that instruction, the district court properly\n\nconcluded it was reimbursable.\n\n      B.     Reduction or Denial of Reimbursement\n\n             1.     Statutory Framework and Standard of Review\n\n      When a disabled child is enrolled in a private school by her parents, 20\n\nU.S.C. § 1412(a)(10)(C)(iii) provides:\n\n      The cost of reimbursement . . . may be reduced or denied—\n\n      (I) if—\n\n             (aa) at the most recent IEP meeting that the parents\n             attended prior to removal of the child from the public\n             school, the parents did not inform the IEP Team that\n             they were rejecting the placement proposed by the\n             public agency to provide a free appropriate public\n             education to their child, including stating their concerns\n             and their intent to enroll their child in a private school at\n             public expense; or\n\n             (bb) 10 business days (including any holidays that occur\n             on a business day) prior to the removal of the child from\n             the public school, the parents did not give written notice\n\n\n                                         -26-\n\f             to the public agency of the information described in item\n             (aa);\n\n      (II) if, prior to the parents’ removal of the child from the public\n      school, the public agency informed the parents, through the notice\n      requirements described in section 1415(b)(3) of this title, of its intent\n      to evaluate the child (including a statement of the purpose of the\n      evaluation that was appropriate and reasonable), but the parents did\n      not make the child available for such evaluation; or\n\n      (III) upon a judicial finding of unreasonableness with respect to\n      actions taken by the parents.\n\nThus, even if a private placement is otherwise reimbursable under the IDEA, in\n\nsome circumstances the conduct of a child’s parents in obtaining the placement\n\nmay preclude or reduce reimbursement.\n\n      Here, the District argues, reimbursement should have been denied because\n\nParents did not comply with the ten-day notice requirement of\n\n§ 1412(a)(10)(C)(iii)(I)(bb) and because Parents did not make Elizabeth available\n\nfor an evaluation per § 1412(a)(10)(C)(iii)(II). In briefing this issue, neither the\n\nDistrict nor Parents address the standard of review. While, as a general matter,\n\nthis court applies a “modified de novo” standard of review in IDEA cases, see\n\nsupra Part III.A.1, because § 1412(a)(10)(C)(iii) describes circumstances in\n\nwhich a court may reduce or deny reimbursement, some courts have held a district\n\ncourt’s judgment under this portion of the Act is reviewed only for abuse of\n\ndiscretion. See Ashland Sch. Dist. v. E.H., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1345654\"><a href=\"/opinion/1345654/ashland-school-dist-v-parents-of-student-eh/\"><span class=\"volume\">587</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1175</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1184 (9th Cir. 2009);\n\nMichael Z., 580 F.3d at 301. Here, the district court concluded Parents neither\n\n\n                                         -27-\n\fprovided insufficient notice to the District nor failed to timely make Elizabeth\n\navailable for evaluation and that even if presented with a closer question of\n\nsufficiency of notice or failure to make Elizabeth available for evaluation, it\n\nwould not have reduced or denied reimbursement. Nonetheless, the standard of\n\nreview issue need not be resolved here because even under a modified de novo\n\nstandard of review the district court properly refused to reduce or deny\n\nreimbursement under 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(10)(C)(iii).\n\n             2.    Ten-day Notice Requirement\n\n      To begin, Parents complied with the ten-day notice provision of\n\n§ 1412(a)(10)(C)(iii)(I) by notifying the District via a letter dated November 10,\n\n2008, of their intent to enroll Elizabeth at Innercept in ten business days. The\n\nDistrict, however, argues § 1412(a)(10)(C)(iii)(I)(bb) required Parents to provide\n\nten days’ notice of their intent to place Elizabeth at the Aspen Institute, and that\n\ntheir failure to do so constitutes grounds to reduce or deny reimbursement for\n\nElizabeth’s placement at Innercept. As noted by the IHO, ALJ, and district court,\n\nthe reference in § 1412(a)(10)(C)(iii)(I)(bb) to “the removal of the child from the\n\npublic school” cannot be read to cover every instance in which a child is\n\ntemporarily absent from school. In context, the limitations on reimbursement in\n\n§ 1412(a)(10)(C)(iii) affect § 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii), which addresses reimbursement\n\nfor the cost of enrollment in private school. Thus, the term “removal” in\n\n\n\n\n                                         -28-\n\f§ 1412(a)(10)(C)(iii)(I)(bb) must refer to disenrollment from the public school\n\nsystem with the intent to place the child in a private school.\n\n      A close reading of the ten-day notice provision confirms this interpretation\n\nof the statute. Section 1412(a)(10)(C)(iii)(I)(bb) of the IDEA states\n\nreimbursement may be reduced or denied if “10 business days . . . prior to the\n\nremoval of the child from the public school, the parents [fail to] give written\n\nnotice to the public agency of the information described in item (aa).” The\n\ninformation described in item (aa) includes the parents’ objection to the\n\nplacement proposed by the school district and their intent to enroll their child in\n\nprivate school at public expense. Here, even by the time Elizabeth was placed for\n\nevaluation and treatment at Aspen, Parents were not rejecting any placement\n\nproposed by the District because the IEP for the coming school year had not yet\n\nbeen completed and the District had not yet proposed a placement for that year.\n\nFurther, Parents could not have informed the District of their intent to enroll\n\nElizabeth in private school at public expense ten days prior to her placement at\n\nAspen because there is no evidence in the record indicating they had such\n\nintentions at that time. 7 Thus, the District’s reading of the statute would put\n\nParents in an impossible position, requiring them to come forward with non-\n\n\n\n\n      7\n       Parents have never sought reimbursement under the IDEA for Elizabeth’s\nhospitalization at Aspen.\n\n                                         -29-\n\fexistent information simply to remain eligible for reimbursement under the Act in\n\nthe event the District failed to provide a FAPE.\n\n      Finally, the District’s reading of the statute is inconsistent with its purpose:\n\naffording school districts the opportunity to address parental objections to a\n\nproposed IEP prior to the removal of a disabled child from public school.

Failure to Make Elizabeth Available for Evaluation\n\n      The District also argues reimbursement should have been reduced or denied\n\nunder § 1412(a)(10)(C)(iii)(II) because Parents failed to make Elizabeth available\n\nfor an IEP evaluation after receiving notice of the District’s intent to conduct one.\n\nThe District cites cases indicating parents who unilaterally remove a child from a\n\npublic school system and place the child out of state before the public school is\n\n                                         -30-\n\fable to conduct an evaluation may lose their eligibility for reimbursement under\n\n§ 1412(a)(10)(C)(iii)(II).

Here, however, it was the District who unilaterally withdrew\n\nElizabeth from Humanex upon learning of her hospitalization at Aspen. As of\n\nOctober 7, 2008, the District made clear its position it had no ongoing\n\nresponsibility to Elizabeth under the IDEA. As late as December 2008, well after\n\nthe ten-day notice period for Elizabeth’s placement at Innercept had elapsed,\n\nElizabeth’s mother offered “to start anew and all work together to complete\n\nElizabeth’s IEP.” The District declined, reiterating its position that, because\n\nElizabeth was in Idaho, it did not “presently have an obligation to evaluate,\n\nconvene IEP team meetings for, or otherwise serve Elizabeth under the IDEA.”\n\nBased on these facts, the IHO, ALJ, and district court concluded the District\n\nextinguished any obligation Parents had to make Elizabeth available for\n\nevaluation under § 1412(a)(10)(C)(iii)(II).\n\n      Urging a contrary conclusion, the District identifies three communications\n\nin which it stated it stood “ready, willing, and able” to serve Elizabeth under the\n\nIDEA should she return to Colorado. These communications, however, do not\n\nsatisfy the District’s obligations under the statute. Section 1412(a)(10)(C)(iii)(II)\n\nrequires that a public agency which gives notice of its intent to evaluate a child\n\nmust do so “through the notice requirements described in [20 U.S.C.]\n\n§1415(b)(3).” Section 1415(b)(3) requires educational agencies to provide\n\n                                         -31-\n\f“[w]ritten prior notice to the parents of the child . . . whenever the local\n\neducational agency . . . proposes to initiate or change; or . . . refuses to initiate or\n\nchange, the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of the child, or\n\nthe provision of a free appropriate public education to the child.” Such “written\n\nprior notice” must be “in accordance with [20 U.S.C. § 1415(c)(1)]”, id., which\n\nprovides:\n\n      The notice required by subsection (b)(3) shall include —\n\n             (A) a description of the action proposed or refused by\n             the agency;\n\n             (B) an explanation of why the agency proposes or\n             refuses to take the action and a description of each\n             evaluation procedure, assessment, record, or report the\n             agency used as a basis for the proposed or refused\n             action;\n\n             (C) a statement that the parents of a child with a\n             disability have protection under the procedural\n             safeguards of this subchapter and, if this notice is not an\n             initial referral for evaluation, the means by which a copy\n             of a description of the procedural safeguards can be\n             obtained;\n\n             (D) sources for parents to contact to obtain assistance in\n             understanding the provisions of this subchapter;\n\n             (E) a description of other options considered by the IEP Team\n             and the reason why those options were rejected; and\n\n             (F) a description of the factors that are relevant to the agency's\n             proposal or refusal.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -32-\n\fSee also 34 C.F.R. § 300.503. None of the communications identified by the\n\nDistrict meet these requirements, and the District makes no attempt to show that\n\nthey do. Because the District did not properly “inform[] the parents . . . of its\n\nintent to evaluate the child,” 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(10)(C)(iii)(II), the district court\n\nproperly refused to reduce or deny reimbursement to Parents based on their\n\nalleged failure to make Elizabeth available for such an evaluation. 8\n\nIV.   Conclusion\n\n      For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n      8\n        Aside from its failure to comply with the notice requirements of 20 U.S.C.\n§ 1415(b)(3), the District’s characterization of its statements that it stood “ready\nwilling and able” to provide a FAPE to Elizabeth as a request to conduct an\nevaluation is dubious. Read in context with the District’s repeated statements that\nit had no obligation to Elizabeth under the IDEA because she was not physically\npresent in Colorado, at most the communications identified by the District could\nbe read for the proposition that the District’s offer to evaluate Elizabeth was\nconditioned on her permanent return to Colorado. The IDEA makes no allowance\nfor such a condition.\n\n                                         -33-\n\f11-1334, Jefferson County School District R-1 v. Elizabeth E.\n\nGORSUCH, J., Circuit Judge, concurring in the judgment.\n\n      The court’s judgment is undoubtedly right and easily arrived at. To be\n\nsure, the Third, Fifth, and Seventh Circuits have adopted somewhat different (if\n\nalso somewhat overlapping) tests for determining when public schools must pay\n\nprivate school tuition for disabled students.

But as the district court rightly recognized, there’s no\n\nneed to invite ourselves into their dispute. No need because all of the available\n\ntests point to the same conclusion in this particular case: Elizabeth is entitled to a\n\nprivate placement.\n\n      As the district court explained, the defendant school district failed to\n\nprovide Elizabeth with a free and appropriate public education, her private\n\nplacement was essential to ensure she received a meaningful educational benefit,\n\nand the private placement was primarily oriented toward enabling her to obtain an\n\neducation. All this, the district court concluded, made Elizabeth’s private\n\nplacement appropriate under any plausible test — even under the test favored by\n\nthe school district and adopted by the Fifth Circuit. See Richardson, 580 F.3d at\n\n299. Neither did the school district in this case present any serious challenge to\n\nthe specific amounts Elizabeth incurred in connection with her private placement\n\n(for her education or related services); instead, as the district court observed, the\n\fschool district effectively chose to confine its attack to the propriety of her\n\nplacement in the first place.\n\n      My colleagues and I agree with the district court’s holdings on all these\n\ncounts and no doubt this forms the narrowest and controlling ground for affirming\n\nthe case before us. For their part, my colleagues venture beyond this terra firma\n\nto offer a new (four step) test of their own for assessing private placements —\n\none that shares much in common with but also differs from the copious competing\n\ntests already circulating among circuit courts. I do not for a moment question the\n\nvalue of my colleagues’ enterprise: stirring the pot may help courts find just the\n\nright recipe in the end. In particular, my colleagues do well to remind us that\n\ndeciding whether a private school placement is appropriate (step 3) is an\n\nanalytically separate and distinct task from the job of ascertaining whether each\n\nrelated service provided by that school (step 4) is subject to reimbursement by a\n\npublic school district. Op. at 20-21. But it is equally clear that a new test isn’t\n\nnecessary to the disposition of this case: Elizabeth wins under any test. See\n\nNLRB v. Int’l Bhd. of Elec. Workers, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111881\"><a href=\"/opinion/111881/nlrb-v-electrical-workers/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">573</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 591 n.15 (1987) (statements\n\n“unnecessary to the disposition ” are “dict[a]” ); United States v.

In venturing their own test, my colleagues\n\ndo not expressly condition private placement on a showing that it is essential to\n\nprovide a meaningful educational benefit to the child. Instead, prong three of\n\n                                           -2-\n\ftheir test says merely that private placement is appropriate if it provides\n\n“specially designed instruction . . . to meet the [child’s] unique needs.” Op. at\n\n19. Reading that passage in isolation, one might forgive future litigants if they\n\nwonder whether my colleagues believe public school districts must pay for private\n\nschool placement even if the new school’s “instruction” is limited to addressing\n\nsocial or emotional problems or life challenges.\n\n      Such a reading, however, would be mistaken. Under IDEA, public school\n\nofficials must evaluate the disabled students they serve and offer them\n\nindividualized plans “reasonably calculated to enable [them] to receive\n\neducational benefits.” Bd. of Educ. v.

If the public school fails to provide\n\nsome meaningful educational benefit to the child, it must finance a private\n\nplacement to get the job done. 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii); see\n\nalso Winkelman ex rel.

However else they may disagree, all of our sister circuits agree a\n\nprivate placement under IDEA is permissible only if it is necessary to supply the\n\nchild with a meaningful educational benefit the public school has proven unable\n\nor unwilling to supply — not to address purely social, emotional, or medical\n\nneeds. See, e.g., Kruelle, 642 F.2d at 693 (IDEA requires courts to ask whether\n\nplacement “may be considered necessary for educational purposes” rather than to\n\n                                         -3-\n\faddress “medical, social, or emotional” issues); Mary T. v. Sch. Dist. of Phila.,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1213773\"><a href=\"/opinion/1213773/mary-t-v-school-dist-of-philadelphia/\"><span class=\"volume\">575</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">235</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 245-46 (3d Cir. 2009) (the required “link . . . between placement\n\nand the student’s learning needs” was absent where the instructional program\n\naddressed “medical, rather than educational, conditions”); Richardson, 580 F.3d\n\nat 298-300 (first component of its test is whether private placement is “essential\n\nin order for the disabled child to receive a meaningful educational benefit” rather\n\nthan to address “medical, social, or emotional problems”); Dale M., 237 F.3d at\n\n817 (same). This conclusion unsurprisingly aligns with Congress’s stated purpose\n\nin enacting IDEA: its wish to ensure public schools address the “educational\n\nneeds” of “children with disabilities,” not to force public schools to displace all\n\nother social service agencies and become the providers of first resort of all\n\nmedical, emotional, and social care and instruction. 20 U.S.C. § 1400(c)(2)\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n      Certainly I do not read my colleagues as disagreeing with this (rare, in this\n\narena) point of agreement among our sister courts. There is nothing in my\n\ncolleagues’ opinion openly registering any disagreement; to the contrary, their\n\nopinion appears to sound regular notes of concurrence even if the terms of their\n\nproffered test aren’t entirely clear. See, e.g., Op. at 22 (noting that “related\n\nservices” under their fourth test must “assist the child to obtain a meaningful\n\neducational benefit” (emphasis added) (internal quotation mark omitted)); id. at\n\n25 (expert testimony that “Elizabeth’s educational needs could not be addressed\n\n                                          -4-\n\fwithout also addressing her behavioral needs” supports reimbursement (emphasis\n\nadded)). Neither does their logic suggest that IDEA mandates reimbursement for\n\nservices unnecessary to supply a meaningful educational benefit — services our\n\nexisting circuit precedent places wholly outside the “free appropriate public\n\neducation” the school district must supply. See, e.g., Thompson, 540 F.3d at\n\n1150.\n\n        With these observations, I am pleased to join the court’s judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\f</pre>",
