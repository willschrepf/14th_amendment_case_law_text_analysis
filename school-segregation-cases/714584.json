Hall v. St. Helena Parish School Board, 5 Cir. May 28, 1969, 417 F.2d 801. It is unfortunate that at this time we cannot say to the school board, \"You have met the standards implicit in the Constitution and explicit in our judicial mandates; go about your business of educating children.\" United States v. Choctaw County Board of Education, 5 Cir. 1969, 417 F.2d 838, 839.

The plan was to be submitted within thirty days. Hall v. St. Helena Parish School Board, E.D.La.1969, 303 F.Supp. 1231.

Hinds County School Board, 5 Cir. 1969, 417 F.2d 852 [Nos. 28,030, 28,042, November 7, 1969], and of Carter v.

Jackson Municipal Separate School District, 5 Cir. 1970, 419 F.2d 1211 [No. 26,285 January 21], this Court has judicially determined that the ordinary procedures for appellate review in school segregation cases have to be suitably adopted to assure that each system, whose case is before us, \"begin immediately to operate as unitary school systems\". Upon consideration of the parties' memoranda and so much of the record as is available or determined to be needed by the Court, the Court has proceeded to dispose of this case as an extraordinary matter.

It is educationally a folly and in general the results have been glaring failures. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PER CURIAM.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court has considered the motion of counsel for St. Helena Parish School Board, et al., for an expedited reconsideration of the order of this Court dated March 6, 1970. The movant has drawn the attention of the Court to certain facts relating to the educational system of St. Helena Parish which were not in the record or before the Court at the time the March 6, 1970, order was issued. The Court notes that the final examinations commence on March 23, 1970, and continue throughout the week; that seniors thereafter have three weeks to practice for graduation and as far as they are concerned the school will have concluded March 29, 1970; that the school year for the remaining students concludes about the end of April and reopens in July 1970 for the Fall term.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In view of these unusual facts the Court has concluded to reconsider its order requiring that complete desegregation be put into effect March 23, 1970. It is therefore ordered that the full implementation of HEW's plan as set forth in this Court's order of March 6, 1970, be postponed until the commencement of the Fall term in July 1970 in St. Helena Parish. The School Board should take appropriate action prior to the opening of schools in July 1970 to carry out the other provisions of this Court's order of March 6, 1970.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This order shall issue forthwith.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",

The movant has drawn the attention of the Court to certain facts relating to the educational system of St. Helena Parish which were not in the record or before the Court at the time the March 6, 1970, order was issued. The Court notes that the final examinations commence on March 23, 1970, and continue throughout the week; that seniors thereafter have three weeks to practice for graduation and as far as they are concerned the school will have concluded March 29, 1970; that the school year for the remaining students concludes about the end of April and reopens in July 1970 for the Fall term.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In view of these unusual facts the Court has concluded to reconsider its order requiring that complete desegregation be put into effect March 23, 1970. It is therefore ordered that the full implementation of HEW's plan as set forth in this Court's order of March 6, 1970, be postponed until the commencement of the Fall term in July 1970 in St. Helena Parish. The School Board should take appropriate action prior to the opening of schools in July 1970 to carry out the other provisions of this Court's order of March 6, 1970.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This order shall issue forthwith.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
