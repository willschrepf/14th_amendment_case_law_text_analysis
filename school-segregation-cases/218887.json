For the reasons set forth below, the Court concludes that the municipality can be\n\nheld liable for the unconstitutional revocation of Mr. Singletary’s parole. Therefore, plaintiff’s\n\nmotion for summary judgment will be granted, and the defendant’s cross motion will be denied.\n\nI.    BACKGROUND\n\n       A.      Factual Background\n\n       In 1990, plaintiff Charles Singletary was released on parole after serving more than seven\n\nyears of a nine to twenty-seven year sentence for armed robbery. Singletary Decl. ¶ 2. 1 He\n\nremained on parole successfully for five years, but in June of 1995, he was arrested as an alleged\n\nparticipant in the murder of Leroy Houtman. Id. ¶ 3–4; Pl.’s Interrog. Resp. at No. 7. The\n\ncharges were soon dropped at the preliminary hearing, and he was never indicted by a grand jury.\n\n\n\n1       The Court set out the factual background of this case in great detail in Singletary v.\nDistrict of Columbia, 685 F. Supp. 2d 81 (D.D.C. 2010).\n\fSingletary Decl. ¶ 4. Yet a year later, the District of Columbia Board of Parole (“the Board”)\n\nheld a hearing to consider whether to revoke his parole. Id. ¶ 6; Pl.’s Interrog. Resp. at Nos. 8.\n\nThe evidence presented at the parole revocation hearing was limited to (1) a narrative given by\n\nthe prosecutor and (2) testimony by a police detective. Singletary, 685 F. Supp. 2d at 84.\n\nNeither of these individuals had first-hand knowledge of the facts, and their testimony was based\n\non statements made by two individuals who themselves had no first-hand information, but rather,\n\nreported on conversations with the woman who was convicted of conspiracy in connection with\n\nthe murder. Id. The Board revoked Singletary’s parole and he was was re-incarcerated. Id.\n\n       Singletary remained in prison for ten more years, Singletary Decl. ¶ 8, as he challenged\n\nthe parole revocation in habeas proceedings first in Superior Court and then in federal court. Id.\n\n¶ 10. The D.C. Superior Court denied Singletary’s first petition for writ of habeas corpus in\n\n1997 and that denial was upheld by the D.C. Court of Appeals. Id. In 2000, Singletary again\n\nsought habeas relief in Superior Court but the court denied his claim and the D.C. Court of\n\nAppeals affirmed that decision. Id. ¶ 11. Singletary represented himself in both of these\n\nproceedings. Id. ¶ 12.\n\n       With the assistance of a federal public defender, Singletary petitioned for a writ of habeas\n\ncorpus in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Singletary Decl. ¶ 13. That\n\npetition was denied, Singletary v. D.C. Bd. of Parole, No. 00-1263, 2003 WL 25258497 (D.D.C.\n\nDec. 16, 2003), and Singletary appealed the decision. Singletary Decl. ¶ 14. On July 7, 2006,\n\nten years after the plaintiff’s parole had been revoked, the U. S. Court of Appeals for the District\n\nof Columbia finally granted relief. The Court held that the Board’s decision did not comport\n\nwith due process because the parole revocation was based on such a “shoddy” record that it\n\nviolated Singletary’s constitutional right to due process. Singletary v. Reilly, 452 F.3d 868, 869\n\n\n\n                                                 2\n\f(D.C. Cir. 2006). The court ordered that Singletary be provided with a new parole revocation\n\nhearing. Singletary, 452 F.3d at 873–75.\n\n       In reaching its decision, the Court of Appeals noted that in Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S.\n\n471 (1972), the Supreme Court ruled that a parolee is entitled to a hearing before a final decision\n\non revocation can be made, and it set out the minimum due process requirements for such a\n\nhearing:\n\n       (a) written notice of the claimed violations of parole; (b) disclosure to the parolee\n       of evidence against him; (c) opportunity to be heard in person and to present\n       witnesses and documentary evidence; (d) the right to confront and cross-examine\n       adverse witnesses (unless the hearing officer specifically finds good cause for not\n       allowing confrontation); (e) a “neutral and detached” hearing body such as a\n       traditional parole board, members of which need not be judicial officers or\n       lawyers; and (f) a written statement by the factfinders as to the evidence relied on\n       and reasons for revoking parole.\n\nId. at 489. According to the Court of Appeals:\n\n       Parole revocation violates due process if the decision is either totally lacking in\n       evidentiary support or … so irrational as to be fundamentally unfair . . .\n       [R]eliance on hearsay in parole revocations hearings is not per se impermissible.\n       However, the use of unsubstantiated or unreliable hearsay would certainly\n       eviscerate the safeguards guaranteed by Morrissey and Gagnon.\n\nSingletary, 452 F.3d at 872 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Thus, in a parole\n\nrevocation hearing, hearsay evidence must be “both sufficient in quantity and reliability to ensure\n\nfundamental due process rights.” Id., citing Crawford v. Jackson, 323 F.3d 123, 128 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2003). The court concluded that in Singletary’s case, while the quantity of the evidence was not\n\nan issue, “the hearsay presented at the hearing was not demonstrated to be reliable,” and “the\n\nBoard’s decision to revoke Singletary’s parole was therefore ‘totally lacking in evidentiary\n\nsupport.’” Id., quoting Crawford, 323 F.2d at 129. The Court made it clear that it was not\n\noverturning the Board’s decision because it had been based on hearsay; rather, it held that “the\n\ngovernment has not established that the hearsay deemed adequate by the Board was sufficient in\n\n                                                 3\n\freliability to ensure fundamental due process rights.” Id. at 874 (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted). 2\n\n        Singletary’s new parole revocation hearing was held on October 30, 2006 before the\n\nUnited States Parole Commission. Singletary Decl. ¶ 16. The Parole Commission determined\n\nthat there was insufficient evidence to permit a finding of a parole violation and reinstated\n\nSingletary to supervised release, which he has successfully completed. Id. ¶ 19.\n\n        B.     Procedural History\n\n        Plaintiff filed this lawsuit on April 23, 2009, seeking money damages from the District of\n\nColumbia under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for the Board’s unlawful revocation of his parole. Compl. at 9\n\n\n2       This critical distinction seemed to elude the District in its briefing and argument on the\ncross motions for summary judgment. The District contended that the Board “violated its own\nrules” – rules that simply restate the Morrissey minimum due process requirements verbatim –\nwhen it revoked Singletary’s parole, and it suggested that it was the Board’s failure to permit the\nplaintiff to confront and cross examine the witnesses that led to grant of federal habeas relief.\nThis Court explicitly rejected that argument when it ruled on the District’s motion to dismiss,\nSingletary, 685 F. Supp. 2d at 93, but the District persisted in this misreading of the D.C. Circuit\nopinion when it sought summary judgment. Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment\n(“Def.’s Mem.”) at 11 (“The constraints enumerated in these regulations mirror the precise\nfactors that the Supreme Court identified as relevant in assessing the constitutionality of the\nrevocation of an individual’s parole[] and are also the precise factors that the D.C. Circuit found\nthe Board to have violated in revoking the plaintiff’s parole.”) (citations omitted). Moreover, the\nDistrict tried to claim during oral argument that section 1983 liability should not be available\nbecause the plaintiff had not even established the necessary predicate of a constitutional\nviolation:\n\n        [T]he District has taken the position that the question of whether or not Mr.\n        Singletary’s constitutional rights were impinged was not resolved by the D.C.\n        Circuit . . . [L]ooking through the [Singletary decision from the D.C. Circuit]\n        itself, there is language from the holding section in the reported opinion that talks\n        about plaintiff’s due process right being impinged. But that, your Honor, is not\n        the sum and substance of the opinion. That’s a summary prepared by the\n        reporting service.\n\nTranscript of Motions Hearing (“Tr.”), June 20, 2011, at 3–4. If the violation of Singletary’s\nright to due process was not the “sum and substance” of the D.C. Circuit opinion, the Court\ncannot imagine what was. Neither of the District’s arguments can be squared with even a\ncursory reading of the D.C. Circuit’s opinion in Singletary v. Reilly, 452 F. 3d at 868.\n                                                 4\n\f(demand for relief). The District filed a motion to dismiss [Dkt # 6], which the Court denied on\n\nFebruary 18, 2010, because “the District has not shown on the present record and based on the\n\narguments presented in its Motion to Dismiss and supporting briefing that Singletary cannot\n\nsucceed on his claim.” Singletary, 685 F. Supp. 2d at 93. Now pending before the Court are the\n\nparties’ cross motions for summary judgment [Dkt #30 and #32]. The Court heard oral argument\n\non these motions on June 20, 2011.\n\nII.    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n       Summary judgment is appropriate “if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute\n\nas to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n56(a). 3 The party seeking summary judgment bears the “initial responsibility of informing the\n\ndistrict court of the basis for its motion, and identifying those portions of the pleadings,\n\ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if\n\nany, which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.” Celotex\n\nCorp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986) (internal quotation marks omitted). To defeat\n\nsummary judgment, the non-moving party must “designate specific facts showing there is a\n\ngenuine issue for trial.” Id. at 324 (internal quotation marks omitted). The existence of a factual\n\ndispute is insufficient to preclude summary judgment. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S.\n\n242, 248 (1986). A dispute is “genuine” only if a reasonable fact-finder could find for the non-\n\nmoving party; a fact is only “material” if it is capable of affecting the outcome of the litigation.\n\nId. See also Laningham v. U.S. Navy, 813 F.2d 1236, 1241 (D.C. Cir. 1987).\n\n       “The rule governing cross-motions for summary judgment . . . is that neither party waives\n\nthe right to a full trial on the merits by filing its own motion; each side concedes that no material\n\n\n3      The parties informed the Court at the motions hearing that there were no factual disputes\nand that this case could be decided as a matter of law. Tr. at 6–7, 26.\n                                                 5\n\ffacts are at issue only for the purposes of its own motion.” Sherwood v. Washington Post, 871\n\nF.2d 1144, 1148 n.4 (D.C. Cir. 1989), quoting McKenzie v. Sawyer, 684 F.2d 62, 68 n.3 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1982). In assessing each party’s motion, “[a]ll underlying facts and inferences are analyzed\n\nin the light most favorable to the non-moving party.” N.S. ex rel. Stein v. District of Columbia,\n\n709 F. Supp. 2d 57, 65 (D.D.C. 2010), citing Anderson, 477 U.S. at 247.\n\n III. ANALYSIS\n\n           A. A municipality is not immune from liability under §1983.\n\n       Section 1983 of the Civil Rights Act provides:\n\n       Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or\n       usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to\n       be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the\n       jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities\n       secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an\n       action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress, except that in\n       any action brought against a judicial officer for an act or omission taken in such\n       officer's judicial capacity, injunctive relief shall not be granted unless a\n       declaratory decree was violated or declaratory relief was unavailable. For the\n       purposes of this section, any Act of Congress applicable exclusively to the\n       District of Columbia shall be considered to be a statute of the District of\n       Columbia.\n\n       42 U.S.C. § 1983.\n\n        In Monell v. Dep’t of Soc. Serv. of the City of New York, 436 U.S. 658, 690 (1978), the\n\nSupreme Court held that local governments are not immune from liability under section 1983,\n\nbut it specified that “a municipality cannot be held liable solely because it employs a tortfeasor –\n\nor, in other words, a municipality cannot be liable under § 1983 on a respondeat superior\n\ntheory.” Id. “Instead, it is when execution of a government’s policy or custom, whether made\n\nby its lawmakers or by those whose edicts or acts may fairly be said to represent official policy,\n\ninflicts the injury that the government as an entity is responsible under § 1983.” Id. at 694. The\n\nSupreme Court subsequently explained: “while Congress never questioned its power to impose\n\n\n                                                 6\n\fcivil liability on municipalities for their own illegal acts, Congress did doubt its constitutional\n\npower to impose such liability in order to oblige municipalities to control the conduct of others.”\n\nPembaur v. City of Cincinnati, 475 U.S 469, 479 (1986) (emphasis in original). “The ‘official\n\npolicy’ requirement was intended to distinguish acts of the municipality from acts of employees\n\nof the municipality, and thereby make clear that municipal liability is limited to actions for which\n\nthe municipality is actually responsible.” Id.\n\n        In determining whether a plaintiff has established municipal liability under Monell, the\n\ncourt must first determine whether there has been a constitutional violation. See Baker v.\n\nDistrict of Columbia, 326 F.3d 1302, 1306 (D.C. Cir. 2003). In this case, despite the District’s\n\nprotests to the contrary, see note 1, supra, that decision has already been made by the D.C.\n\nCircuit. Singletary v. Reilly, 452 F.3d at 868. Thus, the sole question before this Court is\n\nwhether the decision made by the Board to revoke the plaintiff’s parole in the absence of due\n\nprocess was an act of the District itself to which liability can attach.\n\n       To answer that question after Monell, courts have considered it necessary to determine\n\nwhether it was the execution of a governmental policy that caused the constitutional injury.\n\nAccording to the D.C. Circuit:\n\n       [T]here are a number of ways in which a ‘policy’ can be set by a municipality to\n       cause it to be liable under § 1983: the explicit setting of a policy by the\n       government that violates the Constitution . . . ; the action of a policy maker within\n       the government . . . ; the adoption through a knowing failure to act by a policy\n       maker of actions by his subordinates that are so consistent that they have become\n       ‘custom’ . . . ; or the failure of the government to respond to a need (for example,\n       training of employees) in such a manner as to show ‘deliberate indifference’ to\n       the risk that not addressing the need will result in constitutional violations.\n\n       Baker, 326 F.3d at 1306 (citations omitted). Plaintiff is not seeking to establish here that\n\nthe Board customarily premised revocation on unreliable hearsay, or that it regularly\n\ndisregarded the requirements of due process when considering the fate of parolees; nor does he\n\n                                                  7\n\fsuggest that the District was deliberately indifferent to the risk that the Board might do so.\n\nRather, the cross motions for summary judgment address whether the instant situation falls\n\nwithin the second of the four scenarios outlined in Baker: whether plaintiff’s parole revocation\n\nwas “the action of a policy maker within the government,” that is, whether the Board is a body\n\n“whose acts or edicts may fairly be said to represent official policy . . . and whose decisions\n\ntherefore may give rise to municipal liability under § 1983.” Pembaur, 475 U.S. at 480\n\n(citations omitted).\n\n      In Pembaur, the Supreme Court stated: “We hold that municipal liability under § 1983\n\nattaches where – and only where – a deliberate choice to follow a course of action is made from\n\namong various alternatives by the official or officials responsible for establishing final policy\n\nwith respect to the subject matter in question.” 475 U.S. at 483. Thus, plaintiff has approached\n\nthis issue by arguing that the Board was “the body responsible for establishing final policy”\n\nwith respect to parole, and therefore, its decision on a parole matter could form the basis for\n\nmunicipal liability under Monell. The Court summarized the positions of the parties when it\n\nruled on the District’s motion to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12 (b)(6):\n\n      Singletary seeks to prove municipal liability in this case by demonstrating that the\n      decision to revoke his parole was made by the “final municipal decisionmaker and\n      [is] therefore properly attributable to the municipality.” Bd. of the Co.\n      Commissioners of Bryan Co. v. Brown, 520 U.S. 397, 407 (1997). This is a\n      distinct and independent means of proving municipal liability and does not\n      require Singletary to allege the existence of an explicit policy or practice by the\n      District. See Baker, 326 F.3d at 1306 . . . Significantly, the District does not\n      dispute that the Board was the final policymaker regarding parole revocation nor\n      does it challenge the sufficiency of Singletary’s allegation on that point.\n\n\n\n\n                                                8\n\fSingletary, 685 F. Supp. 2d at 90 (emphasis in original). See also id. at 93 (“[A]s noted\n\npreviously, the District has not challenged Singletary’s allegation that the Board was the\n\nDistrict’s final policymaker with respect to the issue of parole revocation.”). 4\n\n       At the summary judgment stage, though, the District appears to have reversed course\n\nonce again, see, e.g., Singletary, 685 F. Supp. 2d at 93, and it devotes the bulk of its briefing to\n\nits present contention that the Board was not the final policy maker for the District on issues of\n\nparole. Def.’s Mem. at 6–20. The Court finds the District’s arguments to be unpersuasive.\n\n           B. The Board was the final policymaker for the District on matters of parole\n              revocation.\n\n       The determination of whether an individual or a government body is a final policymaker\n\nwith respect to a particular topic is a matter of state law. City of St. Louis v. Praprotnik, 485\n\nU.S. 112, 124–25 (1988), citing Pembaur, 475 U.S. at 483. Plaintiff points to several\n\ncircumstances that support a finding that at the time of the decision in question, the Board had\n\nthe final word within city government on matters of parole policy under D.C. law. First, he\n\ncites D.C. Code § 24-201.2(a), redesignated as D.C. Code § 24-401.02(a), which provides:\n\n       The Parole Board shall:\n\n       (1) Determine if and when it in the best interest of society and the offender to\n           release him or her on parole or on conditional release in the case of committed\n           youth offenders;\n\n       (2) Determine the terms and conditions of parole of conditional release;\n\n       (3) Supervise parolees in the community; and\n\n\n\n\n4      In its opinion, the Court did not purport to rule on the ultimate viability of plaintiff’s\nclaim. The Court simply found “that the District has not shown on the present record and based\non the arguments presented in its Motion to Dismiss and supporting briefing that Singletary\ncannot succeed on his claim,” and it denied the District’s motion to dismiss. Singletary, 685 F.\nSupp. 2d at 93.\n                                                  9\n\f       (4) Determine if and when to terminate parole or conditional release or to modify\n           the terms or conditions of parole or conditional release.5\n\nUnder the terms of this provision, it was the Board that had broad and exclusive authority to\n\ngrant, condition, oversee, or revoke parole. The statute also granted the mayor authority to\n\npromulgate rules regarding parole, and the mayor, in turn, delegated that authority to the\n\nchairman of the Parole Board. D.C. Code § 24-201.03, redesignated as D.C. Code §24-401.03;\n\nMayor’s Order 89-10 (Jan. 6, 1989), 36 D.C. Reg. 1254 (Feb. 10, 1989). The Board’s rules and\n\nregulations have the force and effect of law. Cosgrove v. Thornburgh, 703 F. Supp 995, 1001–\n\n03 (D.D.C. 1988). Finally, plaintiff points out that there was no administrative or executive\n\nreview within the D.C. government for a decision by the Board to revoke parole. D.C. Sec.\n\nSupp. Answer to Singletary Interrog. at No. 4 (Ex. 2 to Plaintiff’s Cross Motion for Partial\n\nSummary Judgment on the Issue of Liability (“Pl.’s Mem”).\n\n       In response, the District argues that the Parole Board was not a final policymaker because\n\nthe mayor delegated his statutory rulemaking authority to the chairman of the Parole Board\n\nrather than to the Board as a whole. Def.’s Mem at 17. According to the District, this means\n\nthe Board was constrained by rules and regulations that were not of its making. Tr. at 18. But\n\nthe delegation of rulemaking authority to the chairman instead of to the entire Board is a mere\n\nformality that does not change the fact that policymaking authority was located within the\n\nBoard and not somewhere else in city government. As plaintiff characterizes it, “the power [to\n\npromulgate rules] was internal to the Board and not external.” Pl.’s Mem. at 11. In fact, when\n\nthe Court asked counsel for the District at oral argument which governmental entity\n\npromulgated the policies that were in place at the time of Singletary’s revocation hearing, he\n\n\n5      In 2007, the D.C. Parole Board was abolished and its responsibilities were assumed by\nthe United States Parole Commission. See D.C. Code § 24-131; see also Crawford, 323 F.3d at\n125–26.\n                                               10\n\fstated: “it’s an executive regulation, but it came through the parole board and went through\n\nreview and comment.” Tr. at 16–17. So the District has not shown that the Board was subject\n\nto rules devised for it by someone else.\n\n      The District relies on several cases to support its argument that municipal liability does\n\nnot attach when “officials are constrained by policies not of the official’s making even when the\n\nofficials have significant discretionary authority in the area that is the subject of the lawsuit.”\n\nDef.’s Mem. at 13. But those cases are distinguishable from the situation presented here.\n\nTriplett v. District of Columbia, 108 F.3d 1450 (D.C. Cir. 1997), involved two correctional\n\nofficers who caused serious injury when they used excessive force in handling a prisoner. The\n\ncourt ruled that they obviously did not possess final policymaking authority on the use of force\n\nin restraining D.C. prisoners, and therefore, there could be no municipal liability for their\n\nwrongful conduct consistent with the bar on vicarious liability in Monell. Id. at 1454. The\n\nDistrict’s Parole Board – the city’s ultimate decision maker on matters of parole – cannot be\n\ncompared to two employees at the bottom of the chain of command for the D.C. Department of\n\nCorrections.\n\n      None of the other cases cited by the District involve municipal “actors” similar to the\n\nParole Board either. See, e.g., Bolton v. City of Dallas, 541 F.3d 545, 550 (5th Cir. 2008)\n\n(finding that city manager was not a final policymaker with respect to an employment decision);\n\nRasche v. Village of Beecher, 336 F.3d 588, 600 (7th Cir. 2003) (determining that a code\n\nenforcement office, whose duties included identifying zoning violations and issuing tickets, was\n\nnot a final policymaker); Jett v. Dallas Ind. Sch. Dist., 7 F.3d 1241, 1249–50 (5th Cir. 1993)\n\n(finding that superintendent of school district was not a policymaker because he was following\n\npolicy decisions set by the district’s board of trustees). The District cites Banks v. District of\n\n\n\n                                               11\n\fColumbia, 377 F. Supp. 2d 85 (D.D.C. 2005) but that case does not support its position.        In\n\nBanks, the Court determined that the Director of the Department of Mental Health was a final\n\npolicymaker who could establish municipal liability because of her “vast responsibilities and\n\nexpansive authority” and because as a director of her department, she was “responsible for\n\npromulgating rules to run” that department. Id. at 91–92. Like the Director of Mental Health in\n\nBanks, the Parole Board held the authority to promulgate its own rules.\n\n       The District argues next that the Board lacked policymaking authority because whatever\n\nauthority it exercised had been delegated to it by the mayor. This argument is without merit\n\nbecause the Supreme Court’s decision in Pembaur specifically recognized that final policy\n\nmaking authority “may be granted directly by legislative enactment or may be delegated by an\n\nofficial who possesses such authority.” Pembaur, 475 U.S. at 483. The District’s point is that if\n\nthe mayor granted the authority, he could also revoke it at any time. But the possibility that the\n\nBoard’s authority could hypothetically be revoked does not mean that the Board did not possess\n\nit at the time in question. If the District’s argument were to prevail, no authority delegated to\n\nany individual or governmental body could ever be considered final, and that would be\n\ninconsistent with the Supreme Court’s statement in Pembaur.\n\n       The District also contends that the Board lacked final policymaking authority because its\n\npolicies could be legislatively overruled and its revocation decisions were subject to habeas\n\nreview. If the availability of judicial or legislative review meant that an entity was not a\n\npolicymaker for Monell purposes, then no one in the executive branch would ever be considered\n\na final decision maker under section 1983. This is clearly not the result contemplated by the\n\nSupreme Court. See Pembaur, 475 U.S. at 479. Indeed, the District seemed to recognize this\n\nwhen it wrote: “[F]inal policymaking authority over a particular subject area does not vest in an\n\n\n\n                                               12\n\fofficial whose decisions in the area are subject to meaningful administrative review.” Def.’s\n\nMem. at 18, citing Scala v. Winter Park, 116 F.3d 1396, 1401 (11th Cir. 1997) (emphasis\n\nadded). While the availability of administrative review within the executive branch would be a\n\nfactor that would weigh against a finding that the initial decisionmaker lacked policymaking\n\nauthority, that argument by its terms does not include the possibility of court review or a\n\nlegislative override.\n\n       The District points to cases that it claims stand for the proposition that an official whose\n\n decisions are reviewable by “any other body” is not a final policymaker. See Beattie v. Madison\n\n County School Dist., 254 F.3d 595, 602–03 (5th Cir. 2001); Worsham v. City of Pasadena, 881\n\n F.2d 1336, 1341 (5th Cir. 1989). But these cases are distinguishable. In Beattie, for example,\n\n the court’s discussion of final policy making authority was related to a supervisor who\n\n recommended to a School Board that another employee should be terminated. Beattie, 254 F.3d\n\n at 602–03. In the District, there was no other body that needed to approve the Board’s decisions\n\n about parole before they took effect. In fact, there is no administrative review available within\n\n the D.C. government for a decision made by the Parole Board, and even judicial review is quite\n\n limited because the court must defer to the administrative body. See Johnson v. Reilly, 734 F.\n\n Supp. 2d 26 (D.D.C. 2010). Thus, the Board is the final word on parole for the District of\n\n Columbia. D.C. Sec. Supp. Answer to Singletary Interrog. at No. 4 (Ex. 2 to Pl.’s Mem). In\n\n light of all of these factors, the Court finds that as a matter of state law, the Board was the\n\n District’s final policymaker with respect to the issue of parole revocation.\n\n           C. The District can be liable for a single Board decision.\n\n       The District takes the position that even if the Board was the ultimate policy maker with\n\n respect to parole for the municipality, it can only be held liable under section 1983 for an injury\n\n\n\n                                                 13\n\fcaused by an unconstitutional policy it promulgated, and not for one of its individual decisions.\n\nBut the Supreme Court has expressly rejected that distinction. Monell held that a governmental\n\nbody may be sued if it caused a constitutional violation through “a policy statement, ordinance,\n\nregulation, or decision . . .” 436 U.S. at 690 (emphasis added), and the Court subsequently\n\nstated: “it is plain that municipal liability may be imposed for a single decision by municipal\n\npolicy makers under appropriate circumstances.” Pembaur, 475 U.S. at 480.\n\n        In Pembaur, the Court determined that a County Prosecutor “was acting as the final\n\ndecisionmaker for the county” when he directed the County Sheriff to take the action deemed to\n\nbe unconstitutional – the forcible entry of a medical clinic in an effort to serve capiases on third\n\nparties. 475 U.S. at 485 (emphasis added). See also id., at 484 (“The Prosecutor made a\n\nconsidered decision based on his understanding of the law and commanded the officers to\n\nforcibly enter the clinic.”). Indeed, the entire thrust of the Pembaur decision was to explain that\n\neven isolated decisions could constitute “policy” for purposes of imposing section 1983 liability\n\non municipalities under Monell.\n\n       [A] government frequently chooses a course of action tailored to a particular\n       situation and not intended to control decisions in later situations. If the decision\n       to adopt that particular course of action is properly made by that government’s\n       authorized decisionmakers, it surely represents an act of official government\n       “policy” as that term is commonly understood. More importantly, where the\n       action is directed by those who establish government policy, the municipality is\n       equally responsible whether that action is taken only once or to be taken\n       repeatedly.\n\nId. at 481. Applying that principle, a decision by the Board, which was the District’s final\n\ndecisionmaker with respect to parole and parole policy, was an act of official government policy\n\nto which section 1983 applies. See Meyers v. City of Cincinnati, 14 F.3d 1115, 1118 (6th Cir.\n\n\n\n\n                                                14\n\f1994) (“If the decision to punish [the assistant fire chief] was made by the ‘government’s\n\nauthorized decisionmakers’ the City is responsible.”) 6\n\n       The District relies heavily upon Praprotnik, but that case does not change the result here.\n\nLike most of the cases cited by the District, the case involved whether liability could be imposed\n\nbased upon employment actions taken by the plaintiff’s supervisors. The Court found that the\n\nmunicipality could not be liable because it concluded, as a matter of state law, that the city\n\nofficials who made the challenged decisions were not the makers of municipal policy for matters\n\nof personnel administration. Praprotnik, 485 U.S. at 128. So the Praprotnik opinion did not\n\ndirectly address the issues presented in this case.\n\n       The key sentence in Praprotnik upon which the District relies – (“Aware that\n\ngovernmental bodies can act only through natural persons, the Court concluded that those\n\ngovernments should be held responsible when, and only when, their official policies cause their\n\nemployees to violate another person’s constitutional rights”) – does appear in the introductory\n\nsection of the opinion where the Court reviews the holding in Monell and recounts its rejection of\n\nrespondeat superior. 485 U.S. at 122. But then the Court goes on to state:\n\n       In the years since Monell was decided, the Court has considered several cases\n       involving isolated acts by government officials and employees. We have assumed\n       that an unconstitutional governmental policy could be inferred from a single\n       decision taken by the highest officials responsible for setting policy in that area of\n       the government’s business.\n\n\n\n6       In Meyers, the court found that the city could be liable under Monell when an official in\nthe Fire Department was demoted and forced to retire in violation of his First Amendment rights\neven though the City was “not accused of routinely disciplining employees for exercising First\nAmendment rights or of having an official promulgated policy to that effect.” Id. at 1117. The\ncourt stated: “The requirement that a municipality’s wrongful actions be a ‘policy’ is not meant\nto distinguish isolated incidents from general rules of conduct promulgated by city officials. It is\nmeant to distinguish those injuries for which ‘the government as an entity is responsible under\n§1983’ . . . from those injuries for which the government should not be held accountable.\n‘Monell is a case about responsibility.’” Id. (citations omitted)\n                                                 15\n\fId. at 123.\n\n        What Praprotik teaches is that the authority to make municipal policy that is the linchpin\n\nfor liability must be the authority to make final policy. Id. at 127.\n\n        When an official’s discretionary decisions are constrained by policies not of that\n        official’s making, those policies, rather than the subordinate’s departures from\n        them are the act of the municipality. Similarly, when a subordinates’ decision is\n        subject to review by the municipality’s authorized policy makers, they have\n        retained the authority to measure the officials’ conduct for conformance with their\n        policies.\n\nId. Thus, even under Praprotnik, since the parole revocation was “a single decision taken by the\n\nhighest officials responsible for setting policy in that area of the government’s business,” and\n\nsince the Board was not constrained by policies made by a higher body and its decisions were\n\nnot subject to review by other city officials, the decision can form the basis for liability under\n\nsection 1983.\n\n        Several weeks after the hearing on the cross motions in this case, the District focused in\n\nmore closely on the issue of interest to the Court, and on July 8, 2011, it supplemented its\n\npleadings with a notice of additional authorities that supposedly stand for the proposition that\n\nthere can be no municipal liability for local entities performing quasi-judicial functions or\n\ndiscretionary functions. [Dkt #38]. But the cases provided to the Court – notwithstanding the\n\nfact that the defendant labeled each page of them in large red capital letters (e.g., “NO\n\nMUNICIPAL LIABILITY FOR QUASI JUDICIAL FUNCTION”) 7 – do not deal with quasi-\n\njudicial functions, nor do they stand for the principles for which they were cited.\n\n\n\n\n7       The Court would greatly prefer if in the future, the Office of the Attorney General would\nrefrain from submitting authority to the Court with portions highlighted and/or pages labeled in\nthis manner. The better practice would be to address the relevant portions of the cases in a\npleading.\n                                                 16\n\f       The case, Dick v. Watonwan County, 738 F.2d 939 (8th Cir. 1984), must have caught the\n\nDistrict’s attention because it referred to the defendant as the “Board.” But the case did not\n\ninvolve a quasi-judicial board making a flawed decision – it involved the actions of a few\n\noverzealous social workers who were employed by an agency called the Tri-County Human\n\nServices Board. The case addressed the question of whether the employer – in this case, the\n\n“Board” – and the county involved could be held liable for the individual employees’\n\nquestionable exercise of judgment. The case set forth the principle that a policy that permits\n\nindividual municipal officers to exercise their own discretion is not necessarily an\n\nunconstitutional policy or one that can be deemed to be the “moving force” behind a\n\nconstitutional violation for purposes of Monell. Id. at 943. The other Eighth Circuit cases cited\n\nby the government applied this principle. 8 All of the cases supplied in the District’s Notice dealt\n\n\n\n\n8       In Zumwalt v. City of Wentzvile, No. 10-cv-00561, 2010 WL 2710496 (E.D. Mo. July 7,\n2010), the plaintiff claimed in a “frequently unintelligible” complaint, id. at *4, that he had been\nfired from his city job in retaliation for his exercise of his first amendment rights. He argued that\na policy according city employees the authority to use their own judgment in making\nemployment decisions was tantamount to an unconstitutional policy. Citing Dick, 738 F. 2d at\n942, the Court disagreed.\n\n        Bush v. St. Louis County, No. 10-cv-00544, 2010 WL 5071330 (E.D. Mo. Dec. 7, 2010)\ndid not analyze the liability of quasi-judicial bodies either. The complaint in that case concerned\nthe discharge of a public employee, who complained that the decision was made arbitrarily and\nwithout the necessary procedural safeguards. The court noted that the plaintiff had failed to\nallege that there was a custom or policy of unlawful employment practices, and it cited Zumwalt\nwithout more.\n\n        Finally, Moyle v. Anderson, 571 F.3d 814 (8th Cir. 2009), dealt with a correctional\nofficer’s decision to assign a dangerous prisoner to be confined in the jail’s general intake unit\nrather than in a separate cell. The Court relied on its decision in Dick to conclude that a policy\nthat called for segregating high risk inmates, but afforded the officer the discretion to seek\nadditional information before designating a prisoner, was not an unconstitutional policy. Id. at\n818.\n\n       The Fourth Circuit case cited by the District, Hassell v. City of Chesapeake, Virginia, 64\nF. Supp. 2d 573 (E.D. Va. 1999), aff’d 230 F.3d 1352 (4th Cir. 2000), involved a decision made\n                                                 17\n\fwith whether an individual municipal employee’s isolated decision could be imputed to the city,\n\nand they did not address the issues before the Court.\n\n       In response to the District’s Notice, the plaintiff brushed away the authorities as\n\ninapposite and pointed to several cases that “recognize the availability of municipal liability\n\nunder § 1983 with respect to quasi-judicial action.” [Dkt #39]. In Loreto Dev. Co., Inc., v.\n\nVillage of Chardon, Ohio, No. 97-3302, 1998 U.S. App. LEXIS 12183 (6th Cir.) (unpub. op.),\n\nthe court stated that the village “may be held liable for the acts of its Board of Zoning and\n\nBuilding Appeals due to the fact that the municipality conferred final policy making authority on\n\nthis Board and the fact that the decision of the zoning Board constitutes an action taken under\n\nstate law.” Id. at *7. In Schiazza v. Zoning Hearing Bd., 168 F. Supp. 2d 361, 372–73 (M.D.\n\nPenn. 2001), the court similarly concluded that since a zoning hearing board had final authority\n\nto determine municipal policy for the township, at least with respect to granting or denying\n\nvariances or special exceptions, it could be liable under section 1983. In Cox, et. al., v. City of\n\nDallas, No. 98-1763, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18968 (N.D. Tex. Sept. 22, 2004), the court took\n\nnote of the Schiazza opinion and observed that the Dallas Board of Adjustment did have final\n\nauthority to establish that part of municipal zoning policy concerning the grant or denial of\n\nvariances or special exceptions.      “Because the Board of Adjustment has final authority\n\nconcerning the enforcement of zoning decisions, its decisions constitute municipal policy and\n\n\n\n\nby a single supervisory employee to subject a subordinate to a drug test. The District describes\nthe holding as “no municipal liability for discretionary function.” But the Court made a factual\nfinding in that case that the employee who ordered the plaintiff to submit to the test was not a\nfinal policymaker for substance abuse policy for the city, and it was on those grounds that it\nruled that her decision – applying an existing policy to the facts before her – would not support\nmunicipal liability under Monell. Id. at 578.\n\n                                                18\n\fmake it a policymaker for the City for purposes of § 1983.” Id. at *23. 9 Neither party has\n\nprovided with court with authority involving an unconstitutional parole revocation.\n\n           D. The District would be liable for the Board’s decision even if the Court did not\n              apply the policymaker analysis.\n\n       The District has recast its position a number of times, but there is some merit to its\n\nconcern that a parole revocation decision does not fall neatly into the rubric set out in Pembaur\n\nand Praprotnik. Under that approach, the court determines first whether the individual or entity\n\nthat caused the constitutional deprivation was the final municipality’s final policymaker for a\n\nparticular subject matter area. If so, then any decision it made related to that area can be the\n\npredicate for municipal liability. That was the gist of plaintiff’s argument on summary judgment\n\nand the approach the Court appeared to be taking at the 12(b)(6) stage. Singletary, 685 F. Supp.\n\n2d at 93. And as set forth above, there is clear support in the precedents of both the Supreme\n\nCourt and this Circuit for a ruling in plaintiff’s favor based on that approach.\n\n\n\n9       The court in Cox also stated: “In suing a municipality, a plaintiff must first prove there\nwas an official action by showing ‘three elements: a policy maker; an official policy; and a\nviolation of constitutional rights whose moving force’ is the policy or custom.” 2004 U.S. Dist.\nLEXIS 18968 at *20, quoting Piotrowski v. Houston, 237 F.3d 576, 578 (5th Cir. 2001). This\nlanguage can be read to support the District’s argument that the fact that the unconstitutional\ndecision was made by a policymaker is not enough – it must be an unconstitutional policy that\ncaused the constitutional deprivation. See Def. Opp. to Pl.’s Mem. at 13. But the three step\nanalysis has not been adopted by this Circuit. And, even when applying the three part test, the\ncourt in Cox made it clear that a single decision by a policymaker could trigger liability. “An\nofficial policy is (1) a policy statement, ordinance, regulation or decision that is adopted and\npromulgated by the governing body or by an official who has policymaking authority; or (2) a\npersistent, widespread practice . . .” Cox, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18968 at * 27. (emphasis\nadded). In other words, it does not have to be both. The court described the characteristics of a\npolicy maker: “A policymaker takes the place of the governing body in a designated area of city\nadministration; he decides the goals for a particular city function, devises the means of achieving\nthose goals, and is not supervised in the area of his responsibility except as to the totality of his\nperformance.” Id., at *21–22. In this case, the Board took the place of the city government in a\ndesignated area of city administration, it established its own policies and procedures, and it\noperated free from oversight, so its decision can be imputed to the city.\n\n                                                 19\n\f       But this Court has wrestled with this opinion because the policy maker analysis seems\n\nbetter suited to a situation where a high ranking municipal employee, as in Pembaur, issues an\n\nisolated directive (“Round up the usual suspects!”) or makes a policy choice with broad general\n\napplication, rather than when a quasi-judicial body – one that is charged with making multiple,\n\nregular, individual decisions – goes about making one of them unlawfully. The policy analysis\n\nseems particularly unsuited to the case before the Court since the parole revocation policy\n\npromulgated by the Board – which was followed in this instance – did not itself violate the\n\nConstitution. As the District points out, there is broad language in some of the cases that have\n\nelaborated on Monell that suggests that the Court must find that it was the municipal policy – and\n\nnot an individual decision made pursuant to that policy – that was unconstitutional before\n\nliability can be imposed on a municipality. See, e.g., Praprotnik, 485 U.S. at 123 (“[T]he\n\nchallenged action must have been taken pursuant to a policy adopted by the official or officials\n\nresponsible under state law for making policy in that area of the city’s business.”); id. at 128\n\n(“[T]he city cannot be held liable under § 1983 unless respondent proved the existence of an\n\nunconstitutional municipal policy.”).\n\n       In response, plaintiff correctly states that Pembaur and Baker permit this Court to hold\n\nthat the Board was executing “policy” when it was making one of its “decisions.” This approach\n\nhas its drawbacks, though, as it seems to strip the word “policy” of its ordinary meaning.\n\n       But that does not mean that the plaintiff is not entitled to judgment in this case. In the\n\nCourt’s view, it can grant summary judgment for the plaintiff without wading into the muddy\n\nwaters of the policy maker analysis, because a more straightforward answer can be found if one\n\nreturns to the Supreme Court’s opinion in Monell. The cases distinguishing policy makers from\n\n\n\n\n                                                20\n\fothers grew out of that decision, but the distinction was not what the case was about. What the\n\nSupreme Court held was:\n\n       Our analysis of the legislative history of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 compels the\n       conclusion that Congress did intend municipalities and other local government\n       units to be included among those persons to whom § 1983 applies. Local\n       government bodies, therefore, can be sued directly under § 1983 for monetary,\n       declaratory, or injunctive relief where, as here, the action that is alleged to be\n       unconstitutional implements or executes a policy statement, ordinance, regulation\n       or decision officially adopted and promulgated by that body’s officers.\n\nMonell, 436 U.S. at 690 (emphasis added). Thus, the overarching principle established in Monell\n\nwas that there could be municipal liability for an official governmental action, whether it comes\n\nin the form of a policy, regulation, or “decision.”\n\n       “Monell reasoned that recovery from a municipality is limited to acts that are, properly\n\nspeaking, acts ‘of the municipality’ – that is, acts which the municipality has officially\n\nsanctioned or ordered.” Pembaur, 475 U.S. at 480. In the years after Monell, if the decision in\n\nquestion was made by the local governing body, such as when the City Council cancelled a\n\nconcert in violation of the First Amendment in Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc., 453 U.S. 247\n\n(1981), or the City Council fired the police chief without a hearing in Owen v. City of\n\nIndependence, 445 U.S. 622 (1980), no further analysis was required. As Justice Brennan wrote\n\nin his concurring opinion in the Praprotnik case, “[i]n these cases we neither required nor, as the\n\nplurality suggests, assumed that these decisions reflected generally applicable ‘policies’ as that\n\nterm is commonly understood, because it was perfectly obvious that the actions of the\n\nmunicipalities’ policymaking organs, whether isolated or not, were properly charged to the\n\nmunicipalities themselves.” 485 U.S. at 138–13 (1988) (Brennan, J., conc.)\n\n       Plaintiff approached this case from that angle when he argued: “There is . . . nothing\n\nexceptionable in holding a municipality liable for acts undertaken by final policymakers (even\n\n\n\n                                                 21\n\fthose holding authority by virtue of delegation) provided only that that area of the city’s business\n\nhas been delegated to them and that there is no practical right of administrative review of their\n\ndecisions.” Pl’s Opp. to Def’s Mem. [Dkt #31] at 16. What the Court understands the plaintiff\n\nto be saying is that when the Board made a decision concerning parole revocation, in essence, it\n\nwas the District. The Board was issuing the District’s final word on the subject within its\n\npurview, and therefore, liability can be imputed to the District. The Court agrees. See Hampton\n\nCo. Nat. Sur., LLC v. Tunica County, Miss., 543 F.3d 221, 227 (5th Cir. 2008) (reversing district\n\ncourt determination that county was not liable for sheriff’s actions because “the sheriff’s decision\n\n. . . is the kind of single decision by the relevant policymaker that can be the basis of liability);\n\nSeamons v. Snow, 206 F.3d 1021, 1029 (10th Cir. 2000) (stating that school district was subject\n\nto liability where it had delegated authority to football coach to make final decisions regarding\n\nteam membership).\n\n       What the Supreme Court did in Monell was review the legislative history of the Civil\n\nRights Act in detail and overturn the opinion in Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167 (1961), which\n\nheld that Congress intended municipalities to be absolutely immune from suit under section\n\n1983. The Court was quite clear that there were limits to what it was announcing at that time:\n\n“Since this case unquestionably involved official policy as the moving force of the constitutional\n\nviolation found by the District Court . . . we must reverse the judgment below. In doing so, we\n\nhave no occasion to address and do not address what the full contours of municipal liability\n\nunder § 1983 may be.” 436 U.S. at 694–95. So the court did not hold that unless municipal\n\npolicy was the moving force behind the violation, liability will not attach – it held that because in\n\nthat case municipal policy was the moving force behind the violation, liability did attach. It\n\n\n\n\n                                                 22\n\ffollows then that if in a later case, it is determined that an official “ordinance, regulation, or\n\ndecision” caused the injury, see id. at 690, that too could be grounds for liability.\n\n       The Monell opinion made it clear that it was not outlining the contours of municipal\n\nliability for all purposes. The Court declared that governmental bodies are not wholly immune,\n\nand it also established the important principle that liability could not be vicarious. “In particular,\n\nwe conclude that municipality cannot be held liable solely because it employees a tortfeasor.” Id.\n\nat 691 (emphasis in original). The Court explained that such a rule was needed to implement the\n\ncausation requirement in the statute, which imposes liability on any person who “subjects” a\n\nperson to a deprivation of rights or one who “causes” a person “to be subjected” to a deprivation\n\nof rights. See id. at 692, citing 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The Court stated that the language in the\n\nstatute that imposes liability on a person who “causes” an employee to violate another’s\n\nconstitutional rights “cannot be easily read to impose liability vicariously on government bodies\n\nsolely on the basis of the existence of an employer-employee relationship with a tortfeasor.” Id.\n\n       The purpose of the policymaker analysis, then, was to provide guidance for those cases,\n\nsuch as City of Oklahoma City v. Tuttle, 471 U.S. 808 (1985), or Praprotnik, 485 U.S. at 112,\n\nwhere it was necessary to differentiate the acts of a municipal employee from the acts of the\n\nmunicipality itself. “The ‘official policy’ requirement was intended to distinguish acts of the\n\nmunicipality from acts of employees of the municipality, and thereby make clear that municipal\n\nliability is limited to actions for which the municipality is actually responsible.” Pembaur, 475\n\nU.S. at 479.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 23\n\f        As Justice Brennan wrote in his concurrence in Praprotnik:\n\n        Our decision in Monell, interpreting the statute to require a showing that\n        [constitutional] deprivations arise from municipal policy, did not employ the\n        policy requirement as an end in itself, but rather as a means of determining which\n        acts by municipal employees are properly attributed to the municipality. Congress,\n        we held, did not intend to subject cities to liability simply because they employ\n        tortfeasors. But where a municipality’s governing legislative body inflicts the\n        constitutional injury, the municipal policy inquiry is essentially superfluous . . .\n\n485 U.S. at 139 n 3.\n\n        The Court concludes that at bottom, in this case, the municipal policy inquiry is\n\nsuperfluous. There is no danger that finding the city to be responsible for the decision of its\n\nparole board would be imposing the kind of vicarious liability based “solely” on the acts of\n\nindividual, rogue employees that was prohibited by Monell.             In this case, the injury “was\n\ninflicted by . . . those whose edicts or acts may fairly be said to represent official policy,”\n\nPraprotnik, 485 U.S. at 121–22 (internal quotation marks omitted), and the revocation of\n\nplaintiff’s parole was therefore an “act[] ‘of the municipality,’ – that is, [an act] which the\n\nmunicipality has officially sanctioned or ordered.” Pembaur, 475 U.S. at 481. So, even if the\n\ntwo step policy test is not perfectly apt in this case, plaintiff is entitled to judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw.\n\n            E. The Court is bound to construe §1983 broadly.\n\n        In the end, faced with a difficult question of first impression, this Court considered\n\nwhether the Supreme Court had provided any direction on how close questions should be\n\nresolved in the future. On that point, the Court was unequivocal:\n\n\n\n\n                                                  24\n\f          [T]here can be no doubt that § 1 of the Civil Rights Act was intended to provide a\n          remedy, to be broadly construed, against all forms of official violation of federally\n          protected rights.\n\nMonell, 436 U.S. at 700–01. The Monell opinion quotes verbatim from the legislative history on\n\nthis point:\n\n          [T]his act is remedial, and in aid of the preservation of human liberty and human\n          rights. All statutes and constitutional provisions authorizing such statutes are\n          liberally and beneficently construed. It would be most strange and, in civilized\n          law, monstrous, if this were not the rule of interpretation.\n\n          Id. at 684, quoting Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., App. 335–336.             The Court\n\nwent on:\n\n          In both Houses, statement of the supporters of § 1 corroborated that Congress, in\n          enacting § 1, intended to give a broad remedy for violations of federally protected\n          civil rights.\n\nId. at 685. The fact that that Supreme Court explicitly underscored the need to construe the act\n\nbroadly lends further support to this Court’s conclusion that Mr. Singletary should prevail in his\n\naction.\n\n          Therefore, based on a thorough consideration of the cross motions for summary\n\njudgment, the oppositions, and the entire record of this case, the Court will deny the District’s\n\nmotion for summary judgment and grant plaintiff’s partial motion for summary judgment. The\n\nonly remaining issue is a determination of damages. A separate order will issue.\n\n\n\n\n                                                AMY BERMAN JACKSON\n                                                United States District Judge\n\nDATE: August 1, 2011\n\n\n\n                                                   25\n\f",

For the reasons set forth below, the Court concludes that the municipality can be\n\nheld liable for the unconstitutional revocation of Mr. Singletary’s parole. Therefore, plaintiff’s\n\nmotion for summary judgment will be granted, and the defendant’s cross motion will be denied.\n\nI.    BACKGROUND\n\n       A.      Factual Background\n\n       In 1990, plaintiff Charles Singletary was released on parole after serving more than seven\n\nyears of a nine to twenty-seven year sentence for armed robbery. Singletary Decl. ¶ 2. 1 He\n\nremained on parole successfully for five years, but in June of 1995, he was arrested as an alleged\n\nparticipant in the murder of Leroy Houtman. Id. ¶ 3–4; Pl.’s Interrog. Resp. at No. 7. The\n\ncharges were soon dropped at the preliminary hearing, and he was never indicted by a grand jury.\n\n\n\n1       The Court set out the factual background of this case in great detail in Singletary v.\nDistrict of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2569391\"><a href=\"/opinion/2569391/singletary-v-district-of-columbia/\"><span class=\"volume\">685</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">81</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.D.C. 2010).\n\fSingletary Decl. ¶ 4. Yet a year later, the District of Columbia Board of Parole (“the Board”)\n\nheld a hearing to consider whether to revoke his parole. Id. ¶ 6; Pl.’s Interrog. Resp. at Nos. 8.\n\nThe evidence presented at the parole revocation hearing was limited to (1) a narrative given by\n\nthe prosecutor and (2) testimony by a police detective. Singletary, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">685</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 84.\n\nNeither of these individuals had first-hand knowledge of the facts, and their testimony was based\n\non statements made by two individuals who themselves had no first-hand information, but rather,\n\nreported on conversations with the woman who was convicted of conspiracy in connection with\n\nthe murder. Id. The Board revoked Singletary’s parole and he was was re-incarcerated. Id.\n\n       Singletary remained in prison for ten more years, Singletary Decl. ¶ 8, as he challenged\n\nthe parole revocation in habeas proceedings first in Superior Court and then in federal court. Id.\n\n¶ 10. The D.C. Superior Court denied Singletary’s first petition for writ of habeas corpus in\n\n1997 and that denial was upheld by the D.C. Court of Appeals. Id. In 2000, Singletary again\n\nsought habeas relief in Superior Court but the court denied his claim and the D.C. Court of\n\nAppeals affirmed that decision. Id. ¶ 11. Singletary represented himself in both of these\n\nproceedings. Id. ¶ 12.\n\n       With the assistance of a federal public defender, Singletary petitioned for a writ of habeas\n\ncorpus in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Singletary Decl. ¶ 13. That\n\npetition was denied, Singletary v. D.C. Bd. of Parole, No. 00-1263, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2003</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">25258497</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.D.C.\n\nDec. 16, 2003), and Singletary appealed the decision. Singletary Decl. ¶ 14. On July 7, 2006,\n\nten years after the plaintiff’s parole had been revoked, the U. S. Court of Appeals for the District\n\nof Columbia finally granted relief. The Court held that the Board’s decision did not comport\n\nwith due process because the parole revocation was based on such a “shoddy” record that it\n\nviolated Singletary’s constitutional right to due process. Singletary v. Reilly, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186741\"><a href=\"/opinion/186741/singletary-charles-v-dc-bd-par/\"><span class=\"volume\">452</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">868</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 869\n\n\n\n                                                 2\n\f(D.C. Cir. 2006). The court ordered that Singletary be provided with a new parole revocation\n\nhearing. Singletary, 452 F.3d at 873–75.\n\n       In reaching its decision, the Court of Appeals noted that in Morrissey v. Brewer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108606\"><a href=\"/opinion/108606/morrissey-v-brewer/\"><span class=\"volume\">408</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">471</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1972), the Supreme Court ruled that a parolee is entitled to a hearing before a final decision\n\non revocation can be made, and it set out the minimum due process requirements for such a\n\nhearing:\n\n       (a) written notice of the claimed violations of parole; (b) disclosure to the parolee\n       of evidence against him; (c) opportunity to be heard in person and to present\n       witnesses and documentary evidence; (d) the right to confront and cross-examine\n       adverse witnesses (unless the hearing officer specifically finds good cause for not\n       allowing confrontation); (e) a “neutral and detached” hearing body such as a\n       traditional parole board, members of which need not be judicial officers or\n       lawyers; and (f) a written statement by the factfinders as to the evidence relied on\n       and reasons for revoking parole.\n\nId. at 489. According to the Court of Appeals:\n\n       Parole revocation violates due process if the decision is either totally lacking in\n       evidentiary support or … so irrational as to be fundamentally unfair . . .\n       [R]eliance on hearsay in parole revocations hearings is not per se impermissible.\n       However, the use of unsubstantiated or unreliable hearsay would certainly\n       eviscerate the safeguards guaranteed by Morrissey and Gagnon.\n\nSingletary, 452 F.3d at 872 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Thus, in a parole\n\nrevocation hearing, hearsay evidence must be “both sufficient in quantity and reliability to ensure\n\nfundamental due process rights.” Id., citing Crawford v. Jackson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"781273\"><a href=\"/opinion/781273/curtis-e-crawford-v-patricia-a-jackson/\"><span class=\"volume\">323</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">123</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 128 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2003). The court concluded that in Singletary’s case, while the quantity of the evidence was not\n\nan issue, “the hearsay presented at the hearing was not demonstrated to be reliable,” and “the\n\nBoard’s decision to revoke Singletary’s parole was therefore ‘totally lacking in evidentiary\n\nsupport.’” Id., quoting Crawford, 323 F.2d at 129. The Court made it clear that it was not\n\noverturning the Board’s decision because it had been based on hearsay; rather, it held that “the\n\ngovernment has not established that the hearsay deemed adequate by the Board was sufficient in\n\n                                                 3\n\freliability to ensure fundamental due process rights.” Id. at 874 (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted). 2\n\n        Singletary’s new parole revocation hearing was held on October 30, 2006 before the\n\nUnited States Parole Commission. Singletary Decl. ¶ 16. The Parole Commission determined\n\nthat there was insufficient evidence to permit a finding of a parole violation and reinstated\n\nSingletary to supervised release, which he has successfully completed. Id. ¶ 19.\n\n        B.     Procedural History\n\n        Plaintiff filed this lawsuit on April 23, 2009, seeking money damages from the District of\n\nColumbia under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for the Board’s unlawful revocation of his parole. Compl. at 9\n\n\n2       This critical distinction seemed to elude the District in its briefing and argument on the\ncross motions for summary judgment. The District contended that the Board “violated its own\nrules” – rules that simply restate the Morrissey minimum due process requirements verbatim –\nwhen it revoked Singletary’s parole, and it suggested that it was the Board’s failure to permit the\nplaintiff to confront and cross examine the witnesses that led to grant of federal habeas relief.\nThis Court explicitly rejected that argument when it ruled on the District’s motion to dismiss,\nSingletary, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">685</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 93, but the District persisted in this misreading of the D.C. Circuit\nopinion when it sought summary judgment. Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment\n(“Def.’s Mem.”) at 11 (“The constraints enumerated in these regulations mirror the precise\nfactors that the Supreme Court identified as relevant in assessing the constitutionality of the\nrevocation of an individual’s parole[] and are also the precise factors that the D.C. Circuit found\nthe Board to have violated in revoking the plaintiff’s parole.”) (citations omitted). Moreover, the\nDistrict tried to claim during oral argument that section 1983 liability should not be available\nbecause the plaintiff had not even established the necessary predicate of a constitutional\nviolation:\n\n        [T]he District has taken the position that the question of whether or not Mr.\n        Singletary’s constitutional rights were impinged was not resolved by the D.C.\n        Circuit . . . [L]ooking through the [Singletary decision from the D.C. Circuit]\n        itself, there is language from the holding section in the reported opinion that talks\n        about plaintiff’s due process right being impinged. But that, your Honor, is not\n        the sum and substance of the opinion. That’s a summary prepared by the\n        reporting service.\n\nTranscript of Motions Hearing (“Tr.”), June 20, 2011, at 3–4. If the violation of Singletary’s\nright to due process was not the “sum and substance” of the D.C. Circuit opinion, the Court\ncannot imagine what was. Neither of the District’s arguments can be squared with even a\ncursory reading of the D.C. Circuit’s opinion in Singletary v. Reilly, 452 F. 3d at 868.\n                                                 4\n\f(demand for relief). The District filed a motion to dismiss [Dkt # 6], which the Court denied on\n\nFebruary 18, 2010, because “the District has not shown on the present record and based on the\n\narguments presented in its Motion to Dismiss and supporting briefing that Singletary cannot\n\nsucceed on his claim.” Singletary, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">685</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The Court heard oral argument\n\non these motions on June 20, 2011.\n\nII.    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n       Summary judgment is appropriate “if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute\n\nas to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n56(a). 3 The party seeking summary judgment bears the “initial responsibility of informing the\n\ndistrict court of the basis for its motion, and identifying those portions of the pleadings,\n\ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if\n\nany, which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.” Celotex\n\nCorp. v.

To defeat\n\nsummary judgment, the non-moving party must “designate specific facts showing there is a\n\ngenuine issue for trial.” Id. at 324 (internal quotation marks omitted).

A municipality is not immune from liability under §1983.\n\n       Section 1983 of the Civil Rights Act provides:\n\n       Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or\n       usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to\n       be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the\n       jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities\n       secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an\n       action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress, except that in\n       any action brought against a judicial officer for an act or omission taken in such\n       officer's judicial capacity, injunctive relief shall not be granted unless a\n       declaratory decree was violated or declaratory relief was unavailable. For the\n       purposes of this section, any Act of Congress applicable exclusively to the\n       District of Columbia shall be considered to be a statute of the District of\n       Columbia.\n\n       42 U.S.C. § 1983.\n\n        In Monell v.

The\n\nSupreme Court subsequently explained: “while Congress never questioned its power to impose\n\n\n                                                 6\n\fcivil liability on municipalities for their own illegal acts, Congress did doubt its constitutional\n\npower to impose such liability in order to oblige municipalities to control the conduct of others.”\n\nPembaur v. City of Cincinnati, 475 U.S 469, 479 (1986) (emphasis in original). “The ‘official\n\npolicy’ requirement was intended to distinguish acts of the municipality from acts of employees\n\nof the municipality, and thereby make clear that municipal liability is limited to actions for which\n\nthe municipality is actually responsible.” Id.\n\n        In determining whether a plaintiff has established municipal liability under Monell, the\n\ncourt must first determine whether there has been a constitutional violation. See Baker v.\n\nDistrict of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"185950\"><a href=\"/opinion/185950/baker-todd-v-dc/\"><span class=\"volume\">326</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1302</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1306 (D.C. Cir. 2003). In this case, despite the District’s\n\nprotests to the contrary, see note 1, supra, that decision has already been made by the D.C.\n\nCircuit. Singletary v. Reilly, 452 F.3d at 868. Thus, the sole question before this Court is\n\nwhether the decision made by the Board to revoke the plaintiff’s parole in the absence of due\n\nprocess was an act of the District itself to which liability can attach.\n\n       To answer that question after Monell, courts have considered it necessary to determine\n\nwhether it was the execution of a governmental policy that caused the constitutional injury.\n\nAccording to the D.C. Circuit:\n\n       [T]here are a number of ways in which a ‘policy’ can be set by a municipality to\n       cause it to be liable under § 1983: the explicit setting of a policy by the\n       government that violates the Constitution . . . ; the action of a policy maker within\n       the government . . . ; the adoption through a knowing failure to act by a policy\n       maker of actions by his subordinates that are so consistent that they have become\n       ‘custom’ . . . ; or the failure of the government to respond to a need (for example,\n       training of employees) in such a manner as to show ‘deliberate indifference’ to\n       the risk that not addressing the need will result in constitutional violations.\n\n       Baker, 326 F.3d at 1306 (citations omitted). Plaintiff is not seeking to establish here that\n\nthe Board customarily premised revocation on unreliable hearsay, or that it regularly\n\ndisregarded the requirements of due process when considering the fate of parolees; nor does he\n\n                                                  7\n\fsuggest that the District was deliberately indifferent to the risk that the Board might do so.\n\nRather, the cross motions for summary judgment address whether the instant situation falls\n\nwithin the second of the four scenarios outlined in Baker: whether plaintiff’s parole revocation\n\nwas “the action of a policy maker within the government,” that is, whether the Board is a body\n\n“whose acts or edicts may fairly be said to represent official policy . . . and whose decisions\n\ntherefore may give rise to municipal liability under § 1983.” Pembaur, 475 U.S. at 480\n\n(citations omitted).\n\n      In Pembaur, the Supreme Court stated: “We hold that municipal liability under § 1983\n\nattaches where – and only where – a deliberate choice to follow a course of action is made from\n\namong various alternatives by the official or officials responsible for establishing final policy\n\nwith respect to the subject matter in question.” 475 U.S. at 483. Thus, plaintiff has approached\n\nthis issue by arguing that the Board was “the body responsible for establishing final policy”\n\nwith respect to parole, and therefore, its decision on a parole matter could form the basis for\n\nmunicipal liability under Monell. The Court summarized the positions of the parties when it\n\nruled on the District’s motion to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12 (b)(6):\n\n      Singletary seeks to prove municipal liability in this case by demonstrating that the\n      decision to revoke his parole was made by the “final municipal decisionmaker and\n      [is] therefore properly attributable to the municipality.” Bd. of the Co.\n      Commissioners of Bryan Co. v.

This is a\n      distinct and independent means of proving municipal liability and does not\n      require Singletary to allege the existence of an explicit policy or practice by the\n      District. See Baker, 326 F.3d at 1306 . . . Significantly, the District does not\n      dispute that the Board was the final policymaker regarding parole revocation nor\n      does it challenge the sufficiency of Singletary’s allegation on that point.\n\n\n\n\n                                                8\n\fSingletary, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">685</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The Board was the final policymaker for the District on matters of parole\n              revocation.\n\n       The determination of whether an individual or a government body is a final policymaker\n\nwith respect to a particular topic is a matter of state law. City of St. Louis v. Praprotnik, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112017\"><a href=\"/opinion/112017/st-louis-v-praprotnik/\"><span class=\"volume\">485</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">112</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 124–25 (1988), citing Pembaur, 475 U.S. at 483. Plaintiff points to several\n\ncircumstances that support a finding that at the time of the decision in question, the Board had\n\nthe final word within city government on matters of parole policy under D.C. law. First, he\n\ncites D.C. Code § 24-201.2(a), redesignated as D.C. Code § 24-401.02(a), which provides:\n\n       The Parole Board shall:\n\n       (1) Determine if and when it in the best interest of society and the offender to\n           release him or her on parole or on conditional release in the case of committed\n           youth offenders;\n\n       (2) Determine the terms and conditions of parole of conditional release;\n\n       (3) Supervise parolees in the community; and\n\n\n\n\n4      In its opinion, the Court did not purport to rule on the ultimate viability of plaintiff’s\nclaim. The Court simply found “that the District has not shown on the present record and based\non the arguments presented in its Motion to Dismiss and supporting briefing that Singletary\ncannot succeed on his claim,” and it denied the District’s motion to dismiss. Singletary, 685 F.\nSupp. 2d at 93.\n                                                  9\n\f       (4) Determine if and when to terminate parole or conditional release or to modify\n           the terms or conditions of parole or conditional release.5\n\nUnder the terms of this provision, it was the Board that had broad and exclusive authority to\n\ngrant, condition, oversee, or revoke parole. The statute also granted the mayor authority to\n\npromulgate rules regarding parole, and the mayor, in turn, delegated that authority to the\n\nchairman of the Parole Board. D.C. Code § 24-201.03, redesignated as D.C. Code §24-401.03;\n\nMayor’s Order 89-10 (Jan. 6, 1989), 36 D.C. Reg. 1254 (Feb. 10, 1989). The Board’s rules and\n\nregulations have the force and effect of law. Cosgrove v. Thornburgh, 703 F. Supp 995, 1001–\n\n03 (D.D.C. 1988). Finally, plaintiff points out that there was no administrative or executive\n\nreview within the D.C. government for a decision by the Board to revoke parole. D.C. Sec.\n\nSupp. Answer to Singletary Interrog. at No. 4 (Ex. 2 to Plaintiff’s Cross Motion for Partial\n\nSummary Judgment on the Issue of Liability (“Pl.’s Mem”).\n\n       In response, the District argues that the Parole Board was not a final policymaker because\n\nthe mayor delegated his statutory rulemaking authority to the chairman of the Parole Board\n\nrather than to the Board as a whole. Def.’s Mem at 17. According to the District, this means\n\nthe Board was constrained by rules and regulations that were not of its making. Tr. at 18. But\n\nthe delegation of rulemaking authority to the chairman instead of to the entire Board is a mere\n\nformality that does not change the fact that policymaking authority was located within the\n\nBoard and not somewhere else in city government. As plaintiff characterizes it, “the power [to\n\npromulgate rules] was internal to the Board and not external.” Pl.’s Mem. at 11. In fact, when\n\nthe Court asked counsel for the District at oral argument which governmental entity\n\npromulgated the policies that were in place at the time of Singletary’s revocation hearing, he\n\n\n5      In 2007, the D.C. Parole Board was abolished and its responsibilities were assumed by\nthe United States Parole Commission. See D.C. Code § 24-131; see also Crawford, 323 F.3d at\n125–26.\n                                               10\n\fstated: “it’s an executive regulation, but it came through the parole board and went through\n\nreview and comment.” Tr. at 16–17. So the District has not shown that the Board was subject\n\nto rules devised for it by someone else.\n\n      The District relies on several cases to support its argument that municipal liability does\n\nnot attach when “officials are constrained by policies not of the official’s making even when the\n\nofficials have significant discretionary authority in the area that is the subject of the lawsuit.”\n\nDef.’s Mem. at 13. But those cases are distinguishable from the situation presented here.\n\nTriplett v. District of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"738212\"><a href=\"/opinion/738212/robert-h-triplett-v-district-of-columbia/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1450</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.C. Cir. 1997), involved two correctional\n\nofficers who caused serious injury when they used excessive force in handling a prisoner. The\n\ncourt ruled that they obviously did not possess final policymaking authority on the use of force\n\nin restraining D.C. prisoners, and therefore, there could be no municipal liability for their\n\nwrongful conduct consistent with the bar on vicarious liability in Monell. Id. at 1454. The\n\nDistrict’s Parole Board – the city’s ultimate decision maker on matters of parole – cannot be\n\ncompared to two employees at the bottom of the chain of command for the D.C. Department of\n\nCorrections.\n\n      None of the other cases cited by the District involve municipal “actors” similar to the\n\nParole Board either. See, e.g., Bolton v.

The District cites Banks v. District of\n\n\n\n                                               11\n\fColumbia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2384248\"><a href=\"/opinion/2384248/banks-v-district-of-columbia/\"><span class=\"volume\">377</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">85</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.D.C. 2005) but that case does not support its position.        In\n\nBanks, the Court determined that the Director of the Department of Mental Health was a final\n\npolicymaker who could establish municipal liability because of her “vast responsibilities and\n\nexpansive authority” and because as a director of her department, she was “responsible for\n\npromulgating rules to run” that department. Id. at 91–92. Like the Director of Mental Health in\n\nBanks, the Parole Board held the authority to promulgate its own rules.\n\n       The District argues next that the Board lacked policymaking authority because whatever\n\nauthority it exercised had been delegated to it by the mayor. This argument is without merit\n\nbecause the Supreme Court’s decision in Pembaur specifically recognized that final policy\n\nmaking authority “may be granted directly by legislative enactment or may be delegated by an\n\nofficial who possesses such authority.” Pembaur, 475 U.S. at 483. The District’s point is that if\n\nthe mayor granted the authority, he could also revoke it at any time. But the possibility that the\n\nBoard’s authority could hypothetically be revoked does not mean that the Board did not possess\n\nit at the time in question. If the District’s argument were to prevail, no authority delegated to\n\nany individual or governmental body could ever be considered final, and that would be\n\ninconsistent with the Supreme Court’s statement in Pembaur.\n\n       The District also contends that the Board lacked final policymaking authority because its\n\npolicies could be legislatively overruled and its revocation decisions were subject to habeas\n\nreview. If the availability of judicial or legislative review meant that an entity was not a\n\npolicymaker for Monell purposes, then no one in the executive branch would ever be considered\n\na final decision maker under section 1983. This is clearly not the result contemplated by the\n\nSupreme Court. See Pembaur, 475 U.S. at 479. Indeed, the District seemed to recognize this\n\nwhen it wrote: “[F]inal policymaking authority over a particular subject area does not vest in an\n\n\n\n                                               12\n\fofficial whose decisions in the area are subject to meaningful administrative review.” Def.’s\n\nMem. at 18, citing Scala v. Winter Park, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"71935\"><a href=\"/opinion/71935/scala-v-city-of-winter-park/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1396</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1401 (11th Cir. 1997) (emphasis\n\nadded). While the availability of administrative review within the executive branch would be a\n\nfactor that would weigh against a finding that the initial decisionmaker lacked policymaking\n\nauthority, that argument by its terms does not include the possibility of court review or a\n\nlegislative override.\n\n       The District points to cases that it claims stand for the proposition that an official whose\n\n decisions are reviewable by “any other body” is not a final policymaker. See Beattie v. Madison\n\n County School Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"24446\"><a href=\"/opinion/24446/beattie-v-madison-cty-sch-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">254</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">595</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 602–03 (5th Cir. 2001); Worsham v.

But these cases are distinguishable. In Beattie, for example,\n\n the court’s discussion of final policy making authority was related to a supervisor who\n\n recommended to a School Board that another employee should be terminated. Beattie, 254 F.3d\n\n at 602–03. In the District, there was no other body that needed to approve the Board’s decisions\n\n about parole before they took effect. In fact, there is no administrative review available within\n\n the D.C. government for a decision made by the Parole Board, and even judicial review is quite\n\n limited because the court must defer to the administrative body. See Johnson v. Reilly, 734 F.\n\n Supp. 2d 26 (D.D.C. 2010). Thus, the Board is the final word on parole for the District of\n\n Columbia. D.C. Sec. Supp. Answer to Singletary Interrog. at No. 4 (Ex. 2 to Pl.’s Mem). In\n\n light of all of these factors, the Court finds that as a matter of state law, the Board was the\n\n District’s final policymaker with respect to the issue of parole revocation.\n\n           C. The District can be liable for a single Board decision.\n\n       The District takes the position that even if the Board was the ultimate policy maker with\n\n respect to parole for the municipality, it can only be held liable under section 1983 for an injury\n\n\n\n                                                 13\n\fcaused by an unconstitutional policy it promulgated, and not for one of its individual decisions.\n\nBut the Supreme Court has expressly rejected that distinction. Monell held that a governmental\n\nbody may be sued if it caused a constitutional violation through “a policy statement, ordinance,\n\nregulation, or decision . . .” 436 U.S. at 690 (emphasis added), and the Court subsequently\n\nstated: “it is plain that municipal liability may be imposed for a single decision by municipal\n\npolicy makers under appropriate circumstances.” Pembaur, 475 U.S. at 480.\n\n        In Pembaur, the Court determined that a County Prosecutor “was acting as the final\n\ndecisionmaker for the county” when he directed the County Sheriff to take the action deemed to\n\nbe unconstitutional – the forcible entry of a medical clinic in an effort to serve capiases on third\n\nparties. 475 U.S. at 485 (emphasis added). See also id., at 484 (“The Prosecutor made a\n\nconsidered decision based on his understanding of the law and commanded the officers to\n\nforcibly enter the clinic.”). Indeed, the entire thrust of the Pembaur decision was to explain that\n\neven isolated decisions could constitute “policy” for purposes of imposing section 1983 liability\n\non municipalities under Monell.\n\n       [A] government frequently chooses a course of action tailored to a particular\n       situation and not intended to control decisions in later situations. If the decision\n       to adopt that particular course of action is properly made by that government’s\n       authorized decisionmakers, it surely represents an act of official government\n       “policy” as that term is commonly understood. More importantly, where the\n       action is directed by those who establish government policy, the municipality is\n       equally responsible whether that action is taken only once or to be taken\n       repeatedly.\n\nId. at 481. Applying that principle, a decision by the Board, which was the District’s final\n\ndecisionmaker with respect to parole and parole policy, was an act of official government policy\n\nto which section 1983 applies. See Meyers v. City of Cincinnati, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"661492\"><a href=\"/opinion/661492/john-meyers-v-city-of-cincinnati/\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1115</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1118 (6th Cir.\n\n\n\n\n                                                14\n\f1994) (“If the decision to punish [the assistant fire chief] was made by the ‘government’s\n\nauthorized decisionmakers’ the City is responsible.”) 6\n\n       The District relies heavily upon Praprotnik, but that case does not change the result here.\n\nLike most of the cases cited by the District, the case involved whether liability could be imposed\n\nbased upon employment actions taken by the plaintiff’s supervisors. The Court found that the\n\nmunicipality could not be liable because it concluded, as a matter of state law, that the city\n\nofficials who made the challenged decisions were not the makers of municipal policy for matters\n\nof personnel administration. Praprotnik, 485 U.S. at 128. So the Praprotnik opinion did not\n\ndirectly address the issues presented in this case.\n\n       The key sentence in Praprotnik upon which the District relies – (“Aware that\n\ngovernmental bodies can act only through natural persons, the Court concluded that those\n\ngovernments should be held responsible when, and only when, their official policies cause their\n\nemployees to violate another person’s constitutional rights”) – does appear in the introductory\n\nsection of the opinion where the Court reviews the holding in Monell and recounts its rejection of\n\nrespondeat superior. 485 U.S. at 122. But then the Court goes on to state:\n\n       In the years since Monell was decided, the Court has considered several cases\n       involving isolated acts by government officials and employees. We have assumed\n       that an unconstitutional governmental policy could be inferred from a single\n       decision taken by the highest officials responsible for setting policy in that area of\n       the government’s business.\n\n\n\n6       In Meyers, the court found that the city could be liable under Monell when an official in\nthe Fire Department was demoted and forced to retire in violation of his First Amendment rights\neven though the City was “not accused of routinely disciplining employees for exercising First\nAmendment rights or of having an official promulgated policy to that effect.” Id. at 1117. The\ncourt stated: “The requirement that a municipality’s wrongful actions be a ‘policy’ is not meant\nto distinguish isolated incidents from general rules of conduct promulgated by city officials. It is\nmeant to distinguish those injuries for which ‘the government as an entity is responsible under\n§1983’ . . . from those injuries for which the government should not be held accountable.\n‘Monell is a case about responsibility.’” Id. (citations omitted)\n                                                 15\n\fId. at 123.\n\n        What Praprotik teaches is that the authority to make municipal policy that is the linchpin\n\nfor liability must be the authority to make final policy. Id. at 127.\n\n        When an official’s discretionary decisions are constrained by policies not of that\n        official’s making, those policies, rather than the subordinate’s departures from\n        them are the act of the municipality. Similarly, when a subordinates’ decision is\n        subject to review by the municipality’s authorized policy makers, they have\n        retained the authority to measure the officials’ conduct for conformance with their\n        policies.\n\nId. Thus, even under Praprotnik, since the parole revocation was “a single decision taken by the\n\nhighest officials responsible for setting policy in that area of the government’s business,” and\n\nsince the Board was not constrained by policies made by a higher body and its decisions were\n\nnot subject to review by other city officials, the decision can form the basis for liability under\n\nsection 1983.\n\n        Several weeks after the hearing on the cross motions in this case, the District focused in\n\nmore closely on the issue of interest to the Court, and on July 8, 2011, it supplemented its\n\npleadings with a notice of additional authorities that supposedly stand for the proposition that\n\nthere can be no municipal liability for local entities performing quasi-judicial functions or\n\ndiscretionary functions. [Dkt #38]. But the cases provided to the Court – notwithstanding the\n\nfact that the defendant labeled each page of them in large red capital letters (e.g., “NO\n\nMUNICIPAL LIABILITY FOR QUASI JUDICIAL FUNCTION”) 7 – do not deal with quasi-\n\njudicial functions, nor do they stand for the principles for which they were cited.\n\n\n\n\n7       The Court would greatly prefer if in the future, the Office of the Attorney General would\nrefrain from submitting authority to the Court with portions highlighted and/or pages labeled in\nthis manner. The better practice would be to address the relevant portions of the cases in a\npleading.\n                                                 16\n\f       The case, Dick v. Watonwan County, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"438737\"><a href=\"/opinion/438737/alexander-dick-and-irene-dick-v-watonwan-county-and-tri-county-human/\"><span class=\"volume\">738</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">939</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (8th Cir. 1984), must have caught the\n\nDistrict’s attention because it referred to the defendant as the “Board.” But the case did not\n\ninvolve a quasi-judicial board making a flawed decision – it involved the actions of a few\n\noverzealous social workers who were employed by an agency called the Tri-County Human\n\nServices Board. The case addressed the question of whether the employer – in this case, the\n\n“Board” – and the county involved could be held liable for the individual employees’\n\nquestionable exercise of judgment. The case set forth the principle that a policy that permits\n\nindividual municipal officers to exercise their own discretion is not necessarily an\n\nunconstitutional policy or one that can be deemed to be the “moving force” behind a\n\nconstitutional violation for purposes of Monell. Id. at 943. The other Eighth Circuit cases cited\n\nby the government applied this principle. 8 All of the cases supplied in the District’s Notice dealt\n\n\n\n\n8       In Zumwalt v.

The Court relied on its decision in Dick to conclude that a policy\nthat called for segregating high risk inmates, but afforded the officer the discretion to seek\nadditional information before designating a prisoner, was not an unconstitutional policy.

In Loreto Dev. Co., Inc., v.\n\nVillage of Chardon, Ohio, No. 97-3302, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S. App. LEXIS</span> <span class=\"page\">12183</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (6th Cir.) (unpub. op.),\n\nthe court stated that the village “may be held liable for the acts of its Board of Zoning and\n\nBuilding Appeals due to the fact that the municipality conferred final policy making authority on\n\nthis Board and the fact that the decision of the zoning Board constitutes an action taken under\n\nstate law.” Id. at *7. In Schiazza v.

Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">361</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 372–73 (M.D.\n\nPenn. 2001), the court similarly concluded that since a zoning hearing board had final authority\n\nto determine municipal policy for the township, at least with respect to granting or denying\n\nvariances or special exceptions, it could be liable under section 1983. In Cox, et. al., v. City of\n\nDallas, No. 98-1763, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2004</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S. Dist. LEXIS</span> <span class=\"page\">18968</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (N.D. Tex. Sept. 22, 2004), the court took\n\nnote of the Schiazza opinion and observed that the Dallas Board of Adjustment did have final\n\nauthority to establish that part of municipal zoning policy concerning the grant or denial of\n\nvariances or special exceptions.      “Because the Board of Adjustment has final authority\n\nconcerning the enforcement of zoning decisions, its decisions constitute municipal policy and\n\n\n\n\nby a single supervisory employee to subject a subordinate to a drug test. The District describes\nthe holding as “no municipal liability for discretionary function.” But the Court made a factual\nfinding in that case that the employee who ordered the plaintiff to submit to the test was not a\nfinal policymaker for substance abuse policy for the city, and it was on those grounds that it\nruled that her decision – applying an existing policy to the facts before her – would not support\nmunicipal liability under Monell. Id. at 578.\n\n                                                18\n\fmake it a policymaker for the City for purposes of § 1983.” Id. at *23. 9 Neither party has\n\nprovided with court with authority involving an unconstitutional parole revocation.\n\n           D. The District would be liable for the Board’s decision even if the Court did not\n              apply the policymaker analysis.\n\n       The District has recast its position a number of times, but there is some merit to its\n\nconcern that a parole revocation decision does not fall neatly into the rubric set out in Pembaur\n\nand Praprotnik. Under that approach, the court determines first whether the individual or entity\n\nthat caused the constitutional deprivation was the final municipality’s final policymaker for a\n\nparticular subject matter area. If so, then any decision it made related to that area can be the\n\npredicate for municipal liability. That was the gist of plaintiff’s argument on summary judgment\n\nand the approach the Court appeared to be taking at the 12(b)(6) stage. Singletary, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">685</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 93. And as set forth above, there is clear support in the precedents of both the Supreme\n\nCourt and this Circuit for a ruling in plaintiff’s favor based on that approach.\n\n\n\n9       The court in Cox also stated: “In suing a municipality, a plaintiff must first prove there\nwas an official action by showing ‘three elements: a policy maker; an official policy; and a\nviolation of constitutional rights whose moving force’ is the policy or custom.” 2004 U.S. Dist.\nLEXIS 18968 at *20, quoting Piotrowski v. Houston, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">237</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">576</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 578 (5th Cir. 2001). This\nlanguage can be read to support the District’s argument that the fact that the unconstitutional\ndecision was made by a policymaker is not enough – it must be an unconstitutional policy that\ncaused the constitutional deprivation. See Def. Opp. to Pl.’s Mem. at 13. But the three step\nanalysis has not been adopted by this Circuit. And, even when applying the three part test, the\ncourt in Cox made it clear that a single decision by a policymaker could trigger liability. “An\nofficial policy is (1) a policy statement, ordinance, regulation or decision that is adopted and\npromulgated by the governing body or by an official who has policymaking authority; or (2) a\npersistent, widespread practice . . .” Cox, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2004</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S. Dist. LEXIS</span> <span class=\"page\">18968</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at * 27. (emphasis\nadded). In other words, it does not have to be both. The court described the characteristics of a\npolicy maker: “A policymaker takes the place of the governing body in a designated area of city\nadministration; he decides the goals for a particular city function, devises the means of achieving\nthose goals, and is not supervised in the area of his responsibility except as to the totality of his\nperformance.” Id., at *21–22. In this case, the Board took the place of the city government in a\ndesignated area of city administration, it established its own policies and procedures, and it\noperated free from oversight, so its decision can be imputed to the city.\n\n                                                 19\n\f       But this Court has wrestled with this opinion because the policy maker analysis seems\n\nbetter suited to a situation where a high ranking municipal employee, as in Pembaur, issues an\n\nisolated directive (“Round up the usual suspects!”) or makes a policy choice with broad general\n\napplication, rather than when a quasi-judicial body – one that is charged with making multiple,\n\nregular, individual decisions – goes about making one of them unlawfully. The policy analysis\n\nseems particularly unsuited to the case before the Court since the parole revocation policy\n\npromulgated by the Board – which was followed in this instance – did not itself violate the\n\nConstitution. As the District points out, there is broad language in some of the cases that have\n\nelaborated on Monell that suggests that the Court must find that it was the municipal policy – and\n\nnot an individual decision made pursuant to that policy – that was unconstitutional before\n\nliability can be imposed on a municipality. See, e.g., Praprotnik, 485 U.S. at 123 (“[T]he\n\nchallenged action must have been taken pursuant to a policy adopted by the official or officials\n\nresponsible under state law for making policy in that area of the city’s business.”); id. at 128\n\n(“[T]he city cannot be held liable under § 1983 unless respondent proved the existence of an\n\nunconstitutional municipal policy.”).\n\n       In response, plaintiff correctly states that Pembaur and Baker permit this Court to hold\n\nthat the Board was executing “policy” when it was making one of its “decisions.” This approach\n\nhas its drawbacks, though, as it seems to strip the word “policy” of its ordinary meaning.\n\n       But that does not mean that the plaintiff is not entitled to judgment in this case. In the\n\nCourt’s view, it can grant summary judgment for the plaintiff without wading into the muddy\n\nwaters of the policy maker analysis, because a more straightforward answer can be found if one\n\nreturns to the Supreme Court’s opinion in Monell. The cases distinguishing policy makers from\n\n\n\n\n                                                20\n\fothers grew out of that decision, but the distinction was not what the case was about. What the\n\nSupreme Court held was:\n\n       Our analysis of the legislative history of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 compels the\n       conclusion that Congress did intend municipalities and other local government\n       units to be included among those persons to whom § 1983 applies. Local\n       government bodies, therefore, can be sued directly under § 1983 for monetary,\n       declaratory, or injunctive relief where, as here, the action that is alleged to be\n       unconstitutional implements or executes a policy statement, ordinance, regulation\n       or decision officially adopted and promulgated by that body’s officers.\n\nMonell, 436 U.S. at 690 (emphasis added). Thus, the overarching principle established in Monell\n\nwas that there could be municipal liability for an official governmental action, whether it comes\n\nin the form of a policy, regulation, or “decision.”\n\n       “Monell reasoned that recovery from a municipality is limited to acts that are, properly\n\nspeaking, acts ‘of the municipality’ – that is, acts which the municipality has officially\n\nsanctioned or ordered.” Pembaur, 475 U.S. at 480. In the years after Monell, if the decision in\n\nquestion was made by the local governing body, such as when the City Council cancelled a\n\nconcert in violation of the First Amendment in Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110553\"><a href=\"/opinion/110553/newport-v-fact-concerts-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">453</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">247</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(1981), or the City Council fired the police chief without a hearing in Owen v.

As Justice Brennan wrote\n\nin his concurring opinion in the Praprotnik case, “[i]n these cases we neither required nor, as the\n\nplurality suggests, assumed that these decisions reflected generally applicable ‘policies’ as that\n\nterm is commonly understood, because it was perfectly obvious that the actions of the\n\nmunicipalities’ policymaking organs, whether isolated or not, were properly charged to the\n\nmunicipalities themselves.” 485 U.S. at 138–13 (1988) (Brennan, J., conc.)\n\n       Plaintiff approached this case from that angle when he argued: “There is . . . nothing\n\nexceptionable in holding a municipality liable for acts undertaken by final policymakers (even\n\n\n\n                                                 21\n\fthose holding authority by virtue of delegation) provided only that that area of the city’s business\n\nhas been delegated to them and that there is no practical right of administrative review of their\n\ndecisions.” Pl’s Opp. to Def’s Mem. [Dkt #31] at 16. What the Court understands the plaintiff\n\nto be saying is that when the Board made a decision concerning parole revocation, in essence, it\n\nwas the District. The Board was issuing the District’s final word on the subject within its\n\npurview, and therefore, liability can be imputed to the District. The Court agrees. See Hampton\n\nCo. Nat. Sur., LLC v. Tunica County, Miss., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"63581\"><a href=\"/opinion/63581/hampton-co-nat-sur-llc-v-tunica-county-miss/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">221</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 227 (5th Cir. 2008) (reversing district\n\ncourt determination that county was not liable for sheriff’s actions because “the sheriff’s decision\n\n. . . is the kind of single decision by the relevant policymaker that can be the basis of liability);\n\nSeamons v.

Pape, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106170\"><a href=\"/opinion/106170/monroe-v-pape/\"><span class=\"volume\">365</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">167</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1961), which\n\nheld that Congress intended municipalities to be absolutely immune from suit under section\n\n1983. The Court was quite clear that there were limits to what it was announcing at that time:\n\n“Since this case unquestionably involved official policy as the moving force of the constitutional\n\nviolation found by the District Court . . . we must reverse the judgment below. In doing so, we\n\nhave no occasion to address and do not address what the full contours of municipal liability\n\nunder § 1983 may be.” 436 U.S. at 694–95. So the court did not hold that unless municipal\n\npolicy was the moving force behind the violation, liability will not attach – it held that because in\n\nthat case municipal policy was the moving force behind the violation, liability did attach. It\n\n\n\n\n                                                 22\n\ffollows then that if in a later case, it is determined that an official “ordinance, regulation, or\n\ndecision” caused the injury, see id. at 690, that too could be grounds for liability.\n\n       The Monell opinion made it clear that it was not outlining the contours of municipal\n\nliability for all purposes. The Court declared that governmental bodies are not wholly immune,\n\nand it also established the important principle that liability could not be vicarious. “In particular,\n\nwe conclude that municipality cannot be held liable solely because it employees a tortfeasor.” Id.\n\nat 691 (emphasis in original). The Court explained that such a rule was needed to implement the\n\ncausation requirement in the statute, which imposes liability on any person who “subjects” a\n\nperson to a deprivation of rights or one who “causes” a person “to be subjected” to a deprivation\n\nof rights. See id. at 692, citing 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The Court stated that the language in the\n\nstatute that imposes liability on a person who “causes” an employee to violate another’s\n\nconstitutional rights “cannot be easily read to impose liability vicariously on government bodies\n\nsolely on the basis of the existence of an employer-employee relationship with a tortfeasor.” Id.\n\n       The purpose of the policymaker analysis, then, was to provide guidance for those cases,\n\nsuch as City of Oklahoma City v. Tuttle, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111441\"><a href=\"/opinion/111441/oklahoma-city-v-tuttle/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">808</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1985), or Praprotnik, 485 U.S. at 112,\n\nwhere it was necessary to differentiate the acts of a municipal employee from the acts of the\n\nmunicipality itself. “The ‘official policy’ requirement was intended to distinguish acts of the\n\nmunicipality from acts of employees of the municipality, and thereby make clear that municipal\n\nliability is limited to actions for which the municipality is actually responsible.” Pembaur, 475\n\nU.S. at 479.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 23\n\f        As Justice Brennan wrote in his concurrence in Praprotnik:\n\n        Our decision in Monell, interpreting the statute to require a showing that\n        [constitutional] deprivations arise from municipal policy, did not employ the\n        policy requirement as an end in itself, but rather as a means of determining which\n        acts by municipal employees are properly attributed to the municipality. Congress,\n        we held, did not intend to subject cities to liability simply because they employ\n        tortfeasors. But where a municipality’s governing legislative body inflicts the\n        constitutional injury, the municipal policy inquiry is essentially superfluous . . .\n\n485 U.S. at 139 n 3.\n\n        The Court concludes that at bottom, in this case, the municipal policy inquiry is\n\nsuperfluous. There is no danger that finding the city to be responsible for the decision of its\n\nparole board would be imposing the kind of vicarious liability based “solely” on the acts of\n\nindividual, rogue employees that was prohibited by Monell.             In this case, the injury “was\n\ninflicted by . . . those whose edicts or acts may fairly be said to represent official policy,”\n\nPraprotnik, 485 U.S. at 121–22 (internal quotation marks omitted), and the revocation of\n\nplaintiff’s parole was therefore an “act[] ‘of the municipality,’ – that is, [an act] which the\n\nmunicipality has officially sanctioned or ordered.” Pembaur, 475 U.S. at 481. So, even if the\n\ntwo step policy test is not perfectly apt in this case, plaintiff is entitled to judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw.\n\n            E. The Court is bound to construe §1983 broadly.\n\n        In the end, faced with a difficult question of first impression, this Court considered\n\nwhether the Supreme Court had provided any direction on how close questions should be\n\nresolved in the future. On that point, the Court was unequivocal:\n\n\n\n\n                                                  24\n\f          [T]here can be no doubt that § 1 of the Civil Rights Act was intended to provide a\n          remedy, to be broadly construed, against all forms of official violation of federally\n          protected rights.\n\nMonell, 436 U.S. at 700–01. The Monell opinion quotes verbatim from the legislative history on\n\nthis point:\n\n          [T]his act is remedial, and in aid of the preservation of human liberty and human\n          rights. All statutes and constitutional provisions authorizing such statutes are\n          liberally and beneficently construed. It would be most strange and, in civilized\n          law, monstrous, if this were not the rule of interpretation.\n\n          Id. at 684, quoting Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., App. 335–336.             The Court\n\nwent on:\n\n          In both Houses, statement of the supporters of § 1 corroborated that Congress, in\n          enacting § 1, intended to give a broad remedy for violations of federally protected\n          civil rights.\n\nId. at 685. The fact that that Supreme Court explicitly underscored the need to construe the act\n\nbroadly lends further support to this Court’s conclusion that Mr. Singletary should prevail in his\n\naction.\n\n          Therefore, based on a thorough consideration of the cross motions for summary\n\njudgment, the oppositions, and the entire record of this case, the Court will deny the District’s\n\nmotion for summary judgment and grant plaintiff’s partial motion for summary judgment. The\n\nonly remaining issue is a determination of damages. A separate order will issue.\n\n\n\n\n                                                AMY BERMAN JACKSON\n                                                United States District Judge\n\nDATE: August 1, 2011\n\n\n\n                                                   25\n\f</pre>",
