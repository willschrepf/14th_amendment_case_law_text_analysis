Hawkins‟s theory is that the airline defendants are\nresponsible under section 2810 for Sereca‟s alleged violations of wage and hour laws. As\nstated in Castillo v. Toll Bros., Inc. (2011) 197 Cal.App.4th 1172, 1182, “section 2810\nauthorizes the employees of a services contractor [in certain industries] to sue the party\nhiring the contractor if the hiring party knowingly pays a contract price insufficient to\npermit the contractor to comply with the law in performing the contract.”\n       Although Hawkins sued the airline defendants for entering into underfunded\ncontracts, she admits that she has never seen the relevant contracts and has no\ninformation concerning their contents. She contends, however, that she may sue first and\nconduct discovery later to ascertain whether any of the contracts was underfunded. The\nairline defendants disagree. They contend that because Hawkins failed to allege any facts\nto show that they knowingly entered into underfunded contracts in violation of section\n2810, the demurrers were properly sustained. For the reasons that follow, we agree that\nthe complaint fails to allege sufficient facts to state a cause of action and affirm.\n\n\n                                      BACKGROUND\n\n\n       In part I below, we discuss the events leading to the entry of Sereca‟s default. In\npart II, we address the amended pleading that added a section 2810 claim against the\nairline defendants.\n\n\n\n\n       “(3) A failure by a person or entity to request or obtain any information from the\ncontractor that is required by any applicable statute or by the contract or agreement\nbetween them, constitutes knowledge of that information for purposes of this section.\n       “(j) For the purposes of this section, „warehouse‟ means a facility the primary\noperation of which is the storage or distribution of general merchandise, refrigerated\ngoods, or other products.”\n\n\n                                               5\n\fI.     The Events Leading to the Entry of Sereca’s Default\n       According to Hawkins‟s first amended complaint, Sereca allegedly failed to:\n(1) reimburse employees for required uniforms (first cause of action); (2) pay all wages\ndue immediately upon termination (second cause of action); (3) provide complete and\ncorrect itemized wage statements (third cause of action); (4) pay all wages due in each\npay period (fourth cause of action); and (5) pay overtime wages (fifth cause of action).\n(Lab. Code, §§ 2802, 201-202, 226, 204, 1194.) Sereca also allegedly violated the unfair\ncompetition law (Bus. & Prof. Code, § 17200) (sixth cause of action).\n       The complaint alleged that Sereca “had the ability to pay all wages earned by\nFormer Security Guard Class and Late Pay Class at the time of termination in accordance\nwith Labor Code §§ 201 and 202, but intentionally adopted . . . policies or practices\nincompatible with the requirements of Labor Code §§ 201 and 202.” (Italics added.)\nWithout alleging a dollar amount, the complaint sought on behalf of all similarly situated\nplaintiffs, the payment of all wages earned and owed, statutory penalties, reimbursement\nof the cost to purchase the required uniforms, and injunctive relief.\n       In March 2011, Hawkins allegedly learned that due to financial problems, it was\nunlikely that Sereca would be able to pay a judgment on a class basis. After receiving\nthis information, Hawkins filed a second amended complaint that added two entities\naffiliated with Sereca3 as Doe defendants based on a joint employer theory.\n       Also in April 2011, the trial court granted the motion of Sereca‟s attorney,\nDaniel G. Emilio, to be relieved as counsel due to “irreconcilable differences” with his\nclient. After Sereca failed to substitute new counsel within the allotted time, the trial\ncourt struck Sereca‟s answer and entered its default. However, the court set aside\nSereca‟s default in August 2011, after Emilio was rehired as Sereca‟s attorney.\n\n\n\n\n3      The Sereca-related entities are Sereca, C.A. and Serenos Responsable Sereca C.A.\nAll references in this opinion to Sereca are intended to include, where appropriate, the\nSereca-related entities.\n\n\n                                              6\n\f       In October 2011, Hawkins moved to certify a class consisting of all Sereca\nemployees in California who held the position of security guard within the class period.\nThe evidence in support of the motion showed that Sereca‟s only California clients were\nthe airline defendants at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX).\n       In support of her motion, Hawkins submitted a declaration in which she stated\nthat: (1) she was employed by Sereca from May 2007 to September 4, 2009; (2) she was\nassigned to work as a security guard at LAX for TACA; (3) she did not receive\ncompensation for all hours worked; (4) she was not reimbursed for the cost of her\nrequired uniform (approximately $300); and (5) she did not receive her final paycheck in\na timely manner. Hawkins submitted declarations of other prospective class members\nthat described similar violations.\n       In December 2011, the trial court granted Hawkins‟s motion for class certification.\nThe trial court found that the plaintiff class was both ascertainable and sufficiently\nnumerous to warrant class treatment; that Hawkins‟s claims were typical of a class\nconsisting of 271 persons who had worked as security guards for Sereca during the class\nperiod; and that common issues predominated as to the primary claims for unreimbursed\nbusiness expenses, off-the-clock work, failure to pay final wages in a timely manner, and\nnoncompliant wage statements.\n       In January 2012, Emilio again moved to be relieved as Sereca‟s counsel based on\n“irreconcilable differences” with his client. The trial court granted the motion on\nFebruary 28, 2012. After Sereca failed to obtain new counsel within the allotted time, its\nanswer was stricken and its default was entered on May 8, 2012.4\n\n\n\n\n4      Because the complaint did not allege a specific amount of damages, Hawkins was\nnot eligible to obtain a default judgment in the principal amount alleged in the complaint\nunder the procedure set forth in Code of Civil Procedure section 585, subdivision (a) or\n(b).\n\n\n                                              7\n\fII.    Hawkins Sues TACA, LAN, and Volaris Under Section 2810\n       On February 28, 2012, Hawkins filed a third amended complaint, the operative\npleading, which added a seventh cause of action for violation of section 2810 against the\nairline defendants.\n\n\n       A.     The Section 2810 Allegations\n       The seventh cause of action alleged, for the first time, that Sereca had entered into\na contract or contracts with each of the airline defendants, which the defendants knew or\nshould have known lacked sufficient funds to allow Sereca to comply with all applicable\nlocal, state, and federal laws or regulations governing the labor or services to be\nprovided. However, the seventh cause of action failed to identify or describe any of the\ncontracts between Sereca and each airline defendant. Instead, the seventh cause of action\ntracked the statutory language of section 2810 and stated as follows:\n       “[T]he contracts entered between TACA, VOLARIS, LAN and [SERECA] for\nsecurity services . . . provided insufficient funds to allow [SERECA] to comply with all\napplicable local, state, and federal laws or regulations governing the labor or services to\nbe provided. [¶] . . . The routine and systematic failure of TACA, VOLARIS and LAN\nto provide adequate funds to [SERECA] has predictably resulted in the wholesale\ndisregard and violation of wage and hour laws by [SERECA]. [¶] . . . At each of the\ntimes that TACA, VOLARIS and LAN entered into contracts with [SERECA] they have\nknown, or should have known, that each contract did not provide sufficient funds to allow\n[SERECA] to comply with all applicable local, state, and federal laws or regulations\ngoverning the labor or services provided. [¶] . . . As a direct and proximate result of the\nfailure of TACA, VOLARIS and LAN to provide sufficient funds to Defendants in\nviolation of Labor Code § 2810, the employees of [SERECA] have been injured in that\nthe employees have suffered, and continue to suffer, losses related to the use and\nenjoyment of wages and lost interest on such wages all to [their] damage in [an] amount\naccording to proof at trial. [¶] . . . Pursuant to Labor Code § 2810(g)(1) Plaintiff and\nother similarly situated employees are entitled to recover their actual damages or $250\n\n\n                                              8\n\fper employee per violation for an initial violation and $1,000 per employee for each\nsubsequent violation. [¶] . . . Pursuant to Labor Code § 2810(g)(1), Plaintiff and the\nother similarly situated employees are entitled to reasonable attorney‟s fees and costs of\nsuit.”\n\n\n         B.    The Demurrers to the Seventh Cause of Action\n         In April and May 2012, the airline defendants separately demurred to the seventh\ncause of action. Although their demurrers were not identical, they generally argued that\nit was legally insufficient to bring a section 2810 claim based solely on the language of\nthe statute and without stating any facts to support an allegation that the contracting\nparties knew or should have known that their contracts were underfunded.\n         As previously mentioned, it was undisputed that Hawkins filed her section 2810\nclaim without having seen the contracts or obtaining any information regarding their\ncontents. In opposition to the demurrers, Hawkins stated that she had tried to obtain the\nrelevant contracts from Sereca, but “Sereca indicated that it no longer had possession,\ncustody or control of the contracts.” Hawkins argued that as parties to the contracts, the\nairline defendants were familiar with their terms and, therefore, less specificity in the\npleading was required under the rule of liberal construction. (Citing Code Civ. Proc.,\n§ 452 [“In the construction of a pleading, for the purpose of determining its effect, its\nallegations must be liberally construed, with a view to substantial justice between the\nparties.”]; Bradley v. Hartford Acc. & Indem. Co. (1973) 30 Cal.App.3d 818, 825 [less\nspecificity is required where the defendants necessarily possess full information\nconcerning the facts of the dispute].)\n         On May 15, 2012, the trial court sustained the demurrers of TACA and LAN. The\ntrial court stated at the hearing: “There‟s no indication on the face of the complaint that\nTACA is or has been an employer of plaintiff.” “Neither TACA or LAN CARGO are the\nemployer. I think by definition we start there. They are contractors or contractees, I‟m\nnot sure which it is because I don‟t have a contract, with what appears to be the plaintiffs‟\nemployer and paid her money.”\n\n\n                                              9\n\f       On May 31, 2012, Hawkins moved for leave to file a fourth amended complaint,\nwhich she stated would “clarify the allegations necessary to adequately plead a cause of\naction for violation of Labor Code § 2810” by: (1) alleging that Sereca was her sole\nemployer; (2) eliminating the joint employer allegations against the Sereca-related\nentities; and (3) alleging that section 2810 was intended to protect employees of the\nsecurity guard industry by allowing them to sue the hiring entity that contracted with their\nemployer, if their employer failed to pay all wages earned and owed. On June 26, 2012,\nthe trial court denied the motion. Accordingly, the third amended complaint remained\nthe operative pleading.\n       On June 19, 2012, the trial court heard Volaris‟s demurrer, which was\n“substantively identical” to the demurrers of TACA and LAN. Volaris argued that “one\nof the key issues is that . . . plaintiff failed to plead that she performed any services for\nVolaris at all. And the statute is specific in that it states it must be pled and proved or it\nmust be pleaded and proved that an employee was injured as a result of a violation of a\nlabor law or regulation in connection with the performance of the contract or agreement.\nAnd that‟s just simply not alleged at all.”\n       In opposition, Hawkins argued that “fact pleading” was not required by the statute.\nHawkins contended the airline defendants had failed to establish that “an employee\nwould have access to private contracts between the employer and its customers.”\nHawkins claimed that “all an employee has to do is allege that his or her employer\ncontracted with a customer, a client; the contract was underfunded. Then there is a\npresumption that, if there is a written agreement between the customer and the employer\nthat satisfies all the requirements set forth in Labor Code section 2810, subsection (d),\nthen they‟re off the hook. It‟s easy. If they have a contract that complies with Labor\nCode section 2810, show it to me. I‟ll be the first person to dismiss them. I don‟t want\nthem in the case. If Labor Code section 2810 does not apply to them, show me the\ndocument. Show me the document that complies with Labor Code section 2810,\nsubsection (d).”\n\n\n\n                                               10\n\f       After sustaining Volaris‟s demurrer, the trial court entered a judgment of dismissal\nin favor of the airline defendants. This timely appeal followed.\n\n\n                                      DISCUSSION\n\n\nI.     Standard of Review\n       “„A demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the factual allegations in a complaint.\nWe independently review the sustaining of a demurrer and determine de novo whether\nthe complaint alleges facts sufficient to state a cause of action or discloses a complete\ndefense. (McCall v. PacifiCare of Cal., Inc. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 412, 415.) We assume the\ntruth of the properly pleaded factual allegations, facts that reasonably can be inferred\nfrom those expressly pleaded and matters of which judicial notice has been taken.\n(Schifando v. City of Los Angeles (2003) 31 Cal.4th 1074, 1081.) We construe the\npleading in a reasonable manner and read the allegations in context. (Ibid.)‟ (Villari v.\nMozilo (2012) 208 Cal.App.4th 1470, 1477.)” (So v. Shin (2013) 212 Cal.App.4th 652,\n661-662.)\n\n\nII.    Hawkins’s Contention That She Could Not Obtain the Contracts Prior to\n       Suing the Airline Defendants Is Incorrect\n       In her opening brief, Hawkins asserts that prior to suing the airline defendants, she\ntried but could not obtain the relevant contracts from Sereca and one of the airline\ndefendants. She then concludes, “Thus, plaintiff was necessarily limited to making\ngeneral allegations in support of the claim under section 2810.”5\n\n\n\n5      In her reply brief and accompanying request for judicial notice of August 30,\n2013, which we granted, Hawkins asserts, for the first time, that after the airline\ndefendants filed their respective demurrers, she served each airline with a request to\nproduce their respective contracts with Sereca for security guard services at LAX during\nthe class period. Hawkins also states in her reply brief that none of the airline defendants\n                                                                             (Fn. continued.)\n\n                                             11\n\f       Our difficulty with this contention is that it ignores the existence of other means of\nobtaining the contract from Sereca‟s clients short of suing them. For example, Code of\nCivil Procedure section 2020.010 provides: “(a) Any of the following methods may be\nused to obtain discovery within the state from a person who is not a party to the action in\nwhich the discovery is sought: [¶] (1) An oral deposition under Chapter 9 (commencing\nwith Section 2025.010). [¶] (2) A written deposition under Chapter 11 (commencing\nwith Section 2028.010). [¶] (3) A deposition for production of business records and\nthings under Article 4 (commencing with Section 2020.410) or Article 5 (commencing\nwith Section 2020.510). [¶] (b) Except as provided in subdivision (a) of Section\n2025.280, the process by which a nonparty is required to provide discovery is a\ndeposition subpoena.”6\n\n\n\nproduced the requested contracts and although TACA and LAN objected to the document\nrequest after their demurrers were sustained, Volaris never responded.\n        Even assuming all of the above is true, Hawkins has failed to explain how this will\nhelp her position. The record fails to indicate that Hawkins ever attempted to compel a\nresponse to her discovery request and it is too late to do so now. The fact remains that, as\nwe discuss in the body of the opinion, Hawkins could have sought the contracts from the\nairline defendants by conducting third party discovery prior to suing them.\n\n6       See also Code of Civil Procedure, section 1985, which states:\n        “(a) The process by which the attendance of a witness is required is the subpoena.\nIt is a writ or order directed to a person and requiring the person‟s attendance at a\nparticular time and place to testify as a witness. It may also require a witness to bring\nany books, documents, electronically stored information, or other things under the\nwitness‟s control which the witness is bound by law to produce in evidence. When a\ncounty recorder is using the microfilm system for recording, and a witness is subpoenaed\nto present a record, the witness shall be deemed to have complied with the subpoena if\nthe witness produces a certified copy thereof.\n        “(b) A copy of an affidavit shall be served with a subpoena duces tecum issued\nbefore trial, showing good cause for the production of the matters and things described in\nthe subpoena, specifying the exact matters or things desired to be produced, setting forth\nin full detail the materiality thereof to the issues involved in the case, and stating that the\nwitness has the desired matters or things in his or her possession or under his or her\ncontrol.\n                                                                               (Fn. continued.)\n\n                                              12\n\f       Even if we assume that Hawkins had tried informally to obtain one or more\ncontracts from an airline defendant prior to filing her section 2810 claim, there is no\nindication that she attempted to utilize any formal discovery methods such as those listed\nin Code of Civil Procedure section 2020.010. This is a significant omission. Given that\nHawkins had requested the contracts from Sereca during discovery,7 she was aware of\ntheir relevance to this litigation. But after Sereca informed Hawkins that it no longer\npossessed the contracts, she could have but did not seek to obtain them through third\nparty discovery prior to filing her section 2810 claim.\n       If Hawkins had requested the contracts through third party discovery prior to suing\nthe airline defendants, she presumably would have obtained them. There is no indication\nin the record that the airline defendants no longer possess the contracts. And upon\nobtaining the contracts, Hawkins could have ascertained whether they were underfunded.\nThe record therefore does not support her contention that she “was necessarily limited to\nmaking general allegations in support of the claim under section 2810.”\n\n\nIII.   The Rule of Liberal Construction Does Not Eliminate the Factual Gaps in the\n       Seventh Cause of Action for Violation of Section 2810\n       Hawkins contends that because she was not privy to the contracts or agreements\nbetween the airline defendants and her employer, she is excused under the rule of liberal\n\n       “(c) The clerk, or a judge, shall issue a subpoena or subpoena duces tecum signed\nand sealed but otherwise in blank to a party requesting it, who shall fill it in before\nservice. An attorney at law who is the attorney of record in an action or proceeding, may\nsign and issue a subpoena to require attendance before the court in which the action or\nproceeding is pending or at the trial of an issue therein, or upon the taking of a deposition\nin an action or proceeding pending therein; the subpoena in such a case need not be\nsealed. An attorney at law who is the attorney of record in an action or proceeding, may\nsign and issue a subpoena duces tecum to require production of the matters or things\ndescribed in the subpoena.”\n\n7     On appeal, Hawkins moved to take judicial notice of its discovery request in\nwhich Sereca was asked to produce the relevant contracts, and Sereca‟s response that it\nno longer possessed the contracts. The motion for judicial notice is granted.\n\n\n                                             13\n\fconstruction from making any detailed factual allegations concerning those contracts or\nagreements. (Citing Okun v. Superior Court (1981) 29 Cal.3d 442, 458 [slander can be\ncharged by alleging, based on information and belief, the substance of the defamatory\nstatement]; Burks v. Poppy Construction Co. (1962) 57 Cal.2d 463, 474 [allegation that\nhousing accommodations were “publicly assisted” was not an improper conclusion of\nlaw]; Jackson v. Pasadena City School Dist. (1963) 59 Cal.2d 876, 879 [allegations of\nracial segregation in the schools and gerrymandering of school district‟s boundaries were\nnot improper conclusions of law]; Semole v. Sansoucie (1972) 28 Cal.App.3d 714, 719\n[wrongful death allegations tracking the language of the statute were not improper\nconclusions of law].)\n       The airline defendants contend, on the other hand, that a complaint must contain at\nminimum “[a] statement of the facts constituting the cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc.,\n§ 425.10.) They argue that the rule of liberal construction is insufficient to remedy the\ncomplaint‟s failure to allege any facts in support of the section 2810 claim. They contend\nthat “facts in support of each of the requirements of a statute upon which a cause of\naction is based must be specifically pled.” (Fisher v. San Pedro Peninsula Hospital\n(1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 590, 604.) They argue that “where the Legislature intends to\npermit an element of a claim to be alleged by reference to mere legal conclusions, it does\nso expressly. (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 456-460 [detailing certain types of claims and\nexplaining where general allegations may be made and specific facts need not be pled].)”\nThey point out that in Melton v. Boustred (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 521, the plaintiffs‟\nallegations that the defendant knew or should have known that his actions would expose\nthe plaintiffs to an unreasonable risk of bodily harm were more fact specific than those in\nthis case and were rejected by the court as “wholly conclusory.” (Id. at p. 536.)\n       We agree with the airline defendants that simply parroting the language of section\n2810 in the complaint is insufficient to state a cause of action under the statute. We find\nthe case of Carter v. Prime Healthcare Paradise Valley LLC (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 396\n(Carter) instructive. There, the plaintiffs alleged a hospital had committed acts that\nqualified as elder abuse. The trial court sustained the hospital‟s demurrer to the elder\n\n\n                                             14\n\fabuse claim, finding that the allegations did not constitute neglect within the meaning of\nthe Elder Abuse Act (Welf. & Inst. Code, § 15600 et seq.). (Carter at p. 402.). In\naffirming the trial court‟s order, the appellate panel wrote: “With respect to the conduct\nactually attributed to the Hospital—failure to treat Grant‟s pressure ulcers, administer\nprescribed antibiotics or stock the crash cart; false documentation; and purposefully\ninadequate testing for medications—plaintiffs contend their allegations the Hospital acted\n„recklessly‟ or „fraudulently‟ suffice to cause „the acts to rise to the level of neglect‟\nunder the Elder Abuse Act. We disagree. When we review a ruling on a demurrer, we\ndo not assume the truth of contentions or conclusions of fact or law, such as those\ncontained in plaintiffs‟ pleadings. [Citations.] „Facts, not conclusions, must be pleaded.‟\n[Citation.] Further, where, as here, statutory remedies are invoked, the facts „must be\npleaded with particularity.‟ [Citation.] Accordingly, plaintiffs‟ „[u]se of such\nterminology [as fraudulently and recklessly] cannot cure [the] failure to point out exactly\nhow or in what manner the [Hospital has] transgressed.‟ [Citation.]” (Id. at p. 410, fn.\nomitted.)\n       So it is here. In order to state a cause of action under section 2810, Hawkins must\ndo more than simply allege that “[a]t each of the times [the airline defendants] entered\ninto contracts with [Sereca] they have known, or should have known, that each contract\ndid not provide sufficient funds to allow [Sereca] to comply with all applicable local,\nstate, and federal laws or regulations governing the labor or services provided.” Echoing\nthe concerns of the airline defendants, it cannot be that a plaintiff employed in the\nindustries covered by section 2810 who has not been paid the wages he or she is owed\ncan state a claim under the statute against every entity who entered into a contract with\nthe employer simply by utilizing a pair of scissors and a paste pot and transferring the\nlanguage of the statute to a form complaint. Such a pleading “„cannot cure [the] failure\nto point out exactly how or in what manner the [airline defendants have] transgressed.‟”\n(Carter, supra, 198 Cal.App.4th at p. 410, quoting Lavine v. Jessup (1958) 161\nCal.App.2d 59, 69. See also Bockrath v. Aldrich Chemical Co. (1999) 21 Cal.4th 71, 81\n[plaintiff may not sue multiple defendants on speculation that their conduct caused harm\n\n\n                                              15\n\fand “thereafter try to learn through discovery whether the speculation was well-\nfounded”].)\n       Although no California state court has addressed this particular statute, a federal\ndistrict court recently decided a similar case involving section 2810 and found, as we do,\nthat the pleading did not allege sufficient facts to state a claim. (Rojas v. Brinderson\nConstructors, Inc. (C.D. Cal. 2008) 567 F.Supp.2d 1205, 1208-1209 (Rojas).) The court\nin Rojas stated: “Under Section 2810(a), an entity is liable „where the entity knows or\nshould know that the contract or agreement [it entered] does not include funds sufficient\nto allow the contractor to comply with all applicable local, state, and federal laws.‟ This\nlanguage unambiguously predicates an entity‟s liability on its entering into a contract\nwith actual or constructive knowledge of the insufficiency of the funds. Thus, in order to\nstate a claim against the Refinery Defendants, Plaintiffs must not merely allege that\nBrinderson violated applicable labor laws . . . but also that the Refinery Defendants knew\nor should have known that their contracts with Brinderson did not include sufficient\nfunds for Brinderson to comply with those laws.” (Ibid.)\n       The court in Rojas further stated: “Plaintiffs‟ bare allegations are also\ninconsequential; they neither speak to the alleged under-funding of the contracts nor the\nRefinery Defendants‟ knowledge thereof, which, after all, are the necessary elements of a\nSection 2810 claim. Indeed, the court has found but a single allegation in the [second\namended complaint] relevant to the 2810 claim. Specifically, Plaintiffs allege the\nRefinery Defendants „knew or should have known that the contracts did not include funds\nsufficient to comply with all applicable labor laws since [Brinderson] was the lowest\nbidder for this work.‟ . . . This allegation is futile because it rests on a wholly untenable\n(and absurd) inference. [¶] While the court does not purport to be an authority on the\nconstruction industry, it is sufficiently qualified to note that, ordinarily, the lowest bidder\nis also the winning bidder—that is the very nature of the process. . . . Without digressing\ninto the subtleties of the matter, the court would be remiss were it to impose a\npresumption of wrongdoing on an entity merely for accepting the lowest of several bids.\nThe grievous implications of Plaintiffs‟ proposition are readily apparent and require no\n\n\n                                              16\n\fexplication. Suffice it to say, this allegation, without more, does not raise Plaintiffs‟ right\nto Section 2810 relief above the speculative level. See [Bell Atlantic Corp. v.] Twombly\n[(2007) 550 U.S. 544,] 127 S.Ct. [1955,] 1965. [¶] Finally, Plaintiffs‟ allegations\nthemselves compel the conclusion that the 2810 claim is purely speculative. Among\nother things, Plaintiffs concede throughout their papers that they have not seen the\ncontracts at issue, yet speculate that those contracts neither include sufficient funds for\nBrinderson to comply with applicable labor laws nor the necessary elements to entitle the\nRefinery Defendants to Section 2810(b)‟s rebuttable presumption. . . . And, were that not\nenough, Plaintiffs‟ rampant guesswork never once accounts for, nor differentiates\nbetween, the separate contracts that Brinderson entered into with each of the six different\nRefinery Defendants. Simply, Plaintiffs may not proceed with this claim based on such\nvacuous allegations.” (Rojas, supra, 567 F.Supp.2d at pp. 1209-1210, fn. omitted.)\n       In this case, the complaint‟s allegations are inconsistent with a section 2810 claim\nthat the contracts were underfunded. As previously noted, the complaint alleged that\nSereca “had the ability to pay all wages earned by Former Security Guard Class and Late\nPay Class at the time of termination in accordance with Labor Code §§ 201 and 202, but\nintentionally adopted . . . policies or practices incompatible with the requirements of\nLabor Code §§ 201 and 202.” (Italics added.) If Sereca had the ability to pay all wages\nearned by the plaintiff classes, the contracts were not underfunded. Accordingly, the\nallegations in Rojas, which were held to be legally insufficient to state a claim under\nsection 2810, were actually stronger than those alleged in the present complaint.\n\n\n\n\n                                              17\n\f                                     DISPOSITION\n\n\n       The judgment (orders of dismissal) is affirmed.

App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1172</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1182, “section 2810\nauthorizes the employees of a services contractor [in certain industries] to sue the party\nhiring the contractor if the hiring party knowingly pays a contract price insufficient to\npermit the contractor to comply with the law in performing the contract.”\n       Although Hawkins sued the airline defendants for entering into underfunded\ncontracts, she admits that she has never seen the relevant contracts and has no\ninformation concerning their contents. She contends, however, that she may sue first and\nconduct discovery later to ascertain whether any of the contracts was underfunded. The\nairline defendants disagree. They contend that because Hawkins failed to allege any facts\nto show that they knowingly entered into underfunded contracts in violation of section\n2810, the demurrers were properly sustained. For the reasons that follow, we agree that\nthe complaint fails to allege sufficient facts to state a cause of action and affirm.\n\n\n                                      BACKGROUND\n\n\n       In part I below, we discuss the events leading to the entry of Sereca‟s default. In\npart II, we address the amended pleading that added a section 2810 claim against the\nairline defendants.\n\n\n\n\n       “(3) A failure by a person or entity to request or obtain any information from the\ncontractor that is required by any applicable statute or by the contract or agreement\nbetween them, constitutes knowledge of that information for purposes of this section.\n       “(j) For the purposes of this section, „warehouse‟ means a facility the primary\noperation of which is the storage or distribution of general merchandise, refrigerated\ngoods, or other products.”\n\n\n                                               5\n\fI.     The Events Leading to the Entry of Sereca’s Default\n       According to Hawkins‟s first amended complaint, Sereca allegedly failed to:\n(1) reimburse employees for required uniforms (first cause of action); (2) pay all wages\ndue immediately upon termination (second cause of action); (3) provide complete and\ncorrect itemized wage statements (third cause of action); (4) pay all wages due in each\npay period (fourth cause of action); and (5) pay overtime wages (fifth cause of action).\n(Lab. Code, §§ 2802, 201-202, 226, 204, 1194.) Sereca also allegedly violated the unfair\ncompetition law (Bus. & Prof. Code, § 17200) (sixth cause of action).\n       The complaint alleged that Sereca “had the ability to pay all wages earned by\nFormer Security Guard Class and Late Pay Class at the time of termination in accordance\nwith Labor Code §§ 201 and 202, but intentionally adopted . . . policies or practices\nincompatible with the requirements of Labor Code §§ 201 and 202.” (Italics added.)\nWithout alleging a dollar amount, the complaint sought on behalf of all similarly situated\nplaintiffs, the payment of all wages earned and owed, statutory penalties, reimbursement\nof the cost to purchase the required uniforms, and injunctive relief.\n       In March 2011, Hawkins allegedly learned that due to financial problems, it was\nunlikely that Sereca would be able to pay a judgment on a class basis. After receiving\nthis information, Hawkins filed a second amended complaint that added two entities\naffiliated with Sereca3 as Doe defendants based on a joint employer theory.\n       Also in April 2011, the trial court granted the motion of Sereca‟s attorney,\nDaniel G. Emilio, to be relieved as counsel due to “irreconcilable differences” with his\nclient. After Sereca failed to substitute new counsel within the allotted time, the trial\ncourt struck Sereca‟s answer and entered its default. However, the court set aside\nSereca‟s default in August 2011, after Emilio was rehired as Sereca‟s attorney.\n\n\n\n\n3      The Sereca-related entities are Sereca, C.A. and Serenos Responsable Sereca C.A.\nAll references in this opinion to Sereca are intended to include, where appropriate, the\nSereca-related entities.\n\n\n                                              6\n\f       In October 2011, Hawkins moved to certify a class consisting of all Sereca\nemployees in California who held the position of security guard within the class period.\nThe evidence in support of the motion showed that Sereca‟s only California clients were\nthe airline defendants at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX).\n       In support of her motion, Hawkins submitted a declaration in which she stated\nthat: (1) she was employed by Sereca from May 2007 to September 4, 2009; (2) she was\nassigned to work as a security guard at LAX for TACA; (3) she did not receive\ncompensation for all hours worked; (4) she was not reimbursed for the cost of her\nrequired uniform (approximately $300); and (5) she did not receive her final paycheck in\na timely manner. Hawkins submitted declarations of other prospective class members\nthat described similar violations.\n       In December 2011, the trial court granted Hawkins‟s motion for class certification.\nThe trial court found that the plaintiff class was both ascertainable and sufficiently\nnumerous to warrant class treatment; that Hawkins‟s claims were typical of a class\nconsisting of 271 persons who had worked as security guards for Sereca during the class\nperiod; and that common issues predominated as to the primary claims for unreimbursed\nbusiness expenses, off-the-clock work, failure to pay final wages in a timely manner, and\nnoncompliant wage statements.\n       In January 2012, Emilio again moved to be relieved as Sereca‟s counsel based on\n“irreconcilable differences” with his client. The trial court granted the motion on\nFebruary 28, 2012. After Sereca failed to obtain new counsel within the allotted time, its\nanswer was stricken and its default was entered on May 8, 2012.4\n\n\n\n\n4      Because the complaint did not allege a specific amount of damages, Hawkins was\nnot eligible to obtain a default judgment in the principal amount alleged in the complaint\nunder the procedure set forth in Code of Civil Procedure section 585, subdivision (a) or\n(b).\n\n\n                                              7\n\fII.    Hawkins Sues TACA, LAN, and Volaris Under Section 2810\n       On February 28, 2012, Hawkins filed a third amended complaint, the operative\npleading, which added a seventh cause of action for violation of section 2810 against the\nairline defendants.\n\n\n       A.     The Section 2810 Allegations\n       The seventh cause of action alleged, for the first time, that Sereca had entered into\na contract or contracts with each of the airline defendants, which the defendants knew or\nshould have known lacked sufficient funds to allow Sereca to comply with all applicable\nlocal, state, and federal laws or regulations governing the labor or services to be\nprovided. However, the seventh cause of action failed to identify or describe any of the\ncontracts between Sereca and each airline defendant. Instead, the seventh cause of action\ntracked the statutory language of section 2810 and stated as follows:\n       “[T]he contracts entered between TACA, VOLARIS, LAN and [SERECA] for\nsecurity services . . . provided insufficient funds to allow [SERECA] to comply with all\napplicable local, state, and federal laws or regulations governing the labor or services to\nbe provided. [¶] . . . The routine and systematic failure of TACA, VOLARIS and LAN\nto provide adequate funds to [SERECA] has predictably resulted in the wholesale\ndisregard and violation of wage and hour laws by [SERECA]. [¶] . . . At each of the\ntimes that TACA, VOLARIS and LAN entered into contracts with [SERECA] they have\nknown, or should have known, that each contract did not provide sufficient funds to allow\n[SERECA] to comply with all applicable local, state, and federal laws or regulations\ngoverning the labor or services provided. [¶] . . . As a direct and proximate result of the\nfailure of TACA, VOLARIS and LAN to provide sufficient funds to Defendants in\nviolation of Labor Code § 2810, the employees of [SERECA] have been injured in that\nthe employees have suffered, and continue to suffer, losses related to the use and\nenjoyment of wages and lost interest on such wages all to [their] damage in [an] amount\naccording to proof at trial. [¶] . . . Pursuant to Labor Code § 2810(g)(1) Plaintiff and\nother similarly situated employees are entitled to recover their actual damages or $250\n\n\n                                              8\n\fper employee per violation for an initial violation and $1,000 per employee for each\nsubsequent violation. [¶] . . . Pursuant to Labor Code § 2810(g)(1), Plaintiff and the\nother similarly situated employees are entitled to reasonable attorney‟s fees and costs of\nsuit.”\n\n\n         B.    The Demurrers to the Seventh Cause of Action\n         In April and May 2012, the airline defendants separately demurred to the seventh\ncause of action. Although their demurrers were not identical, they generally argued that\nit was legally insufficient to bring a section 2810 claim based solely on the language of\nthe statute and without stating any facts to support an allegation that the contracting\nparties knew or should have known that their contracts were underfunded.\n         As previously mentioned, it was undisputed that Hawkins filed her section 2810\nclaim without having seen the contracts or obtaining any information regarding their\ncontents. In opposition to the demurrers, Hawkins stated that she had tried to obtain the\nrelevant contracts from Sereca, but “Sereca indicated that it no longer had possession,\ncustody or control of the contracts.” Hawkins argued that as parties to the contracts, the\nairline defendants were familiar with their terms and, therefore, less specificity in the\npleading was required under the rule of liberal construction. (Citing Code Civ. Proc.,\n§ 452 [“In the construction of a pleading, for the purpose of determining its effect, its\nallegations must be liberally construed, with a view to substantial justice between the\nparties.”]; Bradley v. Hartford Acc. & Indem. Co. (1973) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2108543\"><a href=\"/opinion/2108543/bradley-v-hartford-acc-indem-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">30</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">818</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 825 [less\nspecificity is required where the defendants necessarily possess full information\nconcerning the facts of the dispute].)\n         On May 15, 2012, the trial court sustained the demurrers of TACA and LAN. The\ntrial court stated at the hearing: “There‟s no indication on the face of the complaint that\nTACA is or has been an employer of plaintiff.” “Neither TACA or LAN CARGO are the\nemployer. I think by definition we start there. They are contractors or contractees, I‟m\nnot sure which it is because I don‟t have a contract, with what appears to be the plaintiffs‟\nemployer and paid her money.”\n\n\n                                              9\n\f       On May 31, 2012, Hawkins moved for leave to file a fourth amended complaint,\nwhich she stated would “clarify the allegations necessary to adequately plead a cause of\naction for violation of Labor Code § 2810” by: (1) alleging that Sereca was her sole\nemployer; (2) eliminating the joint employer allegations against the Sereca-related\nentities; and (3) alleging that section 2810 was intended to protect employees of the\nsecurity guard industry by allowing them to sue the hiring entity that contracted with their\nemployer, if their employer failed to pay all wages earned and owed. On June 26, 2012,\nthe trial court denied the motion. Accordingly, the third amended complaint remained\nthe operative pleading.\n       On June 19, 2012, the trial court heard Volaris‟s demurrer, which was\n“substantively identical” to the demurrers of TACA and LAN. Volaris argued that “one\nof the key issues is that . . . plaintiff failed to plead that she performed any services for\nVolaris at all. And the statute is specific in that it states it must be pled and proved or it\nmust be pleaded and proved that an employee was injured as a result of a violation of a\nlabor law or regulation in connection with the performance of the contract or agreement.\nAnd that‟s just simply not alleged at all.”\n       In opposition, Hawkins argued that “fact pleading” was not required by the statute.\nHawkins contended the airline defendants had failed to establish that “an employee\nwould have access to private contracts between the employer and its customers.”\nHawkins claimed that “all an employee has to do is allege that his or her employer\ncontracted with a customer, a client; the contract was underfunded. Then there is a\npresumption that, if there is a written agreement between the customer and the employer\nthat satisfies all the requirements set forth in Labor Code section 2810, subsection (d),\nthen they‟re off the hook. It‟s easy. If they have a contract that complies with Labor\nCode section 2810, show it to me. I‟ll be the first person to dismiss them. I don‟t want\nthem in the case. If Labor Code section 2810 does not apply to them, show me the\ndocument. Show me the document that complies with Labor Code section 2810,\nsubsection (d).”\n\n\n\n                                               10\n\f       After sustaining Volaris‟s demurrer, the trial court entered a judgment of dismissal\nin favor of the airline defendants. This timely appeal followed.\n\n\n                                      DISCUSSION\n\n\nI.     Standard of Review\n       “„A demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the factual allegations in a complaint.\nWe independently review the sustaining of a demurrer and determine de novo whether\nthe complaint alleges facts sufficient to state a cause of action or discloses a complete\ndefense.

Hawkins’s Contention That She Could Not Obtain the Contracts Prior to\n       Suing the Airline Defendants Is Incorrect\n       In her opening brief, Hawkins asserts that prior to suing the airline defendants, she\ntried but could not obtain the relevant contracts from Sereca and one of the airline\ndefendants. She then concludes, “Thus, plaintiff was necessarily limited to making\ngeneral allegations in support of the claim under section 2810.”5\n\n\n\n5      In her reply brief and accompanying request for judicial notice of August 30,\n2013, which we granted, Hawkins asserts, for the first time, that after the airline\ndefendants filed their respective demurrers, she served each airline with a request to\nproduce their respective contracts with Sereca for security guard services at LAX during\nthe class period. Hawkins also states in her reply brief that none of the airline defendants\n                                                                             (Fn. continued.)\n\n                                             11\n\f       Our difficulty with this contention is that it ignores the existence of other means of\nobtaining the contract from Sereca‟s clients short of suing them. For example, Code of\nCivil Procedure section 2020.010 provides: “(a) Any of the following methods may be\nused to obtain discovery within the state from a person who is not a party to the action in\nwhich the discovery is sought: [¶] (1) An oral deposition under Chapter 9 (commencing\nwith Section 2025.010). [¶] (2) A written deposition under Chapter 11 (commencing\nwith Section 2028.010). [¶] (3) A deposition for production of business records and\nthings under Article 4 (commencing with Section 2020.410) or Article 5 (commencing\nwith Section 2020.510). [¶] (b) Except as provided in subdivision (a) of Section\n2025.280, the process by which a nonparty is required to provide discovery is a\ndeposition subpoena.”6\n\n\n\nproduced the requested contracts and although TACA and LAN objected to the document\nrequest after their demurrers were sustained, Volaris never responded.\n        Even assuming all of the above is true, Hawkins has failed to explain how this will\nhelp her position. The record fails to indicate that Hawkins ever attempted to compel a\nresponse to her discovery request and it is too late to do so now. The fact remains that, as\nwe discuss in the body of the opinion, Hawkins could have sought the contracts from the\nairline defendants by conducting third party discovery prior to suing them.\n\n6       See also Code of Civil Procedure, section 1985, which states:\n        “(a) The process by which the attendance of a witness is required is the subpoena.\nIt is a writ or order directed to a person and requiring the person‟s attendance at a\nparticular time and place to testify as a witness. It may also require a witness to bring\nany books, documents, electronically stored information, or other things under the\nwitness‟s control which the witness is bound by law to produce in evidence. When a\ncounty recorder is using the microfilm system for recording, and a witness is subpoenaed\nto present a record, the witness shall be deemed to have complied with the subpoena if\nthe witness produces a certified copy thereof.\n        “(b) A copy of an affidavit shall be served with a subpoena duces tecum issued\nbefore trial, showing good cause for the production of the matters and things described in\nthe subpoena, specifying the exact matters or things desired to be produced, setting forth\nin full detail the materiality thereof to the issues involved in the case, and stating that the\nwitness has the desired matters or things in his or her possession or under his or her\ncontrol.\n                                                                               (Fn. continued.)\n\n                                              12\n\f       Even if we assume that Hawkins had tried informally to obtain one or more\ncontracts from an airline defendant prior to filing her section 2810 claim, there is no\nindication that she attempted to utilize any formal discovery methods such as those listed\nin Code of Civil Procedure section 2020.010. This is a significant omission. Given that\nHawkins had requested the contracts from Sereca during discovery,7 she was aware of\ntheir relevance to this litigation. But after Sereca informed Hawkins that it no longer\npossessed the contracts, she could have but did not seek to obtain them through third\nparty discovery prior to filing her section 2810 claim.\n       If Hawkins had requested the contracts through third party discovery prior to suing\nthe airline defendants, she presumably would have obtained them. There is no indication\nin the record that the airline defendants no longer possess the contracts. And upon\nobtaining the contracts, Hawkins could have ascertained whether they were underfunded.\nThe record therefore does not support her contention that she “was necessarily limited to\nmaking general allegations in support of the claim under section 2810.”\n\n\nIII.   The Rule of Liberal Construction Does Not Eliminate the Factual Gaps in the\n       Seventh Cause of Action for Violation of Section 2810\n       Hawkins contends that because she was not privy to the contracts or agreements\nbetween the airline defendants and her employer, she is excused under the rule of liberal\n\n       “(c) The clerk, or a judge, shall issue a subpoena or subpoena duces tecum signed\nand sealed but otherwise in blank to a party requesting it, who shall fill it in before\nservice. An attorney at law who is the attorney of record in an action or proceeding, may\nsign and issue a subpoena to require attendance before the court in which the action or\nproceeding is pending or at the trial of an issue therein, or upon the taking of a deposition\nin an action or proceeding pending therein; the subpoena in such a case need not be\nsealed. An attorney at law who is the attorney of record in an action or proceeding, may\nsign and issue a subpoena duces tecum to require production of the matters or things\ndescribed in the subpoena.”\n\n7     On appeal, Hawkins moved to take judicial notice of its discovery request in\nwhich Sereca was asked to produce the relevant contracts, and Sereca‟s response that it\nno longer possessed the contracts. The motion for judicial notice is granted.\n\n\n                                             13\n\fconstruction from making any detailed factual allegations concerning those contracts or\nagreements.

Proc.,\n§ 425.10.) They argue that the rule of liberal construction is insufficient to remedy the\ncomplaint‟s failure to allege any facts in support of the section 2810 claim.

We find\nthe case of Carter v. Prime Healthcare Paradise Valley LLC (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">198</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Code, § 15600 et seq.). (Carter at p. 402.). In\naffirming the trial court‟s order, the appellate panel wrote: “With respect to the conduct\nactually attributed to the Hospital—failure to treat Grant‟s pressure ulcers, administer\nprescribed antibiotics or stock the crash cart; false documentation; and purposefully\ninadequate testing for medications—plaintiffs contend their allegations the Hospital acted\n„recklessly‟ or „fraudulently‟ suffice to cause „the acts to rise to the level of neglect‟\nunder the Elder Abuse Act. We disagree. When we review a ruling on a demurrer, we\ndo not assume the truth of contentions or conclusions of fact or law, such as those\ncontained in plaintiffs‟ pleadings. [Citations.] „Facts, not conclusions, must be pleaded.‟\n[Citation.] Further, where, as here, statutory remedies are invoked, the facts „must be\npleaded with particularity.‟ [Citation.] Accordingly, plaintiffs‟ „[u]se of such\nterminology [as fraudulently and recklessly] cannot cure [the] failure to point out exactly\nhow or in what manner the [Hospital has] transgressed.‟ [Citation.]” (Id. at p. 410, fn.\nomitted.)\n       So it is here. In order to state a cause of action under section 2810, Hawkins must\ndo more than simply allege that “[a]t each of the times [the airline defendants] entered\ninto contracts with [Sereca] they have known, or should have known, that each contract\ndid not provide sufficient funds to allow [Sereca] to comply with all applicable local,\nstate, and federal laws or regulations governing the labor or services provided.” Echoing\nthe concerns of the airline defendants, it cannot be that a plaintiff employed in the\nindustries covered by section 2810 who has not been paid the wages he or she is owed\ncan state a claim under the statute against every entity who entered into a contract with\nthe employer simply by utilizing a pair of scissors and a paste pot and transferring the\nlanguage of the statute to a form complaint. Such a pleading “„cannot cure [the] failure\nto point out exactly how or in what manner the [airline defendants have] transgressed.‟”\n(Carter, supra, 198 Cal.App.4th at p. 410, quoting Lavine v.

(Rojas v. Brinderson\nConstructors, Inc. (C.D. Cal. 2008) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1454682\"><a href=\"/opinion/1454682/rojas-v-brinderson-constructors-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">567</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1205</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1208-1209 (Rojas).) The court\nin Rojas stated: “Under Section 2810(a), an entity is liable „where the entity knows or\nshould know that the contract or agreement [it entered] does not include funds sufficient\nto allow the contractor to comply with all applicable local, state, and federal laws.‟ This\nlanguage unambiguously predicates an entity‟s liability on its entering into a contract\nwith actual or constructive knowledge of the insufficiency of the funds. Thus, in order to\nstate a claim against the Refinery Defendants, Plaintiffs must not merely allege that\nBrinderson violated applicable labor laws . . . but also that the Refinery Defendants knew\nor should have known that their contracts with Brinderson did not include sufficient\nfunds for Brinderson to comply with those laws.” (Ibid.)\n       The court in Rojas further stated: “Plaintiffs‟ bare allegations are also\ninconsequential; they neither speak to the alleged under-funding of the contracts nor the\nRefinery Defendants‟ knowledge thereof, which, after all, are the necessary elements of a\nSection 2810 claim. Indeed, the court has found but a single allegation in the [second\namended complaint] relevant to the 2810 claim. Specifically, Plaintiffs allege the\nRefinery Defendants „knew or should have known that the contracts did not include funds\nsufficient to comply with all applicable labor laws since [Brinderson] was the lowest\nbidder for this work.‟ . . . This allegation is futile because it rests on a wholly untenable\n(and absurd) inference. [¶] While the court does not purport to be an authority on the\nconstruction industry, it is sufficiently qualified to note that, ordinarily, the lowest bidder\nis also the winning bidder—that is the very nature of the process. . . . Without digressing\ninto the subtleties of the matter, the court would be remiss were it to impose a\npresumption of wrongdoing on an entity merely for accepting the lowest of several bids.\nThe grievous implications of Plaintiffs‟ proposition are readily apparent and require no\n\n\n                                              16\n\fexplication. Suffice it to say, this allegation, without more, does not raise Plaintiffs‟ right\nto Section 2810 relief above the speculative level. See [Bell Atlantic Corp. v.] Twombly\n[(2007) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145730\"><a href=\"/opinion/145730/bell-atlantic-corp-v-twombly/\"><span class=\"volume\">550</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">544</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,] 127 S.Ct. [1955,] 1965. [¶] Finally, Plaintiffs‟ allegations\nthemselves compel the conclusion that the 2810 claim is purely speculative. Among\nother things, Plaintiffs concede throughout their papers that they have not seen the\ncontracts at issue, yet speculate that those contracts neither include sufficient funds for\nBrinderson to comply with applicable labor laws nor the necessary elements to entitle the\nRefinery Defendants to Section 2810(b)‟s rebuttable presumption. . . . And, were that not\nenough, Plaintiffs‟ rampant guesswork never once accounts for, nor differentiates\nbetween, the separate contracts that Brinderson entered into with each of the six different\nRefinery Defendants. Simply, Plaintiffs may not proceed with this claim based on such\nvacuous allegations.” (Rojas, supra, 567 F.Supp.2d at pp. 1209-1210, fn. omitted.)\n       In this case, the complaint‟s allegations are inconsistent with a section 2810 claim\nthat the contracts were underfunded. As previously noted, the complaint alleged that\nSereca “had the ability to pay all wages earned by Former Security Guard Class and Late\nPay Class at the time of termination in accordance with Labor Code §§ 201 and 202, but\nintentionally adopted . . . policies or practices incompatible with the requirements of\nLabor Code §§ 201 and 202.” (Italics added.) If Sereca had the ability to pay all wages\nearned by the plaintiff classes, the contracts were not underfunded. Accordingly, the\nallegations in Rojas, which were held to be legally insufficient to state a claim under\nsection 2810, were actually stronger than those alleged in the present complaint.\n\n\n\n\n                                              17\n\f                                     DISPOSITION\n\n\n       The judgment (orders of dismissal) is affirmed.
