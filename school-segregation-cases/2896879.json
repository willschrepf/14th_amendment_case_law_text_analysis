(“CHI”),\nMarlene K. Smith, Greg A. Luther, and Jay D. Banta (collec-\ntively, “plaintiffs”) appeal the district court’s partial denial of\ntheir motion for a preliminary injunction against the\ndefendants-appellees City of Boise, Idaho, its mayor, its city\ncouncil members, and two of its employees.\n\n  The City of Boise owned a homeless shelter, Community\nHouse, which was managed by CHI and provided housing to\nmen, women, and families. In 2004, the City assumed man-\nagement of Community House and then leased it to the Boise\nRescue Mission Ministries (“BRM”), a Christian non-profit\norganization. The women and families were removed from\nCommunity House, and the BRM now provides shelter there\nonly to homeless men. The BRM also includes a religious\ncomponent in the services it provides.\n\n   The district court declined to order reinstatement of resi-\ndents that had been removed from Community House, but\nenjoined the practice of requiring residents to attend worship\nservices in order to receive other services. The court did not\npreclude the use of Community House by the BRM for\nvoluntarily-attended religious programs.\n\n   The plaintiffs assert that the district court abused its discre-\ntion by denying a preliminary injunction that (1) would have\n\f               COMMUNITY HOUSE v. CITY OF BOISE            18417\nreinstated Community House residents excluded by the men-\nonly policy, and (2) would have voided the City’s lease with\nthe BRM. The plaintiffs argue that the men-only policy vio-\nlates the Fair Housing Act, and that the lease with the BRM\nviolates the Idaho Constitution and the Establishment Clause\nof the United States Constitution.\n\n   We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1). With\nregard to the plaintiffs’ Fair Housing Act claims based on sex\nand familial discrimination, we reverse the district court’s\ndenial of a preliminary injunction that would have required\nreinstatement of all former residents. We conclude that the\ndistrict court erred in applying the test of McDonnell Douglas\nCorp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802-04 (1973), because the\nCity’s men-only policy is facially discriminatory. See Ban-\ngerter v. Orem City Corp., 46 F.3d 1491, 1501 n.16 (10th Cir.\n1995).\n\n   With regard to the plaintiffs’ Establishment Clause claim,\nwe reverse the district court’s denial of a broader preliminary\ninjunction. We conclude that the district court abused its dis-\ncretion by determining that only a limited injunction was nec-\nessary to avoid an Establishment Clause violation. A broader\npreliminary injunction is required.\n\n   With regard to the plaintiffs’ Idaho Constitution claim,\nwhich they have raised for the first time in this appeal, for the\nreasons hereafter set forth we exercise our discretion and\ndecline to consider it.\n\n                    I.   BACKGROUND\n\n   CHI is a non-profit corporation that provides housing ser-\nvices to homeless and low income persons. Beginning in\n1994, CHI and the City worked together to build a homeless\nshelter known as Community House. Community House con-\ntained both a homeless shelter and a low income housing unit.\nThe homeless shelter could hold, in separate dormitories,\n\f18418         COMMUNITY HOUSE v. CITY OF BOISE\nsixty-six men, thirteen women, and ten families. The low\nincome, or “transitional,” housing contained ten family units\nand thirty-nine single-resident apartments. Community House\ncould accommodate the disabled, and about seventy-five per-\ncent of its residents were disabled.\n\n   In 2004, following a dispute with CHI, the City took over\noperation of Community House. The City then initiated a\nRequest for Proposal bid process for the operation of Commu-\nnity House, and ultimately chose the bid of the BRM. The\nCity leased Community House to the BRM on September 2,\n2005.\n\n   The BRM is a Christian non-profit organization that has\nserved the homeless population of Boise, Idaho for almost\nfifty years, most recently at four facilities in both Boise and\nNampa, Idaho. The BRM’s Boise facilities include a homeless\nshelter for single men known as the Boise Rescue Mission,\nand a shelter for women and children known as the City Light\nHome.\n\n   The BRM’s winning bid proposal contained a plan to move\nhomeless men from the Boise Rescue Mission to the Commu-\nnity House facility, and then turn the Boise Rescue Mission\ninto a shelter for homeless women and children. The BRM’s\npolicy is to segregate men and women into different facilities,\nand to segregate homeless singles from homeless families. It\nbelieves that the difficulties of serving the homeless popula-\ntion “are exacerbated in a mixed gender shelter environment.”\n\n   The chief goal of the BRM is to “help people at their physi-\ncal and spiritual points of need” by providing, among other\nassistance, “Christian teaching.” Before dinner, the BRM\noffers a sixty-minute Christian chapel service. The service\nconsists of singing, scripture reading, prayer, testimonies, and\npreaching.\n\n   In June of 2005, before its lease to the BRM commenced,\nthe City told staff members at Community House not to\n\f                 COMMUNITY HOUSE v. CITY OF BOISE                    18419\naccept any new residents. In August of 2005, in anticipation\nof the September 2005 transition to the BRM, the City\ninformed residents of Community House that they needed to\nmove. This move caused significant hardship for some resi-\ndents, most notably women, families, and the physically dis-\nabled. There was already a shortage of housing in the area,\nand these persons, for the most part, had to move into much\nless desirable housing than Community House.\n\n   The plaintiffs filed this action under the Fair Housing Act1\nand other laws. The plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction\nto prevent the removal of residents from Community House,\nto reinstate former residents, and to prevent the sale or lease\nof Community House during the pendency of this action. On\nOctober 28, 2005, the district court granted the plaintiffs’\nmotion in part, enjoining the City from relocating any former\nresident of Community House to housing that is near the resi-\ndence of a registered sex offender. The district court also\nenjoined the City from participating in a lease with the BRM\nif the BRM continued to require attendance at religious meet-\nings as a condition of receiving services. Neither party has\nchallenged these orders.\n\n   The district court denied the plaintiffs’ request for an\ninjunction requiring that former residents of Community\nHouse excluded by the men-only policy be allowed to return.\nThe court determined that the plaintiffs had not raised serious\nquestions that the City was discriminating against women,\nfamilies, or the disabled under the Fair Housing Act. The dis-\ntrict court further denied the plaintiffs’ request for a broader\ninjunction regarding the BRM’s religious activities at Com-\nmunity House, determining that the court’s more limited\n  1\n    Under the Fair Housing Act, it is unlawful to “make unavailable . . .\na dwelling to any person because of race, color, religion, sex, familial sta-\ntus, or national origin.” 42 U.S.C. § 3604(a). It is also unlawful to “make\nunavailable . . . a dwelling . . . because of a handicap.” 42 U.S.C.\n§ 3604(f)(1).\n\f18420          COMMUNITY HOUSE v. CITY OF BOISE\ninjunction removed any Establishment Clause violation. This\nappeal followed.\n\n              II.   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n   Our review of a district court’s decision regarding a prelim-\ninary injunction is “limited and deferential.” Sw. Voter Regis-\ntration Educ. Project v. Shelley, 344 F.3d 914, 918 (9th Cir.\n2003) (en banc). In general, we review a denial of a prelimi-\nnary injunction for abuse of discretion. See id.\n\n   The district court “necessarily abuses its discretion when it\nbases its decision on an erroneous legal standard or on clearly\nerroneous findings of fact.” Rucker v. Davis, 237 F.3d 1113,\n1118 (9th Cir. 2001) (en banc), rev’d on other grounds, Dep’t\nof Hous. & Urban Dev. v. Rucker, 535 U.S. 125 (2002). When\nthe district court is alleged to have relied on an erroneous\nlegal premise, we review the underlying issues of law de\nnovo. See Does 1-5 v. Chandler, 83 F.3d 1150, 1152 (9th Cir.\n1996).\n\n                     III.   DISCUSSION\n\nA.   Requirements for a Preliminary Injunction\n\n   To obtain a preliminary injunction, the moving party must\nshow either (1) a likelihood of success on the merits and the\npossibility of irreparable injury, or (2) the existence of serious\nquestions going to the merits and the balance of hardships tip-\nping in the moving party’s favor. See Warsoldier v. Wood-\nford, 418 F.3d 989, 993-94 (9th Cir. 2005). “These two\nalternatives represent extremes of a single continuum, rather\nthan two separate tests.” Id. at 994 (citation omitted).\n\nB.   Fair Housing Act Claims\n\n   The plaintiffs argue that the district court abused its discre-\ntion by denying the full preliminary injunction they sought.\n\f                 COMMUNITY HOUSE v. CITY OF BOISE                   18421\nThey contend they have shown that serious questions exist on\nthe merits regarding whether the City, in its lease with the\nBRM, is discriminating against women, families, and the dis-\nabled at Community House in violation of the Fair Housing\nAct.2\n\n   It is undisputed that the balance of hardships tips in favor\nof the plaintiffs who were excluded from Community House\ndue to the men-only policy. As to the Fair Housing Act\nclaims, therefore, the issue is whether the plaintiffs have\nraised serious questions that the policies at Community\nHouse, which the City authorizes, constitute gender, familial,\nor disability discrimination in violation of the Fair Housing\nAct.\n\n  1.    Gender and Familial Discrimination\n\n   The plaintiffs assert that the district court erred in applying\nthe McDonnell Douglas test to their gender and familial dis-\ncrimination claims because the men-only policy at Commu-\nnity House is facially discriminatory. We agree.\n\n  [1] A facially discriminatory policy is one which on its face\napplies less favorably to a protected group.3 See Frank v.\nUnited Airlines, Inc., 216 F.3d 845, 854 (9th Cir. 2000); see\n  2\n     We have previously applied the Fair Housing Act to homeless shelters.\nSee Turning Point v. City of Caldwell, 74 F.3d 941 (9th Cir. 1996).\n   3\n     In examining discrimination issues under the Fair Housing Act, we fre-\nquently draw from employment discrimination analysis. See Gamble v.\nCity of Escondido, 104 F.3d 300, 304 (9th Cir. 1997) (“We apply Title VII\ndiscrimination analysis in examining Fair Housing Act (‘FHA’) discrimi-\nnation claims. ‘Most courts applying the FHA, as amended by the [Fair\nHousing Act Amendments], have analogized it to Title VII of the Civil\nRights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e et seq., which prohibits discrimi-\nnation in employment.’ ” (quoting Larkin v. Mich. Dep’t of Soc. Servs., 89\nF.3d 285, 289 (6th Cir. 1996))); Pfaff v. U.S. Dep’t of Hous. & Urban\nDev., 88 F.3d 739, 745 n.1 (9th Cir. 1996) (“We may look for guidance\nto employment discrimination cases.”).\n\f18422          COMMUNITY HOUSE v. CITY OF BOISE\nalso Bangerter, 46 F.3d at 1500 (holding that an ordinance\nthat singled out the handicapped and applied different rules to\nthem was facially discriminatory). The men-only policy at\nCommunity House is facially discriminatory because it\nexplicitly treats women and families different from men. See\nInt’l Union, United Auto., Aerospace & Agric. Implement\nWorkers of Am. v. Johnson Controls, Inc., 499 U.S. 187, 197\n(1991). City documents and policy endorse this discrimina-\ntion.\n\n   While the lease between the City and the BRM provides\nthat the BRM shall operate “an emergency homeless shelter\nwith a capacity to serve not fewer than sixty-six (66) guests,”\nCity Ordinance No. 6404 provides that Community House be\noperated as “a shelter for a minimum of 66, single, homeless,\nmen, ages 18 years or older.” (emphasis added). City Resolu-\ntion No. 18765, approving the lease of Community House to\nthe BRM, specifically incorporates the restrictions of City\nOrdinance No. 6404.\n\n   More importantly, regardless of the language of the City’s\nlease with the BRM, the City does not dispute that the current\npolicy is to run Community House as a men-only shelter. The\ndistrict court found that “[i]t is undeniable . . . that the City\ntreated women differently than men” because “the men could\nreapply to be readmitted [to Community House] by [the]\nBRM, while the women were shut out by the men-only poli-\ncy.”\n\n   [2] We hold, contrary to the district court, that the plain-\ntiffs’ gender and familial discrimination claims are properly\ncharacterized as claims of facial discrimination and should be\nanalyzed in that framework. The McDonnell Douglas test is\ninapplicable to Fair Housing Act challenges to a facially dis-\ncriminatory policy. See Bangerter, 46 F.3d at 1501 n.16\n(“There is no need to probe for a potentially discriminatory\nmotive circumstantially, or to apply the burden-shifting\napproach outlined in McDonnell Douglas . . . as the statute\n\f               COMMUNITY HOUSE v. CITY OF BOISE            18423\ndiscriminates on its face by allowing conditions to be imposed\non group housing for the handicapped which would not be\npermitted for non-handicapped group housing.”); Reidt v.\nCounty of Trempealeau, 975 F.2d 1336, 1341 (7th Cir. 1992)\n(“The McDonnell Douglas procedure is inapt in a situation\ninvolving a facially discriminatory policy . . . .”). Instead, the\nSupreme Court’s decision in Johnson Controls, 499 U.S. at\n200-01, provides the appropriate approach in facial discrimi-\nnation cases such as this.\n\n   In Johnson Controls, the Supreme Court held that an\nemployer’s policy barring all women, except those whose\ninfertility was medically documented, from jobs involving\nlead exposure constituted sex discrimination forbidden under\nTitle VII. See id. at 211. The Supreme Court held that the\nemployer’s policy was facially discriminatory because it\nexplicitly discriminated against women on the basis of their\nsex. See id. at 197. The Supreme Court noted that this conclu-\nsion was not undermined by the ostensibly benign purpose of\nthe employer’s policy (protecting women’s unconceived off-\nspring). See id. at 199 (“[T]he absence of a malevolent motive\ndoes not convert a facially discriminatory policy into a neutral\npolicy with a discriminatory effect. Whether an employment\npractice involves disparate treatment through explicit facial\ndiscrimination does not depend on why the employer discrim-\ninates but rather on the explicit terms of the discrimination.”).\n\n   Because the employer’s policy in Johnson Controls was\nfacially discriminatory, the Supreme Court concluded that the\nappropriate test was whether sex was a “bona fide occupa-\ntional qualification” (“BFOQ”). See id. at 200; see also 42\nU.S.C. § 2000e-2(e)(1) (Under Title VII, an employer may\ndiscriminate on the basis of “religion, sex, or national origin\nin those certain instances where religion, sex, or national ori-\ngin is a bona fide occupational qualification [BFOQ] reason-\nably necessary to the normal operation of that particular\nbusiness or enterprise.”). The Supreme Court held that the\nemployer’s policy was not within the safety exceptions of the\n\f18424            COMMUNITY HOUSE v. CITY OF BOISE\nBFOQ defense. See id. at 204-06. As a result, the Supreme\nCourt concluded that the employer’s facially discriminatory\npolicy violated Title VII. See id. at 211.\n\n   [3] With regard to facially discriminatory housing policies,\nunder the Johnson Controls approach, “a plaintiff makes out\na prima facie case of intentional discrimination under the\n[Fair Housing Act] merely by showing that a protected group\nhas been subjected to explicitly differential — i.e. discrimina-\ntory — treatment.” Bangerter, 46 F.3d at 1501. Here, the\nplaintiffs have established a prima facie case of facial dis-\ncrimination under the Fair Housing Act because they have\nexplicitly been excluded from Community House based on\ntheir gender and familial status.\n\n   [4] As in the employment context, however, this does not\nmean that intentional differential treatment can never be justi-\nfied under the Fair Housing Act. See id. at 1501 n.17 (“This\nis not to say that a government can never justify any inten-\ntional differential treatment of the handicapped [under the\nFair Housing Act]. Some differential treatment may be objec-\ntively legitimate. In the Title VII context, for example,\nfacially discriminatory treatment is permitted if it represents\na . . . [ ]BFOQ[ ] that is reasonably necessary to an employ-\ner’s operations.”); Children’s Alliance v. City of Bellevue, 950\nF.Supp. 1491, 1497 (W.D. Wash. 1997) (“Even though the\nlanguage of the Ordinance singles out individuals for discrim-\ninatory treatment based on their familial status and handicap,\na proper justification can legitimize the different treatment\nand validate the Ordinance.”).\n\n   [5] We have not previously adopted a standard for deter-\nmining the propriety or acceptability of justifications for\nfacial discrimination under the Fair Housing Act.4 The circuits\n  4\n   The Fair Housing Act explicitly provides for certain exceptions to its\ndiscrimination prohibitions. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(9) (permitting\nhandicapped discrimination under the Fair Housing Act if the individual’s\n\f                 COMMUNITY HOUSE v. CITY OF BOISE                    18425\nthat have addressed this issue are split. The Eighth Circuit\nemploys the same standards for analyzing a defendant’s ratio-\nnales in challenges under the Fair Housing Act as it applies\nto claims under the Equal Protection Clause. See Oxford\nHouse-C v. City of St. Louis, 77 F.3d 249, 252 (8th Cir. 1996)\n(applying rational basis review to a defendant’s proffered jus-\ntifications for an ordinance that facially discriminated against\ndisabled persons); Familystyle of St. Paul v. City of St. Paul,\n923 F.2d 91, 94 (8th Cir. 1991) (same). The Sixth and Tenth\nCircuits employ a more searching method of analysis. To\nallow the circumstance of facial discrimination under the\nSixth and Tenth Circuits’ approach, a defendant must show\neither: (1) that the restriction benefits the protected class or\n(2) that it responds to legitimate safety concerns raised by the\nindividuals affected, rather than being based on stereotypes.\nSee Larkin, 89 F.3d at 290; Bangerter, 46 F.3d at 1503-04.\n\n   [6] We will follow the standard adopted by the Sixth and\nTenth Circuits, which standard is, we believe, more in line\nwith the Supreme Court’s analysis in Johnson Controls.\nMoreover, the Eighth Circuit’s approach is inappropriate for\nFair Housing Act claims because some classes of persons spe-\ncifically protected by the Fair Housing Act, such as families\nand the handicapped, are not protected classes for constitu-\ntional purposes. See Bangerter, 46 F.3d at 1503; Children’s\nAlliance, 950 F. Supp. at 1497-98.5\n\n“tenancy would constitute a direct threat to the health or safety of other\nindividuals or whose tenancy would result in substantial physical damage\nto the property of others”); 42 U.S.C. § 3607(b)(1) (providing for a senior\nhousing exemption under the Fair Housing Act). However, none of those\nexceptions is applicable here.\n   5\n     The majority of district courts to consider this question have also fol-\nlowed the Sixth and Tenth Circuits’ framework. See, e.g., Cmty. Hous.\nTrust v. Dep’t of Consumer & Regulatory Affairs, 257 F.Supp.2d 208,\n228-29 (D.D.C. 2003); United States v. City of Chicago Heights, 161 F.\nSupp.2d 819, 843 (N.D. Ill. 2001); Children’s Alliance, 950 F.Supp. at\n1497-98; Alliance for the Mentally Ill v. City of Naperville, 923 F.Supp.\n1057, 1074-75 (N.D. Ill. 1996).\n\f18426            COMMUNITY HOUSE v. CITY OF BOISE\n   Having determined the appropriate scrutiny to apply for\ndetermining whether the City’s facial discrimination under the\nFair Housing Act is permissible, we now evaluate the City’s\nproffered justifications for the men-only policy at Community\nHouse. The City asserts two justifications for the discrimina-\ntory policy: (1) safety concerns and (2) the policy allows the\nBRM to transfer homeless men from its Boise Rescue Mis-\nsion shelter to Community House, so that it can convert the\nBoise Rescue Mission into a shelter for women and children.6\nWe conclude that the plaintiffs have raised serious questions\nas to whether these asserted justifications satisfy the standards\nfor permissible discrimination under the Fair Housing Act.\n\n   The City provides little support to establish that the men-\nonly policy benefits women and families by protecting their\nsafety. The City’s only evidence regarding safety concerns is\nan affidavit from Bill Roscoe, the BRM’s Executive Director.\nRoscoe states that “[a]s a person with nearly 20 years of expe-\nrience serving the homeless, it is my opinion that mixing dis-\nparate populations in the same sleeping facility unnecessarily\nfosters conflicts.” He also states that:\n\n      The problems [of serving the homeless] are exacer-\n      bated in a mixed gender shelter environment. Fur-\n      ther, it is not always appropriate to have families,\n      particularly families with young or vulnerable chil-\n      dren, to sleep in the same facility as other members\n      of the homeless population. We believe that our sep-\n      arate shelter facilities for men and women is one of\n      the reasons why we have fewer police calls at our\n      facilities than Community House. For example, in\n      2004, all five of Rescue Mission’s facilities com-\n      bined had less than one-half of the police calls of\n      Community House.\n  6\n    Depending on the facility, men or women-only shelters might be justi-\nfied by privacy concerns. The City does not proffer a privacy justification\nbecause Community House provides separate rooms for men, women, and\nfamilies.\n\f               COMMUNITY HOUSE v. CITY OF BOISE            18427\n   [7] Other than Roscoe’s opinion, the City did not submit a\nsingle police report, incident report, or any other documenta-\ntion that supported any safety concerns. The “fewer police\ncalls” at the BRM’s other facilities does not establish that the\nmen-only policy is justified by safety concerns. There could\nhave been fewer police calls due to fewer residents at the\nother facilities. Or, there could have been fewer police calls\ndue to fewer disabled residents at those facilities and therefore\nless need for emergency medical assistance.\n\n   We do not foreclose the possibility that at a later stage in\nthis litigation, the City may be able to provide evidence to\nestablish that its men-only policy is indeed justified by legiti-\nmate safety concerns. Cf. Everson v. Mich. Dep’t of Correc-\ntions, 391 F.3d 737, 751-61 (6th Cir. 2004) (holding that\nfemale gender was a bona fide occupational qualification\nunder Title VII for certain officers at female prisons since evi-\ndence showed that exclusion of males was reasonably neces-\nsary for prison security as well as the safety and privacy of the\ninmates); Robino v. Iranon, 145 F.3d 1109, 1110-11 (9th Cir.\n1998) (same). However, at this point in the litigation, the\nplaintiffs have shown that serious questions exist on the mer-\nits as to whether the City’s men-only policy at Community\nHouse is justified by safety concerns.\n\n   The City’s other asserted justification for the men-only pol-\nicy at Community House is that it will allow the BRM to\ntransfer homeless men from its Boise Rescue Mission shelter\nto Community House, so that it can convert the Boise Rescue\nMission into a shelter for women and families. It argues that\nthe men-only policy benefits women and families because\nthey will only be temporarily disadvantaged in order to\nreceive increased shelter space at the nearby Boise Rescue\nMission when its conversion is completed.\n\n  [8] The plaintiffs, however, have raised serious questions\nwhether women and families will be only temporarily disad-\nvantaged. There is no legal obligation binding the BRM to\n\f18428         COMMUNITY HOUSE v. CITY OF BOISE\nconvert its Boise Rescue Mission shelter to serve women and\nfamilies. In fact, the BRM admitted that it may never convert\nits Boise Rescue Mission facility into a shelter for women and\nfamilies. The BRM told the City that:\n\n       If our proposal to own Community House is\n    accepted, we currently contemplate that we would\n    convert the 6th & Front [i.e., Boise Rescue Mission]\n    facility into an emergency homeless shelter for\n    women and children. Because owning Community\n    House is only a possibility, we have not done any\n    planning, feasibility studies or other evaluations.\n    Therefore, we are unable to provide you with any-\n    thing more specific. Those studies may indicate that\n    an emergency shelter for women and children is\n    infeasible at our 6th & Front site. Also, we may dis-\n    cover that the property would better serve the needs\n    of the homeless as a center for another program, or\n    that it would simply be better to abandon and sell the\n    property. We will make those decisions once we\n    know whether or not, and on what terms, we will be\n    able to own Community House.\n\n   Even if the Boise Rescue Mission is converted into a shel-\nter for women and families, because the plaintiffs have raised\nserious questions as to the City’s safety justification for the\ndiscriminatory treatment, there is a serious question that shel-\ntering women and families at Boise Rescue Mission sepa-\nrately from men would benefit women and families by\nsatisfying a required safety need. Further, even if the conver-\nsion were to occur, women and families could still be disad-\nvantaged by the men-only policy at Community House,\nbecause shelter there could be more desirable than shelter at\nthe Boise Rescue Mission. In this regard, Community House,\nwhich is owned by the City, must comply with the Establish-\nment Clause while the Boise Rescue Mission, which is not\nowned by the City, is not so restricted.\n\f               COMMUNITY HOUSE v. CITY OF BOISE             18429\n   [9] Because the City’s men-only policy at Community\nHouse is facially discriminatory regarding women and fami-\nlies, the more stringent test of Johnson Controls applies.\nUnder the Johnson Controls framework, the plaintiffs have\nraised serious questions regarding the merits of the City’s\nproffered justifications for the men-only policy at Community\nHouse. There is no dispute that the balance of hardships tips\nin the plaintiffs’ favor. Accordingly, the district court abused\nits discretion by denying the plaintiffs’ request under the Fair\nHousing Act for a preliminary injunction requiring, at this\nstage of the litigation, reinstatement of Community House\nresidents excluded by the men-only policy.\n\n  2.   Disability Discrimination\n\n   The plaintiffs also argue that the district court erred in hold-\ning that they had not raised serious questions that policies at\nCommunity House discriminate against persons with disabili-\nties. With regard to the disabled, the City’s policies at Com-\nmunity House are not facially discriminatory, and thus the\nMcDonnell Douglas test is appropriate for analyzing those\nclaims. In McDonnell Douglas, the Supreme Court estab-\nlished a three-stage, burden-shifting test for analyzing dispa-\nrate treatment discrimination claims under Title VII. See\nMcDonnell Douglas Corp., 411 U.S. at 802-04. The McDon-\nnell Douglas test has also been applied in the Fair Housing\nAct context. See Gamble, 104 F.3d at 305.\n\n   Under the McDonnell Douglas test, the plaintiffs in this\ncase must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination\nwith regard to their disability discrimination claims. See id.\nTo establish such a prima facie case, the plaintiffs must show\n(1) that they are members of a protected class, (2) that applied\nfor and were qualified for shelter at Community House, (3)\nthat they were rejected, and (4) that openings at the shelter\nremained available. See id. After the plaintiffs have estab-\nlished a prima facie case, the burden then shifts to the defen-\ndants who must articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory\n\f18430          COMMUNITY HOUSE v. CITY OF BOISE\nreason for their action. See id. If the defendants meet their\nburden, the burden then shifts back to the plaintiffs to prove\nby a preponderance of the evidence that the reason asserted by\nthe defendants is a mere pretext. See id.\n\n   [10] Here, the plaintiffs have not raised a prima facie case\nof disparate treatment based on disability. The district court\nfound the limited record showed that both “the former resi-\ndents of Community House that were moved out and the for-\nmer residents of the Boise Rescue Mission who were moved\nin . . . have substantial numbers of disabled individuals in\ntheir ranks.” While there may be a lower percentage of dis-\nabled persons among the new Community House residents,\nthe district court’s factual finding is not clearly erroneous.\nThus, there is no evidence thus far that any plaintiffs were\ntreated differently because of their disability. See 42 U.S.C.\n§ 3604(f)(1)-(2).\n\n   [11] We conclude that the district court did not abuse its\ndiscretion by denying a preliminary injunction regarding the\nplaintiffs’ disability discrimination claims.\n\nC.     Constitutional Claims\n\n   The plaintiffs additionally argue that the district court\nshould have granted a broader preliminary injunction with\nregard to their religious establishment claims because the\nCity’s lease with the BRM violates the Idaho Constitution and\nthe Establishment Clause of the First Amendment of the\nUnited States Constitution. The plaintiffs assert that they have\nraised serious questions regarding whether the lease is uncon-\nstitutional and therefore they are entitled to the preliminary\ninjunction they sought.\n\n  1.    Waiver\n\n   The City argues we should not consider the plaintiffs’ con-\nstitutional claims because they are being raised for the first\ntime on appeal.\n\f               COMMUNITY HOUSE v. CITY OF BOISE            18431\n   “We will review an issue that has been raised for the first\ntime on appeal under certain narrow circumstances . . . [:] (1)\nto prevent a miscarriage of justice; (2) when a change in law\nraises a new issue while an appeal is pending; and (3) when\nthe issue is purely one of law.” Kimes v. Stone, 84 F.3d 1121,\n1126 (9th Cir. 1996) (internal citations omitted). “The deci-\nsion to consider an issue not raised below is discretionary, and\nsuch an issue should not be decided if it would prejudice the\nother party.” Id.\n\n   [12] We decline to consider the plaintiffs’ Idaho Constitu-\ntion claim raised for the first time in this appeal. Not one of\nthe three narrow circumstances which must exist for us to\nconsider that issue is present in this case. There is no need to\nprevent a miscarriage of justice, there has been no change of\napplicable law, and although the plaintiffs argue that the\nCity’s lease of Community House to the BRM violates two\nprovisions of the Idaho Constitution, Article 1, section 4 and\nArticle 9, section 5, that question is not a pure question of\nlaw. Accordingly, we exercise our discretion not to review the\nplaintiffs’ Idaho Constitution claim.\n\n   We will consider, however, the plaintiffs’ Establishment\nClause claim. The parties dispute whether the Establishment\nClause challenge was raised before the district court. We need\nnot resolve whether this issue was raised before that court\nbecause even if a party fails to raise an issue in the district\ncourt, we generally will not deem the issue waived if the dis-\ntrict court actually considered it. See Harrell v. 20th Century\nIns. Co., 934 F.2d 203, 206 n.1 (9th Cir. 1991). Here, the dis-\ntrict court considered and resolved the Establishment Clause\nissue. Accordingly, we will consider it.\n\n  2.   Establishment Clause\n\n   The plaintiffs argue that the district court abused its discre-\ntion by denying the full extent of their requested preliminary\ninjunction because the City’s lease with the BRM violates the\n\f18432            COMMUNITY HOUSE v. CITY OF BOISE\nEstablishment Clause of the First Amendment of the United\nStates Constitution. The district court only enjoined the City\nfrom leasing Community House to the BRM if the BRM\nrequires attendance at religious meetings as a condition of\nreceiving homeless services. The district court declined to\nmore broadly enjoin the City from participating in a lease\nwith the BRM in which the BRM conducts religious meetings\nin the Community House facility. We hold that the district\ncourt abused its discretion by not granting a broader prelimi-\nnary injunction with regard to the Establishment Clause\nclaim.\n\n      a.   Legal Framework\n\n   The Establishment Clause provides that “Congress shall\nmake no law respecting an establishment of religion.”7 U.S.\nConst. amend. I. When assessing whether government aid to\nreligious organizations violates the Establishment Clause, we\napply the three-pronged test first articulated by the Supreme\nCourt in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602, 612-13 (1972).8\nUnder the Lemon test, government action survives an Estab-\nlishment Clause challenge if it (1) has a secular purpose, (2)\n  7\n     The Establishment Clause applies to the states through the Due Process\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment. See County of Allegheny v. ACLU,\n492 U.S. 573, 588 (1989).\n   8\n     We recognize that Establishment Clause jurisprudence and the role of\nthe Lemon test is uncertain. See, e.g., Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.S. 709,\n727 n.1 (2005) (Thomas, J., concurring) (noting that the Supreme Court\nproperly declined to apply the “discredited” Lemon test to an Establish-\nment Clause challenge); Santa Fe Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Doe, 530 U.S. 290,\n319 (2000) (Rehnquist, C.J., dissenting) (“Lemon has had a checkered\ncareer in the decisional law of this Court.”); see also DeStefano v. Emer-\ngency Hous. Group, Inc., 247 F.3d 397, 405 (2d Cir. 2001) (“In the wake\nof a number of fragmented decisions over the past decade, the governing\n[Establishment Clause] law remains in doubt.”). The Supreme Court, how-\never, has not expressly overruled or discarded the Lemon test. Zelman v.\nSimmons-Harris, 536 U.S. 639, 668-69 (2002) (O’Connor, J., concurring)\n(reaffirming that the Lemon test is still the central tool of analysis in\nEstablishment Clause cases). Accordingly, we continue to apply it here.\n\f                 COMMUNITY HOUSE v. CITY OF BOISE                    18433\nhas a primary effect of neither advancing nor inhibiting reli-\ngion, and (3) does not foster excessive government entangle-\nment with religion. See id. In Agostini v. Felton, 521 U.S.\n203, 222-23, 234 (1997), the Supreme Court refined the\nLemon test by folding the “excessive entanglement” inquiry\ninto, and setting out revised criteria for, the “effect” prong.\nSee Mitchell v. Helms, 530 U.S. 793, 807-08 (2000) (Thomas,\nJ., plurality); see also Mitchell, 530 U.S. at 844-45\n(O’Connor, J., concurring).\n\n   [13] Thus, under the Lemon-Agostini test, we ask (1)\n“whether the government acted with the purpose of advancing\nor inhibiting religion,” and (2) “whether the [governmental]\naid has the ‘effect’ of advancing or inhibiting religion.”9\nAgostini, 521 U.S. at 222-23.\n\n   The Supreme Court has identified three primary criteria for\nevaluating whether that aid has the “effect” of advancing reli-\ngion (i) whether governmental aid results in government\nindoctrination; (ii) whether recipients of the aid are defined by\nreference to religion; and (iii) whether the aid creates exces-\nsive government entanglement with religion. See Agostini,\n521 U.S. at 234; see also Mitchell, 530 U.S. at 808 (Thomas,\nJ., plurality); Mitchell, 530 at 845 (O’Connor, J., concurring).\nThe same primary criteria are considered when determining\nwhether aid constitutes an impermissible “endorsement” of\nreligion. See Agostini, 521 U.S. at 235; Mitchell, 530 U.S. at\n845 (O’Connor, J., concurring).\n\n      b.   District Court’s Decision\n\n   In the present case, the district court applied the Lemon test\n  9\n    As discussed hereafter, it is clear the City’s acts which the plaintiffs\nchallenge were not taken for the purpose of advancing religion, and inhibi-\ntion of religion is not an issue in this case. The question we must answer\nis whether the City’s challenged action in its lease to the BRM constitutes\ngovernmental aid which has the effect of advancing religion.\n\f18434          COMMUNITY HOUSE v. CITY OF BOISE\nand held that only a limited preliminary injunction regarding\nthe City’s lease with the BRM was required to avoid an\nEstablishment Clause violation. Under the first Lemon prong,\nthe district court found that the lease had the secular purpose\nof providing shelter to the homeless. With regard to the sec-\nond Lemon prong, the district court determined that the plain-\ntiffs had raised serious questions about whether the primary\neffect of the lease was secular or religious because there was\nevidence the BRM required an explanation from any home-\nless person who did not want to attend a religious meeting,\nand there was some evidence that the BRM required atten-\ndance at religious meetings as a condition of receiving ser-\nvices. As a result, the district court enjoined the City from\nparticipating in the lease with the BRM if the BRM directly\nor indirectly required residents of Community House to attend\nreligious meetings as a condition of receiving housing or\nother services. With this qualification, the district court found\nthat the primary effect of the lease was secular. The district\ncourt also found that its injunction would remove any exces-\nsive government entanglement with religion, the third Lemon\nprong, and concluded that the lease would not violate the\nEstablishment Clause. On this basis, the district court denied\nthe plaintiffs’ request for a broader preliminary injunction.\nThe district court did not apply the Agostini modification to\nthe Lemon test, nor did it consider Mitchell.\n\n    c.   Application of Legal Framework to this Case\n\n   Applying the Lemon test, as modified by Agostini, we con-\nclude that the district court abused its discretion by denying\na broader preliminary injunction. While the City’s lease of\nCommunity House to the BRM meets the “purpose” prong of\nthe test of Lemon-Agostini, it fails the “effect” prong.\n\n   There is no plausible dispute that the City leased Commu-\nnity House to the BRM for the valid secular purpose of pro-\nviding shelter to the homeless, not to promote religion. The\n\f               COMMUNITY HOUSE v. CITY OF BOISE            18435\nfirst part of the Lemon-Agostini test is therefore not in ques-\ntion and we need not discuss it.\n\n   [14] The issue is whether the City’s lease of Community\nHouse to the BRM has the “effect” of advancing religion\nunder the test of Lemon-Agostini. See Agostini, 521 U.S. at\n223; see also Lemon, 403 U.S. at 612. The plaintiffs assert\nthat the lease has this effect in two ways. First, they argue the\nlease creates excessive government entanglement with reli-\ngion because it requires extensive monitoring of Community\nHouse by the City to ensure that there are no violations of the\ndistrict court’s injunction or the Establishment Clause. Sec-\nond, they argue that the lease results in governmental indoctri-\nnation because it provides the BRM with a publicly financed\nfacility in which to spread its religious message.\n\n   Addressing the plaintiffs’ first argument — excessive\nentanglement due to extensive monitoring — the plaintiffs\nhave not raised serious questions that the lease will exces-\nsively entangle the City with religion. Government oversight\nto ensure that public funding is not used for religious purposes\nis not necessarily excessive entanglement. See KDM v. Reeds-\nport Sch. Dist., 196 F.3d 1046, 1051 (9th Cir. 1999). “Entan-\nglement must be ‘excessive’ before it runs afoul of the Estab-\nlishment Clause.” Agostini, 521 U.S. at 233.\n\n   In Agostini, the Supreme Court held that unannounced\nmonthly visits (monitoring remedial-education public school\nteachers sent to parochial schools) in order to detect or pre-\nvent inculcation of religion did not constitute excessive gov-\nernment entanglement. See id. at 234 (“[W]e have not found\nexcessive entanglement in cases in which States imposed far\nmore onerous burdens on religious institutions than the moni-\ntoring system at issue here.”) (citing Bowen v. Kendrick, 487\nU.S. 589, 615-17 (1988) (finding no excessive entanglement\nwhere government reviewed the programs conceived and\nmaterials used by religious grantees of federal aid and moni-\ntored the recipients’ activities through periodic visits)).\n\f18436           COMMUNITY HOUSE v. CITY OF BOISE\n   At this stage of the litigation, there is insufficient evidence\nthat greater monitoring by the City than that deemed constitu-\ntionally permissible in Agostini would be required. Accord-\ningly, the plaintiffs have not shown that serious questions\nexist regarding excessive entanglement as a result of monitor-\ning by the City.\n\n   We next consider the plaintiffs’ argument that the City’s\nlease of Community House to the BRM results in governmen-\ntal indoctrination of religion. To satisfy this criterion, the\nplaintiffs must show (1) that the BRM’s activities at Commu-\nnity House constitute or result in indoctrination, and (2) that\nsuch indoctrination is attributable to the government. See\nDeStefano, 247 F.3d at 414 (citing Agostini, 521 U.S. at 226).\n\n   “To ‘indoctrinate’ means ‘[t]o instruct in a body of doctrine\nor principles . . . . To imbue with a partisan or ideological\npoint of view . . . .’ The Supreme Court uses ‘indoctrination’\nsynonymously with ‘inculcation.’ To ‘inculcate’ is ‘[t]o\nimpress (something) upon the mind of another by frequent\ninstruction or repetition; [to] instill.’ ” Id. (internal citations\nomitted). The record shows that the BRM conducts a daily\nsixty-minute Christian chapel service at Community House\nbefore dinner. The chapel service consists of singing, scrip-\nture reading, prayer, testimonies, and preaching. It thus\nappears that the BRM is giving instruction in, and imbuing\nthose Community House residents in attendance at the chapel\nservice with, the tenets of Christianity. This is true even\nassuming attendance at the chapel service is voluntary.\n\n   The plaintiffs have thus raised a serious question that the\nBRM’s activities at Community House constitute religious\nindoctrination. The next question is whether such indoctrina-\ntion is attributable to the government. The BRM’s lease of\nCommunity House is publicly financed.10 The City charges\n  10\n    The publicly-financed nature of the City’s lease of Community House\nto the BRM distinguishes it from those cases in which courts have held\n\f                  COMMUNITY HOUSE v. CITY OF BOISE                    18437\nthe BRM rent of $1 per year for five years for a furnished\n34,000 square foot building worth at least $2.5 million. The\nCity has also given the BRM a 20-month option to buy the\nproperty for $2 million, which is $500,000 less than the mini-\nmum value that the City established for the property in July\n2005. Under the lease, the City insures the premises and pays\nfor necessary repairs.\n\n   The City asserts, however, that religious indoctrination can-\nnot be attributed to it because of its neutral treatment of the\nBRM. The City points out that there is no evidence that the\nbid process to lease Community House to the BRM was reli-\ngiously biased. In addition, the City notes that the prior Com-\nmunity House lease with CHI, a secular organization,\nprovided a fifty year term with rent fixed at $1 per year. Thus,\nthe City’s lease with CHI was even more publicly financed\nthan its current lease with the BRM.\n\n  In Mitchell, Justice Thomas, writing for the plurality,\nargued that neutral administration of a government aid pro-\ngram could immunize the state from a charge that disburse-\nment of public funds to religious groups constitutes\ngovernmental indoctrination:\n\n     In distinguishing between indoctrination that is\n     attributable to the State and indoctrination that is not,\n     we have consistently turned to the principle of neu-\n     trality, upholding aid that is offered to a broad range\n     of groups or persons without regard to their religion.\n     If the religious, irreligious, and areligious are all\n\nthat the rental or sale of property to religious organizations did not violate\nthe Establishment Clause because such acts involved the rental or selling\nof property for fair market value in arm’s length business transactions.\nSee, e.g., Mercier v. Fraternal Order of Eagles, 395 F.3d 693, 702 (7th\nCir. 2005); Southside Fair Hous. Comm’n v. City of New York, 928 F.2d\n1336, 1348 (2d Cir. 1991); Christian Sci. Reading Room Jointly Main-\ntained v. City & County of San Francisco, 784 F.2d 1010, 1014 (9th Cir.\n1986).\n\f18438             COMMUNITY HOUSE v. CITY OF BOISE\n       alike eligible for governmental aid, no one would\n       conclude that any indoctrination that any particular\n       recipient conducts has been done at the behest of the\n       government. . . . To put the point differently, if the\n       government, seeking to further some legitimate secu-\n       lar purpose, offers aid on the same terms, without\n       regard to religion, to all who adequately further that\n       purpose, then it is fair to say that any aid going to a\n       religious recipient only has the effect of furthering\n       that secular purpose.\n\nMitchell, 530 U.S. at 809-10 (Thomas, J., plurality) (citation\nomitted).\n\n   However, Justice O’Connor disagreed with the plurality’s\n“near-absolute position with respect to neutrality.” Mitchell,\n530 U.S. at 838 (O’Connor, J., concurring). Importantly, Jus-\ntice O’Connor’s concurrence is the controlling authority given\nthat she concurred in the result on narrower grounds than\nthose on which the plurality rested.11 See Marks v. United\nStates, 430 U.S. 188, 193 (1977) (“When a fragmented Court\ndecides a case and no single rationale explaining the result\nenjoys the assent of five Justices, the holding of the Court\nmay be viewed as that position taken by those Members who\nconcurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds.”) (cita-\ntion omitted); see also Gentala v. City of Tucson, 244 F.3d\n1065, 1076 (9th Cir. 2001) (“We are left . . . with a clear hold-\ning by a Supreme Court majority that when the government\nsubsidizes religious activity, the fact that it is doing so pursu-\nant to a program that treats religious speech or association\ncoequally with other speech is not, standing alone, determina-\n  11\n    Justice Breyer joined Justice O’Connor’s concurrence in Mitchell. The\ndissent, written by Justice Souter and joined by Justices Stevens and Gins-\nburg, also disagreed with the plurality’s “espous[al] of a new conception\nof neutrality as a practically sufficient test of constitutionality.” Id. at 869\n(Souter, J., dissenting). Thus, five Justices in Mitchell explicitly disagreed\nwith the plurality’s discussion on neutrality.\n\f                    COMMUNITY HOUSE v. CITY OF BOISE                   18439\ntive in Establishment Clause analysis.”), rev’d on other\ngrounds, 534 U.S. 946 (2001); DeStefano, 247 F.3d at 418\n(stating that Justice O’Connor’s view in Mitchell is control-\nling); Columbia Union Coll. v. Oliver, 254 F.3d 496, 504, 504\nn.1 (4th Cir. 2001) (same); Simmons-Harris v. Zelman, 234\nF.3d 945, 957 (6th Cir. 2000) (same), rev’d on other grounds,\n536 U.S. 639 (2002).\n\n   In her concurrence in Mitchell, Justice O’Connor did not\ndispute that “neutrality is an important” factor in deciding\nEstablishment Clause aid cases. Mitchell, 530 U.S. at 838\n(O’Connor, J., concurring). However, she noted that “[w]e\nhave never held that a government-aid program passes consti-\ntutional muster solely because of the neutral criteria it\nemploys as a basis for distributing aid.” Id. at 839.\n\n   Justice O’Connor also disagreed with the Mitchell plurali-\nty’s conclusion that actual diversion of government aid to reli-\ngious indoctrination does not indicate an impropriety under\nthe Establishment Clause.12 See id. at 840. In contrast to the\nplurality, she emphasized that “actual diversion of govern-\nment aid to religious indoctrination” is constitutionally sus-\npect and is more central to the Establishment Clause\njurisprudence than neutrality or secular content.13 Id. She\n  12\n    In addition to neutrality, the plurality opinion focused on whether the\ngovernment aid has religious or secular content and dismissed inquiring\ninto whether the aid was diverted for religious purposes:\n       The issue is not divertibility of aid but rather whether the aid\n       itself has an impermissible content. Where the aid would be suit-\n       able for use in a public school, it is also suitable for use in any\n       private school. Similarly, the prohibition against the government\n       providing impermissible content resolves the Establishment\n       Clause concerns that exist if aid is actually diverted to religious\n       uses.\nMitchell, 530 U.S. at 822 (Thomas, J., plurality).\n   13\n      The Mitchell dissent would go further than Justice O’Connor’s\nemphasis on actual diversion and would hold unconstitutional government\naid if there is a substantial risk that it will be diverted to religious uses.\nSee id. at 890 (Souter, J., dissenting) (“[W]e have long held government\naid invalid when circumstances would allow its diversion to religious edu-\ncation.”).\n\f18440          COMMUNITY HOUSE v. CITY OF BOISE\nnoted that although Supreme Court “cases have permitted\nsome government funding of secular functions performed by\nsectarian organizations,” the Court’s decisions “provide no\nprecedent for the use of public funds to finance religious\nactivities.” Id. (citation omitted).\n\n   [15] Thus, Mitchell stands for the proposition that actual\ndiversion of secular government aid to religious indoctrina-\ntion violates the Establishment Clause. See id. at 840-42.\nHere, according to the showing that has been made at this\nstage of the litigation, it appears that the aid from the City\n(i.e., the subsidized Community House facility) is actually\nbeing diverted for Christian chapel services in addition to\nother services for the homeless. Accordingly, under Mitchell,\nthe plaintiffs have raised serious questions that the BRM’s\nreligious indoctrination occurring at Community House is\nattributable to the City.\n\n   Other Supreme Court cases support the conclusion that, to\navoid an Establishment Clause violation, a publicly financed\ngovernment building may not be diverted to religious use. See\nRoemer v. Bd. of Pub. Works, 426 U.S. 736, 760-61 (1976)\n(upholding program of direct state financial aid to private col-\nleges and universities, including religious ones, because there\nwas a statutory prohibition against sectarian use of the funds);\nHunt v. McNair, 413 U.S. 734, 744-45 (1973) (upholding pro-\ngram of state aid to colleges and universities, including reli-\ngious ones, to finance construction because funds were not\nallowed to be used for the construction of religious facilities).\n\n   Indeed, in Tilton v. Richardson, 403 U.S. 672 (1971), the\nSupreme Court overturned a portion of a statute that autho-\nrized federal loans and grants to institutions of higher learning\nthat would have allowed publicly financed buildings to be\nused for religious purposes because that portion of the statute\nviolated the Establishment Clause. While the statute contained\na provision prohibiting the use of the funds to construct facili-\nties for sectarian worship, the provision expired after twenty\n\f               COMMUNITY HOUSE v. CITY OF BOISE            18441\nyears. See id. at 675. Applying the Lemon test, the Court held\nthat if, after expiration of the twenty-year prohibitory period,\nthe benefitted religious institutions used the facilities for sec-\ntarian worship, then the “effect” of the government’s grant\nwould be religious advancement. See id. at 683. The Court\nthus struck down the expiration of the twenty-year limit in\norder to avoid an Establishment Clause violation. See id. at\n689.\n\n   [16] Because the plaintiffs have raised serious questions as\nto whether the BRM’s religious activities at the publicly-\nfinanced Community House facility constitute governmental\nindoctrination of religion, they have established that serious\nquestions exist regarding whether the City’s aid to the BRM\nhas the “effect” of advancing religion. The plaintiffs have,\ntherefore, raised serious questions regarding an Establishment\nClause violation.\n\n   [17] The fact that the plaintiffs have raised “serious First\nAmendment questions compels a finding that there exists ‘the\npotential for irreparable injury, or that at the very least the\nbalance of hardships tips sharply in [the plaintiffs’] favor.’\nSammartano v. First Judicial Dist. Court, 303 F.3d 959, 973\n(9th Cir. 2002) (quoting Viacom Int’l, Inc. v. FCC, 828 F.\nSupp. 741, 744 (N.D. Cal. 1993)). We therefore hold that the\nplaintiffs have demonstrated that the balance of hardships tips\nin their favor. See id. at 974. We conclude that the district\ncourt abused its discretion by denying the plaintiffs’ request\nfor a broader preliminary injunction. The district court should\nhave enjoined the conduct of the chapel services and other\nreligious activities at Community House, even if participation\nin those activities is voluntary.\n\n                    IV.    CONCLUSION\n\n  The district court appropriately applied the McDonnell\nDouglas test to the plaintiffs’ disability discrimination claims\n\f18442          COMMUNITY HOUSE v. CITY OF BOISE\nand we affirm its denial of a preliminary injunction as to those\ncontentions.\n\n   We reverse the district court’s denial of a preliminary\ninjunction, both with regard to the men-only policy at Com-\nmunity House and with regard to the religious activities at\nCommunity House. Because the men-only policy at Commu-\nnity House is facially discriminatory, the district court erred\nin applying the McDonnell Douglas test. Under the facial dis-\ncrimination test of Johnson Controls, the plaintiffs have\nraised serious questions as to whether the City is discriminat-\ning against women and families in violation of the Fair Hous-\ning Act. There is no dispute that the balance of hardships tips\nin favor of the plaintiffs. Accordingly, we reverse the district\ncourt’s denial of the plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary\ninjunction that would require the reinstatement of Community\nHouse residents excluded by the men-only policy.\n\n   The plaintiffs have also raised serious questions as to\nwhether the City’s aid to the BRM by providing it with the\nCommunity House building has the “effect” of advancing reli-\ngion and violates the Establishment Clause. The balance of\nhardships as to this claim tips in the plaintiffs’ favor. We,\ntherefore, reverse the district court’s denial of the plaintiffs’\nrequest for a broader preliminary injunction prohibiting\nchapel services and other religious activities at the Commu-\nnity House facility. Each party shall bear his, her, and its own\ncosts on appeal.\n\n AFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN PART; AND\nREMANDED.\n\n\n\nCALLAHAN, Circuit Judge concurring and dissenting:\n\n  I agree with much of the majority opinion; however, on\n\f                 COMMUNITY HOUSE v. CITY OF BOISE                   18443\nthree important points we part company.1 First, while I agree\nwith the majority that the district court should have applied\nthe test set forth in Int’l Union, United Auto., Aerospace &\nAgric. Implement Workers of Am. v. Johnson Controls, Inc.,\n499 U.S. 187, 200-01 (1991), I read the record as including\nevidence that the temporary dislocation of homeless women\nwas necessary for safety concerns and for the long-term\nincrease in the facilities available to homeless women. Sec-\nond, even if there is some question as to whether the overall\nscheme constituted a “bona fide occupational qualification”\nunder Johnson Controls, id. at 200, the appropriate remedy is\nto vacate the district court’s order and remand for further pro-\nceedings. Third, although the majority correctly identifies the\ncritical issue on appellants’ Establishment Clause claim, its\nconclusion that the Boise Rescue Mission Ministries’ volun-\ntary chapel services constitute religious indoctrination attrib-\nutable to the government is neither factually nor legally\nsound.\n\n                                     I\n\n   My analysis starts with the same factual determination as\nthe majority: the men-only policy at Community House is\nfacially discriminatory because it explicitly treats women and\nfamilies different from men. Furthermore, we agree that the\ndistrict court erred in applying the test set forth in McDonnell\nDouglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802-04 (1973), and\nshould have applied the approach adopted in Johnson Con-\ntrols, 499 U.S. 187. In Johnson Controls, the Supreme Court\nheld that discrimination based on gender was forbidden under\nTitle VII “unless respondent can establish that sex is a ‘bona\nfide occupational qualification.’ ” (“BFOQ”) Id. at 200.\n\n   I also agree with the majority that in examining discrimina-\n  1\n    I concur in the majority’s affirmance of the district court’s denial of\nrelief on appellants’ disability discrimination claims and the decision to\ndecline to consider the appellants’ claim under the Idaho Constitution.\n\f18444           COMMUNITY HOUSE v. CITY OF BOISE\ntion issues under the Fair Housing Act, we have frequently\ndrawn from employment discrimination analysis (see maj. op.\n18421 n.3), and importantly, that we “have not previously\nadopted a standard for determining the propriety or accept-\nability of justifications for facial discrimination under the Fair\nHousing Act.” (maj. op. 18424-25) I appreciate the majority’s\nrecognition of a split between our sister circuits as to the stan-\ndard to be applied for analyzing a defendant’s rationales in\nchallenges under the Fair Housing Act as it applies to claims\nunder the Equal Protection Clause. I do not object to the\nmajority’s adoption of the approach adopted by the Sixth and\nTenth Circuits in requiring that a restriction be based on legit-\nimate public concerns, rather than stereotypes, and benefits\nthe protected class. See Larkin v. Michigan Dep’t of Social\nServs., 89 F.3d 285, 290 (6th Cir. 1996), and Bangerter v.\nOrem City Corp., 46 F.3d 1491, 1503-04 (10th Cir. 1995).\nNonetheless, applying this more exacting test, appellants have\nnot demonstrated that they are entitled to injunctive relief.\n\n   The City proffered two justifications for the men-only pol-\nicy at Community House: (1) safety concerns, and (2) trans-\nferring men to Community House would allow Boise Rescue\nMission Ministries (“BRM”) to convert another one of its\nfacilities into a shelter for women and children. The safety\nconcerns are the type of legitimate interests, not based on ste-\nreotypes, that may satisfy the first prong of the test for allow-\ning a facially discriminatory provision. Indeed, the majority\nrecognizes that safety concerns might justify the men-only\npolicy. (See maj. op. 18427) I would affirm as I agree with the\ndistrict court that “the record contains evidence supporting the\nsafety problems inherent in housing homeless men with\nhomeless women.” Moreover, even if I were to determine that\nsafety concerns were not adequately addressed on this record,\nI would remand the matter to the district court to take addi-\ntional evidence.2\n  2\n    The district court noted that Community House contained both a home-\nless shelter and a low-cost housing unit. The homeless shelter could hold\n\f                 COMMUNITY HOUSE v. CITY OF BOISE                    18445\n   The City addressed the second prong of the test by offering\nevidence that the men-only policy at Community House was\nonly a temporary disadvantage necessary to allow the conver-\nsion of the nearby Boise Rescue Mission into increased shel-\nter space for women and children. In Bangerter, the Tenth\nCircuit observed that “courts have uniformly allowed defen-\ndants to justify their conduct despite the discriminatory\nimpact if they can prove that they ‘furthered, in theory and in\npractice, a legitimate, bona fide governmental interest and that\nno alternative would serve that interest with less discrimina-\ntory effect’ ” and noted that a similar approach had been sug-\ngested for certain intentional discrimination claims under the\nFair Housing Act. 46 F.3d at 1504-05 (internal citations omit-\nted).\n\n   Here, the district court held:\n\n     It appears to the court that with the lease, the city\n     seized the opportunity to (1) turn over operations of\n     Community House to an expert; (2) immediately\n     increase the space for homeless men; and (3) eventu-\n     ally increase the space for homeless women and chil-\n     dren. In other words, the City made the political\n     decision to trade short-term hardship for long-term\n     gain.\n\n     If the Court were to intervene, it would simply trans-\n     fer the hardship from one class of homeless women\n     to another. By ordering the return of former female\n     residents to Community House, the Court would\n     scuttle any deal for increased space at the Boise Res-\n\nin separate dorms, 66 men and 13 women. There were ten units for home-\nless families and another ten units for low income, or “transitional,” hous-\ning as well as 39 single-residence apartments. Community House had\naccommodations for the disabled, and about three-fourths of its residents\nwere disabled. This mix of homeless single adults, families with children,\nand the disabled (mentally and physically) would appear to be a volatile\nmix.\n\f18446           COMMUNITY HOUSE v. CITY OF BOISE\n      cue Mission and shift the hardship to the women\n      who would have occupied that space.\n\n      This case is about scarce resources, not discrimina-\n      tion.\n\nI would hold that the district court’s reasoning supports a\ndetermination that the men-only policy at the Community\nHouse was in effect a “BFOQ” intended to result in additional\nand better shelters for women and children.3 We should not be\nso shortsighted as to not recognize that improving the housing\nfor certain groups of people may require some short-term dis-\nadvantages.\n\n   It is not clear whether the majority disagrees with the prop-\nosition that the long-term benefits may justify short-term dis-\nadvantages. It seems to question the factual premise of the\ndistrict court’s determination, rather than its legal analysis.\nThe majority cites BRM’s reticence, prior to the approval of\nits bid for Community House, to commit to the conversion of\nthe Boise Rescue Mission. The district court, however, found\nthat “BRM made that commitment in its proposal to the City,\nand there is no evidence that the BRM intends not to honor\nits commitment.”\n\n  I would hold that although the district court erred in apply-\ning the McDonnell Douglas standard instead of the Johnson\nControls approach, the error was harmless because the City\npresented evidence that fairly supports the district court’s\ndetermination that the men-only policy was part of a program\ndesigned to increase the homeless shelter available to women\nand children, and this determination is entitled to deference.\nNat’l Wildlife Federation v. Nat’l Marine Fisheries Serv., 422\n  3\n    I recognize that while the concept of a “BFOQ” may be borrowed from\nemployment discrimination cases, the exact contours of a bona fide gov-\nernment interest in litigation under the Fair Housing Act may have to be\naltered to reflect certain differences between housing and employment.\n\f               COMMUNITY HOUSE v. CITY OF BOISE            18447\nF.3d 782, 793 (9th Cir. 2005) (“A district court’s order with\nrespect to preliminary injunctive relief is subject to limited\nappellate review, and we will reverse only if the district court\nabused its discretion or based its decision on an erroneous\nlegal standard or on clearly erroneous findings of fact.” (inter-\nnal quotation marks and citation omitted)).\n\n                               II\n\n   Moreover, if the district court’s error is not harmless, the\nproper remedy is not the issuance of injunctive relief, but the\nvacation of the district court’s denial of the preliminary\ninjunction and a remand to allow the district court to develop\nthe underlying facts and to apply circuit law as articulated in\nthis opinion. In the penultimate paragraph in its opinion in\nBangerter, the Tenth Circuit wrote:\n\n    These courts all recognize the importance of leaving\n    room for flexible solutions to address the complex\n    problem of discrimination and to realize the goals\n    established by Congress in the Fair Housing Act.\n    However, once again, such an analysis cannot be\n    performed on the pleadings alone.\n\n    ...\n\n    It could be that the evidence will show that such a\n    neighborhood advisory committee might prove to be\n    beneficial to the handicapped, increasing their access\n    to, and acceptability in, the neighborhood. Only after\n    a record has been developed can the district court,\n    and ultimately our Court, determine whether these\n    restrictions violate the FHAA.\n\n46 F.3d at 1505 (footnotes omitted). These concerns recom-\nmend that we stay our hand and remand this case to allow for\nfurther development of the evidence.\n\f18448          COMMUNITY HOUSE v. CITY OF BOISE\n   The majority, however, charges into the fray, despite recog-\nnizing that the applicable law and relevant facts are less than\nclear, and without citing any authority for its activism. Indeed,\nthe single case cited by the majority for the “requirements for\na preliminary injunction,” Warsoldier v. Woodford, 418 F.3d\n989 (9th Cir. 2005), concludes by reversing and remanding\n“for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.”\nId. at 1002. In light of the majority’s enunciation of a standard\nthat admittedly was not clear when the district court acted and\nthe inevitable effects of the passage of time, the proper form\nof relief — were relief warranted — is a vacation of the dis-\ntrict court’s denial of injunctive relief and a remand for fur-\nther proceedings consistent with this court’s opinion.\n\n                               III\n\n   Again, I start at the same place as the majority on appel-\nlants’ Establishment Clause claim, but cannot agree that\nappellants have demonstrated that they are entitled to affirma-\ntive action from this court or the district court. We agree that\nthe appropriate test is that set forth in Lemon v. Kurtzman,\n403 U.S. 602, 612-23 (1971), and modified by Agostini v.\nFelton, 521 U.S. 203, 222-23, 234 (1997). See also Mitchell\nv. Helms, 530 U.S. 793, 807-08 (2000) (Thomas, J., plurality)\nand Mitchell, 530 U.S. at 844-45 (O’Connor, J., concurring).\n\n  As noted by Justice O’Connor in her concurring opinion in\nMitchell, following Agostini, the Court has\n\n    articulated three primary criteria to guide the deter-\n    mination whether a government-aid program imper-\n    missibly advances religion: (1) whether the aid\n    results in governmental indoctrination, (2) whether\n    the aid program defines its recipients by reference to\n    religion, and (3) whether the aid creates an excessive\n    entanglement between government and religion.\n\n530 U.S. at 845. Here, we agree that the appellants have not\nshown that serious questions exist regarding excessive entan-\n\f              COMMUNITY HOUSE v. CITY OF BOISE            18449\nglement (see maj. op 18436), and it appears that neither the\nCity in its lease, nor the BRM in managing the shelter, “de-\nfines the recipients by reference to religion.” Thus, for there\nto be any violation of the Establishment Clause there must be\n“governmental indoctrination.”\n\n   The majority reasons that “governmental indoctrination”\nhas two components: (1) that BRM’s activities at Community\nHouse constitute or result in indoctrination, and (2) that such\nindoctrination is attributable to the government. (See maj. op.\n18436, citing DeStefano v. Emergency Hous. Group, Inc., 247\nF.3d 397, 414 (2d Cir. 2001)). For the purposes of this dis-\nsent, I accept the majority’s determination that BRM’s hold-\ning of chapel services constitutes “indoctrination.” The\nmajority, however, fails to appreciate the Supreme Court’s\nopinions in Agostini and Mitchell when it concludes that this\n“indoctrination” is attributable to the City.\n\n   The majority’s conclusion is based on its finding that “it\nappears that the aid from the City (i.e. the Community House\nfacility) is actually being diverted for Christian chapel ser-\nvices in addition to other services for the homeless.” (maj. op.\n18440) This finding is factually suspect and employs disap-\nproved legal analysis.\n\n   On the existing record, it is questionable whether there is\nany “aid” flowing from the city to the BRM. What is known\nis that the BRM pays the City a dollar a year. The BRM has\na five-year lease, and the City insures the premises and pays\nfor necessary repairs. The majority also notes that the BRM\nhas a 20-month option to buy the property for two million\ndollars, which is $500,000 less than the minimum value that\nthe City established for the property in July 2005. But, there\nis no suggestion that the BRM’s bid was not the best bid that\nthe City received. Also, as the majority notes, the City’s prior\nlease with a secular organization was even more favorable to\nthe lessee. Furthermore, it appears that Community House\nwas constructed with federal funds and that this restricts what\n\f18450          COMMUNITY HOUSE v. CITY OF BOISE\nthe City can do with Community House. In addition, the\nrecord reflects that the BRM is a Christian non-profit organi-\nzation that serves the homeless population in Boise. There is\nnothing in the record to suggest that the lease of Community\nHouse somehow enriches the BRM. Rather, it appears that the\nlease allows the BRM to provide homeless shelters that other-\nwise would have to be furnished (and paid for) by the City or\nsimply would not exist. Perhaps a record could be developed\nto show that the lease constitutes “aid” from the City to the\nBRM, but the present record neither compels, nor supports,\nsuch a factual determination.\n\n   The majority’s conclusion is also based on a concept of\ndiversion that was strongly rejected in Mitchell both by Jus-\ntice Thomas in his plurality opinion and by Justice O’Connor\nin her concurring opinion. The majority’s reasoning appears\nto be that whatever “aid” flows from the City to the BRM by\nway of the lease is “diverted” from the secular purpose of the\nlease — providing shelter — to the religious purpose of hold-\ning non-mandatory chapel services. This is out of step with\nthe plurality and concurring opinions in Mitchell.\n\n   The situation at bar does not constitute governmental\nindoctrination under Justice Thomas’s plurality opinion in\nMitchell. Although Mitchell concerned a distinct issue, aid to\nprivate religious schools, the impact of the plurality’s position\non this case is clear. Justice Thomas wrote:\n\n    In distinguishing between indoctrination that is\n    attributable to the State and indoctrination that is not,\n    we have consistently turned to the principle of neu-\n    trality, upholding aid that is offered to a broad range\n    of groups or persons without regard to their religion.\n    If the religious, irreligious, and areligious are all\n    alike eligible for governmental aid, no one would\n    conclude that any indoctrination that any particular\n    recipient conducts has been done at the behest of the\n    government. For attribution of indoctrination is a rel-\n\f                   COMMUNITY HOUSE v. CITY OF BOISE                   18451\n       ative question. If the government is offering assis-\n       tance to recipients who provide, so to speak, a broad\n       range of indoctrination, the government itself is not\n       thought responsible for any particular indoctrination.\n\n530 U.S. at 809-10. In our case, the City, pursuant to a request\nfor proposals, determined that the BRM could best meet its\nsecular purpose of providing shelter to the homeless. Under\nthe plurality’s approach, the incidental holding of voluntary\nchapel services for the homeless does not rise to the level of\ngovernmental indoctrination. Justice Thomas recognized that\nthe aid in issue in Mitchell could indirectly benefit the religion\nthat operated the school, but held that this could not reason-\nably be viewed as an endorsement of religion.4 Id. at 835. Jus-\ntice Thomas’s plurality opinion should be read in conjunction\nwith Justice O’Connor’s concurring opinion. The majority\nhere focuses on Justice O’Connor’s statement that the Court\nhas “never held that a government-aid program passes consti-\ntutional muster solely because of the neutral criteria it\nemploys as a basis for distributing aid.” Mitchell, 530 U.S. at\n839 (emphasis in original), and her objection to the “actual\ndiversion of government aid to religious indoctrination.” (maj.\nop. 18439) This misses the critical distinction between Justice\n  4\n   Justice Thomas explained:\n      A concern for divertibility, as opposed to improper content, is\n      misplaced not only because it fails to explain why the sort of aid\n      that we have allowed is permissible, but also because it is bound-\n      less — enveloping all aid, no matter how trivial — and thus has\n      only the most attenuated (if any) link to any realistic concern for\n      preventing an “establishment of religion.” Presumably, for exam-\n      ple, government-provided lecterns, chalk, crayons, pens, paper,\n      and paintbrushes would have to be excluded from religious\n      schools under respondents’ proposed rule. But we fail to see how\n      indoctrination by means of (i.e., diversion of) such aid could be\n      attributed to the government.\nId. at 824. Similarly, in this case, it is doubtful whether — as a matter of\nlaw — the supposed diversion of “aid” to the BRM’s chapel services\ncould be attributed to the City.\n\f18452              COMMUNITY HOUSE v. CITY OF BOISE\nO’Connor’s concurring opinion and Justice Souter’s dissent.\nJustice O’Connor, joined by Justice Breyer, held that the aid\nin issue in Mitchell did not result in governmental indoctrina-\ntion, even though it obviously had some indirect benefit to the\nreligion that ran the school. Similarly, even assuming that\nsome aid flows from the City to the BRM, under Justice\nO’Connor’s concurring opinion in Mitchell, this does not\namount to government indoctrination.\n\n   Justice O’Connor observed that in recent years the Court\n“had taken a more forgiving view of neutral government pro-\ngrams that make aid available generally without regard to the\nreligious or nonreligious character of the recipient.” Mitchell,\n530 U.S. at 847, citing Agostini, 521 U.S. at 225-26. In addi-\ntion, she, like the plurality, recognized that almost any aid\ncould be diverted.5 To meet these realities, Justice O’Connor\n  5\n   Justice O’Connor observed:\n      An educator can use virtually any instructional tool, whether it\n      has ascertainable content or not, to teach a religious message. In\n      this respect, I agree with the plurality that “it is hard to imagine\n      any book that could not, in even moderately skilled hands, serve\n      to illustrate a religious message.” Ante, at 2549. In today’s case,\n      for example, we are asked to draw a constitutional distinction\n      between lending a textbook and lending a library book. Justice\n      SOUTER’s try at justifying that distinction only demonstrates the\n      absurdity on which such a difference must rest. He states that\n      “[a]lthough library books, like textbooks, have fixed content, reli-\n      gious teachers can assign secular library books for religious cri-\n      tique.” Post, at 2592. Regardless of whether that explanation is\n      even correct (for a student surely could be given a religious\n      assignment in connection with a textbook too), it is hardly a dis-\n      tinction on which constitutional law should turn. Moreover, if the\n      mere ability of a teacher to devise a religious lesson involving the\n      secular aid in question suffices to hold the provision of that aid\n      unconstitutional, it is difficult to discern any limiting principle to\n      the divertibility rule. For example, even a publicly financed lunch\n      would apparently be unconstitutional under a divertibility ratio-\n      nale because religious school officials conceivably could use the\n      lunch to lead the students in a blessing over the bread.\nId. at 855.\n\f                 COMMUNITY HOUSE v. CITY OF BOISE                    18453\nproposed that to “establish a First Amendment violation,\nplaintiffs must prove that the aid in question actually is, or has\nbeen, used for religious purposes.” Id. at 857. However, she\nwould reject any presumption that secular restrictions were\nnot followed. Id. at 859. Justice O’Connor also indicated that\na de minimis diversion would not raise constitutional concerns.6\nId. at 861.\n\n   In our case, any aid flowing from the City to the BRM is\ntruly de minimis. The BRM has agreed to undertake the not\ninconsiderable expense of maintaining a homeless shelter, in\nreturn for the City insuring the premises and paying for neces-\nsary repairs.7 As it does not appear that the BRM receives any\nfunds from the City, there is no possibility of any actual diver-\nsion of money. Accordingly, the majority ventures into the\nrelatively unchartered waters of determining when intangible\nassistance from a governmental entity amounts to “govern-\nmental indoctrination.” I would not embark on this course\nbecause, here, conducting chapel services at which attendance\nis voluntary, in conjunction with generally providing home-\nless services, simply does not rise to a level of constitutional\nconcern.\n\n   Finally, even if it were determined that holding voluntary\nchapel services could amount to government indoctrination,\nthe proper course, as previously explained (see Part II), would\nbe to vacate the district court’s denial of injunctive relief, and\nto remand to allow the parties to present the factual evidence\nnecessary for even a preliminary determination that the\nBRM’s holding of voluntary chapel services might amount to\ngovernment indoctrination.\n  6\n     Justice O’Connor wrote: “[t]he limited evidence amassed by respon-\ndents during 4 years of discovery (which began approximately 15 years\nago) is at best de minimis and therefore insufficient to affect the constitu-\ntional inquiry.” Id. at 861.\n   7\n     The City may well have these obligations regardless of the identity of\nthe lessee, or whether the building is leased.\n\f18454          COMMUNITY HOUSE v. CITY OF BOISE\n                               IV\n\n   In sum, I would affirm the district court’s denial of a pre-\nliminary injunction. Although the district court erred in failing\nto apply the test set forth in Johnson Controls, 499 U.S. at\n200-01, this was harmless error because the record shows that\nthe City offered two bona fide government interests to sustain\nthe lease. In addition, this record contains no showing of the\n“governmental indoctrination” necessary for judicial relief\nfrom an alleged violation of the Establishment Clause under\nthe Supreme Court’s opinions in Agostini, 521 U.S. 203, and\nMitchell, 530 U.S. 793. Lastly, even if the district court had\nerred in denying the appellants preliminary relief, the proper\nremedy would be a remand for further proceedings consistent\nwith our opinion.\n\f",

(“CHI”),\nMarlene K. Smith, Greg A. Luther, and Jay D. Banta (collec-\ntively, “plaintiffs”) appeal the district court’s partial denial of\ntheir motion for a preliminary injunction against the\ndefendants-appellees City of Boise, Idaho, its mayor, its city\ncouncil members, and two of its employees.\n\n  The City of Boise owned a homeless shelter, Community\nHouse, which was managed by CHI and provided housing to\nmen, women, and families. In 2004, the City assumed man-\nagement of Community House and then leased it to the Boise\nRescue Mission Ministries (“BRM”), a Christian non-profit\norganization. The women and families were removed from\nCommunity House, and the BRM now provides shelter there\nonly to homeless men. The BRM also includes a religious\ncomponent in the services it provides.\n\n   The district court declined to order reinstatement of resi-\ndents that had been removed from Community House, but\nenjoined the practice of requiring residents to attend worship\nservices in order to receive other services. The court did not\npreclude the use of Community House by the BRM for\nvoluntarily-attended religious programs.\n\n   The plaintiffs assert that the district court abused its discre-\ntion by denying a preliminary injunction that (1) would have\n\f               COMMUNITY HOUSE v. CITY OF BOISE            18417\nreinstated Community House residents excluded by the men-\nonly policy, and (2) would have voided the City’s lease with\nthe BRM. The plaintiffs argue that the men-only policy vio-\nlates the Fair Housing Act, and that the lease with the BRM\nviolates the Idaho Constitution and the Establishment Clause\nof the United States Constitution.\n\n   We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1). With\nregard to the plaintiffs’ Fair Housing Act claims based on sex\nand familial discrimination, we reverse the district court’s\ndenial of a preliminary injunction that would have required\nreinstatement of all former residents.

We conclude that the district court abused its dis-\ncretion by determining that only a limited injunction was nec-\nessary to avoid an Establishment Clause violation. A broader\npreliminary injunction is required.\n\n   With regard to the plaintiffs’ Idaho Constitution claim,\nwhich they have raised for the first time in this appeal, for the\nreasons hereafter set forth we exercise our discretion and\ndecline to consider it.\n\n                    I.   BACKGROUND\n\n   CHI is a non-profit corporation that provides housing ser-\nvices to homeless and low income persons. Beginning in\n1994, CHI and the City worked together to build a homeless\nshelter known as Community House. Community House con-\ntained both a homeless shelter and a low income housing unit.\nThe homeless shelter could hold, in separate dormitories,\n\f18418         COMMUNITY HOUSE v. CITY OF BOISE\nsixty-six men, thirteen women, and ten families. The low\nincome, or “transitional,” housing contained ten family units\nand thirty-nine single-resident apartments. Community House\ncould accommodate the disabled, and about seventy-five per-\ncent of its residents were disabled.\n\n   In 2004, following a dispute with CHI, the City took over\noperation of Community House. The City then initiated a\nRequest for Proposal bid process for the operation of Commu-\nnity House, and ultimately chose the bid of the BRM. The\nCity leased Community House to the BRM on September 2,\n2005.\n\n   The BRM is a Christian non-profit organization that has\nserved the homeless population of Boise, Idaho for almost\nfifty years, most recently at four facilities in both Boise and\nNampa, Idaho. The BRM’s Boise facilities include a homeless\nshelter for single men known as the Boise Rescue Mission,\nand a shelter for women and children known as the City Light\nHome.\n\n   The BRM’s winning bid proposal contained a plan to move\nhomeless men from the Boise Rescue Mission to the Commu-\nnity House facility, and then turn the Boise Rescue Mission\ninto a shelter for homeless women and children. The BRM’s\npolicy is to segregate men and women into different facilities,\nand to segregate homeless singles from homeless families. It\nbelieves that the difficulties of serving the homeless popula-\ntion “are exacerbated in a mixed gender shelter environment.”\n\n   The chief goal of the BRM is to “help people at their physi-\ncal and spiritual points of need” by providing, among other\nassistance, “Christian teaching.” Before dinner, the BRM\noffers a sixty-minute Christian chapel service. The service\nconsists of singing, scripture reading, prayer, testimonies, and\npreaching.\n\n   In June of 2005, before its lease to the BRM commenced,\nthe City told staff members at Community House not to\n\f                 COMMUNITY HOUSE v. CITY OF BOISE                    18419\naccept any new residents. In August of 2005, in anticipation\nof the September 2005 transition to the BRM, the City\ninformed residents of Community House that they needed to\nmove. This move caused significant hardship for some resi-\ndents, most notably women, families, and the physically dis-\nabled. There was already a shortage of housing in the area,\nand these persons, for the most part, had to move into much\nless desirable housing than Community House.\n\n   The plaintiffs filed this action under the Fair Housing Act1\nand other laws. The plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction\nto prevent the removal of residents from Community House,\nto reinstate former residents, and to prevent the sale or lease\nof Community House during the pendency of this action. On\nOctober 28, 2005, the district court granted the plaintiffs’\nmotion in part, enjoining the City from relocating any former\nresident of Community House to housing that is near the resi-\ndence of a registered sex offender. The district court also\nenjoined the City from participating in a lease with the BRM\nif the BRM continued to require attendance at religious meet-\nings as a condition of receiving services. Neither party has\nchallenged these orders.\n\n   The district court denied the plaintiffs’ request for an\ninjunction requiring that former residents of Community\nHouse excluded by the men-only policy be allowed to return.\nThe court determined that the plaintiffs had not raised serious\nquestions that the City was discriminating against women,\nfamilies, or the disabled under the Fair Housing Act. The dis-\ntrict court further denied the plaintiffs’ request for a broader\ninjunction regarding the BRM’s religious activities at Com-\nmunity House, determining that the court’s more limited\n  1\n    Under the Fair Housing Act, it is unlawful to “make unavailable . . .\na dwelling to any person because of race, color, religion, sex, familial sta-\ntus, or national origin.” 42 U.S.C. § 3604(a). It is also unlawful to “make\nunavailable . . . a dwelling . . . because of a handicap.” 42 U.S.C.\n§ 3604(f)(1).\n\f18420          COMMUNITY HOUSE v. CITY OF BOISE\ninjunction removed any Establishment Clause violation. This\nappeal followed.\n\n              II.   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n   Our review of a district court’s decision regarding a prelim-\ninary injunction is “limited and deferential.” Sw. Voter Regis-\ntration Educ. Project v.

DISCUSSION\n\nA.   Requirements for a Preliminary Injunction\n\n   To obtain a preliminary injunction, the moving party must\nshow either (1) a likelihood of success on the merits and the\npossibility of irreparable injury, or (2) the existence of serious\nquestions going to the merits and the balance of hardships tip-\nping in the moving party’s favor. See Warsoldier v. Wood-\nford, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"791432\"><a href=\"/opinion/791432/billy-soza-warsoldier-v-jeanne-woodford-director-of-the-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">989</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 993-94 (9th Cir. 2005). “These two\nalternatives represent extremes of a single continuum, rather\nthan two separate tests.” Id. at 994 (citation omitted).\n\nB.   Fair Housing Act Claims\n\n   The plaintiffs argue that the district court abused its discre-\ntion by denying the full preliminary injunction they sought.\n\f                 COMMUNITY HOUSE v. CITY OF BOISE                   18421\nThey contend they have shown that serious questions exist on\nthe merits regarding whether the City, in its lease with the\nBRM, is discriminating against women, families, and the dis-\nabled at Community House in violation of the Fair Housing\nAct.2\n\n   It is undisputed that the balance of hardships tips in favor\nof the plaintiffs who were excluded from Community House\ndue to the men-only policy. As to the Fair Housing Act\nclaims, therefore, the issue is whether the plaintiffs have\nraised serious questions that the policies at Community\nHouse, which the City authorizes, constitute gender, familial,\nor disability discrimination in violation of the Fair Housing\nAct.\n\n  1.    Gender and Familial Discrimination\n\n   The plaintiffs assert that the district court erred in applying\nthe McDonnell Douglas test to their gender and familial dis-\ncrimination claims because the men-only policy at Commu-\nnity House is facially discriminatory. We agree.\n\n  [1] A facially discriminatory policy is one which on its face\napplies less favorably to a protected group.3 See Frank v.\nUnited Airlines, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"769199\"><a href=\"/opinion/769199/leslie-frank-pat-parnell-susan-broderick-carole-kirk-nichkol-melanson/\"><span class=\"volume\">216</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">845</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 854 (9th Cir. 2000); see\n  2\n     We have previously applied the Fair Housing Act to homeless shelters.\nSee Turning Point v.

CITY OF BOISE\nalso Bangerter, 46 F.3d at 1500 (holding that an ordinance\nthat singled out the handicapped and applied different rules to\nthem was facially discriminatory). The men-only policy at\nCommunity House is facially discriminatory because it\nexplicitly treats women and families different from men. See\nInt’l Union, United Auto., Aerospace & Agric. Implement\nWorkers of Am. v. Johnson Controls, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112563\"><a href=\"/opinion/112563/automobile-workers-v-johnson-controls-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">187</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 197\n(1991). City documents and policy endorse this discrimina-\ntion.\n\n   While the lease between the City and the BRM provides\nthat the BRM shall operate “an emergency homeless shelter\nwith a capacity to serve not fewer than sixty-six (66) guests,”\nCity Ordinance No. 6404 provides that Community House be\noperated as “a shelter for a minimum of 66, single, homeless,\nmen, ages 18 years or older.” (emphasis added). City Resolu-\ntion No. 18765, approving the lease of Community House to\nthe BRM, specifically incorporates the restrictions of City\nOrdinance No. 6404.\n\n   More importantly, regardless of the language of the City’s\nlease with the BRM, the City does not dispute that the current\npolicy is to run Community House as a men-only shelter. The\ndistrict court found that “[i]t is undeniable . . . that the City\ntreated women differently than men” because “the men could\nreapply to be readmitted [to Community House] by [the]\nBRM, while the women were shut out by the men-only poli-\ncy.”\n\n   [2] We hold, contrary to the district court, that the plain-\ntiffs’ gender and familial discrimination claims are properly\ncharacterized as claims of facial discrimination and should be\nanalyzed in that framework. The McDonnell Douglas test is\ninapplicable to Fair Housing Act challenges to a facially dis-\ncriminatory policy. See Bangerter, 46 F.3d at 1501 n.16\n(“There is no need to probe for a potentially discriminatory\nmotive circumstantially, or to apply the burden-shifting\napproach outlined in McDonnell Douglas . . . as the statute\n\f               COMMUNITY HOUSE v.

Instead, the\nSupreme Court’s decision in Johnson Controls, 499 U.S. at\n200-01, provides the appropriate approach in facial discrimi-\nnation cases such as this.\n\n   In Johnson Controls, the Supreme Court held that an\nemployer’s policy barring all women, except those whose\ninfertility was medically documented, from jobs involving\nlead exposure constituted sex discrimination forbidden under\nTitle VII. See id. at 211. The Supreme Court held that the\nemployer’s policy was facially discriminatory because it\nexplicitly discriminated against women on the basis of their\nsex. See id. at 197. The Supreme Court noted that this conclu-\nsion was not undermined by the ostensibly benign purpose of\nthe employer’s policy (protecting women’s unconceived off-\nspring). See id. at 199 (“[T]he absence of a malevolent motive\ndoes not convert a facially discriminatory policy into a neutral\npolicy with a discriminatory effect. Whether an employment\npractice involves disparate treatment through explicit facial\ndiscrimination does not depend on why the employer discrim-\ninates but rather on the explicit terms of the discrimination.”).\n\n   Because the employer’s policy in Johnson Controls was\nfacially discriminatory, the Supreme Court concluded that the\nappropriate test was whether sex was a “bona fide occupa-\ntional qualification” (“BFOQ”). See id. at 200; see also 42\nU.S.C. § 2000e-2(e)(1) (Under Title VII, an employer may\ndiscriminate on the basis of “religion, sex, or national origin\nin those certain instances where religion, sex, or national ori-\ngin is a bona fide occupational qualification [BFOQ] reason-\nably necessary to the normal operation of that particular\nbusiness or enterprise.”). The Supreme Court held that the\nemployer’s policy was not within the safety exceptions of the\n\f18424            COMMUNITY HOUSE v. CITY OF BOISE\nBFOQ defense. See id. at 204-06. As a result, the Supreme\nCourt concluded that the employer’s facially discriminatory\npolicy violated Title VII. See id. at 211.\n\n   [3] With regard to facially discriminatory housing policies,\nunder the Johnson Controls approach, “a plaintiff makes out\na prima facie case of intentional discrimination under the\n[Fair Housing Act] merely by showing that a protected group\nhas been subjected to explicitly differential — i.e. discrimina-\ntory — treatment.” Bangerter, 46 F.3d at 1501. Here, the\nplaintiffs have established a prima facie case of facial dis-\ncrimination under the Fair Housing Act because they have\nexplicitly been excluded from Community House based on\ntheir gender and familial status.\n\n   [4] As in the employment context, however, this does not\nmean that intentional differential treatment can never be justi-\nfied under the Fair Housing Act. See id. at 1501 n.17 (“This\nis not to say that a government can never justify any inten-\ntional differential treatment of the handicapped [under the\nFair Housing Act]. Some differential treatment may be objec-\ntively legitimate. In the Title VII context, for example,\nfacially discriminatory treatment is permitted if it represents\na . . .

The Sixth and Tenth\nCircuits employ a more searching method of analysis.

CITY OF BOISE\n   Having determined the appropriate scrutiny to apply for\ndetermining whether the City’s facial discrimination under the\nFair Housing Act is permissible, we now evaluate the City’s\nproffered justifications for the men-only policy at Community\nHouse. The City asserts two justifications for the discrimina-\ntory policy: (1) safety concerns and (2) the policy allows the\nBRM to transfer homeless men from its Boise Rescue Mis-\nsion shelter to Community House, so that it can convert the\nBoise Rescue Mission into a shelter for women and children.6\nWe conclude that the plaintiffs have raised serious questions\nas to whether these asserted justifications satisfy the standards\nfor permissible discrimination under the Fair Housing Act.\n\n   The City provides little support to establish that the men-\nonly policy benefits women and families by protecting their\nsafety. The City’s only evidence regarding safety concerns is\nan affidavit from Bill Roscoe, the BRM’s Executive Director.\nRoscoe states that “[a]s a person with nearly 20 years of expe-\nrience serving the homeless, it is my opinion that mixing dis-\nparate populations in the same sleeping facility unnecessarily\nfosters conflicts.” He also states that:\n\n      The problems [of serving the homeless] are exacer-\n      bated in a mixed gender shelter environment. Fur-\n      ther, it is not always appropriate to have families,\n      particularly families with young or vulnerable chil-\n      dren, to sleep in the same facility as other members\n      of the homeless population. We believe that our sep-\n      arate shelter facilities for men and women is one of\n      the reasons why we have fewer police calls at our\n      facilities than Community House. For example, in\n      2004, all five of Rescue Mission’s facilities com-\n      bined had less than one-half of the police calls of\n      Community House.\n  6\n    Depending on the facility, men or women-only shelters might be justi-\nfied by privacy concerns. The City does not proffer a privacy justification\nbecause Community House provides separate rooms for men, women, and\nfamilies.\n\f               COMMUNITY HOUSE v. CITY OF BOISE            18427\n   [7] Other than Roscoe’s opinion, the City did not submit a\nsingle police report, incident report, or any other documenta-\ntion that supported any safety concerns. The “fewer police\ncalls” at the BRM’s other facilities does not establish that the\nmen-only policy is justified by safety concerns. There could\nhave been fewer police calls due to fewer residents at the\nother facilities. Or, there could have been fewer police calls\ndue to fewer disabled residents at those facilities and therefore\nless need for emergency medical assistance.\n\n   We do not foreclose the possibility that at a later stage in\nthis litigation, the City may be able to provide evidence to\nestablish that its men-only policy is indeed justified by legiti-\nmate safety concerns.

However, at this point in the litigation, the\nplaintiffs have shown that serious questions exist on the mer-\nits as to whether the City’s men-only policy at Community\nHouse is justified by safety concerns.\n\n   The City’s other asserted justification for the men-only pol-\nicy at Community House is that it will allow the BRM to\ntransfer homeless men from its Boise Rescue Mission shelter\nto Community House, so that it can convert the Boise Rescue\nMission into a shelter for women and families. It argues that\nthe men-only policy benefits women and families because\nthey will only be temporarily disadvantaged in order to\nreceive increased shelter space at the nearby Boise Rescue\nMission when its conversion is completed.\n\n  [8] The plaintiffs, however, have raised serious questions\nwhether women and families will be only temporarily disad-\nvantaged. There is no legal obligation binding the BRM to\n\f18428         COMMUNITY HOUSE v. CITY OF BOISE\nconvert its Boise Rescue Mission shelter to serve women and\nfamilies. In fact, the BRM admitted that it may never convert\nits Boise Rescue Mission facility into a shelter for women and\nfamilies. The BRM told the City that:\n\n       If our proposal to own Community House is\n    accepted, we currently contemplate that we would\n    convert the 6th & Front [i.e., Boise Rescue Mission]\n    facility into an emergency homeless shelter for\n    women and children. Because owning Community\n    House is only a possibility, we have not done any\n    planning, feasibility studies or other evaluations.\n    Therefore, we are unable to provide you with any-\n    thing more specific. Those studies may indicate that\n    an emergency shelter for women and children is\n    infeasible at our 6th & Front site. Also, we may dis-\n    cover that the property would better serve the needs\n    of the homeless as a center for another program, or\n    that it would simply be better to abandon and sell the\n    property. We will make those decisions once we\n    know whether or not, and on what terms, we will be\n    able to own Community House.\n\n   Even if the Boise Rescue Mission is converted into a shel-\nter for women and families, because the plaintiffs have raised\nserious questions as to the City’s safety justification for the\ndiscriminatory treatment, there is a serious question that shel-\ntering women and families at Boise Rescue Mission sepa-\nrately from men would benefit women and families by\nsatisfying a required safety need. Further, even if the conver-\nsion were to occur, women and families could still be disad-\nvantaged by the men-only policy at Community House,\nbecause shelter there could be more desirable than shelter at\nthe Boise Rescue Mission. In this regard, Community House,\nwhich is owned by the City, must comply with the Establish-\nment Clause while the Boise Rescue Mission, which is not\nowned by the City, is not so restricted.\n\f               COMMUNITY HOUSE v. CITY OF BOISE             18429\n   [9] Because the City’s men-only policy at Community\nHouse is facially discriminatory regarding women and fami-\nlies, the more stringent test of Johnson Controls applies.\nUnder the Johnson Controls framework, the plaintiffs have\nraised serious questions regarding the merits of the City’s\nproffered justifications for the men-only policy at Community\nHouse. There is no dispute that the balance of hardships tips\nin the plaintiffs’ favor. Accordingly, the district court abused\nits discretion by denying the plaintiffs’ request under the Fair\nHousing Act for a preliminary injunction requiring, at this\nstage of the litigation, reinstatement of Community House\nresidents excluded by the men-only policy.\n\n  2.   Disability Discrimination\n\n   The plaintiffs also argue that the district court erred in hold-\ning that they had not raised serious questions that policies at\nCommunity House discriminate against persons with disabili-\nties. With regard to the disabled, the City’s policies at Com-\nmunity House are not facially discriminatory, and thus the\nMcDonnell Douglas test is appropriate for analyzing those\nclaims. In McDonnell Douglas, the Supreme Court estab-\nlished a three-stage, burden-shifting test for analyzing dispa-\nrate treatment discrimination claims under Title VII. See\nMcDonnell Douglas Corp., 411 U.S. at 802-04. The McDon-\nnell Douglas test has also been applied in the Fair Housing\nAct context. See Gamble, 104 F.3d at 305.\n\n   Under the McDonnell Douglas test, the plaintiffs in this\ncase must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination\nwith regard to their disability discrimination claims. See id.\nTo establish such a prima facie case, the plaintiffs must show\n(1) that they are members of a protected class, (2) that applied\nfor and were qualified for shelter at Community House, (3)\nthat they were rejected, and (4) that openings at the shelter\nremained available. See id. After the plaintiffs have estab-\nlished a prima facie case, the burden then shifts to the defen-\ndants who must articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory\n\f18430          COMMUNITY HOUSE v. CITY OF BOISE\nreason for their action. See id. If the defendants meet their\nburden, the burden then shifts back to the plaintiffs to prove\nby a preponderance of the evidence that the reason asserted by\nthe defendants is a mere pretext. See id.\n\n   [10] Here, the plaintiffs have not raised a prima facie case\nof disparate treatment based on disability. The district court\nfound the limited record showed that both “the former resi-\ndents of Community House that were moved out and the for-\nmer residents of the Boise Rescue Mission who were moved\nin . . . have substantial numbers of disabled individuals in\ntheir ranks.” While there may be a lower percentage of dis-\nabled persons among the new Community House residents,\nthe district court’s factual finding is not clearly erroneous.\nThus, there is no evidence thus far that any plaintiffs were\ntreated differently because of their disability. See 42 U.S.C.\n§ 3604(f)(1)-(2).\n\n   [11] We conclude that the district court did not abuse its\ndiscretion by denying a preliminary injunction regarding the\nplaintiffs’ disability discrimination claims.\n\nC.     Constitutional Claims\n\n   The plaintiffs additionally argue that the district court\nshould have granted a broader preliminary injunction with\nregard to their religious establishment claims because the\nCity’s lease with the BRM violates the Idaho Constitution and\nthe Establishment Clause of the First Amendment of the\nUnited States Constitution. The plaintiffs assert that they have\nraised serious questions regarding whether the lease is uncon-\nstitutional and therefore they are entitled to the preliminary\ninjunction they sought.\n\n  1.    Waiver\n\n   The City argues we should not consider the plaintiffs’ con-\nstitutional claims because they are being raised for the first\ntime on appeal.\n\f               COMMUNITY HOUSE v. CITY OF BOISE            18431\n   “We will review an issue that has been raised for the first\ntime on appeal under certain narrow circumstances . . . [:] (1)\nto prevent a miscarriage of justice; (2) when a change in law\nraises a new issue while an appeal is pending; and (3) when\nthe issue is purely one of law.” Kimes v. Stone, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"718680\"><a href=\"/opinion/718680/w-michael-kimes-j-colette-boykin-v-peter-g-stone-judge-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">84</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1121</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n1126 (9th Cir. 1996) (internal citations omitted). “The deci-\nsion to consider an issue not raised below is discretionary, and\nsuch an issue should not be decided if it would prejudice the\nother party.” Id.\n\n   [12] We decline to consider the plaintiffs’ Idaho Constitu-\ntion claim raised for the first time in this appeal. Not one of\nthe three narrow circumstances which must exist for us to\nconsider that issue is present in this case. There is no need to\nprevent a miscarriage of justice, there has been no change of\napplicable law, and although the plaintiffs argue that the\nCity’s lease of Community House to the BRM violates two\nprovisions of the Idaho Constitution, Article 1, section 4 and\nArticle 9, section 5, that question is not a pure question of\nlaw. Accordingly, we exercise our discretion not to review the\nplaintiffs’ Idaho Constitution claim.\n\n   We will consider, however, the plaintiffs’ Establishment\nClause claim. The parties dispute whether the Establishment\nClause challenge was raised before the district court. We need\nnot resolve whether this issue was raised before that court\nbecause even if a party fails to raise an issue in the district\ncourt, we generally will not deem the issue waived if the dis-\ntrict court actually considered it. See Harrell v. 20th Century\nIns. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"561874\"><a href=\"/opinion/561874/jacqueline-r-harrell-michael-harrell-v-20th-century-insurance-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">934</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">203</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 206 n.1 (9th Cir. 1991). Here, the dis-\ntrict court considered and resolved the Establishment Clause\nissue. Accordingly, we will consider it.\n\n  2.   Establishment Clause\n\n   The plaintiffs argue that the district court abused its discre-\ntion by denying the full extent of their requested preliminary\ninjunction because the City’s lease with the BRM violates the\n\f18432            COMMUNITY HOUSE v. CITY OF BOISE\nEstablishment Clause of the First Amendment of the United\nStates Constitution. The district court only enjoined the City\nfrom leasing Community House to the BRM if the BRM\nrequires attendance at religious meetings as a condition of\nreceiving homeless services. The district court declined to\nmore broadly enjoin the City from participating in a lease\nwith the BRM in which the BRM conducts religious meetings\nin the Community House facility. We hold that the district\ncourt abused its discretion by not granting a broader prelimi-\nnary injunction with regard to the Establishment Clause\nclaim.\n\n      a.   Legal Framework\n\n   The Establishment Clause provides that “Congress shall\nmake no law respecting an establishment of religion.”7 U.S.\nConst. amend. I.

See Agostini,\n521 U.S. at 234; see also Mitchell, 530 U.S. at 808 (Thomas,\nJ., plurality); Mitchell, 530 at 845 (O’Connor, J., concurring).\nThe same primary criteria are considered when determining\nwhether aid constitutes an impermissible “endorsement” of\nreligion. See Agostini, 521 U.S. at 235; Mitchell, 530 U.S. at\n845 (O’Connor, J., concurring).\n\n      b.   District Court’s Decision\n\n   In the present case, the district court applied the Lemon test\n  9\n    As discussed hereafter, it is clear the City’s acts which the plaintiffs\nchallenge were not taken for the purpose of advancing religion, and inhibi-\ntion of religion is not an issue in this case. The question we must answer\nis whether the City’s challenged action in its lease to the BRM constitutes\ngovernmental aid which has the effect of advancing religion.\n\f18434          COMMUNITY HOUSE v. CITY OF BOISE\nand held that only a limited preliminary injunction regarding\nthe City’s lease with the BRM was required to avoid an\nEstablishment Clause violation. Under the first Lemon prong,\nthe district court found that the lease had the secular purpose\nof providing shelter to the homeless. With regard to the sec-\nond Lemon prong, the district court determined that the plain-\ntiffs had raised serious questions about whether the primary\neffect of the lease was secular or religious because there was\nevidence the BRM required an explanation from any home-\nless person who did not want to attend a religious meeting,\nand there was some evidence that the BRM required atten-\ndance at religious meetings as a condition of receiving ser-\nvices. As a result, the district court enjoined the City from\nparticipating in the lease with the BRM if the BRM directly\nor indirectly required residents of Community House to attend\nreligious meetings as a condition of receiving housing or\nother services. With this qualification, the district court found\nthat the primary effect of the lease was secular. The district\ncourt also found that its injunction would remove any exces-\nsive government entanglement with religion, the third Lemon\nprong, and concluded that the lease would not violate the\nEstablishment Clause. On this basis, the district court denied\nthe plaintiffs’ request for a broader preliminary injunction.\nThe district court did not apply the Agostini modification to\nthe Lemon test, nor did it consider Mitchell.\n\n    c.   Application of Legal Framework to this Case\n\n   Applying the Lemon test, as modified by Agostini, we con-\nclude that the district court abused its discretion by denying\na broader preliminary injunction. While the City’s lease of\nCommunity House to the BRM meets the “purpose” prong of\nthe test of Lemon-Agostini, it fails the “effect” prong.\n\n   There is no plausible dispute that the City leased Commu-\nnity House to the BRM for the valid secular purpose of pro-\nviding shelter to the homeless, not to promote religion. The\n\f               COMMUNITY HOUSE v. CITY OF BOISE            18435\nfirst part of the Lemon-Agostini test is therefore not in ques-\ntion and we need not discuss it.\n\n   [14] The issue is whether the City’s lease of Community\nHouse to the BRM has the “effect” of advancing religion\nunder the test of Lemon-Agostini. See Agostini, 521 U.S. at\n223; see also Lemon, 403 U.S. at 612. The plaintiffs assert\nthat the lease has this effect in two ways. First, they argue the\nlease creates excessive government entanglement with reli-\ngion because it requires extensive monitoring of Community\nHouse by the City to ensure that there are no violations of the\ndistrict court’s injunction or the Establishment Clause. Sec-\nond, they argue that the lease results in governmental indoctri-\nnation because it provides the BRM with a publicly financed\nfacility in which to spread its religious message.\n\n   Addressing the plaintiffs’ first argument — excessive\nentanglement due to extensive monitoring — the plaintiffs\nhave not raised serious questions that the lease will exces-\nsively entangle the City with religion. Government oversight\nto ensure that public funding is not used for religious purposes\nis not necessarily excessive entanglement. See KDM v. Reeds-\nport Sch. Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"766811\"><a href=\"/opinion/766811/kdm-a-minor-by-and-through-wjm-his-father-and-next-friend-v-reedsport/\"><span class=\"volume\">196</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1046</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1051 (9th Cir. 1999). “Entan-\nglement must be ‘excessive’ before it runs afoul of the Estab-\nlishment Clause.” Agostini, 521 U.S. at 233.\n\n   In Agostini, the Supreme Court held that unannounced\nmonthly visits (monitoring remedial-education public school\nteachers sent to parochial schools) in order to detect or pre-\nvent inculcation of religion did not constitute excessive gov-\nernment entanglement. See id. at 234 (“[W]e have not found\nexcessive entanglement in cases in which States imposed far\nmore onerous burdens on religious institutions than the moni-\ntoring system at issue here.”) (citing Bowen v.

CITY OF BOISE\n   At this stage of the litigation, there is insufficient evidence\nthat greater monitoring by the City than that deemed constitu-\ntionally permissible in Agostini would be required. Accord-\ningly, the plaintiffs have not shown that serious questions\nexist regarding excessive entanglement as a result of monitor-\ning by the City.\n\n   We next consider the plaintiffs’ argument that the City’s\nlease of Community House to the BRM results in governmen-\ntal indoctrination of religion. To satisfy this criterion, the\nplaintiffs must show (1) that the BRM’s activities at Commu-\nnity House constitute or result in indoctrination, and (2) that\nsuch indoctrination is attributable to the government. See\nDeStefano, 247 F.3d at 414 (citing Agostini, 521 U.S. at 226).\n\n   “To ‘indoctrinate’ means ‘[t]o instruct in a body of doctrine\nor principles . . . . To imbue with a partisan or ideological\npoint of view . . . .’ The Supreme Court uses ‘indoctrination’\nsynonymously with ‘inculcation.’ To ‘inculcate’ is ‘[t]o\nimpress (something) upon the mind of another by frequent\ninstruction or repetition; [to] instill.’ ” Id. (internal citations\nomitted). The record shows that the BRM conducts a daily\nsixty-minute Christian chapel service at Community House\nbefore dinner. The chapel service consists of singing, scrip-\nture reading, prayer, testimonies, and preaching. It thus\nappears that the BRM is giving instruction in, and imbuing\nthose Community House residents in attendance at the chapel\nservice with, the tenets of Christianity. This is true even\nassuming attendance at the chapel service is voluntary.\n\n   The plaintiffs have thus raised a serious question that the\nBRM’s activities at Community House constitute religious\nindoctrination. The next question is whether such indoctrina-\ntion is attributable to the government. The BRM’s lease of\nCommunity House is publicly financed.10 The City charges\n  10\n    The publicly-financed nature of the City’s lease of Community House\nto the BRM distinguishes it from those cases in which courts have held\n\f                  COMMUNITY HOUSE v. CITY OF BOISE                    18437\nthe BRM rent of $1 per year for five years for a furnished\n34,000 square foot building worth at least $2.5 million. The\nCity has also given the BRM a 20-month option to buy the\nproperty for $2 million, which is $500,000 less than the mini-\nmum value that the City established for the property in July\n2005. Under the lease, the City insures the premises and pays\nfor necessary repairs.\n\n   The City asserts, however, that religious indoctrination can-\nnot be attributed to it because of its neutral treatment of the\nBRM. The City points out that there is no evidence that the\nbid process to lease Community House to the BRM was reli-\ngiously biased. In addition, the City notes that the prior Com-\nmunity House lease with CHI, a secular organization,\nprovided a fifty year term with rent fixed at $1 per year. Thus,\nthe City’s lease with CHI was even more publicly financed\nthan its current lease with the BRM.\n\n  In Mitchell, Justice Thomas, writing for the plurality,\nargued that neutral administration of a government aid pro-\ngram could immunize the state from a charge that disburse-\nment of public funds to religious groups constitutes\ngovernmental indoctrination:\n\n     In distinguishing between indoctrination that is\n     attributable to the State and indoctrination that is not,\n     we have consistently turned to the principle of neu-\n     trality, upholding aid that is offered to a broad range\n     of groups or persons without regard to their religion.\n     If the religious, irreligious, and areligious are all\n\nthat the rental or sale of property to religious organizations did not violate\nthe Establishment Clause because such acts involved the rental or selling\nof property for fair market value in arm’s length business transactions.\nSee, e.g., Mercier v.

Mitchell, 530 U.S. at 838\n(O’Connor, J., concurring). However, she noted that “[w]e\nhave never held that a government-aid program passes consti-\ntutional muster solely because of the neutral criteria it\nemploys as a basis for distributing aid.” Id. at 839.\n\n   Justice O’Connor also disagreed with the Mitchell plurali-\nty’s conclusion that actual diversion of government aid to reli-\ngious indoctrination does not indicate an impropriety under\nthe Establishment Clause.12 See id. at 840. In contrast to the\nplurality, she emphasized that “actual diversion of govern-\nment aid to religious indoctrination” is constitutionally sus-\npect and is more central to the Establishment Clause\njurisprudence than neutrality or secular content.13 Id. She\n  12\n    In addition to neutrality, the plurality opinion focused on whether the\ngovernment aid has religious or secular content and dismissed inquiring\ninto whether the aid was diverted for religious purposes:\n       The issue is not divertibility of aid but rather whether the aid\n       itself has an impermissible content. Where the aid would be suit-\n       able for use in a public school, it is also suitable for use in any\n       private school. Similarly, the prohibition against the government\n       providing impermissible content resolves the Establishment\n       Clause concerns that exist if aid is actually diverted to religious\n       uses.\nMitchell, 530 U.S. at 822 (Thomas, J., plurality).\n   13\n      The Mitchell dissent would go further than Justice O’Connor’s\nemphasis on actual diversion and would hold unconstitutional government\naid if there is a substantial risk that it will be diverted to religious uses.\nSee id. at 890 (Souter, J., dissenting) (“[W]e have long held government\naid invalid when circumstances would allow its diversion to religious edu-\ncation.”).\n\f18440          COMMUNITY HOUSE v. CITY OF BOISE\nnoted that although Supreme Court “cases have permitted\nsome government funding of secular functions performed by\nsectarian organizations,” the Court’s decisions “provide no\nprecedent for the use of public funds to finance religious\nactivities.” Id. (citation omitted).\n\n   [15] Thus, Mitchell stands for the proposition that actual\ndiversion of secular government aid to religious indoctrina-\ntion violates the Establishment Clause. See id. at 840-42.\nHere, according to the showing that has been made at this\nstage of the litigation, it appears that the aid from the City\n(i.e., the subsidized Community House facility) is actually\nbeing diverted for Christian chapel services in addition to\nother services for the homeless. Accordingly, under Mitchell,\nthe plaintiffs have raised serious questions that the BRM’s\nreligious indoctrination occurring at Community House is\nattributable to the City.\n\n   Other Supreme Court cases support the conclusion that, to\navoid an Establishment Clause violation, a publicly financed\ngovernment building may not be diverted to religious use.

While the statute contained\na provision prohibiting the use of the funds to construct facili-\nties for sectarian worship, the provision expired after twenty\n\f               COMMUNITY HOUSE v. CITY OF BOISE            18441\nyears. See id. at 675. Applying the Lemon test, the Court held\nthat if, after expiration of the twenty-year prohibitory period,\nthe benefitted religious institutions used the facilities for sec-\ntarian worship, then the “effect” of the government’s grant\nwould be religious advancement. See id. at 683. The Court\nthus struck down the expiration of the twenty-year limit in\norder to avoid an Establishment Clause violation. See id. at\n689.\n\n   [16] Because the plaintiffs have raised serious questions as\nto whether the BRM’s religious activities at the publicly-\nfinanced Community House facility constitute governmental\nindoctrination of religion, they have established that serious\nquestions exist regarding whether the City’s aid to the BRM\nhas the “effect” of advancing religion. The plaintiffs have,\ntherefore, raised serious questions regarding an Establishment\nClause violation.\n\n   [17] The fact that the plaintiffs have raised “serious First\nAmendment questions compels a finding that there exists ‘the\npotential for irreparable injury, or that at the very least the\nbalance of hardships tips sharply in [the plaintiffs’] favor.’\nSammartano v.

Because the men-only policy at Commu-\nnity House is facially discriminatory, the district court erred\nin applying the McDonnell Douglas test. Under the facial dis-\ncrimination test of Johnson Controls, the plaintiffs have\nraised serious questions as to whether the City is discriminat-\ning against women and families in violation of the Fair Hous-\ning Act. There is no dispute that the balance of hardships tips\nin favor of the plaintiffs. Accordingly, we reverse the district\ncourt’s denial of the plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary\ninjunction that would require the reinstatement of Community\nHouse residents excluded by the men-only policy.\n\n   The plaintiffs have also raised serious questions as to\nwhether the City’s aid to the BRM by providing it with the\nCommunity House building has the “effect” of advancing reli-\ngion and violates the Establishment Clause. The balance of\nhardships as to this claim tips in the plaintiffs’ favor. We,\ntherefore, reverse the district court’s denial of the plaintiffs’\nrequest for a broader preliminary injunction prohibiting\nchapel services and other religious activities at the Commu-\nnity House facility.

Sec-\nond, even if there is some question as to whether the overall\nscheme constituted a “bona fide occupational qualification”\nunder Johnson Controls, id. at 200, the appropriate remedy is\nto vacate the district court’s order and remand for further pro-\nceedings. Third, although the majority correctly identifies the\ncritical issue on appellants’ Establishment Clause claim, its\nconclusion that the Boise Rescue Mission Ministries’ volun-\ntary chapel services constitute religious indoctrination attrib-\nutable to the government is neither factually nor legally\nsound.\n\n                                     I\n\n   My analysis starts with the same factual determination as\nthe majority: the men-only policy at Community House is\nfacially discriminatory because it explicitly treats women and\nfamilies different from men. Furthermore, we agree that the\ndistrict court erred in applying the test set forth in McDonnell\nDouglas Corp. v.

In Johnson Controls, the Supreme Court\nheld that discrimination based on gender was forbidden under\nTitle VII “unless respondent can establish that sex is a ‘bona\nfide occupational qualification.’ ” (“BFOQ”) Id. at 200.\n\n   I also agree with the majority that in examining discrimina-\n  1\n    I concur in the majority’s affirmance of the district court’s denial of\nrelief on appellants’ disability discrimination claims and the decision to\ndecline to consider the appellants’ claim under the Idaho Constitution.\n\f18444           COMMUNITY HOUSE v.

I do not object to the\nmajority’s adoption of the approach adopted by the Sixth and\nTenth Circuits in requiring that a restriction be based on legit-\nimate public concerns, rather than stereotypes, and benefits\nthe protected class.

The safety\nconcerns are the type of legitimate interests, not based on ste-\nreotypes, that may satisfy the first prong of the test for allow-\ning a facially discriminatory provision. Indeed, the majority\nrecognizes that safety concerns might justify the men-only\npolicy. (See maj. op. 18427) I would affirm as I agree with the\ndistrict court that “the record contains evidence supporting the\nsafety problems inherent in housing homeless men with\nhomeless women.” Moreover, even if I were to determine that\nsafety concerns were not adequately addressed on this record,\nI would remand the matter to the district court to take addi-\ntional evidence.2\n  2\n    The district court noted that Community House contained both a home-\nless shelter and a low-cost housing unit. The homeless shelter could hold\n\f                 COMMUNITY HOUSE v. CITY OF BOISE                    18445\n   The City addressed the second prong of the test by offering\nevidence that the men-only policy at Community House was\nonly a temporary disadvantage necessary to allow the conver-\nsion of the nearby Boise Rescue Mission into increased shel-\nter space for women and children. In Bangerter, the Tenth\nCircuit observed that “courts have uniformly allowed defen-\ndants to justify their conduct despite the discriminatory\nimpact if they can prove that they ‘furthered, in theory and in\npractice, a legitimate, bona fide governmental interest and that\nno alternative would serve that interest with less discrimina-\ntory effect’ ” and noted that a similar approach had been sug-\ngested for certain intentional discrimination claims under the\nFair Housing Act. 46 F.3d at 1504-05 (internal citations omit-\nted).\n\n   Here, the district court held:\n\n     It appears to the court that with the lease, the city\n     seized the opportunity to (1) turn over operations of\n     Community House to an expert; (2) immediately\n     increase the space for homeless men; and (3) eventu-\n     ally increase the space for homeless women and chil-\n     dren. In other words, the City made the political\n     decision to trade short-term hardship for long-term\n     gain.\n\n     If the Court were to intervene, it would simply trans-\n     fer the hardship from one class of homeless women\n     to another. By ordering the return of former female\n     residents to Community House, the Court would\n     scuttle any deal for increased space at the Boise Res-\n\nin separate dorms, 66 men and 13 women. There were ten units for home-\nless families and another ten units for low income, or “transitional,” hous-\ning as well as 39 single-residence apartments. Community House had\naccommodations for the disabled, and about three-fourths of its residents\nwere disabled. This mix of homeless single adults, families with children,\nand the disabled (mentally and physically) would appear to be a volatile\nmix.\n\f18446           COMMUNITY HOUSE v. CITY OF BOISE\n      cue Mission and shift the hardship to the women\n      who would have occupied that space.\n\n      This case is about scarce resources, not discrimina-\n      tion.\n\nI would hold that the district court’s reasoning supports a\ndetermination that the men-only policy at the Community\nHouse was in effect a “BFOQ” intended to result in additional\nand better shelters for women and children.3 We should not be\nso shortsighted as to not recognize that improving the housing\nfor certain groups of people may require some short-term dis-\nadvantages.\n\n   It is not clear whether the majority disagrees with the prop-\nosition that the long-term benefits may justify short-term dis-\nadvantages. It seems to question the factual premise of the\ndistrict court’s determination, rather than its legal analysis.\nThe majority cites BRM’s reticence, prior to the approval of\nits bid for Community House, to commit to the conversion of\nthe Boise Rescue Mission. The district court, however, found\nthat “BRM made that commitment in its proposal to the City,\nand there is no evidence that the BRM intends not to honor\nits commitment.”\n\n  I would hold that although the district court erred in apply-\ning the McDonnell Douglas standard instead of the Johnson\nControls approach, the error was harmless because the City\npresented evidence that fairly supports the district court’s\ndetermination that the men-only policy was part of a program\ndesigned to increase the homeless shelter available to women\nand children, and this determination is entitled to deference.\nNat’l Wildlife Federation v.

Here, we agree that the appellants have not\nshown that serious questions exist regarding excessive entan-\n\f              COMMUNITY HOUSE v. CITY OF BOISE            18449\nglement (see maj. op 18436), and it appears that neither the\nCity in its lease, nor the BRM in managing the shelter, “de-\nfines the recipients by reference to religion.” Thus, for there\nto be any violation of the Establishment Clause there must be\n“governmental indoctrination.”\n\n   The majority reasons that “governmental indoctrination”\nhas two components: (1) that BRM’s activities at Community\nHouse constitute or result in indoctrination, and (2) that such\nindoctrination is attributable to the government. (See maj. op.\n18436, citing DeStefano v. Emergency Hous. Group, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772931\"><a href=\"/opinion/772931/joseph-m-destefano-as-taxpayer-of-the-county-of-orange-state-of-new/\"><span class=\"volume\">247</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">397</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 414 (2d Cir. 2001)). For the purposes of this dis-\nsent, I accept the majority’s determination that BRM’s hold-\ning of chapel services constitutes “indoctrination.” The\nmajority, however, fails to appreciate the Supreme Court’s\nopinions in Agostini and Mitchell when it concludes that this\n“indoctrination” is attributable to the City.\n\n   The majority’s conclusion is based on its finding that “it\nappears that the aid from the City (i.e. the Community House\nfacility) is actually being diverted for Christian chapel ser-\nvices in addition to other services for the homeless.” (maj. op.\n18440) This finding is factually suspect and employs disap-\nproved legal analysis.\n\n   On the existing record, it is questionable whether there is\nany “aid” flowing from the city to the BRM. What is known\nis that the BRM pays the City a dollar a year. The BRM has\na five-year lease, and the City insures the premises and pays\nfor necessary repairs. The majority also notes that the BRM\nhas a 20-month option to buy the property for two million\ndollars, which is $500,000 less than the minimum value that\nthe City established for the property in July 2005. But, there\nis no suggestion that the BRM’s bid was not the best bid that\nthe City received. Also, as the majority notes, the City’s prior\nlease with a secular organization was even more favorable to\nthe lessee. Furthermore, it appears that Community House\nwas constructed with federal funds and that this restricts what\n\f18450          COMMUNITY HOUSE v. CITY OF BOISE\nthe City can do with Community House. In addition, the\nrecord reflects that the BRM is a Christian non-profit organi-\nzation that serves the homeless population in Boise. There is\nnothing in the record to suggest that the lease of Community\nHouse somehow enriches the BRM. Rather, it appears that the\nlease allows the BRM to provide homeless shelters that other-\nwise would have to be furnished (and paid for) by the City or\nsimply would not exist. Perhaps a record could be developed\nto show that the lease constitutes “aid” from the City to the\nBRM, but the present record neither compels, nor supports,\nsuch a factual determination.\n\n   The majority’s conclusion is also based on a concept of\ndiversion that was strongly rejected in Mitchell both by Jus-\ntice Thomas in his plurality opinion and by Justice O’Connor\nin her concurring opinion. The majority’s reasoning appears\nto be that whatever “aid” flows from the City to the BRM by\nway of the lease is “diverted” from the secular purpose of the\nlease — providing shelter — to the religious purpose of hold-\ning non-mandatory chapel services. This is out of step with\nthe plurality and concurring opinions in Mitchell.\n\n   The situation at bar does not constitute governmental\nindoctrination under Justice Thomas’s plurality opinion in\nMitchell. Although Mitchell concerned a distinct issue, aid to\nprivate religious schools, the impact of the plurality’s position\non this case is clear. Justice Thomas wrote:\n\n    In distinguishing between indoctrination that is\n    attributable to the State and indoctrination that is not,\n    we have consistently turned to the principle of neu-\n    trality, upholding aid that is offered to a broad range\n    of groups or persons without regard to their religion.\n    If the religious, irreligious, and areligious are all\n    alike eligible for governmental aid, no one would\n    conclude that any indoctrination that any particular\n    recipient conducts has been done at the behest of the\n    government. For attribution of indoctrination is a rel-\n\f                   COMMUNITY HOUSE v. CITY OF BOISE                   18451\n       ative question. If the government is offering assis-\n       tance to recipients who provide, so to speak, a broad\n       range of indoctrination, the government itself is not\n       thought responsible for any particular indoctrination.\n\n530 U.S. at 809-10. In our case, the City, pursuant to a request\nfor proposals, determined that the BRM could best meet its\nsecular purpose of providing shelter to the homeless. Under\nthe plurality’s approach, the incidental holding of voluntary\nchapel services for the homeless does not rise to the level of\ngovernmental indoctrination. Justice Thomas recognized that\nthe aid in issue in Mitchell could indirectly benefit the religion\nthat operated the school, but held that this could not reason-\nably be viewed as an endorsement of religion.4 Id. at 835. Jus-\ntice Thomas’s plurality opinion should be read in conjunction\nwith Justice O’Connor’s concurring opinion. The majority\nhere focuses on Justice O’Connor’s statement that the Court\nhas “never held that a government-aid program passes consti-\ntutional muster solely because of the neutral criteria it\nemploys as a basis for distributing aid.” Mitchell, 530 U.S. at\n839 (emphasis in original), and her objection to the “actual\ndiversion of government aid to religious indoctrination.” (maj.\nop. 18439) This misses the critical distinction between Justice\n  4\n   Justice Thomas explained:\n      A concern for divertibility, as opposed to improper content, is\n      misplaced not only because it fails to explain why the sort of aid\n      that we have allowed is permissible, but also because it is bound-\n      less — enveloping all aid, no matter how trivial — and thus has\n      only the most attenuated (if any) link to any realistic concern for\n      preventing an “establishment of religion.” Presumably, for exam-\n      ple, government-provided lecterns, chalk, crayons, pens, paper,\n      and paintbrushes would have to be excluded from religious\n      schools under respondents’ proposed rule. But we fail to see how\n      indoctrination by means of (i.e., diversion of) such aid could be\n      attributed to the government.\nId. at 824. Similarly, in this case, it is doubtful whether — as a matter of\nlaw — the supposed diversion of “aid” to the BRM’s chapel services\ncould be attributed to the City.\n\f18452              COMMUNITY HOUSE v. CITY OF BOISE\nO’Connor’s concurring opinion and Justice Souter’s dissent.\nJustice O’Connor, joined by Justice Breyer, held that the aid\nin issue in Mitchell did not result in governmental indoctrina-\ntion, even though it obviously had some indirect benefit to the\nreligion that ran the school. Similarly, even assuming that\nsome aid flows from the City to the BRM, under Justice\nO’Connor’s concurring opinion in Mitchell, this does not\namount to government indoctrination.\n\n   Justice O’Connor observed that in recent years the Court\n“had taken a more forgiving view of neutral government pro-\ngrams that make aid available generally without regard to the\nreligious or nonreligious character of the recipient.” Mitchell,\n530 U.S. at 847, citing Agostini, 521 U.S. at 225-26. In addi-\ntion, she, like the plurality, recognized that almost any aid\ncould be diverted.5 To meet these realities, Justice O’Connor\n  5\n   Justice O’Connor observed:\n      An educator can use virtually any instructional tool, whether it\n      has ascertainable content or not, to teach a religious message. In\n      this respect, I agree with the plurality that “it is hard to imagine\n      any book that could not, in even moderately skilled hands, serve\n      to illustrate a religious message.” Ante, at 2549. In today’s case,\n      for example, we are asked to draw a constitutional distinction\n      between lending a textbook and lending a library book. Justice\n      SOUTER’s try at justifying that distinction only demonstrates the\n      absurdity on which such a difference must rest. He states that\n      “[a]lthough library books, like textbooks, have fixed content, reli-\n      gious teachers can assign secular library books for religious cri-\n      tique.” Post, at 2592. Regardless of whether that explanation is\n      even correct (for a student surely could be given a religious\n      assignment in connection with a textbook too), it is hardly a dis-\n      tinction on which constitutional law should turn. Moreover, if the\n      mere ability of a teacher to devise a religious lesson involving the\n      secular aid in question suffices to hold the provision of that aid\n      unconstitutional, it is difficult to discern any limiting principle to\n      the divertibility rule. For example, even a publicly financed lunch\n      would apparently be unconstitutional under a divertibility ratio-\n      nale because religious school officials conceivably could use the\n      lunch to lead the students in a blessing over the bread.\nId. at 855.\n\f                 COMMUNITY HOUSE v. CITY OF BOISE                    18453\nproposed that to “establish a First Amendment violation,\nplaintiffs must prove that the aid in question actually is, or has\nbeen, used for religious purposes.” Id. at 857. However, she\nwould reject any presumption that secular restrictions were\nnot followed. Id. at 859. Justice O’Connor also indicated that\na de minimis diversion would not raise constitutional concerns.6\nId. at 861.\n\n   In our case, any aid flowing from the City to the BRM is\ntruly de minimis. The BRM has agreed to undertake the not\ninconsiderable expense of maintaining a homeless shelter, in\nreturn for the City insuring the premises and paying for neces-\nsary repairs.7 As it does not appear that the BRM receives any\nfunds from the City, there is no possibility of any actual diver-\nsion of money. Accordingly, the majority ventures into the\nrelatively unchartered waters of determining when intangible\nassistance from a governmental entity amounts to “govern-\nmental indoctrination.” I would not embark on this course\nbecause, here, conducting chapel services at which attendance\nis voluntary, in conjunction with generally providing home-\nless services, simply does not rise to a level of constitutional\nconcern.\n\n   Finally, even if it were determined that holding voluntary\nchapel services could amount to government indoctrination,\nthe proper course, as previously explained (see Part II), would\nbe to vacate the district court’s denial of injunctive relief, and\nto remand to allow the parties to present the factual evidence\nnecessary for even a preliminary determination that the\nBRM’s holding of voluntary chapel services might amount to\ngovernment indoctrination.\n  6\n     Justice O’Connor wrote: “[t]he limited evidence amassed by respon-\ndents during 4 years of discovery (which began approximately 15 years\nago) is at best de minimis and therefore insufficient to affect the constitu-\ntional inquiry.” Id. at 861.\n   7\n     The City may well have these obligations regardless of the identity of\nthe lessee, or whether the building is leased.\n\f18454          COMMUNITY HOUSE v. CITY OF BOISE\n                               IV\n\n   In sum, I would affirm the district court’s denial of a pre-\nliminary injunction. Although the district court erred in failing\nto apply the test set forth in Johnson Controls, 499 U.S. at\n200-01, this was harmless error because the record shows that\nthe City offered two bona fide government interests to sustain\nthe lease. In addition, this record contains no showing of the\n“governmental indoctrination” necessary for judicial relief\nfrom an alleged violation of the Establishment Clause under\nthe Supreme Court’s opinions in Agostini, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118133\"><a href=\"/opinion/118133/agostini-v-felton/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">203</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, and\nMitchell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118386\"><a href=\"/opinion/118386/mitchell-v-helms/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">793</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.
