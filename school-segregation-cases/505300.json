Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office, 668 F.Supp. 1361, 1368 (N.D.Cal.1987), and that the DoD security clearance regulations \"must withstand strict scrutiny because they impinge upon the right of lesbians and gay men to engage in any homosexual activity, not merely sodomy, and thus impinge upon their exercise of a fundamental right.\"    Id. at 1370.    The district court rejected the reasons proffered by the DoD to justify its policies and found the absence of even a \"rational basis for defendants' subjecting all gay applicants to expanded investigations and mandatory adjudications while not doing the same for all straight applicants.\"    Id. at 1373.    The district court therefore concluded that the DoD policy violates the Constitution and granted summary judgment to the plaintiffs.  We reverse the part of the district court's order granting summary judgment to the plaintiffs, vacate the part denying summary judgment to the DoD, and remand to enter summary judgment in favor of the DoD.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>Background</p>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This appeal involves a class action<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> challenging the mandatory investigation of all homosexual<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> applicants seeking a Secret or Top Secret clearance.  The clearance process begins when the defense contractor forwards an individual's name to the DoD for Secret or Top Secret clearance.  32 C.F.R. Secs. 154.30, .31 (1987).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>   For a Secret clearance, the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Organization (DISCO) conducts a National Agency Check (NAC), which consists at a minimum of a record check of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Defense Central Intelligence Index, but may also include a record check of the Office of Personnel Management, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the State Department, and the Central Intelligence Agency.  32 C.F.R. Sec. 154.3(m);  DoD 5200.2-R, app. B (1979).  For Top Secret clearance, the Defense Investigative Service (DIS) completes a Background Investigation (BI) for each applicant, which consists of a NAC, local records check, and interviews with personal sources.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DISCO will grant a Secret clearance if no adverse or questionable information is developed by the NAC.  If adverse information arises from the NAC, DIS conducts an expanded investigation to substantiate or disprove the adverse or questionable information and conducts a personal interview of the applicant.  32 C.F.R. Sec. 154.8(i)(2), (j).  If information obtained from the expanded investigation resolves the question of potentially adverse information, DISCO grants the Secret clearance.  Similarly, for a Top Secret clearance application, if the BI resolves any potentially derogatory information that may have arisen during the investigation, DISCO grants the clearance.  The Department of Defense Personnel Security Program, DoD 5200.2-R, app. E (1979), provides guidelines for DISCO in determining whether there is significant adverse information that prevents the granting of a clearance.  32 C.F.R. pt. 154, app. D.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For both Secret and Top Secret clearances, if DISCO cannot find that granting the security clearance would be clearly consistent with the national interest, the case is referred to the Directorate for Industrial Security Clearance Review (DISCR) for review and adjudication.  32 C.F.R.

In appendix D, number 2, acts of sexual misconduct under 32 C.F.R. Sec. 154.7(q) are defined to include \"all indications of moral turpitude, heterosexual promiscuity, aberrant, deviant or bizarre sexual conduct or behavior, transvestitism [sic], transsexualism, indecent exposure, rape, contributing to the delinquency of a minor, child molestation, wife-swapping, window peeping, and similar situations from whatever source.\"    32 C.F.R. pt. 154, app. D, no. 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In appendix H, each category is further broken down into sections describing disqualifying factors and mitigating factors.  The disqualifying factors under sexual misconduct include conduct involving acts performed in open or in public places;  acts performed with minors or animals;  acts involving inducement, force, coercion, or violence;  prostitution;  sexual harassment;  self-mutilation;  spouse swapping or group sex orgies;  adultery that is recent, frequent and likely to continue and has adverse effect in the work place;  conduct determined to be criminal in the locale in which it occurred;  and deviant or perverted sexual behavior which may indicate a mental or personality disorder (e.g., transsexualism, transvestism, exhibitionism, incest, child molestation, voyeurism, bestiality, or sodomy).  32 C.F.R. pt. 154, app. H.  The disqualifying factors also include whether such conduct has been recent;  whether it increases the applicant's vulnerability to blackmail, coercion or pressure;  and whether the applicant is likely to repeat the conduct in the future.  Id.  Mitigating factors include whether the conduct occurred on an isolated basis, the age of the applicant at the time of the act, whether the applicant has completed professional therapy, and whether the sexual misconduct can no longer form the basis for vulnerability to blackmail, coercion or pressure.

See DIS 20-1-M (1985).  According to the DIS 20-1-M, the DIS will not ordinarily \"investigate allegations of heterosexual conduct between consenting adults.\"    Id. para. 4-10, at 4-5.  If circumstances warrant, the DIS will expand the investigation \"to determine if the SUBJECT, through his or her activities is susceptible to coercion and blackmail has committed criminal acts, or engaged in reckless and irresponsible conduct.\"    Id.  Extramarital sexual relations are considered a legitimate concern when the potential for undue influence or duress exists.  Id.  Other sexual conduct including homosexuality, bestiality, fetishism, exhibitionism, sadism, masochism, transvestism, necrophilia, nymphomania or satyriasis, pedophilia and voyeurism is considered a \"relevant consideration in circumstances in which deviant conduct indicates a personality disorder or could result in exposing the individual to direct or indirect blackmail or coercion.\"    Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Participation in deviant sexual activities may tend to cast doubt on the individual's morality, emotional or mental stability and may raise questions as to his or her susceptibility to coercion or blackmail.\"    Id. para. 4-11, at 4-5, 4-6.

[A] general categorization of the types of individuals with whom the SUBJECT participates in deviant activity.  Inquiries should be designed to determine whether the SUBJECT and the coparticipants are open or secretive regarding their deviant activity.  Ascertain the general age group of the SUBJECT's partners, since involvement with minors could indicate criminal or irresponsible conduct.  Determine if the SUBJECT maintains a single or a small number of lasting relationships or effects numerous transient and temporary liaisons with a variety of individuals through chance meetings in bars or other public places.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">c.

[I]t may be beneficial to conduct ... limited inquiries on identified coparticipants, references, and other associates to fully determine the SUBJECT's involvement in such activities.

Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873 (1954), only the Fifth Amendment, not the Fourteenth, was applicable in the District of Columbia.  Bolling, 347 U.S. at 499, 74 S.Ct. at 694.    The Court noted that the Fifth Amendment \"does not contain an equal protection clause as does the Fourteenth Amendment which applies only to the states,\" and held that racial segregation in the District of Columbia public schools violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  The Court believed that in light of their decision in Brown that the Constitution prohibits states from maintaining racially segregated schools, \"it would be unthinkable that the same Constitution would impose a lesser duty on the Federal Government.\"    Id. at 499-500, 74 S.Ct. at 694-95 (footnote omitted).

The plaintiffs' \"factual study\" of nineteen applications is not a large enough sample of homosexual applicants for security clearances to be able to draw such a broad conclusion.

The DoD's justification for their policy of subjecting homosexual applicants to expanded investigations involves a two-step analyses:  First, the DoD sought to establish that counterintelligence agencies target homosexuals;  and, second, because homosexuals are targeted, the DoD subjects a homosexual applicant to an expanded investigation to determine if the applicant is susceptible to coercion or blackmail or otherwise vulnerable to counterintelligence efforts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To establish that homosexuals are targeted by counterintelligence agencies, the DoD presented the following evidence.

The DoD also relies on Barron's book, KGB:  The Secret Work of Soviet Secret Agents (1974), which states that \"the KGB is not primarily interested in homosexuals because of their presumed susceptibility to blackmail.

The plaintiff in Dubbs alleged that the CIA had violated her constitutional rights by 1) enforcing a policy of refusing security clearances to all homosexuals and 2) considering homosexual conduct, but not heterosexual conduct, a negative factor in individual security clearance determinations.  With regard to plaintiff's first claim, we expressed no opinion on the constitutionality of the CIA's alleged blanket policy against homosexuals.  Id. at 1119.    Further, since this case involves no allegation of a blanket policy of refusing to issue security clearances to homosexuals, Dubbs' resolution of this first claim is not relevant to this case.  With regard to plaintiff's second claim, we reversed the district court's grant of summary judgment to the defendant because the district court had improperly refused to consider the merits of plaintiff's constitutional claim.

The clearance process begins when the defense contractor forwards an individual's name to the DoD for Secret or Top Secret clearance.  32 C.F.R. Secs. 154.30, .31 (1987).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>   For a Secret clearance, the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Organization (DISCO) conducts a National Agency Check (NAC), which consists at a minimum of a record check of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Defense Central Intelligence Index, but may also include a record check of the Office of Personnel Management, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the State Department, and the Central Intelligence Agency.  32 C.F.R. Sec. 154.3(m);  DoD 5200.2-R, app. B (1979).

Sec. 154.8(i)(2), (j).  If information obtained from the expanded investigation resolves the question of potentially adverse information, DISCO grants the Secret clearance.  Similarly, for a Top Secret clearance application, if the BI resolves any potentially derogatory information that may have arisen during the investigation, DISCO grants the clearance.  The Department of Defense Personnel Security Program, DoD 5200.2-R, app. E (1979), provides guidelines for DISCO in determining whether there is significant adverse information that prevents the granting of a clearance.  32 C.F.R. pt. 154, app. D.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For both Secret and Top Secret clearances, if DISCO cannot find that granting the security clearance would be clearly consistent with the national interest, the case is referred to the Directorate for Industrial Security Clearance Review (DISCR) for review and adjudication.  32 C.F.R.

The disqualifying factors also include whether such conduct has been recent;  whether it increases the applicant's vulnerability to blackmail, coercion or pressure;  and whether the applicant is likely to repeat the conduct in the future.  Id.  Mitigating factors include whether the conduct occurred on an isolated basis, the age of the applicant at the time of the act, whether the applicant has completed professional therapy, and whether the sexual misconduct can no longer form the basis for vulnerability to blackmail, coercion or pressure.

If circumstances warrant, the DIS will expand the investigation \"to determine if the SUBJECT, through his or her activities is susceptible to coercion and blackmail has committed criminal acts, or engaged in reckless and irresponsible conduct.\"    Id.  Extramarital sexual relations are considered a legitimate concern when the potential for undue influence or duress exists.  Id.  Other sexual conduct including homosexuality, bestiality, fetishism, exhibitionism, sadism, masochism, transvestism, necrophilia, nymphomania or satyriasis, pedophilia and voyeurism is considered a \"relevant consideration in circumstances in which deviant conduct indicates a personality disorder or could result in exposing the individual to direct or indirect blackmail or coercion.\"    Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Participation in deviant sexual activities may tend to cast doubt on the individual's morality, emotional or mental stability and may raise questions as to his or her susceptibility to coercion or blackmail.\"    Id. para. 4-11, at 4-5, 4-6.

We agree.  The plaintiffs' affidavits and evidence fail to make a sufficient showing that the DoD does not have a rational basis for its expanded security investigation of homosexuals or that there is a genuine issue of material fact for trial.  Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322-23, 106 S.Ct. at 2552-53.    Nor have the plaintiffs offered \"any significant probative evidence tending to support [their] complaint.\"    Anderson, 477 U.S. at 256, 106 S.Ct. at 254 (quotation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs first point to the inability of the DoD to find any evidence tending to show that homosexual applicants for clearances have \"succumbed to blackmail,\" \"failed to safeguard classified information,\" or that as a class are a \"worse security risk\" than heterosexual applicants.

The DoD need only show a rational basis for its policy and that its policy is rationally related to the legitimate governmental interest of protecting classified material for it to be constitutional.  Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 440, 105 S.Ct. at 3254.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, the plaintiffs suggest that other \"governmental evidence\" conclusively demonstrates that homosexuals do not pose a security risk.  Relying on the April 1985 hearings before the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, the plaintiffs point out that of forty espionage cases, only two involved homosexuals, neither of which involved a blackmail attempt.  Plaintiffs' Brief Supporting Motion for Summary Judgment at 6.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The report the plaintiffs refer to consists of unclassified summaries of a limited number of espionage cases involving individuals who have been convicted of compromising United States classified information.  Federal Government Security Programs, 1985:  Hearings Before the Permanent Subcomm. on Investigations of the Senate Comm. on Governmental Affairs, 99th Cong., 1st Sess. 99-166 (1985) (DIA report).  Although these case studies involve actual circumstances where DoD and DoD-related classified information was compromised, the report is not a study of all the significant espionage cases involving homosexuals.  Moreover, one of the reported cases points out that homosexuals are targeted by the KGB:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p>[He] was a homosexual and this fact interested the KGB handlers since the homosexual frequently is shunted by society and made to feel like a social outcast.  Such a personality may seek to retaliate against a society that has placed him in this unenviable position.

Plaintiffs' Brief Supporting Motion for Summary Judgment at 6-7.  This contention is meritless.  The plaintiffs' \"factual study\" of nineteen applications is not a large enough sample of homosexual applicants for security clearances to be able to draw such a broad conclusion.  Even if the plaintiffs' contention had merit, it would take an expanded investigation of all homosexual applicants to determine which ones limit their sexual activities to consenting adults.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs' last contention is that the DoD \"is more concerned with punishing homosexual clearance applicants than with treating them rationally regarding blackmail.\"    Plaintiffs' Brief Supporting Motion for Summary Judgment at 9.  In support, the plaintiffs rely on the deposition of Richard Olinger, former Manager of the Government Security Department at Lockheed Missiles and Space Company, in which Mr. Olinger responded to questions about the subject matter of two conferences he attended during his tenure with Lockheed.  According to the plaintiffs, since homosexuality was not discussed at these two conferences on industrial security programs, the DoD has no \"real\" concern about homosexuals as security risks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs' conclusion is without merit.  A review of the deposition reveals that one of the conferences attended by Mr. Olinger concerned a specific espionage case and the other conference involved a discussion of statistical matters on processing security clearances.  Deposition of Robert Olinger at 34 and 47.  Given the limited agenda of these two conferences, it is apparent that the security risk of homosexuals would not be discussed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are convinced the DoD has met its burden of persuasion under Celotex by demonstrating that its investigatory policies and procedures for homosexuals are rationally related to permissible ends, and that the plaintiffs have failed to submit affirmative evidence to negate DoD's evidence.  The DoD's justification for their policy of subjecting homosexual applicants to expanded investigations involves a two-step analyses:  First, the DoD sought to establish that counterintelligence agencies target homosexuals;  and, second, because homosexuals are targeted, the DoD subjects a homosexual applicant to an expanded investigation to determine if the applicant is susceptible to coercion or blackmail or otherwise vulnerable to counterintelligence efforts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To establish that homosexuals are targeted by counterintelligence agencies, the DoD presented the following evidence.  John Donnelly, Assistant Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Counterintelligence and Security, who is directly responsible for ensuring that the Department's personnel security program remains responsive to the threats posed by hostile intelligence agencies, concluded that the recruitment of individuals by hostile intelligence agencies often involves the \"exploitation of what those agencies consider to be human weaknesses, indiscretions and vices,\" and that with great consistency sexuality is considered a \"potentially exploitable vulnerability.\"    He states that hostile intelligence agencies attempt to segregate those with alcohol or drug problems, financial problems, a known disregard for security, and/or those who can be exploited sexually;  and that although blackmail may sometimes be used after the person is already compromised, \"generally the initial efforts of exploitation centers around enticing the targeted individual with money, sexual favors, treatment for alcoholism, etc.\"    While he notes that this does not mean that hostile intelligence agencies always seek out homosexuals as targets, they usually spot individuals with the desired access and then assess them in order to determine the most effective approach.

Short, USMC, Judge Advocate in the United States Marine Corps, who served as assistant trial counsel in the court-martial of Sergeant Clayton J. Lonetree, a marine convicted of espionage, stated that at the trial of Sergeant Lonetree, the court accepted Mr. John Barron of Annandale, Virginia as an expert<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> in the field of the methods and operations of the Soviet Intelligence Service (the KGB), and that Mr. Barron testified as to KGB recruitment of homosexuals.

Barron also specifically cited an example of just such an entrapment operation, in which the KGB entrapped a Canadian ambassador to the Soviet Union through the exploitation of a homosexual relationship.  The DoD also relies on Barron's book, KGB:  The Secret Work of Soviet Secret Agents (1974), which states that \"the KGB is not primarily interested in homosexuals because of their presumed susceptibility to blackmail.  In its judgment, homosexuality often is accompanied by personality disorders that make the victim potentially unstable and vulnerable to adroit manipulation.\"    Id. at 280.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The DoD also presented extracts of sworn statements of Sergeant Lonetree, provided by Lonetree to Special Agents of the Naval Investigative Service, relating one meeting with his Soviet control Sasha (later identified as Aleksei Yefimou, an officer of the KGB), where Sasha specifically inquired as to homosexuals:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p>During a meeting with Sasha he asked me to tell him who were the homosexuals, drunks and people who were exploitable who worked in the embassy as civilians.

Fay, who described the 1979 Madsen espionage case involving the compromise of classified information by a homosexual.

Inexact science or not the DoD has articulated a rational relationship between their policy of subjecting homosexual applicants to expanded investigations and its compelling interest in national security.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>   Id. 108 S.Ct. at 825 (\"an agency head who must bear the responsibility for the protection of classified information committed to his custody should have the final say in deciding whether to repose his trust in an employee who has access to such information\") (quotation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the DoD has met its initial burden of production, by negating an essential element of the plaintiffs' claim, the burden of production shifted to the plaintiffs to \"produce evidentiary materials that demonstrate the existence of a 'genuine issue' for trial.\"    Celotex, 477 U.S. at 331, 106 S.Ct. at 2557 (Brennan, J., dissenting).  Thus, it was up to the plaintiffs to meet the issue that the expanded investigations were not, in fact, rationally related to national security concerns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that the plaintiffs' affidavits do not raise genuine issues as to any fact material to the alleged constitutional violation, but merely raise an issue as to the alleged irrationality of the KGB's opinion on homosexual behavior.  The plaintiffs' evidence is not material to the DoD's basis for expanded investigations of homosexual applicants--that homosexuals are targeted by counterintelligence agencies.  See Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248, 106 S.Ct. at 2510 (only disputes over the outcome of the suit under the governing law will properly preclude entry of summary judgment).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For example, the plaintiffs rely on a resolution of the American Psychological Association which states that homosexuality \"implies no impairment in judgment, stability, reliability or general social or vocational capabilities.\"    Resolution of American Psychological Association (January 1975).  According to the plaintiffs, the \"KGB's obsolete opinions on homosexual behavior\" should be rejected in favor of adopting the position of the American Psychological Association.  However, the counterintelligence agencies' reasons for targeting homosexuals--even if based on continuing ignorance or prejudice--are irrelevant.  Cf.

His disclosures regarding his visits to gay bathhouses, his membership in a homosexual organization, his homosexual activities with casual acquaintances, his intention to inform his employer as to his homosexuality, and his intention to continue his homosexual lifestyle in the future were sufficient to justify the referral of the application to DISCR for an expanded investigation.  His membership in a homosexual organization was simply one of the many facets of the criteria being considered as part of Dooling's homosexual activities.

DISCO's recommendation to DISCR is specific to Dooling, and the reasons given are specific to his homosexual activities and to the listed adjudicative criterion.

The plaintiffs specifically alleged:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p>11.1 In October 1984, Defendants subjected Plaintiff CRAWFORD to a personal interview in which the details of his sexual activities and related social activities were probed.  In particular, he was asked about the number of his adult male sexual partners, and the information he provided on this subject constituted the sole basis for his inability to obtain a Secret clearance until after he joined this lawsuit in February, 1985.  In late April 1985, CRAWFORD was notified by a second Statement of Reasons from DISCR that his application was being denied this time because of past, discontinued marijuana use rather than the purely sexual reasons listed in the first Statement of Reasons issued in about July 1984.  The DOD changed its reasons in retaliation for CRAWFORD's joining this lawsuit in a attempt to weaken his legal position herein by shifting its grounds from homosexuality to drug use, in violation of his First Amendment right to petition the Courts for redress of grievances and his right to due process of law in security clearance processing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third Amended Complaint, para. 11.1, at 8-9.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The above allegations refer to a June 16, 1983, letter from E.

His admissions as to his weekly participation in promiscuous homosexual acts and his current receipt of treatment for his \"ongoing\" schizophreniform disorder were sufficient to justify the referral of the application to DISCR for an expanded investigation.  Therefore, the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of plaintiff Crawford \"with respect to his claim regarding DISCO's refusal to grant his clearance because of his 'homosexual activity and susceptibility to coercion.' \"    High Tech Gays, 668 F.Supp. at 1379.

Beller, 632 F.2d at 808-09.    We stated that in light of the authorities reviewed (at that time), the reasons which led the Supreme Court to protect certain private decisions intimately linked with one's personality suggest that some kind of government regulation of private consensual homosexual behavior may face substantial constitutional challenge.  We further noted that certain cases may require resolution of whether there is a right to engage in consensual homosexual behavior, but that in the instant case (Beller ) involving a military regulation which prohibited homosexual conduct of persons in the service, \"the importance of the government interests furthered, and to some extent the relative impracticality at this time of achieving the Government's goals by regulations which turn more precisely on the facts of an individual case, outweigh whatever heightened solicitude is appropriate for consensual private homosexual conduct.\"    Id. at 810</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> After Hardwick was decided, we were presented with an equal protection challenge to the CIA's policy of allegedly discriminating against homosexuals in making security clearance determinations.

The plaintiff in Dubbs alleged that the CIA had violated her constitutional rights by 1) enforcing a policy of refusing security clearances to all homosexuals and 2) considering homosexual conduct, but not heterosexual conduct, a negative factor in individual security clearance determinations.  With regard to plaintiff's first claim, we expressed no opinion on the constitutionality of the CIA's alleged blanket policy against homosexuals.  Id. at 1119.    Further, since this case involves no allegation of a blanket policy of refusing to issue security clearances to homosexuals, Dubbs' resolution of this first claim is not relevant to this case.  With regard to plaintiff's second claim, we reversed the district court's grant of summary judgment to the defendant because the district court had improperly refused to consider the merits of plaintiff's constitutional claim.  Id. at 1119-20.    However, we did not address the merits of plaintiff's constitutional challenge nor did we express an opinion on the applicable level of scrutiny.  Id.

Id. at 711</p>\n        <p>Judge Norris' concurrence in Watkins II, joined by Judge Canby, expresses the opinion that homosexuals constitute a suspect class, arguing that the Hardwick Court's concerns about substantive due process have little or no relevance to equal protection doctrine.

We disagree.</p>\n        <p>As discussed in the main text of this case, under Bolling the equal protection guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment are applied to federal statutes, regulations, and actions through the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause.
