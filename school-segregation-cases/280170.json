It is the settled rule that a change in statutory law is to be applied to cases in litigation.

Richmond School Board, 416 U.S. 696, 94 S.Ct. 2006, 40 L.Ed.2d 476 (1974) involved the issue whether &#167; 718 of the Education Amendments of 1972, which granted authority to federal courts to award a reasonable attorneys' fee in school desegregation cases, applied to a case where the propriety of the fee award was pending resolution on appeal when the statute became law.  The Supreme Court held that it did.  Id. at 710-724.
