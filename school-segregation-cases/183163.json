GRAVES, JR., Circuit Judge:\n      In this nearly fifty-year-old desegregation case, the United States\nappeals the district court’s order implementing a freedom of choice plan\nintended to desegregate the formerly de jure African-American middle school\nand high school in the Cleveland School District (“the District”). We reverse\nand remand for further consideration of the desegregation remedy.\n                 I. Factual and Procedural Background\n      The Cleveland School District encompasses the southeast area of Bolivar\nCounty in the Mississippi Delta, including the city of Cleveland, the towns of\nBoyle, Renova, and Merigold, and outlying areas. Most of the District’s schools\n\f                                      No. 13-60464\nare located in Cleveland, a city of approximately 12,000 people. The District\nis one of many school districts in Mississippi that previously practiced race-\nbased de jure segregation in education. Under that system, African-American\nstudents were required to attend schools on the east side of the railroad tracks\nthat run north to south through Cleveland, while white students attended\nschools on the west side of town. The original plaintiffs in this case sued in\n1965 to enjoin the District from maintaining segregated schools, and the\ndistrict court ordered the District to submit a desegregation plan to dismantle\nthe dual school system and remedy the continuing effects of segregation. The\nUnited States intervened in 1985. Over the ensuing decades, the district court\nhas supervised the desegregation efforts in the District through a series of\ndesegregation orders. 1 The present appeal concerns D.M. Smith Middle School\nand East Side High School, the formerly de jure African-American junior high\nand high school in the District, which are located near each other on the east\nside of town. 2 The formerly de jure white junior high and high school, Margaret\nGreen Junior High and Cleveland High School, are located adjacent to each\nother on the west side of town.\n       The United States filed a motion in May 2011, arguing that the District\nwas not in compliance with the extant desegregation orders and requesting\nfurther relief. The desegregation orders contain a number of components, but\nthe United States challenged only the District’s non-compliance with the\nstudent assignment and faculty assignment components of the desegregation\n\n\n\n       1 The details of these orders are recounted at length in the district court’s thorough\nMarch 28, 2012 memorandum opinion. See Cowan ex rel. Johnson v. Bolivar Cnty. Bd. of\nEduc. (Cowan I), 914 F. Supp. 2d 801 (N.D. Miss. 2012). We discuss only those portions of the\norders that are relevant to the instant appeal.\n       2 Under the de jure system, all African-Americans in grades 7-12 attended a single\n\nschool, now East Side High School. A second junior high, D.M. Smith Middle School was\nconstructed later, on a site behind East Side High School.\n                                             2\n\f                                  No. 13-60464\norders. In relevant part, with regard to junior high and high school student\nassignment, the previous desegregation orders created east and west\nattendance zones, bounded by the railroad tracks in the center of town: all\nstudents living west of the tracks attended Margaret Green Junior High and\nCleveland High School, while all students living east of the tracks attended\nD.M. Smith Middle School and East Side High School. The orders also included\na majority-to-minority transfer policy requiring the District to encourage and\npermit students in the racial majority at one school to transfer if they would\nbe in the racial minority at the other school.          The faculty assignment\ncomponent of the desegregation orders provided that the faculty and\nprofessional staff at each school should reflect the districtwide ratio of minority\nand nonminority faculty and professional staff to the extent feasible.\n      In a thorough, well-reasoned March 28, 2012 memorandum opinion, the\ndistrict court analyzed whether the District was in compliance with the\nstudent assignment and faculty assignment components of the desegregation\norders. Cowan ex rel. Johnson v. Bolivar Cnty. Bd. of Educ. (Cowan I), 914 F.\nSupp. 2d 801 (N.D. Miss. 2012). It determined that the District had achieved\ndesegregation in many of its schools, particularly within the District’s six\nelementary schools. It noted the District’s success in attracting white students\nto its formerly de jure African-American elementary schools through magnet\nprograms and magnet schools. It also found that the District’s formerly de jure\nwhite junior high and high school, Margaret Green Junior High School and\nCleveland High School, were desegregated. However, the district court found\nthat a new plan was needed to eliminate segregation at D.M. Smith Middle\nSchool and East Side High School, which have never been meaningfully\ndesegregated but have always been and continue to be racially identifiable,\nalmost exclusively black schools. Although white enrollment in the District\nhas held steady around 29% in recent years, the student population at D.M.\n                                        3\n\f                                   No. 13-60464\nSmith and East Side High is now and has always been between 98% and 100%\nblack.\n         The District submitted its proposed desegregation plan for the 2012-2013\nacademic year in May 2012. The District proposed to create new magnet\nprograms and revitalize existing magnet programs at D.M. Smith and East\nSide High. The proposed plans consisted of offering specialized or advanced\nclasses only at D.M. Smith Middle School and East Side High School, and\nrecommitting to the International Baccalaureate programs at both schools in\norder to attract students enrolled at Margaret Green Junior High School and\nCleveland High School, and to attract students graduating from the successful\nmagnet programs at the elementary schools. Parts of the District’s plan called\nfor white students to attend D.M. Smith or East Side High for certain classes\nor for part of the day, without enrolling full time at those schools. The United\nStates objected to the District’s plan, claiming that the magnet programs did\nnot and would not attract white students in significant numbers and the\nDistrict’s plan would not meaningfully integrate the schools.        The United\nStates also argued that consolidation of the schools into one junior high and\none high school for the entire District would accomplish the objectives set forth\nby the district court.\n         The district court held a hearing on the adequacy of the District’s\nproposed plan in December 2012.          Beverly Hardy, an elementary school\nprincipal and director of the magnet program, and Maurice Lucas, president of\nthe school board, testified in favor of the District’s plan. Hardy explained how\nthe magnet programs at the schools would work, and Lucas explained why the\nschool board chose its plan, claiming that the magnet programs were likely to\nbe successful.     He also testified that the school board had not considered\nconsolidation. The United States called Reverend Edward Duval, Lenden\nSanders and Tonya Short, parents of children attending East Side High School\n                                         4\n\f                                  No. 13-60464\nand D.M. Smith Middle School. These witnesses opposed the District’s plan,\ngenerally testifying that the schools on the east side of town were not\nacademically challenging for their children, that there was a continuing stigma\nassociated with attending those schools, and that the public consensus was in\nfavor of consolidation.\n      The district court issued its memorandum opinion regarding the\ndesegregation remedy on January 24, 2013. Cowan ex rel. Johnson v. Bolivar\nCnty. Bd. of Educ. (Cowan II), 923 F. Supp. 2d 876 (N.D. Miss. 2013). The\ndistrict court detailed observations from its site visit to the Cleveland schools,\nnoting that D.M. Smith and East Side High had equal or better facilities\ncompared to Margaret Green Junior High and Cleveland High School. The\ndistrict court then rejected both the District’s proposed desegregation plan and\nthe United States’s proposed alternative of consolidation, and adopted a new\nplan not previously suggested. Finding that “the attendance zones, as defined\nby the former railroad tracks in Cleveland, perpetuate vestiges of racial\nsegregation,” the district court adopted a plan that abolished the attendance\nzones and majority-to-minority transfer program and implemented a freedom\nof choice plan that allows each student in the district to choose to attend any\njunior high or high school.\n      Shortly thereafter, the United States filed a Rule 59 motion to alter the\njudgment. It maintained, as it does on appeal, that the freedom of choice plan\nwas constitutionally inadequate and again argued that the appropriate\nsolution was consolidation. The District responded, as it does on appeal, by\ndefending the freedom of choice plan.          It argued that the plan was\nconstitutionally adequate and that the United States had not offered evidence\nthat the plan would not work. It also argued that a mandatory consolidation\nplan would ultimately result in decreased integration due to “white flight” from\nthe District, as mandatory consolidation would lead to white parents leaving\n                                        5\n\f                                No. 13-60464\nthe District or placing their children into private schools. While the Rule 59\nmotion was pending, the District submitted pre-enrollment data for the 2013-\n14 school year.   As of April 1, 2013, approximately three-quarters of the\nDistrict’s eligible junior high and high school students had pre-enrolled. Of\nthose that had pre-enrolled, not one white student chose to pre-enroll at East\nSide High School, but 216 African-American students pre-enrolled at that\nschool.   Similarly, not a single white student pre-enrolled at D.M. Smith\nMiddle School, but 134 African-American students pre-enrolled there.        In\naddition to noting the obvious racial imbalance suggested by this data, the\nUnited States pointed out that, depending upon where the undecided African-\nAmerican students chose to pre-enroll, there was a real possibility that\nMargaret Green Junior High School and Cleveland High School might be\noversubscribed and D.M. Smith Middle School and East Side High School\nwould not have enough students to operate economically. The district court\ndenied the Rule 59 motion. It stated that it had considered the pre-enrollment\ndata and the response of the United States but that it would not alter its\njudgment. In reaching this conclusion, the district court stated that it “gives\ncredence to the testimony of the African-American president of the District’s\nschool board, Maurice Lucas.” Mr. Lucas had testified that he did not support\nconsolidation, because it was not his intention to eliminate East Side High\nSchool and that he believed the identity of the two high schools was important\nto the community.\n      The United States appeals the district court’s order instituting the\nfreedom of choice plan as a desegregation remedy. Neither the United States\nnor the District appealed the district court’s March 28, 2012 memorandum\nopinion, which found that the District had achieved integration at many of its\n\n\n\n\n                                      6\n\f                                        No. 13-60464\nschools but found continuing segregation at East Side High School and D.M.\nSmith Middle School. 3\n                                        II. Analysis\n       “Failure on the part of school authorities to implement a constitutionally\nprescribed unitary school system brings into play the full panoply of the trial\ncourt’s remedial power.” Valley v. Rapides Parish Sch. Bd., 702 F.2d 1221,\n1225 (5th Cir. 1983) (citing Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of\nEducation, 402 U.S. 1 (1971)). We review the district court’s implementation\nof desegregation remedies for abuse of discretion. Id. We review conclusions\nof law de novo, and findings of fact for clear error. Id. Here, neither party\nchallenged the district court’s determinations that a new plan should be\nadministered to desegregate D.M. Smith Middle School and East Side High\nSchool, and that further remedies were not necessary in the District’s\nelementary schools. On appeal, the United States asks us to remand so that\nthe district court can consider alternative plans to desegregate D.M. Smith and\nEast Side High, including consolidation, while the District requests that we\naffirm the implementation of the freedom of choice plan.\n       In desegregation cases, the objective is “to eliminate from the public\nschools all vestiges of state-imposed segregation.” Swann, 402 U.S. at 15. “The\ntransition to a unitary, nonracial system of public education was and is the\nultimate end to be brought about. . . .” Green v. Cnty. Sch. Bd. of New Kent\n\n\n\n       3 The district court also determined that, despite its good faith effort, the District was\nnot in compliance with the faculty assignment component of the extant desegregation orders.\nThe district court ordered the District to submit a plan with “real prospects for achieving a\nratio of African-American to Caucasian teachers and administration in each school to\napproximate the race ratio throughout the districtwide school system.” However, the\nsubsequent order regarding the desegregation remedy failed to address faculty assignment,\nan issue the parties only briefly mention on appeal. On remand, the district court should\nclarify the status of this issue, particularly whether there is a continuing violation, and if so,\nthe remedy to be implemented.\n                                                7\n\f                                  No. 13-60464\nCnty., Va., 391 U.S. 430, 436 (1968). The duty is not simply to eliminate\nexpress racial segregation: where de jure segregation existed, the school\ndistrict’s duty is to eliminate its effects “root and branch.” Id. at 437-38. Now,\nsix decades after Brown v. Topeka Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954),\n“[t]he burden on a school board today is to come forward with a plan that\npromises realistically to work, and promises realistically to work now.” Green,\n391 U.S. at 439; see Davis v. E. Baton Rouge Parish Sch. Bd., 721 F.2d 1425,\n1437 (5th Cir. 1983).\n      A freedom of choice plan is not necessarily an unreasonable remedy for\neliminating the vestiges of state-sponsored segregation, but it has historically\nproven to be an ineffective desegregation tool. See Green, 391 U.S. at 439-40.\nLikewise, some racially homogeneous schools within a school system do not\nnecessarily violate the federal Constitution. See Swann, 402 U.S. at 25-26;\nValley, 702 F.2d at 1226; see also Flax v. Potts, 915 F.2d 155, 160-62 (5th Cir.\n1990). However, “[t]he retention of all-black or virtually all-black schools\nwithin a dual system is nonetheless unacceptable where reasonable\nalternatives may be implemented.” Valley, 702 F.2d at 1226. The retention of\nsingle-race schools may be particularly unacceptable where, as here, the\ndistrict is relatively small, the schools at issue are a single junior high school\nand a single high school, which have never been meaningfully desegregated\nand which are located less than a mile and a half away from the only other\njunior high school and high school in the district, and where the original\npurpose of this configuration of schools was to segregate the races. Apart from\nthe fact that Cleveland has not sought a declaration of unitary status and has\nnot challenged the district court’s conclusion that further remedies are\nnecessary, on the record now before us, the situation in Cleveland is\ndistinguishable from those where we have found that the retention of some\none-race schools did not preclude a declaration of unitary status. See Flax, 915\n                                        8\n\f                                 No. 13-60464\nF.2d at 161 (finding that fourteen schools that were over 80% black did not\npreclude declaration of unitary status in large urban district with 98 total\nschools, where it was “essentially uncontroverted” that the district had\nsucceeded in “removing the vestiges of the dual system”); Ross v. Houston\nIndependent School District, 699 F.2d 218, 226-28 (5th Cir. 1983) (finding that\nthirty-three schools that were 90% black did not preclude declaration of\nunitary status in large urban district with 226 schools facing “unusual,\nperhaps unique, problems,” including rapidly changing demographics and\nhousing patterns).\n      We acknowledge that confecting a remedy in these types of cases can be\nespecially difficult. No matter how noble the effort, the effect can be less than\nadequate.   Unlike the district court’s earlier opinion finding that further\nremedies were necessary, the remedial order adopting the freedom of choice\nplan lacks explanation. While we are “mindful that the scope of a district\ncourt’s equitable power to remedy past wrongs is broad, for breadth and\nflexibility are inherent in equitable remedies,” Valley, 702 F.2d at 1225\n(internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Swann, 402 U.S. at 15), we are\nunable to evaluate the soundness or reasoning of the decision, where it is not\ndiscussed in the opinion. Although we do not hold that the freedom of choice\nplan is necessarily inadequate, there are apparent deficiencies in the plan that\nwere not addressed by the district court. First, there was no evidence or\nexplanation indicating that the freedom of choice plan was likely to work, and\nall the available empirical evidence indicates that the plan is not likely to\ncontribute to meaningful desegregation at D.M. Smith Middle School or East\nSide High School.      African-American students residing in the eastern\nattendance zone have availed themselves of the now abolished majority-to-\nminority transfer policy over the years, but in the nearly five decades in which\nthe District has been under federal court supervision, not one white student\n                                       9\n\f                                  No. 13-60464\nhas ever voluntarily transferred to D.M. Smith Middle School or East Side\nHigh School. The pre-enrollment data for the 2012-13 school year, submitted\nwhile the Rule 59 motion was pending, indicated that the order had no effect\non the status quo: no white student pre-enrolled at D.M. Smith or East Side\nHigh. Albeit not part of the record before the district court, the District at oral\nargument acknowledged that the plan has now been in effect for over a year,\nand no white student has enrolled at D.M. Smith or East Side High. In\ndefending the freedom of choice plan on appeal, the District does not even\nforcefully argue that the plan is likely to work at D.M. Smith Middle School\nand East Side High School, instead focusing on its successes at other schools\nin the district. Lastly, the district court did not explain its reasoning for\nrejecting the District’s proposed desegregation plan of revitalizing and\nexpanding magnet programs at the black schools, or the United States’s\nproposed remedy of consolidation, and instead adopted a freedom of choice plan\nthat neither party had suggested. The district court encouraged the District\nto continue to strengthen its magnet programs but did not order the magnet\nprogram plan to be implemented.\n      “The findings and conclusions we review must be expressed with\nsufficient particularity to allow us to determine rather than speculate that the\nlaw has been correctly applied.” Davis v. E. Baton Rouge Parish Sch. Bd., 570\nF.2d 1260, 1263-64 (5th Cir. 1978). The district court did not make clear its\nconclusion that the problem of the continuing racial isolation and racial\nidentifiability of D.M. Smith Middle School and East Side High School would\nbe resolved by the implementation of a freedom of choice plan. We do not hold\nthat the freedom of choice plan is constitutionally inadequate or could form no\npart of a desegregation plan. But the district court should consider, review and\nexplain why it is discarding some remedies in favor of others. If the district\ncourt concluded that the freedom of choice plan was likely to be successful, it\n                                        10\n\f                                  No. 13-60464\nmust explain why and consider the contradictory evidence in the record. On\nappeal, the District strongly implies that, essentially, there is no more that it\ncan do to desegregate D.M. Smith and East Side High. The district court,\nhowever, concluded that the District should remain under federal supervision\nand ordered the District to propose a new desegregation plan for those two\nschools. Further, the District has not moved for unitary status. However, if\nthe district court’s remedy is premised on a conclusion that, aside from the\nfreedom of choice plan, there is nothing more that the District can or should do\nto desegregate D.M. Smith and East Side High, that conclusion should be\njustified. If the district court’s order is premised on avoiding “white flight” that\nmay occur as a result of other proposed remedies such as consolidation, it must\ngrapple with the complexities of that issue. See United States v. Pittman by\nPittman, 808 F.2d 385, 391 (5th Cir. 1987) (noting that white flight may be one\nlegitimate concern “when choosing among constitutionally permissible plans”\nbut “cannot be accepted as a reason for achieving less than complete uprooting\nof the dual public school system”). While we do not require the district court\nto provide us a granular report regarding every option considered, the district\ncourt should sort through the various proposed remedies, exclude those that\nare inadequate or infeasible and ultimately adopt the one that is most likely to\nachieve the desired effect: desegregation.\n      Given the available statistics showing that not a single white student\nchose to enroll at D.M Smith or East Side High after the district court’s order,\nand that historically, over the course of multiple decades, no white student has\never chosen to enroll at D.M. Smith or East Side High, the district court’s\nconclusion that a freedom of choice plan was the most appropriate\ndesegregation remedy at those schools certainly needed to be expressed with\nsufficient particularity to enable us to review it. See Davis, 570 F.2d at 1263-\n64.

GRAVES, JR., Circuit Judge:\n      In this nearly fifty-year-old desegregation case, the United States\nappeals the district court’s order implementing a freedom of choice plan\nintended to desegregate the formerly de jure African-American middle school\nand high school in the Cleveland School District (“the District”). We reverse\nand remand for further consideration of the desegregation remedy.\n                 I. Factual and Procedural Background\n      The Cleveland School District encompasses the southeast area of Bolivar\nCounty in the Mississippi Delta, including the city of Cleveland, the towns of\nBoyle, Renova, and Merigold, and outlying areas. Most of the District’s schools\n\f                                      No. 13-60464\nare located in Cleveland, a city of approximately 12,000 people. The District\nis one of many school districts in Mississippi that previously practiced race-\nbased de jure segregation in education. Under that system, African-American\nstudents were required to attend schools on the east side of the railroad tracks\nthat run north to south through Cleveland, while white students attended\nschools on the west side of town. The original plaintiffs in this case sued in\n1965 to enjoin the District from maintaining segregated schools, and the\ndistrict court ordered the District to submit a desegregation plan to dismantle\nthe dual school system and remedy the continuing effects of segregation. The\nUnited States intervened in 1985. Over the ensuing decades, the district court\nhas supervised the desegregation efforts in the District through a series of\ndesegregation orders. 1 The present appeal concerns D.M. Smith Middle School\nand East Side High School, the formerly de jure African-American junior high\nand high school in the District, which are located near each other on the east\nside of town. 2 The formerly de jure white junior high and high school, Margaret\nGreen Junior High and Cleveland High School, are located adjacent to each\nother on the west side of town.\n       The United States filed a motion in May 2011, arguing that the District\nwas not in compliance with the extant desegregation orders and requesting\nfurther relief. The desegregation orders contain a number of components, but\nthe United States challenged only the District’s non-compliance with the\nstudent assignment and faculty assignment components of the desegregation\n\n\n\n       1 The details of these orders are recounted at length in the district court’s thorough\nMarch 28, 2012 memorandum opinion. See Cowan ex rel. Johnson v. Bolivar Cnty. Bd. of\nEduc. (Cowan I), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">914</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">801</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (N.D. Miss. 2012). We discuss only those portions of the\norders that are relevant to the instant appeal.\n       2 Under the de jure system, all African-Americans in grades 7-12 attended a single\n\nschool, now East Side High School. A second junior high, D.M. Smith Middle School was\nconstructed later, on a site behind East Side High School.\n                                             2\n\f                                  No. 13-60464\norders. In relevant part, with regard to junior high and high school student\nassignment, the previous desegregation orders created east and west\nattendance zones, bounded by the railroad tracks in the center of town: all\nstudents living west of the tracks attended Margaret Green Junior High and\nCleveland High School, while all students living east of the tracks attended\nD.M. Smith Middle School and East Side High School. The orders also included\na majority-to-minority transfer policy requiring the District to encourage and\npermit students in the racial majority at one school to transfer if they would\nbe in the racial minority at the other school.          The faculty assignment\ncomponent of the desegregation orders provided that the faculty and\nprofessional staff at each school should reflect the districtwide ratio of minority\nand nonminority faculty and professional staff to the extent feasible.\n      In a thorough, well-reasoned March 28, 2012 memorandum opinion, the\ndistrict court analyzed whether the District was in compliance with the\nstudent assignment and faculty assignment components of the desegregation\norders. Cowan ex rel. Johnson v. Bolivar Cnty. Bd. of Educ. (Cowan I), 914 F.\nSupp. 2d 801 (N.D. Miss. 2012). It determined that the District had achieved\ndesegregation in many of its schools, particularly within the District’s six\nelementary schools. It noted the District’s success in attracting white students\nto its formerly de jure African-American elementary schools through magnet\nprograms and magnet schools. It also found that the District’s formerly de jure\nwhite junior high and high school, Margaret Green Junior High School and\nCleveland High School, were desegregated. However, the district court found\nthat a new plan was needed to eliminate segregation at D.M. Smith Middle\nSchool and East Side High School, which have never been meaningfully\ndesegregated but have always been and continue to be racially identifiable,\nalmost exclusively black schools. Although white enrollment in the District\nhas held steady around 29% in recent years, the student population at D.M.\n                                        3\n\f                                   No. 13-60464\nSmith and East Side High is now and has always been between 98% and 100%\nblack.\n         The District submitted its proposed desegregation plan for the 2012-2013\nacademic year in May 2012. The District proposed to create new magnet\nprograms and revitalize existing magnet programs at D.M. Smith and East\nSide High. The proposed plans consisted of offering specialized or advanced\nclasses only at D.M. Smith Middle School and East Side High School, and\nrecommitting to the International Baccalaureate programs at both schools in\norder to attract students enrolled at Margaret Green Junior High School and\nCleveland High School, and to attract students graduating from the successful\nmagnet programs at the elementary schools. Parts of the District’s plan called\nfor white students to attend D.M. Smith or East Side High for certain classes\nor for part of the day, without enrolling full time at those schools. The United\nStates objected to the District’s plan, claiming that the magnet programs did\nnot and would not attract white students in significant numbers and the\nDistrict’s plan would not meaningfully integrate the schools.        The United\nStates also argued that consolidation of the schools into one junior high and\none high school for the entire District would accomplish the objectives set forth\nby the district court.\n         The district court held a hearing on the adequacy of the District’s\nproposed plan in December 2012.          Beverly Hardy, an elementary school\nprincipal and director of the magnet program, and Maurice Lucas, president of\nthe school board, testified in favor of the District’s plan. Hardy explained how\nthe magnet programs at the schools would work, and Lucas explained why the\nschool board chose its plan, claiming that the magnet programs were likely to\nbe successful.     He also testified that the school board had not considered\nconsolidation. The United States called Reverend Edward Duval, Lenden\nSanders and Tonya Short, parents of children attending East Side High School\n                                         4\n\f                                  No. 13-60464\nand D.M. Smith Middle School. These witnesses opposed the District’s plan,\ngenerally testifying that the schools on the east side of town were not\nacademically challenging for their children, that there was a continuing stigma\nassociated with attending those schools, and that the public consensus was in\nfavor of consolidation.\n      The district court issued its memorandum opinion regarding the\ndesegregation remedy on January 24, 2013. Cowan ex rel. Johnson v. Bolivar\nCnty. Bd. of Educ. (Cowan II), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">923</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">876</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (N.D. Miss. 2013). The\ndistrict court detailed observations from its site visit to the Cleveland schools,\nnoting that D.M. Smith and East Side High had equal or better facilities\ncompared to Margaret Green Junior High and Cleveland High School. The\ndistrict court then rejected both the District’s proposed desegregation plan and\nthe United States’s proposed alternative of consolidation, and adopted a new\nplan not previously suggested. Finding that “the attendance zones, as defined\nby the former railroad tracks in Cleveland, perpetuate vestiges of racial\nsegregation,” the district court adopted a plan that abolished the attendance\nzones and majority-to-minority transfer program and implemented a freedom\nof choice plan that allows each student in the district to choose to attend any\njunior high or high school.\n      Shortly thereafter, the United States filed a Rule 59 motion to alter the\njudgment. It maintained, as it does on appeal, that the freedom of choice plan\nwas constitutionally inadequate and again argued that the appropriate\nsolution was consolidation. The District responded, as it does on appeal, by\ndefending the freedom of choice plan.          It argued that the plan was\nconstitutionally adequate and that the United States had not offered evidence\nthat the plan would not work. It also argued that a mandatory consolidation\nplan would ultimately result in decreased integration due to “white flight” from\nthe District, as mandatory consolidation would lead to white parents leaving\n                                        5\n\f                                No. 13-60464\nthe District or placing their children into private schools. While the Rule 59\nmotion was pending, the District submitted pre-enrollment data for the 2013-\n14 school year.   As of April 1, 2013, approximately three-quarters of the\nDistrict’s eligible junior high and high school students had pre-enrolled. Of\nthose that had pre-enrolled, not one white student chose to pre-enroll at East\nSide High School, but 216 African-American students pre-enrolled at that\nschool.   Similarly, not a single white student pre-enrolled at D.M. Smith\nMiddle School, but 134 African-American students pre-enrolled there.        In\naddition to noting the obvious racial imbalance suggested by this data, the\nUnited States pointed out that, depending upon where the undecided African-\nAmerican students chose to pre-enroll, there was a real possibility that\nMargaret Green Junior High School and Cleveland High School might be\noversubscribed and D.M. Smith Middle School and East Side High School\nwould not have enough students to operate economically. The district court\ndenied the Rule 59 motion. It stated that it had considered the pre-enrollment\ndata and the response of the United States but that it would not alter its\njudgment. In reaching this conclusion, the district court stated that it “gives\ncredence to the testimony of the African-American president of the District’s\nschool board, Maurice Lucas.” Mr. Lucas had testified that he did not support\nconsolidation, because it was not his intention to eliminate East Side High\nSchool and that he believed the identity of the two high schools was important\nto the community.\n      The United States appeals the district court’s order instituting the\nfreedom of choice plan as a desegregation remedy. Neither the United States\nnor the District appealed the district court’s March 28, 2012 memorandum\nopinion, which found that the District had achieved integration at many of its\n\n\n\n\n                                      6\n\f                                        No. 13-60464\nschools but found continuing segregation at East Side High School and D.M.\nSmith Middle School. 3\n                                        II.

Here, neither party\nchallenged the district court’s determinations that a new plan should be\nadministered to desegregate D.M.

On appeal, the United States asks us to remand so that\nthe district court can consider alternative plans to desegregate D.M. Smith and\nEast Side High, including consolidation, while the District requests that we\naffirm the implementation of the freedom of choice plan.\n       In desegregation cases, the objective is “to eliminate from the public\nschools all vestiges of state-imposed segregation.” Swann, 402 U.S. at 15. “The\ntransition to a unitary, nonracial system of public education was and is the\nultimate end to be brought about. . . .” Green v.

See Green, 391 U.S. at 439-40.\nLikewise, some racially homogeneous schools within a school system do not\nnecessarily violate the federal Constitution. See Swann, 402 U.S. at 25-26;\nValley, 702 F.2d at 1226; see also Flax v. Potts, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"548703\"><a href=\"/opinion/548703/arlene-flax-etc-v-ws-potts-fort-worth-independent-school-district-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">915</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">155</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 160-62 (5th Cir.\n1990). However, “[t]he retention of all-black or virtually all-black schools\nwithin a dual system is nonetheless unacceptable where reasonable\nalternatives may be implemented.” Valley, 702 F.2d at 1226. The retention of\nsingle-race schools may be particularly unacceptable where, as here, the\ndistrict is relatively small, the schools at issue are a single junior high school\nand a single high school, which have never been meaningfully desegregated\nand which are located less than a mile and a half away from the only other\njunior high school and high school in the district, and where the original\npurpose of this configuration of schools was to segregate the races. Apart from\nthe fact that Cleveland has not sought a declaration of unitary status and has\nnot challenged the district court’s conclusion that further remedies are\nnecessary, on the record now before us, the situation in Cleveland is\ndistinguishable from those where we have found that the retention of some\none-race schools did not preclude a declaration of unitary status.

No matter how noble the effort, the effect can be less than\nadequate.   Unlike the district court’s earlier opinion finding that further\nremedies were necessary, the remedial order adopting the freedom of choice\nplan lacks explanation. While we are “mindful that the scope of a district\ncourt’s equitable power to remedy past wrongs is broad, for breadth and\nflexibility are inherent in equitable remedies,” Valley, 702 F.2d at 1225\n(internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Swann, 402 U.S. at 15), we are\nunable to evaluate the soundness or reasoning of the decision, where it is not\ndiscussed in the opinion. Although we do not hold that the freedom of choice\nplan is necessarily inadequate, there are apparent deficiencies in the plan that\nwere not addressed by the district court. First, there was no evidence or\nexplanation indicating that the freedom of choice plan was likely to work, and\nall the available empirical evidence indicates that the plan is not likely to\ncontribute to meaningful desegregation at D.M. Smith Middle School or East\nSide High School.      African-American students residing in the eastern\nattendance zone have availed themselves of the now abolished majority-to-\nminority transfer policy over the years, but in the nearly five decades in which\nthe District has been under federal court supervision, not one white student\n                                       9\n\f                                  No. 13-60464\nhas ever voluntarily transferred to D.M. Smith Middle School or East Side\nHigh School. The pre-enrollment data for the 2012-13 school year, submitted\nwhile the Rule 59 motion was pending, indicated that the order had no effect\non the status quo: no white student pre-enrolled at D.M. Smith or East Side\nHigh. Albeit not part of the record before the district court, the District at oral\nargument acknowledged that the plan has now been in effect for over a year,\nand no white student has enrolled at D.M. Smith or East Side High. In\ndefending the freedom of choice plan on appeal, the District does not even\nforcefully argue that the plan is likely to work at D.M. Smith Middle School\nand East Side High School, instead focusing on its successes at other schools\nin the district. Lastly, the district court did not explain its reasoning for\nrejecting the District’s proposed desegregation plan of revitalizing and\nexpanding magnet programs at the black schools, or the United States’s\nproposed remedy of consolidation, and instead adopted a freedom of choice plan\nthat neither party had suggested. The district court encouraged the District\nto continue to strengthen its magnet programs but did not order the magnet\nprogram plan to be implemented.\n      “The findings and conclusions we review must be expressed with\nsufficient particularity to allow us to determine rather than speculate that the\nlaw has been correctly applied.” Davis v. E. Baton Rouge Parish Sch. Bd., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"353200\"><a href=\"/opinion/353200/clifford-eugene-davis-jr-dr-dorsay-bryant-and-alphonso-o-potter/\"><span class=\"volume\">570</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1260</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1263-64 (5th Cir. 1978). The district court did not make clear its\nconclusion that the problem of the continuing racial isolation and racial\nidentifiability of D.M. Smith Middle School and East Side High School would\nbe resolved by the implementation of a freedom of choice plan. We do not hold\nthat the freedom of choice plan is constitutionally inadequate or could form no\npart of a desegregation plan. But the district court should consider, review and\nexplain why it is discarding some remedies in favor of others. If the district\ncourt concluded that the freedom of choice plan was likely to be successful, it\n                                        10\n\f                                  No. 13-60464\nmust explain why and consider the contradictory evidence in the record. On\nappeal, the District strongly implies that, essentially, there is no more that it\ncan do to desegregate D.M. Smith and East Side High. The district court,\nhowever, concluded that the District should remain under federal supervision\nand ordered the District to propose a new desegregation plan for those two\nschools. Further, the District has not moved for unitary status. However, if\nthe district court’s remedy is premised on a conclusion that, aside from the\nfreedom of choice plan, there is nothing more that the District can or should do\nto desegregate D.M. Smith and East Side High, that conclusion should be\njustified. If the district court’s order is premised on avoiding “white flight” that\nmay occur as a result of other proposed remedies such as consolidation, it must\ngrapple with the complexities of that issue.

While we do not require the district court\nto provide us a granular report regarding every option considered, the district\ncourt should sort through the various proposed remedies, exclude those that\nare inadequate or infeasible and ultimately adopt the one that is most likely to\nachieve the desired effect: desegregation.\n      Given the available statistics showing that not a single white student\nchose to enroll at D.M Smith or East Side High after the district court’s order,\nand that historically, over the course of multiple decades, no white student has\never chosen to enroll at D.M. Smith or East Side High, the district court’s\nconclusion that a freedom of choice plan was the most appropriate\ndesegregation remedy at those schools certainly needed to be expressed with\nsufficient particularity to enable us to review it. See Davis, 570 F.2d at 1263-\n64. We therefore reverse and remand for a more explicit explanation of the\n                                        11\n\f                                 No. 13-60464\nreasons for adopting the freedom of choice plan, and/or for consideration of the\nalternative desegregation plans proposed by the parties, as appropriate.\n                               III. Conclusion\n      For the foregoing reasons, we REVERSE and REMAND to the district\ncourt for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                      12\n\f</pre>",
