in Basham’s favor on the defamation, invasion of privacy, and theft\r\nclaims and awarded her $260,000 in actual damages, $30,000 in additional/exemplary\r\ndamages, and $40,000 in attorney’s fees.

class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b><span>Background</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Basham was the bookkeeper for the\r\nBeaumont Ranch.  Because of financial difficulties at the Ranch, Linda Beaumont,\r\na co-owner of the Ranch, told Basham to give vendors false information about\r\nwhen they would be paid.  After several months in an unpleasant work\r\nenvironment, Basham gave two weeks’ notice.  About two weeks after Basham’s\r\ndeparture, her nephew (and employee of the Ranch) Bryan Williams broke into her\r\nhouse at Beaumont’s direction, looking for items belonging to the Ranch which Beaumont claimed Basham had stolen.  Williams apparently broke into Basham’s home on four\r\nseparate occasions, being accompanied on the last occasion by Roni Beaumont\r\nBellhouse, Beaumont’s daughter.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Beaumont filed a report with the\r\nSheriff’s Department alleging that Basham had stolen one million dollars from\r\nthe Ranch.  An investigation was conducted, but no charges were ever brought\r\nagainst Basham.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Several witnesses testified about\r\nvarious statements which were made around the community or to others by\r\ntelephone regarding alleged embezzlement by Basham and Basham’s alleged\r\ninvolvement in a sexual relationship with a minor.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          The court granted Appellants’ motion\r\nfor directed verdict as to Basham’s claims for wrongful termination, and\r\nintentional infliction of emotion distress.  The court also granted Basham’s\r\noral motion to dismiss her sexual harassment claim against the Ranch.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          The jury found that Beaumont had\r\nslandered Basham but failed to find that Bellhouse had.  The jury found that\r\nboth Beaumont and Bellhouse had committed theft and invasion of privacy and had\r\nacted with malice.  The jury awarded damages on the slander claim of $50,000\r\nfor loss of reputation, $100,000 for past mental anguish, and $25,000 for\r\nfuture mental anguish.  The jury awarded damages on the theft claim of $25,000\r\nagainst Beaumont and $10,000 against Bellhouse.  The jury awarded damages on\r\nthe invasion of privacy claim of $25,000 against Beaumont and $25,000 against\r\nBellhouse.  The jury awarded additional/exemplary damages against Beaumont of $10,000 for slander, $10,000 for theft, and $10,000 for invasion of privacy. \r\nThe jury failed to find that Bellhouse should pay additional/exemplary damages. \r\nThe jury awarded attorney’s fees of $40,000 on Basham’s theft claim.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b><span>Invasion of Privacy</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Appellants contend in their seventh\r\nissue that (1) there is no evidence that Beaumont committed an invasion of\r\nprivacy and (2) the court erroneously permitted a double recovery for theft and\r\ninvasion of privacy because Basham suffered the same injury from the invasion\r\nof privacy as from the theft. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          When we conduct a no-evidence review,\r\nwe must determine “whether the evidence at trial would enable reasonable and\r\nfair-minded people to reach the verdict under review.”  <i>City of Keller v. Wilson</i>, 168 S.W.3d 802, 827 (Tex. 2005).  We “must credit favorable evidence\r\nif reasonable jurors could, and disregard contrary evidence unless reasonable\r\njurors could not.”  <i>Id.</i></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          The elements of </span><span lang=\"EN-CA\">a claim</span><span lang=\"EN-CA\"> </span><span>for\r\ninvasion of privacy are (1) the defendant intentionally intruded on the\r\nplaintiff’s solitude, seclusion, or private affairs; and (2) the intrusion\r\nwould be highly offensive to a reasonable person.  <i>See Valenzuela v. Aquino</i>,\r\n853 S.W.2d 512, 513 (Tex. 1993) (citing <span>Restatement\r\n(Second) of Torts</span> § 652B (1977)); <i>Russell v. Am. Real Estate Corp.</i>,\r\n89 S.W.3d 204, 212 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 2002, no pet.); <i>see also Clayton\r\nv. Wisener</i>, 190 S.W.3d 685, 696 (Tex. App.—Tyler 2005, pet. denied).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          The jury found that Beaumont committed\r\nan invasion of privacy and also engaged in a conspiracy to commit an invasion\r\nof privacy.  Appellants do not challenge this conspiracy finding or the finding\r\nthe Bellhouse committed an invasion of privacy.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          “Once a conspiracy is proven, each\r\nco-conspirator ‘is responsible for all acts done by any of the conspirators in\r\nfurtherance of the unlawful combination.’”  <i>Carroll v. Timmers Chevrolet,\r\nInc.</i>, 592 S.W.2d 922, 926 (Tex. 1979) (quoting <i>State v. Standard Oil Co.</i>,\r\n130 Tex. 313, 107 S.W.2d 550, 559 (1937)); <i>accord Operation Rescue-Nat’l v.\r\nPlanned Parenthood of Houston &amp; Se. Tex.</i>, 975 S.W.2d 546, 561 (Tex. 1998);\r\n<i>Goldstein v. Mortenson</i>, 113 S.W.3d 769, 779 (Tex. App.—Austin 2003, no\r\npet.).  Thus, if Bellhouse is liable for an invasion of privacy, then Beaumont is liable as well.  <i>See id.</i></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Appellants contend that they are not\r\nliable for invasion of privacy because Basham suffered the same injury from the\r\ninvasion of privacy as from the theft.  We disagree.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Under the “one satisfaction rule,” Texas law prohibits a “double recovery.”  <i>See Crown Life Ins. Co. v. Casteel</i>, 22\r\nS.W.3d 378, 390 (Tex. 2000); <i>Betts v. Reed</i>, 165 S.W.3d 862, 873 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2005, no pet.); <i>Baribeau v. Gustafson</i>, 107 S.W.3d 52, 60 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2003, pet. denied).  “This rule applies when multiple defendants\r\ncommit the same act as well as when defendants commit technically different\r\nacts that result in a single injury.”  <i>Crown Life Ins.</i>, 22 S.W.3d at\r\n390.  Here, Appellants contend the latter applies.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Nevertheless, if a plaintiff pleads\r\nalternate theories of liability, a judgment awarding damages on each alternate\r\ntheory may be upheld if the theories depend on separate and distinct injuries\r\nand if separate and distinct damages findings are made as to each theory.  <i>Baribeau</i>,\r\n107 S.W.3d at 60 (citing <i>Birchfield v. Texarkana Mem’l Hosp.</i>, 747 S.W.2d\r\n361, 367 (Tex. 1987)); <i>Household Credit Servs., Inc. v. Driscol</i>, 989\r\nS.W.2d 72, 80 (Tex. App.—El Paso 1998, pet. denied); <i>Borden, Inc. v. Guerra</i>,\r\n860 S.W.2d 515, 528 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 1993, writ dism’d by agr.).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Here, Basham alleged that an invasion\r\nof privacy was committed each time Williams and/or Bellhouse unlawfully entered\r\nher home to search for property belonging to the Ranch.  The injuries Basham suffered\r\nfrom these invasions of her privacy arose from these intrusions upon her “solitude,\r\nseclusion, or private affairs.”  <i>See Valenzuela</i>, 853 S.W.2d at 513;<i> Clayton</i>,\r\n190 S.W.3d at 696;<i> Russell</i>, 89 S.W.3d at 212; <span>Restatement (Second) of Torts</span> § 652B.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Conversely, the injuries Basham\r\nsuffered because of the thefts of property from her home arose from the\r\n“unlawful appropriations” of her property.  <i>See</i> <span>Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann.</span> § 134.002(2) (Vernon 2005).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          The only element of damages addressed\r\nin the court’s charge with respect to Basham’s invasion of privacy and theft\r\nclaims is mental anguish.  The court expressly instructed the jury in the\r\ncharge to not include in the award of damages for invasion of privacy “an\r\namount for mental anguish, if any, arising from theft.”  The court provided a\r\nsimilar instruction with the damages question for Basham’s theft claim.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Therefore, because Basham suffered separate\r\nand distinct injuries from the invasions of privacy and from the thefts and\r\nbecause the jury made separate and distinct damages findings as to each theory,\r\nwe hold that there was no double recovery.  <i>See Baribeau</i>, 107 S.W.3d at\r\n61; <i>Borden</i>, 860 S.W.2d at 529.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Accordingly, we overrule Appellants’\r\nseventh issue.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b><span>Mental Anguish</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Appellants contend in their third\r\nissue that there is no evidence or factually insufficient evidence to support\r\nthe jury’s award of $210,000 in damages for past and future mental anguish.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          .  .  .  [A]n award of mental anguish\r\ndamages will survive a legal sufficiency challenge when the plaintiffs have\r\nintroduced direct evidence of the nature, duration, and severity of their\r\nmental anguish, thus establishing a substantial disruption in the plaintiffs’\r\ndaily routine.  Such evidence, whether in the form of the claimants’ own\r\ntestimony, that of third parties, or that of experts, is more likely to provide\r\nthe factfinder with adequate details to assess mental anguish claims.  Although\r\nwe stop short of requiring this type of evidence in all cases in which mental\r\nanguish damages are sought, the absence of this type of evidence, particularly\r\nwhen it can be readily supplied or procured by the plaintiff, justifies close\r\njudicial scrutiny of other evidence offered on this element of damages. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          When claimants fail to present direct\r\nevidence of the nature, duration, or severity of their anguish, we apply\r\ntraditional “no evidence” standards to determine whether the record reveals any\r\nevidence of “a high degree of mental pain and distress” that is “more than mere\r\nworry, anxiety, vexation, embarrassment, or anger” to support any award of\r\ndamages.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span> <i>Parkway Co. v. Woodruff</i>, 901 S.W.2d 434,\r\n444 (Tex. 1995); <i>accord Bentley v. Bunton</i>, 94 S.W.3d 561, 606 (Tex. 2002).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Not only must there be evidence of the\r\nexistence of compensable mental anguish, there must also be some evidence to\r\njustify the amount awarded.  We disagree with the court of appeals that “[t]ranslating\r\nmental anguish into dollars is necessarily an arbitrary process for which the\r\njury is given no guidelines.”  While the impossibility of any exact evaluation\r\nof mental anguish requires that juries be given a measure of discretion in\r\nfinding damages, that discretion is limited.  Juries cannot simply pick a\r\nnumber and put it in the blank.  They must find an amount that, in the standard\r\nlanguage of the jury charge, “would fairly and reasonably compensate” for the\r\nloss.  Compensation can only be for mental anguish that causes “substantial\r\ndisruption in . . . daily routine” or “a high degree of mental pain and\r\ndistress.”  There must be evidence that the amount found is fair and reasonable\r\ncompensation, just as there must be evidence to support any other jury\r\nfinding.  Reasonable compensation is no easier to determine than reasonable\r\nbehavior—often it may be harder—but the law requires factfinders to determine\r\nboth.  And the law requires appellate courts to conduct a meaningful\r\nevidentiary review of those determinations.   </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span>Bentley</span></i><span>,\r\n94 S.W.3d at 606 (quoting <i>Saenz v. Fid. &amp; Guar. Ins. Underwriters</i>, 925\r\nS.W.2d 607, 614 (Tex. 1996)) (citations omitted).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Here, the jury awarded Basham $100,000\r\nin damages for past mental anguish on the defamation claim and $25,000 in\r\ndamages for future mental anguish on this claim.  The jury awarded Basham\r\n$25,000 in mental anguish damages against Beaumont and $10,000 against Bellhouse\r\non the theft claim.  Finally, the jury awarded $25,000 in mental anguish damages\r\nagainst Beaumont and $25,000 against Bellhouse on the invasion of privacy claim.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Appellants concede that Basham is\r\nentitled to at least “nominal damages” for the defamatory statements but argue\r\nthat there is no evidence or factually insufficient evidence “justifying more\r\nthan a nominal award.”  They also contend that the award lacks evidentiary\r\nsupport because Basham failed to differentiate in her testimony among the\r\nsymptoms of mental anguish caused by the defamation, those caused by the theft,\r\nand those caused by the invasion of privacy.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Basham testified that, after she was\r\nfired, she went to her son’s basketball game and sat by a friend, but her\r\nfriend “just got up and walked away.”  She noticed that “[e]verybody’s neck was\r\nbreaking to look at me.”  This caused her to feel “very humiliated and\r\nembarrassed.”    Because of this, she left the bleachers and waited in the car\r\nfor the game to be over.  She experienced similar situations at other\r\nbasketball games and at her son’s baseball games.  There was “a lot of\r\nwhispering.”  She was “totally devastated” when Williams told her that Beaumont had told him to spread the rumors about her in town.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Because of the embarrassment and\r\nhumiliation, Basham stopped going to town as much as possible.  She stopped\r\ngoing to her children’s school functions, and she shopped for groceries in\r\nanother town.  She started having anxiety attacks on those occasions when she\r\ndid go to town, experiencing shortness of breath and an accelerated heart\r\nrate.  She had “many” sleepless nights and continued to experience sleeping\r\nproblems up to the date of trial.  She thinks about it “[e]very minute of my\r\nlife.”  Basham testified that her “heart drops” whenever she hears a knock on\r\nher door because she is “thinking what else is Ms. Beaumont going to do to me.”</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Basham ultimately moved to another\r\ntown because she “couldn’t take living there anymore.”  This caused separation\r\nfrom her sons because they chose to stay with their father and remain in their\r\nhometown.  Her oldest son moved back in with her about three years later.  Her\r\nyoungest son moved back in for about six months but ultimately returned to his\r\nfather’s home.  She is still “struggling” with the consequences of her decision\r\nto move.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Basham is no longer able to trust\r\npeople.  She feels “very uncomfortable” in social settings.  She has “basically\r\nbecome isolated” and does not participate in social events held at her new\r\nemployer’s

<i>accord Smith</i>, 96 S.W.3d at 233-34.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Here, the defamation question\r\nessentially identifies three different defamatory statements which Basham\r\nalleges to have been made.  Appellants do not identify any of these statements\r\nas being an invalid basis for recovery either because it is not defamatory as a\r\nmatter of law or because there is no evidence in the record to show that they\r\nmade the statement.  Rather, Appellants argue that the combination of these statements\r\nin a single question presents an issue of “potential error.”  However, the\r\nSupreme Court clearly stated in <i>Smith</i> that the harmless error rule\r\nannounced in <i>Crown Life Insurance</i> and <i>Smith</i> applies only to\r\n“actual errors” and not to “imagined or potential ones.”  <i>See</i> 96 S.W.3d at\r\n235.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Accordingly, we overrule Appellants’\r\nsecond issue.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b><span>Prejudgment Interest</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Appellants contend in their tenth\r\nissue that the court erred by the manner in which it calculated prejudgment\r\ninterest because, as argued in other issues, the amount of compensatory damages\r\nawarded is excessive.  However, we have overruled each of Appellants’ issues\r\nchallenging the amount of compensatory damages awarded.  Accordingly, we\r\noverrule Appellants’ tenth issue.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b><span>Cumulative Harm</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Appellants contend in their eighth\r\nissue that the court committed several errors which resulted in “cumulative\r\nharm” because the court allowed “the case to be tried generally on the issue of\r\nwhether or not Linda Beaumont was a bad person.”</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Appellants argue that the court erred\r\nby: (1) denying their special exceptions; (2) denying their summary judgment\r\nmotion(s); and (3) admitting irrelevant evidence of “bad acts supposedly\r\ncommitted by Beaumont.”  We have already determined that Appellants have not\r\npreserved their challenge to the denial of their special exceptions.  They\r\nacknowledge that the erroneous denial of a summary judgment motion “is\r\ngenerally not itself subject to review for reversible error.”  Accordingly, we\r\nconstrue their eighth issue as a contention that the repeated admission of\r\nevidence of bad acts caused cumulative harm.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Basham responds that evidence of other\r\nbad acts was relevant and admissible under Rule of Evidence 404(b) to show\r\nmalice and to show that Beaumont engaged in a pattern of discriminatory conduct\r\nin the workplace.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Appellants complain that the court\r\nabused its discretion by admitting the following evidence:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>(1)<span>              \r\n</span></span><span>that company policy strictly\r\nprohibits the consumption or use of alcoholic beverages or illegal substances\r\nwhile on company property, that an employee of the Ranch was not disciplined\r\nfor smoking marihuana on the premises, and that Beaumont instructed the staff\r\n“not to bother” her with these allegations;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>(2)<span>              \r\n</span></span><span>that company policy\r\nprohibits sexual harassment, that several employees had reported being\r\nsubjected to some form of sexual harassment (which reports Beaumont largely\r\ndenied having been made), and that Beaumont had not taken disciplinary action\r\nin most cases;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>(3)<span>              \r\n</span></span><span>that Beaumont had instructed\r\nBasham and another employee to “sleep with the chef” so he would “keep his\r\nhands off the girls in the kitchen”;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>(4)<span>              \r\n</span></span><span>that Beaumont had instructed\r\nemployees to spread rumors about the local mayor because Bellhouse had been\r\ngiven a ticket for violating a municipal ordinance;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>(5)<span>              \r\n</span></span><span>that Beaumont had instructed\r\nWilliams to lie at a Texas Workforce Commission hearing on a sexual harassment\r\nclaim so the complainant would not prevail and that in Beaumont’s opinion the\r\ncomplainant “didn’t deserve a dime”;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>(6)<span>              \r\n</span></span><span>that “many” of an employee’s\r\npaychecks from the Ranch were returned due to insufficient funds;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>(7)<span>              \r\n</span></span><span>that Beaumont, in one\r\nemployee’s opinion, is “evil personified” and “one of the cruelest, most vile\r\npeople I’ve ever met”;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>(8)<span>              \r\n</span></span><span>that Beaumont would\r\nencourage employees to perjure themselves (as she did with Williams) to retaliate\r\nagainst other employees who registered complaints;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>(9)<span>              \r\n</span></span><span>that the Ranch had failed to\r\npay a contractor’s bill in full for some projects;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>(10)<span>          \r\n</span></span><span>that Beaumont had instructed\r\nthis same contractor to look in a terminated employee’s house on the Ranch\r\nproperty (and kick in a locked bedroom door) to find a notebook with\r\ninformation about a recent event at the Ranch;

difficulties at the Ranch, Linda Beaumont,\r\na co-owner of the Ranch, told Basham to give vendors false information about\r\nwhen they would be paid.  After several months in an unpleasant work\r\nenvironment, Basham gave two weeks’ notice.  About two weeks after Basham’s\r\ndeparture, her nephew (and employee of the Ranch) Bryan Williams broke into her\r\nhouse at Beaumont’s direction, looking for items belonging to the Ranch which Beaumont claimed Basham had stolen.  Williams apparently broke into Basham’s home on four\r\nseparate occasions, being accompanied on the last occasion by Roni Beaumont\r\nBellhouse, Beaumont’s daughter.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Beaumont filed a report with the\r\nSheriff’s Department alleging that Basham had stolen one million dollars from\r\nthe Ranch.  An investigation was conducted, but no charges were ever brought\r\nagainst Basham.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Several witnesses testified about\r\nvarious statements which were made around the community or to others by\r\ntelephone regarding alleged embezzlement by Basham and Basham’s alleged\r\ninvolvement in a sexual relationship with a minor.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          The court granted Appellants’ motion\r\nfor directed verdict as to Basham’s claims for wrongful termination, and\r\nintentional infliction of emotion distress.  The court also granted Basham’s\r\noral motion to dismiss her sexual harassment claim against the Ranch.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          The jury found that Beaumont had\r\nslandered Basham but failed to find that Bellhouse had.  The jury found that\r\nboth Beaumont and Bellhouse had committed theft and invasion of privacy and had\r\nacted with malice.  The jury awarded damages on the slander claim of $50,000\r\nfor loss of reputation, $100,000 for past mental anguish, and $25,000 for\r\nfuture mental anguish.  The jury awarded damages on the theft claim of $25,000\r\nagainst Beaumont and $10,000 against Bellhouse.  The jury awarded damages on\r\nthe invasion of privacy claim of $25,000 against Beaumont and $25,000 against\r\nBellhouse.  The jury awarded additional/exemplary damages against Beaumont of $10,000 for slander, $10,000 for theft, and $10,000 for invasion of privacy. \r\nThe jury failed to find that Bellhouse should pay additional/exemplary damages. \r\nThe jury awarded attorney’s fees of $40,000 on Basham’s theft claim.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b><span>Invasion of Privacy</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Appellants contend in their seventh\r\nissue that (1) there is no evidence that Beaumont committed an invasion of\r\nprivacy and (2) the court erroneously permitted a double recovery for theft and\r\ninvasion of privacy because Basham suffered the same injury from

against Bellhouse\r\non the theft claim.  Finally, the jury awarded $25,000 in mental anguish damages\r\nagainst Beaumont and $25,000 against Bellhouse on the invasion of privacy claim.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Appellants concede that Basham is\r\nentitled to at least “nominal damages” for the defamatory statements but argue\r\nthat there is no evidence or factually insufficient evidence “justifying more\r\nthan a nominal award.”  They also contend that the award lacks evidentiary\r\nsupport because Basham failed to differentiate in her testimony among the\r\nsymptoms of mental anguish caused by the defamation, those caused by the theft,\r\nand those caused by the invasion of privacy.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Basham testified that, after she was\r\nfired, she went to her son’s basketball game and sat by a friend, but her\r\nfriend “just got up and walked away.”  She noticed that “[e]verybody’s neck was\r\nbreaking to look at me.”  This caused her to feel “very humiliated and\r\nembarrassed.”    Because of this, she left the bleachers and waited in the car\r\nfor the game to be over.  She experienced similar situations at other\r\nbasketball games and at her son’s baseball games.  There was “a lot of\r\nwhispering.”  She was “totally devastated” when Williams told her that Beaumont had told him to spread the rumors about her in town.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Because of the embarrassment and\r\nhumiliation, Basham stopped going to town as much as possible.  She stopped\r\ngoing to her children’s school functions, and she shopped for groceries in\r\nanother town.  She started having anxiety attacks on those occasions when she\r\ndid go to town, experiencing shortness of breath and an accelerated heart\r\nrate.  She had “many” sleepless nights and continued to experience sleeping\r\nproblems up to the date of trial.  She thinks about it “[e]very minute of my\r\nlife.”  Basham testified that her “heart drops” whenever she hears a knock on\r\nher door because she is “thinking what else is Ms. Beaumont going to do to me.”</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Basham ultimately moved to another\r\ntown because she “couldn’t take living there anymore.”  This caused separation\r\nfrom her sons because they chose to stay with their father and remain in their\r\nhometown.  Her oldest son moved back in with her about three years later.  Her\r\nyoungest son moved back in for about six months but ultimately returned to his\r\nfather’s home.  She is still “struggling” with the consequences of her decision\r\nto move.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Basham is no longer able to trust\r\npeople.  She feels “very uncomfortable” in social settings.  She has “basically\r\nbecome isolated” and does not participate in social events held at her new\r\nemployer’s location.  Her dating life has been significantly affected.  She is\r\nafraid to get close to people because she is afraid they will hurt her.<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[1]</span></span></span>\r\n She sought counseling for a period of time but could not afford to continue\r\nit.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          The context of Basham’s testimony that\r\nher “heart drops” whenever she hears a knock on the door indicates that Basham\r\nwas referring here to the occasion when sheriff’s deputies came to search her\r\nhome in response to Beaumont’s false report of embezzlement.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          With regard to the break-ins, Basham\r\ntestified that her dating life had been adversely affected because it is\r\ndifficult to start a new relationship “with as much emotions as I’m having to\r\ndeal with.”  Basham testified, “This experience just consumes me.  It’s like\r\nthis is just all that is on my mind all the time.”</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Basham testified that her feeling

<i>accord Smith</i>, 96 S.W.3d at 233-34.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Here, the defamation question\r\nessentially identifies three different defamatory statements which Basham\r\nalleges to have been made.  Appellants do not identify any of these statements\r\nas being an invalid basis for recovery either because it is not defamatory as a\r\nmatter of law or because there is no evidence in the record to show that they\r\nmade the statement.  Rather, Appellants argue that the combination of these statements\r\nin a single question presents an issue of “potential error.”  However, the\r\nSupreme Court clearly stated in <i>Smith</i> that the harmless error rule\r\nannounced in <i>Crown Life Insurance</i> and <i>Smith</i> applies only to\r\n“actual errors” and not to “imagined or potential ones.”  <i>See</i> 96 S.W.3d at\r\n235.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Accordingly, we overrule Appellants’\r\nsecond issue.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b><span>Prejudgment Interest</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Appellants contend in their tenth\r\nissue that the court erred by the manner in which it calculated prejudgment\r\ninterest because, as argued in other issues, the amount of compensatory damages\r\nawarded is excessive.  However, we have overruled each of Appellants’ issues\r\nchallenging the amount of compensatory damages awarded.  Accordingly, we\r\noverrule Appellants’ tenth issue.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b><span>Cumulative Harm</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Appellants contend in their eighth\r\nissue that the court committed several errors which resulted in “cumulative\r\nharm” because the court allowed “the case to be tried generally on the issue of\r\nwhether or not Linda Beaumont was a bad person.”</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Appellants argue that the court erred\r\nby: (1) denying their special exceptions; (2) denying their summary judgment\r\nmotion(s); and (3) admitting irrelevant evidence of “bad acts supposedly\r\ncommitted by Beaumont.”  We have already determined that Appellants have not\r\npreserved their challenge to the denial of their special exceptions.  They\r\nacknowledge that the erroneous denial of a summary judgment motion “is\r\ngenerally not itself subject to review for reversible error.”  Accordingly, we\r\nconstrue their eighth issue as a contention that the repeated admission of\r\nevidence of bad acts caused cumulative harm.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Basham responds that evidence of other\r\nbad acts was relevant and admissible under Rule of Evidence 404(b) to show\r\nmalice and to show that Beaumont engaged in a pattern of discriminatory conduct\r\nin the workplace.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>          Appellants complain that the court\r\nabused its discretion by admitting the following evidence:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>(1)<span>              \r\n</span></span><span>that company policy strictly\r\nprohibits the consumption or use of alcoholic beverages or illegal substances\r\nwhile on company property, that an employee of the Ranch was not disciplined\r\nfor smoking marihuana on the premises, and that Beaumont instructed the staff\r\n“not to bother” her with these allegations;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>(2)<span>              \r\n</span></span><span>that company policy\r\nprohibits sexual harassment, that several employees had reported being\r\nsubjected to some form of sexual harassment (which reports Beaumont largely\r\ndenied having been made), and that Beaumont had not taken disciplinary action\r\nin most cases;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>(3)<span>              \r\n</span></span><span>that Beaumont had instructed\r\nBasham and another employee to “sleep with the chef” so he would “keep his\r\nhands off the girls in the kitchen”;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>(4)<span>              \r\n</span></span><span>that Beaumont had instructed\r\nemployees to spread rumors about the local mayor because Bellhouse had been\r\ngiven a ticket for violating a municipal ordinance;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>(5)<span>              \r\n</span></span><span>that Beaumont had instructed\r\nWilliams to lie at a Texas Workforce Commission hearing on a sexual harassment\r\nclaim so the complainant would not prevail and that in Beaumont’s opinion the\r\ncomplainant “didn’t deserve a dime”;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>(6)<span>              \r\n</span></span><span>that “many” of an employee’s\r\npaychecks from the Ranch were returned due to insufficient funds;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>(7)<span>              \r\n</span></span><span>that Beaumont, in one\r\nemployee’s opinion, is “evil personified” and “one of the cruelest, most vile\r\npeople I’ve ever met”;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>(8)<span>              \r\n</span></span><span>that Beaumont would\r\nencourage employees to perjure themselves (as she did with Williams) to retaliate\r\nagainst other employees who registered complaints;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>(9)<span>              \r\n</span></span><span>that the Ranch had failed to\r\npay a contractor’s bill in full for some projects;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>(10)<span>          \r\n</span></span><span>that Beaumont had instructed\r\nthis same contractor to look in a terminated employee’s house on the Ranch\r\nproperty (and kick in a locked bedroom door) to find a notebook with\r\ninformation about a recent event at the Ranch;
