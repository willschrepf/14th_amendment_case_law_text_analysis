Civil Action No. 17-1597 (CKK)\n DONALD J. TRUMP, et al.,\n     Defendants\n\n\n                                 MEMORANDUM OPINION\n                                    (October 30, 2017)\n\n       On July 26, 2017, President Donald J. Trump issued a statement via Twitter announcing\n\nthat “the United States Government will not accept or allow transgender individuals to serve in\n\nany capacity in the U.S. Military.” A formal Presidential Memorandum followed on August 25,\n\n2017. Before the Presidential Memorandum, the Department of Defense had announced that\n\nopenly transgender individuals would be allowed to enlist in the military, effective January 1,\n\n2018, and had prohibited the discharge of service members based solely on their gender\n\nidentities. The Presidential Memorandum reversed these policies. First, the Memorandum\n\nindefinitely extends a prohibition against transgender individuals entering the military, a process\n\nformally referred to as “accession” (the “Accession Directive”). Second, the Memorandum\n\nrequires the military to authorize, by no later than March 23, 2018, the discharge of transgender\n\nservice members (the “Retention Directive”).\n\n       The Department of Defense is required to submit a plan implementing the directives of\n\nthe Presidential Memorandum by February 21, 2018. On September 14, 2017, Secretary of\n\nDefense James Mattis promulgated Interim Guidance establishing Department of Defense policy\n\ntoward transgender service members until the directives of the Presidential Memorandum take\n\neffect. Pursuant to the Presidential Memorandum and the Interim Guidance, the protections\n\nafforded to transgender service members against discharge lapse early next year.\n                                                 1\n\f       Plaintiffs are current and aspiring service members who are transgender. Many have\n\nyears of experience in the military. Some have decades. They have been deployed on active\n\nduty in Iraq and Afghanistan. They have and continue to serve with distinction. All fear that the\n\ndirectives of the Presidential Memorandum will have devastating impacts on their careers and\n\ntheir families. They have moved the Court to enjoin the directives of the Presidential\n\nMemorandum, believing that these directives violate the fundamental guarantees of due process\n\nafforded by the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Defendants have moved to\n\ndismiss this case, principally on the basis that the Court lacks jurisdiction. Although highly\n\ntechnical, these jurisdictional arguments reduce to a few simple points: the Presidential\n\nMemorandum has not effected a definitive change in military policy; rather, that policy is still\n\nsubject to review; until that review is complete, transgender service members are protected; and\n\nany prospective injuries are too speculative to require judicial intervention.\n\n       These arguments, while perhaps compelling in the abstract, wither away under scrutiny.\n\nThe Memorandum unequivocally directs the military to prohibit indefinitely the accession of\n\ntransgender individuals and to authorize their discharge. This decision has already been made.\n\nThese directives must be executed by a date certain, and there is no reason to believe that they\n\nwill not be executed. Plaintiffs have established that they will be injured by these directives, due\n\nboth to the inherent inequality they impose, and the risk of discharge and denial of accession that\n\nthey engender. Further delay would only serve to harm the Plaintiffs. Given these\n\ncircumstances, the Court is in a positon to preliminarily adjudicate the propriety of these\n\ndirectives, and it does so here.\n\n       The Court holds that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their Fifth Amendment claim. As\n\na form of government action that classifies people based on their gender identity, and disfavors a\n\n\n\n                                                  2\n\fclass of historically persecuted and politically powerless individuals, the President’s directives\n\nare subject to a fairly searching form of scrutiny. Plaintiffs claim that the President’s directives\n\ncannot survive such scrutiny because they are not genuinely based on legitimate concerns\n\nregarding military effectiveness or budget constraints, but are instead driven by a desire to\n\nexpress disapproval of transgender people generally. The Court finds that a number of factors—\n\nincluding the sheer breadth of the exclusion ordered by the directives, the unusual circumstances\n\nsurrounding the President’s announcement of them, the fact that the reasons given for them do\n\nnot appear to be supported by any facts, and the recent rejection of those reasons by the military\n\nitself—strongly suggest that Plaintiffs’ Fifth Amendment claim is meritorious.\n\n       Accordingly, following an exhaustive review of the record, the pleadings, 1 and the\n\nrelevant authorities, the Court GRANTS-IN-PART and DENIES-IN-PART Plaintiffs’ Motion\n\n\n\n       1\n          The Court’s consideration has focused on the following documents: Pls.’ App. for\nPreliminary Injunction, ECF No. 13 (“Pls.’ Mem.”); Defs.’ Mot. to Dismiss and Opp’n to Pls.’\nApp. for Preliminary Injunction, ECF No. 45 (“Defs.’ Mem.”); Pls.’ Opp’n to Defs.’ Mot. to\nDismiss and Reply in Support of App. for Preliminary Injunction, ECF No. 55 (“Pls.’ Reply”);\nand Defs.’ Reply in Support of Mot. to Dismiss, ECF No. 57 (“Defs.’ Reply”). The Court has\nalso considered the declarations attached to these pleadings, including: Decl. of Kevin M. Lamb,\nECF No. 13-1 (“Lamb Decl.”); Decl. of Brad R. Carson, ECF No. 13-3 (“Carson Decl.”); Decl.\nof Deborah L. James, ECF No. 13-5 (“James Decl.”); Decl. of Eric K. Fanning, ECF No. 13-7\n(“Fanning Decl.”); Decl. of Raymond E.

Defendants shall be preliminarily enjoined from enforcing the\n\nAccession and Retention Directives, corresponding with sections 1(b) and 2(a) of the\n\nPresidential Memorandum, until further order of the Court or until this case is resolved. The\n\neffect of the Court’s Order is to revert to the status quo with regard to accession and retention\n\nthat existed before the issuance of the Presidential Memorandum—that is, the retention and\n\naccession policies established in a June 30, 2016 Directive-type Memorandum and later modified\n\nby Secretary of Defense James Mattis on June 30, 2017.\n\n       The Court also GRANTS-IN-PART and DENIES-IN-PART Defendants’ Motion to\n\nDismiss. The Court has jurisdiction over and reaches the merits of Plaintiffs’ Fifth Amendment\n\nclaim as it pertains to the Accession and Retention Directives. Plaintiffs have also challenged\n\nthe Presidential Memorandum’s prohibition against the expenditure of military resources on sex\n\nreassignment surgeries. Because no Plaintiff has established a likelihood of being impacted by\n\nthat prohibition, the Court lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate the propriety of this directive. Finally,\n\nPlaintiffs have also claimed relief under a theory of estoppel. At this time, that claim will be\n\ndismissed without prejudice because the Amended Complaint lacks allegations of the sort of\n\nparticularized representations, reliance, or government misconduct that could justify estoppel\n\nagainst the government. Plaintiffs may file a further amended complaint with respect to\n\nestoppel.\n\n\n\n\n       In an exercise of its discretion, the Court finds that holding oral argument in this action\nwould not be of assistance in rendering a decision. See LCvR 7(f).\n\n\n                                                  4\n\f                                        I. BACKGROUND\n\n A. The Military’s Policy Toward Transgender Service\n\n        1. Military Policy Prior to 2014\n\n       Accession\n\n       Prior to 2014, Department of Defense Instruction (“DODI”) 6130.03 “contain[ed] a list of\n\ndisqualifying physical and mental conditions that preclude[d] applicants from joining the\n\nmilitary . . . .” Lamb Decl., Ex. B (Palm Center Report of the Transgender Service\n\nCommission), at 7. Disqualifying conditions included “defects of the genitalia including but not\n\nlimited to change of sex,” and “[c]urrent or history of psychosexual conditions, including but not\n\nlimited to transsexualism, . . . transvestism, . . . and other paraphilias.” Id.; see also Defs.’ Mem.\n\nat 4 (“For decades, [disqualifying] conditions [under DODI 6130.03] have included\n\n‘transsexualism.’”).\n\n       DODI 6130.03 also requires that the “Secretaries of the Military Departments and\n\nCommandant of the Coast Guard shall . . . [a]uthorize the waiver of the standards in individual\n\ncases for applicable reasons and ensure uniform waiver determinations.” Lamb Decl., Ex. B, at\n\n7. Service-specific implementing rules set forth the waiver process for each branch of the\n\nmilitary. For example, under the applicable Army regulations, “[e]xaminees initially reported as\n\nmedically unacceptable by reason of medical unfitness . . . may request a waiver of the medical\n\nfitness standards in accordance with the basic administrative directive governing the personnel\n\naction.” Army Reg. 40-501 (Standards of Medical Fitness), ¶ 1-6(b); see also Lamb Decl., Ex.\n\nB, at 7. Although Defendants contend that transgender-related conditions were and remain\n\nsubject to waiver, see Defs.’ Mem. at 4, evidence in the record suggests otherwise. At least\n\nunder the pertinent regulations as they existed prior to 2014, “because some conditions related to\n\n\n\n                                                  5\n\ftransgender identity [were] grounds for discharge, and because recruiters [could not] waive a\n\ncondition upon enlistment that would be disqualifying for retention, transgender individuals\n\n[could not] obtain medical waivers for entrance into the military.” Lamb Decl., Ex. B, at 8. A\n\nMarch 2014 report was unable to find “any instances in which transgender-related conditions\n\nhave been waived for accession[,]” id., and Defendants have adduced no evidence of waivers\n\never being granted for this purpose.\n\n       Retention\n\n       Pertinent regulations prior to 2014 also appear to have provided military commanders\n\nwith discretion to separate enlisted personnel for transgender-related conditions. In particular,\n\nDODI 1332.14, which “controls administrative separations for enlisted persons,” provided that a\n\n“service member may be separated for the convenience of the government and at the discretion\n\nof a commander for ‘other designated physical or mental conditions,’ a category defined to\n\ninclude ‘sexual gender and identity disorders.’” Lamb Decl., Ex. B, at 8. Furthermore, DODI\n\n1332.38, “which contains rules for retiring or separating service members because of physical\n\ndisability” provided that “service members with conditions ‘not constituting a physical\n\ndisability’ . . . can be separated administratively from military service at a commander’s\n\ndiscretion, without the opportunity to demonstrate medical fitness for duty or eligibility for\n\ndisability compensation.” Id. This category of conditions, under prior iterations of the\n\ninstruction, included “Sexual Gender and Identity Disorders, including Sexual Dysfunctions and\n\nParaphilias.” Id.\n\n        2. August 2014 Regulation and July 28, 2015 Memorandum\n\n       At least with respect to retention, changes to this regulatory scheme were first enacted in\n\nAugust 2014, when “the Department of Defense issued a new regulation, DODI 1332.18,\n\n\n\n                                                 6\n\fDisability Evaluation System (DES).” Fanning Decl. ¶ 12. According to Former Secretary of the\n\nArmy Eric K. Fanning and Former Secretary of the Air Force Deborah Lee James, the new\n\nregulation\n\n               eliminated a DoD-wide list of conditions that would disqualify\n               persons from retention in military service, including the categorical\n               ban on open service by transgender persons. This new regulation\n               instructed each branch of the Armed Forces to reassess whether\n               disqualification based on these conditions, including the ban on\n               service by transgender persons, was justified. As of August 2014,\n               there was no longer a DoD-wide position on whether transgender\n               persons should be disqualified for retention.\n\nId. (emphasis added); James Decl. ¶ 8.\n\n       Subsequently, on July 28, 2015, then-Secretary of Defense Ash Carter issued a\n\nmemorandum to the secretaries of the military departments directing that “[e]ffective as of July\n\n13, 2015, no Service member shall be involuntarily separated or denied reenlistment or\n\ncontinuation of active or reserve service on the basis of their gender identity, without the\n\npersonal approval of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness.” Carson\n\nDecl., Ex. A. The memorandum further ordered the Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel\n\nand Readiness to “chair a working group composed of senior representatives from each of the\n\nMilitary Departments, Joint Staff, and relevant components from the Office of the Secretary of\n\nDefense to formulate policy options for the DoD regarding the military service of transgender\n\nService members.” Id.\n\n        3. The Working Group and the RAND Report\n\n       The working group convened by the Undersecretary (“the Working Group”) consisted of\n\nsenior uniformed officers and senior civilian officers from each department of the military.\n\nCarson Decl. ¶ 9. The Working Group sought to identify any possible issues related to open\n\nmilitary service of transgender individuals. Id. ¶ 22. It considered a broad range of information\n\n                                                 7\n\fprovided by senior military personnel, various types of experts, health insurance companies,\n\ncivilian employers, transgender service members themselves, and representatives from the\n\nmilitaries of other nations who allow open service by transgender people. Id. ¶ 10. Finally, the\n\nWorking Group commissioned the RAND Corporation’s National Defense Research Institute to\n\nconduct a study on the impact of permitting transgender service members to serve openly. Id. ¶\n\n11. RAND is a nonprofit research institution that provides research and analysis to the Armed\n\nServices. Id.\n\n       The RAND Corporation subsequently issued a 91-page report entitled “Assessing the\n\nImplications of Allowing Transgender Personnel to Serve Openly.” Carson Decl., Ex. B\n\n(“RAND Report”). The RAND Report found no evidence that allowing transgender individuals\n\nto serve would have any effect on “unit cohesion,” and concluded that any related costs or\n\nimpacts on readiness would be “exceedingly small,” “marginal” or “negligible.” Id. at xi–xii,\n\n39–47, 69–70. The RAND Report also found that “[i]n no case” where foreign militaries have\n\nallowed transgender individuals to serve “was there any evidence of an effect on the operational\n\neffectiveness, operational readiness, or cohesion of the force.” Id. at xiii.\n\n       Based on all of the information it collected, the Working Group unanimously concluded\n\nthat transgender people should be allowed to serve openly in the military. Not only did the group\n\nconclude that allowing transgender people to serve would not significantly affect military\n\nreadiness or costs, it found that prohibiting transgender people from serving undermines military\n\neffectiveness and readiness because it excludes qualified individuals on a basis that has no\n\n\n\n\n                                                  8\n\frelevance to one’s fitness to serve, and creates unexpected vacancies requiring expensive and\n\ntime-consuming recruitment and training of replacements. 2\n\n       The Working Group communicated its conclusion to the Secretary of Defense, along with\n\ndetailed recommendations for policies and procedures for open transgender service.\n\n           4. June 30, 2016 Directive-Type Memorandum 16-005\n\n       On June 30, 2016, the Secretary of Defense Ash Carter issued a Directive-type\n\nMemorandum (“DTM”) establishing a policy, assigning responsibilities, and prescribing\n\nprocedures for “the retention, accession, separation, in-service transition and medical coverage\n\nfor transgender personnel serving in the Military Services.” James Decl., Ex. B, at 1. The DTM\n\ntook effect immediately. Id. In the DTM, the Secretary of Defense stated his conclusion that\n\nopen service by transgender Americans was “consistent with military readiness and with strength\n\n\n\n\n       2\n          See generally Carson Decl. ¶¶ 26–27 (“The Working Group . . . concluded that banning\nservice by openly transgender persons would harm the military” and “unanimously resolved that\ntransgender personnel should be permitted to serve openly in the military.”); James Decl. ¶ 22\n(“The Working Group did not find that permitting transgender soldiers to serve would impose\nany significant costs or have a negative impact on military effectiveness or readiness,” but did\nfind “that barring transgender people from military service causes significant harms to the\nmilitary, including arbitrarily excluding potential qualified recruits based on a characteristic with\nno relevance to their ability to serve.”); Fanning Decl. ¶¶ 25–26 (“At the conclusion of its\ndiscussion and analysis, the members of the Working Group did not identify any basis for a\nblanket prohibition on open military service of transgender people. Likewise, no one suggested\nto me that a bar on military service by transgender persons was necessary for any reason,\nincluding readiness or unit cohesion. The Working Group communicated its conclusions to the\nSecretary of Defense, including that permitting transgender people to serve openly in the United\nStates military would not pose any significant costs or risks to readiness, unit cohesion, morale,\nor good order and discipline.”); Mabus Decl. ¶ 21 (stating that “all members of the Working\nGroup . . . expressed their agreement that transgender people should be permitted to serve openly\nin the United States Armed Forces” and that “President Trump’s stated rationales for reversing\nthe policy and banning military service by transgender people make no sense,” “have no basis in\nfact and are refuted by the comprehensive analysis of relevant data and information that was\ncarefully, thoroughly, and deliberately conducted by the Working Group”); Wilmoth Decl. ¶ 23\n(“The Working Group concluded that there were no barriers that should prevent transgender\nservice members from serving openly in the military.”).\n                                                 9\n\fthrough diversity.” Id. at 2. Accordingly, the DTM stated that it was the policy of the\n\nDepartment of Defense that “service in the United States military should be open to all who can\n\nmeet the rigorous standards for military service and readiness” and that, “consistent with the\n\npolicies and procedures set forth in [the DTM], transgender individuals shall be allowed to serve\n\nin the military.” Id.\n\n       Retention\n\n       The DTM set forth procedures for the retention and accession of transgender military\n\nservice members. It stated that “[e]ffective immediately, no otherwise qualified Service member\n\nmay be involuntarily separated, discharged or denied reenlistment or continuation of service,\n\nsolely on the basis of their gender identity,” or on their “expressed intent to transition genders.”\n\nJames Decl., Ex. B, Attach. (Procedures), at 1. The DTM stated that “Transgender Service\n\nmembers will be subject to the same standards as any other Service member of the same gender;\n\nthey may be separated, discharged, or denied reenlistment or continuation of service under\n\nexisting processes and basis, but not due solely to their gender identity or an expressed intent to\n\ntransition genders.” Id.\n\n       Accession\n\n       With respect to accession procedures, the DTM stated that by no later than July 1, 2017,\n\nDODI 6130.03 would be updated to allow for the accession of (i) individuals with gender\n\ndysphoria, (ii) individuals that have received medical treatment for gender transition, and (iii)\n\nindividuals that have undergone sex reassignment surgeries. Id. at 1–2. The policies and\n\nprocedures generally provided that these conditions would be disqualifying unless the acceding\n\nservice member was medically stable in their chosen gender for at least 18 months. Id. The\n\nDTM also provided that, effective October 1, 2016, the Department of Defense would\n\n\n\n                                                 10\n\f“implement a construct by which transgender Service members may transition gender while\n\nserving.” Id. at 2.\n\n       Equal Opportunity\n\n       Finally, the DTM stated that it is “the Department’s position, consistent with the U.S.\n\nAttorney General’s opinion, that discrimination based on gender identity is a form of sex\n\ndiscrimination.” Id. at 2.\n\n        5. June 30, 2016 Remarks by Secretary of Defense Ash Carter\n\n       On June 30, 2016, then-Secretary of Defense Ash Carter announced from the Pentagon\n\nbriefing room that “we are ending the ban on transgender Americans in the United States\n\nmilitary.” Lamb Decl., Ex. F. He stated that “[e]ffective immediately, transgender Americans\n\nmay serve openly, and they can no longer be discharged or otherwise separated from the military\n\njust for being transgender.” Id. Secretary Carter also announced that he had “directed that the\n\ngender identity of an otherwise qualified individual will not bar them from military service, or\n\nfrom any accession program.” Id. The Secretary stated that on June 30, 2017, after a year-long\n\nimplementation period, “the military services will begin acceding transgender individuals who\n\nmeet all standards—holding them to the same physical and mental fitness standards as everyone\n\nelse who wants to join the military.” Id.\n\n       Secretary Carter gave three reasons for the Department’s decision. First, he stated that\n\n“the Defense Department and the military need to avail ourselves of all talent possible in order to\n\nremain what we are now—the finest fighting force the world has ever known.” Id. He added\n\nthat “[w]e invest hundreds of thousands of dollars to train and develop each individual, and we\n\nwant to take the opportunity to retain people whose talent we’ve invested in and who have\n\nproven themselves.” Id. Second, he stated that “the reality is that we have transgender service\n\n\n\n                                                11\n\fmembers serving in uniform today,” and they and their commanders need “clearer and more\n\nconsistent guidance than is provided by current policies.” Id. And third, he stated that, as a\n\nmatter of principle, “Americans who want to serve and can meet our standards should be\n\nafforded the opportunity to come to do so.” Id.\n\n        6. September 30, 2016 Publication of “Transgender Service in the U.S. Military:\n           An Implementation Handbook” and Military Department Policies\n\n       Consistent with the directives of Secretary Carter in his July 2015 memorandum and June\n\n2016 memorandum and policy announcement, Acting Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel\n\nand Readiness Peter Levine published an “implementation handbook” entitled “Transgender\n\nService in the U.S. Military.” Mabus Decl., Ex. F; see also James Decl., Ex. D. The document\n\nwas “the product of broad collaboration among the Services” and was intended to serve as a\n\n“practical day-to-day guide” to assist Service members and commanders to understand and\n\nimplement the policy of open transgender military service. James Decl., ¶ 34. The handbook is\n\na lengthy, exhaustive document, providing an explanation of the basics of what it means to be\n\ntransgender and to undergo gender transition; guidance on how transgender service members can\n\nrequest an in-service transition and communicate with their leadership about their transition\n\nprocess; and guidance for commanders interacting with transgender service members. It also\n\nincludes extensive question-and-answer and hypothetical scenario sections, as well as a\n\n“roadmap” for gender transition for military personnel.\n\n       Individual implementing memoranda were subsequently issued by the branches of the\n\nArmed Forces. On November 4, 2016, the Secretary of the Navy issued SECNAV Instruction\n\n1000.11, the stated purpose of which was to “establish Department of Navy . . . policy for the\n\naccession and service of transgender Sailors and Marines, to include the process for transgender\n\nService Members to transition gender in-service.” Mabus Decl., Ex. D, at 1. The memorandum\n\n                                                  12\n\fstated that “transgender individual shall be allowed to serve openly in the [Department of the\n\nNavy].” Id. at 2.\n\n        The Air Force issued a Policy Memorandum on October 6, 2016, which stated that “[i]t is\n\nAir Force policy that service in the United States Air Force should be open to all who can meet\n\nthe rigorous standards for military service and readiness. Consistent with the policies set forth in\n\nthis memorandum, transgender individuals shall be allowed to serve in the Air Force.” James\n\nDecl., Ex. C.\n\n        The Army issued Directive 2016-30 (Army Policy on Military Service of Transgender\n\nSoldiers) on July 1, 2016. Fanning Decl., Ex. D. The Directive stated that\n\n                 it is Army policy to allow open service by transgender Soldiers. The\n                 Army is open to all who can meet the standards for military service\n                 and remains committed to treating all Soldiers with dignity and\n                 respect while ensuring good order and discipline. Transgender\n                 Soldiers will be subject to the same standards as any other Soldier\n                 of the same gender. An otherwise qualified Soldier shall not be\n                 involuntarily separated, discharged, or denied reenlistment or\n                 continuation of service solely on the basis of gender identity.\nId. at 1.\n\n        Army Directive 2016-35 was promulgated on October 7, 2016. Fanning Decl., Ex. E. It\n\nstated that “The Army allows transgender Soldiers to serve openly.” Id. at 1.\n\n            7. June 30, 2017 Press Release by Secretary James Mattis\n\n        On June 30, 2017, Secretary of Defense James Mattis deferred acceding transgender\n\napplicants into the military until January 1, 2018, stating that the “services will review their\n\naccession plans and provide input on the impact to the readiness and lethality of our forces.”\n\nLamb Decl., Ex.

August 25, 2017 Presidential Memorandum\n\n       On August 25, 2017, President Trump issued a memorandum entitled “Presidential\n\nMemorandum for the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security.” Lamb\n\nDecl., Ex. A (the “Presidential Memorandum”). The memorandum begins by stating that until\n\n“June 2016, the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)\n\n(collectively, the Departments) generally prohibited openly transgender individuals from\n\naccession into the United States military and authorized the discharge of such individuals.”\n\nPresidential Memorandum § 1(a). According to the memorandum, “[s]hortly before President\n\nObama left office, . . . his Administration dismantled the Departments’ established framework by\n\npermitting transgender individuals to serve openly in the military, authorizing the use of the\n\nDepartments’ resources to fund sex-reassignment surgical procedures, and permitting accession\n\nof such individuals after July 1, 2017.” Id. The President stated that “the previous\n\nAdministration failed to identify a sufficient basis to conclude that terminating the Departments’\n\nlongstanding policy and practice would not hinder military effectiveness and lethality, disrupt\n\nunit cohesion, or tax military resources, and there remain meaningful concerns that further study\n\nis needed to ensure that continued implementation of last year’s policy change would not have\n\nthose negative effects.” Id.\n\n       The memorandum has two operative sections, one general, and the other more specific.\n\nSection 1(b) directs “the Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of Homeland Security with\n\nrespect to the U.S. Coast Guard, to return to the longstanding policy and practice on military\n\nservice by transgender individuals that was in place prior to June 2016 until such time as a\n\nsufficient basis exists upon which to conclude that terminating that policy and practice would not\n\nhave the negative effects discussed above.” Id. § 1(b). As already stated, the memorandum\n\n                                                15\n\fdefines the pre-June 2016 policy as one under which the military “generally prohibited openly\n\ntransgender individuals from accession into the United States military and authorized the\n\ndischarge of such individuals.” Id. § 1(a). The directive set forth in section 1(b) takes effect on\n\nMarch 23, 2018. Id. § 3. The memorandum provides that the “Secretary of Defense, after\n\nconsulting with the Secretary of Homeland Security, may advise [the President] at any time, in\n\nwriting, that a change to this policy is warranted.” Id. § 1(b).\n\n       Section 2 contains two specific directives to the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of\n\nHomeland Security. First, section 2(a) directs the Secretaries to “maintain the currently effective\n\npolicy regarding accession of transgender individuals into military service beyond January 1,\n\n2018, until such time as the Secretary of Defense, after consulting with the Secretary of\n\nHomeland Security, provides a recommendation to the contrary that [the President finds]\n\nconvincing . . . .” Id. § 2(a). This section takes effect on January 1, 2018. Id.\n\n       Second, section 2(b) directs the Secretaries to “halt all use of DoD or DHS resources to\n\nfund sex reassignment surgical procedures for military personnel, except to the extent necessary\n\nto protect the health of an individual who has already begun a course of treatment to reassign his\n\nor her sex.” Id. § 2(b). This section, like section 1(b), takes effect on March 23, 2018. Id § 3.\n\n       By February 21, 2018, the Secretaries must submit a plan to the President “for\n\nimplementing both the general policy set forth in section 1(b) of this memorandum and the\n\nspecific directives set forth in section 2 of this memorandum.” Id. § 3. This implementation\n\nplan must “determine how to address transgender individuals currently serving in the United\n\nStates military.” Id. Until that determination is made—and it must be made as part of the\n\nimplementation plan, which must be submitted by February 21, 2018—“no action may be taken\n\nagainst such individuals under the policy set forth in section 1(b) of this memorandum.” Id.\n\n\n\n                                                 16\n\fThat is, only after February 21, 2018, may the Secretaries take actions toward reverting to the\n\npre-June 2016 policy, which by the terms of the memorandum is a policy under which the\n\nmilitary “generally prohibited openly transgender individuals from accession into the United\n\nStates military and authorized the discharge of such individuals.” Id. § 1(a).\n\n        Retention Directive\n\n        In sum, by March 23, 2018, the Secretaries are required by the plain text of the\n\nPresident’s directive to revert to a policy under which the military “authorized the discharge of\n\n[transgender] individuals.” Id. §§ 1(a), 1(b), 3. The protections of the memorandum with\n\nrespect to discharge and other adverse action expire on February 21, 2018. Id. § 3.\n\n        Accession Directive\n\n        With respect to accession, the memorandum indefinitely delays the implementation of the\n\naccession policy of the June 2016 DTM, which was previously set for implementation on\n\nJanuary 1, 2018, and by March 23, 2018, requires the Secretaries to revert to a policy by which\n\nthe military “generally prohibit[s] openly transgender individuals from accession . . . .” Id. §§\n\n1(a), 1(b), 2(a), 3.\n\n         10. August 29, 2017 Statement by Secretary Mattis\n\n        On August 29, 2017, Secretary Mattis issued a statement concerning the Presidential\n\nMemorandum. Lamb Decl., Ex. D. He wrote that “[t]he [Department of Defense] will carry out\n\nthe president’s policy direction, in consultation with the Department of Homeland Security,” and\n\nthat “[a]s directed,” the Department of Defense will “develop a study and implementation plan,\n\nwhich will contain the steps that will promote military readiness, lethality, and unit cohesion,\n\nwith due regard to budgetary constraints and consistent with applicable law.” Id. The plan,\n\nSecretary Mattis wrote, “will address accessions of transgender individuals and transgender\n\n\n\n                                                17\n\findividuals currently serving in the United States military.” Id. Secretary Mattis stated that he\n\nwould “establish a panel of experts serving within the Departments of Defense and Homeland\n\nSecurity to provide advice and recommendations on the implementation of the president’s\n\ndirection.” Id. After the “panel reports its recommendations and following . . . consultation with\n\nthe secretary of Homeland Security,” Secretary Mattis “will provide [his] advice to the president\n\nconcerning implementation of his policy direction.” Id. In the interim, “current policy with\n\nrespect to currently serving members will remain in place.” Id.\n\n         11. September 14, 2017 Interim Guidance\n\n        On September 14, 2017, Secretary Mattis issued interim guidance that took “effect\n\nimmediately and will remain in effect until [he] promulgate[s] DoD’s final policy in this matter.”\n\nDefs.’ Mem., ECF No. 45, Ex. 1 (“Interim Guidance”). The Interim Guidance states that “[n]ot\n\nlater than February 21, 2018, [Secretary Mattis] will present the President with a plan to\n\nimplement the policy and directives in the Presidential Memorandum.” Id. at 1. The\n\n“implementation plan will establish the policy, standards and procedures for transgender\n\nindividuals serving in the military.” Id.\n\n        Accession\n\n        With respect to accession, the Interim Guidance provides that the procedures previously\n\nset forth in a 2010 policy instruction, “which generally prohibit the accession of transgender\n\nindividuals into the Military Services, remain in effect . . . .” Id. at 2.\n\n        Medical Care and Treatment\n\n        With respect to medical care and treatment, the Interim Guidance provides that “[s]ervice\n\nmembers who receive a gender dysphoria diagnosis from a military medical provider will be\n\nprovided treatment for the diagnosed medical condition,” but that “no new sex reassignment\n\n\n\n                                                   18\n\fsurgical procedures for military personnel will be permitted after March 22, 2018, except to the\n\nextent necessary to protect the health of an individual who has already begun a course of\n\ntreatment to reassign his or her sex.” Id.\n\n       Retention\n\n       With respect to the separation or retention of transgender service members, the Interim\n\nGuidance provides that “[a]n otherwise qualified transgender Service member whose term of\n\nservice expires while this Interim Guidance remains in effect, may, at the Service member’s\n\nrequest, be re-enlisted in service under existing procedures.” Id. (emphasis in original).\n\n       Finally, the Interim Guidance states that “[a]s directed by the [Presidential]\n\nMemorandum, no action may be taken to involuntarily separate or discharge an otherwise\n\nqualified Service member solely on the basis of a gender dysphoria diagnosis or transgender\n\nstatus.” Id.\n\n B. The Plaintiffs\n\n       1. Jane Doe 1\n\n       Plaintiff Jane Doe 1 has served in the Coast Guard since 2003. Looney Decl., Ex. A\n\n(“Redacted Jane Doe 1 Decl.”), ¶ 1. Jane Doe 1 is transgender. The Coast Guard has made a\n\nsubstantial investment in educating and training Jane Doe 1, and she has done her “best to be\n\nhardworking, faithful, and loyal to the Coast Guard.” Id. ¶ 11. She is married and is the primary\n\nwage earner for her family. She and her spouse receive health insurance coverage, called\n\nTRICARE, based on her enlisted status. Id. ¶ 12. When she came to the realization of her\n\ntransgender identity, Jane Doe 1, with her spouse’s support, sought professional help. Id. ¶ 14.\n\nShe paid for this help herself, fearing that she may be separated from the Coast Guard if she went\n\nthrough military health channels. Id. She was diagnosed with gender dysphoria and has\n\n\n\n                                                19\n\freceived medical treatment for this condition. Id. ¶ 15. However, because TRICARE does not\n\nprovide comprehensive gender transition healthcare, following the issuance of the June 2016\n\nDTM, she was required to obtain waivers from the Defense Health Agency to obtain treatment.\n\nBecause this process often led to delays, Jane Doe 1 has continued to pay for her care herself,\n\nincluding surgical care. Id. ¶ 21.\n\n       Following the President’s statement regarding transgender service members, issued via\n\nTwitter, Commandant of the Coast Guard Paul F. Zukunft stated, with respect to transgender\n\nservice members, that “[w]e have made an investment in you and you have made an investment\n\nin the Coast Guard and I will not break faith.” Id. ¶ 23.\n\n       According to Jane Doe 1, the Presidential Memorandum has disrupted her medical care,\n\nand has had “serious consequences for [her] financial future.” Id. ¶¶ 29–30. For one, separation\n\nfrom the Coast Guard would mean loss of substantial pension benefits, and health insurance for\n\nher and her family. Id. ¶¶ 30–31. Separation also means the loss of “a central part of [her]\n\nidentity.” Id. ¶ 36. In her own words: “As much as the Coast Guard has invested in me, I have\n\ninvested in the Coast Guard. I love serving, . . . I had expected to continue serving as a Coast\n\nGuard officer for many years.” Id.\n\n       2. Jane Doe 2\n\n       Jane Doe 2 joined the Army National Guard in 2003, when she was 17. Looney Decl.,\n\nEx. B (“Redacted Jane Doe 2 Decl.”), ¶ 3. She met her wife while serving, who soon became\n\npregnant. Jane Doe 2 then “made the decision to go on active duty with the U.S. Army so [she]\n\ncould obtain health care benefits to support [her] growing family.” Id. ¶ 5. She now has three\n\nchildren. Id. While on active duty, she served in South Korea and was deployed to Kandahar in\n\nAfghanistan. Id. ¶ 7.\n\n\n\n                                                20\n\f       During active duty, Jane Doe 2 came out to her wife as transgender. Id. ¶ 9. She felt\n\nmore connected to her wife and she stopped drinking. Id. After the Department of Defense\n\npromulgated new regulations in late 2015, she made a public post on Facebook stating that she\n\nwas transgender. Redacted Jane Doe 2 Decl. ¶ 10. Her company commander was very\n\nsupportive. Id. ¶ 11. She began to see an Army therapist, and following the June 2016 DTM,\n\nshe obtained a formal gender dysphoria diagnosis which permitted her to receive transition\n\ntreatment from military healthcare providers, and she began receiving hormone treatment. Id. ¶\n\n13.\n\n       Following the President’s statement and the Presidential Memorandum, Jane Doe 2\n\nbelieves that she has received an unfavorable work detail to keep her “separated from the rest of\n\n[her] unit because [she is] transgender and because of the President’s ban, as [she] never had any\n\nproblems with this kind of treatment in [her] old unit and [does] not know of any other reason\n\n[why] she would be treated this way.” Id. ¶ 15. She also fears the loss of retirement benefits,\n\nwhich accrue following 20 years of service, and access to “health care services for [her] family\n\non base.” Id. ¶ 16. She has already accrued 12 to 13 years of service toward these benefits. Id.\n\n¶¶ 16, 18. The directives of the Presidential Memorandum have “left [her] feeling excluded, and\n\nit hurts [her] that people like [her] are being singled out and told that [they] aren’t good enough\n\nto serve our country based on a characteristic that has no relevance at all to our abilities or fitness\n\nto serve.” Id. ¶ 19.\n\n       Jane Doe 2 “loves this country and [has] served it faithfully and well.” Id. For her, to\n\n“be told that [she is] no longer worthy to serve is a terrible blow. It affects how [she sees\n\nherself] . . . .” Id. “All [she wants] is to be allowed to serve [her] country and to be evaluated\n\nbased on [her] job performance rather than on [her] status as a transgender person.” Id. ¶ 20.\n\n\n\n                                                  21\n\f        3. Jane Doe 3\n\n        Jane Doe 3 serves in the Army. After completing her basic training, she was deployed to\n\nAfghanistan for six months. Looney Decl., Ex. C (“Redacted Jane Doe 3 Decl.”), ¶ 4. She is\n\ncurrently scheduled to deploy again to Iraq, where she will be going as a team leader, with\n\nsoldiers reporting to her. Id. ¶ 6.\n\n        Jane Doe 3 has received a gender dysphoria diagnosis from an Army therapist. Id. ¶ 7.\n\nAlthough she has developed a transition plan in coordination with medical professionals, she has\n\nnot begun any of the treatment steps, which include surgery. Id. ¶ 9.\n\n        Before the President’s statement regarding transgender individuals, Jane Doe 3 “had not\n\ncome out to anyone in [her] chain of command.” Id. ¶ 10. However, after the statement, she had\n\na conversation with her company commander, believing that she would receive support based on\n\nthe June 2016 DTM. Id. She told her company commander that she was worried that she would\n\nnot be deployed, and that she was committed to being deployed. Id.\n\n        The commander was not supportive—expressing shock and surprise—but she has\n\nreceived support from her squad leader, the platoon sergeant, and another friend in her unit. Id. ¶\n\n11. Since that conversation, she has continued to prepare for deployment, with the\n\nunderstanding that she will not be able to begin her treatment until she returns. Id. ¶ 12. In her\n\nwords, she “will not put [her] personal needs ahead of the needs of the mission and [her] fellow\n\nsoldiers.” Id.\n\n        Jane Doe 3 has “not told anyone else at [her] rank or below that [she] is transgender.” Id.\n\n¶ 15. As a result, she “was able to hear an unfiltered reaction to the President’s announcement\n\nright after he tweeted it.” Id. “Some made ugly remarks about transgender service members,\n\nwhile others remarked [that] people who kill transgender people should not be punished.” Id.\n\n\n\n                                                22\n\fAccording to Jane Doe 3, after “the tweets, people seemed emboldened to express hostility to\n\ntransgender people.” Id. ¶ 15.\n\n        4.   Jane Doe 4\n\n        Jane Doe 4 serves in the Army National Guard, but was previously on active duty with\n\nthe Army. After basic training, she served in South Korea, and subsequently served a tour in\n\nIraq after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Looney Decl., Ex. D (“Redacted Jane Doe 4 Decl.”), ¶¶ 5–6.\n\nAfter she returned from Iraq, Jane Doe 4 enlisted in the Army National Guard, and then joined\n\nthe Active Guard Reserve. Id. ¶ 7. In that capacity, she has been employed as a specialist by the\n\nDepartment of Defense. Id. ¶ 10.\n\n        Following the June 2016 DTM, Jane Doe 4 decided to come out as transgender to her\n\nchain of command. Id. ¶ 13. She first spoke to the senior non-commissioned officer of her unit,\n\nwho said she supported her decision “100%.” She then spoke with her commanding officer, a\n\nMajor, “who acknowledged that he was not very knowledgeable about the experiences of\n\ntransgender people, but told [her] that he and the rest of [her] unit would support and work with\n\n[her] through the process . . . .” Id. According to Jane Doe 4, the “change in policy allowing\n\ntransgender soldiers to serve openly . . . changed [her] life in the military.” Id. ¶ 14. Her “fellow\n\nsoldiers in [her] unit and [her] senior leaders . . . told [her] that they . . . noticed how much\n\nhappier [she was].” Id.\n\n        The President’s statement regarding transgender service members has been “devastating”\n\nto her, making her feel “ashamed” and “deeply saddened that he was ordering the Army, which\n\n[she] had been a part of for so long and which [she] loved so much, to stop treating [her] with\n\nrespect.” Id. ¶ 15. She “went to work each day wondering whether [she] would be discharged,\n\n\n\n\n                                                  23\n\fnot because of any problem with [her] job performance or [her] commitment to serve this\n\ncountry, but solely because of [her] gender identity.” Id.\n\n       Jane Doe 4 reenlisted effective August 24, 2017, and has extended her commitment to the\n\nArmy until February 2020. See Defs.’ Mem. at 11 (citing Sealed Decl. relating to Jane Doe 4,\n\nECF No. 56-4).\n\n        5. Jane Doe 5\n\n       “Jane Doe 5 has been an active duty member of the United States Air Force for nearly\n\ntwenty years, serving multiple tours of duty abroad, including two in Iraq.” Am. Compl., ECF\n\nNo. 9, ¶ 30. After June 2016, she notified her superiors that she is transgender. Id. ¶ 31. Her\n\n“livelihood depends on her military service[,]” and “[s]eparation from the military w[ould] have\n\ndevastating financial and emotional consequences for her.” Id. ¶ 32.\n\n       6. John Doe 1\n\n       John Doe 1 serves in the Army. His family has “a proud history of serving in the Armed\n\nForces.” Looney Decl., Ex. E (“Redacted John Doe 1 Decl.”), ¶ 3. His great grandfather served\n\nin Europe in World War II. Id. His father served in the Air Force and was awarded the Bronze\n\nStar for valor. His uncle was a United States Marine who was wounded and paralyzed by an\n\nimprovised explosive during Operation Desert Storm. His aunt served in the military as well.\n\nId. John Doe 1 has idolized military service since childhood. Id.\n\n       John Doe 1 entered college on a full academic scholarship. Id. ¶ 4. After graduating\n\nmagna cum laude, he entered the Army Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (“ROTC”) program\n\nwhile pursuing a master’s degree. Id. ¶ 5. His fellow cadets in the program knew that he was\n\ntransgender and were supportive, and his superiors were generally supportive as well. Id. ¶ 6.\n\nHe was ranked third in his ROTC class, and was allowed to wear a male dress uniform as part of\n\n\n\n                                                24\n\fhis duties for the ROTC Color Guard. Id. ¶ 6. While serving in the ROTC program, John Doe 1\n\nalso joined the National Guard. Id. ¶ 7. He met his future wife, with whom he has a two-year-\n\nold son. Id. ¶ 9. He graduated in the top 20% of his ROTC class. Id. ¶ 12.\n\n       Following the June 2016 DTM, John Doe 1 began training at the Basic Officer\n\nLeadership Course (“BOLC”), at which time he came out to his platoon instructors, who were\n\nvery supportive and treated him as male despite his official gender designation. Id. ¶¶ 14–15.\n\nAfter the BOLC, John Doe 1 was stationed as the executive officer for his unit, performing\n\nadministrative tasks on behalf of and reporting directly to his commanding officer.

After Secretary of Defense Carter announced that\n\ntransgender people could not be separated on the basis of their gender identity during his first\n\nyear at the Naval Academy, Kibby began to come out. Id. ¶¶ 13–14. Kibby’s Company Officer\n\nwas very accepting and supportive, and put Kibby in contact with the Brigade Medical Officer to\n\nbegin the process of preparing a medical treatment plan. Id. ¶¶ 16–19. The first step was to\n\nreceive an official diagnosis, which Kibby did. Id. ¶ 20.\n\n       Working with the Brigade Medical Officer, Kibby determined that in order to comply\n\nwith the 18 month stability requirement of the recently announced accession policy for\n\ntransgender service members, he would have to take a year off from the Naval Academy to\n\nensure that he had completed his transition plan prior to graduating and acceding. Id. ¶ 24. His\n\nCommandant and the Superintendent officially approved Kibby’s medical transition plan and his\n\n\n\n                                                26\n\frequest for a year-long medical leave of absence.

When the\n\nPresident declared on Twitter that transgender service members would no longer be allowed to\n\nserve in the military in any capacity, Dylan felt that the plan he had made for his life had been\n\n“thrown out the window.” Id. ¶¶ 12–13. He had come out as transgender in the ROTC in\n\nreliance on the military’s announcement that transgender people could serve openly. Id. ¶¶ 11,\n\n15.

Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction\n\n       When a motion to dismiss a complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) is\n\nfiled, a federal court is required to ensure that it has “the ‘statutory or constitutional power to\n\nadjudicate [the] case[.]’” Morrow v. United States, 723 F. Supp. 2d 71, 77 (D.D.C. 2010)\n\n(emphasis omitted) (quoting Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env’t, 523 U.S. 83, 89 (1998)).\n\n“Federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction” and can adjudicate only those cases or\n\ncontroversies entrusted to them by the Constitution or an Act of Congress. Kokkonen v.\n\nGuardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., 511 U.S. 375, 377 (1994). In determining whether there is\n\njurisdiction on a motion to dismiss, the Court may “consider the complaint supplemented by\n\nundisputed facts evidenced in the record, or the complaint supplemented by undisputed facts plus\n\nthe court’s resolution of disputed facts.” Coal. for Underground Expansion v. Mineta, 333 F.3d\n\n193, 198 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (citations omitted). “Although a court must accept as true all factual\n\nallegations contained in the complaint when reviewing a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule\n\n12(b)(1),” the factual allegations in the complaint “will bear closer scrutiny in resolving a\n\n12(b)(1) motion than in resolving a 12(b)(6) motion for failure to state a claim.” Wright v.\n\nForeign Serv. Grievance Bd., 503 F. Supp. 2d 163, 170 (D.D.C. 2007) (citations omitted).\n\n\n\n\n       4\n     Plaintiffs’ Motion for Leave to File Declarations Under Seal, ECF No. 51, is\nGRANTED for the reasons set forth in the Court’s prior Order regarding sealing.\n                                                  28\n\fB. Motion to Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim\n\n        Under Rule 12(b)(6), a party may move to dismiss a pleading on the grounds that it\n\n“fail[s] to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). “[A]\n\ncomplaint [does not] suffice if it tenders ‘naked assertion[s]’ devoid of ‘further factual\n\nenhancement.’” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly,\n\n550 U.S. 544, 557 (2007)). Rather, a complaint, or counterclaim, must contain sufficient factual\n\nallegations that, if accepted as true, “state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.”\n\nTwombly, 550 U.S. at 570. “A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual\n\ncontent that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the\n\nmisconduct alleged.” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678.\n\nC. Motion for Preliminary Injunction\n\n        Preliminary injunctive relief is “an extraordinary remedy that may only be awarded upon\n\na clear showing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief.” Sherley v. Sebelius, 644 F.3d 388,\n\n392 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (quoting Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008)).\n\nA plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction “must establish [1] that he is likely to succeed on the\n\nmerits, [2] that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, [3] that\n\nthe balance of equities tips in his favor, and [4] that an injunction is in the public interest.”\n\nAamer v. Obama, 742 F.3d 1023, 1038 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (quoting Sherley, 644 F.3d at 392\n\n(quoting Winter, 555 U.S. at 20) (alteration in original; quotation marks omitted)). When\n\nseeking such relief, “‘the movant has the burden to show that all four factors, taken together,\n\nweigh in favor of the injunction.’” Abdullah v. Obama, 753 F.3d 193, 197 (D.C. Cir. 2014)\n\n(quoting Davis v. Pension Benefit Guar. Corp., 571 F.3d 1288, 1292 (D.C. Cir. 2009)). “The\n\nfour factors have typically been evaluated on a ‘sliding scale.’” Davis, 571 F.3d at 1291 (citation\n\n\n\n                                                   29\n\fomitted). Under this sliding-scale framework, “[i]f the movant makes an unusually strong\n\nshowing on one of the factors, then it does not necessarily have to make as strong a showing on\n\nanother factor.” Id. at 1291–92. 5\n\n                                         III. DISCUSSION\n\n       The Court’s Opinion will be divided into three parts. The first part of the Opinion\n\nassesses the Court’s jurisdiction and addresses Defendants’ arguments that Plaintiffs lack\n\nstanding and that their claims are not ripe. The second part of the Opinion dismisses Plaintiffs’\n\nestoppel cause of action for failure to state a claim. Finally, in the third part of the Opinion, the\n\nCourt addresses Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction.\n\nA. Subject Matter Jurisdiction\n\n       Article III of the Constitution limits the jurisdiction of this Court to the adjudication of\n\n“Cases” and “Controversies.” U.S. Const., Art. III, § 2. “In an attempt to give meaning to\n\nArticle III’s case-or-controversy requirement, the courts have developed a series of principles\n\ntermed ‘justiciability doctrines,’ among which are standing [and] ripeness.” Nat’l Treasury\n\nEmps. Union v. United States, 101 F.3d 1423, 1427 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (citing Allen v. Wright, 468\n\nU.S. 737, 750 (1984)). Defendants challenge the Court’s jurisdiction on the basis of standing\n\nand ripeness.\n\n\n\n       5\n         The Court notes that it is not clear whether this circuit’s sliding-scale approach to\nassessing the four preliminary injunction factors survives the Supreme Court’s decision in\nWinter. See Save Jobs USA v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 105 F. Supp. 3d 108, 112 (D.D.C.\n2015). Several judges on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit\n(“D.C. Circuit”) have “read Winter at least to suggest if not to hold ‘that a likelihood of success\nis an independent, free-standing requirement for a preliminary injunction.’” Sherley, 644 F.3d at\n393 (quoting Davis, 571 F.3d at 1296 (concurring opinion)). However, the D.C. Circuit has yet\nto hold definitively that Winter has displaced the sliding-scale analysis. See id.; see also Save\nJobs USA, 105 F. Supp. 3d at 112. In any event, this Court need not resolve the viability of the\nsliding-scale approach today, as it finds that each of the preliminary injunctive factors favors\nawarding relief on the pending motion.\n                                                  30\n\f       Plaintiffs bear the burden of establishing jurisdiction, and each “element must be\n\nsupported in the same way as any other matter on which the plaintiff bears the burden of proof,\n\ni.e., with the manner and degree of evidence required at the successive stages of the litigation.”\n\nSusan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, 134 S. Ct. 2334, 2342 (2014) (“SBA List”) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted). On a motion for preliminary injunction, the plaintiff “must show a substantial\n\nlikelihood of standing[,]” while on a motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil\n\nProcedure 12(b)(1), the plaintiff must merely “state a plausible claim that they have suffered an\n\ninjury in fact fairly traceable to the actions of the defendant that is likely to be redressed by a\n\nfavorable decision on the merits.” Food & Water Watch, Inc. v. Vilsack, 808 F.3d 905, 913\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2015) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). Although Defendants have\n\npressed their jurisdictional arguments in a motion to dismiss, the Court also has an independent\n\nduty to assess its jurisdiction for purposes of Plaintiffs’ pending motion for preliminary\n\ninjunction. Consequently, the Court proceeds by applying the higher burden necessitated by a\n\nmotion for preliminary injunction.\n\n       For the reasons stated below, the Court concludes that it has jurisdiction to adjudicate the\n\npropriety of the directives of the Presidential Memorandum with respect to the accession and\n\nretention of transgender individuals for military service, which corresponds with sections 1(b)\n\nand 2(a) of the Presidential Memorandum (i.e., the Accession and Retention Directives). The\n\nCourt does not have jurisdiction over section 2(b), which prohibits the use of military resources\n\nto fund sex reassignment surgical procedures, because no Plaintiff has demonstrated that they are\n\nsubstantially likely to be impacted by this directive (the “Sex Reassignment Surgery Directive”).\n\n       1. Standing\n\n       Standing is an element of the Court’s subject-matter jurisdiction, and requires, in essence,\n\n\n\n                                                  31\n\fthat a plaintiff have “a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy . . . .” Warth v. Seldin,\n\n422 U.S. 490, 498 (1975). A plaintiff cannot be a mere bystander or interested third-party, or a\n\nself-appointed representative of the public interest; he or she must show that the defendant’s\n\nconduct has affected them in a “personal and individual way.” Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504\n\nU.S. 555, 561 (1992). “The law of Article III standing, which is built on separation-of-powers\n\nprinciples, serves to prevent the judicial process from being used to usurp the powers of the\n\npolitical branches.” SBA List, 134 S. Ct. at 2341–42 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nConsequently, the standing analysis is “especially rigorous when reaching the merits of the\n\ndispute would force [the court] to decide whether an action taken by one of the other two\n\nbranches of the Federal Government was unconstitutional.” Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, 568\n\nU.S. 398, 408 (2013).\n\n        The familiar requirements of Article III standing are:\n\n                (1) that the plaintiff have suffered an “injury in fact”—an invasion\n                of a judicially cognizable interest which is (a) concrete and\n                particularized and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or\n                hypothetical; (2) that there be a causal connection between the injury\n                and the conduct complained of—the injury must be fairly traceable\n                to the challenged action of the defendant, and not the result of the\n                independent action of some third party not before the court; and (3)\n                that it be likely, as opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will\n                be redressed by a favorable decision.\n\nBennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 167 (1997) (citing Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560–61); see also Spokeo,\n\nInc. v. Robins, 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1547 (2016).\n\n        The parties disagree only over the first element of standing: injury in fact. For the\n\nreasons stated below, Plaintiffs have carried their burden of demonstrating a substantial\n\nlikelihood of standing on the basis of at least two distinct injuries. First, Plaintiffs are subject to\n\na competitive barrier that violates equal protection. Second, they are subject to a substantial risk\n\n\n\n                                                   32\n\fof being denied accession, or being discharged from the military, due to their transgender status.\n\nFurthermore, Plaintiffs have demonstrated satisfactorily that both of these injuries are caused by\n\nthe directives of the Presidential Memorandum, and that they are redressable by this Court.\n\n              a. The Import of the Presidential Memorandum\n\n       Before turning to the legal basis of the two injuries that support Plaintiffs’ standing, the\n\nCourt first addresses the crux of Defendants’ arguments regarding standing, and indeed, this\n\nCourt’s subject-matter jurisdiction more generally.\n\n       According to Defendants, the Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction with respect to the\n\ndirectives of the Presidential Memorandum because Plaintiffs have merely “brought a\n\nconstitutional challenge to the President’s policy directive to conduct further study before the\n\nmilitary changes its longstanding policies regarding service by transgender individuals.” Defs.’\n\nMem. at 15. According to Defendants, Plaintiffs “challenge a notional policy regarding military\n\nservice by transgender individuals, but as they concede, that policy is currently being studied and\n\nhas not been implemented or applied to anyone, let alone Plaintiffs.” Defs.’ Reply at 1.\n\nDefendants also highlight the protections afforded by the Interim Guidance: “Secretary of\n\nDefense Mattis has put in place Interim Guidance that, by its terms, maintains the status quo for\n\nboth current service members and those who seek to accede into the military.” Id. In\n\nDefendants’ view, the Court is being asked “to prejudge the constitutionality of a future\n\nGovernment policy regarding military service by transgender individuals and issue the\n\nextraordinary relief of a worldwide preliminary injunction.” Defs.’ Mem. at 1. They further\n\ncontend that “it is unclear whether those currently serving members will be affected by the future\n\npolicy regarding service by transgender individuals once it is finalized and implemented.” Id. at\n\n2.\n\n\n\n                                                 33\n\f       According to Defendants, the President has only “directed the Secretary of Defense to\n\ndetermine how to address transgender individuals currently serving in the military and that no\n\naction be taken against such individuals until after a policy review is completed.” Id. at 1\n\n(emphasis in original). In their words: “Secretary Mattis’s Memorandum is unambiguous: The\n\nInterim Guidance is the operative policy and will remain so until he promulgates DoD’s final\n\npolicy regarding service by transgender individuals.” Defs.’ Reply at 3. “The Interim Guidance\n\nis equally clear: Transgender service members, including the service member Plaintiffs, continue\n\nto serve fully in the military.” Id. With respect to accession, Defendants contend that the\n\noperative policy is not a “ban” because transgender individuals are “subject to the normal waiver\n\nprocess.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). In sum, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs\n\ndisregard the actual policy regarding transgender service members, and instead rely “on a\n\nhypothetical future policy on transgender military service.” Id.\n\n       Ultimately, all of these contentions can be summarized into a few overarching points: the\n\nPresidential Memorandum merely commissioned an additional policy review; that review is\n\nunderway; nothing is set in stone, and what policy may come about is unknown; and regardless,\n\nPlaintiffs are protected by the Interim Guidance. And while accession by transgender individuals\n\nis not permitted, they may obtain waivers. In the Court’s view, the government’s jurisdictional\n\narguments are a red herring.\n\n       The President controls the United States military. The directives of the Presidential\n\nMemorandum, to the extent they are definitive, are the operative policy toward military service\n\nby transgender service members. The Court must and shall assume that the directives of the\n\nPresidential Memorandum will be faithfully executed. See Nat’l Mining Ass’n v. U.S. Army\n\nCorps of Engineers, 145 F.3d 1399, 1408 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (assessing “faithful” application of\n\n\n\n                                                34\n\fagency rule). Consequently, the Interim Guidance must be read as implementing the directives\n\nof the Presidential Memorandum, and any protections afforded by the Interim Guidance are\n\nnecessarily limited to the extent they conflict with the express directives of the memorandum.\n\nFinally, to the extent there is ambiguity about the meaning of the Presidential Memorandum, the\n\nbest guidance is the President’s own statements regarding his intentions with respect to service\n\nby transgender individuals. To recount: On July 26, 2017, the President issued a statement\n\nannouncing that the “United States government will not accept or allow transgender individuals\n\nto serve in any capacity in the U.S. military.” On August 25, 2017, the President issued the\n\nPresidential Memorandum. There, the President states that until “June 2016, the [military]\n\ngenerally prohibited openly transgender individuals from accession into the United States\n\nmilitary and authorized the discharge of such individuals.” Finding subsequent changes to that\n\npolicy unjustified, in section 1(b), the President directs the military “to return to the longstanding\n\npolicy and practice on military service by transgender individuals that was in place prior to June\n\n2016 . . . .” Accordingly, the military has been directed by section 1(b) to return to a policy\n\nunder which: (i) transgender individuals are generally prohibited from accession; and (ii) the\n\nmilitary is authorized to discharge individuals who are transgender.\n\n       This change in policy must occur by March 23, 2018, except that the prohibition on\n\naccession is extended indefinitely as of January 1, 2018. Likewise, as of March 23, 2018, the\n\nmilitary is expressly prohibited from funding sex reassignment surgeries, except as necessary to\n\nprotect the health of an already transitioning individual. The Memorandum provides that “[a]s\n\npart of the implementation plan, the Secretary of Defense . . . shall determine how to address\n\ntransgender individuals currently serving in the United States military.” “Until the Secretary has\n\nmade that determination, no action may be taken against such individuals under the policy set\n\n\n\n                                                 35\n\fforth in section 1(b)”—that is, the directive that requires a return to the policy under which\n\ntransgender individuals could not accede, and could be discharged. As these two clauses make\n\nclear, transgender individuals are immunized only until the Secretary of Defense makes the\n\n“determination”; the “determination” must be made “as part of the implementation plan”; and the\n\n“implementation plan” must be submitted to the President by February 21, 2018. This means\n\nthat the “determination” must be made by February 21, 2018, and because the protections\n\nafforded to transgender individuals last only until the “determination” is made, those protections\n\nnecessarily lapse by February 21, 2018, unless the “determination” is made earlier.\n\nConsequently, as of January 1, 2018, transgender individuals are prohibited from acceding to the\n\nmilitary “until such time [that the President receives] a recommendation to the contrary that [he]\n\nfind[s] convincing;” and as of March 23, 2018, the military must authorize the discharge of\n\ntransgender service members. The protections afforded to these individuals by the terms of the\n\nPresidential Memorandum lapse, at the latest, by February 21, 2018.\n\n       Nothing in the August 2017 Statement by Secretary Mattis, or the Interim Guidance, can\n\nor does alter these realities. The Statement provides that Secretary Mattis will establish a panel\n\nof experts “to provide advice and recommendations on the implementation of the president’s\n\ndirection.” After the “panel reports its recommendations and following . . . consultation with the\n\nsecretary of Homeland Security,” Secretary Mattis will “provide [his] advice to the president\n\nconcerning implementation of his policy direction.” Put differently, the military is studying how\n\nto implement the directives of the Presidential Memorandum. Such a policy review and\n\nimplementation plan are likely necessitated by the fact that—as borne out by the RAND Report\n\nand the declarations submitted by the Pseudonym Plaintiffs—transgender service members\n\noccupy a variety of crucial positions throughout the military, including active duty postings in\n\n\n\n                                                 36\n\fwar zones. Presumably, the removal and replacement of such individuals during a time of war\n\ncannot occur overnight. Accordingly, Defendants are correct that policy decisions are still being\n\nmade. But the decisions that must be made are how to best implement a policy under which\n\ntransgender accession is prohibited, and discharge of transgender service members is authorized.\n\nUnless the directives of the Presidential Memorandum are altered—and there is no evidence that\n\nthey will be—military policy toward transgender individuals must fit within these confines.\n\n       Similarly, the Interim Guidance provides that “[n]ot later than February 21, 2018,\n\n[Secretary Mattis] will present the President with a plan to implement the policy and directives in\n\nthe Presidential Memorandum[,]” and that the “implementation plan will establish the policy,\n\nstandards and procedures for transgender individuals serving in the military.” True, the exact\n\ndetails of the plan to carry out the directives are unknown. But what is known, and what is the\n\nbedrock of Plaintiffs’ constitutional challenge, is that the implementation plan must prohibit\n\ntransgender accession and authorize the discharge of transgender service members. Otherwise,\n\nthe plan would be out of compliance with the requirements of the Presidential Memorandum, and\n\nthe Court shall not presume the military to be unfaithful to the orders of the President.\n\nConsequently, while the Court cannot presently adjudicate the merits of the yet-undecided details\n\nof how the directives will be carried out, it can adjudicate the constitutionality of the directives\n\nthemselves, which are definite, and must be implemented by the military.\n\n       Finally, although Defendants make much of the protections afforded by the Interim\n\nGuidance to transgender individuals, that protection is necessarily qualified by the Presidential\n\nMemorandum. The Interim Guidance provides that: “As directed by the [Presidential]\n\nMemorandum, no action may be taken to involuntarily separate or discharge an otherwise\n\nqualified Service member solely on the basis of a gender dysphoria diagnosis or transgender\n\n\n\n                                                  37\n\fstatus.” (Emphasis added). The protections afforded by the Presidential Memorandum lapse by\n\nFebruary 21, 2018, and discharge must be authorized by March 23, 2018. The Interim Guidance\n\ncan do nothing to obviate these facts. Nor is standing vitiated by the mere possibility that the\n\nPresident may alter the directives of the Presidential Memorandum. See Appalachian Power Co.\n\nv. EPA, 208 F.3d 1015, 1022 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (“[A]ll laws are subject to change. Even that most\n\nenduring of documents, the Constitution of the United States, may be amended from time to\n\ntime. The fact that a law may be altered in the future has nothing to do with whether it is subject\n\nto judicial review at the moment.”). Nor is there evidence that such a change may occur, given\n\nthe President’s unequivocal pronouncement that “the United States government will not accept\n\nor allow transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. military.” Accordingly, for\n\npurposes of its standing analysis, the Court concludes that there is a substantial likelihood that\n\ntransgender individuals will be indefinitely prevented from acceding to the military as of January\n\n1, 2018, and that the military shall authorize the discharge of current service members who are\n\ntransgender as of March 23, 2018.\n\n              b. Equal Protection Injury\n\n                  i. Relevant Case Law\n\n       The primary injury alleged by Plaintiffs, and which forms the basis of the Court’s\n\ndecision on the merits, is that the directives of the Presidential Memorandum violate the\n\nguarantee of equal protection afforded by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. For\n\npurposes of the standing analysis, the Court assumes arguendo that these directives are, in fact,\n\nviolative of equal protection. Schnitzler v. United States, 761 F.3d 33, 40 (D.C. Cir. 2014)\n\n(“[T]he Supreme Court has made clear that when considering whether a plaintiff has Article III\n\n\n\n\n                                                 38\n\fstanding, a federal court must assume arguendo the merits of his or her legal claim.” (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted)).\n\n       The Supreme Court and this Circuit have made clear that the “injury in fact element of\n\nstanding in an equal protection case is the denial of equal treatment resulting from the imposition\n\nof the barrier.” Am. Freedom Law Ctr. v. Obama, 821 F.3d 44, 51 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (citing Ne.\n\nFlorida Chapter of Associated Gen. Contractors of Am. v. City of Jacksonville, Fla., 508 U.S.\n\n656, 666 (1993) (Thomas, J.)), cert. denied, 137 S. Ct. 1069 (2017). In City of Jacksonville, the\n\nSupreme Court assessed a city ordinance that “required that 10% of the amount spent on city\n\ncontracts be set aside each fiscal year for so-called ‘Minority Business Enterprises’ (MBE’s).”\n\n508 U.S. at 658. “Once projects were earmarked for MBE bidding by the city’s chief purchasing\n\nofficer, they were deemed reserved for minority business enterprises only.” Id. (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted). Plaintiff was an association of individuals and firms in the\n\nconstruction industry who did business in the city and most of whom did not qualify under the\n\nordinance. Id. at 659. The members of the association alleged that they “regularly bid on and\n\nperform[ed] construction work for the City of Jacksonville,” and that they “would have bid on\n\ndesignated set aside contracts but for the restrictions imposed by the ordinance.” Id. (internal\n\nquotations marks and alterations omitted). In assessing the members’ standing to challenge the\n\nordinance under these circumstances, the Court held that:\n\n               When the government erects a barrier that makes it more difficult\n               for members of one group to obtain a benefit than it is for members\n               of another group, a member of the former group seeking to challenge\n               the barrier need not allege that he would have obtained the benefit\n               but for the barrier in order to establish standing. The “injury in fact”\n               in an equal protection case of this variety is the denial of equal\n               treatment resulting from the imposition of the barrier, not the\n               ultimate inability to obtain the benefit. . . . And in the context of a\n               challenge to a set-aside program, the “injury in fact” is the inability\n               to compete on an equal footing in the bidding process, not the loss\n\n                                                 39\n\f               of a contract. . . . To establish standing, therefore, a party\n               challenging a set-aside program like Jacksonville’s need only\n               demonstrate that it is able and ready to bid on contracts and that a\n               discriminatory policy prevents it from doing so on an equal basis.\n\nId. at 666 (emphasis added) (citations omitted).\n\n       In Adarand, the Court assessed a requirement that federal agency contracts for general\n\ncontractors contain a clause providing for additional compensation if the general contractor hired\n\nsubcontractors “certified as small businesses controlled by socially and economically\n\ndisadvantaged individuals,” where socially and economically disadvantaged individuals were\n\ndeemed to include “Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native Americans, Asian Pacific\n\nAmericans, and other minorities . . . .” Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200, 205\n\n(1995) (internal quotation marks omitted). Plaintiff submitted a lower bid, but lost to a\n\ncompeting subcontractor that qualified the general contractor for additional compensation under\n\nthe clause. Id. In assessing Plaintiff’s standing for purposes of prospective injunctive relief—\n\nthat is, with respect to future injuries—the Court held that the “concrete and particularized”\n\nelement of injury in fact was readily satisfied by Plaintiff’s “claim that the Government’s use of\n\nsubcontractor compensation clauses denies it equal protection of the laws . . . .” Id. at 211. The\n\nCourt was less certain, however, “that the future use of subcontractor compensation clauses will\n\ncause [the plaintiff] ‘imminent’ injury[,]” and consequently required a “showing that sometime\n\nin the relatively near future [the plaintiff] will bid on another Government contract that offers\n\nfinancial incentives to a prime contractor for hiring disadvantaged subcontractors.” Id. The\n\nplaintiff made a sufficient showing by demonstrating that it was “very likely” to bid on an\n\naffected contract at least once per year, and that in so bidding, the plaintiff often competed\n\nagainst small disadvantaged businesses. Id. at 212.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   40\n\f       In Gratz, the plaintiffs, two students who were denied entrance to the University of\n\nMichigan, brought suit challenging the University’s consideration of race as part of its\n\nundergraduate admissions process as violative of equal protection. Gratz v. Bollinger, 539 U.S.\n\n244, 251 (2003) (Rehnquist, C.J.). The Court considered whether one of the plaintiffs had\n\nstanding to seek prospective injunctive relief given his statement that he would not apply for\n\nadmission as a transfer student until the race-based admissions policy was terminated. Id. at 261.\n\nRelying on City of Jacksonville, the Court found that the plaintiff had standing because “the\n\nUniversity had denied him the opportunity to compete for admission on an equal basis.” Id. at\n\n262. In particular, “[a]fter being denied admission, [the plaintiff] demonstrated that he was ‘able\n\nand ready’ to apply as a transfer student should the University cease to use race in undergraduate\n\nadmissions. He therefore [had] standing to seek prospective relief with respect to the\n\nUniversity’s continued use of race in undergraduate admissions.” Id.\n\n       More recently, in Parents Involved, the Supreme Court assessed the use by several school\n\ndistricts of “student assignment plans that rely upon race to determine which public schools\n\ncertain children may attend.” Parents Involved in Cmty. Sch. v. Seattle Sch. Dist. No. 1, 551 U.S.\n\n701, 709–10 (2007) (Roberts, C.J.). “In Seattle, this racial classification [was] used to allocate\n\nslots in oversubscribed high schools.” Id. at 710. Consequently, Seattle argued that the\n\nmembers of the plaintiff organization would “only be affected if their children seek to enroll in a\n\nSeattle public high school and choose an oversubscribed school that is integration positive[,]”\n\nwhich in Seattle’s view was “too speculative a harm to maintain standing.” Id. at 718. The\n\nCourt disagreed, finding that plaintiff had standing because its members had “children in the\n\ndistrict’s elementary, middle, and high schools[,]” and injunctive relief was sought on behalf of\n\nmembers whose children “may be denied admission to the high schools of their choice when\n\n\n\n                                                 41\n\fthey apply for those schools in the future . . . .” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). The\n\ninjury was not eliminated merely because it was “possible that children of group members will\n\nnot be denied admission to a school based on their race—because they choose an\n\nundersubscribed school or an oversubscribed school in which their race is an advantage . . . .”\n\nId.\n\n       This line of authority was summarized by the D.C. Circuit in Worth v. Jackson, 451 F.3d\n\n854 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (Tatel, J.). There, the plaintiff challenged written and unwritten\n\nemployment policies by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) that\n\nallegedly discriminated on the basis of gender and race, and claimed standing for purposes of\n\nprospective injunctive relief by alleging that he intended “to apply for new positions and\n\npromotions at HUD on a regular basis in the future,” and that HUD would “violate his equal\n\nprotection and civil rights” when he did so. Id. at 858 (internal quotation marks and alteration\n\nomitted). Reviewing City of Jacksonville and Adarand, the D.C. Circuit found no reason to\n\ndistinguish “between contractors and job applicants[,]” and held that the source of the challenged\n\npolicy—“whether a statute, a regulation, or agency guidelines”—did not control the standing\n\ninquiry. Id. at 859. Rather, according to the Circuit, “Adarand rests on the common-sense\n\nnotion that when a contractor depends for its livelihood on competing for government contracts,\n\nand when the government has committed itself to doling out those contracts on a race-conscious\n\nbasis, it stands to reason that the contractor will soon be competing on an uneven playing field.”\n\nId. at 859. “Under Adarand, then, the relevant consideration is whether the agency is sufficiently\n\ncommitted to a particular race-conscious policy that the plaintiff will likely face a career\n\nimpediment.” Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 42\n\f                   ii. Application to Plaintiffs\n\n        For purposes of the standing analysis, Plaintiffs fall into two groups: Named Plaintiffs—\n\nwho have yet to accede—and the Pseudonym Plaintiffs—who are currently in the military and\n\nfear that they will be discharged. These two groups challenge the two fundamental directives of\n\nthe Presidential Memorandum as unconstitutional: a reversion of accession and retention policy\n\nwith respect to transgender individuals (i.e., the Accession and Retention Directives). For the\n\nfollowing reasons, the Court concludes that: (i) the Accession and Retention Directives of the\n\nPresidential Memorandum impose a competitive barrier that the Named and Pseudonym\n\nPlaintiffs are substantially likely to encounter, and (ii) that this barrier constitutes an injury in\n\nfact sufficient to imbue the Named and Pseudonym Plaintiffs with standing to challenge the\n\npropriety of the Accession and Retention Directives of the Presidential Memorandum.\n\n        The Accession Directive\n\n        Plaintiff Kibby—one of the Named Plaintiffs—has demonstrated a substantial likelihood\n\nthat he is able and ready to accede to the military in the relatively near future, and consequently,\n\nthat he is in a position to challenge the Accession Directive to the extent it imposes a barrier on\n\nhim from acceding based on his transgender status.\n\n        Plaintiff Kibby was inducted into the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis,\n\nMaryland as a midshipman on July 1, 2017, and has completed his first two years of education,\n\nout of four. Kibby Decl. ¶ 1. “[A]ll midshipmen are members of the military, [but] are still\n\nconsidered part of an accessions program since [they] do not receive [their] commission until\n\ngraduation.” Id. ¶ 22. After graduation, Plaintiff Kibby hopes “to perform [his] service as a\n\nSurface Warfare Officer aboard a Navy ship.” Id. ¶ 9. Plaintiff Kibby informed his chain of\n\ncommand that he was transgender in early 2016. Id. ¶ 16. At the end of his last school year, in\n\n\n\n                                                   43\n\fMay 2017, the Commandant and Superintendent “officially approved [Plaintiff’s] medical\n\ntransition plan and the request for a year-long medical leave of absence.” Id. ¶ 26. The\n\ntransition plan was created in coordination with the Brigade Medical Officer and the\n\nTransgender Care Team at Portsmouth’s Naval Medical Center.” Id. ¶¶ 24–25. The medical\n\nyear of absence was taken to comply with the requirement under the June 2016 DTM that\n\nacceding transgender service members be fully transitioned to their chosen gender for at least 18\n\nmonths prior to accession. Id. ¶ 24. Defendants represent that “Plaintiff Kibby currently is on\n\nmedical leave and faces no impediment to returning to the Naval Academy when that leave ends\n\nin May 2018.” Defs.’ Mem. at 16. The Commandant of Midshipmen at the Naval Academy,\n\nRobert B. Chadwick, has represented that Plaintiff Kibby “was afforded much support from the\n\nBrigade Medical Unit, his chain of command, and [the Commandant’s] legal advisors in\n\ndeveloping his [transition] plan and submitting his request [for medical leave].” Chadwick Decl.\n\n¶ 4. According to the Commandant, the “purpose of the [medical] leave is to allow MIDN Kibby\n\nto undergo hormone treatment, and to [obtain] a period of gender stability of sufficient length\n\nunder current policy and guidance to ensure his eligibility to accept a commission in May 2020 if\n\nhe successfully completes the course of instruction upon return to [the Naval Academy].” Id. ¶\n\n10.\n\n       Upon his return, Plaintiff Kibby will be required to meet the male fitness requirements,\n\nwhich are more difficult than their female counterpart, as well as the Academy’s academic\n\nstandards. Id. ¶¶ 15-16. Plaintiff Kibby has represented that during the medical year of absence,\n\nhe is “completing a rigorous exercise and training regimen so that [he] will be able to meet the\n\nmale fitness standards upon [his] return[,]” and that he “can already meet the male standards for\n\npush-ups and sit-ups and will be working hard on [his] run time.” Kibby Decl. ¶ 28. Given his\n\n\n\n                                                44\n\fprior academic success at the Naval Academy, Kibby Decl. ¶ 39, the support afforded to his\n\ntransition plan by senior officials, and his representations regarding his fitness training, the Court\n\nfinds that Plaintiff Kibby has demonstrated a substantial likelihood that he will be able to meet\n\nthe graduation requirements of the Naval Academy. Following graduation, he will be in a\n\nposition to accede to the Navy or Marine Corps. Chadwick Decl. ¶ 16. Defendants have not\n\nargued or presented any evidence that Plaintiff Kibby will be unable to graduate from the Naval\n\nAcademy—an unsurprising position, given that dismissal stemming from the inability of\n\ntransgender individuals to accede would itself likely be an injury sufficient to confer standing to\n\nchallenge the constitutionality of the Presidential Memorandum.\n\n        Consequently, Plaintiff Kibby has demonstrated that he is “able and ready” to apply for\n\naccession. Using the words of Adarand, he is “very likely” to apply for accession in the\n\n“relatively near future.” Indeed, Plaintiff Kibby has demonstrated a greater likelihood of his\n\nbeing subject to the competitive barrier than many of the plaintiffs in the equal protection cases\n\ndiscussed above. In Parents Involved, the members of the plaintiff organization had standing\n\neven though it was possible that they would not even apply to an affected high school—and\n\nnothing was said of the possibility that the students could fail to graduate from elementary or\n\nmiddle school. In Gratz, the plaintiff merely stated an intention to apply as a transfer student—\n\nsurely it was possible that academic failures at his current institution, or other hardships, would\n\nhave prevented him from applying. Here, Plaintiff Kibby is on a defined track toward graduation\n\nfrom the Naval Academy and accession to the military. The track has been approved and\n\nsupported by his chain of command. Like any student at the Naval Academy, there are potential\n\nimpediments to his graduation. But Plaintiff Kibby has provided affirmative evidence of his\n\nability to overcome these impediments, and it is unlikely that his chain of command would have\n\n\n\n                                                 45\n\fadopted a transition plan if they doubted his ability to meet the Academy’s graduation\n\nrequirements. It is accordingly likely that he will graduate and attempt to accede. Anything else\n\nis the product of mere speculation. 6\n\n        The remaining question is whether Plaintiff Kibby is substantially likely to “hit” a barrier\n\nwhen he applies for accession to the military. As of January 2018, transgender individuals shall\n\nbe prohibited entry to the military, until such time that the President receives a recommendation\n\nto the contrary that he finds convincing. Given the President’s pronouncement that “the United\n\nStates government will not accept or allow transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the\n\nU.S. military,” there is no reason to believe that this directive will change by the time Plaintiff\n\nKibby is ready to apply for accession in May 2020. Chadwick Decl. ¶ 17. In short, the only\n\nbasis from which to conclude that the directive may change is the ever-present reality that every\n\nlaw is subject to change. But that is insufficient to deprive the Court of subject-matter\n\njurisdiction. Appalachian Power, 208 F.3d at 1022. Nor does the potential availability of a\n\nwaiver change this conclusion. First, Defendants have presented no evidence that waivers are\n\nactually made available to transgender individuals, or that they will be; and the only record\n\nevidence on this point suggests that transgender individuals are not entitled to waivers for\n\naccession purposes. See supra at 5–6. Second, even if a bona fide waiver process were made\n\navailable, Plaintiff Kibby would still be subject to a competitive barrier due to his transgender\n\n\n\n\n       6\n         Because the Court concludes that Plaintiff Kibby has a substantial likelihood of\nattempting to accede, the Court need not and does not decide whether Plaintiff Kohere has also\ndemonstrated a likelihood of accession sufficient to stake out an equal protection claim based on\nthe Accession Directive. See Town of Chester, N.Y. v. Laroe Estates, Inc., 137 S. Ct. 1645, 1651\n(2017) (“At least one plaintiff must have standing to seek each form of relief requested in the\ncomplaint.”); Rumsfeld v. Forum for Acad. & Institutional Rights, Inc., 547 U.S. 47, 53 (2006)\n(“the presence of one party with standing is sufficient to satisfy Article III’s case-or-controversy\nrequirement”).\n                                                 46\n\fstatus. For accession purposes, he would be presumptively disqualified because of his\n\ntransgender status, unless he obtains a waiver. Those who are not transgender are not subject to\n\nthe same blanket proscription. Consequently, a waiver process would not vitiate the barrier that\n\nPlaintiff Kibby claims is violative of equal protection. Accordingly, Plaintiff Kibby has\n\ndemonstrated that he is substantially likely to attempt to accede, and to encounter a competitive\n\nbarrier at the time of his accession due to his status as a transgender individual, which he claims\n\nis violative of equal protection. This is sufficient to confer standing to challenge the Accession\n\nDirective at this preliminary stage.\n\n       With respect to the Pseudonym Plaintiffs, there is no real doubt that they will remain in\n\nthe military for long enough to hit the “barrier” that they claim is violative of equal protection.\n\nEach has submitted a declaration stating, and/or alleged, their intention to remain in military\n\nservice, and Defendants have submitted declarations for each Pseudonym Plaintiff stating that\n\nthey shall not be discharged until the military’s new policy regarding transgender service\n\nmembers takes effect. See supra at 19–28; Defs.’ Mem at 10–12. There is also no real doubt\n\nthat they will face a competitive barrier to their continued retention by the military. As of March\n\n23, 2018, the military is required to effect a policy by which these service members can be\n\ndischarged solely due to their transgender status. This barrier to their continued retention is\n\nimposed upon them, but not other service members. And Plaintiffs claim that this competitive\n\nbarrier is violative of equal protection. Accordingly, at this preliminary stage, the Pseudonym\n\nPlaintiffs have demonstrated a substantial likelihood of standing to challenge the Presidential\n\nMemorandum’s Retention Directive. See Worth, 451 F.3d at 859 (“Under Adarand, . . . the\n\nrelevant consideration is whether the agency is sufficiently committed to a particular race-\n\nconscious policy that the plaintiff will likely face a career impediment.”).\n\n\n\n                                                 47\n\f                  iii. Substantial Risk of Injury\n\n       Plaintiffs have also established a substantial risk of two future injuries: denial of\n\naccession and discharge from military service. The substantial risk of these two future injuries is\n\nsufficient to constitute an injury in fact. As explained by the Supreme Court, “[a]n allegation of\n\nfuture injury may suffice if the threatened injury is certainly impending, or there is a substantial\n\nrisk that the harm will occur.” SBA List, 134 S. Ct. at 2341 (internal quotation marks omitted;\n\nciting Clapper, 133 S. Ct. at 1147, 1150, n.5). Here, even assuming that the future injuries are\n\nnot “certainly impending,” there is a “substantial risk” of their occurrence.\n\n       The D.C. Circuit has explained that “the proper way to analyze an increased-risk-of-harm\n\nclaim is to consider the ultimate alleged harm . . . as the concrete and particularized injury and\n\nthen to determine whether the increased risk of such harm makes injury to an individual citizen\n\nsufficiently imminent for standing purposes.” Attias v. Carefirst, Inc., 865 F.3d 620, 627 (D.C.\n\nCir. 2017) (internal quotation marks omitted). In some circumstances, the chain of events that is\n\nnecessary for the putative future harm to occur is too attenuated to constitute a substantial risk of\n\nthat harm and to render that harm imminent. Consequently, in Clapper, the Supreme Court\n\ndeclined to find standing because the plaintiffs’ “theory of standing [relied] on a highly\n\nattenuated chain of possibilities . . . .” 568 U.S. at 410. “Several links in this chain would have\n\nrequired the assumption that independent decisionmakers charged with policy discretion . . . and\n\nwith resolving complex legal and factual questions . . . would exercise their discretion in a\n\nspecific way. . . . With so many links in the causal chain, the injury that the plaintiffs feared was\n\ntoo speculative to qualify as ‘injury in fact.’” Attias, 865 F.3d at 626 (citation omitted).\n\nMeanwhile, in Attias, a personal data theft case, the D.C. Circuit found standing where the\n\nplaintiffs plausibly alleged that “an unauthorized party has already accessed personally\n\n\n\n                                                 48\n\fidentifying data on [the] servers, and it [was] much less speculative . . . to infer that this party\n\n[had] both the intent and the ability to use that data for ill.” Id. at 628. Here, there is no doubt\n\nthat the denial of accession and discharge from the military constitute concrete and particularized\n\ninjuries. Whether these are also imminent, based on the reasoning of Clapper and Attias,\n\nrequires an analysis of the degree to which these future harms are separated from the present by a\n\n“series of contingent events . . . .” Id.\n\n        In Navy Chaplaincy, the plaintiffs, military chaplains who were “non-liturgical\n\nProtestants,” alleged that “the Navy systematically discriminate[d] against members of their\n\nreligious denominations in the awarding of promotions in violation” of the Establishment Clause.\n\nIn re Navy Chaplaincy, 697 F.3d 1171, 1173 (D.C. Cir. 2012). The plaintiffs claimed standing\n\nfor purposes of prospective injunctive relief on the basis that “they face[d] future injury because\n\nthey [would] likely suffer discrimination on the basis of their religious denomination when they\n\nare considered for promotion . . . .” Id. at 1176. In the court’s view, the plaintiffs’ assertion of\n\nfuture injury depended on “two subsidiary premises: that plaintiffs will be considered for\n\npromotion by future selection boards and that selection boards will discriminate against them on\n\nthe basis of their religious denomination.” Id. The court found that the plaintiffs had\n\nsatisfactorily established both premises. With respect to the first, because the “Navy concede[d]\n\nthat future selection boards may very well consider the promotion of at least some plaintiffs.” Id.\n\nWith respect to the second, because “plaintiffs challenge[d] specific policies and procedures . . . .\n\nthat they claim[ed] resulted in denominational discrimination . . . .” Id.\n\n        Plaintiffs have demonstrated a chain of causation leading to concrete and particularized\n\ninjuries in which there are few links and each link is substantially likely to occur. With respect\n\nto the Accession Directive, Plaintiff Kibby will suffer an injury in fact if he: (i) graduates from\n\n\n\n                                                  49\n\fthe Naval Academy; (ii) applies for accession; and (iii) is denied accession due to his transgender\n\nstatus. The first two links in this chain are substantially likely to occur for the reasons already\n\nstated. See supra at 43–46. The third is likely to occur because the Presidential Memorandum\n\nindefinitely delays the accession of transgender individuals, and the President has unequivocally\n\nstated that transgender individuals shall not be permitted to serve in the military. Given this\n\nactuality, it is speculative to assume that transgender individuals will be permitted to accede by\n\nMay 2020. At present, there is a substantial risk that accession will remain forbidden, and\n\nPlaintiff Kibby will be precluded from military service.\n\n       For the Pseudonym Plaintiffs, the chain of causation is even shorter. They will suffer an\n\ninjury in fact if: (i) they remain in the military; and (ii) are discharged based on their transgender\n\nstatus after March 23, 2018 due to the Retention Directive. On the first point, there is no\n\ndisagreement that the Pseudonym Plaintiffs are qualified service members who desire to remain\n\nin military service. See supra at 19–28. On the second point, the available evidence is that the\n\nPresident—who ultimately controls the military—issued a statement that “the United States\n\ngovernment will not . . . allow transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S.\n\nmilitary,” and shortly thereafter, issued a Presidential Memorandum that requires the military to\n\nauthorize the discharge of transgender service members by March 23, 2018. True, it is\n\nconceivable that the Pseudonym Plaintiffs will not be discharged from the military, despite the\n\nhead of the military stating that they will be. But in the absence of a crystal ball, and in light of\n\nthese unequivocal factual circumstances, at the present time, the Pseudonym Plaintiffs face a\n\nsubstantial risk of discharge. This confers upon them an injury in fact.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  50\n\f                  iv. Plaintiffs Have Standing to Challenge the Accession and Retention\n                     Directives\n       For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs have established two injuries in fact with respect to\n\nthe Accession and Retention Directives. First, they have demonstrated a substantial likelihood\n\nthat they will face a competitive barrier with respect to accession and retention due to their\n\ntransgender status. Second, they have demonstrated a substantial risk that they will be denied\n\naccession or discharged from the military due to their transgender status. Defendants do not\n\ncontest that these injuries are caused by the Accession and Retention Directives of the\n\nPresidential Memorandum, or that they are redressable by judicial intervention, and the Court\n\nfinds that the causation and redressability elements of standing have been satisfied. Were it not\n\nfor the Presidential Memorandum, the blanket prohibition against accession by transgender\n\nindividuals would have expired on January 1, 2018. Because of the Presidential Memorandum,\n\nthat prohibition is extended indefinitely. Furthermore, the Presidential Memorandum requires\n\nthe reversion of military policy to one where individuals can be discharged solely based on their\n\ntransgender status. Previously, such action was prohibited by the June 2016 DTM. The\n\naccession and retention injuries are caused by the Presidential Memorandum, and they would be\n\nredressed to the extent the Court invalidates the directives of the memorandum. Accordingly,\n\nPlaintiffs have standing to challenge the Accession and Retention Directives.\n\n                  v. Plaintiffs Do Not Have Standing to Challenge the Sex Reassignment\n                     Surgery Directive\n\n       Although the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have standing to challenge the Accession\n\nand Retention Directives, none of the Plaintiffs have demonstrated an injury in fact with respect\n\nto the Sex Reassignment Surgery Directive. First, only some Plaintiffs are implicated by the\n\nprovision at all. For those that are, the risk of being impacted by the Sex Reassignment Surgery\n\nDirective is not sufficiently great to confer standing.\n\n                                                 51\n\f      Jane Doe 1 alleges that “a transition-related procedure Jane Doe 1 was scheduled for was\n\nsummarily canceled by the Defense Health Agency.” Am. Compl. ¶ 16. However, Defendants\n\nhave submitted a declaration representing that “Jane Doe 1’s application for the supplemental\n\nhealth care waiver necessary to receive a transition-related surgery is currently being processed\n\nby the Defense Health Agency.” Defs.’ Mem. at 10. Accordingly, Jane Doe 1 has not\n\ndemonstrated that she will not receive the surgery prior to the effective date of the Sex\n\nReassignment Surgery Directive.\n\n      Jane Doe 3 has developed a transition treatment plan, but will not begin her treatment until\n\nafter she returns from active deployment in Iraq. See supra at 22. Given the possibility of\n\ndischarge, the uncertainties attended by the fact that she has yet to begin any transition treatment,\n\nand the lack of certainty on when such treatment will begin, the prospective harm engendered by\n\nthe Sex Reassignment Surgery Directive is too speculative to constitute an injury in fact with\n\nrespect to Jane Doe 3. Furthermore, John Doe 1 is scheduled for transition related-surgery on\n\nJanuary 4, 2018, and Defendants have represented that this date remains unaffected by the\n\nPresidential Memorandum. Defs.’ Mem. at 11. Finally, the Named Plaintiffs are not currently in\n\nthe military and it is speculative whether they will need surgery while in military service.\n\nPlaintiff Kibby, in particular, has stated that he will transition prior to applying for accession.\n\nSee supra at 26–27. Accordingly, no Plaintiffs have demonstrated that they are substantially\n\nlikely to be impacted by the Sex Reassignment Surgery Directive, and none have standing to\n\nchallenge that directive.\n\n      2. Ripeness\n\n       Defendants also challenge the Court’s subject-matter jurisdiction on the basis of ripeness.\n\n“Determining whether administrative action is ripe for judicial review requires [the Court] to\n\n\n\n                                                  52\n\fevaluate (1) the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and (2) the hardship to the parties of\n\nwithholding court consideration.” Nat’l Park Hosp. Ass’n v. Dep’t of Interior, 538 U.S. 803, 808\n\n(2003). On the first prong, the Court must consider: “whether the issue is purely legal, whether\n\nconsideration of the issue would benefit from a more concrete setting, and whether the agency’s\n\naction is sufficiently final.” Nat’l Ass’n of Home Builders v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 440\n\nF.3d 459, 463–64 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). On the second prong, the\n\nCourt must consider “whether postponing judicial review would impose an undue burden on [the\n\nPlaintiffs] or would benefit the court.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n       A facial equal protection challenge is a purely legal question. See Beach Commc’ns, Inc.\n\nv. FCC, 959 F.2d 975, 986 (D.C. Cir. 1992). To the extent the Court considers factual issues\n\nwith respect to the equal protection analysis, they are only those facts that are already\n\nestablished: namely, those going to the basis for the issuance of the Presidential Memorandum.\n\nFuture factual development does not alter that basis, and is consequently irrelevant to the equal\n\nprotection analysis. Defendants do not contest this point. See XP Vehicles, Inc. v. Dep’t of\n\nEnergy, 118 F. Supp. 3d 38, 58 (D.D.C. 2015) (finding Fifth Amendment challenge to be a\n\npurely legal inquiry).\n\n       To a large extent, Defendants’ ripeness arguments have already been addressed in the\n\nstanding context. The Court reiterates its conclusion here. While there is present uncertainty\n\nregarding the exact details of the military’s future policy towards transgender service members,\n\nthere is no uncertainty regarding two directives of the Presidential Memorandum: the military\n\nmust authorize the discharge of transgender service members, and accession by transgender\n\nindividuals is prohibited, indefinitely. The Court does not adjudicate the details of that future\n\npolicy, but rather, only assesses whether these directives in-and-of-themselves violate the\n\n\n\n                                                  53\n\fConstitution. The directives are known, and so are the circumstances under which they were\n\nissued. They cannot be more concrete, and future policy by the military—absent action from the\n\nPresident—cannot change what the directives require. There is no reason to believe that the\n\nPresident will alter these directives, and the Court must assume that they will be faithfully\n\nexecuted by the military. See National Mining Association, 145 F.3d at 1408; Appalachian\n\nPower, 208 F.3d at 1022. Consequently, the constitutionality of the Accession and Retention\n\nDirectives is a matter fit for judicial resolution.\n\n        Furthermore, the nature of the equal protection analysis in this case, which assesses the\n\nfacial validity of the Presidential Memorandum, means that the Court would not benefit from\n\ndelay—the salient facts regarding the issuance of the Presidential Memorandum are not subject\n\nto change. This contrasts with the burden that delay would impose upon Plaintiffs, who must\n\ncontinue to serve or strive toward service, expending resources and declining other opportunities,\n\nwhile faced with the prospect of discharge and preclusion of military service, and the stigma that\n\nthe Presidential Memorandum attaches to service by transgender individuals. See supra at 19–\n\n28. Accordingly, the propriety of the Accession and Retention Directives is a matter ripe for\n\nadjudication.\n\n        Because Plaintiffs have established standing and ripeness with respect to the Accession\n\nand Retention Directives of the Presidential Memorandum, the Court turns to the merits.\n\nB. Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim\n\n        Plaintiffs assert two overarching claims in this case. Plaintiffs’ first broad claim is that,\n\nfor a variety of reasons, the Presidential Memorandum violates the guarantees of the Due Process\n\nClause of the Fifth Amendment. Plaintiffs’ second distinct claim is for estoppel. Defendants\n\nmove to dismiss both claims under Federal Rule 12(b)(6). For the same reasons the Court\n\nconcludes that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their Due Process Clause\n                                                      54\n\fchallenge for the purposes of their motion for preliminary injunction—discussed below—the\n\nCourt will not dismiss Plaintiffs’ Due Process Clause claims.\n\n       However, the Court will dismiss, without prejudice, Plaintiffs’ estoppel claim. The\n\nSupreme Court has expressed substantial skepticism with respect to government estoppel, noting\n\nthat when “the Government is unable to enforce the law because the conduct of its agents has\n\ngiven rise to an estoppel, the interest of the citizenry as a whole in obedience to the rule of law is\n\nundermined.” Heckler v. Cmty. Health Servs. of Crawford Cty., Inc., 467 U.S. 51, 60 (1984).\n\nNonetheless, the Court has refused to adopt “a flat rule that estoppel may not in any\n\ncircumstances run against the Government,” noting that “the public interest in ensuring that the\n\nGovernment can enforce the law free from estoppel might be outweighed by the countervailing\n\ninterest of citizens in some minimum standard of decency, honor, and reliability in their dealings\n\nwith their Government.” Id. at 60–61; see also Office of Pers. Mgmt. v. Richmond, 496 U.S. 414,\n\n419 (1990) (“From our earliest cases, we have recognized that equitable estoppel will not lie\n\nagainst the Government as it lies against private litigants.”).\n\n       Defendants contend that Plaintiffs’ estoppel claim fails because there is no recognized\n\nfederal cause of action for estoppel. Defs.’ Mem. at 37. The Court declines to dismiss Plaintiffs’\n\nclaim on this basis, however, because although judicial hostility has been expressed with respect\n\nto government estoppel, neither the Supreme Court or the D.C. Circuit have definitively ruled\n\nout the claim. In fact, recent decisions by the D.C. Circuit have at least assessed the claim on the\n\nmerits. See Masters Pharm., Inc. v. DEA, 861 F.3d 206, 225 (D.C. Cir. 2017); Morris\n\nCommc’ns, Inc. v. FCC, 566 F.3d 184, 191 (D.C. Cir. 2009); Graham v. SEC, 222 F.3d 994,\n\n1007 (D.C. Cir. 2000). Accordingly, at least by implication, the D.C. Circuit has recognized that\n\n\n\n\n                                                  55\n\fan estoppel claim may be brought against agency defendants—here, the Departments of Defense\n\nand Homeland Security—under certain circumstances.\n\n       The elements of a government estoppel claim are that “(1) the government made a\n\n‘definite representation’; (2) on which the entity ‘relied in such a manner as to change its\n\nposition for the worse’; (3) the entity’s reliance was reasonable; and (4) ‘the government\n\nengaged in affirmative misconduct.’” Masters Pharm., 861 F.3d at 225 (citations and alterations\n\nomitted). The affirmative misconduct element requires a showing “that government agents\n\nengage[d]—by commission or omission—in conduct that can be characterized as\n\nmisrepresentation or concealment, or, at least, behave[d] in ways that have or will cause an\n\negregiously unfair result.” GAO v. Gen. Accounting Office Pers. Appeals Bd., 698 F.2d 516, 526\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1983).\n\n       Based on the allegations in the Amended Complaint, the Court concludes that the facts of\n\nthis case are not actionable under an “estoppel” theory. Plaintiffs claim that the June 2016 DTM\n\n“constituted a definite representation to Plaintiffs that they would be able to serve openly.” Pls.’\n\nMem. at 26. However, the DTM was not a definite representation to any of the individuals\n\nPlaintiffs, but rather constituted a broad policy decision by the government that affected scores\n\nof individuals. The DTM did not specifically represent to any particular individual that he or she\n\nwould be permitted to serve. The cases that Plaintiffs cite are distinguishable on this basis. For\n\nexample, in Watkins, the Ninth Circuit estopped the Army from refusing to reenlist the plaintiff\n\n“on the basis of his homosexuality” because “the Army affirmatively acted in violation of its\n\nown regulations when it repeatedly represented that [the plaintiff] was eligible to reenlist, as well\n\nas when it reenlisted him time after time.” Watkins v. U.S. Army, 875 F.2d 699, 707–08, 731\n\n(9th Cir. 1989). These representations were directed at the plaintiff, because on “the one\n\n\n\n                                                 56\n\foccasion when the record was unclear, [the plaintiff] sought clarification and his classification\n\nwas immediately changed from ‘unknown’ to ‘eligible for reentry on active duty.’” Id. at 707.\n\nSimilarly, in Johnson, the Ninth Circuit estopped the government from rescinding the plaintiff’s\n\nparole “after his parole computation had passed successfully through as many as eight\n\nadministrative reviews . . . .” Johnson v. Williford, 682 F.2d 868, 872 (9th Cir. 1982).\n\n       It may be that some Plaintiffs have detrimentally relied upon specific representations\n\nfrom their chain of command that could more plausibly support a government estoppel claim, but\n\nif that is the case, those instances are not adequately alleged; only generalized assertions of\n\nreliance are asserted in the complaint. See, e.g., Am. Compl. ¶ 3 (“Plaintiffs, along with many\n\nother service members, have followed protocol in informing their chain of command that they\n\nare transgender. They did so in reliance on the United States’ express promises that it would\n\npermit them to continue to serve their country openly.”); ¶ 14 (“In or around June 2016, in\n\nreliance on the issuance of the policy permitting open service by transgender service members,\n\nJane Doe 1 notified her command that she is transgender.”); ¶ 31 (“After June 2016, in reliance\n\non the announcement that transgender people would be permitted to serve openly, she notified\n\nher superiors that she is transgender. She has served in the intervening time without incident.”).\n\nAllowing estoppel claims to go forward based on such generalized theories of reliance would\n\nseem to implicate the reasonable concerns other courts have raised about government estoppel.\n\n       Furthermore, Plaintiffs have not plausibly alleged that government agents have engaged\n\nin specific instances of “affirmative misconduct.” No affirmative instances of misrepresentation\n\nor concealment have been plausibly alleged. While Plaintiffs point to the revocation of the June\n\n2016 DTM—via the Presidential Memorandum—as “egregiously unfair,” they fail to articulate\n\nhow that unfairness is the product of “misconduct” as the Court understands that term in this\n\n\n\n                                                 57\n\fcontext. See Pl.’s Mem. at 28. Because these specific facts have not been plausibly alleged, the\n\nCourt shall not permit the estoppel claim to proceed at this time. Accordingly, the claim is\n\ndismissed without prejudice.\n\nC. Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction\n\n       Having determined that Plaintiffs have standing to challenge the Accession and Retention\n\nDirectives and that their claims are ripe, the Court moves on to consider Plaintiffs’ motion for\n\npreliminary injunction. Plaintiffs ask the Court to enjoin the enforcement of the Accession and\n\nRetention Directives pending the final resolution of this lawsuit. The Court will grant Plaintiffs’\n\nmotion. The Court finds (1) that Plaintiffs have a likelihood of succeeding on their claim that the\n\nAccession and Retention Directives violate the Fifth Amendment, (2) that Plaintiffs would suffer\n\nirreparable injury in the absence of an injunction, and (3) that the balance of equities and the\n\npublic interest favor granting injunctive relief.\n\n       1. Likelihood of Success on the Merits\n\n       Although Plaintiffs’ estoppel claim has been dismissed, the Court is convinced that\n\nPlaintiffs are likely to succeed in this lawsuit under the Fifth Amendment. The Due Process\n\nClause of the Fifth Amendment provides that “No person shall be . . . deprived of life, liberty, or\n\nproperty, without due process of law.” U.S. Const. amend. V. Although Plaintiffs have\n\nsuggested a number of different analytical frameworks for considering whether the Accession\n\nand Retention Directives violate this guarantee, the Court finds the framework applicable to the\n\nDue Process Clause’s equal protection component most relevant. “In numerous decisions, [the\n\nSupreme Court] ‘has held that the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment forbids the\n\nFederal Government to deny equal protection of the laws.’” Davis v. Passman, 442 U.S. 228,\n\n234 (1979) (quoting Vance v. Bradley, 440 U.S. 93, 94 n.1 (1979)); see also United States v.\n\n\n\n                                                    58\n\fWindsor, 133 S. Ct. 2675, 2695 (2013) (“The liberty protected by the Fifth Amendment’s Due\n\nProcess Clause contains within it the prohibition against denying to any person the equal\n\nprotection of the laws.”). To determine whether the Accession and Retention Directives violate\n\nthe Due Process Clause’s guarantee because they deny the equal protection of the laws to\n\ntransgender Americans, the Court must decide (a) the level of scrutiny applicable, and (b)\n\nwhether the Accession and Retention Directives are likely to survive that level of scrutiny. 7\n\n               a. Level of Scrutiny\n\n       The general rule is that government action that treats certain classes of people differently\n\n“is presumed to be valid and will be sustained if the classification drawn . . . is rationally related\n\nto a legitimate state interest.” City of Cleburne, Tex. v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 440\n\n(1985). However, this general rule does not apply where the government action draws\n\ndistinctions between individuals based on certain suspect or quasi-suspect classifications. Id. at\n\n440–41. In those instances, the Court must apply a heightened degree of scrutiny. Id.\n\n       At this preliminary stage of the case, the Court is persuaded that it must apply a\n\nheightened degree of scrutiny to the Accession and Retention Directives. The Court reaches this\n\nconclusion for two reasons. First, on the current record, transgender individuals—who are alone\n\ntargeted for exclusion by the Accession and Retention Directives—appear to satisfy the criteria\n\nof at least a quasi-suspect classification. “The Supreme Court has used several explicit criteria to\n\nidentify suspect and quasi-suspect classifications.” Padula v. Webster, 822 F.2d 97, 102 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1987). The Court has observed that a suspect class is one that has “experienced a ‘history of\n\npurposeful unequal treatment’ or been subjected to unique disabilities on the basis of stereotyped\n\n\n\n       7\n         At the threshold, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs’ claims are unlikely to succeed on the\nmerits because Plaintiffs lack standing and their claims are not ripe. The Court has already\nfound that Plaintiffs have standing and ripe claims.\n                                                  59\n\fcharacteristics not truly indicative of their abilities.” Massachusetts Bd. of Ret. v. Murgia, 427\n\nU.S. 307, 313 (1976) (quoting San Antonio Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 28\n\n(1973)). Also relevant is whether the group has been “relegated to such a position of political\n\npowerlessness as to command extraordinary protection from the majoritarian political process.”\n\nId. Finally, the Supreme Court has also considered whether the group “exhibit[s] obvious,\n\nimmutable, or distinguishing characteristics that define them as a discrete group.” Lyng v.\n\nCastillo, 477 U.S. 635, 638 (1986).\n\n       The transgender community satisfies these criteria. Transgender individuals have\n\nimmutable and distinguishing characteristics that make them a discernable class. See, e.g.,\n\nMedical Amici Brief at 3-13 (describing what it means to be transgender). 8 As a class,\n\ntransgender individuals have suffered, and continue to suffer, severe persecution and\n\ndiscrimination. See, e.g., State Amici Brief at 3 (describing the discrimination the transgender\n\ncommunity suffers); Trevor Project Amici Brief at 10-12, 15-16 (discussing the harmful effects\n\nof discrimination against transgender youth); see also Whitaker By Whitaker v. Kenosha Unified\n\nSch. Dist. No. 1 Bd. of Educ., 858 F.3d 1034, 1051 (7th Cir. 2017) (holding that “[t]here is no\n\ndenying that transgender individuals face discrimination, harassment, and violence because of\n\ntheir gender identity,” and noting report by the National Center for Transgender Equality finding\n\n\n\n       8\n          The Motions for Leave to File Amici Curiae Briefs in Support of Plaintiffs filed by\nMedical, Nursing, Mental Health, and other Health Care Organizations, ECF No. 44 (“Medical\nAmici Brief”), The Trevor Project, ECF No. 49 (“Trevor Project Amici Brief”), Massachusetts,\nCalifornia, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, New Mexico, New York,\nOregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and the District of Columbia, ECF No. 50 (“State\nAmici Brief”), and the National Center for Transgender Equality, the Tennessee Transgender\nPolitical Coalition, TGI Network of Rhode Island, the Transgender Allies Group, the\nTransgender Legal Defense & Education Fund, TransOhio, the Transgender Resource Center of\nNew Mexico, and the Southern Arizona Gender Alliance, ECF No. 52, are GRANTED. These\namici briefs have assisted the Court in reaching its decision.\n\n\n                                                 60\n\fthat 78% of students who identify as transgender or as gender non-conformant report being\n\nharassed while in grades K-12). Despite this discrimination, the Court is aware of no argument\n\nor evidence suggesting that being transgender in any way limits one’s ability to contribute to\n\nsociety. See State Amici Brief at 2; Medical Amici Brief at 2; Trevor Project Amici Brief at 9.\n\nThe exemplary military service of Plaintiffs in this case certainly suggests that it does not.\n\nFinally, transgender people as a group represent a very small subset of society lacking the sort of\n\npolitical power other groups might harness to protect themselves from discrimination. See\n\nMedical Amici Brief at 4 (noting that recent estimates suggest that transgender individuals make\n\nup approximately 0.6 percent of the adult population in the United States); see also Adkins v.\n\nCity of New York, 143 F. Supp. 3d 134, 140 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) (noting that there is “no indication\n\nthat there have ever been any transgender members of the United States Congress or the federal\n\njudiciary”).\n\n       Although the Court is aware of no binding precedent on this issue, it has taken note of the\n\nfindings and conclusions of a number of other courts from across the country that have also\n\nfound that discrimination on the basis of someone’s transgender identity is a quasi-suspect form\n\nof classification that triggers heightened scrutiny. See Evancho v. Pine-Richland Sch. Dist., 237\n\nF. Supp. 3d 267, 288 (W.D. Pa. 2017) (holding that “all of the indicia for the application of the\n\nheightened intermediate scrutiny standard are present” for transgender individuals); Bd. of Educ.\n\nof the Highland Local Sch. Dist. v. United States Dep’t of Educ., 208 F. Supp. 3d 850, 872–74\n\n(S.D. Ohio 2016) (finding that “transgender status is a quasi-suspect class under the Equal\n\nProtection Clause”); Adkins, 143 F. Supp. 3d at 140 (“[T]he Court concludes that transgender\n\npeople are a quasi-suspect class” and “[a]ccordingly, the Court must apply intermediate scrutiny\n\nto defendants’ treatment of plaintiff”).\n\n\n\n                                                 61\n\f       Second, the Court is also persuaded that the Accession and Retention Directives are a\n\nform of discrimination on the basis of gender, which is itself subject to intermediate scrutiny. It\n\nis well-established that gender-based discrimination includes discrimination based on non-\n\nconformity with gender stereotypes. See Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228, 251 (1989)\n\n(“[W]e are beyond the day when an employer could evaluate employees by assuming or insisting\n\nthat they matched the stereotype associated with their group”). The Accession and Retention\n\nDirectives’ exclusion of transgender individuals inherently discriminates against current and\n\naspiring service members on the basis of their failure to conform to gender stereotypes. The\n\ndefining characteristic of a transgender individual is that their inward identity, behavior, and\n\npossibly their physical characteristics, do not conform to stereotypes of how an individual of\n\ntheir assigned sex should feel, act and look. See Medical Amici Brief at 3-13. By excluding an\n\nentire category of people from military service on this characteristic alone, the Accession and\n\nRetention Directives punish individuals for failing to adhere to gender stereotypes. See\n\nWhitaker, 858 F.3d at 1051 (holding that heightened scrutiny used for sex-based classifications\n\napplied to school policy requiring transgender student to use bathroom of sex listed on his birth\n\ncertificate because it “treat[ed] transgender students . . . who fail to conform to the sex-based\n\nstereotypes associated with their assigned sex at birth, differently. . . . These students are\n\ndisciplined under the School District’s bathroom policy if they choose to use a bathroom that\n\nconforms to their gender identity”); Glenn v. Brumby, 663 F.3d 1312, 1317 (11th Cir. 2011)\n\n(holding that “discrimination against a transgender individual because of her gender-\n\nnonconformity is sex discrimination”); Smith v. City of Salem, Ohio, 378 F.3d 566, 577 (6th Cir.\n\n2004) (holding that the facts alleged by transsexual plaintiff to support his claims of gender\n\ndiscrimination on the basis of sex stereotyping “easily constitute a claim of sex discrimination\n\n\n\n                                                  62\n\fgrounded in the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution”). A service member who was born\n\na male is punished by the Accession and Retention Directives if he identifies as a woman,\n\nwhereas that same service member would be free to join and remain in the military if he was\n\nborn a female, or if he agreed to act in the way society expects males to act. The Accession and\n\nRetention Directives are accordingly inextricably intertwined with gender classifications.\n\n       For these two reasons, the Court will apply an intermediate level of scrutiny to\n\nDefendants’ exclusion of transgender individuals from the military, akin to the level of scrutiny\n\napplicable in gender discrimination cases. Before moving on to that analysis, however, the Court\n\npauses to note that meaningful scrutiny of the constitutionality of the Accession and Retention\n\nDirectives is appropriate despite the fact that they pertain to decisions about military personnel.\n\nAlthough the Court recognizes that deference to the Executive and Congress is warranted in the\n\nmilitary context, the Court is not powerless to assess whether the constitutional rights of\n\nAmerica’s service members have been violated. The D.C. Circuit has explained that although\n\n“the operation of the military is vested in Congress and the Executive, and . . . it is not for the\n\ncourts to establish the composition of the armed forces[,] . . . constitutional questions that arise\n\nout of military decisions regarding the composition of the armed forces are not committed to the\n\nother coordinate branches of government.” Emory v. Sec’y of Navy, 819 F.2d 291, 294 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1987). “Where it is alleged, as it is here, that the armed forces have trenched upon\n\nconstitutionally guaranteed rights through the promotion and selection process, the courts are not\n\npowerless to act.” Id. “The military has not been exempted from constitutional provisions that\n\nprotect the rights of individuals” and, indeed, “[i]t is precisely the role of the courts to determine\n\nwhether those rights have been violated.” Id.; see also Chappell v. Wallace, 462 U.S. 296, 304\n\n(1983) (“This Court has never held, nor do we now hold, that military personnel are barred from\n\n\n\n                                                  63\n\fall redress in civilian courts for constitutional wrongs suffered in the course of military\n\nservice.”); Matlovich v. Sec’y of the Air Force, 591 F.2d 852, 859 (D.C. Cir. 1978) (“It is\n\nestablished, of course, that the federal courts have the power and the duty to inquire whether a\n\nmilitary discharge was properly issued under the Constitution.”).\n\n              b. Application of Intermediate Scrutiny\n\n       Having determined that an intermediate level of heightened scrutiny should apply to the\n\nAccession and Retention Directives’ discrimination against transgender individuals, the Court\n\nmoves on to assessing whether Plaintiffs are likely to succeed when that level of scrutiny is\n\nactually applied. Under intermediate scrutiny, the government must demonstrate an\n\n“exceedingly persuasive justification” for its actions. United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515,\n\n531 (1996). “The burden of justification is demanding and it rests entirely on” the government.\n\nId. at 533. The government “must show ‘at least that the [challenged] classification serves\n\nimportant governmental objectives and that the discriminatory means employed are substantially\n\nrelated to the achievement of those objectives.’” Id. (quoting Mississippi Univ. for Women v.\n\nHogan, 458 U.S. 718, 724 (1982) (internal quotations omitted)). “The justification must be\n\ngenuine, not hypothesized or invented post hoc in response to litigation.” Id. “And it must not\n\nrely on overbroad generalizations about the different talents, capacities, or preferences of males\n\nand females.” Id. Finally, it is well established that “[t]he Constitution’s guarantee of equality\n\n‘must at the very least mean that a bare . . . desire to harm a politically unpopular group cannot’\n\njustify disparate treatment of that group.” Windsor, 133 S. Ct. at 2693 (quoting U. S. Dep’t of\n\nAgric. v. Moreno, 413 U.S. 528, 534-35 (1973)).\n\n       Applying these standards, the Court finds that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed in\n\ndemonstrating that the Accession and Retention Directives’ exclusion of transgender individuals\n\n\n\n                                                 64\n\ffrom the military is unconstitutional. At the outset, the Court reiterates precisely what is at issue\n\nin this case: a policy banning the accession, and allowing the discharge, of an entire category of\n\nindividuals from the military solely because they are transgender, despite their ability to meet all\n\nof the physical, psychological, and other standards for military service. Defendants argue that\n\nthis policy is necessary for three reasons. First, Defendants argue that “at least some transgender\n\nindividuals suffer from medical conditions that could impede the performance of their duties.”\n\nDefs.’ Mem. at 31. Second, Defendants argue that “there is room for the military to think” that\n\ncertain medical conditions “may limit the deployability of transgender individuals as well as\n\nimpose additional costs on the armed forces.” Id. at 32. Third, Defendants argue that “the\n\nPresident could reasonably conclude” that the presence of transgender individuals in the military\n\nwould harm “unit cohesion.” Id. at 33. 9\n\n        Plaintiffs do not dispute that maximizing military effectiveness, lethality and unit\n\ncohesion, and even budgetary considerations, are all important or at least legitimate government\n\ninterests. Pls.’ Mem. at 17. They do challenge, however, whether Defendants can satisfy their\n\nburden of demonstrating that the discriminatory means that have been employed in the\n\nPresidential Memorandum—the Accession and Retention Directives—are “substantially related”\n\nto the achievement of these objectives. Based on the combined effect of a number of unusual\n\nfactors, the Court finds it likely that Plaintiffs will succeed on this claim.\n\n        First, the reasons given for the decision to exclude transgender service members appear to\n\nbe hypothetical and extremely overbroad. For instance, Defendants cite concerns that “some”\n\ntransgender individuals “could” suffer from medical conditions that impede their duties, and\n\n\n\n        9\n         Plaintiffs note that similar arguments were proffered in support of prior policies\nprecluding service members from being openly gay, maintaining racially segregated ranks and\nexcluding women from military colleges.\n                                                  65\n\fassert that “there is room for the military to think” that transgender people may be limited in\n\ntheir deployability at times. As an initial matter, these hypothetical concerns could be raised\n\nabout any service members. Moreover, these concerns do not explain the need to discharge and\n\ndeny accession to all transgender people who meet the relevant physical, mental and medical\n\nstandards for service. The Accession and Retention Directives are accordingly extremely\n\noverbroad when considered in the light of their proffered justifications. See Romer v. Evans, 517\n\nU.S. 620, 632 (1996) (holding that law’s “sheer breadth is so discontinuous with the reasons\n\noffered for it that [it] seems inexplicable by anything but animus toward the class it affects”).\n\nThe breadth of the Accession and Retention Directives is also discontinuous with the purported\n\nconcern about costs, which, in addition to having been found to be minimal or negligible,\n\napparently are primarily related to a surgical procedure that only a subset of transgender\n\nindividuals will even need. Similarly, Defendants provide practically no explanation at all, let\n\nalone support, for their suggestion that the presence of transgender individuals may be harmful to\n\n“unit cohesion.” 10 Indeed, Defendants themselves highlight the absence of any prior studies or\n\nevaluations supporting the proffered justifications by arguing that they must now conduct studies\n\nregarding transgender military service before they can adequately defend the President’s\n\ndecision. At most, Defendants’ reasons appear therefore to be based on unsupported, “overbroad\n\ngeneralizations about the different talents, capacities, or preferences,” of transgender people.\n\nVirginia, 518 U.S. at 533.\n\n\n\n\n       10\n          To the extent this is a thinly-veiled reference to an assumption that other service\nmembers are biased against transgender people, this would not be a legitimate rationale for the\nchallenged policy. “Private biases may be outside the reach of the law, but the law cannot,\ndirectly or indirectly, give them effect.” See Palmore v. Sidoti, 466 U.S. 429, 433 (1984).\n                                                 66\n\f       Nonetheless, given the deference owed to military personnel decisions, the Court has not\n\nbased its conclusion solely on the speculative and overbroad nature of the President’s reasons. A\n\nsecond point is also crucial. As far as the Court is aware at this preliminary stage, all of the\n\nreasons proffered by the President for excluding transgender individuals from the military in this\n\ncase were not merely unsupported, but were actually contradicted by the studies, conclusions\n\nand judgment of the military itself. As described above, the effect of transgender individuals\n\nserving in the military had been studied by the military immediately prior to the issuance of the\n\nPresidential Memorandum. In connection with the working group chaired by the Under\n\nSecretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, the RAND National Defense Research\n\nInstitute conducted a study and issued a report largely debunking any potential concerns about\n\nunit cohesion, military readiness, deployability or health care costs related to transgender\n\nmilitary service. The Department of Defense Working Group, made up of senior uniformed\n\nofficers and senior civilian officers from each military department, unanimously concluded that\n\nthere were no barriers that should prevent transgender individuals from serving in the military,\n\nrejecting the very concerns supposedly underlying the Accession and Retention Directives. In\n\nfact, the Working Group concluded that prohibiting transgender service members would\n\nundermine military effectiveness and readiness. Next, the Army, Air Force and Navy each\n\nconcluded that transgender individuals should be allowed to serve. Finally, the Secretary of\n\nDefense concluded that the needs of the military were best served by allowing transgender\n\nindividuals to openly serve. In short, the military concerns purportedly underlying the\n\nPresident’s decision had been studied and rejected by the military itself. 11 This highly unusual\n\n\n\n       11\n          This differentiates this case from Goldman v. Weinberger, 475 U.S. 503, 508 (1986), a\ncase cited by Defendants, in which the court deferred to a decision that was based on the\n“considered professional judgment of the Air Force.”\n                                                 67\n\fsituation is further evidence that the reasons offered for the Accession and Retention Directives\n\nwere not substantially related to the military interests the Presidential Memorandum cited.\n\n       Third, the Court has also considered the circumstances surrounding the announcement of\n\nthe President’s policy. “In determining whether a law is motived by an improper animus or\n\npurpose, ‘[d]iscriminations of an unusual character’ especially require careful consideration.”\n\nWindsor, 133 S. Ct. at 2693 (quoting Romer, 517 U.S. at 633). The discrimination in this case\n\nwas certainly of an unusual character. As explained above, after a lengthy review process by\n\nsenior military personnel, the military had recently determined that permitting transgender\n\nindividuals to serve would not have adverse effects on the military and had announced that such\n\nindividuals were free to serve openly. Many transgender service members identified themselves\n\nto their commanding officers in reliance on that pronouncement. Then, the President abruptly\n\nannounced, via Twitter—without any of the formality or deliberative processes that generally\n\naccompany the development and announcement of major policy changes that will gravely affect\n\nthe lives of many Americans—that all transgender individuals would be precluded from\n\nparticipating in the military in any capacity. These circumstances provide additional support for\n\nPlaintiffs’ claim that the decision to exclude transgender individuals was not driven by genuine\n\nconcerns regarding military efficacy. See Vill. of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp.,\n\n429 U.S. 252, 267 (1977) (holding that “[t]he specific sequence of events leading up the\n\nchallenged decision . . . may shed some light on the decisionmaker’s purposes” and “[d]epartures\n\nfrom the normal procedural sequence also might afford evidence that improper purposes are\n\nplaying a role”).\n\n       In sum, even if none of the reasons discussed above alone would be sufficient for the\n\nCourt to conclude that Plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their Fifth Amendment claim, taken\n\n\n\n                                                68\n\ftogether they are highly suggestive of a constitutional violation. The likelihood of success factor\n\naccordingly weighs in favor of granting preliminary injunctive relief. For the same reasons, the\n\nCourt will deny Defendants’ motion to dismiss Plaintiffs’ claims under the Due Process Clause.\n\n        Defendants make a few additional points regarding the merits of Plaintiffs’ claims that\n\nmust be addressed. First, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs cannot demonstrate a likelihood of\n\nsuccess on the merits regarding the Presidential Memorandum’s policy for enlisted service\n\nmembers in particular because Secretary Mattis’ Interim Guidance is the “operative policy,” and\n\nthat guidance “does not impermissibly classify service members based on transgender status, but\n\nrather prohibits disparate treatment of existing service members based on transgender status.”\n\nDefs.’ Mem. at 24. This may be true, but the focus of Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint is not the\n\nInterim Guidance, but the Presidential Memorandum. The Accession and Retention Directives\n\nof the Presidential Memorandum require the return to a policy that “generally prohibit[s] openly\n\ntransgender individuals from accession into the United States military and authorize[s] the\n\ndischarge of such individuals.” Presidential Memorandum § 1(a). This overt disparate\n\ntreatment, which will become effective when Secretary Mattis’ Interim Guidance elapses early\n\nnext year, is the subject of Plaintiffs’ lawsuit.\n\n        Second, Defendants cite a number of cases for the proposition that the Presidential\n\nMemorandum “is subject to a highly deferential form of review.” Defs.’ Mem. at 27. The Court\n\nhas reviewed those cases and determined that none of them require the Court to apply a different\n\nlevel of scrutiny than has been applied here. Of primary importance is the Supreme Court’s\n\nopinion in Rostker v. Goldberg, 453 U.S. 57 (1981). The Supreme Court in Rostker expressly\n\ndeclined to hold that the intermediate scrutiny applicable to gender discrimination did not apply\n\nin the military personnel context. Id. at 69. Instead, the Court reviewed the particular facts\n\n\n\n                                                    69\n\fbefore it and found that the district court in that case had not sufficiently deferred to the reasoned\n\ndecision of Congress in the context of a particular military personnel-related decision.\n\n       The facts of that case are strikingly different than those presented here. In Rostker, the\n\nCourt noted that “Congress did not act unthinkingly or reflexively and not for any considered\n\nreason,” when it passed the challenged policy. Id. at 72 (internal quotations omitted). To the\n\ncontrary, the Court noted Congress’ “studied choice of one alternative in preference to another,”\n\nand relied on the fact that the policy at issue in that case had been “extensively considered by\n\nCongress in hearings, floor debate, and in committee.” Id. In other words, Congress had\n\nreceived extensive evidence on the issue, and simply chose one of two competing alternatives.\n\nThe Supreme Court found that “[t]he District Court was quite wrong in undertaking an\n\nindependent evaluation of this evidence, rather than adopting an appropriately deferential\n\nexamination of Congress’ evaluation of that evidence.” Id. at 82-83.\n\n       The study and evaluation of evidence that the Rostker Court found warranted judicial\n\ndeference is completely absent from the current record. Contrary to Defendants’ assertion, this\n\ndoes not appear to be a case where the Court is required to pick sides in a “battle of experts.”\n\nDefs.’ Mem. at 32. To the contrary, the record at this stage of the case shows that the reasons\n\noffered for categorically excluding transgender individuals were not supported and were in fact\n\ncontradicted by the only military judgment available at the time. Accordingly, unlike the district\n\ncourt in Rostker, the Court’s analysis in this Opinion has not been based on an independent\n\nevaluation of evidence or faulting of the President for choosing between two alternatives based\n\non competing evidence.\n\n       Third, Defendants seem to argue that they are free of the obligation of rationalizing the\n\nAccession and Retention Directives because the directives are a mere continuation of a long-\n\n\n\n                                                 70\n\fstanding policy. This is false. The Accession and Retention Directives constituted a revocation\n\nfrom transgender people of rights they were previously given. Before the Accession and\n\nRetention Directives, transgender people had already been given the right to serve openly and the\n\nright to accede by a date certain in early 2018. The Accession and Retention Directives took\n\nthose rights away from transgender people and transgender people only. The targeted revocation\n\nof rights from a particular class of people which they had previously enjoyed—for however short\n\na period of time—is a fundamentally different act than not giving those rights in the first place,\n\nand it will be the government’s burden in this case to show that this act was substantially related\n\nto important government objectives. See Perry v. Brown, 671 F.3d 1052, 1079-80 (9th Cir.\n\n2012), vacated and remanded sub nom. Hollingsworth v. Perry, 133 S. Ct. 2652 (2013)\n\n(“Withdrawing from a disfavored group the right to obtain a designation with significant societal\n\nconsequences is different from declining to extend that designation in the first place, regardless\n\nof whether the right was withdrawn after a week, a year, or a decade.”). Targeted revocations of\n\nrights are a factor that has been present in a number of cases finding equal protection violations.\n\nSee Romer, 517 U.S. at 627 (holding that law that “withdr[ew] from homosexuals, but no others,\n\nspecific legal protection . . . and . . . forb[ade] reinstatement of these laws and policies” was\n\nunconstitutional); Windsor, 133 S. Ct. at 2695–96 (holding that the purpose of a law that\n\n“impose[d] a disability on [a] class by refusing to acknowledge a status” previously granted was\n\nto “disparage and to injure those” in that class).\n\n       Finally, Defendants argue that the military’s previous study of transgender service cannot\n\nforever bind future administrations from looking into the issue themselves. The Court fully\n\nagrees with this point. The Court by no means suggests that it was not within the President’s\n\nauthority to order that additional studies be undertaken and that this policy be reevaluated. If the\n\n\n\n                                                     71\n\fPresident had done so and then decided that banning all transgender individuals from serving in\n\nthe military was beneficial to the various military objectives cited, this would be a different case.\n\nBut as discussed above, that is not the case before the Court. The Court can only assess\n\nPlaintiffs’ equal protection claim based on the facts before it. At this time, it appears that the\n\nrights of a class of individuals were summarily and abruptly revoked for reasons contrary to the\n\nonly then-available studies. As explained above, based on the cumulative effect of various\n\nunusual facts, the Court is convinced that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their\n\nFifth Amendment claim. This finding in no way should be interpreted to prevent Defendants\n\nfrom continuing to study issues surrounding the service of transgender individuals in the\n\nmilitary, as they have asserted that they intend to do.\n\n       The Court concludes this portion of its Memorandum Opinion with a caveat. This case\n\ncomes before the Court on Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction and Defendants’\n\nmotion to dismiss. It is accordingly still at its very earliest stages, and the record is necessarily\n\nlimited. The Court’s task at this time is to determine whether Plaintiffs have stated plausible\n\nclaims and demonstrated a likelihood—not a certainty—of success based on the present record.\n\nThe Court is persuaded that Plaintiffs have made these fairly modest showings, but this is not a\n\nfinal adjudication of the merits of Plaintiffs’ claims.\n\n       2. Irreparable Injury\n\n       Next, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have demonstrated that they would suffer irreparable\n\ninjury in the absence of preliminary injunctive relief. In order to satisfy the irreparable injury\n\nrequirement, “[f]irst, the injury ‘must be both certain and great; it must be actual and not\n\ntheoretical.’” Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches v. England, 454 F.3d 290, 297 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2006) (citation omitted). “Second, the injury must be beyond remediation.” Id.\n\n\n\n                                                  72\n\f       These elements are met here. Defendants argue that “for much the same reasons they\n\nlack standing, Plaintiffs cannot show that they will suffer certain, great, or any actual injuries if\n\nthe Court does not enter an injunction.” Defs.’ Mem. at 21. The Court has already rejected those\n\narguments in the context of finding that Plaintiffs have standing, at least with respect to the\n\nAccession and Retention Directives, and rejects them again in this context. Absent an\n\ninjunction, Plaintiffs will suffer a number of harms that cannot be remediated after that fact even\n\nif Plaintiffs were to eventually succeed in this lawsuit. The impending ban brands and\n\nstigmatizes Plaintiffs as less capable of serving in the military, reduces their stature among their\n\npeers and officers, stunts the growth of their careers, and threatens to derail their chosen calling\n\nor access to unique educational opportunities. See Elzie v. Aspin, 841 F. Supp. 439, 443 (D.D.C.\n\n1993) (holding that plaintiff would suffer irreparable injury in the absence of preliminary\n\ninjunctive relief because “plaintiff faces the stigma of being removed from active duty as a\n\nsergeant in the Marine Corps—a position which he has performed in a sterling fashion for eleven\n\nyears—and labeled as unfit for service solely on the basis of his sexual orientation, a criterion\n\nwhich has no bearing on his ability to perform his job”). Money damages or other corrective\n\nforms of relief will not be able to fully remediate these injuries once they occur. Moreover, these\n\ninjuries are also imminent, in that they are either ongoing or, at the latest, will begin when the\n\nAccession and Retention Directives take effect early next year.\n\n       These injuries are irreparable for the additional reason that they are the result of alleged\n\nviolations of Plaintiffs’ rights to equal protection of the laws under the Fifth Amendment. “It has\n\nlong been established that the loss of constitutional freedoms, ‘for even minimal periods of time,\n\nunquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.’” Mills v. District of Columbia, 571 F.3d 1304,\n\n1312 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (quoting Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976)); see also Gordon v.\n\n\n\n                                                  73\n\fHolder, 721 F.3d 638, 653 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (“‘[A] prospective violation of a constitutional right\n\nconstitutes irreparable injury.’”) (quoting Davis v. District of Columbia, 158 F.3d 1342, 1346\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1998)); Chaplaincy, 454 F.3d at 305 (“By alleging that Appellees are engaging in\n\nconduct that violates the Establishment Clause, Appellants have satisfied the irreparable injury\n\nprong of the preliminary injunction framework.”). Under this line of authority, Plaintiffs’\n\nallegation of constitutional injury is sufficient to satisfy the irreparable injury requirement for\n\nissuance of a preliminary injunction.\n\n       3. Balance of Equities and Public Interest\n\n       Finally, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have shown that the public interest and the balance\n\nof hardships weigh in favor of granting injunctive relief. “A party seeking a preliminary\n\ninjunction must demonstrate both ‘that the balance of equities tips in [its] favor, and that an\n\ninjunction is in the public interest.’” FBME Bank Ltd. v. Lew, 125 F. Supp. 3d 109, 127 (D.D.C.\n\n2015) (quoting Winter, 555 U.S. at 20) (alteration in original). “These factors merge when the\n\nGovernment is the opposing party.” Id. (quoting Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009)).\n\n       As already established, the Presidential Memorandum is causing Plaintiffs serious\n\nongoing harms and will cause them further harms in the near future absent an injunction. On this\n\nrecord, there are no countervailing equities or public interest in precluding transgender service\n\nmembers from the military that outweigh those harms. Defendants argue that “[t]he public has a\n\nstrong interest in national defense.” Defs.’ Mem. at 41. They also argue that the military “is in\n\nthe process of gathering a panel of experts” to provide advice and recommendations regarding\n\n“the development and implementation of the policy on military service by transgender\n\nindividuals,” and that “[g]ranting Plaintiffs their requested relief would directly interfere with the\n\n\n\n\n                                                  74\n\fpanel’s work and the military’s ability to thoroughly study a complex and important issue\n\nregarding the composition of the armed forces.” Id. at 40–41.\n\n       Neither point passes muster. A bare invocation of “national defense” simply cannot\n\ndefeat every motion for preliminary injunction that touches on the military. On the record before\n\nthe Court, there is absolutely no support for the claim that the ongoing service of transgender\n\npeople would have any negative effective on the military at all. In fact, there is considerable\n\nevidence that it is the discharge and banning of such individuals that would have such effects.\n\nThe Court also notes that fifteen States have filed an amici brief indicating that they and their\n\nresidents will be harmed by the Presidential Memorandum if it is not enjoined. See State Amici\n\nBrief at 13-22. Moreover, the injunction that will be issued will in no way prevent the\n\ngovernment from conducting studies or gathering advice or recommendations on transgender\n\nservice.

CONCLUSION\n\n       For the reasons set out above, the Court will GRANT-IN-PART and DENY-IN-PART\n\nDefendants’ Motion to Dismiss and GRANT-IN-PART and DENY-IN-PART Plaintiffs’ Motion\n\nfor Preliminary Injunction. The Court will grant Defendants’ motion to dismiss Plaintiffs’\n\nclaims to the extent they are based on the Sex Reassignment Surgery Directive, as well as\n\nPlaintiffs’ estoppel claim. Defendants’ motion to dismiss is DENIED in all other respects.\n\nPlaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction is DENIED with respect to the Sex Reassignment\n\nSurgery Directive. Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction is GRANTED, however, in that\n\nthe Court will preliminarily enjoin enforcement of the Accession and Retention Directives.

Civil Action No. 17-1597 (CKK)\n DONALD J. TRUMP, et al.,\n     Defendants\n\n\n                                 MEMORANDUM OPINION\n                                    (October 30, 2017)\n\n       On July 26, 2017, President Donald J. Trump issued a statement via Twitter announcing\n\nthat “the United States Government will not accept or allow transgender individuals to serve in\n\nany capacity in the U.S. Military.” A formal Presidential Memorandum followed on August 25,\n\n2017. Before the Presidential Memorandum, the Department of Defense had announced that\n\nopenly transgender individuals would be allowed to enlist in the military, effective January 1,\n\n2018, and had prohibited the discharge of service members based solely on their gender\n\nidentities. The Presidential Memorandum reversed these policies. First, the Memorandum\n\nindefinitely extends a prohibition against transgender individuals entering the military, a process\n\nformally referred to as “accession” (the “Accession Directive”). Second, the Memorandum\n\nrequires the military to authorize, by no later than March 23, 2018, the discharge of transgender\n\nservice members (the “Retention Directive”).\n\n       The Department of Defense is required to submit a plan implementing the directives of\n\nthe Presidential Memorandum by February 21, 2018. On September 14, 2017, Secretary of\n\nDefense James Mattis promulgated Interim Guidance establishing Department of Defense policy\n\ntoward transgender service members until the directives of the Presidential Memorandum take\n\neffect. Pursuant to the Presidential Memorandum and the Interim Guidance, the protections\n\nafforded to transgender service members against discharge lapse early next year.\n                                                 1\n\f       Plaintiffs are current and aspiring service members who are transgender. Many have\n\nyears of experience in the military. Some have decades. They have been deployed on active\n\nduty in Iraq and Afghanistan. They have and continue to serve with distinction. All fear that the\n\ndirectives of the Presidential Memorandum will have devastating impacts on their careers and\n\ntheir families. They have moved the Court to enjoin the directives of the Presidential\n\nMemorandum, believing that these directives violate the fundamental guarantees of due process\n\nafforded by the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Defendants have moved to\n\ndismiss this case, principally on the basis that the Court lacks jurisdiction. Although highly\n\ntechnical, these jurisdictional arguments reduce to a few simple points: the Presidential\n\nMemorandum has not effected a definitive change in military policy; rather, that policy is still\n\nsubject to review; until that review is complete, transgender service members are protected; and\n\nany prospective injuries are too speculative to require judicial intervention.\n\n       These arguments, while perhaps compelling in the abstract, wither away under scrutiny.\n\nThe Memorandum unequivocally directs the military to prohibit indefinitely the accession of\n\ntransgender individuals and to authorize their discharge. This decision has already been made.\n\nThese directives must be executed by a date certain, and there is no reason to believe that they\n\nwill not be executed. Plaintiffs have established that they will be injured by these directives, due\n\nboth to the inherent inequality they impose, and the risk of discharge and denial of accession that\n\nthey engender. Further delay would only serve to harm the Plaintiffs. Given these\n\ncircumstances, the Court is in a positon to preliminarily adjudicate the propriety of these\n\ndirectives, and it does so here.\n\n       The Court holds that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their Fifth Amendment claim. As\n\na form of government action that classifies people based on their gender identity, and disfavors a\n\n\n\n                                                  2\n\fclass of historically persecuted and politically powerless individuals, the President’s directives\n\nare subject to a fairly searching form of scrutiny. Plaintiffs claim that the President’s directives\n\ncannot survive such scrutiny because they are not genuinely based on legitimate concerns\n\nregarding military effectiveness or budget constraints, but are instead driven by a desire to\n\nexpress disapproval of transgender people generally. The Court finds that a number of factors—\n\nincluding the sheer breadth of the exclusion ordered by the directives, the unusual circumstances\n\nsurrounding the President’s announcement of them, the fact that the reasons given for them do\n\nnot appear to be supported by any facts, and the recent rejection of those reasons by the military\n\nitself—strongly suggest that Plaintiffs’ Fifth Amendment claim is meritorious.\n\n       Accordingly, following an exhaustive review of the record, the pleadings, 1 and the\n\nrelevant authorities, the Court GRANTS-IN-PART and DENIES-IN-PART Plaintiffs’ Motion\n\n\n\n       1\n          The Court’s consideration has focused on the following documents: Pls.’ App. for\nPreliminary Injunction, ECF No. 13 (“Pls.’ Mem.”); Defs.’ Mot. to Dismiss and Opp’n to Pls.’\nApp. for Preliminary Injunction, ECF No. 45 (“Defs.’ Mem.”); Pls.’ Opp’n to Defs.’ Mot. to\nDismiss and Reply in Support of App. for Preliminary Injunction, ECF No. 55 (“Pls.’ Reply”);\nand Defs.’ Reply in Support of Mot. to Dismiss, ECF No. 57 (“Defs.’ Reply”).

Defendants shall be preliminarily enjoined from enforcing the\n\nAccession and Retention Directives, corresponding with sections 1(b) and 2(a) of the\n\nPresidential Memorandum, until further order of the Court or until this case is resolved. The\n\neffect of the Court’s Order is to revert to the status quo with regard to accession and retention\n\nthat existed before the issuance of the Presidential Memorandum—that is, the retention and\n\naccession policies established in a June 30, 2016 Directive-type Memorandum and later modified\n\nby Secretary of Defense James Mattis on June 30, 2017.\n\n       The Court also GRANTS-IN-PART and DENIES-IN-PART Defendants’ Motion to\n\nDismiss. The Court has jurisdiction over and reaches the merits of Plaintiffs’ Fifth Amendment\n\nclaim as it pertains to the Accession and Retention Directives. Plaintiffs have also challenged\n\nthe Presidential Memorandum’s prohibition against the expenditure of military resources on sex\n\nreassignment surgeries. Because no Plaintiff has established a likelihood of being impacted by\n\nthat prohibition, the Court lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate the propriety of this directive. Finally,\n\nPlaintiffs have also claimed relief under a theory of estoppel. At this time, that claim will be\n\ndismissed without prejudice because the Amended Complaint lacks allegations of the sort of\n\nparticularized representations, reliance, or government misconduct that could justify estoppel\n\nagainst the government. Plaintiffs may file a further amended complaint with respect to\n\nestoppel.\n\n\n\n\n       In an exercise of its discretion, the Court finds that holding oral argument in this action\nwould not be of assistance in rendering a decision. See LCvR 7(f).\n\n\n                                                  4\n\f                                        I. BACKGROUND\n\n A. The Military’s Policy Toward Transgender Service\n\n        1. Military Policy Prior to 2014\n\n       Accession\n\n       Prior to 2014, Department of Defense Instruction (“DODI”) 6130.03 “contain[ed] a list of\n\ndisqualifying physical and mental conditions that preclude[d] applicants from joining the\n\nmilitary . . . .” Lamb Decl., Ex. B (Palm Center Report of the Transgender Service\n\nCommission), at 7. Disqualifying conditions included “defects of the genitalia including but not\n\nlimited to change of sex,” and “[c]urrent or history of psychosexual conditions, including but not\n\nlimited to transsexualism, . . . transvestism, . . . and other paraphilias.” Id.; see also Defs.’ Mem.\n\nat 4 (“For decades, [disqualifying] conditions [under DODI 6130.03] have included\n\n‘transsexualism.’”).\n\n       DODI 6130.03 also requires that the “Secretaries of the Military Departments and\n\nCommandant of the Coast Guard shall . . . [a]uthorize the waiver of the standards in individual\n\ncases for applicable reasons and ensure uniform waiver determinations.” Lamb Decl., Ex. B, at\n\n7. Service-specific implementing rules set forth the waiver process for each branch of the\n\nmilitary. For example, under the applicable Army regulations, “[e]xaminees initially reported as\n\nmedically unacceptable by reason of medical unfitness . . . may request a waiver of the medical\n\nfitness standards in accordance with the basic administrative directive governing the personnel\n\naction.” Army Reg. 40-501 (Standards of Medical Fitness), ¶ 1-6(b); see also Lamb Decl., Ex.\n\nB, at 7. Although Defendants contend that transgender-related conditions were and remain\n\nsubject to waiver, see Defs.’ Mem. at 4, evidence in the record suggests otherwise. At least\n\nunder the pertinent regulations as they existed prior to 2014, “because some conditions related to\n\n\n\n                                                  5\n\ftransgender identity [were] grounds for discharge, and because recruiters [could not] waive a\n\ncondition upon enlistment that would be disqualifying for retention, transgender individuals\n\n[could not] obtain medical waivers for entrance into the military.” Lamb Decl., Ex. B, at 8. A\n\nMarch 2014 report was unable to find “any instances in which transgender-related conditions\n\nhave been waived for accession[,]” id., and Defendants have adduced no evidence of waivers\n\never being granted for this purpose.\n\n       Retention\n\n       Pertinent regulations prior to 2014 also appear to have provided military commanders\n\nwith discretion to separate enlisted personnel for transgender-related conditions. In particular,\n\nDODI 1332.14, which “controls administrative separations for enlisted persons,” provided that a\n\n“service member may be separated for the convenience of the government and at the discretion\n\nof a commander for ‘other designated physical or mental conditions,’ a category defined to\n\ninclude ‘sexual gender and identity disorders.’” Lamb Decl., Ex. B, at 8. Furthermore, DODI\n\n1332.38, “which contains rules for retiring or separating service members because of physical\n\ndisability” provided that “service members with conditions ‘not constituting a physical\n\ndisability’ . . . can be separated administratively from military service at a commander’s\n\ndiscretion, without the opportunity to demonstrate medical fitness for duty or eligibility for\n\ndisability compensation.” Id. This category of conditions, under prior iterations of the\n\ninstruction, included “Sexual Gender and Identity Disorders, including Sexual Dysfunctions and\n\nParaphilias.” Id.\n\n        2. August 2014 Regulation and July 28, 2015 Memorandum\n\n       At least with respect to retention, changes to this regulatory scheme were first enacted in\n\nAugust 2014, when “the Department of Defense issued a new regulation, DODI 1332.18,\n\n\n\n                                                 6\n\fDisability Evaluation System (DES).” Fanning Decl. ¶ 12. According to Former Secretary of the\n\nArmy Eric K. Fanning and Former Secretary of the Air Force Deborah Lee James, the new\n\nregulation\n\n               eliminated a DoD-wide list of conditions that would disqualify\n               persons from retention in military service, including the categorical\n               ban on open service by transgender persons. This new regulation\n               instructed each branch of the Armed Forces to reassess whether\n               disqualification based on these conditions, including the ban on\n               service by transgender persons, was justified. As of August 2014,\n               there was no longer a DoD-wide position on whether transgender\n               persons should be disqualified for retention.\n\nId. (emphasis added); James Decl. ¶ 8.\n\n       Subsequently, on July 28, 2015, then-Secretary of Defense Ash Carter issued a\n\nmemorandum to the secretaries of the military departments directing that “[e]ffective as of July\n\n13, 2015, no Service member shall be involuntarily separated or denied reenlistment or\n\ncontinuation of active or reserve service on the basis of their gender identity, without the\n\npersonal approval of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness.” Carson\n\nDecl., Ex. A. The memorandum further ordered the Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel\n\nand Readiness to “chair a working group composed of senior representatives from each of the\n\nMilitary Departments, Joint Staff, and relevant components from the Office of the Secretary of\n\nDefense to formulate policy options for the DoD regarding the military service of transgender\n\nService members.” Id.\n\n        3. The Working Group and the RAND Report\n\n       The working group convened by the Undersecretary (“the Working Group”) consisted of\n\nsenior uniformed officers and senior civilian officers from each department of the military.\n\nCarson Decl. ¶ 9. The Working Group sought to identify any possible issues related to open\n\nmilitary service of transgender individuals. Id. ¶ 22. It considered a broad range of information\n\n                                                 7\n\fprovided by senior military personnel, various types of experts, health insurance companies,\n\ncivilian employers, transgender service members themselves, and representatives from the\n\nmilitaries of other nations who allow open service by transgender people. Id. ¶ 10. Finally, the\n\nWorking Group commissioned the RAND Corporation’s National Defense Research Institute to\n\nconduct a study on the impact of permitting transgender service members to serve openly. Id. ¶\n\n11. RAND is a nonprofit research institution that provides research and analysis to the Armed\n\nServices. Id.\n\n       The RAND Corporation subsequently issued a 91-page report entitled “Assessing the\n\nImplications of Allowing Transgender Personnel to Serve Openly.” Carson Decl., Ex. B\n\n(“RAND Report”). The RAND Report found no evidence that allowing transgender individuals\n\nto serve would have any effect on “unit cohesion,” and concluded that any related costs or\n\nimpacts on readiness would be “exceedingly small,” “marginal” or “negligible.” Id. at xi–xii,\n\n39–47, 69–70. The RAND Report also found that “[i]n no case” where foreign militaries have\n\nallowed transgender individuals to serve “was there any evidence of an effect on the operational\n\neffectiveness, operational readiness, or cohesion of the force.” Id. at xiii.\n\n       Based on all of the information it collected, the Working Group unanimously concluded\n\nthat transgender people should be allowed to serve openly in the military. Not only did the group\n\nconclude that allowing transgender people to serve would not significantly affect military\n\nreadiness or costs, it found that prohibiting transgender people from serving undermines military\n\neffectiveness and readiness because it excludes qualified individuals on a basis that has no\n\n\n\n\n                                                  8\n\frelevance to one’s fitness to serve, and creates unexpected vacancies requiring expensive and\n\ntime-consuming recruitment and training of replacements. 2\n\n       The Working Group communicated its conclusion to the Secretary of Defense, along with\n\ndetailed recommendations for policies and procedures for open transgender service.\n\n           4. June 30, 2016 Directive-Type Memorandum 16-005\n\n       On June 30, 2016, the Secretary of Defense Ash Carter issued a Directive-type\n\nMemorandum (“DTM”) establishing a policy, assigning responsibilities, and prescribing\n\nprocedures for “the retention, accession, separation, in-service transition and medical coverage\n\nfor transgender personnel serving in the Military Services.” James Decl., Ex. B, at 1. The DTM\n\ntook effect immediately. Id. In the DTM, the Secretary of Defense stated his conclusion that\n\nopen service by transgender Americans was “consistent with military readiness and with strength\n\n\n\n\n       2\n          See generally Carson Decl. ¶¶ 26–27 (“The Working Group . . . concluded that banning\nservice by openly transgender persons would harm the military” and “unanimously resolved that\ntransgender personnel should be permitted to serve openly in the military.”); James Decl. ¶ 22\n(“The Working Group did not find that permitting transgender soldiers to serve would impose\nany significant costs or have a negative impact on military effectiveness or readiness,” but did\nfind “that barring transgender people from military service causes significant harms to the\nmilitary, including arbitrarily excluding potential qualified recruits based on a characteristic with\nno relevance to their ability to serve.”); Fanning Decl. ¶¶ 25–26 (“At the conclusion of its\ndiscussion and analysis, the members of the Working Group did not identify any basis for a\nblanket prohibition on open military service of transgender people. Likewise, no one suggested\nto me that a bar on military service by transgender persons was necessary for any reason,\nincluding readiness or unit cohesion. The Working Group communicated its conclusions to the\nSecretary of Defense, including that permitting transgender people to serve openly in the United\nStates military would not pose any significant costs or risks to readiness, unit cohesion, morale,\nor good order and discipline.”); Mabus Decl. ¶ 21 (stating that “all members of the Working\nGroup . . . expressed their agreement that transgender people should be permitted to serve openly\nin the United States Armed Forces” and that “President Trump’s stated rationales for reversing\nthe policy and banning military service by transgender people make no sense,” “have no basis in\nfact and are refuted by the comprehensive analysis of relevant data and information that was\ncarefully, thoroughly, and deliberately conducted by the Working Group”); Wilmoth Decl. ¶ 23\n(“The Working Group concluded that there were no barriers that should prevent transgender\nservice members from serving openly in the military.”).\n                                                 9\n\fthrough diversity.” Id. at 2. Accordingly, the DTM stated that it was the policy of the\n\nDepartment of Defense that “service in the United States military should be open to all who can\n\nmeet the rigorous standards for military service and readiness” and that, “consistent with the\n\npolicies and procedures set forth in [the DTM], transgender individuals shall be allowed to serve\n\nin the military.” Id.\n\n       Retention\n\n       The DTM set forth procedures for the retention and accession of transgender military\n\nservice members. It stated that “[e]ffective immediately, no otherwise qualified Service member\n\nmay be involuntarily separated, discharged or denied reenlistment or continuation of service,\n\nsolely on the basis of their gender identity,” or on their “expressed intent to transition genders.”\n\nJames Decl., Ex. B, Attach. (Procedures), at 1. The DTM stated that “Transgender Service\n\nmembers will be subject to the same standards as any other Service member of the same gender;\n\nthey may be separated, discharged, or denied reenlistment or continuation of service under\n\nexisting processes and basis, but not due solely to their gender identity or an expressed intent to\n\ntransition genders.” Id.\n\n       Accession\n\n       With respect to accession procedures, the DTM stated that by no later than July 1, 2017,\n\nDODI 6130.03 would be updated to allow for the accession of (i) individuals with gender\n\ndysphoria, (ii) individuals that have received medical treatment for gender transition, and (iii)\n\nindividuals that have undergone sex reassignment surgeries. Id. at 1–2. The policies and\n\nprocedures generally provided that these conditions would be disqualifying unless the acceding\n\nservice member was medically stable in their chosen gender for at least 18 months. Id. The\n\nDTM also provided that, effective October 1, 2016, the Department of Defense would\n\n\n\n                                                 10\n\f“implement a construct by which transgender Service members may transition gender while\n\nserving.” Id. at 2.\n\n       Equal Opportunity\n\n       Finally, the DTM stated that it is “the Department’s position, consistent with the U.S.\n\nAttorney General’s opinion, that discrimination based on gender identity is a form of sex\n\ndiscrimination.” Id. at 2.\n\n        5. June 30, 2016 Remarks by Secretary of Defense Ash Carter\n\n       On June 30, 2016, then-Secretary of Defense Ash Carter announced from the Pentagon\n\nbriefing room that “we are ending the ban on transgender Americans in the United States\n\nmilitary.” Lamb Decl., Ex. F. He stated that “[e]ffective immediately, transgender Americans\n\nmay serve openly, and they can no longer be discharged or otherwise separated from the military\n\njust for being transgender.” Id. Secretary Carter also announced that he had “directed that the\n\ngender identity of an otherwise qualified individual will not bar them from military service, or\n\nfrom any accession program.” Id. The Secretary stated that on June 30, 2017, after a year-long\n\nimplementation period, “the military services will begin acceding transgender individuals who\n\nmeet all standards—holding them to the same physical and mental fitness standards as everyone\n\nelse who wants to join the military.” Id.\n\n       Secretary Carter gave three reasons for the Department’s decision. First, he stated that\n\n“the Defense Department and the military need to avail ourselves of all talent possible in order to\n\nremain what we are now—the finest fighting force the world has ever known.” Id. He added\n\nthat “[w]e invest hundreds of thousands of dollars to train and develop each individual, and we\n\nwant to take the opportunity to retain people whose talent we’ve invested in and who have\n\nproven themselves.” Id. Second, he stated that “the reality is that we have transgender service\n\n\n\n                                                11\n\fmembers serving in uniform today,” and they and their commanders need “clearer and more\n\nconsistent guidance than is provided by current policies.” Id. And third, he stated that, as a\n\nmatter of principle, “Americans who want to serve and can meet our standards should be\n\nafforded the opportunity to come to do so.” Id.\n\n        6. September 30, 2016 Publication of “Transgender Service in the U.S. Military:\n           An Implementation Handbook” and Military Department Policies\n\n       Consistent with the directives of Secretary Carter in his July 2015 memorandum and June\n\n2016 memorandum and policy announcement, Acting Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel\n\nand Readiness Peter Levine published an “implementation handbook” entitled “Transgender\n\nService in the U.S. Military.” Mabus Decl., Ex. F; see also James Decl., Ex. D. The document\n\nwas “the product of broad collaboration among the Services” and was intended to serve as a\n\n“practical day-to-day guide” to assist Service members and commanders to understand and\n\nimplement the policy of open transgender military service. James Decl., ¶ 34. The handbook is\n\na lengthy, exhaustive document, providing an explanation of the basics of what it means to be\n\ntransgender and to undergo gender transition; guidance on how transgender service members can\n\nrequest an in-service transition and communicate with their leadership about their transition\n\nprocess; and guidance for commanders interacting with transgender service members. It also\n\nincludes extensive question-and-answer and hypothetical scenario sections, as well as a\n\n“roadmap” for gender transition for military personnel.\n\n       Individual implementing memoranda were subsequently issued by the branches of the\n\nArmed Forces. On November 4, 2016, the Secretary of the Navy issued SECNAV Instruction\n\n1000.11, the stated purpose of which was to “establish Department of Navy . . . policy for the\n\naccession and service of transgender Sailors and Marines, to include the process for transgender\n\nService Members to transition gender in-service.” Mabus Decl., Ex. D, at 1. The memorandum\n\n                                                  12\n\fstated that “transgender individual shall be allowed to serve openly in the [Department of the\n\nNavy].” Id. at 2.\n\n        The Air Force issued a Policy Memorandum on October 6, 2016, which stated that “[i]t is\n\nAir Force policy that service in the United States Air Force should be open to all who can meet\n\nthe rigorous standards for military service and readiness. Consistent with the policies set forth in\n\nthis memorandum, transgender individuals shall be allowed to serve in the Air Force.” James\n\nDecl., Ex. C.\n\n        The Army issued Directive 2016-30 (Army Policy on Military Service of Transgender\n\nSoldiers) on July 1, 2016. Fanning Decl., Ex. D. The Directive stated that\n\n                 it is Army policy to allow open service by transgender Soldiers. The\n                 Army is open to all who can meet the standards for military service\n                 and remains committed to treating all Soldiers with dignity and\n                 respect while ensuring good order and discipline. Transgender\n                 Soldiers will be subject to the same standards as any other Soldier\n                 of the same gender. An otherwise qualified Soldier shall not be\n                 involuntarily separated, discharged, or denied reenlistment or\n                 continuation of service solely on the basis of gender identity.\nId. at 1.\n\n        Army Directive 2016-35 was promulgated on October 7, 2016. Fanning Decl., Ex. E. It\n\nstated that “The Army allows transgender Soldiers to serve openly.” Id. at 1.\n\n            7. June 30, 2017 Press Release by Secretary James Mattis\n\n        On June 30, 2017, Secretary of Defense James Mattis deferred acceding transgender\n\napplicants into the military until January 1, 2018, stating that the “services will review their\n\naccession plans and provide input on the impact to the readiness and lethality of our forces.”\n\nLamb Decl., Ex.

August 25, 2017 Presidential Memorandum\n\n       On August 25, 2017, President Trump issued a memorandum entitled “Presidential\n\nMemorandum for the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security.” Lamb\n\nDecl., Ex. A (the “Presidential Memorandum”). The memorandum begins by stating that until\n\n“June 2016, the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)\n\n(collectively, the Departments) generally prohibited openly transgender individuals from\n\naccession into the United States military and authorized the discharge of such individuals.”\n\nPresidential Memorandum § 1(a). According to the memorandum, “[s]hortly before President\n\nObama left office, . . . his Administration dismantled the Departments’ established framework by\n\npermitting transgender individuals to serve openly in the military, authorizing the use of the\n\nDepartments’ resources to fund sex-reassignment surgical procedures, and permitting accession\n\nof such individuals after July 1, 2017.” Id. The President stated that “the previous\n\nAdministration failed to identify a sufficient basis to conclude that terminating the Departments’\n\nlongstanding policy and practice would not hinder military effectiveness and lethality, disrupt\n\nunit cohesion, or tax military resources, and there remain meaningful concerns that further study\n\nis needed to ensure that continued implementation of last year’s policy change would not have\n\nthose negative effects.” Id.\n\n       The memorandum has two operative sections, one general, and the other more specific.\n\nSection 1(b) directs “the Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of Homeland Security with\n\nrespect to the U.S. Coast Guard, to return to the longstanding policy and practice on military\n\nservice by transgender individuals that was in place prior to June 2016 until such time as a\n\nsufficient basis exists upon which to conclude that terminating that policy and practice would not\n\nhave the negative effects discussed above.” Id. § 1(b). As already stated, the memorandum\n\n                                                15\n\fdefines the pre-June 2016 policy as one under which the military “generally prohibited openly\n\ntransgender individuals from accession into the United States military and authorized the\n\ndischarge of such individuals.” Id. § 1(a). The directive set forth in section 1(b) takes effect on\n\nMarch 23, 2018. Id. § 3. The memorandum provides that the “Secretary of Defense, after\n\nconsulting with the Secretary of Homeland Security, may advise [the President] at any time, in\n\nwriting, that a change to this policy is warranted.” Id. § 1(b).\n\n       Section 2 contains two specific directives to the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of\n\nHomeland Security. First, section 2(a) directs the Secretaries to “maintain the currently effective\n\npolicy regarding accession of transgender individuals into military service beyond January 1,\n\n2018, until such time as the Secretary of Defense, after consulting with the Secretary of\n\nHomeland Security, provides a recommendation to the contrary that [the President finds]\n\nconvincing . . . .” Id. § 2(a). This section takes effect on January 1, 2018. Id.\n\n       Second, section 2(b) directs the Secretaries to “halt all use of DoD or DHS resources to\n\nfund sex reassignment surgical procedures for military personnel, except to the extent necessary\n\nto protect the health of an individual who has already begun a course of treatment to reassign his\n\nor her sex.” Id. § 2(b). This section, like section 1(b), takes effect on March 23, 2018. Id § 3.\n\n       By February 21, 2018, the Secretaries must submit a plan to the President “for\n\nimplementing both the general policy set forth in section 1(b) of this memorandum and the\n\nspecific directives set forth in section 2 of this memorandum.” Id. § 3. This implementation\n\nplan must “determine how to address transgender individuals currently serving in the United\n\nStates military.” Id. Until that determination is made—and it must be made as part of the\n\nimplementation plan, which must be submitted by February 21, 2018—“no action may be taken\n\nagainst such individuals under the policy set forth in section 1(b) of this memorandum.” Id.\n\n\n\n                                                 16\n\fThat is, only after February 21, 2018, may the Secretaries take actions toward reverting to the\n\npre-June 2016 policy, which by the terms of the memorandum is a policy under which the\n\nmilitary “generally prohibited openly transgender individuals from accession into the United\n\nStates military and authorized the discharge of such individuals.” Id. § 1(a).\n\n        Retention Directive\n\n        In sum, by March 23, 2018, the Secretaries are required by the plain text of the\n\nPresident’s directive to revert to a policy under which the military “authorized the discharge of\n\n[transgender] individuals.” Id. §§ 1(a), 1(b), 3. The protections of the memorandum with\n\nrespect to discharge and other adverse action expire on February 21, 2018. Id. § 3.\n\n        Accession Directive\n\n        With respect to accession, the memorandum indefinitely delays the implementation of the\n\naccession policy of the June 2016 DTM, which was previously set for implementation on\n\nJanuary 1, 2018, and by March 23, 2018, requires the Secretaries to revert to a policy by which\n\nthe military “generally prohibit[s] openly transgender individuals from accession . . . .” Id. §§\n\n1(a), 1(b), 2(a), 3.\n\n         10. August 29, 2017 Statement by Secretary Mattis\n\n        On August 29, 2017, Secretary Mattis issued a statement concerning the Presidential\n\nMemorandum. Lamb Decl., Ex. D. He wrote that “[t]he [Department of Defense] will carry out\n\nthe president’s policy direction, in consultation with the Department of Homeland Security,” and\n\nthat “[a]s directed,” the Department of Defense will “develop a study and implementation plan,\n\nwhich will contain the steps that will promote military readiness, lethality, and unit cohesion,\n\nwith due regard to budgetary constraints and consistent with applicable law.” Id. The plan,\n\nSecretary Mattis wrote, “will address accessions of transgender individuals and transgender\n\n\n\n                                                17\n\findividuals currently serving in the United States military.” Id. Secretary Mattis stated that he\n\nwould “establish a panel of experts serving within the Departments of Defense and Homeland\n\nSecurity to provide advice and recommendations on the implementation of the president’s\n\ndirection.” Id. After the “panel reports its recommendations and following . . . consultation with\n\nthe secretary of Homeland Security,” Secretary Mattis “will provide [his] advice to the president\n\nconcerning implementation of his policy direction.” Id. In the interim, “current policy with\n\nrespect to currently serving members will remain in place.” Id.\n\n         11. September 14, 2017 Interim Guidance\n\n        On September 14, 2017, Secretary Mattis issued interim guidance that took “effect\n\nimmediately and will remain in effect until [he] promulgate[s] DoD’s final policy in this matter.”\n\nDefs.’ Mem., ECF No. 45, Ex. 1 (“Interim Guidance”). The Interim Guidance states that “[n]ot\n\nlater than February 21, 2018, [Secretary Mattis] will present the President with a plan to\n\nimplement the policy and directives in the Presidential Memorandum.” Id. at 1. The\n\n“implementation plan will establish the policy, standards and procedures for transgender\n\nindividuals serving in the military.” Id.\n\n        Accession\n\n        With respect to accession, the Interim Guidance provides that the procedures previously\n\nset forth in a 2010 policy instruction, “which generally prohibit the accession of transgender\n\nindividuals into the Military Services, remain in effect . . . .” Id. at 2.\n\n        Medical Care and Treatment\n\n        With respect to medical care and treatment, the Interim Guidance provides that “[s]ervice\n\nmembers who receive a gender dysphoria diagnosis from a military medical provider will be\n\nprovided treatment for the diagnosed medical condition,” but that “no new sex reassignment\n\n\n\n                                                   18\n\fsurgical procedures for military personnel will be permitted after March 22, 2018, except to the\n\nextent necessary to protect the health of an individual who has already begun a course of\n\ntreatment to reassign his or her sex.” Id.\n\n       Retention\n\n       With respect to the separation or retention of transgender service members, the Interim\n\nGuidance provides that “[a]n otherwise qualified transgender Service member whose term of\n\nservice expires while this Interim Guidance remains in effect, may, at the Service member’s\n\nrequest, be re-enlisted in service under existing procedures.” Id. (emphasis in original).\n\n       Finally, the Interim Guidance states that “[a]s directed by the [Presidential]\n\nMemorandum, no action may be taken to involuntarily separate or discharge an otherwise\n\nqualified Service member solely on the basis of a gender dysphoria diagnosis or transgender\n\nstatus.” Id.\n\n B. The Plaintiffs\n\n       1. Jane Doe 1\n\n       Plaintiff Jane Doe 1 has served in the Coast Guard since 2003. Looney Decl., Ex. A\n\n(“Redacted Jane Doe 1 Decl.”), ¶ 1. Jane Doe 1 is transgender. The Coast Guard has made a\n\nsubstantial investment in educating and training Jane Doe 1, and she has done her “best to be\n\nhardworking, faithful, and loyal to the Coast Guard.” Id. ¶ 11. She is married and is the primary\n\nwage earner for her family. She and her spouse receive health insurance coverage, called\n\nTRICARE, based on her enlisted status. Id. ¶ 12. When she came to the realization of her\n\ntransgender identity, Jane Doe 1, with her spouse’s support, sought professional help. Id. ¶ 14.\n\nShe paid for this help herself, fearing that she may be separated from the Coast Guard if she went\n\nthrough military health channels. Id. She was diagnosed with gender dysphoria and has\n\n\n\n                                                19\n\freceived medical treatment for this condition. Id. ¶ 15. However, because TRICARE does not\n\nprovide comprehensive gender transition healthcare, following the issuance of the June 2016\n\nDTM, she was required to obtain waivers from the Defense Health Agency to obtain treatment.\n\nBecause this process often led to delays, Jane Doe 1 has continued to pay for her care herself,\n\nincluding surgical care. Id. ¶ 21.\n\n       Following the President’s statement regarding transgender service members, issued via\n\nTwitter, Commandant of the Coast Guard Paul F. Zukunft stated, with respect to transgender\n\nservice members, that “[w]e have made an investment in you and you have made an investment\n\nin the Coast Guard and I will not break faith.” Id. ¶ 23.\n\n       According to Jane Doe 1, the Presidential Memorandum has disrupted her medical care,\n\nand has had “serious consequences for [her] financial future.” Id. ¶¶ 29–30. For one, separation\n\nfrom the Coast Guard would mean loss of substantial pension benefits, and health insurance for\n\nher and her family. Id. ¶¶ 30–31. Separation also means the loss of “a central part of [her]\n\nidentity.” Id. ¶ 36. In her own words: “As much as the Coast Guard has invested in me, I have\n\ninvested in the Coast Guard. I love serving, . . . I had expected to continue serving as a Coast\n\nGuard officer for many years.” Id.\n\n       2. Jane Doe 2\n\n       Jane Doe 2 joined the Army National Guard in 2003, when she was 17. Looney Decl.,\n\nEx. B (“Redacted Jane Doe 2 Decl.”), ¶ 3. She met her wife while serving, who soon became\n\npregnant. Jane Doe 2 then “made the decision to go on active duty with the U.S. Army so [she]\n\ncould obtain health care benefits to support [her] growing family.” Id. ¶ 5. She now has three\n\nchildren. Id. While on active duty, she served in South Korea and was deployed to Kandahar in\n\nAfghanistan. Id. ¶ 7.\n\n\n\n                                                20\n\f       During active duty, Jane Doe 2 came out to her wife as transgender. Id. ¶ 9. She felt\n\nmore connected to her wife and she stopped drinking. Id. After the Department of Defense\n\npromulgated new regulations in late 2015, she made a public post on Facebook stating that she\n\nwas transgender. Redacted Jane Doe 2 Decl. ¶ 10. Her company commander was very\n\nsupportive. Id. ¶ 11. She began to see an Army therapist, and following the June 2016 DTM,\n\nshe obtained a formal gender dysphoria diagnosis which permitted her to receive transition\n\ntreatment from military healthcare providers, and she began receiving hormone treatment. Id. ¶\n\n13.\n\n       Following the President’s statement and the Presidential Memorandum, Jane Doe 2\n\nbelieves that she has received an unfavorable work detail to keep her “separated from the rest of\n\n[her] unit because [she is] transgender and because of the President’s ban, as [she] never had any\n\nproblems with this kind of treatment in [her] old unit and [does] not know of any other reason\n\n[why] she would be treated this way.” Id. ¶ 15. She also fears the loss of retirement benefits,\n\nwhich accrue following 20 years of service, and access to “health care services for [her] family\n\non base.” Id. ¶ 16. She has already accrued 12 to 13 years of service toward these benefits. Id.\n\n¶¶ 16, 18. The directives of the Presidential Memorandum have “left [her] feeling excluded, and\n\nit hurts [her] that people like [her] are being singled out and told that [they] aren’t good enough\n\nto serve our country based on a characteristic that has no relevance at all to our abilities or fitness\n\nto serve.” Id. ¶ 19.\n\n       Jane Doe 2 “loves this country and [has] served it faithfully and well.” Id. For her, to\n\n“be told that [she is] no longer worthy to serve is a terrible blow. It affects how [she sees\n\nherself] . . . .” Id. “All [she wants] is to be allowed to serve [her] country and to be evaluated\n\nbased on [her] job performance rather than on [her] status as a transgender person.” Id. ¶ 20.\n\n\n\n                                                  21\n\f        3. Jane Doe 3\n\n        Jane Doe 3 serves in the Army. After completing her basic training, she was deployed to\n\nAfghanistan for six months. Looney Decl., Ex. C (“Redacted Jane Doe 3 Decl.”), ¶ 4. She is\n\ncurrently scheduled to deploy again to Iraq, where she will be going as a team leader, with\n\nsoldiers reporting to her. Id. ¶ 6.\n\n        Jane Doe 3 has received a gender dysphoria diagnosis from an Army therapist. Id. ¶ 7.\n\nAlthough she has developed a transition plan in coordination with medical professionals, she has\n\nnot begun any of the treatment steps, which include surgery. Id. ¶ 9.\n\n        Before the President’s statement regarding transgender individuals, Jane Doe 3 “had not\n\ncome out to anyone in [her] chain of command.” Id. ¶ 10. However, after the statement, she had\n\na conversation with her company commander, believing that she would receive support based on\n\nthe June 2016 DTM. Id. She told her company commander that she was worried that she would\n\nnot be deployed, and that she was committed to being deployed. Id.\n\n        The commander was not supportive—expressing shock and surprise—but she has\n\nreceived support from her squad leader, the platoon sergeant, and another friend in her unit. Id. ¶\n\n11. Since that conversation, she has continued to prepare for deployment, with the\n\nunderstanding that she will not be able to begin her treatment until she returns. Id. ¶ 12. In her\n\nwords, she “will not put [her] personal needs ahead of the needs of the mission and [her] fellow\n\nsoldiers.” Id.\n\n        Jane Doe 3 has “not told anyone else at [her] rank or below that [she] is transgender.” Id.\n\n¶ 15. As a result, she “was able to hear an unfiltered reaction to the President’s announcement\n\nright after he tweeted it.” Id. “Some made ugly remarks about transgender service members,\n\nwhile others remarked [that] people who kill transgender people should not be punished.” Id.\n\n\n\n                                                22\n\fAccording to Jane Doe 3, after “the tweets, people seemed emboldened to express hostility to\n\ntransgender people.” Id. ¶ 15.\n\n        4.   Jane Doe 4\n\n        Jane Doe 4 serves in the Army National Guard, but was previously on active duty with\n\nthe Army. After basic training, she served in South Korea, and subsequently served a tour in\n\nIraq after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Looney Decl., Ex. D (“Redacted Jane Doe 4 Decl.”), ¶¶ 5–6.\n\nAfter she returned from Iraq, Jane Doe 4 enlisted in the Army National Guard, and then joined\n\nthe Active Guard Reserve. Id. ¶ 7. In that capacity, she has been employed as a specialist by the\n\nDepartment of Defense. Id. ¶ 10.\n\n        Following the June 2016 DTM, Jane Doe 4 decided to come out as transgender to her\n\nchain of command. Id. ¶ 13. She first spoke to the senior non-commissioned officer of her unit,\n\nwho said she supported her decision “100%.” She then spoke with her commanding officer, a\n\nMajor, “who acknowledged that he was not very knowledgeable about the experiences of\n\ntransgender people, but told [her] that he and the rest of [her] unit would support and work with\n\n[her] through the process . . . .” Id. According to Jane Doe 4, the “change in policy allowing\n\ntransgender soldiers to serve openly . . . changed [her] life in the military.” Id. ¶ 14. Her “fellow\n\nsoldiers in [her] unit and [her] senior leaders . . . told [her] that they . . . noticed how much\n\nhappier [she was].” Id.\n\n        The President’s statement regarding transgender service members has been “devastating”\n\nto her, making her feel “ashamed” and “deeply saddened that he was ordering the Army, which\n\n[she] had been a part of for so long and which [she] loved so much, to stop treating [her] with\n\nrespect.” Id. ¶ 15. She “went to work each day wondering whether [she] would be discharged,\n\n\n\n\n                                                  23\n\fnot because of any problem with [her] job performance or [her] commitment to serve this\n\ncountry, but solely because of [her] gender identity.” Id.\n\n       Jane Doe 4 reenlisted effective August 24, 2017, and has extended her commitment to the\n\nArmy until February 2020. See Defs.’ Mem. at 11 (citing Sealed Decl. relating to Jane Doe 4,\n\nECF No. 56-4).\n\n        5. Jane Doe 5\n\n       “Jane Doe 5 has been an active duty member of the United States Air Force for nearly\n\ntwenty years, serving multiple tours of duty abroad, including two in Iraq.” Am. Compl., ECF\n\nNo. 9, ¶ 30. After June 2016, she notified her superiors that she is transgender. Id. ¶ 31. Her\n\n“livelihood depends on her military service[,]” and “[s]eparation from the military w[ould] have\n\ndevastating financial and emotional consequences for her.” Id. ¶ 32.\n\n       6. John Doe 1\n\n       John Doe 1 serves in the Army. His family has “a proud history of serving in the Armed\n\nForces.” Looney Decl., Ex. E (“Redacted John Doe 1 Decl.”), ¶ 3. His great grandfather served\n\nin Europe in World War II. Id. His father served in the Air Force and was awarded the Bronze\n\nStar for valor. His uncle was a United States Marine who was wounded and paralyzed by an\n\nimprovised explosive during Operation Desert Storm. His aunt served in the military as well.\n\nId. John Doe 1 has idolized military service since childhood. Id.\n\n       John Doe 1 entered college on a full academic scholarship. Id. ¶ 4. After graduating\n\nmagna cum laude, he entered the Army Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (“ROTC”) program\n\nwhile pursuing a master’s degree. Id. ¶ 5. His fellow cadets in the program knew that he was\n\ntransgender and were supportive, and his superiors were generally supportive as well. Id. ¶ 6.\n\nHe was ranked third in his ROTC class, and was allowed to wear a male dress uniform as part of\n\n\n\n                                                24\n\fhis duties for the ROTC Color Guard. Id. ¶ 6. While serving in the ROTC program, John Doe 1\n\nalso joined the National Guard. Id. ¶ 7. He met his future wife, with whom he has a two-year-\n\nold son. Id. ¶ 9. He graduated in the top 20% of his ROTC class. Id. ¶ 12.\n\n       Following the June 2016 DTM, John Doe 1 began training at the Basic Officer\n\nLeadership Course (“BOLC”), at which time he came out to his platoon instructors, who were\n\nvery supportive and treated him as male despite his official gender designation. Id. ¶¶ 14–15.\n\nAfter the BOLC, John Doe 1 was stationed as the executive officer for his unit, performing\n\nadministrative tasks on behalf of and reporting directly to his commanding officer.

Regan Kibby\n\n       Plaintiff Regan Kibby is a 19-year-old midshipman at the United States Naval Academy.\n\nKibby Decl. ¶ 1. Kibby’s father served in the Navy, and Kibby has wanted to follow in his\n\nfootsteps from an early age. Id. ¶¶ 2–3. He spent his summers in high school attending seminars\n\nat military academies. Id. ¶ 5. Despite being accepted with full scholarships to other schools,\n\nKibby immediately decided to enroll at the Naval Academy when he was accepted. Id. ¶¶ 7–8.\n\nHe has now successfully completed his first two years of school and hopes to become a Surface\n\nWarfare Officer in the Navy after graduation. Id. ¶ 9.\n\n       Kibby is transgender. Id. ¶ 1. After Secretary of Defense Carter announced that\n\ntransgender people could not be separated on the basis of their gender identity during his first\n\nyear at the Naval Academy, Kibby began to come out. Id. ¶¶ 13–14. Kibby’s Company Officer\n\nwas very accepting and supportive, and put Kibby in contact with the Brigade Medical Officer to\n\nbegin the process of preparing a medical treatment plan. Id. ¶¶ 16–19. The first step was to\n\nreceive an official diagnosis, which Kibby did. Id. ¶ 20.\n\n       Working with the Brigade Medical Officer, Kibby determined that in order to comply\n\nwith the 18 month stability requirement of the recently announced accession policy for\n\ntransgender service members, he would have to take a year off from the Naval Academy to\n\nensure that he had completed his transition plan prior to graduating and acceding. Id. ¶ 24. His\n\nCommandant and the Superintendent officially approved Kibby’s medical transition plan and his\n\n\n\n                                                26\n\frequest for a year-long medical leave of absence.

Id. ¶\n\n28.\n\n           When Plaintiff Kibby saw the President’s Tweet he “was devastated” and felt that “[t]he\n\nentire future [he] had been planning for [himself] was crumbling around [him].” Id. ¶ 31. When\n\nKibby came out, he was relying on the recent pronouncements by the Secretary of Defense and\n\nthe Navy that he would be able to enlist despite being transgender. Id. ¶ 33. He is now living in\n\na state of uncertainty and great distress because if the Presidential Memorandum is allowed to\n\nstand, he will never be able to serve in the Armed Forces—something he has strived for since he\n\nwas a child. Id. ¶¶ 33–34.\n\n           8. Dylan Kohere\n\n           Plaintiff Dylan Kohere is an 18-year-old student and member of the Army ROTC at the\n\nUniversity of New Haven. Kohere Decl. ¶ 1. Both of Dylan’s grandfathers served in the\n\nmilitary, and Dylan has wanted to serve since he was a young child. Id. ¶ 2. He entered the\n\nROTC program to obtain the career opportunities that come with being a commissioned officer.\n\nId. ¶ 2.\n\n           Dylan is transgender, and has come out as such to his Sergeant. Id. ¶ 9. He has started to\n\nwork with medical professionals to begin a treatment plan for his transition. Id. ¶ 10. When the\n\nPresident declared on Twitter that transgender service members would no longer be allowed to\n\nserve in the military in any capacity, Dylan felt that the plan he had made for his life had been\n\n“thrown out the window.” Id. ¶¶ 12–13. He had come out as transgender in the ROTC in\n\nreliance on the military’s announcement that transgender people could serve openly. Id. ¶¶ 11,\n\n15. He feels disheartened that if the Presidential Memorandum remains in force, he will “be\n\n\n\n                                                   27\n\fdenied an opportunity to serve based on something that has nothing to do with [his] ability or\n\nperformance.” Id. ¶ 15.

In any event, this Court need not resolve the viability of the\nsliding-scale approach today, as it finds that each of the preliminary injunctive factors favors\nawarding relief on the pending motion.\n                                                  30\n\f       Plaintiffs bear the burden of establishing jurisdiction, and each “element must be\n\nsupported in the same way as any other matter on which the plaintiff bears the burden of proof,\n\ni.e., with the manner and degree of evidence required at the successive stages of the litigation.”\n\nSusan B.

On a motion for preliminary injunction, the plaintiff “must show a substantial\n\nlikelihood of standing[,]” while on a motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil\n\nProcedure 12(b)(1), the plaintiff must merely “state a plausible claim that they have suffered an\n\ninjury in fact fairly traceable to the actions of the defendant that is likely to be redressed by a\n\nfavorable decision on the merits.” Food & Water Watch, Inc. v.

Although Defendants have\n\npressed their jurisdictional arguments in a motion to dismiss, the Court also has an independent\n\nduty to assess its jurisdiction for purposes of Plaintiffs’ pending motion for preliminary\n\ninjunction. Consequently, the Court proceeds by applying the higher burden necessitated by a\n\nmotion for preliminary injunction.\n\n       For the reasons stated below, the Court concludes that it has jurisdiction to adjudicate the\n\npropriety of the directives of the Presidential Memorandum with respect to the accession and\n\nretention of transgender individuals for military service, which corresponds with sections 1(b)\n\nand 2(a) of the Presidential Memorandum (i.e., the Accession and Retention Directives). The\n\nCourt does not have jurisdiction over section 2(b), which prohibits the use of military resources\n\nto fund sex reassignment surgical procedures, because no Plaintiff has demonstrated that they are\n\nsubstantially likely to be impacted by this directive (the “Sex Reassignment Surgery Directive”).\n\n       1. Standing\n\n       Standing is an element of the Court’s subject-matter jurisdiction, and requires, in essence,\n\n\n\n                                                  31\n\fthat a plaintiff have “a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy . . . .” Warth v.

For the\n\nreasons stated below, Plaintiffs have carried their burden of demonstrating a substantial\n\nlikelihood of standing on the basis of at least two distinct injuries. First, Plaintiffs are subject to\n\na competitive barrier that violates equal protection. Second, they are subject to a substantial risk\n\n\n\n                                                   32\n\fof being denied accession, or being discharged from the military, due to their transgender status.\n\nFurthermore, Plaintiffs have demonstrated satisfactorily that both of these injuries are caused by\n\nthe directives of the Presidential Memorandum, and that they are redressable by this Court.\n\n              a. The Import of the Presidential Memorandum\n\n       Before turning to the legal basis of the two injuries that support Plaintiffs’ standing, the\n\nCourt first addresses the crux of Defendants’ arguments regarding standing, and indeed, this\n\nCourt’s subject-matter jurisdiction more generally.\n\n       According to Defendants, the Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction with respect to the\n\ndirectives of the Presidential Memorandum because Plaintiffs have merely “brought a\n\nconstitutional challenge to the President’s policy directive to conduct further study before the\n\nmilitary changes its longstanding policies regarding service by transgender individuals.” Defs.’\n\nMem. at 15. According to Defendants, Plaintiffs “challenge a notional policy regarding military\n\nservice by transgender individuals, but as they concede, that policy is currently being studied and\n\nhas not been implemented or applied to anyone, let alone Plaintiffs.” Defs.’ Reply at 1.\n\nDefendants also highlight the protections afforded by the Interim Guidance: “Secretary of\n\nDefense Mattis has put in place Interim Guidance that, by its terms, maintains the status quo for\n\nboth current service members and those who seek to accede into the military.” Id. In\n\nDefendants’ view, the Court is being asked “to prejudge the constitutionality of a future\n\nGovernment policy regarding military service by transgender individuals and issue the\n\nextraordinary relief of a worldwide preliminary injunction.” Defs.’ Mem. at 1. They further\n\ncontend that “it is unclear whether those currently serving members will be affected by the future\n\npolicy regarding service by transgender individuals once it is finalized and implemented.” Id. at\n\n2.\n\n\n\n                                                 33\n\f       According to Defendants, the President has only “directed the Secretary of Defense to\n\ndetermine how to address transgender individuals currently serving in the military and that no\n\naction be taken against such individuals until after a policy review is completed.” Id. at 1\n\n(emphasis in original). In their words: “Secretary Mattis’s Memorandum is unambiguous: The\n\nInterim Guidance is the operative policy and will remain so until he promulgates DoD’s final\n\npolicy regarding service by transgender individuals.” Defs.’ Reply at 3. “The Interim Guidance\n\nis equally clear: Transgender service members, including the service member Plaintiffs, continue\n\nto serve fully in the military.” Id. With respect to accession, Defendants contend that the\n\noperative policy is not a “ban” because transgender individuals are “subject to the normal waiver\n\nprocess.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). In sum, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs\n\ndisregard the actual policy regarding transgender service members, and instead rely “on a\n\nhypothetical future policy on transgender military service.” Id.\n\n       Ultimately, all of these contentions can be summarized into a few overarching points: the\n\nPresidential Memorandum merely commissioned an additional policy review; that review is\n\nunderway; nothing is set in stone, and what policy may come about is unknown; and regardless,\n\nPlaintiffs are protected by the Interim Guidance. And while accession by transgender individuals\n\nis not permitted, they may obtain waivers. In the Court’s view, the government’s jurisdictional\n\narguments are a red herring.\n\n       The President controls the United States military. The directives of the Presidential\n\nMemorandum, to the extent they are definitive, are the operative policy toward military service\n\nby transgender service members. The Court must and shall assume that the directives of the\n\nPresidential Memorandum will be faithfully executed. See Nat’l Mining Ass’n v. U.S. Army\n\nCorps of Engineers, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"755131\"><a href=\"/opinion/755131/national-mining-association-v-us-army-corps-of-engineers/\"><span class=\"volume\">145</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1399</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1408 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (assessing “faithful” application of\n\n\n\n                                                34\n\fagency rule). Consequently, the Interim Guidance must be read as implementing the directives\n\nof the Presidential Memorandum, and any protections afforded by the Interim Guidance are\n\nnecessarily limited to the extent they conflict with the express directives of the memorandum.\n\nFinally, to the extent there is ambiguity about the meaning of the Presidential Memorandum, the\n\nbest guidance is the President’s own statements regarding his intentions with respect to service\n\nby transgender individuals. To recount: On July 26, 2017, the President issued a statement\n\nannouncing that the “United States government will not accept or allow transgender individuals\n\nto serve in any capacity in the U.S. military.” On August 25, 2017, the President issued the\n\nPresidential Memorandum. There, the President states that until “June 2016, the [military]\n\ngenerally prohibited openly transgender individuals from accession into the United States\n\nmilitary and authorized the discharge of such individuals.” Finding subsequent changes to that\n\npolicy unjustified, in section 1(b), the President directs the military “to return to the longstanding\n\npolicy and practice on military service by transgender individuals that was in place prior to June\n\n2016 . . . .” Accordingly, the military has been directed by section 1(b) to return to a policy\n\nunder which: (i) transgender individuals are generally prohibited from accession; and (ii) the\n\nmilitary is authorized to discharge individuals who are transgender.\n\n       This change in policy must occur by March 23, 2018, except that the prohibition on\n\naccession is extended indefinitely as of January 1, 2018. Likewise, as of March 23, 2018, the\n\nmilitary is expressly prohibited from funding sex reassignment surgeries, except as necessary to\n\nprotect the health of an already transitioning individual. The Memorandum provides that “[a]s\n\npart of the implementation plan, the Secretary of Defense . . . shall determine how to address\n\ntransgender individuals currently serving in the United States military.” “Until the Secretary has\n\nmade that determination, no action may be taken against such individuals under the policy set\n\n\n\n                                                 35\n\fforth in section 1(b)”—that is, the directive that requires a return to the policy under which\n\ntransgender individuals could not accede, and could be discharged. As these two clauses make\n\nclear, transgender individuals are immunized only until the Secretary of Defense makes the\n\n“determination”; the “determination” must be made “as part of the implementation plan”; and the\n\n“implementation plan” must be submitted to the President by February 21, 2018. This means\n\nthat the “determination” must be made by February 21, 2018, and because the protections\n\nafforded to transgender individuals last only until the “determination” is made, those protections\n\nnecessarily lapse by February 21, 2018, unless the “determination” is made earlier.\n\nConsequently, as of January 1, 2018, transgender individuals are prohibited from acceding to the\n\nmilitary “until such time [that the President receives] a recommendation to the contrary that [he]\n\nfind[s] convincing;” and as of March 23, 2018, the military must authorize the discharge of\n\ntransgender service members. The protections afforded to these individuals by the terms of the\n\nPresidential Memorandum lapse, at the latest, by February 21, 2018.\n\n       Nothing in the August 2017 Statement by Secretary Mattis, or the Interim Guidance, can\n\nor does alter these realities. The Statement provides that Secretary Mattis will establish a panel\n\nof experts “to provide advice and recommendations on the implementation of the president’s\n\ndirection.” After the “panel reports its recommendations and following . . . consultation with the\n\nsecretary of Homeland Security,” Secretary Mattis will “provide [his] advice to the president\n\nconcerning implementation of his policy direction.” Put differently, the military is studying how\n\nto implement the directives of the Presidential Memorandum. Such a policy review and\n\nimplementation plan are likely necessitated by the fact that—as borne out by the RAND Report\n\nand the declarations submitted by the Pseudonym Plaintiffs—transgender service members\n\noccupy a variety of crucial positions throughout the military, including active duty postings in\n\n\n\n                                                 36\n\fwar zones. Presumably, the removal and replacement of such individuals during a time of war\n\ncannot occur overnight. Accordingly, Defendants are correct that policy decisions are still being\n\nmade. But the decisions that must be made are how to best implement a policy under which\n\ntransgender accession is prohibited, and discharge of transgender service members is authorized.\n\nUnless the directives of the Presidential Memorandum are altered—and there is no evidence that\n\nthey will be—military policy toward transgender individuals must fit within these confines.\n\n       Similarly, the Interim Guidance provides that “[n]ot later than February 21, 2018,\n\n[Secretary Mattis] will present the President with a plan to implement the policy and directives in\n\nthe Presidential Memorandum[,]” and that the “implementation plan will establish the policy,\n\nstandards and procedures for transgender individuals serving in the military.” True, the exact\n\ndetails of the plan to carry out the directives are unknown. But what is known, and what is the\n\nbedrock of Plaintiffs’ constitutional challenge, is that the implementation plan must prohibit\n\ntransgender accession and authorize the discharge of transgender service members. Otherwise,\n\nthe plan would be out of compliance with the requirements of the Presidential Memorandum, and\n\nthe Court shall not presume the military to be unfaithful to the orders of the President.\n\nConsequently, while the Court cannot presently adjudicate the merits of the yet-undecided details\n\nof how the directives will be carried out, it can adjudicate the constitutionality of the directives\n\nthemselves, which are definite, and must be implemented by the military.\n\n       Finally, although Defendants make much of the protections afforded by the Interim\n\nGuidance to transgender individuals, that protection is necessarily qualified by the Presidential\n\nMemorandum. The Interim Guidance provides that: “As directed by the [Presidential]\n\nMemorandum, no action may be taken to involuntarily separate or discharge an otherwise\n\nqualified Service member solely on the basis of a gender dysphoria diagnosis or transgender\n\n\n\n                                                  37\n\fstatus.” (Emphasis added). The protections afforded by the Presidential Memorandum lapse by\n\nFebruary 21, 2018, and discharge must be authorized by March 23, 2018. The Interim Guidance\n\ncan do nothing to obviate these facts. Nor is standing vitiated by the mere possibility that the\n\nPresident may alter the directives of the Presidential Memorandum.

Nor is there evidence that such a change may occur, given\n\nthe President’s unequivocal pronouncement that “the United States government will not accept\n\nor allow transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. military.” Accordingly, for\n\npurposes of its standing analysis, the Court concludes that there is a substantial likelihood that\n\ntransgender individuals will be indefinitely prevented from acceding to the military as of January\n\n1, 2018, and that the military shall authorize the discharge of current service members who are\n\ntransgender as of March 23, 2018.\n\n              b.

In City of Jacksonville, the\n\nSupreme Court assessed a city ordinance that “required that 10% of the amount spent on city\n\ncontracts be set aside each fiscal year for so-called ‘Minority Business Enterprises’ (MBE’s).”\n\n508 U.S. at 658. “Once projects were earmarked for MBE bidding by the city’s chief purchasing\n\nofficer, they were deemed reserved for minority business enterprises only.” Id. (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted). Plaintiff was an association of individuals and firms in the\n\nconstruction industry who did business in the city and most of whom did not qualify under the\n\nordinance. Id. at 659. The members of the association alleged that they “regularly bid on and\n\nperform[ed] construction work for the City of Jacksonville,” and that they “would have bid on\n\ndesignated set aside contracts but for the restrictions imposed by the ordinance.” Id. (internal\n\nquotations marks and alterations omitted). In assessing the members’ standing to challenge the\n\nordinance under these circumstances, the Court held that:\n\n               When the government erects a barrier that makes it more difficult\n               for members of one group to obtain a benefit than it is for members\n               of another group, a member of the former group seeking to challenge\n               the barrier need not allege that he would have obtained the benefit\n               but for the barrier in order to establish standing. The “injury in fact”\n               in an equal protection case of this variety is the denial of equal\n               treatment resulting from the imposition of the barrier, not the\n               ultimate inability to obtain the benefit. . . . And in the context of a\n               challenge to a set-aside program, the “injury in fact” is the inability\n               to compete on an equal footing in the bidding process, not the loss\n\n                                                 39\n\f               of a contract. . . . To establish standing, therefore, a party\n               challenging a set-aside program like Jacksonville’s need only\n               demonstrate that it is able and ready to bid on contracts and that a\n               discriminatory policy prevents it from doing so on an equal basis.\n\nId. at 666 (emphasis added) (citations omitted).\n\n       In Adarand, the Court assessed a requirement that federal agency contracts for general\n\ncontractors contain a clause providing for additional compensation if the general contractor hired\n\nsubcontractors “certified as small businesses controlled by socially and economically\n\ndisadvantaged individuals,” where socially and economically disadvantaged individuals were\n\ndeemed to include “Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native Americans, Asian Pacific\n\nAmericans, and other minorities . . . .” Adarand Constructors, Inc. v.

In assessing Plaintiff’s standing for purposes of prospective injunctive relief—\n\nthat is, with respect to future injuries—the Court held that the “concrete and particularized”\n\nelement of injury in fact was readily satisfied by Plaintiff’s “claim that the Government’s use of\n\nsubcontractor compensation clauses denies it equal protection of the laws . . . .” Id. at 211. The\n\nCourt was less certain, however, “that the future use of subcontractor compensation clauses will\n\ncause [the plaintiff] ‘imminent’ injury[,]” and consequently required a “showing that sometime\n\nin the relatively near future [the plaintiff] will bid on another Government contract that offers\n\nfinancial incentives to a prime contractor for hiring disadvantaged subcontractors.” Id. The\n\nplaintiff made a sufficient showing by demonstrating that it was “very likely” to bid on an\n\naffected contract at least once per year, and that in so bidding, the plaintiff often competed\n\nagainst small disadvantaged businesses.

Id. at 261.\n\nRelying on City of Jacksonville, the Court found that the plaintiff had standing because “the\n\nUniversity had denied him the opportunity to compete for admission on an equal basis.” Id. at\n\n262. In particular, “[a]fter being denied admission, [the plaintiff] demonstrated that he was ‘able\n\nand ready’ to apply as a transfer student should the University cease to use race in undergraduate\n\nadmissions.

The\n\nCourt disagreed, finding that plaintiff had standing because its members had “children in the\n\ndistrict’s elementary, middle, and high schools[,]” and injunctive relief was sought on behalf of\n\nmembers whose children “may be denied admission to the high schools of their choice when\n\n\n\n                                                 41\n\fthey apply for those schools in the future . . . .” Id.

There, the plaintiff challenged written and unwritten\n\nemployment policies by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) that\n\nallegedly discriminated on the basis of gender and race, and claimed standing for purposes of\n\nprospective injunctive relief by alleging that he intended “to apply for new positions and\n\npromotions at HUD on a regular basis in the future,” and that HUD would “violate his equal\n\nprotection and civil rights” when he did so. Id. at 858 (internal quotation marks and alteration\n\nomitted). Reviewing City of Jacksonville and Adarand, the D.C.

Id. at 859. Rather, according to the Circuit, “Adarand rests on the common-sense\n\nnotion that when a contractor depends for its livelihood on competing for government contracts,\n\nand when the government has committed itself to doling out those contracts on a race-conscious\n\nbasis, it stands to reason that the contractor will soon be competing on an uneven playing field.”\n\nId. at 859. “Under Adarand, then, the relevant consideration is whether the agency is sufficiently\n\ncommitted to a particular race-conscious policy that the plaintiff will likely face a career\n\nimpediment.” Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 42\n\f                   ii. Application to Plaintiffs\n\n        For purposes of the standing analysis, Plaintiffs fall into two groups: Named Plaintiffs—\n\nwho have yet to accede—and the Pseudonym Plaintiffs—who are currently in the military and\n\nfear that they will be discharged. These two groups challenge the two fundamental directives of\n\nthe Presidential Memorandum as unconstitutional: a reversion of accession and retention policy\n\nwith respect to transgender individuals (i.e., the Accession and Retention Directives). For the\n\nfollowing reasons, the Court concludes that: (i) the Accession and Retention Directives of the\n\nPresidential Memorandum impose a competitive barrier that the Named and Pseudonym\n\nPlaintiffs are substantially likely to encounter, and (ii) that this barrier constitutes an injury in\n\nfact sufficient to imbue the Named and Pseudonym Plaintiffs with standing to challenge the\n\npropriety of the Accession and Retention Directives of the Presidential Memorandum.\n\n        The Accession Directive\n\n        Plaintiff Kibby—one of the Named Plaintiffs—has demonstrated a substantial likelihood\n\nthat he is able and ready to accede to the military in the relatively near future, and consequently,\n\nthat he is in a position to challenge the Accession Directive to the extent it imposes a barrier on\n\nhim from acceding based on his transgender status.\n\n        Plaintiff Kibby was inducted into the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis,\n\nMaryland as a midshipman on July 1, 2017, and has completed his first two years of education,\n\nout of four. Kibby Decl. ¶ 1. “[A]ll midshipmen are members of the military, [but] are still\n\nconsidered part of an accessions program since [they] do not receive [their] commission until\n\ngraduation.” Id. ¶ 22. After graduation, Plaintiff Kibby hopes “to perform [his] service as a\n\nSurface Warfare Officer aboard a Navy ship.” Id. ¶ 9. Plaintiff Kibby informed his chain of\n\ncommand that he was transgender in early 2016. Id. ¶ 16. At the end of his last school year, in\n\n\n\n                                                   43\n\fMay 2017, the Commandant and Superintendent “officially approved [Plaintiff’s] medical\n\ntransition plan and the request for a year-long medical leave of absence.” Id. ¶ 26. The\n\ntransition plan was created in coordination with the Brigade Medical Officer and the\n\nTransgender Care Team at Portsmouth’s Naval Medical Center.” Id. ¶¶ 24–25. The medical\n\nyear of absence was taken to comply with the requirement under the June 2016 DTM that\n\nacceding transgender service members be fully transitioned to their chosen gender for at least 18\n\nmonths prior to accession. Id. ¶ 24. Defendants represent that “Plaintiff Kibby currently is on\n\nmedical leave and faces no impediment to returning to the Naval Academy when that leave ends\n\nin May 2018.” Defs.’ Mem. at 16. The Commandant of Midshipmen at the Naval Academy,\n\nRobert B. Chadwick, has represented that Plaintiff Kibby “was afforded much support from the\n\nBrigade Medical Unit, his chain of command, and [the Commandant’s] legal advisors in\n\ndeveloping his [transition] plan and submitting his request [for medical leave].” Chadwick Decl.\n\n¶ 4. According to the Commandant, the “purpose of the [medical] leave is to allow MIDN Kibby\n\nto undergo hormone treatment, and to [obtain] a period of gender stability of sufficient length\n\nunder current policy and guidance to ensure his eligibility to accept a commission in May 2020 if\n\nhe successfully completes the course of instruction upon return to [the Naval Academy].” Id. ¶\n\n10.\n\n       Upon his return, Plaintiff Kibby will be required to meet the male fitness requirements,\n\nwhich are more difficult than their female counterpart, as well as the Academy’s academic\n\nstandards. Id. ¶¶ 15-16. Plaintiff Kibby has represented that during the medical year of absence,\n\nhe is “completing a rigorous exercise and training regimen so that [he] will be able to meet the\n\nmale fitness standards upon [his] return[,]” and that he “can already meet the male standards for\n\npush-ups and sit-ups and will be working hard on [his] run time.” Kibby Decl. ¶ 28. Given his\n\n\n\n                                                44\n\fprior academic success at the Naval Academy, Kibby Decl. ¶ 39, the support afforded to his\n\ntransition plan by senior officials, and his representations regarding his fitness training, the Court\n\nfinds that Plaintiff Kibby has demonstrated a substantial likelihood that he will be able to meet\n\nthe graduation requirements of the Naval Academy. Following graduation, he will be in a\n\nposition to accede to the Navy or Marine Corps. Chadwick Decl. ¶ 16. Defendants have not\n\nargued or presented any evidence that Plaintiff Kibby will be unable to graduate from the Naval\n\nAcademy—an unsurprising position, given that dismissal stemming from the inability of\n\ntransgender individuals to accede would itself likely be an injury sufficient to confer standing to\n\nchallenge the constitutionality of the Presidential Memorandum.\n\n        Consequently, Plaintiff Kibby has demonstrated that he is “able and ready” to apply for\n\naccession. Using the words of Adarand, he is “very likely” to apply for accession in the\n\n“relatively near future.” Indeed, Plaintiff Kibby has demonstrated a greater likelihood of his\n\nbeing subject to the competitive barrier than many of the plaintiffs in the equal protection cases\n\ndiscussed above. In Parents Involved, the members of the plaintiff organization had standing\n\neven though it was possible that they would not even apply to an affected high school—and\n\nnothing was said of the possibility that the students could fail to graduate from elementary or\n\nmiddle school. In Gratz, the plaintiff merely stated an intention to apply as a transfer student—\n\nsurely it was possible that academic failures at his current institution, or other hardships, would\n\nhave prevented him from applying. Here, Plaintiff Kibby is on a defined track toward graduation\n\nfrom the Naval Academy and accession to the military. The track has been approved and\n\nsupported by his chain of command. Like any student at the Naval Academy, there are potential\n\nimpediments to his graduation. But Plaintiff Kibby has provided affirmative evidence of his\n\nability to overcome these impediments, and it is unlikely that his chain of command would have\n\n\n\n                                                 45\n\fadopted a transition plan if they doubted his ability to meet the Academy’s graduation\n\nrequirements. It is accordingly likely that he will graduate and attempt to accede. Anything else\n\nis the product of mere speculation. 6\n\n        The remaining question is whether Plaintiff Kibby is substantially likely to “hit” a barrier\n\nwhen he applies for accession to the military. As of January 2018, transgender individuals shall\n\nbe prohibited entry to the military, until such time that the President receives a recommendation\n\nto the contrary that he finds convincing. Given the President’s pronouncement that “the United\n\nStates government will not accept or allow transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the\n\nU.S. military,” there is no reason to believe that this directive will change by the time Plaintiff\n\nKibby is ready to apply for accession in May 2020. Chadwick Decl. ¶ 17. In short, the only\n\nbasis from which to conclude that the directive may change is the ever-present reality that every\n\nlaw is subject to change. But that is insufficient to deprive the Court of subject-matter\n\njurisdiction. Appalachian Power, 208 F.3d at 1022. Nor does the potential availability of a\n\nwaiver change this conclusion. First, Defendants have presented no evidence that waivers are\n\nactually made available to transgender individuals, or that they will be; and the only record\n\nevidence on this point suggests that transgender individuals are not entitled to waivers for\n\naccession purposes. See supra at 5–6. Second, even if a bona fide waiver process were made\n\navailable, Plaintiff Kibby would still be subject to a competitive barrier due to his transgender\n\n\n\n\n       6\n         Because the Court concludes that Plaintiff Kibby has a substantial likelihood of\nattempting to accede, the Court need not and does not decide whether Plaintiff Kohere has also\ndemonstrated a likelihood of accession sufficient to stake out an equal protection claim based on\nthe Accession Directive.

For accession purposes, he would be presumptively disqualified because of his\n\ntransgender status, unless he obtains a waiver. Those who are not transgender are not subject to\n\nthe same blanket proscription. Consequently, a waiver process would not vitiate the barrier that\n\nPlaintiff Kibby claims is violative of equal protection. Accordingly, Plaintiff Kibby has\n\ndemonstrated that he is substantially likely to attempt to accede, and to encounter a competitive\n\nbarrier at the time of his accession due to his status as a transgender individual, which he claims\n\nis violative of equal protection. This is sufficient to confer standing to challenge the Accession\n\nDirective at this preliminary stage.\n\n       With respect to the Pseudonym Plaintiffs, there is no real doubt that they will remain in\n\nthe military for long enough to hit the “barrier” that they claim is violative of equal protection.\n\nEach has submitted a declaration stating, and/or alleged, their intention to remain in military\n\nservice, and Defendants have submitted declarations for each Pseudonym Plaintiff stating that\n\nthey shall not be discharged until the military’s new policy regarding transgender service\n\nmembers takes effect. See supra at 19–28; Defs.’ Mem at 10–12. There is also no real doubt\n\nthat they will face a competitive barrier to their continued retention by the military. As of March\n\n23, 2018, the military is required to effect a policy by which these service members can be\n\ndischarged solely due to their transgender status. This barrier to their continued retention is\n\nimposed upon them, but not other service members. And Plaintiffs claim that this competitive\n\nbarrier is violative of equal protection. Accordingly, at this preliminary stage, the Pseudonym\n\nPlaintiffs have demonstrated a substantial likelihood of standing to challenge the Presidential\n\nMemorandum’s Retention Directive. See Worth, 451 F.3d at 859 (“Under Adarand, . . . the\n\nrelevant consideration is whether the agency is sufficiently committed to a particular race-\n\nconscious policy that the plaintiff will likely face a career impediment.”).\n\n\n\n                                                 47\n\f                  iii. Substantial Risk of Injury\n\n       Plaintiffs have also established a substantial risk of two future injuries: denial of\n\naccession and discharge from military service. The substantial risk of these two future injuries is\n\nsufficient to constitute an injury in fact. As explained by the Supreme Court, “[a]n allegation of\n\nfuture injury may suffice if the threatened injury is certainly impending, or there is a substantial\n\nrisk that the harm will occur.” SBA List, 134 S. Ct. at 2341 (internal quotation marks omitted;\n\nciting Clapper, 133 S. Ct. at 1147, 1150, n.5). Here, even assuming that the future injuries are\n\nnot “certainly impending,” there is a “substantial risk” of their occurrence.\n\n       The D.C. Circuit has explained that “the proper way to analyze an increased-risk-of-harm\n\nclaim is to consider the ultimate alleged harm . . . as the concrete and particularized injury and\n\nthen to determine whether the increased risk of such harm makes injury to an individual citizen\n\nsufficiently imminent for standing purposes.” Attias v. Carefirst, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">865</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">620</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 627 (D.C.\n\nCir. 2017) (internal quotation marks omitted). In some circumstances, the chain of events that is\n\nnecessary for the putative future harm to occur is too attenuated to constitute a substantial risk of\n\nthat harm and to render that harm imminent. Consequently, in Clapper, the Supreme Court\n\ndeclined to find standing because the plaintiffs’ “theory of standing [relied] on a highly\n\nattenuated chain of possibilities . . . .” 568 U.S. at 410. “Several links in this chain would have\n\nrequired the assumption that independent decisionmakers charged with policy discretion . . . and\n\nwith resolving complex legal and factual questions . . . would exercise their discretion in a\n\nspecific way. . . . With so many links in the causal chain, the injury that the plaintiffs feared was\n\ntoo speculative to qualify as ‘injury in fact.’” Attias, 865 F.3d at 626 (citation omitted).\n\nMeanwhile, in Attias, a personal data theft case, the D.C. Circuit found standing where the\n\nplaintiffs plausibly alleged that “an unauthorized party has already accessed personally\n\n\n\n                                                 48\n\fidentifying data on [the] servers, and it [was] much less speculative . . . to infer that this party\n\n[had] both the intent and the ability to use that data for ill.” Id. at 628. Here, there is no doubt\n\nthat the denial of accession and discharge from the military constitute concrete and particularized\n\ninjuries. Whether these are also imminent, based on the reasoning of Clapper and Attias,\n\nrequires an analysis of the degree to which these future harms are separated from the present by a\n\n“series of contingent events . . . .” Id.\n\n        In Navy Chaplaincy, the plaintiffs, military chaplains who were “non-liturgical\n\nProtestants,” alleged that “the Navy systematically discriminate[d] against members of their\n\nreligious denominations in the awarding of promotions in violation” of the Establishment Clause.\n\nIn re Navy Chaplaincy, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">697</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1171</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1173 (D.C. Cir. 2012). The plaintiffs claimed standing\n\nfor purposes of prospective injunctive relief on the basis that “they face[d] future injury because\n\nthey [would] likely suffer discrimination on the basis of their religious denomination when they\n\nare considered for promotion . . . .” Id. at 1176. In the court’s view, the plaintiffs’ assertion of\n\nfuture injury depended on “two subsidiary premises: that plaintiffs will be considered for\n\npromotion by future selection boards and that selection boards will discriminate against them on\n\nthe basis of their religious denomination.” Id. The court found that the plaintiffs had\n\nsatisfactorily established both premises. With respect to the first, because the “Navy concede[d]\n\nthat future selection boards may very well consider the promotion of at least some plaintiffs.” Id.\n\nWith respect to the second, because “plaintiffs challenge[d] specific policies and procedures . . . .\n\nthat they claim[ed] resulted in denominational discrimination . . . .” Id.\n\n        Plaintiffs have demonstrated a chain of causation leading to concrete and particularized\n\ninjuries in which there are few links and each link is substantially likely to occur. With respect\n\nto the Accession Directive, Plaintiff Kibby will suffer an injury in fact if he: (i) graduates from\n\n\n\n                                                  49\n\fthe Naval Academy; (ii) applies for accession; and (iii) is denied accession due to his transgender\n\nstatus. The first two links in this chain are substantially likely to occur for the reasons already\n\nstated. See supra at 43–46. The third is likely to occur because the Presidential Memorandum\n\nindefinitely delays the accession of transgender individuals, and the President has unequivocally\n\nstated that transgender individuals shall not be permitted to serve in the military. Given this\n\nactuality, it is speculative to assume that transgender individuals will be permitted to accede by\n\nMay 2020. At present, there is a substantial risk that accession will remain forbidden, and\n\nPlaintiff Kibby will be precluded from military service.\n\n       For the Pseudonym Plaintiffs, the chain of causation is even shorter. They will suffer an\n\ninjury in fact if: (i) they remain in the military; and (ii) are discharged based on their transgender\n\nstatus after March 23, 2018 due to the Retention Directive. On the first point, there is no\n\ndisagreement that the Pseudonym Plaintiffs are qualified service members who desire to remain\n\nin military service. See supra at 19–28. On the second point, the available evidence is that the\n\nPresident—who ultimately controls the military—issued a statement that “the United States\n\ngovernment will not . . . allow transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S.\n\nmilitary,” and shortly thereafter, issued a Presidential Memorandum that requires the military to\n\nauthorize the discharge of transgender service members by March 23, 2018. True, it is\n\nconceivable that the Pseudonym Plaintiffs will not be discharged from the military, despite the\n\nhead of the military stating that they will be. But in the absence of a crystal ball, and in light of\n\nthese unequivocal factual circumstances, at the present time, the Pseudonym Plaintiffs face a\n\nsubstantial risk of discharge. This confers upon them an injury in fact.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  50\n\f                  iv. Plaintiffs Have Standing to Challenge the Accession and Retention\n                     Directives\n       For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs have established two injuries in fact with respect to\n\nthe Accession and Retention Directives. First, they have demonstrated a substantial likelihood\n\nthat they will face a competitive barrier with respect to accession and retention due to their\n\ntransgender status. Second, they have demonstrated a substantial risk that they will be denied\n\naccession or discharged from the military due to their transgender status. Defendants do not\n\ncontest that these injuries are caused by the Accession and Retention Directives of the\n\nPresidential Memorandum, or that they are redressable by judicial intervention, and the Court\n\nfinds that the causation and redressability elements of standing have been satisfied. Were it not\n\nfor the Presidential Memorandum, the blanket prohibition against accession by transgender\n\nindividuals would have expired on January 1, 2018. Because of the Presidential Memorandum,\n\nthat prohibition is extended indefinitely. Furthermore, the Presidential Memorandum requires\n\nthe reversion of military policy to one where individuals can be discharged solely based on their\n\ntransgender status. Previously, such action was prohibited by the June 2016 DTM. The\n\naccession and retention injuries are caused by the Presidential Memorandum, and they would be\n\nredressed to the extent the Court invalidates the directives of the memorandum. Accordingly,\n\nPlaintiffs have standing to challenge the Accession and Retention Directives.\n\n                  v. Plaintiffs Do Not Have Standing to Challenge the Sex Reassignment\n                     Surgery Directive\n\n       Although the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have standing to challenge the Accession\n\nand Retention Directives, none of the Plaintiffs have demonstrated an injury in fact with respect\n\nto the Sex Reassignment Surgery Directive. First, only some Plaintiffs are implicated by the\n\nprovision at all. For those that are, the risk of being impacted by the Sex Reassignment Surgery\n\nDirective is not sufficiently great to confer standing.\n\n                                                 51\n\f      Jane Doe 1 alleges that “a transition-related procedure Jane Doe 1 was scheduled for was\n\nsummarily canceled by the Defense Health Agency.” Am. Compl. ¶ 16. However, Defendants\n\nhave submitted a declaration representing that “Jane Doe 1’s application for the supplemental\n\nhealth care waiver necessary to receive a transition-related surgery is currently being processed\n\nby the Defense Health Agency.” Defs.’ Mem. at 10. Accordingly, Jane Doe 1 has not\n\ndemonstrated that she will not receive the surgery prior to the effective date of the Sex\n\nReassignment Surgery Directive.\n\n      Jane Doe 3 has developed a transition treatment plan, but will not begin her treatment until\n\nafter she returns from active deployment in Iraq. See supra at 22. Given the possibility of\n\ndischarge, the uncertainties attended by the fact that she has yet to begin any transition treatment,\n\nand the lack of certainty on when such treatment will begin, the prospective harm engendered by\n\nthe Sex Reassignment Surgery Directive is too speculative to constitute an injury in fact with\n\nrespect to Jane Doe 3. Furthermore, John Doe 1 is scheduled for transition related-surgery on\n\nJanuary 4, 2018, and Defendants have represented that this date remains unaffected by the\n\nPresidential Memorandum. Defs.’ Mem. at 11. Finally, the Named Plaintiffs are not currently in\n\nthe military and it is speculative whether they will need surgery while in military service.\n\nPlaintiff Kibby, in particular, has stated that he will transition prior to applying for accession.\n\nSee supra at 26–27. Accordingly, no Plaintiffs have demonstrated that they are substantially\n\nlikely to be impacted by the Sex Reassignment Surgery Directive, and none have standing to\n\nchallenge that directive.\n\n      2. Ripeness\n\n       Defendants also challenge the Court’s subject-matter jurisdiction on the basis of ripeness.\n\n“Determining whether administrative action is ripe for judicial review requires [the Court] to\n\n\n\n                                                  52\n\fevaluate (1) the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and (2) the hardship to the parties of\n\nwithholding court consideration.” Nat’l Park Hosp.

On the first prong, the Court must consider: “whether the issue is purely legal, whether\n\nconsideration of the issue would benefit from a more concrete setting, and whether the agency’s\n\naction is sufficiently final.” Nat’l Ass’n of Home Builders v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186625\"><a href=\"/opinion/186625/natl-assn-home-bldrs-v-us-army-corps-eng/\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">459</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 463–64 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). On the second prong, the\n\nCourt must consider “whether postponing judicial review would impose an undue burden on [the\n\nPlaintiffs] or would benefit the court.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n       A facial equal protection challenge is a purely legal question. See Beach Commc’ns, Inc.\n\nv. FCC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"580258\"><a href=\"/opinion/580258/beach-communications-inc-maxtel-limited-partnership-pacific-cablevision/\"><span class=\"volume\">959</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">975</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 986 (D.C. Cir. 1992). To the extent the Court considers factual issues\n\nwith respect to the equal protection analysis, they are only those facts that are already\n\nestablished: namely, those going to the basis for the issuance of the Presidential Memorandum.\n\nFuture factual development does not alter that basis, and is consequently irrelevant to the equal\n\nprotection analysis. Defendants do not contest this point. See XP Vehicles, Inc. v. Dep’t of\n\nEnergy, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">38</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 58 (D.D.C. 2015) (finding Fifth Amendment challenge to be a\n\npurely legal inquiry).\n\n       To a large extent, Defendants’ ripeness arguments have already been addressed in the\n\nstanding context. The Court reiterates its conclusion here. While there is present uncertainty\n\nregarding the exact details of the military’s future policy towards transgender service members,\n\nthere is no uncertainty regarding two directives of the Presidential Memorandum: the military\n\nmust authorize the discharge of transgender service members, and accession by transgender\n\nindividuals is prohibited, indefinitely. The Court does not adjudicate the details of that future\n\npolicy, but rather, only assesses whether these directives in-and-of-themselves violate the\n\n\n\n                                                  53\n\fConstitution. The directives are known, and so are the circumstances under which they were\n\nissued. They cannot be more concrete, and future policy by the military—absent action from the\n\nPresident—cannot change what the directives require. There is no reason to believe that the\n\nPresident will alter these directives, and the Court must assume that they will be faithfully\n\nexecuted by the military. See National Mining Association, 145 F.3d at 1408; Appalachian\n\nPower, 208 F.3d at 1022. Consequently, the constitutionality of the Accession and Retention\n\nDirectives is a matter fit for judicial resolution.\n\n        Furthermore, the nature of the equal protection analysis in this case, which assesses the\n\nfacial validity of the Presidential Memorandum, means that the Court would not benefit from\n\ndelay—the salient facts regarding the issuance of the Presidential Memorandum are not subject\n\nto change. This contrasts with the burden that delay would impose upon Plaintiffs, who must\n\ncontinue to serve or strive toward service, expending resources and declining other opportunities,\n\nwhile faced with the prospect of discharge and preclusion of military service, and the stigma that\n\nthe Presidential Memorandum attaches to service by transgender individuals. See supra at 19–\n\n28. Accordingly, the propriety of the Accession and Retention Directives is a matter ripe for\n\nadjudication.\n\n        Because Plaintiffs have established standing and ripeness with respect to the Accession\n\nand Retention Directives of the Presidential Memorandum, the Court turns to the merits.\n\nB. Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim\n\n        Plaintiffs assert two overarching claims in this case. Plaintiffs’ first broad claim is that,\n\nfor a variety of reasons, the Presidential Memorandum violates the guarantees of the Due Process\n\nClause of the Fifth Amendment. Plaintiffs’ second distinct claim is for estoppel. Defendants\n\nmove to dismiss both claims under Federal Rule 12(b)(6). For the same reasons the Court\n\nconcludes that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their Due Process Clause\n                                                      54\n\fchallenge for the purposes of their motion for preliminary injunction—discussed below—the\n\nCourt will not dismiss Plaintiffs’ Due Process Clause claims.\n\n       However, the Court will dismiss, without prejudice, Plaintiffs’ estoppel claim. The\n\nSupreme Court has expressed substantial skepticism with respect to government estoppel, noting\n\nthat when “the Government is unable to enforce the law because the conduct of its agents has\n\ngiven rise to an estoppel, the interest of the citizenry as a whole in obedience to the rule of law is\n\nundermined.” Heckler v. Cmty. Health Servs. of Crawford Cty., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111187\"><a href=\"/opinion/111187/heckler-v-community-health-services-of-crawford-cty-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">51</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 60 (1984).\n\nNonetheless, the Court has refused to adopt “a flat rule that estoppel may not in any\n\ncircumstances run against the Government,” noting that “the public interest in ensuring that the\n\nGovernment can enforce the law free from estoppel might be outweighed by the countervailing\n\ninterest of citizens in some minimum standard of decency, honor, and reliability in their dealings\n\nwith their Government.” Id. at 60–61; see also Office of Pers. Mgmt. v. Richmond, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112458\"><a href=\"/opinion/112458/office-of-personnel-management-v-richmond/\"><span class=\"volume\">496</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">414</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n419 (1990) (“From our earliest cases, we have recognized that equitable estoppel will not lie\n\nagainst the Government as it lies against private litigants.”).\n\n       Defendants contend that Plaintiffs’ estoppel claim fails because there is no recognized\n\nfederal cause of action for estoppel. Defs.’ Mem. at 37. The Court declines to dismiss Plaintiffs’\n\nclaim on this basis, however, because although judicial hostility has been expressed with respect\n\nto government estoppel, neither the Supreme Court or the D.C. Circuit have definitively ruled\n\nout the claim. In fact, recent decisions by the D.C. Circuit have at least assessed the claim on the\n\nmerits. See Masters Pharm., Inc. v. DEA, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">861</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">206</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 225 (D.C.

Cir. 2000). Accordingly, at least by implication, the D.C. Circuit has recognized that\n\n\n\n\n                                                  55\n\fan estoppel claim may be brought against agency defendants—here, the Departments of Defense\n\nand Homeland Security—under certain circumstances.\n\n       The elements of a government estoppel claim are that “(1) the government made a\n\n‘definite representation’; (2) on which the entity ‘relied in such a manner as to change its\n\nposition for the worse’; (3) the entity’s reliance was reasonable; and (4) ‘the government\n\nengaged in affirmative misconduct.’” Masters Pharm., 861 F.3d at 225 (citations and alterations\n\nomitted). The affirmative misconduct element requires a showing “that government agents\n\nengage[d]—by commission or omission—in conduct that can be characterized as\n\nmisrepresentation or concealment, or, at least, behave[d] in ways that have or will cause an\n\negregiously unfair result.” GAO v.

Cir. 1983).\n\n       Based on the allegations in the Amended Complaint, the Court concludes that the facts of\n\nthis case are not actionable under an “estoppel” theory. Plaintiffs claim that the June 2016 DTM\n\n“constituted a definite representation to Plaintiffs that they would be able to serve openly.” Pls.’\n\nMem. at 26. However, the DTM was not a definite representation to any of the individuals\n\nPlaintiffs, but rather constituted a broad policy decision by the government that affected scores\n\nof individuals. The DTM did not specifically represent to any particular individual that he or she\n\nwould be permitted to serve. The cases that Plaintiffs cite are distinguishable on this basis. For\n\nexample, in Watkins, the Ninth Circuit estopped the Army from refusing to reenlist the plaintiff\n\n“on the basis of his homosexuality” because “the Army affirmatively acted in violation of its\n\nown regulations when it repeatedly represented that [the plaintiff] was eligible to reenlist, as well\n\nas when it reenlisted him time after time.” Watkins v. U.S. Army, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"523620\"><a href=\"/opinion/523620/sergeant-perry-watkins-v-united-states-army/\"><span class=\"volume\">875</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">699</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 707–08, 731\n\n(9th Cir. 1989). These representations were directed at the plaintiff, because on “the one\n\n\n\n                                                 56\n\foccasion when the record was unclear, [the plaintiff] sought clarification and his classification\n\nwas immediately changed from ‘unknown’ to ‘eligible for reentry on active duty.’” Id. at 707.\n\nSimilarly, in Johnson, the Ninth Circuit estopped the government from rescinding the plaintiff’s\n\nparole “after his parole computation had passed successfully through as many as eight\n\nadministrative reviews . . . .” Johnson v. Williford, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"406151\"><a href=\"/opinion/406151/charles-a-johnson-v-j-williford-warden-metropolitan-correctional/\"><span class=\"volume\">682</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">868</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 872 (9th Cir. 1982).\n\n       It may be that some Plaintiffs have detrimentally relied upon specific representations\n\nfrom their chain of command that could more plausibly support a government estoppel claim, but\n\nif that is the case, those instances are not adequately alleged; only generalized assertions of\n\nreliance are asserted in the complaint. See, e.g., Am. Compl. ¶ 3 (“Plaintiffs, along with many\n\nother service members, have followed protocol in informing their chain of command that they\n\nare transgender. They did so in reliance on the United States’ express promises that it would\n\npermit them to continue to serve their country openly.”); ¶ 14 (“In or around June 2016, in\n\nreliance on the issuance of the policy permitting open service by transgender service members,\n\nJane Doe 1 notified her command that she is transgender.”); ¶ 31 (“After June 2016, in reliance\n\non the announcement that transgender people would be permitted to serve openly, she notified\n\nher superiors that she is transgender. She has served in the intervening time without incident.”).\n\nAllowing estoppel claims to go forward based on such generalized theories of reliance would\n\nseem to implicate the reasonable concerns other courts have raised about government estoppel.\n\n       Furthermore, Plaintiffs have not plausibly alleged that government agents have engaged\n\nin specific instances of “affirmative misconduct.” No affirmative instances of misrepresentation\n\nor concealment have been plausibly alleged. While Plaintiffs point to the revocation of the June\n\n2016 DTM—via the Presidential Memorandum—as “egregiously unfair,” they fail to articulate\n\nhow that unfairness is the product of “misconduct” as the Court understands that term in this\n\n\n\n                                                 57\n\fcontext. See Pl.’s Mem. at 28. Because these specific facts have not been plausibly alleged, the\n\nCourt shall not permit the estoppel claim to proceed at this time. Accordingly, the claim is\n\ndismissed without prejudice.\n\nC. Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction\n\n       Having determined that Plaintiffs have standing to challenge the Accession and Retention\n\nDirectives and that their claims are ripe, the Court moves on to consider Plaintiffs’ motion for\n\npreliminary injunction. Plaintiffs ask the Court to enjoin the enforcement of the Accession and\n\nRetention Directives pending the final resolution of this lawsuit. The Court will grant Plaintiffs’\n\nmotion. The Court finds (1) that Plaintiffs have a likelihood of succeeding on their claim that the\n\nAccession and Retention Directives violate the Fifth Amendment, (2) that Plaintiffs would suffer\n\nirreparable injury in the absence of an injunction, and (3) that the balance of equities and the\n\npublic interest favor granting injunctive relief.\n\n       1. Likelihood of Success on the Merits\n\n       Although Plaintiffs’ estoppel claim has been dismissed, the Court is convinced that\n\nPlaintiffs are likely to succeed in this lawsuit under the Fifth Amendment. The Due Process\n\nClause of the Fifth Amendment provides that “No person shall be . . . deprived of life, liberty, or\n\nproperty, without due process of law.” U.S. Const. amend. V. Although Plaintiffs have\n\nsuggested a number of different analytical frameworks for considering whether the Accession\n\nand Retention Directives violate this guarantee, the Court finds the framework applicable to the\n\nDue Process Clause’s equal protection component most relevant. “In numerous decisions, [the\n\nSupreme Court] ‘has held that the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment forbids the\n\nFederal Government to deny equal protection of the laws.’” Davis v. Passman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110097\"><a href=\"/opinion/110097/davis-v-passman/\"><span class=\"volume\">442</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">228</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n234 (1979) (quoting Vance v.

Level of Scrutiny\n\n       The general rule is that government action that treats certain classes of people differently\n\n“is presumed to be valid and will be sustained if the classification drawn . . . is rationally related\n\nto a legitimate state interest.” City of Cleburne, Tex. v.

In those instances, the Court must apply a heightened degree of scrutiny. Id.\n\n       At this preliminary stage of the case, the Court is persuaded that it must apply a\n\nheightened degree of scrutiny to the Accession and Retention Directives. The Court reaches this\n\nconclusion for two reasons. First, on the current record, transgender individuals—who are alone\n\ntargeted for exclusion by the Accession and Retention Directives—appear to satisfy the criteria\n\nof at least a quasi-suspect classification. “The Supreme Court has used several explicit criteria to\n\nidentify suspect and quasi-suspect classifications.” Padula v.

The Court has already\nfound that Plaintiffs have standing and ripe claims.\n                                                  59\n\fcharacteristics not truly indicative of their abilities.” Massachusetts Bd. of Ret. v.

Also relevant is whether the group has been “relegated to such a position of political\n\npowerlessness as to command extraordinary protection from the majoritarian political process.”\n\nId.

It\n\nis well-established that gender-based discrimination includes discrimination based on non-\n\nconformity with gender stereotypes. See Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112252\"><a href=\"/opinion/112252/price-waterhouse-v-hopkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">228</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 251 (1989)\n\n(“[W]e are beyond the day when an employer could evaluate employees by assuming or insisting\n\nthat they matched the stereotype associated with their group”). The Accession and Retention\n\nDirectives’ exclusion of transgender individuals inherently discriminates against current and\n\naspiring service members on the basis of their failure to conform to gender stereotypes. The\n\ndefining characteristic of a transgender individual is that their inward identity, behavior, and\n\npossibly their physical characteristics, do not conform to stereotypes of how an individual of\n\ntheir assigned sex should feel, act and look. See Medical Amici Brief at 3-13. By excluding an\n\nentire category of people from military service on this characteristic alone, the Accession and\n\nRetention Directives punish individuals for failing to adhere to gender stereotypes. See\n\nWhitaker, 858 F.3d at 1051 (holding that heightened scrutiny used for sex-based classifications\n\napplied to school policy requiring transgender student to use bathroom of sex listed on his birth\n\ncertificate because it “treat[ed] transgender students . . . who fail to conform to the sex-based\n\nstereotypes associated with their assigned sex at birth, differently. . . .

A service member who was born\n\na male is punished by the Accession and Retention Directives if he identifies as a woman,\n\nwhereas that same service member would be free to join and remain in the military if he was\n\nborn a female, or if he agreed to act in the way society expects males to act. The Accession and\n\nRetention Directives are accordingly inextricably intertwined with gender classifications.\n\n       For these two reasons, the Court will apply an intermediate level of scrutiny to\n\nDefendants’ exclusion of transgender individuals from the military, akin to the level of scrutiny\n\napplicable in gender discrimination cases. Before moving on to that analysis, however, the Court\n\npauses to note that meaningful scrutiny of the constitutionality of the Accession and Retention\n\nDirectives is appropriate despite the fact that they pertain to decisions about military personnel.\n\nAlthough the Court recognizes that deference to the Executive and Congress is warranted in the\n\nmilitary context, the Court is not powerless to assess whether the constitutional rights of\n\nAmerica’s service members have been violated. The D.C. Circuit has explained that although\n\n“the operation of the military is vested in Congress and the Executive, and . . . it is not for the\n\ncourts to establish the composition of the armed forces[,] . . . constitutional questions that arise\n\nout of military decisions regarding the composition of the armed forces are not committed to the\n\nother coordinate branches of government.” Emory v.

Application of Intermediate Scrutiny\n\n       Having determined that an intermediate level of heightened scrutiny should apply to the\n\nAccession and Retention Directives’ discrimination against transgender individuals, the Court\n\nmoves on to assessing whether Plaintiffs are likely to succeed when that level of scrutiny is\n\nactually applied. Under intermediate scrutiny, the government must demonstrate an\n\n“exceedingly persuasive justification” for its actions. United States v. Virginia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118056\"><a href=\"/opinion/118056/united-states-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">515</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n531 (1996). “The burden of justification is demanding and it rests entirely on” the government.\n\nId. at 533. The government “must show ‘at least that the [challenged] classification serves\n\nimportant governmental objectives and that the discriminatory means employed are substantially\n\nrelated to the achievement of those objectives.’” Id. (quoting Mississippi Univ. for Women v.\n\nHogan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110793\"><a href=\"/opinion/110793/mississippi-univ-for-women-v-hogan/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">718</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 724 (1982) (internal quotations omitted)). “The justification must be\n\ngenuine, not hypothesized or invented post hoc in response to litigation.” Id. “And it must not\n\nrely on overbroad generalizations about the different talents, capacities, or preferences of males\n\nand females.” Id. Finally, it is well established that “[t]he Constitution’s guarantee of equality\n\n‘must at the very least mean that a bare . . . desire to harm a politically unpopular group cannot’\n\njustify disparate treatment of that group.” Windsor, 133 S. Ct. at 2693 (quoting U. S. Dep’t of\n\nAgric. v.

At the outset, the Court reiterates precisely what is at issue\n\nin this case: a policy banning the accession, and allowing the discharge, of an entire category of\n\nindividuals from the military solely because they are transgender, despite their ability to meet all\n\nof the physical, psychological, and other standards for military service. Defendants argue that\n\nthis policy is necessary for three reasons. First, Defendants argue that “at least some transgender\n\nindividuals suffer from medical conditions that could impede the performance of their duties.”\n\nDefs.’ Mem. at 31. Second, Defendants argue that “there is room for the military to think” that\n\ncertain medical conditions “may limit the deployability of transgender individuals as well as\n\nimpose additional costs on the armed forces.” Id. at 32. Third, Defendants argue that “the\n\nPresident could reasonably conclude” that the presence of transgender individuals in the military\n\nwould harm “unit cohesion.” Id. at 33. 9\n\n        Plaintiffs do not dispute that maximizing military effectiveness, lethality and unit\n\ncohesion, and even budgetary considerations, are all important or at least legitimate government\n\ninterests. Pls.’ Mem. at 17. They do challenge, however, whether Defendants can satisfy their\n\nburden of demonstrating that the discriminatory means that have been employed in the\n\nPresidential Memorandum—the Accession and Retention Directives—are “substantially related”\n\nto the achievement of these objectives. Based on the combined effect of a number of unusual\n\nfactors, the Court finds it likely that Plaintiffs will succeed on this claim.\n\n        First, the reasons given for the decision to exclude transgender service members appear to\n\nbe hypothetical and extremely overbroad. For instance, Defendants cite concerns that “some”\n\ntransgender individuals “could” suffer from medical conditions that impede their duties, and\n\n\n\n        9\n         Plaintiffs note that similar arguments were proffered in support of prior policies\nprecluding service members from being openly gay, maintaining racially segregated ranks and\nexcluding women from military colleges.\n                                                  65\n\fassert that “there is room for the military to think” that transgender people may be limited in\n\ntheir deployability at times. As an initial matter, these hypothetical concerns could be raised\n\nabout any service members. Moreover, these concerns do not explain the need to discharge and\n\ndeny accession to all transgender people who meet the relevant physical, mental and medical\n\nstandards for service. The Accession and Retention Directives are accordingly extremely\n\noverbroad when considered in the light of their proffered justifications. See Romer v. Evans, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118027\"><a href=\"/opinion/118027/romer-v-evans/\"><span class=\"volume\">517</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">620</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 632 (1996) (holding that law’s “sheer breadth is so discontinuous with the reasons\n\noffered for it that [it] seems inexplicable by anything but animus toward the class it affects”).\n\nThe breadth of the Accession and Retention Directives is also discontinuous with the purported\n\nconcern about costs, which, in addition to having been found to be minimal or negligible,\n\napparently are primarily related to a surgical procedure that only a subset of transgender\n\nindividuals will even need. Similarly, Defendants provide practically no explanation at all, let\n\nalone support, for their suggestion that the presence of transgender individuals may be harmful to\n\n“unit cohesion.” 10 Indeed, Defendants themselves highlight the absence of any prior studies or\n\nevaluations supporting the proffered justifications by arguing that they must now conduct studies\n\nregarding transgender military service before they can adequately defend the President’s\n\ndecision. At most, Defendants’ reasons appear therefore to be based on unsupported, “overbroad\n\ngeneralizations about the different talents, capacities, or preferences,” of transgender people.\n\nVirginia, 518 U.S. at 533.\n\n\n\n\n       10\n          To the extent this is a thinly-veiled reference to an assumption that other service\nmembers are biased against transgender people, this would not be a legitimate rationale for the\nchallenged policy. “Private biases may be outside the reach of the law, but the law cannot,\ndirectly or indirectly, give them effect.” See Palmore v. Sidoti, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111160\"><a href=\"/opinion/111160/palmore-v-sidoti/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">429</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 433 (1984).\n                                                 66\n\f       Nonetheless, given the deference owed to military personnel decisions, the Court has not\n\nbased its conclusion solely on the speculative and overbroad nature of the President’s reasons. A\n\nsecond point is also crucial. As far as the Court is aware at this preliminary stage, all of the\n\nreasons proffered by the President for excluding transgender individuals from the military in this\n\ncase were not merely unsupported, but were actually contradicted by the studies, conclusions\n\nand judgment of the military itself. As described above, the effect of transgender individuals\n\nserving in the military had been studied by the military immediately prior to the issuance of the\n\nPresidential Memorandum. In connection with the working group chaired by the Under\n\nSecretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, the RAND National Defense Research\n\nInstitute conducted a study and issued a report largely debunking any potential concerns about\n\nunit cohesion, military readiness, deployability or health care costs related to transgender\n\nmilitary service. The Department of Defense Working Group, made up of senior uniformed\n\nofficers and senior civilian officers from each military department, unanimously concluded that\n\nthere were no barriers that should prevent transgender individuals from serving in the military,\n\nrejecting the very concerns supposedly underlying the Accession and Retention Directives. In\n\nfact, the Working Group concluded that prohibiting transgender service members would\n\nundermine military effectiveness and readiness. Next, the Army, Air Force and Navy each\n\nconcluded that transgender individuals should be allowed to serve. Finally, the Secretary of\n\nDefense concluded that the needs of the military were best served by allowing transgender\n\nindividuals to openly serve. In short, the military concerns purportedly underlying the\n\nPresident’s decision had been studied and rejected by the military itself. 11 This highly unusual\n\n\n\n       11\n          This differentiates this case from Goldman v. Weinberger, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111616\"><a href=\"/opinion/111616/goldman-v-weinberger/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">503</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 508 (1986), a\ncase cited by Defendants, in which the court deferred to a decision that was based on the\n“considered professional judgment of the Air Force.”\n                                                 67\n\fsituation is further evidence that the reasons offered for the Accession and Retention Directives\n\nwere not substantially related to the military interests the Presidential Memorandum cited.\n\n       Third, the Court has also considered the circumstances surrounding the announcement of\n\nthe President’s policy. “In determining whether a law is motived by an improper animus or\n\npurpose, ‘[d]iscriminations of an unusual character’ especially require careful consideration.”\n\nWindsor, 133 S. Ct. at 2693 (quoting Romer, 517 U.S. at 633). The discrimination in this case\n\nwas certainly of an unusual character. As explained above, after a lengthy review process by\n\nsenior military personnel, the military had recently determined that permitting transgender\n\nindividuals to serve would not have adverse effects on the military and had announced that such\n\nindividuals were free to serve openly. Many transgender service members identified themselves\n\nto their commanding officers in reliance on that pronouncement. Then, the President abruptly\n\nannounced, via Twitter—without any of the formality or deliberative processes that generally\n\naccompany the development and announcement of major policy changes that will gravely affect\n\nthe lives of many Americans—that all transgender individuals would be precluded from\n\nparticipating in the military in any capacity. These circumstances provide additional support for\n\nPlaintiffs’ claim that the decision to exclude transgender individuals was not driven by genuine\n\nconcerns regarding military efficacy. See Vill. of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp.,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109573\"><a href=\"/opinion/109573/arlington-heights-v-metropolitan-housing-development-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">252</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 267 (1977) (holding that “[t]he specific sequence of events leading up the\n\nchallenged decision . . . may shed some light on the decisionmaker’s purposes” and “[d]epartures\n\nfrom the normal procedural sequence also might afford evidence that improper purposes are\n\nplaying a role”).\n\n       In sum, even if none of the reasons discussed above alone would be sufficient for the\n\nCourt to conclude that Plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their Fifth Amendment claim, taken\n\n\n\n                                                68\n\ftogether they are highly suggestive of a constitutional violation. The likelihood of success factor\n\naccordingly weighs in favor of granting preliminary injunctive relief. For the same reasons, the\n\nCourt will deny Defendants’ motion to dismiss Plaintiffs’ claims under the Due Process Clause.\n\n        Defendants make a few additional points regarding the merits of Plaintiffs’ claims that\n\nmust be addressed. First, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs cannot demonstrate a likelihood of\n\nsuccess on the merits regarding the Presidential Memorandum’s policy for enlisted service\n\nmembers in particular because Secretary Mattis’ Interim Guidance is the “operative policy,” and\n\nthat guidance “does not impermissibly classify service members based on transgender status, but\n\nrather prohibits disparate treatment of existing service members based on transgender status.”\n\nDefs.’ Mem. at 24. This may be true, but the focus of Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint is not the\n\nInterim Guidance, but the Presidential Memorandum. The Accession and Retention Directives\n\nof the Presidential Memorandum require the return to a policy that “generally prohibit[s] openly\n\ntransgender individuals from accession into the United States military and authorize[s] the\n\ndischarge of such individuals.” Presidential Memorandum § 1(a). This overt disparate\n\ntreatment, which will become effective when Secretary Mattis’ Interim Guidance elapses early\n\nnext year, is the subject of Plaintiffs’ lawsuit.\n\n        Second, Defendants cite a number of cases for the proposition that the Presidential\n\nMemorandum “is subject to a highly deferential form of review.” Defs.’ Mem. at 27. The Court\n\nhas reviewed those cases and determined that none of them require the Court to apply a different\n\nlevel of scrutiny than has been applied here. Of primary importance is the Supreme Court’s\n\nopinion in Rostker v. Goldberg, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110548\"><a href=\"/opinion/110548/rostker-v-goldberg/\"><span class=\"volume\">453</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">57</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1981). The Supreme Court in Rostker expressly\n\ndeclined to hold that the intermediate scrutiny applicable to gender discrimination did not apply\n\nin the military personnel context. Id. at 69. Instead, the Court reviewed the particular facts\n\n\n\n                                                    69\n\fbefore it and found that the district court in that case had not sufficiently deferred to the reasoned\n\ndecision of Congress in the context of a particular military personnel-related decision.\n\n       The facts of that case are strikingly different than those presented here. In Rostker, the\n\nCourt noted that “Congress did not act unthinkingly or reflexively and not for any considered\n\nreason,” when it passed the challenged policy. Id. at 72 (internal quotations omitted). To the\n\ncontrary, the Court noted Congress’ “studied choice of one alternative in preference to another,”\n\nand relied on the fact that the policy at issue in that case had been “extensively considered by\n\nCongress in hearings, floor debate, and in committee.” Id. In other words, Congress had\n\nreceived extensive evidence on the issue, and simply chose one of two competing alternatives.\n\nThe Supreme Court found that “[t]he District Court was quite wrong in undertaking an\n\nindependent evaluation of this evidence, rather than adopting an appropriately deferential\n\nexamination of Congress’ evaluation of that evidence.” Id. at 82-83.\n\n       The study and evaluation of evidence that the Rostker Court found warranted judicial\n\ndeference is completely absent from the current record. Contrary to Defendants’ assertion, this\n\ndoes not appear to be a case where the Court is required to pick sides in a “battle of experts.”\n\nDefs.’ Mem. at 32. To the contrary, the record at this stage of the case shows that the reasons\n\noffered for categorically excluding transgender individuals were not supported and were in fact\n\ncontradicted by the only military judgment available at the time. Accordingly, unlike the district\n\ncourt in Rostker, the Court’s analysis in this Opinion has not been based on an independent\n\nevaluation of evidence or faulting of the President for choosing between two alternatives based\n\non competing evidence.\n\n       Third, Defendants seem to argue that they are free of the obligation of rationalizing the\n\nAccession and Retention Directives because the directives are a mere continuation of a long-\n\n\n\n                                                 70\n\fstanding policy. This is false. The Accession and Retention Directives constituted a revocation\n\nfrom transgender people of rights they were previously given. Before the Accession and\n\nRetention Directives, transgender people had already been given the right to serve openly and the\n\nright to accede by a date certain in early 2018. The Accession and Retention Directives took\n\nthose rights away from transgender people and transgender people only. The targeted revocation\n\nof rights from a particular class of people which they had previously enjoyed—for however short\n\na period of time—is a fundamentally different act than not giving those rights in the first place,\n\nand it will be the government’s burden in this case to show that this act was substantially related\n\nto important government objectives. See Perry v. Brown, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"622361\"><a href=\"/opinion/622361/perry-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">671</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1052</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1079-80 (9th Cir.\n\n2012), vacated and remanded sub nom.

Targeted revocations of\n\nrights are a factor that has been present in a number of cases finding equal protection violations.\n\nSee Romer, 517 U.S. at 627 (holding that law that “withdr[ew] from homosexuals, but no others,\n\nspecific legal protection . . . and . . . forb[ade] reinstatement of these laws and policies” was\n\nunconstitutional); Windsor, 133 S. Ct. at 2695–96 (holding that the purpose of a law that\n\n“impose[d] a disability on [a] class by refusing to acknowledge a status” previously granted was\n\nto “disparage and to injure those” in that class).\n\n       Finally, Defendants argue that the military’s previous study of transgender service cannot\n\nforever bind future administrations from looking into the issue themselves. The Court fully\n\nagrees with this point. The Court by no means suggests that it was not within the President’s\n\nauthority to order that additional studies be undertaken and that this policy be reevaluated. If the\n\n\n\n                                                     71\n\fPresident had done so and then decided that banning all transgender individuals from serving in\n\nthe military was beneficial to the various military objectives cited, this would be a different case.\n\nBut as discussed above, that is not the case before the Court. The Court can only assess\n\nPlaintiffs’ equal protection claim based on the facts before it. At this time, it appears that the\n\nrights of a class of individuals were summarily and abruptly revoked for reasons contrary to the\n\nonly then-available studies. As explained above, based on the cumulative effect of various\n\nunusual facts, the Court is convinced that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their\n\nFifth Amendment claim. This finding in no way should be interpreted to prevent Defendants\n\nfrom continuing to study issues surrounding the service of transgender individuals in the\n\nmilitary, as they have asserted that they intend to do.\n\n       The Court concludes this portion of its Memorandum Opinion with a caveat. This case\n\ncomes before the Court on Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction and Defendants’\n\nmotion to dismiss. It is accordingly still at its very earliest stages, and the record is necessarily\n\nlimited. The Court’s task at this time is to determine whether Plaintiffs have stated plausible\n\nclaims and demonstrated a likelihood—not a certainty—of success based on the present record.\n\nThe Court is persuaded that Plaintiffs have made these fairly modest showings, but this is not a\n\nfinal adjudication of the merits of Plaintiffs’ claims.\n\n       2. Irreparable Injury\n\n       Next, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have demonstrated that they would suffer irreparable\n\ninjury in the absence of preliminary injunctive relief. In order to satisfy the irreparable injury\n\nrequirement, “[f]irst, the injury ‘must be both certain and great; it must be actual and not\n\ntheoretical.’” Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches v. England, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186744\"><a href=\"/opinion/186744/chaplaincy-full-v-england-gordon-r/\"><span class=\"volume\">454</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">290</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 297 (D.C.

Defendants argue that “for much the same reasons they\n\nlack standing, Plaintiffs cannot show that they will suffer certain, great, or any actual injuries if\n\nthe Court does not enter an injunction.” Defs.’ Mem. at 21. The Court has already rejected those\n\narguments in the context of finding that Plaintiffs have standing, at least with respect to the\n\nAccession and Retention Directives, and rejects them again in this context. Absent an\n\ninjunction, Plaintiffs will suffer a number of harms that cannot be remediated after that fact even\n\nif Plaintiffs were to eventually succeed in this lawsuit. The impending ban brands and\n\nstigmatizes Plaintiffs as less capable of serving in the military, reduces their stature among their\n\npeers and officers, stunts the growth of their careers, and threatens to derail their chosen calling\n\nor access to unique educational opportunities. See Elzie v. Aspin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1508833\"><a href=\"/opinion/1508833/elzie-v-aspin/\"><span class=\"volume\">841</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Money damages or other corrective\n\nforms of relief will not be able to fully remediate these injuries once they occur. Moreover, these\n\ninjuries are also imminent, in that they are either ongoing or, at the latest, will begin when the\n\nAccession and Retention Directives take effect early next year.\n\n       These injuries are irreparable for the additional reason that they are the result of alleged\n\nviolations of Plaintiffs’ rights to equal protection of the laws under the Fifth Amendment. “It has\n\nlong been established that the loss of constitutional freedoms, ‘for even minimal periods of time,\n\nunquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.’” Mills v.

Under this line of authority, Plaintiffs’\n\nallegation of constitutional injury is sufficient to satisfy the irreparable injury requirement for\n\nissuance of a preliminary injunction.\n\n       3. Balance of Equities and Public Interest\n\n       Finally, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have shown that the public interest and the balance\n\nof hardships weigh in favor of granting injunctive relief. “A party seeking a preliminary\n\ninjunction must demonstrate both ‘that the balance of equities tips in [its] favor, and that an\n\ninjunction is in the public interest.’” FBME Bank Ltd. v.

On this\n\nrecord, there are no countervailing equities or public interest in precluding transgender service\n\nmembers from the military that outweigh those harms. Defendants argue that “[t]he public has a\n\nstrong interest in national defense.” Defs.’ Mem. at 41. They also argue that the military “is in\n\nthe process of gathering a panel of experts” to provide advice and recommendations regarding\n\n“the development and implementation of the policy on military service by transgender\n\nindividuals,” and that “[g]ranting Plaintiffs their requested relief would directly interfere with the\n\n\n\n\n                                                  74\n\fpanel’s work and the military’s ability to thoroughly study a complex and important issue\n\nregarding the composition of the armed forces.” Id. at 40–41.\n\n       Neither point passes muster. A bare invocation of “national defense” simply cannot\n\ndefeat every motion for preliminary injunction that touches on the military. On the record before\n\nthe Court, there is absolutely no support for the claim that the ongoing service of transgender\n\npeople would have any negative effective on the military at all. In fact, there is considerable\n\nevidence that it is the discharge and banning of such individuals that would have such effects.\n\nThe Court also notes that fifteen States have filed an amici brief indicating that they and their\n\nresidents will be harmed by the Presidential Memorandum if it is not enjoined. See State Amici\n\nBrief at 13-22. Moreover, the injunction that will be issued will in no way prevent the\n\ngovernment from conducting studies or gathering advice or recommendations on transgender\n\nservice. The balance of equities and public interest accordingly weigh in favor of granting\n\nPlaintiffs’ motion.\n\n                                       IV. CONCLUSION\n\n       For the reasons set out above, the Court will GRANT-IN-PART and DENY-IN-PART\n\nDefendants’ Motion to Dismiss and GRANT-IN-PART and DENY-IN-PART Plaintiffs’ Motion\n\nfor Preliminary Injunction. The Court will grant Defendants’ motion to dismiss Plaintiffs’\n\nclaims to the extent they are based on the Sex Reassignment Surgery Directive, as well as\n\nPlaintiffs’ estoppel claim. Defendants’ motion to dismiss is DENIED in all other respects.\n\nPlaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction is DENIED with respect to the Sex Reassignment\n\nSurgery Directive.
