Judicial Watch claims that DHS violated the\n\nFreedom of Information Act (FOIA) by unlawfully withholding certain records pertaining to the\n\nSeptember 11th hijacker, Mohamed Atta. Having reviewed the materials submitted by the parties\n\nand the balance of the record, the Court grants Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment and\n\ndenies Plaintiff’s Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment. The reasoning for the Court’s decision\n\nis set forth below.\n\n\n\n\n                                             1\n\f                                        BACKGROUND\n\n        On September 19, 2012, Judicial Watch submitted a FOIA request to the United States\n\nCitizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”), a component of DHS, for records pertaining to\n\nMohamed Atta. Eggleston Decl. [19-1] at 3. Judicial Watch specifically requested the following:\n\n        1. Any and all records concerning, regarding, or relating to the above mentioned\n        Mohamed Atta;\n        2. Any and all of the following forms completed by or related to the above-\n        identified Mohammed Atta:\n                a. I-94 forms;\n                b. I-130 forms;\n                c. I-131 forms;\n                d. I-129 forms;\n                e. I-539 forms; and\n                f. I-20 forms noting transfer of a B-2/B-1 visa;\n        3. Any records of applications the above-identified Mohamed Atta filed in\n        attendance schools including but not limited to flight schools and academies;\n        4. Any and all passports issued to the above-identified Mohamed Atta; and\n        5. Any and all records of the above-identified Mohamed Atta passport\n        applications;\n        6. Any and all records of a passport issued to the above-identified Mohamed Atta\n        to the Conch Republic.\n\nId. at 3-4.\n\n        On October 18, 2012, at the direction of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”),\n\nUSCIS denied Judicial Watch’s request and withheld the records in full under the exemption\n\nfound in 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(A) (hereinafter “Exemption 7(A)”) for law enforcement records\n\nthat could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings. Attach. B to Ex. 1.\n\nJudicial Watch filed an administrative appeal on November 26, 2012. Attach. C to Ex. 1. On\n\nDecember 3, 2012, USCIS notified Judicial Watch that it had affirmed the decision to withhold\n\nthe records in full and that Judicial Watch could seek judicial review of the action under 5 U.S.C.\n\n§ 552(a)(4)(b). Attach. D to Ex. 1.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 2\n\f        On December 17, 2012, Judicial Watch filed the instant Complaint [1], alleging that DHS\n\nunlawfully withheld public records requested in violation of FOIA, and that Judicial Watch “will\n\ncontinue to be irreparably harmed unless [DHS] is compelled to conform its conduct to the\n\nrequirements of the law.” Compl. ¶ 12. Judicial Watch requests that the Court order DHS to\n\nconduct an adequate search for records responsive to Judicial Watch’s FOIA request, produce all\n\nnon-exempt records responsive to Judicial Watch’s FOIA request, and produce a Vaughn Index 1\n\nof any responsive records withheld pursuant to a FOIA exemption. Id. ¶ 13.\n\n        Shortly after Judicial Watch filed its Complaint, the FBI informed USCIS that the law\n\nenforcement investigation into the attacks was ongoing and identified specific records that\n\nUSCIS should continue to withhold “because they are compiled in the FBI’s ongoing law\n\nenforcement investigation into the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, and related law\n\nenforcement proceedings.” Eggleston Decl. at 5. The FBI also identified a portion of the records\n\nthat could be released, and USCIS released nine heavily redacted pages to Judicial Watch on or\n\nabout August 16, 2013. 2 Id.\n\n        On September 13, 2013, DHS filed a motion for summary judgment, asserting that it (1)\n\nconducted an adequate search, (2) produced all reasonably segregable information from the\n\nrecords responsive to Judicial Watch’s FOIA request, and (3) properly withheld information\n\npursuant to FOIA Exemption 7(A). 3 Def.’s Mot. at 8-13.\n\n        In support of its arguments, DHS submitted (1) a declaration from Jill Eggleston, the\n\nAssistant Center Director in the FOIA Unit of USCIS, (2) a declaration from David Hardy,\n\nSection Chief of the Record/Information Dissemination Section, Record Management Division\n\n1\n  A Vaughn Index is a detailed account of withheld documents and the justifications for the withholdings. See\nVaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820, 827 (D.C. Cir. 1973).\n2\n  Judicial Watch claims DHS produced the documents on August 23, 2013. Pl.’s Cross-Mot. at 3.\n3\n  Alternatively, DHS asserts that it properly withheld information pursuant to the exemptions in 5 U.S.C. §\n552(b)(6), 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(C), and 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(E). Id. at 13.\n\n                                                         3\n\fof the FBI, and (3) a Vaughn Index, which describes the records responsive to Judicial Watch’s\n\nFOIA request and the exemption asserted for each of the withheld documents. See Eggleston\n\nDecl.; Hardy Decl.; Vaughn Index [19-1] at 1.\n\n       On October 21, 2013, Judicial Watch filed a cross-motion for summary judgment,\n\nasserting that DHS has not established that it properly identified and withheld the responsive\n\ndocuments. Pl.’s Cross-Mot. at 5. Specifically, Judicial Watch claims that (1) DHS performed an\n\ninadequate search, or alternatively, that DHS produced an inadequate Vaughn Index, and (2)\n\nDHS did not satisfy its burden of proof under Exemptions 7(A) and 7(E). Id. at 5, 9.\n\n                                     LEGAL STANDARD\n\n       The purpose of the FOIA is to “ensure an informed citizenry, vital to the functioning of a\n\ndemocratic society.” Critical Mass Energy Product v. Nuclear Regulatory Comm’n, 975 F.2d\n\n871, 872 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (citing F.B.I. v. Abramson, 456 U.S. 615, 621 (1982)). As such, the\n\nFOIA allows public access to official information by requiring federal agencies to release all\n\nrecords responsive to a request for production. Nat’l Sec. Counselors v. C.I.A., 960 F. Supp. 2d\n\n101, 131 (D.D.C. 2013) (citing 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(3)(A)). This mandate is subject to nine\n\nexemptions, which are aimed at protecting “legitimate governmental and private interests [that]\n\ncould be harmed by release of certain types of information . . . .” Abramson, 456 U.S. at 621; see\n\n5. U.S.C. § 552(b). The nine exemptions are “construed narrowly in keeping with [the] FOIA’s\n\npresumption in favor of disclosure.” Vaughn, 484 F.2d at 823.\n\n       The majority of FOIA cases can be resolved on summary judgment. Brayton v. Office of\n\nthe U.S. Trade Representative, 641 F.3d 521, 527 (D.C. Cir. 2011). A defendant agency that\n\nseeks summary judgment in a FOIA case must demonstrate that no material facts are in dispute,\n\n“even when the underlying facts are viewed in the light most favorable to the requester.”\n\n\n\n                                                4\n\fWeisberg v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 705 F.2d 1344, 1350 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (citing Weisberg v. U.S.\n\nDep’t of Justice, 627 F.2d 365, 358 (D.C. Cir. 1980)); see Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The agency must\n\nalso demonstrate that (1) “it has conducted an adequate search for responsive records,” and (2)\n\n“each responsive record that it has located has been produced to the plaintiff or is exempt from\n\ndisclosure.” Nat’l Whistleblower Ctr. v. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., 849 F. Supp. 2d 13,\n\n21-22 (D.D.C. 2012). In addition, the agency must produce “[a]ny reasonably segregable portion\n\nof a record after deletion of the portions which are exempt under [Exemption 7].” 5 U.S.C. §\n\n552(b)(7) (2006).\n\n       A. Legal Standard for Adequacy of a Search\n\n       Where a plaintiff challenges the adequacy of an agency’s search, the agency “must show\n\nbeyond material doubt . . . that it has conducted a search reasonably calculated to uncover all\n\nrelevant documents.” Weisberg, 705 F.2d at 1351. Whether the search was reasonable is\n\ndependent upon the circumstances of the case. Id.; see also Meeropol v. Meese, 790 F.2d 942,\n\n956 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (“[A]dequacy is measured by the reasonableness of the effort in light of the\n\nspecific request.”). To demonstrate the adequacy of the search, an agency may rely solely on “a\n\nreasonably detailed affidavit [or declaration], setting forth the search terms and the type of search\n\nperformed, and averring that all files likely to contain responsive materials (if such records exist)\n\nwere searched.” Valencia-Lucena v. U.S. Coast Guard, 180 F.3d 321, 326 (D.C. Cir. 1999)\n\n(quoting Oglesby v. U.S. Dep’t of Army, 920 F.2d 57, 68 (D.C. Cir. 1990)). A court must give\n\nsubstantial weight to an agency’s affidavits, and the presumption of good faith accorded to such\n\naffidavits “cannot be rebutted by purely speculative claims about the existence and\n\ndiscoverability of other documents.” Nat’l Whistleblower Ctr., 849 F. Supp. 2d at 22 (quoting\n\n\n\n\n                                                 5\n\fSafeCard Servs., Inc. v. Sec. & Exch. Comm’n, 926 F.2d 1197, 1200 (D.C. Cir. 1991)) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).\n\n       B. Legal Standard for Withholding Pursuant to an Exemption\n\n       Where a plaintiff challenges an agency’s withholding, “the burden is on [the agency] to\n\nestablish [its] right to withhold information from the public . . . .” Coastal States Gas Corp. v.\n\nDep’t of Energy, 617 F.2d 854, 861 (D.C. Cir. 1980). A defendant agency may meet this burden\n\n“by providing the requester with a Vaughn [I]ndex, adequately describing each withheld\n\ndocument and explaining the exemption’s relevance.” Elec. Privacy Info. Ctr. v. Dep’t of\n\nHomeland Sec., 384 F. Supp. 2d 100, 106 (D.D.C. 2005) (citing Summers v. Dep’t of Justice, 140\n\nF.3d 1077, 1080 (D.C. Cir. 1998)). An agency may rely on affidavits in a Vaughn Index to\n\nestablish that a withholding is proper, provided that the affidavits: (1) “describe the documents\n\nand the justifications for nondisclosure with reasonably specific detail,” (2) “demonstrate that the\n\ninformation withheld logically falls within the claimed exemption,” and (3) “are not controverted\n\nby either contrary evidence in the record nor by evidence of agency bad faith.” Elect. Privacy\n\nInfo. Ctr., 384 F. Supp. 2d at 106 (quoting Military Audit Project v. Casey, 656 F.2d 724, 738\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1981)). In assessing the adequacy of a Vaughn Index, a court will “focus on the\n\nfunctions of the Vaughn Index, not the length of the document descriptions,” and will find it\n\nsufficient “so long as [it] give[s] the reviewing court a reasonable basis to evaluate the claim of\n\nprivilege.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Food & Drug Admin., 449 F.3d 141, 146 (D.C. Cir. 2006). An\n\nagency “is not required to provide so much detail that the exempt material would be effectively\n\ndisclosed.” Johnson v. Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys, 310 F.3d 771, 776 (D.C. Cir. 2002)\n\n(citing Mead Data Cent., Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Air Force, 566 F.2d 242, 261 (D.C. Cir. 1977)).\n\nWith regard to Exemption 7 specifically, “[a law enforcement agency’s] decision to invoke\n\n\n\n                                                 6\n\f[E]xemption 7 is entitled to deference.” Campbell v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 164 F.3d 20, 32 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1998).\n\n                                                    ANALYSIS\n\n         A. Adequacy of the Search\n\n         1. In General\n\n         As previously noted, in order to prevail on a summary judgment motion, an agency must\n\nshow that it conducted a search reasonably calculated to locate records responsive to the FOIA\n\nrequest. See Nat’l Whistleblower Ctr., 849 F. Supp. 2d at 21-22. Judicial Watch contends that\n\nmaterial doubt exists as to whether DHS conducted a search reasonably calculated to uncover\n\nspecific primary immigration records that were requested “because Defendant’s response does\n\nnot specifically address or identify any . . . individual records 4 in its motion and declarations.”\n\nPl.’s Cross-Mot. at 6.\n\n         The declaration by Jill Eggleston of the USCIS FOIA Unit, which DHS filed in support\n\nof its motion, is sufficient on its own to establish that the search was adequate, as it is reasonably\n\ndetailed, states the search terms and type of search performed, and avers that all potentially\n\nresponsive files were located and searched. Eggleston Decl.; see Valencia-Lucena, 180 F.3d at\n\n326. The declaration attests that USCIS employees determined that the relevant records would be\n\nlocated within the program offices for Fraud Detection and National Security, Service Center\n\nOperations, and the Field Office Directorate. Id. ¶ 22. Eggleston states that USCIS then directed\n\nstaff within those offices to search for the appropriate documents, and the employees within each\n\nof these offices utilized “a variety of DHS computer databases that store records and data\n\nrelating to the processing of immigration benefits and petitions, including the Interagency Border\n\n\n4\n The records at issue are applications filed in attendance schools, passports, passport applications, and forms I-94, I-\n130, I-131, I-129, I-539, and I-20. Attach. A to Ex. 1 at 2.\n\n                                                           7\n\fInspection System (IBIS), Computer Linked Application Information Management System\n\n(CLAIMS), Central Index System (CIS), National File Tracking System (NFTS), and the Person\n\nCentric Query System (PCQS).” Id. She adds that the employees also searched “their personal\n\nrecords for paper documents, as well as any personal electronic databases, including computer\n\nhard drives, shared folders, and email archives.” Id. Eggleston also provides the specific search\n\nterms used by USCIS employees to conduct the search, including “the records’ subject’s name,\n\ndate of birth, place of birth, and the subject’s application receipt number.” Id.\n\n       2. The Three Publicly Released Documents\n\n       Judicial Watch also takes issue with the failure of DHS to identify and produce certain\n\ndocuments pertaining to Atta that had previously been made public by the 9-11 Commission,\n\nspecifically an I-94 form, notes from an INS official, and a B1/B2 Five Year Visa. Pl.’s Cross-\n\nMot. at 6. Judicial Watch claims that “the absence of any discussion by [DHS] in the record of\n\nthese specific documents is a material indication that the search was insufficient, and if the\n\nrecords are indeed within the responsive documents, [DHS] has inadequately identified them in\n\nits Vaughn Index and declarations.” Id. at 6-7.\n\n       This claim is unpersuasive. First, the record does not demonstrate that the documents\n\nwere in the custody and control of USCIS at the time of the FOIA request. See Def.’s Mot. at 3\n\n(“Plaintiff’s reference to the general existence of three documents . . . is not evidence that the\n\nthree documents were in USCIS’ custody and control at the time of Plaintiff’s FOIA request.”);\n\nKissinger v. Reporters Comm. for Freedom of the Press, 445 U.S. 136, 151 (1980) (“agency\n\npossession or control is prerequisite to triggering any duties under the FOIA”). The Eggleston\n\nDeclaration expressly references the specific immigration forms sought by Judicial Watch and\n\nprovides a detailed description of the search procedures that USCIS undertook based on the\n\n\n\n                                                  8\n\finformation requested. Eggleston Decl. at 4-6. Moreover, the records in question were created\n\nunder USCIS’s predecessor agency, Immigration and Naturalization Services (“INS”), which\n\nwas under the Department of Justice, rather than the Department of Homeland Security. Hardy\n\nDecl. at 7. Because the records from INS were distributed among USCIS, Customs and Border\n\nProtection (“CBP”), and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”), Id., it cannot be\n\nassumed that the records were in the custody and control of USCIS at the time of the FOIA\n\nrequest. See Kissinger, 445 U.S. at 151 (“The guidelines state that FOIA refers . . . only to\n\nrecords in being and in the possession or control of an agency . . . . [It] imposes no obligation to\n\ncompile or procure a record in response to a request.”) (quoting Attorney General’s\n\nMemorandum on the Public Information Section of the Administrative Procedure Act 23-24\n\n(June 1967), Source Book I, pp. 222-23) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n       Second, “it is long settled that the failure of an agency to turn up one specific document\n\nin its search does not alone render a search inadequate . . . [because] a reasonable and thorough\n\nsearch may have missed [it].” Iturralde v. Comptroller of Currency, 315 F.3d 311, 315 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2003) (citing Nation Magazine, Washington Bureau v. U.S. Customs Serv., 71 F.3d 885, 896 n.7\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1995)); see also Jennings v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 230 F. App’x 1 (D.C. Cir. 2007)\n\n(“the adequacy of a FOIA search is generally determined not by the fruits of the search but by\n\nthe appropriateness of the methods used to carry out the search”) (quoting Iturralde, 315 F.3d at\n\n315); Mobley v. C.I.A., 924 F. Supp. 2d 24, 36 (D.D.C. 2013) (“The question is not whether there\n\nmight exist any other documents possibly responsive to the request, but rather whether the\n\nsearch for those documents was adequate.”) (quoting Steinberg v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 23 F.3d\n\n548, 551 (D.C. Cir. 1994)). Consequently, even if USCIS had the documents in its possession, its\n\n\n\n\n                                                 9\n\ffailure to produce them as part of Judicial Watch’s FOIA request does not alone render the\n\nsearch inadequate.\n\n        DHS submitted an affidavit describing the search with specificity. Judicial Watch does\n\nnot allege that USCIS failed to search a particular location that was likely to contain the specific\n\nrecords sought, but rather assumes USCIS had the records in its custody. That is insufficient to\n\ncreate a “material doubt” as to whether USCIS “conducted a search reasonably calculated to\n\nuncover all relevant documents.” Weisberg, 705 F.2d at 1351; see also Iturralde, 315 F.3d at 315\n\n(holding that although a court may place significant weight on the absence of a particular\n\ndocument, the plaintiff could not overcome an adequate agency affidavit without demonstrating\n\nthat the defendant “refused to interview government officials for whom there was strong\n\nevidence that they might have been helpful,” “failed to search particular offices or files where the\n\ndocument might well have been found,” or “ignored indications in documents found in its initial\n\nsearch that there were additional responsive documents elsewhere”) (citing Valencia-Lucena,\n\n180 F.3d at 327-28; Campbell, 164 F.3d at 28). 5\n\n        B. Documents Withheld under Exemption 7(A) 6\n\n        Exemption 7(A) protects from disclosure certain “records or information compiled for\n\nlaw enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production of such law enforcement\n\nrecords or information could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings.”\n\n5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(A). To justify a withholding under Exemption 7(A), an agency must\n\ndemonstrate that (1) “a law enforcement proceeding is pending or prospective,” and (2) “release\n\nof the information could reasonably be expected to cause some articulable harm to the\n\n5\n  Although DHS’s affidavit demonstrates that the agency has conducted an adequate search, it would have been\npreferable for there to have been an explanation from DHS as to why the three documents are missing from the\nproduction of documents produced.\n6\n  Because the documents in question are exempt under 7(A), the Court need not address Defendant’s claims that the\nwithheld documents are also covered by FOIA Exemptions 6, 7(C), and 7(E).\n\n                                                       10\n\fproceeding.” Voinche v. F.B.I., 46 F. Supp. 2d 26, 31 (D.D.C. 1999). There need not be a\n\n“presently pending enforcement proceeding,” but instead, “it is sufficient that the government’s\n\nongoing . . . investigation is likely to lead to [enforcement] proceedings.” Ctr. for Nat. Sec.\n\nStudies v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 331 F.3d 918, 926 (D.C. Cir. 2003). Courts owe “some measure\n\nof deference to the [E]xecutive in cases implicating national security, a uniquely executive\n\npurview.” Id. at 926-927; see also Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 696 (2001) (finding that\n\nterrorism or other special circumstances might warrant “heightened deference to the judgments\n\nof the political branches with respect to matters of national security”).\n\n       According to the Hardy Declaration, “responsive records are contained in files pertaining\n\nto the FBI’s investigation of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.” Hardy Decl. ¶ 8. Hardy\n\nfurther asserts that “[t]he investigation is ongoing and clearly within the law enforcement duties\n\nof the FBI to detect and undertake investigations into possible violations of Federal criminal and\n\nnational security laws.” Id. (citing 28 U.S.C. § 533). He asserts that the records in question were\n\ncompiled for law enforcement purposes and “readily meet the threshold for applying FOIA\n\nExemption 7.” Id. Hardy concludes that “[t]he FBI has determined that disclosure of any of the\n\nspecified responsive records in the midst of this active, on-going investigation is reasonably\n\nexpected to interfere with that investigation as well as any resulting prosecutions.” Id. ¶ 10.\n\n       Judicial Watch claims that DHS “has not provided . . . a particularized explanation of\n\nhow disclosing primary immigration documents . . . could be reasonably expected to interfere\n\nwith any ongoing law enforcement investigations . . . .” Pl.’s Cross-Mot. at 10. Judicial Watch\n\nfurther claims that because the records in question involve an individual who died over twelve\n\nyears ago, the FBI’s reliance on a “generally stated ongoing investigation into the September 11,\n\n\n\n\n                                                 11\n\f2001 terrorist attacks” is “broad and vague” and therefore insufficient for purposes of Exemption\n\n7(A). Id. at 11 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n       In light of the deference owed to the agency, Campbell, 164 F.3d at 32, the Court\n\nconcludes that DHS properly withheld the documents. The Hardy Declaration demonstrates that\n\nthe information in question is part of an ongoing investigation into the September 11, 2001\n\nterrorist attacks, which may lead to future law enforcement proceedings, and that the FBI\n\ndetermined that disclosure of any of the records in question in the midst of the ongoing\n\ninvestigation is reasonably expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings. Hardy Decl. ¶ 8.\n\nHardy explains that “[p]roviding a detailed description of the material within these specific\n\nUSCIS records concerning Mohamed Atta would undermine the very interests that USCIS and\n\nFBI seek to protect under Exemption 7(A).” Id. at 7.\n\n       Furthermore, Exemption 7(A) applies to “multiple intermingled investigations,” Cucci v.\n\nDrug Enforcement Admin., 871 F. Supp. 508, 512 (D.D.C. 1994), so the fact that Atta is dead, as\n\nJudicial Watch repeatedly points out, does not render the exemption irrelevant, because the\n\ninvestigation into the 9-11 attacks is still ongoing. See N.L.R.B. v. Robbins Tire & Rubber Co.,\n\n437 U.S. 214, 236 (1978) (“disclosure of particular kinds of investigatory records while a case is\n\npending would generally interfere with enforcement proceedings.”) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).\n\n       C. Adequacy of the Vaughn Index\n\n       A defendant agency may prevail on summary judgment by producing a Vaughn Index\n\ndetailing the responsive records and reasons for their withholding, if applicable. See Elec.\n\nPrivacy Info. Ctr., 384 F. Supp. 2d at 106. Judicial Watch contends that there is material doubt as\n\nto the adequacy of the Vaughn Index because DHS did not correlate the claimed exemption with\n\n\n\n                                                12\n\fparticular records or parts of records to which the exemption applies.

Cir. 1987) (“Specificity is the\n\ndefining requirement of the Vaughn Index and affidavit; affidavits cannot support summary\n\njudgment if they are conclusory, merely reciting statutory standards, or if they are too vague or\n\nsweeping.”) (internal citation omitted)). Instead, DHS grouped responsive documents into four\n\nbroad categories: “memoranda,” “emails,” “database searches,” and “other investigative\n\ndocuments.” Hardy Decl. ¶¶ 12-15.\n\n       The Vaughn Index is sufficient. This Circuit has held that “[b]ecause generic\n\ndeterminations are permitted, the government need not justify its withholdings document-by-\n\ndocument; it may instead do so category-of-document by category-of-document.” Crooker v.\n\nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms, 789 F.2d 64, 67 (D.C. Cir. 1986); see also Judicial\n\nWatch, Inc., 449 F.3d at 147 (“[The court has] never required repetitive, detailed explanations for\n\neach piece of withheld information–that is, codes and categories may be sufficiently\n\nparticularized to carry the agency’s burden of proof.”). Furthermore, because courts owe\n\n“substantial weight to . . . agency explanations in the national security context,” King, 830 F.2d\n\nat 236, and DHS claims that “providing a detailed description of the material within these\n\nspecific DHS records concerning Mohamed Atta would undermine the very interests that the FBI\n\nseeks to protect under Exemption 7(A),” Hardy Decl. at 7, DHS’s grouping of the withheld\n\ndocuments into four general categories satisfies the requirement under 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(A).\n\nSee Johnson, 310 F.3d at 776 (an agency is not required to provide so much detail that the\n\nexempt material would be effectively disclosed).\n\n                                        CONCLUSION\n\n\n\n\n                                                13\n\f       For the reasons set forth above, Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment is\n\nGRANTED and Plaintiff’s Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED.

On\n\nDecember 3, 2012, USCIS notified Judicial Watch that it had affirmed the decision to withhold\n\nthe records in full and that Judicial Watch could seek judicial review of the action under 5 U.S.C.\n\n§ 552(a)(4)(b).

Judicial Watch requests that the Court order DHS to\n\nconduct an adequate search for records responsive to Judicial Watch’s FOIA request, produce all\n\nnon-exempt records responsive to Judicial Watch’s FOIA request, and produce a Vaughn Index 1\n\nof any responsive records withheld pursuant to a FOIA exemption. Id. ¶ 13.\n\n        Shortly after Judicial Watch filed its Complaint, the FBI informed USCIS that the law\n\nenforcement investigation into the attacks was ongoing and identified specific records that\n\nUSCIS should continue to withhold “because they are compiled in the FBI’s ongoing law\n\nenforcement investigation into the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, and related law\n\nenforcement proceedings.” Eggleston Decl. at 5. The FBI also identified a portion of the records\n\nthat could be released, and USCIS released nine heavily redacted pages to Judicial Watch on or\n\nabout August 16, 2013. 2 Id.\n\n        On September 13, 2013, DHS filed a motion for summary judgment, asserting that it (1)\n\nconducted an adequate search, (2) produced all reasonably segregable information from the\n\nrecords responsive to Judicial Watch’s FOIA request, and (3) properly withheld information\n\npursuant to FOIA Exemption 7(A). 3 Def.’s Mot. at 8-13.\n\n        In support of its arguments, DHS submitted (1) a declaration from Jill Eggleston, the\n\nAssistant Center Director in the FOIA Unit of USCIS, (2) a declaration from David Hardy,\n\nSection Chief of the Record/Information Dissemination Section, Record Management Division\n\n1\n  A Vaughn Index is a detailed account of withheld documents and the justifications for the withholdings.

Adequacy of the Search\n\n         1. In General\n\n         As previously noted, in order to prevail on a summary judgment motion, an agency must\n\nshow that it conducted a search reasonably calculated to locate records responsive to the FOIA\n\nrequest. See Nat’l Whistleblower Ctr., 849 F. Supp. 2d at 21-22. Judicial Watch contends that\n\nmaterial doubt exists as to whether DHS conducted a search reasonably calculated to uncover\n\nspecific primary immigration records that were requested “because Defendant’s response does\n\nnot specifically address or identify any . . . individual records 4 in its motion and declarations.”\n\nPl.’s Cross-Mot. at 6.\n\n         The declaration by Jill Eggleston of the USCIS FOIA Unit, which DHS filed in support\n\nof its motion, is sufficient on its own to establish that the search was adequate, as it is reasonably\n\ndetailed, states the search terms and type of search performed, and avers that all potentially\n\nresponsive files were located and searched. Eggleston Decl.; see Valencia-Lucena, 180 F.3d at\n\n326. The declaration attests that USCIS employees determined that the relevant records would be\n\nlocated within the program offices for Fraud Detection and National Security, Service Center\n\nOperations, and the Field Office Directorate. Id. ¶ 22. Eggleston states that USCIS then directed\n\nstaff within those offices to search for the appropriate documents, and the employees within each\n\nof these offices utilized “a variety of DHS computer databases that store records and data\n\nrelating to the processing of immigration benefits and petitions, including the Interagency Border\n\n\n4\n The records at issue are applications filed in attendance schools, passports, passport applications, and forms I-94, I-\n130, I-131, I-129, I-539, and I-20. Attach. A to Ex. 1 at 2.\n\n                                                           7\n\fInspection System (IBIS), Computer Linked Application Information Management System\n\n(CLAIMS), Central Index System (CIS), National File Tracking System (NFTS), and the Person\n\nCentric Query System (PCQS).” Id. She adds that the employees also searched “their personal\n\nrecords for paper documents, as well as any personal electronic databases, including computer\n\nhard drives, shared folders, and email archives.” Id. Eggleston also provides the specific search\n\nterms used by USCIS employees to conduct the search, including “the records’ subject’s name,\n\ndate of birth, place of birth, and the subject’s application receipt number.” Id.\n\n       2. The Three Publicly Released Documents\n\n       Judicial Watch also takes issue with the failure of DHS to identify and produce certain\n\ndocuments pertaining to Atta that had previously been made public by the 9-11 Commission,\n\nspecifically an I-94 form, notes from an INS official, and a B1/B2 Five Year Visa. Pl.’s Cross-\n\nMot. at 6. Judicial Watch claims that “the absence of any discussion by [DHS] in the record of\n\nthese specific documents is a material indication that the search was insufficient, and if the\n\nrecords are indeed within the responsive documents, [DHS] has inadequately identified them in\n\nits Vaughn Index and declarations.” Id. at 6-7.\n\n       This claim is unpersuasive. First, the record does not demonstrate that the documents\n\nwere in the custody and control of USCIS at the time of the FOIA request. See Def.’s Mot. at 3\n\n(“Plaintiff’s reference to the general existence of three documents . . . is not evidence that the\n\nthree documents were in USCIS’ custody and control at the time of Plaintiff’s FOIA request.”);\n\nKissinger v.

The Eggleston\n\nDeclaration expressly references the specific immigration forms sought by Judicial Watch and\n\nprovides a detailed description of the search procedures that USCIS undertook based on the\n\n\n\n                                                  8\n\finformation requested. Eggleston Decl. at 4-6. Moreover, the records in question were created\n\nunder USCIS’s predecessor agency, Immigration and Naturalization Services (“INS”), which\n\nwas under the Department of Justice, rather than the Department of Homeland Security. Hardy\n\nDecl. at 7. Because the records from INS were distributed among USCIS, Customs and Border\n\nProtection (“CBP”), and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”), Id., it cannot be\n\nassumed that the records were in the custody and control of USCIS at the time of the FOIA\n\nrequest. See Kissinger, 445 U.S. at 151 (“The guidelines state that FOIA refers . . . only to\n\nrecords in being and in the possession or control of an agency . . . . [It] imposes no obligation to\n\ncompile or procure a record in response to a request.”) (quoting Attorney General’s\n\nMemorandum on the Public Information Section of the Administrative Procedure Act 23-24\n\n(June 1967), Source Book I, pp. 222-23) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n       Second, “it is long settled that the failure of an agency to turn up one specific document\n\nin its search does not alone render a search inadequate . . .

Judicial Watch does\n\nnot allege that USCIS failed to search a particular location that was likely to contain the specific\n\nrecords sought, but rather assumes USCIS had the records in its custody. That is insufficient to\n\ncreate a “material doubt” as to whether USCIS “conducted a search reasonably calculated to\n\nuncover all relevant documents.” Weisberg, 705 F.2d at 1351; see also Iturralde, 315 F.3d at 315\n\n(holding that although a court may place significant weight on the absence of a particular\n\ndocument, the plaintiff could not overcome an adequate agency affidavit without demonstrating\n\nthat the defendant “refused to interview government officials for whom there was strong\n\nevidence that they might have been helpful,” “failed to search particular offices or files where the\n\ndocument might well have been found,” or “ignored indications in documents found in its initial\n\nsearch that there were additional responsive documents elsewhere”) (citing Valencia-Lucena,\n\n180 F.3d at 327-28; Campbell, 164 F.3d at 28). 5\n\n        B.

Hardy\n\nfurther asserts that “[t]he investigation is ongoing and clearly within the law enforcement duties\n\nof the FBI to detect and undertake investigations into possible violations of Federal criminal and\n\nnational security laws.” Id. (citing 28 U.S.C. § 533). He asserts that the records in question were\n\ncompiled for law enforcement purposes and “readily meet the threshold for applying FOIA\n\nExemption 7.” Id. Hardy concludes that “[t]he FBI has determined that disclosure of any of the\n\nspecified responsive records in the midst of this active, on-going investigation is reasonably\n\nexpected to interfere with that investigation as well as any resulting prosecutions.” Id. ¶ 10.\n\n       Judicial Watch claims that DHS “has not provided . . . a particularized explanation of\n\nhow disclosing primary immigration documents . . . could be reasonably expected to interfere\n\nwith any ongoing law enforcement investigations . . . .” Pl.’s Cross-Mot. at 10. Judicial Watch\n\nfurther claims that because the records in question involve an individual who died over twelve\n\nyears ago, the FBI’s reliance on a “generally stated ongoing investigation into the September 11,\n\n\n\n\n                                                 11\n\f2001 terrorist attacks” is “broad and vague” and therefore insufficient for purposes of Exemption\n\n7(A). Id. at 11 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n       In light of the deference owed to the agency, Campbell, 164 F.3d at 32, the Court\n\nconcludes that DHS properly withheld the documents. The Hardy Declaration demonstrates that\n\nthe information in question is part of an ongoing investigation into the September 11, 2001\n\nterrorist attacks, which may lead to future law enforcement proceedings, and that the FBI\n\ndetermined that disclosure of any of the records in question in the midst of the ongoing\n\ninvestigation is reasonably expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings. Hardy Decl. ¶ 8.\n\nHardy explains that “[p]roviding a detailed description of the material within these specific\n\nUSCIS records concerning Mohamed Atta would undermine the very interests that USCIS and\n\nFBI seek to protect under Exemption 7(A).” Id. at 7.\n\n       Furthermore, Exemption 7(A) applies to “multiple intermingled investigations,” Cucci v.\n\nDrug Enforcement Admin., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1685979\"><a href=\"/opinion/1685979/cucci-v-drug-enforcement-admin/\"><span class=\"volume\">871</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.
