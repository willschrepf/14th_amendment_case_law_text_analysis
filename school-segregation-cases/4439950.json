STATEMENT OF THE CASE\n         This is a breach of contract case involving a local Courtyard by Marriott\n\nHotel (the “Project”), located on East Ben White Boulevard, near Bergstrom\n\nInternational Airport. (CR187; App. A). 1 The foundation of the Project failed in\n\nnumerous respects and resulted in varied injuries to the property, resulting in\n\n$7,536,624.00 of claimed past, present, and future damages. (7RR48; 9RR123-\n\n124, 136; 7RR16-18, 26-39; 3RR133-136; PX-151, 16RR1-1145; 10RR29-31). As\n\nthe original owner’s successor in interest and assignee, RLJ II-C Austin Air, LP;\n\nRLJ II-C Austin Air Lessee, LP; and RLJ Lodging Fund II Acquisitions, LLC\n\n(“RLJ” collectively), 2 alleged that the general contractor, EBCO General\n\nContractor, Ltd. (the “General Contractor”), the geotechnical engineer, Terracon\n\nConsultants, Inc. (the “Soils Engineer”), and the architect, Elness, Swenson,\n\nGraham, Inc. (the “Architect”) failed to perform as specifically and individually\n\npromised in three separate and independent contracts. (CR184-218; App. A).\n\n         After the trial court entered rulings on various pre-trial motions, the only\n\nclaims being prosecuted were for breach of contract against the Architect, the\n\nGeneral Contractor, and the Soils Engineer. (CR1057-62; 1063-64; 1083-84;\n\nCR1708-1710). The Soils Engineer settled its contractual liability with RLJ before\n\n1\n  The Clerk’s Record is cited as “CR”; First Supplemental Clerk’s Record as “1SCR”; Second\nSupplemental Clerk’s Record as “2SCR”; Third Supplemental Clerk’s Record as “3SCR”.\n2\n  White Lodging Services Corporation, Inc. “assigned the contracts and causes of action in this\nlawsuit to the RLJ Plaintiffs in this case.” (CR1124; App. B.)\n\n                                              1\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\ftrial. (CR1080-81; CR1710). The General Contractor settled during trial. (7RR105-\n\n108; CR1710).3 Trial proceeded on RLJ’s breach of contract claim against the\n\nArchitect.\n\n         The jury found that the Architect “fail[ed] to comply with the Architectural\n\nContract regarding the structural engineering services required by the contract” in\n\nanswer to Question 2 (the “Structural Engineering Question”) (CR1126; App. B).\n\nThe jury then determined the amount that would reasonably compensate for\n\ndamages “that resulted from [the Architect’s] failure to comply with the\n\nArchitectural Contract” as found in the Structural Engineering Question. (CR1125-\n\n27; App. B). The total amount of damages found by the jury was $700,000 for the\n\ndifference in value from the hotel as constructed and the value had the Architect\n\ncomplied with the Architectural Contract, $70,000 for the cost of barrier\n\nremediation resulting from the Architect’s failure to comply, and $15,000 for the\n\nreasonable and necessary cost of repairs to the hotel due to the Architect’s failure\n\nto comply. (Id.)\n\n         After trial, the Architect moved for credit under the “one satisfaction rule”\n\nfor sums the General Contractor and the Soils Engineer (“Settling Defendants”\n\ncollectively) paid in settlement of the contract claims against them. (CR1173-\n\n1228). The trial court deemed the credit applicable because it concluded the\n\n3\n The Reporter’s Record is cited by “[Volume Number]RR.” Exhibits are cited to page or pages\nof the Reporter’s Record on which they or the pertinent parts thereof appear.\n\n                                            2\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\fdamages were indivisible, despite the fact the court submitted and the jury found\n\ndamages limited to those “that resulted from [the Architect’s] failure to comply\n\nwith the Architectural Contract . . . .” (CR1437-41; CR1127; App. B, C).\n\nMoreover, the trial court concluded that the absence of contractual joint and\n\nseveral liability did not render the one satisfaction rule inapplicable. (CR1437-41;\n\nApp. C).\n\n         Applying the one satisfaction rule, the Court ordered that RLJ recover the\n\nfrom the Architect $516,650.96, which was the sum of the jury’s award of\n\n$785,000 as actual damages resulting from the Architect’s breach of contract and\n\nthe attorney’s fee award of $901,650.96, less $1,170,000, which was the amount of\n\nthe settlements of the Settling Defendants. (CR1711; App. D).\n\n         The parties agreed to try the attorney’s fees to the court instead of the jury.\n\nRLJ presented evidence of its reasonable and necessary attorney’s fees for\n\nasserting the contractual claims against the Architect, the General Contractor, and\n\nthe Soils Engineer. (3SCR3-611; 2SCR1603-05). However, the trial court only\n\nawarded fees for the contractual claim against the Architect and rendered judgment\n\naccording to its application of the one satisfaction rule and its segregation of\n\nattorney’s fees. (CR1708-1712; App. D). The Architect timely filed its notice of\n\nappeal (CR1907-13) and RLJ timely perfected its cross-appeal (1SCR3-4).\n\n\n\n\n                                            3\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\f                                II.   ISSUES PRESENTED\nA.       Whether the trial court erred in applying the one satisfaction rule and thus\n\n         reducing the damages found to have resulted from the specific breach of the\n\n         Architectural Contract by the Architect by the amounts received in\n\n         settlement for damages resulting from the breach of the different contractual\n\n         duties owed by the Soils Engineer and the General Contractor (CR1173-79,\n\n         1437-41; 2SCR1578-97, 1637-1745) including but not limited to the\n\n         following sub-issues:\n\n         1.       Whether, in addition to an indivisible injury, joint and several liability\n\n                  is required for application of the one satisfaction rule, and, if so,\n\n                  whether the liable and settling parties must have contracted for the\n\n                  same performance to deem a contractual liability joint and several?\n\n         2.       Whether the one satisfaction rule does not apply due to the absence of\n\n                  an “indivisible injury” because: (a) the damages found by the jury\n\n                  were specifically limited to those caused by the contractual breach of\n\n                  the non-settling defendant; (b) the non-settling defendant in its closing\n\n                  argument advised the jury that it should not include damages it\n\n                  deemed attributable to the Settling Defendants; or (c) both?\n\n         3.       Whether the one satisfaction rule does not apply unless the liability of\n\n                  the non-settling defendant is based on a non-contractual theory?\n\n\n                                               4\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\f         4.       Whether application of the one satisfaction rule violates article I, §16\n\n                  of the Texas Constitution guaranteeing freedom of contract by\n\n                  depriving a party of the benefit of a contractual agreement with\n\n                  another and applying those benefits to offset the liability of a third-\n\n                  party?\n\n         5.       Whether the Architect waived the right to seek application of the one\n\n                  satisfaction rule by any one or more of the following: (a) failing to\n\n                  specially except to a lack of settlement allocation; (b) failing to plead\n\n                  the rule as an affirmative defense, (c) inviting the jury to exclude from\n\n                  its damage finding damages caused by the Settling Defendants; or\n\n                  (d)failing to object to a jury question that permitted the jury to only\n\n                  find damages attributable to the Architect’s breach of contract?\n\nB.       Either if there was a joint and several contractual liability between the\n\n         Architect and the Settling Defendants or if the damages were awarded for an\n\n         indivisible injury, whether the trial court erred in refusing to award RLJ\n\n         reasonable and necessary attorney’s fees incurred in the presentation of the\n\n         breach of contract claims against the Architect, the General Contractor and\n\n         the Soils Engineer and in awarding those fees attributable only to the\n\n         presentation of the claim against the Architect? (3SCR3-611; 2SCR1603-05,\n\n         1600-01, 1711).\n\n\n                                               5\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\f                           III.   STATEMENT OF FACTS\n         The record in this case does not support the application of the one\n\nsatisfaction offset against the damages found caused by the Architect. First, the\n\nevidence shows separate contractual duties, not common or overlapping duties.\n\nThus, there is no basis for joint and several liability, a sine qua non for application\n\nof the one satisfaction rule. Second, the jury, in answer to Question 3, determined\n\nthe damages caused by the Architect. The jury did not find an indivisible amount\n\nof damages caused by the settling defendants and the Architect. Third, the\n\nArchitect invited the jury to reduce the damages finding based on damages caused\n\nby the settling defendants. Indeed, the Architect did not raise the issue of one\n\nsatisfaction until after the trial, failing to plead it, specially except regarding it, and\n\nfailing to object to either the omission of a segregated damages question or to\n\nQuestion 3, which focused on damages caused by the Architect only. Finally,\n\nQuestion 3 and the record show that the jury reduced the amount of damages it\n\nawarded resulting from the Architect’s breach to remove amounts caused by the\n\nnon-settling parties. Thus, the record shows that recovery of the full amount\n\nawarded in answer to Question 3 did not present even the possibility of a double\n\nrecovery or more than one satisfaction.\n\n         Having suffered over $7 million in damages, receiving settlement funds of\n\n$1,170,000 for the damages caused by the breaches by the General Contractor and\n\n\n                                            6\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\fSoils Engineer, plus the jury award of $785,000 for the damages caused by the\n\nArchitect, certainly would not amount to more than one satisfaction. Indeed,\n\ndespite three contracts for millions of dollars and separate and distinct promised\n\nperformances, RLJ received a building with serious deficiencies that have caused\n\nloss and will continue to do so. Yet, RLJ is forced to accept the Architect\n\nbenefiting from the other’s breaches of contract to which it was not a party by\n\nreceiving two damage reductions or offsets: one by the limited damage inquiry in\n\nthe jury charge and a second from the application of the one satisfaction rule.\n\nA.       Separate Contracts With Separate and Distinct\n         Promised Performances on the Project.\n         The contracts with the Architect, the General Contractor, and the Soils\n\nEngineer did not promise the same performance.\n\n             • The Soils Engineer agreed to assess site conditions and recommend\n               specific foundation design parameters based on the same. (PX-3;\n               12RR6-11; 3RR161; App. E).\n\n             • The General Contractor agreed to build the structure designed by the\n               Architect with the assistance of its Structural Engineer, and comply\n               with the plans and specifications of the Project. (PX-48; 12RR569-75;\n               App. F).\n\n             • The Architect, with the assistance of its Structural Engineer, agreed to\n               prepare an appropriate foundation plan. (PX-15; 12RR30, 35, 47, 49;\n               App. G).\n\n         The Architectural Contract (PX-15; 12RR26-77; App. G) provided, among\n\nother things, that the Architect’s design services “include normal structural,\n\n\n                                            7\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\fmechanical and electrical engineering” (12RR39) along with “[s]tructural\n\n[e]ngineering design, document preparation and coordination” through “[o]ur\n\nStructural Engineering firm...Marlin Bridges Associates, Inc.” (12RR47). In\n\nconjunction with its retained Structural Engineer (PX-15; 12RR28), the Architect\n\npromised to provide a foundation design for the Project. (PX-15; 12RR30, 35, 47,\n\n49; PX-13; 12RR17-25).\n\n         The original owner White Lodging Services Corporation, Inc. contracted for\n\nthe services of the Soils Engineer to provide “geotechnical services” including\n\nevaluating soil conditions and providing recommendations which would address\n\n“[f]oundation design and construction.” (PX-3; 12RR6-11; App. E). This\n\ninformation was to be supplied to the Architect and its Structural Engineer in\n\nconnection with the Project’s foundation design. (PX-15; 12RR48; App. G).\n\n         The original owner also separately contracted with the General Contractor to\n\nbuild the Project according to the Architect’s plans and specifications. (PX-48;\n\n12RR569-75; App. F). The General Contractor agreed “that materials and\n\nequipment furnished will be of good quality[,]…that the work will be free from\n\ndefect…and will conform to the requirements” (PX-48; 12RR616; App. F) of the\n\nArchitect’s plans and specifications. (PX-48; 12RR610-11).\n\n         After the construction was completed, the Project was found to have cracks\n\nin the slab and grade, shifting door frames, cracks in partition walls, cracks in the\n\n\n                                           8\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\fswimming pool, and perimeter drainage problems. (3RR118; 4RR78-79; 7RR47).\n\nInvestigation revealed that the Project suffered from geotechnical engineering\n\ndeficiencies, foundation design defects, and construction defects (DX-147;\n\n17RR514; 7RR49-62), in breach of the separate contractual duties undertaken by\n\nthe Architect, the General Contractor, and the Soils Engineer.\n\nB.       Separate and Distinct Acts and Omissions Breaching\n         Separate and Distinct Contractual Obligations.\n         The Soils Engineer allegedly breached its contract by, among other things,\n\nfailing to account for the amount of necessary site excavation. This breach resulted\n\nin soil expansion greater than the estimate in the Soils Engineer’s report. (CR192-\n\n93, 197-98, 200-01, 209-12). The Soils Engineer miscalculated the potential\n\nvertical rise (PVR) of the soil and failed to recommend that enough of the soil be\n\ndug out and replaced with special engineered soil that did not have the expansive\n\nproperties of the native soil, called “select fill.” (DX-147; 17RR510).\n\n         The Architect breached its contract by failing to provide a foundation design\n\nthat was adequate for the site. Specifically, the Architect’s Structural Engineer\n\nimproperly designed the foundation and other structures by, among other things,\n\nfailing to account for the limitations and recommendations in the Soils Engineer’s\n\nreport, including designing a foundation insufficiently robust for the conditions\n\nreported by the Soils Engineer. (4RR122-124; 4RR150-151). The Architect’s\n\nStructural Engineer further failed to follow the Soil Engineer’s recommendations\n\n                                           9\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\fconcerning the appropriate type of foundation design. (4RR122-124; 4RR150-\n\n151).\n\n         The General Contractor was alleged to have failed to build according to the\n\nplans and specifications supplied and provide a building free from defects, contrary\n\nto its promised contractual performance. (CR188-89). Richard Reeves, a\n\nconstruction manager expert, testified concerning the General Contractor’s specific\n\nconstruction omissions and defects, meaning that certain construction failed to\n\ncomply with the plans and specifications provided by the Architect. (7RR49-62).\n\nThese included:\n\n              • A missing foundation grade beam (7RR53-54),\n\n              • Reinforcement of the concrete slab with welded wire mesh\n                lacking polypropylene fibers (7RR58),\n\n              • Unconnected and improperly constructed drains (7RR49-51,\n                55-58, 60-62),\n\n              • Improperly constructed “clean-out” access points to drains,\n                sewer lines and vents that were covered with flooring and\n                drywall (7RR51-53, 56-57), and\n\n              • Concrete overpours that improperly encased pipes in concrete.\n                (7RR58-60).\n\nUnder Question 3 in the charge, the jury was asked to determine the amount of\n\ndamages caused by the Architect, and thus it was allowed and indeed encouraged\n\n\n\n\n                                          10\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\fto reduce its damages award based on breaches of contract by the Settling\n\nDefendants. (CR1127; App. B).\n\nC.       Suit and Settlements By the Soils Engineer and the General Contractor.\n         As the original owner’s successor in interest and assignee, RLJ sued, among\n\nothers, the Architect, the Soils Engineer, and the General Contractor for damages\n\nto the Project resulting from various breaches of contract that caused foundation\n\nand drainage problems. (CR188-218; App. A). Through pre-trial summary\n\njudgments and non-suits, the suit was confined as matter of law to RLJ’s contract\n\nclaims against the General Contractor, the Soils Engineer and the Architect.\n\n(CR1708, 1710; 2SCR42; App. D). Before trial, and after the trial court restricted\n\nthe case to contract claims, the Soils Engineer settled the contract claim against it\n\nfor $70,000. (CR1080-81; CR1710; App. D). During trial, RLJ settled its contract\n\nclaims against the General Contractor for $1.1 million. (7RR105-08; CR1710,\n\n1226; App. D). As noted, the evidence showed that the damages to the Project\n\nfrom all contractual breaches of the Architect and Settling Defendants was at least\n\n$7,536,224. (7RR48; 9RR123-124, 136; 7RR16-18, 26-39; 3RR133-136; PX-151,\n\n16RR1-1145; 10RR29-31). During closing arguments, RLJ argued that only\n\n$6,029,299 in damages was attributable to the Architect, the rest being attributable\n\nto the Settling Defendants and other responsible parties. (10RR29-31). The\n\nArchitect similarly argued that the portion of RLJ’s damages attributable to the\n\n\n                                          11\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\fArchitect was “zero,” because the fault was attributable to other parties. (10RR54-\n\n56).\n\n         RLJ’s contract claims against the Architect were then submitted to the jury.\n\n(CR1121-29; App. B). The jury found that the Architect breached its contract “by\n\nfailing to comply … regarding the structural engineering services required.”\n\n(CR1126; App. B). Finding that the Architect breached the Architectural Contract\n\nin response to the Structural Engineering Question, the jury awarded $785,000 in\n\ndamages that resulted from the Architect’s breach. (CR1125, 1127; App. B).\n\nD.       The Trial Court Rules That the One Satisfaction Rule Applies.\n         Four days later, the Architect claimed for the first time a credit for the\n\nGeneral Contractor’s and Soils Engineer’s settlements under the one satisfaction\n\nrule. (CR1173-79). After entertaining RLJ’s response (2SCR1578-97), the trial\n\ncourt ruled that the one satisfaction rule applied solely because it deemed the\n\nclaims against the Architect, the General Contractor, and the Soils Engineer all to\n\nbe for one “indivisible injury.” (CR1439). It presumed the General Contractor’s\n\nand Soils Engineer’s settlements were payment for the same injury for which the\n\njury awarded damages against the Architect. (CR1438). The trial court further\n\nreasoned “RLJ needed to identify that category of [divisible] damages [against the\n\n\n\n\n                                          12\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\fGeneral Contractor] and state the amount apportioned to it.” 4 (CR1438). RLJ\n\nsought reconsideration of the trial court’s letter ruling via a Motion for Judgment\n\n(2SCR1606-1636) and a Motion for Reconsideration (2SCR1637-1745). The trial\n\ncourt denied both motions. (CR1905; 2SCR2102).\n\nE.       Attorney’s Fees Allowed Only for Breach of Contract Claim\n         Against the Architect.\n         Per stipulation, RLJ submitted its attorney’s fees claim for resolution by the\n\ncourt. The trial court’s letter ruling suggested that RLJ was entitled to recover fees\n\nfor presenting the contractual claims against the Architect, the General Contractor\n\nand the Soils Engineer. (CR1400; App. C). RLJ filed an amended application for\n\nthose attorney’s fees in the amount of $1,388,019. (3SCR3-611; 2SCR1603-05).\n\nThe trial court, however, ultimately decided to award attorney’s fees only for the\n\nbreach of contract case against the Architect. (CR1711; App. D).\n\nF.       The Trial Court Renders Final Judgment.\n         The trial court rendered judgment for RLJ in the principal sum of\n\n$551,650.96, being the difference between the sum of the damage and attorney’s\n\nfees award against the Architect, less the sum of the settlements from the Settling\n\nDefendants. (CR1711; App. D).\n\n\n\n4\n  The trial court was not clear whether this identification needed to be contained in the settlement\nagreements themselves or be presented in the evidence to the jury. (CR1438). RLJ was not given\nthe opportunity to segregate or apportion damages to satisfy the trial court’s reasoning before the\ncase was submitted to the jury.\n\n                                                13\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\f                           IV.   SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\n\nA.       The One Satisfaction Rule Does Not Apply.\n         The one satisfaction rule applies if, and only if, the liability of judgment\n\ndebtor and settling defendants is joint and several. Indivisible injury alone is only\n\nsufficient to establish joint and several tort, not contractual, liability. If the one\n\nsatisfaction rule applies at all, it applies in this case only if there is joint and several\n\ncontractual liability. To have such liability, the Architect and the Settling\n\nDefendants must each have breached a promise to provide the same performance.\n\nHere, the promised performances were not the same, so the one satisfaction rule\n\ndoes not apply. Even if “indivisible” damages alone somehow is assumed\n\narguendo to have created joint and several contractual liability, the jury’s damages\n\nfinding was limited to the damages resulting from the Architect’s failure to\n\ncomply. (CR1127; App. B).\n\n         Further, RLJ would urge that the one satisfaction rule simply should not\n\napply in contract cases such as this. The one satisfaction rule was judicially created\n\nto address a problem created by a statute that only applied to tort liability.\n\nApplying it in contract cases deprives the injured party of the benefit of its\n\nsettlement agreement and transfers that benefit to the wrongdoer in violation of the\n\nfreedom of contract guaranteed by Texas Constitution article I, section 16.\n\n\n\n\n                                            14\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\f         In any event, the Architect waived application of the one satisfaction rule. It\n\nfailed to plead this affirmative defense, was guilty of laches in waiting until after\n\nthe verdict to assert it, failed to object to the failure of the damages question to\n\nsegregate damages as it contends should have been done, and argued for the\n\napportionment of damages in its closing argument.\n\n         For all these reasons, as more fully articulated below, the trial court’s\n\ndecision to credit RLJ’s settlement with the General Contractor and Soils Engineer\n\nto the damages the jury assessed against the Architect was erroneous. Accordingly,\n\nthe judgment must be modified to restore the damages awarded to RLJ by the jury\n\nfor the Architect’s breach of contract.\n\nB.       RLJ Entitled To Attorney’s Fees For the Presentation of the Breach of\n         Contract Claims Against the Architect, General Contractor, and Soils\n         Engineer Either If These Parties Shared a Joint and Several\n         Contractual Duty Or If the Damages Were “Indivisible.”\n         If multiple defendants breached the same contractual duty, RLJ was entitled\n\nto recover attorney’s fees for the presentation against all those defendants because\n\nthe preparation and proof would have been necessary for the case against any one\n\nof them. RLJ maintains that the Architect and the Settling Defendants here did not\n\nbreach contractual undertakings to perform the same duties and, therefore, there\n\nwas no joint and several contractual liability among the Architect and the Settling\n\nDefendants. However, if this Court holds otherwise, then it necessarily follows that\n\nRLJ is entitled to recover its attorney’s fees for cases against the Architect, the\n\n                                            15\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\fGeneral Contractor and the Soils Engineer because the same preparation and proof\n\nwould have been necessary for the case against any one of them. If so, there was\n\nno need to limit the recoverable attorney’s fees only to those attributable to the\n\nbreach of contract case against the Architect.\n\n         The same is also true if the trial court correctly ruled that the damages for\n\nthe Architect’s breach were indivisible from those allegedly caused by the Settling\n\nDefendants. Again, RLJ maintains that the damages here were necessarily\n\nsegregated by the nature of the damages question and under the arguments of the\n\nparties to the jury and presents this contention only if this Court determines that the\n\none satisfaction rule applies.\n\n                           V.   ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITIES\n         The one satisfaction rule is intended under appropriate circumstances to\n\nprevent a plaintiff from receiving a double recovery. It was never been intended to\n\nbe used to reduce damages found to have been caused by the remaining defendant\n\nby the amount of settlements entered with settling defendants. As applied in this\n\ncase, the one satisfaction rule does not achieve the purpose of defeating a double\n\nrecovery absent joint and several liability and indivisible damages. In fact, as\n\napplied, the rule violates Texas public policy encouraging settlement and the\n\nfreedom to contract. The application here provides a strong disincentive to partial\n\nsettlements, particularly in construction contract cases. In any event, the rule was\n\n\n                                           16\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\fnot timely and appropriately raised by the Architect through timely pleading,\n\nexceptions, objections to the charge, and indeed the Architect invited the jury to do\n\nits own reduction in answering the damages question prior to applying the one\n\nsatisfaction rule.\n\nA.       The One Satisfaction Rule Does Not Apply.\n         The decision to apply the one satisfaction rule was erroneous for many\n\nreasons. First, the rule requires at a minimum joint and several liability of the\n\ndefendants. Here, the Architect was tried only on a breach of contract theory. Joint\n\nand several liability is limited to tort law. There was no evidence here of a joint\n\nand common contractual duty among the settling defendants and the Architect.\n\nSecond, the damages reduced by the trial court here were not so-called common or\n\nindivisible damages. Instead, the jury found only “damages that resulted from [the\n\nArchitect’s] failure to comply with the Architectural Contract . . . .” Finally, the\n\nrecord does not in any way support the notion that RLJ would be getting a double\n\nrecovery absent application of the one satisfaction rule. The damages sought and as\n\nto which evidence was presented involved a claim of over $7 million. The jury was\n\npermitted and invited by counsel for the Architect to reduce its damage finding as\n\nto damages caused by others based on the fact the Court’s charge required that the\n\ndamages had to have resulted from the Architect’s breach of contract. The jury is\n\npresumed to have read the charge and followed it. Thus, this is not a case of a\n\n\n                                         17\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\fdouble recovery; instead, with application of the settlements relating to separate\n\ncontractual duties under the one satisfaction rule, it is the Architect who is unfairly\n\nreceiving a double reduction.\n\n         1.       This Case Involves Contractual, Not Tort, Liability.\n         Because of pre-trial rulings and non-suits, the only claims pending before\n\ntrial were RLJ’s contract claims against the General Contractor, the Soils Engineer\n\nand the Architect. (CR1708,1710; 2SCR42; App. D). Before trial, RLJ settled with\n\nthe Soils Engineer for $70,000. (CR1080-81; CR1710; App. D). During trial, RLJ\n\nsettled with the General Contractor for $1.1 million. (7RR105-08l; CR1226, 1710;\n\nApp. D). Only RLJ’s contract claims against the Architect were submitted to the\n\njury.\n\n         Not only was the Architect’s liability purely contractual, the damages sought\n\nwere only recoverable in contract. (CR1127; App. B). The alleged harm was\n\neconomic loss to the subject of the contract itself – i.e., the Project. “When the\n\ninjury is only the economic loss to the subject of a contract itself, the action sounds\n\nin contract alone.” Jim Walters Homes v. Reed, 711 S.W.2d 617, 617-18 (Tex.\n\n1986).\n\n         After trial, the Architect asserted for the first time it was entitled to credit\n\nunder the one satisfaction rule for the Settling Defendants’ settlements. (CR1173-\n\n1179). The trial court agreed (CR1710; 1437-41; App. C, D), conflating the tort\n\n\n                                            18\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\fjoint and several liability with contract. According to the trial court, “Each party is\n\nliable for its own [contractual] breach which by itself results in indivisible\n\ndamages[, j]ust as with tortfeasors who breach different common law duties that\n\neach proximately cause an indivisible damage.” (CR1439; App. C; emphasis\n\nadded).\n\n         2.       The One Satisfaction Rule Was Developed to Address Settlements\n                  In Tort Cases With Less Than All Defendants After the\n                  Legislature Authorized Joint and Several Liability.\n         More than sixty years ago, the Texas Supreme Court deemed the risk of a\n\ndouble recovery no justification for depriving a plaintiff of a favorable settlement.\n\n         [O]ur courts seem to have embraced the philosophy … that it is better\n         that the injured party lose all of his damages than that any of several\n         wrongdoers should pay more of the damages than he individually and\n         separately caused. If such has been the law, from the standpoint of\n         justice it should not have been ….\n\nLanders v. East Texas Salt Water Disposal Co., 151 Tex. 251, 248 S.W.2d 731,\n\n734 (1952) (emphasis added). Fully understanding when the one satisfaction rule\n\nshould and should not apply requires an appreciation of its history and why it was\n\ncreated in the first place.\n\n         The one satisfaction rule was developed to correct a statutorily-created\n\nanomaly. In the early Twentieth Century, the Legislature attempted to alleviate the\n\nharshness of the common law prohibition of contribution claims by creating a\n\ncontribution cause of action against other tortfeasors when a defendant was held\n\n\n                                           19\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\fliable for more than its per capita share of liability. But the statute did not address\n\nwhat happened if the plaintiff settled with one of the other defendants. The courts\n\nresponded by creating the one satisfaction rule. If a defendant is subject to liability\n\nthrough joint and several liability for more than the damages he or she caused, a\n\nsettlement by that defendant involves something that overlaps with a remaining\n\nnon-settling joint and several defendant, thus allowing consideration of double\n\nrecovery issues. Therefore, outside the context of joint and several tort liability,\n\nthere is no other recognized justification for imposing the one satisfaction rule.\n\n                  a.       Generally There Was No Joint & Several\n                           Tort Liability at Common Law.\n         At common law, a tort suit could not be asserted against multiple defendants\n\nfor damages to which each defendant contributed unless the defendants acted\n\naccording to a common plan or scheme. Sun Oil Co. v. Robicheaux, 23 S.W.2d\n\n713, 715 (Tex. Comm. App. 1930) (judgment adopted). Otherwise, there could be\n\nno joint tort liability. Instead, the plaintiff had to sue each defendant separately and\n\nestablish that particular part of the injury that particular defendant caused. Id.\n\n                  b.       There Was No General Right of Contribution\n                           at Common Law.\n         Also, defendants were not permitted a right of contribution generally under\n\nTexas common law. Gattegno v. The Parisian, 53 S.W.2d 1005, 1007 (Tex.\n\nComm’n App. 1932, holding approved). It was “against the policy of the law to\n\n\n                                             20\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\fadjust equities between wrongdoers, or to allow a [liable] person to found an action\n\non his own wrong.” Austin Road Co. v. Pope, 147 Tex. 430, 216 S.W.2d 563, 564-\n\n65 (1949).\n\n                  c.       Statute Allowed Collection of All Damages From Any\n                           Defendant and Gave Defendant the Right to\n                           Contribution from the Other Tortfeasors, But Fails to\n                           Address Settlement With Less Than All Tortfeasors.\n         The Legislature passed article 2212 (now Texas Civil Practice & Remedies\n\nCode chapter 32) to change these two perceived deficiencies. First, article 2212\n\nallowed a tort defendant to be liable for all damages even if the common result of\n\nmultiple actors’ independent torts. A plaintiff no longer bore the “intolerable\n\nburden” of proving particular damages attributable to a particular tort defendant in\n\ncommon injury cases. Hodges, Contribution and Indemnity Among Tortfeasors, 26\n\nTex. L. Rev. 150, 151 n.11 (1947); Wigmore, Joint Tortfeasors and Severance of\n\nDamages: Making the Innocent Party Suffer Without Redress, 17 Ill. L. Rev. 458,\n\n459 (1922). Instead, the plaintiff could recover all tort damages from a single\n\ndefendant. Deal v. Madison, 576 S.W.2d at 414.\n\n         Article 2212 also created a right of action so that the defendant who was\n\nheld liable for the total common damages and, thereby, paid more than its per\n\ncapita 5 share of the total tort liability could sue to collect the excess payment from\n\n5\n  At the time, liability was established by judgment and statutorily allocated equally among joint\ntortfeasors so the amount of potential contribution liability was fixed. Accordingly, there was no\nneed to plead the one satisfaction rule. The rules concerning contribution are today vastly\n\n                                               21\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\fthe other jointly liable defendants. Id.; Hodges, 26 Tex. L. Rev. at 151 n.11. Article\n\n2212, however, made no provision for cases in which fewer than all tortfeasors\n\nsettled. Deal, 576 S.W.2d at 414. (Tex. Civ. App.—Dallas 1978, writ ref’d n.r.e.).\n\n         To address a situation unique to tort claims involving defendants jointly and\n\nseverally liable for common injuries from independent torts, the courts created the\n\none satisfaction rule. Under it, a plaintiff who settled with less than all tortfeasors\n\nfor more than the settlors’ share of damages could not recover from the non-\n\nsettling tortfeasors more than the difference between total damages and the sum of\n\nall settlements. Hodges, 26 Texas L. Rev. at 171-72; see Gattegno, 53 S.W.2d at\n\n1007; Bradshaw v. Baylor University, 126 Tex. 99, 84 S.W.2d 703, 705 (1935).\n\n                  d.       The One Satisfaction Rule Was Designed to Address\n                           Joint and Several Liability In Tort Cases Only.\n         After the one satisfaction rule was adopted, the Texas Supreme Court\n\nabolished the common-law rule in Robicheaux, 23 S.W.2d at 715, that prevented\n\njoining multiple defendants in a single suit to impose joint and several liability for\n\nindependent torts. In Landers v. East Texas Salt Water Disposal Co., the court\n\nruled that when\n\n         tortious acts of two or more wrongdoers join to produce an indivisible\n         injury, that is, an injury which from its nature cannot be apportioned\n         with reasonable certainty to the individual wrongdoers, all of the\n         wrongdoers will be held jointly and severally liable for the entire\n\n\ndifferent, but cases continue, we would respectfully submit, to incorrectly recite that it is\nunnecessary to plead the one satisfaction rule though the reason why no longer exists.\n\n                                             22\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\f         damages and the injured party may proceed to judgment against any\n         one separately or against all in one suit. If fewer than the whole\n         number of wrongdoers are joined as defendants to plaintiff’s suit,\n         those joined may by proper cross action under the governing rules\n         bring in those omitted.\n\n248 S.W.2d at 734 (emphasis added). Landers abolished Robicheaux’s concerted\n\naction requirement for establishing joint and several tort liability. Under Landers,\n\nindivisible injury alone was enough in tort cases to establish joint and several\n\nliability. A party had to be jointly and severally liable for the entire damages, not\n\njust its share. Thus, when that party settled, they theoretically could have settled\n\nfor more than just their individual liability for just the damages they caused.\n\nAccordingly, in that setting, the plaintiff had the opportunity to ultimately settle\n\nwith multiple defendants for an amount greater than the plaintiff’s overall injury.\n\n         3.       The One Satisfaction Rule Only Applies\n                  In Cases Involving Joint Liability.\n         The one satisfaction rule’s historical development demonstrates it was\n\nintended to address a problem unique to settlements with less than all jointly and\n\nseverally liable defendants in tort cases – the only cases to which article 2212\n\napplied. Even assuming for the sake of argument that the one satisfaction rule\n\napplies in a contract case, which RLJ disputes, the one satisfaction rule does not\n\napply unless the liability of the liable defendant and the settling defendant is joint\n\nand several. GE Capital Commercial Inc. v. Worthington Nat’l Bank, 754 F.3d\n\n297, 306 (5th Cir. 2014); Crown Life Ins. Co. v. Casteel, 22 S.W.3d 378, 390 (Tex.\n\n                                          23\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\f2000); First Title Co. of Waco v. Garrett, 860 S.W.2d 74, 78 (Tex. 1993); Stewart\n\nTitle Guar. Co. v. Sterling, 822 S.W.2d 1, 8 (Tex. 1992); CTTI Priesmeyer, Inc. v.\n\nK&O Limited Partnership, 164 S.W.3d 675, 684 (Tex. App.—Austin 2005, no\n\npet.); LJ Charter, LLC v. Air America Jet Charter, Inc., No. 14-08-00534-CV,\n\n2009 WL 4794242 at *9 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] Dec. 15, 2009, pet.\n\ndenied). Joint and several liability is essential, Garrett, 860 S.W.2d at 79; Sterling,\n\n822 S.W.2d at 8, because the contribution right is derivative of the plaintiff’s right\n\nto recover from the contribution defendant. Shoemake v. Fogel, 826 S.W.3d 933,\n\n935 (Tex. 1992). A non-settling defendant may successfully urge the one\n\nsatisfaction rule only to reduce damages for which all the defendants are jointly\n\nliable. Casteel, 22 S.W.3d at 391; Garrett, 860 S.W.2d at 78. In other words, if the\n\nplaintiff could not impose joint and several liability, it would have no right to sue\n\nfor damages other than those caused by a particular defendant. Accordingly, a non-\n\nsettling defendant would have no right to seek an offset or credit from a settling\n\ndefendant since the plaintiff had no right to do so against the settling defendant or\n\nthe non-settling defendant.\n\n         Just last summer, the Fifth Circuit was persuaded by Garrett, Sterling, and\n\nthis Court’s reasoning in CTTI that joint and several liability was essential to the\n\napplication of the one satisfaction rule. GE Capital, 754 F.3d at 306. The suit arose\n\nwhen a predecessor’s employee fraudulently induced wire transfers to a bank that\n\n\n                                          24\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\faccepted them in bad faith in violation of a Texas statute. GE Capital sued the\n\npredecessor for contractual remedies under the purchase and sale agreement and\n\nsued the bank for statutory tort. Id. at 300. GE Capital settled its contractual claims\n\nwith the predecessor, but successfully tried the statutory tort claim against the\n\nbank. Id. at 301. The bank asserted the one satisfaction rule applied and GE Capital\n\nshould recover nothing because its contract damages were for the same loss settled\n\nby the bank. Id. at 303.\n\n         The Fifth Circuit held there was no legal duty shared by the settling and\n\nliable defendants and, therefore, the one satisfaction rule did not apply. Id. at 306-\n\n07, 309. A common factual origin for the damages claimed against the settling and\n\nliable defendants was not enough.\n\n         [The settling defendant’s] alleged contractual breach and the TUFTA\n         action against [the liable defendant] may share common underlying\n         facts – the three fraudulent transfers …. But such factual commonality\n         does not suffice … to render [the settling defendant] a joint tortfeasor\n         for one-satisfaction rule purposes.\n\nId. at 309 (emphasis added). The Fifth Circuit agreed with CTTI’s analysis that the\none satisfaction rule did not apply in any case where the duty allegedly breached\nby the liable and settling defendants was not the same. Id. at 306-07.\n\n                  a.       Unlike Tort Cases, Joint Liability in Contract Cases\n                           Requires More Than Common, Indivisible Damages.\n         Tort duties are universal; contractual duties are not. Landers implicitly\n\nrecognized the joint duty requirement would necessarily be satisfied in tort cases\n\nso that joint and several tort liability need only focus on existence of a common,\n\n                                              25\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\findivisible injury. 248 S.W.2d at 734. For purposes of tort liability, “the law\n\nimposes on all persons a duty to act as a reasonably prudent person would act\n\nunder same or similar circumstances, considering any reasonably foreseeable risks\n\nor probability of injury to others.” Zidell v. Bird, 692 S.W.2d 550, 553 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Austin 1985, no writ).\n\n         Undertakings in a contract, however, are binding only on the contracting\n\nparties and their privies. McClellan v. Scardello Ford, Inc., 619 S.W.2d 593, 597\n\n(Tex. Civ. App.—Amarillo 1981, no writ); Buckner Orphans Home v. Berry, 332\n\nS.W.2d 771, 776 (Tex. Civ. App.—Dallas 1960, writ ref’d n.r.e.). Thus, joint and\n\nseveral contractual liability requires more than indivisible injury. It also requires\n\nthat the parties separately promise the same performance,6 whether under the\n\nsame or separate contracts. 12 Richard A.

But not\n\nall undertakings for the same performance are necessarily joint.\n\n         Under the common law doctrine of joint, joint and several, and several\n         obligations in a contract, the question is whether multiple promisors\n         of the same performance have promised as a unit (jointly), or have\n\n6\n  Whether the performance promised by the both parties must be exactly the same for the liability\nto be joint is not an issue that need be resolved here.

Feb. 27, 2007) (joint promises);\n\nInvestIN.com Corp., 293 S.W.3d at 829; English, 2006 WL 903735 at *3.\n\n         The Texas Supreme Court has not yet decided whether joint and several\n\nliability is necessary for application of the one satisfaction rule to a contractual\n\nliability. GE Capital, 754 F.3d at 305. This and other courts, however, have\n\nconcluded that it does not apply unless both the liable and settling defendants’\n\nalleged liability arises out of the breach of a common contractual duty.\n\n         Like this case, CTTI involved a contract suit by an owner against the\n\narchitect and general contractor for a new building’s foundation defects. 164\n\nS.W.3d at 679. The CTTI architect’s contract required design and “supervisory\n\nservices.” 164 S.W.3d at 685. A separate contract required CTTI, the general\n\ncontractor, to build according to the architect’s plans and specifications. 164\n\n\n\n\n                                         27\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\fS.W.3d at 678. Before trial, the owner settled with several parties involved in the\n\nbuilding’s construction and settled with the architect during trial. Id.\n\n         After the jury returned its verdict, the general contractor sought to have its\n\ncontractual liability reduced by the other defendants’ settlement payments. Id. at\n\n680. After carefully reviewing Texas Supreme Court authorities, this Court held\n\nthe one satisfaction rule inapplicable unless the liable and settling defendants\n\nbreached the same contractual duty. Id. at 685. It concluded the architect’s and\n\ngeneral contractor’s promised performances differed so that the one satisfaction\n\nrule did not apply. Id.\n\n         Necessity of a joint liability is also illustrated by this Court’s decision in\n\nGalle, Inc. v. Pool, 262 S.W.3d 564, 574 (Tex. App.—Austin 2008, pet. denied).\n\nGalle involved a suit by an insured homeowner against his insurer and a mold\n\nremediator, alleging contractual and tort liabilities against both. Id. at 568, 570.\n\nThe homeowner settled all claims against the insurer before trial. Id. at 569. Post-\n\nverdict, the homeowner elected to recover in tort against the remediator. Id. at 570.\n\nThe remediator claimed a credit for the insurer’s settlement because the damages\n\nallegedly caused by the insurer and the remediator were indivisible. Implicitly\n\nrecognizing indivisible injury alone is sufficient for the joint and several tort\n\nliability under Landers, this Court held the one satisfaction rule applied. It further\n\nruled that the entire amount of the insurer’s settlement must be credited against the\n\n\n                                           28\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\ftort damages because the plaintiff did not segregate the settlement between\n\n“separate and joint damages” or between the tort and contractual liability theories.\n\nId. at 574.\n\n         Osborne v. Jauregui, 252 S.W.3d 70, 74 (Tex. App.—Austin 2008, pet.\n\ndenied), presented the obverse situation to Galle. In Osborne, it was the liable\n\ndefendant, not the settling defendant, who allegedly had a contractual liability in\n\naddition to joint tort and DTPA liability with the settling defendants. See also GE\n\nCapital, 754 F.3d at 307 n.9. The Osborne jury found no liability for breach of\n\ncontract, only for negligence and breaches of implied warranties actionable under\n\nthe DTPA. 252 S.W.3d at 74. Because the case involved alleged DTPA claims,\n\nunlike the verdict in Galle, the jury determined the percentage responsibility of the\n\nliable and settling defendants. Id.; see TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE §§33.002\n\n(proportionate responsibility applicable to “any action brought under the DTPA”);\n\n33.012 (under 2005 version, defendant had option of percentage reduction or dollar\n\ncredit for settlement). The jury also decided the total amount of the plaintiff’s\n\ndamages attributable to both the liable and settling defendant in an amount less\n\nthan the amount paid by the settling defendants. The liable defendant elected the\n\ndollar-for-dollar credit which more than offset the total amount of damages\n\nawarded by the jury. The plaintiff apparently elected to recover under the DTPA\n\nbecause the issue before the court was whether attorney’s fees could be recovered\n\n\n                                         29\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\fwhen the total amount of settlement exceeded the amount of the total damages\n\nawarded by the jury for the injuries caused by both the liable and settling\n\ndefendants. Id. at 75-76.\n\n         Thus, Osborne is a straightforward application of Civil Practice and\n\nRemedies Code chapter 33 to a case to which it explicitly applies: a DTPA/tort\n\nclaim for which the liable and settling defendants were jointly liable involving an\n\ninjury this Court deemed indivisible. The joint and several liability in that case\n\nwas created by statute, not common law. TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE §33.013,\n\nand the amount of damages awarded in that case were for the amount of damages\n\ncaused by all responsible persons. TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE §33.012.\n\n         The distinctions between Osborne and this case are manifold. Here, there\n\nwas no joint and several tort liability. Indeed, there was no joint and several\n\nliability of any description. See V.A.3.e., infra. Further, the damages awarded in\n\nOsborne were those found to have been caused by both the liable and settling\n\ndefendants. Here, the damages awarded were explicitly limited to those caused by\n\nthe Architect. See V.A.4., infra. Nevertheless, this Court’s decision in Osborne\n\nconfirms that the application of either a common law or statutory credit for\n\nsettlement hinges on joint and several liability.\n\n         Four years after CTTI, the Houston Fourteenth Court of Appeals also refused\n\nto apply the one satisfaction rule absent a shared contractual duty. In LJ Charter,\n\n\n                                          30\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\fNo. 14-08-00534-CV, 2009 WL 4794242 at **8-9 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th\n\nDist.] Dec. 15, 2009, pet. denied), the plaintiff received a judgment against the\n\nliable defendant for damages for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty and\n\nfraud. Id. at *6 n.12. The plaintiff previously settled claims for the alleged breach\n\nof two contracts by two other parties. The liable defendant was not a party to either\n\nof the contracts that were the basis of the settled claims. Id. at 9. The court refused\n\nthe liable defendant’s request for credit under the one satisfaction rule because the\n\nliable defendant was not a party to, and could not have been liable under, those\n\ncontracts. Id. When there was no joint liability, the one satisfaction rule did not\n\napply.\n\n                  b.       Without a Joint Contractual Obligation, Settlement Credit\n                           Under the One Satisfaction Rule Allowed the Architect to\n                           Do Indirectly What It Could Not Do Directly.\n         CTTI correctly observed if an indivisible injury alone created a joint and\n\nseveral liability between contract and tort defendants, applying the one satisfaction\n\nrule would permit “hold[ing] a person not a party to a contract liable for the breach\n\nof that contract.” Id. at 685. Such result is legally impermissible because\n\ncontractual privity is necessary for standing to sue. OAIC Commercial Assets,\n\nL.L.C. v. Stonegate Village, L.P., 234 S.W.3d 726, 738 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2007,\n\npet. denied). Standing to sue is essential to subject-matter jurisdiction. Travelers\n\nIns. Co. v. Joachim, 315 S.W.3d 860, 865 (Tex. 2010). No privity of contract exists\n\n\n                                              31\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\fbetween persons not parties to the same contract without promises of the same\n\nperformance. See Amco Trust, Inc. v. Naylor, 159 Tex. 146, 150, 317 S.W.2d 47,\n\n50 (1958).\n\n         Under these circumstances, a contractually liable defendant who shared no\n\ncontractual obligation would have no standing to recover from the settling\n\ndefendant. The liable defendant is a stranger to the contract between the plaintiff\n\nand the settling defendant. If credit under the one satisfaction rule were permitted\n\nabsent a shared performance obligation, the liable defendant could achieve\n\nindirectly what could not have been achieved directly; a stranger without privity\n\ncould in effect wrest a credit based on settlement of that contractual obligation.\n\nRegardless of whether the injury was “indivisible,” the one satisfaction rule could\n\nnot apply without a common promise to perform the same contractual duty. Id. at\n\n684.\n\n                  c.       This Court Has Rejected Application of the\n                           One Satisfaction Rule to Contractual Liability\n                           Without a Joint Contractual Obligation.\n         The trial court in this case applied the one satisfaction rule solely on the\n\nbasis of perceived “indivisible” damages. (CR1438-39). In CTTI, this Court:\n\n         acknowledge[d] that there are cases in which the courts have applied\n         the one satisfaction rule and granted settlement credits or required an\n         election of remedies where there are co-existing tort and contract\n         claims. . . .In those cases, the courts have focused on the indivisible\n         nature of the injury to the plaintiffs, and have not discussed the\n         requirement of joint liability. We find that focus to be misplaced and\n\n                                               32\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\f         decline to follow those decisions.… If we were to hold that, due to the\n         indivisible nature of the resulting injury, breach of contract defendants\n         and tort defendants are jointly and severally liable for all damages, we\n         would be forced to hold a person not a party to a contract liable for\n         the breach of that contract.\n\n(164 S.W.3d at 684-85; emphasis added). The same rationale applies when the\n\nliable and settling defendants’ liability rests on distinct contractual obligations\n\nunder different contracts. Therefore, the trial court erred in applying the one\n\nsatisfaction credit based solely on perceived “indivisible” damages.\n\n                  d.       Applying the One Satisfaction Rule Without\n                           Joint Contractual Liability Obliterates the\n                           Collateral Source Exception.\n         The collateral source rule is an exception to the one satisfaction rule. Brown\n\nv. Am. Transfer and Storage Co., 601 S.W.2d 931, 936 (Tex. 1980). If indivisible\n\ninjury alone were enough for applying the one satisfaction rule, this exception\n\nwould be meaningless. Under the collateral source rule, a wrongdoer cannot reduce\n\nits liability because of benefits the plaintiff independently procures from another to\n\nwhich the wrongdoer was not privy. Haygood v. DeEscabedo, 356 S.W.3d 390,\n\n395 (Tex. 2012); Tex. & Pac. Ry. v. Levi & Bro., 59 Tex. 674 (1883). Typically,\n\nthe collateral source is an insurer’s contractual obligation to pay for all or part of\n\nsame damages sought from the defendant. Brown v. Am. Transfer & Storage Co.,\n\n601 S.W.2d 931, 934 (Tex. 1980). If an indivisible injury or the “same damages”\n\nalone triggered the one satisfaction rule, such insurance benefits would serve to\n\n\n                                              33\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\freduce the liable defendant’s liability and prevent a double recovery. Thus, the\n\nexistence of the collateral source exception belies the notion that indivisible injury\n\nalone is sufficient for application of the one satisfaction rule. For this additional\n\nreason, a joint and several liability is essential for application of the one\n\nsatisfaction rule to contractual liabilities.\n\n                  e.       This Case Involved No Joint Contractual Liability\n                           of the Architect and the Settling Defendants.\n         Because joint and several contractual liability is essential, the question here\n\nnarrows to whether the Architect’s contractual liability was joint with that of the\n\nSettling Defendants; i.e., was the liability imposed on the Architect for the same\n\ncontractual promise or promises also made by each Settling Defendant. As\n\nacknowledged in CTTI, the contractual obligations of an architect are distinct from\n\nthose of a general contractor. 164 S.W.3d at 685. Only the Architect’s contractual\n\nliability was submitted to the jury. (CR1125-26, 1708-10). There could be no\n\ncommon promised performance between the Architect and the Settling Defendants.\n\n                           1)   The Performance Could Not Be the Same by\n                                Operation of Law: General Contractors Legally\n                                Precluded From Preparing Plans & Specifications.\n         Neither the Soils Engineer nor the General Contractor in this case were a\n\nregistered architect and were not retained to perform architectural duties. (PX-15;\n\n12RR26-77; PX-48; 12RR569-75; App. F, G). As a matter of Texas law, the\n\nobligations of an architect cannot be undertaken by one who is not a registered\n\n                                              34\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\farchitect. TEX. OCCUP. CODE §1051.701. This statute is part of the contracts as if\n\nwritten in explicitly because the parties are conclusively presumed to know and\n\ncontract with reference to existing law. Snyder v. Eanes Indep. Sch. Dist., 860\n\nS.W.2d 692, 697 (Tex. App.—Austin 1993, writ denied). By operation of law,\n\ntherefore, the Architect’s duties were not and could not be the same as those of the\n\nSettling Defendants.\n\n                           2)   The Performance of the Architect and the Settling\n                                Defendants Was Not Alleged To Be the Same.\n         According to the live portions of the petition on which the case was tried, the\n\nGeneral Contractor “agreed to construct the Project free from defects” (2SCR44;\n\nApp. A), but failed to do so. It was alleged the General Contractor did not comply\n\nwith the Project’s plans and specifications and contract documents, the promise to\n\nbuild free from defects, and the duty perform in a good and workmanlike manner.\n\n(2SCR43-44, 47; App. A).\n\n         RLJ alleged that the Soils Engineer 7 was retained by the owner to “conduct a\n\ngeotechnical engineering study,” provide “geotechnical engineering services,” and\n\n“materials testing and construction inspection services.” (2SCR45; App. A). RLJ\n\nalleged that the Soils Engineer breached these undertakings by failing to properly\n\nestimate the potential of the soil at the site for swelling and underestimating the\n\n\n7\n  Terracon, a settling defendant, was the successor-in-interest to HBC, a party to the\nGeotechnical Study Contract. (CR186; App. A).\n\n                                             35\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\famount of soil that needed to be replaced to control soil expansion. (2SCR66-67;\n\nApp. A).\n\n         The allegations against the Architect, on the other hand, were that it agreed\n\nto “provide overall architectural, civil, and structural engineering design, document\n\npreparation, and coordination for the Project.” (2SCR44; App. A). RLJ alleged the\n\nArchitect “breached the Architectural Contract by deviating from the applicable\n\nstandard of care, failing to produce design plans free from defects, and failing to\n\nproperly administer the construction of the Project.” (2SCR47; App. A).\n\n         The legal injury sustained when an architect breaches its contractual\n\nobligation to provide appropriate building plans and supervisory services is\n\nseparate from that sustained when a general contractor fails to build in accordance\n\nwith those plans and specifications. Hunt v. Ellisor & Tanner, 739 S.W.2d 933,\n\n936, 938 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1987, writ denied). “The [architect’s] obligation was\n\nnon-construction; the general contractor’s obligation was construction.” Hunt, 739\n\nS.W.2d at 938.\n\n         Because of the lack of a joint or common contractual undertaking, the court\n\nin Hunt ruled:\n\n         [W]hen the situation is pure contract, the special issues should not\n         include comparative causation [under the Uniform Comparative\n         Fault Act]…[because] if the acts of others (whether wrongful or not)\n         are contributing factors, those others are not thereby joined with the\n         defendant as having committed the breach of the contract.\n\n\n                                           36\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\f(Emphasis added; quoting 5 A. Corbin, Corbin on Contracts §§ 999 n.21 & 999 -\n\n1,000 (1964)). The court in White Budd VanNess P’ship v. Major-Gladys Drive\n\nJoint Venture, 798 S.W.2d 805, 819 (Tex. App.—Beaumont 1990), writ dism’d,\n\n811 S.W.2d 541 (Tex. 1991), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 861 (1991), followed Hunt’s\n\nreasoning to conclude that want of joint liability prevented submission of\n\ncomparative fault to reduce the architect’s contractual liability. Under Hunt and\n\nWhite Budd, the architect’s liability arose from the architect’s unique contractual\n\nobligations, not a promise to perform the same duty as the general contractor. Just\n\nas there can be no comparative submission of a general contractor’s fault, the one\n\nsatisfaction rule cannot be invoked to reduce the Architect’s liability with the\n\nGeneral Contractor’s settlement.\n\n         The same is true for the Architect’s particular failings concerning the\n\nfoundation design detailed in the certificate of merit. (2SCR60-61; App. A). The\n\nduty breached is the same if the evidence supporting the various causes of action is\n\nthe same. Buccaneer Homes of Alabama, Inc. v. Pelis, 43 S.W.3d 586, 590 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2001, no pet.). It is not the same if different evidence\n\nwould be required to prove the breach. These included failing to follow the various\n\nrecommendations and reports of the Soils Engineer. (2SCR61; App. A). Here, the\n\npromised performances of the Architect could not have been the same because the\n\nevidence necessary to prove the Architect’s breach differed from that which would\n\n\n                                        37\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\fhave been necessary to prove the alleged breaches of the Soils Engineer and the\n\nGeneral Contractor. Thus, the claims settled were for breaches of differing and\n\nseparate contractual duties from those of the Architect, both as a matter of fact and\n\nby operation of law.\n\n                           3)   The Architect Argued That Its Duty Was\n                                Different From Those of the Settling Defendants.\n         The Architect emphasized to the jury in closing arguments that the duties of\n\nthe Architect and the other participants were different. The Architect urged the jury\n\nthat it should not be found liable because the breaches of duties undertaken by\n\nothers, not the Architect, caused the damage. The Architect argued it was not\n\nserving as an engineer or a general contractor. (10RR33-34). It essentially denied\n\nany common duty, arguing it could not second-guess the Soils Engineer’s\n\npredictions about the potential vertical rise or provisions groundwater drainage at\n\nthe Project. (10RR34-37). According to the Architect, the foundation design was\n\n“doomed from the start” due to the Soils Engineer’s faulty performance. (10RR39).\n\nSuch clear, deliberate and unequivocal assertions during closing arguments are\n\njudicial admissions foreclosing application of the one satisfaction rule. See Price\n\nPfister, Inc. v. Moore & Kimmey, Inc., 48 S.W.3d 341, 349 (Tex. App.—Houston\n\n[14th Dist.] 2001, pet. denied); see also Medina v. Hart, 240 S.W.3d 16, 23 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Corpus Christi 2007, pet. denied).\n\n\n\n                                             38\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\f         In summary, the Architect and Settling Defendants did not promise the same\n\nperformance. Therefore, the one satisfaction rule does not apply because the\n\ncontractual liability of the Architect and the Settling Defendants was not joint.\n\n         4.       The One Satisfaction Rule Does Not Apply Because the Jury’s\n                  Verdict Did Not Award Damages for an “Indivisible” Injury.\n         The one satisfaction rule also requires an indivisible injury common to the\n\nwrongdoing of the liable and settling defendants. Sterling, 822 S.W.2d at 7;\n\nLanders, 248 S.W.2d at 734. The one satisfaction rule is inapplicable in this case\n\nalso because the damages were not for an “indivisible” injury as the trial court\n\nsupposed. (2SCR1599-1600; App. C). “Under the one satisfaction rule, the non-\n\nsettling defendant may only claim a credit based on the damages for which all\n\ntortfeasors are jointly liable.” Crown Life Ins. Co. v. Casteel, 22 S.W.3d 378, 391\n\n(Tex. 2000). Where the jury charge limits its inquiry to damages caused by the\n\nnon-settling defendant, there is no basis for application of the one satisfaction rule.\n\nRobertson v.

(holding that because the\n\nfinder of fact, an arbitrator, “did not award any damages against the non-settling\n\ndefendant for any of the alleged damage he plaintiffs claimed was caused by the\n\nalleged settling defendant, there could be no violation of the one-satisfaction rule if\n\n\n\n                                          39\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\fthe [plaintiffs] received compensation on those claims from [the settling\n\ndefendant].”).\n\n         The jury was not asked to and did not assess damages to the Project as a\n\nwhole. Rather it was asked to assess only those damages for the Architect’s\n\nparticular breach.\n\n         What sum of money, if any, if paid now in cash, would fairly and\n         reasonably compensate [RLJ] for its damages, if any, that resulted\n         from [the Architect’s] failure to comply with the Architectural\n         Contract that you found in answer to Question[] 2 [concerning the\n         required structural engineering services]?\n\n(CR1127; App. B; emphasis added). The trial court acknowledged the narrow\n\nfocus of this question in its letter ruling.\n\n         The damage question in the Charge asked for damages “due to [the\n         Architect’s] failure to comply.” The question had to ask specifically\n         about damages resulting from [the Architect’s] failure to inquire about\n         cause-in-fact.\n\n(2SCR1599; App. B; emphasis in original). Nevertheless, the trial court concluded\n\nspecification of the particular party and contractual breach did “not mean, without\n\nmore, that the damages found were divisible and attributable only to [the\n\nArchitect].” (2SCR1599; App. B).\n\n                  a.       The Charge Submitted Apportioned Damages.\n         The trial court’s analysis is irreconcilable with the principle that, without a\n\nsufficient charge objection to the question’s form, the effect of the answer is\n\nmeasured by the question actually asked, not the question that ought to have been\n\n                                               40\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\fasked.

Peca, 12 S.W.3d 31, 55 (Tex. 2000).\n\nThe Architect did not object to the damages question’s form, and never objected\n\nthat the question was improperly limited to those damages caused by the\n\nArchitect’s breach of its own contract. The Architect only complained there was no\n\nlegally and factually sufficient evidence to support a damage award. 8 (9RR140,\n\n143-44, 153).\n\n                           1)   The Plain Language of the Question Asked\n                                Determines What the Jury Found.\n         Absent objection, whether the damages were necessarily attributable to the\n\nArchitect alone is governed by the plain meaning of the language in the question.\n\nSee Reliant Energy Servs., Inc. v. Cotton Valley Compression, L.L.C., 336 S.W.3d\n\n764, 788 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2011, no pet.). This presumption applies\n\nwhenever the charge does not include a different definition.

The Architect filed no new trial motion.\n\n                                                41\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\fquestion limits the subject of the jury’s consideration, the court must presume\n\ncompliance unless the record shows otherwise. See Columbia Rio Grande\n\nHealthcare, L.P. v. Hawley, 284 S.W.3d 851, 861-62 (Tex. 2009).\n\n         Under circumstances similar to those here, in Tesfa v. Stewart, 135 S.W.3d\n\n272, 273 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2004, pet. denied), the court held that this\n\npresumption applied to discharge a segregation requirement when the question\n\nasked the amount of damages “for injuries prior to [plaintiff’s] death, if any, that\n\nreasonably resulted from” the doctor’s negligence. The case was one for medical\n\nmalpractice case during treatment of auto accident injuries. The doctor did not\n\nobject to the form of the question but nonetheless asserted the charge did not\n\nsegregate damages caused in the auto collision from those caused by the alleged\n\nmalpractice. Id. at 274. Finding nothing to rebut the presumption of compliance,\n\nthe court held the jury’s damages finding was “limited in accordance with the trial\n\ncourt’s express instruction” and determined damages “for injuries attributable to\n\nDr. Tesfa’s negligence alone.” Id. at 279.\n\n                           2)   The Plain Language of the Question Limited Damages\n                                to Those Resulting from the Architect’s “[F]ailure to\n                                [C]omply [W]ith the Architectural Contract.”\n         Concerning the effect of the damages finding, this case is indistinguishable\n\nfrom Tesfa. The damages question here clearly limited its inquiry to the Architect’s\n\n“failure to comply with the Architectural Contract ….” (CR1127; App. B).\n\n\n                                             42\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\fSimilarly, in Hunt, 739 S.W.2d at 940, an owner sued an architect for design\n\ndeficiencies and various contractors for construction defects in a parking deck. All\n\nbut the Architect settled before trial. Id. at 935. The Architect claimed credit under\n\nthe one satisfaction rule. The damages question was:\n\n         What sum of money, if any, if paid now in cash will fully compensate\n         [the owner] for any permanent diminution in market value of [the\n         shopping center and office complex] which was caused by the acts or\n         omissions of the defendant(s), despite the completion of all reasonable\n         repair procedures?\n\n(Id.; emphasis in original). The Architect urged that the question permitted a\n\ndouble recovery because it included damages for the settled claims. Id. at 940. The\n\ncourt denied the credit because\n\n         the jury compensated [the owner] only for the separate wrong … by\n         [the Architect’s] breach of []its duties …. [T]he consideration received\n         under the prior settlement compensated [the owner] for acts and\n         omissions of others…. [The Architect] was not a party to the\n         settlement agreement. Therefore, the present case presents the\n         situation where each wrongdoer pays separately for its own acts or\n         omissions.\n\n(Id.; emphasis added).\n\n         Similarly, in Robertson v. ADJ Partnership, Ltd., 204 S.W.3d at 485, the\n\ncourt held that where the jury charge limits its inquiry to damages caused by the\n\nnon-settling defendant, there is no basis for application of the one satisfaction rule.\n\nThe same conclusion was reached in Byer Custom Builders v. Franks, 389 S.W.3d\n\nat 881. In that case, the finder of fact, an arbitrator, “did not award any damages\n\n\n                                           43\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\fagainst the [non-settling defendant] for any of the alleged damage the [plaintiffs]\n\nclaimed was caused by [the alleged settling defendant], there could be no violation\n\nof the one-satisfaction rule if the [plaintiffs] received compensation on those\n\nclaims from [the settling defendant].”\n\n         Like the damages questions in Tesfa, Hunt and Robertson, the plain\n\nlanguage of the damage question here removed any possibility the damages\n\nincluded those for breaches of a different contract or party. For this reason alone,\n\nthere could have been no finding of damages common to those caused by the\n\nSettling Defendants.\n\n         Contrast these decisions with Allan v. Nersesova, 307 S.W.3d 564, 574 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Dallas 2010, no pet.), penned by CTTI’s author. In Nersesova,\n\n         the jury charge contained a single damages question for damages\n         “resulting from the occurrences in question.” The jury did not make\n         separate damages findings for the negligence and breach-of-contract\n         claims. [Plaintiff]’s injuries, as found by the jury, included the\n         damage to her unit and personal property and the additional living\n         expenses she incurred. [Plaintiff] alleged these injuries were caused\n         by both the settling defendants and appellees. Nothing in the\n         settlement agreement shows the settlement amount was for anything\n         other than the damages found by the jury. If appellees were not given\n         credit for the settlement, [the Plaintiff] would receive a double\n         recovery for her injuries.\n\nId. (emphasis added); accord Western Technologies, Inc. v. All-American Golf\n\nCenter, Inc., 139 P.3d 858, 862 (Nev. 2006) (charge did not limit damages to those\n\ncaused by a particular party’s breaches; presumed the jury awarded all damages\n\n\n                                          44\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\fsustained from all parties’ breaches). A verdict that allocates damages eliminates\n\nany risk of double recovery. See Duncan v. Cessna Aircraft Co., 665 S.W.2d 414,\n\n431 (Tex. 1984). The damage question here itself allocated damages; a “double\n\nrecovery” was impossible.\n\n                  b.       The Jury Was Asked To Apportion and\n                           in Fact Apportioned Damages.\n         The Architect, not RLJ, is getting the double dip here. The Architect invited\n\nthe jury in closing argument for, and in fact received, a damages reduction in the\n\njury verdict before obtaining another by raising the one satisfaction rule for the\n\nfirst time post-verdict. 9 Counsel for both parties urged the jury in closing\n\narguments to adjust its damages award. RLJ suggested without objection that the\n\njury could and should make a 20% reduction for the damages attributable to the\n\nSettling Defendants. (10RR29). In light of the evidence, the jury clearly limited the\n\ndamages to those caused by the Architect. The Architect went further, suggesting\n\nthe jury “in Question 3 … answer zero” if it believed “there’s no causal\n\nconnection” between the Architect’s breaches and RLJ’s damages. (10RR54). The\n\nArchitect devoted much of its argument faulting Terracon for the too-light\n\n\n9\n  RLJ’s evidence supported damages in excess of $7 million. (7RR48; 9RR123-124, 136;\n7RR16-18, 26-39; 3RR133-136; PX-151, 16RR1-1145; 10RR29-31). Had the architect pleaded\nthe one satisfaction rule or asserted it before submission to the jury, RLJ could have elected to\nsubmit damages based on the total amount of all damages and risk the application of one\nsatisfaction rule. It did not have this option, however, because the architect first asserted that it\nwas entitled to settlement credit under the one satisfaction rule long after the jury returned its\nverdict.\n\n                                                 45\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\ffoundation design and urging the reasonableness of its blind reliance on Terracon’s\n\nwork. (10RR36-39, 44-48, 50-51). The jury clearly understood from both the\n\ncharge and closing arguments it should limit damages to those specifically caused\n\nby the Architect’s breach.10\n\n         The jury usually may decide causation when general experience and\n\ncommon sense enable a layperson to fairly determine that relationship between\n\nevent and result. Pilgrim’s Pride Corp. v. Smoak, 134 S.W.3d 880, 894 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Texarkana 2004, pet. denied). The damages awarded were significantly\n\nreduced from the total costs of repair and residual diminution in value. RLJ\n\nprovided evidence and sought over $7 million in total damages. (7RR48; 9RR123-\n\n124, 136; 7RR16-18, 26-39; 3RR133-136; PX-151, 16RR1-1145; 10RR29-31).\n\nThe jury awarded much less.\n\n         Indeed, the trial court commented on this reduction: “The source of RLJ’s\n\ndisappointment regarding damages is the jury verdict….” (2SCR1600; App. C).\n\nThe jury clearly used its skill and common sense to apportion damages. The jury\n\nwas asked to determine the amount that would fairly “compensate” RLJ for\n\n\n\n\n10\n   There can be no complaint that the jury’s apportionment was not sufficiently precise.\nSegregation by “rough percentage” is sufficient. Chapa, 212 S.W.3d at 314 n. 83; see, e.g.,\nStewart Title Guar. Co. v. Aiello, 941 S.W.2d 68, 73 (Tex. 1997) (testimony based on percentage\nof attorney and paralegal time); Med. Specialist Group, P.A. v. Radiology Assocs., L.L.P., 171\nS.W.3d 727, 738 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 2005, pet. denied) (fee segregation based\npercentage time attribution).\n\n                                              46\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\fdamages caused by the Architect. Applying a further reduction does not assure one\n\nsatisfaction; instead, it assures less than one satisfaction.\n\n         For all these reasons, the damages question required apportionment and the\n\njury’s verdict reflects the apportionment the charge required.\n\n         The jury was also asked to apportion damages by both parties. Based on the\n\nevidence and the trial court’s own observation, the jury must have responded to the\n\ninstructions of the Court and the party’s requests to do so. “[T]he reasoning of the\n\none recovery rule no longer applies” if the jury is “allow[ed] allocation of liability\n\nbetween the parties, even when the injury is indivisible.” Duncan, 665 S.W.2d at\n\n431 (emphasis added). The one satisfaction rule is not an insuperable barrier to\n\nplaintiff benefitting from a favorable settlement.\n\n         [T]he one recovery rule does not prevent … adopting a system that\n         reduces the plaintiff’s recovery and the non-settling defendants’\n         liability by the percentage of causation assigned to any tortfeasor with\n         whom plaintiff has settled. [Such reductions] leave defendants\n         unaffected by settlements in which they do not participate.... Allowing\n         plaintiffs to keep the excess from a good settlements may violate the\n         one recovery rule, but no one is harmed [if the jury allocates the\n         damages].\n\nId. at 432 (emphasis added). The same is no less true here. The charge permitted\n\nand the parties invited and the jury’s answer provided the necessary damage\n\nallocation. Therefore, “the reasoning of the one recovery rule no longer applies”\n\nand its application here cannot be justified. See Duncan, 665 S.W.2d at 431.\n\n\n\n                                            47\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\f         5.       No Right to Application of One Satisfaction Rule\n                  or Contribution Exists In Contract Cases In\n                  Light of Section 33.001.\n         RLJ acknowledges that there are some cases suggesting that tort liability\n\ndoes not necessarily have to be present in order for the one satisfaction rule to\n\napply. As we have demonstrated above, even assuming the rule could be applied in\n\na breach of contract case, the rule is inapplicable in the present case because there\n\nis no basis for joint and several contractual liability and because the damages found\n\nwere those resulting from the breach of contract by the Architect. RLJ would\n\nfurther show that the cases suggesting tort liability is not necessarily required are\n\ndistinguishable in light of a complete analysis of the authority relied upon to make\n\nthat suggestion. Moreover, the history and subsequent adoption of TEX. CIV. PRAC.\n\n& REM. CODE §33.0001 et seq., strongly suggests that the rule was applicable only\n\nin tort and was in any event abolished by the statutory scheme adopted in section\n\n33.001.\n\n         The Texas Supreme Court refused to permit the one satisfaction rule to\n\nprevent its adoption of a pure comparative causation scheme or requiring an\n\ninjured person to prove the precise damages caused by a particular defendant.\n\nLanders, 248 S.W.2d at 734; Duncan, 665 S.W.2d at 431-32. By statute,\n\ncontribution is allowed only among joint tortfeasors. Bonniwell v. Beech Aircraft\n\nCorp., 663 S.W.2d 816, 818 (Tex.1984); see also Merit Drilling Co. v. Honish,\n\n\n                                           48\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\f715 S.W.2d 87, 89 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 1986, writ ref’d n.r.e.) (suggesting\n\none satisfaction rule survived Duncan only to the extent necessary under former\n\narticle 2212a, now TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ch. 32).\n\n         As explained, the one satisfaction rule was created to address a problem\n\nunique to tort cases created by article 2212. GE Capital, 754 F.3d at 305; see V.\n\nB., supra. Indeed, the Texas Supreme Court has only applied the one satisfaction\n\nrule to joint tort liability. Id. at 306; Casteel, 22 S.W. 3d at 391-392 (“the non-\n\nsettling defendant may only claim a credit based on the damages for which all\n\ntortfeasors are jointly liable.”). This Court has suggested on more than one\n\noccasion that the credit is only available in tort cases. CTTI, 164 S.W.3d at 684;\n\nPaschall v. Peevey, 813 S.W.2d 710, 712 (Tex. App.—Austin 1991, writ denied)\n\n(“The non-settling tortfeasor may only claim a credit based on the damages for\n\nwhich all tortfeasors are jointly liable.”).\n\n         RLJ is aware there are cases stating “the absence of tort liability does not\n\npreclude the application of the one satisfaction rule.” See, e.g., Hudspeth v. Enter.\n\nLife Ins. Co., 358 S.W.3d 373, 383 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist. 2011, no pet.);\n\nAMX Enters., Inc. v. Bank One, N.A., 196 S.W.3d 202, 206 (Tex. App.—Houston\n\n[1st Dist.] 2006, pet. denied). Insofar as research reveals, this proposition first\n\nappeared in Oyster Creek Fin. Corp. v. Richwood Investments II, Inc., 176 S.W.3d\n\n307, 327 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2004, pet. denied). The only support\n\n\n                                               49\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\fOyster Creek cited, however, was the per curiam opinion in El Paso Natural Gas\n\nCo. v. Berryman, 858 S.W.2d 362, 364 (Tex. 1993). However, Berryman involved\n\nwhether an alleged alter ego could be liable for a judgment against a corporate\n\nentity after the corporation’s settlement extinguished the judgment. Id. at 326. The\n\nalter ego doctrine applies when there is such unity between two entities that they\n\nare, in law, are one and the same. See Mancorp, Inc. v. Culpepper, 802 S.W.2d\n\n226, 228 (Tex. 1990); Hoffmann v. Dandurand, 180 S.W.3d 340, 347 (Tex. App.—\n\nDallas 2005, no pet.). Berryman did not involve any question of joint liability\n\nbetween two different parties, but rather whether there was any liability remaining\n\nagainst what was, in legal effect, the same party. Thus, Berryman did not involve\n\nan application of the one satisfaction rule at all and cannot support its application\n\nin non-tort cases.\n\n         This conclusion is further confirmed by the legislative history of section\n\n33.012 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code. Chapters 32 and 33 codify\n\nnot only contribution rights, but also the common-law one satisfaction doctrine. In\n\ndoing so, the Legislature explicitly limited the application of the one satisfaction\n\nrule generally to tort and DTPA cases. TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE §§32.001\n\n(“applies only to tort actions;” 33.002 applies to any cause of action based on tort\n\nor any action under the DTPA).\n\n\n\n\n                                         50\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\f         It follows from the plain language of the statute that when the Legislature\n\ngenerally limited contribution and settlement credits to tort cases, it precluded\n\nother common-law contribution and settlement credits in other cases. When the\n\nLegislature expressly provides for an exclusive remedy, it pre-empts the common\n\nlaw. Coleman v. United Savings Ass’n of Texas, 846 S.W.2d 128, 132 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Fort Worth 1993, no writ).\n\n         For example, when the Legislature abolished the common law equitable trust\n\nfund theory for pre-dissolution claims to protect corporate directors, officers and\n\nshareholders, the Texas Supreme Court ruled that the statute preclude further\n\napplication of the previous common law doctrine. Hunter v. Fort Worth Capital\n\nCorp., 620 S.W.2d 547, 551 (Tex. 1981). Part of the court’s reasoning was that\n\napplication of the doctrine outside the restrictions imposed by the statute would\n\nrender the statute meaningless and impermissibly presume the Legislature intended\n\nto do something that was effectively useless. Id.\n\n         The same is no less true here. Chapters 32 and 33 and their rules for\n\nsettlement credits are explicitly limited to tort and DTPA claims. If the Legislature\n\nhad intended to include other claims, it could have easily done so. By not including\n\nbreach of contract actions, it must be presumed that the Legislature intended to\n\nlimit application of the one satisfaction rule to the cases and methods specified in\n\nthe statute.\n\n\n                                          51\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\f         Legislative history confirms this intent. In 2005, the Legislature enacted\n\nSenate Bill 890 to amend section 33.0012 to restore the dollar-for-dollar credit.\n\nThis credit was eliminated in 2003 when the Legislature enacted “tort reform” by\n\nadopting House Bill 4. Senate Bill 890 was accompanied by a statement of intent\n\nfrom the author and sponsor stating,\n\n         Since the 1930s, Texas has recognized that an injured party is entitled\n         to recover only once for an injury. (Bradshaw v. Baylor, 126 Tex. 99,\n         101; 84 S.W.2d 703, 704 (1935)). The “one-satisfaction” rule was\n         codified by the Legislature in Chapter 33, Civil Practice and\n         Remedies Code, in 1987…. The settlement credit scheme created by\n         H.B. 4 eliminates the one-satisfaction rule that has been part of\n         Texas law for more than 70 years, except in medical liability cases.\n\nSenate Committee on State Affairs, Bill Analysis, Tex. S.B. 890, 79th Leg. R.S.\n\n(2005) and Senate Committee on State Affairs, Bill Analysis, Tex. C.S.S.B. 890,\n\n79th Leg. R.S.(2005) (emphasis added); available at Capitol Research Services.,\n\nThe Legislative History of Tex. S.B. 890, 79th Leg., R.S. (2005), Regarding\n\nSettlement Credit 20, 82, 89 (App. I).\n\n         The Legislature’s declaration that the 2003 tort reform bill “eliminate[d]”\n\nthe common-law one satisfaction rule confirms that, except as permitted by statute,\n\nthe common-law one satisfaction rule had otherwise been “eliminate[d]” when\n\nHouse Bill 4 was passed. Its continued application by the courts outside the scope\n\nof chapters 32 and 33 is legally erroneous. The error is understandable because the\n\ncourts were likely unaware of the not-readily-available declaration of Legislative\n\n\n                                           52\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\fintent in the legislative history of the statute. Thus, they naturally continued to\n\nresort to case law antedating H.B.4 without fully appreciating the historical reason\n\nwhy the one satisfaction rule was developed or fully realizing that chapters 32 and\n\n33 of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code supplanted the common-law one\n\nsatisfaction rule after September 1, 2003. It is, nonetheless, erroneous to apply the\n\none satisfaction rule outside the statutory parameters of chapters 32 and 33.\n\n         6.       Applying the One Satisfaction Rule in Contractual\n                  Liability Cases Impairs Contract Obligations In\n                  Violation of Texas Constitution Article I, §16.\n    Applying the one satisfaction rule outside tort cases where it is ostensibly still\n\nnecessary threatens to impair contractual obligations in violation of article I, §16 of\n\nthe Texas Constitution.\n\n                  a.       Texas Public Policy Strongly Favors Freedom of Contract.\n         The Texas Supreme Court has “long recognized Texas’ strong public policy\n\nin favor of preserving the freedom of contract.” Fairfield Insurance Co. v.\n\nStephens Martin Paving, LP, 246 S.W.3d 653, 664 (Tex. 2004). This\n\nconstitutionally guaranteed contractual freedom strongly favors the parties’ right to\n\n“bargain for mutually agreeable terms and [to] allocate risks as they see fit.” Gym-\n\nN-1 Playgrounds, Inc. v. Snider, 220 S.W.3d 905, 912 (Tex. 2007). It outweighs\n\ncourt-created general policies, such as that prohibiting insuring punitive damages.\n\nFairfield Insurance Co., 246 S.W.3d at 664.\n\n\n                                              53\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\f         [I]f there is one thing which more than another public policy requires\n         it is that [persons] of full age and competent understanding shall have\n         the utmost liberty of contracting, and that their contracts when entered\n         into freely and voluntarily shall be held sacred and shall be enforced\n         by Courts of justice. Therefore, you have this paramount public policy\n         to consider – that you are not lightly to interfere with this freedom of\n         contract.\n\nWood Motor Co. v. Nebel, 150 Tex. 86, 238 S.W.2d 181, 185 (1951) (quoting\n\nPrinting & Numerical Registering Co. v. Sampson, LR 19 Eq 462, 465, 1874 WL\n\n16322 (1875)). This freedom outweighs application in contract cases of a judicial\n\ndoctrine to remedy a conundrum unique to tort actions.\n\n                  b.       The One Satisfaction Rule Impermissibly Impairs\n                           Contractual Obligations.\n         Whether a law violates the freedom of contract depends on three-part test:\n\n(1) it must not substantially impair a contractual relationship; (2) it “must have a\n\nsignificant and legitimate purpose behind the regulation, such as the remedying of\n\na broad and general social or economic problem”; and (3) it must be reasonable\n\nand appropriate for its intended purpose. Energy Reserves Group v. Kansas Power\n\n& Light, 459 U.S. 400, 410, 411-13 (1983).\n\n         The one satisfaction rule cannot satisfy the first test because it substantially\n\nimpairs a contractual relationship. It effectively takes from the injured party the\n\nbenefit of its settlement with another defendant to reduce the wrongdoer’s liability.\n\nSee, e.g., Langever v. Miller, 124 Tex. 80, 76 S.W.2d 1025, 1028 (1934) (law\n\nreducing collectible amount of deficiency judgments to difference between actual\n\n                                             54\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\fproperty value and foreclosure price void as a substantial contractual impairment).\n\nIn contract cases, the one satisfaction rule’s reduction of damages by credit for\n\nanother’s settlement substantially and unconstitutionally impairs contractual\n\nfreedom. It also creates, as applied here, a disincentive to settle, which is contrary\n\nto the strong Texas public policy in favor of settlements.\n\n                  c.       Freedom of Contract Outweighs One Satisfaction’s\n                           Questionable Objectives.\n    The Texas Supreme Court has refused to accept that preventing recovery of\n\nmore than the jury’s damage assessment is a more important than preventing a\n\nwrongdoer from escaping its full liability. Landers, 248 S.W.2d at 734. It justified\n\noverruling Bradshaw’s one satisfaction rule the extent it conflicted with its creation\n\nof a purely comparative negligence system because the one satisfaction rule\n\nunfairly allowed the non-settling defendant to unfairly “benefit from a generous\n\nsettlement in which they refused to participate” for this reason. Duncan, 665\n\nS.W.2d at 431. It recognized that settlement consideration includes benefits other\n\nthan relief from paying damages. Id. “There is no conceptual inconsistency in\n\nallowing a plaintiff to recover more from a settlement or partial settlement than he\n\ncould receive as damages.” Id. “Plaintiffs will benefit from good settlements and\n\nbear the risk of bad ones, just as they do in single-tortfeasor cases. Allowing\n\nplaintiffs to keep the excess from a good settlements may violate the one recovery\n\n\n\n                                             55\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\frule, but no one is harmed” when the jury apportions liability. Allowing plaintiffs\n\nto keep the excess from a good settlement is not overpayment of damages.\n\n         The one satisfaction rule has a questionable objective based on questionable\n\nreasoning. It ought to be and is trumped by the freedom of contract guarantee in\n\nTexas Constitution article I, §16.\n\n         7.       The Architect Is Procedurally Barred From Asserting the\n                  One Satisfaction Rule.\n\n                  a.       Waived by Failure to Specially Except.\n         The Architect’s post-verdict motion urging credit under the one satisfaction\n\nrule for the first time asserted “Plaintiff’s damages resulted from ‘the breaches of\n\ncontract’ Plaintiffs alleged were committed by [all remaining defendants]” and that\n\nRLJ failed to allocate those damages. (CR1174). Complaint about the damages\n\nallegations was waived by failure to urge them in writing before charge\n\nsubmission. TEX. R. CIV. P. 90; Bullock v. Regular Veteran’s Ass’n of U.S., 806\n\nS.W.2d 311, 314 (Tex. App.—Austin 1991, no writ).\n\n                  b.       Waived by Failure to Request Question or Instruction.\n         Neither did the Architect object to the charge on this ground. Failure to\n\nobject to the charge’s failure to segregate failure to request an instruction requiring\n\nallocation waives complaint about failure to segregate. TEX. R. CIV. P. 278 (failure\n\nto request properly worded question); see Dick’s Last Resort of West End, Inc. v.\n\nMarket/Ross, Ltd., 273 S.W.3d 905, 919 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2008, pet. denied);\n\n\n                                              56\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\fMcCarty v. Wani Venture, A.S., 251 S.W.3d 573, 585 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st\n\nDist.] 2007, pet. denied) (failure to request instruction).\n\n                  c.       Waived By Failure to Plead as an Affirmative Defense.\n         A party must affirmatively plead “accord and satisfaction, arbitration and\n\naward, … discharge in bankruptcy, … payment, release … and any other matter\n\nconstituting an avoidance or affirmative defense.” TEX. R. CIV. P. 94. Each of these\n\ninvolves prior payment or other discharge that is waived if not pleaded. Bejjani v.\n\nTRC Servs., Inc., No. 14-08-00750-CV, 2009 WL 3856924, at *5 (Tex. App.—\n\nHouston [14th Dist.] Nov. 19, 2009, no pet.) (right to offset); Sugar Land Props.,\n\nInc. v. Becnel, 26 S.W.3d 113, 121 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2000, no pet.)\n\n(payment of medical expenses). Settlement credit under the one satisfaction rule,\n\nthough not specifically named, is an “other matter constituting an avoidance or\n\naffirmative defense” that must be pleaded. This Court specifically acknowledged\n\nthat the one satisfaction rule is in the nature of an affirmative defense. RenewData\n\nCorp. v. eMag Solutions, LLC, No. 03–05–00509–CV, 2009 WL 1255583, at *1 n.\n\n1 (Tex. App.—Austin May 6, 2009, pet. denied) (mem. op.; unasserted one\n\nsatisfaction rule could not be considered as alternative summary judgment ground);\n\naccord Pagosa Oil & Gas, L.L.C. v. Marrs & Smith P’ship, 323 S.W.3d 203, 217\n\n(Tex. App.—El Paso 2010, pet. denied); Brewer & Pritchard, P.C. v. AMKO Res.\n\nInt’l, LLC, No. 14-13-00113-CV, 2014 WL 3512836, at *1 (Tex.

Cases holding otherwise are\n\nirreconcilable with rule 94 because the opponent must be notified of the need to\n\nprove damages allocation plus the elements of the asserted claims. See Dalworth\n\nRestoration, Inc. v. Rife-Marshall, 433 S.W.3d 773, 783-84 (Tex. App.—Fort\n\nWorth 2014. pet. dism’d w.o.j.). The Architect did not plead this affirmative\n\ndefense (CR46-79; App. H) and RLJ was given no notice or opportunity to present\n\nevidence meeting any allocation requirement before the jury was discharged.\n\n                  d.       Barred By Laches.\n         The post-verdict assertion of the one settlement rule is also precluded by\n\nlaches. The one satisfaction rule developed as an equitable principle, Sterling, 822\n\nS.W.2d at 6, subject to equitable defenses. See Brewer v. Nationsbank of Texas,\n\nN.A., 28 S.W.3d 801 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 2000, no writ), and is subject to\n\nequitable defense for unreasonable delay and another’s good faith detrimental\n\nchange in position. See City of Fort Worth v. Johnson, 388 S.W.2d 400, 403 (Tex.\n\n1964). By the Architect’s failure to raise the one satisfaction rule prior to verdict,\n\nRLJ had no reason whatsoever to anticipate any need to adduce any evidence\n\nsegregating damages. Similarly, the Architect waived any argument on the one\n\nsatisfaction rule by specifically asking the jury to apportion damages and award\n\nonly those damages caused by the Architect. (10RR54-56).\n\n\n\n\n                                               58\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\f         For any one or all of the foregoing reasons, the one satisfaction rule did not\n\nand could not apply to reduce the Architect’s liability to RLJ. The trial court erred\n\nin concluding otherwise. Accordingly, the judgment must be reformed to restore\n\nrecovery for the damages awarded by the jury together with interest.\n\nB.       No Segregation of Attorney’s Fees Was Required.\n         RLJ sought its reasonable and necessary attorney’s fees under chapter 38 of\n\nthe Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code. (CR201; App. A). The parties agreed\n\nto submit the attorney’s fees claim to the court rather than the jury. After the jury’s\n\nverdict, RLJ moved for its attorney’s fees and submitted its proof by affidavit and\n\nsupporting documents showing RLJ expended a total of $1,388,019 in reasonable\n\nand necessary attorney’s fees to prosecute the breach of contract claims against the\n\nArchitect, Soils Engineer, and the General Contractor. (3SCR3-611; 2SCR1603-\n\n05).\n\n         However, the trial court determined for purposes of attorney’s fees it was\n\nnecessary to segregate those expended on RLJ’s claim against the Architect from\n\nthose on its claims against the Settling Defendants. (CR1711; App. D). The trial\n\ncourt awarded attorney’s fees attributable to the prosecution of the breach of\n\ncontract claim against the Architect only, even though it considered the damages\n\n“indivisible.” (CR1711; 2SCR1600; App. C, D). Accordingly, of the $1,388,019 in\n\nattorney’s fees for presenting all its contract claims, the trial court allowed RLJ\n\n\n                                           59\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\fonly $901,650.96 as fees attributable to the contract claim against the Architect\n\nonly. (CR1711; App. D). RLJ timely moved conditionally to modify the judgment\n\nso that, if the one satisfaction rule applied, it could recover its unsegregated\n\nattorney’s fees for breach of contract claims against the Architect and the Settling\n\nDefendants. (CR1747-48). The trial court denied this motion. (CR1905).\n\n         RLJ continues to maintain that the one satisfaction rule does not apply. If\n\nand only if this Court decides otherwise, RLJ was not obliged to segregate its\n\nattorney’s fees for the breach of contract claims against the Architect from those\n\nfor the breach of contract claims against the Settling Defendants.\n\n         1.       There Is No Need to Segregate Fees For\n                  Claims Requiring Proof of the Same Facts.\n         Generally, reasonable and necessary attorney’s fees requires proof of the\n\nfees incurred for suit on a claim for which such fees are recoverable. Sterling, 822\n\nS.W.2d at 10. If the causes of action depend upon the same facts or circumstances,\n\nthey may be “intertwined to the point of being inseparable.” Id. Attorney’s fees\n\nshould be allowed for inseparable claims even if some issues also relate to matters\n\nfor which attorney’s fees are not recoverable, Aiello, 941 S.W.2d at 73; Sterling,\n\n822 S.W.2d at 11, provided the underlying services advance both. Chapa, 212\n\nS.W.3d at 314.\n\n         Whether fees can be segregated is a mixed question of law and fact. Tony\n\nGullo Motors I, L.P. v. Chapa, 212 S.W.3d 299, 303 (Tex. 2006). For example,\n\n                                           60\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\fwhen an attorney testified that the issue common to all claims was the right of\n\ncontrol over a corporation, this Court deemed the recoverable and unrecoverable\n\nclaims so interrelated that it was unnecessary to segregate fees. Fortenberry v.\n\nCavanaugh, No. 03-07-00310-CV, 2008 WL 4997568, at *12 (Tex. App.—Austin\n\nNov. 26, 2008, pet. denied) (mem. op.).\n\n         2.       If the One Satisfaction Rule Applies, It Requires\n                  Proof of Breach of the Same Promised Performance\n                  and an Indivisible Injury.\n         The one satisfaction rule may apply in contract case only if there was a joint\n\nand several contractual liability, which in turn requires a promise of the same\n\nperformance by the settling and liable defendants, see V.A.3., supra., and an\n\nindivisible injury. See V.A.4., supra. If the Architect and Settling Defendants\n\nbreached a promise for the same performance causing an indivisible injury, then\n\nthe activities of RLJ’s attorneys to prove the Settling Defendants’ liability would\n\nhave necessarily also served as proof of the Architect’s liability. If the one\n\nsatisfaction rule applies at all, no segregation could have been required.\n\n         3.       Alternatively, If Proof of Indivisible Injury Alone is\n                  Enough for the Application of the One Satisfaction\n                  Rule, Segregation of Fees Was Still Not Required.\n         Regardless of whether the one satisfaction rule otherwise applies, if the trial\n\ncourt correctly determined that there was an indivisible injury or damages in this\n\ncase for purposes of the one-satisfaction analysis, then segregation of fees was not\n\n\n                                             61\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\frequired. The Architect, General Contractor and Soils Engineer undertook different\n\nduties. (CR192-93, 197-98, 200-01, 205-18). For these breaches to coalesce in an\n\n“indivisible” injury would necessarily require RLJ to have proved each breach to\n\nestablish the full scope of its damages.\n\n         “Where the tortious acts of two or more wrongdoers join to produce an\n\nindivisible injury, … all of the wrongdoers will be held jointly and severally liable\n\nfor the entire damages ….”. Landers, 248 S.W.2d at 734 (1952). If the one\n\nsatisfaction rule applies at all and if only an indivisible injury is required, as the\n\ntrial court reasoned, the breaches of the Settling Defendants were sufficiently\n\nconjoined with those of the Architect, then proof of the harm resulting from the\n\nbreaches of the Settling Defendants were also essential and no segregation was\n\nrequired.\n\n                           VI.   CONCLUSION AND PRAYER\n         For the foregoing reasons, RLJ asks the Court to:\n\n         1) reverse the trial court’s judgment applying the one satisfaction rule and\n\ndelete the credit for the amount of the Settling Defendants’ settlements;\n\n         2) if and only if the one satisfaction rule applies, reverse the trial court’s\n\njudgment concerning the award of attorney’s fees and either reform it to award\n\nRLJ unsegregated fees or remand the case to the trial court solely for a\n\n\n\n\n                                           62\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\fdetermination of reasonable and necessary attorney’s fees for the prosecution of all\n\ncontract claims against the Architect, and the Settling Defendants; and\n\n         3) any one or more of 1) – 2) above subject to the conditions prescribed. RLJ\n\nfurther requests such other relief to which they are justly entitled, provided such\n\nrelief requested does not include a retrial on the merits of its claims against the\n\nArchitect.\n\n                                                Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                                MUNSCH HARDT KOPF & HARR PC\n\n\n                                                /s/ Michael W.

VENUE AND JURISDICTION\n\n         12.      Venue is proper in Travis County, Texas under Texas Civil Practice & Remedies\n\nCode Ann. §§ 15.002(a)(1), 15.005, 15.011, 15.035 and 15.092 (a) & (b), which require that this\n\nsuit be brought in the county where the Project (as defined below) is located.\n\n         13.      Defendants ESG, Swenson, EBCO, Terracon, Swoboda, MBA, DaVinci,\n\nBridgeview, and Champion are either residents of Texas or purposely availed themselves to the\n\njurisdiction of Texas by entering into contracts involving real property and improvements to real\n\nproperty in Texas and/or by signing and sealing plans, specifications, or other reports for real\n\nproperty or constructing improvements to real property in Texas that is the subject of this\n\nlawsuit. Furthermore, assumption of jurisdiction by Texas would not offend traditional notions\n\nof fair play and substantial justice. Finally, RLJ's damages are within the jurisdictional limits of\n\nthis court and do not exceed $10,000,000.00.\n\n                                                IV. FACTS\n\n         14.      This action arises from construction of the Courtyard Austin Airport Hotel located\n\nat 7809 East Ben White Boulevard in Austin, Texas (the \"Project\").\n\n         15.      As set forth below, Plaintiffs assert the following:\n\n                  a.       Breach of contract against EBCO, ESG, Swenson, Terracon, and\n                           Swoboda;\n\n                  b.       Suit for declaratory relief against Terracon;\n\n                  c.       Breach of warranty against EBCO;\n\n                  d.       Equitable subrogation against EBCO, ESG, Swenson, MBA, Terracon,\n                           Swoboda, DaVinci, Bridgeview, and Champion, including a direct\n                           equitable subrogation claim, and equitable subrogation claims for breach\n                           of contract, negligence, negligent undertaking, and negligent\n                           misrepresentation that were directly assigned, or assigned as a matter of\n                           law, to RLJ; and\n\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs' Seventh Amended Original Petition                                                 Page 4\nMHDocs 4896391 1 12690.2\n\n                                                                                                       187\n\f                  e.       A tort/negligence claim against EBCO for breach of a fiduciary duty\n                           arising from EBCO's failure to construct the Project in a manner\n                           consistent with the owner's interests and with the contract documents,\n                           which are the source of the fiduciary duty.\n\n         16.      Except for MBA, DaVinci, Bridgeview, and Champion, Defendants all entered\n\ninto valid and enforceable contracts with the Project's developer, White Lodging Services Corp.\n\n(\"White\"), to perform the services listed below.\n\n         17.      White, as developer, delivered and assigned the Project, the contracts, fiduciary\n\nduties, intangibles and all of the warranties, representations, and causes of action related thereto,\n\nto a White affiliate, South Ausaircourt, L.P., as owner (\"Ausaircourt\").           Ausaircourt then\n\nassigned the Project, the contracts, fiduciary duties, intangibles, and all of the warranties,\n\nrepresentations, and causes of action related thereto, to RLJ Lodging, which purchased the\n\nProject, and then assigned its rights and obligations under the Project contracts to RLJ Austin.\n\n         18.      EBCO was the general contractor and/or construction manager on the Project.\n\nEBCO performed work on the Project, and also retained subcontractors who performed work on\n\nthe Project.     EBCO and its subcontractors failed to construct the Project free from defects,\n\nincluding, but not limited to, the following:\n\n         (a) Failed to construct the Project foundation free from defect or in compliance\n         with the Project plans and specifications, including missing beams and improper\n         placement of wire reinforcing mesh. Plaintiffs allege that the damage from this\n         negligent work began to occur during construction and continues to this day.\n         Plaintiffs also allege that not only was the foundation itself damaged, but this\n         negligent work caused significant damage to other component parts of the\n         Project;\n\n         (b) Failed to provide \"select fill\" soils which complied with the Project\n         specifications. Plaintiffs allege that the damage from this negligent work began\n         to occur during construction and continues to this day. Plaintiffs also allege that\n         this negligent work caused significant damage to other component parts of the\n         Project;\n\n         (c) Failed to construct the pool and its drains free from defect. Plaintiffs allege\n         that the damage from this negligent work began to occur during construction and\n\nPlaintiffs' Seventh Amended Original Petition                                                  Page 5\nMHDocs 4896391 1 12690.2\n\n                                                                                                        188\n\f         continues to this day. Plaintiffs also allege that not only was the pool itself\n         damaged but this negligent work caused significant damage to other component\n         parts of the Project;\n\n         (d) Failed to construct the under-slab plumbing free from defect. Plaintiffs\n         allege that the damages from this negligent work began to occur during\n         construction and continues to this day. Plaintiffs also allege that this negligent\n         work caused damage to other component parts of the Project; and\n\n         (e) Failed to construct the Project site work in a manner consistent with the\n         Project plans and specifications. Plaintiffs allege that the damages from this\n         negligent work began to occur during construction and continues to this day.\n         Plaintiffs also allege that not only was the site work itself damaged but this\n         negligent work caused significant damage to other component parts of the\n         Project.\n\n         19.      The terms of the contract between EBCO and White (the \"General Contract\")\n\ncreated a \"fiduciary relationship of trust and confidence.\" Pursuant to the General Contract,\n\nEBCO agreed to construct the Project free from defects in a \"manner consistent with the interests\n\nof the Owner.\"        EBCO failed to construct the Project free from defects and in a manner\n\nconsistent with the interests of the owner, thereby breaching its fiduciary duty, which is a tort in\n\nTexas. See Douglas v. Aztec Pet. Corp., 695 S.W.2d 312, 318 (Tex. App.-Tyler 1985, no writ).\n\n         20.      ESG contracted for architectural services with White (the \"Architectural\n\nContract\"), and Swenson signed and sealed the architectural plans and drawings for the Project.\n\nUnder the Architectural Contract, ESG agreed to, among other things, provide overall\n\narchitectural, civil, and structural engineering design, document preparation, and coordination for\n\nthe Project. This work was to be performed expeditiously and consistent with professional skill\n\nand care. Because Texas does not allow corporations to sign or seal architectural plans or\n\nspecifications, Swenson could not have been acting as an agent of ESG when he signed and\n\nsealed the architectural plans and drawings, as an agent can only act to the extent of the\n\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs' Seventh Amended Original Petition                                                 Page 6\nMHDocs 4896391 1 12690.2\n\n                                                                                                       189\n\fprincipal's legal authority. Therefore, ESG constructively assigned portions of the Architectural\n\nContract to Swenson, without first obtaining written consent from White.\n\n          21.     ESG consented to the assignment of the Architectural Contract between White\n\nand Ausaircourt, in writing.        This assignment provided Ausaircourt with all of the interests\n\nreferenced above, but none of the obligations.\n\n          22.     Pursuant to a written contract dated October 30, 2000 (the \"Geotechnical Study\n\nContract\"), HBC was retained to conduct a geotechnical engineering study (the \"Geotechnical\n\nEngineering Study\").        Swoboda signed, sealed, and submitted the Geotechnical Engineering\n\nStudy to White on November 21, 2000. Because Texas does not allow corporations to sign or\n\nseal architectural plans or specifications, Swoboda could not have been acting as an agent of\n\nHBC when he signed and sealed the Geotechnical Engineering Study, as an agent can only act to\n\nthe extent of the principal's legal authority. Therefore, HBC constructively assigned portions of\n\nthe Geotechnical Engineering Study contract to Swoboda, without first obtaining written consent\n\nfrom White.\n\n          23.     The Geotechnical Study Contract was completed sometime in late 2000 or early\n\n2001, when White made final payment to HBC for these services.\n\n          24.     Pursuant to an oral agreement or undertaking, which was separate and distinct\n\nfrom the Geotechnical Study Contract, Terracon provided geotechnical engineering services to\n\nWhite and its affiliates during construction of the Project in 2005 and after the Project's\n\ncompletion. No written contract for such services between Terracon and any White affiliate\n\nexists.\n\n          25.     Terracon entered into a written contract to provide materials testing and\n\nconstruction inspection services for the Project in 2005 (the \"Materials Testing Contract\").\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs' Seventh Amended Original Petition                                                  Page 7\nMHDocs 4896391 1 12690.2\n\n                                                                                                        190\n\f         26.      MBA performed the structural engineering for the Project and Andrew Marlin\n\nsigned and sealed the structural plans MBA provided to ESG.\n\n         27.      DaVinci constructed the Project pool pursuant to a subcontract between it and\n\nEBCO.\n\n         28.      Bridgeview constructed the Project plumbing system pursuant to a subcontract\n\nbetween it and EBCO.\n\n         29.      Champion provided site preparation services, labor, and materials pursuant to a\n\nsubcontract between it and EBCO.\n\n         30.      On March 16, 2006, PlaintiffRLJ Lodging entered into the \"New Hotels Purchase\n\nand Sale Agreement\" (the \"New Hotels PSA\") between Whiteco Industries, Inc., numerous\n\nsellers identified on Exhibit A of the PSA, and White. This PSA was one of two PSA's executed\n\nconcerning the purchase of the Project and 99 other similar projects.       One PSA concerned\n\nprojects that were already constructed, and the New Hotels PSA concerned projects, like the\n\nProject, that were in various stages of construction.\n\n         31.      Pursuant to the New Hotels PSA, Plaintiff RLJ Lodging was legally obligated to\n\ntake possession of the Project on or about December 20, 2007, a few months after it was\n\ncompleted.\n\n         32.      Plaintiffs noticed property damage, including foundation movement, a cracked\n\nswimming pool, cracks in the slab and grade, shifting door frames, cracks in partition walls, and\n\ndrainage issues on the perimeter of the building in the Project.\n\n         33.      EBCO, ESG, Swenson, Terracon, Swoboda, MBA, DaVinci, Bridgeview, and\n\nChampion provided services, labor, or materials that were defective, or deviated from the\n\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs' Seventh Amended Original Petition                                              Page 8\nMHDocs 4896391 1 12690.2\n\n                                                                                                    191\n\fapplicable standards of care, and that either caused, or contributed to cause, damages to the\n\nProject and RLJ.\n\n         34.      These defective and damaging serv1ces, labor or materials all had certain\n\ncharacteristics which prevented Plaintiffs from immediately discovering the damage, and it was\n\nnot until verifiable issues with the Project were physically made manifest that Plaintiffs knew of\n\nor should have known of the damages to the Project. As such, the Discovery Rule applies to\n\neffect accrual of all of Plaintiffs' causes of action.\n\n                                        V. CAUSES OF ACTION\n\nA.       Breach of Contract\n\n         35.      Plaintiffs incorporate the foregoing paragraphs.\n\n         36.      EBCO breached the General Contract by failing to perform said contract in a\n\ngood and workmanlike manner, failing to construct the Project according to the contract\n\ndocuments, and failing to construct the Project in a manner consistent with the interests of the\n\nowner.\n\n         37.      ESG and Swenson breached the Architectural Contract by deviating from the\n\napplicable standard of care, failing to produce design plans free from defects, and failing to\n\nproperly administer the construction of the Project. See Exhibit A, Certificate of Merit of John\n\nNyfeler, FAIA, describing ESG and Swenson's negligent acts, or acts in breach of the\n\nArchitectural Contract, pursuant to the Certificate of Merit requirements of applicable state law.\n\n         38.      HBC and Swoboda breached the Geotechnical Study Contract as set forth in\n\nKirby Meyer's Certificate of Merit, attached as Exhibit B, pursuant to the Certificate of Merit\n\nrequirements of applicable state law.           Terracon is responsible for HBC's and Swoboda's\n\nnegligent acts, errors, or omissions as a result of its merger with HBC.\n\n         39.      Terracon breached the Materials Testing Contract, as set forth in Exhibit B.\n\nPlaintiffs' Seventh Amended Original Petition                                                    Page 9\nMHDocs 4896391 1 12690.2\n\n                                                                                                          192\n\f         40.      Terracon breached its oral contract with White for geotechnical engmeenng\n\nservices, as set forth in Exhibit B.\n\n         41.      Defendants ESG, Swenson, and EBCO assert that anti-assignment clauses\n\ncontained in the Architectural Contract and the General Contract prohibit RLJ from asserting\n\nthese contract claims.\n\n         42.      The anti-assignment clause in the Architectural Contract and the General Contract\n\nhave no force or effect on the assignments between White and RLJ because these contracts were\n\nno longer executory at the time of assignment.\n\n         43.      To the extent that Terracon or Swoboda assert contractual anti-assignment\n\nclauses, those clauses have no force or effect on the assignments between White and RLJ\n\nbecause these contracts were no longer executory at the time of assignment.\n\n         44.      In the alternative, the anti-assignment clauses do not render the Contract\n\nassignments void. Instead, they merely potentially entitle ESG, EBCO, or Terracon to a breach\n\nof contract claim.         However, because ESG, HBC, and Terracon materially breached their\n\ncontracts prior to the date of the assignments, as more fully described below, White and RLJ are\n\nexcused from performance.\n\n         45.      Specifically, ESG committed the first material breach of the Architectural\n\nContract with White when it assigned the signing and sealing function of its contract to Swenson,\n\nwithout White's express written consent, while those obligations were still executory. Because\n\ncorporations are not authorized to sign or seal construction documents in Texas, Swenson could\n\nnot have been acting as ESG's agent.            As a result of these actions, ESG is estopped from\n\nenforcement of the referenced anti-assignment clause, and White and RLJ are thereby excused\n\nfrom performance of its contract obligations concerning consent of assignment.              In the\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs' Seventh Amended Original Petition                                               Page 10\nMHDocs 4896391 1 12690.2\n\n                                                                                                      193\n\falternative, ESG relinquished a known right and therefore waived enforcement of the anti-\n\nassignment clause, by virtue of the referenced constructive assignment.\n\n         46.       Specifically, HBC committed the first material breach of the Geotechnical Study\n\nContract with White when it assigned the signing and sealing function of its contract to\n\nSwoboda, without White's express written consent, while those obligations were still executory.\n\nBecause corporations are not authorized to sign or seal construction documents in Texas,\n\nSwoboda could not have been acting as HBC's agent. As a result of these actions, Terracon (on\n\nbehalf of HBC) is estopped from enforcement of the referenced anti-assignment clause, and\n\nWhite and RLJ are thereby excused from performance of its contract obligations concerning\n\nconsent of assignment. In the alternative, HBC relinquished a known right and therefore waived\n\nenforcement of the anti-assignment clause, by virtue of the referenced constructive assignment.\n\n         47.      Specifically, Terracon committed the first material breach of the Materials\n\nTesting Contract with White when it assigned the signing and sealing function of its contract to\n\nothers, without White's express written consent, while those obligations were still executory.\n\nBecause corporations are not authorized to sign or seal construction documents in Texas, the\n\nindividuals who signed and sealed testing reports could not have been acting as Terracon's agent.\n\nAs a result of these actions, Terracon is estopped from enforcement of the referenced anti-\n\nassignment clause, and White and RLJ are thereby excused from performance of its contract\n\nobligations concerning consent of assignment. In the alternative, Terracon relinquished a known\n\nright and therefore waived enforcement of the anti-assignment clause, by virtue of the referenced\n\nconstructive assignment.\n\n         48.      Plaintiffs also challenge the applicability of the purported \"waiver of\n\nconsequential damages\" clauses contained in the Architectural Contract, General Contract, the\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs' Seventh Amended Original Petition                                              Page 11\nMHDocs 4896391 1 12690.2\n\n                                                                                                     194\n\fGeotechnical Study Contract, and/or the Materials Testing Contract. Plaintiffs seek to recover\n\nthe difference between the value of the Project as constructed, and its value had it been designed\n\nand constructed in accordance with the respective Contracts. This is not a consequential damage\n\nas defined by the Contracts, but instead is the primary measure of damages in a breach of\n\ncontract action under Texas law.\n\n         49.      As a direct, natural, probable, and foreseeable consequence associated with\n\nbreaches of contract by EBCO, ESG, Swenson, HBC, Swoboda, and Terracon, Plaintiffs have\n\nsustained damages for which they sue herein.\n\nB.      Declaratory Judgment and Suit for Declaratory Relief\n\n         50.      Plaintiffs incorporate the foregoing paragraphs.\n\n         51.      Pursuant to the Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act, Texas Civil Practice &\n\nRemedies Code §37.001 et seq., Plaintiffs are interested parties whose rights are affected by a\n\ncontract or contracts with Terracon or HBC.\n\n         52.      Issues and disagreements currently exist between Plaintiffs and Terracon\n\nconcemmg whether Terracon's geotechnical engmeenng serv1ces provided in 2005 and\n\nthereafter are the subject of any contractual limitations of liability.       Terracon asserts that\n\nlimitations of liability contained in either the Geotechnical Study or Materials Testing Contract\n\napply to the geotechnical engineering services provided by Terracon in 2005 and thereafter.\n\n         53.      By way of a declaratory action, Plaintiffs seek certainty regarding the respective\n\nparties' rights and obligations under the Geotechnical Study Contract with HBC and the\n\nMaterials Testing Contract with Terracon at issue in this lawsuit. Specifically, RLJ seeks a\n\ndeclaration that: (a) the scope of the Geotechnical Engineering Study contract with HBC was to\n\nprovide a Geotechnical Engineering Study, which was provided on November 21, 2000 and\n\nwhich was completed shortly thereafter; (b) the Materials Testing Contract specifically excludes\n\nPlaintiffs' Seventh Amended Original Petition                                                Page 12\nMHDocs 4896391 1 12690.2\n\n                                                                                                       195\n\fgeotechnical engineering services; and (c) the geotechnical engineering services provided by\n\nTerracon in 2005 and thereafter were provided pursuant to an oral contract separate and distinct\n\nfrom the Geotechnical Study or Materials Testing Contract, or in the alternative pursuant to a\n\nnegligent undertaking by Terracon, but in either event the 2005 and beyond geotechnical\n\nengineering services provided by Terracon are not the subject of contractual limitations of\n\nliability contained in either the Geotechnical Study or Materials Testing Contract.\n\n         54.      Based on the foregoing, there is presently an actual, justiciable controversy\n\nbetween and among the parties.\n\nC       Breach of Warranty\n\n         55.      Plaintiffs incorporate the foregoing paragraphs.\n\n         56.      Plaintiffs assert that EBCO expressly represented and warranted that the Project,\n\nand all of its incorporated elements and materials, would be of good quality, that the Project\n\nwould be free from defects, and that the Project would conform to the requirements of the\n\ncontract documents. Specifically, Plaintiffs would show that EBCO breached its warranty that\n\nservices be performed in a good and workmanlike manner, because the Project is not fit for its\n\nintended use, was not constructed in accordance with the contract documents or industry\n\nstandards, and is not free from defects.\n\n         57.      In the alternative, Plaintiffs assert that EBCO impliedly represented and\n\nwarranted that the Project, and all of its incorporated elements and materials, would be of good\n\nquality, that the Project would be free from defects, and that the Project would conform to the\n\nrequirements of the contract documents.           Specifically, Plaintiffs would show that EBCO\n\nbreached its common law implied warranty that serv1ces be performed in a good and\n\nworkmanlike manner, because the Project is not fit for its intended use, was not constructed in\n\naccordance with the contract documents or industry standards, and is not free from defects.\n\nPlaintiffs' Seventh Amended Original Petition                                               Page 13\nMHDocs 4896391 1 12690.2\n\n                                                                                                      196\n\f         58.      As a direct, natural, probable, and foreseeable consequence associated with\n\nEBCO's breach of warranty, Plaintiffs have sustained damages for which they sue herein.\n\nD.      Equitable Subrogation\n\n         59.      Plaintiffs incorporate the foregoing paragraphs.\n\n         60.      Plaintiffs will show that EBCO had a duty to construct the Project without\n\nnegligence, free from defects, in a manner consistent with construction industry standards for\n\nsimilar projects in this location, and to refrain from negligent misrepresentation concerning the\n\nProject. EBCO failed to meet its duties when performing its work on the Project, all of which\n\ncaused or contributed to cause damages to Plaintiffs.\n\n         61.      Plaintiffs will also show that ESG had a duty to provide design plans and to\n\nadminister the Project's construction in accordance with the Architectural Contract, without\n\nnegligence, free from errors and omissions, and in a manner consistent with the applicable\n\nstandard of professional skill and care.        ESG also had a duty to refrain from negligent\n\nmisrepresentation concerning the Project.        ESG failed to meet its duties in performing the\n\nservices for the Project, all of which caused or contributed to cause damages to Plaintiffs. See\n\nExhibit A.\n\n         62.      Plaintiffs will show that Swenson owed a duty to provide design plans without\n\nnegligence, free from errors and omissions, and in a manner consistent with the Architectural\n\nContract and all applicable standards of professional skill and care. Swenson also had a duty to\n\nrefrain from negligent misrepresentation concerning the Project. Swenson failed to meet his\n\nduties in performing the services for the Project, which caused or contributed to cause damages\n\nto Plaintiffs. See Exhibit A.\n\n         63.      Plaintiffs will show that HBC and Swoboda owed a duty to provide a\n\ngeotechnical engineering study without negligence, free from errors and omissions, and in a\n\nPlaintiffs' Seventh Amended Original Petition                                             Page 14\nMHDocs 4896391 1 12690.2\n\n                                                                                                    197\n\fmanner consistent with applicable standard of professional skill and care. Plaintiffs will also\n\nshow HBC and Swoboda owed a duty to refrain from negligent misrepresentation concerning the\n\nProject. HBC and Swoboda failed to meet these duties in performing their services for the\n\nProject, which caused or contributed to cause damages to Plaintiffs. See Exhibit B, Certificate of\n\nMerit of Kirby Meyer, describing HBC or Swoboda's negligent acts, pursuant to the Certificate\n\nof Merit requirements of applicable state law. Terracon is responsible for HBC's and Swoboda's\n\nnegligent acts, errors, or omissions as a result of its merger with HBC.\n\n         64.      Plaintiffs will show that Terracon owed a duty to provide geotechnical\n\nengineering without negligence, free from errors and omissions, and in a manner consistent with\n\napplicable standard of professional skill and care. Plaintiffs will also show that Terracon owed a\n\nduty to refrain from negligent misrepresentation concerning the Project. Terracon failed to meet\n\nthese duties in performing their services for the Project, which caused or contributed to cause\n\ndamages to Plaintiffs. See Exhibit B, Certificate of Merit of Kirby Meyer, describing Terracon's\n\nnegligent acts, pursuant to the Certificate of Merit requirements of applicable state law.\n\n         65.      Plaintiffs will show that Terracon owed a duty to provide materials\n\ntesting/construction inspection services without negligence, free from errors and omissions, and\n\nin a manner consistent with applicable standard of professional skill and care. Plaintiffs will also\n\nshow that Terracon owed a duty to refrain from negligent misrepresentation concerning the\n\nProject. Terracon failed to meet these duties in performing their services for the Project, which\n\ncaused or contributed to cause damages to Plaintiffs. See Exhibit B, Certificate of Merit of Kirby\n\nMeyer, describing Terracon's negligent acts, pursuant to the Certificate of Merit requirements of\n\napplicable state law.\n\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs' Seventh Amended Original Petition                                                Page 15\nMHDocs 4896391 1 12690.2\n\n                                                                                                       198\n\f         66.      Plaintiffs will show that MBA owed a duty to provide structural engmeenng\n\nservices in accordance with its contract without negligence, free from errors and omissions, and\n\nin a manner consistent with applicable standard of professional skill and care. Plaintiffs will also\n\nshow MBA owed a duty to refrain from negligent misrepresentation concerning the Project.\n\nMBA failed to meet its duties in performing these services for the Project, which caused or\n\ncontributed to cause damages to Plaintiffs. See Exhibit C, Certificate of Merit of Dean Read,\n\ndescribing MBA's negligent acts, pursuant to the Certificate of Merit requirements of applicable\n\nstate law.\n\n         67.      Plaintiffs will show that DaVinci owed a duty to provide its labor, material, and\n\nservices in accordance with its contract, without negligence, free from errors and omissions, and\n\nin a manner consistent with the applicable standards of care. Plaintiffs will show that DaVinci\n\nalso owed a duty to refrain from negligent misrepresentation concerning the Project. DaVinci\n\nfailed in these duties, which caused or contributed to cause damage to Plaintiffs.\n\n         68.      Plaintiffs will show that Bridgeview owed a duty to provide its labor, material,\n\nand services in accordance with its contract, without negligence, free from errors and omissions,\n\nand in a manner consistent with the applicable standards of care.         Plaintiffs will show that\n\nBridgeview also owed a duty to refrain from negligent misrepresentation concerning the Project.\n\nBridgeview failed in these duties, which caused or contributed to cause damage to Plaintiffs.\n\n         69.      Plaintiffs will show that Champion owed a duty to provide its labor, material, and\n\nservices in accordance with its contract, without negligence, free from errors and omissions, and\n\nin a manner consistent with the applicable standards of care. Plaintiffs will show that Champion\n\nalso owed a duty to refrain from negligent misrepresentation concerning the Project. Champion\n\nfailed in these duties, which caused or contributed to cause damage to Plaintiffs.\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs' Seventh Amended Original Petition                                                Page 16\nMHDocs 4896391 1 12690.2\n\n                                                                                                       199\n\f         70.      EBCO, ESG, Swenson, MBA, Terracon (and HBC), Swoboda, DaVinci,\n\nBridgeview, and Champion all deviated from the applicable standards of care in the provisions of\n\ntheir respective work or services. In addition, EBCO failed to perform its contract in a good and\n\nworkmanlike manner and to construct the project in accordance with its fiduciary duty or the\n\nGeneral Contract. As a direct result, Plaintiffs suffered damages from the costs to correct or\n\ncompensate for the Defendants' acts, errors, and omissions. Plaintiffs were contractually and\n\notherwise obligated to undertake costly repair to the Project, and to pay those costs, for which the\n\nDefendants are responsible. Each of the Defendants benefited from these payments, for which\n\nthey are actually responsible, and any related claims they might have had regarding the Project\n\nare assigned to Plaintiffs as a matter of law.         Thus, Plaintiffs are entitled to an equitable\n\nsubrogation recovery of those Project remediation costs actually paid as of the date of the trial in\n\nthis matter from Defendants.\n\nE.      Negligence/Tort\n\n         71.      Plaintiffs incorporate the foregoing paragraphs.\n\n         72.      Breach of a Fiduciary Duty is a tort, grounded in negligence principles. EBCO\n\nowed a fiduciary duty to construct the Project in a manner consistent with the owner's interests.\n\nThe rights to the cause of action for EBCO' s breach of this negligence/tort duty were assigned to\n\nRLJ. EBCO breached this duty, causing damage to the Project and RLJ.\n\n                                                VI. DAMAGES\n\n         73.      As a result of the breaches of contract, breach of fiduciary duties, breach of\n\nwarranty, tort/negligence breaches, and negligent acts alleged above, Plaintiffs have sustained\n\ndamages in excess of the minimal jurisdictional requirements of this court. The appropriate\n\nmeasure of damages for the breach of contract and breach of warranty claims is the difference in\n\nvalue between the building as constructed, and the value of the building had it been designed and\n\nPlaintiffs' Seventh Amended Original Petition                                                Page 17\nMHDocs 4896391 1 12690.2\n\n                                                                                                       200\n\fconstructed pursuant to the respective contracts. In the alternative, the measure of damages is\n\nthe cost to fully and completely repair the Project.\n\n          74.     The measure of damages for the tort/negligence causes of action are all out-of-\n\npocket costs, plus all current and future lost revenue, profits, diminution in value, future repair\n\ncosts, along with all other direct, special or consequential damages. Plaintiffs also request that\n\nEBCO be required to disgorge and forfeit all fees from the Project, as a result of the breach of its\n\nfiduciary duty.\n\n          75.

My name is John V. Nyfeler. I am of sound mind and capable of making this\n\n                      . affidavit. I am personally acquainted with the facts herein stated and they\n\n                      are true and correct.\n\n\n\n                 2.    This matter relates to the building project: RU/Marriott Courtyard Hotel,\n\n                      Austln Airport, located at 7809 .Ben White Boulevard, Austin, Texas 78744-\n\n                      1774.\n\n\n                 3.    I am President ofThe Nyfeler Organization, Inc. d/b/a/ John Nyfeler, FAIA\n\n                       and have worked in that capacity since February 1, 2010. For the previous\n\n                       ten years I worked for Aguirre Roden, Inc., a Texas based architect, engineer\n\n                       firm, in the capacity of Senior Vice President. I have been a registered\n\n                       architect in the State ofTexas since 1970.\n\n\n\n                 4.    I have reviewed the construction documents for the referenced building\n\n                       project, prepared by Etness Swenson Graham Architects, Inc. and its\n\n                       Principal, Mark G. Swenson; Texas Architect Registration No. 13193,\n\n                       (collectively \"Architect\") and its sub-consultants and have reviewed other\n\n                       related documents provided to me. During the year 2009 and 2010, I have\n\n                       visited the site of the building and have visually examined the building and\n\n                       have made inspections of the construction at selected locations in the\n\n                       building. The documents that I reviewed and my observations and\n                       inspections of the site and of the building form the factual basls for the\n                       professional opinion that the Architect's acts, errors and omissions deviated\n                       from the appropriate standard of care for example:\n\n\n                                                    1\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                       205\n\f   a.   The Architect and its consultants in the design of the building foundation\n        failed to follow the recommendations of the Geotechnical Engineering\n        Study dated November 21, 2000 prepared by HBC Engineering, Inc.,\n        which failure to follow the recommendations in the Geotechnical\n          Engineering Study caused or contributed to the physical damage to the\n          building including:\n\n\n          1       The Architect failed to advise the geotechnical consultant of the\nfinal finished floor elevations.\n          2        The Architect failed to take into account that the geotechnical\nborings were taken before the site excavation was done.\n          3        The Architect did not take into account the admonition set out\nin 6.3 of the Geotechnical Report, \" ...zones of shallow groundwater seepage are\npossible along pervious seams/fissures of the near surface soils (particularly\nduring or soon after periods of wet weather).\"\n          4        The Architect accepted the estimated potential vertical rise\n(PVR) ofthree inches (j\"} and designed the building to that unacceptable range.\n           5       The Architect failed to advise the geotechnical consultant of the\ndesign which would setfinished floor elevation more than two feet below the\nexisting grade even though the geotechnical report states: \"lffinished grade Is\nplanned to be more than two feet above or below existing grade, HBC should be\ncontacted to revise our recommendations.\"\n           6       The Architect failed to provide effective drainage around the\nbuilding even though the geotechnical report (p.8) states: \".,.moisture\n\nvariations in the sub-grade soils due to poor drainage, leakage of utilities, etc.\ncould induce volumetric changes resulting in movements which are in excess of\nthose estimated by the PVR procedure.\"\n           7       The Architect failed to design a wall drain recommended by the\ngeotechnical report (p.l4). The report states: \"A wall drain is recommended for\ncollection and removal of surface water percolation along the base of the\nwalls.\"\n\n\n\n                                   2\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                       206\n\f                                 8      The Architect failed to specify backfill of cohesive (clay} soil\n                    around the building to control surface water percolation which backfill will help\n                    to prevent buildup of higher wall pressures even though the geotechnical report\n                    (p.14) states: \"The flnal12 inches of backfill should preferably consist of\n                    cohesive soil to help reduce percolation of surface water into the backfilL\n                                 9      The Architect failed to have HBC Engineering, Inc. to review the\n                    final   cons~ruction   documents for concurrence that the documents conformed\n                    with the geotechnical report even though the geotechnical report states (p.19,\n                    Art.8.0} \"HBC should be provided the opportunity to review the final plans and\n                    specifications to check that these and subsequent recommendations are\n                    properly interpreted.\" There is no record of this final review being done.\n                                 10     The Architect failed to design the surface water drain age\n                    around the building to prevent pending of water near the building even though\n                    the geotechnical report states (p.15, Art.7.7) \" ...we highly recommend that the\n                    site drainage be developed so that ponding of surface water runoff near the\n                    structure does not occur.\"\n\n\n        b.

I\n\n       reserve the right to modify my opinions if additional information becomes\n\n       available.\n\n       5. HBC, the geotechnical engineer of record for the Courtyard Austin Airport,\n\n       identified highly expansive soils which will change volume with changing\n\n       moisture conditions at the site.   The highly expansive nature of the soil was\n\n       independently confirmed during MLAW's investigation.\n\n       6. In their geotechnical report, HBC recommended a stiffened slab-on-ground\n\n       foundation supported on a select fill pad.          The stiffened slab-on-ground\n\n       foundation was to be designed based on the Department of Housing and Urban\n\n       Development (HUD) Building Research Advisory Board's Report #33 (BRAB\n\n      #33) titled \"Criteria for Selection and Design of Residential Slabs-on-Ground\" and\n\n       dated 1968.    HBC's geotechnical report was signed and sealed by Todd E.\n\n       Swoboda, P.E. on November 21, 2000.\n\n      7. At the time of the HBC geotechnical report, the City of Austin had adopted the\n\n      1994 Uniform Building Code (UBC) for the design and construction of buildings\n\n       such as this hotel.

The BRAS #33 procedure recommended by HBC has not been\n\n       widely used in Central Texas for many years.             In .addition, the BRAB #33\n\n       procedure was developed for the design of small residential foundations, not\n\n       commercial buildings such as this hotel.\n\n       8. This site was excavated as much as 7 feet to provide a level construction pad.\n\n       Had HBC accounted for the up to 7 feet of site cut, the predicted Potential\n\n       Vertical Rise (PVR) for the site with no remove and replace modifications would\n\n       have been as much as 7.6 inches, not the 3 inches stated in their report.\n\n       9. HBC failed      to   take   into   account the site    cut in   the geotechnical\n\n       recommendations.        Cutting the site reduces the overburden and exposes the\n\n       deeper soils to higher levels of moisture change than would have been\n\n       experienced prior to the cutting. Cutting results in a significant increase in the\n\n       swell potential.   HBC failed to determine final site elevations or notice site\n\n       excavation while on site during construction.\n\n       10. HBC overestimation of the effect of 5 feet of remove and replace with select\n\n       fill. Based on MLAW's PVR analysis, 5 feet of remove and replace would have\n\n       only reduced the PVR to 2.7 inches, not less than 1 inch as reported in HBC's\n\n       report. Had the site cut of up to 7 feet been considered, the value would be 4.8\n\n       inches.\n\n       11. HBC failed to recommend adequate measures to drain or prevent water from\n\n       penetrating the underslab fill.         Since the underslab fill's permeability is\n\n       significantly higher than the surrounding clay, any water that infiltrates the\nCERTIFICATE OF MERIT OF KIRBY T.

Do not let bias, prejudice, or sympathy play any part in your decision.\n\n        2. Base your answers only on the evidence admitted in court and on the law that is in these\ninstructions and questions. Do not consider or discuss any evidence that was not admitted in the\ncourtroom.\n\n        3. You are to make up your own minds about the facts. You are the sole judges of the\ncredibility of the witnesses and the weight to give their testimony. But on matters of law, you\nmust follow all of my instructions.\n\n       4. If my instructions use a word in a way that is different from its ordinary meaning, use\nthe meaning I give you, which will be a proper legal definition.\n\n       5. All the questions and answers are important. No one should say that any question or\nanswer is not important.\n\n        6. Unless the instruction for a particular question tells you otherwise, a \"yes\" answer must\nbe based on a preponderance of the evidence.          If you do not find that a preponderance of the\nevidence supports a \"yes\" answer, then answer \"no.\" When you answer a question that requires\nan answer other than \"yes\" or \"no,\" your answer must be based on a preponderance ofthe evidence,\nunless the instruction for that particular question tells you otherwise.\n\n       The term \"preponderance of the evidence\" means the greater weight of credible evidence\npresented in this case. A preponderance of the evidence is not measured by the number of\nwitnesses or by the number of documents admitted in evidence. For a fact to be proved by a\npreponderance of the evidence, you must find that the fact is more likely true than not true.\n\n         7. A fact may be established by direct evidence or by circumstantial evidence or both. A\nfact is established by direct evidence when proved by documentary evidence or by witnesses who\nsaw the act done or heard the words spoken. A fact is established by circumstantial evidence when\nit may be fairly and reasonably inferred from other facts proved.\n\n       8. Do not decide who you think should win before you answer the questions and then just\nanswer the questions to match your decision. Answer each question carefully without considering\nwho will win. Do not discuss or consider the effect your answers will have.\n\n       9. Do not answer questions by drawing straws or by any method of chance.\n\n       10. Some questions might ask you for a dollar amount. Do not agree in advance to decide\non a dollar amount by adding up each juror's amount and then figuring the average.\n                                                 2\n\nMay 14,2014\n\n\n\n\n                                                                     1122\n\fI\n\n~                                          DC           BK14139 PG264\n\n\n\n\n            11. Do not trade your answers. For example, do not say, \"I will answer this question your\n    way if you answer another question my way.\"\n\n            12. To return a verdict, the same group of at least 10 of you must agree on each and every\n    answer. You may not have one group of 10 jurors agree on one answer and a different group of\n    10 jurors agree on another answer.\n\n           As I have said before, if you do not follow these instructions, you will be guilty of juror\n    misconduct, and I might have to order a new trial and start this process over again. This would\n    waste your time and the parties' money, and would require the taxpayers of this county to pay for\n    another trial. If a juror breaks any of these rules, tell that person to stop and report it to me\n    immediately.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    3\n\n    May 14,2014\n\n\n\n\n                                                                        1123\n\f                                       DC        BK14139 PG265\n\n\n\n\n                                  Instructions and Definitions\n\nAssignment.

However, no contract was\n        ultimately at issue in Crown Life; the plaintiffs \"sued Casteel and Crown alleging DTP A, Article\n        21.21, and common-law causes of action.\" The same is true of Ellender.

Invest/n. com, Moon Sun\nKang, and Karbach each construed but one contract, determined whether certain individuals\nwere or were not parties to that contract, and say nothing about settlement credits. In a\nMemorandum Opinion, the court in LJ Charter recites the same law on one-satisfaction cited by\nthe Galle court. This includes the principle that the single injury, not the cause of action, is\ndeterminative. However, with respect to the part of the LJ Charter opinion cited, the court does\nnot seem to apply it. Stating that individuals who are not parties to the contract \"could not be\njointly liable for the breach of contract damages,\" focuses on the cause of action rather than the\ninjury. If there is one single, indivisible injury caused by two entities - one breaching a common\nlaw duty and one breaching a contract, any award for that injury against one defendant should be\ncredited against the other. Perhaps the court meant that under the facts of the case the contract\ndamages were distinct, divisible damages.\n\n        In Ellender, 2 the Texas Supreme Court instructed courts to look to the settlement\nagreement exclusively to determine if settlement funds were apportioned between divisible or\nindivisible damages and in what amounts. 3\n\n        Here, the settlement agreement merely states what would be true even if unstated -\nEBCO's settlement does not release any claims against ESG. To establish that all or some ofthe\nsettlement funds were apportioned to divisible claims against EBCO, RLJ needed to identify that\ncategory of damages and state the amount apportioned to it. 4 Since RLJ did not do so, the court\nis required to presume that the entire settlement amount is credited to ESG.\n\n        The legal justification given for excluding contracts is that no party can be jointly liable\nfor a breach of a contract that it did not enter. This is true but misses the point by conflating the\nbreach from which liability arises with the damages arising from each breach. There are two\ndistinct breaches of two separate contracts by separate parties. Neither party is held liable for the\n\n\n2\n   Mobil Oil Corp. v. Ellender, 968 S.W.2d 917, 929 (Tex. 1998)\n3\n  In Galle, the court stated the expansiveness of the release demonstrated that the settlement funds were\nnot apportioned between types of damage. Since a paying party will always expect a full release, the\nscope of the release, if the determining factor, would always preclude apportionment. In any event, this\npart of the Galle opinion is dicta because the court found that the plaintiff had the burden to prove\napportionment and had not done so; the court's ruling was not dependent on what the release said but\nwhat the settlement did not say. In Ellender, the Supreme Court looked for language of apportionment\nbetween types of damage rather than the scope of the release.\n4\n  Whether RLJ could have, consistent with the pleadings and the evidence, identified divisible damages is\nanother question. There was evidence of repair costs due to EBCO's failure to build to specifications,\nbut RLJ may not have presented those as divisible damages in its pleading or evidence. The damage\nquestion in the Charge asked for damages \"due to ESG's failure to comply.\" The question had to ask\nspecifically about damages resulting from ESG 's failure to inquire about cause-in-fact. That\nspecification, however, does not mean, without more, that the damages found were divisible and\nattributable only to ESG.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                   1438\n\fD-1-GN-1 0-002325\nPage 3 of5\n\n\n\nother's breach. Each party is liable for its own breach which by itself results in indivisible\ndamages. Just as with joint tortfeasors who breach different common law duties that each\nproximately cause an indivisible damage. (As the Pattern Jury Charge states, there may be more\nthan one proximate cause of an occurrence.)\n\n        Any perception that applying the one-satisfaction rule here would be unfair may arise\nfrom the fact that RLJ sought more in damages than the jury awarded and received more in\nsettlement with EBCO alone than the jury awarded in damages. Had there been no settlement,\nthough, the jury's determination of diminished value would be the amount owed jointly by\nEBCO and ESG, even less than what RLJ received in settlement from EBCO. The source of\nRLJ's disappointment regarding damages is the jury verdict, not the application of settlement\ncredits to it.\n\nThe one satisfaction rule as applied to attorney's fees\n\n       Regarding ESG' s objection to Plaintiffs Motion for Attorney's fees, the only aspect\nbefore the court now is a pure question of law - when settlement credit equal or exceed the\ndamages awarded against the non-settling party does it extinguish any claim for attorney's fees?\n\n        Historically, as RLJ has pointed out, the one-satisfaction rule has been discussed in both\ncases and commentary almost exclusively in the context of torts, which of course do not involve\nattorney's fee claims. The limitation to the full amount of damages, therefore, should be read in\nthat context and not taken as a deliberate decision to disregard attorney's fees claims. There are\nbut a few cases addressing the application of the one-satisfaction rule to an attorney's fees claim\nassociated with a contract claim. Just as with the application to contract damages, the application\nto attorney's fees is new and developing. ESG is correct that the net-payment cases do not\naddress settlement credits for the same claim and damages. However, in the primary authority\nrelied upon by ESG, Osborne, there was a comparative fault question to which the jury answered\nthat Jauregi was less than 50% liable. Osborne also involved a procedural background very\ndifferent from the one here.\n\n        In neither Osborne nor any other case cited was there a settlement half-way through a jury\ntrial after years of litigation. The Osborne opinion begins by noting, \"[a]fter mold was\ndiscovered in the house, State Farm paid $1,874,687 in mold-related claims. Despite receiving\nthose payments, the Osbornes sued Jauregi and numerous subcontractors, settling before trial for\nmore than $1 million.\" Later in the analysis, the court again observes that the settlement was\npre-trial. Obsborne and Hamra cite and rely upon Blizzard and quote this particular sentence,\n\"[h]owever, it is quite another to allow attorney's fees on a claim that, although successful, was\npaid in full before trial [emphasis added].\" By contrast, here, the settlement with EBCO came in\nthe midst of trial, when RLJ was just days away from a verdict after incurring, it claims,\nhundreds of thousands in attorney's fees. ESG's position is effectively that RLJ, after settling\nwith EBCO, should have abandoned the trial and non-suited ESG, which had conceded nothing\nand settled nothing. Or, RLJ should not have settled because they would have been much better\n\n\n\n\n                                                               1439\n\fD-1-GN-1 0-002325\nPage 4 of5\n\noff with the very same verdict against both defendants. By such a verdict they would have been\nawarded the $700,000 against the defendants jointly, they would have prevailed and RLJ would\nhave had the potential of a significant award in attorney's fees. If ESG is correct, RLJ has not\nprevailed, directly and only, because it reached a settlement with EBCO. This disincentive to\nsettle is explained more fully below.\n\n       The procedural background aside, there is more than one reason a settlement credit\nexceeding damages should not automatically extinguish a claim for attorney's fees.\n\n         First, in contract, a plaintiff with an associated attorney's fees claim is not given one\nsatisfaction by damages alone. The plaintiff is not made whole or returned to its position before\nthe breach. Full satisfaction for RLJ would be the jury's verdict on damages, the fact-finder's              }_\n\n\nGury or judge by agreement as here) determination of fees shown to be incurred against the\ndefendants jointly or segregated as to those incurred against ESG alone, less the settlement\namount. The one-satisfaction rule is intended to limit a plaintiff to no more than full redress, not\nto restrict the plaintiff to less than that.\n\n        Second, the legislature has provided for the possibility of attorney's fees, even if not\nprovided in the contract itself, to hold individuals and entities to their agreements. There are of\ncourse several factors to consider in awarding attorney's fees, but the law recognizes that fees\nequal to or exceeding damages may be properly awarded. 5 Otherwise, no agreement worth less\nthan the attorney's fees required to enforce it would ever be enforced. That is the result if fees\ncan be extinguished, not just reduced, by a verdict that is less than another defendant's settlement\nof indivisible damages. A plaintiff who settles with one defendant for the full amount it seeks in\nindivisible damages and the full amount of the fees attributable to that defendant (indivisible and\nsegregated) would be foolish to continue to litigate against a remaining defendant with little or no\ndivisible damages even if the plaintiff knew liability could be established and had a high\nexpectation of proving significant fees. The remaining defendant does not receive a mere\nwindfall but rather a free pass at the expense of contract enforceability.\n\n        Third, the possibility that attorney's fees wi.ll be extinguished by a settlement with one\ndefendant skews the parties' calculation of probabilities and risks so as to greatly discourage all\nparties from settling. Litigants consciously or subconsciously conduct a calculation of the\n\n5\n  ESG's case law does not hold otherwise. The Smith v. Tam holding is that the appellate court erred in\nreversing a verdict for zero attorney's fees and rendering judgment for attorney's fees (1) as a matter of\nlaw (2) in an amount roughly equivalent to the total damages awarded and (3) equivalent to the full\namount fees sought by plaintiffs (4) even though the plaintiffs were awarded less than a third of the\ndamages sought, and (5) \"in the absence of evidence that such fees were warranted due circumstances\nunique to this case.\" Smith v. Patrick W. Y. Tam Trust, 296 S.W.3d 545, 548 (Tex. 2009). ESG's\ndescription of the holding included none of those four crucial points. Barker is unremarkable; a remand\nfor redetermination of fees after the appellate court reduced the damages from $111,000 to $16,000. If\nthe law were, as ESG claims, that a court simply compares the amount awarded to the amount of fees and\nmake a determination the latter's reasonableness \"on its face,\" surely there would be better authority for\nthat proposition.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                   1440\n\fD-1-GN-1 0-002325\nPage 5 of5\n\n\n\nprobabilities of gain and loss. Because attorney's fees in a contract case may equal or even\nexceed damages, the probability of significant fees cannot be disregarded based on the probable\namount of damages alone. Defendants' calculations of course also entail this understanding.\nBecause of the probability of an award of some attorney's fees that will not necessarily be\nreduced in proportion to the award in damages, the opposing parties' valuations of the case come\ncloser to converging.\n\n        If, however, the award of attorney's fees becomes a function of receiving damages above\na certain amount, it radically changes the equation all parties have employed to calculate the\nprobabilities of gain and loss and greatly discourages settlement between the plaintiff and each\ndefendant. A plaintiff with a large fee claim will hesitate to enter an otherwise reasonable\nsettlement with one defendant because the entitlement to any fees (not already compensated)\nagainst the remaining, non-settling party, rides on a verdict for damages above the settlement. If\nthe plaintiff, as here, nonetheless does settle with one defendant, the plaintiff and remaining\ndefendant lose all incentive to settle. The plaintiff now compares the probability of a larger\nverdict with attorney's fees versus the probability of receiving nothing in additional damages\nand nothing in fees. The remaining defendant compares the probability of owing a larger verdict\nand fees versus the probability of owing nothing. It becomes a crap-shoot in which it would be\nonly logical for both parties to roll the dice.\n\n       Judgment cannot be entered without a determination of attorney's fees, if any.\n\n                                             Sincerely,\n\n\n\n                                    ~----S-tep        n Yelefosky\n                                             Judge,   345t~istrict Court\n\n\n\n\nSY/ar\nOrig: Amalia Rodriguez Mendoza, District Clerk\n\n\n\n\n                                                               1441\n\fAPPENDIX D\n\fNotice sent:    ~ lnierlocutory None                     DC        BK14239 PG58\n\nOisp Parties:         ~\n                                  J..l W1?J\n                                   -'0tf\nDlsp code:GG>/ CLS\n\nRedact pgs: _     ___,..-----:=----r-\nJudge    s   5AJ          Clerk\n                                                 CAUSE NO.

If the Architect determines that the conditions at\n            the site are not materially different from those indicated in the Contract Documents and that\n            no change in the terms of the Contract is justified, the Architect s1mll so notify the Owner and\n            Contractor in writing, stating the reasons.

GENERAL DENIAL\n\n        Pursuant to Rule 92 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, Defendants generally deny\n\neach and every, all and singular, the assertions alleged in Plaintiffs' Sixth Amended Original\n\nPetition and any amendments thereto and request that Plaintiffs be required to prove the charges\n\nand allegations against these Defendants by a preponderance of the evidence and/or by clear and\n\nconvincing evidence, as required by the Constitution and the Laws of the State of Texas.\n\nB.      SPECIFIC DENIAL\n\n        Pursuant to Rule 54 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, Defendants specifically deny\n\nthat all conditions precedent to the Plaintiffs' right to recover have been performed, have\n\noccurred, or have been waived or excused.        In particular, Defendants specifically deny that\n\nPlaintiffs have presented their claims for payment to Defendants or Defendants' duly authorized\n\nagents as required by Section 38.002(2) of the Texas Civil Practice & Remedies Code.\n\nC.      VERIFIED DENIALS\n\n        Pursuant to Rule 93 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, Defendants make the\n\nfollowing verified denials:\n\n        1.         Defendants deny the assignment of the contract upon which Plaintiffs' claims\n\nagainst Defendants are founded. Specifically, Defendants deny that Defendants or Defendants'\n\nauthorized representative(s) provided consent to assign the contract at issue to Plaintiffs.\n\nTherefore, any alleged assignment violates the anti-assignment clause of the contract and is null\n\nand void.\n\n\n\n\nELNESS, SWENSON, GRAHAM ARCHITECTS, INC. AND MARK G. SWENSON'S SECOND AMENDED\nANSWER AND ORIGINAL COUNTERCLAIM FOR DECLARATORY JUDGMENT- Page 2\n599603.1 4021122\n\n                                                                                                    47\n\f        2.         Defendants deny that Plaintiffs are entitled to recover in the capacity in which\n\nthey sue.    Defendants did not provide consent to assign the contract upon which Plaintiffs'\n\nclaims are founded, and any such assignment is, therefore, made in violation of the anti-\n\nassignment. As such, Plaintiffs are not parties to the contract and lack standing to bring contract\n\nclaims against Defendants.\n\n        3.         Defendants deny that Swenson is liable in the capacity in which he has been sued.\n\nIn particular, Swenson is not a signatory or a party to the contract upon which Plaintiffs' claims\n\nagainst Defendants are founded.\n\n        4.         Defendants incorporate by reference herein the sworn verification of Paul\n\nMittendorf£, a Principal and Vice President of Elness, Swenson, Graham Architects, Inc., which\n\nis attached to Defendants' First Amended Answer and Original Counterclaim for Declaratory\n\nJudgment filed with the Court on or about December 30, 2011.\n\nD.      AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES\n\n        Pleading in the affirmative, if such       IS   necessary, Defendants would further show as\n\nfollows:\n\n        1.         Plaintiffs' alleged injuries and damages, if any, resulted, if at all, from conditions\n\nunrelated to any act, omission or conduct of Defendants.\n\n        2.         Plaintiffs' alleged injuries and damages, if any, were caused, if at all, in whole or\n\nm part by the acts or omissions of others for whose conduct Defendants are not legally\n\nresponsible.\n\n        3.         At all times material to Plaintiffs' allegations, Defendants' conduct conformed to\n\nthe applicable standard of care.\n\n        4.         Plaintiffs' tort claims are barred in whole or in part, by the economic loss rule.\n\nELNESS, SWENSON, GRAHAM ARCHITECTS, INC. AND MARK G. SWENSON'S SECOND AMENDED\nANSWER AND ORIGINAL COUNTERCLAIM FOR DECLARATORY JUDGMENT- Page 3\n599603.1 4021122\n\n                                                                                                            48\n\f        5.         Alternatively, if the economic loss rule does not completely bar all of Plaintiffs'\n\ntort claims, then, pursuant to Chapter 33 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code,\n\nDefendants are entitled to a credit for any settlement Plaintiffs receive from any other person or\n\nentity. If Plaintiffs settle with any other person or entity, then Defendants reserve the right to\n\nmake a written election of credit for settlement under §33.014 of the Texas Civil Practice and\n\nRemedies Code.\n\n        6.         Alternatively, if the economic loss rule does not completely bar all of Plaintiffs'\n\ntort claims, then, Plaintiffs' alleged injuries and damages, if any, were caused, if at all, in whole\n\nor in part, by Plaintiffs' own negligence. Plaintiffs are wholly barred from recovery to the extent\n\nthe finder-of-fact determines Plaintiffs' comparative responsibility is 50% or greater, and, if\n\nPlaintiffs' comparative responsibility is less than 50%, any recovery must be reduced by\n\nPlaintiffs' percentage of responsibility determined by the finder-of-fact, in accordance with\n\nChapter 33 of the Texas Civil Practice & Remedies Code.\n\n        7.         Plaintiffs cannot recover for any amount that could have been avoided by their\n\nexercise of reasonable care.\n\n        8.         Plaintiffs' claims are barred, in whole or in part, by Plaintiffs' failure to mitigate\n\nany alleged damages.\n\n        9.         Plaintiffs' alleged injuries and damages, if any, resulted, if at all, from\n\nindependent, unforeseeable, intervening and/or superseding causes.              Any alleged action or\n\nomission on the part of Defendants was not the proximate cause, producing cause, or cause-in-\n\nfact ofPlaintiffs' alleged injuries or damages, if any.\n\n\n\n\nELNESS, SWENSON, GRAHAM ARCHITECTS, INC. AND MARK G. SWENSON'S SECOND AMENDED\nANSWER AND ORIGINAL COUNTERCLAIM FOR DECLARATORY JUDGMENT- Page 4\n599603.1 4021122\n\n                                                                                                            49\n\f        10.        Defendants assert any and all defenses and seek any and all relief to which\n\nDefendants may be entitled in accordance with and pursuant to Chapter 150 of the Texas Civil\n\nPractice and Remedies Code.\n\n        11.        Plaintiffs lack standing to sue on and are not parties to the contract on which\n\nPlaintiffs' claims against Defendants are founded. Assignment of the contract to Plaintiffs was\n\nmade without consent ofDefendants, in violation of the anti-assignment clause of the contract.\n\n        12.        Plaintiffs' non-contract claims are barred by the appropriate statute oflimitations.\n\n        13.        Plaintiffs' non-contract claims, including claims for equitable subrogation, are\n\nbarred by the economic loss doctrine.\n\n        14.        Plaintiffs' recovery, if any, is limited to direct contract damages, if any, pursuant\n\nto the waiver of consequential damages clause in the contract upon which Plaintiffs' claims\n\nagainst Defendants are founded. More specifically, Plaintiffs' claims for current and future lost\n\nrevenue, profits and diminution in value are barred by the consequential damages clause of the\n\ncontract.\n\n        15.        Plaintiffs' claims are barred against Defendants because Plaintiffs purchased the\n\nbuilding in question \"as is.\"\n\n        16.        Defendants reserve the right to amend or supplement with any additional\n\naffirmative defenses or pleas of avoidance to which Defendants may be entitled.\n\n                                                     II.\n\n                     COUNTERCLAIM FOR DECLARATORY JUDGMENT\n\nA.

As provided for by Chapter 37 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code,\n\nCounter-Claimants seek the following declarations from the Court:\n\n        a.         That the \"Anti-Assignment\" clause of the contract       IS   valid, enforceable and\n\n                   applies to Counter-Plaintiffs, making any ostensible assignment of the contract, in\n\n                   violation of the Anti-Assignment clause, null and void and of no effect;\n\n        b.         That the \"Statute of Limitations Accrual\" clause of the contract is valid and\n\n                   enforceable and, to the effect that a party could enforce the contract against\n\n                   Counter-Claimants, such Statute of Limitations Accrual clause establishes the\n\n                   date upon which any cause of action against Counter-Claimants accrues, i.e., the\n\n                   date that Counter-Claimants' services were substantially completed, which such\n\n                   date time-bars all of Counter-Defendants' causes of action with a two-year\n\n                   limitations period;\n\n        c.         That the \"Waiver of Consequential Damages\" clause of the Contract is valid and\n\n                   enforceable and, to the effect that a party could enforce the contract against\n\n                   Counter-Claimants, such Waiver of Consequential Damages clause bars Counter-\n\n                   Defendants from recovering any consequential damages from Counter-Claimants;\n\n                   and\n\n        d.         That Swenson was not a signatory or a party to the contract at issue here and, as\n\n                   such, cannot be liable to the Counter-Defendants under the contract.\n\n\n\nELNESS, SWENSON, GRAHAM ARCHITECTS, INC.

SWENSON'S SECOND AMENDED\nANSWER AND ORIGINAL COUNTERCLAIM FOR DECLARATORY JUDGMENT- Page 7\n599603.1 4021122\n\n                                                                                                          52\n\fE.      FACTUALBACKGROUND\n\n\n        1.         On or about January 1, 2005, White Lodging Services Corporation, Inc. (\"White\n\nLodging\") and ESG entered into an agreement for architect services, as set forth in the following\n\ncontracts: (i) AlA Document B141- 1997 Part 1: Standard Form of Agreement Between Owner\n\nand Architect with Standard Form of Architect's Services (the \"Contract - 1997 Part 1\"),\n\nattached hereto as Exhibit \"1;\" and (ii) AlA Document B141 - 1997 Part 2: Standard Form of\n\nArchitect's Services: Design and Contract Administration (the \"Contract - 1997 Part 2\"),\n\nattached hereto as Exhibit \"2.\"\n\n        2.         The Contract - 1997 Part 1 and the Contract - 1997 Part 2 (collectively, the\n\n\"Contract\") were both executed on March 30, 2005. The Contract was not signed by Swenson in\n\neither his individual or representative capacity.\n\n        3.         Section 1.3.7.9 of the Contract contains an Anti-Assignment clause, wherein\n\n\"[n]either [White Lodging] nor [ESG] shall assign this Agreement without the written consent of\n\nthe other, except that [White Lodging] may assign this Agreement to an institutional lender\n\nproviding financing on the Project.\"\n\n        4.         Section 1.3.6 of the Contract contains a Waiver of Consequential Damages clause,\n\nunder which both ESG and White Lodging \"waive consequential damages for claims, disputes,\n\nor other matters in question arising out of or relating to this [Contract].\"\n\n        5.         Section 1.3.7.3 of the Contract contains a clause commonly known as a \"Statute\n\nof Limitations Accrual\" clause, which provides the method to determine when a cause of action\n\naccrues for the purpose of starting the statute of limitations. Specifically, section 1.3.7.3 reads as\n\nfollows:\n\n\n\n\nELNESS, SWENSON, GRAHAM ARCHITECTS, INC. AND MARK G. SWENSON'S SECOND AMENDED\nANSWER AND ORIGINAL COUNTERCLAIM FOR DECLARATORY JUDGMENT- Page 8\n599603.1 4021122\n\n                                                                                                         53\n\f                   Causes of action between the parties to this Agreement pertaining\n                   to acts or failures to act shall be deemed to have accrued and the\n                   applicable statute of limitations shall commence to run not later\n                   than either the date of Substantial Completion for acts or failures to\n                   act occurring prior to Substantial Completion or the date of\n                   issuance of the final Certificate for Payment for acts or failures to\n                   act occurring after Substantial Completion. In no event shall such\n                   statute of limitations commence to run any later than the date\n                   when the Architect's services are substantially completed.\n\n(Emphasis added).\n\n        6.         On or about March 16, 2006 White Lodging, et al. and Counter-Defendants\n\nentered into an agreement entitled New Hotels Purchase and Sale Agreement by and between\n\nWhiteco Industries, Inc. and RLJ Lodging Fund II Acquisitions, LLC, (the \"New Hotels Purchase\n\nand Sale Agreement\"), through which Counter-Defendants claim that the Contract was assigned\n\nto them.\n\n        7.         ESG did not consent to an assignment of the Contract from White Lodging to\n\nCounter-Defendants, allegedly effectuated through the New Hotels Purchase and Sale\n\nAgreement.\n\n        8.         ESG's services were substantially complete before the date the Certificate of\n\nOccupancy was issued for the Project, which was on October 12, 2006. Therefore, any causes of\n\naction against Counter-Claimants accrued, if at all, no later than October 12, 2006.\n\n        9.         Counter-Defendants initiated this lawsuit and filed Plaintiffs' Original Petition\n\nand Request for Disclosure on July 7, 2010.                   Therefore, the negligence, negligent\n\nmisrepresentation and equitable subrogation causes of action asserted by Counter-Defendants,\n\neach of which are governed by a two-year limitations period, are time-barred by the statute of\n\nlimitations.\n\n\n\n\nELNESS, SWENSON, GRAHAM ARCHITECTS, INC.

Counter-Defendants seek recovery from Counter-Claimants for, among other\n\nthings, diminution in the Project's value, lost revenue and other consequential damages, which\n\nsuch recovery is barred by the Waiver of Consequential Damages clause in the Contract.\n\nF.      CAUSE OF ACTION: APPLICATION FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF.\n\n        1.         Counter-Claimants incorporate by reference paragraphs II.A.1 through and\n\nincluding II.E.1 0 above as if fully set forth verbatim herein.\n\n        2.         There exists an actual and justiciable controversy between Counter-Claimants and\n\nCounter-Defendants herein, within the jurisdiction of this Court, and involving rights, duties,\n\nlegal obligations and relations of the parties under the Contract at issue.\n\n        3.         Counter-Claimants petition this Court, pursuant to Chapter 37 of the Texas Civil\n\nPractice and Remedies Code, to declare that:\n\n        a.         the Anti-Assignment clause of the Contract is valid, enforceable and applies to\n\n                   Counter-Plaintiffs, making the assignment of the Contract, which was in violation\n\n                   of the Anti-Assignment clause, null and void and of no effect;\n\n        b.         the Statute of Limitations Accrual clause of the Contract is valid and enforceable\n\n                   and establishes the date upon which any cause of action against ESG accrued was\n\n                   on or before October 12, 2006, which is the latest date by which ESGs' services\n\n                   were substantially completed;\n\n        c.         that all of Counter-Defendants' causes of action against ESG with a two-year\n\n                   limitations period are time-barred;\n\n\n\n\nELNESS, SWENSON, GRAHAM ARCHITECTS, INC.

COSTS AND ATTORNEYS' FEES\n\n        Counter-Claimants have retained the undersigned law firm to represent them in this\n\naction and have agreed to pay the firm all costs and reasonable and necessary attorneys' fees\n\nincurred in this matter.

This article was transferred into the Civil Practice and\nRemedies Code in 1985 and numbered as § 33.012. Major tort reform measures amended the provision in\n1987, 1995, and 2003.\n\n     The 1987 amendment codified the “one-satisfaction” rule (the Bradshaw Rule). Subsequent\namendments allowed a non-settling defendant to elect either a dollar-for-dollar credit for all\nsettlements with the plaintiff, a credit based on the percentage of liability assigned to the parties by\nthe trier of fact, or a statutory sliding scale. However, in 2003, H.B. 4 eliminated the election of the\ndollar-for-dollar or sliding scale credit, except for those sued for health care liability.\n\n    S.B. 890 restored the election of the dollar-for-dollar settlement credit.\n\n\n\n\nLegislative History of                            Page i                         Capitol Research Services\nTex.

HOUSE\nCOMMITTEE ON CIVIL PRACTICES, “Report to the 79th Texas Legislature” (November, 2004). [Exhibit 6.]\n\n   The Civil Practices Committee was charged by the Speaker of the House with monitoring the\nimplementation of H.B. 4 (2003).\n\n        Charge Two\n\n        Monitor the legislation passed by the 78th Legislature, with a particular emphasis on\n        the implementation of and rulemaking for H.B. 4.\n\n    Id. 7.\n\n    The Interim Report recommended\n\n        Settlement Credit\n\n        The settlement credit change in H.B. 4 has created a major problem in multi-defendant\n        lawsuits that do not involved medical liability. H.B. 4 rightly abolished the old\n        sliding scale settlement credit, but it also eliminated the dollar-for-dollar credit that\n        has been an integral part of Texas law for many, many years. H.B. 4 retained the\n        dollar-for-dollar credit in medical liability cases, but not for other tort actions. This\n        change in the law has put non-settling defendants at a serious disadvantage and in\n        many cases will allow claimants to recover more than 100 percent of their damages. It\n        also creates substantial conflicts between defendants, encourages collusive settlements,\n        and makes it much more difficult to coordinate the defense of mass actions, especially\n        in the toxic tort arena.\n\n        The Committee recommends restoring the optional dollar-for-dollar credit and\n        allowing the non-settling defendant to elect the appropriate credit after verdict. This\n        solution would both preserve the claimant’s recovery and allow defendants the full\n        benefit of a settlement before trial.\n\n    Id. 7.\n\n\n\n\n2005— S.B. 890\nS.B. 890 Filed\n    During the Regular Session of the 79th Texas Legislature, Sen.

CAPITOL RESEARCH SERVICES, Hearings on S.B. 890 Before the Senate Committee\non State Affairs, 79th Leg. R.S. (March 31, 2005). [Exhibit 13.]\n\n   Sen. Williams offered a committee substitute for S.B. 890. Id. [NOTE: A substitute is an amendment\nwhich replaces the text of the whole bill.]\n\n      Sen. Williams explained S.B. 890 to the committee.\n\n                  SEN. TOMMY WILLIAMS : The Committee Substitute to Senate Bill 890 – since\n          the 1930’s, Texas has recognized that an injured party’s entitled to recover only once for\n          an injury. Subsequent to 1987, Chapter 33 allowed the non-settling defendant to elect\n          either a dollar-for-dollar credit for all settlements with the plaintiff, or a credit\n          based on the percentage of liability assigned to parties by a trier of fact, or statutory\n          sliding scale. House Bill 4, the Tort Reform Act of 2003, radically changed this scheme,\n          and it eliminated the dollar-for-dollar sliding scale of credit, except for those sued for\n          health care liability. Instead non-settling defendants now receive credit only for that\n          percentage of fault that a trier of fact assigns to the settling person. Thus, if the jury\n          finds no liability for a settling person, the court may not credit any prior settlements\n          against the non-settling defendant’s liability.\n\n                                              House Bill 4 created an anomaly in Texas law by\n          retaining the dollar-for-dollar credit in medical liability cases, but eliminating it for\n          all others. There’s not a policy rationale for this distinction, and the law as it stands\n          now creates a privileged class of defendants.\n\n                                             Senate Bill 890 solves the problem by restoring the\n          election of the dollar-for-dollar credit, just as in medical liability cases.\n\n                                            The committee substitute language is – has being\n          agreed to by the Texas Association of Defense Council and the Texas Civil Justice\n          League, and the Texas Trial Lawyer Association, and it removes the election provision\n          and allows the percentage equal to each settling person’s percentage responsibility as\n          found by the trier of fact that was in the original bill as filed.\n\n                                           Mr. Chairman, I think there are witnesses here that\n          would probably be very valuable in trying to answer any questions that you or any of\n          the other committee members might have.\n\nLegislative History of                              Page 8                          Capitol Research Services\nTex.

Williams for the agreement embodied in S.B. 890.\n\n                  CHAIR                   : I want to congratulate you on pulling together the\n         coalition – in what I think what seems to be a kind of a monumental agreement on\n         something that’s always been an issue in civil jurisprudence.\n\nId.\n\n    David Chamberlain, representing the Texas Association of Defense Counsel, testified in favor of\nS.B. 890.\n\n                 DAVID E. CHAMBERLAIN : I’m David Chamberlain, and I’m president of the\n         Texas Association of Defense Council, which has over 2100 civil defense lawyers\n         practicing in the state every day handling cases of the nature that this bill will affect.\n         We’re the largest state association of defense lawyers in the country.\n\n                                              I am here to testify in favor of this bill. As Sen.\n         Williams pointed out, we have an anomaly in the system right now. We have\n         basically two different systems, one for healthcare liability cases, one for general\n         liability cases, or a different one for general liability cases. In the general liability\n         cases, currently you can only take a percentage reduction for the negligence in the\n         comparative fault of a settling co-defendant. On the other hand, in a medical\n         malpractice lawsuit, you get a choice, and that choice is either that percentage\n         reduction or a dollar credit. Our experience has been, since September of 2003, from the\n         defense perspective, that it creates and encourages the discord and litigation among co-\n         defendants, who were faced with the tasks of actually having to prove the negligence\n         of what was a friendly – former friendly co-defendant, who has now settled out. And if\n         you want to take – you can’t take advantage of whatever they paid the plaintiff to\n         reduce the overall judgment. You actually – actually have to prove the only negligent,\n         you know, what was once your friend. That creates all sorts of situations and\n         opportunities for malpractice, for conflicts of interest, particularly in toxic tort cases\n         and multiple party cases. And I can – if the committee is interested, I could certainly\n         give examples of that later on.\n\n                                               We feel like that Senator – that Senate Bill 890, the\n         substitute, will solve all of these problems. It’ll switch everything over to a very\n         simple dollar credit only reduction. It’ll bring uniformity and symmetry to all the cases\n         – civil cases. It’ll quiet the discord and litigation among co-defendants. It’ll reduce\n         litigation expense considerably. It will take out the gamesmanship, the guessing about\n         what’s going to happen when you have to make an election in the health care liability\n         field. Everybody’ll know what the deal is going in. We think it’ll greatly facilitate\n         settlements. It’ll reduce the opportunity for – for malpractice, which, again, reduces\n         subsequent or satellite litigation. And we think quite clearly, that this comes as close\n         as humanly possible to achieving the Bradshaw Rule, which we’ve been trying so hard\n         to achieve over the past few decades, and that is only one satisfaction for one injury.\n         And I want to thank the committee for that opportunity to speak today.\n\n                 CHAIR                 : Does that mean if we pass this bill, that we won’t\n         have to endure any more seminar lectures on settlement credit?\n\n\n\nLegislative History of                             Page 9                          Capitol Research Services\nTex.

Kirk Watson will be out of business. No more\n          lawyers trying to do math, which is – sounds funny, Senator, but lawyers trying to do\n          math is a very ugly thing.\n\n                  CHAIR                    : It’s usually lawyers are lawyers because they can’t do\n          math, as opposed to doctors, or engineers.\n\nId.\n\n      Guy Choate, representing the Texas Association of Trial Lawyers, testified in favor of S.B. 890.\n\n                 GUY CHOATE               : I’m Guy Choate, with Texas Trial Lawyers\n          Association, and I don’t believe I can say it any better than David said it.\n\n                                               This – this change will provide certainty in the law.\n          It’s fairness. Certainly there is the opportunity under the laws that exist today for\n          plaintiffs to make essentially a double recovery, if they choose right. It encourages the\n          plaintiff a lot of times to settle with the principal defendant, and sometimes just roll\n          the dice on one that really don’t have that much exposure, because they don’t have\n          that downside risk. This is a fair way to handle this problem. It enhances the\n          opportunity and ability of plaintiffs and defendants to settle their litigation without\n          the potential for either the plaintiff or the defendant being second-guessed or creating\n          malpractice themselves by their conduct. We think this is a good law. We think that\n          certainly momentum ought to develop around it, given the fact that the people who\n          actually have to do this on a day-by-day basis all feel that this is the best way to\n          handle it, and we appreciate the opportunity that the Senator has given us to work\n          with him on this bill, because we think that this is a good response to this problem.\n\n                  CHAIR                      : I note in your card that you filed the position in\n          opposition to the bill as filed, but I think what you’ve told me now is that you would\n          need to change that.\n\n                  CHOATE                   : Yes, on the committee substitute, we’re absolutely in\n          favor, and I’m sorry. I wasn’t clear how to do that.\n\nId.\n\n      Mike Slack, representing the Texas Association of Trial Lawyers, testified in favor of S.B. 890.\n\n                   MIKE SLACK                : Mr. Chairman, Sen. Williams. I’m Mike Slack. I’m a\n          past president of TTLA, and regrettably, over the last 20 years, have had far too much\n          time invested in dealing with Chapter 33 settlement credit issues, where Texas has\n          migrated through some awfully unfortunate waters, resulting in a lot of gamesmanship,\n          and resulting in a lot of what I call judicial experimentation gone bad. I think I can\n          think of few moments where we have altered our laws that have been more positive\n          than the bill, the substitute bill you have in front of you today.

One, the election, the\n        ability to elect is something that’s very, very important to our clients. It’s really a\n        dollar issue for us in healthcare liability claims. We – we are not opposed to the notion\n        that everyone should get the election. We are only supportive of the notion that at\n        least that we should. In the context of House Bill 4, there were – there are several\n        provisions in House Bill 4 relating to, that have an impact on settlement credits that\n        we were not entirely comfortable with during the process. And, in fact, the provision\n        that this bill addresses was not in the engrossed version on the House side of the House\n        Bill 4 at all. We in particular, would not have supported the third party practice, and\n        the questions that raises about limitations. And we only ultimately supported of that\n        part of the bill when the exception for healthcare and liability claims was inserted\n        into House Bill 4 very late in the process in Chairman Nixon’s office when a whole\n        bunch of us were there. So, we don’t oppose everyone having the election, we only want\n        to attempt to make sure that we keep it.\n\n               CHAIR                   : Why, anecdotally, explain why the election is\n        important in a healthcare claim?\n\n                 HULL                    : Any case where we estimate that the sum of the\n        settling defendant’s percentage of responsibility, times the jury verdict, will be greater\n        than the dollar-for-dollar credit paid by the settling defendant, it is to our advantage\n        to take that percent. In any case, conversely, where the dollar-for-dollar credit we\n        think will work to our advantage, then we would want to take that. And, so it becomes\n        very much a dollar issue for us.\n\n               HULL                      : Under – under proportionate responsibility, as enacted\n        in House Bill 4 –\n\n                 HULL                    : Yes.\n\n                 CHAIR                    : Don’t you still get to reduce the liability by the sum of\n        the total of the responsible individuals until you get the – unless you’re, well, I mean\n        you get – you still get to reduce the reliability under those percentages of responsibility,\n        don’t you? Even if they settle?\n\nLegislative History of                            Page 11                          Capitol Research Services\nTex. S.B. 890                                                                                  Austin, Texas\n79th Leg., R.S. (2005)                                                                        (512)371-1440\n\f                                                          205: Senate Committee Hearings on S.B. 890\n\n\n                 HULL                       : We would get the – we would get the – under the\n        House Bill 4 scenario, we would get the percent, if that’s what we elected, or the\n        dollar-for-dollar credit. The two examples I’ve sketched out where it makes a\n        difference for us, is that if you assume the two defendants case, where the to-the-jury\n        defendant got 40%, the settling defendant got 60%, and the verdict was $700,000 and\n        there’s a $500,000 settlement. Then it works to the advantage of the defendant that’s\n        tried to elect the dollar – to – to elect the percent credit. But, if on the other hand you\n        think that the dollar-for-dollar credit is going to be less than the percent. And in\n        particular, it’s a problem for us because there is so many low limit positions. So still, if\n        you have a $200,000 defendant, who settles out, who is going to get a much greater\n        share, then we end up potentially picking that up depending on where our percent of\n        the responsibility falls.\n\n                CHAIR                   : You may have just answered it. But, why would the\n        healthcare claims be different than any other multiple defendant case?\n\n                 HULL                     : I don’t know that it is, and that’s why I say, we were\n        not really in favor of making it one way or the other exclusively, ever, because we\n        think, I mean, I have other than health care clients, myself, and it can be a problem in\n        those cases too. So –\n\n                CHAIR                     : Do you agree that, from time to time that the\n        possibility of the option or the election causes an impediment to settlement of parties to\n        the case?\n\n                 HULL                     : It probably does. I can’t tell you that it never does. I\n        really think any way you go. I mean we went – There was testimony about this last\n        time. We all have our experience of it. There is an advantage to one party or the other\n        depending on the case, under any of these circumstances. If you’re a dollar-for-dollar\n        person, and you’re on the plaintiff’s side, you might think it works to your advantage to\n        hold out because you can’t get enough. So – there are advantages to one party or the\n        other under any scenario that we have been thus far, able to come up with. We would\n        just, and if we’re going to re-visit this issue then, there is revisiting the issue of joining\n        responsible third parties, which is a looming terrible problem for us. Once you can name\n        a defendant against whom limitations has already expired, it raises substantial\n        problems. So, unless there is further questions, I’m done.\n\nId.\n\n   George Scott Christian, representing the Texas Civil justice League, testified in favor of the\nCommittee Substitute for S.B. 890.\n\n                 GEORGE CHRISTIAN : Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My name is George\n        Christian, and I’m an attorney representing the Texas Civil Justice League. We are in\n        support of the Committee Substitute for Senate Bill 890 for many of the reasons that\n        you’ve already heard. We think that it’s the best overall solution to this problem that\n        we’ve really been dealing with since 1987. As you know, Sen. Duncan, we’ve had these\n        settlement credits issues repeatedly in the last almost 20 years. And we believe that\n        the committee substitute is fair to everyone. I think the dollar-for-dollar credit in the\n        vast majority of cases, if not all cases, always squares up the parties, and the plaintiff\n        will get as close to one satisfaction rule as possible to do. Everybody gets full credit for\n        the dollars that have already been settled. There’s really no gamesmanship involved.\n        I agree with a lot of what Mike Hull said, about you know the benefits of an election.\n\nLegislative History of                             Page 12                          Capitol Research Services\nTex.

That is probably true. And – but, nevertheless, we believe that the law ought\n          to be the same for all defendants, and for all plaintiffs. We think that this treats\n          everybody equally. We think it squares the parties in the end of the day, which is\n          what you want to do. And we do think the current system of bifurcated settlement credit\n          is not justifiable from a policy standpoint and deters settlements. And that is a serious\n          problem. And we would like to see if we can’t get that addressed. And we appreciate\n          you and Sen. Williams dealing with this.\n\nId.\n\n      Chairman Duncan read the names of persons in support of S.B. 890 who did not wish to testify. Id.\n\n      S.B. 890 was left pending.

[SENATE RESEARCH CENTER, Bill Analysis for S.B. 890 – Committee Report (Substituted) (April 5,\n2005)]\n\n      The bill analysis reviewed the background and purpose of the bill.\n\n          AUTHOR’S/SPONSOR’S STATEMENT OF INTENT\n\n          Since the 1930s, Texas has recognized that an injured party is entitled to recover only\n          once for an injury. (Bradshaw v. Baylor, 126 Tex. 99, 101; 84 S.W.2d 703, 704 (1935)). The\n          “one-satisfaction” rule was codified by the Legislature in Chapter 33, Civil Practice\n          and Remedies Code, in 1987. Subsequent to the 1987 amendments, Chapter 33 allowed a\n          non-settling defendant to elect either a dollar-for-dollar credit for all settlements with\n          the plaintiff, a credit based on the percentage of liability assigned to the parties by\n          the trier of fact, or a statutory sliding scale. H.B. 4, the tort reform measure enacted by\n          the 78th Legislature, Regular Session, 2003, radically changed this scheme. It\n          eliminated the election of the dollar-for-dollar or sliding scale credit, except for those\n          sued for health care liability. Instead, non-settling defendants now receive credit only\n          for that percentage of fault that a trier of fact assigns to a settling person. Thus, if a jury\n          finds no liability for a settling person, the court may not credit any prior settlements\n          against the non-settling defendant’s liability.\n\n          The settlement credit scheme created by H.B. 4 eliminates the one-satisfaction rule\n          that has been part of Texas law for more than 70 years, except in medical liability\n          cases. This creates the potential for unjust windfalls for plaintiffs, who can now recover\n          far in excess of their total damages. This problem is acute in lawsuits involving\n          multiple defendants. For example, if a plaintiff sues ten defendants for $1 million in\n          damages, and nine defendants settle for $100,000 each, the plaintiff collects $900,000 in\n          settlements. If a jury then finds little or no liability for the settling defendants, the\n          tenth defendant is liable for the full $1 million. The plaintiff thus recovers $1.9\n          million, despite being awarded only $1 million in damages. This unjustly enriches the\n          plaintiff and penalizes the defendant who went to trial.\n\n\n\nLegislative History of                               Page 15                           Capitol Research Services\nTex. S.B. 890                                                                                      Austin, Texas\n79th Leg., R.S.

For example, a defendant could agree to settle a claim at trial for less by\n         agreeing with the plaintiff to wait to settle until after all sides have rested their\n         cases. It would then be far too late for non-settling defendants to introduce evidence of\n         the settling defendant’s proportionate responsibility. Such collusion not only\n         undermines the purpose of Texas’ proportionate responsibility law, which is designed\n         to ensure that parties only pay for their proportionate share of the plaintiff’s harm,\n         but it discourages defendants who believe they have little or no liability from trying\n         the lawsuit to a jury. Current law thus undermines the jury system and will vastly\n         increase the cost of litigation, especially in the mass tort arena.\n\n         Finally, H.B. 4 created an anomaly in Texas law by retaining the dollar-for-dollar\n         credit in medical liability cases but eliminating it in all others. There is no policy\n         rationale for this distinction. The law as it now stands creates a privileged class of\n         defendants.\n\n         C.S.S.B. 890 restores the election of the dollar-for-dollar credit, just as in medical\n         liability cases.\n\nId.\n\n      The analysis reviewed the rulemaking authority delegated by the bill.

It eliminated the\n          election of the dollar-for-dollar or sliding scale credit, except for those sued for health\n          care liability. Instead, non-settling defendants now receive credit only for that\n          percentage of fault that a trier of fact assigns to a settling person. Thus, if a jury finds no\n          liability for a settling person, the court may not credit any prior settlements against the\n          non-settling defendant's liability.\n\n          CSSB 890 restores the dollar-for-dollar settlement credit in civil actions, while\n          maintaining current law for health care liability claims.\n\nId.

Id.\n\n      The analysis summarized each section of the bill and noted the effective date.\n\n          ANALYSIS\n\n          CSSB 890 amends Section 33.012(b), Civil Practice and Remedies Code, by adding \"the\n          sum of the dollar amounts of all settlements\" and striking \"a percentage equal to each\n          settling person's percentage of responsibility\".\n\n          EFFECTIVE DATE\n\n          Upon passage, or, if it the Act does not receive the necessary vote, the Act takes effect\n          September 1, 2005.\n\nId.\n\n      The analysis also compared the “original” (S.B. 890 as filed) to the committee substitute.\n\n          COMPARISON OF ORIGINAL TO SUBSTITUTE\n\n          C.S.S.B. 890 differs from the original by restoring the current election of credit in\n          health care liability cases. The substitute continues current law for health care\n          liability claims, while restoring the dollar-for-dollar settlement credit in other civil\n          actions.\n\nId.\n\n      Lastly, the analysis explained the actions of the committee.

HRO is an agency of the Texas\nHouse which analyzes bills that come to the House floor for debate. HOUSE RESEARCH\nO RGANIZATION, S.B. 890 Bill Analysis (May 23, 2005). [Exhibit 20.]\n\n      The HRO analysis noted the subject of S.B. 890.\n\n         SUBJECT:\n\n         Dollar-for-dollar credit against amount of recovery in most civil actions\n\nId.\n\n      The HRO analysis reviewed the background of S.B. 890 and summarized its provisions.\n\n         BACKGROUND:\n\n         Civil Practice and Remedies Code, sec. 33.012, states that if a plaintiff settles with one\n         or more defendants and goes to trial against any other defendant, then any amount the\n         plaintiff is awarded against the defendant at trial must be reduced by a percentage\n         equal to each settling party’s percentage of responsibility. Defendants in health care\n         liability claims may choose to have the amount t hey owe to the plaintiff reduced by\n         either a percentage equal to each settling party’s percentage of responsibility or by the\n         total dollar sum of all settlements.\n\n         DIGEST:\n\n         SB 890 would amend sec. 33.012 to change the amount that an award against a\n         defendant could be reduced from a percentage credit based on a party's responsibility to\n         a dollar-for-dollar credit based on the sum of all settlements. Defendants in health\n         care liability cases still could choose their reduction method.\n\n         The bill would take immediate effect if finally passed by a two –thirds record vote of\n         the membership of each house. Otherwise, it would take effect September 1, 2005. The\n         bill would apply to all actions commenced on or after the effective date, or pending on\n         the effective date and in which the trial or any new trial or retrial begins on or after\n         the effective date. For actions commenced before the effective date, the former law\n         would continue in effect for any trial, new trial, or retrial in progress on the effective\n         date.\n\nId.\n\n      The HRO analysis reviewed the arguments of the supporters and opponents of the bill.\n\n         SUPPORTERS SAY:\n\n         Requiring a dollar-for-dollar reduction of damage awards would be more fair.\n         Plaintiffs are limited by law to only one full recovery, but under sec. 33.012 they are\n         sometimes able to recover more than the amount authorized by the judge or jury. This\n         could happen in a case where the plaintiff settled with defendant A and went to trial\n         with defendant B, but the court found that defendant A was not responsible. The\n         plaintiff would have collected from defendant A and would be entitled to a full\nLegislative History of                            Page 20                          Capitol Research Services\nTex.

Requiring a dollar-for-dollar reduction would\n           decrease the amount defendant B had to pay the plaintiff by the amount that\n           defendant A already had paid. This could ensure that the plaintiff received only one\n           recovery and no more.\n\n           Requiring dollar-for-dollar credits also would reduce litigation between co-defendants\n           seeking to avoid having to pay part of the recovery to the plaintiff because the dollar-\n           for-dollar system is straightforward and not capable of being abused or manipulated by\n           any co-defendant.\n\n           OPPONENTS SAY:\n\n           There is no reasonable basis for defendants in health care liability cases to have a\n           choice between a dollar-for-dollar credit and a percentage credit. For the sake of\n           fairness and consistency, all defendants should be subject to the dollar-for-dollar credit,\n           with no type of defendant receiving special treatment.\n\nId.\n\n       The HRO analysis also contained a notes section.\n\n           NOTES:\n\n           The Senate-passed version would have applied the dollar-for-dollar credit to all\n           defendants, including defendants in health care liability cases.\n\nId.\n\n\n\n\nHouse Floor Debate on S.B. 890\n\nSecond Reading: May 24\n\n    S.B. 890 came before the House on May 24.

(2005)                                                                        (512)371-1440\n\f                                                                    205: H.B. 890 Signed by the Governor\n\n\n         Since the 1930s, Texas has recognized that an injured party is entitled to recover only\n         once for an injury. (Bradshaw v. Baylor, 126 Tex. 99, 101; 84 S.W.2d 703, 704 (1935)). The\n         “one-satisfaction” rule was codified by the Legislature in Chapter 33, Civil Practice\n         and Remedies Code, in 1987. Subsequent to the 1987 amendments, Chapter 33 allowed a\n         non-settling defendant to elect either a dollar-for-dollar credit for all settlements with\n         the plaintiff, a credit based on the percentage of liability assigned to the parties by\n         the trier of fact, or a statutory sliding scale. H.B. 4, the tort reform measure enacted by\n         the 78th Legislature, Regular Session, 2003, radically changed this scheme. It\n         eliminated the election of the dollar-for-dollar or sliding scale credit, except for those\n         sued for health care liability. Instead, non-settling defendants now receive credit only\n         for that percentage of fault that a trier of fact assigns to a settling person. Thus, if a jury\n         finds no liability for a settling person, the court may not credit any prior settlements\n         against the non-settling defendant’s liability.\n\n         The settlement credit scheme created by H.B. 4 eliminates the one-satisfaction rule\n         that has been part of Texas law for more than 70 years, except in medical liability\n         cases. This creates the potential for unjust windfalls for plaintiffs, who can now recover\n         far in excess of their total damages. This problem is acute in lawsuits involving\n         multiple defendants. For example, if a plaintiff sues ten defendants for $1 million in\n         damages, and nine defendants settle for $100,000 each, the plaintiff collects $900,000 in\n         settlements. If a jury then finds little or no liability for the settling defendants, the\n         tenth defendant is liable for the full $1 million. The plaintiff thus recovers $1.9\n         million, despite being awarded only $1 million in damages. This unjustly enriches the\n         plaintiff and penalizes the defendant who went to trial.\n\n         Eliminating the dollar-for-dollar credit also creates the potential for collusive\n         settlements. For example, a defendant could agree to settle a claim at trial for less by\n         agreeing with the plaintiff to wait to settle until after all sides have rested their\n         cases. It would then be far too late for non-settling defendants to introduce evidence of\n         the settling defendant’s proportionate responsibility. Such collusion not only\n         undermines the purpose of Texas’ proportionate responsibility law, which is designed\n         to ensure that parties only pay for their proportionate share of the plaintiff’s harm,\n         but it discourages defendants who believe they have little or no liability from trying\n         the lawsuit to a jury. Current law thus undermines the jury system and will vastly\n         increase the cost of litigation, especially in the mass tort arena.\n\n         Finally, H.B. 4 created an anomaly in Texas law by retaining the dollar-for-dollar\n         credit in medical liability cases but eliminating it in all others. There is no policy\n         rationale for this distinction. The law as it now stands creates a privileged class of\n         defendants.\n\n         S.B. 890 restores the election of the dollar-for-dollar credit, just as in medical liability\n         cases.\n\nId.\n\n      The analysis reviewed the rulemaking authority delegated by the bill.

STATEMENT OF THE CASE\n         This is a breach of contract case involving a local Courtyard by Marriott\n\nHotel (the “Project”), located on East Ben White Boulevard, near Bergstrom\n\nInternational Airport. (CR187; App. A). 1 The foundation of the Project failed in\n\nnumerous respects and resulted in varied injuries to the property, resulting in\n\n$7,536,624.00 of claimed past, present, and future damages. (7RR48; 9RR123-\n\n124, 136; 7RR16-18, 26-39; 3RR133-136; PX-151, 16RR1-1145; 10RR29-31). As\n\nthe original owner’s successor in interest and assignee, RLJ II-C Austin Air, LP;\n\nRLJ II-C Austin Air Lessee, LP; and RLJ Lodging Fund II Acquisitions, LLC\n\n(“RLJ” collectively), 2 alleged that the general contractor, EBCO General\n\nContractor, Ltd. (the “General Contractor”), the geotechnical engineer, Terracon\n\nConsultants, Inc. (the “Soils Engineer”), and the architect, Elness, Swenson,\n\nGraham, Inc. (the “Architect”) failed to perform as specifically and individually\n\npromised in three separate and independent contracts. (CR184-218; App. A).\n\n         After the trial court entered rulings on various pre-trial motions, the only\n\nclaims being prosecuted were for breach of contract against the Architect, the\n\nGeneral Contractor, and the Soils Engineer. (CR1057-62; 1063-64; 1083-84;\n\nCR1708-1710). The Soils Engineer settled its contractual liability with RLJ before\n\n1\n  The Clerk’s Record is cited as “CR”; First Supplemental Clerk’s Record as “1SCR”; Second\nSupplemental Clerk’s Record as “2SCR”; Third Supplemental Clerk’s Record as “3SCR”.\n2\n  White Lodging Services Corporation, Inc. “assigned the contracts and causes of action in this\nlawsuit to the RLJ Plaintiffs in this case.” (CR1124; App. B.)\n\n                                              1\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\ftrial. (CR1080-81; CR1710). The General Contractor settled during trial. (7RR105-\n\n108; CR1710).3 Trial proceeded on RLJ’s breach of contract claim against the\n\nArchitect.\n\n         The jury found that the Architect “fail[ed] to comply with the Architectural\n\nContract regarding the structural engineering services required by the contract” in\n\nanswer to Question 2 (the “Structural Engineering Question”) (CR1126; App. B).\n\nThe jury then determined the amount that would reasonably compensate for\n\ndamages “that resulted from [the Architect’s] failure to comply with the\n\nArchitectural Contract” as found in the Structural Engineering Question. (CR1125-\n\n27; App. B). The total amount of damages found by the jury was $700,000 for the\n\ndifference in value from the hotel as constructed and the value had the Architect\n\ncomplied with the Architectural Contract, $70,000 for the cost of barrier\n\nremediation resulting from the Architect’s failure to comply, and $15,000 for the\n\nreasonable and necessary cost of repairs to the hotel due to the Architect’s failure\n\nto comply. (Id.)\n\n         After trial, the Architect moved for credit under the “one satisfaction rule”\n\nfor sums the General Contractor and the Soils Engineer (“Settling Defendants”\n\ncollectively) paid in settlement of the contract claims against them. (CR1173-\n\n1228). The trial court deemed the credit applicable because it concluded the\n\n3\n The Reporter’s Record is cited by “[Volume Number]RR.” Exhibits are cited to page or pages\nof the Reporter’s Record on which they or the pertinent parts thereof appear.\n\n                                            2\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\fdamages were indivisible, despite the fact the court submitted and the jury found\n\ndamages limited to those “that resulted from [the Architect’s] failure to comply\n\nwith the Architectural Contract . . . .” (CR1437-41; CR1127; App. B, C).\n\nMoreover, the trial court concluded that the absence of contractual joint and\n\nseveral liability did not render the one satisfaction rule inapplicable. (CR1437-41;\n\nApp. C).\n\n         Applying the one satisfaction rule, the Court ordered that RLJ recover the\n\nfrom the Architect $516,650.96, which was the sum of the jury’s award of\n\n$785,000 as actual damages resulting from the Architect’s breach of contract and\n\nthe attorney’s fee award of $901,650.96, less $1,170,000, which was the amount of\n\nthe settlements of the Settling Defendants. (CR1711; App. D).\n\n         The parties agreed to try the attorney’s fees to the court instead of the jury.\n\nRLJ presented evidence of its reasonable and necessary attorney’s fees for\n\nasserting the contractual claims against the Architect, the General Contractor, and\n\nthe Soils Engineer. (3SCR3-611; 2SCR1603-05). However, the trial court only\n\nawarded fees for the contractual claim against the Architect and rendered judgment\n\naccording to its application of the one satisfaction rule and its segregation of\n\nattorney’s fees. (CR1708-1712; App. D). The Architect timely filed its notice of\n\nappeal (CR1907-13) and RLJ timely perfected its cross-appeal (1SCR3-4).\n\n\n\n\n                                            3\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\f                                II.   ISSUES PRESENTED\nA.       Whether the trial court erred in applying the one satisfaction rule and thus\n\n         reducing the damages found to have resulted from the specific breach of the\n\n         Architectural Contract by the Architect by the amounts received in\n\n         settlement for damages resulting from the breach of the different contractual\n\n         duties owed by the Soils Engineer and the General Contractor (CR1173-79,\n\n         1437-41; 2SCR1578-97, 1637-1745) including but not limited to the\n\n         following sub-issues:\n\n         1.       Whether, in addition to an indivisible injury, joint and several liability\n\n                  is required for application of the one satisfaction rule, and, if so,\n\n                  whether the liable and settling parties must have contracted for the\n\n                  same performance to deem a contractual liability joint and several?\n\n         2.       Whether the one satisfaction rule does not apply due to the absence of\n\n                  an “indivisible injury” because: (a) the damages found by the jury\n\n                  were specifically limited to those caused by the contractual breach of\n\n                  the non-settling defendant; (b) the non-settling defendant in its closing\n\n                  argument advised the jury that it should not include damages it\n\n                  deemed attributable to the Settling Defendants; or (c) both?\n\n         3.       Whether the one satisfaction rule does not apply unless the liability of\n\n                  the non-settling defendant is based on a non-contractual theory?\n\n\n                                               4\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\f         4.       Whether application of the one satisfaction rule violates article I, §16\n\n                  of the Texas Constitution guaranteeing freedom of contract by\n\n                  depriving a party of the benefit of a contractual agreement with\n\n                  another and applying those benefits to offset the liability of a third-\n\n                  party?\n\n         5.       Whether the Architect waived the right to seek application of the one\n\n                  satisfaction rule by any one or more of the following: (a) failing to\n\n                  specially except to a lack of settlement allocation; (b) failing to plead\n\n                  the rule as an affirmative defense, (c) inviting the jury to exclude from\n\n                  its damage finding damages caused by the Settling Defendants; or\n\n                  (d)failing to object to a jury question that permitted the jury to only\n\n                  find damages attributable to the Architect’s breach of contract?\n\nB.       Either if there was a joint and several contractual liability between the\n\n         Architect and the Settling Defendants or if the damages were awarded for an\n\n         indivisible injury, whether the trial court erred in refusing to award RLJ\n\n         reasonable and necessary attorney’s fees incurred in the presentation of the\n\n         breach of contract claims against the Architect, the General Contractor and\n\n         the Soils Engineer and in awarding those fees attributable only to the\n\n         presentation of the claim against the Architect? (3SCR3-611; 2SCR1603-05,\n\n         1600-01, 1711).\n\n\n                                               5\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\f                           III.   STATEMENT OF FACTS\n         The record in this case does not support the application of the one\n\nsatisfaction offset against the damages found caused by the Architect. First, the\n\nevidence shows separate contractual duties, not common or overlapping duties.\n\nThus, there is no basis for joint and several liability, a sine qua non for application\n\nof the one satisfaction rule. Second, the jury, in answer to Question 3, determined\n\nthe damages caused by the Architect. The jury did not find an indivisible amount\n\nof damages caused by the settling defendants and the Architect. Third, the\n\nArchitect invited the jury to reduce the damages finding based on damages caused\n\nby the settling defendants. Indeed, the Architect did not raise the issue of one\n\nsatisfaction until after the trial, failing to plead it, specially except regarding it, and\n\nfailing to object to either the omission of a segregated damages question or to\n\nQuestion 3, which focused on damages caused by the Architect only. Finally,\n\nQuestion 3 and the record show that the jury reduced the amount of damages it\n\nawarded resulting from the Architect’s breach to remove amounts caused by the\n\nnon-settling parties. Thus, the record shows that recovery of the full amount\n\nawarded in answer to Question 3 did not present even the possibility of a double\n\nrecovery or more than one satisfaction.\n\n         Having suffered over $7 million in damages, receiving settlement funds of\n\n$1,170,000 for the damages caused by the breaches by the General Contractor and\n\n\n                                            6\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\fSoils Engineer, plus the jury award of $785,000 for the damages caused by the\n\nArchitect, certainly would not amount to more than one satisfaction. Indeed,\n\ndespite three contracts for millions of dollars and separate and distinct promised\n\nperformances, RLJ received a building with serious deficiencies that have caused\n\nloss and will continue to do so. Yet, RLJ is forced to accept the Architect\n\nbenefiting from the other’s breaches of contract to which it was not a party by\n\nreceiving two damage reductions or offsets: one by the limited damage inquiry in\n\nthe jury charge and a second from the application of the one satisfaction rule.\n\nA.       Separate Contracts With Separate and Distinct\n         Promised Performances on the Project.\n         The contracts with the Architect, the General Contractor, and the Soils\n\nEngineer did not promise the same performance.\n\n             • The Soils Engineer agreed to assess site conditions and recommend\n               specific foundation design parameters based on the same. (PX-3;\n               12RR6-11; 3RR161; App. E).\n\n             • The General Contractor agreed to build the structure designed by the\n               Architect with the assistance of its Structural Engineer, and comply\n               with the plans and specifications of the Project. (PX-48; 12RR569-75;\n               App. F).\n\n             • The Architect, with the assistance of its Structural Engineer, agreed to\n               prepare an appropriate foundation plan. (PX-15; 12RR30, 35, 47, 49;\n               App. G).\n\n         The Architectural Contract (PX-15; 12RR26-77; App. G) provided, among\n\nother things, that the Architect’s design services “include normal structural,\n\n\n                                            7\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\fmechanical and electrical engineering” (12RR39) along with “[s]tructural\n\n[e]ngineering design, document preparation and coordination” through “[o]ur\n\nStructural Engineering firm...Marlin Bridges Associates, Inc.” (12RR47). In\n\nconjunction with its retained Structural Engineer (PX-15; 12RR28), the Architect\n\npromised to provide a foundation design for the Project. (PX-15; 12RR30, 35, 47,\n\n49; PX-13; 12RR17-25).\n\n         The original owner White Lodging Services Corporation, Inc. contracted for\n\nthe services of the Soils Engineer to provide “geotechnical services” including\n\nevaluating soil conditions and providing recommendations which would address\n\n“[f]oundation design and construction.” (PX-3; 12RR6-11; App. E). This\n\ninformation was to be supplied to the Architect and its Structural Engineer in\n\nconnection with the Project’s foundation design. (PX-15; 12RR48; App. G).\n\n         The original owner also separately contracted with the General Contractor to\n\nbuild the Project according to the Architect’s plans and specifications. (PX-48;\n\n12RR569-75; App. F). The General Contractor agreed “that materials and\n\nequipment furnished will be of good quality[,]…that the work will be free from\n\ndefect…and will conform to the requirements” (PX-48; 12RR616; App. F) of the\n\nArchitect’s plans and specifications. (PX-48; 12RR610-11).\n\n         After the construction was completed, the Project was found to have cracks\n\nin the slab and grade, shifting door frames, cracks in partition walls, cracks in the\n\n\n                                           8\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\fswimming pool, and perimeter drainage problems. (3RR118; 4RR78-79; 7RR47).\n\nInvestigation revealed that the Project suffered from geotechnical engineering\n\ndeficiencies, foundation design defects, and construction defects (DX-147;\n\n17RR514; 7RR49-62), in breach of the separate contractual duties undertaken by\n\nthe Architect, the General Contractor, and the Soils Engineer.\n\nB.       Separate and Distinct Acts and Omissions Breaching\n         Separate and Distinct Contractual Obligations.\n         The Soils Engineer allegedly breached its contract by, among other things,\n\nfailing to account for the amount of necessary site excavation. This breach resulted\n\nin soil expansion greater than the estimate in the Soils Engineer’s report. (CR192-\n\n93, 197-98, 200-01, 209-12). The Soils Engineer miscalculated the potential\n\nvertical rise (PVR) of the soil and failed to recommend that enough of the soil be\n\ndug out and replaced with special engineered soil that did not have the expansive\n\nproperties of the native soil, called “select fill.” (DX-147; 17RR510).\n\n         The Architect breached its contract by failing to provide a foundation design\n\nthat was adequate for the site. Specifically, the Architect’s Structural Engineer\n\nimproperly designed the foundation and other structures by, among other things,\n\nfailing to account for the limitations and recommendations in the Soils Engineer’s\n\nreport, including designing a foundation insufficiently robust for the conditions\n\nreported by the Soils Engineer. (4RR122-124; 4RR150-151). The Architect’s\n\nStructural Engineer further failed to follow the Soil Engineer’s recommendations\n\n                                           9\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\fconcerning the appropriate type of foundation design. (4RR122-124; 4RR150-\n\n151).\n\n         The General Contractor was alleged to have failed to build according to the\n\nplans and specifications supplied and provide a building free from defects, contrary\n\nto its promised contractual performance. (CR188-89). Richard Reeves, a\n\nconstruction manager expert, testified concerning the General Contractor’s specific\n\nconstruction omissions and defects, meaning that certain construction failed to\n\ncomply with the plans and specifications provided by the Architect. (7RR49-62).\n\nThese included:\n\n              • A missing foundation grade beam (7RR53-54),\n\n              • Reinforcement of the concrete slab with welded wire mesh\n                lacking polypropylene fibers (7RR58),\n\n              • Unconnected and improperly constructed drains (7RR49-51,\n                55-58, 60-62),\n\n              • Improperly constructed “clean-out” access points to drains,\n                sewer lines and vents that were covered with flooring and\n                drywall (7RR51-53, 56-57), and\n\n              • Concrete overpours that improperly encased pipes in concrete.\n                (7RR58-60).\n\nUnder Question 3 in the charge, the jury was asked to determine the amount of\n\ndamages caused by the Architect, and thus it was allowed and indeed encouraged\n\n\n\n\n                                          10\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\fto reduce its damages award based on breaches of contract by the Settling\n\nDefendants. (CR1127; App. B).\n\nC.       Suit and Settlements By the Soils Engineer and the General Contractor.\n         As the original owner’s successor in interest and assignee, RLJ sued, among\n\nothers, the Architect, the Soils Engineer, and the General Contractor for damages\n\nto the Project resulting from various breaches of contract that caused foundation\n\nand drainage problems. (CR188-218; App. A). Through pre-trial summary\n\njudgments and non-suits, the suit was confined as matter of law to RLJ’s contract\n\nclaims against the General Contractor, the Soils Engineer and the Architect.\n\n(CR1708, 1710; 2SCR42; App. D). Before trial, and after the trial court restricted\n\nthe case to contract claims, the Soils Engineer settled the contract claim against it\n\nfor $70,000. (CR1080-81; CR1710; App. D). During trial, RLJ settled its contract\n\nclaims against the General Contractor for $1.1 million. (7RR105-08; CR1710,\n\n1226; App. D). As noted, the evidence showed that the damages to the Project\n\nfrom all contractual breaches of the Architect and Settling Defendants was at least\n\n$7,536,224. (7RR48; 9RR123-124, 136; 7RR16-18, 26-39; 3RR133-136; PX-151,\n\n16RR1-1145; 10RR29-31). During closing arguments, RLJ argued that only\n\n$6,029,299 in damages was attributable to the Architect, the rest being attributable\n\nto the Settling Defendants and other responsible parties. (10RR29-31). The\n\nArchitect similarly argued that the portion of RLJ’s damages attributable to the\n\n\n                                          11\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\fArchitect was “zero,” because the fault was attributable to other parties. (10RR54-\n\n56).\n\n         RLJ’s contract claims against the Architect were then submitted to the jury.\n\n(CR1121-29; App. B). The jury found that the Architect breached its contract “by\n\nfailing to comply … regarding the structural engineering services required.”\n\n(CR1126; App. B). Finding that the Architect breached the Architectural Contract\n\nin response to the Structural Engineering Question, the jury awarded $785,000 in\n\ndamages that resulted from the Architect’s breach. (CR1125, 1127; App. B).\n\nD.       The Trial Court Rules That the One Satisfaction Rule Applies.\n         Four days later, the Architect claimed for the first time a credit for the\n\nGeneral Contractor’s and Soils Engineer’s settlements under the one satisfaction\n\nrule. (CR1173-79). After entertaining RLJ’s response (2SCR1578-97), the trial\n\ncourt ruled that the one satisfaction rule applied solely because it deemed the\n\nclaims against the Architect, the General Contractor, and the Soils Engineer all to\n\nbe for one “indivisible injury.” (CR1439). It presumed the General Contractor’s\n\nand Soils Engineer’s settlements were payment for the same injury for which the\n\njury awarded damages against the Architect. (CR1438). The trial court further\n\nreasoned “RLJ needed to identify that category of [divisible] damages [against the\n\n\n\n\n                                          12\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\fGeneral Contractor] and state the amount apportioned to it.” 4 (CR1438). RLJ\n\nsought reconsideration of the trial court’s letter ruling via a Motion for Judgment\n\n(2SCR1606-1636) and a Motion for Reconsideration (2SCR1637-1745). The trial\n\ncourt denied both motions. (CR1905; 2SCR2102).\n\nE.       Attorney’s Fees Allowed Only for Breach of Contract Claim\n         Against the Architect.\n         Per stipulation, RLJ submitted its attorney’s fees claim for resolution by the\n\ncourt. The trial court’s letter ruling suggested that RLJ was entitled to recover fees\n\nfor presenting the contractual claims against the Architect, the General Contractor\n\nand the Soils Engineer. (CR1400; App. C). RLJ filed an amended application for\n\nthose attorney’s fees in the amount of $1,388,019. (3SCR3-611; 2SCR1603-05).\n\nThe trial court, however, ultimately decided to award attorney’s fees only for the\n\nbreach of contract case against the Architect. (CR1711; App. D).\n\nF.       The Trial Court Renders Final Judgment.\n         The trial court rendered judgment for RLJ in the principal sum of\n\n$551,650.96, being the difference between the sum of the damage and attorney’s\n\nfees award against the Architect, less the sum of the settlements from the Settling\n\nDefendants. (CR1711; App. D).\n\n\n\n4\n  The trial court was not clear whether this identification needed to be contained in the settlement\nagreements themselves or be presented in the evidence to the jury. (CR1438). RLJ was not given\nthe opportunity to segregate or apportion damages to satisfy the trial court’s reasoning before the\ncase was submitted to the jury.\n\n                                                13\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\f                           IV.   SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\n\nA.       The One Satisfaction Rule Does Not Apply.\n         The one satisfaction rule applies if, and only if, the liability of judgment\n\ndebtor and settling defendants is joint and several. Indivisible injury alone is only\n\nsufficient to establish joint and several tort, not contractual, liability. If the one\n\nsatisfaction rule applies at all, it applies in this case only if there is joint and several\n\ncontractual liability. To have such liability, the Architect and the Settling\n\nDefendants must each have breached a promise to provide the same performance.\n\nHere, the promised performances were not the same, so the one satisfaction rule\n\ndoes not apply. Even if “indivisible” damages alone somehow is assumed\n\narguendo to have created joint and several contractual liability, the jury’s damages\n\nfinding was limited to the damages resulting from the Architect’s failure to\n\ncomply. (CR1127; App. B).\n\n         Further, RLJ would urge that the one satisfaction rule simply should not\n\napply in contract cases such as this. The one satisfaction rule was judicially created\n\nto address a problem created by a statute that only applied to tort liability.\n\nApplying it in contract cases deprives the injured party of the benefit of its\n\nsettlement agreement and transfers that benefit to the wrongdoer in violation of the\n\nfreedom of contract guaranteed by Texas Constitution article I, section 16.\n\n\n\n\n                                            14\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\f         In any event, the Architect waived application of the one satisfaction rule. It\n\nfailed to plead this affirmative defense, was guilty of laches in waiting until after\n\nthe verdict to assert it, failed to object to the failure of the damages question to\n\nsegregate damages as it contends should have been done, and argued for the\n\napportionment of damages in its closing argument.\n\n         For all these reasons, as more fully articulated below, the trial court’s\n\ndecision to credit RLJ’s settlement with the General Contractor and Soils Engineer\n\nto the damages the jury assessed against the Architect was erroneous. Accordingly,\n\nthe judgment must be modified to restore the damages awarded to RLJ by the jury\n\nfor the Architect’s breach of contract.\n\nB.       RLJ Entitled To Attorney’s Fees For the Presentation of the Breach of\n         Contract Claims Against the Architect, General Contractor, and Soils\n         Engineer Either If These Parties Shared a Joint and Several\n         Contractual Duty Or If the Damages Were “Indivisible.”\n         If multiple defendants breached the same contractual duty, RLJ was entitled\n\nto recover attorney’s fees for the presentation against all those defendants because\n\nthe preparation and proof would have been necessary for the case against any one\n\nof them. RLJ maintains that the Architect and the Settling Defendants here did not\n\nbreach contractual undertakings to perform the same duties and, therefore, there\n\nwas no joint and several contractual liability among the Architect and the Settling\n\nDefendants. However, if this Court holds otherwise, then it necessarily follows that\n\nRLJ is entitled to recover its attorney’s fees for cases against the Architect, the\n\n                                            15\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\fGeneral Contractor and the Soils Engineer because the same preparation and proof\n\nwould have been necessary for the case against any one of them. If so, there was\n\nno need to limit the recoverable attorney’s fees only to those attributable to the\n\nbreach of contract case against the Architect.\n\n         The same is also true if the trial court correctly ruled that the damages for\n\nthe Architect’s breach were indivisible from those allegedly caused by the Settling\n\nDefendants. Again, RLJ maintains that the damages here were necessarily\n\nsegregated by the nature of the damages question and under the arguments of the\n\nparties to the jury and presents this contention only if this Court determines that the\n\none satisfaction rule applies.\n\n                           V.   ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITIES\n         The one satisfaction rule is intended under appropriate circumstances to\n\nprevent a plaintiff from receiving a double recovery. It was never been intended to\n\nbe used to reduce damages found to have been caused by the remaining defendant\n\nby the amount of settlements entered with settling defendants. As applied in this\n\ncase, the one satisfaction rule does not achieve the purpose of defeating a double\n\nrecovery absent joint and several liability and indivisible damages. In fact, as\n\napplied, the rule violates Texas public policy encouraging settlement and the\n\nfreedom to contract. The application here provides a strong disincentive to partial\n\nsettlements, particularly in construction contract cases. In any event, the rule was\n\n\n                                           16\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\fnot timely and appropriately raised by the Architect through timely pleading,\n\nexceptions, objections to the charge, and indeed the Architect invited the jury to do\n\nits own reduction in answering the damages question prior to applying the one\n\nsatisfaction rule.\n\nA.       The One Satisfaction Rule Does Not Apply.\n         The decision to apply the one satisfaction rule was erroneous for many\n\nreasons. First, the rule requires at a minimum joint and several liability of the\n\ndefendants. Here, the Architect was tried only on a breach of contract theory. Joint\n\nand several liability is limited to tort law. There was no evidence here of a joint\n\nand common contractual duty among the settling defendants and the Architect.\n\nSecond, the damages reduced by the trial court here were not so-called common or\n\nindivisible damages. Instead, the jury found only “damages that resulted from [the\n\nArchitect’s] failure to comply with the Architectural Contract . . . .” Finally, the\n\nrecord does not in any way support the notion that RLJ would be getting a double\n\nrecovery absent application of the one satisfaction rule. The damages sought and as\n\nto which evidence was presented involved a claim of over $7 million. The jury was\n\npermitted and invited by counsel for the Architect to reduce its damage finding as\n\nto damages caused by others based on the fact the Court’s charge required that the\n\ndamages had to have resulted from the Architect’s breach of contract. The jury is\n\npresumed to have read the charge and followed it. Thus, this is not a case of a\n\n\n                                         17\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\fdouble recovery; instead, with application of the settlements relating to separate\n\ncontractual duties under the one satisfaction rule, it is the Architect who is unfairly\n\nreceiving a double reduction.\n\n         1.       This Case Involves Contractual, Not Tort, Liability.\n         Because of pre-trial rulings and non-suits, the only claims pending before\n\ntrial were RLJ’s contract claims against the General Contractor, the Soils Engineer\n\nand the Architect. (CR1708,1710; 2SCR42; App. D). Before trial, RLJ settled with\n\nthe Soils Engineer for $70,000. (CR1080-81; CR1710; App. D). During trial, RLJ\n\nsettled with the General Contractor for $1.1 million. (7RR105-08l; CR1226, 1710;\n\nApp. D). Only RLJ’s contract claims against the Architect were submitted to the\n\njury.\n\n         Not only was the Architect’s liability purely contractual, the damages sought\n\nwere only recoverable in contract. (CR1127; App. B). The alleged harm was\n\neconomic loss to the subject of the contract itself – i.e., the Project. “When the\n\ninjury is only the economic loss to the subject of a contract itself, the action sounds\n\nin contract alone.” Jim Walters Homes v. Reed, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1499803\"><a href=\"/opinion/1499803/jim-walter-homes-inc-v-reed/\"><span class=\"volume\">711</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">617</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 617-18 (Tex.\n\n1986).\n\n         After trial, the Architect asserted for the first time it was entitled to credit\n\nunder the one satisfaction rule for the Settling Defendants’ settlements. (CR1173-\n\n1179). The trial court agreed (CR1710; 1437-41; App. C, D), conflating the tort\n\n\n                                            18\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\fjoint and several liability with contract. According to the trial court, “Each party is\n\nliable for its own [contractual] breach which by itself results in indivisible\n\ndamages[, j]ust as with tortfeasors who breach different common law duties that\n\neach proximately cause an indivisible damage.” (CR1439; App. C; emphasis\n\nadded).\n\n         2.       The One Satisfaction Rule Was Developed to Address Settlements\n                  In Tort Cases With Less Than All Defendants After the\n                  Legislature Authorized Joint and Several Liability.\n         More than sixty years ago, the Texas Supreme Court deemed the risk of a\n\ndouble recovery no justification for depriving a plaintiff of a favorable settlement.\n\n         [O]ur courts seem to have embraced the philosophy … that it is better\n         that the injured party lose all of his damages than that any of several\n         wrongdoers should pay more of the damages than he individually and\n         separately caused. If such has been the law, from the standpoint of\n         justice it should not have been ….\n\nLanders v. East Texas Salt Water Disposal Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">151</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Tex.</span> <span class=\"page\">251</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2390789\"><a href=\"/opinion/2390789/landers-v-east-tex-salt-water-disposal-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">248</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">731</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n734 (1952) (emphasis added). Fully understanding when the one satisfaction rule\n\nshould and should not apply requires an appreciation of its history and why it was\n\ncreated in the first place.\n\n         The one satisfaction rule was developed to correct a statutorily-created\n\nanomaly. In the early Twentieth Century, the Legislature attempted to alleviate the\n\nharshness of the common law prohibition of contribution claims by creating a\n\ncontribution cause of action against other tortfeasors when a defendant was held\n\n\n                                           19\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\fliable for more than its per capita share of liability. But the statute did not address\n\nwhat happened if the plaintiff settled with one of the other defendants. The courts\n\nresponded by creating the one satisfaction rule. If a defendant is subject to liability\n\nthrough joint and several liability for more than the damages he or she caused, a\n\nsettlement by that defendant involves something that overlaps with a remaining\n\nnon-settling joint and several defendant, thus allowing consideration of double\n\nrecovery issues. Therefore, outside the context of joint and several tort liability,\n\nthere is no other recognized justification for imposing the one satisfaction rule.\n\n                  a.       Generally There Was No Joint & Several\n                           Tort Liability at Common Law.\n         At common law, a tort suit could not be asserted against multiple defendants\n\nfor damages to which each defendant contributed unless the defendants acted\n\naccording to a common plan or scheme. Sun Oil Co. v.

The One Satisfaction Rule Was Designed to Address\n                           Joint and Several Liability In Tort Cases Only.\n         After the one satisfaction rule was adopted, the Texas Supreme Court\n\nabolished the common-law rule in Robicheaux, 23 S.W.2d at 715, that prevented\n\njoining multiple defendants in a single suit to impose joint and several liability for\n\nindependent torts. In Landers v. East Texas Salt Water Disposal Co., the court\n\nruled that when\n\n         tortious acts of two or more wrongdoers join to produce an indivisible\n         injury, that is, an injury which from its nature cannot be apportioned\n         with reasonable certainty to the individual wrongdoers, all of the\n         wrongdoers will be held jointly and severally liable for the entire\n\n\ndifferent, but cases continue, we would respectfully submit, to incorrectly recite that it is\nunnecessary to plead the one satisfaction rule though the reason why no longer exists.\n\n                                             22\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\f         damages and the injured party may proceed to judgment against any\n         one separately or against all in one suit. If fewer than the whole\n         number of wrongdoers are joined as defendants to plaintiff’s suit,\n         those joined may by proper cross action under the governing rules\n         bring in those omitted.\n\n248 S.W.2d at 734 (emphasis added). Landers abolished Robicheaux’s concerted\n\naction requirement for establishing joint and several tort liability. Under Landers,\n\nindivisible injury alone was enough in tort cases to establish joint and several\n\nliability. A party had to be jointly and severally liable for the entire damages, not\n\njust its share. Thus, when that party settled, they theoretically could have settled\n\nfor more than just their individual liability for just the damages they caused.\n\nAccordingly, in that setting, the plaintiff had the opportunity to ultimately settle\n\nwith multiple defendants for an amount greater than the plaintiff’s overall injury.\n\n         3.       The One Satisfaction Rule Only Applies\n                  In Cases Involving Joint Liability.\n         The one satisfaction rule’s historical development demonstrates it was\n\nintended to address a problem unique to settlements with less than all jointly and\n\nseverally liable defendants in tort cases – the only cases to which article 2212\n\napplied. Even assuming for the sake of argument that the one satisfaction rule\n\napplies in a contract case, which RLJ disputes, the one satisfaction rule does not\n\napply unless the liability of the liable defendant and the settling defendant is joint\n\nand several.

Casteel, 22 S.W.3d at 391; Garrett, 860 S.W.2d at 78. In other words, if the\n\nplaintiff could not impose joint and several liability, it would have no right to sue\n\nfor damages other than those caused by a particular defendant. Accordingly, a non-\n\nsettling defendant would have no right to seek an offset or credit from a settling\n\ndefendant since the plaintiff had no right to do so against the settling defendant or\n\nthe non-settling defendant.\n\n         Just last summer, the Fifth Circuit was persuaded by Garrett, Sterling, and\n\nthis Court’s reasoning in CTTI that joint and several liability was essential to the\n\napplication of the one satisfaction rule. GE Capital, 754 F.3d at 306. The suit arose\n\nwhen a predecessor’s employee fraudulently induced wire transfers to a bank that\n\n\n                                          24\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\faccepted them in bad faith in violation of a Texas statute. GE Capital sued the\n\npredecessor for contractual remedies under the purchase and sale agreement and\n\nsued the bank for statutory tort. Id. at 300. GE Capital settled its contractual claims\n\nwith the predecessor, but successfully tried the statutory tort claim against the\n\nbank. Id. at 301. The bank asserted the one satisfaction rule applied and GE Capital\n\nshould recover nothing because its contract damages were for the same loss settled\n\nby the bank. Id. at 303.\n\n         The Fifth Circuit held there was no legal duty shared by the settling and\n\nliable defendants and, therefore, the one satisfaction rule did not apply. Id. at 306-\n\n07, 309. A common factual origin for the damages claimed against the settling and\n\nliable defendants was not enough.\n\n         [The settling defendant’s] alleged contractual breach and the TUFTA\n         action against [the liable defendant] may share common underlying\n         facts – the three fraudulent transfers …. But such factual commonality\n         does not suffice … to render [the settling defendant] a joint tortfeasor\n         for one-satisfaction rule purposes.\n\nId. at 309 (emphasis added). The Fifth Circuit agreed with CTTI’s analysis that the\none satisfaction rule did not apply in any case where the duty allegedly breached\nby the liable and settling defendants was not the same.

Unlike Tort Cases, Joint Liability in Contract Cases\n                           Requires More Than Common, Indivisible Damages.\n         Tort duties are universal; contractual duties are not.

In Osborne, it was the liable\n\ndefendant, not the settling defendant, who allegedly had a contractual liability in\n\naddition to joint tort and DTPA liability with the settling defendants. See also GE\n\nCapital, 754 F.3d at 307 n.9. The Osborne jury found no liability for breach of\n\ncontract, only for negligence and breaches of implied warranties actionable under\n\nthe DTPA. 252 S.W.3d at 74. Because the case involved alleged DTPA claims,\n\nunlike the verdict in Galle, the jury determined the percentage responsibility of the\n\nliable and settling defendants. Id.; see TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE §§33.002\n\n(proportionate responsibility applicable to “any action brought under the DTPA”);\n\n33.012 (under 2005 version, defendant had option of percentage reduction or dollar\n\ncredit for settlement). The jury also decided the total amount of the plaintiff’s\n\ndamages attributable to both the liable and settling defendant in an amount less\n\nthan the amount paid by the settling defendants. The liable defendant elected the\n\ndollar-for-dollar credit which more than offset the total amount of damages\n\nawarded by the jury. The plaintiff apparently elected to recover under the DTPA\n\nbecause the issue before the court was whether attorney’s fees could be recovered\n\n\n                                         29\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\fwhen the total amount of settlement exceeded the amount of the total damages\n\nawarded by the jury for the injuries caused by both the liable and settling\n\ndefendants. Id. at 75-76.\n\n         Thus, Osborne is a straightforward application of Civil Practice and\n\nRemedies Code chapter 33 to a case to which it explicitly applies: a DTPA/tort\n\nclaim for which the liable and settling defendants were jointly liable involving an\n\ninjury this Court deemed indivisible. The joint and several liability in that case\n\nwas created by statute, not common law. TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE §33.013,\n\nand the amount of damages awarded in that case were for the amount of damages\n\ncaused by all responsible persons. TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE §33.012.\n\n         The distinctions between Osborne and this case are manifold. Here, there\n\nwas no joint and several tort liability. Indeed, there was no joint and several\n\nliability of any description. See V.A.3.e., infra.

The liable defendant is a stranger to the contract between the plaintiff\n\nand the settling defendant. If credit under the one satisfaction rule were permitted\n\nabsent a shared performance obligation, the liable defendant could achieve\n\nindirectly what could not have been achieved directly; a stranger without privity\n\ncould in effect wrest a credit based on settlement of that contractual obligation.\n\nRegardless of whether the injury was “indivisible,” the one satisfaction rule could\n\nnot apply without a common promise to perform the same contractual duty. Id. at\n\n684.\n\n                  c.       This Court Has Rejected Application of the\n                           One Satisfaction Rule to Contractual Liability\n                           Without a Joint Contractual Obligation.\n         The trial court in this case applied the one satisfaction rule solely on the\n\nbasis of perceived “indivisible” damages. (CR1438-39). In CTTI, this Court:\n\n         acknowledge[d] that there are cases in which the courts have applied\n         the one satisfaction rule and granted settlement credits or required an\n         election of remedies where there are co-existing tort and contract\n         claims. . . .In those cases, the courts have focused on the indivisible\n         nature of the injury to the plaintiffs, and have not discussed the\n         requirement of joint liability. We find that focus to be misplaced and\n\n                                               32\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\f         decline to follow those decisions.… If we were to hold that, due to the\n         indivisible nature of the resulting injury, breach of contract defendants\n         and tort defendants are jointly and severally liable for all damages, we\n         would be forced to hold a person not a party to a contract liable for\n         the breach of that contract.\n\n(164 S.W.3d at 684-85; emphasis added). The same rationale applies when the\n\nliable and settling defendants’ liability rests on distinct contractual obligations\n\nunder different contracts. Therefore, the trial court erred in applying the one\n\nsatisfaction credit based solely on perceived “indivisible” damages.\n\n                  d.       Applying the One Satisfaction Rule Without\n                           Joint Contractual Liability Obliterates the\n                           Collateral Source Exception.\n         The collateral source rule is an exception to the one satisfaction rule.

If indivisible\n\ninjury alone were enough for applying the one satisfaction rule, this exception\n\nwould be meaningless.

Thus, the\n\nexistence of the collateral source exception belies the notion that indivisible injury\n\nalone is sufficient for application of the one satisfaction rule. For this additional\n\nreason, a joint and several liability is essential for application of the one\n\nsatisfaction rule to contractual liabilities.\n\n                  e.       This Case Involved No Joint Contractual Liability\n                           of the Architect and the Settling Defendants.\n         Because joint and several contractual liability is essential, the question here\n\nnarrows to whether the Architect’s contractual liability was joint with that of the\n\nSettling Defendants; i.e., was the liability imposed on the Architect for the same\n\ncontractual promise or promises also made by each Settling Defendant. As\n\nacknowledged in CTTI, the contractual obligations of an architect are distinct from\n\nthose of a general contractor. 164 S.W.3d at 685. Only the Architect’s contractual\n\nliability was submitted to the jury. (CR1125-26, 1708-10).

It was alleged the General Contractor did not comply\n\nwith the Project’s plans and specifications and contract documents, the promise to\n\nbuild free from defects, and the duty perform in a good and workmanlike manner.\n\n(2SCR43-44, 47; App. A).\n\n         RLJ alleged that the Soils Engineer 7 was retained by the owner to “conduct a\n\ngeotechnical engineering study,” provide “geotechnical engineering services,” and\n\n“materials testing and construction inspection services.” (2SCR45; App. A). RLJ\n\nalleged that the Soils Engineer breached these undertakings by failing to properly\n\nestimate the potential of the soil at the site for swelling and underestimating the\n\n\n7\n  Terracon, a settling defendant, was the successor-in-interest to HBC, a party to the\nGeotechnical Study Contract.

Under Hunt and\n\nWhite Budd, the architect’s liability arose from the architect’s unique contractual\n\nobligations, not a promise to perform the same duty as the general contractor. Just\n\nas there can be no comparative submission of a general contractor’s fault, the one\n\nsatisfaction rule cannot be invoked to reduce the Architect’s liability with the\n\nGeneral Contractor’s settlement.\n\n         The same is true for the Architect’s particular failings concerning the\n\nfoundation design detailed in the certificate of merit.

The Architect urged the jury\n\nthat it should not be found liable because the breaches of duties undertaken by\n\nothers, not the Architect, caused the damage. The Architect argued it was not\n\nserving as an engineer or a general contractor. (10RR33-34). It essentially denied\n\nany common duty, arguing it could not second-guess the Soils Engineer’s\n\npredictions about the potential vertical rise or provisions groundwater drainage at\n\nthe Project.

The case was one for medical\n\nmalpractice case during treatment of auto accident injuries. The doctor did not\n\nobject to the form of the question but nonetheless asserted the charge did not\n\nsegregate damages caused in the auto collision from those caused by the alleged\n\nmalpractice. Id. at 274. Finding nothing to rebut the presumption of compliance,\n\nthe court held the jury’s damages finding was “limited in accordance with the trial\n\ncourt’s express instruction” and determined damages “for injuries attributable to\n\nDr. Tesfa’s negligence alone.” Id. at 279.\n\n                           2)   The Plain Language of the Question Limited Damages\n                                to Those Resulting from the Architect’s “[F]ailure to\n                                [C]omply [W]ith the Architectural Contract.”\n         Concerning the effect of the damages finding, this case is indistinguishable\n\nfrom Tesfa. The damages question here clearly limited its inquiry to the Architect’s\n\n“failure to comply with the Architectural Contract ….” (CR1127; App. B).\n\n\n                                             42\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\fSimilarly, in Hunt, 739 S.W.2d at 940, an owner sued an architect for design\n\ndeficiencies and various contractors for construction defects in a parking deck. All\n\nbut the Architect settled before trial. Id. at 935. The Architect claimed credit under\n\nthe one satisfaction rule. The damages question was:\n\n         What sum of money, if any, if paid now in cash will fully compensate\n         [the owner] for any permanent diminution in market value of [the\n         shopping center and office complex] which was caused by the acts or\n         omissions of the defendant(s), despite the completion of all reasonable\n         repair procedures?\n\n(Id.; emphasis in original). The Architect urged that the question permitted a\n\ndouble recovery because it included damages for the settled claims. Id. at 940. The\n\ncourt denied the credit because\n\n         the jury compensated [the owner] only for the separate wrong … by\n         [the Architect’s] breach of []its duties …. [T]he consideration received\n         under the prior settlement compensated [the owner] for acts and\n         omissions of others…. [The Architect] was not a party to the\n         settlement agreement. Therefore, the present case presents the\n         situation where each wrongdoer pays separately for its own acts or\n         omissions.\n\n(Id.; emphasis added).\n\n         Similarly, in Robertson v. ADJ Partnership, Ltd., 204 S.W.3d at 485, the\n\ncourt held that where the jury charge limits its inquiry to damages caused by the\n\nnon-settling defendant, there is no basis for application of the one satisfaction rule.\n\nThe same conclusion was reached in Byer Custom Builders v. Franks, 389 S.W.3d\n\nat 881. In that case, the finder of fact, an arbitrator, “did not award any damages\n\n\n                                           43\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\fagainst the [non-settling defendant] for any of the alleged damage the [plaintiffs]\n\nclaimed was caused by [the alleged settling defendant], there could be no violation\n\nof the one-satisfaction rule if the [plaintiffs] received compensation on those\n\nclaims from [the settling defendant].”\n\n         Like the damages questions in Tesfa, Hunt and Robertson, the plain\n\nlanguage of the damage question here removed any possibility the damages\n\nincluded those for breaches of a different contract or party. For this reason alone,\n\nthere could have been no finding of damages common to those caused by the\n\nSettling Defendants.\n\n         Contrast these decisions with Allan v.

The Jury Was Asked To Apportion and\n                           in Fact Apportioned Damages.\n         The Architect, not RLJ, is getting the double dip here. The Architect invited\n\nthe jury in closing argument for, and in fact received, a damages reduction in the\n\njury verdict before obtaining another by raising the one satisfaction rule for the\n\nfirst time post-verdict. 9 Counsel for both parties urged the jury in closing\n\narguments to adjust its damages award. RLJ suggested without objection that the\n\njury could and should make a 20% reduction for the damages attributable to the\n\nSettling Defendants. (10RR29). In light of the evidence, the jury clearly limited the\n\ndamages to those caused by the Architect. The Architect went further, suggesting\n\nthe jury “in Question 3 … answer zero” if it believed “there’s no causal\n\nconnection” between the Architect’s breaches and RLJ’s damages. (10RR54). The\n\nArchitect devoted much of its argument faulting Terracon for the too-light\n\n\n9\n  RLJ’s evidence supported damages in excess of $7 million. (7RR48; 9RR123-124, 136;\n7RR16-18, 26-39; 3RR133-136; PX-151, 16RR1-1145; 10RR29-31). Had the architect pleaded\nthe one satisfaction rule or asserted it before submission to the jury, RLJ could have elected to\nsubmit damages based on the total amount of all damages and risk the application of one\nsatisfaction rule. It did not have this option, however, because the architect first asserted that it\nwas entitled to settlement credit under the one satisfaction rule long after the jury returned its\nverdict.\n\n                                                 45\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\ffoundation design and urging the reasonableness of its blind reliance on Terracon’s\n\nwork.

Applying a further reduction does not assure one\n\nsatisfaction; instead, it assures less than one satisfaction.\n\n         For all these reasons, the damages question required apportionment and the\n\njury’s verdict reflects the apportionment the charge required.\n\n         The jury was also asked to apportion damages by both parties.

The one satisfaction rule is not an insuperable barrier to\n\nplaintiff benefitting from a favorable settlement.\n\n         [T]he one recovery rule does not prevent … adopting a system that\n         reduces the plaintiff’s recovery and the non-settling defendants’\n         liability by the percentage of causation assigned to any tortfeasor with\n         whom plaintiff has settled.

Allowing\n         plaintiffs to keep the excess from a good settlements may violate the\n         one recovery rule, but no one is harmed [if the jury allocates the\n         damages].\n\nId. at 432 (emphasis added). The same is no less true here. The charge permitted\n\nand the parties invited and the jury’s answer provided the necessary damage\n\nallocation. Therefore, “the reasoning of the one recovery rule no longer applies”\n\nand its application here cannot be justified. See Duncan, 665 S.W.2d at 431.\n\n\n\n                                            47\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\f         5.

Moreover, the history and subsequent adoption of TEX. CIV. PRAC.\n\n& REM.

By the Architect’s failure to raise the one satisfaction rule prior to verdict,\n\nRLJ had no reason whatsoever to anticipate any need to adduce any evidence\n\nsegregating damages. Similarly, the Architect waived any argument on the one\n\nsatisfaction rule by specifically asking the jury to apportion damages and award\n\nonly those damages caused by the Architect. (10RR54-56).\n\n\n\n\n                                               58\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\f         For any one or all of the foregoing reasons, the one satisfaction rule did not\n\nand could not apply to reduce the Architect’s liability to RLJ. The trial court erred\n\nin concluding otherwise. Accordingly, the judgment must be reformed to restore\n\nrecovery for the damages awarded by the jury together with interest.\n\nB.       No Segregation of Attorney’s Fees Was Required.\n         RLJ sought its reasonable and necessary attorney’s fees under chapter 38 of\n\nthe Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code. (CR201; App. A). The parties agreed\n\nto submit the attorney’s fees claim to the court rather than the jury. After the jury’s\n\nverdict, RLJ moved for its attorney’s fees and submitted its proof by affidavit and\n\nsupporting documents showing RLJ expended a total of $1,388,019 in reasonable\n\nand necessary attorney’s fees to prosecute the breach of contract claims against the\n\nArchitect, Soils Engineer, and the General Contractor. (3SCR3-611; 2SCR1603-\n\n05).\n\n         However, the trial court determined for purposes of attorney’s fees it was\n\nnecessary to segregate those expended on RLJ’s claim against the Architect from\n\nthose on its claims against the Settling Defendants. (CR1711; App. D). The trial\n\ncourt awarded attorney’s fees attributable to the prosecution of the breach of\n\ncontract claim against the Architect only, even though it considered the damages\n\n“indivisible.” (CR1711; 2SCR1600; App. C, D). Accordingly, of the $1,388,019 in\n\nattorney’s fees for presenting all its contract claims, the trial court allowed RLJ\n\n\n                                           59\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\fonly $901,650.96 as fees attributable to the contract claim against the Architect\n\nonly. (CR1711; App. D). RLJ timely moved conditionally to modify the judgment\n\nso that, if the one satisfaction rule applied, it could recover its unsegregated\n\nattorney’s fees for breach of contract claims against the Architect and the Settling\n\nDefendants. (CR1747-48). The trial court denied this motion. (CR1905).\n\n         RLJ continues to maintain that the one satisfaction rule does not apply. If\n\nand only if this Court decides otherwise, RLJ was not obliged to segregate its\n\nattorney’s fees for the breach of contract claims against the Architect from those\n\nfor the breach of contract claims against the Settling Defendants.\n\n         1.       There Is No Need to Segregate Fees For\n                  Claims Requiring Proof of the Same Facts.\n         Generally, reasonable and necessary attorney’s fees requires proof of the\n\nfees incurred for suit on a claim for which such fees are recoverable. Sterling, 822\n\nS.W.2d at 10. If the causes of action depend upon the same facts or circumstances,\n\nthey may be “intertwined to the point of being inseparable.” Id. Attorney’s fees\n\nshould be allowed for inseparable claims even if some issues also relate to matters\n\nfor which attorney’s fees are not recoverable, Aiello, 941 S.W.2d at 73; Sterling,\n\n822 S.W.2d at 11, provided the underlying services advance both.

If the One Satisfaction Rule Applies, It Requires\n                  Proof of Breach of the Same Promised Performance\n                  and an Indivisible Injury.\n         The one satisfaction rule may apply in contract case only if there was a joint\n\nand several contractual liability, which in turn requires a promise of the same\n\nperformance by the settling and liable defendants, see V.A.3., supra., and an\n\nindivisible injury. See V.A.4., supra. If the Architect and Settling Defendants\n\nbreached a promise for the same performance causing an indivisible injury, then\n\nthe activities of RLJ’s attorneys to prove the Settling Defendants’ liability would\n\nhave necessarily also served as proof of the Architect’s liability. If the one\n\nsatisfaction rule applies at all, no segregation could have been required.\n\n         3.       Alternatively, If Proof of Indivisible Injury Alone is\n                  Enough for the Application of the One Satisfaction\n                  Rule, Segregation of Fees Was Still Not Required.\n         Regardless of whether the one satisfaction rule otherwise applies, if the trial\n\ncourt correctly determined that there was an indivisible injury or damages in this\n\ncase for purposes of the one-satisfaction analysis, then segregation of fees was not\n\n\n                                             61\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\frequired. The Architect, General Contractor and Soils Engineer undertook different\n\nduties. (CR192-93, 197-98, 200-01, 205-18). For these breaches to coalesce in an\n\n“indivisible” injury would necessarily require RLJ to have proved each breach to\n\nestablish the full scope of its damages.\n\n         “Where the tortious acts of two or more wrongdoers join to produce an\n\nindivisible injury, … all of the wrongdoers will be held jointly and severally liable\n\nfor the entire damages ….”. Landers, 248 S.W.2d at 734 (1952). If the one\n\nsatisfaction rule applies at all and if only an indivisible injury is required, as the\n\ntrial court reasoned, the breaches of the Settling Defendants were sufficiently\n\nconjoined with those of the Architect, then proof of the harm resulting from the\n\nbreaches of the Settling Defendants were also essential and no segregation was\n\nrequired.\n\n                           VI.   CONCLUSION AND PRAYER\n         For the foregoing reasons, RLJ asks the Court to:\n\n         1) reverse the trial court’s judgment applying the one satisfaction rule and\n\ndelete the credit for the amount of the Settling Defendants’ settlements;\n\n         2) if and only if the one satisfaction rule applies, reverse the trial court’s\n\njudgment concerning the award of attorney’s fees and either reform it to award\n\nRLJ unsegregated fees or remand the case to the trial court solely for a\n\n\n\n\n                                           62\nMHDocs 6062453_7 12690.2\n\fdetermination of reasonable and necessary attorney’s fees for the prosecution of all\n\ncontract claims against the Architect, and the Settling Defendants; and\n\n         3) any one or more of 1) – 2) above subject to the conditions prescribed. RLJ\n\nfurther requests such other relief to which they are justly entitled, provided such\n\nrelief requested does not include a retrial on the merits of its claims against the\n\nArchitect.\n\n                                                Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                                MUNSCH HARDT KOPF & HARR PC\n\n\n                                                /s/ Michael W.

A tort/negligence claim against EBCO for breach of a fiduciary duty\n                           arising from EBCO's failure to construct the Project in a manner\n                           consistent with the owner's interests and with the contract documents,\n                           which are the source of the fiduciary duty.\n\n         16.      Except for MBA, DaVinci, Bridgeview, and Champion, Defendants all entered\n\ninto valid and enforceable contracts with the Project's developer, White Lodging Services Corp.\n\n(\"White\"), to perform the services listed below.\n\n         17.      White, as developer, delivered and assigned the Project, the contracts, fiduciary\n\nduties, intangibles and all of the warranties, representations, and causes of action related thereto,\n\nto a White affiliate, South Ausaircourt, L.P., as owner (\"Ausaircourt\").           Ausaircourt then\n\nassigned the Project, the contracts, fiduciary duties, intangibles, and all of the warranties,\n\nrepresentations, and causes of action related thereto, to RLJ Lodging, which purchased the\n\nProject, and then assigned its rights and obligations under the Project contracts to RLJ Austin.\n\n         18.      EBCO was the general contractor and/or construction manager on the Project.\n\nEBCO performed work on the Project, and also retained subcontractors who performed work on\n\nthe Project.     EBCO and its subcontractors failed to construct the Project free from defects,\n\nincluding, but not limited to, the following:\n\n         (a) Failed to construct the Project foundation free from defect or in compliance\n         with the Project plans and specifications, including missing beams and improper\n         placement of wire reinforcing mesh. Plaintiffs allege that the damage from this\n         negligent work began to occur during construction and continues to this day.\n         Plaintiffs also allege that not only was the foundation itself damaged, but this\n         negligent work caused significant damage to other component parts of the\n         Project;\n\n         (b) Failed to provide \"select fill\" soils which complied with the Project\n         specifications. Plaintiffs allege that the damage from this negligent work began\n         to occur during construction and continues to this day. Plaintiffs also allege that\n         this negligent work caused significant damage to other component parts of the\n         Project;\n\n         (c) Failed to construct the pool and its drains free from defect. Plaintiffs allege\n         that the damage from this negligent work began to occur during construction and\n\nPlaintiffs' Seventh Amended Original Petition                                                  Page 5\nMHDocs 4896391 1 12690.2\n\n                                                                                                        188\n\f         continues to this day. Plaintiffs also allege that not only was the pool itself\n         damaged but this negligent work caused significant damage to other component\n         parts of the Project;\n\n         (d) Failed to construct the under-slab plumbing free from defect. Plaintiffs\n         allege that the damages from this negligent work began to occur during\n         construction and continues to this day. Plaintiffs also allege that this negligent\n         work caused damage to other component parts of the Project; and\n\n         (e) Failed to construct the Project site work in a manner consistent with the\n         Project plans and specifications. Plaintiffs allege that the damages from this\n         negligent work began to occur during construction and continues to this day.\n         Plaintiffs also allege that not only was the site work itself damaged but this\n         negligent work caused significant damage to other component parts of the\n         Project.\n\n         19.      The terms of the contract between EBCO and White (the \"General Contract\")\n\ncreated a \"fiduciary relationship of trust and confidence.\" Pursuant to the General Contract,\n\nEBCO agreed to construct the Project free from defects in a \"manner consistent with the interests\n\nof the Owner.\"        EBCO failed to construct the Project free from defects and in a manner\n\nconsistent with the interests of the owner, thereby breaching its fiduciary duty, which is a tort in\n\nTexas.

Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1777394\"><a href=\"/opinion/1777394/douglas-v-aztec-petroleum-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">695</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">312</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 318 (Tex. App.-Tyler 1985, no writ).\n\n         20.      ESG contracted for architectural services with White (the \"Architectural\n\nContract\"), and Swenson signed and sealed the architectural plans and drawings for the Project.\n\nUnder the Architectural Contract, ESG agreed to, among other things, provide overall\n\narchitectural, civil, and structural engineering design, document preparation, and coordination for\n\nthe Project. This work was to be performed expeditiously and consistent with professional skill\n\nand care. Because Texas does not allow corporations to sign or seal architectural plans or\n\nspecifications, Swenson could not have been acting as an agent of ESG when he signed and\n\nsealed the architectural plans and drawings, as an agent can only act to the extent of the\n\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs' Seventh Amended Original Petition                                                 Page 6\nMHDocs 4896391 1 12690.2\n\n                                                                                                       189\n\fprincipal's legal authority. Therefore, ESG constructively assigned portions of the Architectural\n\nContract to Swenson, without first obtaining written consent from White.\n\n          21.     ESG consented to the assignment of the Architectural Contract between White\n\nand Ausaircourt, in writing.        This assignment provided Ausaircourt with all of the interests\n\nreferenced above, but none of the obligations.\n\n          22.     Pursuant to a written contract dated October 30, 2000 (the \"Geotechnical Study\n\nContract\"), HBC was retained to conduct a geotechnical engineering study (the \"Geotechnical\n\nEngineering Study\").        Swoboda signed, sealed, and submitted the Geotechnical Engineering\n\nStudy to White on November 21, 2000. Because Texas does not allow corporations to sign or\n\nseal architectural plans or specifications, Swoboda could not have been acting as an agent of\n\nHBC when he signed and sealed the Geotechnical Engineering Study, as an agent can only act to\n\nthe extent of the principal's legal authority. Therefore, HBC constructively assigned portions of\n\nthe Geotechnical Engineering Study contract to Swoboda, without first obtaining written consent\n\nfrom White.\n\n          23.     The Geotechnical Study Contract was completed sometime in late 2000 or early\n\n2001, when White made final payment to HBC for these services.\n\n          24.     Pursuant to an oral agreement or undertaking, which was separate and distinct\n\nfrom the Geotechnical Study Contract, Terracon provided geotechnical engineering services to\n\nWhite and its affiliates during construction of the Project in 2005 and after the Project's\n\ncompletion. No written contract for such services between Terracon and any White affiliate\n\nexists.\n\n          25.     Terracon entered into a written contract to provide materials testing and\n\nconstruction inspection services for the Project in 2005 (the \"Materials Testing Contract\").\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs' Seventh Amended Original Petition                                                  Page 7\nMHDocs 4896391 1 12690.2\n\n                                                                                                        190\n\f         26.      MBA performed the structural engineering for the Project and Andrew Marlin\n\nsigned and sealed the structural plans MBA provided to ESG.\n\n         27.      DaVinci constructed the Project pool pursuant to a subcontract between it and\n\nEBCO.\n\n         28.      Bridgeview constructed the Project plumbing system pursuant to a subcontract\n\nbetween it and EBCO.\n\n         29.      Champion provided site preparation services, labor, and materials pursuant to a\n\nsubcontract between it and EBCO.\n\n         30.      On March 16, 2006, PlaintiffRLJ Lodging entered into the \"New Hotels Purchase\n\nand Sale Agreement\" (the \"New Hotels PSA\") between Whiteco Industries, Inc., numerous\n\nsellers identified on Exhibit A of the PSA, and White. This PSA was one of two PSA's executed\n\nconcerning the purchase of the Project and 99 other similar projects.       One PSA concerned\n\nprojects that were already constructed, and the New Hotels PSA concerned projects, like the\n\nProject, that were in various stages of construction.\n\n         31.      Pursuant to the New Hotels PSA, Plaintiff RLJ Lodging was legally obligated to\n\ntake possession of the Project on or about December 20, 2007, a few months after it was\n\ncompleted.\n\n         32.      Plaintiffs noticed property damage, including foundation movement, a cracked\n\nswimming pool, cracks in the slab and grade, shifting door frames, cracks in partition walls, and\n\ndrainage issues on the perimeter of the building in the Project.\n\n         33.      EBCO, ESG, Swenson, Terracon, Swoboda, MBA, DaVinci, Bridgeview, and\n\nChampion provided services, labor, or materials that were defective, or deviated from the\n\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs' Seventh Amended Original Petition                                              Page 8\nMHDocs 4896391 1 12690.2\n\n                                                                                                    191\n\fapplicable standards of care, and that either caused, or contributed to cause, damages to the\n\nProject and RLJ.\n\n         34.      These defective and damaging serv1ces, labor or materials all had certain\n\ncharacteristics which prevented Plaintiffs from immediately discovering the damage, and it was\n\nnot until verifiable issues with the Project were physically made manifest that Plaintiffs knew of\n\nor should have known of the damages to the Project. As such, the Discovery Rule applies to\n\neffect accrual of all of Plaintiffs' causes of action.\n\n                                        V. CAUSES OF ACTION\n\nA.       Breach of Contract\n\n         35.      Plaintiffs incorporate the foregoing paragraphs.\n\n         36.      EBCO breached the General Contract by failing to perform said contract in a\n\ngood and workmanlike manner, failing to construct the Project according to the contract\n\ndocuments, and failing to construct the Project in a manner consistent with the interests of the\n\nowner.\n\n         37.      ESG and Swenson breached the Architectural Contract by deviating from the\n\napplicable standard of care, failing to produce design plans free from defects, and failing to\n\nproperly administer the construction of the Project. See Exhibit A, Certificate of Merit of John\n\nNyfeler, FAIA, describing ESG and Swenson's negligent acts, or acts in breach of the\n\nArchitectural Contract, pursuant to the Certificate of Merit requirements of applicable state law.\n\n         38.      HBC and Swoboda breached the Geotechnical Study Contract as set forth in\n\nKirby Meyer's Certificate of Merit, attached as Exhibit B, pursuant to the Certificate of Merit\n\nrequirements of applicable state law.           Terracon is responsible for HBC's and Swoboda's\n\nnegligent acts, errors, or omissions as a result of its merger with HBC.\n\n         39.      Terracon breached the Materials Testing Contract, as set forth in Exhibit B.\n\nPlaintiffs' Seventh Amended Original Petition                                                    Page 9\nMHDocs 4896391 1 12690.2\n\n                                                                                                          192\n\f         40.      Terracon breached its oral contract with White for geotechnical engmeenng\n\nservices, as set forth in Exhibit B.\n\n         41.      Defendants ESG, Swenson, and EBCO assert that anti-assignment clauses\n\ncontained in the Architectural Contract and the General Contract prohibit RLJ from asserting\n\nthese contract claims.\n\n         42.      The anti-assignment clause in the Architectural Contract and the General Contract\n\nhave no force or effect on the assignments between White and RLJ because these contracts were\n\nno longer executory at the time of assignment.\n\n         43.      To the extent that Terracon or Swoboda assert contractual anti-assignment\n\nclauses, those clauses have no force or effect on the assignments between White and RLJ\n\nbecause these contracts were no longer executory at the time of assignment.\n\n         44.      In the alternative, the anti-assignment clauses do not render the Contract\n\nassignments void. Instead, they merely potentially entitle ESG, EBCO, or Terracon to a breach\n\nof contract claim.         However, because ESG, HBC, and Terracon materially breached their\n\ncontracts prior to the date of the assignments, as more fully described below, White and RLJ are\n\nexcused from performance.\n\n         45.      Specifically, ESG committed the first material breach of the Architectural\n\nContract with White when it assigned the signing and sealing function of its contract to Swenson,\n\nwithout White's express written consent, while those obligations were still executory. Because\n\ncorporations are not authorized to sign or seal construction documents in Texas, Swenson could\n\nnot have been acting as ESG's agent.            As a result of these actions, ESG is estopped from\n\nenforcement of the referenced anti-assignment clause, and White and RLJ are thereby excused\n\nfrom performance of its contract obligations concerning consent of assignment.              In the\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs' Seventh Amended Original Petition                                               Page 10\nMHDocs 4896391 1 12690.2\n\n                                                                                                      193\n\falternative, ESG relinquished a known right and therefore waived enforcement of the anti-\n\nassignment clause, by virtue of the referenced constructive assignment.\n\n         46.       Specifically, HBC committed the first material breach of the Geotechnical Study\n\nContract with White when it assigned the signing and sealing function of its contract to\n\nSwoboda, without White's express written consent, while those obligations were still executory.\n\nBecause corporations are not authorized to sign or seal construction documents in Texas,\n\nSwoboda could not have been acting as HBC's agent. As a result of these actions, Terracon (on\n\nbehalf of HBC) is estopped from enforcement of the referenced anti-assignment clause, and\n\nWhite and RLJ are thereby excused from performance of its contract obligations concerning\n\nconsent of assignment. In the alternative, HBC relinquished a known right and therefore waived\n\nenforcement of the anti-assignment clause, by virtue of the referenced constructive assignment.\n\n         47.      Specifically, Terracon committed the first material breach of the Materials\n\nTesting Contract with White when it assigned the signing and sealing function of its contract to\n\nothers, without White's express written consent, while those obligations were still executory.\n\nBecause corporations are not authorized to sign or seal construction documents in Texas, the\n\nindividuals who signed and sealed testing reports could not have been acting as Terracon's agent.\n\nAs a result of these actions, Terracon is estopped from enforcement of the referenced anti-\n\nassignment clause, and White and RLJ are thereby excused from performance of its contract\n\nobligations concerning consent of assignment. In the alternative, Terracon relinquished a known\n\nright and therefore waived enforcement of the anti-assignment clause, by virtue of the referenced\n\nconstructive assignment.\n\n         48.      Plaintiffs also challenge the applicability of the purported \"waiver of\n\nconsequential damages\" clauses contained in the Architectural Contract, General Contract, the\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs' Seventh Amended Original Petition                                              Page 11\nMHDocs 4896391 1 12690.2\n\n                                                                                                     194\n\fGeotechnical Study Contract, and/or the Materials Testing Contract. Plaintiffs seek to recover\n\nthe difference between the value of the Project as constructed, and its value had it been designed\n\nand constructed in accordance with the respective Contracts. This is not a consequential damage\n\nas defined by the Contracts, but instead is the primary measure of damages in a breach of\n\ncontract action under Texas law.\n\n         49.      As a direct, natural, probable, and foreseeable consequence associated with\n\nbreaches of contract by EBCO, ESG, Swenson, HBC, Swoboda, and Terracon, Plaintiffs have\n\nsustained damages for which they sue herein.\n\nB.      Declaratory Judgment and Suit for Declaratory Relief\n\n         50.      Plaintiffs incorporate the foregoing paragraphs.\n\n         51.      Pursuant to the Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act, Texas Civil Practice &\n\nRemedies Code §37.001 et seq., Plaintiffs are interested parties whose rights are affected by a\n\ncontract or contracts with Terracon or HBC.\n\n         52.      Issues and disagreements currently exist between Plaintiffs and Terracon\n\nconcemmg whether Terracon's geotechnical engmeenng serv1ces provided in 2005 and\n\nthereafter are the subject of any contractual limitations of liability.       Terracon asserts that\n\nlimitations of liability contained in either the Geotechnical Study or Materials Testing Contract\n\napply to the geotechnical engineering services provided by Terracon in 2005 and thereafter.\n\n         53.      By way of a declaratory action, Plaintiffs seek certainty regarding the respective\n\nparties' rights and obligations under the Geotechnical Study Contract with HBC and the\n\nMaterials Testing Contract with Terracon at issue in this lawsuit. Specifically, RLJ seeks a\n\ndeclaration that: (a) the scope of the Geotechnical Engineering Study contract with HBC was to\n\nprovide a Geotechnical Engineering Study, which was provided on November 21, 2000 and\n\nwhich was completed shortly thereafter; (b) the Materials Testing Contract specifically excludes\n\nPlaintiffs' Seventh Amended Original Petition                                                Page 12\nMHDocs 4896391 1 12690.2\n\n                                                                                                       195\n\fgeotechnical engineering services; and (c) the geotechnical engineering services provided by\n\nTerracon in 2005 and thereafter were provided pursuant to an oral contract separate and distinct\n\nfrom the Geotechnical Study or Materials Testing Contract, or in the alternative pursuant to a\n\nnegligent undertaking by Terracon, but in either event the 2005 and beyond geotechnical\n\nengineering services provided by Terracon are not the subject of contractual limitations of\n\nliability contained in either the Geotechnical Study or Materials Testing Contract.\n\n         54.      Based on the foregoing, there is presently an actual, justiciable controversy\n\nbetween and among the parties.\n\nC       Breach of Warranty\n\n         55.      Plaintiffs incorporate the foregoing paragraphs.\n\n         56.      Plaintiffs assert that EBCO expressly represented and warranted that the Project,\n\nand all of its incorporated elements and materials, would be of good quality, that the Project\n\nwould be free from defects, and that the Project would conform to the requirements of the\n\ncontract documents. Specifically, Plaintiffs would show that EBCO breached its warranty that\n\nservices be performed in a good and workmanlike manner, because the Project is not fit for its\n\nintended use, was not constructed in accordance with the contract documents or industry\n\nstandards, and is not free from defects.\n\n         57.      In the alternative, Plaintiffs assert that EBCO impliedly represented and\n\nwarranted that the Project, and all of its incorporated elements and materials, would be of good\n\nquality, that the Project would be free from defects, and that the Project would conform to the\n\nrequirements of the contract documents.           Specifically, Plaintiffs would show that EBCO\n\nbreached its common law implied warranty that serv1ces be performed in a good and\n\nworkmanlike manner, because the Project is not fit for its intended use, was not constructed in\n\naccordance with the contract documents or industry standards, and is not free from defects.\n\nPlaintiffs' Seventh Amended Original Petition                                               Page 13\nMHDocs 4896391 1 12690.2\n\n                                                                                                      196\n\f         58.      As a direct, natural, probable, and foreseeable consequence associated with\n\nEBCO's breach of warranty, Plaintiffs have sustained damages for which they sue herein.\n\nD.      Equitable Subrogation\n\n         59.      Plaintiffs incorporate the foregoing paragraphs.\n\n         60.      Plaintiffs will show that EBCO had a duty to construct the Project without\n\nnegligence, free from defects, in a manner consistent with construction industry standards for\n\nsimilar projects in this location, and to refrain from negligent misrepresentation concerning the\n\nProject. EBCO failed to meet its duties when performing its work on the Project, all of which\n\ncaused or contributed to cause damages to Plaintiffs.\n\n         61.      Plaintiffs will also show that ESG had a duty to provide design plans and to\n\nadminister the Project's construction in accordance with the Architectural Contract, without\n\nnegligence, free from errors and omissions, and in a manner consistent with the applicable\n\nstandard of professional skill and care.        ESG also had a duty to refrain from negligent\n\nmisrepresentation concerning the Project.

EBCO, ESG, Swenson, MBA, Terracon (and HBC), Swoboda, DaVinci,\n\nBridgeview, and Champion all deviated from the applicable standards of care in the provisions of\n\ntheir respective work or services. In addition, EBCO failed to perform its contract in a good and\n\nworkmanlike manner and to construct the project in accordance with its fiduciary duty or the\n\nGeneral Contract. As a direct result, Plaintiffs suffered damages from the costs to correct or\n\ncompensate for the Defendants' acts, errors, and omissions. Plaintiffs were contractually and\n\notherwise obligated to undertake costly repair to the Project, and to pay those costs, for which the\n\nDefendants are responsible. Each of the Defendants benefited from these payments, for which\n\nthey are actually responsible, and any related claims they might have had regarding the Project\n\nare assigned to Plaintiffs as a matter of law.         Thus, Plaintiffs are entitled to an equitable\n\nsubrogation recovery of those Project remediation costs actually paid as of the date of the trial in\n\nthis matter from Defendants.\n\nE.      Negligence/Tort\n\n         71.      Plaintiffs incorporate the foregoing paragraphs.\n\n         72.      Breach of a Fiduciary Duty is a tort, grounded in negligence principles. EBCO\n\nowed a fiduciary duty to construct the Project in a manner consistent with the owner's interests.\n\nThe rights to the cause of action for EBCO' s breach of this negligence/tort duty were assigned to\n\nRLJ. EBCO breached this duty, causing damage to the Project and RLJ.\n\n                                                VI. DAMAGES\n\n         73.      As a result of the breaches of contract, breach of fiduciary duties, breach of\n\nwarranty, tort/negligence breaches, and negligent acts alleged above, Plaintiffs have sustained\n\ndamages in excess of the minimal jurisdictional requirements of this court. The appropriate\n\nmeasure of damages for the breach of contract and breach of warranty claims is the difference in\n\nvalue between the building as constructed, and the value of the building had it been designed and\n\nPlaintiffs' Seventh Amended Original Petition                                                Page 17\nMHDocs 4896391 1 12690.2\n\n                                                                                                       200\n\fconstructed pursuant to the respective contracts. In the alternative, the measure of damages is\n\nthe cost to fully and completely repair the Project.\n\n          74.     The measure of damages for the tort/negligence causes of action are all out-of-\n\npocket costs, plus all current and future lost revenue, profits, diminution in value, future repair\n\ncosts, along with all other direct, special or consequential damages. Plaintiffs also request that\n\nEBCO be required to disgorge and forfeit all fees from the Project, as a result of the breach of its\n\nfiduciary duty.\n\n          75.     Plaintiffs further seek a declaration that the geotechnical engineering services\n\nprovided by Terracon during and after construction of the Project, in 2005 and thereafter are not\n\nsubject to a contractual limitation ofliability, thereby not limiting the damages sought herein.\n\n                                  VII. CONDITIONS PRECEDENT\n\n          76.     All conditions precedent to the Plaintiffs' rights to recover as herein alleged have\n\nbeen performed, have occurred, or have been waived or excused.\n\n                                       VIII. ATTORNEY'S FEES\n\n          77.     Plaintiffs are entitled to recover their attorneys' fees pursuant to Chapters 37.009\n\nand 38 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code.\n\n          78.     Plaintiffs will further seek to recover their attorney's fees for declaratory relief\n\nsought against Terracon pursuant to Chapter 37 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code.\n\n                                  IX. REQUEST FOR JURY TRIAL\n\n          79.     Plaintiffs assert their right to a trial by jury, under Texas Constitution, article 1,\n\nsection 15, and make this demand for a jury trial at least thirty (30) days before the date this case\n\nis set for trial, in accordance with Texas Rules of Civil Procedure 216.

My name is John V. Nyfeler. I am of sound mind and capable of making this\n\n                      . affidavit. I am personally acquainted with the facts herein stated and they\n\n                      are true and correct.\n\n\n\n                 2.    This matter relates to the building project: RU/Marriott Courtyard Hotel,\n\n                      Austln Airport, located at 7809 .Ben White Boulevard, Austin, Texas 78744-\n\n                      1774.\n\n\n                 3.    I am President ofThe Nyfeler Organization, Inc. d/b/a/ John Nyfeler, FAIA\n\n                       and have worked in that capacity since February 1, 2010. For the previous\n\n                       ten years I worked for Aguirre Roden, Inc., a Texas based architect, engineer\n\n                       firm, in the capacity of Senior Vice President. I have been a registered\n\n                       architect in the State ofTexas since 1970.\n\n\n\n                 4.    I have reviewed the construction documents for the referenced building\n\n                       project, prepared by Etness Swenson Graham Architects, Inc. and its\n\n                       Principal, Mark G. Swenson; Texas Architect Registration No. 13193,\n\n                       (collectively \"Architect\") and its sub-consultants and have reviewed other\n\n                       related documents provided to me.

I\n\n       reserve the right to modify my opinions if additional information becomes\n\n       available.\n\n       5. HBC, the geotechnical engineer of record for the Courtyard Austin Airport,\n\n       identified highly expansive soils which will change volume with changing\n\n       moisture conditions at the site.   The highly expansive nature of the soil was\n\n       independently confirmed during MLAW's investigation.\n\n       6. In their geotechnical report, HBC recommended a stiffened slab-on-ground\n\n       foundation supported on a select fill pad.          The stiffened slab-on-ground\n\n       foundation was to be designed based on the Department of Housing and Urban\n\n       Development (HUD) Building Research Advisory Board's Report #33 (BRAB\n\n      #33) titled \"Criteria for Selection and Design of Residential Slabs-on-Ground\" and\n\n       dated 1968.    HBC's geotechnical report was signed and sealed by Todd E.\n\n       Swoboda, P.E. on November 21, 2000.\n\n      7. At the time of the HBC geotechnical report, the City of Austin had adopted the\n\n      1994 Uniform Building Code (UBC) for the design and construction of buildings\n\n       such as this hotel.

The BRAS #33 procedure recommended by HBC has not been\n\n       widely used in Central Texas for many years.             In .addition, the BRAB #33\n\n       procedure was developed for the design of small residential foundations, not\n\n       commercial buildings such as this hotel.\n\n       8. This site was excavated as much as 7 feet to provide a level construction pad.\n\n       Had HBC accounted for the up to 7 feet of site cut, the predicted Potential\n\n       Vertical Rise (PVR) for the site with no remove and replace modifications would\n\n       have been as much as 7.6 inches, not the 3 inches stated in their report.\n\n       9. HBC failed      to   take   into   account the site    cut in   the geotechnical\n\n       recommendations.        Cutting the site reduces the overburden and exposes the\n\n       deeper soils to higher levels of moisture change than would have been\n\n       experienced prior to the cutting. Cutting results in a significant increase in the\n\n       swell potential.   HBC failed to determine final site elevations or notice site\n\n       excavation while on site during construction.\n\n       10. HBC overestimation of the effect of 5 feet of remove and replace with select\n\n       fill. Based on MLAW's PVR analysis, 5 feet of remove and replace would have\n\n       only reduced the PVR to 2.7 inches, not less than 1 inch as reported in HBC's\n\n       report. Had the site cut of up to 7 feet been considered, the value would be 4.8\n\n       inches.\n\n       11. HBC failed to recommend adequate measures to drain or prevent water from\n\n       penetrating the underslab fill.         Since the underslab fill's permeability is\n\n       significantly higher than the surrounding clay, any water that infiltrates the\nCERTIFICATE OF MERIT OF KIRBY T.

Free water was observed draining from\n\n        the fill behind the exterior footing in one test pit and found in monitor wells. The .\n\n        trapping of water below the building significantly contributed to the foundation\n\n        distress suffered by the structure.\n\n        12.

You may discuss the case with other jurors only\n        when you are all together in the jury room.\n\n                Remember my previous instructions: Do not discuss the case with anyone else, either in\n        person or by any other means. Do not do any independent investigation about the case or conduct\n        any research. Do not look up any words in dictionaries or on the Internet. Do not post in1formation\n        about the case on the Internet. Do not share any special knowledge or experiences with the other\n        jurors.

Do not let bias, prejudice, or sympathy play any part in your decision.\n\n        2. Base your answers only on the evidence admitted in court and on the law that is in these\ninstructions and questions. Do not consider or discuss any evidence that was not admitted in the\ncourtroom.\n\n        3. You are to make up your own minds about the facts. You are the sole judges of the\ncredibility of the witnesses and the weight to give their testimony. But on matters of law, you\nmust follow all of my instructions.\n\n       4. If my instructions use a word in a way that is different from its ordinary meaning, use\nthe meaning I give you, which will be a proper legal definition.\n\n       5. All the questions and answers are important. No one should say that any question or\nanswer is not important.\n\n        6. Unless the instruction for a particular question tells you otherwise, a \"yes\" answer must\nbe based on a preponderance of the evidence.          If you do not find that a preponderance of the\nevidence supports a \"yes\" answer, then answer \"no.\" When you answer a question that requires\nan answer other than \"yes\" or \"no,\" your answer must be based on a preponderance ofthe evidence,\nunless the instruction for that particular question tells you otherwise.\n\n       The term \"preponderance of the evidence\" means the greater weight of credible evidence\npresented in this case. A preponderance of the evidence is not measured by the number of\nwitnesses or by the number of documents admitted in evidence. For a fact to be proved by a\npreponderance of the evidence, you must find that the fact is more likely true than not true.\n\n         7. A fact may be established by direct evidence or by circumstantial evidence or both. A\nfact is established by direct evidence when proved by documentary evidence or by witnesses who\nsaw the act done or heard the words spoken. A fact is established by circumstantial evidence when\nit may be fairly and reasonably inferred from other facts proved.\n\n       8. Do not decide who you think should win before you answer the questions and then just\nanswer the questions to match your decision. Answer each question carefully without considering\nwho will win. Do not discuss or consider the effect your answers will have.\n\n       9. Do not answer questions by drawing straws or by any method of chance.\n\n       10. Some questions might ask you for a dollar amount. Do not agree in advance to decide\non a dollar amount by adding up each juror's amount and then figuring the average.\n                                                 2\n\nMay 14,2014\n\n\n\n\n                                                                     1122\n\fI\n\n~                                          DC           BK14139 PG264\n\n\n\n\n            11. Do not trade your answers. For example, do not say, \"I will answer this question your\n    way if you answer another question my way.\"\n\n            12. To return a verdict, the same group of at least 10 of you must agree on each and every\n    answer. You may not have one group of 10 jurors agree on one answer and a different group of\n    10 jurors agree on another answer.\n\n           As I have said before, if you do not follow these instructions, you will be guilty of juror\n    misconduct, and I might have to order a new trial and start this process over again. This would\n    waste your time and the parties' money, and would require the taxpayers of this county to pay for\n    another trial. If a juror breaks any of these rules, tell that person to stop and report it to me\n    immediately.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    3\n\n    May 14,2014\n\n\n\n\n                                                                        1123\n\f                                       DC        BK14139 PG265\n\n\n\n\n                                  Instructions and Definitions\n\nAssignment.

However, no contract was\n        ultimately at issue in Crown Life; the plaintiffs \"sued Casteel and Crown alleging DTP A, Article\n        21.21, and common-law causes of action.\" The same is true of Ellender. In Galle, the Third\n        Court revisited the question again citing Crown Life but without referencing CTTI In Galle, the\n\n        1\n          The same principles will apply to more than two parties but as shorthand I will use \"two\" throughout\n        this letter, particularly because there are two breaching parties at issue here.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                           1437\n\fD-1-GN-1 0-002325\nPage 2 of5\n\ncourt held that \"the rule is not limited to tort claims and applied settlement credits to preclude a\nrecovery in contract.\n\n        The cases following CIT/, identified by RLJ, are inapposite. Invest/n. com, Moon Sun\nKang, and Karbach each construed but one contract, determined whether certain individuals\nwere or were not parties to that contract, and say nothing about settlement credits. In a\nMemorandum Opinion, the court in LJ Charter recites the same law on one-satisfaction cited by\nthe Galle court. This includes the principle that the single injury, not the cause of action, is\ndeterminative. However, with respect to the part of the LJ Charter opinion cited, the court does\nnot seem to apply it. Stating that individuals who are not parties to the contract \"could not be\njointly liable for the breach of contract damages,\" focuses on the cause of action rather than the\ninjury. If there is one single, indivisible injury caused by two entities - one breaching a common\nlaw duty and one breaching a contract, any award for that injury against one defendant should be\ncredited against the other. Perhaps the court meant that under the facts of the case the contract\ndamages were distinct, divisible damages.\n\n        In Ellender, 2 the Texas Supreme Court instructed courts to look to the settlement\nagreement exclusively to determine if settlement funds were apportioned between divisible or\nindivisible damages and in what amounts. 3\n\n        Here, the settlement agreement merely states what would be true even if unstated -\nEBCO's settlement does not release any claims against ESG. To establish that all or some ofthe\nsettlement funds were apportioned to divisible claims against EBCO, RLJ needed to identify that\ncategory of damages and state the amount apportioned to it. 4 Since RLJ did not do so, the court\nis required to presume that the entire settlement amount is credited to ESG.\n\n        The legal justification given for excluding contracts is that no party can be jointly liable\nfor a breach of a contract that it did not enter. This is true but misses the point by conflating the\nbreach from which liability arises with the damages arising from each breach. There are two\ndistinct breaches of two separate contracts by separate parties. Neither party is held liable for the\n\n\n2\n   Mobil Oil Corp. v. Ellender, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1652623\"><a href=\"/opinion/1652623/mobil-oil-corp-v-ellender/\"><span class=\"volume\">968</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">917</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 929 (Tex. 1998)\n3\n  In Galle, the court stated the expansiveness of the release demonstrated that the settlement funds were\nnot apportioned between types of damage. Since a paying party will always expect a full release, the\nscope of the release, if the determining factor, would always preclude apportionment. In any event, this\npart of the Galle opinion is dicta because the court found that the plaintiff had the burden to prove\napportionment and had not done so; the court's ruling was not dependent on what the release said but\nwhat the settlement did not say. In Ellender, the Supreme Court looked for language of apportionment\nbetween types of damage rather than the scope of the release.\n4\n  Whether RLJ could have, consistent with the pleadings and the evidence, identified divisible damages is\nanother question. There was evidence of repair costs due to EBCO's failure to build to specifications,\nbut RLJ may not have presented those as divisible damages in its pleading or evidence. The damage\nquestion in the Charge asked for damages \"due to ESG's failure to comply.\" The question had to ask\nspecifically about damages resulting from ESG 's failure to inquire about cause-in-fact. That\nspecification, however, does not mean, without more, that the damages found were divisible and\nattributable only to ESG.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                   1438\n\fD-1-GN-1 0-002325\nPage 3 of5\n\n\n\nother's breach. Each party is liable for its own breach which by itself results in indivisible\ndamages. Just as with joint tortfeasors who breach different common law duties that each\nproximately cause an indivisible damage. (As the Pattern Jury Charge states, there may be more\nthan one proximate cause of an occurrence.)\n\n        Any perception that applying the one-satisfaction rule here would be unfair may arise\nfrom the fact that RLJ sought more in damages than the jury awarded and received more in\nsettlement with EBCO alone than the jury awarded in damages. Had there been no settlement,\nthough, the jury's determination of diminished value would be the amount owed jointly by\nEBCO and ESG, even less than what RLJ received in settlement from EBCO. The source of\nRLJ's disappointment regarding damages is the jury verdict, not the application of settlement\ncredits to it.\n\nThe one satisfaction rule as applied to attorney's fees\n\n       Regarding ESG' s objection to Plaintiffs Motion for Attorney's fees, the only aspect\nbefore the court now is a pure question of law - when settlement credit equal or exceed the\ndamages awarded against the non-settling party does it extinguish any claim for attorney's fees?\n\n        Historically, as RLJ has pointed out, the one-satisfaction rule has been discussed in both\ncases and commentary almost exclusively in the context of torts, which of course do not involve\nattorney's fee claims. The limitation to the full amount of damages, therefore, should be read in\nthat context and not taken as a deliberate decision to disregard attorney's fees claims. There are\nbut a few cases addressing the application of the one-satisfaction rule to an attorney's fees claim\nassociated with a contract claim. Just as with the application to contract damages, the application\nto attorney's fees is new and developing. ESG is correct that the net-payment cases do not\naddress settlement credits for the same claim and damages. However, in the primary authority\nrelied upon by ESG, Osborne, there was a comparative fault question to which the jury answered\nthat Jauregi was less than 50% liable. Osborne also involved a procedural background very\ndifferent from the one here.\n\n        In neither Osborne nor any other case cited was there a settlement half-way through a jury\ntrial after years of litigation. The Osborne opinion begins by noting, \"[a]fter mold was\ndiscovered in the house, State Farm paid $1,874,687 in mold-related claims. Despite receiving\nthose payments, the Osbornes sued Jauregi and numerous subcontractors, settling before trial for\nmore than $1 million.\" Later in the analysis, the court again observes that the settlement was\npre-trial. Obsborne and Hamra cite and rely upon Blizzard and quote this particular sentence,\n\"[h]owever, it is quite another to allow attorney's fees on a claim that, although successful, was\npaid in full before trial [emphasis added].\" By contrast, here, the settlement with EBCO came in\nthe midst of trial, when RLJ was just days away from a verdict after incurring, it claims,\nhundreds of thousands in attorney's fees. ESG's position is effectively that RLJ, after settling\nwith EBCO, should have abandoned the trial and non-suited ESG, which had conceded nothing\nand settled nothing. Or, RLJ should not have settled because they would have been much better\n\n\n\n\n                                                               1439\n\fD-1-GN-1 0-002325\nPage 4 of5\n\noff with the very same verdict against both defendants. By such a verdict they would have been\nawarded the $700,000 against the defendants jointly, they would have prevailed and RLJ would\nhave had the potential of a significant award in attorney's fees. If ESG is correct, RLJ has not\nprevailed, directly and only, because it reached a settlement with EBCO. This disincentive to\nsettle is explained more fully below.\n\n       The procedural background aside, there is more than one reason a settlement credit\nexceeding damages should not automatically extinguish a claim for attorney's fees.\n\n         First, in contract, a plaintiff with an associated attorney's fees claim is not given one\nsatisfaction by damages alone. The plaintiff is not made whole or returned to its position before\nthe breach. Full satisfaction for RLJ would be the jury's verdict on damages, the fact-finder's              }_\n\n\nGury or judge by agreement as here) determination of fees shown to be incurred against the\ndefendants jointly or segregated as to those incurred against ESG alone, less the settlement\namount. The one-satisfaction rule is intended to limit a plaintiff to no more than full redress, not\nto restrict the plaintiff to less than that.\n\n        Second, the legislature has provided for the possibility of attorney's fees, even if not\nprovided in the contract itself, to hold individuals and entities to their agreements. There are of\ncourse several factors to consider in awarding attorney's fees, but the law recognizes that fees\nequal to or exceeding damages may be properly awarded. 5 Otherwise, no agreement worth less\nthan the attorney's fees required to enforce it would ever be enforced. That is the result if fees\ncan be extinguished, not just reduced, by a verdict that is less than another defendant's settlement\nof indivisible damages. A plaintiff who settles with one defendant for the full amount it seeks in\nindivisible damages and the full amount of the fees attributable to that defendant (indivisible and\nsegregated) would be foolish to continue to litigate against a remaining defendant with little or no\ndivisible damages even if the plaintiff knew liability could be established and had a high\nexpectation of proving significant fees. The remaining defendant does not receive a mere\nwindfall but rather a free pass at the expense of contract enforceability.\n\n        Third, the possibility that attorney's fees wi.ll be extinguished by a settlement with one\ndefendant skews the parties' calculation of probabilities and risks so as to greatly discourage all\nparties from settling. Litigants consciously or subconsciously conduct a calculation of the\n\n5\n  ESG's case law does not hold otherwise. The Smith v. Tam holding is that the appellate court erred in\nreversing a verdict for zero attorney's fees and rendering judgment for attorney's fees (1) as a matter of\nlaw (2) in an amount roughly equivalent to the total damages awarded and (3) equivalent to the full\namount fees sought by plaintiffs (4) even though the plaintiffs were awarded less than a third of the\ndamages sought, and (5) \"in the absence of evidence that such fees were warranted due circumstances\nunique to this case.\" Smith v. Patrick W. Y. Tam Trust, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"895170\"><a href=\"/opinion/895170/smith-v-patrick-wy-tam-trust/\"><span class=\"volume\">296</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">545</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 548 (Tex. 2009). ESG's\ndescription of the holding included none of those four crucial points. Barker is unremarkable; a remand\nfor redetermination of fees after the appellate court reduced the damages from $111,000 to $16,000. If\nthe law were, as ESG claims, that a court simply compares the amount awarded to the amount of fees and\nmake a determination the latter's reasonableness \"on its face,\" surely there would be better authority for\nthat proposition.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                   1440\n\fD-1-GN-1 0-002325\nPage 5 of5\n\n\n\nprobabilities of gain and loss. Because attorney's fees in a contract case may equal or even\nexceed damages, the probability of significant fees cannot be disregarded based on the probable\namount of damages alone. Defendants' calculations of course also entail this understanding.\nBecause of the probability of an award of some attorney's fees that will not necessarily be\nreduced in proportion to the award in damages, the opposing parties' valuations of the case come\ncloser to converging.\n\n        If, however, the award of attorney's fees becomes a function of receiving damages above\na certain amount, it radically changes the equation all parties have employed to calculate the\nprobabilities of gain and loss and greatly discourages settlement between the plaintiff and each\ndefendant. A plaintiff with a large fee claim will hesitate to enter an otherwise reasonable\nsettlement with one defendant because the entitlement to any fees (not already compensated)\nagainst the remaining, non-settling party, rides on a verdict for damages above the settlement. If\nthe plaintiff, as here, nonetheless does settle with one defendant, the plaintiff and remaining\ndefendant lose all incentive to settle. The plaintiff now compares the probability of a larger\nverdict with attorney's fees versus the probability of receiving nothing in additional damages\nand nothing in fees. The remaining defendant compares the probability of owing a larger verdict\nand fees versus the probability of owing nothing.

If the Architect determines that the conditions at\n            the site are not materially different from those indicated in the Contract Documents and that\n            no change in the terms of the Contract is justified, the Architect s1mll so notify the Owner and\n            Contractor in writing, stating the reasons.

GENERAL DENIAL\n\n        Pursuant to Rule 92 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, Defendants generally deny\n\neach and every, all and singular, the assertions alleged in Plaintiffs' Sixth Amended Original\n\nPetition and any amendments thereto and request that Plaintiffs be required to prove the charges\n\nand allegations against these Defendants by a preponderance of the evidence and/or by clear and\n\nconvincing evidence, as required by the Constitution and the Laws of the State of Texas.\n\nB.      SPECIFIC DENIAL\n\n        Pursuant to Rule 54 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, Defendants specifically deny\n\nthat all conditions precedent to the Plaintiffs' right to recover have been performed, have\n\noccurred, or have been waived or excused.        In particular, Defendants specifically deny that\n\nPlaintiffs have presented their claims for payment to Defendants or Defendants' duly authorized\n\nagents as required by Section 38.002(2) of the Texas Civil Practice & Remedies Code.\n\nC.      VERIFIED DENIALS\n\n        Pursuant to Rule 93 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, Defendants make the\n\nfollowing verified denials:\n\n        1.         Defendants deny the assignment of the contract upon which Plaintiffs' claims\n\nagainst Defendants are founded. Specifically, Defendants deny that Defendants or Defendants'\n\nauthorized representative(s) provided consent to assign the contract at issue to Plaintiffs.\n\nTherefore, any alleged assignment violates the anti-assignment clause of the contract and is null\n\nand void.\n\n\n\n\nELNESS, SWENSON, GRAHAM ARCHITECTS, INC. AND MARK G. SWENSON'S SECOND AMENDED\nANSWER AND ORIGINAL COUNTERCLAIM FOR DECLARATORY JUDGMENT- Page 2\n599603.1 4021122\n\n                                                                                                    47\n\f        2.         Defendants deny that Plaintiffs are entitled to recover in the capacity in which\n\nthey sue.    Defendants did not provide consent to assign the contract upon which Plaintiffs'\n\nclaims are founded, and any such assignment is, therefore, made in violation of the anti-\n\nassignment. As such, Plaintiffs are not parties to the contract and lack standing to bring contract\n\nclaims against Defendants.\n\n        3.         Defendants deny that Swenson is liable in the capacity in which he has been sued.\n\nIn particular, Swenson is not a signatory or a party to the contract upon which Plaintiffs' claims\n\nagainst Defendants are founded.\n\n        4.         Defendants incorporate by reference herein the sworn verification of Paul\n\nMittendorf£, a Principal and Vice President of Elness, Swenson, Graham Architects, Inc., which\n\nis attached to Defendants' First Amended Answer and Original Counterclaim for Declaratory\n\nJudgment filed with the Court on or about December 30, 2011.\n\nD.      AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES\n\n        Pleading in the affirmative, if such       IS   necessary, Defendants would further show as\n\nfollows:\n\n        1.         Plaintiffs' alleged injuries and damages, if any, resulted, if at all, from conditions\n\nunrelated to any act, omission or conduct of Defendants.\n\n        2.         Plaintiffs' alleged injuries and damages, if any, were caused, if at all, in whole or\n\nm part by the acts or omissions of others for whose conduct Defendants are not legally\n\nresponsible.\n\n        3.         At all times material to Plaintiffs' allegations, Defendants' conduct conformed to\n\nthe applicable standard of care.\n\n        4.         Plaintiffs' tort claims are barred in whole or in part, by the economic loss rule.\n\nELNESS, SWENSON, GRAHAM ARCHITECTS, INC. AND MARK G. SWENSON'S SECOND AMENDED\nANSWER AND ORIGINAL COUNTERCLAIM FOR DECLARATORY JUDGMENT- Page 3\n599603.1 4021122\n\n                                                                                                            48\n\f        5.         Alternatively, if the economic loss rule does not completely bar all of Plaintiffs'\n\ntort claims, then, pursuant to Chapter 33 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code,\n\nDefendants are entitled to a credit for any settlement Plaintiffs receive from any other person or\n\nentity. If Plaintiffs settle with any other person or entity, then Defendants reserve the right to\n\nmake a written election of credit for settlement under §33.014 of the Texas Civil Practice and\n\nRemedies Code.\n\n        6.         Alternatively, if the economic loss rule does not completely bar all of Plaintiffs'\n\ntort claims, then, Plaintiffs' alleged injuries and damages, if any, were caused, if at all, in whole\n\nor in part, by Plaintiffs' own negligence. Plaintiffs are wholly barred from recovery to the extent\n\nthe finder-of-fact determines Plaintiffs' comparative responsibility is 50% or greater, and, if\n\nPlaintiffs' comparative responsibility is less than 50%, any recovery must be reduced by\n\nPlaintiffs' percentage of responsibility determined by the finder-of-fact, in accordance with\n\nChapter 33 of the Texas Civil Practice & Remedies Code.\n\n        7.         Plaintiffs cannot recover for any amount that could have been avoided by their\n\nexercise of reasonable care.\n\n        8.         Plaintiffs' claims are barred, in whole or in part, by Plaintiffs' failure to mitigate\n\nany alleged damages.\n\n        9.         Plaintiffs' alleged injuries and damages, if any, resulted, if at all, from\n\nindependent, unforeseeable, intervening and/or superseding causes.              Any alleged action or\n\nomission on the part of Defendants was not the proximate cause, producing cause, or cause-in-\n\nfact ofPlaintiffs' alleged injuries or damages, if any.\n\n\n\n\nELNESS, SWENSON, GRAHAM ARCHITECTS, INC. AND MARK G. SWENSON'S SECOND AMENDED\nANSWER AND ORIGINAL COUNTERCLAIM FOR DECLARATORY JUDGMENT- Page 4\n599603.1 4021122\n\n                                                                                                            49\n\f        10.        Defendants assert any and all defenses and seek any and all relief to which\n\nDefendants may be entitled in accordance with and pursuant to Chapter 150 of the Texas Civil\n\nPractice and Remedies Code.\n\n        11.        Plaintiffs lack standing to sue on and are not parties to the contract on which\n\nPlaintiffs' claims against Defendants are founded. Assignment of the contract to Plaintiffs was\n\nmade without consent ofDefendants, in violation of the anti-assignment clause of the contract.\n\n        12.        Plaintiffs' non-contract claims are barred by the appropriate statute oflimitations.\n\n        13.        Plaintiffs' non-contract claims, including claims for equitable subrogation, are\n\nbarred by the economic loss doctrine.\n\n        14.        Plaintiffs' recovery, if any, is limited to direct contract damages, if any, pursuant\n\nto the waiver of consequential damages clause in the contract upon which Plaintiffs' claims\n\nagainst Defendants are founded. More specifically, Plaintiffs' claims for current and future lost\n\nrevenue, profits and diminution in value are barred by the consequential damages clause of the\n\ncontract.\n\n        15.        Plaintiffs' claims are barred against Defendants because Plaintiffs purchased the\n\nbuilding in question \"as is.\"\n\n        16.        Defendants reserve the right to amend or supplement with any additional\n\naffirmative defenses or pleas of avoidance to which Defendants may be entitled.\n\n                                                     II.\n\n                     COUNTERCLAIM FOR DECLARATORY JUDGMENT\n\nA.

As provided for by Chapter 37 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code,\n\nCounter-Claimants seek the following declarations from the Court:\n\n        a.         That the \"Anti-Assignment\" clause of the contract       IS   valid, enforceable and\n\n                   applies to Counter-Plaintiffs, making any ostensible assignment of the contract, in\n\n                   violation of the Anti-Assignment clause, null and void and of no effect;\n\n        b.         That the \"Statute of Limitations Accrual\" clause of the contract is valid and\n\n                   enforceable and, to the effect that a party could enforce the contract against\n\n                   Counter-Claimants, such Statute of Limitations Accrual clause establishes the\n\n                   date upon which any cause of action against Counter-Claimants accrues, i.e., the\n\n                   date that Counter-Claimants' services were substantially completed, which such\n\n                   date time-bars all of Counter-Defendants' causes of action with a two-year\n\n                   limitations period;\n\n        c.         That the \"Waiver of Consequential Damages\" clause of the Contract is valid and\n\n                   enforceable and, to the effect that a party could enforce the contract against\n\n                   Counter-Claimants, such Waiver of Consequential Damages clause bars Counter-\n\n                   Defendants from recovering any consequential damages from Counter-Claimants;\n\n                   and\n\n        d.         That Swenson was not a signatory or a party to the contract at issue here and, as\n\n                   such, cannot be liable to the Counter-Defendants under the contract.\n\n\n\nELNESS, SWENSON, GRAHAM ARCHITECTS, INC.

SWENSON'S SECOND AMENDED\nANSWER AND ORIGINAL COUNTERCLAIM FOR DECLARATORY JUDGMENT- Page 7\n599603.1 4021122\n\n                                                                                                          52\n\fE.      FACTUALBACKGROUND\n\n\n        1.         On or about January 1, 2005, White Lodging Services Corporation, Inc. (\"White\n\nLodging\") and ESG entered into an agreement for architect services, as set forth in the following\n\ncontracts: (i) AlA Document B141- 1997 Part 1: Standard Form of Agreement Between Owner\n\nand Architect with Standard Form of Architect's Services (the \"Contract - 1997 Part 1\"),\n\nattached hereto as Exhibit \"1;\" and (ii) AlA Document B141 - 1997 Part 2: Standard Form of\n\nArchitect's Services: Design and Contract Administration (the \"Contract - 1997 Part 2\"),\n\nattached hereto as Exhibit \"2.\"\n\n        2.         The Contract - 1997 Part 1 and the Contract - 1997 Part 2 (collectively, the\n\n\"Contract\") were both executed on March 30, 2005. The Contract was not signed by Swenson in\n\neither his individual or representative capacity.\n\n        3.         Section 1.3.7.9 of the Contract contains an Anti-Assignment clause, wherein\n\n\"[n]either [White Lodging] nor [ESG] shall assign this Agreement without the written consent of\n\nthe other, except that [White Lodging] may assign this Agreement to an institutional lender\n\nproviding financing on the Project.\"\n\n        4.         Section 1.3.6 of the Contract contains a Waiver of Consequential Damages clause,\n\nunder which both ESG and White Lodging \"waive consequential damages for claims, disputes,\n\nor other matters in question arising out of or relating to this [Contract].\"\n\n        5.         Section 1.3.7.3 of the Contract contains a clause commonly known as a \"Statute\n\nof Limitations Accrual\" clause, which provides the method to determine when a cause of action\n\naccrues for the purpose of starting the statute of limitations. Specifically, section 1.3.7.3 reads as\n\nfollows:\n\n\n\n\nELNESS, SWENSON, GRAHAM ARCHITECTS, INC. AND MARK G. SWENSON'S SECOND AMENDED\nANSWER AND ORIGINAL COUNTERCLAIM FOR DECLARATORY JUDGMENT- Page 8\n599603.1 4021122\n\n                                                                                                         53\n\f                   Causes of action between the parties to this Agreement pertaining\n                   to acts or failures to act shall be deemed to have accrued and the\n                   applicable statute of limitations shall commence to run not later\n                   than either the date of Substantial Completion for acts or failures to\n                   act occurring prior to Substantial Completion or the date of\n                   issuance of the final Certificate for Payment for acts or failures to\n                   act occurring after Substantial Completion. In no event shall such\n                   statute of limitations commence to run any later than the date\n                   when the Architect's services are substantially completed.\n\n(Emphasis added).\n\n        6.         On or about March 16, 2006 White Lodging, et al. and Counter-Defendants\n\nentered into an agreement entitled New Hotels Purchase and Sale Agreement by and between\n\nWhiteco Industries, Inc. and RLJ Lodging Fund II Acquisitions, LLC, (the \"New Hotels Purchase\n\nand Sale Agreement\"), through which Counter-Defendants claim that the Contract was assigned\n\nto them.\n\n        7.         ESG did not consent to an assignment of the Contract from White Lodging to\n\nCounter-Defendants, allegedly effectuated through the New Hotels Purchase and Sale\n\nAgreement.\n\n        8.         ESG's services were substantially complete before the date the Certificate of\n\nOccupancy was issued for the Project, which was on October 12, 2006. Therefore, any causes of\n\naction against Counter-Claimants accrued, if at all, no later than October 12, 2006.\n\n        9.         Counter-Defendants initiated this lawsuit and filed Plaintiffs' Original Petition\n\nand Request for Disclosure on July 7, 2010.                   Therefore, the negligence, negligent\n\nmisrepresentation and equitable subrogation causes of action asserted by Counter-Defendants,\n\neach of which are governed by a two-year limitations period, are time-barred by the statute of\n\nlimitations.\n\n\n\n\nELNESS, SWENSON, GRAHAM ARCHITECTS, INC.

Counter-Defendants seek recovery from Counter-Claimants for, among other\n\nthings, diminution in the Project's value, lost revenue and other consequential damages, which\n\nsuch recovery is barred by the Waiver of Consequential Damages clause in the Contract.\n\nF.      CAUSE OF ACTION: APPLICATION FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF.\n\n        1.         Counter-Claimants incorporate by reference paragraphs II.A.1 through and\n\nincluding II.E.1 0 above as if fully set forth verbatim herein.\n\n        2.         There exists an actual and justiciable controversy between Counter-Claimants and\n\nCounter-Defendants herein, within the jurisdiction of this Court, and involving rights, duties,\n\nlegal obligations and relations of the parties under the Contract at issue.\n\n        3.         Counter-Claimants petition this Court, pursuant to Chapter 37 of the Texas Civil\n\nPractice and Remedies Code, to declare that:\n\n        a.         the Anti-Assignment clause of the Contract is valid, enforceable and applies to\n\n                   Counter-Plaintiffs, making the assignment of the Contract, which was in violation\n\n                   of the Anti-Assignment clause, null and void and of no effect;\n\n        b.         the Statute of Limitations Accrual clause of the Contract is valid and enforceable\n\n                   and establishes the date upon which any cause of action against ESG accrued was\n\n                   on or before October 12, 2006, which is the latest date by which ESGs' services\n\n                   were substantially completed;\n\n        c.         that all of Counter-Defendants' causes of action against ESG with a two-year\n\n                   limitations period are time-barred;\n\n\n\n\nELNESS, SWENSON, GRAHAM ARCHITECTS, INC.

COSTS AND ATTORNEYS' FEES\n\n        Counter-Claimants have retained the undersigned law firm to represent them in this\n\naction and have agreed to pay the firm all costs and reasonable and necessary attorneys' fees\n\nincurred in this matter.

This article was transferred into the Civil Practice and\nRemedies Code in 1985 and numbered as § 33.012. Major tort reform measures amended the provision in\n1987, 1995, and 2003.\n\n     The 1987 amendment codified the “one-satisfaction” rule (the Bradshaw Rule). Subsequent\namendments allowed a non-settling defendant to elect either a dollar-for-dollar credit for all\nsettlements with the plaintiff, a credit based on the percentage of liability assigned to the parties by\nthe trier of fact, or a statutory sliding scale. However, in 2003, H.B. 4 eliminated the election of the\ndollar-for-dollar or sliding scale credit, except for those sued for health care liability.\n\n    S.B. 890 restored the election of the dollar-for-dollar settlement credit.\n\n\n\n\nLegislative History of                            Page i                         Capitol Research Services\nTex.

HOUSE\nCOMMITTEE ON CIVIL PRACTICES, “Report to the 79th Texas Legislature” (November, 2004). [Exhibit 6.]\n\n   The Civil Practices Committee was charged by the Speaker of the House with monitoring the\nimplementation of H.B. 4 (2003).\n\n        Charge Two\n\n        Monitor the legislation passed by the 78th Legislature, with a particular emphasis on\n        the implementation of and rulemaking for H.B. 4.\n\n    Id. 7.\n\n    The Interim Report recommended\n\n        Settlement Credit\n\n        The settlement credit change in H.B. 4 has created a major problem in multi-defendant\n        lawsuits that do not involved medical liability. H.B. 4 rightly abolished the old\n        sliding scale settlement credit, but it also eliminated the dollar-for-dollar credit that\n        has been an integral part of Texas law for many, many years. H.B. 4 retained the\n        dollar-for-dollar credit in medical liability cases, but not for other tort actions. This\n        change in the law has put non-settling defendants at a serious disadvantage and in\n        many cases will allow claimants to recover more than 100 percent of their damages. It\n        also creates substantial conflicts between defendants, encourages collusive settlements,\n        and makes it much more difficult to coordinate the defense of mass actions, especially\n        in the toxic tort arena.\n\n        The Committee recommends restoring the optional dollar-for-dollar credit and\n        allowing the non-settling defendant to elect the appropriate credit after verdict. This\n        solution would both preserve the claimant’s recovery and allow defendants the full\n        benefit of a settlement before trial.\n\n    Id. 7.\n\n\n\n\n2005— S.B. 890\nS.B. 890 Filed\n    During the Regular Session of the 79th Texas Legislature, Sen.

CAPITOL RESEARCH SERVICES, Hearings on S.B. 890 Before the Senate Committee\non State Affairs, 79th Leg. R.S. (March 31, 2005). [Exhibit 13.]\n\n   Sen. Williams offered a committee substitute for S.B. 890. Id. [NOTE: A substitute is an amendment\nwhich replaces the text of the whole bill.]\n\n      Sen. Williams explained S.B. 890 to the committee.\n\n                  SEN. TOMMY WILLIAMS : The Committee Substitute to Senate Bill 890 – since\n          the 1930’s, Texas has recognized that an injured party’s entitled to recover only once for\n          an injury. Subsequent to 1987, Chapter 33 allowed the non-settling defendant to elect\n          either a dollar-for-dollar credit for all settlements with the plaintiff, or a credit\n          based on the percentage of liability assigned to parties by a trier of fact, or statutory\n          sliding scale. House Bill 4, the Tort Reform Act of 2003, radically changed this scheme,\n          and it eliminated the dollar-for-dollar sliding scale of credit, except for those sued for\n          health care liability. Instead non-settling defendants now receive credit only for that\n          percentage of fault that a trier of fact assigns to the settling person. Thus, if the jury\n          finds no liability for a settling person, the court may not credit any prior settlements\n          against the non-settling defendant’s liability.\n\n                                              House Bill 4 created an anomaly in Texas law by\n          retaining the dollar-for-dollar credit in medical liability cases, but eliminating it for\n          all others. There’s not a policy rationale for this distinction, and the law as it stands\n          now creates a privileged class of defendants.\n\n                                             Senate Bill 890 solves the problem by restoring the\n          election of the dollar-for-dollar credit, just as in medical liability cases.\n\n                                            The committee substitute language is – has being\n          agreed to by the Texas Association of Defense Council and the Texas Civil Justice\n          League, and the Texas Trial Lawyer Association, and it removes the election provision\n          and allows the percentage equal to each settling person’s percentage responsibility as\n          found by the trier of fact that was in the original bill as filed.\n\n                                           Mr. Chairman, I think there are witnesses here that\n          would probably be very valuable in trying to answer any questions that you or any of\n          the other committee members might have.\n\nLegislative History of                              Page 8                          Capitol Research Services\nTex.

Williams for the agreement embodied in S.B. 890.\n\n                  CHAIR                   : I want to congratulate you on pulling together the\n         coalition – in what I think what seems to be a kind of a monumental agreement on\n         something that’s always been an issue in civil jurisprudence.\n\nId.\n\n    David Chamberlain, representing the Texas Association of Defense Counsel, testified in favor of\nS.B. 890.\n\n                 DAVID E. CHAMBERLAIN : I’m David Chamberlain, and I’m president of the\n         Texas Association of Defense Council, which has over 2100 civil defense lawyers\n         practicing in the state every day handling cases of the nature that this bill will affect.\n         We’re the largest state association of defense lawyers in the country.\n\n                                              I am here to testify in favor of this bill. As Sen.\n         Williams pointed out, we have an anomaly in the system right now. We have\n         basically two different systems, one for healthcare liability cases, one for general\n         liability cases, or a different one for general liability cases. In the general liability\n         cases, currently you can only take a percentage reduction for the negligence in the\n         comparative fault of a settling co-defendant. On the other hand, in a medical\n         malpractice lawsuit, you get a choice, and that choice is either that percentage\n         reduction or a dollar credit. Our experience has been, since September of 2003, from the\n         defense perspective, that it creates and encourages the discord and litigation among co-\n         defendants, who were faced with the tasks of actually having to prove the negligence\n         of what was a friendly – former friendly co-defendant, who has now settled out. And if\n         you want to take – you can’t take advantage of whatever they paid the plaintiff to\n         reduce the overall judgment. You actually – actually have to prove the only negligent,\n         you know, what was once your friend. That creates all sorts of situations and\n         opportunities for malpractice, for conflicts of interest, particularly in toxic tort cases\n         and multiple party cases. And I can – if the committee is interested, I could certainly\n         give examples of that later on.\n\n                                               We feel like that Senator – that Senate Bill 890, the\n         substitute, will solve all of these problems. It’ll switch everything over to a very\n         simple dollar credit only reduction. It’ll bring uniformity and symmetry to all the cases\n         – civil cases. It’ll quiet the discord and litigation among co-defendants. It’ll reduce\n         litigation expense considerably. It will take out the gamesmanship, the guessing about\n         what’s going to happen when you have to make an election in the health care liability\n         field. Everybody’ll know what the deal is going in. We think it’ll greatly facilitate\n         settlements. It’ll reduce the opportunity for – for malpractice, which, again, reduces\n         subsequent or satellite litigation. And we think quite clearly, that this comes as close\n         as humanly possible to achieving the Bradshaw Rule, which we’ve been trying so hard\n         to achieve over the past few decades, and that is only one satisfaction for one injury.\n         And I want to thank the committee for that opportunity to speak today.\n\n                 CHAIR                 : Does that mean if we pass this bill, that we won’t\n         have to endure any more seminar lectures on settlement credit?\n\n\n\nLegislative History of                             Page 9                          Capitol Research Services\nTex.

Kirk Watson will be out of business. No more\n          lawyers trying to do math, which is – sounds funny, Senator, but lawyers trying to do\n          math is a very ugly thing.\n\n                  CHAIR                    : It’s usually lawyers are lawyers because they can’t do\n          math, as opposed to doctors, or engineers.\n\nId.\n\n      Guy Choate, representing the Texas Association of Trial Lawyers, testified in favor of S.B. 890.\n\n                 GUY CHOATE               : I’m Guy Choate, with Texas Trial Lawyers\n          Association, and I don’t believe I can say it any better than David said it.\n\n                                               This – this change will provide certainty in the law.\n          It’s fairness. Certainly there is the opportunity under the laws that exist today for\n          plaintiffs to make essentially a double recovery, if they choose right. It encourages the\n          plaintiff a lot of times to settle with the principal defendant, and sometimes just roll\n          the dice on one that really don’t have that much exposure, because they don’t have\n          that downside risk. This is a fair way to handle this problem. It enhances the\n          opportunity and ability of plaintiffs and defendants to settle their litigation without\n          the potential for either the plaintiff or the defendant being second-guessed or creating\n          malpractice themselves by their conduct. We think this is a good law. We think that\n          certainly momentum ought to develop around it, given the fact that the people who\n          actually have to do this on a day-by-day basis all feel that this is the best way to\n          handle it, and we appreciate the opportunity that the Senator has given us to work\n          with him on this bill, because we think that this is a good response to this problem.\n\n                  CHAIR                      : I note in your card that you filed the position in\n          opposition to the bill as filed, but I think what you’ve told me now is that you would\n          need to change that.\n\n                  CHOATE                   : Yes, on the committee substitute, we’re absolutely in\n          favor, and I’m sorry. I wasn’t clear how to do that.\n\nId.\n\n      Mike Slack, representing the Texas Association of Trial Lawyers, testified in favor of S.B. 890.\n\n                   MIKE SLACK                : Mr. Chairman, Sen. Williams. I’m Mike Slack. I’m a\n          past president of TTLA, and regrettably, over the last 20 years, have had far too much\n          time invested in dealing with Chapter 33 settlement credit issues, where Texas has\n          migrated through some awfully unfortunate waters, resulting in a lot of gamesmanship,\n          and resulting in a lot of what I call judicial experimentation gone bad. I think I can\n          think of few moments where we have altered our laws that have been more positive\n          than the bill, the substitute bill you have in front of you today.

One, the election, the\n        ability to elect is something that’s very, very important to our clients. It’s really a\n        dollar issue for us in healthcare liability claims. We – we are not opposed to the notion\n        that everyone should get the election. We are only supportive of the notion that at\n        least that we should. In the context of House Bill 4, there were – there are several\n        provisions in House Bill 4 relating to, that have an impact on settlement credits that\n        we were not entirely comfortable with during the process. And, in fact, the provision\n        that this bill addresses was not in the engrossed version on the House side of the House\n        Bill 4 at all. We in particular, would not have supported the third party practice, and\n        the questions that raises about limitations. And we only ultimately supported of that\n        part of the bill when the exception for healthcare and liability claims was inserted\n        into House Bill 4 very late in the process in Chairman Nixon’s office when a whole\n        bunch of us were there. So, we don’t oppose everyone having the election, we only want\n        to attempt to make sure that we keep it.\n\n               CHAIR                   : Why, anecdotally, explain why the election is\n        important in a healthcare claim?\n\n                 HULL                    : Any case where we estimate that the sum of the\n        settling defendant’s percentage of responsibility, times the jury verdict, will be greater\n        than the dollar-for-dollar credit paid by the settling defendant, it is to our advantage\n        to take that percent. In any case, conversely, where the dollar-for-dollar credit we\n        think will work to our advantage, then we would want to take that. And, so it becomes\n        very much a dollar issue for us.\n\n               HULL                      : Under – under proportionate responsibility, as enacted\n        in House Bill 4 –\n\n                 HULL                    : Yes.\n\n                 CHAIR                    : Don’t you still get to reduce the liability by the sum of\n        the total of the responsible individuals until you get the – unless you’re, well, I mean\n        you get – you still get to reduce the reliability under those percentages of responsibility,\n        don’t you? Even if they settle?\n\nLegislative History of                            Page 11                          Capitol Research Services\nTex. S.B. 890                                                                                  Austin, Texas\n79th Leg., R.S. (2005)                                                                        (512)371-1440\n\f                                                          205: Senate Committee Hearings on S.B. 890\n\n\n                 HULL                       : We would get the – we would get the – under the\n        House Bill 4 scenario, we would get the percent, if that’s what we elected, or the\n        dollar-for-dollar credit. The two examples I’ve sketched out where it makes a\n        difference for us, is that if you assume the two defendants case, where the to-the-jury\n        defendant got 40%, the settling defendant got 60%, and the verdict was $700,000 and\n        there’s a $500,000 settlement. Then it works to the advantage of the defendant that’s\n        tried to elect the dollar – to – to elect the percent credit. But, if on the other hand you\n        think that the dollar-for-dollar credit is going to be less than the percent. And in\n        particular, it’s a problem for us because there is so many low limit positions. So still, if\n        you have a $200,000 defendant, who settles out, who is going to get a much greater\n        share, then we end up potentially picking that up depending on where our percent of\n        the responsibility falls.\n\n                CHAIR                   : You may have just answered it. But, why would the\n        healthcare claims be different than any other multiple defendant case?\n\n                 HULL                     : I don’t know that it is, and that’s why I say, we were\n        not really in favor of making it one way or the other exclusively, ever, because we\n        think, I mean, I have other than health care clients, myself, and it can be a problem in\n        those cases too. So –\n\n                CHAIR                     : Do you agree that, from time to time that the\n        possibility of the option or the election causes an impediment to settlement of parties to\n        the case?\n\n                 HULL                     : It probably does. I can’t tell you that it never does. I\n        really think any way you go. I mean we went – There was testimony about this last\n        time. We all have our experience of it. There is an advantage to one party or the other\n        depending on the case, under any of these circumstances. If you’re a dollar-for-dollar\n        person, and you’re on the plaintiff’s side, you might think it works to your advantage to\n        hold out because you can’t get enough. So – there are advantages to one party or the\n        other under any scenario that we have been thus far, able to come up with. We would\n        just, and if we’re going to re-visit this issue then, there is revisiting the issue of joining\n        responsible third parties, which is a looming terrible problem for us. Once you can name\n        a defendant against whom limitations has already expired, it raises substantial\n        problems. So, unless there is further questions, I’m done.\n\nId.\n\n   George Scott Christian, representing the Texas Civil justice League, testified in favor of the\nCommittee Substitute for S.B. 890.\n\n                 GEORGE CHRISTIAN : Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My name is George\n        Christian, and I’m an attorney representing the Texas Civil Justice League. We are in\n        support of the Committee Substitute for Senate Bill 890 for many of the reasons that\n        you’ve already heard. We think that it’s the best overall solution to this problem that\n        we’ve really been dealing with since 1987. As you know, Sen. Duncan, we’ve had these\n        settlement credits issues repeatedly in the last almost 20 years. And we believe that\n        the committee substitute is fair to everyone. I think the dollar-for-dollar credit in the\n        vast majority of cases, if not all cases, always squares up the parties, and the plaintiff\n        will get as close to one satisfaction rule as possible to do. Everybody gets full credit for\n        the dollars that have already been settled. There’s really no gamesmanship involved.\n        I agree with a lot of what Mike Hull said, about you know the benefits of an election.\n\nLegislative History of                             Page 12                          Capitol Research Services\nTex.

That is probably true. And – but, nevertheless, we believe that the law ought\n          to be the same for all defendants, and for all plaintiffs. We think that this treats\n          everybody equally. We think it squares the parties in the end of the day, which is\n          what you want to do. And we do think the current system of bifurcated settlement credit\n          is not justifiable from a policy standpoint and deters settlements. And that is a serious\n          problem. And we would like to see if we can’t get that addressed. And we appreciate\n          you and Sen. Williams dealing with this.\n\nId.\n\n      Chairman Duncan read the names of persons in support of S.B. 890 who did not wish to testify. Id.\n\n      S.B. 890 was left pending.

(Bradshaw v. Baylor, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3965621\"><a href=\"/opinion/4195232/bradshaw-v-baylor-university/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Tex.</span> <span class=\"page\">99</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 101; </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3965621\"><a href=\"/opinion/4195232/bradshaw-v-baylor-university/\"><span class=\"volume\">84</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">703</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 704 (1935)). The\n          “one-satisfaction” rule was codified by the Legislature in Chapter 33, Civil Practice\n          and Remedies Code, in 1987. Subsequent to the 1987 amendments, Chapter 33 allowed a\n          non-settling defendant to elect either a dollar-for-dollar credit for all settlements with\n          the plaintiff, a credit based on the percentage of liability assigned to the parties by\n          the trier of fact, or a statutory sliding scale. H.B. 4, the tort reform measure enacted by\n          the 78th Legislature, Regular Session, 2003, radically changed this scheme. It\n          eliminated the election of the dollar-for-dollar or sliding scale credit, except for those\n          sued for health care liability. Instead, non-settling defendants now receive credit only\n          for that percentage of fault that a trier of fact assigns to a settling person. Thus, if a jury\n          finds no liability for a settling person, the court may not credit any prior settlements\n          against the non-settling defendant’s liability.\n\n          The settlement credit scheme created by H.B. 4 eliminates the one-satisfaction rule\n          that has been part of Texas law for more than 70 years, except in medical liability\n          cases. This creates the potential for unjust windfalls for plaintiffs, who can now recover\n          far in excess of their total damages. This problem is acute in lawsuits involving\n          multiple defendants. For example, if a plaintiff sues ten defendants for $1 million in\n          damages, and nine defendants settle for $100,000 each, the plaintiff collects $900,000 in\n          settlements. If a jury then finds little or no liability for the settling defendants, the\n          tenth defendant is liable for the full $1 million. The plaintiff thus recovers $1.9\n          million, despite being awarded only $1 million in damages. This unjustly enriches the\n          plaintiff and penalizes the defendant who went to trial.\n\n\n\nLegislative History of                               Page 15                           Capitol Research Services\nTex. S.B. 890                                                                                      Austin, Texas\n79th Leg., R.S.

For example, a defendant could agree to settle a claim at trial for less by\n         agreeing with the plaintiff to wait to settle until after all sides have rested their\n         cases. It would then be far too late for non-settling defendants to introduce evidence of\n         the settling defendant’s proportionate responsibility. Such collusion not only\n         undermines the purpose of Texas’ proportionate responsibility law, which is designed\n         to ensure that parties only pay for their proportionate share of the plaintiff’s harm,\n         but it discourages defendants who believe they have little or no liability from trying\n         the lawsuit to a jury. Current law thus undermines the jury system and will vastly\n         increase the cost of litigation, especially in the mass tort arena.\n\n         Finally, H.B. 4 created an anomaly in Texas law by retaining the dollar-for-dollar\n         credit in medical liability cases but eliminating it in all others. There is no policy\n         rationale for this distinction. The law as it now stands creates a privileged class of\n         defendants.\n\n         C.S.S.B. 890 restores the election of the dollar-for-dollar credit, just as in medical\n         liability cases.\n\nId.\n\n      The analysis reviewed the rulemaking authority delegated by the bill.

It eliminated the\n          election of the dollar-for-dollar or sliding scale credit, except for those sued for health\n          care liability. Instead, non-settling defendants now receive credit only for that\n          percentage of fault that a trier of fact assigns to a settling person. Thus, if a jury finds no\n          liability for a settling person, the court may not credit any prior settlements against the\n          non-settling defendant's liability.\n\n          CSSB 890 restores the dollar-for-dollar settlement credit in civil actions, while\n          maintaining current law for health care liability claims.\n\nId.

Id.\n\n      The analysis summarized each section of the bill and noted the effective date.\n\n          ANALYSIS\n\n          CSSB 890 amends Section 33.012(b), Civil Practice and Remedies Code, by adding \"the\n          sum of the dollar amounts of all settlements\" and striking \"a percentage equal to each\n          settling person's percentage of responsibility\".\n\n          EFFECTIVE DATE\n\n          Upon passage, or, if it the Act does not receive the necessary vote, the Act takes effect\n          September 1, 2005.\n\nId.\n\n      The analysis also compared the “original” (S.B. 890 as filed) to the committee substitute.\n\n          COMPARISON OF ORIGINAL TO SUBSTITUTE\n\n          C.S.S.B. 890 differs from the original by restoring the current election of credit in\n          health care liability cases. The substitute continues current law for health care\n          liability claims, while restoring the dollar-for-dollar settlement credit in other civil\n          actions.\n\nId.\n\n      Lastly, the analysis explained the actions of the committee.

HRO is an agency of the Texas\nHouse which analyzes bills that come to the House floor for debate. HOUSE RESEARCH\nO RGANIZATION, S.B. 890 Bill Analysis (May 23, 2005). [Exhibit 20.]\n\n      The HRO analysis noted the subject of S.B. 890.\n\n         SUBJECT:\n\n         Dollar-for-dollar credit against amount of recovery in most civil actions\n\nId.\n\n      The HRO analysis reviewed the background of S.B. 890 and summarized its provisions.\n\n         BACKGROUND:\n\n         Civil Practice and Remedies Code, sec. 33.012, states that if a plaintiff settles with one\n         or more defendants and goes to trial against any other defendant, then any amount the\n         plaintiff is awarded against the defendant at trial must be reduced by a percentage\n         equal to each settling party’s percentage of responsibility. Defendants in health care\n         liability claims may choose to have the amount t hey owe to the plaintiff reduced by\n         either a percentage equal to each settling party’s percentage of responsibility or by the\n         total dollar sum of all settlements.\n\n         DIGEST:\n\n         SB 890 would amend sec. 33.012 to change the amount that an award against a\n         defendant could be reduced from a percentage credit based on a party's responsibility to\n         a dollar-for-dollar credit based on the sum of all settlements. Defendants in health\n         care liability cases still could choose their reduction method.\n\n         The bill would take immediate effect if finally passed by a two –thirds record vote of\n         the membership of each house. Otherwise, it would take effect September 1, 2005. The\n         bill would apply to all actions commenced on or after the effective date, or pending on\n         the effective date and in which the trial or any new trial or retrial begins on or after\n         the effective date. For actions commenced before the effective date, the former law\n         would continue in effect for any trial, new trial, or retrial in progress on the effective\n         date.\n\nId.\n\n      The HRO analysis reviewed the arguments of the supporters and opponents of the bill.\n\n         SUPPORTERS SAY:\n\n         Requiring a dollar-for-dollar reduction of damage awards would be more fair.\n         Plaintiffs are limited by law to only one full recovery, but under sec. 33.012 they are\n         sometimes able to recover more than the amount authorized by the judge or jury. This\n         could happen in a case where the plaintiff settled with defendant A and went to trial\n         with defendant B, but the court found that defendant A was not responsible. The\n         plaintiff would have collected from defendant A and would be entitled to a full\nLegislative History of                            Page 20                          Capitol Research Services\nTex.

Requiring a dollar-for-dollar reduction would\n           decrease the amount defendant B had to pay the plaintiff by the amount that\n           defendant A already had paid. This could ensure that the plaintiff received only one\n           recovery and no more.\n\n           Requiring dollar-for-dollar credits also would reduce litigation between co-defendants\n           seeking to avoid having to pay part of the recovery to the plaintiff because the dollar-\n           for-dollar system is straightforward and not capable of being abused or manipulated by\n           any co-defendant.\n\n           OPPONENTS SAY:\n\n           There is no reasonable basis for defendants in health care liability cases to have a\n           choice between a dollar-for-dollar credit and a percentage credit. For the sake of\n           fairness and consistency, all defendants should be subject to the dollar-for-dollar credit,\n           with no type of defendant receiving special treatment.\n\nId.\n\n       The HRO analysis also contained a notes section.\n\n           NOTES:\n\n           The Senate-passed version would have applied the dollar-for-dollar credit to all\n           defendants, including defendants in health care liability cases.\n\nId.\n\n\n\n\nHouse Floor Debate on S.B. 890\n\nSecond Reading: May 24\n\n    S.B. 890 came before the House on May 24.

(Bradshaw v. Baylor, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3965621\"><a href=\"/opinion/4195232/bradshaw-v-baylor-university/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Tex.</span> <span class=\"page\">99</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 101; </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3965621\"><a href=\"/opinion/4195232/bradshaw-v-baylor-university/\"><span class=\"volume\">84</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">703</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 704 (1935)). The\n         “one-satisfaction” rule was codified by the Legislature in Chapter 33, Civil Practice\n         and Remedies Code, in 1987. Subsequent to the 1987 amendments, Chapter 33 allowed a\n         non-settling defendant to elect either a dollar-for-dollar credit for all settlements with\n         the plaintiff, a credit based on the percentage of liability assigned to the parties by\n         the trier of fact, or a statutory sliding scale. H.B. 4, the tort reform measure enacted by\n         the 78th Legislature, Regular Session, 2003, radically changed this scheme. It\n         eliminated the election of the dollar-for-dollar or sliding scale credit, except for those\n         sued for health care liability. Instead, non-settling defendants now receive credit only\n         for that percentage of fault that a trier of fact assigns to a settling person. Thus, if a jury\n         finds no liability for a settling person, the court may not credit any prior settlements\n         against the non-settling defendant’s liability.\n\n         The settlement credit scheme created by H.B. 4 eliminates the one-satisfaction rule\n         that has been part of Texas law for more than 70 years, except in medical liability\n         cases. This creates the potential for unjust windfalls for plaintiffs, who can now recover\n         far in excess of their total damages. This problem is acute in lawsuits involving\n         multiple defendants. For example, if a plaintiff sues ten defendants for $1 million in\n         damages, and nine defendants settle for $100,000 each, the plaintiff collects $900,000 in\n         settlements. If a jury then finds little or no liability for the settling defendants, the\n         tenth defendant is liable for the full $1 million. The plaintiff thus recovers $1.9\n         million, despite being awarded only $1 million in damages. This unjustly enriches the\n         plaintiff and penalizes the defendant who went to trial.\n\n         Eliminating the dollar-for-dollar credit also creates the potential for collusive\n         settlements. For example, a defendant could agree to settle a claim at trial for less by\n         agreeing with the plaintiff to wait to settle until after all sides have rested their\n         cases. It would then be far too late for non-settling defendants to introduce evidence of\n         the settling defendant’s proportionate responsibility. Such collusion not only\n         undermines the purpose of Texas’ proportionate responsibility law, which is designed\n         to ensure that parties only pay for their proportionate share of the plaintiff’s harm,\n         but it discourages defendants who believe they have little or no liability from trying\n         the lawsuit to a jury. Current law thus undermines the jury system and will vastly\n         increase the cost of litigation, especially in the mass tort arena.\n\n         Finally, H.B. 4 created an anomaly in Texas law by retaining the dollar-for-dollar\n         credit in medical liability cases but eliminating it in all others. There is no policy\n         rationale for this distinction. The law as it now stands creates a privileged class of\n         defendants.\n\n         S.B. 890 restores the election of the dollar-for-dollar credit, just as in medical liability\n         cases.\n\nId.\n\n      The analysis reviewed the rulemaking authority delegated by the bill.
