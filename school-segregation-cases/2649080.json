Code §§ 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12) to a term of 25 years\nto life in state prison for crimes he committed in 1998. After passage of the Three Strikes\nReform Act of 2012 (Reform Act), defendant filed a petition to recall that sentence and\nfor resentencing pursuant to section 1170.126.\n               The court, in its discretion, determined resentencing defendant would pose\nan unreasonable risk of danger to public safety, and therefore denied both the petition and\na subsequent motion for reconsideration. Defendant contends the court abused its\ndiscretion by erroneously failing to consider certain facts and by improperly considering\nother facts. We find no abuse of discretion and affirm.\n                        FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n1. Defendant’s Commitment Offenses\n               In 1998, defendant went into a bank and attempted to cash a check for\n$453.12 drawn on the account of Sara Delgadillo. Ms. Delgadillo had not signed the\ncheck or given defendant permission to cash it. The bank teller learned the checking\naccount had been flagged, and the branch manager called the police. Defendant told\npolice he had received the check from a man for whom he had performed some house\npainting and yard cleaning.\n               A jury convicted defendant of possession of a fictitious instrument (§ 476),\ncheck forgery (§ 470, subd. (a)), and second degree burglary (§§ 459 & 460, subd. (b)).\nThe court found true the additional allegations defendant had previously suffered three\nserious or violent convictions, two for residential burglary and one for assault with a\ndeadly weapon. The court sentenced defendant to a term of 25 years to life. The\njudgment was affirmed on appeal. (People v. Sledge (Feb. 27, 2001, D036483) [nonpub.\nopn.] (Sledge I).)\n       1\n           All statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise indicated.\n\n\n                                              2\n\f                                2\n2. Defendant’s Prior Offenses\n              Apart from his commitment offenses, defendant has a lengthy criminal\nconviction history. Defendant first entered the criminal justice system in 1979, when he\nsuffered a misdemeanor juvenile adjudication for petty theft (§ 484, subd. (a)) after\nstealing a pair of pants from a store. He was 16 years old.\n              In 1980, when defendant was 17 years old, he suffered a felony juvenile\nadjudication for forcible rape (§ 261, subd. (a)(2)). The victim was a woman in whose\nhome defendant had been placed following the petty theft adjudication. She was\nawakened by defendant’s hand around her neck. He covered her mouth, pulled up her\ndress and forced intercourse upon her for two or three minutes.\n              In 1981, when defendant was 18 years old, he was convicted of residential\nburglary (§§ 459 & 460, subd. (a)). Defendant and two male accomplices entered an\noccupied residence around 10:30 p.m. Defendant planned to take stereo equipment, but\ninstead took a watch and a wallet and fled after the occupant woke up. He was sentenced\nto two years in the California Youth Authority (CYA).\n              In 1983, when defendant was still on parole for the 1981 offense, he was\nconvicted of receiving stolen property (§ 496). Defendant was stopped driving a vehicle\nwith two male passengers. A large quantity of stolen electronic equipment was stacked\non the back seat. He was sentenced to two years in prison.\n\n\n       2\n          Some of these facts are taken from the opinion in Sledge I, which is part of the\nrecord in this appeal. (People v. Osuna (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 1020, 1027, fn 2.)\nOthers are taken from the record in Sledge I, which is not part of the record in this appeal,\nbut is a part of defendant’s “criminal conviction history.” (§ 1170.126, subd. (f)(1).) We\nobtained a copy of the record in Sledge I, and took judicial notice of it on our own\nmotion. (Evid. Code §§ 452, subd. (d) & 459, subd. (a); People v. White (2014) 223\nCal.App.4th 512, 519, fn. 4.) We also gave the parties an opportunity to inspect the\nrecord in Sledge I, invited them to file supplemental briefs regarding its relevance, and\nconsidered their supplemental briefs in deciding this appeal.\n\n\n                                             3\n\f              In 1985, while still on parole for the 1983 offense, defendant pled no\ncontest to residential burglary (§§ 459 & 460, subd. (a)) and assault with a deadly\nweapon (§ 245, subd. (a)(1)), and he admitted personal use of a firearm (§ 12022.5).\nAccording to the arrest report, defendant entered the victim’s residence by prying iron\nbars from a rear window. When the victims came home and noticed the front door was\nunlocked, defendant opened the door, pointed a gun at them, and ordered them inside. As\nthey attempted to flee he fired one round over their heads and said he would blow their\nheads off. Defendant then pulled the victims inside, robbed them, and placed them in a\nbedroom closet which he nailed shut. Defendant was sentenced to eleven years in prison,\nwas paroled in 1990, and after he violated his parole in 1993 was returned to finish his\nterm.\n3. Defendant’s Record of Discipline and Rehabilitation While Incarcerated\n              Defendant has a record of minor rules violations in the Orange County jail.\nThese involved using newspaper and books to cover his cell vent, and possession of\ncontraband (extra issue and newspapers) in his cell.\n              Defendant also has a record of rules violations in state prison. Most were\nminor, such as delaying lock-up, covering a cell window, and possessing contraband.\nHowever, two were more serious and involved violent behavior. The first occurred in\n1999, when defendant was involved in a fight with another inmate. They appeared to be\nexchanging punches, but none of the punches made contact and neither sustained any\ninjuries. Defendant claimed he was defending himself. Even so, he was found guilty of\nengaging in behavior that could lead to violence, was forfeited 30 days of credits, and\nwas counseled and reprimanded.\n              The second occurred in 2006, when defendant participated in a prison riot\nbetween black and white inmates. Defendant claimed he was not involved in the riot.\nNevertheless, he was ultimately found guilty of participating and given a 90-day term in\nthe segregated housing unit.\n\n                                             4\n\f               On the other hand, defendant has a laudable record of education and self-\nimprovement while incarcerated. He has completed more than 70 religious courses,\nearned an associate arts degree, and completed 11 other educational/vocational courses,\nincluding vocational dry cleaning, stress management, language, arts, reading, writing,\nanger management, job acquisition, and an “Alternative to Violence Project.”\n               Defendant has finished 12 comprehensive sessions of the “Fathers of\nChildren United Stand” self-development program, which included topics like self-\ncontrol, overcoming fear, positive thinking, functions of leadership, importance of\neducation, self-motivation, critical thinking, and practical life skills. In addition,\ndefendant has completed the “Transcommunality and Peace Studies Class,” affiliated\nwith the “Barrios Unidos Prison Project of Santa Cruz, California.”\n               Defendant has been praised for being “an excellent student,” having “good\nwork/study habits,” and being “a pleasant individual.” Supervisors have commended his\nwork. He has been applauded for having an “exceptional” attitude toward supervisors\nand staff. He has participated in group activities, including playing softball and\nrefereeing tennis, and been admired for his sportsmanship and dedication to his team.\n               Defendant has also attempted to better those around him and become a\nleader to his peers. He has taken a course designed to reduce the spread of HIV\nthroughout his prison facility. He was elected by his peers to the position of “Black\nRepresentative for F-Wing” where he is “the spokesperson for the entire inmate\npopulation at this facility.”\n4. Defendant’s Mental Health and Substance Abuse History\n               Defendant has a well documented history of mental health problems, which\ndate back to his traumatic childhood. These problems have resulted in two suicide\nattempts during his incarceration. He tried to hang himself in 1999, and he cut his wrists\nwith a razor in 2000.\n\n\n\n                                               5\n\f              In 2002, during an annual unit classification committee review, defendant\nrequested single cell housing due to his psychiatric problems. The committee instructed\ndefendant to discuss the issue with his psychiatric practitioner.\n              In September 2005, during defendant’s annual unit classification committee\nreview, the committee noted the psychiatric interdisciplinary treatment team had\nprescribed defendant a single cell due to his mental health. The committee assigned him\nto a single cell for 60 days and referred him to psychiatric services.\n              In November 2005, the interdisciplinary treatment team recommended\nhousing defendant in a single cell as long as he is in the California’s Department of\nCorrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) system due to chronic mental health problems\nthat are quite resistant to treatment. The unit classification committee reviewed this\nrecommendation and assigned defendant to a single cell for mental health reasons, but\nonly through October 31, 2006.\n              In 2007, defendant declined to appear before the unit classification\ncommittee for his annual review. The committee decided defendant would retain single\ncell status based on the 2005 recommendation that he remain in a single cell as long as he\nis in the CDCR system. The committee also noted defendant had been referred to mental\nhealth for a reassessment of single cell status.\n              In August 2011, the mental health interdisciplinary treatment team\nrecommended that defendant remain in a single cell for 12 more months due to his mental\nhealth condition.\n              In January 2012, clinician and psychologist E.W. Hewchuck evaluated\ndefendant’s mental health suicide risk. He estimated defendant’s chronic risk moderate,\nand his acute risk low. Hewchuck reported all other mental health indicators were within\nnormal limits, but noted defendant was diagnosed with “Major Depressive Disorder,\nRecurrent, Severe With Psychotic Features.”\n\n\n\n                                              6\n\f              In December 2012, Hewchuck again evaluated defendant’s mental health.\nHewchuck estimated defendant’s chronic and acute suicide risk low and noted defendant\nwas then housed in general population. Other than moderate stress and depression and\nbeing unable to sleep due to back pain, all of defendant’s other mental health factors were\nwithin normal limits.\n              Defendant also has a well documented substance abuse history. He\nreportedly has been sporadically addicted to cocaine throughout his adult life, not using\nwhile incarcerated but quickly returning to it when released into the community.\n              Defendant’s addiction caused his wife to leave him in 1997, and he then\n“became a full time functional homeless person by choice, and a rock head never to go\naround my upstanding friends.” He had been homeless for approximately a year and was\naddicted to cocaine at the time of his arrest in this case. He also admitted cocaine use in\nconnection with his 1981 and 1985 convictions.\n              A letter from Dr. Charles Hinkin, Professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral\nSciences at UCLA, filed in support of defendant’s motion for reconsideration states if\ndefendant’s “drug use arose as an attempt to self-medicate his psychiatric problems, then\nthe successful resolution of his emotional problems removes the reason why he started\nabusing drugs in the first place. This suggests that he will be less likely to return to drug\nuse should he be released from prison.”\n              Hinkin also notes, “The fact that he has 15 years of sobriety under his belt\nis of tremendous prognostic favorability. But there is no guarantee. That said, . . . as he\ngets older the severity of his drug use will decline and the chances that any continuing\ndrug use would result in criminal behavior would concomitantly decrease. . . . The steps\nhe has taken to address his emotional problems and to better himself while in prison,\ncoupled with the epidemiological facts, . . . all converge on the conclusion that [he] has a\nfavorable prognosis for avoiding relapse.”\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\f5. Defendant’s Petition and the People’s Response\n               In February 2013, defendant filed his petition for recall of sentence in\npropria persona. It included a declaration in which he acknowledged his drug problem\ncontributed to his criminal behavior, and expressed regret that his inability to tackle his\nproblems led to a life sentence.\n               Defendant also declared “I deeply am sorry and regret all the hardship and\npain I’ve caused my family, my past and current victims.” And, defendant expressed\ndisappointment with the criminal justice system and regret “that he wasn’t given a full\nand fair opportunity to compel to the courts how he do [sic] not fall within the spirit of\nCalif. 3-Strikes law . . . .”\n               The petition was supported by voluminous exhibits, including the following\nrecords in this case: the complaint and the information; the jury verdict forms; the\ntranscript of the original sentencing hearing; the original and amended abstracts of\njudgment; the unpublished opinion in Sledge I; and records of defendant’s education and\nself-improvement activities while incarcerated.\n               In May 2013, defendant’s appellate counsel filed a separate “motion in\nsupport of resentencing pursuant to . . . section 1170.126,” which included some of\n                                                         3\ndefendant’s mental health records while incarcerated.\n               The district attorney filed a brief in opposition to the petition. It was\nsupported by the presentence and supplemental presentence reports prepared by the\nOrange County Probation Department in connection with the original sentencing in this\ncase; defendant’s “rap” sheet as of 2013; and more of defendant’s mental health records\nwhile incarcerated.\n\n\n       3\n         In January 2014, we granted defendant’s motion for an order augmenting the\nrecord on appeal, and defendant’s appellate counsel filed an augmented clerk’s transcript\nconsisting of 223 pages of CDCR records, all of which had been produced and\nconsidered by the court in ruling on the petition.\n\n                                               8\n\f6. The Hearing on Defendant’s Petition and the Court’s Ruling\n               Pursuant to section 1170.126, subdivision (b), the petition was assigned to\nthe same judge who presided over the trial in this case, who heard the evidence of and\nfound true the prior conviction allegations, and who imposed the life sentence defendant\nnow seeks to reduce.\n               At the outset of the hearing in June 2013, the court identified all of the\npleadings, records, and other materials it had reviewed and considered, and indicated\npreliminarily it would find defendant eligible for resentencing under section 1170.126,\nsubdivision (e).\n               Both sides then argued their respective positions at length. Neither side\ndisputed the court’s preliminary indication it would find defendant eligible for\nresentencing. In fact, the district attorney actually agreed defendant was “technically\neligible for resentencing . . . if the court would to [sic] find that he doesn’t pose a\nsubstantial risk to public safety . . . .”\n               After the matter was submitted, the court denied the petition from the\nbench, finding defendant was eligible to apply for resentencing but posed an\n                                               4\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety. On the record the court then gave a\ndetailed explanation of the factual and legal basis for its ruling.\n               Later that day, the court issued a written minute order setting forth\nsubstantially the same detailed explanation, which reads in full as follows:\n\n\n\n       4\n          We requested supplemental briefing on the question of whether defendant’s\nforcible rape juvenile adjudication is a “sexually violent offense” which renders him\nineligible for resentencing as a matter of law under section 1170.126, subdivision (e)(3).\n(See §§ 667, subd. (e)(2)(C)(iv)(I) & 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(C)(iv)(I); and Welf. & Inst.\nCode, § 6600, subd. (b).) Not surprisingly, the parties take opposite positions on this\nquestion. We elect to express no opinion on it, and instead resolve this appeal based only\nthe issues actually contested by the parties and decided by the court below.\n\n\n                                               9\n\f              “On February 15, 2013, [defendant] filed a Petition for Recall of Sentence\n(Resentencing) pursuant to . . . section 1170.126(e). The Court has determined that he is\nstatutorily eligible for resentencing relief, due to the nature of this third strike offense.\n[Defendant’s] third strike offense was Uttering a Fictitious Check; Check Forgery and\nFirst Degree Commercial Burglary, in violation of . . . Sections 476, 270(a) and 459-\n460(b), respectively. [Defendant’s] strike priors at the time consisted of two First Degree\nBurglary [sic] and an Assault with a Deadly Weapon (Firearm). At the Qualification\nHearing held today, the Court considered the Petition for Recall of Sentence, with\nattachments; the Motion in Support of Resentencing with attachments, and also the\nDistrict Attorney’s Brief re: Sentence Modification. Pursuant to . . . Section 1170.126,\nwith attachments. The Court has also reviewed the CDCR packet subpoenaed to court\nand consisting of over 200 pages; the mental health evaluations provided by the Public\nDefender (Motion), the Presentence Report and Supplemental Presentence Report from\nthe original sentencing, and the Transcript of the original sentencing, all of which\nincluding [sic] evidence of [defendant’s] prospects if released, his criminal history and\nrecord while I [sic] prison.\n              “After reviewing all of the material referenced above and in consideration\nof the criteria set forth in . . . section 1170.126(f)(g), the Court concludes that\nresentencing of this [defendant] would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety.\n              “There is a brazenness to [defendant’s] criminal history that evidences a\nlack of control over criminal impulses. The violent juvenile conduct including rape; the\nforcible entry into private residences, the shooting at the heads of fleeing victims and the\nwalking into a bank with a forged check and trying to pull it off with a straight face, all\ndemonstrated a certain hubris and lack of concern for serious, traumatic, if not deadly\nconsequences. Even [defendant’s] check-passing victim was particularly violated and\nfearful by the act.\n\n                                               10\n\f              “In prison [defendant] has been involved in violence of a different sort. His\ntwo suicide attempts in 1999 and 2000, by hanging and cutting have evidenced a\ncontinuing penchant for the ultimate act of violence, trying to do violence to himself.\nThen, there are the two documented instances of hand-to-hand violence with other\ninmates, once in a riot condition and the other in a two-man battle. The Court does not\ngive[] as great of weight to the 2006 riot, understanding that such a circumstance could\nhave, by its very nature, drawn [defendant] into combat of a defensive nature. Also,\nunlike [defendant’s] past acts, there is no evidence of cunning or planning involved on\nhis part. There is also the fact that through many mental health evaluations, [defendant]\nhas been classified for a ‘single cell’ due to his ‘psychiatric problems.’ This was the case\nin 2005 and it was recently confirmed in 2011 for the following year. A [sic] stated in\nthe report, this was necessary ‘due to the chronic mental health problem [sic] that is quite\nresistant to treatment.’\n              “Heavy use of multiple types of drugs was what contributed to some of\n[defendant’s] criminal activity while on release. The use of such drugs has been\nconnected in some of the CDCR evaluation reports to the need to mask depression and\nanxiety for which the [defendant] has been diagnosed. At the time of sentencing in this\ncase, [defendant] had served two prior State Prison terms and a commitment to the\n[CYA]. For this reason, [defendant’s] track record while free, is quite limited, providing\nlittle support for the notion that he will be drug-free and thus, crime-free on release.\nExacerbating the risk factor is that the period immediately after release, will be parole-\nfree.\n              “As a further indicator of risk, the records reviewed by the Court do not\nreveal any instance where the [defendant] has acknowledged responsibility for his\ncriminal acts, including the ones that had a direct impact on crime victims. Thus, a\npossible indicator of rehabilitation and good prospects on release is not present in this\ncase.\n\n                                             11\n\f              “The Court has considered [defendant’s] academic and personal\naccomplishments in prison as indicated by the documentation provided in the Motion.\nThis shows [defendant] has taken advantage of opportunities for college credits and\npersonal improvements, including participation in anger management type programs.\nHowever, this is not enough to overcome the factors recited above.”\n7. Defendant’s Motion for Reconsideration and Notice of Appeal\n              In July 2013, defendant filed a motion for reconsideration of the denial of\nhis petition, supported by two expert declarations. The first declaration was from Daniel\nVasquez, a corrections expert with over 30 years of experience in the CDCR. Based\nupon his review of the CDCR records considered by the court, Vasquez opined that\ndefendant has “aged out” of his drug addiction and does not pose a danger to the\ncommunity if released. The second declaration was from Hinkin and, as noted above, he\nopined defendant has a favorable prognosis for avoiding relapse.\n              The district attorney filed opposition.\n              After a hearing in August 2013, the court denied defendant’s motion for\nreconsideration. The court explained:\n              “[Defendant], his case presented significant concerning features that I\noutlined in my order, some of which, frankly, weren’t even cited by the district attorney’s\noffice. We all have our own views of human nature and public safety, and we all have\nour own life experiences. And the court has to, at this point, use its own experience as\nwell as the information you all have given to sum up the situation on behalf of the public\nand determine whether the standard has been met relative to unreasonable risk to public\nsafety.\n              “My concern with respect to [defendant] is there are indicators that he has\nlived a very insular and protected life in custody; the consistent status of being essentially\ndeemed to be in such a psychiatric condition that he needs to be isolated from people is\nsomething that is not available once he is released.\n\n                                             12\n\f              “As to the mental illness issue, I do want to assure counsel that this court\nhas dealt with that issue in this context before. I have ordered second strike sentencing\non people who have significant mental illness issues. It’s been a hiccup in the process,\nbut it has not been, in my view, a factor that would cause somebody to be denied release\nif all other factors were in place. Quite frankly, as we all know, if you are not mentally ill\nwhen you go in, the process of long-term incarceration with no prospect of release can\ncause certain mental illness features to surface. So it’s just not uncommon to see people\nwith mental illness in this condition.\n              “A couple of comments. The material presented by Dr. Hinkin relative to\nmental illness and drug issues. I understand the issues. I don’t see anything the court\nwouldn’t have already considered.\n              “With respect to Mr. Vasquez - assuming this is some kind of request that\nwe convene a hearing for evidentiary purposes or the court recive this for evidentiary\npurposes - I think Mr. Vasquez’s declaration, as opposed to Dr. Hinkin’s, probably\nencroaches upon the court’s role. I think the law is clear that the court must evaluate all\nof the factors that he has evaluated here. So I’m not sure an expert would be called for at\na sentencing hearing when we are talking about evaluating somebody’s correctional\nprogress.\n              “That having been said, I didn’t see anything in his analysis that would\nchange the court’s opinion. And so I’ll just defer the issue of whether the court would\nhave stricken his ultimate opinion as inappropriate in a sentencing proceeding, because\nlike I said, I didn’t see anything that would have caused the court to revisit or think that I\nhave missed something in the first instance. So the court’s tentative would be to\nrespectfully deny the motion for reconsideration on this grounds. Let me turn to the\nPeople, if you have any follow-up comments.”\n              Thereafter, defendant filed timely notices of appeal from both the denial of\nhis petition and the denial of his motion for reconsideration.\n\n                                              13\n\f         THE BURDEN OF PROOF AND THE STANDARD OF REVIEW\n              Under the Reform Act, if the petitioner is statutorily eligible for relief, “the\npetitioner shall be resentenced . . . unless the court, in its discretion, determines that\nresentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.”\n(§ 1170.126, subd. (f).) The prosecution has the burden of proving defendant’s\ndangerousness by a preponderance of the evidence. (People v. Superior Court (Kaulick)\n(2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 1279, 1301-1305 (Kaulick).)\n              “In exercising its discretion in subdivision (f), [of section 1170.126] the\ncourt may consider: [¶] (1) The petitioner’s criminal conviction history, including the\ntype of crimes committed, the extent of injury to victims, the length of prior prison\ncommitments, and the remoteness of the crimes; [¶] (2) The petitioner’s disciplinary\nrecord and record of rehabilitation while incarcerated; and [¶] (3) Any other evidence the\ncourt, within its discretion, determines to be relevant in deciding whether a new sentence\nwould result in an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.” (§ 1170.126, subd. (g).)\n              There is a dispute between the parties about the applicable standard of\nreview. Defendant contends we review the court’s dangerousness determination for\nabuse of discretion, citing Kaulick. But Kaulick did not say that. The Attorney General\nargues the court’s dangerousness determination need only be supported by “some\nevidence,” also citing Kaulick. But Kaulick did not say that either.\n              What the Court of Appeal in Kaulick did say is: “A trial court’s decision to\nrefuse to resentence a prisoner, based on a finding of dangerousness, is somewhat akin to\na decision denying an inmate parole. Such a [parole] decision need only be supported by\n‘some evidence’ . . . . This does not mean that an inmate is otherwise eligible for release\n[under section 1170.126] but that release can be denied on a finding supported only by\n‘some evidence.’ It simply means that the inmate remains subject to his initial sentence\nunless certain findings are made; these findings need not be established beyond a\nreasonable doubt.” (Kaulick, supra, 215 Cal.App.4th at p. 1306, fn. 29.)\n\n                                               14\n\f              Several cases decided since Kaulick have now clarified that when a court\ndenies relief under section 1170.126 because reducing a petitioner’s sentence entails an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety, that discretionary determination is reviewed\nunder the familiar abuse of discretion standard. (See, e.g., People v. Davis (2015) 234\nCal.App.4th 1001 (Davis.) Using this standard, we consider whether the ruling, “exceeds\nthe bounds of reason or is arbitrary, whimsical or capricious. [Citations.] This standard\ninvolves abundant deference to the trial court’s rulings.” (People v. Jackson (2005) 128\nCal.App.4th 1009, 1018.)\n              Finally, the factual findings upon which a court’s unreasonable risk\ndetermination is based are themselves subject to review under the equally familiar\nsubstantial evidence standard. Thus, we review the entire record in the light most\nfavorable to the court’s factual findings to determine whether it discloses evidence that is\nreasonable, credible, and of solid value such that a reasonable trier of fact could make\nthose factual findings by a preponderance of the evidence. (Cf. People v. Bolin (1998) 18\nCal.4th 297, 331.) But if the factual findings are not supported by substantial evidence,\nthey cannot form the basis for an unreasonable risk determination. (See People v. Cluff\n(2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 991, 998 [court abuses discretion when factual findings critical to\ndecision find no support in evidence].)\n                                      DISCUSSION\n              Defendant claims the court’s unreasonable risk of danger determination\nconstitutes an abuse of discretion, because the court: (1) improperly failed to consider his\nmost recent housing status; (2) erroneously found he used a firearm in committing the\ncrimes which resulted in the 1985 assault with a deadly weapon conviction; and (3)\nmistakenly found he never acknowledged responsibility for his crimes. Defendant also\nmaintains the court’s reliance on facts contrary to the record was prejudicial. We will\nconsider each of these contentions in turn.\n\n\n\n                                              15\n\f1. The Court Did Not Fail to Consider Defendant’s Most Recent Housing Status.\n              Defendant first contends the court failed to consider his most recent\nhousing status, did not make an informed decision, and improperly relied on stale\ninformation rather than current circumstances. We are not persuaded.\n              As noted, the court found: “There is also the fact that through many mental\nhealth evaluations, [defendant] has been classified for a ‘single cell’ due to his . . .\n‘chronic mental health problem that is quite resistant to treatment.’” But nothing in the\nrecord suggests the court was unaware of or ignored the fact that defendant’s single cell\nstatus ended some time in 2012. In fact, the opposite is true. The court reviewed all of\nthe mental health records which contain multiple references to defendant’s housing status\nthroughout his incarceration.\n              Furthermore, defendant mischaracterizes the court’s comments on\ndefendant’s single cell housing status. The import of those comments was not that\ndefendant was then housed in a single cell. Rather, the significance was that for\nsubstantial periods during his incarceration, defendant’s mental health problems had\nnecessitated housing him in a single cell. As the court explained:\n              “My concern with respect to [defendant] is there are indicators that he has\nlived a very insular and protected life in custody; the consistent status of being essentially\ndeemed to be in such a psychiatric condition that he needs to be isolated from people is\nsomething that is not available once he is released.”\n              In short, the court found it had been necessary to house defendant in a\nsingle cell at various times due to his mental health, and determined that fact was\n“relevant in deciding whether a new sentence would result in an unreasonable risk of\ndanger to public safety.” (§ 1170.126, subd. (g)(3).) This factual finding is supported by\nsubstantial evidence in the record, and this discretionary determination did not exceed the\nbounds of reason, nor was it arbitrary, whimsical or capricious. Accordingly, the court\ndid not abuse its discretion in this regard.\n\n                                               16\n\f2. The Court Did Not Erroneously Find Defendant Used a Firearm in Connection With\nthe Crimes Which Resulted in His 1985 Assault with a Deadly Weapon Conviction.\n              Defendant next contends the court erred by considering his use of a firearm\nin connection with the crimes which resulted in his 1985 assault with a deadly weapon\nand residential burglary convictions, and by finding the 1985 assault with a deadly\nweapon conviction to be a firearm related offense. We do not agree.\n              Preliminarily we note, all of these arguments are predicated upon\ndefendant’s factual assertion there is no evidence in the record that he used a firearm in\ncommitting these crimes, other than the statements of the victims in the 1985 arrest report\nas summarized in the 1999 presentence report. Defendant is wrong.\n              During the 1999 trial in this case, a “prior” packet, consisting of the Los\nAngeles Superior Court records of defendant’s 1985 convictions, was marked and\nintroduced into evidence as exhibit 6 (Exhibit 6). At that time the court considered\nExhibit 6 and said, “I’m just reviewing the portion on the use of weapon.” A minute\nlater, the court stated, “as to the second of the three pled priors [assault with a deadly\nweapon], there was actual personal use of gun.” (Italics added.)\n              Exhibit 6 also included a reporter’s transcript of the change of plea hearing\nin the 1985 case, which reflects the following colloquy:\n              “[DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY] MS. COLEMAN: To the charges\nset forth in Information number A 702862 in Count II, a violation of 245, Penal Code\nSection 245, subdivision (a), subdivision (l), assault with a deadly weapon with the use of\na firearm, [and] Count V, a violation of Penal Code Section 459 in the first degree,\nresidential burglary, how do you now plead?\n              “THE DEFENDANT: No contest.\n              “[¶] . . . [¶]\n              “THE COURT: How about the enhancements?\n              “MS. COLEMAN: All right.\n\n                                              17\n\f              “Mr. Sledge you’re pleading no contest to the personal use of a firearm, am\nI correct, under . . . Section 12022.5?\n              “THE DEFENDANT: Yes.\n              “MS. COLEMAN: As relates to Count II?\n              “THE DEFENDANT: Yes.”\n              Therefore, even ignoring the statements summarized in the presentence\nreport, there is substantial evidence in the record to support the finding that defendant\npersonally used a firearm in committing the 1985 assault with a deadly weapon.\n              Lastly, defendant asserts the evidence admitted during the 1999 trial,\nincluding Exhibit 6, cannot be considered because it was “not before the trial court,” and\n“[i]t was the prosecution’s burden to submit whatever evidence it chose in opposing\n[defendant’s] motion.” Nonsense. All of the evidence admitted during the 1999 trial was\nbefore the court that heard it, and the district attorney was not required to resubmit or\nrefer to it before the court could rely on it. To hold otherwise would be to require the\ncourt to ignore the evidence it previously heard, and to deprive the court of its discretion\nto consider evidence it “determines to be relevant.” (§ 1170.126, subd. (g)(3).)\n              A. The Court Was Not Limited To Considering Only Crimes and\nEnhancements for Which Defendant Was Actually Convicted.\n              Defendant argues the court was not authorized to consider crimes and\nenhancements which defendant was charged with but not convicted of, so the court\nabused its discretion by considering portions of the 1999 presentence report filed in this\ncase. Specifically, he objects to the court’s consideration of portions of the presentence\nreport which: (a) summarized the 1985 arrest report stating defendant pointed a gun at\nthe victims and ordered them inside, and when they attempted to flee he fired one round\nover their heads and said he would blow their heads off; and (b) stated defendant was\narrested for residential robbery (former § 213.5).\n\n\n\n                                             18\n\f              We reject these arguments and objections for several reasons. As for the\nstatements attributed to the victims of the 1985 crimes, it is not clear the court relied on\nthe presentence report summary at all, rather than its own independent recollection of the\n1985 prior conviction evidence which was introduced as Exhibit 6 during the 1999 trial.\nIndeed, during the 1999 sentencing hearing in this case, the court noted, “the fact of the\nmatter is he . . . committed an aggravated home invasion style, shooting guns, take-over\nrobbery of the most aggravated nature.” (Italics added.)\n              But even if the court did rely on the presentence report summary rather than\nits own independent recollection in denying the petition, the court had previously relied\non that same summary without objection at the 1999 sentencing hearing. So any\nobjection to the court’s reliance on that summary has long since been waived.\n              As for the presentence report statement that defendant was arrested in 1985\nfor residential robbery, again it is not clear the court actually relied on it. At any rate, the\n                                                                                            5\nstatement is true. The record indicates defendant was arrested for residential robbery.\n              Defendant next argues the court was not permitted to consider charged\noffenses, as distinguished from convictions, because section 1170.126, subdivision (g)(1)\nauthorizes a court to consider the petitioner’s criminal conviction history, including the\ntype of crimes committed, the extent of injury to victims, etc., but says nothing about\ncharged offenses. He then invokes the maxim inclusio unius est exclusio alterius, and\nconcludes consideration of charged offenses must have been intentionally excluded.\n\n\n\n       5\n          According to Exhibit 6, in 1985 defendant was charged with: (1) residential\nrobbery (former § 213.5) with personal use of a firearm (§§ 12022.5 & 1203.06, subd.\n(a)(1)); (2) assault with a deadly weapon (§ 245, subd. (a)(1)) with personal use of a\nfirearm (§ 12022.5); (3) residential burglary (§§ 459 & 460, subd. (a)) with personal use\nof a firearm (§§ 12022.5 & 1203.06, subd. (a)(1)); (4) assault with intent to commit\nforcible rape (§§ 220 & 261, subd. (2)); (5) residential burglary (§§ 459 & 460, subd.\n(a)); and (6) assault with a deadly weapon (§ 245, subd. (a)(1)) with personal use of a\nfirearm (§ 12022.5).\n\n                                               19\n\f              We doubt any exclusion was intentional. Regardless, once more the court\nis authorized to consider any evidence which “the court, within its discretion, determines\nto be relevant in deciding whether a new sentence would result in an unreasonable risk of\ndanger to public safety.” (§ 1170.126, subd. (g)(3).) That language is certainly broad\n                                                                     6\nenough to encompass the charges which led to the 1985 convictions.\n              Under these circumstances, substantial evidence supports the court’s\nfinding the offenses charged in 1985 included residential robbery, and the court did not\nabuse its discretion by determining those charged offenses were relevant in deciding\nwhether a new sentence would result in an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.\n              B. The Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion By Considering Statements in\nthe Presentence Report Made By Persons Other Than Defendant.\n              Defendant also maintains the court abused its discretion, by considering the\nstatements of the victims in the 1985 arrest report which were summarized in the 1999\npresentence report, thereby violating his Sixth Amendment rights. Here he relies on\nPeople v. Williams (1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 911, 917-918 (Williams).\n              Williams is inapposite because it concerned the use of hearsay statements in\nthe context of determining beyond a reasonable doubt whether a prior conviction\nallegation was true for sentence enhancement purposes under the Three Strikes law.\n(Williams, supra, 222 Cal.App.3d at pp. 917-918.) However, the court here was not\ndetermining whether to enhance defendant’s sentence. Instead, defendant had already\nreceived the maximum sentence and petitioned for a grant of lenity. “Any facts found at\nsuch a proceeding, such as dangerousness, do not implicate Sixth Amendment issues.”\n(Kaulick, supra, 215 Cal.App.4th at p. 1305.)\n\n       6\n         According to Exhibit 6, in 1985 defendant pled no contest to the assault with a\ndeadly weapon and the residential burglary, and defendant admitted the gun use\nallegation; and in return, the prosecution dismissed all of the other charged offenses,\nincluding the residential robbery. The convictions and the dismissed offenses all arose\nout of the same conduct on the same dates, December 31, 1984, and January 3, 1985.\n\n                                            20\n\f              Williams is also factually distinguishable. In Williams, the court relied\nsolely on a multiple hearsay statement attributed to the victim in a probation report. The\nCourt of Appeal held, “Because the triple hearsay statement in the probation report was,\nas the court expressly acknowledged, the only evidence in the record tending to prove\npersonal use of a dangerous weapon, the enhancement finding is not supported by\nsubstantial evidence.” (Williams, supra, 222 Cal.App.3d at p. 918.)\n              In this case, the multiple hearsay statements of the 1985 victims are not the\nonly evidence in the record tending to prove the personal use of the firearm. As we have\nshown, even ignoring the victim’s statements, there is substantial evidence that defendant\npersonally used a firearm in committing the 1985 assault with a deadly weapon. Thus,\nWilliams does not apply, and the court did not abuse its discretion by determining those\nstatements were relevant in deciding whether a new sentence would result in an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety. (§ 1170.126, subd. (g)(1), (3).)\n              C. The Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion By Considering the Firearm\nRelated Statements, Even Though Defendant Denied Using a Firearm.\n              Defendant also avers the court abused its discretion by considering the\nstatements of the victims in the 1985 arrest report regarding defendant’s firearm use,\nbecause defendant denied using a firearm. This argument is based on the assertion “it is\nunknown whether [defendant] was even charged with a firearm use enhancement, and\nmore importantly, even if he was, he did not plead guilty to it.” We have already\ndemonstrated this assertion is simply untrue.\n              What is more, the factual basis for defendant’s 1985 no contest plea\nactually stated he “commit[ted] the crime of assault with a deadly weapon by shooting a\nrevolver at [the victims]” and counsel stipulated to the factual basis for the firearm\nenhancement. Once again the court did not abuse its discretion by determining this\nevidence was relevant in deciding whether defendant posed an unreasonable risk of\ndanger to public safety. (§ 1170.126, subd. (g)(1),(3).)\n\n                                             21\n\f              D. The Court Did Not Err By Finding Defendant’s 1985 Assault With a\nDeadly Weapon Conviction Was Firearm Related.\n              Defendant next professes the court abused its discretion by erroneously\nfinding he had been convicted of a firearm related offense. We disagree, as noted above.\nFurther, the Court of Appeal opinion in Sledge I found his 1985 convictions involved\n“the use of a gun.” (Sledge I, supra, D036483.) This finding is final and binding for all\npurposes in this case. (Vandenberg v. Superior Court (1999) 21 Cal.4th 815, 828-829.)\nThus, there was no error.\n3. The Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion By Finding the Record Did Not Reveal Any\nInstance Where Defendant Acknowledged His Responsibility for His Crimes.\n              Defendant claims the court abused its discretion by erroneously finding the\nrecord did not reveal any instance where he acknowledged responsibility for his criminal\nacts. He points to the court’s statement, “the records reviewed by the Court do not reveal\nany instance where [he] has acknowledged responsibility for his criminal acts, including\nthe ones that had a direct impact on crime victims.”\n              Defendant says the court was mistaken, because he acknowledged his\nresponsibility in the declaration he filed in support of the petition. He quotes parts of his\ndeclaration, which we set out more fully for context:\n              “Petitioner/I acknowledged [sic] that, prior to being arrested, that I had a\nsevere drug abuse problem and expected something more dramatically [sic] would have\nto occur in order for me to stop. Because I had already lost two careers, abandoned my\nfirst marriage with sons, then destroyed a second marriage, and resulted content [sic]\nbeing homeless.\n              “There is no doubt that I was screaming for help when I participated in this\ncriminal activity. And for all the wrong reasons caused me to be dishonest of how I came\nin possession of the forgery check, when telling the truth would probably have resulted in\nme being diverted to a drug treatment program.\n\n                                             22\n\f              “So, during the last 14 years in prison I have deeply regretted my past\ninability to tackle my problems, so receiving this 25-years to life in prison, I made a point\nto transform myself which the attached Exhibits would some what [sic] demonstrate my\ndiligent efforts and dedication for becoming a Born Again Christian.\n              “Hereford [sic], I deeply am sorry and regret all the hardship and pain I’ve\ncaused my family, my past and current victims. And upon the $1,000 Restitution\nimposed, I now only owe $200 dollars through prison jobs labor by only being paid no\nmore than 15 cents an hour from the very limited jobs assignment.\n              “However, I must express to this court how disappointed that I was unable\nto convince to the Judiciary System that various factual information (newly discovery)\nand retroactive laws compels [sic] I should only be/been suffering from one 1985 (count\n4) prior burglary strike contrarily [sic] to the three currently strikes. I ask this court to\nfirst note that my 1981 (CYA) burglary juvenile adjudication pursuant to Welf. Inst.\nCode 1731.5 (a). Which I should had [sic] gotten relief under People v. Garcia (1999) 21\nCal.4th 1 and allowed another Romero-Hearing (PC 1385).\n              “Conjunctively, this petitioner’s 1985 prior strikes (#2 and #3) were also\nunder a plea-agreement of a court’s ‘Consolidated Trial’ to been [sic] counted for only\none prosecuted case (one-strike case). Also, this second strike of PC 245 (a) (1), (count\n2) was deliberately stayed so I would not be harm [sic] by it being stipulated in the record\nbecause both it and its PC 12022.5 were being Stayed. No punishment was ever imposed\nat sentencing (the Sentencing Hearing severe [sic] contradict the Abstract of Judgment).\nPetitioner’s [sic] was lead into believing he was pleading to aiding and abetted\n(substantiating evidence existed to support this petitioner’s never processed or/and fired\nsuch gun).\n              “In addition, both these prior cases were plea-deals induced pursuant to PC\n667.5 (b) ‘5-Years Washout Period.’ That he’d fulfilled prior to any new laws to\nsupersede.”\n\n                                               23\n\f              Taken together, these statements hardly support defendant’s contention that\nhe “not only acknowledged responsibility for his criminal acts, he did so unequivocally.”\nInstead, it appears defendant blames all of his criminal acts on his drug problems, and he\nbelieves he has been wronged by the criminal justice system. Furthermore, it seems the\nonly thing defendant truly regrets is the life sentence he is now serving. Thus, the court’s\nruling is not contrary to the declaration.\n              Defendant also says the court’s finding he never acknowledged\nresponsibility for his criminal acts was based in part on a mistaken premise that he had\nbeen convicted of a firearm related offense. As discussed ante, there was no mistake.\nThe court found defendant had been convicted of a firearm-related offense in 1985, and\nthat finding is supported by substantial evidence.\n              Moreover, the court considered all the evidence in the record, including his\ndenials in the probation report as summarized at the sentencing hearing, and found\ndefendant never acknowledged responsibility for any of his convictions. This factual\nfinding is also supported by substantial evidence. We agree with the court, “it appears\nthere is a pattern of denial and completely different story as to the significant and very\nimportant criminal acts, including the shooting at a residence, the rape issue, and then the\ncurrent offense.”\n4. Even if the Court Did Rely on Facts Contrary to the Record, Defendant Was Not\nPrejudiced.\n              Finally, defendant contends the court’s alleged reliance on facts contrary to\nthe record was prejudicial. Once more, we do not agree. Even if the court erred as\ndefendant contends, the error was harmless because it is not reasonably probable he\nwould have achieved a more favorable result absent the error. (People v. Watson (1956)\n46 Cal.2d 818, 836.) Leaving aside the disputed evidence, the court articulated a number\nof other legitimate concerns about dangerousness, all of which are supported by\nsubstantial evidence in the record.\n\n                                             24\n\f              The court observed defendant has a violent criminal history, including two\nincidents of mutual combat while in prison. The court noted defendant’s “lack of control\nover criminal impulses” as evidenced by the “brazenness” of his criminal history.\nAdditionally, the court considered his two suicide attempts, his sustained pattern of heavy\ndrug use, and his “chronic mental health problem.” Plus, the court worried that upon\nrelease, he would be “parole free.”\n              These concerns alone support the court’s determination defendant poses an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety, and thus the court acted well within its\ndiscretion in denying his petition for resentencing. So it is not reasonably probable\ndefendant would have received a more favorable outcome even absent the alleged errors.\n5. Section 1170.18 Does Not Apply to Resentencing Under the Reform Act.\n              On November 4, 2014, after oral argument in this case, the voters of the\nState of California approved the Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Act (Proposition 47).\nAmong other things, Proposition 47 added section 1170.18, subdivision (c) (section\n1170.18(c)). Section 1170.18(c) provides: “(c) As used throughout this Code,\n‘unreasonable risk of danger to public safety’ means an unreasonable risk that the\npetitioner will commit a new violent felony within the meaning of clause (iv) of\nsubparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of Section 667.” (Italics added.)\n              As we have discussed at length throughout, the phrase “unreasonable risk\nof danger to public safety” is also used in section 1170.126, subdivision (f), and is central\nto the resolution of this appeal. Therefore, we ordered the parties to brief the question of\nwhether the section 1170.18(c) definition applies to this appeal. This question is\ncurrently pending before the California Supreme Court. (People v. Chaney (2014) 231\nCal.App.4th 1391, review granted February 18, 2015, S223676 [Does the definition of\n“unreasonable risk of danger to public safety” under section 1170.18(c) apply\nretroactively to resentencing under section 1170.126]; see also People v. Valencia (2014)\n232 Cal.App.4th 514, review granted February 18, 2015, S223825.)\n\n                                             25\n\f              Two other cases decided after Chaney and Valencia also addressed this\nquestion, and both declined to retroactively apply the section 1170.18(c) definition of\n“unreasonable risk of danger to public safety” to resentencing under section 1170.126.\n(Davis, supra, 234 Cal.App.4th at p. 1006; People v. Guzman (Apr. 2, 2015, G049135)\n__ Cal.App.4th __ [2015 Cal.App. Lexis 286] (Guzman)(maj. opn. of Fybel, J.)\n[definition under § 1170.18(c) does not apply to resentencing under § 1170.126] (conc.\nopn. of Aronson, J.) [definition under § 1170.18(c) does apply to resentencing under §\n1170.126, but not retroactively].) We agree with Davis and Guzman on this question.\nAnd we too conclude “that the five words ‘As used throughout this Code’ [citation] were\nnot intended by the voters to hamstring the Three Strikes Reform Act.” (Davis, supra,\n234 Cal.App.4th at p 1026.) Accordingly, we decline to apply the section 1170.18(c)\ndefinition of “unreasonable risk of danger to public safety” to this appeal.\n                                      DISPOSITION\n              The judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n\n                                                  THOMPSON, J.\n\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\n\nMOORE, ACTING P.

Code §§ 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12) to a term of 25 years\nto life in state prison for crimes he committed in 1998. After passage of the Three Strikes\nReform Act of 2012 (Reform Act), defendant filed a petition to recall that sentence and\nfor resentencing pursuant to section 1170.126.\n               The court, in its discretion, determined resentencing defendant would pose\nan unreasonable risk of danger to public safety, and therefore denied both the petition and\na subsequent motion for reconsideration. Defendant contends the court abused its\ndiscretion by erroneously failing to consider certain facts and by improperly considering\nother facts. We find no abuse of discretion and affirm.\n                        FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n1. Defendant’s Commitment Offenses\n               In 1998, defendant went into a bank and attempted to cash a check for\n$453.12 drawn on the account of Sara Delgadillo. Ms. Delgadillo had not signed the\ncheck or given defendant permission to cash it. The bank teller learned the checking\naccount had been flagged, and the branch manager called the police. Defendant told\npolice he had received the check from a man for whom he had performed some house\npainting and yard cleaning.\n               A jury convicted defendant of possession of a fictitious instrument (§ 476),\ncheck forgery (§ 470, subd. (a)), and second degree burglary (§§ 459 & 460, subd. (b)).\nThe court found true the additional allegations defendant had previously suffered three\nserious or violent convictions, two for residential burglary and one for assault with a\ndeadly weapon. The court sentenced defendant to a term of 25 years to life. The\njudgment was affirmed on appeal. (People v. Sledge (Feb. 27, 2001, D036483) [nonpub.\nopn.] (Sledge I).)\n       1\n           All statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise indicated.\n\n\n                                              2\n\f                                2\n2. Defendant’s Prior Offenses\n              Apart from his commitment offenses, defendant has a lengthy criminal\nconviction history. Defendant first entered the criminal justice system in 1979, when he\nsuffered a misdemeanor juvenile adjudication for petty theft (§ 484, subd. (a)) after\nstealing a pair of pants from a store. He was 16 years old.\n              In 1980, when defendant was 17 years old, he suffered a felony juvenile\nadjudication for forcible rape (§ 261, subd. (a)(2)). The victim was a woman in whose\nhome defendant had been placed following the petty theft adjudication. She was\nawakened by defendant’s hand around her neck. He covered her mouth, pulled up her\ndress and forced intercourse upon her for two or three minutes.\n              In 1981, when defendant was 18 years old, he was convicted of residential\nburglary (§§ 459 & 460, subd. (a)). Defendant and two male accomplices entered an\noccupied residence around 10:30 p.m. Defendant planned to take stereo equipment, but\ninstead took a watch and a wallet and fled after the occupant woke up. He was sentenced\nto two years in the California Youth Authority (CYA).\n              In 1983, when defendant was still on parole for the 1981 offense, he was\nconvicted of receiving stolen property (§ 496). Defendant was stopped driving a vehicle\nwith two male passengers. A large quantity of stolen electronic equipment was stacked\non the back seat. He was sentenced to two years in prison.\n\n\n       2\n          Some of these facts are taken from the opinion in Sledge I, which is part of the\nrecord in this appeal. (People v. Osuna (2014) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">225</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1020</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1027, fn 2.)\nOthers are taken from the record in Sledge I, which is not part of the record in this appeal,\nbut is a part of defendant’s “criminal conviction history.” (§ 1170.126, subd. (f)(1).) We\nobtained a copy of the record in Sledge I, and took judicial notice of it on our own\nmotion. (Evid. Code §§ 452, subd. (d) & 459, subd. (a); People v. White (2014) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">223</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">512</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 519, fn. 4.) We also gave the parties an opportunity to inspect the\nrecord in Sledge I, invited them to file supplemental briefs regarding its relevance, and\nconsidered their supplemental briefs in deciding this appeal.\n\n\n                                             3\n\f              In 1985, while still on parole for the 1983 offense, defendant pled no\ncontest to residential burglary (§§ 459 & 460, subd. (a)) and assault with a deadly\nweapon (§ 245, subd. (a)(1)), and he admitted personal use of a firearm (§ 12022.5).\nAccording to the arrest report, defendant entered the victim’s residence by prying iron\nbars from a rear window. When the victims came home and noticed the front door was\nunlocked, defendant opened the door, pointed a gun at them, and ordered them inside. As\nthey attempted to flee he fired one round over their heads and said he would blow their\nheads off. Defendant then pulled the victims inside, robbed them, and placed them in a\nbedroom closet which he nailed shut. Defendant was sentenced to eleven years in prison,\nwas paroled in 1990, and after he violated his parole in 1993 was returned to finish his\nterm.\n3. Defendant’s Record of Discipline and Rehabilitation While Incarcerated\n              Defendant has a record of minor rules violations in the Orange County jail.\nThese involved using newspaper and books to cover his cell vent, and possession of\ncontraband (extra issue and newspapers) in his cell.\n              Defendant also has a record of rules violations in state prison. Most were\nminor, such as delaying lock-up, covering a cell window, and possessing contraband.\nHowever, two were more serious and involved violent behavior. The first occurred in\n1999, when defendant was involved in a fight with another inmate. They appeared to be\nexchanging punches, but none of the punches made contact and neither sustained any\ninjuries. Defendant claimed he was defending himself. Even so, he was found guilty of\nengaging in behavior that could lead to violence, was forfeited 30 days of credits, and\nwas counseled and reprimanded.\n              The second occurred in 2006, when defendant participated in a prison riot\nbetween black and white inmates. Defendant claimed he was not involved in the riot.\nNevertheless, he was ultimately found guilty of participating and given a 90-day term in\nthe segregated housing unit.\n\n                                             4\n\f               On the other hand, defendant has a laudable record of education and self-\nimprovement while incarcerated. He has completed more than 70 religious courses,\nearned an associate arts degree, and completed 11 other educational/vocational courses,\nincluding vocational dry cleaning, stress management, language, arts, reading, writing,\nanger management, job acquisition, and an “Alternative to Violence Project.”\n               Defendant has finished 12 comprehensive sessions of the “Fathers of\nChildren United Stand” self-development program, which included topics like self-\ncontrol, overcoming fear, positive thinking, functions of leadership, importance of\neducation, self-motivation, critical thinking, and practical life skills. In addition,\ndefendant has completed the “Transcommunality and Peace Studies Class,” affiliated\nwith the “Barrios Unidos Prison Project of Santa Cruz, California.”\n               Defendant has been praised for being “an excellent student,” having “good\nwork/study habits,” and being “a pleasant individual.” Supervisors have commended his\nwork. He has been applauded for having an “exceptional” attitude toward supervisors\nand staff. He has participated in group activities, including playing softball and\nrefereeing tennis, and been admired for his sportsmanship and dedication to his team.\n               Defendant has also attempted to better those around him and become a\nleader to his peers. He has taken a course designed to reduce the spread of HIV\nthroughout his prison facility. He was elected by his peers to the position of “Black\nRepresentative for F-Wing” where he is “the spokesperson for the entire inmate\npopulation at this facility.”\n4. Defendant’s Mental Health and Substance Abuse History\n               Defendant has a well documented history of mental health problems, which\ndate back to his traumatic childhood. These problems have resulted in two suicide\nattempts during his incarceration. He tried to hang himself in 1999, and he cut his wrists\nwith a razor in 2000.\n\n\n\n                                               5\n\f              In 2002, during an annual unit classification committee review, defendant\nrequested single cell housing due to his psychiatric problems. The committee instructed\ndefendant to discuss the issue with his psychiatric practitioner.\n              In September 2005, during defendant’s annual unit classification committee\nreview, the committee noted the psychiatric interdisciplinary treatment team had\nprescribed defendant a single cell due to his mental health. The committee assigned him\nto a single cell for 60 days and referred him to psychiatric services.\n              In November 2005, the interdisciplinary treatment team recommended\nhousing defendant in a single cell as long as he is in the California’s Department of\nCorrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) system due to chronic mental health problems\nthat are quite resistant to treatment. The unit classification committee reviewed this\nrecommendation and assigned defendant to a single cell for mental health reasons, but\nonly through October 31, 2006.\n              In 2007, defendant declined to appear before the unit classification\ncommittee for his annual review. The committee decided defendant would retain single\ncell status based on the 2005 recommendation that he remain in a single cell as long as he\nis in the CDCR system. The committee also noted defendant had been referred to mental\nhealth for a reassessment of single cell status.\n              In August 2011, the mental health interdisciplinary treatment team\nrecommended that defendant remain in a single cell for 12 more months due to his mental\nhealth condition.\n              In January 2012, clinician and psychologist E.W. Hewchuck evaluated\ndefendant’s mental health suicide risk. He estimated defendant’s chronic risk moderate,\nand his acute risk low. Hewchuck reported all other mental health indicators were within\nnormal limits, but noted defendant was diagnosed with “Major Depressive Disorder,\nRecurrent, Severe With Psychotic Features.”\n\n\n\n                                              6\n\f              In December 2012, Hewchuck again evaluated defendant’s mental health.\nHewchuck estimated defendant’s chronic and acute suicide risk low and noted defendant\nwas then housed in general population. Other than moderate stress and depression and\nbeing unable to sleep due to back pain, all of defendant’s other mental health factors were\nwithin normal limits.\n              Defendant also has a well documented substance abuse history. He\nreportedly has been sporadically addicted to cocaine throughout his adult life, not using\nwhile incarcerated but quickly returning to it when released into the community.\n              Defendant’s addiction caused his wife to leave him in 1997, and he then\n“became a full time functional homeless person by choice, and a rock head never to go\naround my upstanding friends.” He had been homeless for approximately a year and was\naddicted to cocaine at the time of his arrest in this case. He also admitted cocaine use in\nconnection with his 1981 and 1985 convictions.\n              A letter from Dr. Charles Hinkin, Professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral\nSciences at UCLA, filed in support of defendant’s motion for reconsideration states if\ndefendant’s “drug use arose as an attempt to self-medicate his psychiatric problems, then\nthe successful resolution of his emotional problems removes the reason why he started\nabusing drugs in the first place. This suggests that he will be less likely to return to drug\nuse should he be released from prison.”\n              Hinkin also notes, “The fact that he has 15 years of sobriety under his belt\nis of tremendous prognostic favorability. But there is no guarantee. That said, . . . as he\ngets older the severity of his drug use will decline and the chances that any continuing\ndrug use would result in criminal behavior would concomitantly decrease. . . . The steps\nhe has taken to address his emotional problems and to better himself while in prison,\ncoupled with the epidemiological facts, . . . all converge on the conclusion that [he] has a\nfavorable prognosis for avoiding relapse.”\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\f5. Defendant’s Petition and the People’s Response\n               In February 2013, defendant filed his petition for recall of sentence in\npropria persona. It included a declaration in which he acknowledged his drug problem\ncontributed to his criminal behavior, and expressed regret that his inability to tackle his\nproblems led to a life sentence.\n               Defendant also declared “I deeply am sorry and regret all the hardship and\npain I’ve caused my family, my past and current victims.” And, defendant expressed\ndisappointment with the criminal justice system and regret “that he wasn’t given a full\nand fair opportunity to compel to the courts how he do [sic] not fall within the spirit of\nCalif. 3-Strikes law . . . .”\n               The petition was supported by voluminous exhibits, including the following\nrecords in this case: the complaint and the information; the jury verdict forms; the\ntranscript of the original sentencing hearing; the original and amended abstracts of\njudgment; the unpublished opinion in Sledge I; and records of defendant’s education and\nself-improvement activities while incarcerated.\n               In May 2013, defendant’s appellate counsel filed a separate “motion in\nsupport of resentencing pursuant to . . . section 1170.126,” which included some of\n                                                         3\ndefendant’s mental health records while incarcerated.\n               The district attorney filed a brief in opposition to the petition. It was\nsupported by the presentence and supplemental presentence reports prepared by the\nOrange County Probation Department in connection with the original sentencing in this\ncase; defendant’s “rap” sheet as of 2013; and more of defendant’s mental health records\nwhile incarcerated.\n\n\n       3\n         In January 2014, we granted defendant’s motion for an order augmenting the\nrecord on appeal, and defendant’s appellate counsel filed an augmented clerk’s transcript\nconsisting of 223 pages of CDCR records, all of which had been produced and\nconsidered by the court in ruling on the petition.\n\n                                               8\n\f6. The Hearing on Defendant’s Petition and the Court’s Ruling\n               Pursuant to section 1170.126, subdivision (b), the petition was assigned to\nthe same judge who presided over the trial in this case, who heard the evidence of and\nfound true the prior conviction allegations, and who imposed the life sentence defendant\nnow seeks to reduce.\n               At the outset of the hearing in June 2013, the court identified all of the\npleadings, records, and other materials it had reviewed and considered, and indicated\npreliminarily it would find defendant eligible for resentencing under section 1170.126,\nsubdivision (e).\n               Both sides then argued their respective positions at length. Neither side\ndisputed the court’s preliminary indication it would find defendant eligible for\nresentencing. In fact, the district attorney actually agreed defendant was “technically\neligible for resentencing . . . if the court would to [sic] find that he doesn’t pose a\nsubstantial risk to public safety . . . .”\n               After the matter was submitted, the court denied the petition from the\nbench, finding defendant was eligible to apply for resentencing but posed an\n                                               4\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety. On the record the court then gave a\ndetailed explanation of the factual and legal basis for its ruling.\n               Later that day, the court issued a written minute order setting forth\nsubstantially the same detailed explanation, which reads in full as follows:\n\n\n\n       4\n          We requested supplemental briefing on the question of whether defendant’s\nforcible rape juvenile adjudication is a “sexually violent offense” which renders him\nineligible for resentencing as a matter of law under section 1170.126, subdivision (e)(3).\n(See §§ 667, subd. (e)(2)(C)(iv)(I) & 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(C)(iv)(I); and Welf. & Inst.\nCode, § 6600, subd. (b).) Not surprisingly, the parties take opposite positions on this\nquestion. We elect to express no opinion on it, and instead resolve this appeal based only\nthe issues actually contested by the parties and decided by the court below.\n\n\n                                               9\n\f              “On February 15, 2013, [defendant] filed a Petition for Recall of Sentence\n(Resentencing) pursuant to . . . section 1170.126(e). The Court has determined that he is\nstatutorily eligible for resentencing relief, due to the nature of this third strike offense.\n[Defendant’s] third strike offense was Uttering a Fictitious Check; Check Forgery and\nFirst Degree Commercial Burglary, in violation of . . . Sections 476, 270(a) and 459-\n460(b), respectively. [Defendant’s] strike priors at the time consisted of two First Degree\nBurglary [sic] and an Assault with a Deadly Weapon (Firearm). At the Qualification\nHearing held today, the Court considered the Petition for Recall of Sentence, with\nattachments; the Motion in Support of Resentencing with attachments, and also the\nDistrict Attorney’s Brief re: Sentence Modification. Pursuant to . . . Section 1170.126,\nwith attachments. The Court has also reviewed the CDCR packet subpoenaed to court\nand consisting of over 200 pages; the mental health evaluations provided by the Public\nDefender (Motion), the Presentence Report and Supplemental Presentence Report from\nthe original sentencing, and the Transcript of the original sentencing, all of which\nincluding [sic] evidence of [defendant’s] prospects if released, his criminal history and\nrecord while I [sic] prison.\n              “After reviewing all of the material referenced above and in consideration\nof the criteria set forth in . . . section 1170.126(f)(g), the Court concludes that\nresentencing of this [defendant] would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety.\n              “There is a brazenness to [defendant’s] criminal history that evidences a\nlack of control over criminal impulses. The violent juvenile conduct including rape; the\nforcible entry into private residences, the shooting at the heads of fleeing victims and the\nwalking into a bank with a forged check and trying to pull it off with a straight face, all\ndemonstrated a certain hubris and lack of concern for serious, traumatic, if not deadly\nconsequences. Even [defendant’s] check-passing victim was particularly violated and\nfearful by the act.\n\n                                               10\n\f              “In prison [defendant] has been involved in violence of a different sort. His\ntwo suicide attempts in 1999 and 2000, by hanging and cutting have evidenced a\ncontinuing penchant for the ultimate act of violence, trying to do violence to himself.\nThen, there are the two documented instances of hand-to-hand violence with other\ninmates, once in a riot condition and the other in a two-man battle. The Court does not\ngive[] as great of weight to the 2006 riot, understanding that such a circumstance could\nhave, by its very nature, drawn [defendant] into combat of a defensive nature. Also,\nunlike [defendant’s] past acts, there is no evidence of cunning or planning involved on\nhis part. There is also the fact that through many mental health evaluations, [defendant]\nhas been classified for a ‘single cell’ due to his ‘psychiatric problems.’ This was the case\nin 2005 and it was recently confirmed in 2011 for the following year. A [sic] stated in\nthe report, this was necessary ‘due to the chronic mental health problem [sic] that is quite\nresistant to treatment.’\n              “Heavy use of multiple types of drugs was what contributed to some of\n[defendant’s] criminal activity while on release. The use of such drugs has been\nconnected in some of the CDCR evaluation reports to the need to mask depression and\nanxiety for which the [defendant] has been diagnosed. At the time of sentencing in this\ncase, [defendant] had served two prior State Prison terms and a commitment to the\n[CYA]. For this reason, [defendant’s] track record while free, is quite limited, providing\nlittle support for the notion that he will be drug-free and thus, crime-free on release.\nExacerbating the risk factor is that the period immediately after release, will be parole-\nfree.\n              “As a further indicator of risk, the records reviewed by the Court do not\nreveal any instance where the [defendant] has acknowledged responsibility for his\ncriminal acts, including the ones that had a direct impact on crime victims. Thus, a\npossible indicator of rehabilitation and good prospects on release is not present in this\ncase.\n\n                                             11\n\f              “The Court has considered [defendant’s] academic and personal\naccomplishments in prison as indicated by the documentation provided in the Motion.\nThis shows [defendant] has taken advantage of opportunities for college credits and\npersonal improvements, including participation in anger management type programs.\nHowever, this is not enough to overcome the factors recited above.”\n7. Defendant’s Motion for Reconsideration and Notice of Appeal\n              In July 2013, defendant filed a motion for reconsideration of the denial of\nhis petition, supported by two expert declarations. The first declaration was from Daniel\nVasquez, a corrections expert with over 30 years of experience in the CDCR. Based\nupon his review of the CDCR records considered by the court, Vasquez opined that\ndefendant has “aged out” of his drug addiction and does not pose a danger to the\ncommunity if released. The second declaration was from Hinkin and, as noted above, he\nopined defendant has a favorable prognosis for avoiding relapse.\n              The district attorney filed opposition.\n              After a hearing in August 2013, the court denied defendant’s motion for\nreconsideration. The court explained:\n              “[Defendant], his case presented significant concerning features that I\noutlined in my order, some of which, frankly, weren’t even cited by the district attorney’s\noffice. We all have our own views of human nature and public safety, and we all have\nour own life experiences. And the court has to, at this point, use its own experience as\nwell as the information you all have given to sum up the situation on behalf of the public\nand determine whether the standard has been met relative to unreasonable risk to public\nsafety.\n              “My concern with respect to [defendant] is there are indicators that he has\nlived a very insular and protected life in custody; the consistent status of being essentially\ndeemed to be in such a psychiatric condition that he needs to be isolated from people is\nsomething that is not available once he is released.\n\n                                             12\n\f              “As to the mental illness issue, I do want to assure counsel that this court\nhas dealt with that issue in this context before. I have ordered second strike sentencing\non people who have significant mental illness issues. It’s been a hiccup in the process,\nbut it has not been, in my view, a factor that would cause somebody to be denied release\nif all other factors were in place. Quite frankly, as we all know, if you are not mentally ill\nwhen you go in, the process of long-term incarceration with no prospect of release can\ncause certain mental illness features to surface. So it’s just not uncommon to see people\nwith mental illness in this condition.\n              “A couple of comments. The material presented by Dr. Hinkin relative to\nmental illness and drug issues. I understand the issues. I don’t see anything the court\nwouldn’t have already considered.\n              “With respect to Mr. Vasquez - assuming this is some kind of request that\nwe convene a hearing for evidentiary purposes or the court recive this for evidentiary\npurposes - I think Mr. Vasquez’s declaration, as opposed to Dr. Hinkin’s, probably\nencroaches upon the court’s role. I think the law is clear that the court must evaluate all\nof the factors that he has evaluated here. So I’m not sure an expert would be called for at\na sentencing hearing when we are talking about evaluating somebody’s correctional\nprogress.\n              “That having been said, I didn’t see anything in his analysis that would\nchange the court’s opinion. And so I’ll just defer the issue of whether the court would\nhave stricken his ultimate opinion as inappropriate in a sentencing proceeding, because\nlike I said, I didn’t see anything that would have caused the court to revisit or think that I\nhave missed something in the first instance. So the court’s tentative would be to\nrespectfully deny the motion for reconsideration on this grounds. Let me turn to the\nPeople, if you have any follow-up comments.”\n              Thereafter, defendant filed timely notices of appeal from both the denial of\nhis petition and the denial of his motion for reconsideration.\n\n                                              13\n\f         THE BURDEN OF PROOF AND THE STANDARD OF REVIEW\n              Under the Reform Act, if the petitioner is statutorily eligible for relief, “the\npetitioner shall be resentenced . . . unless the court, in its discretion, determines that\nresentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.”\n(§ 1170.126, subd. (f).) The prosecution has the burden of proving defendant’s\ndangerousness by a preponderance of the evidence. (People v. Superior Court (Kaulick)\n(2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">215</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

(g).)\n              There is a dispute between the parties about the applicable standard of\nreview. Defendant contends we review the court’s dangerousness determination for\nabuse of discretion, citing Kaulick. But Kaulick did not say that. The Attorney General\nargues the court’s dangerousness determination need only be supported by “some\nevidence,” also citing Kaulick. But Kaulick did not say that either.\n              What the Court of Appeal in Kaulick did say is: “A trial court’s decision to\nrefuse to resentence a prisoner, based on a finding of dangerousness, is somewhat akin to\na decision denying an inmate parole. Such a [parole] decision need only be supported by\n‘some evidence’ . . . . This does not mean that an inmate is otherwise eligible for release\n[under section 1170.126] but that release can be denied on a finding supported only by\n‘some evidence.’ It simply means that the inmate remains subject to his initial sentence\nunless certain findings are made; these findings need not be established beyond a\nreasonable doubt.” (Kaulick, supra, 215 Cal.App.4th at p. 1306, fn. 29.)\n\n                                               14\n\f              Several cases decided since Kaulick have now clarified that when a court\ndenies relief under section 1170.126 because reducing a petitioner’s sentence entails an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety, that discretionary determination is reviewed\nunder the familiar abuse of discretion standard. (See, e.g., People v. Davis (2015) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">234</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1001</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Davis.) Using this standard, we consider whether the ruling, “exceeds\nthe bounds of reason or is arbitrary, whimsical or capricious.

Thus, we review the entire record in the light most\nfavorable to the court’s factual findings to determine whether it discloses evidence that is\nreasonable, credible, and of solid value such that a reasonable trier of fact could make\nthose factual findings by a preponderance of the evidence.

But if the factual findings are not supported by substantial evidence,\nthey cannot form the basis for an unreasonable risk determination. (See People v.

Defendant also\nmaintains the court’s reliance on facts contrary to the record was prejudicial. We will\nconsider each of these contentions in turn.\n\n\n\n                                              15\n\f1. The Court Did Not Fail to Consider Defendant’s Most Recent Housing Status.\n              Defendant first contends the court failed to consider his most recent\nhousing status, did not make an informed decision, and improperly relied on stale\ninformation rather than current circumstances. We are not persuaded.\n              As noted, the court found: “There is also the fact that through many mental\nhealth evaluations, [defendant] has been classified for a ‘single cell’ due to his . . .\n‘chronic mental health problem that is quite resistant to treatment.’” But nothing in the\nrecord suggests the court was unaware of or ignored the fact that defendant’s single cell\nstatus ended some time in 2012. In fact, the opposite is true. The court reviewed all of\nthe mental health records which contain multiple references to defendant’s housing status\nthroughout his incarceration.\n              Furthermore, defendant mischaracterizes the court’s comments on\ndefendant’s single cell housing status. The import of those comments was not that\ndefendant was then housed in a single cell. Rather, the significance was that for\nsubstantial periods during his incarceration, defendant’s mental health problems had\nnecessitated housing him in a single cell. As the court explained:\n              “My concern with respect to [defendant] is there are indicators that he has\nlived a very insular and protected life in custody; the consistent status of being essentially\ndeemed to be in such a psychiatric condition that he needs to be isolated from people is\nsomething that is not available once he is released.”\n              In short, the court found it had been necessary to house defendant in a\nsingle cell at various times due to his mental health, and determined that fact was\n“relevant in deciding whether a new sentence would result in an unreasonable risk of\ndanger to public safety.” (§ 1170.126, subd. (g)(3).) This factual finding is supported by\nsubstantial evidence in the record, and this discretionary determination did not exceed the\nbounds of reason, nor was it arbitrary, whimsical or capricious. Accordingly, the court\ndid not abuse its discretion in this regard.\n\n                                               16\n\f2. The Court Did Not Erroneously Find Defendant Used a Firearm in Connection With\nthe Crimes Which Resulted in His 1985 Assault with a Deadly Weapon Conviction.\n              Defendant next contends the court erred by considering his use of a firearm\nin connection with the crimes which resulted in his 1985 assault with a deadly weapon\nand residential burglary convictions, and by finding the 1985 assault with a deadly\nweapon conviction to be a firearm related offense. We do not agree.\n              Preliminarily we note, all of these arguments are predicated upon\ndefendant’s factual assertion there is no evidence in the record that he used a firearm in\ncommitting these crimes, other than the statements of the victims in the 1985 arrest report\nas summarized in the 1999 presentence report. Defendant is wrong.\n              During the 1999 trial in this case, a “prior” packet, consisting of the Los\nAngeles Superior Court records of defendant’s 1985 convictions, was marked and\nintroduced into evidence as exhibit 6 (Exhibit 6). At that time the court considered\nExhibit 6 and said, “I’m just reviewing the portion on the use of weapon.” A minute\nlater, the court stated, “as to the second of the three pled priors [assault with a deadly\nweapon], there was actual personal use of gun.” (Italics added.)\n              Exhibit 6 also included a reporter’s transcript of the change of plea hearing\nin the 1985 case, which reflects the following colloquy:\n              “[DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY] MS. COLEMAN: To the charges\nset forth in Information number A 702862 in Count II, a violation of 245, Penal Code\nSection 245, subdivision (a), subdivision (l), assault with a deadly weapon with the use of\na firearm, [and] Count V, a violation of Penal Code Section 459 in the first degree,\nresidential burglary, how do you now plead?\n              “THE DEFENDANT: No contest.\n              “[¶] . . . [¶]\n              “THE COURT: How about the enhancements?\n              “MS. COLEMAN: All right.\n\n                                              17\n\f              “Mr. Sledge you’re pleading no contest to the personal use of a firearm, am\nI correct, under . . . Section 12022.5?\n              “THE DEFENDANT: Yes.\n              “MS. COLEMAN: As relates to Count II?\n              “THE DEFENDANT: Yes.”\n              Therefore, even ignoring the statements summarized in the presentence\nreport, there is substantial evidence in the record to support the finding that defendant\npersonally used a firearm in committing the 1985 assault with a deadly weapon.\n              Lastly, defendant asserts the evidence admitted during the 1999 trial,\nincluding Exhibit 6, cannot be considered because it was “not before the trial court,” and\n“[i]t was the prosecution’s burden to submit whatever evidence it chose in opposing\n[defendant’s] motion.” Nonsense. All of the evidence admitted during the 1999 trial was\nbefore the court that heard it, and the district attorney was not required to resubmit or\nrefer to it before the court could rely on it. To hold otherwise would be to require the\ncourt to ignore the evidence it previously heard, and to deprive the court of its discretion\nto consider evidence it “determines to be relevant.” (§ 1170.126, subd. (g)(3).)\n              A. The Court Was Not Limited To Considering Only Crimes and\nEnhancements for Which Defendant Was Actually Convicted.\n              Defendant argues the court was not authorized to consider crimes and\nenhancements which defendant was charged with but not convicted of, so the court\nabused its discretion by considering portions of the 1999 presentence report filed in this\ncase. Specifically, he objects to the court’s consideration of portions of the presentence\nreport which: (a) summarized the 1985 arrest report stating defendant pointed a gun at\nthe victims and ordered them inside, and when they attempted to flee he fired one round\nover their heads and said he would blow their heads off; and (b) stated defendant was\narrested for residential robbery (former § 213.5).\n\n\n\n                                             18\n\f              We reject these arguments and objections for several reasons. As for the\nstatements attributed to the victims of the 1985 crimes, it is not clear the court relied on\nthe presentence report summary at all, rather than its own independent recollection of the\n1985 prior conviction evidence which was introduced as Exhibit 6 during the 1999 trial.\nIndeed, during the 1999 sentencing hearing in this case, the court noted, “the fact of the\nmatter is he . . . committed an aggravated home invasion style, shooting guns, take-over\nrobbery of the most aggravated nature.” (Italics added.)\n              But even if the court did rely on the presentence report summary rather than\nits own independent recollection in denying the petition, the court had previously relied\non that same summary without objection at the 1999 sentencing hearing. So any\nobjection to the court’s reliance on that summary has long since been waived.\n              As for the presentence report statement that defendant was arrested in 1985\nfor residential robbery, again it is not clear the court actually relied on it. At any rate, the\n                                                                                            5\nstatement is true. The record indicates defendant was arrested for residential robbery.\n              Defendant next argues the court was not permitted to consider charged\noffenses, as distinguished from convictions, because section 1170.126, subdivision (g)(1)\nauthorizes a court to consider the petitioner’s criminal conviction history, including the\ntype of crimes committed, the extent of injury to victims, etc., but says nothing about\ncharged offenses. He then invokes the maxim inclusio unius est exclusio alterius, and\nconcludes consideration of charged offenses must have been intentionally excluded.\n\n\n\n       5\n          According to Exhibit 6, in 1985 defendant was charged with: (1) residential\nrobbery (former § 213.5) with personal use of a firearm (§§ 12022.5 & 1203.06, subd.\n(a)(1)); (2) assault with a deadly weapon (§ 245, subd. (a)(1)) with personal use of a\nfirearm (§ 12022.5); (3) residential burglary (§§ 459 & 460, subd. (a)) with personal use\nof a firearm (§§ 12022.5 & 1203.06, subd. (a)(1)); (4) assault with intent to commit\nforcible rape (§§ 220 & 261, subd. (2)); (5) residential burglary (§§ 459 & 460, subd.\n(a)); and (6) assault with a deadly weapon (§ 245, subd. (a)(1)) with personal use of a\nfirearm (§ 12022.5).\n\n                                               19\n\f              We doubt any exclusion was intentional. Regardless, once more the court\nis authorized to consider any evidence which “the court, within its discretion, determines\nto be relevant in deciding whether a new sentence would result in an unreasonable risk of\ndanger to public safety.” (§ 1170.126, subd. (g)(3).) That language is certainly broad\n                                                                     6\nenough to encompass the charges which led to the 1985 convictions.\n              Under these circumstances, substantial evidence supports the court’s\nfinding the offenses charged in 1985 included residential robbery, and the court did not\nabuse its discretion by determining those charged offenses were relevant in deciding\nwhether a new sentence would result in an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.\n              B. The Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion By Considering Statements in\nthe Presentence Report Made By Persons Other Than Defendant.\n              Defendant also maintains the court abused its discretion, by considering the\nstatements of the victims in the 1985 arrest report which were summarized in the 1999\npresentence report, thereby violating his Sixth Amendment rights. Here he relies on\nPeople v. Williams (1990) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2159406\"><a href=\"/opinion/2159406/people-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">222</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

However, the court here was not\ndetermining whether to enhance defendant’s sentence. Instead, defendant had already\nreceived the maximum sentence and petitioned for a grant of lenity. “Any facts found at\nsuch a proceeding, such as dangerousness, do not implicate Sixth Amendment issues.”\n(Kaulick, supra, 215 Cal.App.4th at p. 1305.)\n\n       6\n         According to Exhibit 6, in 1985 defendant pled no contest to the assault with a\ndeadly weapon and the residential burglary, and defendant admitted the gun use\nallegation; and in return, the prosecution dismissed all of the other charged offenses,\nincluding the residential robbery. The convictions and the dismissed offenses all arose\nout of the same conduct on the same dates, December 31, 1984, and January 3, 1985.\n\n                                            20\n\f              Williams is also factually distinguishable. In Williams, the court relied\nsolely on a multiple hearsay statement attributed to the victim in a probation report. The\nCourt of Appeal held, “Because the triple hearsay statement in the probation report was,\nas the court expressly acknowledged, the only evidence in the record tending to prove\npersonal use of a dangerous weapon, the enhancement finding is not supported by\nsubstantial evidence.” (Williams, supra, 222 Cal.App.3d at p. 918.)\n              In this case, the multiple hearsay statements of the 1985 victims are not the\nonly evidence in the record tending to prove the personal use of the firearm. As we have\nshown, even ignoring the victim’s statements, there is substantial evidence that defendant\npersonally used a firearm in committing the 1985 assault with a deadly weapon. Thus,\nWilliams does not apply, and the court did not abuse its discretion by determining those\nstatements were relevant in deciding whether a new sentence would result in an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety. (§ 1170.126, subd. (g)(1), (3).)\n              C. The Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion By Considering the Firearm\nRelated Statements, Even Though Defendant Denied Using a Firearm.\n              Defendant also avers the court abused its discretion by considering the\nstatements of the victims in the 1985 arrest report regarding defendant’s firearm use,\nbecause defendant denied using a firearm. This argument is based on the assertion “it is\nunknown whether [defendant] was even charged with a firearm use enhancement, and\nmore importantly, even if he was, he did not plead guilty to it.” We have already\ndemonstrated this assertion is simply untrue.\n              What is more, the factual basis for defendant’s 1985 no contest plea\nactually stated he “commit[ted] the crime of assault with a deadly weapon by shooting a\nrevolver at [the victims]” and counsel stipulated to the factual basis for the firearm\nenhancement. Once again the court did not abuse its discretion by determining this\nevidence was relevant in deciding whether defendant posed an unreasonable risk of\ndanger to public safety. (§ 1170.126, subd. (g)(1),(3).)\n\n                                             21\n\f              D. The Court Did Not Err By Finding Defendant’s 1985 Assault With a\nDeadly Weapon Conviction Was Firearm Related.\n              Defendant next professes the court abused its discretion by erroneously\nfinding he had been convicted of a firearm related offense. We disagree, as noted above.\nFurther, the Court of Appeal opinion in Sledge I found his 1985 convictions involved\n“the use of a gun.” (Sledge I, supra, D036483.) This finding is final and binding for all\npurposes in this case. (Vandenberg v. Superior Court (1999) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1252963\"><a href=\"/opinion/1252963/vandenberg-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">815</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 828-829.)\nThus, there was no error.\n3. The Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion By Finding the Record Did Not Reveal Any\nInstance Where Defendant Acknowledged His Responsibility for His Crimes.\n              Defendant claims the court abused its discretion by erroneously finding the\nrecord did not reveal any instance where he acknowledged responsibility for his criminal\nacts. He points to the court’s statement, “the records reviewed by the Court do not reveal\nany instance where [he] has acknowledged responsibility for his criminal acts, including\nthe ones that had a direct impact on crime victims.”\n              Defendant says the court was mistaken, because he acknowledged his\nresponsibility in the declaration he filed in support of the petition. He quotes parts of his\ndeclaration, which we set out more fully for context:\n              “Petitioner/I acknowledged [sic] that, prior to being arrested, that I had a\nsevere drug abuse problem and expected something more dramatically [sic] would have\nto occur in order for me to stop. Because I had already lost two careers, abandoned my\nfirst marriage with sons, then destroyed a second marriage, and resulted content [sic]\nbeing homeless.\n              “There is no doubt that I was screaming for help when I participated in this\ncriminal activity. And for all the wrong reasons caused me to be dishonest of how I came\nin possession of the forgery check, when telling the truth would probably have resulted in\nme being diverted to a drug treatment program.\n\n                                             22\n\f              “So, during the last 14 years in prison I have deeply regretted my past\ninability to tackle my problems, so receiving this 25-years to life in prison, I made a point\nto transform myself which the attached Exhibits would some what [sic] demonstrate my\ndiligent efforts and dedication for becoming a Born Again Christian.\n              “Hereford [sic], I deeply am sorry and regret all the hardship and pain I’ve\ncaused my family, my past and current victims. And upon the $1,000 Restitution\nimposed, I now only owe $200 dollars through prison jobs labor by only being paid no\nmore than 15 cents an hour from the very limited jobs assignment.\n              “However, I must express to this court how disappointed that I was unable\nto convince to the Judiciary System that various factual information (newly discovery)\nand retroactive laws compels [sic] I should only be/been suffering from one 1985 (count\n4) prior burglary strike contrarily [sic] to the three currently strikes. I ask this court to\nfirst note that my 1981 (CYA) burglary juvenile adjudication pursuant to Welf. Inst.\nCode 1731.5 (a). Which I should had [sic] gotten relief under People v. Garcia (1999) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1427973\"><a href=\"/opinion/1427973/people-v-garcia/\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> and allowed another Romero-Hearing (PC 1385).\n              “Conjunctively, this petitioner’s 1985 prior strikes (#2 and #3) were also\nunder a plea-agreement of a court’s ‘Consolidated Trial’ to been [sic] counted for only\none prosecuted case (one-strike case). Also, this second strike of PC 245 (a) (1), (count\n2) was deliberately stayed so I would not be harm [sic] by it being stipulated in the record\nbecause both it and its PC 12022.5 were being Stayed. No punishment was ever imposed\nat sentencing (the Sentencing Hearing severe [sic] contradict the Abstract of Judgment).\nPetitioner’s [sic] was lead into believing he was pleading to aiding and abetted\n(substantiating evidence existed to support this petitioner’s never processed or/and fired\nsuch gun).\n              “In addition, both these prior cases were plea-deals induced pursuant to PC\n667.5 (b) ‘5-Years Washout Period.’ That he’d fulfilled prior to any new laws to\nsupersede.”\n\n                                               23\n\f              Taken together, these statements hardly support defendant’s contention that\nhe “not only acknowledged responsibility for his criminal acts, he did so unequivocally.”\nInstead, it appears defendant blames all of his criminal acts on his drug problems, and he\nbelieves he has been wronged by the criminal justice system. Furthermore, it seems the\nonly thing defendant truly regrets is the life sentence he is now serving. Thus, the court’s\nruling is not contrary to the declaration.\n              Defendant also says the court’s finding he never acknowledged\nresponsibility for his criminal acts was based in part on a mistaken premise that he had\nbeen convicted of a firearm related offense. As discussed ante, there was no mistake.\nThe court found defendant had been convicted of a firearm-related offense in 1985, and\nthat finding is supported by substantial evidence.\n              Moreover, the court considered all the evidence in the record, including his\ndenials in the probation report as summarized at the sentencing hearing, and found\ndefendant never acknowledged responsibility for any of his convictions. This factual\nfinding is also supported by substantial evidence. We agree with the court, “it appears\nthere is a pattern of denial and completely different story as to the significant and very\nimportant criminal acts, including the shooting at a residence, the rape issue, and then the\ncurrent offense.”\n4. Even if the Court Did Rely on Facts Contrary to the Record, Defendant Was Not\nPrejudiced.\n              Finally, defendant contends the court’s alleged reliance on facts contrary to\nthe record was prejudicial. Once more, we do not agree. Even if the court erred as\ndefendant contends, the error was harmless because it is not reasonably probable he\nwould have achieved a more favorable result absent the error. (People v. Watson (1956)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1444734\"><a href=\"/opinion/1444734/people-v-watson/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">818</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 836.) Leaving aside the disputed evidence, the court articulated a number\nof other legitimate concerns about dangerousness, all of which are supported by\nsubstantial evidence in the record.\n\n                                             24\n\f              The court observed defendant has a violent criminal history, including two\nincidents of mutual combat while in prison. The court noted defendant’s “lack of control\nover criminal impulses” as evidenced by the “brazenness” of his criminal history.\nAdditionally, the court considered his two suicide attempts, his sustained pattern of heavy\ndrug use, and his “chronic mental health problem.” Plus, the court worried that upon\nrelease, he would be “parole free.”\n              These concerns alone support the court’s determination defendant poses an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety, and thus the court acted well within its\ndiscretion in denying his petition for resentencing. So it is not reasonably probable\ndefendant would have received a more favorable outcome even absent the alleged errors.\n5. Section 1170.18 Does Not Apply to Resentencing Under the Reform Act.\n              On November 4, 2014, after oral argument in this case, the voters of the\nState of California approved the Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Act (Proposition 47).\nAmong other things, Proposition 47 added section 1170.18, subdivision (c) (section\n1170.18(c)). Section 1170.18(c) provides: “(c) As used throughout this Code,\n‘unreasonable risk of danger to public safety’ means an unreasonable risk that the\npetitioner will commit a new violent felony within the meaning of clause (iv) of\nsubparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of Section 667.” (Italics added.)\n              As we have discussed at length throughout, the phrase “unreasonable risk\nof danger to public safety” is also used in section 1170.126, subdivision (f), and is central\nto the resolution of this appeal. Therefore, we ordered the parties to brief the question of\nwhether the section 1170.18(c) definition applies to this appeal. This question is\ncurrently pending before the California Supreme Court.

Guzman (Apr. 2, 2015, G049135)\n__ Cal.App.4th __ [2015 Cal.App. Lexis 286] (Guzman)(maj. opn. of Fybel, J.)\n[definition under § 1170.18(c) does not apply to resentencing under § 1170.126] (conc.\nopn. of Aronson, J.) [definition under § 1170.18(c) does apply to resentencing under §\n1170.126, but not retroactively].) We agree with Davis and Guzman on this question.\nAnd we too conclude “that the five words ‘As used throughout this Code’ [citation] were\nnot intended by the voters to hamstring the Three Strikes Reform Act.” (Davis, supra,\n234 Cal.App.4th at p 1026.) Accordingly, we decline to apply the section 1170.18(c)\ndefinition of “unreasonable risk of danger to public safety” to this appeal.\n                                      DISPOSITION\n              The judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n\n                                                  THOMPSON, J.\n\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\n\nMOORE, ACTING P.
