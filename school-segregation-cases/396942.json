App. P. 35; 11th Cir. R. 35-5.\n\n      Michael W. Bass appeals the district court’s order granting summary\n\njudgment to the Board of County Commissioners of Orange County in his lawsuit\n\nclaiming race discrimination in violation of Title VII and the Equal Protection\n\nClause, as well as retaliation in violation of Title VII. For the reasons set forth\n\nbelow, we reverse and remand for a jury trial on his race discrimination and\n\nretaliation claims.\n\n                                I. BACKGROUND\n\n                                       A. Facts\n\n      In August 1995, the Orange County Fire and Rescue Division (the\n\n“Division” or “Fire and Rescue Division”) began a reorganization of its workforce\n\nas a result of a $9 million budget shortfall. A number of positions were eliminated,\n\nincluding all four Training Captain positions, one of which was held by Michael\n\nBass, the white male plaintiff in this case. Like the other three people employed in\n\nthat position, Bass received a layoff notice in September 1995.\n\n\n                                           2\n\f      The four Captain-level positions that were eliminated were replaced with\n\nthree Lieutenant-level Training Instructor positions. Bass applied for one of those\n\nthree positions. In order to become a Training Instructor, the County specified that\n\na person must have “two years training instructor or closely related work\n\nexperience” and “must possess and maintain a valid Florida Department of\n\nEducation Teacher’s Certificate or obtain [one] within 18 months of employment.”\n\nBass’ qualifications exceeded those minimums. Moreover, according to Frank\n\nMontes de Oca, who was Chief in Charge of Training at the Division, as a training\n\ninstructor Bass “was an excellent employee who constantly received good or\n\noutstanding evaluations.” He was first or second in seniority among instructors,\n\nand, under terms of the union contract, should have been the last or next to last to\n\nbe laid off in the event of a reduction in force.\n\n      All qualified persons, including those who had been laid off, were allowed\n\nto apply for the three Training Instructor positions. The Fire and Rescue Division\n\nused a Performance Based Interview system to select candidates for various\n\npositions, including the Training Instructor positions. In that type of interview,\n\ncandidates are asked pre-selected questions to test their responses to hypothetical\n\nsituations they may face on the job. The candidates are expected to respond by\n\nexplaining what they have done in similar situations.\n\n\n                                           3\n\f      A three-member panel interviewed Bass and twelve other applicants for the\n\nthree Training Instructor positions. The members of the interview panel were\n\nCharles Middleton (black male), Ray Valle (Hispanic male), and Betty Meeks\n\n(black female). At the time of the reorganization, Middleton was the Acting\n\nAssistant Department Manager in charge of Administration and had supervisory\n\nresponsibility over the Division’s Training Instructors. He was also a member of\n\nthe Progressive Firefighters Association, an advocacy organization for black\n\nfirefighters, and he was known to support affirmative action and a promotional\n\n“fast track” for minorities.\n\n      Middleton testified that he selected Meeks and Valle for the interview panel\n\nand that, in doing so, he “[t]ried to select people who had little or no involvement\n\nwith the training function” so that they would have had nothing at stake in the\n\nDivision’s reorganization. Meeks was employed in the County’s Human\n\nResources Department, and admits that she had no knowledge beyond that of a lay\n\nperson concerning the position of fire department training instructor. She was also\n\nknown to be a supporter of affirmative action. Although Valle was employed by\n\nthe Division, he worked as an information technology specialist and had no\n\ntraining in firefighting. Nothing in the record indicates Valle’s views on\n\n\n\n\n                                          4\n\faffirmative action. Therefore, with the possible exception of Middleton,1 none of\n\nthe panel members was a certified firefighter in Florida, nor had any panel member\n\nheld a Training Instructor position.\n\n       Not only did the panel members lack experience as Training Instructors,\n\nnone of them was given any training or guidelines (other than general training\n\nconcerning interview skills) to help them evaluate which candidates were best\n\nqualified for the positions. Remarkably, none of them received any job description\n\nshowing the duties of a Training Instructor. Nor did any of them receive the\n\ninterview questions until just before the start of the interviews. They were not told\n\nto take notes of the interviews, and none of them did.\n\n       Mitch Floyd, who was Chief of the Fire and Rescue Division from 1989\n\nuntil April 1995, stated in his affidavit that the County had adopted the interview\n\nprocess “to create some leeway to allow us to promote minority candidates.” He\n\nstated under oath that the interview score was not supposed to be determinative,\n\nbut was meant to be only one of several factors, including education, experience,\n\n\n\n       1\n        The record is less clear with respect to Middleton’s experience and credentials. The\nrecord seems to indicate that Middleton was not a certified firefighter in the State of Florida.\nFurthermore, although the record shows that Middleton had supervisory responsibility over the\nDivision’s Training Instructors, nothing in the record indicates that Middleton had any personal\nexperience as a Training Instructor. Given the procedural posture, of course, we are required to\nview the facts in the light most favorable to the non-movant, Bass. Viewing the evidence that\nway, Middleton was not a certified firefighter and had no experience as a Training Instructor.\n\n                                                5\n\fand diversity (i.e., race and gender) that were to be considered. The County’s\n\nwritten policy specifically stated that scores were not to be totaled and that the\n\ninterview was only one component to be considered. Similarly, Tom Preston (not\n\nrelated to one of the candidates, Henry Preston), who developed the interview\n\nprocess for the Training Instructor position, stated that the interview scores were\n\nnot intended to be determinative. The interviews for the Training Instructor\n\npositions took place in October 1995. After the panel finished interviewing all the\n\ncandidates, the panel members combined their individual scores for each candidate\n\nand then ranked the candidates based on their aggregate interview scores. The\n\npanel ranked Bass ninth out of the thirteen applicants. Middleton and Valle\n\ntestified that Bass did not answer the questions that were asked and did not\n\ninterview as well as expected considering his experience as a training officer.\n\n(Meeks was not questioned about Bass interview performance during her\n\ndeposition.) Contrary to the written policy and all the testimony about how the\n\ninterview results were to be used, selections for the Training Instructor position\n\nwere made solely on the basis of the interview scores.2 Because Bass received a\n\n      2\n          The interview scores were as follows:\n\nName                  Previously Supervisor           Score   Selected   Race\nGina McCollum                Yes            16          X           W\nDan Kucik                    No             15                      W\nDonna Reed                   Yes            13          X           W\n\n                                                  6\n\flow score on the interview, the panel did not choose him for one of the three\n\nTraining Instructor positions. Instead, the panel chose three of the applicants\n\nwhom it had given higher interview scores: a black male and two white females.\n\n       Henry Preston, the black candidate selected for one of the three Training\n\nInstructor positions, did not even meet the minimum qualifications for the position.\n\nHis resume reflected that he had no experience as a Training Instructor and only\n\ntwo years of experience as a firefighter, even though one of the minimum\n\nrequirements for a Training Instructor position was “two (2) years training\n\ninstructor or closely related work experience.” Moreover, Preston misrepresented\n\nhis qualifications both on his general employment application and on his Training\n\nInstructor application. Although Preston represented on those documents that he\n\n\nHenry Preston                No             13        X           B\nDavid Cohen                  No             12                    W\nKaren Barber                 No             12                    W\nHenry Butts                  No             11                    W\nJohn Russell                 Yes            10                    B\nMichael Bass                 Yes             8                    W\nVictoria Quick               No              7                    W\nStephen Manning              No              5                    W\nThomas Wheeler               No              4                    W\nTerry Boston                 No              4                    W\n\nThe candidate with the second-highest score, Dan Kucik, was selected for (and accepted) the\nhigher-ranking position of Group Supervisor. The Group Supervisors were chosen through a\nseparate selection process which involved different PBI interviews. Therefore, Kucik’s\nperformance during his Training Instructor interview does not account for his selection as a\nGroup Supervisor. John Russell (black male), who ranked eighth in the Training Instructor\ninterview was also selected as a Group Supervisor. Bass applied for a Group Supervisor\nposition, but was not selected.\n\n                                                 7\n\fattended the University of Central Florida for three years as an accounting major\n\nand earned 94 credits there, he had never attended that university. Preston testified\n\nin his deposition that the County’s Human Resources Department knew he had\n\n“exaggerated” his educational credits. Initially he had submitted an application\n\nwhich truthfully showed he lacked the necessary qualifications, but someone from\n\nHuman Resources told him that his application needed to be changed before it\n\nwould be accepted. Taking the suggestion, Preston submitted a second application,\n\nand this one falsely stated he had attended the University of Central Florida. It was\n\nonly on the basis of that lie about his qualifications, a lie he testified the County\n\nhad encouraged, that Henry Preston was judged to be qualified for a Training\n\nInstructor position.\n\n      After being denied a Training Instructor position for which he was\n\nindisputably qualified, Bass was given the choice of being demoted to\n\nengineer/paramedic or being laid-off. He took the demotion. In October 1995,\n\nBass filed a union grievance challenging his demotion and removal from training\n\nduties. On November 17, 1995, while his grievance was pending, Bass complained\n\nto the Division Chief James Moody that Henry Preston lacked the necessary\n\nqualifications for the Training Instructor position. Bass recorded the events in his\n\ndiary, writing as follows:\n\n\n                                           8\n\f      Met with Moody. . . . Advised him that Preston, Reed and Kucik did\n      not have an A.S. degree, only high school degree and Reed had a\n      GED and Preston did not qualify for training position. Witnessed by\n      Wertz and Angel Gonzales. Moody advised me that the County will\n      continue to promote based on color and that I should file legal action\n      against the County.\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n        In December 1995, the County settled Bass’ union grievance without a\n\nhearing by reassigning him to be a fourth Training Instructor. Bass was given the\n\njob title, rank, and pay of a Training Instructor, but he was not assigned to a district\n\nand was not permitted to perform the duties of a Training Instructor. Before the\n\nreorganization, there were four Training Instructors, each holding the rank of\n\nCaptain, assigned to cover five battalions. After the reorganization, there were\n\nthree Training Instructors, each holding the rank of Lieutenant, assigned to cover\n\nthree districts (as the battalions were renamed). One Training Instructor was\n\nassigned to each of the three districts. As a result, when the Division finally made\n\nBass a Training Instructor he was the fourth one, and there was no vacant district\n\nto assign him.\n\n      In December 1995, on his first day as a Training Instructor, Bass was\n\nassigned to clean out a warehouse – work ordinarily done by inmates supplied by\n\nthe Department of Corrections. Between December 1995 and April 1996, Bass had\n\nno routine work assignments, performed custodial and clerical duties, and usually\n\n                                           9\n\fwas supervised by personnel who were less senior than he. Middleton, who was\n\nin charge of the Training Instructors, and Chief Smith ordered Bass not to record\n\non his work logs the custodial and clerical work he was performing.\n\n      Bass’ non-custodial assignments included working with the Division’s\n\nEmergency Medical Services unit, working on the Community Health Care\n\nInitiative, teaching CPR for Head-start day care workers, and assisting other\n\nTraining Instructors in developing training programs. Bass was not permitted to\n\nearn overtime pay, on-call pay, riding-out-of-classification pay, or adjunct teaching\n\npay, all of which were available to the other Training Instructors. Although he\n\npreviously had been permitted to teach numerous outside courses, such as a SWAT\n\nteam tactical rope course offered at various law enforcement agencies, in his\n\nposition as Training Instructor Bass was denied all opportunities to teach outside\n\ncourses. He also was required to take tests in order to retain his paramedic pay,\n\nwhile the three other training instructors were not.\n\n      In January 1997, Bass was transferred out of the Training Bureau without\n\neven being told of the transfer. He learned of the transfer upon returning from\n\nvacation and discovering that his paycheck was no longer available in the Training\n\nBureau and that he was no longer on that bureau’s payroll. From January until\n\nApril of 1997, Bass did not know where he had been transferred or to whom he\n\n\n                                          10\n\fwas to report. In April 1997, he was told to report for work in a non-budgeted\n\nposition that was not covered by the union contract. After the union complained,\n\nBass was allowed to keep his Training Instructor title, and he was given a\n\ntemporary assignment under Chief Weagraff in Quality Assurance. In the spring\n\nof 1998, one of the three budgeted Training Instructor positions became available,\n\nbut it was not given to Bass. In fact, it was never filled. At least as late as\n\nFebruary 1999, Bass was still temporarily assigned to Chief Weagraff.\n\n                                    B. Procedural History\n\n       Bass filed a ten-count complaint against the County on March 31, 1997. The\n\ncomplaint contained race discrimination claims under Title VI of the Civil Rights\n\nAct of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d, et seq.; Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\n\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq.; 42 U.S.C. § 1981; 42 U.S.C. § 1983; the Equal\n\nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution;\n\nand the Florida Civil Rights Act of 1992, Fla. Stat. chs. 760.01-760.11. The\n\ncomplaint also contained retaliation claims under Title VII; 42 U.S.C. § 1981; the\n\nFlorida Civil Rights Act of 1992, Fla. Stat. chs. 760.01-760.11; the First\n\nAmendment to the United States Constitution; and a claim under Florida’s\n\nveterans’ preference statutes, Fla. Stat. §§ 295.07 & 295.085.3\n\n       3\n          On appeal, Bass does not challenge the district court’s rulings on his Title VI or\nveterans’ preference claims, but argues that the district court erred in granting summary\n\n                                                11\n\f       The County moved for summary judgment. With respect to the race\n\ndiscrimination claims, the County proffered as its reason for not giving Bass one\n\nof the Training Instructor positions his poor performance on the Performance\n\nBased Interview. With respect to Bass’ retaliation claims, the County argued that\n\nBass could not establish a prima facie case of retaliation, and that even if he could,\n\nhe could not refute the County’s asserted legitimate reason for its actions – he was\n\nnot given Training Instructor duties because there was not an open district. The\n\ndistrict court entered an order granting summary judgment to the County as to all\n\ncounts in the complaint.\n\n                              II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n       We review a district court's grant of summary judgment de novo, using the\n\nsame legal standard employed by the district court. See, e.g., Fitzpatrick v. City of\n\nAtlanta, 2 F.3d 1112, 1117 (11th Cir. 1993). \"Summary judgment is appropriate if\n\nthe record shows no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is\n\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law. When deciding whether summary judgment\n\nis appropriate, all evidence and reasonable factual inferences drawn therefrom are\n\nreviewed in a light most favorable to the non-moving party.\" Witter v. Delta Air\n\nLines, Inc., 138 F.3d 1366, 1369 (11th Cir. 1998) (citation and quotations omitted).\n\n\n\njudgment on his race discrimination and retaliation claims.\n\n                                               12\n\f                                 III. DISCUSSION\n\n                      A. RACE DISCRIMINATION CLAIMS\n\n      In his complaint, Bass alleges that the County discriminated against him\n\nbased on his race (non-Hispanic, white) in violation of Title VII, § 1981, § 1983,\n\nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and the Florida Civil\n\nRights Act. Sometimes this type of claim, where a white employee alleges to be\n\nthe victim of discrimination, is referred to as a “reverse discrimination” claim.\n\nWhatever the rhetorical effect of that phrase in the ongoing public debate over\n\naffirmative action may be, it has no place in the legal analysis of the alleged\n\ngovernmental action before us. Discrimination is discrimination no matter what\n\nthe race, color, religion, sex, or national origin of the victim. See McDonald v.\n\nSante Fe Trail Transp. Co., 427 U.S. 273, 280, 96 S. Ct. 2574, 2579 (1976)\n\n(holding that Title VII prohibits discrimination against whites as well as non-\n\nwhites). Our Constitution does not distinguish between races and neither do we.\n\nSee Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537, 559, 16 S. Ct. 1138, 1146 (1896) (Harlan,\n\nJ., dissenting) (“Our constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates\n\nclasses among citizens. In respect of civil rights, all citizens are equal before the\n\nlaw.”). As Justice Scalia has observed, “In the eyes of government, we are just\n\none race here. It is American.” Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200,\n\n\n                                          13\n\f239, 115 S. Ct. 2097, 2119 (1995) (concurring opinion); see also Regents of Univ.\n\nof Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 289-90, 98 S. Ct. 2733, 2748 (1978) (Powell, J.,\n\nplurality opinion) (“The guarantee of equal protection cannot mean one thing when\n\napplied to one individual and something else when applied to a person of another\n\ncolor.”). Racial discrimination against whites is just as repugnant to\n\nconstitutionally protected values of equality as racial discrimination against blacks.\n\nTherefore, we will treat Bass’ Title VII and Equal Protection Clause\n\ndiscrimination claims as discrimination claims, not as “reverse discrimination”\n\nclaims, and we will analyze his claims exactly as we would any racial\n\ndiscrimination claim.\n\n      Although the analyses for Bass’ Title VII and Equal Protection claims are\n\nclosely related, the Supreme Court has recognized that it “do[es] not regard as\n\nidentical the constraints of Title VII and the Federal Constitution.” Johnson v.\n\nTransportation Agency, Santa Clara County, Calif., 480 U.S. 616, 632, 107 S. Ct.\n\n1442, 1452 (1987). In addressing the interplay between Title VII and § 1983, we\n\nrecently concluded that Congress intended to make available separate, non-\n\nexclusive causes of actions and remedies under these provisions, and held that a\n\nplaintiff may bring a claim under one provision without asserting a claim under the\n\nother. Thigpen v. Bibb County, Sheriff’s Dep’t, 223 F.3d 1231, 1237-39 (11th Cir.\n\n\n                                          14\n\f2000). Because claims under Title VII and the Equal Protection Clause are\n\ndistinct and the Supreme Court has instructed us that different standards are\n\napplicable to them, we will address these claims separately.\n\n                              1. Title VII Framework\n\n      Title VII makes it an unlawful employment practice for an employer \"to fail\n\nor refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise discriminate against\n\nany individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of\n\nemployment, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national\n\norigin.\" 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a). Bass alleges that the County violated Title VII by\n\nrefusing to hire him for the Training Instructor position because he is a non-\n\nHispanic, white person.\n\n      A plaintiff may establish a Title VII claim through the introduction of direct\n\nevidence of discrimination or through circumstantial evidence that creates an\n\ninference of discrimination. To evaluate Title VII claims based on circumstantial\n\nevidence, we use the familiar framework established in McDonnell Douglas Corp.\n\nv. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817 (1973), and Texas Department of\n\nCommunity Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 101 S. Ct. 1089 (1981). See Combs\n\nv. Plantation Patterns, 106 F.3d 1519, 1527-28 (11th Cir. 1997). Under this\n\nframework, the plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination.\n\n\n                                          15\n\fSee Combs, 106 F.3d at 1527-28 (citations omitted). In order to establish a prima\n\nfacie case of race discrimination under Title VII, the plaintiff must show that: (1)\n\nhe was qualified and applied for the position; (2) he was rejected despite his\n\nqualifications; and (3) other equally or less qualified employees who are not\n\nmembers of his race were hired. See Taylor v. Runyan, 175 F.3d 861, 866 (11th\n\nCir. 1999) (citing Wu v. Thomas, 847 F.2d 1480, 1483 (11th Cir.1988)). Once the\n\nplaintiff has made out a prima facie case of discrimination, the employer must\n\narticulate some legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the employee's rejection.\n\nSee Wu, 847 F.2d at 1483-84. If the employer meets this burden of production, the\n\nplaintiff then must establish that each of the defendant's proffered reasons for\n\nhiring someone of a different race is pretextual. See id.\n\n      “[I]n cases of discrimination proven by direct evidence, it is incorrect to rely\n\non the McDonnell Douglas test because, while circumstantial evidence is used to\n\ncreate an inference of discrimination under McDonnell Douglas, no such inference\n\nis required in the case of direct evidence.” Taylor, 175 F.3d at 867 n.2; Evans v.\n\nMcLain of Georgia, Inc., 131 F.3d 957, 962 (11th Cir. 1997) (“[O]nce a plaintiff\n\nproduces direct evidence of a discriminatory motive, and the trier of facts accepts\n\nthis testimony the ultimate issue of discrimination is proved.” (citation and internal\n\nquotation omitted)); Trotter v. Board of Trustees of the Univ. of Ala., 91 F.3d\n\n\n                                          16\n\f1449, 1453 (11th Cir.1996) (\"When there is direct evidence that discrimination was\n\na motivating factor in the challenged employment decision, the appropriate\n\nanalysis is different from that employed in a case where only circumstantial\n\nevidence is available.\"). The defendant’s burden when refuting direct evidence of\n\ndiscrimination is one of persuasion and not merely production. See Hill v.\n\nMetropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Auth., 841 F.2d 1533, 1539 (11th Cir. 1988).\n\nBass attempts to prove his Title VII claim with both direct and circumstantial\n\nevidence of discrimination.\n\n      In this case, the County has not disputed that Bass established a prima facie\n\ncase of discrimination under the McDonnell Douglas framework. Therefore, for\n\npurposes of summary judgment, we assume that Bass is in a protected class, was\n\nqualified to become a Training Instructor, applied for the position, was rejected\n\ndespite his qualifications and was rejected in favor of another less qualified\n\nemployee of a different race. The dispute in this case concerns whether Bass has\n\nalso presented direct evidence of discrimination, and, if not, whether he has put\n\nforth sufficient circumstantial evidence that the County’s proffered non-\n\ndiscriminatory reason for its actions (i.e., Bass’ poor performance during his\n\ninterview) was pretextual. We now turn to these disputed issues.\n\n   2. Title VII Direct Evidence Contention Based on Chief Moody’s Statements\n\n\n                                          17\n\f      First, Bass contends that a statement made to him by Chief Moody – the\n\nchief of the Fire and Rescue Division at the time of the decision not to offer Bass\n\none of the Training Instructor positions during the 1995 reorganization –\n\nconstitutes direct evidence of discrimination. Bass testified that he confronted\n\nChief Moody about the promotion of employees who lacked the necessary\n\nqualifications for the Training Instructor position, and Moody responded that the\n\nCounty would continue to promote based on color. We agree with the district\n\ncourt that this statement does not rise to the level of direct evidence of\n\ndiscrimination by the Division.\n\n      Direct evidence of discrimination is “evidence which, if believed, would\n\nprove the existence of a fact [in issue] without inference or presumption.” Earley\n\nv. Champion Int’l Corp., 907 F.2d 1077, 1081 (11th Cir. 1990) (citation and\n\nemphasis omitted). “[O]nly the most blatant remarks, whose intent could be\n\nnothing other than to discriminate on the basis of [race] . . . constitute direct\n\nevidence of discrimination.” Damon v. Fleming Supermarkets of Fla., Inc., 196\n\nF.3d 1354, 1358 (11th Cir. 1999) (citations omitted). “For statements of\n\ndiscriminatory intent to constitute direct evidence of discrimination, they must be\n\nmade by a person involved in the challenged decision.” Trotter v. Bd. of Trustees,\n\n91 F.3d 1449, 1453-54 (11th Cir. 1996). “[R]emarks by non-decisionmakers or\n\n\n                                           18\n\fremarks unrelated to the decisionmaking process itself are not direct evidence of\n\ndiscrimination.” Standard v. A.B.E.L. Servs., Inc., 161 F.3d 1318, 1330 (11th Cir.\n\n1998).\n\n      Bass argues that Chief Moody’s statement – made close in time to the\n\ndecision to offer the Training Instructor positions to other candidates and against\n\nthe backdrop of the County’s affirmative action plans – constitutes direct evidence\n\nof discrimination. However, Bass presented no evidence showing that Moody was\n\na decisionmaker or involved in the selection of the Training Instructors. Although\n\nBass attaches significance to the fact that Moody was the chief at the time of the\n\ndecision, the fact remains that Moody was not a member of the interview panel and\n\nwas not involved in the selection process. Only statements by the persons involved\n\nin the decisionmaking process, here the interview panel members, could constitute\n\ndirect evidence of discrimination. Therefore, although Moody’s statements may\n\nprovide significant circumstantial support for Bass’ claims, they do not constitute\n\ndirect evidence of discrimination. See Standard, 161 F.3d at 1330.\n\n            3. Circumstantial Evidence Supporting the Title VII Claim\n\n      Even though Chief Moody’s statements are not direct evidence of\n\ndiscrimination, we believe that Bass has put forth ample circumstantial evidence of\n\ndiscrimination to permit his Title VII, § 1981 and Florida Civil Rights Act claims\n\n\n                                         19\n\fto go to a jury. In addition, for the reasons explained in section 4, infra, we find\n\nthat the County’s affirmative action plans, when viewed in light of the\n\ncircumstantial evidence which would allow a reasonable jury to conclude that the\n\nDivision was acting pursuant to those plans, do constitute direct evidence of racial\n\ndiscrimination against Bass. Therefore, we conclude that the district court erred in\n\nentering summary judgment against Bass’ Title VII race discrimination claims.\n\n      It is undisputed that Bass established a prima facie case of race\n\ndiscrimination under the McDonnell Douglas framework. Consequently, a\n\npresumption of discrimination arose and the burden shifted to the County to proffer\n\na legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for not hiring Bass. See Combs, 106 F. 3d\n\nat 1527-28. To meet that burden of production, the County proffered one reason, a\n\nsubjective one, for not hiring Bass for a Training Instructor position. The County\n\nclaimed that Bass did not score as well on his interview (purportedly the only\n\nselection criterion used) as the other candidates selected for the position.\n\n      This Court recently reaffirmed that a subjective reason for an employer’s\n\naction – such as poor interview performance – can be as legitimate as any other\n\nreason. See Chapman v. AI Transport, 229 F. 3d 1012, 1033 (11th Cir. 2000) (en\n\nbanc). An interview is frequently necessary to assess qualities that are particularly\n\nimportant in supervisory or professional positions. Id. at 1033. This is because\n\n\n                                          20\n\f“[t]raits such as common sense, good judgment, originality, ambition, loyalty, and\n\ntact often must be assessed primarily in a subjective fashion.” Id. at 1034 (internal\n\nmarks and citations omitted). However, in order for a subjective reason to\n\nconstitute a legally sufficient, legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason, the defendant\n\nmust articulate “a clear and reasonably specific factual basis upon which it based\n\nits subjective opinion.” Id.; see also Burdine, 450 U.S. at 258, 101 S. Ct. at 1096\n\n(“[T]he defendant’s explanation of its legitimate reasons must be clear and\n\nreasonably specific” so that “the plaintiff be afforded a ‘full and fair opportunity’\n\nto demonstrate pretext.”).\n\n      Although the proffered reason, Bass’ poor interview, was subjective, the\n\nCounty offered explanations of why the interview panel, the decisionmakers,\n\narrived at that subjective conclusion. Valle stated that Bass “did not interview\n\nanywhere near as well as [he] expected him to” and observed that Bass “didn’t\n\nanswer the questions that [the interviewers] were asking.” Middleton opined that\n\nBass “could have presented himself better” and that Bass gave “answers\n\nirrespective of the questions.” Bass’ testimony does not contradict the panel\n\nmembers’ assessment of his interview performance. Bass stated that he “had the\n\nimpression that [the interview] was just some kind of a go-through-the-motion\n\nthing.” Although Bass admitted that he did not perform well during the interview,\n\n\n                                          21\n\fhe claimed that his poor performance was caused by Middleton’s interrupting him\n\nwhile he was trying to answer the questions. Middleton did not recall interrupting\n\nBass during the interview, but Valle testified that if a candidate was “headed in the\n\nwrong direction” the interviewers would “try and help” the candidate by\n\n“clarify[ing] what it was [they] were looking for.”\n\n      Because the interviewers explained the grounds for their subjective\n\nevaluation with reasonable clarity and specificity, the County met its burden of\n\nproducing a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for not hiring Bass as a Training\n\nInstructor. After the County articulated this reason, the burden shifted back to\n\nBass to present sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of fact that the\n\nCounty’s non-discriminatory reason was pretext for discrimination. In response,\n\nBass argued that: (1) the County encouraged employees to hire and promote based\n\non race and established a system for hiring and promotion which created leeway so\n\nthat minorities could advance more easily; (2) Chief Moody said that the County\n\nwas going to continue to promote on the basis of color; (3) Preston, the black\n\ncandidate selected as a Training Instructor, did not meet the minimal qualifications\n\nfor the position; (4) the Fire and Rescue Division deviated from its established\n\nprocedures and the interview process was otherwise tainted; and last, but not least,\n\n\n\n\n                                          22\n\f(5) the County had in place affirmative action plans with the goal of increasing\n\nminority representation within the Division.\n\n                   a. Pressure to Hire and Promote Minorities\n\n      With respect to Bass’ first pretext argument, he introduced evidence of\n\ncounty officials’ emphasis on hiring and promoting based upon race. Montes de\n\nOca, Chief of the Fire and Rescue Division from 1990 though 1997, testified that\n\nhe was pressured to hire more minorities and that he had received periodic reports\n\nshowing the number of women and blacks in all positions. Mitch Floyd, Chief of\n\nthe Division from 1989 until April 1, 1995, testified that managers’ success or\n\nfailure in meeting the County’s affirmative action goals “could adversely affect\n\ntheir future as managers,” and that the County Administrator, County Chairwoman,\n\nand the County Commission regularly communicated this to the Division\n\nmanagers. From that evidence a jury could reasonably find the County had a\n\npolicy of racial discrimination against non-Hispanic whites.\n\n      Bass also presented evidence that the interview system, the same system that\n\nwas used in hiring the Training Instructors, was used to carry out the affirmative\n\naction plans’ goals of emphasizing race in hiring decisions, i.e., the policy of racial\n\ndiscrimination against non-Hispanic whites. Floyd, who developed the interview\n\nsystem for the Training Instructor and Group Supervisor positions and who was a\n\n\n                                          23\n\fmember of the Group Supervisor interview panel, testified that Performance Based\n\ninterviews were adopted as a subjective evaluation process that would create\n\n“leeway” in promoting minorities because the County “didn’t have the time or\n\nvacancies to wait out the gradual improvement of skills.”\n\n      This evidence of pressure in the County to hire minorities over non-\n\nminorities, combined with the existence of an interview system adopted in order to\n\ncreate leeway to promote minorities, constitutes circumstantial evidence of\n\ndiscriminatory intent behind the Division’s hiring decisions.\n\n       b. Chief Moody’s Statement Concerning Race-Based Promotion\n\n      As to his second pretext argument, Bass testified that when he confronted\n\nChief Moody about Henry Preston’s lacking the requisite qualifications, Moody\n\ntold him that the County would continue to promote on the basis of color. As we\n\nhave already said, because Bass did not introduce sufficient evidence establishing\n\nthat Moody was a decisionmaker, his statement cannot constitute direct evidence of\n\ndiscrimination. Nonetheless, this statement does constitute circumstantial evidence\n\nof discrimination because it raises the inference that the Training Instructor\n\ninterview panel members improperly based their decisions on race, rather than\n\nperformance during the interview or other legitimate criteria.\n\n\n\n\n                                          24\n\f                    c. Promotion of Less-Qualified Candidate\n\n      In support of his third pretext argument, Bass presented evidence that he was\n\nthe most qualified applicant for the position and that Preston did not even meet the\n\nminimum qualifications for the position. At the time he applied for the Training\n\nInstructor position, Preston’s resume reflected that he had no experience as a\n\nTraining Instructor and only two years of experience with the Fire and Rescue\n\nDivision and had earned no credits toward his teaching certificate. It should have\n\nbeen obvious on the face of Preston’s application that he could not meet the\n\nmandatory criterion of obtaining a Florida teaching certification within 18 months\n\nof being promoted and that he lacked the requisite two years of Training Instructor\n\nexperience.\n\n      Hiring a less qualified person can support an inference of discriminatory\n\nmotivation. See Alexander v. Fulton County, 207 F.3d 1303, 1340 (11th Cir.\n\n2000) (“both the Supreme Court and this court have observed that evidence\n\nshowing an employer hired a less qualified applicant over the plaintiff may be\n\nprobative of whether the employer's proffered reason for not promoting plaintiff\n\nwas pretextual”); Walker v. Mortham, 158 F.3d 1177, 1190 (11th Cir. 1998) (“The\n\nfact that a court may think that the employer misjudged the qualifications of the\n\napplicants does not in itself expose him to Title VII liability, although this may be\n\n\n                                          25\n\fprobative of whether the employer's reasons are pretexts for discrimination.”\n\n(internal marks, emphasis and citation omitted)). Here, the fact that the Division\n\npromoted Preston, an employee who was unqualified under the Division’s criteria,\n\nover Bass supports an inference of discrimination. This inference is further\n\nstrengthened by Chief Moody’s statement that the County would continue to\n\npromote based on race and by other circumstantial evidence of discrimination.\n\n                     d. Deviation from Standard Procedure\n\n      In support of his fourth pretext argument, Bass presented evidence indicating\n\nthat the Fire and Rescue Division departed from its standard procedure when it\n\ninterviewed the applicants for the Training Instructor positions. Tom Preston, who\n\ndeveloped the interview process for the Training Instructor and Group Supervisor\n\npositions, testified that interview scores were not intended to be determinative, and\n\nthe interview policy specifically stated that scores were not to be totaled and that\n\nthe interview was only one component to be considered. The policy, which was\n\nidentified in deposition by Valle, included the following instructions:\n\n      NOTE: Do not total scores. This process is intended to develop a\n      profile, highlighting a candidate’s areas of strength and weakness.\n      This process was designed as one component to be used in\n      conjunction with other criteria to determine a final selection.\n\nThe Division violated these written procedures by totaling the scores and relying\n\nexclusively upon the interviews. An employer’s violation of its own normal\n\n                                          26\n\fhiring procedure may be evidence of pretext. See Hill v. Seaboard Coast Line\n\nR.R., 885 F.2d 804, 811 (11th Cir. 1989). We believe that this is especially true\n\nwhere, as here, an employer disregards all but one of the factors and qualifications\n\ngenerally taken into consideration and relies solely on a factor which was designed\n\nto create “leeway” for the promotion of people of a certain race.\n\n      Furthermore, other facts surrounding the interview process used in selecting\n\nthe Training Instructors indicate that the process was suspect. For example, the\n\ninterviewers, who were the sole decisionmakers, received no training or guidelines\n\nto help them evaluate which candidates were best qualified for the Training\n\nInstructor positions. The interviewers were supposed to evaluate the applicants’\n\nresponses to certain situations to determine which candidates would make the best\n\nTraining Instructors, yet the interviewers were never even informed of what duties\n\na Training Instructor had. Although Middleton testified that he had at some time\n\nreceived training in the interview process itself, he said he received no training\n\nwith respect to the specific qualifications to look for when interviewing the\n\nTraining Instructor applicants. Valle, another member of the Training Instructor\n\ninterview panel, testified that he knew very little about firefighter training at the\n\ntime he served on the panel. Meeks, the final member of the Training Instructor\n\ninterview panel, testified that she had no knowledge of firefighting or training\n\n\n                                           27\n\fwhen she served on the panel. Furthermore, despite the fact that the panel\n\nmembers were called upon to judge the applicants’ qualifications to be Training\n\nInstructors, Middleton, who chose the other two panel members, testified that he\n\n“[t]ried to select people who had little or no involvement with the training\n\nfunction.”\n\n      We recognize that “a defendant may terminate an employee for a good or\n\nbad reason without violating federal law” and “[w]e are not in the business of\n\nadjudging whether employment decisions are prudent or fair.” Damon v. Fleming\n\nSupermarkets of Florida, Inc., 196 F.3d 1354, 1361 (11th Cir. 1999). We are,\n\nhowever, in the business of adjudging whether an employer violated Title VII by\n\nimproperly making employment decisions based on race. In this case, the selection\n\nprocess employed by the Division, when viewed in light of the other evidence of\n\nthe County’s race-conscious hiring and promotion efforts, constituted\n\ncircumstantial evidence that the Division was acting with race in mind while\n\nselecting Training Instructors, and that is so even without any consideration of the\n\nCounty’s formal affirmative action plans.\n\n                    e. The County’s Affirmative Action Plans\n\n      The last category of evidence that the proffered interview reason was pretext\n\nis the County’s affirmative action plans, which were in effect at the time that the\n\n\n                                          28\n\fFire and Rescue Division refused Bass a Training Instructor position. As we will\n\nexplain in the next section, we think the County’s affirmative action plans – unless\n\nthose plans are valid – are actually direct evidence of unlawful discrimination.\n\n                                        f. Conclusion\n\n       We conclude that the evidence offered by Bass was more than sufficient to\n\nraise a genuine issue of material fact about whether the County’s articulated\n\nnondiscriminatory reason for not hiring him was pretextual. The county officials’\n\nemphasis on promoting employees based upon race, the statement by Chief Moody\n\nconcerning race-conscious efforts, the Division’s deviation from procedures, the\n\nhiring of an unqualified candidate instead of Bass, who was qualified, provide\n\nmore than enough evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude that the County’s\n\nproffered non-discriminatory explanation for its actions was pretextual. The\n\ndistrict court erred when it granted summary judgment in favor of the County on\n\nBass’ race discrimination claims under Title VII, § 1981 and the Florida Civil\n\nRights Act.4\n\n       4\n        Although Bass has presented no separate arguments in support of his claims under the\nFlorida Civil Rights Act, we have recognized that “decisions construing Title VII are applicable\nwhen considering claims under the Florida Civil Rights Act. . . . ” Harper v. Blockbuster\nEntertainment Corp., 139 F.3d 1385, 1387 (11th Cir. 1998). Likewise, “[t]he elements of a\nclaim of race discrimination under 42 U.S.C. § 1981 are also the same as a Title VII disparate\ntreatment claim in the employment context.” Rice-Lamar v. City of Fort Lauderdale, 232 F.3d\n836, 843 n.11 (11th Cir. 2000). Therefore, for the same reasons that we reverse the grant of\nsummary judgement as to Bass’ Title VII race discrimination claim, we also reverse as to his\nrace discrimination claims brought under the Florida Civil Rights Act and § 1981.\n\n                                               29\n\f                 4. Direct Evidence Supporting the Title VII Claim\n\n      We now turn to the consideration of the County’s affirmative action plans as\n\ndirect evidence of discrimination supporting Bass’ Title VII, § 1981 and Florida\n\nCivil Rights Act claims. The affirmative action issues in this case arise in a\n\nsomewhat unusual posture. In a typical Title VII case involving an affirmative\n\naction plan, an employer asserts in response to a plaintiff’s prima facie showing of\n\ndiscrimination that its employment decision was made pursuant to an affirmative\n\naction plan and that its compliance with such a plan was a legitimate,\n\nnondiscriminatory reason for its actions. See, e.g., Johnson v. Transportation\n\nAgency, Santa Clara County, Calif., 480 U.S. 616, 626-27, 107 S. Ct. 1442, 1449\n\n(1987). The question in those circumstances is whether the employer’s affirmative\n\naction plan is valid.\n\n      In this case, the County has sought no cover from its affirmative action plans\n\n(and, in fact, seems to distance itself from them), and it is Bass who relies on the\n\nCounty’s affirmative action plans in support of his claims. Of course, a defendant\n\nwho in fact acts pursuant to an affirmative action plan cannot avoid judicial review\n\nof the plan by disavowing reliance upon it, where there is evidence that the plan\n\nplayed a part in the employment decision.\n\n\n\n\n                                          30\n\f      The first step in ascertaining whether the County can be held liable for\n\ndiscrimination as a result of its affirmative action plans is a determination of\n\nwhether there is sufficient evidence that it acted pursuant to those plans. The mere\n\nexistence of an affirmative action plan by itself does not constitute direct evidence\n\nof discrimination unless there is also evidence that the employer acted pursuant to\n\nthe plan in making employment decisions. See Brown v. McLean, 159 F.3d 898,\n\n904 (4th Cir. 1998) (holding that affirmative action plan is only relevant if\n\ndefendant acted pursuant to plan); Cerrato v. San Francisco Community College\n\nDist., 26 F.3d 968, 976 (9th Cir. 1994) (same); McQuillen v. Wisconsin Educ.\n\nAss’n Council, 830 F.2d 659, 666 (7th Cir. 1987) (same).\n\n      However, the existence of an affirmative action plan, when combined with\n\nevidence that the plan was followed in an employment decision, is sufficient to\n\nconstitute direct evidence of unlawful discrimination unless the plan is valid. See\n\nMcGarry v. Board of County Comm’rs of Pitkin, 175 F.3d 1193, 1200 (10th Cir.\n\n1999) (holding that county personnel director’s statements that those hired were not\n\nbetter qualified than white applicant and that those hirings were minority\n\naffirmative action hirings, made against the backdrop of the county’s policy\n\nstatements regarding hiring and affirmative action, constituted direct evidence of\n\ndiscrimination). Furthermore, even when a defendant denies having acted pursuant\n\n\n                                           31\n\fto its affirmative action plan, if there is evidence that it may have done so, a jury\n\nmust decide whether the defendant in fact acted pursuant to its stated plan.\n\nSee Messer v. Meno, 130 F.3d 130, 139 (5th Cir. 1997) (finding that jury could\n\nconclude that defendant acted pursuant to affirmative action plan in light of\n\ncircumstantial evidence even though defendant denied having taken plan into\n\naccount). When a jury finds that a government employer acted pursuant to an\n\naffirmative action plan, then the employer should be held liable for discrimination\n\nunless the plan is valid under Title VII and the Equal Protection Clause.5 This is\n\nbecause, regardless of good intentions, a government employer commits unlawful\n\ndiscrimination when it takes race into account in an employment decision and acts\n\npursuant to an invalid affirmative action plan.6\n\n       5\n         Under 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(g)(2)(B), adopted as part of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, a\ndefendant may, however, limit the types of relief to which a Title VII plaintiff is entitled if it is\nable to “prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have made the same disputed\nemployment decision even in the absence of the alleged discrimination.” Lewis v. Young Men’s\nChristian Assoc., 208 F.3d 1303, 1304 (11th Cir. 2000). See also Canup v. Chipman-Union,\nInc., 123 F.3d 1440, 1441-42 (11th Cir. 1997) (discussing impact of the 1991 amendments to the\nCivil Rights Act on cases in which defendant attempts to show that it would have made same\ndecision even without discrimination).\n       6\n         In another case recently before this Court, a plaintiff in a race discrimination lawsuit\nsought summary judgment as to the employer’s liability based on its undisputed compliance with\nits affirmative action plan. See Thigpen v. Bibb County, Sheriff’s Dep’t, 223 F.3d 1231, 1244\n(11th Cir. 2000). Although we did not rule out that such a finding of liability might be\nappropriate in some cases, we noted that an affirmative action plan “does not necessarily offend\nthe equal protection clause,” and remanded that case for a determination of whether the\naffirmative action plan passed muster under strict scrutiny analysis. Id. Our analysis in Thigpen\nleaves open the possibility, however, that summary judgment as to liability for discrimination\nmight be appropriate where there is no dispute over whether a defendant was acting pursuant to\nan affirmative action plan, if a district court determines that the affirmative action plan is invalid\n\n                                                  32\n\f      a. Meaning of “Direct Evidence” in Context of Discrimination Claim\n\n       For the reasons that follow, we hold that where there is an invalid affirmative\n\naction plan in effect relating to the employer’s allegedly discriminatory actions, that\n\nplan constitutes direct evidence of discrimination if there is sufficient circumstantial\n\nevidence to permit a jury reasonably to conclude the employer acted pursuant to the\n\nplan when it took the employment actions in question.\n\n       Because we believe that the term has been a source of confusion, we begin by\n\ndiscussing the meaning of “direct evidence” in the context of a Title VII race\n\ndiscrimination claim. First, we note that the phrase “direct evidence,” when used in\n\nthe context of discrimination claims, does not refer to whether evidence is direct or\n\ncircumstantial in the ordinary evidentiary sense in which we normally think of those\n\nterms. Instead, “direct evidence” refers to a type of evidence which, if true, would\n\nrequire no inferential leap in order for a court to find discrimination. We do not\n\nbelieve that the status of evidence as “direct” in this context, however, changes\n\nsimply because a defendant contests the validity of the evidence, thereby requiring\n\nthe plaintiff to offer proof related to the disputed evidence through other means.\n\n\n\n\nunder Title VII and the Equal Protection Clause.\n\n                                               33\n\fTherefore, an affirmative action plan may constitute direct evidence, even when a\n\ndefendant denies having acted pursuant to its stated plan.7\n\n\n\n\n       7\n         The County argues that affirmative action plans should be considered circumstantial,\ninstead of direct, evidence. It points out that Johnson applied the McDonnell Douglas burden-\nshifting framework in assessing an affirmative action plan, Johnson, 480 U.S. at 626, 107 S. Ct.\nat 1449, and some of our decisions have held that with direct evidence “it is incorrect to rely on\nthe McDonnell Douglas test because, while circumstantial evidence is used to create an inference\nof discrimination under McDonnell Douglas, no such inference is required in the case of direct\nevidence.” See, e.g., Taylor v. Runyon, 175 F.3d 861, 867 n.2 (11th Cir. 1999). The County\nreasons that because the McDonnell Douglas framework does not apply to direct evidence\nclaims, and the Supreme Court applied that framework to an affirmative-action-based claim in\nJohnson, it necessarily follows that affirmative action plans cannot be direct evidence. Although\nthis syllogism has some superficial appeal, we believe it ultimately fails.\n\n         To begin with, we note that the Supreme Court never said in Johnson that affirmative\naction plans should be treated as circumstantial evidence. In fact, the word “circumstantial”\nnever appears in that opinion. Instead, the Court simply concluded that the McDonnell Douglas\nframework was useful in light of the assignment of the various burdens relevant to the claim.\nSee Johnson, 480 U.S. at 626, 107 S. Ct. at 1449 ) (“This case also fits readily within the\nanalytical framework set forth in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct.\n1817, 36 L. Ed.2d 668 (1973). Once a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case that race or sex has\nbeen taken into account in an employer’s employment decision, the burden shifts to the employer\nto articulate a nondiscriminatory rationale for its decision. The existence of an affirmative action\nplan provides such a rationale. If such a plan is articulated as the basis for the employer’s\ndecision, the burden shifts to the [Title VII] plaintiff to prove that the employer’s justification is\npretextual and the plan is invalid.”). Nothing in Johnson means that the plaintiff is not entitled to\nprevail without further adieu if the affirmative action plan the employer asserts as the motivation\nfor its actions is invalid.\n\n        As we explain below, treating affirmative action plans as direct evidence is consistent\nwith our other decisions relating to direct evidence. Statements by decisionmakers clearly\nevincing discriminatory intent and obviating the need to rely on an inference of discrimination\nconstitute direct evidence of discrimination. See, e.g., Merritt v. Dillard Paper Co., 120 F.3d\n1181, 1189 (11th Cir. 1997). In principle, an affirmative action plan is exactly such a statement.\nThe only thing to distinguish an affirmative action plan from any other discriminatory statement\n(other than the degree of formality involved) is that the discrimination it describes or prescribes\nis permissible if the plan is valid under Title VII and the Equal Protection Clause. If it is not\nvalid, an affirmative action plan amounts to nothing more than a formal policy of unlawful\ndiscrimination.\n\n                                                  34\n\f      This view of direct evidence is supported by this Court’s case law addressing\n\nother types of direct evidence of discrimination. We have held that “[w]here the\n\nnon-movant presents direct evidence that, if believed by the jury, would be sufficient\n\nto win at trial, summary judgment is not appropriate even where the movant presents\n\nconflicting evidence.” Mize v. Jefferson City Bd. of Educ., 93 F.3d 739, 742 (11th\n\nCir. 1996) (emphasis added). Furthermore, “[w]e have defined direct evidence as\n\n‘evidence, which if believed, proves the existence of fact in issue without inference\n\nor presumption.’” Merritt v. Dillard Paper Co., 120 F.3d 1181, 1189 (11th Cir. 1997)\n\n(quoting Rollins v. TechSouth, Inc., 833 F.2d 1525, 1528 n.6 (11th Cir. 1987))\n\n(emphasis added). The factual premise of “direct evidence” of discrimination may\n\nbe disputed, and it may well be that a plaintiff will have to establish the “direct\n\nevidence” by introducing circumstantial evidence. For example, in Merritt, we\n\nconsidered whether an alleged statement by an employer constituted direct evidence\n\nin support of the plaintiff’s retaliation claim. Merritt, 120 F.3d at 1189-91. In that\n\ncase, the employer denied that a decisionmaker had made a statement which, if true,\n\nclearly showed a retaliatory motive behind the termination of the plaintiff’s\n\nemployment. Id. Nonetheless, we concluded that because a jury could find that the\n\ndecisionmaker had made the statement, there was direct evidence of retaliation\n\nprecluding summary judgment. Id. Given this approach, we hold, for the following\n\n\n\n                                           35\n\freasons, Bass has put forth enough evidence of the existence of direct evidence of\n\ndiscrimination in the form of the County’s affirmative action plans that a jury could\n\nfind the Division acted pursuant to those plans.\n\n                    b. The County’s Affirmative Action Plans\n\n      We begin with the facts concerning the County’s affirmative action plans. All\n\nparties agree that the County had affirmative action plans in place at the time of the\n\nFire and Rescue Division’s reorganization, and that those plans were applicable to\n\nthe Division. Bass showed that in November 1990, the Board of County\n\nCommissioners adopted a five-year affirmative action plan. The plan stated that the\n\nunderutilization of blacks and Hispanics at the Division existed “division wide.” It\n\nset county-wide goals for the hiring of minorities and instructed division directors\n\nand department managers to establish annual numerical hiring and promotion\n\nobjectives to alleviate the underutilization of women and minorities.\n\n      Bass also presented evidence that in July 1993, the County adopted another\n\nplan, the 1993 Diversification Plan, “to ensure that Orange County’s workplace is\n\ndevoid of discrimination and is generally reflective of the County’s diverse\n\npopulation.” The 1993 Diversification Plan required county departments and\n\ndivisions to suspend the hiring process when no qualified minority or female\n\napplicant was available and “provide written justification to the EEO/Professional\n\n\n\n                                          36\n\fStandards Department stating job related reasons why diversity cannot be obtained\n\nvia the particular hiring process.” The 1993 Diversification Plan also set percentage\n\nhiring goals in positions that were found to have few minorities or women. That\n\n1993 plan was in effect during the time Bass interviewed for the Training Instructor\n\nposition in October 1995, and it covered hiring at the Fire and Rescue Division. In\n\nits response to Bass’ EEOC charge, the County acknowledged the existence of an\n\naffirmative action plan covering the Division and stated that one of the paramount\n\nobjectives of the plan was to “increase the percentage of women and minorities in\n\njob categories where they have been traditionally underrepresented.”\n\n      Although the County clearly had affirmative action plans in place during the\n\n1995 reorganization, it contends based on testimony from the interview panel\n\nmembers, that the decision not to offer the Training Instructor position to Bass was\n\nunrelated to its affirmative action plans. To support this contention, the County\n\npoints to testimony from the panel members indicating that the Training Instructors\n\nwere selected solely on the basis of their interview scores and that no other factors,\n\nsuch as race, were taken into consideration. Valle specifically testified that there was\n\nno discussion of race at anytime. Furthermore, the County notes that the three\n\nTraining Instructors selected represented the top three interview scores of the\n\napplicants who were still in consideration.\n\n\n\n                                           37\n\f      Although the parties dispute whether the Fire and Rescue Division was acting\n\npursuant to the County’s affirmative action plans, we must bear in mind that this\n\ncase is before us at the summary judgment stage. This means the County is entitled\n\nto judgment at this time only if it shows “that there is no genuine issue as to any\n\nmaterial fact.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). Moreover, Bass, as the non-movant, is entitled\n\nto have all reasonable inferences from the evidence in the record drawn in his favor.\n\nRyder Int’l Corp. v. First American Nat’l Bank, 943 F.2d 1521, 1523 (11th Cir.\n\n1991).\n\n      There is substantial circumstantial evidence in the record upon which a jury\n\nreasonably could conclude that the Division acted pursuant to the County’s\n\naffirmative action plans. We have outlined above various types of circumstantial\n\nevidence which, independent of the County’s affirmative action plans, permit Bass’\n\nTitle VII claim to go to a jury. That same evidence would permit a reasonable jury\n\nto conclude that, despite its denials, the Division was acting pursuant to the County’s\n\naffirmative action plans when it decided to deny Bass a Training Instructor position\n\nduring the 1995 reorganization. While the mere existence of an affirmative action\n\nplan does not constitute direct evidence of discrimination, the existence of a plan\n\ncombined with other circumstances of the type present in this case make available to\n\na jury the reasonable inference that the employer was acting pursuant to the plan\n\n\n\n                                           38\n\fdespite statements to the contrary from the decisionmakers involved. Therefore,\n\ngiven the undisputed fact that the County had affirmative action plans which were in\n\neffect at the time of the actions that are the subject of this lawsuit, and given the\n\nevidence (all of which is circumstantial and some of which is disputed) that the\n\nDivision acted pursuant to those affirmative action plans, there is direct evidence of\n\ndiscrimination.\n\n              c. The Validity of the County’s Affirmative Action Plans\n\n        If it is either proven or conceded that a defendant acted pursuant to an\n\naffirmative action plan, the question then becomes whether the plan is valid under\n\nTitle VII. The validity of an affirmative action plan is judged under the following\n\ntest:\n\n        We must first determine whether the [government employer’s]\n        consideration of the race of promotional candidates was justified by a\n        manifest racial imbalance that reflected under-representation of [the\n        affirmative action plan’s beneficiaries] in traditionally segregated job\n        categories. . . . If such a justification was present when the plan was\n        developed, we must then determine whether the plan itself provides a\n        proper remedy for that imbalance. A remedy is proper if the plan does\n        not unnecessarily trammel the rights of non-black employees or create\n        an absolute bar to their advancement.\n\nIn re Birmingham Reverse Discrimination Employment Litig., 20 F.3d 1525, 1537\n\n(11th Cir. 1994) (citing Johnson, 480 U.S. at 632, 637, 107 S. Ct. at 1452, 1455).\n\n\n\n\n                                            39\n\f      In Johnson, the Supreme Court held that the burden of showing that an\n\naffirmative action plan is invalid is on the plaintiff in a Title VII case. See Johnson,\n\n480 U.S. at 626-27, 107 S. Ct. at 1449 (“As a practical matter, of course, an\n\nemployer will generally seek to avoid [a finding of invalidity] by presenting\n\nevidence in support of its plan. That does not mean, however, as petitioner suggests,\n\nthat reliance on an affirmative action plan is to be treated as an affirmative defense\n\nrequiring the employer to carry the burden of proving the validity of the plan. The\n\nburden of proving its invalidity remains on the plaintiff.”).\n\n      In reaching this decision, the Supreme Court cited only one reason for placing\n\nthe burden of proving the invalidity of an affirmative action plan on a Title VII\n\nplaintiff – that it had placed a similar burden on plaintiffs in the equal protection\n\ncontext. See 480 U.S. at 626, 107 S. Ct. at 1449 (“Only last Term, in Wygant v.\n\nJackson Board of Education, 476 U.S. 267, 277 - 278, 106 S. Ct. 1842, 1849 (1986),\n\nwe held that ‘[t]he ultimate burden remains with the employees to demonstrate the\n\nunconstitutionality of an affirmative-action program,’ and we see no basis for a\n\ndifferent rule regarding a plan’s alleged violation of Title VII.”).\n\n      In the fifteen years following the Johnson decision, much has changed in this\n\narea of the law and the change casts considerable doubt over the viability of\n\nJohnson’s holding concerning who has the burden with respect to the validity of an\n\n\n\n                                           40\n\faffirmative action plan. As the County concedes, and as we will discuss more later,\n\nthe law now is that insofar as an equal protection claim is concerned the defendant\n\nmust prove that its affirmative action plan satisfies strict scrutiny. See, e.g., City of\n\nRichmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 510-11, 109 S. Ct. 706, 730-31 (1989)\n\n(concluding that city had failed to demonstrate that the plan was supported by a\n\nstrong basis in evidence and had “failed to identify the need for remedial action”).\n\nBecause consistency in treatment of equal protection and Title VII claims was the\n\nonly reason given in Johnson for placing the burden as to the validity of the plan on\n\na Title VII plaintiff, it is likely that the Supreme Court would place the burden on the\n\ndefendant if it reconsidered the issue today. See generally Hill v. Ross, 183 F.3d\n\n586, 590 (7th Cir. 1999) (noting that Johnson was undermined by subsequent\n\ndecisions, but declining to decide whether it survived those decisions).\n\n      If it were up to us, we would follow the reasoning about consistency in\n\nJohnson and assign the burden regarding the validity of an affirmative action plan to\n\nthe same party in both the Title VII and equal protection contexts. As a practical\n\nmatter, placing the burden on different parties for purposes of Title VII and equal\n\nprotection claims is problematic, especially in cases, such as this one, where there\n\nare both Title VII and equal protection claims aimed at an affirmative action plan.\n\nPlacing the burden regarding the validity of the plan on the plaintiff as to one claim\n\n\n\n                                            41\n\fand on the defendant as to the other may cause confusion and creates the real\n\npossibility of disparate results as to the two claims in the same case involving the\n\nsame plan. Where the evidence is in equipoise, or in the more likely event that there\n\nis a failure of evidence on a factor in the analysis, the same plan could be judged\n\nvalid for Title VII purposes but invalid for equal protection purposes. The\n\npossibility of such an incongruous result would be avoided if the burdens were\n\nplaced on the same party for purposes of both types of claims.\n\n      Failing to place the burden of showing that an affirmative action plan is valid\n\non a Title VII defendant is also contrary to the trend since Johnson towards\n\nheightened, rather than relaxed, scrutiny of affirmative action plans. See, e.g.,\n\nCroson, 488 U.S. at 510-11, 109 S. Ct. at 730-31; Adarand, 515 U.S. at 227, 115 S.\n\nCt. at 2113. Cf. Bob Dylan, Subterranean Homesick Blues, on Bringing it All Back\n\nHome (Columbia 1965) (“You don’t need a weatherman to know which way the\n\nwind blows.”).\n\n      Nonetheless, we take to heart the Constitution’s description of us as one of the\n\n“inferior Courts,” Art. III, § 1, and try to follow scrupulously Supreme Court\n\nholdings. On numerous occasions, the Supreme Court has reminded us that it is its\n\n“prerogative alone to overrule one of its precedents.” United States v. Hatter, ___\n\nU.S. ___, 121 S. Ct. 1782, 1790 (2001) (citations and quotations omitted). When\n\n\n\n                                          42\n\ffaced with similar circumstances in which it appeared that a Supreme Court\n\nprecedent had been undermined by subsequent Supreme Court decisions, we\n\nrecently reasoned:\n\n       Given the severity of the blows O’Malley and Will inflicted upon Evans\n       one might suggest it is time to recognize that Evans is dead and gone.\n       The problem is that the Supreme Court has insisted on reserving to\n       itself the task of burying its own decisions. We have been told more\n       than once by it that “[i]f a precedent of this Court has direct application\n       in a case, yet appears to rest on reasons rejected in some other line of\n       decisions, the Court of Appeals should follow the case which directly\n       controls, leaving to this Court, the prerogative of overruling its own\n       decisions.”\n\nJefferson County v. Acker, 210 F.3d 1317, 1320 (11th Cir. 2000) (quoting\n\nRodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc., 490 U.S. 477, 484, 109 S.\n\nCt. 1917, 1921-22 (1997)) (citation omitted). Accordingly, we recognized in Acker\n\nour inability to inter a Supreme Court decision no matter how wounded it might\n\nappear to be in light of subsequent decisions.8 Thus, “[w]here a Supreme Court\n\ndecision that has not been overruled is squarely on point and therefore ‘directly\n\ncontrols’ the case at hand, we are to follow it even though convinced that the Court\n\nwill overturn that decision the next time it addresses the issue.” Id. What this means\n\nis unless or until the Supreme Court revisits its holding in Johnson, it is the plaintiff\n\nin an affirmative-action-based, race discrimination case who bears the burden of\n\n\n       8\n         The Supreme Court recently did inter the Evans decision, which we spoke of in Acker,\nexplicitly overruling its prior holding in Evans. See Halter, ___ U.S. at ___, 121 S. Ct. at 1793.\n\n                                                 43\n\fshowing that a plan is invalid under Title VII. On remand, in addition to\n\nshouldering the burden of proving that the County acted pursuant to its affirmative\n\naction plans, Bass also must show that the County’s affirmative action plans were\n\ninvalid in order to hold the County liable under Title VII for acting pursuant to those\n\nplans.\n\n                            5. Bass’ Equal Protection Claim\n\n         Next, we consider whether Bass’ § 1983 claim alleging an equal protection\n\nviolation should be permitted to go to a jury. As we have explained, Bass has put\n\nforth sufficient evidence in support of his Title VII claim for a reasonable jury to\n\nfind that the Division acted pursuant to the County’s affirmative action plans in\n\nfailing to offer him a Training Instructor position. We believe, based on the same\n\nevidence, that is also true for his § 1983 claim.\n\n         As with Title VII, the question then becomes whether the County’s\n\naffirmative action plans are valid under the Equal Protection Clause to the\n\nConstitution. The Supreme Court has held that “all racial classifications, imposed\n\nby whatever federal, state, or local government actor, must be analyzed by a\n\nreviewing court under strict scrutiny.” Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S.\n\n200, 227, 115 S. Ct. 2097, 2113 (1995); see also City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson\n\nCo., 488 U.S. 469, 493-94, 109 S. Ct. 706, 721-22 (1989). Strict scrutiny review\n\n\n\n                                           44\n\frequires the racial classification to serve a compelling governmental interest and be\n\nnarrowly tailored to achieve that interest. See Adarand, 515 U.S. at 227, 115 S. Ct. at\n\n2113. “[A] free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality\n\nshould tolerate no retreat from the principle that government may treat people\n\ndifferently because of their race only for the most compelling reasons.” Id. (citation\n\nand internal marks omitted). Therefore, actions pursuant to an affirmative action\n\nplan which does not satisfy strict scrutiny constitute unlawful and unconstitutional\n\ndiscrimination. See, e.g., Adarand , 515 U.S. at 227, 115 S. Ct. at 2113.\n\n      The County concedes that, in contrast to the Title VII context, Supreme Court\n\nprecedent governing equal protection claims places the burden on a defendant to\n\nprove that an affirmative action plan satisfies strict scrutiny. Up to this point, the\n\nCounty has never argued, even in the alternative, that its affirmative action plans are\n\nup to this equal protection challenge, and we do not know if it will ever do so. So, it\n\nwould be premature for us to decide whether the County has waived the right to\n\nargue that. If, on remand, the County raises this issue, it will be for the district court\n\nto decide in the first instance whether that argument is still available to the County\n\ngiven its strategy so far of denying that its plans played any role in the challenged\n\nemployment actions, or whether because of the County’s previous litigating position\n\n\n\n\n                                            45\n\fit is now precluded from asserting that the plans are valid under the Equal Protection\n\nClause.\n\n\n\n       Furthermore, if the district court permits the County to assert on remand that\n\nits affirmative action plans are valid under the Equal Protection Clause, the court\n\nwill then need to decide whether to take up the legal issue about the validity of the\n\nplans before or after the jury considers the factual issue of whether the County acted\n\npursuant to its plans. In complicated affirmative action cases like this one involving\n\nmultiple burdens assigned to different parties and requiring determinations by both\n\njudge (i.e. validity of a plan) and jury (i.e. whether defendant acted pursuant to a\n\nplan), we believe that it is best to allow a district court to decide, based on the\n\ncircumstances of the particular case, the timing and order of the proceedings.\n\nTherefore, if the County contends (for the first time) on remand that its affirmative\n\naction plans are valid under the Equal Protection Clause, the district court can decide\n\nhow and when to decide the issues related to that contention.9\n\n                                 B. RETALIATION CLAIMS\n\n\n\n       9\n         Regardless of whether the County has waived the right to assert the validity of its plans\nfor equal protection purposes, it has not done so for Title VII purposes because the burden on\nthat issue is on the Title VII plaintiff. If Bass does not carry his burden of showing the plans are\ninvalid, his Title VII claim must fail, insofar as it is based on the existence of the plans as\ndistinguished from the other evidence of discrimination.\n\n                                                  46\n\f      In addition to prohibiting employers from discriminating on the basis of race,\n\nTitle VII makes it unlawful:\n\n      for an employer to discriminate against any of his employees or\n      applicants for employment, . . . because he has opposed any practice\n      made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter [of Title\n      VII], or because he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated\n      in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this\n      subchapter [of Title VII].\n\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a). In order to establish a prima facie case of retaliation, the\n\nplaintiff must show: (1) he engaged in protected activity; (2) he suffered an adverse\n\nemployment action; and (3) there was a causal link between his protected activity\n\nand the adverse employment action. See Gupta v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 212 F.3d\n\n571, 587 (11th Cir. 2000); Farley v. Nationwide Mut. Ins., 197 F.3d 1322, 1336\n\n(11th Cir. 1999); Little v. United Technologies, 103 F.3d 956, 959 (11th Cir. 1997).\n\n      The district court assumed that Bass had established a prima facie case of\n\nretaliation, although it stated that Bass had “difficulty satisfying the third prong of\n\nthe prima facie test,” the causal link. The court then held that the County had\n\narticulated legitimate non-retaliatory reasons for its action which Bass failed to\n\nrebut, and as a result the County was entitled to summary judgment on the retaliation\n\nclaims. Bass argues that he established a prima facie case and the district court erred\n\nin holding that he had failed to present sufficient evidence to create a jury issue\n\nabout the County’s proffered reason.\n\n                                           47\n\f      We will first address Bass’ prima facie case. Bass contends that he engaged in\n\na protected activity by filing a union grievance in October 1995 in which he\n\ncomplained of racial discrimination in the hiring of the Training Instructors and by\n\nfiling a charge of discrimination with the EEOC in December 1995. We need not\n\ndecide whether the filing of the union grievance was a protected activity for anti-\n\nretaliation purposes, because the filing of the EEOC complaint clearly was, and the\n\nbulk of the allegedly retaliatory actions occurred after the filing of the EEOC\n\ncomplaint. See Berman v. Orkin Exterminating Co., 160 F.3d 697, 702 (11th Cir.\n\n1998) (holding that filing of EEOC complaint is protected activity). Bass thus\n\nsatisfied the first prong of the prima facie case of retaliation.\n\n      With respect to the second prong, Bass alleges that he suffered numerous\n\nadverse employment actions. Bass presented evidence that the following actions\n\nwere taken against him after he filed his complaints the EEOC: (1) he had no routine\n\nwork assignments; (2) he was forced to perform custodial and clerical duties, and\n\nusually was supervised by less senior personnel; (3) he was continuously denied the\n\nopportunity to earn overtime pay, on-call pay, riding-out-of classification pay, and\n\nadjunct teaching pay, which were available to other training instructors; (4) he was\n\ntransferred out of the Training Bureau in January 1997 and was not informed of his\n\nnew position until April 1997; and in April 1997, he was told to report to work in a\n\n\n\n                                            48\n\fnon-budgeted position that was not covered by the union contract; (5) he was\n\nordered to take tests to retain his paramedic pay while other Training Instructors\n\nwere not required to do so; (6) Chief Smith and Middleton ordered him not to record\n\nin his work logs the custodial and clerical work he performed; and (7) Bass’ training\n\nprograms, database files for documenting training, and graphic/multimedia material\n\nhe had developed over a five-year period were destroyed.\n\n      “An adverse employment action is an ultimate employment decision, such as\n\ndischarge or failure to hire, or other conduct that alters the employee's compensation,\n\nterms, conditions, or privileges of employment, deprives him or her of employment\n\nopportunities, or adversely affects his or her status as an employee.” Gupta, 212\n\nF.3d at 587 (citation and marks omitted). “Conduct that falls short of an ultimate\n\nemployment decision must meet ‘some threshold level of substantiality . . . to be\n\ncognizable under the anti-retaliation clause’” of Title VII. Id. (quoting Wideman v.\n\nWal-Mart Stores, Inc., 141 F.3d 1453, 1456 (11th Cir. 1998)). While “not\n\neverything that makes an employee unhappy is an actionable adverse action,” Smart\n\nv. Ball State Univ., 89 F.3d 437, 441 (7th Cir. 1996), conduct that alters an\n\nemployee’s compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment does\n\nconstitute an adverse action under Title VII. See Graham v. State Farm Mut. Ins.\n\nCo., 193 F.3d 1274, 1283 (11th Cir. 1999); Robinson v. City of Pittsburgh, 120 F.3d\n\n\n\n                                          49\n\f1286, 1300 (3d Cir. 1997). The question of whether an employee has suffered a\n\nmaterially adverse employment action will normally depend on the facts of each\n\nindividual case. See Gupta, 212 F.3d at 587.\n\n      The last two listed actions of which Bass complains – the order not to record\n\ncustodial work in his work log and the destruction of various materials – are not\n\nadverse employment actions. Those actions were not objectively “serious and\n\ntangible enough” to alter Bass’ “compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of\n\nemployment, deprive[] . . . him of employment opportunities or adversely affect . . .\n\nhis status as an employee.” Robinson, 120 F.3d at 1300 (internal marks omitted).\n\nWe do not see how being told not to record certain tasks on a work log could\n\nconstitute a serious alteration of the terms of Bass’ employment. Also, the\n\nDivision’s disposal of training programs, database files for documenting training,\n\nand graphic/multimedia material prepared by Bass in no way punished or affected\n\nBass’ employment status.\n\n      Having explained why the last two of the seven actions about which Bass\n\ncomplains were not adverse employment actions, we turn now to the remaining five.\n\nIt is undisputed that Bass was not given the same duties as the other Training\n\nInstructors. Bass was given no routine work assignments and was forced to perform\n\ncustodial and clerical duties under the supervision of less senior personnel. The\n\n\n\n                                          50\n\fDivision also denied him the opportunity to earn overtime pay, on-call pay, riding-\n\nout-of classification pay, and adjunct teaching pay, which were available to other\n\nTraining Instructors. Prior to filing his EEOC complaint alleging racial\n\ndiscrimination, Bass had been permitted to teach adjunct courses and receive pay\n\nfrom agencies other than the Division. After filing that complaint, he was not\n\nallowed to do so. In addition, Bass was ordered to take tests to maintain his\n\nparamedic pay while none of the other Training Instructors were required to do so.\n\n      We conclude that the Division’s actions which deprived Bass of compensation\n\nwhich he otherwise would have earned clearly constitute adverse employment\n\nactions for purposes of Title VII. See McCabe v. Sharrett, 12 F.3d 1558, 1564 (11th\n\nCir. 1994) (holding that employee suffered adverse job action where she had fewer\n\nresponsibilities, was made to perform more menial tasks, and had lesser opportunity\n\nfor salary increases in her new position). While the other actions might not have\n\nindividually risen to the level of adverse employment action under Title VII, when\n\nthose actions are considered collectively, the total weight of them does constitute an\n\nadverse employment action. See Wideman v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 141 F.3d 1453,\n\n1456 (11th Cir. 1998) (“It is enough to conclude, as we do, that the actions about\n\nwhich Wideman complains considered collectively are sufficient to constitute\n\n\n\n\n                                          51\n\fprohibited discrimination. We need not and do not decide whether anything less\n\nthan the totality of the alleged reprisals would be sufficient.”).\n\n      That brings us to the question of whether there is enough evidence to create a\n\ngenuine issue of material fact as to the causal connection between Bass’ participation\n\nin a protected activity and the adverse employment actions. “To establish a causal\n\nconnection, a plaintiff must show that the decisionmakers were aware of the\n\nprotected conduct, and that the protected activity and the adverse action were not\n\nwholly unrelated.” Gupta, 212 F.3d at 590 (citation and internal marks omitted); see\n\nalso Raney v. Vinson Guard Service, Inc., 120 F.3d 1192, 1197 (11th Cir. 1997) (“a\n\nplaintiff must, at a minimum, generally establish that the defendant was actually\n\naware of the protected expression at the time the defendant took the adverse\n\nemployment action”). It is not enough for the plaintiff to show that someone in the\n\norganization knew of the protected expression; instead, the plaintiff must show that\n\nthe person taking the adverse action was aware of the protected expression. See\n\nRaney, 120 F.3d at 1196. This awareness, however, may be established by\n\ncircumstantial evidence. See Goldsmith v. City of Atmore, 996 F.2d 1155, 1163\n\n(11th Cir. 1993). Close temporal proximity between the protected activity and the\n\nadverse action may be sufficient to show that the two were not wholly unrelated. See\n\nGupta, 212 F.3d at 590.\n\n\n\n                                            52\n\f       Bass filed his EEOC charge on December 19, 1995. Soon after Bass filed his\n\nEEOC complaint, he began to suffer adverse employment actions. The close\n\ntemporal proximity between filing of the EEOC complaint and the adverse actions is\n\nsufficient in this case to satisfy the third prong of the prima facie case of retaliation.\n\nSee generally Gupta, 212 F.3d at 590. Thus, Bass established a prima facie case of\n\ndiscrimination.\n\n       The burden then shifts to the County to set forth a legitimate, non-retaliatory\n\nreason for its actions. The Fire and Rescue Division’s only reason for not assigning\n\nBass Training Instructor duties was that there was no vacant district to which to\n\nassign him. The County contends that the head of the Training Bureau, Chief\n\nWillard Smith, decided to keep three districts, instead of creating a fourth. It also\n\nmaintains that Smith decided that only one Training Instructor should serve each\n\ndistrict.\n\n       Bass argues that the County’s articulated reason is insufficient because it\n\naddresses only the failure to assign Bass Training Instructor duties and not the other\n\nalleged retaliatory actions such as being placed in a non-union job and not being\n\nallowed overtime pay. Bass further argues that he has shown that the County’s one-\n\ninstructor-per-district defense is pretext because the Fire and Rescue Division failed\n\nto place Bass in the Training Instructor position that became vacant in the spring of\n\n\n\n                                            53\n\f1998 and was still vacant as of November 1998. Middleton confirmed the existence\n\nof the vacancy.\n\n       We agree that the County failed to negate the existence of a genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact concerning a causal connection between all of the adverse actions and\n\nBass’ filing of the EEOC complaint. The County only addressed one part of the\n\nretaliation: the failure to assign Training Instructor duties to Bass. While the “no\n\nvacant district” argument may explain his lack of Training Instructor duties and thus\n\nthe imposition of clerical duties, it does not explain other adverse employment\n\nactions such as Bass’ transfer to a non-union job, his being denied the opportunity to\n\nteach outside courses, and the testing requirement placed on Bass and not others.\n\nThe County does not attempt to explain those other actions, nor does it explain why\n\nBass was not assigned to the Training Instructor position that became available in\n\nthe spring of 1998. The district court thus erred in granting the County’s motion for\n\nsummary judgment.10\n\n\n       10\n         Although Bass presented no separate arguments in support of his claims under the\nFlorida Civil Rights Act, for the same reasons that we reverse the grant of summary judgement\nas to Bass’ retaliation claim under Title VII, we also reverse as to his parallel claim under the\nFlorida Civil Rights Act. See supra n.4.\n\n         With respect to Bass’ § 1981 retaliation claim, the situation is less clear. We have\npreviously noted that whether the elements of Title VII and § 1981 retaliation claims are the\nsame is an “open question” in this Circuit. See Olmsted v. Taco Bell Corp., 141 F.3d 1457, 1463\nn.4 (11th Cir. 1998). However, the parties have not raised or argued that issue before us, so we\nwill not attempt to decide it now. If the issue is raised and preserved on remand and survives the\njury trial, it can be addressed in any subsequent appeal.\n\n                                                 54\n\f                               IV. CONCLUSION\n\n      We hold that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to the\n\nCounty on Bass’ Title VII, § 1981, and Florida Civil Rights Act race discrimination\n\nand retaliation claims, and on his § 1983 equal protection claim. Accordingly, we\n\nREVERSE the district court’s grant of summary judgment to the County and\n\nREMAND for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.\n\n      REVERSED and REMANDED.\n\n\n\n\n                                         55\n\f",

Bass appeals the district court’s order granting summary\n\njudgment to the Board of County Commissioners of Orange County in his lawsuit\n\nclaiming race discrimination in violation of Title VII and the Equal Protection\n\nClause, as well as retaliation in violation of Title VII. For the reasons set forth\n\nbelow, we reverse and remand for a jury trial on his race discrimination and\n\nretaliation claims.\n\n                                I. BACKGROUND\n\n                                       A. Facts\n\n      In August 1995, the Orange County Fire and Rescue Division (the\n\n“Division” or “Fire and Rescue Division”) began a reorganization of its workforce\n\nas a result of a $9 million budget shortfall. A number of positions were eliminated,\n\nincluding all four Training Captain positions, one of which was held by Michael\n\nBass, the white male plaintiff in this case. Like the other three people employed in\n\nthat position, Bass received a layoff notice in September 1995.\n\n\n                                           2\n\f      The four Captain-level positions that were eliminated were replaced with\n\nthree Lieutenant-level Training Instructor positions. Bass applied for one of those\n\nthree positions. In order to become a Training Instructor, the County specified that\n\na person must have “two years training instructor or closely related work\n\nexperience” and “must possess and maintain a valid Florida Department of\n\nEducation Teacher’s Certificate or obtain [one] within 18 months of employment.”\n\nBass’ qualifications exceeded those minimums. Moreover, according to Frank\n\nMontes de Oca, who was Chief in Charge of Training at the Division, as a training\n\ninstructor Bass “was an excellent employee who constantly received good or\n\noutstanding evaluations.” He was first or second in seniority among instructors,\n\nand, under terms of the union contract, should have been the last or next to last to\n\nbe laid off in the event of a reduction in force.\n\n      All qualified persons, including those who had been laid off, were allowed\n\nto apply for the three Training Instructor positions. The Fire and Rescue Division\n\nused a Performance Based Interview system to select candidates for various\n\npositions, including the Training Instructor positions. In that type of interview,\n\ncandidates are asked pre-selected questions to test their responses to hypothetical\n\nsituations they may face on the job. The candidates are expected to respond by\n\nexplaining what they have done in similar situations.\n\n\n                                           3\n\f      A three-member panel interviewed Bass and twelve other applicants for the\n\nthree Training Instructor positions. The members of the interview panel were\n\nCharles Middleton (black male), Ray Valle (Hispanic male), and Betty Meeks\n\n(black female). At the time of the reorganization, Middleton was the Acting\n\nAssistant Department Manager in charge of Administration and had supervisory\n\nresponsibility over the Division’s Training Instructors. He was also a member of\n\nthe Progressive Firefighters Association, an advocacy organization for black\n\nfirefighters, and he was known to support affirmative action and a promotional\n\n“fast track” for minorities.\n\n      Middleton testified that he selected Meeks and Valle for the interview panel\n\nand that, in doing so, he “[t]ried to select people who had little or no involvement\n\nwith the training function” so that they would have had nothing at stake in the\n\nDivision’s reorganization. Meeks was employed in the County’s Human\n\nResources Department, and admits that she had no knowledge beyond that of a lay\n\nperson concerning the position of fire department training instructor. She was also\n\nknown to be a supporter of affirmative action. Although Valle was employed by\n\nthe Division, he worked as an information technology specialist and had no\n\ntraining in firefighting. Nothing in the record indicates Valle’s views on\n\n\n\n\n                                          4\n\faffirmative action. Therefore, with the possible exception of Middleton,1 none of\n\nthe panel members was a certified firefighter in Florida, nor had any panel member\n\nheld a Training Instructor position.\n\n       Not only did the panel members lack experience as Training Instructors,\n\nnone of them was given any training or guidelines (other than general training\n\nconcerning interview skills) to help them evaluate which candidates were best\n\nqualified for the positions. Remarkably, none of them received any job description\n\nshowing the duties of a Training Instructor. Nor did any of them receive the\n\ninterview questions until just before the start of the interviews. They were not told\n\nto take notes of the interviews, and none of them did.\n\n       Mitch Floyd, who was Chief of the Fire and Rescue Division from 1989\n\nuntil April 1995, stated in his affidavit that the County had adopted the interview\n\nprocess “to create some leeway to allow us to promote minority candidates.” He\n\nstated under oath that the interview score was not supposed to be determinative,\n\nbut was meant to be only one of several factors, including education, experience,\n\n\n\n       1\n        The record is less clear with respect to Middleton’s experience and credentials. The\nrecord seems to indicate that Middleton was not a certified firefighter in the State of Florida.\nFurthermore, although the record shows that Middleton had supervisory responsibility over the\nDivision’s Training Instructors, nothing in the record indicates that Middleton had any personal\nexperience as a Training Instructor. Given the procedural posture, of course, we are required to\nview the facts in the light most favorable to the non-movant, Bass. Viewing the evidence that\nway, Middleton was not a certified firefighter and had no experience as a Training Instructor.\n\n                                                5\n\fand diversity (i.e., race and gender) that were to be considered. The County’s\n\nwritten policy specifically stated that scores were not to be totaled and that the\n\ninterview was only one component to be considered. Similarly, Tom Preston (not\n\nrelated to one of the candidates, Henry Preston), who developed the interview\n\nprocess for the Training Instructor position, stated that the interview scores were\n\nnot intended to be determinative. The interviews for the Training Instructor\n\npositions took place in October 1995. After the panel finished interviewing all the\n\ncandidates, the panel members combined their individual scores for each candidate\n\nand then ranked the candidates based on their aggregate interview scores. The\n\npanel ranked Bass ninth out of the thirteen applicants. Middleton and Valle\n\ntestified that Bass did not answer the questions that were asked and did not\n\ninterview as well as expected considering his experience as a training officer.\n\n(Meeks was not questioned about Bass interview performance during her\n\ndeposition.) Contrary to the written policy and all the testimony about how the\n\ninterview results were to be used, selections for the Training Instructor position\n\nwere made solely on the basis of the interview scores.2 Because Bass received a\n\n      2\n          The interview scores were as follows:\n\nName                  Previously Supervisor           Score   Selected   Race\nGina McCollum                Yes            16          X           W\nDan Kucik                    No             15                      W\nDonna Reed                   Yes            13          X           W\n\n                                                  6\n\flow score on the interview, the panel did not choose him for one of the three\n\nTraining Instructor positions. Instead, the panel chose three of the applicants\n\nwhom it had given higher interview scores: a black male and two white females.\n\n       Henry Preston, the black candidate selected for one of the three Training\n\nInstructor positions, did not even meet the minimum qualifications for the position.\n\nHis resume reflected that he had no experience as a Training Instructor and only\n\ntwo years of experience as a firefighter, even though one of the minimum\n\nrequirements for a Training Instructor position was “two (2) years training\n\ninstructor or closely related work experience.” Moreover, Preston misrepresented\n\nhis qualifications both on his general employment application and on his Training\n\nInstructor application. Although Preston represented on those documents that he\n\n\nHenry Preston                No             13        X           B\nDavid Cohen                  No             12                    W\nKaren Barber                 No             12                    W\nHenry Butts                  No             11                    W\nJohn Russell                 Yes            10                    B\nMichael Bass                 Yes             8                    W\nVictoria Quick               No              7                    W\nStephen Manning              No              5                    W\nThomas Wheeler               No              4                    W\nTerry Boston                 No              4                    W\n\nThe candidate with the second-highest score, Dan Kucik, was selected for (and accepted) the\nhigher-ranking position of Group Supervisor. The Group Supervisors were chosen through a\nseparate selection process which involved different PBI interviews. Therefore, Kucik’s\nperformance during his Training Instructor interview does not account for his selection as a\nGroup Supervisor. John Russell (black male), who ranked eighth in the Training Instructor\ninterview was also selected as a Group Supervisor. Bass applied for a Group Supervisor\nposition, but was not selected.\n\n                                                 7\n\fattended the University of Central Florida for three years as an accounting major\n\nand earned 94 credits there, he had never attended that university. Preston testified\n\nin his deposition that the County’s Human Resources Department knew he had\n\n“exaggerated” his educational credits. Initially he had submitted an application\n\nwhich truthfully showed he lacked the necessary qualifications, but someone from\n\nHuman Resources told him that his application needed to be changed before it\n\nwould be accepted. Taking the suggestion, Preston submitted a second application,\n\nand this one falsely stated he had attended the University of Central Florida. It was\n\nonly on the basis of that lie about his qualifications, a lie he testified the County\n\nhad encouraged, that Henry Preston was judged to be qualified for a Training\n\nInstructor position.\n\n      After being denied a Training Instructor position for which he was\n\nindisputably qualified, Bass was given the choice of being demoted to\n\nengineer/paramedic or being laid-off. He took the demotion. In October 1995,\n\nBass filed a union grievance challenging his demotion and removal from training\n\nduties. On November 17, 1995, while his grievance was pending, Bass complained\n\nto the Division Chief James Moody that Henry Preston lacked the necessary\n\nqualifications for the Training Instructor position. Bass recorded the events in his\n\ndiary, writing as follows:\n\n\n                                           8\n\f      Met with Moody. . . . Advised him that Preston, Reed and Kucik did\n      not have an A.S. degree, only high school degree and Reed had a\n      GED and Preston did not qualify for training position. Witnessed by\n      Wertz and Angel Gonzales. Moody advised me that the County will\n      continue to promote based on color and that I should file legal action\n      against the County.\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n        In December 1995, the County settled Bass’ union grievance without a\n\nhearing by reassigning him to be a fourth Training Instructor. Bass was given the\n\njob title, rank, and pay of a Training Instructor, but he was not assigned to a district\n\nand was not permitted to perform the duties of a Training Instructor. Before the\n\nreorganization, there were four Training Instructors, each holding the rank of\n\nCaptain, assigned to cover five battalions. After the reorganization, there were\n\nthree Training Instructors, each holding the rank of Lieutenant, assigned to cover\n\nthree districts (as the battalions were renamed). One Training Instructor was\n\nassigned to each of the three districts. As a result, when the Division finally made\n\nBass a Training Instructor he was the fourth one, and there was no vacant district\n\nto assign him.\n\n      In December 1995, on his first day as a Training Instructor, Bass was\n\nassigned to clean out a warehouse – work ordinarily done by inmates supplied by\n\nthe Department of Corrections. Between December 1995 and April 1996, Bass had\n\nno routine work assignments, performed custodial and clerical duties, and usually\n\n                                           9\n\fwas supervised by personnel who were less senior than he. Middleton, who was\n\nin charge of the Training Instructors, and Chief Smith ordered Bass not to record\n\non his work logs the custodial and clerical work he was performing.\n\n      Bass’ non-custodial assignments included working with the Division’s\n\nEmergency Medical Services unit, working on the Community Health Care\n\nInitiative, teaching CPR for Head-start day care workers, and assisting other\n\nTraining Instructors in developing training programs. Bass was not permitted to\n\nearn overtime pay, on-call pay, riding-out-of-classification pay, or adjunct teaching\n\npay, all of which were available to the other Training Instructors. Although he\n\npreviously had been permitted to teach numerous outside courses, such as a SWAT\n\nteam tactical rope course offered at various law enforcement agencies, in his\n\nposition as Training Instructor Bass was denied all opportunities to teach outside\n\ncourses. He also was required to take tests in order to retain his paramedic pay,\n\nwhile the three other training instructors were not.\n\n      In January 1997, Bass was transferred out of the Training Bureau without\n\neven being told of the transfer. He learned of the transfer upon returning from\n\nvacation and discovering that his paycheck was no longer available in the Training\n\nBureau and that he was no longer on that bureau’s payroll. From January until\n\nApril of 1997, Bass did not know where he had been transferred or to whom he\n\n\n                                          10\n\fwas to report. In April 1997, he was told to report for work in a non-budgeted\n\nposition that was not covered by the union contract. After the union complained,\n\nBass was allowed to keep his Training Instructor title, and he was given a\n\ntemporary assignment under Chief Weagraff in Quality Assurance. In the spring\n\nof 1998, one of the three budgeted Training Instructor positions became available,\n\nbut it was not given to Bass. In fact, it was never filled. At least as late as\n\nFebruary 1999, Bass was still temporarily assigned to Chief Weagraff.\n\n                                    B. Procedural History\n\n       Bass filed a ten-count complaint against the County on March 31, 1997. The\n\ncomplaint contained race discrimination claims under Title VI of the Civil Rights\n\nAct of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d, et seq.; Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\n\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq.; 42 U.S.C. § 1981; 42 U.S.C. § 1983; the Equal\n\nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution;\n\nand the Florida Civil Rights Act of 1992, Fla. Stat. chs. 760.01-760.11. The\n\ncomplaint also contained retaliation claims under Title VII; 42 U.S.C. § 1981; the\n\nFlorida Civil Rights Act of 1992, Fla. Stat. chs. 760.01-760.11; the First\n\nAmendment to the United States Constitution; and a claim under Florida’s\n\nveterans’ preference statutes, Fla. Stat. §§ 295.07 & 295.085.3\n\n       3\n          On appeal, Bass does not challenge the district court’s rulings on his Title VI or\nveterans’ preference claims, but argues that the district court erred in granting summary\n\n                                                11\n\f       The County moved for summary judgment. With respect to the race\n\ndiscrimination claims, the County proffered as its reason for not giving Bass one\n\nof the Training Instructor positions his poor performance on the Performance\n\nBased Interview. With respect to Bass’ retaliation claims, the County argued that\n\nBass could not establish a prima facie case of retaliation, and that even if he could,\n\nhe could not refute the County’s asserted legitimate reason for its actions – he was\n\nnot given Training Instructor duties because there was not an open district. The\n\ndistrict court entered an order granting summary judgment to the County as to all\n\ncounts in the complaint.\n\n                              II.

DISCUSSION\n\n                      A. RACE DISCRIMINATION CLAIMS\n\n      In his complaint, Bass alleges that the County discriminated against him\n\nbased on his race (non-Hispanic, white) in violation of Title VII, § 1981, § 1983,\n\nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and the Florida Civil\n\nRights Act. Sometimes this type of claim, where a white employee alleges to be\n\nthe victim of discrimination, is referred to as a “reverse discrimination” claim.\n\nWhatever the rhetorical effect of that phrase in the ongoing public debate over\n\naffirmative action may be, it has no place in the legal analysis of the alleged\n\ngovernmental action before us. Discrimination is discrimination no matter what\n\nthe race, color, religion, sex, or national origin of the victim. See McDonald v.\n\nSante Fe Trail Transp.

Because claims under Title VII and the Equal Protection Clause are\n\ndistinct and the Supreme Court has instructed us that different standards are\n\napplicable to them, we will address these claims separately.\n\n                              1. Title VII Framework\n\n      Title VII makes it an unlawful employment practice for an employer \"to fail\n\nor refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise discriminate against\n\nany individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of\n\nemployment, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national\n\norigin.\" 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a). Bass alleges that the County violated Title VII by\n\nrefusing to hire him for the Training Instructor position because he is a non-\n\nHispanic, white person.\n\n      A plaintiff may establish a Title VII claim through the introduction of direct\n\nevidence of discrimination or through circumstantial evidence that creates an\n\ninference of discrimination. To evaluate Title VII claims based on circumstantial\n\nevidence, we use the familiar framework established in McDonnell Douglas Corp.\n\nv.

The dispute in this case concerns whether Bass has\n\nalso presented direct evidence of discrimination, and, if not, whether he has put\n\nforth sufficient circumstantial evidence that the County’s proffered non-\n\ndiscriminatory reason for its actions (i.e., Bass’ poor performance during his\n\ninterview) was pretextual.

Bass testified that he confronted\n\nChief Moody about the promotion of employees who lacked the necessary\n\nqualifications for the Training Instructor position, and Moody responded that the\n\nCounty would continue to promote based on color. We agree with the district\n\ncourt that this statement does not rise to the level of direct evidence of\n\ndiscrimination by the Division.\n\n      Direct evidence of discrimination is “evidence which, if believed, would\n\nprove the existence of a fact [in issue] without inference or presumption.” Earley\n\nv.

However, Bass presented no evidence showing that Moody was\n\na decisionmaker or involved in the selection of the Training Instructors. Although\n\nBass attaches significance to the fact that Moody was the chief at the time of the\n\ndecision, the fact remains that Moody was not a member of the interview panel and\n\nwas not involved in the selection process. Only statements by the persons involved\n\nin the decisionmaking process, here the interview panel members, could constitute\n\ndirect evidence of discrimination. Therefore, although Moody’s statements may\n\nprovide significant circumstantial support for Bass’ claims, they do not constitute\n\ndirect evidence of discrimination. See Standard, 161 F.3d at 1330.\n\n            3. Circumstantial Evidence Supporting the Title VII Claim\n\n      Even though Chief Moody’s statements are not direct evidence of\n\ndiscrimination, we believe that Bass has put forth ample circumstantial evidence of\n\ndiscrimination to permit his Title VII, § 1981 and Florida Civil Rights Act claims\n\n\n                                         19\n\fto go to a jury. In addition, for the reasons explained in section 4, infra, we find\n\nthat the County’s affirmative action plans, when viewed in light of the\n\ncircumstantial evidence which would allow a reasonable jury to conclude that the\n\nDivision was acting pursuant to those plans, do constitute direct evidence of racial\n\ndiscrimination against Bass. Therefore, we conclude that the district court erred in\n\nentering summary judgment against Bass’ Title VII race discrimination claims.\n\n      It is undisputed that Bass established a prima facie case of race\n\ndiscrimination under the McDonnell Douglas framework. Consequently, a\n\npresumption of discrimination arose and the burden shifted to the County to proffer\n\na legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for not hiring Bass. See Combs, 106 F. 3d\n\nat 1527-28. To meet that burden of production, the County proffered one reason, a\n\nsubjective one, for not hiring Bass for a Training Instructor position. The County\n\nclaimed that Bass did not score as well on his interview (purportedly the only\n\nselection criterion used) as the other candidates selected for the position.\n\n      This Court recently reaffirmed that a subjective reason for an employer’s\n\naction – such as poor interview performance – can be as legitimate as any other\n\nreason. See Chapman v. AI Transport, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770803\"><a href=\"/opinion/770803/john-d-chapman-v-ai-transport/\"><span class=\"volume\">229</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1012</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1033 (11th Cir. 2000) (en\n\nbanc). An interview is frequently necessary to assess qualities that are particularly\n\nimportant in supervisory or professional positions. Id. at 1033. This is because\n\n\n                                          20\n\f“[t]raits such as common sense, good judgment, originality, ambition, loyalty, and\n\ntact often must be assessed primarily in a subjective fashion.” Id. at 1034 (internal\n\nmarks and citations omitted). However, in order for a subjective reason to\n\nconstitute a legally sufficient, legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason, the defendant\n\nmust articulate “a clear and reasonably specific factual basis upon which it based\n\nits subjective opinion.” Id.; see also Burdine, 450 U.S. at 258, 101 S. Ct. at 1096\n\n(“[T]he defendant’s explanation of its legitimate reasons must be clear and\n\nreasonably specific” so that “the plaintiff be afforded a ‘full and fair opportunity’\n\nto demonstrate pretext.”).\n\n      Although the proffered reason, Bass’ poor interview, was subjective, the\n\nCounty offered explanations of why the interview panel, the decisionmakers,\n\narrived at that subjective conclusion. Valle stated that Bass “did not interview\n\nanywhere near as well as [he] expected him to” and observed that Bass “didn’t\n\nanswer the questions that [the interviewers] were asking.” Middleton opined that\n\nBass “could have presented himself better” and that Bass gave “answers\n\nirrespective of the questions.” Bass’ testimony does not contradict the panel\n\nmembers’ assessment of his interview performance. Bass stated that he “had the\n\nimpression that [the interview] was just some kind of a go-through-the-motion\n\nthing.” Although Bass admitted that he did not perform well during the interview,\n\n\n                                          21\n\fhe claimed that his poor performance was caused by Middleton’s interrupting him\n\nwhile he was trying to answer the questions. Middleton did not recall interrupting\n\nBass during the interview, but Valle testified that if a candidate was “headed in the\n\nwrong direction” the interviewers would “try and help” the candidate by\n\n“clarify[ing] what it was [they] were looking for.”\n\n      Because the interviewers explained the grounds for their subjective\n\nevaluation with reasonable clarity and specificity, the County met its burden of\n\nproducing a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for not hiring Bass as a Training\n\nInstructor. After the County articulated this reason, the burden shifted back to\n\nBass to present sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of fact that the\n\nCounty’s non-discriminatory reason was pretext for discrimination. In response,\n\nBass argued that: (1) the County encouraged employees to hire and promote based\n\non race and established a system for hiring and promotion which created leeway so\n\nthat minorities could advance more easily; (2) Chief Moody said that the County\n\nwas going to continue to promote on the basis of color; (3) Preston, the black\n\ncandidate selected as a Training Instructor, did not meet the minimal qualifications\n\nfor the position; (4) the Fire and Rescue Division deviated from its established\n\nprocedures and the interview process was otherwise tainted; and last, but not least,\n\n\n\n\n                                          22\n\f(5) the County had in place affirmative action plans with the goal of increasing\n\nminority representation within the Division.\n\n                   a. Pressure to Hire and Promote Minorities\n\n      With respect to Bass’ first pretext argument, he introduced evidence of\n\ncounty officials’ emphasis on hiring and promoting based upon race. Montes de\n\nOca, Chief of the Fire and Rescue Division from 1990 though 1997, testified that\n\nhe was pressured to hire more minorities and that he had received periodic reports\n\nshowing the number of women and blacks in all positions. Mitch Floyd, Chief of\n\nthe Division from 1989 until April 1, 1995, testified that managers’ success or\n\nfailure in meeting the County’s affirmative action goals “could adversely affect\n\ntheir future as managers,” and that the County Administrator, County Chairwoman,\n\nand the County Commission regularly communicated this to the Division\n\nmanagers. From that evidence a jury could reasonably find the County had a\n\npolicy of racial discrimination against non-Hispanic whites.\n\n      Bass also presented evidence that the interview system, the same system that\n\nwas used in hiring the Training Instructors, was used to carry out the affirmative\n\naction plans’ goals of emphasizing race in hiring decisions, i.e., the policy of racial\n\ndiscrimination against non-Hispanic whites. Floyd, who developed the interview\n\nsystem for the Training Instructor and Group Supervisor positions and who was a\n\n\n                                          23\n\fmember of the Group Supervisor interview panel, testified that Performance Based\n\ninterviews were adopted as a subjective evaluation process that would create\n\n“leeway” in promoting minorities because the County “didn’t have the time or\n\nvacancies to wait out the gradual improvement of skills.”\n\n      This evidence of pressure in the County to hire minorities over non-\n\nminorities, combined with the existence of an interview system adopted in order to\n\ncreate leeway to promote minorities, constitutes circumstantial evidence of\n\ndiscriminatory intent behind the Division’s hiring decisions.\n\n       b. Chief Moody’s Statement Concerning Race-Based Promotion\n\n      As to his second pretext argument, Bass testified that when he confronted\n\nChief Moody about Henry Preston’s lacking the requisite qualifications, Moody\n\ntold him that the County would continue to promote on the basis of color. As we\n\nhave already said, because Bass did not introduce sufficient evidence establishing\n\nthat Moody was a decisionmaker, his statement cannot constitute direct evidence of\n\ndiscrimination. Nonetheless, this statement does constitute circumstantial evidence\n\nof discrimination because it raises the inference that the Training Instructor\n\ninterview panel members improperly based their decisions on race, rather than\n\nperformance during the interview or other legitimate criteria.\n\n\n\n\n                                          24\n\f                    c. Promotion of Less-Qualified Candidate\n\n      In support of his third pretext argument, Bass presented evidence that he was\n\nthe most qualified applicant for the position and that Preston did not even meet the\n\nminimum qualifications for the position. At the time he applied for the Training\n\nInstructor position, Preston’s resume reflected that he had no experience as a\n\nTraining Instructor and only two years of experience with the Fire and Rescue\n\nDivision and had earned no credits toward his teaching certificate. It should have\n\nbeen obvious on the face of Preston’s application that he could not meet the\n\nmandatory criterion of obtaining a Florida teaching certification within 18 months\n\nof being promoted and that he lacked the requisite two years of Training Instructor\n\nexperience.\n\n      Hiring a less qualified person can support an inference of discriminatory\n\nmotivation.

Fulton County, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"74381\"><a href=\"/opinion/74381/alexander-v-fulton-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">207</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1303</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1340 (11th Cir.\n\n2000) (“both the Supreme Court and this court have observed that evidence\n\nshowing an employer hired a less qualified applicant over the plaintiff may be\n\nprobative of whether the employer's proffered reason for not promoting plaintiff\n\nwas pretextual”); Walker v.

Here, the fact that the Division\n\npromoted Preston, an employee who was unqualified under the Division’s criteria,\n\nover Bass supports an inference of discrimination. This inference is further\n\nstrengthened by Chief Moody’s statement that the County would continue to\n\npromote based on race and by other circumstantial evidence of discrimination.\n\n                     d. Deviation from Standard Procedure\n\n      In support of his fourth pretext argument, Bass presented evidence indicating\n\nthat the Fire and Rescue Division departed from its standard procedure when it\n\ninterviewed the applicants for the Training Instructor positions. Tom Preston, who\n\ndeveloped the interview process for the Training Instructor and Group Supervisor\n\npositions, testified that interview scores were not intended to be determinative, and\n\nthe interview policy specifically stated that scores were not to be totaled and that\n\nthe interview was only one component to be considered. The policy, which was\n\nidentified in deposition by Valle, included the following instructions:\n\n      NOTE: Do not total scores. This process is intended to develop a\n      profile, highlighting a candidate’s areas of strength and weakness.\n      This process was designed as one component to be used in\n      conjunction with other criteria to determine a final selection.\n\nThe Division violated these written procedures by totaling the scores and relying\n\nexclusively upon the interviews. An employer’s violation of its own normal\n\n                                          26\n\fhiring procedure may be evidence of pretext. See Hill v. Seaboard Coast Line\n\nR.R., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"529399\"><a href=\"/opinion/529399/andrew-l-hill-roosevelt-coleman-jr-joe-l-lock-walter-j-jones-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">885</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">804</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 811 (11th Cir. 1989). We believe that this is especially true\n\nwhere, as here, an employer disregards all but one of the factors and qualifications\n\ngenerally taken into consideration and relies solely on a factor which was designed\n\nto create “leeway” for the promotion of people of a certain race.\n\n      Furthermore, other facts surrounding the interview process used in selecting\n\nthe Training Instructors indicate that the process was suspect. For example, the\n\ninterviewers, who were the sole decisionmakers, received no training or guidelines\n\nto help them evaluate which candidates were best qualified for the Training\n\nInstructor positions. The interviewers were supposed to evaluate the applicants’\n\nresponses to certain situations to determine which candidates would make the best\n\nTraining Instructors, yet the interviewers were never even informed of what duties\n\na Training Instructor had. Although Middleton testified that he had at some time\n\nreceived training in the interview process itself, he said he received no training\n\nwith respect to the specific qualifications to look for when interviewing the\n\nTraining Instructor applicants. Valle, another member of the Training Instructor\n\ninterview panel, testified that he knew very little about firefighter training at the\n\ntime he served on the panel. Meeks, the final member of the Training Instructor\n\ninterview panel, testified that she had no knowledge of firefighting or training\n\n\n                                           27\n\fwhen she served on the panel. Furthermore, despite the fact that the panel\n\nmembers were called upon to judge the applicants’ qualifications to be Training\n\nInstructors, Middleton, who chose the other two panel members, testified that he\n\n“[t]ried to select people who had little or no involvement with the training\n\nfunction.”\n\n      We recognize that “a defendant may terminate an employee for a good or\n\nbad reason without violating federal law” and “[w]e are not in the business of\n\nadjudging whether employment decisions are prudent or fair.” Damon v. Fleming\n\nSupermarkets of Florida, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">196</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1354</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1361 (11th Cir. 1999). We are,\n\nhowever, in the business of adjudging whether an employer violated Title VII by\n\nimproperly making employment decisions based on race. In this case, the selection\n\nprocess employed by the Division, when viewed in light of the other evidence of\n\nthe County’s race-conscious hiring and promotion efforts, constituted\n\ncircumstantial evidence that the Division was acting with race in mind while\n\nselecting Training Instructors, and that is so even without any consideration of the\n\nCounty’s formal affirmative action plans.\n\n                    e. The County’s Affirmative Action Plans\n\n      The last category of evidence that the proffered interview reason was pretext\n\nis the County’s affirmative action plans, which were in effect at the time that the\n\n\n                                          28\n\fFire and Rescue Division refused Bass a Training Instructor position. As we will\n\nexplain in the next section, we think the County’s affirmative action plans – unless\n\nthose plans are valid – are actually direct evidence of unlawful discrimination.\n\n                                        f. Conclusion\n\n       We conclude that the evidence offered by Bass was more than sufficient to\n\nraise a genuine issue of material fact about whether the County’s articulated\n\nnondiscriminatory reason for not hiring him was pretextual. The county officials’\n\nemphasis on promoting employees based upon race, the statement by Chief Moody\n\nconcerning race-conscious efforts, the Division’s deviation from procedures, the\n\nhiring of an unqualified candidate instead of Bass, who was qualified, provide\n\nmore than enough evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude that the County’s\n\nproffered non-discriminatory explanation for its actions was pretextual. The\n\ndistrict court erred when it granted summary judgment in favor of the County on\n\nBass’ race discrimination claims under Title VII, § 1981 and the Florida Civil\n\nRights Act.4\n\n       4\n        Although Bass has presented no separate arguments in support of his claims under the\nFlorida Civil Rights Act, we have recognized that “decisions construing Title VII are applicable\nwhen considering claims under the Florida Civil Rights Act. . . . ” Harper v.

Therefore, for the same reasons that we reverse the grant of\nsummary judgement as to Bass’ Title VII race discrimination claim, we also reverse as to his\nrace discrimination claims brought under the Florida Civil Rights Act and § 1981.\n\n                                               29\n\f                 4. Direct Evidence Supporting the Title VII Claim\n\n      We now turn to the consideration of the County’s affirmative action plans as\n\ndirect evidence of discrimination supporting Bass’ Title VII, § 1981 and Florida\n\nCivil Rights Act claims. The affirmative action issues in this case arise in a\n\nsomewhat unusual posture. In a typical Title VII case involving an affirmative\n\naction plan, an employer asserts in response to a plaintiff’s prima facie showing of\n\ndiscrimination that its employment decision was made pursuant to an affirmative\n\naction plan and that its compliance with such a plan was a legitimate,\n\nnondiscriminatory reason for its actions. See, e.g., Johnson v. Transportation\n\nAgency, Santa Clara County, Calif., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111846\"><a href=\"/opinion/111846/johnson-v-transportation-agency-santa-clara-cty/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">616</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 626-27, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111846\"><a href=\"/opinion/111846/johnson-v-transportation-agency-santa-clara-cty/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The question in those circumstances is whether the employer’s affirmative\n\naction plan is valid.\n\n      In this case, the County has sought no cover from its affirmative action plans\n\n(and, in fact, seems to distance itself from them), and it is Bass who relies on the\n\nCounty’s affirmative action plans in support of his claims. Of course, a defendant\n\nwho in fact acts pursuant to an affirmative action plan cannot avoid judicial review\n\nof the plan by disavowing reliance upon it, where there is evidence that the plan\n\nplayed a part in the employment decision.\n\n\n\n\n                                          30\n\f      The first step in ascertaining whether the County can be held liable for\n\ndiscrimination as a result of its affirmative action plans is a determination of\n\nwhether there is sufficient evidence that it acted pursuant to those plans. The mere\n\nexistence of an affirmative action plan by itself does not constitute direct evidence\n\nof discrimination unless there is also evidence that the employer acted pursuant to\n\nthe plan in making employment decisions.

Although we did not rule out that such a finding of liability might be\nappropriate in some cases, we noted that an affirmative action plan “does not necessarily offend\nthe equal protection clause,” and remanded that case for a determination of whether the\naffirmative action plan passed muster under strict scrutiny analysis. Id. Our analysis in Thigpen\nleaves open the possibility, however, that summary judgment as to liability for discrimination\nmight be appropriate where there is no dispute over whether a defendant was acting pursuant to\nan affirmative action plan, if a district court determines that the affirmative action plan is invalid\n\n                                                  32\n\f      a. Meaning of “Direct Evidence” in Context of Discrimination Claim\n\n       For the reasons that follow, we hold that where there is an invalid affirmative\n\naction plan in effect relating to the employer’s allegedly discriminatory actions, that\n\nplan constitutes direct evidence of discrimination if there is sufficient circumstantial\n\nevidence to permit a jury reasonably to conclude the employer acted pursuant to the\n\nplan when it took the employment actions in question.\n\n       Because we believe that the term has been a source of confusion, we begin by\n\ndiscussing the meaning of “direct evidence” in the context of a Title VII race\n\ndiscrimination claim. First, we note that the phrase “direct evidence,” when used in\n\nthe context of discrimination claims, does not refer to whether evidence is direct or\n\ncircumstantial in the ordinary evidentiary sense in which we normally think of those\n\nterms. Instead, “direct evidence” refers to a type of evidence which, if true, would\n\nrequire no inferential leap in order for a court to find discrimination. We do not\n\nbelieve that the status of evidence as “direct” in this context, however, changes\n\nsimply because a defendant contests the validity of the evidence, thereby requiring\n\nthe plaintiff to offer proof related to the disputed evidence through other means.\n\n\n\n\nunder Title VII and the Equal Protection Clause.\n\n                                               33\n\fTherefore, an affirmative action plan may constitute direct evidence, even when a\n\ndefendant denies having acted pursuant to its stated plan.7\n\n\n\n\n       7\n         The County argues that affirmative action plans should be considered circumstantial,\ninstead of direct, evidence. It points out that Johnson applied the McDonnell Douglas burden-\nshifting framework in assessing an affirmative action plan, Johnson, 480 U.S. at 626, 107 S. Ct.\nat 1449, and some of our decisions have held that with direct evidence “it is incorrect to rely on\nthe McDonnell Douglas test because, while circumstantial evidence is used to create an inference\nof discrimination under McDonnell Douglas, no such inference is required in the case of direct\nevidence.” See, e.g., Taylor v. Runyon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"763638\"><a href=\"/opinion/763638/79-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1132-12-fla-l-weekly-fed-c-786-cynthia-l/\"><span class=\"volume\">175</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">861</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 867 n.2 (11th Cir. 1999). The County\nreasons that because the McDonnell Douglas framework does not apply to direct evidence\nclaims, and the Supreme Court applied that framework to an affirmative-action-based claim in\nJohnson, it necessarily follows that affirmative action plans cannot be direct evidence. Although\nthis syllogism has some superficial appeal, we believe it ultimately fails.\n\n         To begin with, we note that the Supreme Court never said in Johnson that affirmative\naction plans should be treated as circumstantial evidence. In fact, the word “circumstantial”\nnever appears in that opinion. Instead, the Court simply concluded that the McDonnell Douglas\nframework was useful in light of the assignment of the various burdens relevant to the claim.\nSee Johnson, 480 U.S. at 626, 107 S. Ct. at 1449 ) (“This case also fits readily within the\nanalytical framework set forth in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v.

Once a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case that race or sex has\nbeen taken into account in an employer’s employment decision, the burden shifts to the employer\nto articulate a nondiscriminatory rationale for its decision. The existence of an affirmative action\nplan provides such a rationale. If such a plan is articulated as the basis for the employer’s\ndecision, the burden shifts to the [Title VII] plaintiff to prove that the employer’s justification is\npretextual and the plan is invalid.”). Nothing in Johnson means that the plaintiff is not entitled to\nprevail without further adieu if the affirmative action plan the employer asserts as the motivation\nfor its actions is invalid.\n\n        As we explain below, treating affirmative action plans as direct evidence is consistent\nwith our other decisions relating to direct evidence. Statements by decisionmakers clearly\nevincing discriminatory intent and obviating the need to rely on an inference of discrimination\nconstitute direct evidence of discrimination. See, e.g., Merritt v. Dillard Paper Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"71953\"><a href=\"/opinion/71953/merritt-v-dillard-paper-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1181</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1189 (11th Cir. 1997). In principle, an affirmative action plan is exactly such a statement.\nThe only thing to distinguish an affirmative action plan from any other discriminatory statement\n(other than the degree of formality involved) is that the discrimination it describes or prescribes\nis permissible if the plan is valid under Title VII and the Equal Protection Clause. If it is not\nvalid, an affirmative action plan amounts to nothing more than a formal policy of unlawful\ndiscrimination.\n\n                                                  34\n\f      This view of direct evidence is supported by this Court’s case law addressing\n\nother types of direct evidence of discrimination. We have held that “[w]here the\n\nnon-movant presents direct evidence that, if believed by the jury, would be sufficient\n\nto win at trial, summary judgment is not appropriate even where the movant presents\n\nconflicting evidence.” Mize v.

The factual premise of “direct evidence” of discrimination may\n\nbe disputed, and it may well be that a plaintiff will have to establish the “direct\n\nevidence” by introducing circumstantial evidence. For example, in Merritt, we\n\nconsidered whether an alleged statement by an employer constituted direct evidence\n\nin support of the plaintiff’s retaliation claim. Merritt, 120 F.3d at 1189-91. In that\n\ncase, the employer denied that a decisionmaker had made a statement which, if true,\n\nclearly showed a retaliatory motive behind the termination of the plaintiff’s\n\nemployment. Id. Nonetheless, we concluded that because a jury could find that the\n\ndecisionmaker had made the statement, there was direct evidence of retaliation\n\nprecluding summary judgment. Id. Given this approach, we hold, for the following\n\n\n\n                                           35\n\freasons, Bass has put forth enough evidence of the existence of direct evidence of\n\ndiscrimination in the form of the County’s affirmative action plans that a jury could\n\nfind the Division acted pursuant to those plans.\n\n                    b. The County’s Affirmative Action Plans\n\n      We begin with the facts concerning the County’s affirmative action plans. All\n\nparties agree that the County had affirmative action plans in place at the time of the\n\nFire and Rescue Division’s reorganization, and that those plans were applicable to\n\nthe Division. Bass showed that in November 1990, the Board of County\n\nCommissioners adopted a five-year affirmative action plan. The plan stated that the\n\nunderutilization of blacks and Hispanics at the Division existed “division wide.” It\n\nset county-wide goals for the hiring of minorities and instructed division directors\n\nand department managers to establish annual numerical hiring and promotion\n\nobjectives to alleviate the underutilization of women and minorities.\n\n      Bass also presented evidence that in July 1993, the County adopted another\n\nplan, the 1993 Diversification Plan, “to ensure that Orange County’s workplace is\n\ndevoid of discrimination and is generally reflective of the County’s diverse\n\npopulation.” The 1993 Diversification Plan required county departments and\n\ndivisions to suspend the hiring process when no qualified minority or female\n\napplicant was available and “provide written justification to the EEO/Professional\n\n\n\n                                          36\n\fStandards Department stating job related reasons why diversity cannot be obtained\n\nvia the particular hiring process.” The 1993 Diversification Plan also set percentage\n\nhiring goals in positions that were found to have few minorities or women. That\n\n1993 plan was in effect during the time Bass interviewed for the Training Instructor\n\nposition in October 1995, and it covered hiring at the Fire and Rescue Division. In\n\nits response to Bass’ EEOC charge, the County acknowledged the existence of an\n\naffirmative action plan covering the Division and stated that one of the paramount\n\nobjectives of the plan was to “increase the percentage of women and minorities in\n\njob categories where they have been traditionally underrepresented.”\n\n      Although the County clearly had affirmative action plans in place during the\n\n1995 reorganization, it contends based on testimony from the interview panel\n\nmembers, that the decision not to offer the Training Instructor position to Bass was\n\nunrelated to its affirmative action plans. To support this contention, the County\n\npoints to testimony from the panel members indicating that the Training Instructors\n\nwere selected solely on the basis of their interview scores and that no other factors,\n\nsuch as race, were taken into consideration. Valle specifically testified that there was\n\nno discussion of race at anytime. Furthermore, the County notes that the three\n\nTraining Instructors selected represented the top three interview scores of the\n\napplicants who were still in consideration.\n\n\n\n                                           37\n\f      Although the parties dispute whether the Fire and Rescue Division was acting\n\npursuant to the County’s affirmative action plans, we must bear in mind that this\n\ncase is before us at the summary judgment stage. This means the County is entitled\n\nto judgment at this time only if it shows “that there is no genuine issue as to any\n\nmaterial fact.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). Moreover, Bass, as the non-movant, is entitled\n\nto have all reasonable inferences from the evidence in the record drawn in his favor.\n\nRyder Int’l Corp. v. First American Nat’l Bank, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">943</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1521</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1523 (11th Cir.\n\n1991).\n\n      There is substantial circumstantial evidence in the record upon which a jury\n\nreasonably could conclude that the Division acted pursuant to the County’s\n\naffirmative action plans. We have outlined above various types of circumstantial\n\nevidence which, independent of the County’s affirmative action plans, permit Bass’\n\nTitle VII claim to go to a jury. That same evidence would permit a reasonable jury\n\nto conclude that, despite its denials, the Division was acting pursuant to the County’s\n\naffirmative action plans when it decided to deny Bass a Training Instructor position\n\nduring the 1995 reorganization. While the mere existence of an affirmative action\n\nplan does not constitute direct evidence of discrimination, the existence of a plan\n\ncombined with other circumstances of the type present in this case make available to\n\na jury the reasonable inference that the employer was acting pursuant to the plan\n\n\n\n                                           38\n\fdespite statements to the contrary from the decisionmakers involved. Therefore,\n\ngiven the undisputed fact that the County had affirmative action plans which were in\n\neffect at the time of the actions that are the subject of this lawsuit, and given the\n\nevidence (all of which is circumstantial and some of which is disputed) that the\n\nDivision acted pursuant to those affirmative action plans, there is direct evidence of\n\ndiscrimination.\n\n              c. The Validity of the County’s Affirmative Action Plans\n\n        If it is either proven or conceded that a defendant acted pursuant to an\n\naffirmative action plan, the question then becomes whether the plan is valid under\n\nTitle VII. The validity of an affirmative action plan is judged under the following\n\ntest:\n\n        We must first determine whether the [government employer’s]\n        consideration of the race of promotional candidates was justified by a\n        manifest racial imbalance that reflected under-representation of [the\n        affirmative action plan’s beneficiaries] in traditionally segregated job\n        categories. . . . If such a justification was present when the plan was\n        developed, we must then determine whether the plan itself provides a\n        proper remedy for that imbalance. A remedy is proper if the plan does\n        not unnecessarily trammel the rights of non-black employees or create\n        an absolute bar to their advancement.\n\nIn re Birmingham Reverse Discrimination Employment Litig., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"667173\"><a href=\"/opinion/667173/in-re-birmingham-reverse-discrimination-employment-litigation-james-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1525</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1537\n\n(11th Cir. 1994) (citing Johnson, 480 U.S. at 632, 637, 107 S.

See generally Hill v.

As a practical\n\nmatter, placing the burden on different parties for purposes of Title VII and equal\n\nprotection claims is problematic, especially in cases, such as this one, where there\n\nare both Title VII and equal protection claims aimed at an affirmative action plan.\n\nPlacing the burden regarding the validity of the plan on the plaintiff as to one claim\n\n\n\n                                            41\n\fand on the defendant as to the other may cause confusion and creates the real\n\npossibility of disparate results as to the two claims in the same case involving the\n\nsame plan. Where the evidence is in equipoise, or in the more likely event that there\n\nis a failure of evidence on a factor in the analysis, the same plan could be judged\n\nvalid for Title VII purposes but invalid for equal protection purposes. The\n\npossibility of such an incongruous result would be avoided if the burdens were\n\nplaced on the same party for purposes of both types of claims.\n\n      Failing to place the burden of showing that an affirmative action plan is valid\n\non a Title VII defendant is also contrary to the trend since Johnson towards\n\nheightened, rather than relaxed, scrutiny of affirmative action plans.

On remand, in addition to\n\nshouldering the burden of proving that the County acted pursuant to its affirmative\n\naction plans, Bass also must show that the County’s affirmative action plans were\n\ninvalid in order to hold the County liable under Title VII for acting pursuant to those\n\nplans.\n\n                            5. Bass’ Equal Protection Claim\n\n         Next, we consider whether Bass’ § 1983 claim alleging an equal protection\n\nviolation should be permitted to go to a jury. As we have explained, Bass has put\n\nforth sufficient evidence in support of his Title VII claim for a reasonable jury to\n\nfind that the Division acted pursuant to the County’s affirmative action plans in\n\nfailing to offer him a Training Instructor position. We believe, based on the same\n\nevidence, that is also true for his § 1983 claim.\n\n         As with Title VII, the question then becomes whether the County’s\n\naffirmative action plans are valid under the Equal Protection Clause to the\n\nConstitution.

Strict scrutiny review\n\n\n\n                                           44\n\frequires the racial classification to serve a compelling governmental interest and be\n\nnarrowly tailored to achieve that interest. See Adarand, 515 U.S. at 227, 115 S. Ct. at\n\n2113. “[A] free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality\n\nshould tolerate no retreat from the principle that government may treat people\n\ndifferently because of their race only for the most compelling reasons.” Id. (citation\n\nand internal marks omitted). Therefore, actions pursuant to an affirmative action\n\nplan which does not satisfy strict scrutiny constitute unlawful and unconstitutional\n\ndiscrimination. See, e.g., Adarand , 515 U.S. at 227, 115 S. Ct. at 2113.\n\n      The County concedes that, in contrast to the Title VII context, Supreme Court\n\nprecedent governing equal protection claims places the burden on a defendant to\n\nprove that an affirmative action plan satisfies strict scrutiny. Up to this point, the\n\nCounty has never argued, even in the alternative, that its affirmative action plans are\n\nup to this equal protection challenge, and we do not know if it will ever do so. So, it\n\nwould be premature for us to decide whether the County has waived the right to\n\nargue that. If, on remand, the County raises this issue, it will be for the district court\n\nto decide in the first instance whether that argument is still available to the County\n\ngiven its strategy so far of denying that its plans played any role in the challenged\n\nemployment actions, or whether because of the County’s previous litigating position\n\n\n\n\n                                            45\n\fit is now precluded from asserting that the plans are valid under the Equal Protection\n\nClause.\n\n\n\n       Furthermore, if the district court permits the County to assert on remand that\n\nits affirmative action plans are valid under the Equal Protection Clause, the court\n\nwill then need to decide whether to take up the legal issue about the validity of the\n\nplans before or after the jury considers the factual issue of whether the County acted\n\npursuant to its plans. In complicated affirmative action cases like this one involving\n\nmultiple burdens assigned to different parties and requiring determinations by both\n\njudge (i.e. validity of a plan) and jury (i.e. whether defendant acted pursuant to a\n\nplan), we believe that it is best to allow a district court to decide, based on the\n\ncircumstances of the particular case, the timing and order of the proceedings.\n\nTherefore, if the County contends (for the first time) on remand that its affirmative\n\naction plans are valid under the Equal Protection Clause, the district court can decide\n\nhow and when to decide the issues related to that contention.9\n\n                                 B. RETALIATION CLAIMS\n\n\n\n       9\n         Regardless of whether the County has waived the right to assert the validity of its plans\nfor equal protection purposes, it has not done so for Title VII purposes because the burden on\nthat issue is on the Title VII plaintiff. If Bass does not carry his burden of showing the plans are\ninvalid, his Title VII claim must fail, insofar as it is based on the existence of the plans as\ndistinguished from the other evidence of discrimination.\n\n                                                  46\n\f      In addition to prohibiting employers from discriminating on the basis of race,\n\nTitle VII makes it unlawful:\n\n      for an employer to discriminate against any of his employees or\n      applicants for employment, . . . because he has opposed any practice\n      made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter [of Title\n      VII], or because he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated\n      in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this\n      subchapter [of Title VII].\n\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a). In order to establish a prima facie case of retaliation, the\n\nplaintiff must show: (1) he engaged in protected activity; (2) he suffered an adverse\n\nemployment action; and (3) there was a causal link between his protected activity\n\nand the adverse employment action.

The court then held that the County had\n\narticulated legitimate non-retaliatory reasons for its action which Bass failed to\n\nrebut, and as a result the County was entitled to summary judgment on the retaliation\n\nclaims. Bass argues that he established a prima facie case and the district court erred\n\nin holding that he had failed to present sufficient evidence to create a jury issue\n\nabout the County’s proffered reason.\n\n                                           47\n\f      We will first address Bass’ prima facie case. Bass contends that he engaged in\n\na protected activity by filing a union grievance in October 1995 in which he\n\ncomplained of racial discrimination in the hiring of the Training Instructors and by\n\nfiling a charge of discrimination with the EEOC in December 1995. We need not\n\ndecide whether the filing of the union grievance was a protected activity for anti-\n\nretaliation purposes, because the filing of the EEOC complaint clearly was, and the\n\nbulk of the allegedly retaliatory actions occurred after the filing of the EEOC\n\ncomplaint. See Berman v. Orkin Exterminating Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">160</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">697</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 702 (11th Cir.\n\n1998) (holding that filing of EEOC complaint is protected activity). Bass thus\n\nsatisfied the first prong of the prima facie case of retaliation.\n\n      With respect to the second prong, Bass alleges that he suffered numerous\n\nadverse employment actions. Bass presented evidence that the following actions\n\nwere taken against him after he filed his complaints the EEOC: (1) he had no routine\n\nwork assignments; (2) he was forced to perform custodial and clerical duties, and\n\nusually was supervised by less senior personnel; (3) he was continuously denied the\n\nopportunity to earn overtime pay, on-call pay, riding-out-of classification pay, and\n\nadjunct teaching pay, which were available to other training instructors; (4) he was\n\ntransferred out of the Training Bureau in January 1997 and was not informed of his\n\nnew position until April 1997; and in April 1997, he was told to report to work in a\n\n\n\n                                            48\n\fnon-budgeted position that was not covered by the union contract; (5) he was\n\nordered to take tests to retain his paramedic pay while other Training Instructors\n\nwere not required to do so; (6) Chief Smith and Middleton ordered him not to record\n\nin his work logs the custodial and clerical work he performed; and (7) Bass’ training\n\nprograms, database files for documenting training, and graphic/multimedia material\n\nhe had developed over a five-year period were destroyed.\n\n      “An adverse employment action is an ultimate employment decision, such as\n\ndischarge or failure to hire, or other conduct that alters the employee's compensation,\n\nterms, conditions, or privileges of employment, deprives him or her of employment\n\nopportunities, or adversely affects his or her status as an employee.” Gupta, 212\n\nF.3d at 587 (citation and marks omitted). “Conduct that falls short of an ultimate\n\nemployment decision must meet ‘some threshold level of substantiality . . . to be\n\ncognizable under the anti-retaliation clause’” of Title VII.

The question of whether an employee has suffered a\n\nmaterially adverse employment action will normally depend on the facts of each\n\nindividual case. See Gupta, 212 F.3d at 587.\n\n      The last two listed actions of which Bass complains – the order not to record\n\ncustodial work in his work log and the destruction of various materials – are not\n\nadverse employment actions. Those actions were not objectively “serious and\n\ntangible enough” to alter Bass’ “compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of\n\nemployment, deprive[] . . . him of employment opportunities or adversely affect . . .\n\nhis status as an employee.” Robinson, 120 F.3d at 1300 (internal marks omitted).\n\nWe do not see how being told not to record certain tasks on a work log could\n\nconstitute a serious alteration of the terms of Bass’ employment. Also, the\n\nDivision’s disposal of training programs, database files for documenting training,\n\nand graphic/multimedia material prepared by Bass in no way punished or affected\n\nBass’ employment status.\n\n      Having explained why the last two of the seven actions about which Bass\n\ncomplains were not adverse employment actions, we turn now to the remaining five.\n\nIt is undisputed that Bass was not given the same duties as the other Training\n\nInstructors. Bass was given no routine work assignments and was forced to perform\n\ncustodial and clerical duties under the supervision of less senior personnel. The\n\n\n\n                                          50\n\fDivision also denied him the opportunity to earn overtime pay, on-call pay, riding-\n\nout-of classification pay, and adjunct teaching pay, which were available to other\n\nTraining Instructors. Prior to filing his EEOC complaint alleging racial\n\ndiscrimination, Bass had been permitted to teach adjunct courses and receive pay\n\nfrom agencies other than the Division. After filing that complaint, he was not\n\nallowed to do so. In addition, Bass was ordered to take tests to maintain his\n\nparamedic pay while none of the other Training Instructors were required to do so.\n\n      We conclude that the Division’s actions which deprived Bass of compensation\n\nwhich he otherwise would have earned clearly constitute adverse employment\n\nactions for purposes of Title VII. See McCabe v. Sharrett, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"659889\"><a href=\"/opinion/659889/ellen-d-mccabe-v-ce-sharrett-jr-chief-of-police-city-of-plantation/\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1558</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1564 (11th\n\nCir. 1994) (holding that employee suffered adverse job action where she had fewer\n\nresponsibilities, was made to perform more menial tasks, and had lesser opportunity\n\nfor salary increases in her new position). While the other actions might not have\n\nindividually risen to the level of adverse employment action under Title VII, when\n\nthose actions are considered collectively, the total weight of them does constitute an\n\nadverse employment action. See Wideman v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"753706\"><a href=\"/opinion/753706/76-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1506-73-empl-prac-dec-p-45384-23-fla-l/\"><span class=\"volume\">141</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1453</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n1456 (11th Cir. 1998) (“It is enough to conclude, as we do, that the actions about\n\nwhich Wideman complains considered collectively are sufficient to constitute\n\n\n\n\n                                          51\n\fprohibited discrimination.

It is not enough for the plaintiff to show that someone in the\n\norganization knew of the protected expression; instead, the plaintiff must show that\n\nthe person taking the adverse action was aware of the protected expression. See\n\nRaney, 120 F.3d at 1196. This awareness, however, may be established by\n\ncircumstantial evidence. See Goldsmith v. City of Atmore, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"609835\"><a href=\"/opinion/609835/62-fair-emplpraccas-bna-769-63-empl-prac-dec-p-42642-delphine/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1155</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1163\n\n(11th Cir. 1993). Close temporal proximity between the protected activity and the\n\nadverse action may be sufficient to show that the two were not wholly unrelated. See\n\nGupta, 212 F.3d at 590.\n\n\n\n                                            52\n\f       Bass filed his EEOC charge on December 19, 1995. Soon after Bass filed his\n\nEEOC complaint, he began to suffer adverse employment actions. The close\n\ntemporal proximity between filing of the EEOC complaint and the adverse actions is\n\nsufficient in this case to satisfy the third prong of the prima facie case of retaliation.\n\nSee generally Gupta, 212 F.3d at 590. Thus, Bass established a prima facie case of\n\ndiscrimination.\n\n       The burden then shifts to the County to set forth a legitimate, non-retaliatory\n\nreason for its actions. The Fire and Rescue Division’s only reason for not assigning\n\nBass Training Instructor duties was that there was no vacant district to which to\n\nassign him. The County contends that the head of the Training Bureau, Chief\n\nWillard Smith, decided to keep three districts, instead of creating a fourth. It also\n\nmaintains that Smith decided that only one Training Instructor should serve each\n\ndistrict.\n\n       Bass argues that the County’s articulated reason is insufficient because it\n\naddresses only the failure to assign Bass Training Instructor duties and not the other\n\nalleged retaliatory actions such as being placed in a non-union job and not being\n\nallowed overtime pay. Bass further argues that he has shown that the County’s one-\n\ninstructor-per-district defense is pretext because the Fire and Rescue Division failed\n\nto place Bass in the Training Instructor position that became vacant in the spring of\n\n\n\n                                            53\n\f1998 and was still vacant as of November 1998. Middleton confirmed the existence\n\nof the vacancy.\n\n       We agree that the County failed to negate the existence of a genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact concerning a causal connection between all of the adverse actions and\n\nBass’ filing of the EEOC complaint. The County only addressed one part of the\n\nretaliation: the failure to assign Training Instructor duties to Bass. While the “no\n\nvacant district” argument may explain his lack of Training Instructor duties and thus\n\nthe imposition of clerical duties, it does not explain other adverse employment\n\nactions such as Bass’ transfer to a non-union job, his being denied the opportunity to\n\nteach outside courses, and the testing requirement placed on Bass and not others.\n\nThe County does not attempt to explain those other actions, nor does it explain why\n\nBass was not assigned to the Training Instructor position that became available in\n\nthe spring of 1998. The district court thus erred in granting the County’s motion for\n\nsummary judgment.10\n\n\n       10\n         Although Bass presented no separate arguments in support of his claims under the\nFlorida Civil Rights Act, for the same reasons that we reverse the grant of summary judgement\nas to Bass’ retaliation claim under Title VII, we also reverse as to his parallel claim under the\nFlorida Civil Rights Act. See supra n.4.\n\n         With respect to Bass’ § 1981 retaliation claim, the situation is less clear. We have\npreviously noted that whether the elements of Title VII and § 1981 retaliation claims are the\nsame is an “open question” in this Circuit. See Olmsted v.
