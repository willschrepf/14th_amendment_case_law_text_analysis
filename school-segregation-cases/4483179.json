State of Oregon\n\n    Case Summary: Moro v. State of Oregon, 357 Or 167, 351 P3d 1 (2015) affirmed\nin part and denied in part challenges brought by petitioners to legislative amend-\nments aimed at reducing the costs of the Public Employee Retirement System\n(PERS). Claimants, who are pro se petitioners and attorneys representing other\npetitioners, seek their fees and costs for their efforts achieving that result. The\npetitions for fees and costs were previously referred to a special master for recom-\nmended findings of fact and conclusions of law. After the special master reported\nthose recommendations, the parties raised numerous issues. Held: (1) fees should\nbe awarded based on the common-fund and substantial-benefit doctrines and not\nDeras v. Myers, 272 Or 47, 535 P2d 541 (1975); (2) self-represented attorneys are\neligible to receive a fee award under those the common-fund and substantial-\nbenefit doctrines; (3) a reasonable fee award under the lodestar approach must be\nbased on reasonable hourly rates and reflect reductions to account for duplicative\nwork and work on unsuccessful claims; and (4) an award in this case should be\npaid for as determined by the Public Employees Retirement Board (PERB) in a\nmanner that is consistent with its statutory authority and fiduciary obligations.\n    Attorney fees and costs awarded.\n\fCite as 360 Or 467 (2016)\t471\n\n\t          BALMER, C. J.\n\t        This matter is before us on petitions for attorney\nfees and costs brought by a law firm and three individuals\n(claimants) who participated in the underlying litigation.\nIn that litigation, claimants were petitioners or represented\npetitioners who challenged legislation passed in 2013 that\nchanged the pension benefits paid to certain members of the\nPublic Employee Retirement System (PERS) by limiting the\nstatutory cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) and eliminating\na PERS income-tax offset for out-of-state retirees. In Moro\nv. State of Oregon, 357 Or 167, 351 P3d 1 (2015) (Moro I),\nthis court largely agreed with petitioners’ argument that\nmodifications to the COLA formula impaired petitioners’\ncontractual rights, thus violating Article I, section 21, of the\nOregon Constitution. But the court rejected petitioners’ sim-\nilar challenge to the elimination of the income-tax offset.\nPetitioners, who were active and retired members of PERS,\nwere the prevailing parties.\n\t        Following the decision in Moro I, claimants peti-\ntioned for attorney fees and costs. State respondents and\ncounty/school district respondents filed objections.1 We\nreferred those petitions to a special master for recommended\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law. Moro v. State, 358 Or\n375, 381, 364 P3d 325 (2015) (Moro II). The special master\nreported his recommendations to this court, and the parties\nsubsequently filed objections and responses to those recom-\nmendations. The issues raised in those filings include which\nlegal doctrines justify an award of attorney fees in this case;\nwhether self-represented attorneys are eligible to receive an\naward of attorney fees; whether the fees sought by claim-\nants are reasonable; and how to pay for an award of fees and\ncosts.\n\n\t1\n       “State respondents” are the State of Oregon, Governor Kate Brown,\nAttorney General Ellen Rosenblum, the Public Employees Retirement Board, and\nthe Public Employees Retirement System. “County/school district respondents”\nare Linn County, Estacada School District, Oregon City School District, Ontario\nSchool District, West Linn School District, Beaverton School District, and Bend\nSchool District as well as intervenors Oregon School Boards Association and\nAssociation of Oregon Counties. Further, respondent Tualatin Valley Fire and\nRescue joined in the objections filed by state respondents and county/school dis-\ntrict respondents.\n\f472\t                                 Moro v. State of Oregon\n\n\t        After reviewing those filings, and for the reasons\ndescribed below, we conclude that fees should be awarded\nbased on the common-fund and substantial-benefit doc-\ntrines; that the self-represented attorneys are eligible to\nreceive a fee award under those doctrines; that a reasonable\nfee award under the lodestar approach must be based on\nreasonable hourly rates and reflect reductions to account for\nduplicative work and work on unsuccessful claims; and that\nan award in this case should be paid for as determined by\nthe Public Employees Retirement Board (PERB) in a man-\nner that is consistent with its statutory authority and fidu-\nciary obligations.\n\t        Four claimants seek compensation here. One claim-\nant is the law firm Bennett, Hartman, Morris & Kaplan, LLP\n(“Bennett Hartman”), which represented the Moro group\nof petitioners. The three additional claimants—Reynolds,\nRiemer, and Jones—are PERS members who acted as pro\nse petitioners in the underlying litigation. Reynolds and\nRiemer, although pro se petitioners, also are attorneys and\nseek both attorney fees and costs. Jones seeks only his costs.\n\t        Claimants who seek attorney fees have calculated\ntheir fees using the lodestar method. Under the lodestar\nmethod, a court determines a reasonable attorney fee award\nby multiplying the reasonable hours expended by a reason-\nable hourly rate and, when appropriate, enhancing the lode-\nstar amount with a fee multiplier. See Strawn v. Farmers\nIns. Co., 353 Or 210, 217, 297 P3d 439 (2013) (describing\nthe lodestar method). Bennett Hartman seeks $1,401,040\nin fees, based on 1,693.8 hours of attorney time at between\n$150 and $500 per hour and a fee multiplier of 2.0. Reynolds\nseeks $562,000 in fees, based on 562 hours of attorney time\nat $500 per hour and a fee multiplier of 2.0. And Riemer\nseeks $397,500 in fees, based on 265 hours of attorney time\nat $500 per hour and a fee multiplier of 3.0.\n\t        As it relates to costs, Bennett Hartman seeks\n$62,066.13; Reynolds seeks $1,214.48; Riemer seeks\n$1,159.15; and Jones seeks $1,479.24. Bennett Hartman’s\ncost request is substantially higher because it includes the\ncosts of an expert witness who testified in support of peti-\ntioners in the underlying litigation.\n\fCite as 360 Or 467 (2016)\t473\n\n\t        State respondents and county/school district\nrespondents filed objections with this court asserting var-\nious reasons to deny or reduce the fees claimed. As an ini-\ntial matter, respondents dispute what legal grounds are\navailable to justify attorney fees. Bennett Hartman and\nReynolds rely on the common-fund doctrine, while Riemer\nrelies on both the common-fund doctrine and on this court’s\ndecision in Deras v. Myers, 272 Or 47, 535 P2d 541 (1975).\nAlthough respondents agree that a fee award may be jus-\ntified under the common-fund doctrine, they dispute the\napplicability of Deras, and county/school district respon-\ndents additionally argue that a portion of the fee award\nshould be justified under the substantial-benefit doctrine.\nRespondents also contend that, regardless of which doc-\ntrine justifies a fee award, no fees should be awarded to\nReynolds and Riemer because of their status as pro se peti-\ntioners, rather than attorneys serving in a representative\ncapacity.\n\t        If fees are awarded, the parties agree that any fee\naward allowed in this case must be reasonable. Respon-\ndents object to the reasonableness of the fees sought—\nspecifically, whether claimants are using appropriate hourly\nrates and fee multipliers and whether fees should be reduced\nto account for duplicative work and work on the unsuccess-\nful tax-offset claim.\n\t        Finally, the parties dispute how to pay for any award\nof costs and fees, namely, how to collect the money from the\nbeneficiaries of the litigation. Those beneficiaries consist of\nactive, inactive, and retired PERS members falling within\ndifferent tiers of membership. The assets of those beneficia-\nries are therefore spread out among different accounts held\nwithin the Public Employees Retirement Fund (PERF). That\nraises the question of whether the money for any awards\nshould come from, for example, payments being made to\nretirees, PERS’s contingency reserve account, or individual\nPERS accounts.\n\t       All those disputes were presented to the special\nmaster, whose report contained recommended findings of\nfact and conclusions of law. The special master concluded\nthat the common-fund and substantial-benefit doctrines\n\f474\t                                             Moro v. State of Oregon\n\napplied, but that Deras fees should not be allowed. The spe-\ncial master further concluded that the common-fund and\nsubstantial-benefit doctrines largely justified the fees sought\nby Bennett Hartman, although he recommended using a 1.5\nfee multiplier rather than the 2.0 fee multiplier that Bennett\nHartman requested.\n\t        The special master recommended no award of attor-\nney fees to Reynolds and Riemer, because they were acting\nas pro se litigants rather than as attorneys. He also made\nthe alternative recommendation that, if this court were to\ndetermine that Reynolds and Riemer were entitled to attor-\nney fees despite their status as pro se litigants, any fee\naward should be adjusted based on his determination that\nonly 20 percent of their work contributed to the success of\nthe litigation. According to the special master, 80 percent\nof their work either went to the losing tax-offset claim or\nwas duplicative of that performed by Bennett Hartman. The\nspecial master did not recommend that any multiplier be\napplied to fees awarded to Reynolds and Riemer.\n\t         Separate from attorney fees, Reynolds and Jones\nseek their costs under ORAP 13.05; Bennett Hartman seeks\nits litigation expenses as costs that should be awarded under\nthe common-fund doctrine; and Riemer seeks his costs\nunder both. The special master recommended an award of\ncosts to Bennett Hartman under the common-fund doctrine\nin the amount of $62,066.13, to be paid in the same manner\nas the fee award—that is, out of PERS funds held on behalf\nof the PERS members who had benefitted from the litiga-\ntion. And, based on ORAP 13.05, the special master recom-\nmended granting the costs sought by Reynolds and recom-\nmended small downward adjustments to the costs sought by\nRiemer and Jones—leading to a total cost award of $548.05\nfor Riemer and $1,379.24 for Jones. With the exception of the\ndeduction applied to Riemer, we accept the special master’s\nrecommendations on costs.2\n\n\t2\n      Riemer is the only party disputing the special master’s recommendation\nwith regard to costs. He argues that he is entitled to costs under the common-\nfund doctrine, rather than the more limited costs available under ORAP 13.05,\nas applied by the special master. For the reasons explained below, 360 Or at ___,\nwe agree that Riemer is entitled to costs under the common-fund and substantial-\nbenefit doctrines and, therefore, award him the costs that he requested: $1,159.15.\n\fCite as 360 Or 467 (2016)\t475\n\n\t       The parties dispute numerous issues regarding\nthe special master’s recommended attorney-fee awards. We\naddress each of those issues below.\nA.  Grounds for Attorney-Fee Recovery\n\t        The parties assert three grounds for attorney-fee\nrecovery: the common-fund doctrine, the substantial-benefit\ndoctrine, and this court’s decision in Deras. We address\nthat issue first because the rationales underlying different\ngrounds for recovering fees may influence how we resolve\nother issues related to the determination of fee amounts.\n\t        Riemer is the only claimant seeking fees based on\nDeras. Under Deras, a court has the discretion to award fees\nif “the parties who request attorney fees prevailed [and]\nthose prevailing parties vindicated an important constitu-\ntional right applying to all citizens” rather than “gain[ing]\nsomething peculiar to themselves.” Lehman v. Bradbury,\n334 Or 579, 583, 54 P3d 591 (2002).\n\t        In previous PERS litigation, we denied a claimant’s\nrequest for Deras fees. Strunk v. PERB, 341 Or 175, 181,\n139 P3d 956 (2006) (Strunk II). The special master in this\ncase recommends following that precedent. We agree. The\nlitigants in this case, including Riemer, were attempting\nto gain something peculiar to themselves and other PERS\nmembers. Although the number of people affected is large, it\nis, nevertheless, a discrete group of people and a group that\nis easily distinguished from the public as a whole. For that\nreason, we deny Riemer’s request to award attorney fees\nunder Deras.\n\t        The remaining grounds offered by the parties are\nthe common-fund and substantial-benefit doctrines. Both\ndoctrines rest on the same equitable and restitutionary\ngrounds: to avoid unjust enrichment by spreading the liti-\ngation costs among those who benefited from a legal action\nbrought by a plaintiff. Crandon Capital Partners v. Shelk,\n342 Or 555, 566, 157 P3d 176 (2007). The common-fund\ndoctrine applies when a plaintiff’s “legal efforts create, dis-\ncover, increase, or preserve a fund of money to which others\nalso have a claim.” Strunk II, 341 Or at 181. A party who liti-\ngates such a case may recover the costs of those legal efforts,\n\f476\t                                              Moro v. State of Oregon\n\nincluding attorney fees, from the created or preserved fund.\nId. The substantial-benefit doctrine, on the other hand, ordi-\nnarily applies when a party’s legal efforts create nonliqui-\ndated benefits—whether or not pecuniary—that are held in\ncommon with others, such as when a union member’s lawsuit\nbenefits other union members, Gilbert v. Hoisting & Port.\nEngrs., 237 Or 130, 137, 384 P2d 136 (1963), or a sharehold-\ner’s lawsuit benefits the corporation and thus other share-\nholders, Crandon Capital Partners, 342 Or at 562-63.\n\t         In common-fund and substantial-benefit cases,\na party pursuing its litigation objectives necessarily con-\nfers benefits on nonparties, because the litigation impli-\ncates interests that they share. See Restatement (Third) of\nRestitution and Unjust Enrichment § 29 comment a (2011)\n(“The underlying premise of all such claims in restitution is\nthat—by reason of the parties’ interconnected interests—the\nclaimant cannot pursue justifiable, self-interested objectives\nwithout benefiting the [nonparties] as well.”). In Strunk II,\nthis court observed that the common-fund doctrine is “used\nto spread litigation expenses among all beneficiaries of a pre-\nserved fund so that litigant-beneficiaries are not required to\nbear the entire financial burden of the litigation while [non-\nparty-]beneficiaries receive the benefits at no cost.” 341 Or at\n181. Similarly, in Crandon Capital, we linked the common-\nfund and the substantial-benefit doctrines, noting that, for\nboth, “fees are awarded not, as in a ‘prevailing party’ case,\nto make the plaintiff whole by shifting all costs to the wrong-\ndoer, but instead to spread the costs among those on whose\nbehalf the case was brought and who benefitted from plain-\ntiff’s the efforts.” 342 Or at 566.\n\t        Thus, under both doctrines, nonparty beneficiaries\nof the litigation may be required to contribute to the legal\nexpenses of the litigation that secured the benefits. A claim\nfor a contribution to those legal expenses may be brought\nby the party who incurred the expenses or by the attorney\nwho provided the legal work. Strunk II, 341 Or at 183-84.3\n\t3\n       In this case, as in the Strunk litigation, the Bennett Hartman firm’s con-\ntract with the union that paid its fees provided that the firm would, on its own\nbehalf, seek an award of attorney fees if the petitioners prevailed. Thus, the\naward that the firm seeks here is on its own behalf, not on behalf of the individual\nclients or the union that paid its bills. Under the contract, the firm is obligated\n\fCite as 360 Or 467 (2016)\t477\n\nRequiring nonparties to pay the fee award is in contrast to\nfee-shifting provisions, which generally require an adverse\nparty to pay the legal expenses of the prevailing party. See\nRestatement § 29 comment c (“[T]here can be no common-\nfund recovery against an adverse party.”).\n\t        We agree with the special master that both the\nsubstantial-benefit and common-fund doctrines provide a\nbasis for attorney fees here. It is beyond dispute that the\nlitigation undertaken by petitioners conferred very sub-\nstantial benefits on other PERS members. Some of those\nmembers are retirees who, following enactment of the 2013\namendments, received smaller COLAs than they were enti-\ntled to and, as a result of that litigation, are now recover-\ning that shortfall. Other PERS members, including retired\nand active members, will benefit substantially over many\nyears from our decision that PERB cannot reduce the COLA\nrights applied to PERS benefits earned before the legisla-\nture modified those COLA rights in 2013. See Moro I, 357 Or\nat 184-87 (describing pre-amendment and post-amendment\nCOLA benefits).\n\t        According to the special master, the present com-\nbined value of benefits of the COLA holding to all nonparty\nbeneficiaries is about $4.5 billion, and no party seriously\ndisputes that figure. As to the application of the common-\nfund theory, there is disagreement over the size of the com-\nmon fund established by the litigation. Claimants assert\nthat the litigation created a “fund” in the amount of the ben-\nefit that the nonparty beneficiaries will receive over time—\nessentially, the entire $4.5 billion of benefits identified by\nthe special master. County/school district respondents, how-\never, argue that the only common fund created by the liti-\ngation is the $66 million in restored COLA adjustments for\nretired PERS members who had received lesser amounts\nbetween the effective date of the 2013 COLA amendment\nand this court’s decision invalidating those changes. The\nremainder of the $4.5 billion, they argue, relates to amounts\nthat PERS members will receive over time, but is not a liqui-\ndated “fund” of money subject to the common-fund doctrine.\n\nto repay from any fee award the amount that it was paid by the union, but it is\nentitled to retain any additional fees that are awarded.\n\f478\t                                            Moro v. State of Oregon\n\n\t         We need not resolve that dispute over the size of\nthe common fund in order to determine attorney fees in this\ncase, however. As discussed, both the substantial-benefit\nand common-fund doctrines provide a basis for an award of\nfees here, and the difference between them is primarily in\nthe nature of the benefits created by the litigation. Under\nboth theories, the amount of the fee award is based on the\nsame equitable and restitutionary considerations. Indeed,\nthe Restatement treats the substantial-benefit doctrine as\nan application of the common-fund doctrine, where the com-\nmon fund is an entity in which the party and other benefi-\nciaries have interconnected interests. See id. at § 29 com-\nment f (“The standard example of a fund of this second type\ninvolves corporate stock: in the terminology of Section 29,\nthe corporation itself is then the ‘fund’ and its sharehold-\ners the beneficiaries.”). Accordingly, we turn to a consider-\nation of the appropriate fee awards in this case, based on the\ncommon-fund and substantial-benefit doctrines.\nB.  Fees for Self-Represented Attorneys\n\t        The next question is whether self-represented attor-\nneys may receive an attorney-fee award under the common-\nfund and substantial-benefit doctrines. Claimants Reynolds\nand Riemer contend that they are each entitled to an\nattorney-fee award because they are both attorneys licensed\nto practice law in other states—Reynolds in Washington\nand Riemer in Arizona—and they performed legal work\nin this litigation. Respondents object, arguing that neither\nhas the authority to practice law in Oregon and that the\nequitable and restitutionary grounds for an award under\nthe common-fund and substantial-benefit doctrines do not\njustify an award for self-represented attorneys. The special\nmaster agreed with respondents and recommended award-\ning Reynolds and Riemer no attorney fees.\n\t       The special master reached that conclusion based\non both narrow technical grounds and broad policy grounds.\nThe narrow technical grounds are statutes and rules set-\nting out requirements for out-of-state attorneys to practice\nlaw in Oregon courts, such as being admitted pro hac vice.4\n\t4\n       See ORS 9.160(1) (providing that, with exceptions, only active members of\nthe Oregon bar may “practice law” in Oregon); ORS 9.241(1) (allowing out-of-state\n\fCite as 360 Or 467 (2016)\t479\n\nNeither Reynolds nor Riemer complied with those require-\nments. The special master therefore reasoned that neither\nReynolds nor Riemer was “practicing law” when they partic-\nipated in the litigation. Instead, both were allowed to partic-\nipate only because a statute, ORS 9.320, allows all parties to\na lawsuit, whether or not they are attorneys, to “prosecute[ ]\nand defend[ ]” an action without violating the prohibition on\nunauthorized practice of law. See also ORS 9.160(2) (estab-\nlishing that self-represented parties do not violate ban on\nthe unauthorized practice of law).\n\t        For support, the special master contrasted the facts\npresented by Reynolds and Riemer with the facts of Colby\nv. Gunson, 349 Or 1, 238 P3d 374 (2010), a case in which\nthis court held that a self-represented attorney could obtain\nfees under a statutory fee-shifting provision. In Colby, this\ncourt noted that the self-represented attorney in that case\n“is an attorney, in the ordinary sense of the word. He grad-\nuated from law school, is a member of the Oregon State Bar,\nand is authorized to practice law in this state. Throughout\nthe proceedings below, he was subject to the Oregon Rules\nof Professional Conduct, along with other statutory provi-\nsions that govern the conduct of attorneys.” Id. at 8. Because\nReynolds and Riemer were pro se litigants who had not com-\nplied with the rules on pro hac vice admission, the special\nmaster concluded that they were not authorized to practice\nlaw in Oregon and, therefore, were not eligible for a fee\naward.\n\t        The problem with relying on those narrow techni-\ncal grounds is that they do not correspond to the equitable\ngoal served by a restitutionary attorney-fee award under the\ncommon-fund and substantial-benefit doctrines—namely,\navoiding the unjust enrichment that would result from\nallowing nonparties to enjoy the benefits of the litigation\nwithout contributing to the costs of the litigation. A restitu-\ntionary award for the services of another is generally lim-\nited to professional services. See Matter of Cont’l Illinois Sec.\n\nattorney to practice in Oregon courts only if “the attorney is associated with an\nactive member of the Oregon State Bar”); ORAP 8.10(4) (allowing out-of-state\nattorney to “appear by brief and argue the cause in a proceeding before an appel-\nlate court” if the attorney complies with UTCR 3.170); UTCR 3.170 (requiring\nout-of-state attorney to be admitted pro hac vice).\n\f480\t                                 Moro v. State of Oregon\n\nLitig., 962 F2d 566, 571 (7th Cir 1992), as amended on denial\nof reh’g (May 22, 1992) (Posner, J.) (“The basis for an award\nof fees in a common-fund case is, as we said, restitutionary,\nand the law of restitution (excepting salvage in admiralty)\ngenerally confines the right to restitution to professionals,\nsuch as doctors and lawyers.”) (citing 2 George E. Palmer,\nThe Law of Restitution, ch. 10 (1978)). Therefore, the under-\nlying question in deciding on a restitutionary fee award is\nwhether Reynolds and Riemer were lawyers who performed\nwork normally performed by a lawyer.\n\t        The rules on pro hac vice admission and the unau-\nthorized practice of law do not answer that question and are\nnot directed at unjust enrichment. Instead, those rules are\ndirected at consumer protection and prohibit a nonlawyer, or\nan out-of-state lawyer who has not complied with the appli-\ncable rules, from representing or advising another person as\na lawyer in Oregon. See Johnson v. Premo, 355 Or 866, 872,\n333 P3d 288 (2014) (“The prohibition against nonlawyer\nlegal practice serves the dual purpose of protecting the pub-\nlic interest and the rights of individual litigants.”). Those\nrules do not apply to individuals representing themselves,\nbecause, as noted above, parties to a lawsuit may generally\nprosecute or defend themselves under ORS 9.320, regard-\nless of whether they are lawyers.\n\t        Reynolds and Riemer failed to comply with the rules\nof pro hac vice admission not because they could not satisfy\nthose standards, but because, as self-represented parties,\nthey were not required to comply with those rules. Their fail-\nure to comply with those rules means only that they did not\nrepresent or advise others as lawyers; it does not answer the\nquestion of whether they are lawyers and whether the work\nthat they performed was legal work, such that they may be\nentitled to attorney fees under the substantial-benefit and\ncommon-fund doctrines.\n\t       Further, our statement in Colby noting that the\nattorney in that case was authorized to practice law in\nOregon, 349 Or at 8, should not be read as creating a stan-\ndard for determining whether someone is a lawyer who per-\nformed legal work. Instead, we stated only that someone\nwho is authorized to practice law in Oregon is an attorney,\n\fCite as 360 Or 467 (2016)\t481\n\nnot that an attorney is only someone who is authorized to\npractice law in Oregon.\n\t       Rather, like the attorney in Colby, Reynolds and\nRiemer are lawyers. They went to law school and are active\nmembers of bars in other states. And the work that they\nperformed in this case was legal work—namely, researching\nthe law, developing legal arguments, and presenting those\narguments in briefs to this court. Therefore, Reynolds and\nRiemer were lawyers who performed legal work in this case.\n\t         The special master also denied Reynolds and Riemer\nattorney fees based on broad policy grounds, which would\npreclude fee awards even to self-represented attorneys who\nwere authorized to represent or advise others as a lawyer,\neither as active members of the Oregon bar or as attorneys\nadmitted pro hac vice. The policy grounds that the special\nmaster relied on are set out in Zucker v. Westinghouse Elec.,\n374 F3d 221 (3d Cir 2004), where the court refused to award\nfees under the common-fund doctrine to a self-represented\nattorney who successfully raised objections to a proposed\nclass-action settlement. The court reasoned that “awarding\n[a self-represented attorney] attorney’s fees potentially could\n‘tempt’ other lawyer-shareholders to ‘advance garden vari-\nety objections because of the prospect of an award of attor-\nney fees for their personal service.’ ” Id. at 226. According to\nthe court,\n    “We note that [the self-represented attorney] did not incur\n    any financial liabilities for his work on this case. Failure\n    to award [the self-represented attorney] fees should not\n    discourage other shareholders from raising meritorious\n    objections in the future; it will only ensure that they pur-\n    sue objections with the assistance of third-party counsel.”\nId.5\n\t      There are two difficulties with applying those\ngrounds in this case. First, as to the concern that allowing\n\n\t5\n      Those broad policy grounds have been applied in other federal cases to\ndeny fees to self-represented attorneys. See, e.g., In re Currency Conversion Fee\nAntitrust Litig., 263 FRD 110, 132 (SDNY 2009), aff’d sub nom. Priceline.com,\nInc. v. Silberman, 405 Fed Appx 532 (2d Cir 2010); In re Texaco Inc. S’holder\nDerivative Litig., 123 F Supp 2d 169, 173 (SDNY 2000), aff’d, 28 Fed Appx 83 (2d\nCir 2002).\n\f482\t                                    Moro v. State of Oregon\n\nfees would tempt self-represented attorneys to bring specious\nclaims, this court rejected a similar concern raised in Colby:\n   “Although not necessary to our decision here, we note that\n   the legislature has addressed that concern by permitting\n   attorney fees only to parties who ‘prevail[ ] in the suit’ and\n   by requiring that the attorney fee award be ‘reasonable.’\n   ORS 192.490(3). Further, the legislature has provided a\n   list of factors that a court must consider in determining the\n   amount of any attorney fee award, several of which protect\n   against the abusive fee generation potential that the Court\n   of Appeals feared. See ORS 20.075(1), (2) (listing factors to\n   be considered in determining amount of any attorney fee\n   award).”\n349 Or at 8-9. Like the statutory fees at issue in Colby,\ncommon-fund and substantial-benefit fees are allowed only\nto prevailing parties and must be reasonable. Further,\ncommon-fund and substantial-benefit fees include addi-\ntional protections, because the fees cannot exceed the value\nof the benefit conferred by the litigation. See Restatement at\n§ 29(3)(b) (permitting an attorney-fee award from a common\nfund only if “the measurable value added to the beneficiary’s\ninterest in the common fund by the claimant’s intervention\nexceeds the beneficiary’s liability to the claimant”).\n\t        Second, as noted above, the purpose of a fee award\nunder the common-fund and substantial-benefit doctrines is\nto avoid unjust enrichment. Whether the nonparty beneficia-\nries are enriched by the litigation, and whether that enrich-\nment is unjust, does not turn on whether that litigation was\nbrought by an attorney in a representative capacity or a non-\nrepresentative capacity. The California Supreme Court has\nallowed fees to self-represented attorneys in common-fund\ncases on that rationale:\n   “It would be inconsistent with the common fund theory to\n   deny [the self-represented attorney] compensation for his\n   services in these circumstances. The rationale of that the-\n   ory is that fees should be awarded to the person who cre-\n   ates such a fund because all who will benefit from it should\n   bear equally the burdens of its creation or preservation,\n   and this result is best achieved by taxing the fund itself.”\nConsumers Lobby Against Monopolies v. Pub. Utilities Com.,\n25 Cal 3d 891, 914-15, 603 P2d 41 (1979), overruled on other\n\fCite as 360 Or 467 (2016)\t483\n\ngrounds by Kowis v. Howard, 3 Cal 4th 888, 838 P2d 250\n(1992).\n\t        In this case, the litigation benefited nonparty\nPERS members by invalidating COLA reductions, and\nboth Reynolds and Riemer participated in the litigation by\nperforming legal work as lawyers. That remains true even\nthough Reynolds and Riemer performed that work in a\nself-represented capacity. As a result, Reynolds and Riemer\nare entitled to an attorney-fee award necessary to avoid\nunjust enrichment.\nC.  Reasonableness of the Fees Requested\n\t        Determining the amount needed to avoid unjust\nenrichment requires assessing the reasonableness of the\nfees that claimants have requested. Under the common-fund\nand substantial-benefit doctrines, an attorney-fee award is\nlimited to a reasonable fee. Claimants have the burden of\nestablishing the reasonableness of the fees that they are\nrequesting. Strawn, 353 Or at 225. There are three issues in\nthis case related to the reasonableness of the fees requested:\nthe hourly rates; the extent to which the legal work bene-\nfitted the nonparty PERS members, including whether the\nfees requested are duplicative of work by other claimants or\nrelated to unsuccessful claims; and the fee multiplier, if any.\n\t       The special master found that the hourly rates\nsought by Bennett Hartman were appropriate and that\nall of Bennett Hartman’s work benefitted nonparty PERS\nmembers. But the special master determined that Bennett\nHartman was entitled to a fee multiplier of 1.5, rather than\nthe 2.0 fee multiplier that Bennett Hartman sought. The\nspecial master also recommended reasonable attorney fees\nfor Reynolds and Riemer—if this court determines, as we\nhave, that their status as pro se litigants does not prevent\nthem from receiving a fee award. In those alternative rec-\nommendations, the special master calculated the fee award\nusing the hourly rates sought by Reynolds and Riemer, but\nhe excluded work that went to the losing tax-offset claim and\nwork that was duplicative of that performed by Bennett and\nHartman. He concluded that only 20 percent of the work that\nReynolds and Riemer performed benefitted the nonparty\n\f484\t                                           Moro v. State of Oregon\n\nPERS members. Further, the special master recommended\nthat Reynolds and Riemer receive no fee multiplier.\n     1.  Hourly rates\n\t        Bennett Hartman seeks different hourly rates for\ndifferent attorneys, with the maximum rate of $500 per\nhour for its lead counsel, Greg Hartman. Reynolds and\nRiemer also seek fees based on an hourly rate of $500 per\nhour. The special master concluded that Bennett Hartman’s\nrates were reasonable. He did not address the reasonable-\nness of those rates for Reynolds and Riemer, but his alterna-\ntive recommendations were based on the $500-per-hour rate\nsought by Reynolds and Riemer.\n\t        The $500-per-hour rate exceeds Hartman’s normal\nlabor/employment rate of $315 per hour for work that is not\ncontracted to unions, which receive a lower rate because\nthey are long-standing clients. But the market for PERS-\nrelated work is not the same as the market for normal labor/\nemployment work. Reynolds and Riemer offer no evidence\nof their normal market rate. Reynolds appears to be retired\nwithout an active legal practice. And Riemer is the staff\ndirector of the Arizona Judicial Ethics Advisory Committee\nwithout an active private practice.\n\t        A court should not rubberstamp hourly rates, par-\nticularly when an attorney seeks rates beyond what he or\nshe ordinarily would receive from paying clients and when\nthe rates sought are at the very top of the market, such as\nthose in this case. For context, in the 2012 Oregon State Bar\nEconomic Survey, which is the last one available, the hourly\nbilling rate for the 95th percentile of private practice attor-\nneys in Portland was $450, and the 95th percentile for the\nentire state was $405.\n\t        Nevertheless, the rates charged by Hartman and\nReynolds are justified, because they have substantial expe-\nrience in appellate matters and both played a substantial\nrole in earlier PERS litigation.6 Hartman has represented\npetitioners in each of the major PERS cases discussed in the\nMoro I opinion. And Reynolds, while working as Assistant\n\t6\n      The rates attributed to other attorneys at Bennett Hartman were all within\nnormal ranges for their experience levels.\n\fCite as 360 Or 467 (2016)\t485\n\nAttorney General, briefed and argued one of those cases,\nOregon State Police Officers’ Assn. v. State, 323 Or 356, 918\nP2d 765 (1996), and participated in other PERS-related lit-\nigation. As a result, they are uniquely knowledgeable about\nthe mechanics of PERS benefits and the relevant legal argu-\nments. And PERS cases are generally high stakes and are\nboth factually and legally complicated. So a rate at the top\nof the market is not unreasonable for those skills. We there-\nfore conclude that the hourly rates requested by Bennett\nHartman and Reynolds are reasonable.\n\t        It is difficult, however, to justify Riemer’s work at\nthat same rate. Although he has appellate experience brief-\ning and arguing attorney disciplinary cases before this\ncourt in his previous role as General Counsel of the Oregon\nState Bar, he has no particular expertise in PERS litiga-\ntion. Based on his appellate experience but his lack of PERS\nexperience, we conclude that a reasonable hourly rate for\nRiemer’s work is at the 75th percentile from the 2012 report,\nwhich was $350 for Portland.\n    2.  Extent of the benefit provided by the work\n\t        “The cases are unanimous that simply doing work\non behalf of the class does not create a right to compensa-\ntion; the focus is on whether that work provided a benefit to\nthe class.” In re Cendant Corp. Sec. Litig., 404 F3d 173, 191\n(3d Cir 2005) (emphasis in original). For example, this court\nhas previously refused to award substantial-benefit fees to\nparties that “gave no attention in their briefing and argu-\nment to the statute and rule on which the court’s ultimate\ndisposition turned.” Leo v. Keisling, 329 Or 273, 280, 986\nP2d 562 (1999) (refusing equitable fees where the parties\nmade constitutional arguments but the court relied on stat-\nutory grounds to reach its result).\n\t        The principle that compensable legal work must\nbenefit the nonparty beneficiaries has been applied by other\ncourts to deny or reduce fees to account for work on unsuc-\ncessful claims. See, e.g., In re Enron Corp. Sec., Derivative &\nERISA Litig., 586 F Supp 2d 732, 822 (SD Tex 2008) (consid-\nering work on unsuccessful claims). It has also been applied\nto account for duplication of effort. See, e.g., Reynolds v.\nBeneficial Nat. Bank, 288 F3d 277, 288-89 (7th Cir 2002)\n\f486\t                                    Moro v. State of Oregon\n\n(denying fees to settlement objectors who “added nothing”\nbecause lead counsel made same objections). The parties\ndispute the extent to which the requested fees should be\nreduced to account for work on unsuccessful claims or for\nduplicative work. We address those issues separately.\n\t        In this case, petitioners presented numerous argu-\nments related to two broad categories of PERS benefits: the\nCOLA and the income-tax offsets for out-of-state retirees.\nPetitioners prevailed on the COLA claim but not on the\ntax-offset claim. To determine any reasonable amount of\nfees, we must consider whether a fee award should include\nfees for work advancing the unsuccessful claim for tax off-\nsets. The special master did not reduce Bennett Hartman’s\nfees to account for unsuccessful claims, but, in his alterna-\ntive fee award for Reynolds and Riemer, the special mas-\nter reduced the award to account for work on unsuccessful\nclaims. Reynolds and Riemer object to that reduction. And\nstate respondents object to the special master’s failure to\nsimilarly reduce Bennett Hartman’s fees to account for work\non the tax-offset claim.\n\tIn Strunk v PERB, 343 Or 226, 169 P3d 1242 (2007)\n(Strunk III), this court did not reduce attorney-fee awards\nto account for work on unsuccessful claims, but it is unclear\nto what extent that issue was considered by the court or\npreviously presented to the special master in that case.\nNevertheless, while considering other proposed reductions,\nthe court announced the applicable standard for determin-\ning whether work contributed to the benefits in that case:\n   “[A]fter examining respondents’ other billing-related objec-\n   tions and carefully scrutinizing petitioners’ billing records,\n   we conclude that the requisite nexus between the benefits\n   provided in this case and the fees sought as a result is miss-\n   ing for some items that petitioners’ seek compensation for.”\nId. at 240. As a result, the court applied a standard requir-\ning a “nexus between the benefits provided * * * and the fees\nsought.” Id.\n\t        That standard is similar to a frequently used stan-\ndard in other courts: “whether the successful and unsuccess-\nful claims are based upon the same facts and legal theories,\ni.e., whether the claims are related.” In re Enron Corp. Sec.,\n\fCite as 360 Or 467 (2016)\t487\n\nDerivative & ERISA Litig., 586 F Supp 2d at 822 (quotations\nomitted). Under that standard, “[w]hen the successful and\nunsuccessful claims involve a ‘common core of facts’ or ‘are\nbased on related legal theories,’ then attorney fees incurred\nin the presentation of unsuccessful claims are recoverable\non the theory that they contributed to the plaintiff’s ulti-\nmate success.” Id.\n\t        In this case, claimants argue that there was a\nsufficient nexus between the successful COLA claim and\nthe unsuccessful tax-offset claim because the two claims\noverlapped—that is, both were premised on constitutional\nrights against the impairment of contracts, and the fac-\ntual record largely addressed the respondent’s public policy\ndefenses related to economic necessity.\n\t       That overlap fails to establish a sufficient nexus,\nhowever. To the extent that there is overlapping work,\nthat work would be treated as if it went solely to the fee-\ngenerating COLA claim, because fees for that work would\nhave been incurred regardless of the non-fee-generating\nclaim. See Estate of Smith v. Ware, 307 Or 478, 481-82, 769\nP2d 773 (1989) (holding, in a statutory fee case, that overlap-\nping work is treated as going to the fee-generating claim).\nSo the question is the extent to which nonoverlapping work\non the tax-offset claim contributed to the benefits.\n\t         On that question, claimants—including Bennett\nHartman—fail to present grounds for concluding that non-\noverlapping work on the tax-offset claim benefitted the non-\nparty PERS members. The lack of such grounds is acute in\nthis case, because the COLA claim and the tax-offset claim,\nif successful, would have benefitted two different classes\nof potential nonparty beneficiaries. The COLA claim ben-\nefits all PERS members who earned PERS benefits before\nthe 2013 legislative modifications. And the tax-offset claim\nwould have benefitted only those PERS members who\nearned PERS benefits before October 1991—and only those\nwho now or in the future will reside outside of Oregon. It\nis inconsistent with the restitutionary rationale justifying\nthe common-fund and substantial-benefit awards to require\nPERS members who did not earn benefits before October\n1991 to pay for legal work on the tax-offset claim, because\n\f488\t                                  Moro v. State of Oregon\n\nthat work was never going to benefit them in the first place.\nAs a result, all fees awarded to Reynolds, Riemer, and\nBennett Hartman must be reduced to exclude work on the\ntax-offset claim.\n\t        Respondents further argue that claimants’ fees\nshould be reduced to account for duplication of effort. When\ntwo attorneys duplicate their efforts, they are generally\nnot both benefiting the nonparty beneficiaries of the liti-\ngation, because the same benefit would result even if one\nof the attorneys had not performed the duplicative work.\nThe special master recommended finding that, in this case,\nReynolds, Riemer, and Bennett Hartman duplicated their\nefforts because each presented substantially similar legal\narguments with regards to the prevailing claim—namely,\nthat the COLA adjustments violated the right against\nimpairment of contract. The special master recommended\naccounting for that duplication by reducing the fees awarded\nto Reynolds and Riemer, but not the fees awarded to Bennett\nHartman.\n\t        Reynolds and Riemer object to the reductions rec-\nommended by the special master. They argue that there\nare no grounds in this case to determine that their work\nduplicated Bennett Hartman instead of determining that\nBennett Hartman duplicated their work. In Strunk III, for\nexample, the court stated that “the fact that petitioners’ law-\nyers briefed some of the same issues in the course of bring-\ning their cases to this court * * * without more, is insufficient\nto support” reducing the awards for duplication of effort.\n343 Or at 239. The court went on to say that the record in\nthat case did not allow the court to determine which attor-\nneys duplicated the efforts of which other attorneys. Id.\n(“[T]hat argument assumes that the efforts of the Strunk\npetitioners’ and their lawyers was the sine qua non of the\nfund preserved here, while the work product of the other\nparties named as petitioners in this case derived solely from\nthat effort.”).\n\t        This case, however, is distinguishable from Strunk\nIII. In that case, the special master made no findings rel-\nevant to the issue of duplication. Moro II, 358 Or at 381\n(“In Strunk III, the record created by the parties before the\n\fCite as 360 Or 467 (2016)\t489\n\nspecial master did not allow this court to determine the\nextent to which those attorneys had duplicated their efforts\nor directed their efforts toward unsuccessful claims.”).\nIn this case, however, by recommending that we reduce\nReynolds’ and Riemer’s fees to account for duplication of\nBennett Hartman, the special master found, in effect, that\nBennett Hartman acted as the lead counsel. That conclu-\nsion is in accord with the apparent role of the attorneys in\nthe case, with Bennett Hartman taking the lead role in lit-\nigating each stage of the case, from the factfinding proceed-\nings before the special master to oral arguments before this\ncourt.\n\t        Because Bennett Hartman clearly acted as lead\ncounsel, Reynolds and Riemer had the burden to demon-\nstrate that the contributions of their work went beyond that\nperformed by Bennett Hartman. See, e.g., In re Cendant\nCorp. Sec. Litig., 404 F3d at 191 (“In the ordinary case,\nmost work that lead counsel does will typically advance\nthe class’s interests, but the inquiry into non-lead counsel’s\nwork must be more detailed. Non-lead counsel will have to\ndemonstrate that their work conferred a benefit on the class\nbeyond that conferred by lead counsel.” (Emphasis in origi-\nnal.)). Reynolds and Riemer have not satisfied that burden\nbeyond the fact that their duplicative work likely added some\nmarginal persuasive force to the argument. As a result, we\nconclude that Reynolds’ and Riemer’s fee awards should be\nreduced to account for their duplication of effort.\n\t        Having established that claimants should not receive\nfees for work on the unsuccessful tax-offset claim and that\nReynolds and Riemer should not receive fees for work that\nduplicated Bennett Hartman’s work on the COLA claim, we\nmust determine how much that work amounts to. The diffi-\nculty with making that determination is that claimants pro-\nvided this court with billing records that largely omit any\nreference to which claim they were working on. That omis-\nsion weighs against claimants, because it is their burden to\nestablish the reasonableness of the fees they are requesting.\nStrawn, 353 Or at 225. Claimants chose not to update their\nbilling records even after this court instructed the special\nmaster to make findings of fact on those issues and even\nafter the special master allowed claimants the opportunity\n\f490\t                                  Moro v. State of Oregon\n\nto do so. See Moro II, 358 Or at 381 (“[W]e instruct the spe-\ncial master to make findings of fact, if possible, on the extent\nto which the attorneys duplicated their efforts or directed\ntheir efforts toward unsuccessful claims.”).\n\t        Without updated billing records, the special mas-\nter determined that Reynolds and Riemer should receive\n20 percent of their requested fees and made no findings\nwith regard to Bennett Hartman’s work on the tax-offset\nclaim. As noted, Reynolds and Riemer object to the special\nmaster’s reduction, and state respondents again argue that\nthose individuals should receive no fees and that Bennett\nHartman’s award should be reduced to account for duplica-\ntion, as well as for work on the tax-offset claim.\n\t        We agree with some of respondents’ arguments\nregarding the special master’s determinations. Moreover,\nbecause claimants have the burden of establishing their\nentitlement to fees and the reasonableness of their request,\nthe lack of more specific billing records weighs against them.\nAlthough we have some, often nonspecific, time-keeping\nrecords, as well as the transcript of the special master’s\nhearing on the merits and the briefing before the special\nmaster and in this court, adjustments to the fee requests to\naccount for duplication and work on the unsuccessful claims\nare admittedly rough. Nevertheless, we agree with the spe-\ncial master that adjustments are appropriate for time spent\non the unsuccessful tax-offset claim and for duplication of\nwork. We also agree with the special master’s implicit find-\ning that Bennett Hartman acted as lead counsel throughout\nthe proceeding.\n\t        Our review of the record and the proceedings in\nthe litigation suggests substantial duplication by Reynolds\nand Riemer of the arguments of lead counsel concerning\nthe COLA and substantial time spent on the tax-offset\nissue. The latter, of course, is not surprising, as Reynolds\nand Riemer, PERS retirees now living outside the state, are\ndirectly affected by that change in PERS benefits. As to the\nduplication of effort on the COLA, Reynolds’ and Riemer’s\nsubmissions do not identify any specific value that their\nwork added to petitioners’ case or any novel legal or factual\nargument that Bennett Hartman did not make and that\n\fCite as 360 Or 467 (2016)\t491\n\nthis court relied on in its decision. Respondents assert that\nReynolds and Riemer should receive no fee award because all\ntheir work essentially duplicated Bennett Hartman’s work.\nIn our view, as noted, their work likely added some marginal\npersuasive force to petitioners’ arguments. In these circum-\nstances, we conclude that probably 90 percent of the time\nincurred by Reynolds and Riemer essentially duplicated\nBennett Hartman’s work on the COLA issue or was spent\non the tax-offset issue. Therefore, Reynolds and Riemer are\nentitled to 10 percent of their requested time. That entitles\nReynolds to compensation for 56.2 hours, which, at $500 per\nhour, results in a lodestar amount of $28,100. Riemer is enti-\ntled to compensation for 26.5 hours, which, at $350 per hour,\nresults in a lodestar of $9,275.\n\t        As noted, the special master made no adjustment\nto the Bennett Hartman request for work on the tax-offset\nclaim. Based on our review of the record, and again con-\nsidering the burden on the claimants to prove their claim\nfor fees, we find that 20 percent of the time submitted by\nBennett Hartman went to work on the tax-offset claim that\ndid not overlap with the COLA claim. Therefore, Bennett\nHartman is entitled to 80 percent of its requested time. That\nentitles Bennett Hartman to compensation for 1,355 hours,\nwhich results in a lodestar of $560,399.46.\n    3.  Fee multiplier\n\t        The final component in determining a reasonable\nfee award is the multiplier. The special master recom-\nmended awarding Bennett Hartman a 1.5 fee multiplier for\nthe exceptional success of the litigation and, in his alter-\nnative recommendations, recommended no fee multiplier for\nReynolds and Riemer. Bennett Hartman does not object to\nthe recommended fee multiplier of 1.5. Reynolds and Riemer\nargue that they are entitled to the same fee multiplier as\nBennett Hartman because they shared in the same excep-\ntional success of the litigation.\n\t        The grounds for a fee multiplier have been stated\ndifferently in different cases. In Strawn, this court noted\nthat a fee multiplier may be justified to account for the risk\nof nonpayment in a contingency fee case. 353 Or at 226. In\n\f492\t                                              Moro v. State of Oregon\n\nStrunk III, the court justified a fee multiplier based on the\n“exceptional success” of the litigation, securing over $1 bil-\nlion in benefits for PERS members. 343 Or at 246. The court\nthen stated that “factors such as the difficulty and complex-\nity of the issues involved in this case, the value of the inter-\nests at stake, as well as the skill and professional standing\nof lawyers involved also support an enhancement of fees.” Id.\n\t         In this case, we place greater weight on the risk\nof nonpayment, because the additional factors discussed in\nStrunk III were already considered when determining rea-\nsonable hourly rates for claimants’ work. As noted, none of\nthe claimants rely on a market rate that reflects a negoti-\nated rate with a client. So the hourly rates are a construc-\ntion based on the same type of factors noted in Strunk III to\ncalculate a fee multiplier. That is particularly true because,\nas noted above, the stakes of the litigation are a factor in\ndetermining the attorneys’ hourly rates. Although the mon-\netary impact of this case will, over time, be larger than\nthe monetary impact of the Strunk litigation, that impact\nreflects the higher dollar value of the COLA change that the\ncourt invalidated, rather than a more exceptional success\nby the attorneys as compared to the attorneys in the Strunk\nlitigation.7 The justification for a higher hourly rate is that\nwe would have expected another attorney who could also\ncommand that rate to reach a similar result in this case.\n\t        Nevertheless, a fee multiplier may be justified\nwhen the attorney’s payment is based on a contingency-fee\narrangement or there is otherwise a delay in getting paid.\nBennett Hartman was on a quasi-contingency-fee arrange-\nment, because, although it was paid its normal union rates,\nit retained the right to seek to recover and keep market\nrates in a fee request, if it prevailed. We therefore find that\nBennett Hartman is entitled to the fee multiplier of 1.5 rec-\nommended by the special master.\n\t      Reynolds and Riemer, however, were not working\nbased on a contingency-fee or even quasi-contingency-fee\narrangement. Instead, as self-represented parties, they did\n\t7\n      In Strunk III, the court awarded the fee multipliers sought by the claim-\nants. 343 Or at 246. For some, that was a 2.0 fee multiplier; and for others (includ-\ning Bennett Hartman), that was a 1.5 fee multiplier. Id. at 233.\n\fCite as 360 Or 467 (2016)\t493\n\nnot have a fee arrangement at all. Therefore, the grounds\nthat entitle Bennett Hartman to a 1.5 fee multiplier do not\napply to Reynolds and Riemer. And the other factors justify-\ning a fee multiplier in Strunk were already used to calculate\ntheir reasonable hourly rates. Therefore, consistent with the\nspecial master’s recommendation, we find that Reynolds\nand Riemer are not entitled to a fee multiplier.\n\t       Based on those findings, and our findings above\nestablishing the reasonable rates and reasonable time for\nclaimants, we conclude that Bennett Hartman is entitled\nto $840,599.19 in attorney fees, Reynolds is entitled to\n$28,100 in attorney fees, and Riemer is entitled to $9,275 in\nattorney fees. When combined with the cost awards noted\nabove, we conclude that each claimant is entitled to the fol-\nlowing awards: Bennett Hartman, $902,665.32; Reynolds,\n$29,314.48; Riemer, $10,434.15; Jones, $1,379.\nC.  Funding the Fee Award\n\t        Having calculated the amounts to which claimants\nare entitled, we turn to the issue of the appropriate source\nof payment. The restitutionary principles underlying an\naward of fees from a common fund suggest that the award\nbe paid from the PERF in a manner that affects only the\nPERS members who benefit from the litigation—and not\nPERS members who do not benefit from the litigation or\nPERS employers. And, ideally, PERS members would con-\ntribute to the fee award in proportion to the benefits that\nthey receive. See Restatement at § 29(2) (beneficiaries may\nbe required to pay from the “common fund for their benefit,\nin proportion to their respective interests therein”).\n\t        But there are administrative obstacles to reaching\nthose ideals—namely, there is no segregated fund consist-\ning of the increased COLAs that PERS members who will\nbenefit from the litigation will receive over time. (Indeed,\nbecause of the different terms of service and retirement\nstatus of those members, there could not be such a fund.)\nInstead, the PERF is made up of numerous accounts that\nare designated for different purposes. According to a decla-\nration submitted by PERS Assistant Chief Administrative\nOfficer Mary Dunn, there are three accounts (or categories\nof accounts) containing money belonging to PERS members.\n\f494\t                                 Moro v. State of Oregon\n\nRetired members have money in the “benefits-in-force”\nreserve. Nonretired Tier One and Tier Two members have\nmoney in their “member accounts.” And all PERS members\nwho earned benefits after the 2001 creation of the Oregon\nPublic Service Retirement Plan (OPSRP), which includes\nTier One, Tier Two, and OPSRP members, have money in\nthe Individual Account Program.\n\t        Money in those accounts is invested, and the invest-\nment income is credited back into the accounts. According to\nDunn, PERB can take money out of the investment income\nbefore it is credited back into the specific accounts and use\nthat money to pay for the award of fees and costs. And,\nbecause the credits are made proportional to each member’s\ninterest, withdrawing money from the investment income is\nautomatically ratable (in the same way that requiring a cor-\nporation to pay a fee award in a common-fund or substantial-\nbenefit case is automatically ratable to each shareholder’s\ninterest in ownership).\n\t        The problem with that approach is that the fee\naward must be paid now, while the actual value of the COLA\nbenefits to specific PERS members will depend on which tier\nthe member is in, as well as on future events. Tier One and\nTier Two members, but not OPSRP members, are entitled to\ntheir COLA “bank” established prior to the amendments at\nissue, which increases the value of the benefits. Moro I, 357\nOr at 186-87 (describing COLA bank). Further, the earlier\na member retires and begins to receive benefits, the more\nyears he or she will receive COLA adjustments. As a result,\nthe COLA benefits will comprise a larger portion of those\nmembers’ expected PERS benefits.\n\t        As an alternative, Bennett Hartman suggests\nthat at least some of the money for the fee award could be\ndrawn from the PERS contingency reserve. The contingency\nreserve is funded through money that PERB sets aside from\ninvestment income in certain years. ORS 238.670(1)(a).\nOne of the statutory purposes for the contingency reserve is\n“[t]o pay any legal expenses or judgments that do not arise\nin the ordinary course of adjudicating an individual mem-\nber’s benefits or an individual employer’s liabilities.” ORS\n238.670(1)(b). This fee award fits that statutory description.\n\fCite as 360 Or 467 (2016)\t495\n\nRespondents object, however, noting that the contingency\nreserve is funded through investment income from the\nentire PERF, which includes funds containing employer con-\ntributions that have not yet been allocated to other accounts.\nIf the fee award is paid from the contingency reserve, they\npoint out, then PERB may have to make larger future pay-\nments into the contingency reserve, which will be taken in\npart from employer contributions. The effect of that would\nbe to marginally increase the amount that employers will\nneed to contribute in the future.\n\t        The special master did not make any finding as to\nwhich PERF accounts would be appropriate to use and how\nmuch money should be used from each account. Instead,\nhe recommended ordering PERB to pay the award and to\nresolve later disputes that arise, if any, about the manner in\nwhich it had paid for the award.\n\t        We agree that the better course is to allow PERB\nto determine, consistent with its statutory authority and\nfiduciary obligations, how best to allocate the burdens of the\nfee award among the accounts, including the contingency\nreserve, held within the PERF. Our cases recognize that trust\nlaw principles and applicable statutes give PERB discretion\nto make reasonable decisions in operating PERS. See White\nv. Public Employees Retirement Board, 351 Or 426, 440-41,\n268 P3d 600 (2011) (discussing PERB’s duties and author-\nity). That authority to operate the system includes making\ndecisions related to litigation, and, as long as PERB acts\nreasonably and consistently with statutory requirements\nand its fiduciary duty to members, such decisions ordinarily\nwill be upheld, unless PERB has abused its discretion. Id. at\n442-45 (discussing PERB’s authority to conduct and settle\nlitigation). We direct PERB to pay the amounts ordered from\nsuch PERF accounts as it deems appropriate, in the exercise\nof its discretion and subject to its statutory and fiduciary\nobligations and the principles discussed in this opinion.\n\t        To summarize: We conclude that Bennett Hartman\nis entitled to $902,665.32 in costs and attorney fees;\nReynolds is entitled to $29,314.48 in costs and attorney\nfees; Riemer is entitled to $10,434.15 in costs and attorney\nfees; and Jones is entitled to $1,379.24 in costs. PERB shall\n\f496\t                              Moro v. State of Oregon\n\ndetermine, consistently with this opinion, how to pay the\naward from the accounts held in PERF and shall pay the\namounts awarded.\n\t      Attorney fees and costs awarded.\n\f",
