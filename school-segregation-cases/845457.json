The district court granted a certificate of appealability (“COA”)\nauthorizing Pruett to appeal the denial of habeas relief on two related claims.\nPruett requests an expansion of the COA to include an additional claim. For the\n\n\n        *\n         Pursuant to 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not\nbe published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH CIR.\nR. 47.5.4.\n\f   Case: 10-70024   Document: 00511707536     Page: 2   Date Filed: 12/27/2011\n\n\n\n                                 No. 10-70024\n\nreasons that follow, we AFFIRM the district court’s denial of habeas relief and\nDENY Pruett’s request to expand the COA.\n                                       I.\n      Pruett was sentenced to 99 years in prison for his role in the 1995 murder\nof Ray Yarborough. His father and brother were also convicted for their roles in\nthe Yarborough murder.\n      On December 17, 1999, while in prison, Pruett missed getting a hot lunch\nand was given a sack lunch. He attempted to take his lunch into the recreation\narea, which was in violation of prison rules. Officer Nagle told Pruett that he\nneeded to eat his lunch before going to the recreation area, and wrote a\ndisciplinary charge against Pruett. Later that afternoon, when Nagle was in his\noffice adjoining a multi-purpose room, Pruett stabbed Nagle eight times with a\n“shank” made of a metal rod sharpened to a point at one end, and wrapped in\ntape at the other end. According to the autopsy report, Nagle died from a heart\nattack that he suffered as a result of the trauma caused by the stab wounds.\nThe murder weapon and a torn disciplinary report against Pruett, charging him\nwith attempting to take food into an unauthorized area, were found at the scene\nof the attack.\n      John Lee Davis of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice Office of\nInspector General testified that after Pruett was arrested, Pruett stated, “Go\nahead and run that disciplinary case on me now. Oop[s], I want to call my first\nwitness, Officer Nagle. Oops, he’s dead.” Davis said that Pruett then began\nlaughing.\n      Much of the remaining evidence against Pruett consisted of testimony\nfrom inmates. Inmates Allen Thompson and Johnny Barnett testified that they\nwere in the multi-purpose room and saw and heard Pruett attacking Nagle.\nInmate Anthony Casey testified that he heard Pruett talking about a weapon\nwith another inmate before the attack. Casey, through a recreation yard\n\n                                       2\n\f   Case: 10-70024    Document: 00511707536      Page: 3   Date Filed: 12/27/2011\n\n\n\n                                  No. 10-70024\n\nwindow, later saw Pruett near Nagle’s desk, and then saw Pruett remove his\nclothing in a hallway and push it through a gas port into the recreation yard.\nInmates James Dale Keller, Robert Michael Lewis, and Jimmy Mullican testified\nthat they witnessed Pruett’s attack on Nagle from the craft shop across from the\nmulti-purpose room. Inmate Harold Mitchell testified that he was in the multi-\npurpose room before the attack. He said that Pruett came into the room and\nsuggested that he leave because Pruett was going to “do something.” When\nMitchell questioned Pruett, Pruett said that he was going to kill Nagle.\nAccording to Mitchell, Pruett said that he was tired of life in prison and wasn’t\ngoing to kill himself, but didn’t have a problem making the State do it for him.\n      At the guilt-innocence phase of the trial, Pruett testified that he was in\nprison because “my father killed my neighbor.” He said that he was convicted\nof murder when he was fifteen years old and that he went to the penitentiary\nwhen he was sixteen years old. He explained that on December 17, 1999, he was\nupset about missing a hot lunch and that he cursed at Nagle when Nagle refused\nto allow him to take his sack lunch into the recreation yard. He said that after\nhe went outside, he saw, through the window, that Nagle was writing a\ndisciplinary report against him. He already had another disciplinary case\npending for gambling, which he said was the way he made money for personal\nitems inasmuch as he did not receive any outside financial support. He said that\nhe had cut his hand while lifting weights in the recreation yard, and had used\nhis shirt to stop the bleeding. He said that he later decided to talk to Nagle\nabout the disciplinary case and went to see Nagle, who tore up the report.\n      Pruett testified that he left Nagle, got some clean clothes, and got in line\nfor the “chow hall.” The cut on his thumb reopened and he got more blood on his\nclothes. Then prison officers made everyone go into the gym, where he heard\nthat Nagle “got whooped.” Pruett said that he told the officers, when he was\narrested, that “I ain’t ever killed nobody in my life.”\n\n                                         3\n\f   Case: 10-70024   Document: 00511707536      Page: 4   Date Filed: 12/27/2011\n\n\n\n                                  No. 10-70024\n\n      On cross-examination, Pruett denied that he had told inmate Michael Hall\nthat he had killed Nagle. He also denied telling corrections officer Michael\nBaumann that he had killed before and would do it again. He admitted that he\nhad sent inmate Michael Ross a letter, through defense counsel’s investigator,\njust before trial, asking Ross to testify that he (Pruett) had cut his hand on the\nweights.\n      In rebuttal, the prosecutor called Michael Hall and Michael Ross. Each\nof them testified that Pruett admitted to them that he had killed Nagle. The\nprosecutor also called Officer Michael Baumann, who testified that he wrote a\ndisciplinary report on Pruett after Pruett threatened to kill him on August 25,\n2001. Defense counsel called Pruett to the stand again to rebut the testimony\nof Hall, Ross, and Baumann.\n      The jury found Pruett guilty of capital murder.\n      At the punishment phase of the trial, the prosecution called three\ncorrections officers who testified about the disciplinary charges they had\nreported for Pruett’s misconduct. Jane Yarborough, the wife of Pruett’s first\nmurder victim, testified that her husband had been stabbed five to seven times.\nThe chief of classification at the Connally Unit testified as the custodian of\nrecords for Pruett’s prison records which were offered into evidence by the\nprosecution.\n      Pruett’s father testified at the punishment phase that he was incarcerated\nwhen Pruett was born. He said that he met Pruett for the first time when Pruett\nwas seven years old. He stated that he was in prison for stabbing his neighbor,\nRay Yarborough, five or six times. He explained that when the murder occurred,\nboth of his sons were with him, but they did not know he was going to stab\nYarborough. He testified that he was tried with his sons, and that Pruett was\nonly fifteen years old at the time. He stated that he was sentenced to life in\n\n\n\n                                        4\n\f   Case: 10-70024    Document: 00511707536      Page: 5   Date Filed: 12/27/2011\n\n\n\n                                  No. 10-70024\n\nprison for Yarborough’s murder, Pruett’s brother, who was 25 years old at the\ntime, was sentenced to 40 years, and Pruett was sentenced to 99 years.\n      Pruett’s brother testified that his family had been poor and that they were\nknown as gypsies. He said that his father was in and out of the penitentiary and\nthat his mother cleaned houses. He said that he kicked Yarborough, but that\nPruett didn’t do anything to Yarborough. He also said that Pruett did not\nthreaten anyone when he was sentenced for Yarborough’s murder.\n      Pruett testified again at the punishment phase. He said that his family\nwas poor and moved around a lot. According to Pruett, his mother was “not all\nthe way there mentally,” she did not finish high school, and she had physical\nhandicaps. He testified that he had been “getting high” with his parents since\nhe was seven or eight years old, and had used marijuana and cocaine, but not\nheroin or crack. He testified that he finished the eighth grade in school, but that\nwhile he was in prison he had obtained his GED and had completed eighteen\nhours of college credit. He admitted that he was the cause of Yarborough’s\nmurder. He explained that they had argued because he had stolen some guns,\nYarborough had taken some of them, and he wanted money for the guns to buy\nfood. He said that his brother and father came to help him, they wrestled with\nYarborough, and his father stabbed Yarborough. He also testified to his version\nof the incidents that were the subject of the disciplinary charges against him.\n      Robert Chance, an assistant warden at the Polunsky Unit, testified for the\ndefense about the prison classification system and the various security levels.\nLaura Menn, another witness for the defense, testified that she was a teacher\nfor the prison school district. She stated that she had taught Pruett while he\nwas in prison and that he had been a very good student, did his work, was very\nbright, and was always very respectful to her. Pruett’s cousin, Christine Hinson,\ntestified that Pruett’s childhood was dysfunctional, that he was left to roam the\n\n\n\n                                        5\n\f   Case: 10-70024    Document: 00511707536      Page: 6   Date Filed: 12/27/2011\n\n\n\n                                  No. 10-70024\n\nstreets to look for food, and that her mother fed him because his mother often\nwas away from home for days at a time.\n      Dr. Gilda Kessner, a clinical psychologist, testified for the defense as\nfollows. Based on her review of records and interviews, Pruett was born into a\nchaotic family environment, received no nurturing, and grew up in an\natmosphere of poverty, crime, and substance abuse. When Pruett was placed in\nan adult criminal setting as an adolescent he was denied the chance to take\nadvantage of alternatives to adult prison that were available and thus did not\nhave any opportunity to develop his positive qualities.\n      With respect to Pruett’s risk for future dangerousness, Kessner testified\nthat there were no studies or statistical models for inmates who killed while in\nprison, because the number of such inmates was too small to be statistically\nreliable. She also testified that the risk of violence decreases as an inmate ages.\nOn cross-examination, she testified that Pruett’s behavior that was the subject\nof the disciplinary charges against him was commonplace behavior for someone\nwho is facing a long sentence. When the prosecutor asked her if Pruett would\nbe a danger to people in the future, she testified that “there is not a zero\nprobability for anybody,” but that any risk of future danger that he might\npresent could be managed within the prison system.\n      In rebuttal, the State called Detective Allen Beall of the Harris County\nSheriff’s Department, who had investigated the 1995 Yarborough murder.\nDetective Beall testified that his investigation showed that Pruett punched,\nkicked, and held Yarborough down during the assault that killed him. He also\ntestified that no guns were found at Yarborough’s residence or in his truck. He\ntestified that he was in the courtroom when Pruett was sentenced for the\nYarborough murder and that he heard Pruett say that everyone was to stay\naway from him or he would kill “all of y’all,” referring to everyone in court.\n\n\n\n                                        6\n\f   Case: 10-70024    Document: 00511707536      Page: 7   Date Filed: 12/27/2011\n\n\n\n                                  No. 10-70024\n\n      Warden Thomas Prasifka, of the McConnell Unit, testified in rebuttal for\nthe State that it would not be unusual for an inmate who had been convicted of\ncapital murder to get out of administrative segregation (where he is kept in his\ncell for twenty-three hours a day and isolated at all times).\n      The jury answered the special punishment issue on future dangerousness\naffirmatively, and the special punishment issue on mitigation negatively. Pruett\nwas sentenced to death. His conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct\nappeal. Pruett v. State, No. 74,370, 2004 WL 3093232 (Tex. Crim. App. Sept. 22,\n2004) (unpublished). Pruett did not file a petition for a writ of certiorari.\n      Pruett filed an application for state habeas relief. The state habeas trial\ncourt conducted an evidentiary hearing and issued findings of fact and\nconclusions of law recommending that Pruett’s conviction be reversed because\nthe prosecution had violated a pretrial discovery order, but recommending that\nrelief be denied on all of Pruett’s other claims. See Ex parte Pruett, 207 S.W.3d\n767 (Tex. Crim. App. 2005). The Court of Criminal Appeals adopted the trial\ncourt’s findings and conclusions, except for those upon which the trial court\nrecommended granting relief, and denied state habeas relief. Id.\n      Pruett then filed in federal court a petition for a writ of habeas corpus\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2254. After hearing oral argument, the district court\ngranted the State’s motion for summary judgment and denied federal habeas\nrelief. Pruett v. Thaler, No. C-06-CA-465-H (S.D. Tex. Aug. 12, 2010). The\ndistrict court granted Pruett’s application for a COA, authorizing him to appeal\nthe denial of relief as to two related claims. Pruett has asked this Court to grant\na COA for an additional claim.\n                                        II.\n      First, we will address the claims for which the district court granted a\nCOA. Then we will turn to consider Pruett’s request to expand the COA.\n                                        A.\n\n                                        7\n\f   Case: 10-70024      Document: 00511707536     Page: 8    Date Filed: 12/27/2011\n\n\n\n                                   No. 10-70024\n\n      The district court granted a COA for Pruett’s claims that his rights to due\nprocess, effective assistance of counsel, and confrontation were violated (1) by\nthe State’s failure to disclose to the defense that Michael Hall and Michael Ross\nwere going to testify that Pruett had admitted to them that he killed Nagle, and\n(2) by the trial court’s refusal to require the State to disclose notes of the State’s\ninvestigator’s interviews with those witnesses. Because those claims are related,\nwe will discuss them together. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals denied\nrelief on these claims on the ground that there is no federal constitutional right\nto discovery in a criminal case. Ex parte Pruett, 207 S.W.3d at 767. Because\nthese claims were adjudicated on the merits by the Texas Court of Criminal\nAppeals, our consideration of them is governed by 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d). That\nsection provides:\n            An application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a\n      person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court shall\n      not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on\n      the merits in State court proceedings unless the adjudication of the\n      claim–\n\n           (1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an\n      unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as\n      determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or\n\n            (2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable\n      determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the\n      State court proceeding.\n28 U.S.C. § 2254(d).\n      A state court’s decision is “contrary to . . . clearly established precedent if\nthe state court applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in [the\nSupreme Court’s] cases.” Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 405 (2000). “A state-\ncourt decision will also be contrary to . . . clearly established precedent if the\nstate court confronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a\ndecision of [the Supreme Court] and nevertheless arrives at a result different\n\n                                          8\n\f   Case: 10-70024    Document: 00511707536     Page: 9   Date Filed: 12/27/2011\n\n\n\n                                  No. 10-70024\n\nfrom [Supreme Court] precedent.” Id. at 406. “A state-court decision involves\nan unreasonable application of [Supreme Court] precedent if the state court\nidentifies the correct governing legal rule from [the] Court’s cases but\nunreasonably applies it to the facts of the particular state prisoner’s case.” Id.\nat 407. “A state court’s determination that a claim lacks merit precludes federal\nhabeas relief so long as fairminded jurists could disagree on the correctness of\nthe state court’s decision.” Harrington v. Richter, 131 S. Ct. 770, 786 (2011)\n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n      Prior to trial, Pruett filed a motion for discovery. The trial court granted\nhis request to require the State to disclose certain evidence, including “the\nsubstance of any oral statements made by the accused . . . and a list of witnesses\nto the making and acknowledgment of such statement.” The trial court denied\nhis request for “the names and addresses of witnesses the State intends to call\nin rebuttal, together with information required to be disclosed in connection with\nother witnesses and a specific statement as to the substance of the testimony\nsuch witnesses will give at the trial of the cause.”\n      As we have already noted, Pruett testified at the guilt-innocence phase\nand denied that he killed Nagle. On cross-examination, the prosecutor asked\nPruett if he had told Michael Hall that he had killed Nagle, and that he just\ncouldn’t stop himself. Pruett denied making such statements. In the middle of\nhis cross-examination, at a bench conference outside the presence of the jury, the\nprosecutor stated that the State was going to call Michael Ross to rebut Pruett’s\ndenial that he murdered Nagle, and to relate how Pruett had asked Ross to\ntestify falsely about some of the facts of the murder. Defense counsel did not\nobject. Later, after the remaining defense witnesses had testified, the prosecutor\nstated to the court and defense counsel that he was going to call four rebuttal\nwitnesses, including Michael Hall and Michael Ross.\n\n\n\n                                        9\n\f  Case: 10-70024    Document: 00511707536       Page: 10   Date Filed: 12/27/2011\n\n\n\n                                  No. 10-70024\n\n      The prosecutor called Michael Hall as the State’s first rebuttal witness,\nwith no objection from the defense. Hall testified that Pruett had admitted to\nhim that he had stabbed Nagle. Prior to cross-examining Hall, defense counsel\nasked if Hall had made a written statement. The prosecutor responded that he\nhad not, and that all the prosecution had was work product consisting of notes\ntaken during an interview.       The prosecutor had used those notes while\nconducting direct examination. Defense counsel cross-examined Hall, asking\nhim questions about who he had discussed his testimony with, what he was\nconvicted of, and whether he had been promised a letter recommending parole\nin exchange for his testimony.\n      Ross was also called to testify without objection. Ross initially had been\non Pruett’s witness list. Ross testified that Pruett had admitted to him that he\nhad stabbed Nagle. Ross also testified that he had been shown a letter from\nPruett by the defense investigator, Jim Dickson. In that letter, Pruett had asked\nRoss if he “remembered” that Pruett had cut his hand while lifting weights.\nRoss stated that he told Dickson that there was nothing he could do for Pruett.\nOn cross-examination, Ross, who was serving a 99-year sentence, testified that\nhe would receive a “safe passage” in return for his testimony. He explained that\n“safe passage” meant that his safety would be guaranteed for the remainder of\nhis sentence. Defense counsel did not ask for any notes or statements prior to\nor during his cross-examination of Ross.\n      After both Hall and Ross had testified, defense counsel complained,\noutside the presence of the jury, that the prosecution had failed to disclose to the\ndefense that Pruett had admitted to Hall and Ross that he had killed Nagle. The\nprosecutor argued that the discovery order did not apply to rebuttal witnesses.\n      Three days later, Pruett filed a motion for a mistrial or to strike the\nrebuttal testimony of Hall and Ross. Defense counsel argued that the discovery\norder required the State to disclose the names of the witnesses as well as the\n\n                                        10\n\f  Case: 10-70024    Document: 00511707536      Page: 11   Date Filed: 12/27/2011\n\n\n\n                                  No. 10-70024\n\nstatements that Pruett had made to them. The State argued that because the\nevidence came during rebuttal, it was not required to be disclosed under the\nterms of the pretrial order. The trial court denied the defense motion for a\nmistrial or to strike the rebuttal testimony of Hall and Ross.\n      The state habeas trial court judge (who was not the same judge who had\nentered the pretrial discovery order and conducted the trial) found that the State\nintentionally failed to disclose Pruett’s admissions to Hall and Ross, in violation\nof the discovery order, and recommended that Pruett’s conviction be reversed.\nThe judge reasoned that, although the discovery order had denied Pruett’s\nrequest for the identities and substance of the testimony of rebuttal witnesses,\nother provisions of the discovery order required disclosure. He concluded that\nthe State’s investigator’s notes taken during the interviews of Hall and Ross\nconstituted witness statements under the Texas Rules of Evidence, that the\nnotes contained unspecified inconsistencies with trial testimony, and that the\ndefense was entitled to use those notes in cross-examination.          The judge\nconcluded that the State had acted in bad faith in deliberately disregarding the\npretrial discovery order to obtain an advantage. He concluded further that the\ntrial judge had abused his discretion in allowing the testimony about Pruett’s\ninculpatory statements and in denying the defense access to the investigator’s\ninterview notes. He found that the defense was impaired because defense\nattorneys have a right to depend on prosecutors’ complying with pretrial\ndiscovery orders, and the defense was not in a position to anticipate the\ntestimony.\n      In Wooten v. Thaler, our court observed that “there is a line of authority\nthat leaves open the possibility that a defendant who is deliberately misled as to\nthe full weight and import of the state’s evidence might have a cognizable due\nprocess claim.” 598 F.3d 215, 220 (5th Cir. 2010) (citing Gray v. Netherland, 518\nU.S. 152, 165-66 (1996)). Although the state habeas trial court found that the\n\n                                        11\n\f  Case: 10-70024       Document: 00511707536          Page: 12     Date Filed: 12/27/2011\n\n\n\n                                       No. 10-70024\n\nState intentionally failed to disclose Pruett’s admissions to Hall and Ross, and\nconcluded that the State had acted in bad faith in deliberately disregarding the\npretrial discovery order to obtain an advantage, the Texas Court of Criminal\nAppeals did not adopt those findings of fact and conclusions of law.1 Accordingly,\neven if the “possibility” of a cognizable due process claim based on deliberate\ndeception “rises to the level of clearly established law sufficient to support a\nhabeas petition on AEDPA review,” id. at 221, the Texas Court of Criminal\nAppeals did not adopt the state habeas trial court’s finding of deliberate\ndeception. In rejecting Pruett’s claims, the Court of Criminal Appeals stated:\n       According to the United States Supreme Court, “There is no general\n       constitutional right to discovery in a criminal case.” [Weatherford\n       v. Bursey, 429 U.S. 545, 559 (1977); United States v. Ruiz, 536 U.S.\n       622, 629 (2002).] Although the Due Process Clause confers upon\n       defendants a right to be informed about the existence of exculpatory\n       evidence, it does not require the prosecution to “reveal before trial\n       the names of all witnesses who will testify unfavorably.” [Bursey,\n       429 U.S. at 559.] As for the trial court’s conclusion that the failure\n       to reveal the inculpatory statements also violated the rules of\n       evidence and the trial court’s discovery order, such violations, even\n       if they occurred, would not be grounds for relief on habeas corpus.\n       [Ex parte Pena, 71 S.W.3d 336, 336-337 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002)\n       (habeas relief unavailable for a claim that does not involve a\n       jurisdictional defect or a violation of constitutional or fundamental\n       rights).]\nEx parte Pruett, 207 S.W.3d at 767 (footnotes in brackets).\n       Pruett argues that the State’s violation of the pretrial discovery order\nviolated his due process rights and his right to the effective assistance of counsel.\nHe points out that his conviction is based on the testimony of convicted felons\n\n\n       1\n         Pruett contends that the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals did not explicitly reject the\ntrial court’s findings and conclusions that the state had acted in bad faith in withholding the\ninformation and disregarded the pretrial order to obtain an advantage. This is not correct.\nThe Texas Court of Criminal Appeals stated: “We adopt the trial court’s findings of fact and\nconclusions of law, except for the trial court’s findings and conclusions on grounds ten and\neleven [the claims at issue].” Ex parte Pruett, 207 S.W.3d at 767.\n\n                                              12\n\f  Case: 10-70024    Document: 00511707536       Page: 13   Date Filed: 12/27/2011\n\n\n\n                                  No. 10-70024\n\nwho were prisoners of the prosecution and thus had both a motivation to lie and\nthe lack of character to act on that motivation. He asserts that the State’s\nfailure to disclose his admissions to Hall and Ross, along with the trial court’s\nrefusal to order disclosure of the investigator’s interview notes for cross-\nexamination, affected his decision whether to testify, prevented defense counsel\nfrom conducting a pretrial investigation to counter the testimony, and deprived\nhim of the opportunity to discredit the inmate testimony and bolster his defense\nthat all of the inmate testimony against him was unreliable. He contends that\nthe nondisclosure violated his right to due process because the due process\nclause requires a fair trial and requires the prosecution to refrain from improper\nmethods calculated to produce wrongful conviction. He argues that the trial\ncourt’s refusal to order disclosure of the interview notes violated his right to due\nprocess under Jencks v. United States, 353 U.S. 657 (1957), and limited his right\nto cross-examine Hall and Ross, in violation of the Confrontation Clause. Pruett\ninsists that his claim has nothing to do with the Constitution not requiring\ndiscovery in a criminal case. Instead, he maintains that it concerns the State’s\nduty to follow lawful court orders in the prosecution of a death penalty case.\nPruett also contends that because the prosecution intentionally gave defense\ncounsel a false picture of the State’s evidence, his counsel were unable to prepare\nhis defense and thus were rendered ineffective.\n      The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals did not unreasonably deny relief on\nthese claims. As that court noted, the Supreme Court of the United States has\nheld that “There is no general constitutional right to discovery in a criminal\ncase.” Weatherford v. Bursey, 429 U.S. 545, 559 (1977). The Supreme Court\nstated in Bursey that “[i]t does not follow from the prohibition against concealing\nevidence favorable to the accused that the prosecution must reveal before trial\nthe names of all witnesses who will testify unfavorably.” Id. Accordingly, the\nTexas Court of Criminal Appeals did not unreasonably apply clearly established\n\n                                        13\n\f  Case: 10-70024    Document: 00511707536      Page: 14   Date Filed: 12/27/2011\n\n\n\n                                  No. 10-70024\n\nlaw when it rejected Pruett’s claim that the State denied him the right to a fair\ntrial by failing to identify Hall and Ross as rebuttal witnesses. Further, the\nTexas Court of Criminal Appeals did not unreasonably reject Pruett’s claims\nregarding the failure to turn over the investigator’s notes from the interviews of\nHall and Ross. Although the state habeas trial court stated in its conclusions of\nlaw that there were inconsistencies between the trial testimony of Hall and Ross\nand the interview notes, it made no factual findings revealing any such\ninconsistencies. Further, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals did not adopt\nthat conclusion. Pruett, likewise, has not identified any inconsistencies between\nRoss’s and Hall’s testimony and the interview notes and thus he has failed to\nadequately brief this claim. See Hughes v. Dretke, 412 F.3d 582, 597 (5th\nCir.2005) (“In his petition to this Court, Petitioner merely lists his ineffective\nassistance complaints in summary fashion, without discussing the legal and\nfactual basis for each complaint. In failing to brief his ineffective assistance of\ncounsel complaints adequately, Petitioner has waived those claims.”).\n      Jencks, which requires federal prosecutors to disclose written statements\nto the defense, does not apply to state criminal proceedings. Martin v. Maggio,\n711 F.2d 1273, 1283 (5th Cir. 1983). Pruett’s rights under the Confrontation\nClause were not violated, because the trial court did not restrict defense\ncounsel’s cross-examination of Hall and Ross. In the light of the evidence of his\nguilt, Pruett cannot show that not knowing the identities of Hall and Ross as\nrebuttal witnesses, and not having the investigator’s notes from their interviews\nof Hall and Ross, had a substantial and injurious effect or influence in\ndetermining the jury’s verdict. See Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U.S. 619, 637\n(1993).\n      Because the decision of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals is neither\ncontrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law,\nthe district court did not err by denying habeas relief on these claims.\n\n                                        14\n\f  Case: 10-70024    Document: 00511707536       Page: 15   Date Filed: 12/27/2011\n\n\n\n                                  No. 10-70024\n\n                                        B.\n      Having determined that Pruett is not entitled to habeas relief on the\nclaims for which the district court granted a COA, we now turn to consider his\nrequest for an expansion of the COA for his claim that the admission of a\nsummary of the facts underlying his prior murder conviction violated his rights\nunder the Confrontation Clause.\n       To obtain a COA, Pruett must make “a substantial showing of the denial\nof a constitutional right.” 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2). “When the district court denies\na habeas petition on procedural grounds without reaching the prisoner’s\nunderlying constitutional claim, a COA should issue when the prisoner shows,\nat least, that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states\na valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason\nwould find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural\nruling.” Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 484 (2000). “Where a district court\nhas rejected the constitutional claims on the merits, . . . [t]he petitioner must\ndemonstrate that reasonable jurists would find the district court’s assessment\nof the constitutional claims debatable or wrong,” id., “or that jurists could\nconclude the issues presented are adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed\nfurther.” Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U.S. 322, 327 (2003) (citation omitted). “[A]\nclaim can be debatable even though every jurist of reason might agree, after the\nCOA has been granted and the case has received full consideration, that\npetitioner will not prevail.” Id. at 338. In making the decision whether to grant\na COA, this court’s examination is limited to a “threshold inquiry,” which\nconsists of “an overview of the claims in the habeas petition and a general\nassessment of their merits.” Id. at 327, 336. The court cannot deny a COA\nbecause it believes the petitioner ultimately will not prevail on the merits of his\nclaims. Id. at 337. On the other hand, however, “issuance of a COA must not be\npro forma or a matter of course.” Id. “While the nature of a capital case is not\n\n                                        15\n\f  Case: 10-70024    Document: 00511707536      Page: 16    Date Filed: 12/27/2011\n\n\n\n                                  No. 10-70024\n\nof itself sufficient to warrant the issuance of a COA, in a death penalty case any\ndoubts as to whether a COA should issue must be resolved in the petitioner’s\nfavor.” Ramirez v. Dretke, 398 F.3d 691, 694 (5th Cir. 2005) (brackets, internal\nquotation marks, and citations omitted).\n      The evidence at issue is entitled “Case Summary.” It is one of 79 pages in\nState’s Exhibit 62, which contains Pruett’s prison classification records. The\nCase Summary states, in its entirety:\n            MURDER WITH A DEADLY WEAPON: The official\n            version states that on 8-9-95 in Houston, Harris\n            County, Texas, the subject, his brother and father\n            (Howard PRUETT Sr., LIFE sentence and Howard\n            PRUETT Jr., 40 years TDCJ-ID) assaulted an adult\n            white male neighbor. The victim and the subject\n            originally got involved in an argument over the subject\n            selling him some stolen guns and the subject dating the\n            victim’s daughter. The victim ordered the subject to\n            stay away from his residence and he and the subject\n            became involved in an argument. The subject tried to\n            get other friends of his to join in killing the victim that\n            same night, without success. When the subject got\n            home, he got his father and brother to join him in\n            jumping on the victim, beating him and kicking him.\n            The subject’s father stabbed the victim 6-7 times while\n            the victim was on the ground. The victim managed to\n            get up and run away from his assailants but they\n            followed him and continued attacking him. The victim\n            died as a result of his stab wounds. The subject and\n            codefendants fled Harris County and went to Orange,\n            Texas, where they were arrested 2 weeks later. At the\n            time of the arrest, the subject fled through a window\n            but was arrested a short distance away. The subject\n            was 16 years old when this offense occurred and he was\n            certified to stand trial as an adult. The subject wrote\n            letters from the jail where he bragged about the\n            MURDER to his friends. He also threatened to kill a\n            witness from the jail. After the jury sentenced the\n            subject, the subject “fainted” and when he “awoke”, he\n            tore off his shift and stated “you better watch out for\n\n                                        16\n\f  Case: 10-70024    Document: 00511707536     Page: 17    Date Filed: 12/27/2011\n\n\n\n                                  No. 10-70024\n\n             me. I’m going to kill every mother fucker I see.” The\n             subject had to be restrained and removed from the\n             court room by deputies. There was no bond for this\n             offense.\n\n             RATIONALE OF PRESENT OFFENSE “MY DAD\n             STABBED HIM.”\n      On direct appeal, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals held that the only\nportion of Pruett’s claim regarding the Case Summary that was preserved for\nreview was his claim that the exhibit was inadmissible because the records\ncontained in it “were compiled for the purpose of litigation.” 2004 WL 3093232,\nat *5. The court rejected that claim on the merits, holding that the records were\nnot actually created in anticipation of litigation, but merely compiled for use at\ntrial. Id.\n      Pruett raised the claim again in his state habeas application. The state\nhabeas trial court found that the Case Summary was created on October 18,\n1996, more than three years prior to Nagle’s murder. The court rejected Pruett’s\nclaim for three reasons.     First, the court concluded that the claim was\nprocedurally barred under state law because, although Pruett’s counsel objected\nto the packet of materials in which the Case Summary was included, they did\nnot object to the Case Summary with sufficient specificity to make the trial court\naware of their arguments regarding its inadmissibility. Next, the state habeas\ntrial court concluded that the Case Summary was admissible as a business\nrecord because it existed prior to trial, was not prepared for the purpose of\nlitigation, and was introduced after appropriate testimony from the custodian\nof records. Finally, the state habeas court concluded that the same evidence was\nadmitted from other sources, without objection, both before and after the guilty\nverdict. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals adopted these findings and\nconclusions. Ex parte Pruett, 207 S.W.3d at 767.\n\n\n\n                                       17\n\f  Case: 10-70024   Document: 00511707536      Page: 18    Date Filed: 12/27/2011\n\n\n\n                                 No. 10-70024\n\n     The district court held that, assuming that the claim is not procedurally\ndefaulted and that admission of the Case Summary was erroneous, any error in\nwas harmless. The district court stated:\n            [T]he jury knew from other evidence that Petitioner was\n     serving a 99 year sentence for the murder of Ray Yarborough at the\n     time the murder of Nagle occurred . . . . The jury had heard\n     testimony as to the details of the previous murder, including\n     evidence that Petitioner punched, kicked, and held down\n     Yarborough during the assault and that he threatened to kill\n     everyone in the courtroom upon being convicted . . . . They had also\n     heard evidence that he had committed disciplinary infractions while\n     in prison, which included fighting, trying to manufacture a weapon,\n     and making repeated threats of physical violence against\n     guards . . . . Of course, it was undisputed that Nagle, the victim in\n     this capital murder case, was a correctional officer in the facility in\n     which he was incarcerated.\n\n           Turning to the case and offense summaries, we find the\n     following facts reported concerning the Yarborough murder:\n     Petitioner solicited the murder, he tried to escape when arrested, he\n     bragged about the murder, he tried to kill witnesses from jail, and\n     he was not remorseful . . . . All of these details were certainly\n     prejudicial. However, when considered in conjunction with the\n     evidence the jury already had in its possession, it is difficult to\n     conclude that this evidence had a “substantial and injurious effect”\n     on Petitioner’s sentence.        The jury was confronted with\n     overwhelming evidence that Petitioner would pose a continuing\n     threat to society, the most important being that they had just\n     convicted him of murdering an officer in a correctional institution.\n     It strains credulity to the breaking point to suggest that a\n     reasonable jury confronted with all of the evidence except the\n     summary reports would conclude that Petitioner did not pose a\n     continuing threat to society. Accordingly, the error, if any, in\n     admitting the case and offense summaries did not have a\n     “substantial and injurious effect” on the sentence and was harmless.\nPruett v. Thaler, No. C-06-CA-465-H, at 11-12.\n     Pruett argues that he made a proper objection and that the admission of\nthe Case Summary violated his rights under the Confrontation Clause because\n\n\n                                       18\n\f  Case: 10-70024    Document: 00511707536      Page: 19   Date Filed: 12/27/2011\n\n\n\n                                  No. 10-70024\n\nthe Case Summary was the product of police investigation and interrogation and\nwas therefore testimonial. He contends that the error was not harmless because\nthe case summary was the only evidence of these damning facts: (1) Pruett tried\nto recruit his friends to commit the 1995 murder; (2) Pruett solicited his brother\nand father to commit the murder; (3) Pruett tried to escape when he was\narrested; (4) Pruett bragged about the murder; (5) Pruett tried to kill witnesses\nfrom jail; and (6) Pruett was not remorseful. He contends that it also shows\npremeditation, adding weight to the State’s proposition that Nagle’s murder was\nalso planned; shows future dangerousness in that he tried to escape and tried to\nhave witnesses killed from jail; and negates mitigating evidence bearing on\nPruett’s moral and personal culpability. He points out that in closing argument,\nthe prosecutor referred to the Case Summary as contradicting Pruett’s testimony\nand showing that he was a future danger.\n      Pruett concedes that the district court was probably correct in concluding\nthat future dangerousness was a given because Pruett was in prison, and the\njury had found that he killed his prison guard. However, he points out that the\njury also had to consider mitigating circumstances. He maintains that the Case\nSummary added significant weight to the State’s case for death and made his\nsentence unreliable.\n      In Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36 (2004), which was decided several\nmonths before the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals handed down its decision on\nPruett’s direct appeal, the Supreme Court held that the Confrontation Clause\nforbids admission of out-of-court testimonial statements against a criminal\ndefendant unless the declarant is unavailable and the defendant has had a prior\nopportunity to cross-examine the declarant. Id. at 68. The Court declined in\nCrawford to “spell out a comprehensive definition of ‘testimonial,’” but stated\nthat “it applies at a minimum to prior testimony at a preliminary hearing, before\na grand jury, or at a former trial; and to police interrogations.” Id. In Melendez-\n\n                                        19\n\f  Case: 10-70024    Document: 00511707536       Page: 20   Date Filed: 12/27/2011\n\n\n\n                                  No. 10-70024\n\nDiaz v. Massachusetts, 129 S. Ct. 2527 (2009), the Court stated that “[b]usiness\nand public records are generally admissible absent confrontation not because\nthey qualify under an exception to the hearsay rules, but because–having been\ncreated for the administration of an entity’s affairs and not for the purpose of\nestablishing or proving some fact at trial–they are not testimonial.” Id. at 2539-\n40.\n      The State argues that Crawford did not disturb the Supreme Court’s\nearlier holding, in Williams v. Oklahoma, 358 U.S. 576, 584 (1959), that the\nConfrontation Clause generally does not apply to sentencing and does not\nprevent the introduction of hearsay at a sentencing hearing. See United States\nv. Beydoun, 469 F.3d 102, 108 (5th Cir. 2006) (stating that “there is no Crawford\nviolation when hearsay testimony is used at sentencing, rather than at trial”).\nThe State also points out that the Case Summary was not prepared for purposes\nof litigation. It was prepared in October 1996, for prison classification purposes,\nafter Pruett had been sentenced to prison for Yarborough’s murder, and more\nthan three years before he murdered Nagle.\n      We need not decide whether the Case Summary is testimonial, or whether\nCrawford applies to evidence presented at a sentencing hearing in a death\npenalty case, because we are convinced that reasonable jurists would not find\ndebatable the district court’s decision that any error in admitting the Case\nSummary was harmless.\n      As the district court correctly noted, the Case Summary is substantially\ncumulative of other evidence of Pruett’s role in the Yarborough murder. In\nresponse to questioning by his own counsel, Pruett testified at the guilt-\ninnocence phase that he previously had been convicted of murder. At the\npunishment phase, Pruett admitted that he started the confrontation with\nYarborough, although he denied making threats in the courtroom after he was\nsentenced for Yarborough’s murder.           During the State’s rebuttal at the\n\n                                        20\n\f  Case: 10-70024    Document: 00511707536     Page: 21   Date Filed: 12/27/2011\n\n\n\n                                 No. 10-70024\n\npunishment phase, Detective Allen Beall of the Harris County Sheriff’s\nDepartment testified, without objection, that his investigation showed Pruett\npunched, kicked, and held Yarborough down during the assault; that\nYarborough did not have any guns in his possession; and that, at sentencing,\nPruett told everyone in the courtroom to stay away from him or he would kill all\nof them.\n      In the light of this evidence, reasonable jurists would not find debatable\nthe district court’s decision that any error in the admission of the Case Summary\ndid not have a substantial and injurious effect or influence on the jury’s\ndetermination of Pruett’s sentence and was, therefore, harmless. See Brecht, 507\nU.S. at 637.

The district court granted a certificate of appealability (“COA”)\nauthorizing Pruett to appeal the denial of habeas relief on two related claims.\nPruett requests an expansion of the COA to include an additional claim. For the\n\n\n        *\n         Pursuant to 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not\nbe published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH CIR.\nR. 47.5.4.\n\f   Case: 10-70024   Document: 00511707536     Page: 2   Date Filed: 12/27/2011\n\n\n\n                                 No. 10-70024\n\nreasons that follow, we AFFIRM the district court’s denial of habeas relief and\nDENY Pruett’s request to expand the COA.\n                                       I.\n      Pruett was sentenced to 99 years in prison for his role in the 1995 murder\nof Ray Yarborough. His father and brother were also convicted for their roles in\nthe Yarborough murder.\n      On December 17, 1999, while in prison, Pruett missed getting a hot lunch\nand was given a sack lunch. He attempted to take his lunch into the recreation\narea, which was in violation of prison rules. Officer Nagle told Pruett that he\nneeded to eat his lunch before going to the recreation area, and wrote a\ndisciplinary charge against Pruett. Later that afternoon, when Nagle was in his\noffice adjoining a multi-purpose room, Pruett stabbed Nagle eight times with a\n“shank” made of a metal rod sharpened to a point at one end, and wrapped in\ntape at the other end. According to the autopsy report, Nagle died from a heart\nattack that he suffered as a result of the trauma caused by the stab wounds.\nThe murder weapon and a torn disciplinary report against Pruett, charging him\nwith attempting to take food into an unauthorized area, were found at the scene\nof the attack.\n      John Lee Davis of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice Office of\nInspector General testified that after Pruett was arrested, Pruett stated, “Go\nahead and run that disciplinary case on me now. Oop[s], I want to call my first\nwitness, Officer Nagle. Oops, he’s dead.” Davis said that Pruett then began\nlaughing.\n      Much of the remaining evidence against Pruett consisted of testimony\nfrom inmates. Inmates Allen Thompson and Johnny Barnett testified that they\nwere in the multi-purpose room and saw and heard Pruett attacking Nagle.\nInmate Anthony Casey testified that he heard Pruett talking about a weapon\nwith another inmate before the attack. Casey, through a recreation yard\n\n                                       2\n\f   Case: 10-70024    Document: 00511707536      Page: 3   Date Filed: 12/27/2011\n\n\n\n                                  No. 10-70024\n\nwindow, later saw Pruett near Nagle’s desk, and then saw Pruett remove his\nclothing in a hallway and push it through a gas port into the recreation yard.\nInmates James Dale Keller, Robert Michael Lewis, and Jimmy Mullican testified\nthat they witnessed Pruett’s attack on Nagle from the craft shop across from the\nmulti-purpose room. Inmate Harold Mitchell testified that he was in the multi-\npurpose room before the attack. He said that Pruett came into the room and\nsuggested that he leave because Pruett was going to “do something.” When\nMitchell questioned Pruett, Pruett said that he was going to kill Nagle.\nAccording to Mitchell, Pruett said that he was tired of life in prison and wasn’t\ngoing to kill himself, but didn’t have a problem making the State do it for him.\n      At the guilt-innocence phase of the trial, Pruett testified that he was in\nprison because “my father killed my neighbor.” He said that he was convicted\nof murder when he was fifteen years old and that he went to the penitentiary\nwhen he was sixteen years old. He explained that on December 17, 1999, he was\nupset about missing a hot lunch and that he cursed at Nagle when Nagle refused\nto allow him to take his sack lunch into the recreation yard. He said that after\nhe went outside, he saw, through the window, that Nagle was writing a\ndisciplinary report against him. He already had another disciplinary case\npending for gambling, which he said was the way he made money for personal\nitems inasmuch as he did not receive any outside financial support. He said that\nhe had cut his hand while lifting weights in the recreation yard, and had used\nhis shirt to stop the bleeding. He said that he later decided to talk to Nagle\nabout the disciplinary case and went to see Nagle, who tore up the report.\n      Pruett testified that he left Nagle, got some clean clothes, and got in line\nfor the “chow hall.” The cut on his thumb reopened and he got more blood on his\nclothes. Then prison officers made everyone go into the gym, where he heard\nthat Nagle “got whooped.” Pruett said that he told the officers, when he was\narrested, that “I ain’t ever killed nobody in my life.”\n\n                                         3\n\f   Case: 10-70024   Document: 00511707536      Page: 4   Date Filed: 12/27/2011\n\n\n\n                                  No. 10-70024\n\n      On cross-examination, Pruett denied that he had told inmate Michael Hall\nthat he had killed Nagle. He also denied telling corrections officer Michael\nBaumann that he had killed before and would do it again. He admitted that he\nhad sent inmate Michael Ross a letter, through defense counsel’s investigator,\njust before trial, asking Ross to testify that he (Pruett) had cut his hand on the\nweights.\n      In rebuttal, the prosecutor called Michael Hall and Michael Ross. Each\nof them testified that Pruett admitted to them that he had killed Nagle. The\nprosecutor also called Officer Michael Baumann, who testified that he wrote a\ndisciplinary report on Pruett after Pruett threatened to kill him on August 25,\n2001. Defense counsel called Pruett to the stand again to rebut the testimony\nof Hall, Ross, and Baumann.\n      The jury found Pruett guilty of capital murder.\n      At the punishment phase of the trial, the prosecution called three\ncorrections officers who testified about the disciplinary charges they had\nreported for Pruett’s misconduct. Jane Yarborough, the wife of Pruett’s first\nmurder victim, testified that her husband had been stabbed five to seven times.\nThe chief of classification at the Connally Unit testified as the custodian of\nrecords for Pruett’s prison records which were offered into evidence by the\nprosecution.\n      Pruett’s father testified at the punishment phase that he was incarcerated\nwhen Pruett was born. He said that he met Pruett for the first time when Pruett\nwas seven years old. He stated that he was in prison for stabbing his neighbor,\nRay Yarborough, five or six times. He explained that when the murder occurred,\nboth of his sons were with him, but they did not know he was going to stab\nYarborough. He testified that he was tried with his sons, and that Pruett was\nonly fifteen years old at the time. He stated that he was sentenced to life in\n\n\n\n                                        4\n\f   Case: 10-70024    Document: 00511707536      Page: 5   Date Filed: 12/27/2011\n\n\n\n                                  No. 10-70024\n\nprison for Yarborough’s murder, Pruett’s brother, who was 25 years old at the\ntime, was sentenced to 40 years, and Pruett was sentenced to 99 years.\n      Pruett’s brother testified that his family had been poor and that they were\nknown as gypsies. He said that his father was in and out of the penitentiary and\nthat his mother cleaned houses. He said that he kicked Yarborough, but that\nPruett didn’t do anything to Yarborough. He also said that Pruett did not\nthreaten anyone when he was sentenced for Yarborough’s murder.\n      Pruett testified again at the punishment phase. He said that his family\nwas poor and moved around a lot. According to Pruett, his mother was “not all\nthe way there mentally,” she did not finish high school, and she had physical\nhandicaps. He testified that he had been “getting high” with his parents since\nhe was seven or eight years old, and had used marijuana and cocaine, but not\nheroin or crack. He testified that he finished the eighth grade in school, but that\nwhile he was in prison he had obtained his GED and had completed eighteen\nhours of college credit. He admitted that he was the cause of Yarborough’s\nmurder. He explained that they had argued because he had stolen some guns,\nYarborough had taken some of them, and he wanted money for the guns to buy\nfood. He said that his brother and father came to help him, they wrestled with\nYarborough, and his father stabbed Yarborough. He also testified to his version\nof the incidents that were the subject of the disciplinary charges against him.\n      Robert Chance, an assistant warden at the Polunsky Unit, testified for the\ndefense about the prison classification system and the various security levels.\nLaura Menn, another witness for the defense, testified that she was a teacher\nfor the prison school district. She stated that she had taught Pruett while he\nwas in prison and that he had been a very good student, did his work, was very\nbright, and was always very respectful to her. Pruett’s cousin, Christine Hinson,\ntestified that Pruett’s childhood was dysfunctional, that he was left to roam the\n\n\n\n                                        5\n\f   Case: 10-70024    Document: 00511707536      Page: 6   Date Filed: 12/27/2011\n\n\n\n                                  No. 10-70024\n\nstreets to look for food, and that her mother fed him because his mother often\nwas away from home for days at a time.\n      Dr. Gilda Kessner, a clinical psychologist, testified for the defense as\nfollows. Based on her review of records and interviews, Pruett was born into a\nchaotic family environment, received no nurturing, and grew up in an\natmosphere of poverty, crime, and substance abuse. When Pruett was placed in\nan adult criminal setting as an adolescent he was denied the chance to take\nadvantage of alternatives to adult prison that were available and thus did not\nhave any opportunity to develop his positive qualities.\n      With respect to Pruett’s risk for future dangerousness, Kessner testified\nthat there were no studies or statistical models for inmates who killed while in\nprison, because the number of such inmates was too small to be statistically\nreliable. She also testified that the risk of violence decreases as an inmate ages.\nOn cross-examination, she testified that Pruett’s behavior that was the subject\nof the disciplinary charges against him was commonplace behavior for someone\nwho is facing a long sentence. When the prosecutor asked her if Pruett would\nbe a danger to people in the future, she testified that “there is not a zero\nprobability for anybody,” but that any risk of future danger that he might\npresent could be managed within the prison system.\n      In rebuttal, the State called Detective Allen Beall of the Harris County\nSheriff’s Department, who had investigated the 1995 Yarborough murder.\nDetective Beall testified that his investigation showed that Pruett punched,\nkicked, and held Yarborough down during the assault that killed him. He also\ntestified that no guns were found at Yarborough’s residence or in his truck. He\ntestified that he was in the courtroom when Pruett was sentenced for the\nYarborough murder and that he heard Pruett say that everyone was to stay\naway from him or he would kill “all of y’all,” referring to everyone in court.\n\n\n\n                                        6\n\f   Case: 10-70024    Document: 00511707536      Page: 7   Date Filed: 12/27/2011\n\n\n\n                                  No. 10-70024\n\n      Warden Thomas Prasifka, of the McConnell Unit, testified in rebuttal for\nthe State that it would not be unusual for an inmate who had been convicted of\ncapital murder to get out of administrative segregation (where he is kept in his\ncell for twenty-three hours a day and isolated at all times).\n      The jury answered the special punishment issue on future dangerousness\naffirmatively, and the special punishment issue on mitigation negatively. Pruett\nwas sentenced to death. His conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct\nappeal. Pruett v.

The state habeas trial\ncourt conducted an evidentiary hearing and issued findings of fact and\nconclusions of law recommending that Pruett’s conviction be reversed because\nthe prosecution had violated a pretrial discovery order, but recommending that\nrelief be denied on all of Pruett’s other claims.

The\ndistrict court granted Pruett’s application for a COA, authorizing him to appeal\nthe denial of relief as to two related claims.

Because those claims are related,\nwe will discuss them together. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals denied\nrelief on these claims on the ground that there is no federal constitutional right\nto discovery in a criminal case. Ex parte Pruett, 207 S.W.3d at 767.

The trial court granted\nhis request to require the State to disclose certain evidence, including “the\nsubstance of any oral statements made by the accused . . . and a list of witnesses\nto the making and acknowledgment of such statement.” The trial court denied\nhis request for “the names and addresses of witnesses the State intends to call\nin rebuttal, together with information required to be disclosed in connection with\nother witnesses and a specific statement as to the substance of the testimony\nsuch witnesses will give at the trial of the cause.”\n      As we have already noted, Pruett testified at the guilt-innocence phase\nand denied that he killed Nagle. On cross-examination, the prosecutor asked\nPruett if he had told Michael Hall that he had killed Nagle, and that he just\ncouldn’t stop himself. Pruett denied making such statements. In the middle of\nhis cross-examination, at a bench conference outside the presence of the jury, the\nprosecutor stated that the State was going to call Michael Ross to rebut Pruett’s\ndenial that he murdered Nagle, and to relate how Pruett had asked Ross to\ntestify falsely about some of the facts of the murder. Defense counsel did not\nobject. Later, after the remaining defense witnesses had testified, the prosecutor\nstated to the court and defense counsel that he was going to call four rebuttal\nwitnesses, including Michael Hall and Michael Ross.\n\n\n\n                                        9\n\f  Case: 10-70024    Document: 00511707536       Page: 10   Date Filed: 12/27/2011\n\n\n\n                                  No. 10-70024\n\n      The prosecutor called Michael Hall as the State’s first rebuttal witness,\nwith no objection from the defense. Hall testified that Pruett had admitted to\nhim that he had stabbed Nagle. Prior to cross-examining Hall, defense counsel\nasked if Hall had made a written statement. The prosecutor responded that he\nhad not, and that all the prosecution had was work product consisting of notes\ntaken during an interview.       The prosecutor had used those notes while\nconducting direct examination. Defense counsel cross-examined Hall, asking\nhim questions about who he had discussed his testimony with, what he was\nconvicted of, and whether he had been promised a letter recommending parole\nin exchange for his testimony.\n      Ross was also called to testify without objection. Ross initially had been\non Pruett’s witness list. Ross testified that Pruett had admitted to him that he\nhad stabbed Nagle. Ross also testified that he had been shown a letter from\nPruett by the defense investigator, Jim Dickson. In that letter, Pruett had asked\nRoss if he “remembered” that Pruett had cut his hand while lifting weights.\nRoss stated that he told Dickson that there was nothing he could do for Pruett.\nOn cross-examination, Ross, who was serving a 99-year sentence, testified that\nhe would receive a “safe passage” in return for his testimony. He explained that\n“safe passage” meant that his safety would be guaranteed for the remainder of\nhis sentence. Defense counsel did not ask for any notes or statements prior to\nor during his cross-examination of Ross.\n      After both Hall and Ross had testified, defense counsel complained,\noutside the presence of the jury, that the prosecution had failed to disclose to the\ndefense that Pruett had admitted to Hall and Ross that he had killed Nagle. The\nprosecutor argued that the discovery order did not apply to rebuttal witnesses.\n      Three days later, Pruett filed a motion for a mistrial or to strike the\nrebuttal testimony of Hall and Ross. Defense counsel argued that the discovery\norder required the State to disclose the names of the witnesses as well as the\n\n                                        10\n\f  Case: 10-70024    Document: 00511707536      Page: 11   Date Filed: 12/27/2011\n\n\n\n                                  No. 10-70024\n\nstatements that Pruett had made to them. The State argued that because the\nevidence came during rebuttal, it was not required to be disclosed under the\nterms of the pretrial order. The trial court denied the defense motion for a\nmistrial or to strike the rebuttal testimony of Hall and Ross.\n      The state habeas trial court judge (who was not the same judge who had\nentered the pretrial discovery order and conducted the trial) found that the State\nintentionally failed to disclose Pruett’s admissions to Hall and Ross, in violation\nof the discovery order, and recommended that Pruett’s conviction be reversed.\nThe judge reasoned that, although the discovery order had denied Pruett’s\nrequest for the identities and substance of the testimony of rebuttal witnesses,\nother provisions of the discovery order required disclosure. He concluded that\nthe State’s investigator’s notes taken during the interviews of Hall and Ross\nconstituted witness statements under the Texas Rules of Evidence, that the\nnotes contained unspecified inconsistencies with trial testimony, and that the\ndefense was entitled to use those notes in cross-examination.          The judge\nconcluded that the State had acted in bad faith in deliberately disregarding the\npretrial discovery order to obtain an advantage. He concluded further that the\ntrial judge had abused his discretion in allowing the testimony about Pruett’s\ninculpatory statements and in denying the defense access to the investigator’s\ninterview notes. He found that the defense was impaired because defense\nattorneys have a right to depend on prosecutors’ complying with pretrial\ndiscovery orders, and the defense was not in a position to anticipate the\ntestimony.\n      In Wooten v. Thaler, our court observed that “there is a line of authority\nthat leaves open the possibility that a defendant who is deliberately misled as to\nthe full weight and import of the state’s evidence might have a cognizable due\nprocess claim.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"71463\"><a href=\"/opinion/71463/wooten-v-thaler/\"><span class=\"volume\">598</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">215</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 220 (5th Cir. 2010) (citing Gray v.

The\nCase Summary states, in its entirety:\n            MURDER WITH A DEADLY WEAPON: The official\n            version states that on 8-9-95 in Houston, Harris\n            County, Texas, the subject, his brother and father\n            (Howard PRUETT Sr., LIFE sentence and Howard\n            PRUETT Jr., 40 years TDCJ-ID) assaulted an adult\n            white male neighbor. The victim and the subject\n            originally got involved in an argument over the subject\n            selling him some stolen guns and the subject dating the\n            victim’s daughter. The victim ordered the subject to\n            stay away from his residence and he and the subject\n            became involved in an argument. The subject tried to\n            get other friends of his to join in killing the victim that\n            same night, without success. When the subject got\n            home, he got his father and brother to join him in\n            jumping on the victim, beating him and kicking him.\n            The subject’s father stabbed the victim 6-7 times while\n            the victim was on the ground. The victim managed to\n            get up and run away from his assailants but they\n            followed him and continued attacking him. The victim\n            died as a result of his stab wounds. The subject and\n            codefendants fled Harris County and went to Orange,\n            Texas, where they were arrested 2 weeks later. At the\n            time of the arrest, the subject fled through a window\n            but was arrested a short distance away. The subject\n            was 16 years old when this offense occurred and he was\n            certified to stand trial as an adult. The subject wrote\n            letters from the jail where he bragged about the\n            MURDER to his friends. He also threatened to kill a\n            witness from the jail. After the jury sentenced the\n            subject, the subject “fainted” and when he “awoke”, he\n            tore off his shift and stated “you better watch out for\n\n                                        16\n\f  Case: 10-70024    Document: 00511707536     Page: 17    Date Filed: 12/27/2011\n\n\n\n                                  No. 10-70024\n\n             me.

The court rejected that claim on the merits, holding that the records were\nnot actually created in anticipation of litigation, but merely compiled for use at\ntrial. Id.\n      Pruett raised the claim again in his state habeas application. The state\nhabeas trial court found that the Case Summary was created on October 18,\n1996, more than three years prior to Nagle’s murder. The court rejected Pruett’s\nclaim for three reasons.     First, the court concluded that the claim was\nprocedurally barred under state law because, although Pruett’s counsel objected\nto the packet of materials in which the Case Summary was included, they did\nnot object to the Case Summary with sufficient specificity to make the trial court\naware of their arguments regarding its inadmissibility. Next, the state habeas\ntrial court concluded that the Case Summary was admissible as a business\nrecord because it existed prior to trial, was not prepared for the purpose of\nlitigation, and was introduced after appropriate testimony from the custodian\nof records. Finally, the state habeas court concluded that the same evidence was\nadmitted from other sources, without objection, both before and after the guilty\nverdict. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals adopted these findings and\nconclusions. Ex parte Pruett, 207 S.W.3d at 767.\n\n\n\n                                       17\n\f  Case: 10-70024   Document: 00511707536      Page: 18    Date Filed: 12/27/2011\n\n\n\n                                 No. 10-70024\n\n     The district court held that, assuming that the claim is not procedurally\ndefaulted and that admission of the Case Summary was erroneous, any error in\nwas harmless. The district court stated:\n            [T]he jury knew from other evidence that Petitioner was\n     serving a 99 year sentence for the murder of Ray Yarborough at the\n     time the murder of Nagle occurred . . . . The jury had heard\n     testimony as to the details of the previous murder, including\n     evidence that Petitioner punched, kicked, and held down\n     Yarborough during the assault and that he threatened to kill\n     everyone in the courtroom upon being convicted . . . . They had also\n     heard evidence that he had committed disciplinary infractions while\n     in prison, which included fighting, trying to manufacture a weapon,\n     and making repeated threats of physical violence against\n     guards . . . . Of course, it was undisputed that Nagle, the victim in\n     this capital murder case, was a correctional officer in the facility in\n     which he was incarcerated.\n\n           Turning to the case and offense summaries, we find the\n     following facts reported concerning the Yarborough murder:\n     Petitioner solicited the murder, he tried to escape when arrested, he\n     bragged about the murder, he tried to kill witnesses from jail, and\n     he was not remorseful . . . . All of these details were certainly\n     prejudicial. However, when considered in conjunction with the\n     evidence the jury already had in its possession, it is difficult to\n     conclude that this evidence had a “substantial and injurious effect”\n     on Petitioner’s sentence.        The jury was confronted with\n     overwhelming evidence that Petitioner would pose a continuing\n     threat to society, the most important being that they had just\n     convicted him of murdering an officer in a correctional institution.\n     It strains credulity to the breaking point to suggest that a\n     reasonable jury confronted with all of the evidence except the\n     summary reports would conclude that Petitioner did not pose a\n     continuing threat to society. Accordingly, the error, if any, in\n     admitting the case and offense summaries did not have a\n     “substantial and injurious effect” on the sentence and was harmless.\nPruett v. Thaler, No. C-06-CA-465-H, at 11-12.\n     Pruett argues that he made a proper objection and that the admission of\nthe Case Summary violated his rights under the Confrontation Clause because\n\n\n                                       18\n\f  Case: 10-70024    Document: 00511707536      Page: 19   Date Filed: 12/27/2011\n\n\n\n                                  No. 10-70024\n\nthe Case Summary was the product of police investigation and interrogation and\nwas therefore testimonial. He contends that the error was not harmless because\nthe case summary was the only evidence of these damning facts: (1) Pruett tried\nto recruit his friends to commit the 1995 murder; (2) Pruett solicited his brother\nand father to commit the murder; (3) Pruett tried to escape when he was\narrested; (4) Pruett bragged about the murder; (5) Pruett tried to kill witnesses\nfrom jail; and (6) Pruett was not remorseful. He contends that it also shows\npremeditation, adding weight to the State’s proposition that Nagle’s murder was\nalso planned; shows future dangerousness in that he tried to escape and tried to\nhave witnesses killed from jail; and negates mitigating evidence bearing on\nPruett’s moral and personal culpability. He points out that in closing argument,\nthe prosecutor referred to the Case Summary as contradicting Pruett’s testimony\nand showing that he was a future danger.\n      Pruett concedes that the district court was probably correct in concluding\nthat future dangerousness was a given because Pruett was in prison, and the\njury had found that he killed his prison guard. However, he points out that the\njury also had to consider mitigating circumstances. He maintains that the Case\nSummary added significant weight to the State’s case for death and made his\nsentence unreliable.\n      In Crawford v.

Id. at 68. The Court declined in\nCrawford to “spell out a comprehensive definition of ‘testimonial,’” but stated\nthat “it applies at a minimum to prior testimony at a preliminary hearing, before\na grand jury, or at a former trial; and to police interrogations.” Id.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2527</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2009), the Court stated that “[b]usiness\nand public records are generally admissible absent confrontation not because\nthey qualify under an exception to the hearsay rules, but because–having been\ncreated for the administration of an entity’s affairs and not for the purpose of\nestablishing or proving some fact at trial–they are not testimonial.” Id. at 2539-\n40.\n      The State argues that Crawford did not disturb the Supreme Court’s\nearlier holding, in Williams v. Oklahoma, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105834\"><a href=\"/opinion/105834/williams-v-oklahoma/\"><span class=\"volume\">358</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">576</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 584 (1959), that the\nConfrontation Clause generally does not apply to sentencing and does not\nprevent the introduction of hearsay at a sentencing hearing. See United States\nv. Beydoun, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"46225\"><a href=\"/opinion/46225/united-states-v-beydoun/\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">102</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 108 (5th Cir. 2006) (stating that “there is no Crawford\nviolation when hearsay testimony is used at sentencing, rather than at trial”).\nThe State also points out that the Case Summary was not prepared for purposes\nof litigation. It was prepared in October 1996, for prison classification purposes,\nafter Pruett had been sentenced to prison for Yarborough’s murder, and more\nthan three years before he murdered Nagle.\n      We need not decide whether the Case Summary is testimonial, or whether\nCrawford applies to evidence presented at a sentencing hearing in a death\npenalty case, because we are convinced that reasonable jurists would not find\ndebatable the district court’s decision that any error in admitting the Case\nSummary was harmless.\n      As the district court correctly noted, the Case Summary is substantially\ncumulative of other evidence of Pruett’s role in the Yarborough murder. In\nresponse to questioning by his own counsel, Pruett testified at the guilt-\ninnocence phase that he previously had been convicted of murder. At the\npunishment phase, Pruett admitted that he started the confrontation with\nYarborough, although he denied making threats in the courtroom after he was\nsentenced for Yarborough’s murder.           During the State’s rebuttal at the\n\n                                        20\n\f  Case: 10-70024    Document: 00511707536     Page: 21   Date Filed: 12/27/2011\n\n\n\n                                 No. 10-70024\n\npunishment phase, Detective Allen Beall of the Harris County Sheriff’s\nDepartment testified, without objection, that his investigation showed Pruett\npunched, kicked, and held Yarborough down during the assault; that\nYarborough did not have any guns in his possession; and that, at sentencing,\nPruett told everyone in the courtroom to stay away from him or he would kill all\nof them.\n      In the light of this evidence, reasonable jurists would not find debatable\nthe district court’s decision that any error in the admission of the Case Summary\ndid not have a substantial and injurious effect or influence on the jury’s\ndetermination of Pruett’s sentence and was, therefore, harmless. See Brecht, 507\nU.S. at 637. Accordingly, we DENY Pruett’s request for expansion of the COA.\n                                      III.\n      For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED\nand Pruett’s request for expansion of the COA is DENIED.\n\n\n\n\n                                       21\n\f</pre>",
