(West 2002)), filed by Beeler Shad &\n\nDiamond as a relator on behalf of the State of Illinois. The underlying claim relates to\n\ndefendants’ sale of goods over the internet and/or through catalogs into Illinois and defendants'\n\nalleged failure to collect and remit use tax relating to these sales.1 The trial court certified the\n\nfollowing questions for interlocutory review:\n\n\n\n        Question 1\n\n        \"As a matter of law, if a remote retailer does not collect and remit use tax on sales to\n\nIllinois customers, can it make a 'knowingly' false record or statement, as required to create\n\nliability under the Illinois Whistleblower Reward and Protection Act, 740 ILCS 175/1?\"\n\n        Question 2\n\n        \"(a) As a matter of law, does the Whistleblower Act require the existence of an actual\n\nrecord or statement to support a claim or can the failure to keep a record be actionable?\n\n        (b) As a matter of law, can documents memorializing a purchase (i.e. invoices or packing\n\nreceipts) that show in the line item for tax '$0.0' or in some other way that tax is not being\n\ncollected be considered 'false' under the Whistleblower Act where the retailer that created those\n\ndocuments does not collect tax?\n\n\n\n        1\n            This court granted a motion to withdraw from the appeal filed by Pfaltzgraff Co.,\n\nMaidenform, Inc., Toy's R Us and PETsMART.\n                                                   3\n\f1-05-1059\n\n       (c) Under the Whistleblower Act, as a matter of law, is it necessary that a false statement\n\nbe submitted to or actually relied upon by the State?\"\n\n       Question 3\n\n       \"Does the application of the general provisions of the Whistleblower Reward and\n\nProtection Act, 740 ILCS 175/1, to enforce the sales and use tax laws improperly deprive\n\ntaxpayers of the specific rights and privileges afforded them under the Protest Monies Act (30\n\nILCS 230/1), the Taxpayer's Bill of Rights, 20 ILCS 2502/1, and/or the statutory administrative\n\nprocedures offered by the Illinois Department of Revenue, 35 ILCS 105/1; 35 ILCS 120/1, such\n\nthat the Whistleblower Reward and Protection Act cannot be used to enforce the collection of\n\ntaxes due the State?\"\n\n       Question 4\n\n       \"Is the Illinois Department of Revenue the sole entity authorized by the Illinois General\n\nAssembly to assess and collect use tax?\"\n\n       Question 5\n\n       \"Does the Illinois Whistleblower Reward and Protection Act, 740 ILCS 175/1, apply to\n\nalleged tax liabilities under the Use Tax Act?\"\n\n       Question 6\n\n       \"(a) Does the Illinois Whistleblower Reward and Protection Act, 740 ILCS 175/1, violate\n\nthe Attorney General clause of the Illinois Constitution, Article V, Section 15, by improperly\n\nusurping the exclusive authority of the Attorney General to initiate and conduct litigation on\n\nbehalf of the State?\n\n\n\n                                                  4\n\f1-05-1059\n\n        (b) Does the Illinois Whistleblower Reward and Protection Act, 740 ILCS 175/1, as\n\napplied to tax matters, violate either the Attorney General clause or the Executive Compensation\n\nclause of the Illinois Constitution, Article V, Sections 15 and 21?\"\n\n        This court denied defendants' Rule 308 petition; however, the Illinois Supreme Court\n\npursuant to its supervisory authority directed this court to answer the above certified questions,\n\nwhich we now do in this appeal.\n\n\n\n                                          BACKGROUND\n\n        The following facts are relevant to answering the certified questions raised on appeal.\n\nThe law firm of Beeler, Schad & Diamond filed a complaint alleging that the defendant retailers'\n\nrecords, returns and statements that claimed no use tax was due on their sales to Illinois\n\nconsumers were knowingly false within the meaning of the Act. Beeler, Schad & Diamond filed\n\nthis complaint on behalf of the State of Illinois as a relator. The complaint alleged that\n\n\"defendants are retailers whose out-of-state operations made sales to Illinois residents over the\n\nInternet and/or through catalogs and defendants failed to collect and remit use tax on these\n\nsales.\" The complaint also alleged that each of defendants' Web sites, retailers' records, returns\n\nand statements that claimed no use tax due on its sales to Illinois customers was knowingly false\n\nwithin the meaning of the Act.\n\n        Beeler, Schad & Diamond also filed a similar complaint in Nevada. In the Nevada case,\n\nthe Nevada Supreme Court addressed the false claims actions brought by Beeler, Schad &\n\nDiamond relating to allegations of falsified tax liabilities associated with the retailers' Internet\n\nand/or catalog sales. International Game Technology, Inc. v. Second Judicial District Court of\n\n                                                   5\n\f1-05-1059\n\nthe State of Nevada, 122 Nev. 132, ____, 127 P.3d 1088, 1095 (2006). The Attorney General in\n\nthe Nevada case intervened and moved to dismiss the case. International Game Technology,\n\nInc., 122 Nev. at ____, 127 P.3d at 1096. The Nevada Supreme Court affirmed the trial court's\n\ndismissal of the case. International Game Technology, 122 Nev. at ___, 127 P.3d at 1108. The\n\nNevada court held that false claims actions incorporating the state's revenue statutes were not\n\nnecessarily excluded as claims appropriately brought under the Nevada false claims act, but the\n\nAttorney General had articulated a legitimate government purpose for intervening and\n\ndismissing the complaint, asserting that the entity entrusted to maintain consistency and\n\nuniformity in the tax laws should resolve the issue. International Game Technology, 122 Nev. at\n\n___, 127 P.3d at 1108.\n\n       Here, the Attorney General intervened in the matter filed in the circuit court and\n\nprosecuted the matter on the State's behalf. In response to the complaint filed in Illinois,\n\ndefendants filed a joint motion to dismiss. The trial court denied defendants' joint motion to\n\ndismiss and also granted defendants' motion for an interlocutory appeal under Rule 308. This\n\ncourt denied defendants' Rule 308 petition for leave to appeal, and defendants appealed that\n\ndecision to the Illinois Supreme Court, which directed this court pursuant to its supervisory\n\nauthority to answer the certified questions.\n\n       Before addressing the certified questions, we deem it necessary to provide background\n\ninformation underlying the questions in the instant appeal. The act implicated in the instant\n\nmatter is the Illinois Whistleblower Reward and Protection Act (740 ILCS 175/1, et seq. (West\n\n2002)). The Act provides a provision relating to false claims. 740 ILCS 175/3 (West 2002).\n\nAccording to the false claims provision, a person presents a false claim when he \"knowingly\n\n                                                  6\n\f1-05-1059\n\nmakes, uses, or causes to be made or used, a false record or statement to conceal, avoid or\n\ndecrease an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the State.\" 740 ILCS 175/3(a)(7)\n\n(West 2002). The Illinois false claims provision defines \"knowing\" and \"knowingly\" as:\n\n               \"a person, with respect to information:\n\n                       (1) has actual knowledge of the information;\n\n                       (2) acts in deliberate ignorance of the truth or falsity of the information; or\n\n                       (3) acts in reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the information, and\n\n                       no proof of specific intent to defraud is required.\" 740 ILCS 175/3(b)\n\n                       (West 2002).\n\n       Alleged violations of the Act may be brought in a civil action commenced by the\n\nAttorney General or a private person, referred to as a \"relator,\" in the State's name in actions\n\nknown as qui tam actions. 740 ILCS 175/4(a), (b), (c) (West 2002). The State may intervene,\n\nproceed with the action and take over conduct of the action, or decline to intervene. 740 ILCS\n\n175/4(b)(4)(A), (B) (West 2002). If the State proceeds with an action commenced by the relator,\n\nthe relator receives a percentage of the proceeds from the successful disposition or settlement of\n\nthe claim. 740 ILCS 175/4(d) (West 2002).\n\n       The Act is modeled after the Federal False Claims Act (FCA) (31 U.S.C. §3729 et seq.\n\n(2000) and is an antifraud statute. State ex rel. Beeler, Schad & Diamond, P.C. v. Burlington\n\nCoat Factory Warehouse Corp., 369 Ill. App. 3d 507, 510-11, 860 N.E.2d 423, 425-26 (2006).\n\nThe FCA includes a provision referred to as the \"reverse false claims\" provision. The reverse\n\nfalse claims provision \"was added 'to provide that an individual who makes a material\n\nmisrepresentation to avoid paying money owed the Government would be equally liable under\n\n                                                  7\n\f1-05-1059\n\nthe Act as if he had submitted a false claim to receive money.' \" United States ex rel. Bahrani v.\n\nConagra, Inc., 465 F.3d 1189, 1194 (10th Cir. 2006), quoting Senate Report No. 99-345, at 18,\n\n1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5283. A reverse false claims cause of action \"requires proof that the\n\ndefendant 'knowingly' made, used, or caused to be made a false record or statement to avoid an\n\nobligation. To act 'knowingly' means that a person, with respect to information: (1) has actual\n\nknowledge of the information; (2) acts in deliberate ignorance of the truth or falsity of the\n\ninformation; or (3) acts in reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the information.\" Bahrani,\n\n465 F.3d at 1205-06. To succeed in a reverse false claims cause of action, \"[n]o proof of specific\n\nintent to defraud is required.\" Bahrani, 465 F.3d at 1206.\n\n       The obligation allegedly avoided here is the payment of use tax. The use tax is a tax on\n\nthe privilege of using tangible property in the State. 35 ILCS 105/3 (West 2002). The use tax\n\nmust be collected and remitted by any retailer maintaining a place of business in Illinois. 35\n\nILCS 105/3-45 (West 2002).\n\n       Our review of an interlocutory appeal brought pursuant to Rule 308 \"is strictly limited to\n\nthe certified question.\" In re Estate of Williams, 366 Ill. App. 3d 746, 748, 853 N.E.2d 79, 82\n\n(2006). Our responsibility in addressing Rule 308 cases \"is to answer the certified question\n\nrather than to rule on the propriety of the parties' claims.\" In re Estate of Williams, 366 Ill. App.\n\n3d at 748, 853 N.E.2d at 82. With these principles in mind, we now turn our attention to\n\nanswering the certified questions at issue in the instant case.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  8\n\f1-05-1059\n\n                                            ANALYSIS\n\n                                             Question 1\n\n       The first question that we will address is what constitutes a \"knowingly\" false record or\n\nstatement sufficient to create liability under the Act. Defendants contend that the allegedly false\n\nstatements at issue here reflect nothing more than a \"difference in interpretation growing out of a\n\ndisputed legal question.\" United States ex rel. Humphrey v. Franklin-Williamson Human\n\nServices, Inc., 189 F.Supp. 2d 862, 867 (S.D. Ill. 2002). Defendants claim that whether they\n\nwere required to collect use tax is a disputed question of law and assuming arguendo that the\n\nalleged violations could be proved, the State could not prove that defendants had the requisite\n\n\"knowledge\" required under the Act. Defendants contend that, despite the trial court's decision\n\nthat a disputed legal question cannot, as a matter of law, be knowingly false, the trial court erred\n\nin its treatment of this decision by denying defendants' motion to dismiss. Defendants assert that\n\nsince the laws and regulations regarding nexus in Illinois are disputed and in a \"quagmire,\"\n\ncauses of action premised on nexus with Illinois cannot create a violation of the Act, which\n\nrequires a \"knowing\" fraud upon the State. 740 ILCS 175/3(a)(7) (West 2002).\n\n       The State responds that whether defendants acted with the requisite state of mind is a\n\nquestion of fact that cannot be resolved on a motion to dismiss. The State maintains that\n\nwhether defendants had a sufficient nexus with Illinois subjecting them to use tax depends on the\n\nquantity, nature and scope of their contacts with Illinois. The State similarly contends that the\n\ncomplaints alleged that defendants had sufficient contacts with Illinois to create a tax liability\n\nand that defendants knowingly made false statements that they did not owe use tax. As such, the\n\ntrial court properly denied the motion to dismiss.\n\n                                                  9\n\f1-05-1059\n\n       Under the circumstances of the instant case, the answer to this certified question is that a\n\nremote retailer cannot make a \"knowingly\" false record or statement sufficient to create liability\n\nunder the Act when the pertinent area of the law is unclear and specific factual analysis must be\n\ncompleted to determine if the retailers' use tax liability was correctly disclosed as $0. To prevail\n\nin a reverse false claims cause of action, proof is required: \"(1) that the defendant made, used, or\n\ncaused to be used a record or statement to conceal, avoid, or decrease an obligation to the United\n\nStates; (2) that the statement or record was false; (3) that the defendant knew that the statement\n\nor record was false; and (4) that the United States suffered damages as a result.” Wilkins ex rel.\n\nUnited States v. State of Ohio, 885 F.Supp. 1055, 1059 (S.D. Ohio 1995), citing United States ex\n\nrel. Stinson, Lyons, Gerlin & Bustamante, P.A. v. Provident Life & Accident Insurance Co., 721\n\nF.Supp. 1247, 1258-59 (S.D. Fla. 1989).\n\n       We find Wilkins ex rel. United States v. State of Ohio, 885 F.Supp. 1055 (S.D. Ohio\n\n1995), instructive in defining the term “knowingly.” The Wilkins court addressed the requisite\n\nknowledge needed to prevail in a reverse false claims act violation and stated that “[t]he gist of\n\nthe violation is not an intent to deceive but the knowing presentation of a claim, record or\n\nstatement that is either ‘fraudulent’ or ‘false’ and the requisite intent is the knowing presentation\n\nof what is ‘known to be false.’ ” Wilkins, 885 F.Supp. at 1059, citing Wang ex rel. United States\n\nv. FMC Corp., 975 F.2d 1412, 1421 (9th Cir. 1992), citing United States ex rel. Hagood v.\n\nSonoma County Water Agency, 929 F.2d 1416, 1421 (9th Cir. 1991); see also Thompson Pacific\n\nConstruction, Inc. v. City of Sunnyvale, No. H029818, slip. op. at 12 (Cal. App. September 21,\n\n2007). Interpreting United States ex rel. Stevens v. McGinnins, No. C-1-93-442 (S.D. Ohio\n\n1994), the Wilkins court stated that McGinnins “does not hold that the mere failure to record or\n\n                                                 10\n\f1-05-1059\n\nreport violations of the law which might result in an obligation to pay money is sufficient in\n\nitself to violate subsection (a)(7). Rather, . . . in order to recover under subsection (a)(7), the\n\nplaintiff must also prove that the false information, be it in the form of an affirmative statement\n\nor an omission, was knowingly submitted by the defendant to the United States Government for\n\nthe purpose of avoiding a debt or obligation to the government.\" Wilkins, 885 F.Supp. at 1064.\n\nWe find it necessary to draw upon the distinction between a material omission that was not\n\nrecorded as required on a document amounting to a deliberate concealment and the instance here\n\nwhere the alleged omission arose from an interpretation and analysis of an existing area of\n\nunsettled law.\n\n        We also note that the Illinois Department of Revenue's (Department) position regarding\n\nnexus determinations consistently rests upon an analysis of the facts specific to a taxpayer. Even\n\nthough the Department has created a general guideline to assist in making nexus determinations,\n\nwhether an entity has sufficient nexus in the State to impose a tax liability rests upon the specific\n\nfacts of the transaction. Illinois Department of Revenue General Information Letter, ST\n\n07-0063-GIL (June 12, 2007). Given the Department's consistent position that nexus\n\ndeterminations are a fact-specific inquiry and the myriad of considerations that must be\n\nundertaken to determine nexus based on the nature and extent of activities within the State, we\n\ncannot conclude that a retailer that does not collect and remit use tax, but does discloses that no\n\nuse tax was collected, can \"knowingly\" make a false record or statement necessary to create a\n\nliability under the Act.\n\n        We further note that dismissing a complaint that raises a question of fact has long been\n\nrejected in this state. See A.F.P. Enterprises, Inc. v. Crescent Pork, Inc., 243 Ill. App. 3d 905,\n\n                                                  11\n\f1-05-1059\n\n912, 611 N.E.2d 619, 625-26 (1993). It is uncertain at this stage of the proceedings whether\n\ndefendants consulted with a tax professional or sought tax advice regarding their use tax\n\nobligations in Illinois, which would assist in determining whether defendants \"knowingly\"\n\nomitted collecting use tax in Illinois as defined by the FCA or if the failure to collect and remit\n\nuse tax was based on flawed reasoning or a difference in interpretation of disputed legal\n\nquestions. See United States v. Bourseau, No. 03-CV-907-BEN (WMC), slip op. at 13 (S.D.\n\nCal. September 29, 2006). As such, the trial court did not err in denying the motion to dismiss in\n\nlight of the necessary factual determinations that must be made regarding defendants’\n\nknowledge.\n\n\n\n                                           Question 2(a)\n\n       We answer this question by stating that the Act requires the existence of an actual record\n\nor statement; however, the failure to keep a record when required to do so may be actionable\n\nunder the Act given the proper factual scenario. Defendants assert that finding a \"false\n\nstatement\" requires a complaint to allege: (1) an actual \"record or statement\"; (2) that is \"false\";\n\nand (3) that was submitted to or relied upon by the State. Defendants contend that the alleged\n\nfalse statements here relate to the failure to create a record, and the absence of a record cannot\n\nviolate the Act. Defendants maintain that contrary to the trial court's finding, the failure to keep\n\nreports of tax owed does not constitute a false record. To support this contention, defendants\n\ncite to American Textile Manufacturers. Institute, Inc. v. The Limited, Inc., 190 F.3d 729, 736\n\n(6th Cir. 1999), Pickens v. Kanawha River Towing, 916 F.Supp. 702, 708 (S.D. Ohio 1996), and\n\nIn re Krikava, 236 B.R. 701, 708 (Bankr. D. Neb. 1999). Defendants also recite the Act's\n\n                                                 12\n\f1-05-1059\n\nlanguage, which states in pertinent part: \"Any person *** who knowingly makes, uses, or causes\n\nto be made or used, a false record or statement to conceal, avoid or decrease an obligation to pay\n\nor transmit money or property to the State ***.\" 740 ILCS 175/3(a)(7) (West 2002).\n\nDefendants maintain that according to the Act's plain language, \"making\" or \"using\" a record or\n\nstatement requires the existence of an actual record. Absent an actual record, defendants claim\n\nthat a violation of the Act cannot exist.\n\n       The State responds that the Act is an antifraud statute and, as such, the intentional\n\nconcealment of a material fact is the equivalent of a false statement of material fact. The State\n\nmaintains that under the Illinois tax statutes and regulations, a retailer who is required to collect\n\nuse tax must maintain records showing that he collected the tax \"in accordance with [86 Ill.\n\nAdm. Code §150.405] and that he states such tax separately to the purchaser from the selling\n\nprice of the tangible personal property which he is selling.\" 86 Ill. Adm. Code §150.1305(a)\n\n(amended and eff. August 21, 1974). The State claims that the complaint adequately stated that\n\ndefendants did not prepare and maintain records showing that they collected the required taxes,\n\nomitted from their verified returns the use tax liability incurred on retail sales over the Internet,\n\nand failed to remit to the State the full amount of their use tax liability. The State asserts that\n\ndefendants' failure to maintain records and to make disclosures to the State when required to do\n\nso, as well as withholding information when making those disclosures, is the equivalent of\n\ncreating a false record for purposes of the Act.\n\n       The State relies on United States ex rel. Oliver v. Parsons Co., 195 F.3d 457, 465 (9th\n\nCir. 1999), which held that the failure to disclose required information in a disclosure statement\n\nwas sufficient evidence of a false statement or record to preclude summary judgment. The State\n\n                                                   13\n\f1-05-1059\n\nalso relies on United States ex rel. Augustine v. Century Health Services, Inc., 289 F.3d 409, 415\n\n(6th Cir. 2002), which held that \"a false implied certification may constitute a false or fraudulent\n\nclaim even if the claim was not expressly false when it was filed.\" The State further relies on\n\nPickens v. Kanawha River Towing, 916 F.Supp. 702 (S.D. Ohio 1996), for the proposition that\n\nthe failure to accurately maintain a record constituted a false record under the FCA. Pickens,\n\n916 F.Supp. at 708. The State claims that defendants were required to verify, under penalty of\n\nperjury, the accuracy of their returns, records and payments, which omitted the use tax that they\n\nwere required to collect, record and disclose, rendering the documents false for purposes of the\n\nAct. The State asserts that defendants' documents falsely represented that no use tax was due\n\nand not that it was passing its legal obligation to collect and remit the use tax to its customers.\n\n       We answer certified question 2(a) in the affirmative. To state a claim under the Act, the\n\nalleged violation must be based on a false statement or document. We restrict our answer to stay\n\nwithin the limited scope of concluding that an actual document must exist; however, we do not\n\nexpress an opinion as to whether concealment of or omission of material information from\n\ndocuments or records is sufficient to state a claim because such an inquiry is outside the scope of\n\nthe certified question. Without the existence of a document or statement, we believe it would be\n\ndifficult to determine whether the document was false. See American Textile Manufacturers\n\nInstitute, Inc., 190 F.3d at 736 (stating that \"a reverse false claim action cannot proceed without\n\nproof that the defendant made a false record or statement at a time that the defendant owed to the\n\ngovernment an obligation sufficiently certain to give rise to an action of debt at common law\");\n\nUnited States ex rel. Marcy v. Rowan Cos., No. 03-3395, slip op. at 12-13, 15 (E.D. La. August\n\n17, 2006) (noting that defendants neglected to record discharges in an oil log book and weekly\n\n                                                  14\n\f1-05-1059\n\ndrilling reports in attempt to conceal defendants' obligations to pay oil royalties, transfer oil\n\nresources and civil fines); United States ex rel. Drake v. Norden Systems, Inc., No. 3:94-CV-\n\n963(EBB), slip op. at 12 (D. Conn. August 24, 2000) (referring to specific documents that were\n\nsubmitted to conceal payment of an obligation).\n\n       We believe the cases relied upon by the State are distinguishable because those cases do\n\nnot address reverse false claims violations that are at issue here or they relate to an omission of\n\nmaterial information from existing documents. Oliver, 195 F.3d at 465 (addressed the exclusion\n\nof companies on a disclosure statement); Pickens, 916 F.Supp. at 708 (discussed the failure to\n\nrecord discharges on a vessel's log); and United States ex rel. Augustine v. Century Health\n\nServices, Inc., 289 F.3d 409, 415 (6th Cir. 2002) (addressed the continuing duty to provide\n\ninformation after initial documents were submitted). We must also state that our role in this\n\nappeal is not to determine whether defendants violated any relevant sections of the Illinois tax\n\nstatutes and regulations by not filing appropriate returns or supporting documents, and as such,\n\nwe express no opinion regarding any alleged violation of the Illinois tax laws. Adopting a literal\n\nreading of the Act's statutory language, we must conclude that an actual false record or statement\n\nmust exist to bring a claim under the Act. See Whitledge v. Klein, 348 Ill. App. 3d 1059, 1062,\n\n810 N.E.2d 303, 305-06 (2004). Without an actual document, the next required determination in\n\nthe analysis of whether the record or statement was false would be difficult, potentially even\n\nimpossible under certain circumstances.\n\n       We must now consider the trial court's reliance on Pickens v. Kanawha River Towing,\n\n916 F.Supp. 702 (S.D. Ohio 1996). The Pickens court agreed \"that a reverse false claim requires\n\nmore than a mere failure to report a violation of another statute.\" Pickens, 916 F.Supp. at 708.\n\n                                                  15\n\f1-05-1059\n\nThe Pickens court also held that \"[a] failure to report does not count as a statement or record.\"\n\nPickens, 916 F.Supp. at 708. In Pickens, the court held that a vessel log that omitted a major\n\nevent that it should ordinarily contain renders the record to be a false record for purposes of the\n\nAct if the government relies upon or otherwise reviews the logs as part of its regulatory role.\n\nPickens, 916 F.Supp. at 708. We note that unlike the record in Pickens, in which a material\n\nevent was omitted from the record, the record in the instant case provides for and includes a\n\nseparate line item reflecting that the use tax collected relating to the specific purchase was $0.\n\nThus, in the instant case, defendants disclosed the pertinent information, but whether that\n\ninformation was accurately disclosed is for the trial court to determine on the evidence\n\npresented. In both Pickens and here, however, the alleged false statements can be traced to an\n\nactual record.\n\n\n\n                                           Question 2(b)\n\n       Our answer to this certified question is that documents memorializing that no use tax is\n\ndue or collected should not be considered false under the Act provided the retailer lacked\n\nscienter when generating the documents. Our analysis of this issue focuses on the meaning of\n\nthe term \"false\" or \"falsity.\" Although the FCA does not define the term \"falsity,\" generally,\n\nfalsity means an untruth. Fru-Con Construction Corp. v. Sacramento Municipal Utility District,\n\nNo. S-05-583 LKK/GGH (E.D. Cal. June 15, 2007). Since falsity is synonymous with an\n\nuntruth, \"[E]xpressions of opinion, scientific judgments, or statements as to conclusions about\n\nwhich reasonable minds may differ cannot be false.\" United States Maxwell ex rel. v.\n\n\n\n                                                 16\n\f1-05-1059\n\nKerr-McGee Chemical Worldwide, LLC, No 04-CV-01224-PSF-CBS, slip op. at 2 (D. Colo.\n\nOctober 6, 2006).\n\n       Defendants contend that documents demonstrating that tax was not being collected\n\ncannot as a matter of law be deemed \"false\" because a \"true\" statement cannot be \"false\" within\n\nthe Act's meaning. United States ex rel. Garst v. Lockheed Integrated Solutions Co., 158\n\nF.Supp. 2d 816, 823 (N.D. Ill. 2001); United States ex rel. Lamers v. City of Green Bay, 168\n\nF.3d 1013, 1018 (7tth Cir. 1999); United States ex rel. Hopper v. Anton, 91 F.3d 1261 (9th Cir.\n\n1996). Defendants contend that the statements on the documents that \"Tax: $0.00\" represents\n\ntruthful assertions that no tax was being collected, which cannot be deemed false. In response,\n\nthe State contends that defendants' failed to collect use tax and falsely stated that no Illinois use\n\ntax was applicable to the retail sales.\n\n       We conclude that a document reflecting that no use tax is being collected and the\n\ndocument reflects that use tax due is \"$0.00\" cannot be considered false for purposes of the Act.\n\nWe agree with defendants' position that a document that reflects the tax due relating to a\n\ntransaction is $0 and that no tax was in fact being collected cannot be false for purposes of the\n\nAct but, instead, represents a truthful assertion. We must emphasize that our inquiry here is not\n\nto determine whether a knowingly false statement is required, which is the subject of the first\n\ncertified question but, instead, whether a statement that is factually true can be deemed false for\n\npurposes of bringing a claim under the Act. Neither party here disputes that no use tax was\n\ncollected or that the invoices rendered to the purchasers reflected that no use tax was collected or\n\ndue. Since the documents at issue are factually true, in our view, factually true statements\n\ncannot be considered sufficiently false for purposes of bringing a claim under the Act. See Fru-\n\n                                                  17\n\f1-05-1059\n\nCon Construction Corp., slip op. at 17, citing Hindo v. University of Health Sciences/The\n\nChicago Medical School, 65 F.3d 608, 613 (7th Cir. 1995).\n\n\n\n                                           Question 2(c)\n\n       Next, we turn our attention to whether it is necessary that a false statement be submitted\n\nto or actually relied upon by the State for purposes of the Act. We conclude the answer to this\n\nquestion is no.\n\n       Defendants contend that for a claim to fall within the purview of the Act, it must be\n\npresented to and relied upon by the State. Defendants claim that the documents at issue here are\n\ngenerated in the course of business and are given to customers who purchase goods from\n\ndefendants and the documents are not submitted to or relied upon by the State. Defendants\n\nmaintain that a record must be submitted to the government to establish liability under the FCA\n\nand cite to the following cases in reliance for this proposition: Pickens, 916 F.Supp. at 708;\n\nWilkins, 885 F.Supp. at 1064; Hopper, 91 F.3d at 1266-67; United States ex rel. Karvelas v.\n\nMelrose-Wakefield Hospital, 360 F.3d 220, 232 (1st Cir. 2004); United States ex rel. Clausen v.\n\nLaboratory Corp. of America, Inc., 290 F.3d 1301, 1311 (11th Cir. 2002); United States ex rel.\n\nAtkinson v. Pennsylvania Shipbuilding Co., No. CIV. A. 94-7316 (E.D. Pa. August 24, 2000);\n\nand United States ex rel. Thompson v. Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp., 125 F.3d 899, 903 (5th\n\nCir. 1997). Defendants claim that an entity cannot \"conceal, avoid or decrease an obligation ***\n\nto the Government\" based on a record unless the government sees the record. Defendants\n\ncontend that the trial court erred in relying on Pickens v. Kahawah River Towing, 916 F.Supp. at\n\n708, which held that no reliance requirement exists, because the government would see and rely\n\n                                                18\n\f1-05-1059\n\non the allegedly false records at issue in Pickens. Defendants assert that the Act requires an\n\nallegedly false statement or record to be submitted to or actually relied upon by the State to\n\nconstitute a violation of the Act.\n\n        The State responds that documents are considered submitted to the State for purposes of\n\nthe Act if the State potentially may rely upon the documents. The State claims that the invoices,\n\norder confirmations, and sales receipts that defendants distribute to retail purchasers are the same\n\nrecords that the State relies on to determine defendants' tax burden and regulatory compliance\n\nand direct submission to the State is not necessary. 35 ILCS 105/11 (West 2004); 35 ILCS 120/7\n\n(West 2004); 86 Ill. Adm. Code §1305(b) (amended and eff. August 21, 1974). The State\n\nmaintains that it is sufficient that the State could have seen and relied upon the documents as part\n\nof its regular operations to satisfy this element.\n\n        The answer to this certified question is that a document is not required to be submitted to\n\nor directly relied upon by the government to violate the Act. We note that the State relies upon\n\nUnited States ex rel. Bahrani v. Conagra, Inc., 465 F.3d 1189 (10th Cir. October 12, 2006),\n\nwhich addressed the presentment requirement of documents to the government in the context of\n\nreverse false claims actions. The issue addressed in Bahrani was whether export certificates\n\npresented only to foreign governments could satisfy the false representation or presentment\n\nrequirement of a reverse false claims violation. Bahrani, 465 F.3d at 1206. The Bahrani court\n\nconcluded that according to the plain language of the reverse false claims statute, presentment of\n\ndocuments to the government is not required. Bahrani, 465 F.3d at 1207; see also United States\n\nex rel. Koch v. Koch Industries, 57 F.Supp. 2d 1122, 1144 (N.D. Okla. 1999). In reaching this\n\nconclusion, the Bahrani court considered the reverse false claims language in comparison to\n\n                                                     19\n\f1-05-1059\n\nother sections of the false claims statute which, unlike the reverse false claims provision,\n\nexpressly require presentment to the government. Bahrani, 465 F.3d at 1207. Here, similar to\n\nthe presentment claim in Bahrani, the documents at issue were not presented directly to the\n\ngovernment, but were instead given directly to customers. Finding Bahrani persuasive, we also\n\nconclude that actual presentment to and reliance on allegedly false documents by the government\n\nis not required. See also Koch, 57 F.Supp. 2d at 1144 (noting that the bad act in reverse false\n\nclaims \"is the making or using of a false statement or record.\")\n\n\n\n                                             Question 3\n\n       Next, we address whether the Act is a proper vehicle for the collection of sales and use\n\ntax. Our analysis first begins with whether claims brought under the Act afford taxpayers the\n\nsame protections afforded to claims brought under the tax laws. Defendants contend that the\n\nsales and use tax laws and the Act are not equivalent and allowing the claims to proceed as\n\nwhistleblower claims denies defendants due process safeguards and creates a conflict with the\n\nState's tax laws. Defendants maintain that the tax statutes provide rights and protections against\n\n\"unlawful exactions\" that are not provided for under the Act, thereby creating a conflict between\n\nthe two statutes. Defendants claim that the trial court erroneously concluded that the tax statutes\n\nand the Act are functionally equivalent in that they both seek collection of taxes. Defendants,\n\nciting Humphrey, 189 F.Supp. 2d at 866-67, and United States ex rel. Gross v. AIDS Research\n\nAlliance-Chicago, 415 F.3d 601 (7th Cir. 2005), contend that the Act exists to prevent fraud\n\nagainst the State and to shield from retribution those who uncover wrongdoing, but does not\n\nexist to collect taxes. Alternatively, defendants contend that the tax statutes exist to ensure the\n\n                                                 20\n\f1-05-1059\n\ndetermination, assessment and collection of \"tax properly due the State\" by the Department.\n\nThus, defendants assert that a conflict between the Act and tax statutes exists, precluding the\n\nfiling of tax claims under the Act. In response, the State contends that defendants are afforded\n\nprotections provided to litigants in civil suits and, unlike alleged tax violations, do not bear the\n\nburden of proof associated with tax deficiencies. Thus, the State claims that due process rights\n\nare not sacrificed when tax-related claims are brought under the Act.\n\n       We agree that the Illinois tax statutes are not identical to the Act, but we cannot reach the\n\ndefinitive conclusion that tax claims can never be brought under the Act on the basis that the Act\n\ndoes not provide the same safeguards and protections provided for under the tax laws. The State\n\ncorrectly notes the distinguishing feature of claims brought under the Act is that these actions are\n\ncivil in nature and afford defendants the protections innate in all civil cause of actions, in\n\ncontrast to claims brought under the tax statutes, which afford defendants an opportunity to\n\ndispute and settle assessed tax deficiencies.\n\n       We have considered defendants’ claims that despite the protections afforded to\n\ndefendants under civil causes of action, these protections are not the same, specific protections\n\nafforded to defendants under the tax laws. We must keep in mind, however, the nature of the\n\nallegations at issue in the instant case. The nature of the claims here relates to defendants’\n\nalleged fraudulent failure to collect and remit use tax. Defendants contend that it is improper to\n\nbring claims under the Act when the Department has not yet assessed or determined any tax\n\nliability relating to the claim of failing to pay use tax. Defendants correctly detail the\n\nadministrative process afforded to taxpayers when a dispute regarding an alleged failure to pay\n\ntaxes arises. See 35 ILCS 105/12 (West 2004); 35 ILCS 120/12 (West 2004). However, the\n\n                                                  21\n\f1-05-1059\n\nspecific inquiry and determination that must be made under the Act is whether defendants acted\n\nknowingly in failing to pay use tax liabilities. The inquiry and dispute at issue here is not the\n\ndetermination and disagreement over the amount of tax assessed, but whether defendants acted\n\nwith the requisite fraudulent intent and knowledge. In light of the nature of the claim and its\n\ncharacterization as a civil cause of action, we cannot hold that the Act can never be used to\n\nenforce the collection of taxes due to the State because it deprives defendants of due process\n\nprotections. See 740 ILCS 175/4 (West 2002). It is also worthy to note that the Act does not\n\nseek to impose and collect a tax, but instead seeks to penalize actions that deprive the\n\ngovernment of funds rightfully owed to it regardless of the nature of the underlying transaction\n\ngiving rise to the claim.\n\n\n\n                                             Question 4\n\n       The answer to this question is that the Department is not the sole entity authorized to\n\nassess and collect use tax when evidence of a defendant knowingly generating a false record or\n\nstatement to avoid payment of tax exists. Defendants contend that the Department has exclusive\n\nauthority to assess and collect use tax based on a statutory grant of authority; and as such, claims\n\nfiled to collect taxes cannot be brought under the Act. See Village of Niles v. K mart Corp., 158\n\nIll. App. 3d 521, 523-24, 511 N.E.2d 703, 704 (1987); People ex. rel. Fahner v. AT&T Co., 86\n\nIll. 2d 479, 487, 427 N.E.2d 1226, 1230 (1981). Defendants maintain that the trial court erred in\n\nrelying on People v. N L Industries, 152 Ill. 2d 82, 604 N.E.2d 349 (1992), because that case did\n\nnot involve the assessment or collection of a tax. Defendants claim that Fahner v. AT&T clearly\n\nestablishes that tax cases are handled differently from other proceedings and that the power to\n\n                                                 22\n\f1-05-1059\n\ncollect use taxes cannot be removed from the Department and brought under the Act. As such,\n\ndefendants assert that the Department is the sole entity authorized to assess and collect use tax.\n\n       The State responds that nothing in the Administrative Procedures Act (5 ILCS 100/1-1 et\n\nseq. (West 2004)) or the Use Tax Act (35 ILCS 105/12 (West 2004)) provides exclusive\n\njurisdiction in the Department to decide all use tax enforcement questions. Employers Mutual\n\nCos. v. Skilling, 163 Ill. 2d 284, 287, 644 N.E.2d 1163, 1165 (1994); Village of Itasca v. Village\n\nof Lisle, 352 Ill. App. 3d 847, 855-56, 817 N.E.2d 160, 169 (2004). The State contends that the\n\nDepartment has the authority to notify the Attorney General of an entity's violation of sales tax,\n\nwhich lends support to the principle that the Attorney General can also enforce tax laws. See\n\nN L Industries, 152 Ill. 2d at 102-03, 604 N.E.2d at 355-56.\n\n       First, we note that the Illinois General Assembly has the power to generate revenue in the\n\nstate and to vest exclusive jurisdiction in an administrative agency. See Village of Lisle, 352 Ill.\n\nApp. 3d at 852, 817 N.E.2d at 166. We agree with the State that this court’s decision in Village\n\nof Itasca v. Village of Lisle, 352 Ill. App. 3d 847, 817 N.E.2d 160 (2004), is instructive here. In\n\nVillage of Lisle, this court, in relying upon the Illinois Supreme Court’s decision in Employers\n\nMutual Cos. v. Skilling, 163 Ill. 2d 284, 287, 644 N.E.2d 1163, 1165 (1994), held that explicit\n\nexclusionary language must be expressed to confer exclusive jurisdiction upon an administrative\n\nagency. Skilling, 163 Ill. 2d at 287, 644 N.E.2d at 1165; Village of Lisle, 352 Ill. App. 3d at 852,\n\n817 N.E.2d at 166-67. Absent exclusive jurisdiction, concurrent jurisdiction exists. See Village\n\nof Lisle, 352 Ill. App. 3d at 853, 817 N.E.2d at 167. We rely on the Village of Lisle decision as\n\nprecedent for establishing that the Department lacks exclusive authority to collect taxes since\n\nthat authority was not expressly exclusively granted to the Department. Defendants rely on\n\n                                                 23\n\f1-05-1059\n\nFahner v. AT&T, 86 Ill. 2d 479, 427 N.E.2d 1226 (1981), in which the Illinois Supreme Court\n\nheld that the Department alone has the authority to determine whether an entity is a taxpayer\n\nwithin the meaning of the Message Tax Act. We express no opinion on the applicability of\n\nFahner here in light of the different taxing statutes at issue and, instead, rely on the Illinois\n\nSupreme Court’s subsequent decision in Skilling.\n\n        Turning to the Nevada Supreme Court’s decision in International Game Technology, Inc.\n\nv. Second Judicial District Court of the State of Nevada, 122 Nev. 132, ____, 127 P.3d 1088,\n\n1105 (2006), which defendants rely upon, we note that the court held that the department of\n\nrevenue does not have exclusive control over all proceedings related to tax issues. The Nevada\n\nSupreme Court did not conclude that claims are precluded from being brought under the state's\n\nfalse claims act. See International Game Technology, Inc., 122 Nev. at ___, 127 P.3d at 1105.\n\nRather, the Nevada Supreme Court noted that the state's revenue statutes do not provide the tax\n\ncommission with exclusive jurisdiction over tax matters and, thus, tax matters may fall under the\n\nFCA's scope even if they arise out of allegations based on money owed under the revenue\n\nstatutes. International Game Technology, Inc., 122 Nev. at ___, 127 P.3d at 1104. The Nevada\n\nSupreme Court did continue to hold, however, that determinations requiring an analysis of sales\n\nand use tax statutes are \"determinations better left to the tax department in order to promote\n\nconsistency and uniformity.\" International Game Technology, Inc., 122 Nev. at ___, 127 P.3d at\n\n1108.\n\n        Similarly, this court in Village of Lisle, acknowledged that where an administrative\n\n\"agency’s technical expertise would help resolve the controversy, or when there is a need for\n\nuniform administrative standards,\" authority to resolve the dispute should be relinquished to the\n\n                                                  24\n\f1-05-1059\n\nadministrative agency. Village of Lisle, 352 Ill. App. 3d at 853, 817 N.E.2d at 167. In the\n\nVillage of Lisle case, at issue was whether the defendant was filing false reports to the\n\nDepartment for sales tax purposes. Village of Lisle, 352 Ill. App. 3d at 855, 817 N.E.2d at 168.\n\nThis court in Village of Lisle held that since little interpretation of the tax laws was required to\n\ndetermine the defendant's proper site for sales-tax purposes and the trial court was only required\n\nto make a finding of fact whether the defendant was misrepresenting that site, resolution of those\n\nissues did not require the Department’s technical expertise and the trial court could properly\n\nresolve the issues. Village of Lisle, 352 Ill. App. 3d at 855, 817 N.E.2d at 168-69. The Village\n\nof Lisle holding lends further support for the proposition that the Department lacks exclusive\n\nauthority in addressing tax issues. See Village of Lisle, 352 Ill. App. 3d at 853-54, 817 N.E.2d at\n\n167-68. Although the Village of Lisle case dealt with sales tax issues, we note that the sales tax\n\nis comprised of the two complementary statutes, consisting of the Retailers’ Occupation Tax (35\n\nILCS 120/1 et seq. (West 2004)) and the Use Tax Act (35 ILCS 105/1 et seq. (West 2004)).\n\nBrown v. Zehnder, 295 Ill. App. 3d 1031, 1034, 693 N.E.2d 1255, 1258 (1998). Thus, we deem\n\nthe rationale set forth in the Village of Lisle to also be applicable to use tax. Accordingly, the\n\nDepartment is not the sole entity authorized to handle tax-related claims relating to the\n\nassessment and collection of use tax.\n\n       We believe it is important to draw a distinction that is not fully drawn by defendants.\n\nThis appeal is not seeking to assess and collect tax on defendants, which defendants contend is\n\nwithin the exclusive jurisdiction of the Department. If this were the situation, then the\n\nDepartment would conduct an audit of defendants' records and impose any deficient taxes on\n\ndefendants. Rather, the underlying claim in the instant case is that defendants knowingly failed\n\n                                                  25\n\f1-05-1059\n\nto remit use tax to the State as defined by the Act and falsified documents. The nature of these\n\nallegations exceeds a claim for a tax deficiency, which would fall within the purview of the\n\nDepartment's powers to assess and collect use taxes. Instead, the allegations here relate to the\n\nintent underlying defendants' alleged creation of false records and statements, which is an area\n\nthat does not require the Department's specialized knowledge and is an area that the Attorney\n\nGeneral is more than competent to address. Accordingly, based on the nature of the claims\n\nraised in the instant case, the Department is not the sole entity authorized to assess and collect\n\nuse tax when allegations of false records and statements exists.\n\n\n\n                                             Question 5\n\n       Our answer to this certified question is that alleged use tax claims relating to Internet\n\nand/or catalog sales may be brought under the Act. Defendants point to the FCA’s language,\n\nwhich the Illinois Act was patterned after, that expressly excludes all tax matters under the\n\nInternal Revenue Code from falling within the purview of the FCA. Defendants maintain that\n\nthe Act’s express language that states it does not apply to the Illinois Income Tax Act (35 ILCS\n\n5/101 et seq. (West 2004) should be extended to also exclude the Use Tax Act. Defendants\n\ncontend that the Illinois legislature contemplated that not all Illinois taxes are incorporated in the\n\nIllinois Income Tax Act when it replaced the phrase “Internal Revenue Code” with “Illinois\n\nIncome Tax Act” in adopting the FCA. Thus, defendants assert that the Act does not apply to\n\nthe Use Tax Act.\n\n       The State responds that the Act does not exclude claims to enforce use tax obligations.\n\nThe State notes that the Act expressly states that it \"does not apply to claims, records, or\n\n                                                  26\n\f1-05-1059\n\nstatements made under the Illinois Income Tax Act.\" 740 ILCS 175/3(d) (West 2002). The\n\nState notes that in drafting the Act, the General Assembly included income tax claims, but did\n\nnot include use tax claims, which indicates the General Assembly's intent to exclude use tax\n\nclaims as falling under the Act's scope. See Mattis v. State Universities Retirement System, 212\n\nIll. 2d 58, 78, 816 N.E.2d 303, 314 (2004).\n\n       We reject defendants’ contention that the legislature did not contemplate extending the\n\nAct’s exclusionary language to include the Use Tax Act. The legislature is entrusted with the\n\npower to enact the laws of the State of Illinois, including tax laws, and to raise revenue for this\n\nState. We must reject defendants’ contention that the legislature was unaware that a separate\n\ntaxing scheme apart from the income taxes of the State exists when it adopted the FCA and\n\noverlooked expressly excluding those taxes from the Act. The fundamental rule of statutory\n\nconstruction is to determine and give effect to the intent of the legislature, and the statutory\n\nlanguage is the best indicator of the legislature’s intent. Quality Saw & Seal, Inc. v. Illinois\n\nCommerce Comm’n, 374 Ill. App. 3d 776, 781, 871 N.E.2d 260, 265 (2007). In interpreting a\n\nstatute, we cannot find an additional statutory exclusion where one was not provided for by the\n\nlegislature. City of Chicago v. Air Auto Leasing Co., 297 Ill. App. 3d 873, 878-79, 697 N.E.2d\n\n788, 791 (1998). The Illinois FCA, which is a provision within the Act, expressly states that\n\n“this section does not apply to claims, records, or statements made under the Illinois Income Tax\n\nAct.” 740 ILCS 175/4 (West 2002). Accordingly, under the plain language of the Act, we\n\nconclude that use tax claims may be brought under the Act.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  27\n\f1-05-1059\n\n                                            Question 6(a)\n\n       Our answer to this certified question is that the Act is constitutional and does not\n\nimproperly usurp the exclusive authority of the Attorney General to initiate and conduct\n\nlitigation on behalf of the State. Defendants claim that the Act's provisions directly conflict with\n\nthe Attorney General's \"exclusive constitutional power and prerogative to conduct the state's\n\nlegal affairs.\" (Emphasis in original.) Lyons v. Ryan, 201 Ill. 2d 529, 540, 780 N.E.2d 1098,\n\n1105 (2002). Defendants claim that as a result of the relator’s involvement in the proceedings, it\n\nwould be nearly impossible to identify and segregate the Attorney General’s independent role in\n\nthe litigation. Thus, the Act usurps the Attorney General's powers.\n\n       In response, the State contends that the Illinois Supreme Court previously rejected this\n\nsame contention in Scachitti v. UBS Financial Services, 215 Ill. 2d 484, 831 N.E.2d 544 (2005).\n\nThe State claims that in Schachitti, the Illinois Supreme Court held that the Act was not\n\nunconstitutional because the Attorney General retains the authority to control the litigation at\n\nevery stage of the proceedings. Scachitti, 215 Ill. 2d at 511, 831 N.E.2d at 560. Thus, following\n\nSchachitti, the State maintains that the Act is constitutional.\n\n       We agree with the State that the Act is constitutional. We rely on our state supreme\n\ncourt's decision in Scachitti. In Scachitti, the Illinois Supreme Court addressed whether the Act\n\nusurped the Attorney General's constitutional powers to represent the State. Scachitti, 215 Ill. 2d\n\nat 509, 831 N.E.2d at 559. The supreme court answered the question in the negative. Scachitti,\n\n215 Ill. 2d at 510, 831 N.E.2d at 559. The supreme court reasoned that the Attorney General\n\nretains the authority to control the litigation whereas the qui tam plaintiffs may conduct the\n\nlitigation on the State's behalf. Scachitti, 215 Ill. 2d at 510, 831 N.E.2d at 560. Retaining this\n\n                                                  28\n\f1-05-1059\n\ncontrol, the supreme court concluded, precludes a finding that the Act usurps the Attorney\n\nGeneral's constitutional power. Scachitti, 215 Ill. 2d at 513, 831 N.E.2d at 561. The supreme\n\ncourt further held that \"the qui tam provision of the Act is a 'constitutional statute,' as it does not\n\nusurp the Attorney General's constitutional power to conduct the legal affairs of the state when\n\nthe state is a real party in interest.\" Scachitti, 215 Ill. 2d at 515, 831 N.E.2d at 562. In light of\n\nthe Illinois Supreme Court's definitive conclusion that the Act does not usurp the Attorney\n\nGeneral's constitutional powers, we are not in a position to conclude otherwise. We further rely\n\non this court's decision in State ex rel. Beeler, Schad & Diamond v. Burlington Coat Factory\n\nWarehouse, 369 Ill. App. 3d 507, 860 N.E.2d 423 (2006), which is a case factually similar to the\n\ninstant case. This court in Beeler, Schad & Diamond, relying on Schahitti, concluded that the\n\nAttorney General retains almost complete control over qui tam proceedings. Beeler, Schad &\n\nDiamond, 369 Ill. App. 3d at 515, 860 N.E.2d at 429. Accordingly, we too hold that the Act\n\ndoes not usurp the Attorney General’s powers and is constitutional.\n\n\n\n                                            Question 6(b)\n\n        Finally, we turn to the last certified question and answer this question that the Act does\n\nnot violate the Attorney General clause and the executive compensation clause of the Illinois\n\nConstitution, article V, sections 15 and 21. Section 15 of the Illinois Constitution provides that\n\n\"[t]he Attorney General shall be the legal officer of the State, and shall have the duties and\n\npowers that may be prescribed by law.\" Ill. Const. 1970, art. V, §15. The executive\n\ncompensation clause of the Illinois Constitution states, in pertinent part: “Officers of the\n\nExecutive Branch shall be paid salaries established by law and shall receive no other\n\n                                                  29\n\f1-05-1059\n\ncompensation for their services.” Ill. Const. 1970, art. V, §21. Defendants contend that the Act\n\ncannot be used as a tax assessment and collection mechanism because the Attorney General\n\nclause and the executive compensation clause preclude payment to private attorneys for the\n\ncollection of tax monies on behalf of the State. Saltiel v. Olsen, 85 Ill. 2d 484, 493-94, 426\n\nN.E.2d 1204, 1209 (1981). Defendants claim that the relator is acting as a private attorney in the\n\ncollection of tax money owed to the State pursuant to the Act and, thus, cannot receive\n\ncompensation for those services under the Illinois Constitution.\n\n        Defendants rely on Saltiel, where the Illinois Attorney General protested the payment of\n\nfees to plaintiffs in a matter involving a challenge to the constitutionality of a real estate transfer\n\ntax. The Illinois Supreme Court in Saltiel concluded that the executive compensation clause was\n\nnot violated because the Attorney General did not hire the attorneys that represented the\n\nplaintiffs in the litigation. Saltiel, 85 Ill. 2d at 493-94, 426 N.E.2d at 1209. The attorneys in\n\nSaltiel were paid from a common fund, which contained State tax revenues, that was created\n\nfrom successfully invalidating a tax. Saltiel, 85 Ill. 2d at 491, 493-94, 426 N.E.2d at 1207.\n\nDefendants contend that even though the attorneys are not salaried employees in the instant case,\n\npublic tax monies are being spent to support private attorneys’ litigation associated with the\n\ncollection of monies owed to the State and the State would be obligated to pay the relator a\n\npercentage of the tax money recovered under the proceedings. Thus, defendants maintain that\n\ntax claims brought under the Act violate the Attorney General and executive compensation\n\nclauses of the Illinois Constitution because private attorneys are receiving compensation from\n\nthe State for duties belonging to the Attorney General.\n\n\n\n                                                  30\n\f1-05-1059\n\n        In response, the State claims that the Act is an antifraud statute and not a tax collection\n\nstatute, and fees relators receive are from the litigation’s proceeds as a reward for detecting fraud\n\nupon the State. The State also claims that the executive compensation clause is not violated\n\nbecause fees paid from a common fund are not fees paid by the State. Thus, no violation of the\n\nexecutive compensation clause exists.\n\n        In our view, the Act does not violate the Attorney General clause and the executive\n\ncompensation clause of the Illinois Constitution. Resources spent in litigating a matter brought\n\nin conjunction with qui tam proceedings cannot be equated with the State expending money to a\n\nprivate attorney. The State correctly notes that the Act is an antifraud act and not a tax collection\n\nact, and, thus, the money a relator receives upon a successful litigation of a claim brought under\n\nthe Act should not be equated with compensation paid to attorneys for services rendered. We\n\nnote that the proceedings in the instant case and in Saltiel addressed tax matters. Albeit in\n\nSaltiel, the issue addressed related to the constitutionality of a tax and here the issue relates to\n\nthe alleged nonpayment of use tax. This factual distinction does not render the instant matter in\n\nviolation of the Illinois Constitution. Moreover, the fees paid by the State to the relator are a\n\npercentage of the fees collected relating to the falsely filed records and do not relate directly to\n\nthe collection of taxes. Thus, we do not believe that the Act violates either the Attorney General\n\nClause or the executive compensation clause of the Illinois Constitution.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  31\n\f1-05-1059\n\n                                        CONCLUSION\n\n      In light of the above, the certified questions are answered as follows:\n\n\n\n             Question 1\n\n             No, a remote retailer cannot make a \"knowingly\" false record or statement to\n\n             create liability under the Act if the retailer discloses that no use tax is due or\n\n             collected based on the taxpayer's reasonable interpretation of the law.\n\n             Question 2\n\n             (a) Yes, the Act under the facts of the instant case requires the existence of an\n\n             actual record or statement.\n\n             (b) No, documents memorializing a purchase that discloses that no use tax is\n\n             being collected cannot be considered false sufficient to create liability under the\n\n             Act.\n\n             (c) No, under the Act, a false record or statement does not have to be submitted\n\n             to or directly relied upon by the State.\n\n             Question 3\n\n             No, claims brought under the Act do not deprive defendants of rights and\n\n             privileges such that the Act cannot be used to enforce the collection of taxes due\n\n             the State based on false records and statements because litigants are afforded the\n\n             protections provided to all litigants in civil proceedings.\n\n\n\n\n                                                32\n\f1-05-1059\n\n             Question 4\n\n             No, the Illinois Department of Revenue is not the sole entity authorized by the\n\n             Illinois General Assembly to assess and collect use tax when defendants create\n\n             fraudulent records and statements relating to taxes due to the State.\n\n             Question 5\n\n             Yes, the Act applies to alleged tax liabilities under the Use Tax Act when\n\n             fraudulent records and statements exists.\n\n             Question 6\n\n             (a) No, the Act does not violate the Attorney General clause of the Illinois\n\n             Constitution by improperly usurping the Attorney General's exclusive authority to\n\n             initiate and conduct litigation on the State's behalf because in qui tam\n\n             proceedings, the Attorney General still maintains control over the proceedings.\n\n             (b) No, the Act does not violate the Attorney General clause or the executive\n\n             compensation clause of the Illinois Constitution because the relator that files a\n\n             claim on behalf of the State is not directly paid by the State for services rendered.\n\n\n\n      Certified questions answered; cause remanded.\n\n      FITZGERALD SMITH, P.J., and O'MARA FROSSARD, J., concur.\n\n\n\n\n                                              33\n\f",

(West 2002)), filed by Beeler Shad &\n\nDiamond as a relator on behalf of the State of Illinois. The underlying claim relates to\n\ndefendants’ sale of goods over the internet and/or through catalogs into Illinois and defendants'\n\nalleged failure to collect and remit use tax relating to these sales.1 The trial court certified the\n\nfollowing questions for interlocutory review:\n\n\n\n        Question 1\n\n        \"As a matter of law, if a remote retailer does not collect and remit use tax on sales to\n\nIllinois customers, can it make a 'knowingly' false record or statement, as required to create\n\nliability under the Illinois Whistleblower Reward and Protection Act, 740 ILCS 175/1?\"\n\n        Question 2\n\n        \"(a) As a matter of law, does the Whistleblower Act require the existence of an actual\n\nrecord or statement to support a claim or can the failure to keep a record be actionable?\n\n        (b) As a matter of law, can documents memorializing a purchase (i.e. invoices or packing\n\nreceipts) that show in the line item for tax '$0.0' or in some other way that tax is not being\n\ncollected be considered 'false' under the Whistleblower Act where the retailer that created those\n\ndocuments does not collect tax?\n\n\n\n        1\n            This court granted a motion to withdraw from the appeal filed by Pfaltzgraff Co.,\n\nMaidenform, Inc., Toy's R Us and PETsMART.\n                                                   3\n\f1-05-1059\n\n       (c) Under the Whistleblower Act, as a matter of law, is it necessary that a false statement\n\nbe submitted to or actually relied upon by the State?\"\n\n       Question 3\n\n       \"Does the application of the general provisions of the Whistleblower Reward and\n\nProtection Act, 740 ILCS 175/1, to enforce the sales and use tax laws improperly deprive\n\ntaxpayers of the specific rights and privileges afforded them under the Protest Monies Act (30\n\nILCS 230/1), the Taxpayer's Bill of Rights, 20 ILCS 2502/1, and/or the statutory administrative\n\nprocedures offered by the Illinois Department of Revenue, 35 ILCS 105/1; 35 ILCS 120/1, such\n\nthat the Whistleblower Reward and Protection Act cannot be used to enforce the collection of\n\ntaxes due the State?\"\n\n       Question 4\n\n       \"Is the Illinois Department of Revenue the sole entity authorized by the Illinois General\n\nAssembly to assess and collect use tax?\"\n\n       Question 5\n\n       \"Does the Illinois Whistleblower Reward and Protection Act, 740 ILCS 175/1, apply to\n\nalleged tax liabilities under the Use Tax Act?\"\n\n       Question 6\n\n       \"(a) Does the Illinois Whistleblower Reward and Protection Act, 740 ILCS 175/1, violate\n\nthe Attorney General clause of the Illinois Constitution, Article V, Section 15, by improperly\n\nusurping the exclusive authority of the Attorney General to initiate and conduct litigation on\n\nbehalf of the State?\n\n\n\n                                                  4\n\f1-05-1059\n\n        (b) Does the Illinois Whistleblower Reward and Protection Act, 740 ILCS 175/1, as\n\napplied to tax matters, violate either the Attorney General clause or the Executive Compensation\n\nclause of the Illinois Constitution, Article V, Sections 15 and 21?\"\n\n        This court denied defendants' Rule 308 petition; however, the Illinois Supreme Court\n\npursuant to its supervisory authority directed this court to answer the above certified questions,\n\nwhich we now do in this appeal.\n\n\n\n                                          BACKGROUND\n\n        The following facts are relevant to answering the certified questions raised on appeal.\n\nThe law firm of Beeler, Schad & Diamond filed a complaint alleging that the defendant retailers'\n\nrecords, returns and statements that claimed no use tax was due on their sales to Illinois\n\nconsumers were knowingly false within the meaning of the Act. Beeler, Schad & Diamond filed\n\nthis complaint on behalf of the State of Illinois as a relator. The complaint alleged that\n\n\"defendants are retailers whose out-of-state operations made sales to Illinois residents over the\n\nInternet and/or through catalogs and defendants failed to collect and remit use tax on these\n\nsales.\" The complaint also alleged that each of defendants' Web sites, retailers' records, returns\n\nand statements that claimed no use tax due on its sales to Illinois customers was knowingly false\n\nwithin the meaning of the Act.\n\n        Beeler, Schad & Diamond also filed a similar complaint in Nevada. In the Nevada case,\n\nthe Nevada Supreme Court addressed the false claims actions brought by Beeler, Schad &\n\nDiamond relating to allegations of falsified tax liabilities associated with the retailers' Internet\n\nand/or catalog sales.

The Attorney General in\n\nthe Nevada case intervened and moved to dismiss the case. International Game Technology,\n\nInc., 122 Nev. at ____, 127 P.3d at 1096. The Nevada Supreme Court affirmed the trial court's\n\ndismissal of the case. International Game Technology, 122 Nev. at ___, 127 P.3d at 1108. The\n\nNevada court held that false claims actions incorporating the state's revenue statutes were not\n\nnecessarily excluded as claims appropriately brought under the Nevada false claims act, but the\n\nAttorney General had articulated a legitimate government purpose for intervening and\n\ndismissing the complaint, asserting that the entity entrusted to maintain consistency and\n\nuniformity in the tax laws should resolve the issue. International Game Technology, 122 Nev. at\n\n___, 127 P.3d at 1108.\n\n       Here, the Attorney General intervened in the matter filed in the circuit court and\n\nprosecuted the matter on the State's behalf. In response to the complaint filed in Illinois,\n\ndefendants filed a joint motion to dismiss. The trial court denied defendants' joint motion to\n\ndismiss and also granted defendants' motion for an interlocutory appeal under Rule 308. This\n\ncourt denied defendants' Rule 308 petition for leave to appeal, and defendants appealed that\n\ndecision to the Illinois Supreme Court, which directed this court pursuant to its supervisory\n\nauthority to answer the certified questions.\n\n       Before addressing the certified questions, we deem it necessary to provide background\n\ninformation underlying the questions in the instant appeal. The act implicated in the instant\n\nmatter is the Illinois Whistleblower Reward and Protection Act (740 ILCS 175/1, et seq. (West\n\n2002)). The Act provides a provision relating to false claims. 740 ILCS 175/3 (West 2002).\n\nAccording to the false claims provision, a person presents a false claim when he \"knowingly\n\n                                                  6\n\f1-05-1059\n\nmakes, uses, or causes to be made or used, a false record or statement to conceal, avoid or\n\ndecrease an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the State.\" 740 ILCS 175/3(a)(7)\n\n(West 2002). The Illinois false claims provision defines \"knowing\" and \"knowingly\" as:\n\n               \"a person, with respect to information:\n\n                       (1) has actual knowledge of the information;\n\n                       (2) acts in deliberate ignorance of the truth or falsity of the information; or\n\n                       (3) acts in reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the information, and\n\n                       no proof of specific intent to defraud is required.\" 740 ILCS 175/3(b)\n\n                       (West 2002).\n\n       Alleged violations of the Act may be brought in a civil action commenced by the\n\nAttorney General or a private person, referred to as a \"relator,\" in the State's name in actions\n\nknown as qui tam actions. 740 ILCS 175/4(a), (b), (c) (West 2002). The State may intervene,\n\nproceed with the action and take over conduct of the action, or decline to intervene. 740 ILCS\n\n175/4(b)(4)(A), (B) (West 2002). If the State proceeds with an action commenced by the relator,\n\nthe relator receives a percentage of the proceeds from the successful disposition or settlement of\n\nthe claim. 740 ILCS 175/4(d) (West 2002).\n\n       The Act is modeled after the Federal False Claims Act (FCA) (31 U.S.C. §3729 et seq.\n\n(2000) and is an antifraud statute.

Defendants claim that whether they\n\nwere required to collect use tax is a disputed question of law and assuming arguendo that the\n\nalleged violations could be proved, the State could not prove that defendants had the requisite\n\n\"knowledge\" required under the Act. Defendants contend that, despite the trial court's decision\n\nthat a disputed legal question cannot, as a matter of law, be knowingly false, the trial court erred\n\nin its treatment of this decision by denying defendants' motion to dismiss. Defendants assert that\n\nsince the laws and regulations regarding nexus in Illinois are disputed and in a \"quagmire,\"\n\ncauses of action premised on nexus with Illinois cannot create a violation of the Act, which\n\nrequires a \"knowing\" fraud upon the State. 740 ILCS 175/3(a)(7) (West 2002).\n\n       The State responds that whether defendants acted with the requisite state of mind is a\n\nquestion of fact that cannot be resolved on a motion to dismiss. The State maintains that\n\nwhether defendants had a sufficient nexus with Illinois subjecting them to use tax depends on the\n\nquantity, nature and scope of their contacts with Illinois. The State similarly contends that the\n\ncomplaints alleged that defendants had sufficient contacts with Illinois to create a tax liability\n\nand that defendants knowingly made false statements that they did not owe use tax. As such, the\n\ntrial court properly denied the motion to dismiss.\n\n                                                  9\n\f1-05-1059\n\n       Under the circumstances of the instant case, the answer to this certified question is that a\n\nremote retailer cannot make a \"knowingly\" false record or statement sufficient to create liability\n\nunder the Act when the pertinent area of the law is unclear and specific factual analysis must be\n\ncompleted to determine if the retailers' use tax liability was correctly disclosed as $0. To prevail\n\nin a reverse false claims cause of action, proof is required: \"(1) that the defendant made, used, or\n\ncaused to be used a record or statement to conceal, avoid, or decrease an obligation to the United\n\nStates; (2) that the statement or record was false; (3) that the defendant knew that the statement\n\nor record was false; and (4) that the United States suffered damages as a result.” Wilkins ex rel.\n\nUnited States v.

Rather, . . . in order to recover under subsection (a)(7), the\n\nplaintiff must also prove that the false information, be it in the form of an affirmative statement\n\nor an omission, was knowingly submitted by the defendant to the United States Government for\n\nthe purpose of avoiding a debt or obligation to the government.\" Wilkins, 885 F.Supp. at 1064.\n\nWe find it necessary to draw upon the distinction between a material omission that was not\n\nrecorded as required on a document amounting to a deliberate concealment and the instance here\n\nwhere the alleged omission arose from an interpretation and analysis of an existing area of\n\nunsettled law.\n\n        We also note that the Illinois Department of Revenue's (Department) position regarding\n\nnexus determinations consistently rests upon an analysis of the facts specific to a taxpayer. Even\n\nthough the Department has created a general guideline to assist in making nexus determinations,\n\nwhether an entity has sufficient nexus in the State to impose a tax liability rests upon the specific\n\nfacts of the transaction. Illinois Department of Revenue General Information Letter, ST\n\n07-0063-GIL (June 12, 2007). Given the Department's consistent position that nexus\n\ndeterminations are a fact-specific inquiry and the myriad of considerations that must be\n\nundertaken to determine nexus based on the nature and extent of activities within the State, we\n\ncannot conclude that a retailer that does not collect and remit use tax, but does discloses that no\n\nuse tax was collected, can \"knowingly\" make a false record or statement necessary to create a\n\nliability under the Act.\n\n        We further note that dismissing a complaint that raises a question of fact has long been\n\nrejected in this state.

It is uncertain at this stage of the proceedings whether\n\ndefendants consulted with a tax professional or sought tax advice regarding their use tax\n\nobligations in Illinois, which would assist in determining whether defendants \"knowingly\"\n\nomitted collecting use tax in Illinois as defined by the FCA or if the failure to collect and remit\n\nuse tax was based on flawed reasoning or a difference in interpretation of disputed legal\n\nquestions. See United States v. Bourseau, No. 03-CV-907-BEN (WMC), slip op. at 13 (S.D.\n\nCal. September 29, 2006). As such, the trial court did not err in denying the motion to dismiss in\n\nlight of the necessary factual determinations that must be made regarding defendants’\n\nknowledge.\n\n\n\n                                           Question 2(a)\n\n       We answer this question by stating that the Act requires the existence of an actual record\n\nor statement; however, the failure to keep a record when required to do so may be actionable\n\nunder the Act given the proper factual scenario. Defendants assert that finding a \"false\n\nstatement\" requires a complaint to allege: (1) an actual \"record or statement\"; (2) that is \"false\";\n\nand (3) that was submitted to or relied upon by the State. Defendants contend that the alleged\n\nfalse statements here relate to the failure to create a record, and the absence of a record cannot\n\nviolate the Act. Defendants maintain that contrary to the trial court's finding, the failure to keep\n\nreports of tax owed does not constitute a false record.

Absent an actual record, defendants claim\n\nthat a violation of the Act cannot exist.\n\n       The State responds that the Act is an antifraud statute and, as such, the intentional\n\nconcealment of a material fact is the equivalent of a false statement of material fact. The State\n\nmaintains that under the Illinois tax statutes and regulations, a retailer who is required to collect\n\nuse tax must maintain records showing that he collected the tax \"in accordance with [86 Ill.\n\nAdm. Code §150.405] and that he states such tax separately to the purchaser from the selling\n\nprice of the tangible personal property which he is selling.\" 86 Ill. Adm. Code §150.1305(a)\n\n(amended and eff. August 21, 1974). The State claims that the complaint adequately stated that\n\ndefendants did not prepare and maintain records showing that they collected the required taxes,\n\nomitted from their verified returns the use tax liability incurred on retail sales over the Internet,\n\nand failed to remit to the State the full amount of their use tax liability. The State asserts that\n\ndefendants' failure to maintain records and to make disclosures to the State when required to do\n\nso, as well as withholding information when making those disclosures, is the equivalent of\n\ncreating a false record for purposes of the Act.\n\n       The State relies on United States ex rel.

The State asserts that defendants' documents falsely represented that no use tax was due\n\nand not that it was passing its legal obligation to collect and remit the use tax to its customers.\n\n       We answer certified question 2(a) in the affirmative. To state a claim under the Act, the\n\nalleged violation must be based on a false statement or document. We restrict our answer to stay\n\nwithin the limited scope of concluding that an actual document must exist; however, we do not\n\nexpress an opinion as to whether concealment of or omission of material information from\n\ndocuments or records is sufficient to state a claim because such an inquiry is outside the scope of\n\nthe certified question.

We note that unlike the record in Pickens, in which a material\n\nevent was omitted from the record, the record in the instant case provides for and includes a\n\nseparate line item reflecting that the use tax collected relating to the specific purchase was $0.\n\nThus, in the instant case, defendants disclosed the pertinent information, but whether that\n\ninformation was accurately disclosed is for the trial court to determine on the evidence\n\npresented.

We must emphasize that our inquiry here is not\n\nto determine whether a knowingly false statement is required, which is the subject of the first\n\ncertified question but, instead, whether a statement that is factually true can be deemed false for\n\npurposes of bringing a claim under the Act. Neither party here disputes that no use tax was\n\ncollected or that the invoices rendered to the purchasers reflected that no use tax was collected or\n\ndue.

Defendants assert that the Act requires an\n\nallegedly false statement or record to be submitted to or actually relied upon by the State to\n\nconstitute a violation of the Act.\n\n        The State responds that documents are considered submitted to the State for purposes of\n\nthe Act if the State potentially may rely upon the documents. The State claims that the invoices,\n\norder confirmations, and sales receipts that defendants distribute to retail purchasers are the same\n\nrecords that the State relies on to determine defendants' tax burden and regulatory compliance\n\nand direct submission to the State is not necessary. 35 ILCS 105/11 (West 2004); 35 ILCS 120/7\n\n(West 2004); 86 Ill.

The State\n\nmaintains that it is sufficient that the State could have seen and relied upon the documents as part\n\nof its regular operations to satisfy this element.\n\n        The answer to this certified question is that a document is not required to be submitted to\n\nor directly relied upon by the government to violate the Act. We note that the State relies upon\n\nUnited States ex rel. Bahrani v.

The issue addressed in Bahrani was whether export certificates\n\npresented only to foreign governments could satisfy the false representation or presentment\n\nrequirement of a reverse false claims violation. Bahrani, 465 F.3d at 1206. The Bahrani court\n\nconcluded that according to the plain language of the reverse false claims statute, presentment of\n\ndocuments to the government is not required. Bahrani, 465 F.3d at 1207; see also United States\n\nex rel. Koch v.

In reaching this\n\nconclusion, the Bahrani court considered the reverse false claims language in comparison to\n\n                                                     19\n\f1-05-1059\n\nother sections of the false claims statute which, unlike the reverse false claims provision,\n\nexpressly require presentment to the government. Bahrani, 465 F.3d at 1207. Here, similar to\n\nthe presentment claim in Bahrani, the documents at issue were not presented directly to the\n\ngovernment, but were instead given directly to customers. Finding Bahrani persuasive, we also\n\nconclude that actual presentment to and reliance on allegedly false documents by the government\n\nis not required. See also Koch, 57 F.Supp. 2d at 1144 (noting that the bad act in reverse false\n\nclaims \"is the making or using of a false statement or record.\")\n\n\n\n                                             Question 3\n\n       Next, we address whether the Act is a proper vehicle for the collection of sales and use\n\ntax. Our analysis first begins with whether claims brought under the Act afford taxpayers the\n\nsame protections afforded to claims brought under the tax laws. Defendants contend that the\n\nsales and use tax laws and the Act are not equivalent and allowing the claims to proceed as\n\nwhistleblower claims denies defendants due process safeguards and creates a conflict with the\n\nState's tax laws. Defendants maintain that the tax statutes provide rights and protections against\n\n\"unlawful exactions\" that are not provided for under the Act, thereby creating a conflict between\n\nthe two statutes. Defendants claim that the trial court erroneously concluded that the tax statutes\n\nand the Act are functionally equivalent in that they both seek collection of taxes. Defendants,\n\nciting Humphrey, 189 F.Supp. 2d at 866-67, and United States ex rel. Gross v. AIDS Research\n\nAlliance-Chicago, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"791053\"><a href=\"/opinion/791053/united-states-ex-rel-sanford-gross-v-aids-research-alliance-chicago/\"><span class=\"volume\">415</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">601</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th Cir. 2005), contend that the Act exists to prevent fraud\n\nagainst the State and to shield from retribution those who uncover wrongdoing, but does not\n\nexist to collect taxes. Alternatively, defendants contend that the tax statutes exist to ensure the\n\n                                                 20\n\f1-05-1059\n\ndetermination, assessment and collection of \"tax properly due the State\" by the Department.\n\nThus, defendants assert that a conflict between the Act and tax statutes exists, precluding the\n\nfiling of tax claims under the Act. In response, the State contends that defendants are afforded\n\nprotections provided to litigants in civil suits and, unlike alleged tax violations, do not bear the\n\nburden of proof associated with tax deficiencies. Thus, the State claims that due process rights\n\nare not sacrificed when tax-related claims are brought under the Act.\n\n       We agree that the Illinois tax statutes are not identical to the Act, but we cannot reach the\n\ndefinitive conclusion that tax claims can never be brought under the Act on the basis that the Act\n\ndoes not provide the same safeguards and protections provided for under the tax laws. The State\n\ncorrectly notes the distinguishing feature of claims brought under the Act is that these actions are\n\ncivil in nature and afford defendants the protections innate in all civil cause of actions, in\n\ncontrast to claims brought under the tax statutes, which afford defendants an opportunity to\n\ndispute and settle assessed tax deficiencies.\n\n       We have considered defendants’ claims that despite the protections afforded to\n\ndefendants under civil causes of action, these protections are not the same, specific protections\n\nafforded to defendants under the tax laws. We must keep in mind, however, the nature of the\n\nallegations at issue in the instant case. The nature of the claims here relates to defendants’\n\nalleged fraudulent failure to collect and remit use tax. Defendants contend that it is improper to\n\nbring claims under the Act when the Department has not yet assessed or determined any tax\n\nliability relating to the claim of failing to pay use tax. Defendants correctly detail the\n\nadministrative process afforded to taxpayers when a dispute regarding an alleged failure to pay\n\ntaxes arises. See 35 ILCS 105/12 (West 2004); 35 ILCS 120/12 (West 2004). However, the\n\n                                                  21\n\f1-05-1059\n\nspecific inquiry and determination that must be made under the Act is whether defendants acted\n\nknowingly in failing to pay use tax liabilities. The inquiry and dispute at issue here is not the\n\ndetermination and disagreement over the amount of tax assessed, but whether defendants acted\n\nwith the requisite fraudulent intent and knowledge. In light of the nature of the claim and its\n\ncharacterization as a civil cause of action, we cannot hold that the Act can never be used to\n\nenforce the collection of taxes due to the State because it deprives defendants of due process\n\nprotections. See 740 ILCS 175/4 (West 2002). It is also worthy to note that the Act does not\n\nseek to impose and collect a tax, but instead seeks to penalize actions that deprive the\n\ngovernment of funds rightfully owed to it regardless of the nature of the underlying transaction\n\ngiving rise to the claim.\n\n\n\n                                             Question 4\n\n       The answer to this question is that the Department is not the sole entity authorized to\n\nassess and collect use tax when evidence of a defendant knowingly generating a false record or\n\nstatement to avoid payment of tax exists. Defendants contend that the Department has exclusive\n\nauthority to assess and collect use tax based on a statutory grant of authority; and as such, claims\n\nfiled to collect taxes cannot be brought under the Act.

The Nevada\n\nSupreme Court did not conclude that claims are precluded from being brought under the state's\n\nfalse claims act. See International Game Technology, Inc., 122 Nev. at ___, 127 P.3d at 1105.\n\nRather, the Nevada Supreme Court noted that the state's revenue statutes do not provide the tax\n\ncommission with exclusive jurisdiction over tax matters and, thus, tax matters may fall under the\n\nFCA's scope even if they arise out of allegations based on money owed under the revenue\n\nstatutes. International Game Technology, Inc., 122 Nev. at ___, 127 P.3d at 1104. The Nevada\n\nSupreme Court did continue to hold, however, that determinations requiring an analysis of sales\n\nand use tax statutes are \"determinations better left to the tax department in order to promote\n\nconsistency and uniformity.\" International Game Technology, Inc., 122 Nev. at ___, 127 P.3d at\n\n1108.\n\n        Similarly, this court in Village of Lisle, acknowledged that where an administrative\n\n\"agency’s technical expertise would help resolve the controversy, or when there is a need for\n\nuniform administrative standards,\" authority to resolve the dispute should be relinquished to the\n\n                                                  24\n\f1-05-1059\n\nadministrative agency. Village of Lisle, 352 Ill. App. 3d at 853, 817 N.E.2d at 167. In the\n\nVillage of Lisle case, at issue was whether the defendant was filing false reports to the\n\nDepartment for sales tax purposes. Village of Lisle, 352 Ill. App. 3d at 855, 817 N.E.2d at 168.\n\nThis court in Village of Lisle held that since little interpretation of the tax laws was required to\n\ndetermine the defendant's proper site for sales-tax purposes and the trial court was only required\n\nto make a finding of fact whether the defendant was misrepresenting that site, resolution of those\n\nissues did not require the Department’s technical expertise and the trial court could properly\n\nresolve the issues. Village of Lisle, 352 Ill. App. 3d at 855, 817 N.E.2d at 168-69.

Thus, we deem\n\nthe rationale set forth in the Village of Lisle to also be applicable to use tax. Accordingly, the\n\nDepartment is not the sole entity authorized to handle tax-related claims relating to the\n\nassessment and collection of use tax.\n\n       We believe it is important to draw a distinction that is not fully drawn by defendants.\n\nThis appeal is not seeking to assess and collect tax on defendants, which defendants contend is\n\nwithin the exclusive jurisdiction of the Department. If this were the situation, then the\n\nDepartment would conduct an audit of defendants' records and impose any deficient taxes on\n\ndefendants. Rather, the underlying claim in the instant case is that defendants knowingly failed\n\n                                                  25\n\f1-05-1059\n\nto remit use tax to the State as defined by the Act and falsified documents. The nature of these\n\nallegations exceeds a claim for a tax deficiency, which would fall within the purview of the\n\nDepartment's powers to assess and collect use taxes. Instead, the allegations here relate to the\n\nintent underlying defendants' alleged creation of false records and statements, which is an area\n\nthat does not require the Department's specialized knowledge and is an area that the Attorney\n\nGeneral is more than competent to address. Accordingly, based on the nature of the claims\n\nraised in the instant case, the Department is not the sole entity authorized to assess and collect\n\nuse tax when allegations of false records and statements exists.\n\n\n\n                                             Question 5\n\n       Our answer to this certified question is that alleged use tax claims relating to Internet\n\nand/or catalog sales may be brought under the Act. Defendants point to the FCA’s language,\n\nwhich the Illinois Act was patterned after, that expressly excludes all tax matters under the\n\nInternal Revenue Code from falling within the purview of the FCA. Defendants maintain that\n\nthe Act’s express language that states it does not apply to the Illinois Income Tax Act (35 ILCS\n\n5/101 et seq. (West 2004) should be extended to also exclude the Use Tax Act. Defendants\n\ncontend that the Illinois legislature contemplated that not all Illinois taxes are incorporated in the\n\nIllinois Income Tax Act when it replaced the phrase “Internal Revenue Code” with “Illinois\n\nIncome Tax Act” in adopting the FCA. Thus, defendants assert that the Act does not apply to\n\nthe Use Tax Act.\n\n       The State responds that the Act does not exclude claims to enforce use tax obligations.\n\nThe State notes that the Act expressly states that it \"does not apply to claims, records, or\n\n                                                  26\n\f1-05-1059\n\nstatements made under the Illinois Income Tax Act.\" 740 ILCS 175/3(d) (West 2002). The\n\nState notes that in drafting the Act, the General Assembly included income tax claims, but did\n\nnot include use tax claims, which indicates the General Assembly's intent to exclude use tax\n\nclaims as falling under the Act's scope.

The legislature is entrusted with the\n\npower to enact the laws of the State of Illinois, including tax laws, and to raise revenue for this\n\nState. We must reject defendants’ contention that the legislature was unaware that a separate\n\ntaxing scheme apart from the income taxes of the State exists when it adopted the FCA and\n\noverlooked expressly excluding those taxes from the Act. The fundamental rule of statutory\n\nconstruction is to determine and give effect to the intent of the legislature, and the statutory\n\nlanguage is the best indicator of the legislature’s intent.

The Illinois FCA, which is a provision within the Act, expressly states that\n\n“this section does not apply to claims, records, or statements made under the Illinois Income Tax\n\nAct.” 740 ILCS 175/4 (West 2002). Accordingly, under the plain language of the Act, we\n\nconclude that use tax claims may be brought under the Act.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  27\n\f1-05-1059\n\n                                            Question 6(a)\n\n       Our answer to this certified question is that the Act is constitutional and does not\n\nimproperly usurp the exclusive authority of the Attorney General to initiate and conduct\n\nlitigation on behalf of the State. Defendants claim that the Act's provisions directly conflict with\n\nthe Attorney General's \"exclusive constitutional power and prerogative to conduct the state's\n\nlegal affairs.\" (Emphasis in original.)

Defendants claim that as a result of the relator’s involvement in the proceedings, it\n\nwould be nearly impossible to identify and segregate the Attorney General’s independent role in\n\nthe litigation. Thus, the Act usurps the Attorney General's powers.\n\n       In response, the State contends that the Illinois Supreme Court previously rejected this\n\nsame contention in Scachitti v. UBS Financial Services, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2233371\"><a href=\"/opinion/2233371/scachitti-v-ubs-financial-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">215</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">484</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2233371\"><a href=\"/opinion/2233371/scachitti-v-ubs-financial-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">831</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">544</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2005).\n\nThe State claims that in Schachitti, the Illinois Supreme Court held that the Act was not\n\nunconstitutional because the Attorney General retains the authority to control the litigation at\n\nevery stage of the proceedings. Scachitti, 215 Ill. 2d at 511, 831 N.E.2d at 560. Thus, following\n\nSchachitti, the State maintains that the Act is constitutional.\n\n       We agree with the State that the Act is constitutional. We rely on our state supreme\n\ncourt's decision in Scachitti. In Scachitti, the Illinois Supreme Court addressed whether the Act\n\nusurped the Attorney General's constitutional powers to represent the State. Scachitti, 215 Ill. 2d\n\nat 509, 831 N.E.2d at 559. The supreme court answered the question in the negative. Scachitti,\n\n215 Ill. 2d at 510, 831 N.E.2d at 559. The supreme court reasoned that the Attorney General\n\nretains the authority to control the litigation whereas the qui tam plaintiffs may conduct the\n\nlitigation on the State's behalf. Scachitti, 215 Ill. 2d at 510, 831 N.E.2d at 560. Retaining this\n\n                                                  28\n\f1-05-1059\n\ncontrol, the supreme court concluded, precludes a finding that the Act usurps the Attorney\n\nGeneral's constitutional power. Scachitti, 215 Ill. 2d at 513, 831 N.E.2d at 561. The supreme\n\ncourt further held that \"the qui tam provision of the Act is a 'constitutional statute,' as it does not\n\nusurp the Attorney General's constitutional power to conduct the legal affairs of the state when\n\nthe state is a real party in interest.\" Scachitti, 215 Ill. 2d at 515, 831 N.E.2d at 562. In light of\n\nthe Illinois Supreme Court's definitive conclusion that the Act does not usurp the Attorney\n\nGeneral's constitutional powers, we are not in a position to conclude otherwise. We further rely\n\non this court's decision in State ex rel. Beeler, Schad & Diamond v. Burlington Coat Factory\n\nWarehouse, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">369</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill.

This court in Beeler, Schad & Diamond, relying on Schahitti, concluded that the\n\nAttorney General retains almost complete control over qui tam proceedings. Beeler, Schad &\n\nDiamond, 369 Ill. App. 3d at 515, 860 N.E.2d at 429. Accordingly, we too hold that the Act\n\ndoes not usurp the Attorney General’s powers and is constitutional.\n\n\n\n                                            Question 6(b)\n\n        Finally, we turn to the last certified question and answer this question that the Act does\n\nnot violate the Attorney General clause and the executive compensation clause of the Illinois\n\nConstitution, article V, sections 15 and 21. Section 15 of the Illinois Constitution provides that\n\n\"[t]he Attorney General shall be the legal officer of the State, and shall have the duties and\n\npowers that may be prescribed by law.\" Ill. Const. 1970, art. V, §15. The executive\n\ncompensation clause of the Illinois Constitution states, in pertinent part: “Officers of the\n\nExecutive Branch shall be paid salaries established by law and shall receive no other\n\n                                                  29\n\f1-05-1059\n\ncompensation for their services.” Ill. Const. 1970, art. V, §21. Defendants contend that the Act\n\ncannot be used as a tax assessment and collection mechanism because the Attorney General\n\nclause and the executive compensation clause preclude payment to private attorneys for the\n\ncollection of tax monies on behalf of the State. Saltiel v. Olsen, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">484</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 493-94, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">426</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1204</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1209 (1981). Defendants claim that the relator is acting as a private attorney in the\n\ncollection of tax money owed to the State pursuant to the Act and, thus, cannot receive\n\ncompensation for those services under the Illinois Constitution.\n\n        Defendants rely on Saltiel, where the Illinois Attorney General protested the payment of\n\nfees to plaintiffs in a matter involving a challenge to the constitutionality of a real estate transfer\n\ntax. The Illinois Supreme Court in Saltiel concluded that the executive compensation clause was\n\nnot violated because the Attorney General did not hire the attorneys that represented the\n\nplaintiffs in the litigation. Saltiel, 85 Ill. 2d at 493-94, 426 N.E.2d at 1209. The attorneys in\n\nSaltiel were paid from a common fund, which contained State tax revenues, that was created\n\nfrom successfully invalidating a tax. Saltiel, 85 Ill. 2d at 491, 493-94, 426 N.E.2d at 1207.\n\nDefendants contend that even though the attorneys are not salaried employees in the instant case,\n\npublic tax monies are being spent to support private attorneys’ litigation associated with the\n\ncollection of monies owed to the State and the State would be obligated to pay the relator a\n\npercentage of the tax money recovered under the proceedings. Thus, defendants maintain that\n\ntax claims brought under the Act violate the Attorney General and executive compensation\n\nclauses of the Illinois Constitution because private attorneys are receiving compensation from\n\nthe State for duties belonging to the Attorney General.\n\n\n\n                                                  30\n\f1-05-1059\n\n        In response, the State claims that the Act is an antifraud statute and not a tax collection\n\nstatute, and fees relators receive are from the litigation’s proceeds as a reward for detecting fraud\n\nupon the State. The State also claims that the executive compensation clause is not violated\n\nbecause fees paid from a common fund are not fees paid by the State. Thus, no violation of the\n\nexecutive compensation clause exists.\n\n        In our view, the Act does not violate the Attorney General clause and the executive\n\ncompensation clause of the Illinois Constitution. Resources spent in litigating a matter brought\n\nin conjunction with qui tam proceedings cannot be equated with the State expending money to a\n\nprivate attorney. The State correctly notes that the Act is an antifraud act and not a tax collection\n\nact, and, thus, the money a relator receives upon a successful litigation of a claim brought under\n\nthe Act should not be equated with compensation paid to attorneys for services rendered. We\n\nnote that the proceedings in the instant case and in Saltiel addressed tax matters. Albeit in\n\nSaltiel, the issue addressed related to the constitutionality of a tax and here the issue relates to\n\nthe alleged nonpayment of use tax. This factual distinction does not render the instant matter in\n\nviolation of the Illinois Constitution. Moreover, the fees paid by the State to the relator are a\n\npercentage of the fees collected relating to the falsely filed records and do not relate directly to\n\nthe collection of taxes. Thus, we do not believe that the Act violates either the Attorney General\n\nClause or the executive compensation clause of the Illinois Constitution.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  31\n\f1-05-1059\n\n                                        CONCLUSION\n\n      In light of the above, the certified questions are answered as follows:\n\n\n\n             Question 1\n\n             No, a remote retailer cannot make a \"knowingly\" false record or statement to\n\n             create liability under the Act if the retailer discloses that no use tax is due or\n\n             collected based on the taxpayer's reasonable interpretation of the law.\n\n             Question 2\n\n             (a) Yes, the Act under the facts of the instant case requires the existence of an\n\n             actual record or statement.\n\n             (b) No, documents memorializing a purchase that discloses that no use tax is\n\n             being collected cannot be considered false sufficient to create liability under the\n\n             Act.\n\n             (c) No, under the Act, a false record or statement does not have to be submitted\n\n             to or directly relied upon by the State.\n\n             Question 3\n\n             No, claims brought under the Act do not deprive defendants of rights and\n\n             privileges such that the Act cannot be used to enforce the collection of taxes due\n\n             the State based on false records and statements because litigants are afforded the\n\n             protections provided to all litigants in civil proceedings.\n\n\n\n\n                                                32\n\f1-05-1059\n\n             Question 4\n\n             No, the Illinois Department of Revenue is not the sole entity authorized by the\n\n             Illinois General Assembly to assess and collect use tax when defendants create\n\n             fraudulent records and statements relating to taxes due to the State.\n\n             Question 5\n\n             Yes, the Act applies to alleged tax liabilities under the Use Tax Act when\n\n             fraudulent records and statements exists.\n\n             Question 6\n\n             (a) No, the Act does not violate the Attorney General clause of the Illinois\n\n             Constitution by improperly usurping the Attorney General's exclusive authority to\n\n             initiate and conduct litigation on the State's behalf because in qui tam\n\n             proceedings, the Attorney General still maintains control over the proceedings.\n\n             (b) No, the Act does not violate the Attorney General clause or the executive\n\n             compensation clause of the Illinois Constitution because the relator that files a\n\n             claim on behalf of the State is not directly paid by the State for services rendered.\n\n\n\n      Certified questions answered; cause remanded.\n\n      FITZGERALD SMITH, P.J., and O'MARA FROSSARD, J., concur.\n\n\n\n\n                                              33\n\f</pre>",
