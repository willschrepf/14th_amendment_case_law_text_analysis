Gen. Laws 3610, 3657 (Tex. Ins. Code Ann. art. 21.28-C, § 5(2),\r\nsince amended).<strong><sup> (1)</sup>  Appellants filed a proof of claim under the Act with appellee, Sandra A.\r\nAutry, the Receiver of National County Mutual Fire Insurance Company (\"the Receiver\"). \r\nThe Receiver rejected appellants' proof of claim because it did not indicate that either they or\r\nthe insured was a Texas resident, as required by the Act.  Appellants filed suit in district\r\ncourt, contending that their claim was wrongly denied and raising constitutional challenges to\r\nsection 5(2)'s residency requirement.  The district court granted the summary judgment motion\r\nof the Receiver.  Appellants renew their constitutional challenges before this Court.  We will\r\naffirm the judgment of the district court.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p></p><center><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></center>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\tOn July 22, 1988, appellants were injured when their car was struck by a truck\r\nin El Paso, Texas.  The driver of the truck was a Mexican resident.  The truck was insured by\r\nNational County Mutual Fire Insurance Company.  The insured was Transportes Union, a\r\nsyndicate of truck owners/drivers located in Juarez, Mexico.  Appellants judicially admit that\r\nat the time of the accident, they were not residents of Texas but residents of Juarez, Mexico.<strong><sup> (2)</sup></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tOn May 9, 1989, National County was ordered into permanent receivership. \r\nAppellants filed a proof of claim with the Receiver, seeking to recover benefits under the Act.<strong><sup> (3)</sup> \r\nThe Receiver rejected appellants' proof of claim, citing section 5(2)'s requirement that <em>either</em>\r\nthe third-party claimant, the liability claimant, or the insured be a Texas resident for the claim\r\nto be covered under the Act. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tAppellants filed suit in district court contending that the Receiver had wrongly\r\ndenied their claim.  Appellants later filed an amended petition, which sought a declaratory\r\njudgment that section 5(2) was unconstitutional to the extent that it distinguished between\r\nresidents and non-residents of Texas.  Appellants based their constitutional claims on \"the\r\nequal protection clause and the due process clause of the United States Constitution, as applied\r\nto state action through the Fourteenth Amendment, as well as related provisions of the\r\nConstitution of the State of Texas.\"  Appellants also contended that the resident/non-resident\r\ndistinction violated \"the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the United States Constitution.\" \r\nThe Receiver filed special exceptions to appellants' petition, to which appellants responded\r\nwith a supplemental petition that cited specific constitutional provisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe Receiver filed a motion for summary judgment, which the district court\r\ngranted.  Appellants raise two points of error, challenging section 5(2)'s distinction between\r\nresidents and non-residents based on the Privileges and Immunities Clause of article IV,\r\nsection 2 of the United States Constitution, and on the Equal Protection Clause of the\r\nFourteenth Amendment.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p></p><center><strong>ARTICLE 21.28-C OF THE INSURANCE CODE</strong></center>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe Act establishes a Guaranty Association consisting of all property and\r\ncasualty insurers licensed to transact insurance business in Texas.  Act §§ 5(2), 14.  The\r\npurpose of the Act is to provide additional protection to insureds and liability claimants of\r\n\"impaired\" insurance companies.<strong><sup> (4)</sup>  Act § 2; <em>Durish v. Channelview Bank</em>, 809 S.W.2d 273\r\n(Tex. App.--Austin 1991, writ denied).  The Association accomplishes this aim by maintaining\r\na Guaranty Fund with assessments from solvent member insurers.  Act § 7.  A Receiver of an\r\nimpaired insurer may use the fund to aid in paying \"covered claims\" when the impaired\r\ninsurer's assets are insufficient.  Act § 10.  Section 5(2) of the Act defines covered claims as\r\nfollows:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\"Covered claim\" is an unpaid claim of an insured or third party liability\r\nclaimant which arises out of and is within the coverage and not in excess of the\r\napplicable limits of an insurance policy to which this Act applies, issued or\r\nassumed (whereby an assumption certificate is issued to the insured) by an\r\ninsurer licensed to do business in this State, if such insurer becomes an\r\n\"impaired insurer\" after the effective date of this Act and <em>(a) the third party\r\nclaimant or liability claimant or insured is a resident of this State at the time of\r\nthe insured event;</em> or (b) the property from which the claim arises is\r\npermanently located in this State.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>Act § 5(2) (emphasis added).</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p></p><center><strong>PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES CLAUSE</strong></center>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\tIn their first point of error, appellants contend that section 5(2) \"directly\r\ncontravenes the privileges and immunities clause of the United States Constitution.\"  Although\r\nthe point of error is not specific, appellants' arguments and authorities rely upon the Privileges\r\nand Immunities Clause of article IV, section 2, of the United States Constitution.  U.S. Const.\r\nart. IV, § 2.<strong><sup> (5)</sup></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe Privileges and Immunities Clause of article IV, section 2 (hereinafter \"the\r\nClause\") states, \"The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of\r\nCitizens in the several States.\"  U.S. Const. art. IV, § 2.  The terms \"citizen\" and \"resident\"\r\nare essentially interchangeable for purposes of analysis under the Clause.  <em>Hicklin v. Orbeck</em>,\r\n437 U.S. 518, 524 n.8 (1978).  Therefore, since appellants are not residents of any state of the\r\nUnited States of America, but residents of Mexico, the Clause on its face would seem to afford\r\nthem no protection.  However, even if the Clause does provide protection for United States\r\ncitizens who are not residents of any state, section 5(2) does not violate appellants' rights\r\nunder the Clause.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe Clause prevents a state from discriminating against citizens of other states\r\nin favor of its own citizens.  <em>Hague v. Committee for Indus. Org.</em>, 307 U.S. 496, 511 (1939). \r\nThe Clause was included in the Constitution \"to help fuse into one Nation a collection of\r\nindependent sovereign States.  It was designed to insure to a citizen of State A who ventures\r\ninto State B the same privileges which the citizens of State B enjoy.\"  <em>Toomer v. Witsell</em>,  334\r\nU.S. 385, 395 (1948).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tHowever, like most constitutional provisions, the Clause \"is not an absolute.\" \r\n<em>Toomer</em>, 334 U.S. at 396; <em>Baldwin v. Fish &amp; Game Comm'n of Mont.</em>, 436 U.S. 371, 383\r\n(1977) (\"It has not been suggested, however, that state citizenship or residency may never be\r\nused by a State to distinguish among persons.\"); <em>Blake, Rogers, Brown &amp; Co. v. McClung</em>,\r\n172 U.S. 239, 256 (1898) (\"We must not be understood as saying that a citizen of one state is\r\nentitled to enjoy in another state <em>every</em> privilege that may be given in the latter to its own\r\ncitizens.\").  Legal distinctions between residents and non-residents reflect the fact that our\r\nnation is a collection of individual states.  <em>Baldwin</em>, 436 U.S. at 383.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tAs one commentator put it, \"There also appear to be some goods and services\r\nthat a state's citizens, having created or preserved for themselves, are entitled to keep for\r\nthemselves.\"  Laurence H. Tribe, <em>American Constitutional Law</em> 539 (2d ed. 1988).  For\r\nexample, states may charge non-resident students higher tuition rates than resident students,\r\n<em>Vlandis v. Kline</em>, 412 U.S. 441, 452-53 (1973), and charge non-residents disproportionately\r\nhigher fees for recreational hunting licenses, <em>Baldwin</em>, 436 U.S. at 388.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tAppellants cite two cases which they contend demonstrate that section 5(2)'s\r\nresidency distinction violates the Clause:  <em>Blake, Rogers, Brown &amp; Co. v. McClung</em>, 172 U.S.\r\n239 (1898); <em>Sully v. American Nat'l Bank</em>, 178 U.S. 289 (1900).  These cases, however,\r\ninvolved a different sort of preference for residents.  The statutes in both cases gave resident\r\ncreditors preference over non-resident creditors in obtaining a failed corporation's assets.  The\r\nCourt found the resident-creditor preferences unconstitutional, explaining that when the\r\nproperty of an insolvent private corporation is distributed, non-resident creditors are entitled\r\n\"to stand upon the same plane with creditors of like class who are citizens of such state, and\r\ncannot be denied equality of right simply because they do not reside in that state, but are\r\ncitizens residing in other states of the Union.\"  <em>Blake</em>, 172 U.S. at 258.  <em>Sully</em> followed the\r\nholding of <em>Blake</em>.  <em>Sully</em>, 178 U.S. at 299.  Therefore, under <em>Blake</em>, appellants would be\r\nentitled to pursue the <em>corporate</em> assets of National County with the same status as resident\r\ncreditors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tHowever, appellants are not seeking any of National County's corporate assets. \r\nRather, appellants are seeking to recover from the Guaranty Fund created by the Act.  In\r\n<em>Blake</em>, the Supreme Court specifically stated that distinctions between residents and non-residents in statutes like the Act <em>do not</em> violate the privileges and immunities clause:</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\tIt may be appropriate to observe that the objections to the statute of\r\nTennessee do not necessarily embrace enactments that are found in some of the\r\nstates requiring foreign insurance corporations, as a condition of their coming into\r\nthe state for purposes of business, to deposit with the state treasurer funds\r\nsufficient to secure policy holders in its midst.  Legislation of that character <em>does\r\nnot</em> present any question of discrimination against citizens forbidden by the\r\nConstitution.  <em>Insurance funds set apart in advance for the benefit of home policy\r\nholders of a foreign insurance company doing business in the state are a trust fund\r\nof a specific kind to be administered for the exclusive benefit of certain persons</em>. \r\nPolicy holders in other states know that those particular funds are segregated from\r\nthe mass of property owned by the company, and that they cannot look to them to\r\nthe prejudice of those for whose special benefit they were deposited.  The present\r\ncase is not one of that kind.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><em>McClung</em>, 172 U.S. at 257 (emphasis added).  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tWe conclude that section 5(2) does not violate the Clause.  The legislature created\r\nthe insurance fund for the benefit of citizens of Texas, and held it in trust for them.  It is the very\r\nsort of enactment that the Supreme Court distinguished as <em>constitutional</em> nearly one hundred years\r\nago in <em>Blake</em>.  The Supreme Court's decisions applying the Clause since do not indicate that such\r\na statute is any less constitutional today.  Appellants' first point of error is overruled.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p></p><center><strong>EQUAL PROTECTION</strong></center>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\tIn point of error two, appellants contend that section 5(2) contravenes the Equal\r\nProtection Clause of the United States Constitution.  First, appellants argue that section 5(2)\r\nviolates the Equal Protection Clause because it infringes on their constitutional right to travel,\r\nciting <em>Shapiro v. Thompson</em>, 394 U.S. 618 (1969), <em>Dunn v. Blumstein</em>, 405 U.S. 330 (1972), and\r\n<em>Zobel v. Williams</em>, 457 U.S. 55 (1982).  Appellants also contend that we should recognize\r\nnon-residents as a suspect class for purposes of equal protection analysis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe cases cited by appellants for the proposition that section 5(2) infringes on their\r\nconstitutional right to travel are all distinguishable; the cases concern <em>durational</em> residency\r\nrequirements.  In <em>Shapiro v. Thompson</em>, the Supreme Court held that laws denying welfare\r\nbenefits to residents who had resided in the state for less than one year violated the Equal\r\nProtection Clause, absent a compelling state interest.  <em>Shapiro</em>, 394 U.S. at 628.  The Court\r\nreasoned that the statute's purpose, to deter the migration of needy persons into the state, was not\r\na constitutionally permissible objective because it penalized those who had exercised their\r\nconstitutional right to travel.  <em>Id</em>. at 629-31.  <em>Dunn v. Blumstein</em> and <em>Zobel v. Williams</em> also struck\r\ndown laws that drew distinctions based on length of residence.  <em>Dunn</em>, 405 U.S. at 342\r\n(\"Durational residence laws impermissibly condition and penalize the right to travel by imposing\r\ntheir prohibitions on only those persons who have recently exercised that right.\"); <em>Zobel</em>, 457 U.S.\r\nat 65 (holding that favoring established residents over new residents was a constitutionally\r\nimpermissible justification for a statute).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tAdditionally, <em>Shapiro</em> and its progeny reason that durational residency requirements\r\nraise equal protection concerns because they divide a state's citizens into two classes.  In <em>Shapiro</em>,\r\nthe Court explained that a state may not accomplish an otherwise valid purpose \"by invidious\r\ndistinctions between classes of its citizens.\"  <em>Shapiro</em>, 394 U.S. at 633.  Similarly, in <em>Zobel</em>, the\r\nCourt struck down the Alaska statute because it \"creates fixed, permanent distinctions\" between\r\nclasses of its citizens based on the length of their residency.  <em>Zobel</em>, 457 U.S. at 59.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe Court has been careful in these cases to distinguish <em>durational</em> residency\r\nrequirements:  \"We emphasize again the difference between bona fide residence requirements and\r\ndurational residence requirements.\"  <em>Dunn</em>, 405 U.S. at 343.  The Supreme Court also has stated\r\nthat assuring that services provided for residents are enjoyed <em>only</em> by residents is a substantial state\r\ninterest.  <em>Martinez v. Bynum</em>, 461 U.S. 321, 328 (1983) (upholding state statute permitting school\r\ndistrict to deny tuition-free education to child living apart from parent or legal guardian if child\r\nin district \"for the primary purpose\" of attending school in the district).  Conditioning benefits on\r\nstate residency is presumptively permissible.  <em>Califano v. Torres</em>, 435 U.S. 1, 5 (1978).  Section\r\n5(2) is an example of a bona fide residency requirement and therefore does not infringe on\r\nappellants' right to travel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tWith regard to appellants' argument that non-residents should be recognized as a\r\nsuspect class, we note that the United States Supreme Court has been extremely hesitant in\r\nrecognizing additional suspect classes.  <em>See</em> <em>City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr</em>., 473 U.S.\r\n432 (1985) (holding that the lower court erred in treating mental retardation as a quasi-suspect\r\nclass); <em>Massachusetts Bd. of Retirement v. Murgia</em>, 427 U.S. 307, 313 (1976) (refusing to\r\nrecognize the elderly as a suspect class); <em>San Antonio Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Rodriguez</em>, 411 U.S.\r\n1 (1973) (refusing to recognize \"the poor\" as a suspect class).  We do not believe that non-residents are accurately characterized as a \"discrete and insular minority.\"  <em>United States v.\r\nCarolene Products Co.</em>, 304 U.S. 144, 152 n.4 (1938).<strong><sup> (6)</sup>  Accordingly, we decline to recognize\r\nnon-residents as a suspect class for purposes of equal protection analysis.  \t</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tBecause residency is not a suspect class and because section 5(2) does not infringe\r\non a fundamental right, the provision must bear only a rational relation to a legitimate government\r\ninterest to be valid under the Equal Protection Clause.  <em>Kadrmas v. Dickinson Pub. Sch.</em>, 487\r\nU.S. 450, 457-58 (1988); <em>Williamson v. Lee Optical</em>, 348 U.S. 483, 487-91 (1955).  In Texas,\r\nthe legislature has seen fit to set aside a specific fund to supplement Texas residents' recovery\r\nfrom the limited assets of insolvent insurance companies.  Protecting Texas residents from\r\nfinancial loss due to insurance company insolvencies is a legitimate state objective.  Because\r\nsection 5(2) is rationally related to achieving this objective, it does not violate the equal protection\r\nclause.  Appellants' second point of error is overruled. </p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p></p><center><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></center>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\tFinding no error, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t<span>                                                               \t\t\t\t</span>\tMack Kidd, Justice</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before Chief Justice Carroll, Justices Kidd and B.

However, we must apply\r\nthe version of the Act in effect at the date of the insurance company's impairment.  <em>See </em><em>Latter\r\nv. Autry</em>, 853 S.W.2d 836, 836 n.1 (Tex. App.--Austin 1993, no writ); <em>Durish v. Channelview\r\nBank</em>, 809 S.W.2d 273, 275-77 (Tex. App.--Austin 1991, writ denied).\r\n</p><p>2. <strong>     <sup>2</sup></strong>  The statement of Appellants' counsel in oral argument that appellants are United States\r\ncitizens was not disputed by the Receiver.\r\n</p><p>3. <strong>     <sup>3</sup></strong>  Appellants do not seek to recover the corporate assets of National County; this cause is\r\nlimited only to the Guaranty Fund.\r\n</p><p>4. <strong>     <sup>4</sup></strong>  An \"impaired insurer\" is a member insurer that has been placed in temporary or\r\npermanent receivership as a result of insolvency.  Act § 5(4).\r\n</p><p>5. <strong>     <sup>5</sup></strong>  The Receiver contends that appellants waived their challenge under article IV, section 2\r\nby referring only to \"The Privileges and Immunities Clause of the United States Constitution\"\r\nin their response to the Receiver's summary judgment motion.  There are two Privileges and\r\nImmunities Clauses in the United States Constitution: article IV, section 2, and the Privileges\r\nand Immunities Clause at section one of the Fourteenth Amendment, which prohibits states\r\nfrom making laws which would abridge \"the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United\r\nStates.\"  U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1.  Thus, Appellants' challenge to section 5(2) in their\r\nresponse was ambiguous.  However, the Receiver did not file special exceptions to Appellants'\r\nsummary judgment response, as the Receiver did to Appellants' first amended petition.  <em>See</em>\r\nTex. R. Civ. P. 91.  Accordingly, the Receiver cannot now complain on appeal of any\r\nambiguity in Appellants' response.\r\n</p><p>6. <strong>     <sup>6</sup></strong>  <em>Everyone</em> is a non-resident of some place.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>",

Gen. Laws 3610, 3657 (Tex. Ins. Code Ann. art. 21.28-C, § 5(2),\r\nsince amended).<strong><sup> (1)</sup>  Appellants filed a proof of claim under the Act with appellee, Sandra A.\r\nAutry, the Receiver of National County Mutual Fire Insurance Company (\"the Receiver\"). \r\nThe Receiver rejected appellants' proof of claim because it did not indicate that either they or\r\nthe insured was a Texas resident, as required by the Act.  Appellants filed suit in district\r\ncourt, contending that their claim was wrongly denied and raising constitutional challenges to\r\nsection 5(2)'s residency requirement.  The district court granted the summary judgment motion\r\nof the Receiver.  Appellants renew their constitutional challenges before this Court.  We will\r\naffirm the judgment of the district court.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p></p><center><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></center>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\tOn July 22, 1988, appellants were injured when their car was struck by a truck\r\nin El Paso, Texas.  The driver of the truck was a Mexican resident.  The truck was insured by\r\nNational County Mutual Fire Insurance Company.  The insured was Transportes Union, a\r\nsyndicate of truck owners/drivers located in Juarez, Mexico.  Appellants judicially admit that\r\nat the time of the accident, they were not residents of Texas but residents of Juarez, Mexico.<strong><sup> (2)</sup></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tOn May 9, 1989, National County was ordered into permanent receivership. \r\nAppellants filed a proof of claim with the Receiver, seeking to recover benefits under the Act.<strong><sup> (3)</sup> \r\nThe Receiver rejected appellants' proof of claim, citing section 5(2)'s requirement that <em>either</em>\r\nthe third-party claimant, the liability claimant, or the insured be a Texas resident for the claim\r\nto be covered under the Act. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tAppellants filed suit in district court contending that the Receiver had wrongly\r\ndenied their claim.  Appellants later filed an amended petition, which sought a declaratory\r\njudgment that section 5(2) was unconstitutional to the extent that it distinguished between\r\nresidents and non-residents of Texas.  Appellants based their constitutional claims on \"the\r\nequal protection clause and the due process clause of the United States Constitution, as applied\r\nto state action through the Fourteenth Amendment, as well as related provisions of the\r\nConstitution of the State of Texas.\"  Appellants also contended that the resident/non-resident\r\ndistinction violated \"the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the United States Constitution.\" \r\nThe Receiver filed special exceptions to appellants' petition, to which appellants responded\r\nwith a supplemental petition that cited specific constitutional provisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe Receiver filed a motion for summary judgment, which the district court\r\ngranted.  Appellants raise two points of error, challenging section 5(2)'s distinction between\r\nresidents and non-residents based on the Privileges and Immunities Clause of article IV,\r\nsection 2 of the United States Constitution, and on the Equal Protection Clause of the\r\nFourteenth Amendment.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p></p><center><strong>ARTICLE 21.28-C OF THE INSURANCE CODE</strong></center>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe Act establishes a Guaranty Association consisting of all property and\r\ncasualty insurers licensed to transact insurance business in Texas.  Act §§ 5(2), 14.  The\r\npurpose of the Act is to provide additional protection to insureds and liability claimants of\r\n\"impaired\" insurance companies.<strong><sup> (4)</sup>  Act § 2; <em>Durish v. Channelview Bank</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2425094\"><a href=\"/opinion/2425094/durish-v-channelview-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">809</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">273</span></a></span>\r\n(Tex. App.--Austin 1991, writ denied).  The Association accomplishes this aim by maintaining\r\na Guaranty Fund with assessments from solvent member insurers.  Act § 7.  A Receiver of an\r\nimpaired insurer may use the fund to aid in paying \"covered claims\" when the impaired\r\ninsurer's assets are insufficient.  Act § 10.  Section 5(2) of the Act defines covered claims as\r\nfollows:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\"Covered claim\" is an unpaid claim of an insured or third party liability\r\nclaimant which arises out of and is within the coverage and not in excess of the\r\napplicable limits of an insurance policy to which this Act applies, issued or\r\nassumed (whereby an assumption certificate is issued to the insured) by an\r\ninsurer licensed to do business in this State, if such insurer becomes an\r\n\"impaired insurer\" after the effective date of this Act and <em>(a) the third party\r\nclaimant or liability claimant or insured is a resident of this State at the time of\r\nthe insured event;</em> or (b) the property from which the claim arises is\r\npermanently located in this State.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>Act § 5(2) (emphasis added).</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p></p><center><strong>PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES CLAUSE</strong></center>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\tIn their first point of error, appellants contend that section 5(2) \"directly\r\ncontravenes the privileges and immunities clause of the United States Constitution.\"  Although\r\nthe point of error is not specific, appellants' arguments and authorities rely upon the Privileges\r\nand Immunities Clause of article IV, section 2, of the United States Constitution.  U.S. Const.\r\nart. IV, § 2.<strong><sup> (5)</sup></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe Privileges and Immunities Clause of article IV, section 2 (hereinafter \"the\r\nClause\") states, \"The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of\r\nCitizens in the several States.\"  U.S. Const. art. IV, § 2.  The terms \"citizen\" and \"resident\"\r\nare essentially interchangeable for purposes of analysis under the Clause.  <em>Hicklin v. Orbeck</em>,\r\n<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109911\"><a href=\"/opinion/109911/hicklin-v-orbeck/\"><span class=\"volume\">437</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">518</span></a></span>, 524 n.8 (1978).  Therefore, since appellants are not residents of any state of the\r\nUnited States of America, but residents of Mexico, the Clause on its face would seem to afford\r\nthem no protection.  However, even if the Clause does provide protection for United States\r\ncitizens who are not residents of any state, section 5(2) does not violate appellants' rights\r\nunder the Clause.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe Clause prevents a state from discriminating against citizens of other states\r\nin favor of its own citizens.  <em>Hague v. Committee for Indus. Org.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103226\"><a href=\"/opinion/103226/haguer-v-committee-for-industrial-organization/\"><span class=\"volume\">307</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">496</span></a></span>, 511 (1939). \r\nThe Clause was included in the Constitution \"to help fuse into one Nation a collection of\r\nindependent sovereign States.  It was designed to insure to a citizen of State A who ventures\r\ninto State B the same privileges which the citizens of State B enjoy.\"  <em>Toomer v.

Legal distinctions between residents and non-residents reflect the fact that our\r\nnation is a collection of individual states.  <em>Baldwin</em>, 436 U.S. at 383.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tAs one commentator put it, \"There also appear to be some goods and services\r\nthat a state's citizens, having created or preserved for themselves, are entitled to keep for\r\nthemselves.\"  Laurence H. Tribe, <em>American Constitutional Law</em> 539 (2d ed. 1988).  For\r\nexample, states may charge non-resident students higher tuition rates than resident students,\r\n<em>Vlandis v. Kline</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108810\"><a href=\"/opinion/108810/vlandis-v-kline/\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">441</span></a></span>, 452-53 (1973), and charge non-residents disproportionately\r\nhigher fees for recreational hunting licenses, <em>Baldwin</em>, 436 U.S. at 388.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tAppellants cite two cases which they contend demonstrate that section 5(2)'s\r\nresidency distinction violates the Clause:  <em>Blake, Rogers, Brown &amp; Co. v. McClung</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"94954\"><a href=\"/opinion/94954/blake-v-mcclung/\"><span class=\"volume\">172</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">239</span></a></span> (1898); <em>Sully v. American Nat'l Bank</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"95300\"><a href=\"/opinion/95300/sully-v-american-nat-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">178</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">289</span></a></span> (1900).  These cases, however,\r\ninvolved a different sort of preference for residents.  The statutes in both cases gave resident\r\ncreditors preference over non-resident creditors in obtaining a failed corporation's assets.  The\r\nCourt found the resident-creditor preferences unconstitutional, explaining that when the\r\nproperty of an insolvent private corporation is distributed, non-resident creditors are entitled\r\n\"to stand upon the same plane with creditors of like class who are citizens of such state, and\r\ncannot be denied equality of right simply because they do not reside in that state, but are\r\ncitizens residing in other states of the Union.\"  <em>Blake</em>, 172 U.S. at 258.  <em>Sully</em> followed the\r\nholding of <em>Blake</em>.  <em>Sully</em>, 178 U.S. at 299.  Therefore, under <em>Blake</em>, appellants would be\r\nentitled to pursue the <em>corporate</em> assets of National County with the same status as resident\r\ncreditors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tHowever, appellants are not seeking any of National County's corporate assets. \r\nRather, appellants are seeking to recover from the Guaranty Fund created by the Act.  In\r\n<em>Blake</em>, the Supreme Court specifically stated that distinctions between residents and non-residents in statutes like the Act <em>do not</em> violate the privileges and immunities clause:</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\tIt may be appropriate to observe that the objections to the statute of\r\nTennessee do not necessarily embrace enactments that are found in some of the\r\nstates requiring foreign insurance corporations, as a condition of their coming into\r\nthe state for purposes of business, to deposit with the state treasurer funds\r\nsufficient to secure policy holders in its midst.  Legislation of that character <em>does\r\nnot</em> present any question of discrimination against citizens forbidden by the\r\nConstitution.  <em>Insurance funds set apart in advance for the benefit of home policy\r\nholders of a foreign insurance company doing business in the state are a trust fund\r\nof a specific kind to be administered for the exclusive benefit of certain persons</em>. \r\nPolicy holders in other states know that those particular funds are segregated from\r\nthe mass of property owned by the company, and that they cannot look to them to\r\nthe prejudice of those for whose special benefit they were deposited.  The present\r\ncase is not one of that kind.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><em>McClung</em>, 172 U.S. at 257 (emphasis added).  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tWe conclude that section 5(2) does not violate the Clause.  The legislature created\r\nthe insurance fund for the benefit of citizens of Texas, and held it in trust for them.  It is the very\r\nsort of enactment that the Supreme Court distinguished as <em>constitutional</em> nearly one hundred years\r\nago in <em>Blake</em>.  The Supreme Court's decisions applying the Clause since do not indicate that such\r\na statute is any less constitutional today.  Appellants' first point of error is overruled.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p></p><center><strong>EQUAL PROTECTION</strong></center>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\tIn point of error two, appellants contend that section 5(2) contravenes the Equal\r\nProtection Clause of the United States Constitution.  First, appellants argue that section 5(2)\r\nviolates the Equal Protection Clause because it infringes on their constitutional right to travel,\r\nciting <em>Shapiro v. Thompson</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107901\"><a href=\"/opinion/107901/shapiro-v-thompson/\"><span class=\"volume\">394</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">618</span></a></span> (1969), <em>Dunn v. Blumstein</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108485\"><a href=\"/opinion/108485/dunn-v-blumstein/\"><span class=\"volume\">405</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">330</span></a></span> (1972), and\r\n<em>Zobel v. Williams</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110733\"><a href=\"/opinion/110733/zobel-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">55</span></a></span> (1982).  Appellants also contend that we should recognize\r\nnon-residents as a suspect class for purposes of equal protection analysis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe cases cited by appellants for the proposition that section 5(2) infringes on their\r\nconstitutional right to travel are all distinguishable; the cases concern <em>durational</em> residency\r\nrequirements.  In <em>Shapiro v. Thompson</em>, the Supreme Court held that laws denying welfare\r\nbenefits to residents who had resided in the state for less than one year violated the Equal\r\nProtection Clause, absent a compelling state interest.  <em>Shapiro</em>, 394 U.S. at 628.  The Court\r\nreasoned that the statute's purpose, to deter the migration of needy persons into the state, was not\r\na constitutionally permissible objective because it penalized those who had exercised their\r\nconstitutional right to travel.  <em>Id</em>. at 629-31.  <em>Dunn v. Blumstein</em> and <em>Zobel v. Williams</em> also struck\r\ndown laws that drew distinctions based on length of residence.  <em>Dunn</em>, 405 U.S. at 342\r\n(\"Durational residence laws impermissibly condition and penalize the right to travel by imposing\r\ntheir prohibitions on only those persons who have recently exercised that right.\"); <em>Zobel</em>, 457 U.S.\r\nat 65 (holding that favoring established residents over new residents was a constitutionally\r\nimpermissible justification for a statute).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tAdditionally, <em>Shapiro</em> and its progeny reason that durational residency requirements\r\nraise equal protection concerns because they divide a state's citizens into two classes.  In <em>Shapiro</em>,\r\nthe Court explained that a state may not accomplish an otherwise valid purpose \"by invidious\r\ndistinctions between classes of its citizens.\"  <em>Shapiro</em>, 394 U.S. at 633.  Similarly, in <em>Zobel</em>, the\r\nCourt struck down the Alaska statute because it \"creates fixed, permanent distinctions\" between\r\nclasses of its citizens based on the length of their residency.  <em>Zobel</em>, 457 U.S. at 59.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe Court has been careful in these cases to distinguish <em>durational</em> residency\r\nrequirements:  \"We emphasize again the difference between bona fide residence requirements and\r\ndurational residence requirements.\"  <em>Dunn</em>, 405 U.S. at 343.  The Supreme Court also has stated\r\nthat assuring that services provided for residents are enjoyed <em>only</em> by residents is a substantial state\r\ninterest.  <em>Martinez v. Bynum</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110925\"><a href=\"/opinion/110925/martinez-v-bynum/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">321</span></a></span>, 328 (1983) (upholding state statute permitting school\r\ndistrict to deny tuition-free education to child living apart from parent or legal guardian if child\r\nin district \"for the primary purpose\" of attending school in the district).  Conditioning benefits on\r\nstate residency is presumptively permissible.  <em>Califano v. Torres</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109805\"><a href=\"/opinion/109805/califano-v-torres/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5 (1978).  Section\r\n5(2) is an example of a bona fide residency requirement and therefore does not infringe on\r\nappellants' right to travel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tWith regard to appellants' argument that non-residents should be recognized as a\r\nsuspect class, we note that the United States Supreme Court has been extremely hesitant in\r\nrecognizing additional suspect classes.  <em>See</em> <em>City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr</em>., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111507\"><a href=\"/opinion/111507/cleburne-v-cleburne-living-center-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">432</span></a></span> (1985) (holding that the lower court erred in treating mental retardation as a quasi-suspect\r\nclass); <em>Massachusetts Bd. of Retirement v.

Dickinson Pub. Sch.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112133\"><a href=\"/opinion/112133/kadrmas-v-dickinson-public-schools/\"><span class=\"volume\">487</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">450</span></a></span>, 457-58 (1988); <em>Williamson v.

In Texas,\r\nthe legislature has seen fit to set aside a specific fund to supplement Texas residents' recovery\r\nfrom the limited assets of insolvent insurance companies.  Protecting Texas residents from\r\nfinancial loss due to insurance company insolvencies is a legitimate state objective.  Because\r\nsection 5(2) is rationally related to achieving this objective, it does not violate the equal protection\r\nclause.  Appellants' second point of error is overruled. </p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p></p><center><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></center>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\tFinding no error, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t<span>                                                               \t\t\t\t</span>\tMack Kidd, Justice</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before Chief Justice Carroll, Justices Kidd and B.

Act § 5(4).\r\n</p><p>5. <strong>     <sup>5</sup></strong>  The Receiver contends that appellants waived their challenge under article IV, section 2\r\nby referring only to \"The Privileges and Immunities Clause of the United States Constitution\"\r\nin their response to the Receiver's summary judgment motion.  There are two Privileges and\r\nImmunities Clauses in the United States Constitution: article IV, section 2, and the Privileges\r\nand Immunities Clause at section one of the Fourteenth Amendment, which prohibits states\r\nfrom making laws which would abridge \"the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United\r\nStates.\"  U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1.  Thus, Appellants' challenge to section 5(2) in their\r\nresponse was ambiguous.  However, the Receiver did not file special exceptions to Appellants'\r\nsummary judgment response, as the Receiver did to Appellants' first amended petition.  <em>See</em>\r\nTex. R. Civ. P. 91.
