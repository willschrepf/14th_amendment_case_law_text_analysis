Appellants, Hong Kong Development, Inc.\r\n(\"HKDI\"), Hai Du Duong (\"Duong\"), and Phuong Truong Tu (\"Tu\") (collectively,\r\n\"appellants\") have responded to that motion.  After due consideration, the Court grants\r\nNguyen's motion for rehearing, withdraws its judgment and opinion of November 9,\r\n2006, and issues this opinion and judgment in their stead.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellants appeal from a judgment, rendered upon a jury verdict, in favor of\r\nNguyen for $15,312.58 in actual damages against HKDI and Duong, jointly and\r\nseverally; $200,000 in punitive damages against each of HKDI and Duong; and\r\n$79,900 in attorney's fees against all three appellants, jointly and severally.  We\r\ndetermine (1) over what appellate challenges we have jurisdiction; (2) whether the trial\r\ncourt erred in consolidating an appeal pending before it in a forcible-detainer suit with\r\na suit in which Nguyen, invoking the court's original jurisdiction, had asserted various\r\ntort and declaratory claims; (3) whether the error in consolidating the suits, if any, was\r\nrendered moot; (4) whether the evidence is legally sufficient to support liability, actual\r\ndamages, and punitive damages against HKDI and Duong; (5) whether Tu had a duty\r\nto indemnify Nguyen for her attorney's fees; and (6) whether the trial court erred in\r\nrendering judgment for attorney's fees that Nguyen's expert did not segregate among\r\nclaims and defenses for which fees were recoverable and those for which they were\r\nnot.  We reverse the judgment in part, affirm it in part, and remand the cause for\r\nlimited proceedings.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong><center>Background</center></strong>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tTu and Nguyen were sisters-in-law.  Tu, Nguyen, and Nguyen's sister entered\r\ninto a partnership to run a bakery and sandwich shop called Alpha Bakery.  In\r\nFebruary of that same year, Tu and Nguyen leased space for their business in HKDI's\r\nshopping mall.  The lease that they executed with HKDI (\"the lease agreement\") listed\r\nTu and Nguyen as \"Tenant\" and contained the following provisions:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center><strong><span>24.

This\r\nLease shall not, nor shall any interest therein, be assignable, as to the\r\ninterest of Tenant, by operation of law, without the prior written consent\r\nof Landlord.  However, it is further understood and agreed that Tenant\r\nshall not sell, convey, or assign any interest in the corporation [sic]\r\nwithout prior written approval from Landlord, and if Landlord does not\r\nagree to the sale, conveyance or assignment of the corporation [sic],\r\nLandlord may,  at Landlord's option, terminate this Lease.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t. . . .</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center><strong><span>57.

The failure of Landlord to declare any Event of Default\r\nupon the occurrence thereof, or any delay by Landlord in taking action\r\nwith respect thereto shall not waive such default, but Landlord shall have\r\nthe right to declare such default at any time and to take such action as\r\nmay be authorized hereunder to the extent herein provided.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Duong, HKDI's president and owner, signed the lease agreement on behalf of HKDI.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tTu's and Nguyen's relationship soured a few years later, about the time that\r\nNguyen and her husband, Tu's brother, began divorce proceedings.  The partners'\r\ndispute led to a lawsuit (\"the partnership suit\"), and the partnership eventually went\r\ninto receivership.  The jury in the partnership suit awarded Nguyen and her sister, also\r\na partner, 70% of the partnership; awarded Tu 30% of the partnership; and awarded\r\nactual damages to Nguyen and attorney's fees to Nguyen and her sister.<sup> (1)</sup>  In a separate\r\nreceivership sale of Alpha Bakery, Nguyen purchased the business.  Final paperwork\r\nfor the sale was drawn up, including a contract assigning Tu's lease interest to Nguyen\r\n(\"the lease assignment\"), as well as a contract assigning Tu's partnership interest to\r\nNguyen (\"the partnership assignment\").  No one obtained HKDI's consent to the lease\r\nassignment, despite the lease agreement's requirement that HKDI's written consent\r\nbe obtained as a precondition to any assignment of the leasehold interest. \r\nNonetheless, Nguyen and Tu signed the documents, including the lease assignment.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn a nutshell, Nguyen's position in the current suit was that she and Tu had\r\nsigned the lease assignment without HKDI's written consent under duress because the\r\ntrial court in the partnership suit had ordered them to sign it under threat of contempt. \r\nShe also alleged that Tu's counsel in the partnership suit, who had represented HKDI\r\nin other matters, had implied in the partnership suit that he was representing both Tu\r\nand HKDI and that HKDI would not object to the assignment.  Nguyen also took the\r\nposition in the current lawsuit that Tu, HKDI, and Duong had conspired, for various\r\nreasons, to have the parties execute the lease assignment without first obtaining\r\nHKDI's written consent so that Nguyen could be declared in default, HKDI could\r\nevict her, and Tu could open a competing restaurant in the same mall.  HKDI, Duong,\r\nand Tu disputed the validity of Nguyen's theories.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn May 2003, HKDI notified Nguyen and Tu that they were in default under the\r\nlease because HKDI's consent had not been obtained to the lease assignment and\r\ninstructed them to vacate the premises.  Later that month, Nguyen sued HKDI, Duong,\r\nand Tu in Harris County Civil Court at Law No. 3 (\"the tort suit\").<sup> (2)</sup>  Nguyen  (1)\r\nsought a declaration that the lease assignment from Tu to Nguyen was not a breach of\r\nthe lease agreement; (2) asserted a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty against\r\nTu; (3) asserted a cause of action for conspiracy against all appellants, alleging that\r\nthey had conspired in order for Tu to run Nguyen's restaurant out of business so that\r\nTu could operate an allegedly competing restaurant within Hong Kong Market; and\r\n(4) sought actual damages of \"less than $100,000,\" exemplary damages, attorney's\r\nfees, and injunctive relief.  Two months later, Nguyen filed a first supplemental\r\npetition in the tort suit, seeking a declaration--as an apparent alternative to a\r\ndeclaration that the lease assignment had not breached the lease agreement--that the\r\nlease assignment was void for having been executed under the \"extreme duress\" of the\r\nthreat of contempt in the partnership suit.  All appellants answered, and HKDI and\r\nDuong asserted a counter-claim against Nguyen for sanctions for the filing of a\r\nfrivolous lawsuit.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn July 2003, HKDI filed suit, against both Tu and Nguyen, for forcible detainer\r\nin a Harris County justice of the peace court, seeking possession of the leasehold\r\nproperty (\"the forcible-detainer suit\").  <em>See </em>Tex. Prop. Code Ann. § 24.002 (Vernon\r\n2000).  Although the record does not show how the justice court disposed of the\r\nforcible-detainer suit, HKDI asserts, without dispute, that it confessed judgment and\r\nthen immediately appealed to County Civil Court at Law No. 1.<sup> (3)</sup>  <em>See </em>Tex. R. App. P.\r\n38.1(f) (\"In a civil case, the court will accept as true the facts stated [in the appellant's\r\nbrief] unless another party contradicts them.\"); <em>Mullins v. Coussons</em>, 745 S.W.2d 50,\r\n50 (Tex. App.--Houston [14th Dist.] 1987, no writ) (holding that rendition of agreed\r\njudgment in justice court in forcible-detainer suit does not deprive county court of\r\njurisdiction to hear case, when appealed, in trial <em>de novo</em>).  <em> </em>Both Tu and Nguyen\r\nanswered in the county civil court at law in the forcible-detainer suit.  On October 2,\r\n2003, Nguyen asserted counter-claims in the forcible-detainer suit against HKDI,\r\ncross-claims against Tu, and \"cross-claims\"--which were actually third-party\r\nclaims--against Duong, who had theretofore not been a party in the forcible-detainer\r\nsuit.<sup> (4)</sup>  Nguyen alleged (1) that Tu and Duong had tortiously interfered with her\r\ncontractual relations; (2) that Tu had breached her fiduciary duty to Nguyen; (3) that\r\nall appellants had unfairly competed with her; and (4) that all appellants had conspired\r\nto evict her.  On her counter-, cross-, and third-party claims in the forcible-detainer\r\nsuit, Nguyen sought actual damages of \"less than $100,000,\" exemplary damages, and\r\nattorney's fees.  HKDI answered Nguyen's counter-claims against it, but Duong did\r\nnot.  Although the clerk's record does not show this, HKDI and Duong assert on\r\nappeal, without contradiction by Nguyen, that Nguyen never served Duong on her\r\nthird-party claim.  <em>See</em> Tex. R. App. P. 38.1(f).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn October 10 and 15, 2003, respectively, Tu and HKDI moved in the forcible-detainer suit to strike or to sever Nguyen's counter-claims, cross-claims, and third-party claims, arguing that the county civil court at law had no subject-matter\r\njurisdiction to consider these matters in a forcible-detainer suit.  On October 16, 2003,\r\nNguyen moved in the forcible-detainer suit to consolidate the tort suit and the forcible-detainer suit, which motion HKDI opposed in writing, while also reurging its earlier-filed motion to strike or to sever.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn the meantime, on October 16, 2003 in the forcible-detainer suit, Nguyen filed\r\nher first amended counter-claim, cross-claim, and third-party claim, this time omitting\r\nDuong as a named party.  This amendment occurred before the court in the forcible-detainer suit had ruled on Nguyen's motion to consolidate.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn October 23, 2003, the trial court in the forcible-detainer suit signed an order\r\nconsolidating the two lawsuits and ordering the tort suit transferred to County Civil\r\nCourt at Law No. 1, the court to which the forcible-detainer suit had been appealed\r\n(\"the consolidated suit\").  From that point forward, Nguyen supplemented her petition\r\nonce on the day that trial began, and she was twice granted leave, over HKDI's and\r\nDuong's various objections, to conform the pleadings to the evidence.  One of these\r\npost-trial amendments re-added Duong as a third-party defendant to Nguyen's third-party claims that had been asserted in the forcible-detainer suit before consolidation. \r\nAfter consolidation, Tu also asserted a counter-claim and a cross-claim against\r\nNguyen for indemnity based on a provision in the lease assignment.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBy virtue of her pleadings filed in the separate suits before consolidation, and\r\nby virtue of the pre-trial and post-trial amendments that the trial court allowed in the\r\nconsolidated suit, Nguyen pleaded the following claims, requests for relief, and\r\ndefenses in the consolidated suit:<sup> (5)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\ta declaration that the lease assignment from Tu to Nguyen was not\r\na breach of the lease agreement with HKDI;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\ta declaration--as an apparent alternative to a declaration that the\r\nlease assignment had not breached the lease agreement--that the\r\nlease assignment was void for having been executed under the\r\n\"extreme duress\" of the threat of contempt in the partnership suit;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\tbreach of fiduciary duty by Tu;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\tconspiracy against all appellants, asserting that they had conspired\r\nto evict her;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\ttortious interference with contractual relations by Tu and Duong;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\tunfair competition against all appellants;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\tindemnity against Tu, under theories that Tu had breached a\r\ncontract and that Tu owed indemnity for attorney's fees under the\r\ndocuments signed in the partnership suit; and</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\twaiver and estoppel, as defenses to HKDI's position that it was\r\nentitled to possession because Nguyen had breached the lease\r\nagreement with HKDI by virtue of the lease assignment.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tNot all of the claims went to the jury, however.

Alternatively, they raise\r\nother challenges that they assert concern non-jurisdictional matters relating to\r\nallegations in the tort suit that were carried forward or added after consolidation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>A.\tOur Appellate Jurisdiction to Consider HKDI and Duong's Various\r\nChallenges</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDetermining which of HKDI and Duong's various appellate challenges we may\r\nconsider is complicated by the facts that the two suits were consolidated; that in one\r\nsuit, the county court exercised appellate jurisdiction; that in the other suit, the county\r\ncourt exercised original jurisdiction; that in both suits, the parties sought, among other\r\nthings, a determination of the right to possession; that the suits were tried together\r\nafter consolidation; and that one judgment was rendered in the consolidated cause and\r\nincluded, among other determinations, a determination of the right to possession.  We\r\nfirst examine our appellate jurisdiction over judgments in suits in which the county\r\ncourt exercises appellate jurisdiction (specifically, forcible-detainer suits), our\r\nappellate jurisdiction over judgments in suits in which the county court exercises\r\noriginal jurisdiction, and the effect on our appellate jurisdiction of the consolidation\r\nhere.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>\t1.\tOur Jurisdiction in Appeals from a Forcible-Detainer Judgment in\r\nCounty Court</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn appeal from a forcible-detainer judgment, we have no jurisdiction to\r\nconsider the issue of possession if, as is the case here, the disputed premises were used\r\nfor commercial purposes.  Tex. Prop. Code Ann. § 24.007 (Vernon 2000) (\"A final\r\njudgment of a county court in an eviction suit may not be appealed on the issue of\r\npossession unless the premises in question are being used for residential purposes\r\nonly.\"); <em>Carlson's Hill Country Beverage, L.C. v. Westinghouse Rd. Joint Venture</em>,\r\n957 S.W.2d 951, 952-53 (Tex. App.--Austin 1997, no pet.). The prohibition against\r\nconsidering possession includes consideration of any finding \"essential to the issue\r\nof,\"<sup> (9)</sup> \"dependent on,\"<sup> (10)</sup> or \"primarily concerned with the issue of\"<sup> (11)</sup> possession.  In\r\nsum, had the cases not been consolidated, we would have been able to review only\r\nlimited issues in an appeal of the judgment rendered in the forcible-detainer suit.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>\t2.\tOur Jurisdiction in Appeals from Other Judgments in County Court</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tIn contrast, our appellate jurisdiction is generally not so limited in an appeal of\r\na county court judgment outside the forcible-detainer context.  <em>See </em>Tex. Gov't Code\r\nAnn. § 22.220(a) (Vernon 2004) (\"Each court of appeals has appellate jurisdiction of\r\nall civil cases within its district of which the district courts or county courts have\r\njurisdiction when the amount in controversy or the judgment rendered exceeds $100,\r\nexclusive of interest and costs.\").  Therefore, had the cases not been consolidated, we\r\nwould have had plenary appellate jurisdiction to review virtually any issue asserted\r\nto challenge a judgment rendered in the tort suit.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><strong>\t3.\tThe Effect of Consolidation on Our Appellate Jurisdiction</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tOur jurisdiction to consider HKDI and Duong's various appellate challenges is\r\naffected by the consolidation of the forcible-detainer and tort suits.  Two types of\r\nconsolidation exist: true consolidation and consolidation for trial.  <em>See </em>3 Roy W.\r\nMcDonald &amp; Elaine A. Grafton Carlson, Texas Civil Practice § 17:25, at 775 \r\n(2d ed. 2000) [hereinafter \"McDonald &amp; Carlson\"]; <em>see also </em>7 William V.\r\nDorsaneo III, Texas Litigation Guide § 112.01[1][a] (1999) [hereinafter\r\n\"Dorsaneo\"].  True consolidation, as occurred here, involves merging separate suits<em>\r\n</em>into a single proceeding under one docket number.   McDonald &amp; Carlson, <em>supra</em>,<em>\r\n</em>at 775.  \"'When actions are properly consolidated they become merged and are\r\nthereafter treated as one suit. . . .'\"  <em>Perry v. Del Rio</em>, 53 S.W.3d 818, 825 n.6 (Tex.\r\nApp.--Austin 2001) (quoting 1 Tex. Jur. 3d <em>Actions</em> § 77 (1993)), <em>pet. dism'd</em>, 66\r\nS.W.3d 239 (Tex. 2001); <em>see Rust v.

It became but one suit . . . .\"). \r\nTherefore, when a court orders true consolidation of two or more cases, the actions are\r\nmerged and thereafter proceed as a single action.  <em>See Rust</em>, 107 Tex. at 387, 180 S.W.\r\nat 95; <em>Perry</em>, 53 S.W.3d at 825 n.6; McDonald &amp; Carlson, <em>supra</em>,<em> </em>at 775.  Here, a\r\nsingle judgment was rendered after consolidation, and it is that judgment that HKDI\r\nand Duong appeal.<sup> (12)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe hold as follows.  In this appeal from the single judgment in the consolidated\r\nsuit, we have the limited appellate jurisdiction provided by Texas Property Code\r\nsection 24.007 to consider challenges to matters raised <em>solely</em> by the forcible-detainer\r\npleadings.  <em>See </em>Tex. Prop. Code Ann. § 24.007.  In contrast, we have plenary\r\nappellate jurisdiction to consider challenges to matters raised by the tort-suit\r\npleadings, regardless of whether those matters were also raised by the forcible-detainer\r\npleadings.  For each of HKDI and Duong's challenges discussed below, we state\r\nseparately whether we have jurisdiction to consider them.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>B.</strong>\t<strong>The Counter-Claim and Third-Party Claim Asserted in the Forcible-Detainer Suit Against HKDI and Duong Before Consolidation</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tIn issue one, HKDI and Duong argue that the trial court lacked subject-matter\r\njurisdiction to adjudicate Nguyen's counter-claims against HKDI and her third-party\r\nclaims against Duong that she had asserted in the forcible-detainer suit before\r\nconsolidation.  Specifically, they argue that the county civil court at law, sitting as an\r\nappellate court in the forcible-detainer suit, lacked subject-matter jurisdiction to\r\nconsider the counter-claims and third-party claims because those claims (1) exceeded\r\nthe justice court's jurisdiction, (2) fell outside the scope of claims allowed in a\r\nforcible-detainer suit, and (3) were impermissibly raised for the first time on appeal\r\nto the county civil court at law.  Additionally, HKDI and Duong argue that the trial\r\ncourt lacked subject-matter jurisdiction to award actual damages over the justice\r\ncourt's $5,000 damages cap, and to award exemplary damages at all, in the forcible-detainer suit.  For these reasons, HKDI and Duong argue that the trial court erred in\r\nnot severing or striking the complained-of counter-claims and third-party claims from\r\nthe forcible-detainer suit before consolidation.  We have jurisdiction to consider these \r\nchallenges because, although they concern matters in the pre-consolidation forcible-detainer suit, they relate to the county civil court at law's subject-matter jurisdiction\r\nand thus do not concern the issue of possession.  <em>See Gibson v. Dynegy Midstream\r\nServs., L.P.</em>, 138 S.W.3d 518, 521 (Tex. App.--Fort Worth 2004, no pet.); <em>Rice v.\r\nPinney</em>, 51 S.W.3d 705, 708 (Tex. App.--Dallas 2001, no pet.) (\"Section 24.007 does\r\nnot preclude appellate review of a county court at law's subject matter jurisdiction\"\r\nbecause such challenges concern county court's \"authority to decide this case\r\nregardless of how it resolved the possession issue.\").</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>\t1.\tWhat May Be Determined in a Forcible-Detainer Suit</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\"The procedure to determine the right to immediate possession of real property,\r\nif there was no unlawful entry, is the action of forcible detainer.\"  <em>Rice</em>, 51 S.W.3d at\r\n709; <em>see </em>Tex. Prop. Code Ann. § 24.002 (defining forcible detainer).  \"To prevail in\r\na forcible detainer action, a plaintiff is not required to prove title but is only required\r\nto show sufficient evidence of ownership to demonstrate a superior right to immediate\r\npossession.\"  <em>Ward v. Malone</em>, 115 S.W.3d 267, 270 (Tex. App.--Corpus Christi\r\n2003, pet. denied).  For these reasons, \"a judgment of possession in a forcible detainer\r\naction is a determination only of the right to immediate possession and does not\r\ndetermine the ultimate rights of the parties to any other issue in controversy relating\r\nto the realty in question.\"  <em>Lopez v. Sulak</em>, 76 S.W.3d 597, 605 (Tex. App.--Corpus\r\nChristi 2002, no pet.); <em>see Martinez v. Beasley</em>, 572 S.W.2d 83, 85 (Tex. Civ.\r\nApp.--Corpus Christi 1978, no writ).  Prior to consolidation, the forcible-detainer suit\r\nwas purely one for forcible detainer, that is, to determine the right to immediate\r\npossession.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tJustice courts have original jurisdiction over forcible-detainer suits.  <em>See </em>Tex.\r\nProp. Code Ann. § 24.004 (Vernon 2000); <em>see also </em>Tex. Gov't Code Ann.\r\n§ 27.031(a)(2) (Vernon 2004).   Any party dissatisfied with a justice-court judgment\r\nin such a suit may appeal to the county court,<sup> (13)</sup> in which trial is <em>de novo</em>.  <em>See </em>Tex. R.\r\nCiv. P. 749.  On appeal in a forcible-detainer suit, the county court exercises appellate,\r\nnot original, jurisdiction.  The county court's appellate jurisdiction is generally\r\nconfined to the limits of the justice court (with the exception of the specific damages\r\nnoted below), and the county court has no jurisdiction over a forcible-detainer appeal\r\nunless the justice court did.  <em>Ward</em>, 115 S.W.3d at 269.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\"An action of forcible entry and detainer is a special proceeding and as such is\r\ngoverned by the special statutes and rules applicable thereto.\"  <em>Haginas</em>, 163 Tex. 274,\r\n277, 354 S.W.2d 368, 371 (1962); <em>accord Rice</em>, 51 S.W.3d at 709.  \"Forcible-entry-and-detainer actions provide a speedy, summary, and inexpensive determination of the\r\nright to immediate possession of real property.\"  <em>Volume Millwork, Inc.</em>, 2006 WL\r\n3628830, at *3; <em>Meridien Hotels, Inc. v. LHO Fin. P'ship I, L.P.</em>, 97 S.W.3d 731, 737\r\n(Tex. App.--Dallas 2003, no pet.); <em>see McGlothlin v. Kliebert</em>, 672 S.W.2d 231, 232\r\n(Tex. 1984).  The Texas Rules of Civil Procedure ensure the speedy, summary, and\r\ninexpensive nature of forcible-detainer suits.  <em>See Meridien Hotels, Inc.</em>, 97 S.W.3d\r\nat 737; <em>see also</em> Tex. R. Civ. P. 739, 740, 745, 746, 748, 749 (all requiring expedited\r\nor streamlined procedures in forcible-entry and forcible-detainer suits).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBecause of this purpose, the sole issue to be determined in a forcible-detainer\r\nor forcible-entry suit is the entitlement to actual and immediate possession.  <em>See </em>Tex.\r\nR. Civ. P. 746; <em>Haginas</em>, 354 S.W.2d at 371.  Nonetheless, the rules do vest the justice\r\nor county courts in such suits with jurisdiction over a few other limited matters.  For\r\nexample, a suit for rent may be joined with an action for forcible entry or detainer, as\r\nlong as the claim for rent falls within the justice court's jurisdiction.  Tex. R. Civ. P.\r\n738; <em>Haginas</em>, 354 S.W.2d at 371.  Additionally, in trial <em>de novo</em> on appeal to the\r\ncounty court, \"the appellant or appellee shall be permitted to plead, prove and recover\r\nhis damages, if any, suffered for withholding or defending possession of the premises\r\nduring the pendency of the appeal,\" although only the party prevailing in the county\r\ncourt may recover these damages.  Tex. R. Civ. P. 752.  Such damages include, but are\r\nnot limited to, loss of rents during the appeal's pendency and reasonable attorney's\r\nfees in the justice and county courts, and the prevailing party in the county court may\r\nalso recover costs.  <em>Id.</em>  The damages that may be sought under rule 752 are only those\r\n\"suffered as a direct result of withholding or defending possession.\"  <em>Hanks v. Lake\r\nTowne Apartments</em>, 812 S.W.2d 625, 627 (Tex. App.--Dallas 1991, writ denied). \r\nUnder rule 752, a party may recover the specified damages \"regardless of the amount\r\nso long as [the prevailing party] can prove such damages.\"  <em>Haginas</em>, 354 S.W.2d at\r\n372.  In other words, in a trial <em>de novo</em> in a forcible-detainer proceeding on appeal in\r\ncounty court, a prevailing party may recover the damages allowed by rule 752 even\r\nif the amount of those damages exceeds the amount-in-controversy limit of the county\r\ncourt's original jurisdiction.  <em>Id.</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe county and justice courts lack subject-matter jurisdiction in a forcible-detainer suit to adjudicate matters other than those listed in the immediately preceding\r\nparagraphs.  <em>See, e.g.</em>, <em>Krull v. Somoza</em>, 879 S.W.2d 320, 322 (Tex. App.--Houston\r\n[14th Dist.] 1994, writ denied) (holding that damages claims related to maintaining or\r\nobtaining possession of disputed premises may be joined with forcible-detainer suit\r\nand litigated in county court, but that damages for other causes of action cannot be\r\nmaintained in same suit); <em>Hanks</em>, 812 S.W.2d at 627 (holding that county court lacked\r\nsubject-matter jurisdiction over tenant's counter-claims for wrongful retention of\r\nrental security deposit that had been asserted on appeal in forcible-detainer suit);\r\n<em>Rushing v. Smith</em>, 630 S.W.2d 498, 499-500 (Tex. App.--Amarillo 1982, no writ)\r\n(holding that county court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over cross-claims for\r\ndamages to recover for certain farming work that had been done, which damages were\r\nunrelated to expenses in defending possession, on appeal in forcible-detainer suit).<sup> (14)</sup> \r\nThis result obtains because \"[t]he jurisdiction of the County Court is of a dual nature[:]\r\none original and the other appellate from the Justice Court.\"  <em>Neal</em> <em>v. Beck Funeral\r\nHome</em>, 131 S.W.2d 778, 779 (Tex. Civ. App.--Fort Worth 1939, writ dism'd) (holding\r\nsame in appeal to county court from justice court in suit other than one for forcible\r\ndetainer).  When a county court acquires only appellate jurisdiction in a given suit, it\r\nmay not, absent authorization by statute or rule, determine any matter acquired by\r\nvirtue of its original jurisdiction in that same suit.  <em>See id.</em> at 780.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t<strong>2.</strong>\t<strong>Discussion</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tPrior to consolidation, Nguyen alleged against HKDI and Duong in the forcible-detainer suit (by counter-claim or third-party claim asserted for the first time on appeal\r\nto the county court at law) that (1) Duong had tortiously interfered with her contractual\r\nrelations; (2) all appellants had unfairly competed with her; and (3) all appellants had\r\nconspired to evict her.  She also sought actual damages of \"less than $100,000,\"\r\nexemplary damages, and attorney's fees.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tUnder the law set out above, the county court at law, before consolidation, had\r\nno subject-matter jurisdiction over these claims because it was exercising its appellate\r\njurisdiction over the forcible-detainer suit appealed from the justice court.  None of\r\nthe matters that Nguyen pleaded concerned the right to immediate possession.  <em>See\r\n</em>Tex. R. Civ. P. 746 (providing that right to possession is sole issue determined in\r\nforcible-detainer or forcible-entry suit).  Neither were they an attempt to collect rent. \r\n<em>See </em>Tex. R. Civ. P. 738 (allowing suit for rent to be adjudicated with forcible-detainer\r\nsuit, provided that rent sought is within justice court's jurisdiction).  Additionally, as\r\nshe had pleaded her tort claims, Nguyen did not expressly seek, or limit her damages\r\nto, damages \"suffered for withholding or defending possession of the premises during\r\nthe pendency of the appeal.\"  Tex. R. Civ. P. 752; <em>see Krull</em>, 879 S.W.2d at 322\r\n(holding that, under rule 752, damages unrelated to maintaining or obtaining\r\npossession of disputed premises may not be joined with forcible-detainer suit in\r\ncounty court).  Because she did not seek rule-752 damages--which pleading would\r\nhave allowed her to seek more than the $5,000 amount-in-controversy limit applicable\r\nto many appeals from justice court<sup> (15)</sup>--the fact that Nguyen sought up to $100,000 also\r\ntook her tort claims outside of the county court's appellate jurisdiction.  <em>Compare </em>Tex.\r\nGov't Code Ann. § 27.031(a)(1) (setting amount-in-controversy civil jurisdiction of\r\njustice courts at $5,000 maximum, excluding interest) <em>with</em> <em>id. </em>§ 25.0003(c)(1)\r\n(Vernon 2004) (setting amount-in-controversy civil jurisdiction of statutory county\r\ncourts at $100,000 maximum, excluding interest, statutory or punitive damages or\r\npenalties, and attorney's fees and costs).  Finally, exemplary damages do not fall\r\nwithin those damages authorized in forcible-detainer suits.  <em>See </em>Tex. R. Civ. P. 746,\r\n752.  Simply put, there is no way to construe Nguyen's counter-claims and third-party\r\nclaims that she asserted in the forcible-detainer suit against HKDI and Duong before\r\nconsolidation so that the county court could have exercised jurisdiction over them.<sup> (16)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWhen a court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over some claims, but not others,\r\nit should sever or dismiss those claims over which jurisdiction is lacking.  <em>See Thomas\r\nv. Long</em>, 207 S.W.3d 334, 338 (Tex. 2006) (\"[I]t is proper for a trial court to dismiss\r\nclaims over which it does not have subject matter jurisdiction but retain claims in the\r\nsame case over which it has jurisdiction.\") (citing <em>Am. Motorists Ins. Co. v. Fodge</em>, 63\r\nS.W.3d 801, 805 (Tex. 2001)); <em>Fandey v. Lee</em>, 880 S.W.2d 164, 169 (Tex. App.--El\r\nPaso 1994, writ denied) (indicating in dictum that counter-claims for fraud and to quiet\r\ntitle were properly severed from forcible-detainer suit).  HKDI and Duong moved,\r\nbefore consolidation, to strike or to sever all of Nguyen's claims in the forcible-detainer suit.  Although severance rulings are reviewable for abuse of discretion,<sup> (17)</sup> it\r\nis an inherent abuse of discretion to misapply the law--such as, for example, when a\r\ncourt exercises jurisdiction over a matter over which it has none.  <em>See Walker v.\r\nPacker</em>, 827 S.W.2d 833, 840 (Tex. 1992); <em>see also</em> <em>Tex. Natural Res. Conservation\r\nComm'n v. IT-Davy</em>, 74 S.W.3d 849, 855 (Tex. 2002) (providing that question of\r\nwhether court has subject-matter jurisdiction is question of law).  Additionally, to the\r\nextent that the court's rulings (here, the motion to strike or to sever) allowed the\r\nexercise of jurisdiction over matters in the forcible-detainer appeal over which the\r\ncourt lacked jurisdiction, we review those rulings <em>de novo</em>.  <em>See Tex. Dep't of Parks\r\n&amp; Wildlife v. Miranda</em>, 133 S.W.3d 217, 228 (Tex. 2004) ( \"Appellate courts\r\nreviewing a challenge to a trial court's subject matter jurisdiction review the trial\r\ncourt's ruling <em>de novo</em>.\").</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>\t3.\tMootness</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tNonetheless, the jurisdictional error committed before consolidation was\r\nrendered moot by the consolidation. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t \"An eviction suit does not bar a suit for trespass, damages, waste, rent, or\r\nmesne profits.\"  Tex. Prop. Code Ann. § 24.008 (Vernon 2000).  Additionally, \"[a]\r\njudgment or a determination of fact or law in a proceeding in . . . justice of the peace\r\ncourt is not res judicata and does not constitute a basis for estoppel by judgment in a\r\nproceeding in a . . . statutory county court.\"  Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann.\r\n§ 31.005 (Vernon 1997).  That is, a forcible-detainer action is cumulative of, not\r\nexclusive of, other remedies that a party may have.  <em>McGlothlin</em>, 672 S.W.2d at 233;\r\n<em>Dormady v. Dinero Land &amp; Cattle Co., L.C.</em>, 61 S.W.3d 555, 558 (Tex. App.--San\r\nAntonio 2001, pet. dism'd w.o.j.); <em>Rice</em>, 51 S.W.3d at 709.  \"If all matters between the\r\nparties cannot be adjudicated in the justice court in which the forcible entry and\r\ndetainer proceedings are pending due to the justice court's limited subject matter\r\njurisdiction, then either party may maintain an action in a court of competent\r\njurisdiction for proper relief.\"  <em>McGlothlin</em>, 672 S.W.2d at 233; <em>accord Rushing</em>, 630\r\nS.W.2d at 500.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFor these reasons, a forcible-detainer suit in justice court may run concurrently\r\nwith another action in another court--even if the other action adjudicates matters that\r\ncould result in a different determination of possession from that rendered in the\r\nforcible-detainer suit.  <em>See Villalon v. Bank One</em>, 176 S.W.3d 66, 70-71 (Tex.\r\nApp.--Houston [1st Dist.] 2004, pet. denied) (indicating that suit to determine\r\nwrongful foreclosure, which concerned title, could have been pursued in separate\r\nproceeding concurrently with forcible-detainer suit); <em>see also Meridien Hotels, Inc.</em>,\r\n97 S.W.3d at 738 (holding that trial court properly issued writ of mandamus to compel\r\njustice court to vacate order abating forcible-detainer suit until district court--which\r\nhad issued interlocutory order declaring that tenants had defaulted under lease, that\r\nlandlord had right to terminate lease, and that tenants no longer had right to\r\npossession--had rendered final judgment).  Matters relating to possession may overlap\r\nin the two proceedings because \"a judgment of possession in a forcible detainer action\r\nis a determination only of the right to <em>immediate possession </em>and does not determine\r\nthe <em>ultimate </em>rights of the parties to <em>any </em>other issue in controversy relating to the realty\r\nin question.\"  <em>Lopez</em>, 76 S.W.3d at 605 (emphasis added); <em>see, e.g.</em>,<em> Martinez</em>, 572\r\nS.W.2d at 85.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBefore consolidation, Nguyen alleged causes of action against HKDI for\r\nconspiracy to evict her and sought up to $100,000 actual damages and exemplary\r\ndamages in the tort suit.  This is the same claim that Nguyen alleged, and the same\r\ndamages that she sought, against HKDI and Duong in the forcible-detainer suit. \r\nAccordingly, even though the county civil court at law lacked appellate jurisdiction\r\nin the forcible-detainer suit before consolidation to consider Nguyen's counter-claim\r\nagainst HKDI for conspiracy, her third-party claim against Duong for conspiracy, and\r\nher request for many of the damages that she sought against both HKDI and Duong,\r\nthe trial court had subject-matter jurisdiction to consider those claims and types of\r\ndamages in the tort suit.  <em>See </em>Tex.

HKDI and Duong argue that the trial court's\r\nconsolidating these suits allowed Nguyen to assert the very claims and to recover the\r\nvery damages that would not have been maintainable or recoverable in the forcible-detainer suit had it not been consolidated with the tort suit.  They argue that the county\r\ncivil court at law had the power to exercise either appellate or original jurisdiction, but\r\nnot both in the same suit.  Put another way, they argue that the trial court could not do\r\nthrough the back door what it could not do through the front.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>\t1.\tWhether Consolidation is Jurisdictional</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tConsolidation is a procedural device that a court may utilize at its discretion\r\nupon motion, upon stipulation, or<em> sua sponte</em>.  <em>See </em> McDonald &amp; Carlson, <em>supra</em>,<em>\r\n</em>at 777.  Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 174(a) provides:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWhen actions involving a common question of law or fact are pending\r\nbefore the court, it may order a joint hearing or trial of any or all the\r\nmatters in issue in the actions; it may order all the actions consolidated;\r\nand it may make such orders concerning proceedings therein as may tend\r\nto avoid unnecessary costs or delay.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span></span><span>Tex. R. Civ. P. 174(a).  Consolidation furthers judicial economy by combining actions\r\nthat involve a common question of law or fact to mitigate the expense associated with\r\nlitigation, to eliminate the proliferation of suits, and to expedite the judicial process. \r\n<em>See</em> McDonald &amp; Carlson, <em>supra</em>,<em> </em>at 776; <em>see also Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp.\r\nv. Martin</em>, 942 S.W.2d 712, 716 (Tex. App.--Dallas 1997, no writ) (\"In deciding\r\nwhether to consolidate, the trial court must balance the judicial economy and\r\nconvenience that may be gained by the consolidation against the risk of an unfair\r\noutcome because of prejudice or jury confusion.\").  \"The trial court may consolidate\r\nactions that relate to substantially the same transaction, occurrence, subject matter, or\r\nquestion.\"  <em>Martin</em>, 942 S.W.2d at 716.  Rule 174(a) \"does not require that all of the\r\nquestions of law or fact be common to each of the cases to be consolidated.  All that\r\nis required is that the two actions involve one or more common questions of\r\nsignificance.  This is especially true if the parties are identical.\"  7 William V.\r\nDorsaneo, <em>supra</em>, at § 112.02[1]. However, if the parties and issues differ, then\r\nconsolidation is improper.  McDonald &amp; Carlson, <em>supra</em>,<em> </em>783-84.  We review a\r\nconsolidation order for abuse of discretion.  <em>Allison v. Ark. La. Gas Co.</em>, 624 S.W.2d\r\n566, 568 (Tex. 1981).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tHKDI and Duong reason as follows.  By virtue of the consolidation, the two\r\nlawsuits in this case merged and proceeded thereafter as a single action.  <em>See Perry</em>,\r\n53 S.W.3d at 825 n.6; <em>Rust</em>, 107 Tex. at 387, 180 S.W. at 95; McDonald &amp; Carlson,\r\n<em>supra</em>,<em> </em>at 775.  Accordingly, Nguyen's claims against HKDI and Duong--over some\r\nof which the court in the forcible-detainer suit did not have jurisdiction when they\r\nwere asserted there as cross-claims and third-party claims--were subsequently\r\nallowed to be raised in the consolidated suit by virtue of the consolidation. \r\nConsolidation in these circumstances thus accomplished what the same court, when\r\npresiding over the forcible-detainer appeal, lacked subject-matter jurisdiction to do. \r\nThus, they conclude that the trial court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction to\r\nconsolidate the suits.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe disagree.  An order is void, among other things, if the trial court lacks\r\nsubject-matter jurisdiction to render it.  <em>See</em> <em>Browning v. Placke</em>, 698 S.W.2d 362, 363\r\n(Tex. 1985) (indicating that judgment is void when, among other things, it is apparent\r\nthat court rendering judgment \"had . . . no jurisdiction of the subject matter\"); <em>In re\r\nDickason</em>, 987 S.W.2d 570, 571 (Tex. 1998) (holding that order rendered after trial\r\ncourt's plenary jurisdiction had expired was void); <em>cf.

App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 2000, orig. proceeding) (\"Mandamus lies over\r\nan interlocutory or temporary order that the court had no jurisdiction to make.\").  It is\r\nundisputed that each of the two county civil courts at law involved here sat in the same\r\ncounty; that each had subject-matter jurisdiction over forcible-detainer appeals\r\ngenerally; and that each also had subject-matter jurisdiction over the general\r\ncategories of damage claims and declaratory relief that Nguyen sought (putting aside\r\nfor a moment HKDI and Duong's challenges to the aggregate amounts in controversy). \r\n<em>See </em>Tex. Gov't Code Ann. §§ 25.0003(a), (c)(1), 25.1031(a), 25.1032(a) (Vernon\r\n2004). </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWhen the transferee county court has subject-matter jurisdiction over the\r\nmatters sought to be transferred to it in a consolidation (which the county civil court\r\nat law here did, in the abstract), consolidation is generally a procedural matter, rather\r\nthan a jurisdictional one.  <em>Cf. Montgomery v. Willbanks</em>, 202 S.W.2d 851, 853 (Tex.\r\nCiv. App.--Fort Worth 1947, writ ref'd n.r.e.) (\"There is no lack of jurisdiction\r\ninvolved here, because the district court acquired jurisdiction of the issues presented\r\nin the two cases as they were filed, and did not lose jurisdiction simply because he\r\nordered them tried together.\"); <em>McNeny v. R.R. Comm'n of Tex.</em>, 96 S.W.2d 96, 98\r\n(Tex. Civ. App.--Austin 1936, no writ) (indicating that question of joinder is not\r\njurisdictional, and analogizing to consolidation); <em>cf. also Allison</em>, 624 S.W.2d at 568<em>\r\n</em>(indicating that joinder and consolidation rulings are reviewed for abuse of discretion). \r\nMoreover, \"[i]t is the general rule that once jurisdiction is lawfully and properly\r\nacquired, no subsequent fact or event in the particular case serves to defeat the\r\njurisdiction.\"  <em>Haginas</em>, 163 Tex. at 278, 354 S.W.2d at 371.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAccordingly, we hold that the trial court had subject-matter jurisdiction to\r\nconsolidate the forcible-detainer and tort suits, that its order consolidating them was\r\nthus not void, and that the trial court was not divested of jurisdiction over the\r\nconsolidated suit simply because the pre-consolidation suits had involved appellate\r\nand original jurisdiction, respectively.  <em>See Williams v. Carter</em>, 176 S.W.2d 580, 582\r\n(Tex. Civ. App.--Galveston 1943, writ ref'd w.o.m.) (holding that trial court did not\r\nlose jurisdiction over two suits--in one of which it exercised appellate jurisdiction,\r\nand in the other of which it exercised original jurisdiction--simply by having\r\nconsolidated them); <em>see also Montgomery</em>, 202 S.W.2d at 853 (in reviewing judgments\r\nin two cases consolidated for trial--when one suit involved trial court's appellate\r\njurisdiction, and other suit involved its original jurisdiction--stating, \"There is no lack\r\nof jurisdiction involved here, because the district court acquired jurisdiction of the\r\nissues presented in the two cases as they were filed, and did not lose jurisdiction\r\nsimply because he ordered them tried together.\").</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>\t2.\tWhether We May Consider the Propriety of Consolidation</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn rehearing, Nguyen argues that we lack jurisdiction to consider whether the\r\nconsolidation was erroneous.  Nguyen reasons as follows.  This appeal is from a\r\njudgment rendered in a suit seeking, in part, forcible-detainer relief.  In such an appeal,\r\nwe may not consider matters not essential to, dependent on, or primarily concerned\r\nwith the issue of possession.  <em>See </em>Tex. Prop. Code Ann. § 24.007.  Consolidation is\r\nessential to, dependent on, or primarily concerned with the issue of possession. \r\nAdditionally, consolidation was not a jurisdictional matter.  Accordingly, we lack\r\njurisdiction to consider the propriety of consolidating the suits.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe assume without deciding that consolidation is a matter essential to,\r\ndependent on, or primarily concerned with the issue of possession,<sup> (19)</sup> so that, if this\r\nwere an appeal from a judgment rendered in <em>just</em> a forcible-detainer suit, we would\r\nlack jurisdiction to consider it.  This is not such an appeal, however.  Rather, it is an\r\nappeal from a judgment rendered after the consolidation of a forcible-detainer suit, in\r\nwhich the county civil court at law exercised only appellate jurisdiction, and a suit for\r\ndeclarations and damages, in which that same court exercised original jurisdiction. \r\nWe have plenary appellate jurisdiction to consider challenges to matters raised by\r\npleadings invoking the county civil court at law's original jurisdiction, regardless of\r\nwhether those matters were also raised in the forcible-detainer pleadings.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn her tort-suit pleadings before consolidation, Nguyen sought a declaration that\r\nthe lease assignment from Tu to her was not a breach of the lease agreement; after\r\nconsolidation, Nguyen sought an alternative declaration that the lease assignment was\r\nvoid for having been executed under \"extreme duress\" and asserted waiver and\r\nestoppel as defenses to any breach that the lease assignment caused.  These\r\nallegations, which were asserted under and invoked the county civil court at law's\r\noriginal jurisdiction, supported the portions of the judgment declaring that the lease\r\nassignment between Tu and Nguyen did not constitute a breach and awarding Nguyen\r\npossession of the leased premises.  Because the pleadings invoking each type of\r\njurisdiction sought possession, the trial court's declarations concerning breach and its\r\naward of possession were supported by the exercise of both its original and appellate\r\njurisdiction.  That is, the judgment of possession was not unique to the forcible-detainer pleadings.  As we have said above, a forcible-detainer suit may run\r\nconcurrently with another action--even if the other action adjudicates matters that\r\ncould result in a different determination of possession--because a forcible-detainer\r\naction determines only the right to immediate possession, rather than the parties'\r\nultimate<em> </em>rights to any<em> </em>other issue.  <em>See Lopez</em>, 76 S.W.3d at 605; <em>see also Meridien\r\nHotels, Inc.</em>, 97 S.W.3d at 738 (indicating that district court's interlocutory order\r\ndeclaring that tenants had defaulted under lease, that landlord had right to terminate\r\nlease, and that tenants no longer had right to possession did not excuse justice court\r\nfrom proceeding with forcible-detainer action); <em>cf. Neller v. Kirschke</em>, 922 S.W.2d 182,\r\n187 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 1995, writ denied) (indicating that forcible-detainer court did not determine matter of breach of lease, except in order to decide\r\nthat landlord was entitled to immediate possession, so that plaintiff-landlord in\r\nseparate suit for breach of lease was not entitled to judgment as matter of law on issue\r\nof breach); <em>Valencia v. Garza</em>, 765 S.W.2d 893, 899 (Tex. App.--San Antonio 1989,\r\nno writ) (holding that forcible-entry judgment was not res judicata as to possession in\r\nseparate suit alleging claims on contract for sale); <em>Buttery v. Bush</em>, 575 S.W.2d 144,\r\n146 (Tex. Civ. App.--Tyler 1978, writ ref'd n.r.e.) (holding that forcible-entry\r\njudgment was not res judicata as in separate suit seeking declaration of parties rights\r\nunder lease agreement and that lease agreement was void).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAccordingly, we hold that, under the pleadings in this case, we have jurisdiction\r\nto review the propriety of the consolidation order.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>\t3.\tWhether Consolidation Was Error</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAlthough HKDI and Duong challenge the consolidation as being only\r\nfundamental error, we liberally construe their brief as alternatively arguing that the\r\nconsolidation was simple error.  <em>See </em>Tex. R. App. P. 38.1(e), 38.9; <em>Sterner v. Marathon\r\nOil Co.</em>, 767 S.W.2d 686, 690 (Tex. 1989) (\"[I]t is our practice to construe liberally\r\npoints of error in order to obtain a just, fair and equitable adjudication of the rights of\r\nthe litigants.\").</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe conclude that consolidation in these circumstances constitutes error. \r\nForcible-detainer suits are intended to provide a speedy, summary, and inexpensive\r\ndetermination of the right to immediate possession, and the rules accomplish this goal\r\nby allowing the parties to litigate only limited matters.  <em>See, e.g.</em>,<em> Meridien Hotels, Inc.</em>,\r\n97 S.W.3d at 737; <em>see also </em>Tex. R. Civ. P. 739, 740, 745, 746, 748, 749.  This object\r\nis thwarted by allowing through consolidation what is not allowed through assertion\r\nof claims in the forcible-detainer suit itself.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThere is authority to support our conclusion.  In <em>Texas-Mexican Railway Co.\r\nv. Cahill</em>, a forcible-detainer suit was initiated in justice court, and appeal was taken\r\nto the county's district court.<sup> (20)</sup>  <em>See id.</em>, 23 S.W. 232, 232 (Tex. Civ. App.--Galveston\r\n1893, writ ref'd).  In overruling the appellant's challenge to the denial of its motion\r\nto consolidate the forcible-detainer suit with another suit involving the same appellee\r\npending in the same court, this Court explained, in pertinent part:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t[T]he motion to consolidate was properly refused.  The appellee's suit,\r\nas we have seen, was brought under the statute which provides a remedy \r\nfor the recovery of the possession of real estate when the premises are in\r\nthe quiet occupancy of one, and they are forcibly entered by another, or\r\nwhere a lessee, after the expiration of his lease, refuses to restore\r\npossession to his lessor.  The statute provides a speedy and efficient\r\nremedy for restoring possession to him who is wrongfully deprived of the\r\nsame, and no inquiry as to the title to, or the superior right of either party\r\nto the suit or that of any third person in, the property, is permitted.<em>  The\r\n[other suit] was a suit of trespass to try title to the lot in question.  To\r\npermit the consolidation of such suits would be contrary to the obvious\r\npolicy of the law, and in most cases defeat the object of the statute,--the\r\nprompt adjudication of the right of possession to the premises, without\r\nreference to the right of title to the property.</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><em>Id.</em> at 232 (emphasis added).  We follow the reasoning and conclusion of our Court in\r\n<em>Cahill </em>to hold in this case that the trial court erred in consolidating the tort suit and the\r\nforcible-detainer suit.<sup> (21)</sup>  <em>See id.</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tHKDI and Duong opposed the consolidation.  Although the standard of review\r\nfor consolidation orders is abuse of discretion,<sup> (22)</sup> the trial court necessarily abused its\r\ndiscretion here by acting contrary to the law.  <em>See Walker</em>, 827 S.W.2d at 840.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>\t4.</strong>\t<strong>Whether the Error Was Harmful or Rendered Moot</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tTexas Rule of Appellate Procedure 44.1 provides:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t(a)\t<em>Standard for Reversible Error.</em>   No judgment may be reversed on appeal\r\non the ground that the trial court made an error of law unless the court of\r\nappeals concludes that the error complained of:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t(1)\tprobably caused the rendition of an improper judgment; or</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t(2)\tprobably prevented the appellant from properly presenting\r\nthe case to the court of appeals.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Tex. R. App. P. 44.1.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tFrom the perspective of the forcible-detainer plaintiff, the harm arising from\r\nhaving to participate in a jury trial before one can obtain what is supposed to be an\r\ninexpensive, speedy, and summary ruling on the right to immediate possession is\r\nevident.  HKDI filed the forcible-detainer suit in July 2003, immediately confessed\r\njudgment, and appealed to the county court.  Nguyen asserted her tort counter-claims,\r\ncross-claims, and third-party claims and request for declaratory relief on October 3,\r\n2003.  The trial court consolidated the two suits that same month, implicitly overruling\r\nHKDI's motion to strike or to sever Nguyen's tort claims against HKDI and Duong\r\nin the forcible-detainer suit.  Trial did not begin until December 2, and it ended on\r\nDecember 11; there were seven days of trial proceedings.  The trial court did not\r\nrender judgment adjudicating the right to possession until April 30, 2004.  This\r\nsignificant delay in determining the mere right to immediate possession was caused\r\nby the consideration of tort claims over which the trial court, to the extent that it\r\nexercised its appellate jurisdiction in the forcible-detainer suit, lacked subject-matter\r\njurisdiction, when the issue should have been decided inexpensively, speedily, and\r\nsummarily.  <em>See, e.g.</em>,<em> Meridien Hotels, Inc.</em>, 97 S.W.3d at 737; <em>see also </em>Tex. R. Civ.\r\nP. 739, 740, 745, 746, 748, 749.  Therefore, the error in consolidating the two causes\r\nwas harmful at the time that the order was rendered.<em>  See </em>Tex. R. App. P. 44.1.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span></span><span>\tBut the consolidated case then proceeded to trial and to final judgment, in part\r\nupon pleadings invoking the court's original jurisdiction.  The pleadings invoking the\r\ntrial court's original jurisdiction sought a declaration that the lease assignment\r\nbetween Nguyen and Tu did not breach the lease agreement with HKDI; the same\r\npleadings alternatively sought a declaration that the lease assignment was void for\r\nhaving been executed under \"extreme duress\" and asserted waiver and estoppel as\r\ndefenses to any breach that the lease assignment had caused.  These allegations, which\r\nwere asserted under and invoked the trial court's original jurisdiction, supported the\r\nportion of the judgment declaring that the lease assignment was not a breach <em>and\r\nawarding Nguyen possession of the leased premises</em>.  That is, the trial court's final\r\njudgment was an adjudication not of the right to <em>immediate </em>possession, but of the\r\n<em>ultimate </em>right to possession based on the declaratory requests and affirmative defenses\r\nasserted under its original jurisdiction.  Put another way, the trial court, in effect,\r\ncompletely denied HKDI's request for a determination of the right to immediate\r\npossession and instead determined the ultimate question of who was entitled to\r\npossession.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tEven though a forcible-detainer judgment adjudicates the right to immediate\r\npossession, that determination can later be altered if a judgment, in a separate suit\r\nadjudicating the parties' rights to other issues involving the real property, results in\r\na different determination of possession.  <em>See Lopez</em>, 76 S.W.3d at 605; <em>see also\r\nMeridien Hotels, Inc.</em>, 97 S.W.3d at 738 (indicating that district court's interlocutory\r\norder declaring that tenants had defaulted under lease, that landlord had right to\r\nterminate lease, and that tenants no longer had right to possession did not excuse\r\njustice court from proceeding with forcible-detainer action).  Accordingly, under the\r\npleadings in this case, the harm that HKDI suffered by the delay of what should have\r\nbeen a speedy determination of the right to immediate possession was mooted when\r\na final judgment, under the trial court's exercise of original jurisdiction and on matters\r\ndetermining the ultimate issue of possession, was rendered.  Put another way, even if\r\nHKDI could somehow obtain an adjudication of the right to immediate possession at\r\nthis time, that determination would be moot because the parties' ultimate rights have\r\nalready been adjudicated and possession has already been awarded based on those\r\nrights.<sup> (23)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThat is not to say that parties in HKDI's position have no remedy.  A party\r\nharmed by the trial court's total denial of a speedy determination of the right to\r\nimmediate possession may seek, by mandamus when the complained-of ruling occurs\r\nor before it becomes moot, that the court be ordered to adjudicate that right despite the\r\npendency of another suit that could ultimately lead to a different determination of\r\npossession for the same property.  Here, HKDI could have sought mandamus relief\r\nfrom the consolidation order before final judgment in the consolidated suit was\r\nrendered: HKDI would have had no adequate remedy by appeal after final judgment\r\nbecause (1) the rendition of that judgment, under these pleadings, would have mooted\r\na determination of the right to immediate possession and (2) under <em>Cahill</em>, the\r\nconsolidation of the forcible-detainer and tort suits was a clear abuse of discretion. \r\n<em>See In re Prudential Ins. Co. of Am.</em>, 148 S.W.3d 124, 135-36 (Tex. 2004) (holding\r\nthat mandamus relief is proper only to correct clear abuse of discretion when there is\r\nno adequate remedy by appeal</span><span></span><span>); <em>In re Van Waters &amp; Rogers, Inc.</em>, 145 S.W.3d 203,\r\n211 (Tex. 2004) (noting that, although mandamus will ordinarily not issue to correct\r\nerroneous consolidation, writ will issue if \"'extraordinary circumstances' are present\r\nthat make an ordinary appeal inadequate,\" such as when \"the appellate court would not\r\nbe able to cure the error, [or] when the party's ability to present a viable claim . . . is\r\nvitiated . . . .\") (quoting <em>Canadian Helicopters Ltd. v.

Meridien Hotels, Inc.</em>, 97 S.W.3d at 738-39 (holding that county\r\ncourt did not abuse discretion in issuing mandamus writ ordering justice court to\r\nvacate its order abating forcible-detainer proceedings when justice court abated its suit\r\nsolely to allow district court--which had declared that tenants had defaulted under\r\nlease, that landlord had right to terminate lease, and that tenants no longer had right\r\nto possession--to finalize judgment there; also holding that no adequate remedy at law\r\nexisted for justice court's interlocutory abatement order).  But at this point--upon\r\nthese pleadings, this judgment, and these facts--the harm that HKDI suffered from the\r\ndeprivation of its right to a speedy determination of immediate possession is moot.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe overrule this portion of issue one.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>D.\tPersonal Jurisdiction Over Duong</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn the remainder of issue one, HKDI and Duong also argue that, because\r\nNguyen never served Duong in the <em>forcible-detainer</em> suit before consolidation, and\r\nbecause she excluded him from the last amended petition in that suit, the trial court\r\nlacked personal jurisdiction over Duong to render judgment against him for tortious\r\ninterference in the <em>consolidated </em>suit.  Accordingly, HKDI and Duong argue that the\r\nfinal judgment rendered in the consolidated suit was void with respect to Duong.  We\r\nmay consider this challenge, even though it relates to the pre-consolidation forcible-detainer suit's pleadings, because it concerns personal jurisdiction over Duong, rather\r\nthan the issue of possession.  <em>Cf.

Such a no-evidence challenge will be\r\nsustained when \"'(a) there is a complete absence of evidence of a vital fact, (b) the\r\ncourt is barred by rules of law or of evidence from giving weight to the only evidence\r\noffered to prove a vital fact, (c) the evidence offered to prove a vital fact is no more\r\nthan a mere scintilla, or (d) the evidence conclusively establishes the opposite of the\r\nvital fact.'\"  <em>King Ranch, Inc. v.

Jury question number 6 reflected this theory by instructing the\r\njury that \"[Duong] cannot be held liable <em>for inducing [HKDI] to violate a contractual\r\nobligation</em> if he acted in good faith and believed what he did was for the best interest\r\nof [HKDI].\"  (Emphasis added.)  The jury was never asked whether Tu had tortiously\r\ninterfered with any of Nguyen's contracts.  The jury also expressly found that HKDI\r\nhad conspired with Duong and that Tu had not, and it implicitly found that the focus\r\nof Duong and HKDI's conspiracy was Duong's tortious interference with Nguyen's\r\nlease agreement with HKDI.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tUnder part of issue three, HKDI and Duong argue, among other things, that the\r\ntrial court erred in rendering judgment on Nguyen's claim for tortious interference\r\nwith contractual relations against Duong because Duong was HKDI's corporate officer\r\nand agent and thus, as a matter of law, could not have tortiously interfered with the\r\nlease agreement between Nguyen and HKDI.<sup> (25)</sup>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\"The elements of tortious interference with a contract are: (1) the existence of\r\na contract subject to interference; (2) willful and intentional interference; (3)\r\ninterference that proximately caused damage; and (4) actual damage or loss.\"  <em>Powell\r\nIndus., Inc. v. Allen</em>, 985 S.W.2d 455, 456 (Tex. 1998).  \"When the defendant is both\r\na corporate agent and the third party who allegedly induces the corporation's breach,\r\nthe second element is particularly important.\"  <em>Id.</em> at 456-57.  \"Because a corporate\r\nofficer's acts on the corporation's behalf usually are deemed corporate acts, a plaintiff\r\nmust show that the agent acted <em>solely</em> in his own interests.\"  <em>Id.</em>  (Emphasis added.) \r\n\"The plaintiff must prove that the agent acted willfully and intentionally to serve the\r\nagent's personal interests <em>at the corporation's expense</em>.\"  <em>Id.</em>  (Emphasis added.)  \"A\r\ncorporate officer's mixed motives--to benefit both himself and the corporation--are\r\ninsufficient to establish liability.\"  <em>Id.</em>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\"[W]hen determining whether an agent acted against the corporation's interests,\r\nwe consider the corporation's evaluation of the agent's actions.\"  <em>Id.  </em>We do so\r\nbecause \"[a] corporation is a better judge of its own best interests than a jury or court.\" \r\n<em>Id.</em>  Although a complaint by the principal about its agent's actions does not\r\nconclusively show that the agent acted against its principal's interest, \"if a corporation\r\ndoes not complain about its agent's actions, then the agent cannot be held to have\r\nacted contrary to the corporation's interests.\"  <em>Id.</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDuong was the president, shareholder, and owner of HKDI.  He signed the lease\r\nagreement with Nguyen and Tu on behalf of HKDI.  Nguyen's counsel's questions at\r\ntrial repeatedly equated Duong with HKDI.  Duong testified that he believed that it\r\nwas in the best interest of HKDI to terminate the lease agreement.  Nguyen testified\r\nthat Duong had threatened to evict Nguyen if she testified adversely to Tu's brother,\r\nwho was a friend of Duong's, in her divorce case.  Nguyen's attorney argued in\r\nclosing that Duong's threat showed a \"purely personal\" vendetta that \"ha[d] nothing\r\nto do with [HKDI] or the business or the corporation,\" but he also argued that HKDI\r\n\"c[a]me back and ratified [Duong's] acts, so they're going to be responsible for what\r\nhe did.\"  He further argued in closing that Duong's tortious interference with the lease\r\nagreement was \"for personal reasons.\"  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe above is no evidence that Duong acted solely in his own interest and\r\nagainst HKDI's interests.  Importantly, we have found no evidence--and Nguyen has\r\ndirected us to none--that HKDI objected to Duong's instigating the eviction or that\r\nHKDI's interests lay elsewhere than in evicting Nguyen and Tu.  Indeed, Nguyen's\r\nattorney argued to the jury that HKDI ratified Duong's acts and that that ratification\r\nmade HKDI liable for Duong's acts; moreover, HKDI has consistently remained the\r\nplaintiff in the forcible-detainer suit to evict Nguyen and Tu.  Accordingly, we hold\r\nthat legally insufficient evidence supports the jury's finding that Duong was liable for\r\ntortious interference.  We thus hold that the trial court erred by denying HKDI and\r\nDuong's motion for directed verdict and by overruling their objection to the\r\nsubmission of the jury question on liability for this cause of action.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe sustain this portion of issue three.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>\t\tb.\tCivil Conspiracy</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tNguyen pleaded that all three appellants conspired to evict her.  The conspiracy\r\ncharge was not expressly predicated on a liability question for an underlying wrong;\r\nnonetheless, the only underlying wrong for which damages were assessed was\r\nDuong's tortious interference, so that Duong's tortious interference could have been\r\nthe only basis for conspiracy and thus for HKDI's liability.  Because the claim against\r\nDuong for tortious interference was the only underlying cause of action for which\r\nactual damages were awarded and that could have supported a claim for civil\r\nconspiracy against HKDI or Duong, and because the tortious-interference claim\r\nagainst Duong failed as a matter of law for the reasons stated above, HKDI and Duong\r\nargue, under part of issue three, that the trial court erred in rendering judgment against\r\nthem on Nguyen's civil-conspiracy claim.<sup> (26)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t</span><span>\"Civil conspiracy, generally defined as a combination of two or more persons\r\nto accomplish an unlawful purpose, or to accomplish a lawful purpose by unlawful\r\nmeans, might be called a derivative tort\" because the \"defendant's liability for\r\nconspiracy <em>depends on participation in some underlying tort </em>for which the plaintiff\r\nseeks to hold at least one of the named defendants liable.\"  <em>Tilton v.

We have already sustained HKDI and Duong's legal-sufficiency challenge to the jury's finding that Duong was liable for tortious\r\ninterference.  If there is no underlying wrong or object (here, tortious interference),\r\nthen there can be no conspiracy.  <em>See </em></span><span><em>Tri</em>, 162 S.W.3d at 556; <em>Tilton</em>, 925 S.W.2d at\r\n681.  </span><span>Accordingly, we hold that legally insufficient evidence supports the jury's\r\nfindings that HKDI and Duong were part of a conspiracy that damaged Nguyen.<sup> (27)</sup>  We\r\nthus hold that the trial court erred by implicitly denying what we have construed as\r\nHKDI and Duong's pre-judgment motion for JNOV or to disregard jury findings, by\r\noverruling their directed verdict on this ground, and by rendering judgment for\r\nNguyen on this claim.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe sustain this portion of issue three.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>\t\tc.\tActual Damages</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tUnder part of issue three, HKDI and Duong first argue that the trial court erred\r\nas a matter of law in rendering judgment for $15,312.58 in actual damages--which\r\nrepresented the mental-anguish damages that Nguyen elected to recover, plus\r\ninterest--because those damages were predicated on an affirmative finding that Duong\r\nwas liable for tortious interference, which predicate failed as a matter of law for the\r\nreasons stated above.<sup> (28)</sup>  Alternatively, HKDI and Duong argue that no evidence\r\nsupports the jury's assessment of mental-anguish damages because the relevant\r\nevidence does not demonstrate the type of high degree of mental suffering required to\r\nobtain this type of damages.<sup> (29)</sup>  Finally, HKDI and Duong argue that the jury's award\r\nof $49,266.66 in costs of defending her right to possession cannot support the actual\r\ndamages awarded because Nguyen elected to receive and was awarded attorney's fees,\r\nwhich, if she were also awarded the costs of defending possession, would constitute\r\na double recovery.<sup> (30)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tJury question 7, the sole question concerning actual damages, was predicated\r\non an affirmative answer to jury question 6, concerning Duong's tortious interference\r\nwith contract.  It was not predicated on jury questions 8 or 9, concerning civil\r\nconspiracy.<sup> (31)</sup>  We have already held that legally insufficient evidence supports the\r\njury's determination that Duong tortiously interfered with the lease assignment--the\r\nsole predicate to the jury's actual damages determination.  Accordingly, we hold that\r\nlegally insufficient evidence supports the jury's actual-damages findings (both mental-anguish damages and those for right to defend possession).  We thus hold that the trial\r\ncourt erred by implicitly denying what we have construed as HKDI and Duong's pre-judgment motion for JNOV or to disregard jury findings and by rendering judgment\r\nfor Nguyen for any amount of actual damages.  We thus need not reach HKDI and\r\nDuong's remaining legal-sufficiency challenges to the award of actual damages.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe sustain this portion of issue three.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t<strong>d.</strong>\t<strong>Malice and Punitive Damages</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tUnder part of issue three, HKDI and Duong also argue that, because legally\r\ninsufficient evidence exists of the only actual damages that Nguyen elected to\r\nrecover--mental-anguish damages--and because punitive damages cannot be awarded\r\nabsent the award of actual damages, the trial court erred in assessing punitive damages\r\nagainst HKDI and Duong.<sup> (32)</sup>  HKDI and Duong further argue that the trial court erred\r\nin assessing punitive damages against HKDI because the jury was not asked to find\r\nthat HKDI had acted with malice, so that there was no predicate finding against HKDI\r\nthat would have allowed punitive damages.<sup> (33)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tJury question 15, concerning punitive damages against Duong, was predicated\r\non an affirmative finding on jury question 11, which asked if Duong's malice had\r\ncaused Nguyen damages.  Jury question 16, concerning punitive damages against\r\nHKDI, was likewise predicated on an affirmative finding on jury question 11, which\r\nasked if Duong's malice had caused Nguyen damages.  The jury charge contained no\r\nquestion concerning whether HKDI had acted with malice or whether that malice had\r\nharmed Nguyen.  Jury question 11, concerning Duong's malice, was predicated on an\r\naffirmative finding to jury question 8, which asked the jury whether Duong had  been\r\npart of a conspiracy that damaged Nguyen.  The only actual-damages question was\r\njury question number 7, which was predicated on an affirmative answer to jury\r\nquestion number 6, concerning Duong's tortious interference; the actual-damages\r\nquestion was not predicated on jury questions 8 or 9, concerning civil conspiracy.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe first sustain HKDI and Duong's challenge to the assessment of punitive\r\ndamages against HKDI.  </span><span>Under the statute applicable to this case, exemplary damages\r\ncould be awarded only if Nguyen proved by clear and convincing evidence that the\r\nharm with respect to which she sought recovery of exemplary damages<em> </em>resulted from\r\n(in addition to situations irrelevant here) malice.  <em>See </em>Act of Apr. 11, 1995, 74th Leg.,\r\nR.S., ch. 19, § 1, 1995 Tex.

The jury was\r\nasked to find malice for Duong and Tu, but not for HKDI.  In the charge, the court\r\nsubmitted separate liability and punitive-damages questions for Duong and HKDI,\r\nindicating that when it submitted questions concerning Duong, the court meant Duong\r\nin his individual capacity, rather than in his representative capacity.  Accordingly, the\r\njury was never asked to find that HKDI (<em>i.e.</em>, Duong acting in his representative\r\ncapacity) acted with malice, a necessary predicate to obtaining punitive damages\r\nagainst HKDI.  <em>See </em>Act of Apr. 11, 1995, 74th Leg., R.S., ch. 19, 1995 Tex. Gen. Laws\r\n108, 110 (amended 2003).  The trial court thus erred in awarding punitive damages\r\nagainst HKDI.  <em>See id.</em>;<em> Akin v. Dahl</em>, 661 S.W.2d 917, 921-22 (Tex. 1983) (holding\r\nthat finding of civil conspiracy, when object of that conspiracy is tort of which malice\r\nis element, suffices to make co-conspirators subject to punitive damages even without\r\nseparate malice finding; further indicating, however, that when \"object of the\r\nconspiracy is an unlawful tort, such as negligence, which did not contain wanton\r\nbehavior, malice, or their progeny as an element of the cause of action, then that\r\nadditional finding [of malice] would be necessary as to each co-conspirator against\r\nwhom exemplary damages were sought.\").</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe also sustain </span><span>HKDI and Duong's challenge to the assessment of punitive\r\ndamages against </span><span>Duong.  For the reasons stated earlier, we have already held that the\r\ntrial court erred in rendering judgment for actual damages for Duong's tortious\r\ninterference.<sup> (34)</sup>  The trial court thus erred in awarding punitive damages against Duong. \r\n<em>See Juliette Fowler Homes, Inc. v.

The trial court, in\r\nrendering judgment awarding Nguyen the fees that the jury found, recited, \"[Nguyen],\r\nas the prevailing party, is entitled to recover attorney's fees under the Declaratory\r\nJudgment Act and section 24.006 of the Texas Property Code.\"  Under issue three,\r\nHKDI and Duong argue that the trial court erred as a matter of law in rendering\r\njudgment for the attorney's fees that the jury found because (1) recovery of actual\r\ndamages is a prerequisite to recovering attorney's fees; (2) the Declaratory Judgment\r\nAct (\"DJA\") did not support the award of attorney's fees because the declaratory\r\njudgment that Nguyen sought in her pre-consolidation tort suit duplicated the relief\r\nsought by HKDI and Duong in the pre-consolidation forcible-detainer suit; and (3)\r\nNguyen did not segregate her attorney's fees.<sup> (35)</sup>  HKDI and Duong preserved these\r\narguments in their motion for directed verdict, their objections to the charge, and their\r\nobjections to Nguyen's motion for entry of judgment and their own motion for entry\r\nof judgment, which we have construed as motions for JNOV or to disregard the\r\nverdict.<sup> (37)</sup></span><span><em>  See Cecil v.

Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann.\r\n§ 37.003(a) (Vernon 1997) (emphasis added).  The DJA also provides that \"the court\r\nmay award costs and reasonable and necessary attorney's fees as are equitable and\r\njust.\"  <em>Id.</em> § 37.009 (Vernon 1997).  The only requirements that the statute provides are\r\nthat the fees be reasonable and necessary and that their award be equitable and just. \r\n<em>See id</em>.  One need not even be the prevailing party or seek affirmative relief to be\r\nawarded attorney's fees under the DJA, as long as the award of fees is equitable and\r\njust.  <em>See Save Our Springs Alliance, Inc. v. Lazy Nine Mun. Util. Dist. ex rel. Bd. of\r\nDirs.</em>, 198 S.W.3d 300, 318 (Tex.

For this reason, and because the DJA authorizes relief in the form of a\r\ndeclaration (rather than damages), the DJA claimant obviously need not recover\r\ndamages to be entitled to recover attorney's fees under that statute.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe overrule this challenge under issue three.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>\t\t\tii.\tRecovery under the DJA</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tUnder part of issue three, HKDI and Duong also argue that the trial court could\r\nnot award attorney's fees under the DJA because the declaratory judgment that\r\nNguyen sought in her pre-consolidation tort suit duplicated the relief sought by HKDI\r\nin the pre-consolidation forcible-detainer suit.  Specifically, HKDI and Duong argue\r\nthat the forcible-detainer allegations \"resolved the issues of duress and the\r\napplicability of the Lease's anti-assignment clause,\" so that Nguyen's DJA request\r\nwas merely redundant of what would have been determined in the forcible-detainer\r\nsuit.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn the pre-consolidation tort suit, Nguyen pleaded for alternative declarations\r\nthat (1) the lease assignment did not breach the lease agreement and (2) the lease\r\nassignment was void for having been executed under duress.  In the pre-consolidation\r\nforcible-detainer suit, HKDI alleged that the lease assignment was a default under the\r\nlease agreement.  These allegations were joined upon consolidation.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe DJA allows the trial court to award reasonable and necessary attorney's fees\r\nas are equitable and just.  Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. § 37.009 (Vernon\r\n1997).  However, \"[a] declaratory judgment action may not be used <em>solely</em> to obtain\r\nattorney's fees that are <em>not otherwise </em>authorized by statute or to settle disputes <em>already\r\npending </em>before a court.\"  <em>Southwest Guar. Trust Co. v. Hardy Rd. 13.4 Joint Venture</em>,\r\n981 S.W.2d 951, 956 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 1998, pet. denied) (emphasis\r\nadded).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe hold that Nguyen's DJA request was not merely redundant of the issues\r\nlitigated in the forcible-detainer suit, so that fees would be unavailable to Nguyen. \r\nFirst, Nguyen filed the tort suit before HKDI filed the forcible-detainer suit, and she\r\nsought declaratory relief in her original petition in the tort suit.  Only afterwards did\r\nHKDI, not Nguyen, initiate forcible-detainer proceedings.  And later still, the trial\r\ncourt consolidated the proceedings.  This sequence of events demonstrates that\r\nNguyen did not allege declaratory relief solely to obtain fees that were not otherwise\r\nauthorized (indeed, at the time that she filed the tort suit, the DJA clearly authorized\r\nthose fees) or to settle disputes that were already pending before the court.  HKDI and\r\nDuong do not explain how consolidation would retroactively render Nguyen's prior\r\nrequest for declaratory relief a mere subterfuge for obtaining fees.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tSecond, and in any event, the court in a forcible-detainer suit often (as here)\r\nconstrues a lease and considers breaches of or defenses to lease provisions, but it does\r\nso only as part of determining which party has the <em>superior right to immediate\r\npossession</em>.  </span><span><em>See Ward</em>, 115 S.W.3d at 270.  It does not determine the parties' ultimate\r\nrights to any other issue<em> </em>in controversy relating to the particular realty.  <em>Lopez</em>, 76\r\nS.W.3d at 605.  For these reasons, a forcible-detainer suit may run concurrently with\r\nanother action in another court--even if the other action adjudicates matters that could\r\nresult in a different determination of possession from that rendered in the forcible-detainer suit.  <em>See Villalon</em>, 176 S.W.3d at 70-71.  This last concept has been extended\r\nto other suits in which declaratory relief is sought.  <em>Cf. Meridien Hotels, Inc.</em>, 97\r\nS.W.3d at 738.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIf a suit to declare the parties' rights under a lease can be maintained\r\nsimultaneously with a forcible-detainer suit--even when the forcible-detainer court\r\nmay simultaneously be considering the same rights under the same lease--then it is\r\nhard to imagine that the claimant in the separate DJA suit could not obtain attorney's\r\nfees simply because a forcible-detainer suit was on-going.  It is even harder to imagine\r\nthat the DJA claimant could not obtain attorney's fees when her suit preceded the\r\nforcible-detainer action.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe overrule this challenge under issue three.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>\t\t\tiii.\tFailure to Segregate</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAlso under part of issue three, HKDI and Duong argue that the trial court erred\r\nin rendering judgment on the jury's verdict for attorney's fees because Nguyen failed\r\nto segregate the fees attributable to those claims for which fees were recoverable from\r\nthose for which they were not.

Additionally, she\r\nprevailed in the forcible-detainer matter by having been awarded possession, entitling\r\nher to attorney's fees for counsel's work relating to the forcible-detainer allegations. \r\n<em>See</em></span><span> <em>W. Anderson Plaza v. Feyznia</em> 876 S.W.2d 528, 537 (Tex. App.--Austin 1994, no\r\nwrit).</span><span>  But Nguyen also asserted claims for conspiracy, tortious interference with\r\ncontract, wrongful eviction (though that claim did not go to the jury), and unfair\r\ncompetition (which also did not go to the jury) and sought punitive damages and\r\nindemnity.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tNeither party indicates where in the record Nguyen proved her attorney's fees,\r\nbut what testimony we have found proving Nguyen's attorney's fees does not\r\nsegregate those incurred for work done in prosecuting Nguyen's DJA request and\r\ndefending the forcible-detainer allegations, for which fees were recoverable,<sup> (38)</sup> and for\r\nwork done in prosecuting Nguyen's tort claims, for which fees were not recoverable.<sup> (39)</sup> \r\nNguyen does not deny that her expert did not segregate her attorney's fees among\r\ncauses of action and defenses, but instead invokes an exception to the requirement:\r\nthat her claims, counter-claims, and third-party claims in both pre-consolidation suits\r\nand in the consolidated suit were inextricably intertwined, so that her expert did not\r\nneed to segregate fees among claims.  In support, Nguyen does not rely on her own\r\nexpert's testimony that the claims were so inextricably intertwined that they cannot be\r\nsegregated; rather, she relies on the following questioning, by HKDI and Duong's\r\ncounsel</span><span>, of the expert testifying to <em>Tu's</em> attorney's fees:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tCounsel:\t\tIs it possible for you to segregate out fees that are\r\nassociated with defending the [forcible-detainer]\r\nmatter . . . versus the claims made by [Nguyen]?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tTu's Expert:\tThe matters are inextricably intertwined and cannot\r\nbe segregated out.

This rule is not without an exception.  But that exception\r\nhas changed over time.  At the time of trial in this cause, as well as when the parties\r\nbriefed this appeal, the following exception to the segregation-of-fees requirement\r\nexisted:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA recognized exception to this duty to segregate arises when the\r\nattorney's fees rendered are in connection with claims arising out of the\r\nsame transaction and are so interrelated that their \"prosecution or defense\r\nentails proof or denial of essentially the same facts.\"  Therefore, when the\r\ncauses of action involved in the suit are dependent upon the same set of\r\nfacts or circumstances and thus are \"intertwined to the point of being\r\ninseparable,\" the party suing for attorney's fees may recover the entire\r\namount covering all claims. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><em>Sterling</em>, 822 S.W.2d at 11-12 (quoting <em>Gill Sav. Ass'n v. Chair King, Inc.</em>, 783\r\nS.W.2d 674, 680 (Tex. App.--Houston [14th Dist.] 1989), <em>modified</em>, 797 S.W.2d 31\r\n(Tex. 1990)) and <em>Flint &amp; Assoc. v. Intercontinental Pipe &amp; Steel, Inc.</em>, 739 S.W.2d\r\n622, 624-25 (Tex. App.--Dallas 1987, writ denied)), <em>modified by</em> <em>Chapa</em>, 212 S.W.3d\r\nat 314.  It is this exception that Nguyen invoked here and below.  However, the\r\nexception was modified during pendency of this appeal:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><em>\tIntertwined facts </em>do not make tort [attorney's] fees recoverable; it is only\r\nwhen <em>discrete legal services </em>advance both a recoverable and\r\nunrecoverable claim that they are so intertwined that they need not be\r\nsegregated.  We modify <em>Sterling</em> to that extent.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><em>Chapa</em>, 212 S.W.3d at 313-14 (emphasis added).</span><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tRegardless of which standard applies to our review of this case, we hold that\r\nNguyen did not carry her burden of demonstrating that the exception to the\r\nsegregation-of-fees duty applied.  Under the former standard of <em>Sterling</em>, Tu's expert's\r\ntestimony that <em>Tu's</em> attorney's fees could not be segregated because her defense to the\r\nforcible-detainer suit was inextricably intertwined with her defense against Nguyen's\r\ntort claims is one thing; expert testimony concerning <em>Nguyen's</em> attorney's fees is\r\nanother.  Moreover, Tu's expert's testimony compared <em>the torts or claims that Nguyen\r\nasserted against her</em> (conspiracy, unfair competition, breach of fiduciary duty,\r\nindemnity, and tortious interference with contract) with matters relevant to the\r\nforcible-detainer proceeding.  That testimony did not also consider whether the tort\r\nthat Nguyen had asserted only against HKDI (wrongful eviction), her seeking\r\ninjunctive relief to prevent HKDI from evicting her, her seeking injunctive relief\r\nagainst HKDI and Duong's law firm for having contacted her allegedly in violation\r\nof disciplinary rules, and the matters related to Nguyen's defense against HKDI and\r\nDuong's counter-claim for sanctions were inextricably intertwined with Nguyen's\r\nclaims and defenses for which fees were recoverable.  Additionally, Tu's counsel's\r\ntestimony is conclusory.  And under the new standard of <em>Chapa</em>, whether the claims\r\nwere inextricably intertwined is not the test: rather, the test is whether <em>discrete legal\r\nservices </em>advance both a claim or defense for which fees are recoverable and a claim\r\nor defense for which fees are unrecoverable that fees need not be segregated.  <em>See id.</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe sustain this portion of issue three.  When an appellate court sustains a\r\nchallenge that attorney's fees were not properly segregated, the remedy is to sever that\r\nportion of the judgment awarding attorney's fees and to remand the cause for the issue\r\nto be relitigated.  <em>See Sterling</em>, 822 S.W.2d at 11-12; <em>accord</em> <em>Chapa</em>, 212 S.W.3d at\r\n314; <em>see also</em> <em>Brown v. Traylor</em>, 210 S.W.3d 648, 659-60 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st\r\nDist.] 2006, no pet.) (holding that amount of attorney's fees was issue that was\r\nseparable under Tex. R. App. P. 44.1(b) and that thus could be remanded for trial on\r\nthat sole issue).  On remand, the standard established by the Texas Supreme Court in\r\n<em>Chapa</em> for segregating attorney's fees will apply.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>F.\tTrial and Post-Trial Amendment of Pleadings</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn pertinent part, HKDI and Duong phrase their issue two as follows: \"The court\r\nwill decide if the trial court properly granted Nguyen leave to amend or supplement\r\nher pleadings after trial to inject [the] new, immaterial, and prejudicial\" affirmative\r\ndefenses of waiver and estoppel.  We have jurisdiction to consider this challenge\r\nbecause it does not relate solely to the forcible-detainer pleadings.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe focus of HKDI and Duong's brief is almost entirely on waiver and estoppel. \r\nHowever, the jury answered in the affirmative that the failure to obtain HKDI's written\r\nconsent to the lease assignment was \"excused\" by waiver, estoppel, <em>and duress</em>.  The\r\ntrial court's judgment recited, \"The Court finds that . . . the lease agreement was not\r\nbreached by [Nguyen and Tu's] compliance with a Court Ordered assignment of [Tu's]\r\nlease interest in relation to the dissolution of their partnership . . . ,\" which appears to\r\nhave been applying a variation of Nguyen's defensive theory of duress.  The final\r\njudgment also awarded Nguyen possession.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\"Generally speaking, an appellant must attack all independent bases or grounds\r\nthat fully support a complained-of ruling or judgment.\"  <em>Britton v. Tex. Dep't of\r\nCriminal Justice</em>, 95 S.W.3d 676, 681 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 2002, no pet.). \r\nThis rule exists because \"if an independent ground fully supports the complained-of\r\nruling or judgment, but the appellant assigns no error to that independent ground, then\r\n(1) we must accept the validity of that unchallenged independent ground . . . and thus\r\n(2) any error in the grounds challenged on appeal is harmless because the\r\nunchallenged independent ground fully supports the complained-of ruling or\r\njudgment.\"  <em>Id.</em> (citation omitted).  For example, \"when independent jury findings fully\r\nsupport a judgment, an appellant must attack each independent jury finding to obtain\r\na reversal.\"  <em>Id.</em> at 682.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tGiven the phrasing of their issue, the fact that its focus is on the propriety of\r\ngranting Nguyen leave to amend her petition, and that the affirmative defense of\r\nduress had already been pleaded before trial (and so did not require a trial\r\namendment), HKDI and Duong have not challenged the jury's finding that duress\r\nexcused the lease assignment without consent.<sup> (40)</sup>  Under this charge, the jury's finding\r\nof duress supports, by itself, the judgment of possession rendered.  Accordingly, any\r\nerror in allowing Nguyen belatedly to amend her petition to assert the other affirmative\r\ndefenses of waiver and estoppel is harmless as a matter of law.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe overrule issue two.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong><center>Tu's Appeal</center></strong>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn three issues, Tu contends that the trial court erred in rendering judgment\r\ndeclaring that the lease and partnership assignments' indemnity provisions made Tu\r\nresponsible for Nguyen's attorney's fees and awarding Nguyen $79,900 in attorney's\r\nfees against Tu, jointly and severally with HKDI and Duong.  Tu bases her challenge\r\non three grounds: (1) the court declared that the lease assignment did not breach the\r\nlease agreement with HKDI, which declaration allegedly eliminated the sole basis for\r\ncontractual indemnity; (2) alternatively, the claims alleged against Nguyen did not fall\r\nwithin the indemnity agreements' unambiguous terms; and (3) Nguyen did not\r\nsegregate evidence of her attorney's fees.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>A.\tPertinent Facts</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tTwo sets of indemnity provisions were at issue in the consolidated suit.  The\r\nfirst set was included in the partnership assignment between Tu and Nguyen, and the\r\nsecond set was included in the lease assignment between them.  We need to examine\r\nonly the lease assignment's indemnity provision:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\tAssignor [Tu] hereby indemnifies Assignee [Nguyen] and agrees\r\nto hold [Nguyen] harmless from and against <em>any and all </em>claims, demands,\r\nobligations, liabilities, <em>costs</em>, losses and expenses, including without\r\nlimitation <em>attorney's fees resulting from or arising out of all provisions,\r\nagreements, obligations, covenants and conditions </em>which are or were\r\nprovided or required to be paid, performed, discharged, and/or observed\r\n<em>prior to </em>the effective date of this Assignment by [Tu] under or in\r\nconnection with the Lease [between HKDI and Tu and Nguyen].</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>(Emphasis added.)</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn her pleadings filed in the consolidated suit, Nguyen asserted an indemnity\r\nclaim against Tu, alleging that \"[Tu's] actions would constitute a breach of contract\r\nand would bound [sic] her to an indemnification agreement to [Nguyen] and the\r\npartnership\" and that \"[Nguyen] is entitled to indemnification from [Tu] for damages\r\nfor attorney fee [sic].\"  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe jury question relevant to our discussion asked if \"the 'assignment' from Tu\r\nto [Nguyen] was 'excused'\" by waiver, estoppel, or duress.  Because this jury question\r\nconcerned affirmative defenses,<sup> (41)</sup> the question, its instructions, and its definitions\r\nimpliedly assumed that the execution of the lease assignment without HKDI's prior\r\nwritten consent violated the terms of the lease agreement with HKDI.<sup> (42)</sup>  The final\r\njudgment then recited as follows:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\tThe Court finds that, in interpreting the lease agreement as a\r\nwhole, the lease agreement was not breached by [[Nguyen's] and [Tu's]\r\ncompliance with a Court Ordered assignment of [Tu's] lease interest in\r\nrelation to the dissolution of the partnership which was done without the\r\nprior written consent of [HKDI].</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t. . . .</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tThe jury returned a verdict as to [Nguyen's] affirmative defenses that the\r\nCourt Ordered assignment of the lease interest, if the assignment was a\r\nbreach of the [lease] agreement, was excused.\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>B.</strong>\t<strong>Standards of Review and the Law</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe review questions of law like those raised in Tu's first and second issues <em>de\r\nnovo</em>.  <em>See, e.g.</em>, <em>State v. Delany</em>, 197 S.W.3d 297, 300 (Tex. 2006); <em>MCI Telecomms.\r\nCorp. v. Tex. Utils.  Elec. Co.</em>, 995 S.W.2d 647, 650-51 (Tex. 1999) (instructing that\r\ninterpretation of unambiguous contract is question of law, which is reviewed <em>de novo</em>). \r\nCourts \"may not expand the parties' rights or responsibilities beyond the limits agreed\r\nupon by them in the [indemnity] contract.\"  <em>Ideal Lease Serv., Inc. v.

(\"The supreme court requires\r\nthat indemnity agreements be strictly construed to give effect to the parties' intent as\r\nexpressed in the agreement.\").  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe apply the same standard of review and substantive law to Tu's third issue,\r\nconcerning the failure to segregate attorney's fees, as we did to HKDI and Duong's\r\nsimilar challenge.  </span><span><em>See Chapa</em>, 212 S.W.3d at 313.</span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><strong>C.\tThe Effect of the Judgment's Recitation That No Breach Occurred</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn her first issue, Tu argues that the judgment's recitation that \"the lease\r\nagreement was not breached\" negates any ground for indemnification.  Specifically,\r\nTu contends that only a breach of the lease agreement with HKDI could trigger her\r\nduty to indemnify Nguyen under the lease assignment between Tu and Nguyen.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe disagree.  First, the judgment's recitation on which Tu relies indicates that\r\nthe court found no breach <em>not </em>because the failure to obtain HKDI's prior written\r\nconsent did not violate the lease agreement with HKDI, but instead because that\r\nviolation was excused.  The judgment's recitation that \"the lease agreement was not\r\nbreached <em>by [Nguyen's] and [Tu's] compliance with a Court Ordered assignment of\r\n[Tu's] lease interest</em>,\" along with its reference to the jury's affirmative-defense finding\r\nthat the \"assignment\" was \"excused\" by duress, can be read as a finding that duress\r\nexcused the violation of the lease agreement.  (Emphasis added.)  Accordingly, viewed\r\nin context, the judgment's recitation on which Tu relies is not a finding that she did\r\nnot violate any duties under the lease assignment.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAdditionally, the scope of the lease assignment's indemnity provision was\r\nbroad.  Tu reads this indemnity provision restrictively, as being triggered only if Tu\r\nand Nguyen were held liable for having breached the lease agreement with HKDI.  In\r\ncontrast, the lease assignment's indemnity provision actually read as follows:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\tAssignor [Tu] hereby indemnifies Assignee [Nguyen] and agrees\r\nto hold [Nguyen] harmless from and against any and all claims, demands,\r\nobligations, liabilities, costs, losses and expenses, including without\r\nlimitation attorney's fees <em>resulting from or arising out of all provisions,\r\nagreements, obligations, covenants and conditions which are or were\r\nprovided or required to be </em>paid, <em>performed</em>, discharged, and/or <em>observed\r\nprior to </em>the effective date of this Assignment by [Tu] under or in\r\nconnection with the Lease [between HKDI and Tu and Nguyen].</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>(Emphasis added.)  The indemnity provision was thus triggered by, among other\r\nthings, costs that resulted from or arose out of any obligation (or other listed matter)\r\nthat Tu had to perform under the lease agreement with HKDI.  The scope of this\r\nlanguage was thus broader than simply costs resulting from liability for the lease\r\nagreement's breach.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tTu was the party assigning her leasehold interest to Nguyen.  The lease\r\nagreement required that \"Tenant [Tu and Nguyen] . . . not assign this Lease, or any\r\ninterest therein, . . . without first obtaining the written consent of [HKDI]\" and that\r\n\"[Tu and Nguyen] shall not sell, convey, or assign any interest in the corporation [sic]\r\nwithout prior written approval from [HKDI].\"  It is undisputed that HKDI's written\r\nconsent to the lease assignment was not obtained prior to the assignment's execution. \r\nThat failure came within the scope of the indemnity provision--whether or not the\r\nfailure was ultimately excused by waiver, estoppel, or duress.  The judicial recitation\r\nthat \"the lease agreement was not breached\" did not, therefore, negate the contractual\r\nbasis for indemnity.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe overrule Tu's first issue.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>D.\tThe Challenge That the Claims Against Nguyen Fell Outside the Indemnity\r\nAgreement's Scope</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe lease assignment's indemnity provision required Tu to indemnify Nguyen\r\nonly for failed obligations (or other listed matters) under the lease agreement that Tu\r\nhad to perform \"prior to\" the lease assignment's execution.  In her second issue, Tu\r\nalternatively argues that the failure to obtain HKDI's prior written consent to the lease\r\nassignment could not have occurred <em>before </em>the lease assignment was executed because\r\nthe failure occurred <em>at the time of</em> the assignment's execution.  We reject this\r\nargument.  Although the lease agreement with HKDI was not violated until the\r\nmoment that Tu and Nguyen signed the lease assignment, the obligation that Tu, as\r\nassignor, was required to perform under the lease agreement with HKDI was to obtain\r\nHKDI's <em>prior </em>written consent to the assignment, which failure necessarily occurred\r\nprior to the lease assignment's execution.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe overrule Tu's second issue.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>E.\tNguyen's Failure to Segregate Attorney's Fees</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn her third issue, Tu urges </span><span>that the trial court erred in rendering judgment on\r\nthe jury's verdict for attorney's fees because Nguyen failed to segregate the fees\r\nattributable to those claims for which fees were recoverable from those for which they\r\nwere not</span><span>.

We construe HKDI and Duong's objections to Nguyen's motion for entry of\r\njudgment as a pre-judgment motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict\r\n(\"JNOV\") or to disregard jury findings because the objections did more than\r\nmerely point out errors in Nguyen's proposed judgment.  <em>See State Bar of Tex.\r\nv.

For instance, HKDI and Duong's\r\n\"objections\" (1) requested that the trial court rule in their favor, (2) stated\r\nreasons that the verdict should be disregarded, (3) argued that no evidence\r\nsupported certain jury findings, and (4) raised legal bars to the rendition of\r\njudgment on the jury's findings.  <em>See </em>6 Roy W. McDonald &amp; Elaine A.\r\nGrafton Carlson, Texas Civil Practice §§ 8:14-8:18, at 218-25 (2d ed.\r\n1998) (setting out function of motion to disregard jury findings and motion for\r\nJNOV and what appellate complaints those motions preserve).  Moreover,\r\nHKDI and Duong's objections were filed simultaneously with their motion for\r\nentry of judgment, which incorporated by reference their objections, requested\r\na take-nothing judgment on Nguyen's claims and an award of possession, and\r\nrecited that the court was disregarding various jury findings.  HKDI and\r\nDuong's objections and motion for entry of judgment thus together constituted\r\na pre-judgment request for affirmative relief.\r\n</p><p>7. The trial court did not render judgment for the $49,266.66 that the jury had\r\nfound that Nguyen, as a result of Duong's tortious interference, had incurred\r\nin costs defending her right to the leased premises.  Therefore, the sole actual\r\ndamages that the court awarded Nguyen for Duong's tortious interference (and\r\nfor HKDI's and Duong's conspiracy) was $15,000 in mental-anguish damages. \r\nThe parties both represent on appeal that Nguyen elected to recover mental-anguish damages and attorney's fees, rather than also recovering damages for\r\ndefending possession.  Nguyen further represents on appeal that she did so in\r\norder \"to ensure that there was no double recovery\" between the attorney's fees\r\nand the costs of defending possession.\r\n</p><p>8. An unsigned docket-sheet entry recites, \"8/13/04  M4 JNOV--Denied   <span>No\r\norder</span>.\"  However, we generally may not consider recitations in the docket sheet\r\nas rulings.  <em>In re Bill Heard Chevrolet</em>, 209 S.W.3d 311, 315 (Tex.\r\nApp.--Houston [1st Dist.] 2006, orig. proceeding).\r\n</p><p>9. <em>Volume Millwork, Inc. v. West Houston Airport Corp.</em>, No. 01-03-01214-CV,\r\n2006 WL 3628830, at * 4 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] Dec. 14, 2006, pet.\r\ndenied); <em>Carlson's Hill Country Beverage, L.C. v. Westinghouse Rd. Joint\r\nVenture</em>, 957 S.W.2d 951, 952-53 (Tex. App.--Austin 1997, no pet.).\r\n</p><p>10. <em>Rice v. Pinney</em>, 51 S.W.3d 705, 707 (Tex.

After consolidation here, the two cases retained their original cause numbers,\r\nbut one judgment was issued disposing of both cases, and their treatment\r\nindicates that this was a true consolidation.\r\n</p><p>13. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 749 derives from 1925 Revised Statutes article\r\n3987: \"Either party may appeal from a final judgment in such case, to the\r\ncounty court of the county in which the judgment is rendered . . . .\"  Revised\r\nStatutes, 39th Leg., R.S., § 1, art. 3987, 1925 Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. 2, 1082.  The\r\n1925 Revised Statutes used the term \"county court\" to refer both to the\r\nconstitutional county court and to the statutory county court.  <em>See generally\r\n</em>Revised Statutes, 39th Leg., R.S., § 1, arts. 1927-1970, 1925 Tex. Rev. Civ.\r\nStat. 2, 532-539 (title 41, Courts-County, defining duties and powers of\r\ncounty court).  Rule 749 thus allows an appeal to either the constitutional\r\ncounty court or the statutory county court.\r\n</p><p>14. We distinguish the authority on which Nguyen relies for the contrary\r\nproposition.  In <em>West Anderson Plaza v. Feyznia</em>,<em> </em>the county court considered\r\nthe merits of a DTPA counter-claim asserted on appeal in a forcible-detainer\r\naction without mentioning its lack of jurisdiction over that claim.  <em>See id.</em>, 876\r\nS.W.2d 528, 531-36 (Tex. App.--Austin 1994, no writ).  Neither did the\r\n<em>Feyznia</em> court address the limited jurisdiction applicable to forcible-detainer\r\nsuits.  <em>See id.</em>, <em>passim</em>. The same is true of the court in <em>Anarkali Enterprises,\r\nInc. v. Riverside Drive Enterprises, Inc.</em>, 802 S.W.2d 25, 27-28 (Tex.\r\nApp.--Fort Worth 1990, no writ).  Simply put, the <em>Anarkali Enterprises, Inc.</em>\r\nand <em>Feyznia</em> courts did not discuss the jurisdictional issue before us, whereas\r\nthe cases on which we have relied in this paragraph did so expressly.\r\n</p><p>15. <em>See Carlson's Hill Country Beverage, L.C.</em>, 957 S.W.2d at 954; <em>cf. Haginas v.\r\nMalbis Mem'l Found.</em>, 163 Tex. 274, 278, 354 S.W.2d 368, 371 (1962). \r\n<em>Compare Ward v. Malone</em>, 115 S.W.3d 267, 269 (Tex. App.--Corpus Christi\r\n2003, pet. denied) (indicating that, generally, county court's appellate\r\njurisdiction is confined to limits of justice court and that county court has no\r\njurisdiction over forcible-detainer appeal unless justice court did); Tex. Gov't\r\nCode Ann. § 27.031(a)(1) (Vernon 2004) (setting amount-in-controversy civil\r\njurisdiction of justice courts at $5,000 maximum, excluding interest).\r\n</p><p>16. Because there was no subject-matter jurisdiction over any counter-claims or\r\nthird-party claims that Nguyen asserted in the forcible-detainer suit, before\r\nconsolidation, against HKDI or Duong, it is immaterial whether the county\r\ncivil court at law in that suit had personal jurisdiction over Duong--which\r\nDuong argues was lacking over him at that time.\r\n</p><p>17. <em>Guar. Fed. Sav. Bank v. Horseshoe Operating Co.</em>, 793 S.W.2d 652, 658 (Tex.\r\n1990).\r\n</p><p>18. Nguyen reasserted her third-party claim for tortious interference against Duong\r\nafter consolidation, with leave of the court.  We assume without deciding that\r\nthe reassertion of this cause of action after consolidation, albeit styled as a\r\n\"third-party\" claim against unserved third-party defendant Duong in the\r\nforcible-detainer suit, was the equivalent of having asserted the cause of action\r\nas a \"claim\" against Duong in his capacity as a defendant post-consolidation. \r\n<em>See </em>Tex. R. Civ. P. 71 (\"When a party has mistakenly designated any plea or\r\npleading, the court, if justice so requires, shall treat the plea or pleading as if\r\nit had been properly designated.\"); <em>Heard</em>, 603 S.W.2d at 833 (\"We look to the\r\nsubstance of a plea for relief to determine the nature of the pleading, not\r\nmerely at the form of title given to it.\").  That is, we assume without deciding\r\nthat Nguyen invoked the original jurisdiction of the county civil court at law\r\nwhen she reasserted this claim against Duong after consolidation.\r\n</p><p>19. <em>Compare Vickrey v. Symes</em>, 527 S.W.2d 836, 837 (Tex. App.--Tyler 1975, no\r\nwrit) (holding, in appeal from forcible-detainer judgment, that court of appeals\r\ncould not review propriety of special issue, which was alleged to have\r\nconstituted impermissible general charge on title), <em>with Kaminetzki v. Doshos\r\nI, Ltd.</em>, No. 14-03-00567-CV, 2004 WL 1116960, at *4 (Tex. App.--Houston\r\n[14th Dist.] May 20, 2004, no pet.) (memo. op.) (holding, in appeal from\r\nforcible-detainer judgment, that court of appeals could consider challenge that\r\ncounty court judge was automatically disqualified upon party's objection).\r\n</p><p>20. Appeal was taken to the district court because the county court of Nueces\r\nCounty had no civil jurisdiction at that time.  <em>Cahill v. Tex.-Mex. Ry. Co.</em>, 40\r\nS.W. 871, 871 (Tex. Civ. App.--San Antonio 1897, writ dism'd).\r\n</p><p>21. We distinguish the authority on which Nguyen relies for the contrary position. \r\nIn <em>Knight v. K &amp; K Properties, Inc.</em>, in rejecting a tenant's argument that the\r\nlandlord could not collect rents in a forcible-detainer suit because the tenant\r\nhad relinquished possession of the property by the time of appeal, the court\r\nnoted in dictum that the tenant's objection would have been obviated had the\r\nlandlord sued for rent in county court and then moved to consolidate that suit\r\nwith the forcible-detainer appeal.<em>  See id.</em>, 589 S.W.2d 860, 862 (Tex. Civ.\r\nApp.--Fort Worth 1979, no writ).  <em> </em>We note that rents may be sought in a\r\nforcible-detainer suit; that is not true of Nguyen's claims.  <em>See </em>Tex. R. Civ. P.\r\n738, 752.  In <em>French v.</em> <em>Moore</em> and <em>Green v. Canon</em>, the courts\r\nconsidered--without discussing the propriety of consolidation or the trial\r\ncourt's jurisdiction to do so--appeals in cases in which a county civil court at\r\nlaw had consolidated a forcible-detainer appeal with another suit in which it\r\nwas exercising original jurisdiction.  <em>See French</em>, 169 S.W.3d 1, 17 (Tex.\r\nApp.--Houston [1st Dist.] 2004, no pet.); <em>Green</em>, 33 S.W.3d 855, 859 (Tex.\r\nApp.--Houston [14th Dist.] 2000, pet. denied).  Because consolidation of a\r\nforcible-detainer appeal with an original-jurisdiction suit is error, but not\r\njurisdictional error, the <em>French</em> and <em>Green</em> courts rightly did not discuss the\r\nissue before them, and the holdings of <em>French</em> and <em>Green</em> are not instructive in\r\nthis case.  <em>See</em> <em>Walling v. Metcalfe</em>, 863 S.W.2d 56, 58 (Tex. 1993) (\"We have\r\nheld repeatedly that the courts of appeals may not reverse the judgment of a\r\ntrial court for a reason not raised in a point of error.\").  For this reason, we\r\ndecline to read <em>French</em> and <em>Green </em>as does Nguyen--especially when the only\r\nTexas appellate court (ours, in <em>Cahill</em>) expressly addressing the issue has held\r\ncontrary to Nguyen's reading.\r\n</p><p>22. <em>See Allison v. Ark. La. Gas Co.</em>, 624 S.W.2d 566, 568 (Tex. 1981).\r\n</p><p>23. HKDI and Nguyen do not argue that they were harmed by what was, in effect,\r\nthe total denial of a decision on the right to immediate possession under their\r\nforcible-detainer pleadings because (1) they might have prevailed under those\r\npleadings and (2) they could thus have been entitled to recover their costs for\r\nNguyen's withholding possession of the premises during the pendency of the\r\nforcible-detainer appeal.  <em>See </em>Tex. R. Civ. P. 752.  Accordingly, we do not\r\nconsider this aspect in our mootness analysis.\r\n</p><p>24. Because we resolve in HKDI and Duong's favor their legal-sufficiency\r\nchallenges to many of the claims and damages that the trial court allowed by\r\ntrial amendment, we need not determine whether the trial court erred in\r\nallowing those trial amendments.\r\n</p><p>25. HKDI and Duong preserved this complaint by moving for directed verdict and\r\nby objecting to the submission of jury question number 6, concerning tortious\r\ninterference, on this ground.  <em>See Cecil v. Smith</em>, 804 S.W.2d 509, 510-11\r\n(Tex. 1994).\r\n</p><p>26. HKDI and Duong preserved this challenge by the implicit overruling of their\r\nobjections to Nguyen's proposed judgment and their own motion for entry of\r\njudgment, which asserted this argument and which we have construed as pre-judgment motions for JNOV or to disregard jury findings.  <em>See </em>Tex. R. App. P.\r\n33.1(a)(2)(A); <em>Lenz v. Lenz</em>, 79 S.W.3d 10, 13 (Tex. 2002) (holding that\r\nappellant preserved complaint raised in pre-judgment JNOV because trial court\r\nimplicitly ruled on JNOV motion by virtue of substance of its judgment that\r\nwas later rendered); <em>First Nat'l Indem. Co. v. First Bank &amp; Trust of Groves,\r\nTex.</em>, 753 S.W.2d 405, 407 (Tex. App.--Beaumont 1998, no pet.). \r\nAdditionally, HKDI and Duong moved for directed verdict on the civil-conspiracy claim because there was no evidence of \"any wrongful or unlawful\r\nact.\"  <em>See Cecil</em>, 804 S.W.2d at 510-11.\r\n</p><p>27. Nguyen asserts that the evidence showed that \"the conspiracy included more\r\nparticipants than simply Tu and Duong.\"  However, the jury was asked to\r\ndetermine only whether HKDI, Tu, and Duong were co-conspirators, not any\r\nother person.  An element of a civil conspiracy claim is two or more persons\r\nparticipate, which means that it was Nguyen's burden to request determinations\r\nof who the participants were.  <em>See </em></p></span><span><em>Tri v. J.T.T.</em>, 162 S.W.3d 552, 556 (Tex.\r\n2005)</span><span>.  In any event, \"an object to be accomplished\" is also an element of the\r\nclaim, and the only \"object\" on which Nguyen sought a jury determination was\r\nDuong's tortious interference--one for which we have already held that\r\nNguyen adduced legally insufficient evidence.  <em>See id.</em>\r\n<p>28. HKDI and Duong preserved this challenge by the implicit overruling of their\r\nobjection to Nguyen's proposed judgment and their own motion for entry of\r\njudgment, which asserted that the court \"should not <em>award judgment </em>to\r\n[Nguyen]\" on jury question 6, concerning liability for tortious interference. \r\n(Emphasis added.)  <em>See </em>Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a)(2)(A); <em>Lenz</em>, 79 S.W.3d at 13;\r\n<em>First Nat'l Indem. Co.</em>, 753 S.W.2d at 407.  We deem a request that the court\r\nnot \"award judgment\" on a liability question to be broad enough to include a\r\nrequest to disregard any damages finding that is dependant on that liability\r\nquestion.\r\n</p><p>29. HKDI and Duong preserved this challenged by the implicit overruling of their\r\nobjections to Nguyen's motion for entry of judgment and of their motion for\r\njudgment, which asserted that no evidence supported this damages finding.<em> \r\nSee </em>Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a)(2)(A); <em>Lenz</em>, 79 S.W.3d at 13; <em>First Nat'l Indem.\r\nCo.</em>, 753 S.W.2d at 407.\r\n</p><p>30. HKDI and Duong preserved this challenge by objecting to the submission of\r\njury question 7 on this basis.  <em>See Cecil</em>, 804 S.W.2d at 510-11.\r\n</p><p>31. In any event, we have already held that legally insufficient evidence supports\r\nthe jury's civil-conspiracy findings against HKDI and Duong.\r\n</p><p>32. HKDI and Duong sufficiently preserved this challenge by the implicit\r\noverruling of their objection to Nguyen's proposed judgment and their own\r\nmotion for entry of judgment, which asserted (1) that the jury's findings of\r\nmalice against Duong \"improperly rest[ed] on the conspiracy finding, in that\r\nno finding of damages exists as to the conspiracy claim\"; (2) that the jury's\r\naward of punitive damages against HKDI and Duong \"does not rest on a\r\nfinding of actual damages\"; and (3) that \"no evidence supports the jury's\r\nfinding of punitive damages\" against HKDI and Duong.  <em>See </em>Tex. R. App. P.\r\n33.1(a)(2)(A); <em>Lenz</em>, 79 S.W.3d at 13; <em>First Nat'l Indem. Co.</em>, 753 S.W.2d at\r\n407.  Although these objections differ slightly from that raised on appeal, they\r\ntogether sufficiently advised the court that submission of the punitive-damages\r\nissue was improper because of the failure of a predicate concerning actual\r\ndamages.  <em>See</em> Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a)(1)(A) (providing that, to preserve error,\r\nmotion must state grounds \"with sufficient specificity to make the trial court\r\naware of the complaint.\").\r\n</p><p>33. HKDI and Duong preserved this challenge by objecting to the submission of\r\njury question 16 on this basis.  <em>See Cecil</em>, 804 S.W.2d at 510-11.\r\n</p><p>34. The malice question supporting the award of punitive damages was predicated\r\non a finding that Duong was liable for civil conspiracy only.  The only actual\r\ndamages awarded were for Duong's tortious interference, not civil conspiracy. \r\nHowever, his liability for civil conspiracy was implicitly predicated on his\r\nliability for tortious interference.  Because HKDI and Duong do not argue\r\notherwise on appeal, we assume without deciding the award of actual damages\r\nagainst Duong for tortious interference could, in the abstract, support an award\r\nof punitive damages against Duong under this charge.\r\n</p><p>35. HKDI and Duong also argue that the trial court erred in rendering judgment for\r\nthe attorney's fees that the jury found because they could not be supported by\r\nProperty Code section 24.006(c),<sup> (36)</sup>\r\n</p><p>36.     - \r\n           \r\n            § \r\n              \r\n    \r\n</p><p>37. Although HKDI and Duong did not state their challenge (2) in the trial court\r\nin the exact terms stated on appeal, they did assert below that Nguyen \"cannot\r\nrecover legal fees based on her declaratory judgment action,\" which we deem\r\nsufficiently to have preserved their appellate argument.\r\n</p><p>38. <em>See </em>Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. § 37.009 (Vernon 1997)</p></span><span>; Tex. Prop.\r\nCode Ann. § 24.006 (Vernon 2000); </span><span>Tex. R. Civ. P. 752</span><span>.\r\n<p>39. <em>See </em></p></span><span><em>Tony Gullo Motors I, L.P. v. Chapa</em>, 212 S.W.3d 299, 311 (Tex. 2006)\r\n(\"Absent a contract or statute, trial courts do not have inherent authority to\r\nrequire a losing party to pay the prevailing party's fees.\")</span><span>.\r\n<p>40. In a few paragraphs in their opening and reply briefs, HKDI and Duong\r\nmention that the lease agreement's anti-assignment clause \"nullifies\" or\r\n\"violates\" the lease assignment as a matter of law, even if the assignment\r\noccurs \"by operation of law,\" which might be a reference to the court's order\r\nto sign the lease assignment.  The other times that they mention the anti-assignment clause, they do so in support of their jurisdictional or no-evidence\r\narguments, not as a challenge to the jury's duress finding.  These brief\r\nstatements do not amount to appellate challenges to the jury's duress finding. \r\nAdditionally, as mentioned above, their issue two is phrased in terms of\r\nwhether the trial court erred in allowing Nguyen belatedly to assert waiver and\r\nestoppel, which argument could not apply to duress, and HKDI and Duong\r\nexpressly state that they \"ha[ve] never challenged the merits of the issue of\r\npossession,\" to which the merits of the duress defense relates.\r\n</p><p>41. <em>See</em> Tex. R. Civ. P. 94 (indicating that estoppel and duress are affirmative\r\ndefenses); <em>In re S.A.P.</em>, 156 S.W.3d 574, 576 (Tex. 2005) (quoting rule 94\r\nconcerning estoppel's being avoidance or affirmative defense); <em>In re Epic\r\nHoldings, Inc.</em>, 985 S.W.2d 41, 57 (Tex. 1998) (\"Waiver is an affirmative\r\ndefense\"); <em>Hardin v.

The partners'\r\ndispute led to a lawsuit (\"the partnership suit\"), and the partnership eventually went\r\ninto receivership.  The jury in the partnership suit awarded Nguyen and her sister, also\r\na partner, 70% of the partnership; awarded Tu 30% of the partnership; and awarded\r\nactual damages to Nguyen and attorney's fees to Nguyen and her sister.<sup> (1)</sup>  In a separate\r\nreceivership sale of Alpha Bakery, Nguyen purchased the business.  Final paperwork\r\nfor the sale was drawn up, including a contract assigning Tu's lease interest to Nguyen\r\n(\"the lease assignment\"), as well as a contract assigning Tu's partnership interest to\r\nNguyen (\"the partnership assignment\").  No one obtained HKDI's consent to the lease\r\nassignment, despite the lease agreement's requirement that HKDI's written consent\r\nbe obtained as a precondition to any assignment of the leasehold interest. \r\nNonetheless, Nguyen and Tu signed the documents, including the lease assignment.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn a nutshell, Nguyen's position in the current suit was that she and Tu had\r\nsigned the lease assignment without HKDI's written consent under duress because the\r\ntrial court in the partnership suit had ordered them to sign it under threat of contempt. \r\nShe also alleged that Tu's counsel in the partnership suit, who had represented HKDI\r\nin other matters, had implied in the partnership suit that he was representing both Tu\r\nand HKDI and that HKDI would not object to the assignment.  Nguyen also took the\r\nposition in the current lawsuit that Tu, HKDI, and Duong had conspired, for various\r\nreasons, to have the parties execute the lease assignment without first obtaining\r\nHKDI's written consent so that Nguyen could be declared in default, HKDI could\r\nevict her, and Tu could open a competing restaurant in the same mall.  HKDI, Duong,\r\nand Tu disputed the validity of Nguyen's theories.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn May 2003, HKDI notified Nguyen and Tu that they were in default under the\r\nlease because HKDI's consent had not been obtained to the lease assignment and\r\ninstructed them to vacate the premises.  Later that month, Nguyen sued HKDI, Duong,\r\nand Tu in Harris County Civil Court at Law No. 3 (\"the tort suit\").<sup> (2)</sup>  Nguyen  (1)\r\nsought a declaration that the lease assignment from Tu to Nguyen was not a breach of\r\nthe lease agreement; (2) asserted a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty against\r\nTu; (3) asserted a cause of action for conspiracy against all appellants, alleging that\r\nthey had conspired in order for Tu to run Nguyen's restaurant out of business so that\r\nTu could operate an allegedly competing restaurant within Hong Kong Market; and\r\n(4) sought actual damages of \"less than $100,000,\" exemplary damages, attorney's\r\nfees, and injunctive relief.  Two months later, Nguyen filed a first supplemental\r\npetition in the tort suit, seeking a declaration--as an apparent alternative to a\r\ndeclaration that the lease assignment had not breached the lease agreement--that the\r\nlease assignment was void for having been executed under the \"extreme duress\" of the\r\nthreat of contempt in the partnership suit.  All appellants answered, and HKDI and\r\nDuong asserted a counter-claim against Nguyen for sanctions for the filing of a\r\nfrivolous lawsuit.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn July 2003, HKDI filed suit, against both Tu and Nguyen, for forcible detainer\r\nin a Harris County justice of the peace court, seeking possession of the leasehold\r\nproperty (\"the forcible-detainer suit\").  <em>See </em>Tex. Prop. Code Ann. § 24.002 (Vernon\r\n2000).  Although the record does not show how the justice court disposed of the\r\nforcible-detainer suit, HKDI asserts, without dispute, that it confessed judgment and\r\nthen immediately appealed to County Civil Court at Law No. 1.<sup> (3)</sup>  <em>See </em>Tex. R. App. P.\r\n38.1(f) (\"In a civil case, the court will accept as true the facts stated [in the appellant's\r\nbrief] unless another party contradicts them.\"); <em>Mullins v.

App.--Houston [14th Dist.] 1987, no writ) (holding that rendition of agreed\r\njudgment in justice court in forcible-detainer suit does not deprive county court of\r\njurisdiction to hear case, when appealed, in trial <em>de novo</em>).  <em> </em>Both Tu and Nguyen\r\nanswered in the county civil court at law in the forcible-detainer suit.  On October 2,\r\n2003, Nguyen asserted counter-claims in the forcible-detainer suit against HKDI,\r\ncross-claims against Tu, and \"cross-claims\"--which were actually third-party\r\nclaims--against Duong, who had theretofore not been a party in the forcible-detainer\r\nsuit.<sup> (4)</sup>  Nguyen alleged (1) that Tu and Duong had tortiously interfered with her\r\ncontractual relations; (2) that Tu had breached her fiduciary duty to Nguyen; (3) that\r\nall appellants had unfairly competed with her; and (4) that all appellants had conspired\r\nto evict her.  On her counter-, cross-, and third-party claims in the forcible-detainer\r\nsuit, Nguyen sought actual damages of \"less than $100,000,\" exemplary damages, and\r\nattorney's fees.  HKDI answered Nguyen's counter-claims against it, but Duong did\r\nnot.  Although the clerk's record does not show this, HKDI and Duong assert on\r\nappeal, without contradiction by Nguyen, that Nguyen never served Duong on her\r\nthird-party claim.  <em>See</em> Tex. R. App. P. 38.1(f).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn October 10 and 15, 2003, respectively, Tu and HKDI moved in the forcible-detainer suit to strike or to sever Nguyen's counter-claims, cross-claims, and third-party claims, arguing that the county civil court at law had no subject-matter\r\njurisdiction to consider these matters in a forcible-detainer suit.  On October 16, 2003,\r\nNguyen moved in the forcible-detainer suit to consolidate the tort suit and the forcible-detainer suit, which motion HKDI opposed in writing, while also reurging its earlier-filed motion to strike or to sever.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn the meantime, on October 16, 2003 in the forcible-detainer suit, Nguyen filed\r\nher first amended counter-claim, cross-claim, and third-party claim, this time omitting\r\nDuong as a named party.  This amendment occurred before the court in the forcible-detainer suit had ruled on Nguyen's motion to consolidate.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn October 23, 2003, the trial court in the forcible-detainer suit signed an order\r\nconsolidating the two lawsuits and ordering the tort suit transferred to County Civil\r\nCourt at Law No. 1, the court to which the forcible-detainer suit had been appealed\r\n(\"the consolidated suit\").  From that point forward, Nguyen supplemented her petition\r\nonce on the day that trial began, and she was twice granted leave, over HKDI's and\r\nDuong's various objections, to conform the pleadings to the evidence.  One of these\r\npost-trial amendments re-added Duong as a third-party defendant to Nguyen's third-party claims that had been asserted in the forcible-detainer suit before consolidation. \r\nAfter consolidation, Tu also asserted a counter-claim and a cross-claim against\r\nNguyen for indemnity based on a provision in the lease assignment.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBy virtue of her pleadings filed in the separate suits before consolidation, and\r\nby virtue of the pre-trial and post-trial amendments that the trial court allowed in the\r\nconsolidated suit, Nguyen pleaded the following claims, requests for relief, and\r\ndefenses in the consolidated suit:<sup> (5)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\ta declaration that the lease assignment from Tu to Nguyen was not\r\na breach of the lease agreement with HKDI;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\ta declaration--as an apparent alternative to a declaration that the\r\nlease assignment had not breached the lease agreement--that the\r\nlease assignment was void for having been executed under the\r\n\"extreme duress\" of the threat of contempt in the partnership suit;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\tbreach of fiduciary duty by Tu;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\tconspiracy against all appellants, asserting that they had conspired\r\nto evict her;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\ttortious interference with contractual relations by Tu and Duong;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\tunfair competition against all appellants;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\tindemnity against Tu, under theories that Tu had breached a\r\ncontract and that Tu owed indemnity for attorney's fees under the\r\ndocuments signed in the partnership suit; and</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\twaiver and estoppel, as defenses to HKDI's position that it was\r\nentitled to possession because Nguyen had breached the lease\r\nagreement with HKDI by virtue of the lease assignment.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tNot all of the claims went to the jury, however.

Alternatively, they raise\r\nother challenges that they assert concern non-jurisdictional matters relating to\r\nallegations in the tort suit that were carried forward or added after consolidation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>A.\tOur Appellate Jurisdiction to Consider HKDI and Duong's Various\r\nChallenges</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDetermining which of HKDI and Duong's various appellate challenges we may\r\nconsider is complicated by the facts that the two suits were consolidated; that in one\r\nsuit, the county court exercised appellate jurisdiction; that in the other suit, the county\r\ncourt exercised original jurisdiction; that in both suits, the parties sought, among other\r\nthings, a determination of the right to possession; that the suits were tried together\r\nafter consolidation; and that one judgment was rendered in the consolidated cause and\r\nincluded, among other determinations, a determination of the right to possession.  We\r\nfirst examine our appellate jurisdiction over judgments in suits in which the county\r\ncourt exercises appellate jurisdiction (specifically, forcible-detainer suits), our\r\nappellate jurisdiction over judgments in suits in which the county court exercises\r\noriginal jurisdiction, and the effect on our appellate jurisdiction of the consolidation\r\nhere.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>\t1.\tOur Jurisdiction in Appeals from a Forcible-Detainer Judgment in\r\nCounty Court</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn appeal from a forcible-detainer judgment, we have no jurisdiction to\r\nconsider the issue of possession if, as is the case here, the disputed premises were used\r\nfor commercial purposes.  Tex. Prop. Code Ann. § 24.007 (Vernon 2000) (\"A final\r\njudgment of a county court in an eviction suit may not be appealed on the issue of\r\npossession unless the premises in question are being used for residential purposes\r\nonly.\"); <em>Carlson's Hill Country Beverage, L.C. v.

Gov't Code\r\nAnn. § 22.220(a) (Vernon 2004) (\"Each court of appeals has appellate jurisdiction of\r\nall civil cases within its district of which the district courts or county courts have\r\njurisdiction when the amount in controversy or the judgment rendered exceeds $100,\r\nexclusive of interest and costs.\").  Therefore, had the cases not been consolidated, we\r\nwould have had plenary appellate jurisdiction to review virtually any issue asserted\r\nto challenge a judgment rendered in the tort suit.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><strong>\t3.\tThe Effect of Consolidation on Our Appellate Jurisdiction</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tOur jurisdiction to consider HKDI and Duong's various appellate challenges is\r\naffected by the consolidation of the forcible-detainer and tort suits.

In this appeal from the single judgment in the consolidated\r\nsuit, we have the limited appellate jurisdiction provided by Texas Property Code\r\nsection 24.007 to consider challenges to matters raised <em>solely</em> by the forcible-detainer\r\npleadings.  <em>See </em>Tex. Prop. Code Ann. § 24.007.  In contrast, we have plenary\r\nappellate jurisdiction to consider challenges to matters raised by the tort-suit\r\npleadings, regardless of whether those matters were also raised by the forcible-detainer\r\npleadings.  For each of HKDI and Duong's challenges discussed below, we state\r\nseparately whether we have jurisdiction to consider them.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>B.</strong>\t<strong>The Counter-Claim and Third-Party Claim Asserted in the Forcible-Detainer Suit Against HKDI and Duong Before Consolidation</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tIn issue one, HKDI and Duong argue that the trial court lacked subject-matter\r\njurisdiction to adjudicate Nguyen's counter-claims against HKDI and her third-party\r\nclaims against Duong that she had asserted in the forcible-detainer suit before\r\nconsolidation.  Specifically, they argue that the county civil court at law, sitting as an\r\nappellate court in the forcible-detainer suit, lacked subject-matter jurisdiction to\r\nconsider the counter-claims and third-party claims because those claims (1) exceeded\r\nthe justice court's jurisdiction, (2) fell outside the scope of claims allowed in a\r\nforcible-detainer suit, and (3) were impermissibly raised for the first time on appeal\r\nto the county civil court at law.  Additionally, HKDI and Duong argue that the trial\r\ncourt lacked subject-matter jurisdiction to award actual damages over the justice\r\ncourt's $5,000 damages cap, and to award exemplary damages at all, in the forcible-detainer suit.  For these reasons, HKDI and Duong argue that the trial court erred in\r\nnot severing or striking the complained-of counter-claims and third-party claims from\r\nthe forcible-detainer suit before consolidation.  We have jurisdiction to consider these \r\nchallenges because, although they concern matters in the pre-consolidation forcible-detainer suit, they relate to the county civil court at law's subject-matter jurisdiction\r\nand thus do not concern the issue of possession.  <em>See Gibson v.

When a county court acquires only appellate jurisdiction in a given suit, it\r\nmay not, absent authorization by statute or rule, determine any matter acquired by\r\nvirtue of its original jurisdiction in that same suit.  <em>See id.</em> at 780.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t<strong>2.</strong>\t<strong>Discussion</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tPrior to consolidation, Nguyen alleged against HKDI and Duong in the forcible-detainer suit (by counter-claim or third-party claim asserted for the first time on appeal\r\nto the county court at law) that (1) Duong had tortiously interfered with her contractual\r\nrelations; (2) all appellants had unfairly competed with her; and (3) all appellants had\r\nconspired to evict her.  She also sought actual damages of \"less than $100,000,\"\r\nexemplary damages, and attorney's fees.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tUnder the law set out above, the county court at law, before consolidation, had\r\nno subject-matter jurisdiction over these claims because it was exercising its appellate\r\njurisdiction over the forcible-detainer suit appealed from the justice court.  None of\r\nthe matters that Nguyen pleaded concerned the right to immediate possession.  <em>See\r\n</em>Tex. R. Civ. P. 746 (providing that right to possession is sole issue determined in\r\nforcible-detainer or forcible-entry suit).  Neither were they an attempt to collect rent. \r\n<em>See </em>Tex. R. Civ. P. 738 (allowing suit for rent to be adjudicated with forcible-detainer\r\nsuit, provided that rent sought is within justice court's jurisdiction).  Additionally, as\r\nshe had pleaded her tort claims, Nguyen did not expressly seek, or limit her damages\r\nto, damages \"suffered for withholding or defending possession of the premises during\r\nthe pendency of the appeal.\"  Tex. R. Civ. P. 752; <em>see Krull</em>, 879 S.W.2d at 322\r\n(holding that, under rule 752, damages unrelated to maintaining or obtaining\r\npossession of disputed premises may not be joined with forcible-detainer suit in\r\ncounty court).  Because she did not seek rule-752 damages--which pleading would\r\nhave allowed her to seek more than the $5,000 amount-in-controversy limit applicable\r\nto many appeals from justice court<sup> (15)</sup>--the fact that Nguyen sought up to $100,000 also\r\ntook her tort claims outside of the county court's appellate jurisdiction.  <em>Compare </em>Tex.\r\nGov't Code Ann. § 27.031(a)(1) (setting amount-in-controversy civil jurisdiction of\r\njustice courts at $5,000 maximum, excluding interest) <em>with</em> <em>id. </em>§ 25.0003(c)(1)\r\n(Vernon 2004) (setting amount-in-controversy civil jurisdiction of statutory county\r\ncourts at $100,000 maximum, excluding interest, statutory or punitive damages or\r\npenalties, and attorney's fees and costs).  Finally, exemplary damages do not fall\r\nwithin those damages authorized in forcible-detainer suits.  <em>See </em>Tex. R. Civ. P. 746,\r\n752.  Simply put, there is no way to construe Nguyen's counter-claims and third-party\r\nclaims that she asserted in the forcible-detainer suit against HKDI and Duong before\r\nconsolidation so that the county court could have exercised jurisdiction over them.<sup> (16)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWhen a court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over some claims, but not others,\r\nit should sever or dismiss those claims over which jurisdiction is lacking.  <em>See Thomas\r\nv.

HKDI and Duong argue that the trial court's\r\nconsolidating these suits allowed Nguyen to assert the very claims and to recover the\r\nvery damages that would not have been maintainable or recoverable in the forcible-detainer suit had it not been consolidated with the tort suit.  They argue that the county\r\ncivil court at law had the power to exercise either appellate or original jurisdiction, but\r\nnot both in the same suit.

Accordingly, Nguyen's claims against HKDI and Duong--over some\r\nof which the court in the forcible-detainer suit did not have jurisdiction when they\r\nwere asserted there as cross-claims and third-party claims--were subsequently\r\nallowed to be raised in the consolidated suit by virtue of the consolidation. \r\nConsolidation in these circumstances thus accomplished what the same court, when\r\npresiding over the forcible-detainer appeal, lacked subject-matter jurisdiction to do. \r\nThus, they conclude that the trial court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction to\r\nconsolidate the suits.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe disagree.

Nguyen reasons as follows.  This appeal is from a\r\njudgment rendered in a suit seeking, in part, forcible-detainer relief.  In such an appeal,\r\nwe may not consider matters not essential to, dependent on, or primarily concerned\r\nwith the issue of possession.  <em>See </em>Tex. Prop. Code Ann. § 24.007.  Consolidation is\r\nessential to, dependent on, or primarily concerned with the issue of possession. \r\nAdditionally, consolidation was not a jurisdictional matter.  Accordingly, we lack\r\njurisdiction to consider the propriety of consolidating the suits.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe assume without deciding that consolidation is a matter essential to,\r\ndependent on, or primarily concerned with the issue of possession,<sup> (19)</sup> so that, if this\r\nwere an appeal from a judgment rendered in <em>just</em> a forcible-detainer suit, we would\r\nlack jurisdiction to consider it.  This is not such an appeal, however.  Rather, it is an\r\nappeal from a judgment rendered after the consolidation of a forcible-detainer suit, in\r\nwhich the county civil court at law exercised only appellate jurisdiction, and a suit for\r\ndeclarations and damages, in which that same court exercised original jurisdiction. \r\nWe have plenary appellate jurisdiction to consider challenges to matters raised by\r\npleadings invoking the county civil court at law's original jurisdiction, regardless of\r\nwhether those matters were also raised in the forcible-detainer pleadings.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn her tort-suit pleadings before consolidation, Nguyen sought a declaration that\r\nthe lease assignment from Tu to her was not a breach of the lease agreement; after\r\nconsolidation, Nguyen sought an alternative declaration that the lease assignment was\r\nvoid for having been executed under \"extreme duress\" and asserted waiver and\r\nestoppel as defenses to any breach that the lease assignment caused.  These\r\nallegations, which were asserted under and invoked the county civil court at law's\r\noriginal jurisdiction, supported the portions of the judgment declaring that the lease\r\nassignment between Tu and Nguyen did not constitute a breach and awarding Nguyen\r\npossession of the leased premises.  Because the pleadings invoking each type of\r\njurisdiction sought possession, the trial court's declarations concerning breach and its\r\naward of possession were supported by the exercise of both its original and appellate\r\njurisdiction.  That is, the judgment of possession was not unique to the forcible-detainer pleadings.  As we have said above, a forcible-detainer suit may run\r\nconcurrently with another action--even if the other action adjudicates matters that\r\ncould result in a different determination of possession--because a forcible-detainer\r\naction determines only the right to immediate possession, rather than the parties'\r\nultimate<em> </em>rights to any<em> </em>other issue.  <em>See Lopez</em>, 76 S.W.3d at 605; <em>see also Meridien\r\nHotels, Inc.</em>, 97 S.W.3d at 738 (indicating that district court's interlocutory order\r\ndeclaring that tenants had defaulted under lease, that landlord had right to terminate\r\nlease, and that tenants no longer had right to possession did not excuse justice court\r\nfrom proceeding with forcible-detainer action); <em>cf.

Marathon\r\nOil Co.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2451326\"><a href=\"/opinion/2451326/sterner-v-marathon-oil-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">767</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">686</span></a></span>, 690 (Tex. 1989) (\"[I]t is our practice to construe liberally\r\npoints of error in order to obtain a just, fair and equitable adjudication of the rights of\r\nthe litigants.\").</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe conclude that consolidation in these circumstances constitutes error. \r\nForcible-detainer suits are intended to provide a speedy, summary, and inexpensive\r\ndetermination of the right to immediate possession, and the rules accomplish this goal\r\nby allowing the parties to litigate only limited matters.  <em>See, e.g.</em>,<em> Meridien Hotels, Inc.</em>,\r\n97 S.W.3d at 737; <em>see also </em>Tex. R. Civ. P. 739, 740, 745, 746, 748, 749.  This object\r\nis thwarted by allowing through consolidation what is not allowed through assertion\r\nof claims in the forcible-detainer suit itself.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThere is authority to support our conclusion.  In <em>Texas-Mexican Railway Co.\r\nv. Cahill</em>, a forcible-detainer suit was initiated in justice court, and appeal was taken\r\nto the county's district court.<sup> (20)</sup>  <em>See id.</em>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">232</span></span>, 232 (Tex. Civ. App.--Galveston\r\n1893, writ ref'd).  In overruling the appellant's challenge to the denial of its motion\r\nto consolidate the forcible-detainer suit with another suit involving the same appellee\r\npending in the same court, this Court explained, in pertinent part:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t[T]he motion to consolidate was properly refused.  The appellee's suit,\r\nas we have seen, was brought under the statute which provides a remedy \r\nfor the recovery of the possession of real estate when the premises are in\r\nthe quiet occupancy of one, and they are forcibly entered by another, or\r\nwhere a lessee, after the expiration of his lease, refuses to restore\r\npossession to his lessor.  The statute provides a speedy and efficient\r\nremedy for restoring possession to him who is wrongfully deprived of the\r\nsame, and no inquiry as to the title to, or the superior right of either party\r\nto the suit or that of any third person in, the property, is permitted.<em>  The\r\n[other suit] was a suit of trespass to try title to the lot in question.  To\r\npermit the consolidation of such suits would be contrary to the obvious\r\npolicy of the law, and in most cases defeat the object of the statute,--the\r\nprompt adjudication of the right of possession to the premises, without\r\nreference to the right of title to the property.</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><em>Id.</em> at 232 (emphasis added).  We follow the reasoning and conclusion of our Court in\r\n<em>Cahill </em>to hold in this case that the trial court erred in consolidating the tort suit and the\r\nforcible-detainer suit.<sup> (21)</sup>  <em>See id.</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tHKDI and Duong opposed the consolidation.  Although the standard of review\r\nfor consolidation orders is abuse of discretion,<sup> (22)</sup> the trial court necessarily abused its\r\ndiscretion here by acting contrary to the law.  <em>See Walker</em>, 827 S.W.2d at 840.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>\t4.</strong>\t<strong>Whether the Error Was Harmful or Rendered Moot</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tTexas Rule of Appellate Procedure 44.1 provides:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t(a)\t<em>Standard for Reversible Error.</em>   No judgment may be reversed on appeal\r\non the ground that the trial court made an error of law unless the court of\r\nappeals concludes that the error complained of:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t(1)\tprobably caused the rendition of an improper judgment; or</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t(2)\tprobably prevented the appellant from properly presenting\r\nthe case to the court of appeals.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Tex. R. App. P. 44.1.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tFrom the perspective of the forcible-detainer plaintiff, the harm arising from\r\nhaving to participate in a jury trial before one can obtain what is supposed to be an\r\ninexpensive, speedy, and summary ruling on the right to immediate possession is\r\nevident.  HKDI filed the forcible-detainer suit in July 2003, immediately confessed\r\njudgment, and appealed to the county court.  Nguyen asserted her tort counter-claims,\r\ncross-claims, and third-party claims and request for declaratory relief on October 3,\r\n2003.  The trial court consolidated the two suits that same month, implicitly overruling\r\nHKDI's motion to strike or to sever Nguyen's tort claims against HKDI and Duong\r\nin the forcible-detainer suit.  Trial did not begin until December 2, and it ended on\r\nDecember 11; there were seven days of trial proceedings.  The trial court did not\r\nrender judgment adjudicating the right to possession until April 30, 2004.  This\r\nsignificant delay in determining the mere right to immediate possession was caused\r\nby the consideration of tort claims over which the trial court, to the extent that it\r\nexercised its appellate jurisdiction in the forcible-detainer suit, lacked subject-matter\r\njurisdiction, when the issue should have been decided inexpensively, speedily, and\r\nsummarily.  <em>See, e.g.</em>,<em> Meridien Hotels, Inc.</em>, 97 S.W.3d at 737; <em>see also </em>Tex. R. Civ.\r\nP. 739, 740, 745, 746, 748, 749.  Therefore, the error in consolidating the two causes\r\nwas harmful at the time that the order was rendered.<em>  See </em>Tex. R. App. P. 44.1.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span></span><span>\tBut the consolidated case then proceeded to trial and to final judgment, in part\r\nupon pleadings invoking the court's original jurisdiction.  The pleadings invoking the\r\ntrial court's original jurisdiction sought a declaration that the lease assignment\r\nbetween Nguyen and Tu did not breach the lease agreement with HKDI; the same\r\npleadings alternatively sought a declaration that the lease assignment was void for\r\nhaving been executed under \"extreme duress\" and asserted waiver and estoppel as\r\ndefenses to any breach that the lease assignment had caused.  These allegations, which\r\nwere asserted under and invoked the trial court's original jurisdiction, supported the\r\nportion of the judgment declaring that the lease assignment was not a breach <em>and\r\nawarding Nguyen possession of the leased premises</em>.  That is, the trial court's final\r\njudgment was an adjudication not of the right to <em>immediate </em>possession, but of the\r\n<em>ultimate </em>right to possession based on the declaratory requests and affirmative defenses\r\nasserted under its original jurisdiction.  Put another way, the trial court, in effect,\r\ncompletely denied HKDI's request for a determination of the right to immediate\r\npossession and instead determined the ultimate question of who was entitled to\r\npossession.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tEven though a forcible-detainer judgment adjudicates the right to immediate\r\npossession, that determination can later be altered if a judgment, in a separate suit\r\nadjudicating the parties' rights to other issues involving the real property, results in\r\na different determination of possession.  <em>See Lopez</em>, 76 S.W.3d at 605; <em>see also\r\nMeridien Hotels, Inc.</em>, 97 S.W.3d at 738 (indicating that district court's interlocutory\r\norder declaring that tenants had defaulted under lease, that landlord had right to\r\nterminate lease, and that tenants no longer had right to possession did not excuse\r\njustice court from proceeding with forcible-detainer action).  Accordingly, under the\r\npleadings in this case, the harm that HKDI suffered by the delay of what should have\r\nbeen a speedy determination of the right to immediate possession was mooted when\r\na final judgment, under the trial court's exercise of original jurisdiction and on matters\r\ndetermining the ultimate issue of possession, was rendered.  Put another way, even if\r\nHKDI could somehow obtain an adjudication of the right to immediate possession at\r\nthis time, that determination would be moot because the parties' ultimate rights have\r\nalready been adjudicated and possession has already been awarded based on those\r\nrights.<sup> (23)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThat is not to say that parties in HKDI's position have no remedy.  A party\r\nharmed by the trial court's total denial of a speedy determination of the right to\r\nimmediate possession may seek, by mandamus when the complained-of ruling occurs\r\nor before it becomes moot, that the court be ordered to adjudicate that right despite the\r\npendency of another suit that could ultimately lead to a different determination of\r\npossession for the same property.  Here, HKDI could have sought mandamus relief\r\nfrom the consolidation order before final judgment in the consolidated suit was\r\nrendered: HKDI would have had no adequate remedy by appeal after final judgment\r\nbecause (1) the rendition of that judgment, under these pleadings, would have mooted\r\na determination of the right to immediate possession and (2) under <em>Cahill</em>, the\r\nconsolidation of the forcible-detainer and tort suits was a clear abuse of discretion. \r\n<em>See In re Prudential Ins.

Jury question number 6 reflected this theory by instructing the\r\njury that \"[Duong] cannot be held liable <em>for inducing [HKDI] to violate a contractual\r\nobligation</em> if he acted in good faith and believed what he did was for the best interest\r\nof [HKDI].\"  (Emphasis added.)  The jury was never asked whether Tu had tortiously\r\ninterfered with any of Nguyen's contracts.  The jury also expressly found that HKDI\r\nhad conspired with Duong and that Tu had not, and it implicitly found that the focus\r\nof Duong and HKDI's conspiracy was Duong's tortious interference with Nguyen's\r\nlease agreement with HKDI.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tUnder part of issue three, HKDI and Duong argue, among other things, that the\r\ntrial court erred in rendering judgment on Nguyen's claim for tortious interference\r\nwith contractual relations against Duong because Duong was HKDI's corporate officer\r\nand agent and thus, as a matter of law, could not have tortiously interfered with the\r\nlease agreement between Nguyen and HKDI.<sup> (25)</sup>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\"The elements of tortious interference with a contract are: (1) the existence of\r\na contract subject to interference; (2) willful and intentional interference; (3)\r\ninterference that proximately caused damage; and (4) actual damage or loss.\"  <em>Powell\r\nIndus., Inc. v.

He signed the lease\r\nagreement with Nguyen and Tu on behalf of HKDI.  Nguyen's counsel's questions at\r\ntrial repeatedly equated Duong with HKDI.  Duong testified that he believed that it\r\nwas in the best interest of HKDI to terminate the lease agreement.  Nguyen testified\r\nthat Duong had threatened to evict Nguyen if she testified adversely to Tu's brother,\r\nwho was a friend of Duong's, in her divorce case.  Nguyen's attorney argued in\r\nclosing that Duong's threat showed a \"purely personal\" vendetta that \"ha[d] nothing\r\nto do with [HKDI] or the business or the corporation,\" but he also argued that HKDI\r\n\"c[a]me back and ratified [Duong's] acts, so they're going to be responsible for what\r\nhe did.\"  He further argued in closing that Duong's tortious interference with the lease\r\nagreement was \"for personal reasons.\"  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe above is no evidence that Duong acted solely in his own interest and\r\nagainst HKDI's interests.  Importantly, we have found no evidence--and Nguyen has\r\ndirected us to none--that HKDI objected to Duong's instigating the eviction or that\r\nHKDI's interests lay elsewhere than in evicting Nguyen and Tu.  Indeed, Nguyen's\r\nattorney argued to the jury that HKDI ratified Duong's acts and that that ratification\r\nmade HKDI liable for Duong's acts; moreover, HKDI has consistently remained the\r\nplaintiff in the forcible-detainer suit to evict Nguyen and Tu.  Accordingly, we hold\r\nthat legally insufficient evidence supports the jury's finding that Duong was liable for\r\ntortious interference.  We thus hold that the trial court erred by denying HKDI and\r\nDuong's motion for directed verdict and by overruling their objection to the\r\nsubmission of the jury question on liability for this cause of action.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe sustain this portion of issue three.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>\t\tb.\tCivil Conspiracy</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tNguyen pleaded that all three appellants conspired to evict her.  The conspiracy\r\ncharge was not expressly predicated on a liability question for an underlying wrong;\r\nnonetheless, the only underlying wrong for which damages were assessed was\r\nDuong's tortious interference, so that Duong's tortious interference could have been\r\nthe only basis for conspiracy and thus for HKDI's liability.  Because the claim against\r\nDuong for tortious interference was the only underlying cause of action for which\r\nactual damages were awarded and that could have supported a claim for civil\r\nconspiracy against HKDI or Duong, and because the tortious-interference claim\r\nagainst Duong failed as a matter of law for the reasons stated above, HKDI and Duong\r\nargue, under part of issue three, that the trial court erred in rendering judgment against\r\nthem on Nguyen's civil-conspiracy claim.<sup> (26)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t</span><span>\"Civil conspiracy, generally defined as a combination of two or more persons\r\nto accomplish an unlawful purpose, or to accomplish a lawful purpose by unlawful\r\nmeans, might be called a derivative tort\" because the \"defendant's liability for\r\nconspiracy <em>depends on participation in some underlying tort </em>for which the plaintiff\r\nseeks to hold at least one of the named defendants liable.\"  <em>Tilton v.

We have already sustained HKDI and Duong's legal-sufficiency challenge to the jury's finding that Duong was liable for tortious\r\ninterference.

Accordingly, we hold that\r\nlegally insufficient evidence supports the jury's actual-damages findings (both mental-anguish damages and those for right to defend possession).  We thus hold that the trial\r\ncourt erred by implicitly denying what we have construed as HKDI and Duong's pre-judgment motion for JNOV or to disregard jury findings and by rendering judgment\r\nfor Nguyen for any amount of actual damages.

Only afterwards did\r\nHKDI, not Nguyen, initiate forcible-detainer proceedings.  And later still, the trial\r\ncourt consolidated the proceedings.  This sequence of events demonstrates that\r\nNguyen did not allege declaratory relief solely to obtain fees that were not otherwise\r\nauthorized (indeed, at the time that she filed the tort suit, the DJA clearly authorized\r\nthose fees) or to settle disputes that were already pending before the court.  HKDI and\r\nDuong do not explain how consolidation would retroactively render Nguyen's prior\r\nrequest for declaratory relief a mere subterfuge for obtaining fees.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tSecond, and in any event, the court in a forcible-detainer suit often (as here)\r\nconstrues a lease and considers breaches of or defenses to lease provisions, but it does\r\nso only as part of determining which party has the <em>superior right to immediate\r\npossession</em>.  </span><span><em>See Ward</em>, 115 S.W.3d at 270.  It does not determine the parties' ultimate\r\nrights to any other issue<em> </em>in controversy relating to the particular realty.  <em>Lopez</em>, 76\r\nS.W.3d at 605.  For these reasons, a forcible-detainer suit may run concurrently with\r\nanother action in another court--even if the other action adjudicates matters that could\r\nresult in a different determination of possession from that rendered in the forcible-detainer suit.  <em>See Villalon</em>, 176 S.W.3d at 70-71.  This last concept has been extended\r\nto other suits in which declaratory relief is sought.  <em>Cf.

Under the former standard of <em>Sterling</em>, Tu's expert's\r\ntestimony that <em>Tu's</em> attorney's fees could not be segregated because her defense to the\r\nforcible-detainer suit was inextricably intertwined with her defense against Nguyen's\r\ntort claims is one thing; expert testimony concerning <em>Nguyen's</em> attorney's fees is\r\nanother.  Moreover, Tu's expert's testimony compared <em>the torts or claims that Nguyen\r\nasserted against her</em> (conspiracy, unfair competition, breach of fiduciary duty,\r\nindemnity, and tortious interference with contract) with matters relevant to the\r\nforcible-detainer proceeding.  That testimony did not also consider whether the tort\r\nthat Nguyen had asserted only against HKDI (wrongful eviction), her seeking\r\ninjunctive relief to prevent HKDI from evicting her, her seeking injunctive relief\r\nagainst HKDI and Duong's law firm for having contacted her allegedly in violation\r\nof disciplinary rules, and the matters related to Nguyen's defense against HKDI and\r\nDuong's counter-claim for sanctions were inextricably intertwined with Nguyen's\r\nclaims and defenses for which fees were recoverable.  Additionally, Tu's counsel's\r\ntestimony is conclusory.  And under the new standard of <em>Chapa</em>, whether the claims\r\nwere inextricably intertwined is not the test: rather, the test is whether <em>discrete legal\r\nservices </em>advance both a claim or defense for which fees are recoverable and a claim\r\nor defense for which fees are unrecoverable that fees need not be segregated.  <em>See id.</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe sustain this portion of issue three.  When an appellate court sustains a\r\nchallenge that attorney's fees were not properly segregated, the remedy is to sever that\r\nportion of the judgment awarding attorney's fees and to remand the cause for the issue\r\nto be relitigated.  <em>See Sterling</em>, 822 S.W.2d at 11-12; <em>accord</em> <em>Chapa</em>, 212 S.W.3d at\r\n314; <em>see also</em> <em>Brown v.

Tu bases her challenge\r\non three grounds: (1) the court declared that the lease assignment did not breach the\r\nlease agreement with HKDI, which declaration allegedly eliminated the sole basis for\r\ncontractual indemnity; (2) alternatively, the claims alleged against Nguyen did not fall\r\nwithin the indemnity agreements' unambiguous terms; and (3) Nguyen did not\r\nsegregate evidence of her attorney's fees.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>A.\tPertinent Facts</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tTwo sets of indemnity provisions were at issue in the consolidated suit.

Specifically,\r\nTu contends that only a breach of the lease agreement with HKDI could trigger her\r\nduty to indemnify Nguyen under the lease assignment between Tu and Nguyen.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe disagree.  First, the judgment's recitation on which Tu relies indicates that\r\nthe court found no breach <em>not </em>because the failure to obtain HKDI's prior written\r\nconsent did not violate the lease agreement with HKDI, but instead because that\r\nviolation was excused.  The judgment's recitation that \"the lease agreement was not\r\nbreached <em>by [Nguyen's] and [Tu's] compliance with a Court Ordered assignment of\r\n[Tu's] lease interest</em>,\" along with its reference to the jury's affirmative-defense finding\r\nthat the \"assignment\" was \"excused\" by duress, can be read as a finding that duress\r\nexcused the violation of the lease agreement.  (Emphasis added.)  Accordingly, viewed\r\nin context, the judgment's recitation on which Tu relies is not a finding that she did\r\nnot violate any duties under the lease assignment.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAdditionally, the scope of the lease assignment's indemnity provision was\r\nbroad.  Tu reads this indemnity provision restrictively, as being triggered only if Tu\r\nand Nguyen were held liable for having breached the lease agreement with HKDI.  In\r\ncontrast, the lease assignment's indemnity provision actually read as follows:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\tAssignor [Tu] hereby indemnifies Assignee [Nguyen] and agrees\r\nto hold [Nguyen] harmless from and against any and all claims, demands,\r\nobligations, liabilities, costs, losses and expenses, including without\r\nlimitation attorney's fees <em>resulting from or arising out of all provisions,\r\nagreements, obligations, covenants and conditions which are or were\r\nprovided or required to be </em>paid, <em>performed</em>, discharged, and/or <em>observed\r\nprior to </em>the effective date of this Assignment by [Tu] under or in\r\nconnection with the Lease [between HKDI and Tu and Nguyen].</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>(Emphasis added.)  The indemnity provision was thus triggered by, among other\r\nthings, costs that resulted from or arose out of any obligation (or other listed matter)\r\nthat Tu had to perform under the lease agreement with HKDI.  The scope of this\r\nlanguage was thus broader than simply costs resulting from liability for the lease\r\nagreement's breach.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tTu was the party assigning her leasehold interest to Nguyen.  The lease\r\nagreement required that \"Tenant [Tu and Nguyen] . . . not assign this Lease, or any\r\ninterest therein, . . . without first obtaining the written consent of [HKDI]\" and that\r\n\"[Tu and Nguyen] shall not sell, convey, or assign any interest in the corporation [sic]\r\nwithout prior written approval from [HKDI].\"  It is undisputed that HKDI's written\r\nconsent to the lease assignment was not obtained prior to the assignment's execution. \r\nThat failure came within the scope of the indemnity provision--whether or not the\r\nfailure was ultimately excused by waiver, estoppel, or duress.  The judicial recitation\r\nthat \"the lease agreement was not breached\" did not, therefore, negate the contractual\r\nbasis for indemnity.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe overrule Tu's first issue.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>D.\tThe Challenge That the Claims Against Nguyen Fell Outside the Indemnity\r\nAgreement's Scope</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe lease assignment's indemnity provision required Tu to indemnify Nguyen\r\nonly for failed obligations (or other listed matters) under the lease agreement that Tu\r\nhad to perform \"prior to\" the lease assignment's execution.  In her second issue, Tu\r\nalternatively argues that the failure to obtain HKDI's prior written consent to the lease\r\nassignment could not have occurred <em>before </em>the lease assignment was executed because\r\nthe failure occurred <em>at the time of</em> the assignment's execution.  We reject this\r\nargument.  Although the lease agreement with HKDI was not violated until the\r\nmoment that Tu and Nguyen signed the lease assignment, the obligation that Tu, as\r\nassignor, was required to perform under the lease agreement with HKDI was to obtain\r\nHKDI's <em>prior </em>written consent to the assignment, which failure necessarily occurred\r\nprior to the lease assignment's execution.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe overrule Tu's second issue.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>E.\tNguyen's Failure to Segregate Attorney's Fees</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn her third issue, Tu urges </span><span>that the trial court erred in rendering judgment on\r\nthe jury's verdict for attorney's fees because Nguyen failed to segregate the fees\r\nattributable to those claims for which fees were recoverable from those for which they\r\nwere not</span><span>.  Tu preserved this challenge by charge objection.  <em>See </em></span><span><em>Sterling</em>, 822 S.W.2d\r\nat 10; </span><span><em>Young</em>, 102 S.W.3d at 420.

We construe HKDI and Duong's objections to Nguyen's motion for entry of\r\njudgment as a pre-judgment motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict\r\n(\"JNOV\") or to disregard jury findings because the objections did more than\r\nmerely point out errors in Nguyen's proposed judgment.  <em>See State Bar of Tex.\r\nv.

For instance, HKDI and Duong's\r\n\"objections\" (1) requested that the trial court rule in their favor, (2) stated\r\nreasons that the verdict should be disregarded, (3) argued that no evidence\r\nsupported certain jury findings, and (4) raised legal bars to the rendition of\r\njudgment on the jury's findings.  <em>See </em>6 Roy W.

Moreover,\r\nHKDI and Duong's objections were filed simultaneously with their motion for\r\nentry of judgment, which incorporated by reference their objections, requested\r\na take-nothing judgment on Nguyen's claims and an award of possession, and\r\nrecited that the court was disregarding various jury findings.  HKDI and\r\nDuong's objections and motion for entry of judgment thus together constituted\r\na pre-judgment request for affirmative relief.\r\n</p><p>7. The trial court did not render judgment for the $49,266.66 that the jury had\r\nfound that Nguyen, as a result of Duong's tortious interference, had incurred\r\nin costs defending her right to the leased premises.  Therefore, the sole actual\r\ndamages that the court awarded Nguyen for Duong's tortious interference (and\r\nfor HKDI's and Duong's conspiracy) was $15,000 in mental-anguish damages. \r\nThe parties both represent on appeal that Nguyen elected to recover mental-anguish damages and attorney's fees, rather than also recovering damages for\r\ndefending possession.  Nguyen further represents on appeal that she did so in\r\norder \"to ensure that there was no double recovery\" between the attorney's fees\r\nand the costs of defending possession.\r\n</p><p>8.

After consolidation here, the two cases retained their original cause numbers,\r\nbut one judgment was issued disposing of both cases, and their treatment\r\nindicates that this was a true consolidation.\r\n</p><p>13. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 749 derives from 1925 Revised Statutes article\r\n3987: \"Either party may appeal from a final judgment in such case, to the\r\ncounty court of the county in which the judgment is rendered . . . .\"  Revised\r\nStatutes, 39th Leg., R.S., § 1, art. 3987, 1925 Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. 2, 1082.  The\r\n1925 Revised Statutes used the term \"county court\" to refer both to the\r\nconstitutional county court and to the statutory county court.  <em>See generally\r\n</em>Revised Statutes, 39th Leg., R.S., § 1, arts. 1927-1970, 1925 Tex. Rev. Civ.\r\nStat. 2, 532-539 (title 41, Courts-County, defining duties and powers of\r\ncounty court).  Rule 749 thus allows an appeal to either the constitutional\r\ncounty court or the statutory county court.\r\n</p><p>14. We distinguish the authority on which Nguyen relies for the contrary\r\nproposition.  In <em>West Anderson Plaza v. Feyznia</em>,<em> </em>the county court considered\r\nthe merits of a DTPA counter-claim asserted on appeal in a forcible-detainer\r\naction without mentioning its lack of jurisdiction over that claim.  <em>See id.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2455717\"><a href=\"/opinion/2455717/west-anderson-plaza-v-feyznia/\"><span class=\"volume\">876</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">528</span></a></span>, 531-36 (Tex.

Because there was no subject-matter jurisdiction over any counter-claims or\r\nthird-party claims that Nguyen asserted in the forcible-detainer suit, before\r\nconsolidation, against HKDI or Duong, it is immaterial whether the county\r\ncivil court at law in that suit had personal jurisdiction over Duong--which\r\nDuong argues was lacking over him at that time.\r\n</p><p>17. <em>Guar.

K &amp; K Properties, Inc.</em>, in rejecting a tenant's argument that the\r\nlandlord could not collect rents in a forcible-detainer suit because the tenant\r\nhad relinquished possession of the property by the time of appeal, the court\r\nnoted in dictum that the tenant's objection would have been obviated had the\r\nlandlord sued for rent in county court and then moved to consolidate that suit\r\nwith the forcible-detainer appeal.<em>  See id.</em>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">589</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">860</span></span>, 862 (Tex. Civ.\r\nApp.--Fort Worth 1979, no writ).  <em> </em>We note that rents may be sought in a\r\nforcible-detainer suit; that is not true of Nguyen's claims.  <em>See </em>Tex. R. Civ. P.\r\n738, 752.  In <em>French v.</em> <em>Moore</em> and <em>Green v. Canon</em>, the courts\r\nconsidered--without discussing the propriety of consolidation or the trial\r\ncourt's jurisdiction to do so--appeals in cases in which a county civil court at\r\nlaw had consolidated a forcible-detainer appeal with another suit in which it\r\nwas exercising original jurisdiction.  <em>See French</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1383898\"><a href=\"/opinion/1383898/french-v-moore/\"><span class=\"volume\">169</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (Tex.\r\nApp.--Houston [1st Dist.] 2004, no pet.); <em>Green</em>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">33</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">855</span></span>, 859 (Tex.\r\nApp.--Houston [14th Dist.] 2000, pet. denied).  Because consolidation of a\r\nforcible-detainer appeal with an original-jurisdiction suit is error, but not\r\njurisdictional error, the <em>French</em> and <em>Green</em> courts rightly did not discuss the\r\nissue before them, and the holdings of <em>French</em> and <em>Green</em> are not instructive in\r\nthis case.  <em>See</em> <em>Walling v. Metcalfe</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2429609\"><a href=\"/opinion/2429609/walling-v-metcalfe/\"><span class=\"volume\">863</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span>, 58 (Tex. 1993) (\"We have\r\nheld repeatedly that the courts of appeals may not reverse the judgment of a\r\ntrial court for a reason not raised in a point of error.\").  For this reason, we\r\ndecline to read <em>French</em> and <em>Green </em>as does Nguyen--especially when the only\r\nTexas appellate court (ours, in <em>Cahill</em>) expressly addressing the issue has held\r\ncontrary to Nguyen's reading.\r\n</p><p>22. <em>See Allison v. Ark. La. Gas Co.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1772160\"><a href=\"/opinion/1772160/allison-v-arkansas-louisiana-gas-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">624</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">566</span></a></span>, 568 (Tex. 1981).\r\n</p><p>23. HKDI and Nguyen do not argue that they were harmed by what was, in effect,\r\nthe total denial of a decision on the right to immediate possession under their\r\nforcible-detainer pleadings because (1) they might have prevailed under those\r\npleadings and (2) they could thus have been entitled to recover their costs for\r\nNguyen's withholding possession of the premises during the pendency of the\r\nforcible-detainer appeal.  <em>See </em>Tex. R. Civ. P. 752.  Accordingly, we do not\r\nconsider this aspect in our mootness analysis.\r\n</p><p>24. Because we resolve in HKDI and Duong's favor their legal-sufficiency\r\nchallenges to many of the claims and damages that the trial court allowed by\r\ntrial amendment, we need not determine whether the trial court erred in\r\nallowing those trial amendments.\r\n</p><p>25. HKDI and Duong preserved this complaint by moving for directed verdict and\r\nby objecting to the submission of jury question number 6, concerning tortious\r\ninterference, on this ground.  <em>See Cecil v. Smith</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1498453\"><a href=\"/opinion/1498453/cecil-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">804</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">509</span></a></span>, 510-11\r\n(Tex. 1994).\r\n</p><p>26. HKDI and Duong preserved this challenge by the implicit overruling of their\r\nobjections to Nguyen's proposed judgment and their own motion for entry of\r\njudgment, which asserted this argument and which we have construed as pre-judgment motions for JNOV or to disregard jury findings.  <em>See </em>Tex. R. App. P.\r\n33.1(a)(2)(A); <em>Lenz v. Lenz</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1747741\"><a href=\"/opinion/1747741/lenz-v-lenz/\"><span class=\"volume\">79</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></a></span>, 13 (Tex. 2002) (holding that\r\nappellant preserved complaint raised in pre-judgment JNOV because trial court\r\nimplicitly ruled on JNOV motion by virtue of substance of its judgment that\r\nwas later rendered); <em>First Nat'l Indem.

App.--Beaumont 1998, no pet.). \r\nAdditionally, HKDI and Duong moved for directed verdict on the civil-conspiracy claim because there was no evidence of \"any wrongful or unlawful\r\nact.\"  <em>See Cecil</em>, 804 S.W.2d at 510-11.\r\n</p><p>27. Nguyen asserts that the evidence showed that \"the conspiracy included more\r\nparticipants than simply Tu and Duong.\"  However, the jury was asked to\r\ndetermine only whether HKDI, Tu, and Duong were co-conspirators, not any\r\nother person.  An element of a civil conspiracy claim is two or more persons\r\nparticipate, which means that it was Nguyen's burden to request determinations\r\nof who the participants were.  <em>See </em></p></span><span><em>Tri v. J.T.T.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894665\"><a href=\"/opinion/894665/tri-v-jtt/\"><span class=\"volume\">162</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">552</span></a></span>, 556 (Tex.\r\n2005)</span><span>.  In any event, \"an object to be accomplished\" is also an element of the\r\nclaim, and the only \"object\" on which Nguyen sought a jury determination was\r\nDuong's tortious interference--one for which we have already held that\r\nNguyen adduced legally insufficient evidence.  <em>See id.</em>\r\n<p>28. HKDI and Duong preserved this challenge by the implicit overruling of their\r\nobjection to Nguyen's proposed judgment and their own motion for entry of\r\njudgment, which asserted that the court \"should not <em>award judgment </em>to\r\n[Nguyen]\" on jury question 6, concerning liability for tortious interference. \r\n(Emphasis added.)  <em>See </em>Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a)(2)(A); <em>Lenz</em>, 79 S.W.3d at 13;\r\n<em>First Nat'l Indem. Co.</em>, 753 S.W.2d at 407.  We deem a request that the court\r\nnot \"award judgment\" on a liability question to be broad enough to include a\r\nrequest to disregard any damages finding that is dependant on that liability\r\nquestion.\r\n</p><p>29. HKDI and Duong preserved this challenged by the implicit overruling of their\r\nobjections to Nguyen's motion for entry of judgment and of their motion for\r\njudgment, which asserted that no evidence supported this damages finding.<em> \r\nSee </em>Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a)(2)(A); <em>Lenz</em>, 79 S.W.3d at 13; <em>First Nat'l Indem.\r\nCo.</em>, 753 S.W.2d at 407.\r\n</p><p>30. HKDI and Duong preserved this challenge by objecting to the submission of\r\njury question 7 on this basis.  <em>See Cecil</em>, 804 S.W.2d at 510-11.\r\n</p><p>31. In any event, we have already held that legally insufficient evidence supports\r\nthe jury's civil-conspiracy findings against HKDI and Duong.\r\n</p><p>32. HKDI and Duong sufficiently preserved this challenge by the implicit\r\noverruling of their objection to Nguyen's proposed judgment and their own\r\nmotion for entry of judgment, which asserted (1) that the jury's findings of\r\nmalice against Duong \"improperly rest[ed] on the conspiracy finding, in that\r\nno finding of damages exists as to the conspiracy claim\"; (2) that the jury's\r\naward of punitive damages against HKDI and Duong \"does not rest on a\r\nfinding of actual damages\"; and (3) that \"no evidence supports the jury's\r\nfinding of punitive damages\" against HKDI and Duong.  <em>See </em>Tex. R. App. P.\r\n33.1(a)(2)(A); <em>Lenz</em>, 79 S.W.3d at 13; <em>First Nat'l Indem. Co.</em>, 753 S.W.2d at\r\n407.  Although these objections differ slightly from that raised on appeal, they\r\ntogether sufficiently advised the court that submission of the punitive-damages\r\nissue was improper because of the failure of a predicate concerning actual\r\ndamages.  <em>See</em> Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a)(1)(A) (providing that, to preserve error,\r\nmotion must state grounds \"with sufficient specificity to make the trial court\r\naware of the complaint.\").\r\n</p><p>33. HKDI and Duong preserved this challenge by objecting to the submission of\r\njury question 16 on this basis.  <em>See Cecil</em>, 804 S.W.2d at 510-11.\r\n</p><p>34. The malice question supporting the award of punitive damages was predicated\r\non a finding that Duong was liable for civil conspiracy only.  The only actual\r\ndamages awarded were for Duong's tortious interference, not civil conspiracy. \r\nHowever, his liability for civil conspiracy was implicitly predicated on his\r\nliability for tortious interference.  Because HKDI and Duong do not argue\r\notherwise on appeal, we assume without deciding the award of actual damages\r\nagainst Duong for tortious interference could, in the abstract, support an award\r\nof punitive damages against Duong under this charge.\r\n</p><p>35. HKDI and Duong also argue that the trial court erred in rendering judgment for\r\nthe attorney's fees that the jury found because they could not be supported by\r\nProperty Code section 24.006(c),<sup> (36)</sup>\r\n</p><p>36.     - \r\n           \r\n            § \r\n              \r\n    \r\n</p><p>37. Although HKDI and Duong did not state their challenge (2) in the trial court\r\nin the exact terms stated on appeal, they did assert below that Nguyen \"cannot\r\nrecover legal fees based on her declaratory judgment action,\" which we deem\r\nsufficiently to have preserved their appellate argument.\r\n</p><p>38. <em>See </em>Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. § 37.009 (Vernon 1997)</p></span><span>; Tex. Prop.\r\nCode Ann. § 24.006 (Vernon 2000); </span><span>Tex. R. Civ. P. 752</span><span>.\r\n<p>39. <em>See </em></p></span><span><em>Tony Gullo Motors I, L.P. v. Chapa</em>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">212</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">299</span></span>, 311 (Tex. 2006)\r\n(\"Absent a contract or statute, trial courts do not have inherent authority to\r\nrequire a losing party to pay the prevailing party's fees.\")</span><span>.\r\n<p>40. In a few paragraphs in their opening and reply briefs, HKDI and Duong\r\nmention that the lease agreement's anti-assignment clause \"nullifies\" or\r\n\"violates\" the lease assignment as a matter of law, even if the assignment\r\noccurs \"by operation of law,\" which might be a reference to the court's order\r\nto sign the lease assignment.  The other times that they mention the anti-assignment clause, they do so in support of their jurisdictional or no-evidence\r\narguments, not as a challenge to the jury's duress finding.  These brief\r\nstatements do not amount to appellate challenges to the jury's duress finding. \r\nAdditionally, as mentioned above, their issue two is phrased in terms of\r\nwhether the trial court erred in allowing Nguyen belatedly to assert waiver and\r\nestoppel, which argument could not apply to duress, and HKDI and Duong\r\nexpressly state that they \"ha[ve] never challenged the merits of the issue of\r\npossession,\" to which the merits of the duress defense relates.\r\n</p><p>41. <em>See</em> Tex.
