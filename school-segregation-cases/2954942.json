Two attackers\n\nrepeatedly assaulted the much smaller and weaker victim, sometimes kicking her, sometimes\n\nslamming her into the wall, sometimes striking her with belts. They made her stand barefooted\n\nand motionless for hours at a time, sometimes atop an overturned plastic milk crate cast using a\n\nlarge open grid pattern, which caused her additional pain. When she faltered, she was further\n\nassaulted. As if the victim had not suffered enough, on the final day of the attacks, her female\n\nattacker repeatedly pushed the exhausted victim backward onto the floor. Each fall caused the\n\nvictim‘s head to hit the floor; the last time hard enough so a witness heard the victim‘s ―brain\n\ncrack.‖ The victim, River Phoenix Williams, died from her injuries.\n\n        River Phoenix was two years old. The attackers were her father and the father‘s live-in\n\ngirlfriend.\n\n        Just as River Phoenix had been entitled to the protections of the law, her attackers, too, are\n\nentitled to all applicable protective provisions of the law.\n\n        Latoya Smith, the live-in girlfriend, was convicted in River Phoenix‘s death, after River\n\nPhoenix‘s father, Neil Patrick Dewitt, had pled guilty to the same crime.\n\n        Sentenced to life imprisonment without parole, Smith appeals, urging a number of\n\narguments but making no challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to prove the offense of\n\n\n\n                                                  2\n\fcapital murder. We affirm the trial court‘s judgment because (1) the State‘s nondisclosure of\n\ncertain evidence did not require an in camera inspection of the State‘s file or a mistrial, (2) no\n\nConfrontation Clause violation arose from the trial court‘s rulings regarding the testimony of\n\nWade and Roberson, (3) admitting River Phoenix‘s autopsy report did not violate the\n\nConfrontation Clause, (4) excluding evidence of Smith‘s mental health history during the\n\nguilt/innocence phase was not error, and (5) admitting evidence of Smith‘s prior behavior and\n\nattitude toward River Phoenix was not error. We address the arguments in that order, after\n\nrecounting the facts in greater detail.\n\n       Before her death, River Phoenix lived with Dewitt, Smith, and River Phoenix‘s minor\n\nsister, K.T. Dewitt admitted that he was party to the abuse that caused his child‘s death, pled\n\nguilty to capital murder, and also received a sentence of life imprisonment without parole. He\n\ntestified against Smith during her trial, consistently said that the two of them killed River Phoenix,\n\nand enlightened the jury on the origins of Smith‘s jealousy, dislike, and abuse of River Phoenix,\n\nwho was Dewitt‘s daughter by another woman. Dewitt stated, ―When I found out that [River\n\nPhoenix] was my child, [Smith] had said, well, there‘s your child you could‘ve had with me.‖\n\nDewitt also testified that Smith would never accept River Phoenix, and felt that Dewitt ―cheated on\n\nher because [River Phoenix] came in after we were together.‖ Smith‘s journal complained that\n\nDewitt told River Phoenix that Smith was picking on her.\n\n       So now whenever I come in the room when she‘s eating she stops eating and\n       watches me like I‘m the TV . . ., so now I don‘t go into any room that she‘s in and I\n\n\n                                                  3\n\f        don‘t say anything to her and I leave her and [Dewitt] alone and they seem to do\n        just fine without me around. Good news, she goes home [to her mother] on the\n        first of the month. The bad news is today is only the 27th of the month. I have\n        never disliked a child so much in my life. I wish she didn‘t exist.\n\nFor this reason, both Dewitt and K.T. testified, Smith had a ―bad‖ relationship with River Phoenix\n\nresulting in child abuse.\n\n        Some of Smith‘s treatment of River Phoenix was described by Kiara Kashawn Wade and\n\nher mother, Evelyn Roberson. Smith, a stay-at-home hair stylist, booked an appointment with\n\nWade for hair braiding. When Wade and Roberson arrived, they noticed that River Phoenix was\n\nleft in the back yard alone. Wade testified:\n\n        When [Smith] started to braid my hair, [River Phoenix] was standing next to us,\n        and [Smith] didn‘t like that. She said, go play with the toys or go play with the\n        dog. And [River Phoenix] didn‘t move, she just stood there. And that‘s when\n        [Smith] went on saying, we bought her all these toys and she don‘t play with them,\n        and she ended up siccing the dog on the baby, making the baby cry . . . . [Smith] was\n        just putting the dog on the baby.\n\nWade asked Smith to stop, to which Smith replied, ―[I]f you don‘t like it, then you can take her\n\nhome with you.‖ Smith then forced River Phoenix to stand in a corner for seven hours. ―After\n\nshe put her in a corner, [River Phoenix] kept crying . . . . But as [Smith] was talking to me . . . . she\n\nwas talking about [River Phoenix‘s] mother, she was throwing stuff at the baby; hairbrushes, she\n\nthrew some grease at her, and she threw a shoe at her.‖ Smith reportedly told Wade that she\n\nhoped Dewitt ―did get custody of the baby, that way she could do what she wanted to with [River\n\nPhoenix].‖ Wade said, ―[Y]ou could tell [River Phoenix] wanted to sit down. You know, a\n\n\n\n                                                   4\n\fbaby‘s legs . . . she was shaking . . . . She had been standing for almost six hours now.‖ At one\n\npoint, Smith checked River Phoenix‘s diaper, found it dirty, told her she stank, ―smashed‖ the\n\ndiaper against her, and ―made her sit in it.‖ Smith refused Wade‘s offer of help to change the\n\ndiaper. When Wade offered River Phoenix food, Smith ―knocked it out of [her] hand‖ and\n\noffered River Phoenix the food herself. When River Phoenix backed away, Smith said that she\n\nhad ―a nasty attitude towards the people that take care of her, but with everybody else that she\n\ndon‘t know she‘s very friendly.‖ Toward the end of the evening, Dewitt arrived and was\n\ninstructed not to feed River Phoenix ―anything because all the food in the house belonged to\n\n[Smith].‖ The couple joked and ―said they treat the dog better than they treat [River Phoenix]\n\nbecause her attitude is so messed up.‖ A distraught Wade returned to Roberson‘s house and\n\nreported the day‘s events. Roberson attempted an intervention with Dewitt and Smith, which\n\nresulted in Smith cursing the child and blaming her for her stubbornness. The couple told\n\nRoberson that River Phoenix ―was the problem.‖\n\n       The problems continued. The day before River Phoenix‘s death, she ―was in her chair and\n\ndidn‘t want to eat.‖ Smith became upset, yelled at the child, took her from the dinner table, and\n\ngave her a bath instead. Then, River Phoenix was instructed to dress herself. When the\n\ntwo-year-old was unsuccessful at this task, Smith spanked the child with a red leather belt that had\n\na brass buckle, a weapon used regularly by Smith to beat the child. Smith ―had beat her for a\n\nwhile, and then she got increasingly frustrated and passed her to‖ Dewitt, who beat her with a\n\n\n\n                                                 5\n\fblack leather belt. At one point, Dewitt ―hit her once over the top of the head with the belt.‖\n\nDewitt justified his actions by claiming to be supportive of Smith‘s theory that River Phoenix was\n\ncoddled.\n\n       The couple passed the baby back and forth between themselves for continued beatings over\n\nthe course of several hours. The whippings ended after Smith grabbed the child by her arms,\n\n―rammed her into the wall,‖ ―dropped kicked her out of the way,‖ and walked away from her. As\n\nif the child had not suffered enough, she was later made to stand, without shoes, on a plastic crate\n\ncast with a large grid pattern in its plastic body. After Dewitt nudged her with his foot, River\n\nPhoenix fell from the crate, hit her head on a nearby nightstand, climbed back up, and continued to\n\nstand throughout the night.\n\n       The next morning, Dewitt left for work, and K.T. boarded her school bus. Dewitt had\n\nbeen ―cheating on‖ Smith with another woman whom he met on the Yahoo Singles dating website.\n\nSmith discovered the website and called Dewitt at work to inquire about the other woman. He\n\nreceived angry telephone calls all day culminating in threats against River Phoenix‘s life,\n\nincluding one instructing Dewitt ―to be careful when I pulled into the garage because [River\n\nPhoenix] would be lying there dead.‖ Dewitt did not rush home.\n\n       Around 1:00 p.m., Karrie Sue McNeil arrived to clean the apartment next door. She\n\nnoticed the unmistakable sound, coming from the Dewitt-Smith residence, of a baby crying and\n\nscreaming in pain. The child continued to cry and scream for the entire hour and a half it took\n\n\n\n                                                 6\n\fMcNeil to finish her job. While she contemplated reporting her suspicions, McNeil did not act on\n\nthat idea.\n\n          K.T. testified that she returned from school that day to find River Phoenix ―standing in the\n\ncorner hunched over, and her knees—her legs were swelled up and she had bags under her eyes.‖\n\nSmith sat on the couch and would hit River Phoenix ―with the belt on her legs‖ when the baby\n\nwould fall down from standing. K.T. was forbidden to intervene. When Smith had her fill of\n\nthis torture, K.T. was allowed to bathe River Phoenix. K.T. observed ―[s]he had whip marks on\n\nher legs and on her back‖ and ―nail marks on the back of her ear[s].‖ After the bath, K.T. took her\n\nbaby sister to the living room where Smith was watching television. Smith ―kneeled down in\n\nfront of‖ the baby, and ―pushed her down.‖ River Phoenix fell backward, hit her head on the\n\nfloor, and began to cry. When she stumbled up to a standing position, Smith twice repeated this\n\naction. As a result of the third push to the ground, K.T. heard River Phoenix‘s ―brain crack.‖\n\nRiver Phoenix ―laid there looking at the ceiling,‖ and ―was wobbling‖ after she managed to stand\n\nup again. K.T. could tell her sister was badly injured. She next witnessed Smith call Dewitt and\n\ntell him ―[s]he was going to hang [River Phoenix] with her red belt.‖ At 9:00 p.m., K.T. was sent\n\nto bed.\n\n          Dewitt finally arrived around 9:30 p.m. to find River Phoenix ―in a full-blown seizure‖\n\nwhile Smith sat apathetically on the couch watching television. Dewitt made the decision not to\n\nseek emergency medical care after observing the extensive bruising on River Phoenix‘s body. He\n\n\n\n                                                   7\n\ftestified Smith sat on the couch ―and kept rocking backing [sic] and forth, and she was like, I‘m\n\ngoing to jail, I‘m going to jail, I‘m going to jail.‖ River Phoenix suffered a second seizure. After\n\nputting River Phoenix in K.T.‘s bedroom, Dewitt ate dinner and went to bed, while Smith stayed\n\nawake pacing the hall.\n\n       K.T. checked on her sister the next morning. ―Her breathing was slowing down and her\n\nheart was slowing down.‖ She informed her father, but went to school after his assurance that\n\nRiver Phoenix would be fine.\n\n       Shortly thereafter, River Phoenix died.\n\n       The couple ―talked about blaming it on [K.T.] and saying that [K.T.] had kept hitting her,\n\nand that [Dewitt] would drive and dispose of the belts.‖ While Dewitt was disposing of evidence,\n\nSmith called the police.\n\n       Officer Latriesha Grandy spoke with Smith, who ―didn‘t show any concern for River\n\nPhoenix or her well-being or the kind of shape she was in. It seems that her goal was to make sure\n\nshe‖ blamed K.T. for River Phoenix‘s injuries. After speaking with Detective Gisela Altamirano,\n\nhowever, Smith began to blame Dewitt, and then the family dog, for River Phoenix‘s condition.\n\nGrandy found River Phoenix nonresponsive with ―bruises all over her body‖ consistent with\n\nphysical abuse to her forehead, abdomen, arms, legs, and ears. LifeNet responder James Pappas\n\ntestified ―[t]here were various bruises of different sizes, shapes, locations, everywhere. The best\n\nway to describe it you couldn‘t take your hand and place it anywhere on that child that your hand\n\n\n\n                                                 8\n\fwould not touch a bruise or more than one bruise.‖\n\n           Dewitt and Smith followed River Phoenix to the hospital. Doctors informed Altamirano\n\nthey believed the child had undergone severe physical abuse. The couple was arrested, and Smith\n\ngave inconsistent recorded statements to police about the causes of River Phoenix‘s bruising and\n\nher death. River Phoenix‘s autopsy report confirmed ―extensive blunt force trauma, abrasions,\n\nlacerations, and contusions over much of the body surface, including the head, the trunk, and all\n\nfour extremities, widely scattered throughout the body,‖ with the cause of death being blunt head\n\ntrauma.\n\n(1)        The State’s Nondisclosure of Certain Evidence Did Not Require an in Camera Inspection\n           of the State’s File or a Mistrial\n\n           Smith contends that she made a plausible showing entitling her to an in camera inspection\n\nof the State‘s files by arguing the State violated the Brady1 rule in failing to disclose Dewitt‘s\n\nstatements made to Justice of the Peace Nancy Talley, his handwritten notes, and a DNA test\n\nresult. In the same point of error,2 she also maintains that she was entitled to a mistrial because of\n\nthis nondisclosure.\n\n\n1\n    Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87 (1963).\n2\n A multifarious issue is one that raises more than one specific ground of error. In re S.K.A., 236 S.W.3d 875, 894\n(Tex. App.—Texarkana 2007, pet. denied). We have repeatedly warned litigants to refrain from raising multifarious\npoints of error. See, e.g., In re Guardianship of Moon, 216 S.W.3d 506, 508 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2007, no pet.);\nNewby v. State, 169 S.W.3d 413, 414 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2005, pet. ref‘d). Failure to heed our warnings runs the\nrisk of having any multifarious issue(s) being summarily overruled. Newby, 169 S.W.3d at 414; Harris v. State, 133\nS.W.3d 760, 764 n.3 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2004, pet. ref‘d); Parra v. State, 935 S.W.3d 862, 875 (Tex.\nApp.—Texarkana 1996, pet. ref‘d). In the interest of addressing substantive issues, we will not take the opportunity\nin this case to overrule this point of error on the basis of it being multifarious.\n\n                                                         9\n\f        We overrule these assertions by Smith because (A) Smith discovered Talley‘s statements\n\nin time to effectively handle them at trial, (B) the trial court never ruled on whether the State‘s\n\nfailure to timely disclose Dewitt‘s handwritten notes violated Brady, (C) no ruling was requested\n\nregarding the negative DNA test results, and (D) mistrial was not required in any case.\n\n        We first address the first three subpoints, all seeking to trigger an in camera inspection of\n\nthe State‘s file.\n\n        The United States Supreme Court case of Brady established that nondisclosure of evidence\n\nviolates due process rights of an accused where it is: (1) suppressed by the State after request for\n\nthe evidence is made by the defense; (2) favorable to the defense; and (3) material to the outcome\n\nof the case. 373 U.S. at 87; Thomas v. State, 841 S.W.2d 399, 402–03 (Tex. Crim. App. 1992) (en\n\nbanc) (citing Moree v. Illinois, 408 U.S. 786 (1972)).\n\n        ―There is no general constitutional right to discovery in a criminal case, and Brady did not\n\ncreate one.‖ Weatherford v. Bursey, 429 U.S. 545, 559 (1976); Menefee v. State, 211 S.W.3d 893,\n\n902 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2006, pet. ref‘d). ―Thus, the prosecutor is not required to deliver his\n\nentire file to defense counsel, but only to disclose evidence favorable to the accused that, if\n\nsuppressed, would deprive the defendant of a fair trial.‖ United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667,\n\n675 (1985). ―In some situations where a defendant has failed to receive anything less than full\n\ndisclosure under the Brady rule, he has a due process right to have the trial court examine the\n\nrequested evidence in camera and then order disclosure of any appropriate information.‖\n\n\n\n                                                 10\n\fMichaelwicz v. State, 186 S.W.3d 601, 614 (Tex. App.—Austin 2006, pet. ref‘d).\n\n        To be entitled to have the trial court review the State‘s file, however, Smith was required to\n\n―establish a basis for [her] claim that it contain[ed] material evidence.‖ Pennsylvania v. Ritchie,\n\n480 U.S. 39, 58, n.15 (1987) (citing United States v. Valenzuela-Bernal, 458 U.S. 858, 867 (1982)\n\n(A defendant ―must at least make some plausible showing of how their testimony would have been\n\nboth material and favorable to [the] defense.‖)); see Ransonette v. State, 550 S.W.2d 36, 40 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 1976) (―we know of no constitutional obligation of the trial court to peruse the\n\nprosecutor‘s file for exculpatory evidence in the absence of a specific request supported by some\n\nshowing that such evidence exists‖).\n\n        We review for abuse of discretion the issue of whether Smith made a sufficient showing to\n\nrequire an in camera inspection, while keeping in mind that the trial court is the sole judge of the\n\ncredibility of the witnesses. See Page v. State, 7 S.W.3d 202, 207–08 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth\n\n1999, pet. ref‘d).\n\n        (A)     Smith Discovered Talley’s Statements in Time to Effectively Handle Them at Trial\n\n        Talley testified Dewitt told her ―that his girlfriend went to correct her and the little girl\n\neither clawed at her hand or bit at her hand or something to that effect, and she became upset.\n\nAnd when she became upset, he didn‘t like his girlfriend being upset and he totally lost it.‖ ―He\n\nalso told me that he picked her up, and at some point when he let go of her, she—something about\n\na coffee table.‖\n\n\n\n                                                 11\n\f        After Talley was cross-examined, she was excused without objection. Immediately after\n\nTalley was excused, Smith raised the issue of a Brady violation and argued Talley‘s testimony was\n\nexculpatory because Dewitt never indicated to Talley that Smith had any responsibility for River\n\nPhoenix‘s death. The State responded that there were no written documents supporting Talley‘s\n\ntestimony and alleged that Smith was in the room while Dewitt made the statements.\n\n        In ruling that failing to disclose Talley‘s testimony did not violate Brady, the trial court\n\nfound Smith‘s counsel had discovered the substance of her testimony in sufficient time to prepare\n\nfor trial. This was demonstrated by the subpoena, directing Talley to appear and testify, issued at\n\nSmith‘s request made seven days before trial. The trial court also found that Talley‘s testimony\n\nwas not material.\n\n        It is well settled that the government has the obligation to turn over evidence in its\n\npossession that is both favorable to the accused and material to guilt or punishment. Ritchie, 480\n\nU.S. at 57 (citing Brady, 373 U.S. at 87). Evidence ―is material only if there is a reasonable\n\nprobability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would\n\nhave been different.‖ Id.; Thomas, 841 S.W.2d at 404. Because ―the materiality issue turns on\n\nwhether the defendant was prejudiced by delayed disclosure,‖ ―if the defendant actually knows\n\nthe facts which are withheld, he is not entitled to relief based upon the State‘s failure to disclose the\n\nsame facts.‖ Williams v. State, 995 S.W.2d 754, 761 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 1999, no pet.);\n\n\n\n\n                                                   12\n\fState v. DeLeon, 971 S.W.2d 701, 706 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 1998, pet. ref‘d).3\n\n         As trier of fact, the trial court was free to believe Talley‘s testimony that Smith was present\n\nduring Dewitt‘s statements and that counsel was aware of the substance of her testimony. It\n\napparently so believed, since it ruled that there was no Brady violation with regard to Talley‘s\n\ntestimony.\n\n\n\n\n         (B)      The Trial Court Never Ruled on Whether the State’s Failure to Timely Disclose\n                  Dewitt’s Handwritten Notes Violated Brady\n\n         During Dewitt‘s testimony at trial, Smith‘s attorney noticed Dewitt was holding\n\nhandwritten notes, which reportedly were Dewitt‘s personal notes made shortly before trial. The\n\nState claimed it had received a copy of the notes the week before trial. The notes were made by\n\nDewitt, contained a time line of events, the majority of the substance of Dewitt‘s testimony, and\n\nthe following statements, among others, which could be viewed as exculpatory or impeachment\n\nevidence:4\n\n         I had punched her and she fell on the floor backwards . . . . I had hit her over the\n         head-strap part of my belt. Latoya said she was bleeding after that\n         on the scalp . . . . I then put her on [the] crate by the nightstand. She was at the\n\n3\n  Further, ―failure to request a continuance waives any Brady violation‖ and indicates the evidence was, in fact, not\nmaterial. Williams, 995 S.W.2d at 761 (citing Lindley v. State, 635 S.W.2d 541, 544 (Tex. Crim. App. [Panel Op.]\n1982)); Yates v. State, 941 S.W.2d 357, 364 (Tex. App.—Waco 1997, pet. ref‘d). We note that counsel‘s request for\ncontinuance occurred after Talley was excused.\n4\n  Impeachment evidence ―falls within the Brady rule.‖ Bagley, 473 U.S. at 676.\n\n                                                         13\n\f       edge. I then took my foot while lying down and nudged her to the middle where\n       she fell and hit her head on the nightstand . . . . I got home at 9:26 p.m. to find River\n       Phoenix in a full seizure at that time . . . . [Latoya] asked do you want to take her to\n       the hospital . . . I saw the bruise on her mid section and said ―F*** No.‖ She had\n       another real quick seizure and it stopped. She had opened her eyes and then she\n       closed them and I thought she was asleep . . . I was assured by Latoya that she\n       didn‘t hit her head . . . I had repeatedly pushed River Phoenix down and she would\n       fall backwards and land on the purple rug and then made to get back up . . . I told\n       Latoya I [threw] the belts out . . . I was going to get rid of the belts.\n\n       Smith‘s counsel moved for mistrial and argued that the State‘s failure to disclose this time\n\nline violated Brady. He also argued that failure to disclose the notes should be considered in\n\ndetermining whether the court should grant the in camera inspection. The State responded that,\n\nalthough the time line was received by the prosecutor‘s office, they were ―never part of the file.‖\n\nNoting that it had previously ordered the State to disclose such information, the trial court arranged\n\nto have copies of the notes made, allowed the State to conclude its direct examination, and\n\ndeclared an overnight recess to give Smith‘s attorney ―an opportunity to use it to prepare\n\ncross-examination of Mr. Dewitt.‖ The motion for mistrial was denied.\n\n       The following morning, Smith‘s counsel moved for a seven-day continuance and\n\ncomplained that the notes ―completely eviscerated my defense.‖ Although the trial court decided\n\nthe State suppressed favorable evidence in spite of a proper request by the defense, it found that the\n\nmateriality of the notes had not yet been established and indicated it would carry the objection until\n\nthe end of cross-examination.\n\n       For a complaint for appellate review to be preserved, the trial court must have ―ruled on the\n\n\n\n                                                  14\n\frequest, objection, or motion, either expressly or implicitly,‖ or must have ―refused to rule on the\n\nrequest‖ despite objection to the refusal to rule. TEX. R. APP. P. 33.1. Here, the record reveals\n\nthat the trial court never ruled on the issue of whether the handwritten notes violated Brady. This\n\nwas acknowledged by Smith in her brief.\n\n       (C)     No Ruling Was Requested Regarding the Negative DNA Test Results\n\n       During a search of Smith‘s residence, officers located a broken broom. A test indicated\n\nthere was blood on the broom, but a subsequent DNA test excluded River Phoenix as the source of\n\nthe blood. Smith was provided a copy of the DNA results, and she introduced a copy of those\n\nresults at trial. While complaining of untimely disclosure of the DNA results, Smith does not\n\nraise the issue of whether a Brady violation occurred with respect to the DNA test results. Since\n\nthe State did disclose the test results, and no objection to the results was made, the trial court was\n\nfree to determine that Smith‘s argument, raised during her motion for in camera inspection after\n\nintroduction of the DNA test results, provided no plausible basis that the State‘s files would\n\ncontain further undisclosed, material evidence.\n\n       In sum, the trial court concluded that it ―has no duty to do an in camera investigation,‖\n\nbecause no Brady violation occurred. Without a plausible showing that the State‘s file contained\n\nundisclosed material evidence, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in\n\nfailing to grant Smith‘s motion for an in camera inspection.\n\n       (D)     Mistrial Was Not Required in any Case\n\n\n\n                                                  15\n\f        ―Only in extreme circumstances, where the prejudice is incurable, will a mistrial be\n\nrequired.‖ Archie v. State, 221 S.W.3d 695, 699 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007) (quoting Hawkins v.\n\nState, 135 S.W.3d 72, 77 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004)). We review a trial court‘s ruling on a motion\n\nfor mistrial for an abuse of discretion.       Towery v. State, 262 S.W.3d 586, 598 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Texarkana 2008, pet. ref‘d) (citing Archie, 221 S.W.3d at 699). We will uphold the trial\n\ncourt‘s ruling if it was within the zone of reasonable disagreement. Archie, 221 S.W.3d at 699\n\n(citing Wead v. State, 129 S.W.3d 126, 129 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004)).\n\n        Because the trial court could find the lack of incurable prejudice to Smith resulting from\n\nany of the above, we conclude it did not abuse its discretion in overruling Smith‘s motion for\n\nmistrial.\n\n\n\n(2)     No Confrontation Violation Arose from the Trial Court’s Rulings Regarding the Testimony\n        of Wade and Roberson\n\n        Smith argues that the trial court violated the Confrontation Clause by limiting her cross-\n\nexamination on the subject of Wade‘s and Roberson‘s participation in the Hell‘s Lovers biker\n\ngroup. We disagree.\n\n        (A)    Wade’s Testimony Was Not Limited by the Trial Court\n\n        During Wade‘s cross-examination, the following exchange occurred:\n\n               Q.      Now, your mother is Evelyn Roberson?\n\n               A.      Yes . . . .\n\n\n                                                16\n\f               Q.      And her husband is Nathaniel Roberson?\n\n               A.      Yes.\n\n               Q.      And he‘s a member of Hell‘s Lovers?\n\n                      Mr. Shepherd: Your Honor, the State is going to object once again\n       to the relevance of that.\n\n                       THE COURT: Well, I‘ll allow that question.\n\n               Q.      [Mr. Henry] He‘s a member of the Hell‘s Lovers?\n\n               A.      Yes, sir.\n\n               Q.      And your mother, is she property of the Hell‘s Lovers?\n\n                       Mr. Shepherd: Once again, Judge, this is not relevant to the issue\n       before this jury.\n\n                      THE COURT: Well, the Court will sustain that, also the\n       characterization.\n\n               A.      At the time she was, yes.\n\n                       Mr. Shepherd: You don‘t have to answer that.\n\n               A.      Oh, okay.\n\n                       [Defense Counsel]: Pass the witness, Your Honor.\n\n                       Mr. Shepherd: Nothing further.\n\n                       THE COURT: All right, you can step down.\n\nIn her brief, Smith complains that the trial court did not allow her to establish that Wade‘s mother\n\n\n\n                                                   17\n\fwas ―property‖ of the Hell‘s Lovers biker gang. Review of the record demonstrates that Wade\n\nprovided the answer counsel sought, the answer was not struck, Smith‘s counsel passed the\n\nwitness, and Smith did not attempt (and, thus, the trial court did not limit) further\n\ncross-examination.5\n\n        (B)      Limiting Roberson’s Testimony Was Within the Trial Court’s Discretion, Based on\n                 Its Lack of Relevance and the Failure to Show Roberson’s Bias Against Smith\n\n        The right to cross-examination extends to any matter that could reflect on the witness‘\n\ncredibility. Virts v. State, 739 S.W.2d 25, 28 (Tex. Crim. App. 1987). The right of an accused to\n\ncross-examine a testifying State‘s witness includes the right to impeach the witness with relevant\n\nevidence that might reflect bias, interest, prejudice, inconsistent statements, traits of character\n\naffecting credibility, or evidence that might go to any impairment or disability affecting the\n\nwitness‘ credibility. Id. at 29; Alexander v. State, 949 S.W.2d 772, 774 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1997,\n\npet. ref‘d). Thus, the scope of cross-examination should extend to all facts and circumstances\n\nthat, when tested by human experience, tend to show that a witness may shade his or her testimony\n\nfor the purpose of helping to establish only one side of the cause. Carroll v. State, 916 S.W.2d\n\n494, 497–98 (Tex. Crim. App. 1996); Alexander, 949 S.W.2d at 774–75.\n\n        Although a defendant‘s right to confrontation and cross-examination is constitutionally\n\nsafeguarded, the right is not absolute. Chambers v. Mississippi, 410 U.S. 284, 295 (1973); Huff v.\n\nState, 897 S.W.2d 829, 839 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1995, pet. ref‘d). The trial court retains great\n\n5\n The record demonstrates that Smith did not argue that she be allowed to continue questioning Wade about Hell‘s\nLovers to examine possible bias. This argument was only offered in reference to Roberson‘s cross-examination.\n\n                                                      18\n\flatitude in imposing reasonable limitations on cross-examination. Virts, 739 S.W.2d at 28. The\n\ncourt may properly limit the scope of cross-examination to prevent harassment, prejudice,\n\nconfusion of the issues, harm to the witness, and repetitive or marginally relevant interrogation.\n\nCarroll, 916 S.W.2d at 497. When considering whether a trial court‘s decision to exclude\n\ntestimony is error, we must determine whether the trial court abused its discretion. Love v. State,\n\n861 S.W.2d 899, 903 (Tex. Crim. App. 1993). This inquiry depends on the facts of each case.\n\nId. at 904.\n\n        During Roberson‘s cross-examination, Smith requested the trial court‘s permission to\n\ninquire about her participation in Hell‘s Lovers. Smith argued the evidence was relevant for the\n\npurpose of demonstrating bias toward Dewitt. ―[T]he right to cross-examination includes the\n\nopportunity to show that a witness is biased, or that the testimony is exaggerated or unbelievable.‖\n\nRitchie, 480 U.S. at 51–52. However, the court reminded counsel that Roberson testified against\n\nboth Dewitt and Smith. It stated, ―Well, I think that you can go into the fact that her husband and\n\nDewitt are friends. I think that you can go into the fact—you can ask whether or not due to that\n\nfriendship would she have a tendency to testify as to—based on that relationship.‖\n\n        A proffer outside the jury‘s presence produced the following testimony:\n\n              Q.      And Mr. Nathaniel Roberson is a member of the Hell‘s Lovers\n        motorcycle gang?\n\n               A.       That is not correct. He‘s a member of the Hell‘s Lovers motorcycle\n        club. It is not a gang.\n\n\n\n                                                19\n\f               Q.      Okay. And the Hell‘s Lovers motorcycle club, what exactly is that?\n\n                A.      It‘s an organization. They ride motorcycles, and they‘re located in\n       a lot of different states . . . .\n\n              Q.     . . . were you property of the Hell‘s Lovers motorcycle\n       organization?\n\n               A.      Sir, I am not a member of the Hell‘s Lovers organization.\n\nCounsel did not question Roberson on the subject of bias. Here, the trial court concluded that\n\ntestimony regarding participation in Hell‘s Lovers, absent evidence of bias, was irrelevant to the\n\nissue of whether Smith intentionally or knowingly caused River Phoenix‘s death. Because there\n\nwas no error in that finding, there was no violation of the Confrontation Clause.\n\n(3)    Admitting River Phoenix’s Autopsy Report Did Not Violate the Confrontation Clause\n\n       Smith contends that the autopsy report constituted testimonial hearsay and that its\n\nadmission violated her Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses against her. We disagree.\n\n       We review a trial court‘s decision to admit evidence under an abuse of discretion standard.\n\nMcDonald v. State, 179 S.W.3d 571, 576 (Tex. Crim. App. 2005). ―Although we defer to a trial\n\ncourt‘s determination of historical facts and credibility, we review a constitutional legal ruling . . .\n\nde novo.‖ Wall v. State, 184 S.W.3d 730, 742 (Tex. Crim. App. 2006). A trial court‘s ruling to\n\nadmit evidence will not be reversed as long as it falls within the zone of reasonable disagreement.\n\nSee Montgomery v. State, 810 S.W.2d 372, 391 (Tex . Crim. App. 1990) (op. on reh‘g).\n\n       ―[I]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to . . . be confronted with\n\n\n\n                                                  20\n\fthe witnesses against him.‖                U.S. CONST. amend. VI.               The admission of a testimonial,\n\nout-of-court statement from a declarant who does not appear at trial violates the Confrontation\n\nClause unless the declarant was unavailable to testify at trial and the defendant had a prior\n\nopportunity for cross-examination. Davis v. Washington, 547 U.S. 813, 821 (2006); Crawford v.\n\nWashington, 541 U.S. 36, 68 (2004).\n\n            In this case, the autopsy report was admitted into evidence during the direct examination of\n\nthe medical examiner who performed the autopsy. Because the testifying medical examiner was\n\navailable for cross-examination, there was no Confrontation Clause violation. Melendez-Diaz v.\n\nMassachusetts, 129 S.Ct. 2527, 2531 (2009); Crawford, 541 U.S. at 53–54; see Briggs v. State,\n\n789 S.W.2d 918 (Tex. Crim. App. 1990). Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in\n\nadmitting the autopsy report.\n\n(4)         Excluding Evidence of Smith’s Mental-Health History from the Guilt/Innocence Phase\n            Was Not Error\n\n            During Altamirano‘s cross-examination, Smith attempted to offer emergency room\n\nmedical records indicating she was suffering from ―depression thoughts of suicide‖ in July 2007.\n\nThe medical records referred to a previous suicide attempt, ingestion of Valium, and references\n\nthat Smith had not been taking her anxiety and depression medication. Smith argues that\n\nexclusion of this evidence, relevant to her capacity to formulate the requisite mens rea, was an\n\nabuse of the trial court‘s discretion.6 See Walters v. State, 247 S.W.3d 204, 217 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n6\n    In support of her position, Smith cites the Court to cases discussing the affirmative defense of insanity.\n\n                                                             21\n\f2007).\n\n         Texas does not recognize diminished capacity as an affirmative defense. Ruffin v. State,\n\n270 S.W.3d 586, 593 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008); Jackson v. State, 160 S.W.3d 568, 573 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 2005); see Rhoten v. State, 299 S.W.3d 349 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2009, no pet.). Rather,\n\nit is a ―failure-of-proof defense in which the defendant claims that the State failed to prove that the\n\ndefendant had the required state of mind at the time of the offense.‖ Jackson, 160 S.W.3d at\n\n573–74; Ruffin, 270 S.W.3d at 593.7           To be admissible in tending to disprove state of mind, the\n\nevidence in this case must have shown that Smith, due to her mental condition, was either unable\n\nto form a conscious objective or desire or to engage in conduct causing River Phoenix‘s death, or\n\ncould not be aware her actions were reasonably certain to cause River Phoenix‘s death. See\n\nJackson, 160 S.W.3d at 574; Thomas v. State, 886 S.W.2d 388, 391 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st\n\nDist.] 1994, writ ref‘d).\n\n         The trial court expressed ―there is no direct evidence that‘s been presented to suggest that\n\nthe hospitalization on I believe July 11, 2007 has any relevance as to her state of mind because\n\nthere‘s no direct evidence that she did not have . . . the requisite state of mind to form intent to\n\ncommit the offense in question.‖ The court determined that, without such a showing, this\n\nevidence could only be considered in mitigation.\n\n\n\n7\n A trial judge has discretion to determine whether evidence regarding state of mind would support a lesser-included\noffense, and the evidence can be presented during punishment in order to reduce the sentence assessed by the jury.\nJackson, 160 S.W.3d at 574.\n\n                                                        22\n\f         As further support, Smith cited Article 38.36(a) of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure,\n\nwhich provides:\n\n         In all prosecutions for murder, the state or the defendant shall be permitted to offer\n         testimony as to all relevant facts and circumstances surrounding the killing and the\n         previous relationship existing between the accused and the deceased, together with\n         all relevant facts and circumstances going to show the condition of the mind of the\n         accused at the time of the offense.\n\nTEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. art. 38.36(a) (Vernon 2005). Smith‘s medical records indicate that\n\nher treatment plan included medications to treat anxiety and depression and that she was\n\ndischarged after an appointment was set up for her at a local behavior treatment facility.8 There\n\nwas no evidence presented that Smith was not taking her medication and following her treatment\n\nplan at the time of the offense. As the court pointed out, the record does not demonstrate that\n\nSmith‘s state of mind during the July incident, which occurred while she was off of her prescribed\n\nmedication, was her state of mind at the time of the offense in September.\n\n         Because Smith did not present any evidence that she was unable to form the requisite intent\n\ndue to her depression and thoughts of suicide, the medical records were not admissible as tending\n\n\n8\n The additional 1,560 pages of medical records spanning several years, which Smith sought to introduce, covered\nmostly irrelevant checkups and hospital appointments, including physical diagnoses of tuberculosis, scoliosis, and\nresulting surgeries and back pain. Smith also sought to introduce Illinois Children and Family Services Department\nrecords, which may have provided insight into her home life as a child. We assume these records were introduced\nbecause some make references to a past medical history of depression and anxiety. However, a majority are simply\nirrelevant. Trial counsel did not point to the page numbers which supported his position that the records should be\nintroduced, either to the trial court or in his brief. A trial court need not sort through challenged evidence in order to\nsegregate admissible evidence from excludable evidence. Jones v. State, 843 S.W.2d 487, 492 (Tex. Crim. App.\n1992); see In re S.M., 207 S.W.3d 421, 424 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2006, pet. denied) (error not preserved where trial\ncourt required to sort through admissible and inadmissible evidence). In any event, there were no medical records\nprovided for our review after July 2007.\n\n                                                           23\n\fto disprove her state of mind. See Jackson, 160 S.W.3d at 574; Thomas, 886 S.W.2d at 391.\n\nThus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in failing to admit the records during the\n\nguilt/innocence phase.\n\n(5)    Admitting Evidence of Smith’s Prior Behavior and Attitude Toward River Phoenix Was\n       Not Error\n\n       Smith complains that introduction of Wade‘s and Roberson‘s testimony regarding Smith‘s\n\ndemeanor toward River Phoenix amounted to impermissible extraneous-offense evidence. She\n\nargues that the trial court erred in allowing the testimony over her Texas Rules of Evidence 401,\n\n403, and 404 objections.\n\n       A trial court‘s ruling on the admissibility of extraneous offenses is reviewed under an\n\nabuse of discretion standard. Prible v. State, 175 S.W.3d 724, 731 (Tex. Crim. App. 2005). The\n\ninteraction between several statutes governs the analysis in this case. First, if evidence is not\n\nrelevant to a fact of consequence in the case, it may not be admitted. TEX. R. EVID. 401. ―In all\n\nprosecutions for murder, the state . . . shall be permitted to offer testimony as to all relevant facts\n\nand circumstances surrounding . . . the previous relationship existing between the accused and the\n\ndeceased.‖ TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. art. 38.36(a). This article is read in conjunction with\n\nRule 404(b). Smith v. State, 5 S.W.3d 673, 677–78 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999). While evidence of\n\nother crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible ―to prove the character of a person in order to show\n\naction in conformity therewith,‖ they may ―be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of\n\nmotive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or\n\n\n                                                  24\n\faccident.‖ TEX. R. EVID. 404(b). ―Rule 404(b) is a rule of inclusion rather than exclusion.‖\n\nDe La Paz v. State, 279 S.W.3d 336, 343 (Tex. Crim. App. 2009). ―[I]f evidence (1) is introduced\n\nfor a purpose other than character conformity; (2) has relevance to a ‗fact of consequence‘ in the\n\ncase, and; (3) remains free of any other constitutional or statutory prohibitions, it is admissible.‖\n\nSegundo v. State, 270 S.W.3d 79, 88 n.19 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008) (quoting Rankin v. State, 974\n\nS.W.2d 707, 709 (Tex. Crim. App. 1996)). If evidence is admissible under the above rules, it may\n\nstill be excluded under Rule 403 if the probative value of the evidence is substantially outweighed\n\nby unfair prejudice. TEX. R. EVID. 403. Whether extraneous-offense evidence has relevance\n\napart from character conformity, as required by Rule 404(b), is a question for the trial court.\n\nMoses v. State, 105 S.W.3d 622, 627 (Tex. Crim. App. 2003).\n\n       Here, Smith‘s intent is a fact of consequence in this case. Wade‘s and Roberson‘s\n\ntestimony regarding Smith‘s previous actions are facts that have a tendency to make probable the\n\nState‘s theory that Smith possessed the requisite intent at the time of the offense. Also, in a\n\nmurder case, the relationship between an accused and the victim is ―itself a material issue.‖\n\nGarcia v. State, 201 S.W.3d 695, 703 (Tex. Crim. App. 2006). The evidence was admissible\n\nunder Rule 401. Next, evidence of Smith‘s prior assault and interactions with River Phoenix are\n\nalso admissible as a demonstration of their relationship under Article 38.36. Id. at 704; Baker v.\n\nState, 368 S.W.2d 627, 632 (Tex. Crim. App. 1963) (finding prior assault on deceased six years\n\nago not too remote, thus admissible under prior version of Article 38.36).\n\n\n\n                                                 25\n\f       Although Wade and Roberson testified about prior bad acts, the State argued their\n\ntestimony was being offered only to demonstrate intent and absence of mistake or accident, and the\n\ntrial court issued a limiting instruction to the jury to that effect. Specifically, the trial court\n\ninstructed the jury it could not consider the testimony ―to prove the character of the Defendant in\n\norder to show that she acted in conformity therewith on the occasion in question.‖ ―Evidence of\n\nprior extraneous offenses committed by the accused against the victim of the offense charged that\n\nshow ill will or hostility toward the victim ‗is admissible as part of the State‘s case in chief as\n\ncircumstantial evidence of the existence of a motive for committing the offense charged.‘‖ Page\n\nv. State, 819 S.W.2d 883, 887 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1991, pet. ref‘d) (quoting Foy v.\n\nState, 593 S.W.2d 707, 709 (Tex. Crim. App. [Panel Op.] 1980)); see Bush v. State, 958 S.W.2d\n\n503, 505–06 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 1997, no pet.) (prior instances of violence toward murder\n\nvictim admissible). Thus, although extraneous, the evidence was admissible under the exceptions\n\nlisted under Rule 404(b). Garcia, 201 S.W.3d at 704 (evidence of prior bad act against victim ―is\n\nadmissible under Rule 404(b) for the purpose of illustrating the nature of‖ the relationship between\n\naccused and victim).\n\n       Because Wade‘s and Roberson‘s testimony was introduced for a purpose other than\n\ncharacter conformity, had relevance to intent, absence of mistake, and the nature of the\n\nrelationship between Smith and River Phoenix, and remained free of any other constitutional or\n\nstatutory prohibitions, it was admissible. Rankin, 974 S.W.2d at 709. Thus, we move to the\n\n\n\n                                                26\n\fquestion of whether the probative value of their testimony was substantially outweighed by unfair\n\nprejudice. TEX. R. EVID. 403; Garcia, 201 S.W.3d at 704. It is Smith‘s burden to establish\n\nexclusion under this rule. Montgomery, 810 S.W.2d at 389.\n\n       The first factor we analyze in determining whether the prejudice of an extraneous offense\n\nsubstantially outweighs its probative value is ―how compellingly the extraneous offense evidence\n\nserves to make a fact of consequence more or less probable—a factor which is related to the\n\nstrength of the evidence presented by the proponent to show the defendant in fact committed the\n\nextraneous offense.‖ Santellan v. State, 939 S.W.2d 155, 169 (Tex. Crim. App. 1997) (citing\n\nMontgomery, 810 S.W.2d at 389–90). As discussed above, Wade‘s and Roberson‘s statements\n\ncompellingly made the allegation that Smith possessed the requisite murderous intent more\n\nprobable. This factor favors admission of their testimony.\n\n       The second factor concerns the potential the other offense evidence has to impress the jury\n\n―in some irrational but nevertheless indelible way.‖       Santellan, 939 S.W.2d at 169 (citing\n\nMontgomery, 810 S.W.2d at 389–90). There is nothing in the record to indicate Smith‘s prior bad\n\nacts would ―lure the factfinder into declaring guilt on a ground different from proof specific to the\n\noffense charged‖ in this murder case, especially given the trial court‘s lengthy Rule 403 limiting\n\ninstruction. Old Chief v. United States, 519 U.S. 172, 180 (1997). This factor also favors\n\nadmission.\n\n       The third factor looks to ―the time the proponent will need to develop the evidence, during\n\n\n\n                                                 27\n\fwhich the jury will be distracted from consideration of the indicted offense.‖ Santellan, 939\n\nS.W.2d at 169 (citing Montgomery, 810 S.W.2d at 389–90). The State presented a total of eleven\n\nwitnesses. Wade‘s and Roberson‘s testimony regarding the extraneous acts comprised a small\n\nportion of the record. Therefore, we conclude this factor also weighed in favor of admitting their\n\ntestimony.\n\n       The last factor involves the ―force of the proponent‘s need for this evidence to prove a fact\n\nof consequence, i.e., does the proponent have other probative evidence available to him to help\n\nestablish this fact, and is this fact related to an issue in dispute.‖ The State‘s need for Wade‘s and\n\nRoberson‘s testimony was required to rebut the defensive theory that only Dewitt was responsible\n\nfor River Phoenix‘s death.     Although Dewitt and K.T. testified to actions conducted by Smith\n\nleading up to River Phoenix‘s death, the jury may have decided Dewitt‘s testimony was less\n\ncredible due to a deal with prosecutors that he would not receive the death penalty if he testified\n\nagainst Smith. The jury could also believe that K.T.‘s testimony was biased toward her father,\n\nespecially since she did not witness the beatings which occurred on the day before River Phoenix‘s\n\ndeath, either because she was in school or because the beatings occurred after her bedtime.\n\nMoreover, testimony of witnesses outside of the home could lend more credibility to Dewitt‘s and\n\nK.T.‘s testimony. Thus, we find that the final factor also weighs in favor of admission and that\n\nthe trial court did not err in concluding the probative value of Wade‘s and Roberson‘s testimony\n\nwas not substantially outweighed by unfair prejudice.\n\n\n\n                                                 28\n\f       Finding no error in admission of Wade‘s and Roberson‘s testimony to demonstrate Smith‘s\n\nrelationship with River Phoenix and intent to cause her death, we overrule this point of error.\n\n       We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     Josh R.

Two attackers\n\nrepeatedly assaulted the much smaller and weaker victim, sometimes kicking her, sometimes\n\nslamming her into the wall, sometimes striking her with belts. They made her stand barefooted\n\nand motionless for hours at a time, sometimes atop an overturned plastic milk crate cast using a\n\nlarge open grid pattern, which caused her additional pain. When she faltered, she was further\n\nassaulted. As if the victim had not suffered enough, on the final day of the attacks, her female\n\nattacker repeatedly pushed the exhausted victim backward onto the floor. Each fall caused the\n\nvictim‘s head to hit the floor; the last time hard enough so a witness heard the victim‘s ―brain\n\ncrack.‖ The victim, River Phoenix Williams, died from her injuries.\n\n        River Phoenix was two years old. The attackers were her father and the father‘s live-in\n\ngirlfriend.\n\n        Just as River Phoenix had been entitled to the protections of the law, her attackers, too, are\n\nentitled to all applicable protective provisions of the law.\n\n        Latoya Smith, the live-in girlfriend, was convicted in River Phoenix‘s death, after River\n\nPhoenix‘s father, Neil Patrick Dewitt, had pled guilty to the same crime.\n\n        Sentenced to life imprisonment without parole, Smith appeals, urging a number of\n\narguments but making no challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to prove the offense of\n\n\n\n                                                  2\n\fcapital murder. We affirm the trial court‘s judgment because (1) the State‘s nondisclosure of\n\ncertain evidence did not require an in camera inspection of the State‘s file or a mistrial, (2) no\n\nConfrontation Clause violation arose from the trial court‘s rulings regarding the testimony of\n\nWade and Roberson, (3) admitting River Phoenix‘s autopsy report did not violate the\n\nConfrontation Clause, (4) excluding evidence of Smith‘s mental health history during the\n\nguilt/innocence phase was not error, and (5) admitting evidence of Smith‘s prior behavior and\n\nattitude toward River Phoenix was not error. We address the arguments in that order, after\n\nrecounting the facts in greater detail.\n\n       Before her death, River Phoenix lived with Dewitt, Smith, and River Phoenix‘s minor\n\nsister, K.T. Dewitt admitted that he was party to the abuse that caused his child‘s death, pled\n\nguilty to capital murder, and also received a sentence of life imprisonment without parole. He\n\ntestified against Smith during her trial, consistently said that the two of them killed River Phoenix,\n\nand enlightened the jury on the origins of Smith‘s jealousy, dislike, and abuse of River Phoenix,\n\nwho was Dewitt‘s daughter by another woman. Dewitt stated, ―When I found out that [River\n\nPhoenix] was my child, [Smith] had said, well, there‘s your child you could‘ve had with me.‖\n\nDewitt also testified that Smith would never accept River Phoenix, and felt that Dewitt ―cheated on\n\nher because [River Phoenix] came in after we were together.‖ Smith‘s journal complained that\n\nDewitt told River Phoenix that Smith was picking on her.\n\n       So now whenever I come in the room when she‘s eating she stops eating and\n       watches me like I‘m the TV . . ., so now I don‘t go into any room that she‘s in and I\n\n\n                                                  3\n\f        don‘t say anything to her and I leave her and [Dewitt] alone and they seem to do\n        just fine without me around. Good news, she goes home [to her mother] on the\n        first of the month. The bad news is today is only the 27th of the month. I have\n        never disliked a child so much in my life. I wish she didn‘t exist.\n\nFor this reason, both Dewitt and K.T. testified, Smith had a ―bad‖ relationship with River Phoenix\n\nresulting in child abuse.\n\n        Some of Smith‘s treatment of River Phoenix was described by Kiara Kashawn Wade and\n\nher mother, Evelyn Roberson. Smith, a stay-at-home hair stylist, booked an appointment with\n\nWade for hair braiding. When Wade and Roberson arrived, they noticed that River Phoenix was\n\nleft in the back yard alone. Wade testified:\n\n        When [Smith] started to braid my hair, [River Phoenix] was standing next to us,\n        and [Smith] didn‘t like that. She said, go play with the toys or go play with the\n        dog. And [River Phoenix] didn‘t move, she just stood there. And that‘s when\n        [Smith] went on saying, we bought her all these toys and she don‘t play with them,\n        and she ended up siccing the dog on the baby, making the baby cry . . . . [Smith] was\n        just putting the dog on the baby.\n\nWade asked Smith to stop, to which Smith replied, ―[I]f you don‘t like it, then you can take her\n\nhome with you.‖ Smith then forced River Phoenix to stand in a corner for seven hours. ―After\n\nshe put her in a corner, [River Phoenix] kept crying . . . . But as [Smith] was talking to me . . . . she\n\nwas talking about [River Phoenix‘s] mother, she was throwing stuff at the baby; hairbrushes, she\n\nthrew some grease at her, and she threw a shoe at her.‖ Smith reportedly told Wade that she\n\nhoped Dewitt ―did get custody of the baby, that way she could do what she wanted to with [River\n\nPhoenix].‖ Wade said, ―[Y]ou could tell [River Phoenix] wanted to sit down. You know, a\n\n\n\n                                                   4\n\fbaby‘s legs . . . she was shaking . . . . She had been standing for almost six hours now.‖ At one\n\npoint, Smith checked River Phoenix‘s diaper, found it dirty, told her she stank, ―smashed‖ the\n\ndiaper against her, and ―made her sit in it.‖ Smith refused Wade‘s offer of help to change the\n\ndiaper. When Wade offered River Phoenix food, Smith ―knocked it out of [her] hand‖ and\n\noffered River Phoenix the food herself. When River Phoenix backed away, Smith said that she\n\nhad ―a nasty attitude towards the people that take care of her, but with everybody else that she\n\ndon‘t know she‘s very friendly.‖ Toward the end of the evening, Dewitt arrived and was\n\ninstructed not to feed River Phoenix ―anything because all the food in the house belonged to\n\n[Smith].‖ The couple joked and ―said they treat the dog better than they treat [River Phoenix]\n\nbecause her attitude is so messed up.‖ A distraught Wade returned to Roberson‘s house and\n\nreported the day‘s events. Roberson attempted an intervention with Dewitt and Smith, which\n\nresulted in Smith cursing the child and blaming her for her stubbornness. The couple told\n\nRoberson that River Phoenix ―was the problem.‖\n\n       The problems continued. The day before River Phoenix‘s death, she ―was in her chair and\n\ndidn‘t want to eat.‖ Smith became upset, yelled at the child, took her from the dinner table, and\n\ngave her a bath instead. Then, River Phoenix was instructed to dress herself. When the\n\ntwo-year-old was unsuccessful at this task, Smith spanked the child with a red leather belt that had\n\na brass buckle, a weapon used regularly by Smith to beat the child. Smith ―had beat her for a\n\nwhile, and then she got increasingly frustrated and passed her to‖ Dewitt, who beat her with a\n\n\n\n                                                 5\n\fblack leather belt. At one point, Dewitt ―hit her once over the top of the head with the belt.‖\n\nDewitt justified his actions by claiming to be supportive of Smith‘s theory that River Phoenix was\n\ncoddled.\n\n       The couple passed the baby back and forth between themselves for continued beatings over\n\nthe course of several hours. The whippings ended after Smith grabbed the child by her arms,\n\n―rammed her into the wall,‖ ―dropped kicked her out of the way,‖ and walked away from her. As\n\nif the child had not suffered enough, she was later made to stand, without shoes, on a plastic crate\n\ncast with a large grid pattern in its plastic body. After Dewitt nudged her with his foot, River\n\nPhoenix fell from the crate, hit her head on a nearby nightstand, climbed back up, and continued to\n\nstand throughout the night.\n\n       The next morning, Dewitt left for work, and K.T. boarded her school bus. Dewitt had\n\nbeen ―cheating on‖ Smith with another woman whom he met on the Yahoo Singles dating website.\n\nSmith discovered the website and called Dewitt at work to inquire about the other woman. He\n\nreceived angry telephone calls all day culminating in threats against River Phoenix‘s life,\n\nincluding one instructing Dewitt ―to be careful when I pulled into the garage because [River\n\nPhoenix] would be lying there dead.‖ Dewitt did not rush home.\n\n       Around 1:00 p.m., Karrie Sue McNeil arrived to clean the apartment next door. She\n\nnoticed the unmistakable sound, coming from the Dewitt-Smith residence, of a baby crying and\n\nscreaming in pain. The child continued to cry and scream for the entire hour and a half it took\n\n\n\n                                                 6\n\fMcNeil to finish her job. While she contemplated reporting her suspicions, McNeil did not act on\n\nthat idea.\n\n          K.T. testified that she returned from school that day to find River Phoenix ―standing in the\n\ncorner hunched over, and her knees—her legs were swelled up and she had bags under her eyes.‖\n\nSmith sat on the couch and would hit River Phoenix ―with the belt on her legs‖ when the baby\n\nwould fall down from standing. K.T. was forbidden to intervene. When Smith had her fill of\n\nthis torture, K.T. was allowed to bathe River Phoenix. K.T. observed ―[s]he had whip marks on\n\nher legs and on her back‖ and ―nail marks on the back of her ear[s].‖ After the bath, K.T. took her\n\nbaby sister to the living room where Smith was watching television. Smith ―kneeled down in\n\nfront of‖ the baby, and ―pushed her down.‖ River Phoenix fell backward, hit her head on the\n\nfloor, and began to cry. When she stumbled up to a standing position, Smith twice repeated this\n\naction. As a result of the third push to the ground, K.T. heard River Phoenix‘s ―brain crack.‖\n\nRiver Phoenix ―laid there looking at the ceiling,‖ and ―was wobbling‖ after she managed to stand\n\nup again. K.T. could tell her sister was badly injured. She next witnessed Smith call Dewitt and\n\ntell him ―[s]he was going to hang [River Phoenix] with her red belt.‖ At 9:00 p.m., K.T. was sent\n\nto bed.\n\n          Dewitt finally arrived around 9:30 p.m. to find River Phoenix ―in a full-blown seizure‖\n\nwhile Smith sat apathetically on the couch watching television. Dewitt made the decision not to\n\nseek emergency medical care after observing the extensive bruising on River Phoenix‘s body. He\n\n\n\n                                                   7\n\ftestified Smith sat on the couch ―and kept rocking backing [sic] and forth, and she was like, I‘m\n\ngoing to jail, I‘m going to jail, I‘m going to jail.‖ River Phoenix suffered a second seizure. After\n\nputting River Phoenix in K.T.‘s bedroom, Dewitt ate dinner and went to bed, while Smith stayed\n\nawake pacing the hall.\n\n       K.T. checked on her sister the next morning. ―Her breathing was slowing down and her\n\nheart was slowing down.‖ She informed her father, but went to school after his assurance that\n\nRiver Phoenix would be fine.\n\n       Shortly thereafter, River Phoenix died.\n\n       The couple ―talked about blaming it on [K.T.] and saying that [K.T.] had kept hitting her,\n\nand that [Dewitt] would drive and dispose of the belts.‖ While Dewitt was disposing of evidence,\n\nSmith called the police.\n\n       Officer Latriesha Grandy spoke with Smith, who ―didn‘t show any concern for River\n\nPhoenix or her well-being or the kind of shape she was in. It seems that her goal was to make sure\n\nshe‖ blamed K.T. for River Phoenix‘s injuries. After speaking with Detective Gisela Altamirano,\n\nhowever, Smith began to blame Dewitt, and then the family dog, for River Phoenix‘s condition.\n\nGrandy found River Phoenix nonresponsive with ―bruises all over her body‖ consistent with\n\nphysical abuse to her forehead, abdomen, arms, legs, and ears. LifeNet responder James Pappas\n\ntestified ―[t]here were various bruises of different sizes, shapes, locations, everywhere. The best\n\nway to describe it you couldn‘t take your hand and place it anywhere on that child that your hand\n\n\n\n                                                 8\n\fwould not touch a bruise or more than one bruise.‖\n\n           Dewitt and Smith followed River Phoenix to the hospital. Doctors informed Altamirano\n\nthey believed the child had undergone severe physical abuse. The couple was arrested, and Smith\n\ngave inconsistent recorded statements to police about the causes of River Phoenix‘s bruising and\n\nher death. River Phoenix‘s autopsy report confirmed ―extensive blunt force trauma, abrasions,\n\nlacerations, and contusions over much of the body surface, including the head, the trunk, and all\n\nfour extremities, widely scattered throughout the body,‖ with the cause of death being blunt head\n\ntrauma.\n\n(1)        The State’s Nondisclosure of Certain Evidence Did Not Require an in Camera Inspection\n           of the State’s File or a Mistrial\n\n           Smith contends that she made a plausible showing entitling her to an in camera inspection\n\nof the State‘s files by arguing the State violated the Brady1 rule in failing to disclose Dewitt‘s\n\nstatements made to Justice of the Peace Nancy Talley, his handwritten notes, and a DNA test\n\nresult.

Immediately after\n\nTalley was excused, Smith raised the issue of a Brady violation and argued Talley‘s testimony was\n\nexculpatory because Dewitt never indicated to Talley that Smith had any responsibility for River\n\nPhoenix‘s death. The State responded that there were no written documents supporting Talley‘s\n\ntestimony and alleged that Smith was in the room while Dewitt made the statements.\n\n        In ruling that failing to disclose Talley‘s testimony did not violate Brady, the trial court\n\nfound Smith‘s counsel had discovered the substance of her testimony in sufficient time to prepare\n\nfor trial. This was demonstrated by the subpoena, directing Talley to appear and testify, issued at\n\nSmith‘s request made seven days before trial. The trial court also found that Talley‘s testimony\n\nwas not material.\n\n        It is well settled that the government has the obligation to turn over evidence in its\n\npossession that is both favorable to the accused and material to guilt or punishment. Ritchie, 480\n\nU.S. at 57 (citing Brady, 373 U.S. at 87).

It\n\napparently so believed, since it ruled that there was no Brady violation with regard to Talley‘s\n\ntestimony.\n\n\n\n\n         (B)      The Trial Court Never Ruled on Whether the State’s Failure to Timely Disclose\n                  Dewitt’s Handwritten Notes Violated Brady\n\n         During Dewitt‘s testimony at trial, Smith‘s attorney noticed Dewitt was holding\n\nhandwritten notes, which reportedly were Dewitt‘s personal notes made shortly before trial. The\n\nState claimed it had received a copy of the notes the week before trial. The notes were made by\n\nDewitt, contained a time line of events, the majority of the substance of Dewitt‘s testimony, and\n\nthe following statements, among others, which could be viewed as exculpatory or impeachment\n\nevidence:4\n\n         I had punched her and she fell on the floor backwards . . . .

He also argued that failure to disclose the notes should be considered in\n\ndetermining whether the court should grant the in camera inspection. The State responded that,\n\nalthough the time line was received by the prosecutor‘s office, they were ―never part of the file.‖\n\nNoting that it had previously ordered the State to disclose such information, the trial court arranged\n\nto have copies of the notes made, allowed the State to conclude its direct examination, and\n\ndeclared an overnight recess to give Smith‘s attorney ―an opportunity to use it to prepare\n\ncross-examination of Mr. Dewitt.‖ The motion for mistrial was denied.\n\n       The following morning, Smith‘s counsel moved for a seven-day continuance and\n\ncomplained that the notes ―completely eviscerated my defense.‖ Although the trial court decided\n\nthe State suppressed favorable evidence in spite of a proper request by the defense, it found that the\n\nmateriality of the notes had not yet been established and indicated it would carry the objection until\n\nthe end of cross-examination.\n\n       For a complaint for appellate review to be preserved, the trial court must have ―ruled on the\n\n\n\n                                                  14\n\frequest, objection, or motion, either expressly or implicitly,‖ or must have ―refused to rule on the\n\nrequest‖ despite objection to the refusal to rule. TEX. R. APP. P. 33.1. Here, the record reveals\n\nthat the trial court never ruled on the issue of whether the handwritten notes violated Brady. This\n\nwas acknowledged by Smith in her brief.\n\n       (C)     No Ruling Was Requested Regarding the Negative DNA Test Results\n\n       During a search of Smith‘s residence, officers located a broken broom. A test indicated\n\nthere was blood on the broom, but a subsequent DNA test excluded River Phoenix as the source of\n\nthe blood. Smith was provided a copy of the DNA results, and she introduced a copy of those\n\nresults at trial. While complaining of untimely disclosure of the DNA results, Smith does not\n\nraise the issue of whether a Brady violation occurred with respect to the DNA test results. Since\n\nthe State did disclose the test results, and no objection to the results was made, the trial court was\n\nfree to determine that Smith‘s argument, raised during her motion for in camera inspection after\n\nintroduction of the DNA test results, provided no plausible basis that the State‘s files would\n\ncontain further undisclosed, material evidence.\n\n       In sum, the trial court concluded that it ―has no duty to do an in camera investigation,‖\n\nbecause no Brady violation occurred. Without a plausible showing that the State‘s file contained\n\nundisclosed material evidence, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in\n\nfailing to grant Smith‘s motion for an in camera inspection.\n\n       (D)     Mistrial Was Not Required in any Case\n\n\n\n                                                  15\n\f        ―Only in extreme circumstances, where the prejudice is incurable, will a mistrial be\n\nrequired.‖ Archie v.

We disagree.\n\n        (A)    Wade’s Testimony Was Not Limited by the Trial Court\n\n        During Wade‘s cross-examination, the following exchange occurred:\n\n               Q.      Now, your mother is Evelyn Roberson?\n\n               A.      Yes . . . .\n\n\n                                                16\n\f               Q.

And he‘s a member of Hell‘s Lovers?\n\n                      Mr. Shepherd: Your Honor, the State is going to object once again\n       to the relevance of that.\n\n                       THE COURT: Well, I‘ll allow that question.\n\n               Q.      [Mr. Henry] He‘s a member of the Hell‘s Lovers?\n\n               A.      Yes, sir.\n\n               Q.      And your mother, is she property of the Hell‘s Lovers?\n\n                       Mr. Shepherd: Once again, Judge, this is not relevant to the issue\n       before this jury.\n\n                      THE COURT: Well, the Court will sustain that, also the\n       characterization.\n\n               A.

Oh, okay.\n\n                       [Defense Counsel]: Pass the witness, Your Honor.\n\n                       Mr. Shepherd: Nothing further.\n\n                       THE COURT: All right, you can step down.\n\nIn her brief, Smith complains that the trial court did not allow her to establish that Wade‘s mother\n\n\n\n                                                   17\n\fwas ―property‖ of the Hell‘s Lovers biker gang. Review of the record demonstrates that Wade\n\nprovided the answer counsel sought, the answer was not struck, Smith‘s counsel passed the\n\nwitness, and Smith did not attempt (and, thus, the trial court did not limit) further\n\ncross-examination.5\n\n        (B)      Limiting Roberson’s Testimony Was Within the Trial Court’s Discretion, Based on\n                 Its Lack of Relevance and the Failure to Show Roberson’s Bias Against Smith\n\n        The right to cross-examination extends to any matter that could reflect on the witness‘\n\ncredibility.

This inquiry depends on the facts of each case.\n\nId. at 904.\n\n        During Roberson‘s cross-examination, Smith requested the trial court‘s permission to\n\ninquire about her participation in Hell‘s Lovers. Smith argued the evidence was relevant for the\n\npurpose of demonstrating bias toward Dewitt. ―[T]he right to cross-examination includes the\n\nopportunity to show that a witness is biased, or that the testimony is exaggerated or unbelievable.‖\n\nRitchie, 480 U.S. at 51–52. However, the court reminded counsel that Roberson testified against\n\nboth Dewitt and Smith. It stated, ―Well, I think that you can go into the fact that her husband and\n\nDewitt are friends. I think that you can go into the fact—you can ask whether or not due to that\n\nfriendship would she have a tendency to testify as to—based on that relationship.‖\n\n        A proffer outside the jury‘s presence produced the following testimony:\n\n              Q.      And Mr. Nathaniel Roberson is a member of the Hell‘s Lovers\n        motorcycle gang?\n\n               A.       That is not correct. He‘s a member of the Hell‘s Lovers motorcycle\n        club.

It‘s an organization. They ride motorcycles, and they‘re located in\n       a lot of different states . . . .\n\n              Q.     . . . were you property of the Hell‘s Lovers motorcycle\n       organization?\n\n               A.

There is nothing in the record to indicate Smith‘s prior bad\n\nacts would ―lure the factfinder into declaring guilt on a ground different from proof specific to the\n\noffense charged‖ in this murder case, especially given the trial court‘s lengthy Rule 403 limiting\n\ninstruction.

This factor also favors\n\nadmission.\n\n       The third factor looks to ―the time the proponent will need to develop the evidence, during\n\n\n\n                                                 27\n\fwhich the jury will be distracted from consideration of the indicted offense.‖ Santellan, 939\n\nS.W.2d at 169 (citing Montgomery, 810 S.W.2d at 389–90). The State presented a total of eleven\n\nwitnesses. Wade‘s and Roberson‘s testimony regarding the extraneous acts comprised a small\n\nportion of the record. Therefore, we conclude this factor also weighed in favor of admitting their\n\ntestimony.\n\n       The last factor involves the ―force of the proponent‘s need for this evidence to prove a fact\n\nof consequence, i.e., does the proponent have other probative evidence available to him to help\n\nestablish this fact, and is this fact related to an issue in dispute.‖ The State‘s need for Wade‘s and\n\nRoberson‘s testimony was required to rebut the defensive theory that only Dewitt was responsible\n\nfor River Phoenix‘s death.     Although Dewitt and K.T. testified to actions conducted by Smith\n\nleading up to River Phoenix‘s death, the jury may have decided Dewitt‘s testimony was less\n\ncredible due to a deal with prosecutors that he would not receive the death penalty if he testified\n\nagainst Smith. The jury could also believe that K.T.‘s testimony was biased toward her father,\n\nespecially since she did not witness the beatings which occurred on the day before River Phoenix‘s\n\ndeath, either because she was in school or because the beatings occurred after her bedtime.\n\nMoreover, testimony of witnesses outside of the home could lend more credibility to Dewitt‘s and\n\nK.T.‘s testimony. Thus, we find that the final factor also weighs in favor of admission and that\n\nthe trial court did not err in concluding the probative value of Wade‘s and Roberson‘s testimony\n\nwas not substantially outweighed by unfair prejudice.\n\n\n\n                                                 28\n\f       Finding no error in admission of Wade‘s and Roberson‘s testimony to demonstrate Smith‘s\n\nrelationship with River Phoenix and intent to cause her death, we overrule this point of error.\n\n       We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     Josh R.
