On November 24, 1988, Knoop was arrested for assaulting his estranged wife and her friend at his wife's home.  Knoop was initially charged with first-degree burglary and was admitted into the general jail population at the Henry County Jail.

Following that incident, Sheriff Morrow routinely placed those inmates charged with violent crimes in administrative segregation.  In accordance with this policy, the appellants segregated Knoop from the general jail population after he was charged with attempted murder.  Except for the fact that he could not interact with the other prisoners, the conditions of Knoop's confinement did not change after he was segregated.  Knoop remained in segregation until he was released from prison in May 1989.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Knoop claims that he was denied due process when he was transferred from the general jail population to a single cell without notice or hearing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  It is well established that a hearing is required before an inmate may be \"deprived of privileges or placed in a special confinement status in order to punish him for past misconduct ....\"   Jones v.

He argues instead that the Henry County segregation policy and the corresponding provision of the Iowa Administrative Code create a liberty interest in remaining in the general prison population.   See Clark v. Brewer, 776 F.2d 226, 230 (8th Cir.  1985);   Hewitt v.

A hearing would have served no purpose in this case;  it is undisputed that Knoop was charged with attempted murder and thus fell within the class of prisoners covered by the Henry County segregation policy.
