GARY THOMAS LAMB\n\n                 Appeal from the Circuit Court for Franklin County\n                  No. 18018CV        Thomas W. Graham, Judge\n                     ___________________________________\n\n                           No. M2015-01391-COA-R3-CV\n                       ___________________________________\n\n\nThis appeal involves the financial aspects of a divorce, which ended a twelve-year\nmarriage. The trial court granted both parties a divorce, divided the marital estate, and\nawarded Wife rehabilitative alimony for twenty-four months, provided she actively\npursued a teaching degree at Middle Tennessee State University. Wife filed a motion to\nalter or amend the award of alimony to remove the education and vocation requirements.\nThe trial court denied the motion. Wife filed a motion pursuant to Tennessee Rule of\nCivil Procedure 60.02 seeking relief from the trial court‟s order dividing the marital\nestate due to Husband‟s alleged fraudulent withdrawals from the parties‟ marital stock\naccount. The trial court denied the motion. On appeal, Wife takes issue with the\neducational and vocational requirements the trial court placed on the spousal support\naward and with the trial court‟s division of the marital estate. She also appeals the trial\ncourt‟s denial of her Rule 60.02 motion. We affirm the trial court‟s judgment in all\nrespects.\n\n  Tenn. R. App. P. 3 Appeal as of Right; Judgment of the Circuit Court Affirmed\n\nANDY D. BENNETT, J., delivered the opinion of the court, in which FRANK G. CLEMENT,\nJR., P.J., M.S., and W. NEAL MCBRAYER, J., joined.\n\nCynthia A. Cheatham, Manchester, Tennessee, for the appellant, Jamie Treadwell.\n\nWilliam A. Lockhart, Tullahoma, Tennessee, for the appellee, Gary Thomas Lamb.\n\f                                                  OPINION\n\n                              FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n      Jamie Treadwell Lamb (“Wife”) and Gary Thomas Lamb (“Husband”) married on\nSeptember 12, 1998. One child was born of the marriage.1\n\n       Husband had a bachelor‟s degree in computer science and worked as a software\nengineer throughout the marriage. Wife had two years of college in pursuit of an\neducation degree. During the early years of the marriage, Wife first worked for a medical\nequipment company and then worked in real estate after obtaining her real estate license.\nShe eventually stopped working when the parties‟ son was born in December 2000. The\ncouple acquired several real properties and operated an antique store during the course of\nthe marriage. Husband acquired substantial assets in employer-related investment\naccounts.\n\n        Husband filed for divorce on September 17, 2010, alleging inappropriate marital\nconduct and irreconcilable differences. Wife filed an answer followed by an amended\nanswer and counter-complaint for divorce on the same grounds as those alleged by\nHusband. Wife sought alimony, attorney‟s fees, and an equitable division of the marital\nestate.\n\n       The trial court heard the case on March 4 and March 11, 2013. The parties were\nunable to agree on the classification of their assets. Their disagreements primarily\ncentered on three real properties located in Decherd, Tennessee: (1) 510 Spring Street,\n(2) 403 Bennett Street, and (3) 508 Spring Street. Each will be discussed further in the\nanalysis section of this opinion. The trial court entered a final decree of divorce and\npermanent parenting plan on December 3, 2010. An amended final decree of divorce was\nentered on December 10, 2010. In the amended final decree, the trial court awarded a\ndivorce to both parties, established custody, ordered the sale of personal property and real\nproperty, divided the marital estate equally between the parties, and awarded Wife\nspousal support in the amount of $2,444 for twenty-four months, provided she pursued an\neducation degree from Middle Tennessee State University. Additionally, the trial court\nfound three assets to be Husband‟s separate property: (1) Jacobs/Vanguard Investment\nAccount, (2) 510 Spring Street, and (3) 403 Bennett Street.\n\n      Wife filed a motion asking the trial court to alter or amend the alimony award by\nremoving the vocational and educational requirements because she no longer wished to\nbecome a teacher. The trial court denied the motion to alter or amend the alimony award.\nWife then filed a Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure 60.02 motion alleging that Husband\n\n\n1\n    The parties‟ child is still a minor. Custody is not an issue on appeal.\n                                                      -2-\n\ffraudulently removed funds from a marital stock account. The trial court denied the Rule\n60.02 motion, and Wife appealed.\n\n        Wife raises three issues on appeal. First, she contends that the trial court abused\nits discretion by placing educational and vocational conditions on the spousal support\naward. Second, she contends that the trial court erred in classifying certain pieces of real\nproperty as Husband‟s separate property. Lastly, she argues that the trial court erred in\ndenying her Rule 60.02 motion. We shall address each issue in turn.\n\n                                      STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n       We review a trial court‟s findings of fact de novo with a presumption of\ncorrectness unless the evidence preponderates otherwise. TENN. R. APP. P. 13(d); Church\nv. Church, 346 S.W.3d 474, 481 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2010). On the other hand, questions of\nlaw are reviewed de novo and accorded no presumption of correctness. Langschmidt v.\nLangschmidt, 81 S.W.3d 741, 744-45 (Tenn. 2002).\n\n                                             ANALYSIS\n\n                                                 (1)\n\n                                      Spousal Support Award\n\n       A.     Rehabilitative Alimony\n\n        There are no bright-line rules for trial courts to follow when making spousal\nsupport decisions. Owens v. Owens, 241 S.W.3d 478, 493 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2007) (citing\nManis v. Manis, 49 S.W.3d 295, 304 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2001)). “Trial courts have broad\ndiscretion to determine whether spousal support is needed” as well as the nature, amount,\nand duration of the support. Id.; see also Gorman v. Gorman, No. M2010-02620-COA-\nR3-CV, 2011 WL 5599867, at *2 (Tenn. Ct. App. Nov. 16, 2011). A trial court‟s\ndecision to award spousal support is “factually driven and involves the careful balancing\nof many factors.” Gonsewski v. Gonsewski, 350 S.W.3d 99, 105 (Tenn. 2011).\nConsequently, appellate courts generally refuse to second-guess a trial court‟s decision\nunless there has been an abuse of discretion. Id. “An abuse of discretion occurs when\nthe trial court causes an injustice by applying an incorrect legal standard, reaches an\nillogical result, resolves the case on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence, or\nrelies on reasoning that causes an injustice.” Id. (citing Wright ex rel. Wright v. Wright,\n337 S.W.3d 166, 176 (Tenn. 2011)). An appellate court‟s role is not to substitute its\njudgment for that of the trial court, but rather to presume that the trial court‟s decision is\ncorrect and to review the evidence “in the light most favorable to the decision.” Wright,\n337 S.W.3d at 176.\n\n                                            -3-\n\f       Tennessee law recognizes four types of spousal support: 1) alimony in futuro\n(long-term support); 2) transitional alimony; 3) alimony in solido (lump sum alimony);\nand 4) rehabilitative alimony. Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-5-121(d)(1); Gonsewski, 350\nS.W.3d at 107. There is a legislative preference favoring rehabilitative spousal support\nover long-term support. Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-5-121(d)(2); Owens, 241 S.W.3d at 493.\nDespite this legislative preference, long-term or more open-ended support may be\nawarded when warranted by the facts of the case. Riggs v. Riggs, 250 S.W.3d 453, 456\n(Tenn. Ct. App. 2007) (citing Aaron v. Aaron, 909 S.W.2d 408, 410 (Tenn. 1995)). The\npurpose of rehabilitative support is to facilitate the disadvantaged spouse in obtaining\nadditional job skills, education, or training so that he or she will become more self-\nsufficient. Kinard v. Kinard, 986 S.W.2d 220, 234 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1998). By contrast,\nthe purpose of long-term spousal support is to “provide support to a disadvantaged\nspouse who is unable to achieve some degree of self-sufficiency.” Id.\n\n     In determining whether to award spousal support, and in determining the nature,\namount, length of term, and manner of payment, courts consider the following factors:\n\n      (1) The relative earning capacity, obligations, needs, and financial\n      resources of each party, including, income from pension, profit sharing or\n      retirement plans and all other sources;\n\n      (2) The relative education and training of each party, the ability and\n      opportunity of each party to secure such education and training, and the\n      necessity of a party to secure further education and training to improve such\n      party‟s earnings capacity to a reasonable level;\n\n      (3) The duration of the marriage;\n\n      (4) The age and mental condition of each party;\n\n      (5) The physical condition of each party, including, but not limited to,\n      physical disability or incapacity due to a chronic debilitating disease;\n\n      (6) The extent to which it would be undesirable for a party to seek\n      employment outside the home, because such party will be custodian of a\n      minor child of the marriage;\n\n      (7) The separate assets of each party, both real and personal, tangible and\n      intangible;\n\n      (8) The provisions made with regard to the marital property, as defined in\n      § 36-4-121;\n\n                                          -4-\n\f      (9) The standard of living of the parties established during the marriage;\n\n      (10) The extent to which each party has made such tangible and intangible\n      contributions to the marriage as monetary and homemaker contributions,\n      and tangible and intangible contributions by a party to the education,\n      training or increased earning power of the other party;\n\n      (11) The relative fault of the parties, in cases where the court, in its\n      discretion, deems it appropriate to do so; and\n\n      (12) Such other factors, including the tax consequences to each party, as\n      are necessary to consider the equities between the parties.\n\nTenn. Code Ann. § 36-5-121(i). The two most important factors are the disadvantaged\nspouse‟s need and the obligor spouse‟s ability to pay. Robertson v. Robertson, 76\nS.W.3d 337, 342 (Tenn. 2002); Riggs, 250 S.W.3d at 457; Owens, 241 S.W.3d at 494.\n\n        The trial court awarded Wife spousal support in the amended final decree, which\nstated in pertinent part:\n\n      ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the Defendant, Jamie\n      Lamb, receive alimony in the amount of $2,444.00 per month, provided\n      Defendant is actively pursuing and showing proper progress in a Teacher\n      Certification Program at Middle Tennessee State University for a period not\n      to exceed twenty-four (24) months.\n\nAlthough the trial court failed to identify the type of alimony it awarded Wife, we believe\nthe duration of the support, in addition to the educational and vocational requirements,\nindicate an award of rehabilitative alimony. Sommerville v. Sommerville, No. 01A01-\n9502-CV-0007, 1995 WL 498943, at *2 (Tenn. Ct. App. Aug. 23, 1995) (“If the object of\nthe award is to allow a disadvantaged spouse to get back on his or her feet or to acquire\nan education or a skill, the award may be rehabilitative.”).\n\n       A trial court is supposed to make a threshold determination that a spouse is\neconomically disadvantaged in relation to the other spouse, as well as find that\nrehabilitation is possible, before making an award of rehabilitative alimony. Gillespie v.\nGillespie, No. E2006-00734-R3-CV, 2006 WL 3732195, at *3 (Tenn. Ct. App. Dec. 19,\n2006); see Kincaid v. Kincaid, 912 S.W.2d 140, 144 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1995). The trial\ncourt failed to make a factual finding either that Wife was economically disadvantaged\nrelative to Husband or that she could be rehabilitated. Therefore, we must conduct an\nindependent review of the record to determine where the preponderance of the evidence\nlies with regard to this issue. Crabtree v. Crabtree, 16 S.W.3d 356, 360 (Tenn. 2000).\n\n                                           -5-\n\f        Wife was forty-seven years old at the time of trial, and there was no evidence\npresented to indicate she had any health issues. At the time of the marriage, Wife worked\nfor a medical supply company earning $40,000 per year. She later obtained a real estate\nlicense and worked in real estate. However, Wife spent ten years out of the workforce so\nshe could remain at home to raise the parties‟ child and assist in managing their antique\nstore and rental properties. At the time of trial, she worked part-time for a greeting card\nstore earning $300 per month. Wife has two years of college towards an education\ndegree and testified that she anticipated completing her college degree in two years. This\nadditional education can be expected to increase Wife‟s ability to earn more income than\nshe is currently earning. Wife testified that she could earn $40,000 per year as a teacher.\n\n        Husband, who was fifty-two years old at the time of trial, has a college degree and\nworks as a software engineer. Tax returns adduced at trial showed that Husband earned\n$265,000 in 2010, $337,146 in 2011, and $204,541 in 2012. After conducting a thorough\nexamination of the record, we conclude that the evidence preponderates in favor of\nfinding that Wife is economically disadvantaged relative to Husband and that she can be\nrehabilitated. In light of these facts and the relevant factors in Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-5-\n121, we conclude that rehabilitative alimony is appropriate and consistent with the\nlegislative preference to rehabilitate the disadvantaged spouse whenever possible. see\nRobertson, 76 S.W.3d at 339.\n\n       On appeal, Wife contends that the trial court abused its discretion by placing\neducational and vocational conditions on the award of spousal support. We disagree. As\ndiscussed above, trial courts are accorded broad discretion when making spousal support\ndecisions. Gorman, 2011 WL 5599867, at *2; Owens, 241 S.W.3d at 493. The\nTennessee Supreme Court stated in Isbell v. Isbell, 816 S.W.2d 735 (Tenn. 1991),\n“Where rehabilitative support is awarded, it may be made subject to conditions imposed\nby the court or agreed to by the parties.” Isbell, 816 S.W.2d at 739 (footnote omitted).\nAt the time of the Isbell decision, trial courts placed conditions on awards of\nrehabilitative alimony in order to retain control of the award because rehabilitative\nalimony awards were modifiable only if made subject to conditions or if they were not\nfor a sum certain over a set period of time. Id. at 739 n.1. Current Tennessee law,\nhowever, grants trial courts control of an award of rehabilitative alimony for the duration\nof the award. Tenn. Code. Ann. § 36-5-121(e)(2). While the current statute gives trial\ncourts control of rehabilitative alimony awards without requiring the awards be subject to\nconditions, it does not prohibit trial courts from placing conditions on rehabilitative\nalimony awards. Id.\n\n        It is not uncommon for a court to place conditions on a spousal support award,\nsuch as termination upon remarriage of the recipient spouse, or termination upon failure\nof the recipient spouse to meet certain requirements. Kuhlo v. Kuhlo, No. M2015-02155-\nCOA-R3-CV, 2016 WL 3537198, at *10 (Tenn. Ct. App. June 23, 2016) (perm. app.\ndenied Oct. 19, 2016) (“[A] condition for Wife receiving the transitional alimony is that\n                                            -6-\n\fWife had to work to receive the extra ten percent by providing bookkeeping services . . .\npending the sale of the properties.”); Jackman v. Jackman, 373 S.W.3d 535, 538 (Tenn.\nCt. App. 2011) (“[T]rial court ordered Wife to undergo a vocational rehabilitation\nevaluation and enroll in a displaced spouses program” and “stressed that Wife‟s failure to\ndo so could result in termination of her alimony award.”); Harris v. Harris, No. M2008-\n00601-COA-R3-CV, 2009 WL 416007, at *4 (Tenn. Ct. App. Feb. 18, 2009) (“[A] court\nmay provide in its decree that transitional alimony will automatically terminate upon\nremarriage of the payee . . . so long as such an agreement is incorporated into the\ndecree.”).\n\n       We note that the educational and vocational conditions the trial court placed on the\naward of rehabilitative alimony reflect Wife‟s requests at trial. On direct examination,\nWife testified:\n\n      THE COURT: So how much longer do you have to get to a degree in\n      college?\n\n      THE WITNESS: I could probably, if I really put my nose to the\n      grindstone, finish in about a year and a half.\n\n      THE COURT: How many hours do you need?\n\n      THE WITNESS: I‟d have to go back and look, but I have – I‟m down to\n      the finish. I‟m pretty close. You know, and I say a year and a half, but,\n      you know, with Andrew and everything, probably two.\n\n      THE COURT: This would be a degree in education?\n\n      THE WITNESS: Yes, sir. Early -- I‟d like to teach middle school. It‟s\n      probably two years. I mean, just for the benefit of a doubt.\n\n      Q. Have you looked into and been able to determine what the cost will be\n      for you to complete your degree?\n\n      A. I have, and I put that on that sheet. I just, like I said, I amortized it, you\n      know, based on the – like, a semester. It would be about 676, and I think\n      that included books for a semester.\n      ....\n      THE COURT: Are you asking the Court to make an award of rehabilitative\n      alimony?\n\n      A. You know – and I don‟t expect [Husband] to raise me, but I would like\n      to get on my feet and start a career that I could, you know, take care of\n                                         -7-\n\f       myself and our son, and, you know, so I could look forward to some\n       retirement at some point in my life.\n\n       Q. And your decision is to go into education?\n\n       A. Yes, sir.\n\nWife received what she requested from the trial court. Accordingly, we conclude the trial\ncourt did not abuse its discretion by placing educational and vocational requirements on\nits award of rehabilitative alimony.\n\n       B.     Motion to Alter or Amend\n\n        Wife contends that the trial court abused its discretion by denying her motion to\nalter or amend the award of rehabilitative alimony and argues the court subsequently\nterminated her rehabilitative alimony. Wife filed her motion to alter or amend pursuant\nto Tenn. R. Civ. P. 59.04. A motion to alter or amend a final judgment filed pursuant to\nRule 59.04 allows a trial court “to correct errors before the judgment becomes final.” In\nre M.L.D., 182 S.W.3d 890, 895 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2005), and a trial court‟s ruling on the\nmotion “will be reversed only for an abuse of discretion.” Stovall v. Clarke, 113 S.W.3d\n715, 721 (Tenn. 2003). Motions to alter or amend a judgment pursuant to Rule 59.04\nmay be granted “„(1) when the controlling law changes before a judgment becomes final,\n(2) when previously unavailable evidence becomes available, or (3) when, for sui generis\nreasons, a judgment should be amended to correct a clear error of law or to prevent\ninjustice.‟” Whalum v. Marshall, 224 S.W.3d 169, 175 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2006) (quoting\nBradley v. McLeod, 984 S.W.2d 929, 933 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1998)). The moving party\nbears the burden of showing a basis for amending the judgment. Smith v. Smith, No.\nM2007-02650-COA-R3-CV, 2008 WL 5158189, at *2 (Tenn. Ct. App. Dec. 8, 2008).\n\n       Because Wife did not allege that there was a change in the law or that previously\nunavailable evidence had become available, her request for relief falls into the third\ncategory: the judgment should be altered or amended to correct a clear error of law or\nprevent injustice. The transcript of the hearing reveals that Wife requested that the trial\ncourt alter or amend the award of rehabilitative alimony by removing the educational and\nvocational requirements because she no longer desired to become a teacher. She testified\nshe had started working for a science center as an education director and grant writer, and\nshe desired to continue in that capacity. Wife argued there is no case or statute that\npermits a court to determine the educational and vocational decisions of the recipient\nspouse, “except as it pertains to a determination that the party has not made an effort to\nrehabilitate herself after a certain period of time.” As discussed above, a trial court is not\nprohibited from placing conditions on an award of spousal support, and it is not\nappropriate for this Court to substitute our judgment for that of the trial court.\n\n                                            -8-\n\f       After reviewing Wife‟s assertions regarding the educational and vocational\nrequirements, as well as the record, we conclude that Wife has failed to meet her burden\nof showing the trial court abused its discretion in placing conditions on her award of\nrehabilitative alimony. Therefore, we affirm the trial court‟s denial of Wife‟s motion.\n\n       Finally, Wife argues that the trial court erred when it terminated the award of\nrehabilitative alimony. The trial court‟s order denying Wife‟s motion to alter or amend\ndid not terminate the alimony award. In its order, the trial court stated, “The Court\npreviously ruled that in order for [Wife] to receive alimony, she must be enrolled at\nMiddle Tennessee State University, fulltime, in the teaching program as the court has\npreviously ordered in the initial Amended Final Decree.” This language differs from that\nof the amended final decree, which ordered that Wife was to receive alimony “provided\n[Wife] is actively pursuing and showing proper progress in a Teacher Certification\nProgram at Middle Tennessee State University for a period not to exceed twenty-four\n(24) months.” Wife contends that the change in language effectively terminated the\nrehabilitative alimony award. At the motion hearing, however, Wife testified that she had\nattempted to enroll in only one class during the year-and-a-half time period between the\namended final decree and the motion hearing. Because Wife failed to fulfill the\nconditions placed on the alimony award as set forth in the amended final decree, the\nalimony award terminated by its own terms. We conclude, therefore, that the change in\nlanguage did not constitute reversible error.\n\n                                              (2)\n\n                                Husband‟s Separate Property\n\n       We turn now to the trial court‟s classification of three real properties as Husband‟s\nseparate property. Wife argues that the trial court erred by classifying these properties as\nHusband‟s separate property and contends they should have been included in the marital\nestate under the doctrine of transmutation.\n\n        Division of a marital estate begins with the identification of all of the parties‟\nproperty interests. Owens, 241 S.W.3d at 485. Next, these property interests must be\nclassified as either separate or marital. Id.; Fox v. Fox, No. M2004-02616-COA-R3-CV,\n2006 WL 2535407, at *2 (Tenn. Ct. App. Sept. 1, 2006). Decisions pertaining to the\nclassification of property as either separate or marital are intrinsically factual. Woodward\nv. Woodward, 240 S.W.3d 825, 828 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2007). Consequently, a trial court‟s\nclassification of property as either separate or marital will not be disturbed unless it is not\nsupported by a preponderance of the evidence. See TENN. R. APP. P. 13(d); Owens, 241\nS.W.3d at 485.\n\n      Separate property is defined as “[a]ll real and personal property owned by a\nspouse before marriage[.]” Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-4-121(b)(2)(A). Conversely, marital\n                                       -9-\n\fproperty is defined as “all real and personal property, both tangible and intangible,\nacquired by either or both spouses during the course of the marriage up to the date of the\nfinal divorce hearing and owned by either or both spouses as of the date of filing of a\ncomplaint for divorce[.]” Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-4-121(b)(1)(A). Only marital property\nis subject to division upon the dissolution of a marriage. Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-4-121(a);\nSmith v. Smith, 93 S.W.3d 871, 876 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2002).\n\n       The demarcation between separate and marital property is not always clear. If one\nspouse gives property to the other spouse that might otherwise be considered marital\nproperty, the gifted property becomes the recipient spouse‟s separate property. Kinard,\n986 S.W.2d at 232. Conversely, separate property can become marital property by either\ncommingling or transmutation:\n\n      “[S]eparate property becomes marital property [by commingling] if\n      inextricably mingled with the marital property or with the separate property\n      of the other spouse. If the separate property continues to be segregated or\n      can be traced into its product, commingling does not occur . . . .\n      [Transmutation] occurs when separate property is treated in such a way as\n      to give evidence of an intention that it become marital property . . . . The\n      rationale underlying these doctrines is that dealing with property in these\n      ways creates a rebuttable presumption of a gift to the marital estate. This\n      presumption is based upon the provision in many marital property statutes\n      that property acquired during the marriage is presumed to be marital. The\n      presumption can be rebutted by evidence of circumstances or\n      communications clearly indicating an intent that the property remain\n      separate.”\n\nTakeda v. Takeda, No. E2006-02499-COA-R3-CV, 2007 WL 4374036, at *3 (Tenn. Ct.\nApp. Dec. 17, 2007) (quoting Langschmidt, 81 S.W.3d at 747 (citations omitted)).\n\n      A.      510 Spring Street\n\n        The first disputed property we will address is the 510 Spring Street property. The\ntrial court classified this asset as Husband‟s separate property. Wife contends that, while\nthis asset was Husband‟s separate property at the time of the marriage, the asset\ntransmuted into marital property because the parties treated it as a marital property.\n\n       The parties used the 510 Spring Street property as their sole marital residence\nthroughout their twelve-year marriage. We have previously noted in regard to a marital\nresidence:\n\n      “A residence should not be classified as marital property simply because\n      the parties have lived in it. However, as a general matter, a marital\n                                       - 10 -\n\f        residence acquired by the parties during the marriage and owned by the\n        parties jointly should be classified as marital property. Even a marital\n        residence that was . . . purchased using separate property should be\n        classified as marital property if the parties owned it jointly because joint\n        ownership gives rise to a rebuttable presumption that the property is\n        marital, rather than separate property.\n\n        However, as relevant as record ownership may be to the classification of an\n        asset, it is not always controlling. In the final analysis, whether a particular\n        asset is marital or separate depends on the conduct of the parties not the\n        record title of the asset . . .\n\n        Four of the most common factors courts use to determine whether real\n        property has been transmuted from separate property to marital property\n        are: (1) the use of the property as a marital residence; (2) the ongoing\n        maintenance and management of the property by both parties; (3) placing\n        the title to the property in joint ownership; and (4) using the credit of the\n        non-owner spouse to improve the property.”\n\nTakeda, 2007 WL 4374036, at *3 (quoting Fox, 2006 WL 2535407, at *5).\n\n         Evidence adduced at trial shows that Husband purchased the property in 1984, and\nhe paid off the mortgage on the property prior to the marriage. Additionally, title to the\nproperty remained in Husband‟s name only for the duration of the marriage. There is\nlittle evidence concerning Wife‟s efforts to preserve or increase the value of this property.\nIn fact, the record shows that both parties allowed the property to fall into a state of\ndisrepair.2\n\n        The record shows that Husband used the property as collateral twice during the\nmarriage. The first time was for a $15,000 loan in 2003, and the second time was for a\n$35,000 loan in 2007. Each time Husband used the property as collateral he used the\nloan obtained to purchase one of the parties‟ rental properties, and both loans were paid\noff during the marriage.3 Wife signed both deeds of trust connected to the two loans.\nWife contends that using the property as collateral and affixing her signature to the deeds\nof trust transmuted the property into marital property.\n\n      In Sandford v. McKee, M2010-00562-COA-R3-CV, 2012 WL 4474177 (Tenn. Ct.\nApp. Sept. 27, 2012), Chas Sandford purchased a 63-acre farm with a house on it prior to\nmarrying Kristine Sandford. Sandford, 2012 WL 4474177 at *1. Mr. Sandford took out\n\n2\n  The record includes pictures of the house showing a tarp over sections of the roof and poorly patched\nplumbing.\n3\n  The trial court classified the rental properties as marital property, and they are not disputed on appeal.\n                                                  - 11 -\n\fa mortgage on the property seven years into the marriage, and both Mr. and Mrs.\nSandford signed the deed of trust connected with this mortgage. Id. at *2. Mr. Sandford\nobtained a home equity loan on the property six months later, using the house and 63\nacres as security for the loan. Id. Mr. and Mrs. Sandford again both signed the deed of\ntrust. Id. Mrs. Sandford argued that her signature on the deeds of trust transmuted the\nproperty into a marital asset. Id. at *3. We disagreed and stated:\n\n      We do not believe that Wife‟s signature on the Deeds of Trust has any\n      effect on her ownership interest . . . . It is not unusual for a bank, when\n      loaning money to one spouse who is the record owner of a piece of\n      property, to require the other spouse to sign a Deed of Trust to protect the\n      bank‟s interest in the property. . . . [T]he act of signing one or more Deeds\n      of Trust, without more, does not transfer any rights in the property to the\n      nonowner spouse that he or she does not otherwise have.\n\nId. at *6 (emphasis added).\n\n       In this case, Wife presented no evidence that she signed the note for either loan,\nassumed liability for either note, or that she made any payments on either loan. The\nevidence, therefore, does not preponderate against the trial court‟s classification of the\nproperty as Husband‟s separate property, and we conclude that the property did not\nbecome marital property as a result of transmutation.\n\n      B.     403 Bennett Street\n\n       We now turn to the second disputed property, the 403 Bennett Street property.\nThe trial court classified this property as Husband‟s separate property as well. Wife\nasserts that the trial court erred because she contributed “sweat equity” to the property,\nwhich transmuted it into marital property.\n\n       Husband purchased the property in 1996 and paid off the mortgage associated with\nthe property prior to the marriage by using an inheritance he received from his mother‟s\nestate. The property served as one of several rental properties the parties managed during\ntheir marriage. According to Wife, she contributed “sweat equity” towards the property\nby managing the property, cleaning and repainting after tenants moved out, and digging a\nditch.\n\n       If property determined to be separate property increases in value during the\nmarriage, the appreciation will be classified as marital property “if each party\nsubstantially contributed to its preservation and appreciation.” Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-4-\n121(b)(1)(B); see also Keyt v. Keyt, 244 S.W.3d 321, 328-29 (Tenn. 2007); Summer v.\nSummer, 296 S.W.3d 57, 62 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2008). The Supreme Court has stated the\nfollowing in regards to the contributions of a non-owner spouse:\n                                            - 12 -\n\f        While these contributions may be either “direct” or “indirect,” Tenn. Code\n        Ann. § 36-4-121(b)(1)(D), they must satisfy two requirements. McFarland\n        v. McFarland, No. M2005-01260-COA-R3-CV, 2007 WL 2254576, at *6\n        (Tenn. Ct. App. Aug. 6, 2007). First, the contributions must be “real and\n        significant.” Id.; Brown [v. Brown], 913 S.W.2d [163, 167 (Tenn. Ct. App.\n        1994)]. “Second, there must be some link between the spouses‟\n        contributions and the appreciation in the value of the separate property.”\n        McFarland, 2007 WL 2254576, at *6; Landgschmidt, 81 S.W.3d at 746.\n        Whether a spouse made a “substantial contribution” to the preservation and\n        appreciation of separate property is a question of fact. Sherrill v. Sherrill,\n        831 S.W.3d 293, 295 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1992).\n\nKeyt, 244 S.W.3d at 329.\n\n       In the present case, the trial court classified the 403 Bennett Street property as\nHusband‟s separate property but made no findings of fact regarding an appreciation in the\nvalue of the property during the parties‟ marriage. Examination of the record reveals\nthere was no evidence introduced at trial that the property increased in value while the\nparties were married. In fact, Husband testified that every property he owned was in\n“bad shape” and in need of “significant” financial investment. Because there was no\nevidence adduced at trial that the property increased in value during the marriage, we\nneed not consider whether Wife‟s actions constituted a substantial contribution. The\nevidence, therefore, does not preponderate against the trial court‟s classification of the\nproperty as Husband‟s separate property.\n\n        C.      508 Spring Street\n\n       The final property in dispute is 508 Spring Street. This property is a triplex\nlocated next door to the marital residence, and it generated rental income for the parties.\nHusband acquired 508 Spring Street in 1996; however, Husband continued to make\npayments on the loan connected to the property until six years after the parties married.\nAs a result, the trial court classified the property as marital property and awarded it to\nHusband. The trial court awarded Wife $10,000 for her interest in the property.\n\n        On appeal, Wife argues that this property, like the two above, should have been\nclassified as marital property under the doctrine of transmutation. This argument is\nwithout merit because the trial court classified the property as a marital asset and\nincluded it in its division of the marital estate.4\n4\n Under the “Statement of the Case” section of Wife‟s brief, Wife raises the issue that the trial court erred\nby failing to assign a value to the 508 Spring Street Property before dividing the marital estate. Wife does\nnot address this issue in the “Argument” section of her brief. Tennessee Rules of Appellate Procedure\n27(a)(7) states that an appellant‟s brief shall contain:\n         An argument, which may be preceded by a summary of argument, setting forth . . . the\n                                                  - 13 -\n\f                                                       (3)\n\n                                             Rule 60.02 Motion\n\n        After the trial court entered the supplemental order, which denied Wife‟s motion\nto alter or amend the alimony award and incorporated by reference the amended final\ndecree of divorce, Wife filed a motion entitled “Petition for Finding of Fraudulent\nTransfers of Marital Assets in Anticipation of Divorce and for Contempt of Court\nthrough Violation of the Statutory Restraining Order.” In the pleading, Wife alleged that\nHusband fraudulently withdrew approximately $388,000 from the parties‟ marital stock\naccount. According to Wife, the withdrawals began in 2009, prior to Husband filing for\ndivorce, and continued through 2014. Wife contended in the pleading, and on appeal,\nthat these withdrawals were fraudulent because Husband made them for “the sole purpose\nof depleting the marital estate.” Accordingly, Wife filed the motion seeking relief from\nthe trial court‟s prior order dividing the parties‟ marital property, specifically the marital\nstock account, to reflect the unauthorized withdrawals made by Husband.5 The trial court\ndenied Wife‟s motion; it found that Husband‟s withdrawals were “reasonable and\nnecessary” because the trial court had previously ordered him to make payments “in the\nnatural course of business in maintaining the parties‟ marital assets.”\n\n       Wife‟s petition states that it is brought under Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure\n60.01, which provides relief when the judgment or order shows on its face that it contains\nerrors caused by oversight or omission. TENN. R. CIV. P. 60.01; Jerkins v. McKinney,\n533 S.W.2d 275, 280 (Tenn. 1976). Wife points to no such error. Consequently, the trial\ncourt properly construed the motion under Rule 60.02, which provides in pertinent part:\n\n        On motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party . .\n        . from a final judgment, order or proceeding for the following reasons: (1)\n        mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect; (2) fraud (whether\n        heretofore denominated intrinsic or extrinsic), misrepresentation, or other\n        misconduct of an adverse party; (3) the judgment is void; (4) the judgment\n        has been satisfied, released or discharged, or a prior judgment upon which\n        it is based has been reversed or otherwise vacated, or it is no longer\n        equitable that a judgment should have prospective application; or (5) any\n\n         contentions of the appellant with respect to the issues presented, and the reasons therefor,\n         including the reasons why the contentions require appellate relief, with citations to the\n         authorities and appropriate references to the record (which may be quoted verbatim)\n         relied on[.]\nWe conclude that Wife‟s failure to comply with the Rules of Appellate Procedure waives the issue for\nreview. Bean v. Bean, 40 S.W.3d 52, 55 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2000).\n5\n  The trial court determined the division of the parties‟ marital property, including the stock account at\nissue on appeal, in the amended decree for divorce. The amended decree was incorporated by reference\ninto the supplemental order, from which Wife sought Rule 60.02 relief.\n                                                 - 14 -\n\f      other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment. The\n      motion shall be made within a reasonable time, and for reasons (1) and (2)\n      not more than one year after the judgment, order or proceeding was entered\n      or taken.\n\n       The disposition of a motion under Rule 60.02 of the Tennessee Rules of Civil\nProcedure is within the sound discretion of the trial judge. Henderson v. SAIA, Inc., 318\nS.W.3d 328, 335 (Tenn. 2010). Accordingly, appellate courts defer to a trial court‟s\ndecision to either grant or deny relief pursuant to Rule 60.02, and we will uphold these\ndecisions absent an abuse of discretion. DeLong v. Vanderbilt Univ., 186 S.W.3d 506,\n511 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2005).\n\n       Relief under Rule 60.02 is an exceptional remedy that allows a court “„to alleviate\nthe effect of an oppressive or onerous final judgment.‟” Black v. Black, 166 S.W.3d 699,\n703 (Tenn. 2005) (quoting Killion v. Dep’t of Human Servs., 845 S.W.2d 212, 213 (Tenn.\n1992)); see also Dockery v. State, No. M2006-00014-COA-R3-CV, 2007 WL 2198195,\nat *2 (Tenn. Ct. App. July 23, 2007). Our Supreme Court has described Rule 60.02 as an\n“„escape valve from possible inequity that might otherwise arise from the unrelenting\nimposition of the principle of finality imbedded in our procedural rules.‟” Henderson,\n318 S.W.3d at 336 (quoting Thompson v. Firemen’s Fund Ins. Co., 798 S.W.2d 235, 238\n(Tenn. 1990)). A party seeking relief under Rule 60.02 must prove by clear and\nconvincing evidence that it is entitled to relief. Id. This is a heavy burden because clear\nand convincing evidence is evidence “„in which there is no serious or substantial doubt\nabout the correctness of the conclusions drawn from the evidence.‟” Furlough v.\nSpherion Atlantic Workforce, LLC, 397 S.W.3d 114, 128 (Tenn. 2013) (quoting Hodges\nv. S.C. Toof & Co., 833 S.W.2d 896, 901 n.3 (Tenn. 1992)). Additionally, a party who\nseeks Rule 60.02 relief on the ground of fraud must provide clear and convincing\nevidence of conduct that amounts to:\n\n      [A]n intentional contrivance by a party to keep complainant and the Court\n      in ignorance of the real facts touching the matters in litigation, whereby a\n      wrong conclusion was reached, and positive wrong done to the\n      complainant‟s rights.\n\nDuncan v. Duncan, 789 S.W.2d 557, 563 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1990) (quoting 11 C. Wright &\nA. Miller, FEDERAL PRACTICE & PROC. § 2861 (1973)).\n\n       Guided by the foregoing principles, we now examine the proof Wife provided in\nsupport of her Rule 60.02 motion. The only proof Wife provided in support of her claim,\nin both the motion and at the hearing on the motion, consisted of the stock account‟s\nmonthly statements, which showed withdrawals from the account. Wife presented no\nevidence that Husband concealed these withdrawals, or that he secreted the funds into\nanother account. Husband testified that he made the withdrawals because he paid the\n                                        - 15 -\n\fmarital debts and expenses associated with the parties‟ rental properties from the stock\naccount.\n\n      One of the withdrawals Wife relied on in support of her motion totaled $18,250.\nAccording to Wife, this withdrawal demonstrated that Husband made the withdrawal for\nhis own benefit because it equaled the amount the Final Decree for Divorce ordered\nHusband to pay Wife as payment for the difference in the value in the parties‟ cars and\nfor Wife‟s interest in the 508 Spring Street property. Wife, therefore, contends that\nHusband paid her with her own funds.\n\n        The trial found that Husband did not pay Wife with her own money, and the\nevidence does not preponderate otherwise. For example, Husband testified at the hearing\non the motion that the Fidelity stock account from which he paid Wife the $18,250 was\nseparate from the Fidelity stock account at issue. Husband testified that the stock account\nreferenced by Wife‟s motion was a checking account, whereas the stock account from\nwhich he paid Wife the $18,250 was a vested stock account. Wife‟s half of the vested\nstock account remained untouched. The stock account statements alone are insufficient\nto meet Wife‟s burden by clear and convincing evidence. Accordingly, we conclude that\nthe trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Wife‟s Rule 60.02 motion.\n\n        In connection with the trial court‟s denial of Wife‟s Rule 60.02 motion, Wife\nargues that the trial court erred by precluding discovery related to the motion. Prior to\nfiling the Rule 60.02 motion, Wife scheduled a deposition of Husband. Husband filed a\nmotion for protective order pursuant to Tenn. R. Civ. P. 26.02 and 26.03 to prevent the\ndeposition, which the trial court granted.\n\n        Decisions concerning discovery issues “rest within the sound discretion of the trial\ncourt.” Benton v. Snyder, 825 S.W.2d 409, 416 (Tenn. 1992). Therefore, we apply the\nabuse of discretion standard when reviewing a trial court‟s decision to grant or deny\ndiscovery requests. Johnson v. Nissan N. Am., Inc., 146 S.W.3d 600, 604 (Tenn. Ct. App.\n2004). The Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure favor discovery of any relevant\nevidence, unless the evidence is privileged or subject to protection. TENN. R. CIV. P.\n26.02(1); Duncan, 789 S.W.2d at 560. Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure 26.03 permits\na trial court to limit discovery; however, the party opposing discovery has the burden of\nproving with more than conclusory statements and generalizations that limitations are\nnecessary “„to protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or\nundue burden or expense.‟” Id. at 561 (quoting TENN. R. CIV. P. 26.03). If a party\nseeking to limit discovery fails to support its request with specific facts, a trial court\nshould deny the request. Id. Moreover, a trial court should “„balance one party‟s need\nfor information against the injury that would allegedly result if disclosure is compelled,‟”\nIn re NHC – Nashville Fire Litig., 293 S.W.3d 547, 563 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2008) (quoting\nBallard v. Herzke, 924 S.W.2d 652, 658 (Tenn. 1996)), and it should consider the\n\n                                           - 16 -\n\favailability of less burdensome methods for obtaining the requested information.\nDuncan, 789 S.W.2d at 561.\n\n       In his motion, Husband claimed a protective order should be issued because the\ndiscovery Wife sought via deposition was “unreasonably cumulative or duplicative or is\nobtainable from some other source that is more convenient, less burdensome or less\nexpensive[,]” and because Wife had abundant opportunity via other discovery in the case\nto acquire the information sought. The trial court agreed and granted Husband an order\nof protection precluding all discovery related to Wife‟s petition concerning the fraudulent\ntransfers. The evidence in the record does not preponderate against this decision. At the\nhearing on the motion, Husband‟s counsel informed the trial court there had been several\nrounds of discovery in the case and the stock account statements that were at issue had\nbeen produced previously. Moreover, the record reveals that Wife‟s counsel acquired the\nstock account statements prior to the hearing concerning Husband‟s withdrawals from the\nstock account, which is evidenced by Wife‟s counsel using those stock account\nstatements in support of the Rule 60.02 motion. We also note that Wife had the\nopportunity to cross-examine Husband about the alleged fraudulent transfers during the\nhearing on the Rule 60.02 motion. We find that Wife had sufficient opportunity to obtain\nthe information she sought through prior discovery and conclude the trial court did not\nabuse its discretion in denying Wife‟s request for additional discovery related to her Rule\n60.02 motion.\n\n                                        CONCLUSION\n\n       The judgment of the trial court is affirmed in all respects. Costs of appeal are\nassessed against appellant, Jamie Treadwell, for which execution may issue if necessary.\n\n\n                                                           _________________________\n                                                           ANDY D.

GARY THOMAS LAMB\n\n                 Appeal from the Circuit Court for Franklin County\n                  No. 18018CV        Thomas W. Graham, Judge\n                     ___________________________________\n\n                           No. M2015-01391-COA-R3-CV\n                       ___________________________________\n\n\nThis appeal involves the financial aspects of a divorce, which ended a twelve-year\nmarriage. The trial court granted both parties a divorce, divided the marital estate, and\nawarded Wife rehabilitative alimony for twenty-four months, provided she actively\npursued a teaching degree at Middle Tennessee State University. Wife filed a motion to\nalter or amend the award of alimony to remove the education and vocation requirements.\nThe trial court denied the motion. Wife filed a motion pursuant to Tennessee Rule of\nCivil Procedure 60.02 seeking relief from the trial court‟s order dividing the marital\nestate due to Husband‟s alleged fraudulent withdrawals from the parties‟ marital stock\naccount. The trial court denied the motion. On appeal, Wife takes issue with the\neducational and vocational requirements the trial court placed on the spousal support\naward and with the trial court‟s division of the marital estate. She also appeals the trial\ncourt‟s denial of her Rule 60.02 motion. We affirm the trial court‟s judgment in all\nrespects.\n\n  Tenn. R. App. P. 3 Appeal as of Right; Judgment of the Circuit Court Affirmed\n\nANDY D. BENNETT, J., delivered the opinion of the court, in which FRANK G. CLEMENT,\nJR., P.J., M.S., and W. NEAL MCBRAYER, J., joined.\n\nCynthia A. Cheatham, Manchester, Tennessee, for the appellant, Jamie Treadwell.\n\nWilliam A. Lockhart, Tullahoma, Tennessee, for the appellee, Gary Thomas Lamb.\n\f                                                  OPINION\n\n                              FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n      Jamie Treadwell Lamb (“Wife”) and Gary Thomas Lamb (“Husband”) married on\nSeptember 12, 1998. One child was born of the marriage.1\n\n       Husband had a bachelor‟s degree in computer science and worked as a software\nengineer throughout the marriage. Wife had two years of college in pursuit of an\neducation degree. During the early years of the marriage, Wife first worked for a medical\nequipment company and then worked in real estate after obtaining her real estate license.\nShe eventually stopped working when the parties‟ son was born in December 2000. The\ncouple acquired several real properties and operated an antique store during the course of\nthe marriage. Husband acquired substantial assets in employer-related investment\naccounts.\n\n        Husband filed for divorce on September 17, 2010, alleging inappropriate marital\nconduct and irreconcilable differences. Wife filed an answer followed by an amended\nanswer and counter-complaint for divorce on the same grounds as those alleged by\nHusband. Wife sought alimony, attorney‟s fees, and an equitable division of the marital\nestate.\n\n       The trial court heard the case on March 4 and March 11, 2013. The parties were\nunable to agree on the classification of their assets. Their disagreements primarily\ncentered on three real properties located in Decherd, Tennessee: (1) 510 Spring Street,\n(2) 403 Bennett Street, and (3) 508 Spring Street. Each will be discussed further in the\nanalysis section of this opinion. The trial court entered a final decree of divorce and\npermanent parenting plan on December 3, 2010. An amended final decree of divorce was\nentered on December 10, 2010. In the amended final decree, the trial court awarded a\ndivorce to both parties, established custody, ordered the sale of personal property and real\nproperty, divided the marital estate equally between the parties, and awarded Wife\nspousal support in the amount of $2,444 for twenty-four months, provided she pursued an\neducation degree from Middle Tennessee State University. Additionally, the trial court\nfound three assets to be Husband‟s separate property: (1) Jacobs/Vanguard Investment\nAccount, (2) 510 Spring Street, and (3) 403 Bennett Street.\n\n      Wife filed a motion asking the trial court to alter or amend the alimony award by\nremoving the vocational and educational requirements because she no longer wished to\nbecome a teacher. The trial court denied the motion to alter or amend the alimony award.\nWife then filed a Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure 60.02 motion alleging that Husband\n\n\n1\n    The parties‟ child is still a minor. Custody is not an issue on appeal.\n                                                      -2-\n\ffraudulently removed funds from a marital stock account. The trial court denied the Rule\n60.02 motion, and Wife appealed.\n\n        Wife raises three issues on appeal. First, she contends that the trial court abused\nits discretion by placing educational and vocational conditions on the spousal support\naward. Second, she contends that the trial court erred in classifying certain pieces of real\nproperty as Husband‟s separate property. Lastly, she argues that the trial court erred in\ndenying her Rule 60.02 motion. We shall address each issue in turn.\n\n                                      STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n       We review a trial court‟s findings of fact de novo with a presumption of\ncorrectness unless the evidence preponderates otherwise.

The\npurpose of rehabilitative support is to facilitate the disadvantaged spouse in obtaining\nadditional job skills, education, or training so that he or she will become more self-\nsufficient. Kinard v. Kinard, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1078827\"><a href=\"/opinion/1078827/kinard-v-kinard/\"><span class=\"volume\">986</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 234 (Tenn.

By contrast,\nthe purpose of long-term spousal support is to “provide support to a disadvantaged\nspouse who is unable to achieve some degree of self-sufficiency.” Id.\n\n     In determining whether to award spousal support, and in determining the nature,\namount, length of term, and manner of payment, courts consider the following factors:\n\n      (1) The relative earning capacity, obligations, needs, and financial\n      resources of each party, including, income from pension, profit sharing or\n      retirement plans and all other sources;\n\n      (2) The relative education and training of each party, the ability and\n      opportunity of each party to secure such education and training, and the\n      necessity of a party to secure further education and training to improve such\n      party‟s earnings capacity to a reasonable level;\n\n      (3) The duration of the marriage;\n\n      (4) The age and mental condition of each party;\n\n      (5) The physical condition of each party, including, but not limited to,\n      physical disability or incapacity due to a chronic debilitating disease;\n\n      (6) The extent to which it would be undesirable for a party to seek\n      employment outside the home, because such party will be custodian of a\n      minor child of the marriage;\n\n      (7) The separate assets of each party, both real and personal, tangible and\n      intangible;\n\n      (8) The provisions made with regard to the marital property, as defined in\n      § 36-4-121;\n\n                                          -4-\n\f      (9) The standard of living of the parties established during the marriage;\n\n      (10) The extent to which each party has made such tangible and intangible\n      contributions to the marriage as monetary and homemaker contributions,\n      and tangible and intangible contributions by a party to the education,\n      training or increased earning power of the other party;\n\n      (11) The relative fault of the parties, in cases where the court, in its\n      discretion, deems it appropriate to do so; and\n\n      (12) Such other factors, including the tax consequences to each party, as\n      are necessary to consider the equities between the parties.\n\nTenn.

Therefore, we must conduct an\nindependent review of the record to determine where the preponderance of the evidence\nlies with regard to this issue. Crabtree v. Crabtree, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1060616\"><a href=\"/opinion/1060616/crabtree-v-crabtree/\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">356</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 360 (Tenn. 2000).\n\n                                           -5-\n\f        Wife was forty-seven years old at the time of trial, and there was no evidence\npresented to indicate she had any health issues. At the time of the marriage, Wife worked\nfor a medical supply company earning $40,000 per year. She later obtained a real estate\nlicense and worked in real estate. However, Wife spent ten years out of the workforce so\nshe could remain at home to raise the parties‟ child and assist in managing their antique\nstore and rental properties. At the time of trial, she worked part-time for a greeting card\nstore earning $300 per month. Wife has two years of college towards an education\ndegree and testified that she anticipated completing her college degree in two years. This\nadditional education can be expected to increase Wife‟s ability to earn more income than\nshe is currently earning. Wife testified that she could earn $40,000 per year as a teacher.\n\n        Husband, who was fifty-two years old at the time of trial, has a college degree and\nworks as a software engineer. Tax returns adduced at trial showed that Husband earned\n$265,000 in 2010, $337,146 in 2011, and $204,541 in 2012. After conducting a thorough\nexamination of the record, we conclude that the evidence preponderates in favor of\nfinding that Wife is economically disadvantaged relative to Husband and that she can be\nrehabilitated. In light of these facts and the relevant factors in Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-5-\n121, we conclude that rehabilitative alimony is appropriate and consistent with the\nlegislative preference to rehabilitate the disadvantaged spouse whenever possible. see\nRobertson, 76 S.W.3d at 339.\n\n       On appeal, Wife contends that the trial court abused its discretion by placing\neducational and vocational conditions on the award of spousal support. We disagree. As\ndiscussed above, trial courts are accorded broad discretion when making spousal support\ndecisions.

Id. at 739 n.1. Current Tennessee law,\nhowever, grants trial courts control of an award of rehabilitative alimony for the duration\nof the award. Tenn. Code. Ann. § 36-5-121(e)(2). While the current statute gives trial\ncourts control of rehabilitative alimony awards without requiring the awards be subject to\nconditions, it does not prohibit trial courts from placing conditions on rehabilitative\nalimony awards. Id.\n\n        It is not uncommon for a court to place conditions on a spousal support award,\nsuch as termination upon remarriage of the recipient spouse, or termination upon failure\nof the recipient spouse to meet certain requirements.

Ct. App. Dec. 8, 2008).\n\n       Because Wife did not allege that there was a change in the law or that previously\nunavailable evidence had become available, her request for relief falls into the third\ncategory: the judgment should be altered or amended to correct a clear error of law or\nprevent injustice. The transcript of the hearing reveals that Wife requested that the trial\ncourt alter or amend the award of rehabilitative alimony by removing the educational and\nvocational requirements because she no longer desired to become a teacher. She testified\nshe had started working for a science center as an education director and grant writer, and\nshe desired to continue in that capacity. Wife argued there is no case or statute that\npermits a court to determine the educational and vocational decisions of the recipient\nspouse, “except as it pertains to a determination that the party has not made an effort to\nrehabilitate herself after a certain period of time.” As discussed above, a trial court is not\nprohibited from placing conditions on an award of spousal support, and it is not\nappropriate for this Court to substitute our judgment for that of the trial court.\n\n                                            -8-\n\f       After reviewing Wife‟s assertions regarding the educational and vocational\nrequirements, as well as the record, we conclude that Wife has failed to meet her burden\nof showing the trial court abused its discretion in placing conditions on her award of\nrehabilitative alimony. Therefore, we affirm the trial court‟s denial of Wife‟s motion.\n\n       Finally, Wife argues that the trial court erred when it terminated the award of\nrehabilitative alimony. The trial court‟s order denying Wife‟s motion to alter or amend\ndid not terminate the alimony award. In its order, the trial court stated, “The Court\npreviously ruled that in order for [Wife] to receive alimony, she must be enrolled at\nMiddle Tennessee State University, fulltime, in the teaching program as the court has\npreviously ordered in the initial Amended Final Decree.” This language differs from that\nof the amended final decree, which ordered that Wife was to receive alimony “provided\n[Wife] is actively pursuing and showing proper progress in a Teacher Certification\nProgram at Middle Tennessee State University for a period not to exceed twenty-four\n(24) months.” Wife contends that the change in language effectively terminated the\nrehabilitative alimony award. At the motion hearing, however, Wife testified that she had\nattempted to enroll in only one class during the year-and-a-half time period between the\namended final decree and the motion hearing. Because Wife failed to fulfill the\nconditions placed on the alimony award as set forth in the amended final decree, the\nalimony award terminated by its own terms. We conclude, therefore, that the change in\nlanguage did not constitute reversible error.\n\n                                              (2)\n\n                                Husband‟s Separate Property\n\n       We turn now to the trial court‟s classification of three real properties as Husband‟s\nseparate property. Wife argues that the trial court erred by classifying these properties as\nHusband‟s separate property and contends they should have been included in the marital\nestate under the doctrine of transmutation.\n\n        Division of a marital estate begins with the identification of all of the parties‟\nproperty interests. Owens, 241 S.W.3d at 485. Next, these property interests must be\nclassified as either separate or marital. Id.; Fox v.

Ct. App. 2002).\n\n       The demarcation between separate and marital property is not always clear. If one\nspouse gives property to the other spouse that might otherwise be considered marital\nproperty, the gifted property becomes the recipient spouse‟s separate property. Kinard,\n986 S.W.2d at 232. Conversely, separate property can become marital property by either\ncommingling or transmutation:\n\n      “[S]eparate property becomes marital property [by commingling] if\n      inextricably mingled with the marital property or with the separate property\n      of the other spouse. If the separate property continues to be segregated or\n      can be traced into its product, commingling does not occur . . . .\n      [Transmutation] occurs when separate property is treated in such a way as\n      to give evidence of an intention that it become marital property . . . . The\n      rationale underlying these doctrines is that dealing with property in these\n      ways creates a rebuttable presumption of a gift to the marital estate. This\n      presumption is based upon the provision in many marital property statutes\n      that property acquired during the marriage is presumed to be marital. The\n      presumption can be rebutted by evidence of circumstances or\n      communications clearly indicating an intent that the property remain\n      separate.”\n\nTakeda v.

The\ntrial court classified this asset as Husband‟s separate property. Wife contends that, while\nthis asset was Husband‟s separate property at the time of the marriage, the asset\ntransmuted into marital property because the parties treated it as a marital property.\n\n       The parties used the 510 Spring Street property as their sole marital residence\nthroughout their twelve-year marriage. We have previously noted in regard to a marital\nresidence:\n\n      “A residence should not be classified as marital property simply because\n      the parties have lived in it. However, as a general matter, a marital\n                                       - 10 -\n\f        residence acquired by the parties during the marriage and owned by the\n        parties jointly should be classified as marital property. Even a marital\n        residence that was . . . purchased using separate property should be\n        classified as marital property if the parties owned it jointly because joint\n        ownership gives rise to a rebuttable presumption that the property is\n        marital, rather than separate property.\n\n        However, as relevant as record ownership may be to the classification of an\n        asset, it is not always controlling. In the final analysis, whether a particular\n        asset is marital or separate depends on the conduct of the parties not the\n        record title of the asset . . .\n\n        Four of the most common factors courts use to determine whether real\n        property has been transmuted from separate property to marital property\n        are: (1) the use of the property as a marital residence; (2) the ongoing\n        maintenance and management of the property by both parties; (3) placing\n        the title to the property in joint ownership; and (4) using the credit of the\n        non-owner spouse to improve the property.”\n\nTakeda, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4374036</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *3 (quoting Fox, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2535407</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *5).\n\n         Evidence adduced at trial shows that Husband purchased the property in 1984, and\nhe paid off the mortgage on the property prior to the marriage. Additionally, title to the\nproperty remained in Husband‟s name only for the duration of the marriage. There is\nlittle evidence concerning Wife‟s efforts to preserve or increase the value of this property.\nIn fact, the record shows that both parties allowed the property to fall into a state of\ndisrepair.2\n\n        The record shows that Husband used the property as collateral twice during the\nmarriage. The first time was for a $15,000 loan in 2003, and the second time was for a\n$35,000 loan in 2007. Each time Husband used the property as collateral he used the\nloan obtained to purchase one of the parties‟ rental properties, and both loans were paid\noff during the marriage.3 Wife signed both deeds of trust connected to the two loans.\nWife contends that using the property as collateral and affixing her signature to the deeds\nof trust transmuted the property into marital property.\n\n      In Sandford v.

Id. at *2. Mr. Sandford\nobtained a home equity loan on the property six months later, using the house and 63\nacres as security for the loan. Id. Mr. and Mrs. Sandford again both signed the deed of\ntrust. Id. Mrs. Sandford argued that her signature on the deeds of trust transmuted the\nproperty into a marital asset. Id. at *3. We disagreed and stated:\n\n      We do not believe that Wife‟s signature on the Deeds of Trust has any\n      effect on her ownership interest . . . . It is not unusual for a bank, when\n      loaning money to one spouse who is the record owner of a piece of\n      property, to require the other spouse to sign a Deed of Trust to protect the\n      bank‟s interest in the property. . . . [T]he act of signing one or more Deeds\n      of Trust, without more, does not transfer any rights in the property to the\n      nonowner spouse that he or she does not otherwise have.\n\nId. at *6 (emphasis added).\n\n       In this case, Wife presented no evidence that she signed the note for either loan,\nassumed liability for either note, or that she made any payments on either loan. The\nevidence, therefore, does not preponderate against the trial court‟s classification of the\nproperty as Husband‟s separate property, and we conclude that the property did not\nbecome marital property as a result of transmutation.\n\n      B.     403 Bennett Street\n\n       We now turn to the second disputed property, the 403 Bennett Street property.\nThe trial court classified this property as Husband‟s separate property as well. Wife\nasserts that the trial court erred because she contributed “sweat equity” to the property,\nwhich transmuted it into marital property.\n\n       Husband purchased the property in 1996 and paid off the mortgage associated with\nthe property prior to the marriage by using an inheritance he received from his mother‟s\nestate. The property served as one of several rental properties the parties managed during\ntheir marriage. According to Wife, she contributed “sweat equity” towards the property\nby managing the property, cleaning and repainting after tenants moved out, and digging a\nditch.\n\n       If property determined to be separate property increases in value during the\nmarriage, the appreciation will be classified as marital property “if each party\nsubstantially contributed to its preservation and appreciation.” Tenn.

Examination of the record reveals\nthere was no evidence introduced at trial that the property increased in value while the\nparties were married. In fact, Husband testified that every property he owned was in\n“bad shape” and in need of “significant” financial investment. Because there was no\nevidence adduced at trial that the property increased in value during the marriage, we\nneed not consider whether Wife‟s actions constituted a substantial contribution. The\nevidence, therefore, does not preponderate against the trial court‟s classification of the\nproperty as Husband‟s separate property.\n\n        C.      508 Spring Street\n\n       The final property in dispute is 508 Spring Street. This property is a triplex\nlocated next door to the marital residence, and it generated rental income for the parties.\nHusband acquired 508 Spring Street in 1996; however, Husband continued to make\npayments on the loan connected to the property until six years after the parties married.\nAs a result, the trial court classified the property as marital property and awarded it to\nHusband. The trial court awarded Wife $10,000 for her interest in the property.\n\n        On appeal, Wife argues that this property, like the two above, should have been\nclassified as marital property under the doctrine of transmutation. This argument is\nwithout merit because the trial court classified the property as a marital asset and\nincluded it in its division of the marital estate.4\n4\n Under the “Statement of the Case” section of Wife‟s brief, Wife raises the issue that the trial court erred\nby failing to assign a value to the 508 Spring Street Property before dividing the marital estate. Wife does\nnot address this issue in the “Argument” section of her brief. Tennessee Rules of Appellate Procedure\n27(a)(7) states that an appellant‟s brief shall contain:\n         An argument, which may be preceded by a summary of argument, setting forth . . . the\n                                                  - 13 -\n\f                                                       (3)\n\n                                             Rule 60.02 Motion\n\n        After the trial court entered the supplemental order, which denied Wife‟s motion\nto alter or amend the alimony award and incorporated by reference the amended final\ndecree of divorce, Wife filed a motion entitled “Petition for Finding of Fraudulent\nTransfers of Marital Assets in Anticipation of Divorce and for Contempt of Court\nthrough Violation of the Statutory Restraining Order.” In the pleading, Wife alleged that\nHusband fraudulently withdrew approximately $388,000 from the parties‟ marital stock\naccount. According to Wife, the withdrawals began in 2009, prior to Husband filing for\ndivorce, and continued through 2014. Wife contended in the pleading, and on appeal,\nthat these withdrawals were fraudulent because Husband made them for “the sole purpose\nof depleting the marital estate.” Accordingly, Wife filed the motion seeking relief from\nthe trial court‟s prior order dividing the parties‟ marital property, specifically the marital\nstock account, to reflect the unauthorized withdrawals made by Husband.5 The trial court\ndenied Wife‟s motion; it found that Husband‟s withdrawals were “reasonable and\nnecessary” because the trial court had previously ordered him to make payments “in the\nnatural course of business in maintaining the parties‟ marital assets.”\n\n       Wife‟s petition states that it is brought under Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure\n60.01, which provides relief when the judgment or order shows on its face that it contains\nerrors caused by oversight or omission.

A party seeking relief under Rule 60.02 must prove by clear and\nconvincing evidence that it is entitled to relief. Id.

Duncan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1492579\"><a href=\"/opinion/1492579/duncan-v-duncan/\"><span class=\"volume\">789</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">557</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 563 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1990) (quoting 11 C. Wright &\nA. Miller, FEDERAL PRACTICE & PROC. § 2861 (1973)).\n\n       Guided by the foregoing principles, we now examine the proof Wife provided in\nsupport of her Rule 60.02 motion. The only proof Wife provided in support of her claim,\nin both the motion and at the hearing on the motion, consisted of the stock account‟s\nmonthly statements, which showed withdrawals from the account. Wife presented no\nevidence that Husband concealed these withdrawals, or that he secreted the funds into\nanother account. Husband testified that he made the withdrawals because he paid the\n                                        - 15 -\n\fmarital debts and expenses associated with the parties‟ rental properties from the stock\naccount.\n\n      One of the withdrawals Wife relied on in support of her motion totaled $18,250.\nAccording to Wife, this withdrawal demonstrated that Husband made the withdrawal for\nhis own benefit because it equaled the amount the Final Decree for Divorce ordered\nHusband to pay Wife as payment for the difference in the value in the parties‟ cars and\nfor Wife‟s interest in the 508 Spring Street property. Wife, therefore, contends that\nHusband paid her with her own funds.\n\n        The trial found that Husband did not pay Wife with her own money, and the\nevidence does not preponderate otherwise. For example, Husband testified at the hearing\non the motion that the Fidelity stock account from which he paid Wife the $18,250 was\nseparate from the Fidelity stock account at issue. Husband testified that the stock account\nreferenced by Wife‟s motion was a checking account, whereas the stock account from\nwhich he paid Wife the $18,250 was a vested stock account. Wife‟s half of the vested\nstock account remained untouched. The stock account statements alone are insufficient\nto meet Wife‟s burden by clear and convincing evidence. Accordingly, we conclude that\nthe trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Wife‟s Rule 60.02 motion.\n\n        In connection with the trial court‟s denial of Wife‟s Rule 60.02 motion, Wife\nargues that the trial court erred by precluding discovery related to the motion. Prior to\nfiling the Rule 60.02 motion, Wife scheduled a deposition of Husband. Husband filed a\nmotion for protective order pursuant to Tenn. R. Civ. P. 26.02 and 26.03 to prevent the\ndeposition, which the trial court granted.\n\n        Decisions concerning discovery issues “rest within the sound discretion of the trial\ncourt.” Benton v. Snyder, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2396081\"><a href=\"/opinion/2396081/benton-v-snyder/\"><span class=\"volume\">825</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">409</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 416 (Tenn. 1992). Therefore, we apply the\nabuse of discretion standard when reviewing a trial court‟s decision to grant or deny\ndiscovery requests. Johnson v. Nissan N. Am., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2183747\"><a href=\"/opinion/2183747/johnson-v-nissan-north-america-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">146</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">600</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 604 (Tenn. Ct. App.\n2004). The Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure favor discovery of any relevant\nevidence, unless the evidence is privileged or subject to protection. TENN. R. CIV. P.\n26.02(1); Duncan, 789 S.W.2d at 560. Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure 26.03 permits\na trial court to limit discovery; however, the party opposing discovery has the burden of\nproving with more than conclusory statements and generalizations that limitations are\nnecessary “„to protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or\nundue burden or expense.‟” Id. at 561 (quoting TENN. R. CIV. P. 26.03). If a party\nseeking to limit discovery fails to support its request with specific facts, a trial court\nshould deny the request. Id. Moreover, a trial court should “„balance one party‟s need\nfor information against the injury that would allegedly result if disclosure is compelled,‟”\nIn re NHC – Nashville Fire Litig., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1988633\"><a href=\"/opinion/1988633/in-re-nhc-nashville-fire-litigation/\"><span class=\"volume\">293</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">547</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 563 (Tenn.

The trial court agreed and granted Husband an order\nof protection precluding all discovery related to Wife‟s petition concerning the fraudulent\ntransfers. The evidence in the record does not preponderate against this decision. At the\nhearing on the motion, Husband‟s counsel informed the trial court there had been several\nrounds of discovery in the case and the stock account statements that were at issue had\nbeen produced previously. Moreover, the record reveals that Wife‟s counsel acquired the\nstock account statements prior to the hearing concerning Husband‟s withdrawals from the\nstock account, which is evidenced by Wife‟s counsel using those stock account\nstatements in support of the Rule 60.02 motion. We also note that Wife had the\nopportunity to cross-examine Husband about the alleged fraudulent transfers during the\nhearing on the Rule 60.02 motion. We find that Wife had sufficient opportunity to obtain\nthe information she sought through prior discovery and conclude the trial court did not\nabuse its discretion in denying Wife‟s request for additional discovery related to her Rule\n60.02 motion.\n\n                                        CONCLUSION\n\n       The judgment of the trial court is affirmed in all respects. Costs of appeal are\nassessed against appellant, Jamie Treadwell, for which execution may issue if necessary.\n\n\n                                                           _________________________\n                                                           ANDY D.

Wife filed a motion to alter or amend the award of alimony to remove the education and vocation requirements. The trial court denied the motion. Wife filed a motion pursuant to Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure 60.02 seeking relief from the trial court's order dividing the marital estate due to Husband's alleged fraudulent withdrawals from the parties' marital stock account. The trial court denied the motion. On appeal, Wife takes issue with the educational and vocational requirements the trial court placed on the spousal support award and with the trial court's division of the marital estate. She also appeals the trial court's denial of her Rule 60.02 motion. We affirm the trial court's judgment in all respects.",
