INTRODUCTION\n\n       Plaintiffs and appellants, Berthram Berry Nwene and Shelia Barnett, appeal from\n\nthe trial court’s granting of the motion for summary judgment of defendant and\n\nrespondent, City of Desert Hot Springs (the City).\n\n       The record on appeal can be characterized as “meager,” at best. From plaintiffs’\n\npleadings it would appear that plaintiffs’ daughter, age 13, was struck and killed by a hit-\n\nand-run motorist as she was walking to school on the dirt shoulder of Palm Drive.2\n\nPlaintiffs’ complaint appears to focus on the basic contention that Palm Drive was\n\ndangerous at the time of the accident, because there was no improved pedestrian sidewalk\n\nrunning parallel to and adjacent to the northbound lanes of Palm Drive.\n\n       At the motion for summary judgment, the City submitted a traffic collision report,\n\na declaration by a sergeant of the City’s police department, authenticating 11 photographs\n\n\n       1  The law firm of Graves & King and Harvey W. Wimer III substituted into this\ncase for the purpose of oral argument only.\n\n       2 From the evidence submitted on the City’s motion for summary judgment, it is\nunclear as to whether plaintiffs’ decedent was walking on the paved portion of the\nroadway, the dirt shoulder, or in an area well removed from the roadway. By way of the\nundisputed facts, however, plaintiffs’ decedent was walking on the dirt shoulder of the\nroadway.\n\n                                             2\n\fof the roadway and adjacent dirt shoulder and generally describing the roadway and\n\nweather conditions at the time of the accident, a declaration of the commander of the\n\npolice department describing average traffic volume and accident history for Palm Drive\n\nin the years preceding the accident, and the declaration of Timothy Wassil in which he\n\nattempts to lay the foundation for the application of the design immunity3 relative to a\n\n1999 plan and design of the roadway. In opposition, plaintiffs submitted the declaration\n\nof Alex Bias, a former mayor of the City. The declaration, in essence, sets forth that on\n\nnumerous occasions he expressed concerns about the dangerousness of Palm Drive\n\nbecause of the failure of the City to provide sidewalks for the protection of pedestrians.\n\n       Each side objected to the other’s evidence. As for the City’s evidence, the trial\n\ncourt sustained plaintiffs’ objections to the traffic collision report and the declaration of\n\nWassil with the attached plan and design. The City’s objections to the declaration of\n\nAlex Bias were sustained.\n\n       As a result of the court’s evidentiary rulings, the City’s evidence consisted of 11\n\nphotographs of the roadway and adjacent dirt shoulder with a general description of the\n\nroadway and an accident history of the roadway showing no similar accidents. Plaintiffs\n\nwere left with no opposing evidence. The court granted the City’s motion, finding no\n\ntriable issue of material fact as to the dangerousness of the roadway.\n\n\n\n\n       3\n       Government Code section 830.6. All further statutory references are to the\nGovernment Code unless otherwise indicated.\n\n                                               3\n\f       On appeal, plaintiffs make three arguments: (1) the City failed to meet its initial\n\nburden of production so as to shift the burden to plaintiffs to demonstrate the existence of\n\na triable issue of material fact; (2) plaintiffs’ evidence created a triable issue of material\n\nfact;4 and (3) the court erred in not granting a continuance of the hearing pursuant to\n\nCode of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (h).\n\n       We agree with plaintiffs that the City failed in its initial burden of production; as a\n\nresult, the burden never shifted to plaintiffs.5\n\n                                       II. ANALYSIS\n\nA. Dangerous Condition of Public Property\n\n       A governmental entity is liable for an injury caused by its property if at the time of\n\nthe injury: (1) the property was in a dangerous condition; (2) the injury was proximately\n\ncaused by the dangerous condition; (3) the dangerous condition created a reasonably\n\nforeseeable risk of the kind of injury which was incurred; and (4) the dangerous condition\n\nwas negligently or wrongfully created by an employee of the entity, or the entity had\n\n       4 Within this, plaintiffs argue that the court erred in sustaining the City’s\nobjections to the declaration of Bias. We do not address this argument because plaintiffs\nhave failed to properly seek review of these rulings. “It is appellant’s ‘burden on appeal\nto affirmatively challenge the trial court’s evidentiary ruling, and demonstrate the court’s\nerror.’ [Citation.] While plaintiffs on appeal explicitly state that the trial court erred in\nsustaining the objections to the . . . declaration, they fail ‘to identify the court’s\nevidentiary ruling as a distinct assignment of error, and there is no separate argument\nheading or analysis of the issue.’ [Citations.]” (Salas v. Department of Transportation\n(2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 1058, 1074.)\n\n       5 Because we agree with plaintiffs on their initial argument we do not address\nwhether the court erred in not granting plaintiffs a continuance under Code of Civil\nProcedure section 437c, subdivision (h).\n\n                                               4\n\factual or constructive knowledge of the dangerous condition a sufficient time ahead of\n\nthe injury so as to take measures to protect against the dangerous condition. (§ 835.)\n\n       For the property to be considered in a “dangerous condition,” it must create “a\n\nsubstantial (as distinguished from a minor, trivial or insignificant) risk of injury when\n\nsuch property . . . is used with due care in a manner in which it is reasonably foreseeable\n\nthat it will be used.” (§ 830, subd. (a).)\n\n       “The qualification that the property is dangerous only when used with due care\n\ndoes not require the plaintiff to prove due care on the part of the third party . . . involved\n\nin the plaintiff’s injury. Rather, the statute means that the condition is dangerous if it\n\ncreates a substantial risk of harm when used with due care by the public generally, as\n\ndistinguished from the particular person charged as concurrent tortfeasor.” (Murrell v.\n\nState of California ex rel. Dept. Pub. Wks. (1975) 47 Cal.App.3d 264, 267.) “[I]f the\n\ncondition of the property was such that it created a substantial risk of injury to a person\n\nusing the property with due care, an injured plaintiff is not required to prove that the\n\ndriver of the third party vehicle . . . was exercising due care at the time of the injury.\n\nThat is, the third party’s negligent use does not negate the existence of a dangerous\n\ncondition. . . . What we must determine therefore is whether in the abstract the factual\n\nsituation in the case at bench could be found by the finder of fact to have created a\n\ndangerous condition without regard to the specific conduct of [the third party driver] or\n\nthe plaintiff on this particular occasion.” (Mathews v. State of California ex rel. Dept. of\n\nTransportation (1978) 82 Cal.App.3d 116, 121; see Ducey v. Argo Sales Co. (1979) 25\n\n\n                                               5\n\fCal.3d 707, 718-719 [lack of median barrier created a substantial risk of injury even in\n\nthe absence of negligent conduct].)\n\n       ‘“Whether property is in a dangerous condition often presents a question of fact,\n\nbut summary judgment is appropriate if the trial or appellate court, viewing the evidence\n\nmost favorably to the plaintiff, determines that no reasonable person would conclude the\n\ncondition created a substantial risk of injury when such property is used with due care in\n\na manner which is reasonably foreseeable that it would be used. [Citations.]’ [Citation.]”\n\n(Sambrano v. City of San Diego (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 225, 234.)\n\nB. Summary Judgment\n\n       A trial court properly grants summary judgment when there are no triable issues of\n\nmaterial fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. (Code Civ.\n\nProc., § 437c, subd. (c).) “The purpose of the law of summary judgment is to provide\n\ncourts with a mechanism to cut through the parties’ pleadings in order to determine\n\nwhether, despite their allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.\n\n[Citation.]” (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.)\n\n       A moving party defendant is entitled to summary judgment if it establishes a\n\ncomplete defense to the plaintiff’s causes of action, or shows that one or more elements\n\nof each cause of action cannot be established. (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co., supra,\n\n25 Cal.4th at p. 849.) A moving party defendant bears the initial burden of production to\n\nmake a prima facie showing that no triable issue of material fact exists. Once the initial\n\nburden of production is met, the burden shifts to the responding party plaintiff to\n\n\n                                               6\n\fdemonstrate the existence of a triable issue of material fact. (Id. at pp. 850-851.) From\n\ncommencement to conclusion, the moving party defendant bears the burden of persuasion\n\nthat there is no triable issue of material fact and that the defendant is entitled to judgment\n\nas a matter of law. (Id. at p. 850.)\n\n       On appeal following the grant of summary judgment, we review the record de\n\nnovo, considering all of the evidence except that to which objections were made and\n\nsustained. (Yanowitz v. L’Oreal USA, Inc. (2005) 36 Cal.4th 1028, 1037.) “We liberally\n\nconstrue the evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve\n\ndoubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party.” (Ibid.)\n\n       “Our review of the summary judgment motion requires that we apply the same\n\nthree-step process required of the trial court. [Citation.] ‘First, we identify the issues\n\nframed by the pleadings since it is these allegations to which the motion must respond by\n\nestablishing a complete defense or otherwise showing there is no factual basis for relief\n\non any theory reasonably contemplated by the opponent’s pleading. [Citations.] [¶]\n\nSecondly, we determine whether the moving party’s showing has established facts which\n\nnegate the opponent’s claim and justify a judgment in movant’s favor. [Citations.] . . .\n\n[¶] . . . [T]he third and final step is to determine whether the opposition demonstrates the\n\nexistence of a triable, material factual issue. [Citation.]’ [Citation.]” (Todd v. Dow\n\n(1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 253, 258.)\n\n       “‘The purpose of a summary judgment proceeding is to permit a party to show that\n\nmaterial factual claims arising from the pleadings need not be tried because they are not\n\n\n                                              7\n\fin dispute.’ [Citation.] Materiality depends on the issues in the case, and what matters\n\nare at issue is determined by the pleadings, the rules of pleadings, and the substantive\n\nlaw. [Citation.] ‘The complaint measures the materiality of the facts tendered in a\n\ndefendant’s challenge to the plaintiff’s cause of action.’ [Citation.]” (Teselle v.\n\nMcLoughlin (2009) 173 Cal.App.4th 156, 172, italics added.)\n\n         Looking to plaintiffs’ complaint, the following is alleged:\n\n         “9. Defendant CITY OF DESERT HOT SPRINGS . . . owned, operated,\n\ndesigned, planned, engineered, maintained, inspected, repaired, and controlled the streets,\n\nroadways and sidewalks of the City of Desert Hot Springs, including but not limited to\n\nthe area of and/or immediately adjacent to Palm Drive at or near the intersection [of]\n\nCamino Campesino, Desert Hot Springs, California . . . . [¶] . . . [¶]\n\n         “15. On November 16, 2007, at approximately 7:00 a.m., while walking along the\n\ndirt shoulder of northbound Palm Drive near the intersection with Camino Campesino,\n\nDecedent was struck by a hit-and-run driver and was left on the side of the roadway to\n\ndie. . . .\n\n         “16. Defendants . . . failed to require installation of sidewalks . . . and failed to\n\ncontrol the streets, roadways and sidewalks . . . and . . . failed to provide proper\n\npedestrian walkways . . . and failed to provide any signs and/or warnings of the\n\nnarrowing road creating a trap . . . along Palm Drive at or near the intersection with\n\nCamino Campesino . . . thereby, creating dangerous conditions . . . exposing . . .\n\npedestrians to vehicle traffic. These dangerous conditions . . . proximately caused the\n\n\n                                                 8\n\fdeath of Decedent when she was struck by a vehicle operated by the hit-and-run motorist\n\n. . . . [¶] . . . [¶]\n\n        “18. . . . Defendants, and each of them, knew or should have known the subject\n\nroadway leading to the Dessert [sic] Middle School was unsafe for pedestrian traffic and\n\ndespite such knowledge failed to take proper precautions for the safety of the pedestrians\n\nand students including Plaintiff’s Decedent.\n\n        “[19]. Additionally, signs, warnings, safety crossing guards or other devices were\n\nnecessary to warn of these dangerous conditions which endangered the safe movement of\n\npedestrians, students . . . which would not be reasonably apparent to, and would not have\n\nbeen anticipated by, a person exercising due care.”\n\n        As framed by the above pleadings, plaintiffs are, in essence, contending that Palm\n\nDrive was dangerous because the City failed to provide sidewalks or safe pedestrian\n\nwalkways, failed to provide signs and/or warnings of a narrowing roadway, and that these\n\nconditions created a trap to pedestrians causing the decedent’s death.\n\n        The City is entitled to summary judgment if by way of its undisputed facts and\n\nsupporting evidence it establishes a complete defense to the above allegations or shows\n\nthat plaintiffs cannot prove one or more elements of their cause of action. (Eriksson v.\n\nNunnink (2011) 191 Cal.App.4th 826, 848 [Fourth Dist., Div. Two].)\n\n        Stated otherwise, the City is entitled to summary judgment if it establishes that the\n\nroadway and adjacent shoulder were not in a dangerous condition or a cause of the\n\n\n\n\n                                               9\n\fplaintiffs’ injury or, alternatively, that plaintiffs could not show that the roadway was in a\n\ndangerous condition or a cause of the injury.\n\n       “The defendant must demonstrate that under no hypothesis is there a material\n\nfactual issue requiring trial. [Citation.] If the defendant does not meet this burden, the\n\nmotion must be denied. Only if the defendant meets this burden does ‘the burden shift[]\n\nto plaintiff to show an issue of fact . . . .’ [Citation.]” (Anderson v. Metaclad Insulation\n\nCorp. (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 284, 289-290.) Here, the City did not meet its initial\n\nburden.\n\n       1. The City’s Undisputed Facts and Supporting Evidence Did Not Establish a\n\nComplete Defense to the Allegations of a Dangerous Condition of Public Property\n\n       First, the City did not, by way of its undisputed facts and supporting evidence,\n\naffirmatively establish that the roadway and adjacent shoulder were not in a dangerous\n\ncondition. The undisputed facts and evidence upon which the motion was granted were:\n\n       “1. In the morning of November 16, 2007, before 8:25 a.m., a fatal hit and run\n\naccident occurred on Palm Drive in Desert Hot Springs. The collision occurred between\n\nCamino Campesino and Avenue Aventura streets.”\n\n       “2. The area of Palm Drive where the accident occurred is straight, level and\n\npaved, with an unobstructed view in all directions.”\n\n       “3. The area of Palm Drive where the accident occurred is a four-lane roadway,\n\nwith two lanes of travel in each direction. There was a solid white line marking the edge\n\nof the roadway on the east side of Palm Drive, also known as a ‘fog line.’”\n\n\n                                             10\n\f       “4. Conditions the morning of the accident were clear, sunny and dry.”\n\n       “5. The accident occurred on the east side of Palm Drive, when a northbound\n\ndriver hit a pedestrian as she was walking in the dirt area adjacent to the road.”\n\n       “6. From May 2002 until November 16, 2007, there were no auto-pedestrian\n\naccidents in this area of Palm Drive.”\n\n       “7. From May 2002 until November 16, 2007, there were nine auto accidents (not\n\ninvolving pedestrians) in this area of Palm Drive, with varying causes.”\n\n       As support for these undisputed facts, the City submitted 11 photographs of the\n\nroadway which were attached to the declaration of Radames Gil, various traffic volume\n\ncounts taken over a space of years in conjunction with traffic collision reports, and a\n\nspread sheet depicting the number of accidents in the area.\n\n       Based on these undisputed facts and the evidence, the trial court granted summary\n\njudgment. As set forth in its statement of decision: “The court finds that [the City’s]\n\nUndisputed Facts numbers 1-4 are undisputed. . . . The photographs of the scene . . .\n\ndemonstrate that there are no vision obstructions which would prevent a motorist from\n\nseeing a pedestrian, the roadway was flat, straight and level, the roadway markings were\n\nin good condition, the fog line was clearly marked, and the roadway surface was in good\n\ncondition and free of any defects. . . . Based upon the court’s review of the photographs,\n\nand . . . [undisputed facts] nos. 1 through 4, the court finds that [the City] has presented\n\nsufficient evidence that ‘no reasonable person could find that Palm Drive in [the] area of\n\nthe incident constituted a dangerous condition’ so as to shift the burden to plaintiffs to\n\n\n                                              11\n\fdemonstrate that one or more triable issues of fact exist as to whether a dangerous\n\ncondition existed.” We believe this analysis oversimplifies the issue.\n\n       Under our facts the issue as to whether there exists a dangerous condition of the\n\nroadway and adjacent dirt shoulder is, to a large extent, the subject of expert testimony.\n\nCertainly, a court under section 830.2 can as a matter of law determine that a condition of\n\nproperty does not pose a substantial risk of injury as opposed to a trivial or insignificant\n\nrisk. (Fielder v. City of Glendale (1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 719, 732.)6 This is not our case,\n\nhowever. We do not believe, in this instance without the aid of expert testimony, that a\n\nlayperson can conclude, based on 11 photographs of a roadway, that a dangerous\n\ncondition of public property is not present as a matter of law. Carson v. Facilities\n\nDevelopment Co. (1984) 36 Cal.3d 830 (Carson) and Miller v. Los Angeles County Flood\n\nControl Dist. (1973) 8 Cal.3d 689 (Miller) are instructive.\n\n       In Carson, the plaintiffs sued the City of San Diego on a theory of a dangerous\n\ncondition of public property. The plaintiffs’ decedent, who was driving southbound on\n\nColusa Street, brought her vehicle to a stop behind the limit line at the intersection of\n\nColusa Street and Friars Road. It was her intention to turn left and proceed eastbound on\n\n       6  Section 830.2 provides: “A condition is not a dangerous condition within the\nmeaning of this chapter if the trial or appellate court, viewing the evidence most\nfavorably to the plaintiff, determines as a matter of law that the risk created by the\ncondition was of such a minor, trivial or insignificant nature in view of the surrounding\ncircumstances that no reasonable person would conclude that the condition created a\nsubstantial risk of injury when such property or adjacent property was used with due care\nin a manner in which it was reasonably foreseeable that it would be used.” As provided\nin the Law Revision Commission comment to section 830.2, the rule set forth in this code\nsection stems primarily from “cases involving dangerous conditions of sidewalks.”\n\n                                             12\n\fFriars Road. After bringing her vehicle to this initial stop, she proceeded closer to Friars\n\nRoad and stopped again. She then began her left turn; at this point, a westbound motorist\n\non Friars Road was approximately 50 feet from the plaintiffs’ decedent’s vehicle. The\n\ncars collided, causing the death of plaintiffs’ decedent. At the time of the accident there\n\nwas an address sign and trees on the northeast corner of Friars Road and Colusa Street.\n\n       As framed by the court: “One of the major issues addressed by the testimony was\n\nwhether and to what degree the address sign and the trees located along the north side of\n\nFriars Road obstructed the visibility of drivers stopped on Colusa Street at the north side\n\nof the intersection.” (Carson, supra, 36 Cal.3d at p. 838.) A nearby resident “testified\n\nthat the driver of a southbound car on Colusa Street did not have a clear view of\n\noncoming westbound traffic until the front of [the] car had moved past the stop sign limit\n\nline and was protruding slightly into Friars Road past its north curb. This evidence\n\nsuggested that the sign and/or shrubbery obstructed decedent’s view at both her stopping\n\npoints.” (Ibid.) The plaintiffs did not call an expert to testify on the issue of dangerous\n\ncondition of public property.\n\n       After presentation of the plaintiffs’ case, the trial court granted a nonsuit. In\n\nreversing the grant of nonsuit, the Supreme Court discussed the city’s argument that the\n\nplaintiffs needed expert testimony to establish the existence of a dangerous condition.\n\n“‘[T]he decisive consideration in determining the admissibility of expert opinion\n\nevidence is whether the subject of inquiry is one of such common knowledge that men of\n\nordinary education could reach a conclusion as intelligently as the [expert] witness or\n\n\n                                              13\n\fwhether, on the other hand, the matter is sufficiently beyond common experience that the\n\nopinion of an expert would assist the trier of fact.’ [Citations.] Expert opinion evidence\n\nis required in some circumstances. ‘If the matter in issue is one within the knowledge of\n\nexperts only and not within the common knowledge of laymen, it is necessary for the\n\nplaintiff to introduce expert opinion evidence in order to establish a prima facie case.’\n\n[Citations.]” (Carson, supra, 36 Cal.3d at p. 844; see McCoy v. Gustafson (2009) 180\n\nCal.App.4th 56, 99.) After discussing various cases, some in which expert testimony was\n\nnecessary and some in which it was not, the court in Carson concluded: “‘Evaluated by\n\nthese standards, proof of an obstruction at the Colusa Street-Friars Road intersection did\n\nnot require expert testimony. No special expertise was required to show that a driver\n\nlooking east down Friars Road would have difficulty seeing oncoming westbound traffic.\n\nAccordingly, it was error to grant a nonsuit for the City on this ground.” (Carson, supra,\n\nat p. 845, italics added.)\n\n       In accord with the above discussion, the court in Miller, supra, 8 Cal.3d 689 came\n\nto an opposite conclusion as to the necessity for expert opinion on the facts before it.\n\nThere, the plaintiffs purchased a home on Country Club Drive. Country Club Drive\n\nserved “both as a passageway for vehicular traffic and, in times of heavy rain, as a flood\n\ncontrol channel. . . . [T]he street was designed with 18-inch curbs in order to contain the\n\nrainwater that ran through the canyon to the valley below. [Plaintiffs’] home was situated\n\nat a 90-degree curve in this street, so that it lay in a direct line with the natural water\n\nrunoff. At the head of Country Club Drive [was] . . . a flood control structure known as\n\n\n                                               14\n\fthe Upper Debris Basin. The dam-like structure [was] built . . . in 1929 . . . [and] was\n\ndesigned to collect mud and debris which, in times of flood, might endanger lives and\n\nproperty in the city below.” (Id. at pp. 692-693.)\n\n       One year before the plaintiffs purchased their home and two years after it was\n\nconstructed, a house next door had been destroyed by flood waters. Approximately eight\n\nmonths before the incident in question a fire substantially denuded the hills above the\n\ndebris basin. On the day of the incident, “a rainstorm quickly filled the Upper Debris\n\nBasin. A wall of water, mud and debris overflowed, traveling down the canyon to the\n\ncurve in the street where the [plaintiffs’] home was located.” (Miller, supra, 8 Cal.3d at\n\np. 693.) The home was destroyed. One person died in the home and two were injured.\n\nDefendant Noble Manors was sued for negligence in the design and construction of the\n\nhome. At trial, the plaintiffs did not call an expert relative to the negligence of the\n\ndefendant. Following presentation of the plaintiffs’ case, the trial court granted a nonsuit\n\non the basis that “the evidence did not establish a prima facie showing of negligence.”\n\n(Id. at p. 694.)\n\n       On appeal, the plaintiffs argued that the trial court should have allowed the jury to\n\ndetermine from their own common experience whether Noble Manors acted reasonably.\n\n(Miller, supra, 8 Cal.3d at p. 702.) In finding that expert testimony was necessary, the\n\ncourt indicated that “[t]he average layman has neither training nor experience in the\n\nconstruction industry and ordinarily cannot determine whether a particular building has\n\n\n\n\n                                              15\n\fbeen built with the requisite skill and in accordance with the standards prescribed by law\n\nor prevailing in the industry.” (Id. at. pp. 702-703, fn. omitted, italics added.)\n\n       Applying these concepts to the present case, it is evident that evidence from an\n\nexpert was necessary for purposes of the City prima facially establishing that there\n\nexisted no triable issue of material fact as to whether the roadway and adjacent shoulder\n\nconstituted a dangerous condition of public property. In most cases, the proper and safe\n\ndesign of public roadways requires special expertise and is done in accordance with\n\ncriteria prevailing in the traffic engineering field.7 It is not simply a matter of laying\n\npavement on top of dirt and painting lines thereon. A prime example of this is the 1999\n\n“Street Improvement Plan Palm Drive,” which was not admitted into evidence on the\n\npresent motion.\n\n       Here, there is no evidence that the design, construction, and maintenance of the\n\nroadway and adjacent dirt shoulder conformed to accepted highway design criteria or\n\nguidelines, or that the roadway was safe for motorists and pedestrians. For example,\n\nplaintiffs contend that in the area of the accident the roadway narrowed. Here, there is no\n\nevidence of the lane widths and the fact that they conformed with the prevailing and\n\n       7  See California Highway Design Manual (July 1, 2008) (“The manual establishes\nuniform policies and procedures to carry out the highway design functions . . . .”) and\nAmerican Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, A Policy on\nGeometric Design of Highways and Streets. The court takes judicial notice of the\nexistence of these publications relative to their availability and use in the design and\nconstruction of roadways, signing of said roadways, and the design and construction of\npedestrian and bicycle pathways. (See City of Maywood v. Los Angeles Unified School\nDist. (2012) 208 Cal.App.4th 362, 417, fn 25 [“appropriate to take judicial notice of data\n‘not cited by the parties’ . . . .”].)\n\n                                              16\n\faccepted standards relative to the design of roadways. Further, and as exemplified by the\n\n1999 design of the roadway, which was not admitted into evidence, there was no\n\nevidence that the slope of the northbound lanes was in accordance with industry\n\nstandards. Lastly, there is no expert declaration relative to the fact that the roadway and\n\nadjacent shoulder were safe as it related to pedestrian traffic. Under the present facts, the\n\nsubmission of 11 innocuous photographs of a roadway simply does not meet the City’s\n\nburden of affirmatively demonstrating that no triable issue of material fact exists. Just as\n\na judge could look at photographs and surmise that a dangerous condition is not present,\n\na similarly situated judge could look at photographs and surmise that the drop-off\n\nbetween the paved portion of the roadway and the dirt shoulder is unsafe, thereby\n\ncontributing to a loss of control by the hit-and-run motorist. As in Miller, design of\n\nroadways is normally beyond the training and expertise of the average layperson. Under\n\nour facts, evidence that the design and construction of the roadway and adjacent shoulder\n\nwas within prevailing standards was necessary.\n\n       Here, there must be some expert evidence to support the conclusion that no triable\n\nissue of material fact exists as to the dangerousness of the public property. (See Kahn v.\n\nEast Side Union High School Dist. (2003) 31 Cal.4th 990, 1003 [“defendant must present\n\nevidence that would preclude a reasonable trier of fact from finding that it was more\n\nlikely than not that the material fact was true”], italics added.) The City failed to produce\n\nsuch evidence.\n\n\n\n\n                                             17\n\f       In arguing that plaintiffs, by way of their opposition, did not demonstrate a triable\n\nissue of material fact, the City cites to the trial court’s statement of decision wherein it\n\nexplained: “Plaintiffs proffered no admissible evidence of a dangerous condition of\n\npublic property. No expert opinions were submitted attacking the design of the roadway,\n\nsignage, excessive speed limit, poor visibility, condition of the roadway surface, lack of\n\nsight distance, lack of maintenance, elevation variances, prior accidents in the area or any\n\nunusual condition. . . .” (Italics added, underlining omitted.) The observation that\n\nplaintiffs submitted no admissible evidence by way of expert opinion misses the point.\n\nOn a motion for summary judgment, the initial burden of producing evidence rests with\n\nthe moving defendant not the plaintiff. Thus, it was incumbent on the City to initially\n\nsubmit expert evidence so as to shift the burden to plaintiffs.\n\n       Instructive is Crouse v. Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th\n\n1509. There, the defendant law firm moved for summary judgment on the basis that it\n\nwas not negligent. The defendant argued that the plaintiff’s failure to produce expert\n\nevidence in opposition to the motion allowed for the trial court’s entry of summary\n\njudgment. “[T]he burden-shifting provisions of [Code of Civil Procedure] section 437c,\n\nsubdivision (o)(2) do not operate until the moving party first produces affirmative\n\nevidence negating the duty’s existence, or evidence that [defendants] did not breach the\n\nduty of care. [Citation.] [Defendants] produced no expert testimony negating the duty of\n\ncare or breach of duty elements of [plaintiff’s] cause of action, and the motion for\n\nsummary judgment should have been denied even though [plaintiff] did not produce\n\n\n                                              18\n\fexpert testimony.” (Id. at pp. 1534-1535.) “[I]f the showing by the defendant does not\n\nsupport judgment in his favor, the burden does not shift to the plaintiff and the motion\n\nmust be denied without regard to plaintiff’s showing.” (Id. at p. 1534.)\n\n       Here, the City failed to affirmatively produce sufficient evidence to shift the\n\nburden of production to plaintiffs; as such, it did not demonstrate its entitlement to\n\nsummary judgment.\n\n       2. The City Did Not Establish That Plaintiffs Cannot Prove an Element of Their\n\nCause of Action\n\n       “As an alternative to the difficult task of negating an element, the defendant may\n\npresent evidence to ‘show[] that one or more elements of the cause of action . . . cannot\n\nbe established’ by the plaintiff. [Citations.] A defendant ‘has shown that the plaintiff\n\ncannot establish at least one element of the cause of action by showing that the plaintiff\n\ndoes not possess, and cannot reasonably obtain, needed evidence: The defendant must\n\nshow that the plaintiff does not possess needed evidence, because otherwise the plaintiff\n\nmight be able to establish the elements of the cause of action; the defendant must also\n\nshow that the plaintiff cannot reasonably obtain needed evidence, because the plaintiff\n\nmust be allowed a reasonable opportunity to oppose the motion . . . .’ [Citations.] A\n\ndefendant can satisfy its initial burden to show an absence of evidence through\n\n‘admissions by the plaintiff following extensive discovery to the effect that he has\n\ndiscovered nothing’ [citation], or through discovery responses that are factually devoid.\n\n[Citations.] [¶] Only after the defendant’s initial burden has been met does the burden\n\n\n                                             19\n\fshift to the plaintiff to demonstrate, by reference to specific facts, not just allegations in\n\nthe pleadings, there is a triable issue of material fact as to the cause of action.” (Chavez\n\nv. Glock, Inc. (2012) 207 Cal.App.4th 1283, 1301-1302, some italics in original, some\n\nitalics added.)\n\n       The City suggests at pages 25 and 26 of its brief that plaintiffs have no evidence to\n\nsupport the contention that any defect in the roadway was a cause of the injury. As\n\nstated: “‘An essential element of a cause of action for damages based on a dangerous\n\ncondition of public property is causation.’ [Citations.] Proof of causation is not the\n\nCity’s burden: ‘plaintiff must show that the dangerous condition in question was a\n\nsubstantial factor in causing his or her harm.’ [Citation.]” Within the context of a\n\nsummary judgment motion, the City’s argument is misplaced.\n\n       Initially, the case relied upon by the City for the proposition that it is plaintiffs’\n\nburden to show that the dangerous condition was a substantial factor in causing the harm\n\nis a case in which the trial court sustained a demurrer without leave to amend. The fact\n\npattern before that court was a situation in which the plaintiff’s decedent committed\n\nsuicide by jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge. The plaintiff contended that in the\n\nabsence of a “suicide barrier” the bridge was a dangerous condition. After discussing\n\nwell-settled law that the negligence or lack of due care exhibited by the plaintiff-user\n\ndoes not defeat a cause of action for dangerous condition, the court stated, as to the action\n\nbefore it: “We conclude reasonable minds will reach but one conclusion as to whether\n\nthe lack of a suicide barrier is a dangerous condition. By definition, persons who use the\n\n\n                                              20\n\fbridge to commit suicide are not using the bridge in a manner used by the general public\n\nexercising ordinary care.” (Milligan v. Golden Gate Bridge Highway & Transportation\n\nDist. (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1, 7.) As to causation, the court concluded: “Here,\n\nappellant does not allege that her daughter accidentally fell from the bridge while\n\nengaged in horseplay, while leaning over the railing to gain a better view, or while posing\n\nfor a photograph. Appellant admits that [the decedent] intentionally climbed over the\n\nexisting three-and-one-half-foot safety railing and jumped. Whatever defects may or may\n\nnot be present in the railing’s current design, they were not, as a matter of law, the cause\n\nof [the decedent’s] tragic death.” (Id. at p. 9.) On its facts, the case has no applicability\n\nto the present matter.\n\n       Further, on a motion for summary judgment, it is the defendant’s burden to\n\ndemonstrate that the plaintiff cannot prove causation. “[A] defendant cannot simply\n\n‘argue’ that a plaintiff lacks sufficient evidence to establish causation; the defendant must\n\nmake an affirmative ‘showing’ that the plaintiff cannot do so. While we acknowledge[]\n\nthat circumstantial evidence supporting a summary judgment motion ‘can consist of\n\n“factually devoid” discovery responses from which an absence of evidence can be\n\ninferred,’ we also note[] ‘that the burden should not shift without stringent review of the\n\ndirect, circumstantial and inferential evidence.’ [Citation.]” (Andrews v. Foster Wheeler\n\nLLC (2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 96, 103.)\n\n       None of the City’s 11 undisputed statements of fact set forth the notion plaintiffs\n\ncannot prove the element of causation. The City submitted no discovery responses to the\n\n\n                                              21\n\feffect that plaintiffs do not possess facts relative to this element and none of the\n\nsupporting declarations or exhibits go to the issue.\n\n       As such, we find that the City failed in its burden. The burden never shifted to\n\nplaintiffs. The motion should have been denied.\n\n       3. The City’s Cases\n\n       In its opposition to the motion and on appeal, the City relies primarily on four\n\ncases for the proposition that in automobile versus pedestrian cases “as a matter of law\n\nthat there [is] no substantial risk of [an] accident so long as the driver and pedestrian\n\nexercise[] due care.” As such, “the claim of a dangerous condition can be resolved as a\n\nmatter of law ‘if reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion.’”\n\n       The first of the four cases is Brenner v. City of El Cajon (2003) 113 Cal.App.4th\n\n434. There, the plaintiff was struck by a car as she was walking across Chase Avenue\n\nnear its intersection with Estes Street. (Id. at p. 436.) In the plaintiff’s second amended\n\ncomplaint, she alleged that the intersection was not safe for pedestrians because the city\n\n“‘failed to install traffic [regulatory] devices, traffic safety devices, traffic control\n\ndevices, signs or traffic signs, or take any steps to manage, control, or reduce the\n\nautomobile traffic flow or speed on Chase Avenue and/or . . . failed to take steps to\n\nprevent increased risk of harm and injury to the pedestrians . . . .’” (Id. at pp. 436, 438.)\n\n       In its demurrer, the defendant argued that it was immune from liability under\n\nsections 830.4 and 830.8 for its failure to install traffic (regulatory) devices, traffic safety\n\ndevices, traffic control devices, signs or traffic signs. In agreeing with this argument, the\n\n\n                                               22\n\fappellate court, in affirming the trial court’s granting of the demurrer without leave to\n\namend, stated: “[T]he Legislature has expressly provided that ‘[a] condition is not a\n\ndangerous condition within the meaning of this chapter merely because of the failure to\n\nprovide regulatory traffic control signals, stop signs, yield right-of-way signs, or speed\n\nrestriction signs, as described by the Vehicle Code, or distinctive roadway markings as\n\ndescribed in Section 21460 of the Vehicle Code.’ (§ 830.4.) Thus, the statutory scheme\n\nprecludes a plaintiff from imposing liability on a public entity for creating a dangerous\n\ncondition merely because it did not install the described traffic control devices.\n\n[Citations.] [¶] . . . Accordingly, if the facts pleaded by the plaintiff as a matter of law\n\ncannot support the finding of the existence of a dangerous condition within the meaning\n\nof the statutory scheme, a court may properly sustain a demurrer to the complaint.”\n\n(Brenner v. City of El Cajon, supra, 113 Cal.App.4th at pp. 439-440.) The case has little\n\nto no import on the present matter. Certainly, the case did involve an automobile versus\n\npedestrian accident and the court did hold that as a matter of law the plaintiff had not set\n\nforth a viable cause of action. The reason for the decision however was that based on the\n\nallegations of the plaintiff’s complaint, the governmental entity was immune from\n\nliability under section 830.4.8 This is not the situation that is before us. The allegations\n\nin the present complaint do not plead directly into a statutory immunity.\n\n       8  “A condition is not a dangerous condition within the meaning of this chapter\nmerely because of the failure to provide regulatory traffic control signals, stop signs,\nyield right-of-way signs, or speed restriction signs, as described by the Vehicle Code, or\ndistinctive roadway markings as described in Section 21460 of the Vehicle Code.”\n(§ 830.4.)\n\n                                              23\n\f         In Cerna v. City of Oakland (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 1340 (Cerna), an unlicensed\n\nmotorist struck six pedestrians as they walked in a marked crosswalk at an uncontrolled\n\nintersection. The roadway consisted of four lanes, two lanes in each direction, with a\n\ncenter divider. “Pedestrian crossing” was marked on the roadway. There was no\n\nevidence that the car slowed or swerved. The trial court granted the city’s summary\n\njudgment motion.\n\n         After acknowledging that a public entity may be liable for a dangerous condition\n\nof public property where the immediate cause of the plaintiff’s injury is a third party’s\n\nnegligent or illegal act, the court went on to analyze whether there were any physical\n\ncharacteristics of the property at issue that exposed the plaintiff to an increased risk of\n\ninjury from the third party’s negligent conduct. (Cerna, supra, 161 Cal.App.4th at p.\n\n1348.)\n\n         As described by the court: “Plaintiffs identified seven features that allegedly made\n\nthe City intersection dangerous: (1) the crosswalk was painted white, not yellow; (2)\n\nthere was no sign painted in the approaching roadway with the words ‘SLOW—\n\nSCHOOL XING’; (3) there was no traffic signal; (4) there were no crossing guards; (5)\n\nsigns warning of the presence of student pedestrians were either missing or in an\n\nincorrect position; (6) the crosswalk was not painted with diagonal or longitudinal lines;\n\nand (7) there were no blinking lights in the pavement along the parallel painted lines of\n\nthe crosswalk.” (Cerna, supra, 161 Cal.App.4th at p. 1348.)\n\n\n\n\n                                              24\n\f       In dispensing with all of the plaintiffs’ contentions, which were dependent on the\n\ncrosswalk being contiguous to a school (Veh. Code, § 21368), the court stated:\n\n“[P]laintiffs’ reliance on Vehicle Code section 21368—whether to create a mandatory\n\nduty or to demonstrate a dangerous condition—is misplaced because the statute is\n\ninapplicable. The intersection was not contiguous to school grounds and thus Vehicle\n\nCode [section] 21368 did not require demarcation in yellow paint and additional signage\n\nwarning of a school crossing. The location of the crosswalk relative to the School\n\ngrounds is not in dispute, and thus the applicability of Vehicle Code section 21368 is a\n\nquestion of law.” (Cerna, supra, 161 Cal.App.4th at p. 1350.)\n\n       Continuing, the court stated: “Plaintiffs’ reliance on other features of the\n\nintersection to prove that it was in a dangerous condition is similarly misplaced. The lack\n\nof a traffic signal at the intersection does not constitute proof of a dangerous condition.\n\n‘A condition is not . . . dangerous . . . merely because of the failure to provide regulatory\n\ntraffic control signals . . . .’ (Gov. Code, § 830.4; see Brenner v. City of El Cajon, supra,\n\n113 Cal.App.4th at p. 439.) Nor does the lack of crossing guards prove a dangerous\n\ncondition. The presence or absence of crossing guards is not a physical characteristic of\n\nthe intersection and thus not actionable as a dangerous condition. A lack of human\n\nsupervision and protection is not a deficiency in the physical characteristics of public\n\nproperty.” (Cerna, supra, 161 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1351-1352.)\n\n       As with Brenner, the court in Cerna determined that as a matter of law, the\n\nplaintiffs’ factual allegations were deficient. The court found that the crosswalk was not\n\n\n                                             25\n\fcontiguous to a school, thus the added protections provided for in the Vehicle Code were\n\nlegally inapplicable; the court further found that the plaintiffs’ additional allegations\n\nmoved directly into the area subsumed by Government Code section 830.4 (entity is\n\nimmune for its failure to provide regulatory traffic control signals). The only similarity\n\nCerna has with the present matter is that it involves an automobile versus pedestrian\n\naccident; its holding is otherwise inapplicable.\n\n       Salas v. Department of Transportation, supra, 198 Cal.App.4th 1058 involved a\n\nnighttime accident in which a pedestrian, while walking across State Route 12, was\n\nstruck and killed by a vehicle. At the time of the accident, the plaintiff’s decedent had\n\ndeviated from the crosswalk to examine a bag in the highway. In support of its motion\n\nfor summary judgment, the defendant submitted the declaration of Caltrans expert Ron\n\nNelson. Nelson declared that the roadway was straight and that there were no sight\n\nobstructions for either the motorist or the pedestrian. He further described the warning\n\nsigns adjacent to the roadway which notified motorists of the upcoming crosswalk. (Id.\n\nat pp. 1062-1063.) He declared that the signage met current California design standards\n\nand “that the accident location was not a dangerous condition of public property.” (Id. at\n\npp. 1064, 1066.)\n\n       As for the plaintiff’s evidence, the trial court sustained the defendant’s objections\n\nto all of the police reports of prior accidents in that the prior accidents were not\n\nsubstantially similar to the one at bar. The court further sustained objections to the\n\nentirety of the plaintiff’s expert’s declaration “except . . . to the innocuous statement that\n\n\n                                              26\n\fcrosswalks warn drivers of potential pedestrians.” (Salas v. Department of\n\nTransportation, supra, 198 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1072-1073, fn. omitted.)\n\n       The case is clearly inapposite. There, summary judgment was entered based on\n\nexpert testimony that the roadway complied with accepted design criteria and was not in\n\na dangerous condition at the time of the accident. That is not the case here. We have a\n\nsummary judgment granted on the basis of a judge viewing 11 photographs and coming\n\nto the conclusion, without the aid of expert evidence, that the roadway and adjacent\n\nshoulder were not in a dangerous condition.\n\n       In Sun v. City of Oakland (2008) 166 Cal.App.4th 1177, the plaintiffs’ decedent\n\nwas struck by a vehicle while walking in an unmarked crosswalk on a four-lane roadway\n\nduring the daytime. Previously, there had been a marked crosswalk in the area. A car in\n\nthe No. 1 lane stopped to allow the decedent to cross in front. A second car traveling in\n\nthe No. 1 lane changed to the No. 2 lane and struck the plaintiffs’ decedent as she\n\nemerged from in front of the stopped vehicle. The trial court granted the defendant’s\n\nmotion for summary judgment.\n\n       On appeal, the plaintiffs argued that the condition was dangerous because of the\n\nunmarked crosswalk. (Sun v. City of Oakland, supra, 166 Cal.App.4th at p. 1184.) In\n\nresponse, the city, in reliance on the Vehicle Code, submitted: “‘[T]he fact that the\n\ncrosswalk was not marked . . . is irrelevant, and certainly does not create a dangerous\n\ncondition. Under California law, a crosswalk is either marked or unmarked, and the\n\n\n\n\n                                            27\n\fobligations of drivers and pedestrians to exercise caution and to yield the right of way are\n\nlargely the same regardless of the markings or lack thereof.’” (Id. at pp. 1184-1185.)\n\n       The appellate court agreed. As stated: “There must be a defect in the physical\n\ncondition of the property and that defect must have some causal relationship to the third\n\nparty conduct that injures the plaintiff. [Citation.] ‘[P]ublic liability lies under\n\n[Government Code] section 835 only when a feature of the public property has\n\n“increased or intensified” the danger to users from third party conduct.’ [Citation.]”\n\n(Sun v. City of Oakland, supra, 166 Cal.App.4th at p. 1187.) As such, the appellate court\n\naffirmed the trial court’s granting of summary judgment.\n\n       Much of what was said in Sun could be said here. There is a total lack of evidence\n\nin our record as to whether the public property increased or intensified the danger to\n\npedestrians from third party drivers. The burden, however, on summary judgment rested\n\nwith the City to demonstrate that no triable issue of material fact exists as it relates to this\n\nissue. Without the aid of expert testimony, 11 photographs of the roadway simply do not\n\nmeet the City’s initial burden.\n\n       Further, at page 23 of its respondent’s brief, the City submits that “the Vehicle\n\nCode long has contemplated that pedestrians will walk along roadways without a\n\nsidewalk. [Plaintiffs] submitted no law of any kind – administrative, judicial or\n\notherwise – to suggest the installation of a sidewalk is legally mandated, and that its\n\nabsence alone renders a public entity liable for a dangerous condition under the\n\nGovernment Code.” The argument misses the point; simply because no law mandates a\n\n\n                                              28\n\fpedestrian walkway or some other installation segregating vehicle and pedestrian traffic,\n\ndoes not mean that the area of roadway is not in a dangerous condition, within the\n\nmeaning of the Government Code.9\n\n                                   III.

INTRODUCTION\n\n       Plaintiffs and appellants, Berthram Berry Nwene and Shelia Barnett, appeal from\n\nthe trial court’s granting of the motion for summary judgment of defendant and\n\nrespondent, City of Desert Hot Springs (the City).\n\n       The record on appeal can be characterized as “meager,” at best. From plaintiffs’\n\npleadings it would appear that plaintiffs’ daughter, age 13, was struck and killed by a hit-\n\nand-run motorist as she was walking to school on the dirt shoulder of Palm Drive.2\n\nPlaintiffs’ complaint appears to focus on the basic contention that Palm Drive was\n\ndangerous at the time of the accident, because there was no improved pedestrian sidewalk\n\nrunning parallel to and adjacent to the northbound lanes of Palm Drive.\n\n       At the motion for summary judgment, the City submitted a traffic collision report,\n\na declaration by a sergeant of the City’s police department, authenticating 11 photographs\n\n\n       1  The law firm of Graves & King and Harvey W. Wimer III substituted into this\ncase for the purpose of oral argument only.\n\n       2 From the evidence submitted on the City’s motion for summary judgment, it is\nunclear as to whether plaintiffs’ decedent was walking on the paved portion of the\nroadway, the dirt shoulder, or in an area well removed from the roadway. By way of the\nundisputed facts, however, plaintiffs’ decedent was walking on the dirt shoulder of the\nroadway.\n\n                                             2\n\fof the roadway and adjacent dirt shoulder and generally describing the roadway and\n\nweather conditions at the time of the accident, a declaration of the commander of the\n\npolice department describing average traffic volume and accident history for Palm Drive\n\nin the years preceding the accident, and the declaration of Timothy Wassil in which he\n\nattempts to lay the foundation for the application of the design immunity3 relative to a\n\n1999 plan and design of the roadway. In opposition, plaintiffs submitted the declaration\n\nof Alex Bias, a former mayor of the City. The declaration, in essence, sets forth that on\n\nnumerous occasions he expressed concerns about the dangerousness of Palm Drive\n\nbecause of the failure of the City to provide sidewalks for the protection of pedestrians.\n\n       Each side objected to the other’s evidence. As for the City’s evidence, the trial\n\ncourt sustained plaintiffs’ objections to the traffic collision report and the declaration of\n\nWassil with the attached plan and design. The City’s objections to the declaration of\n\nAlex Bias were sustained.\n\n       As a result of the court’s evidentiary rulings, the City’s evidence consisted of 11\n\nphotographs of the roadway and adjacent dirt shoulder with a general description of the\n\nroadway and an accident history of the roadway showing no similar accidents. Plaintiffs\n\nwere left with no opposing evidence. The court granted the City’s motion, finding no\n\ntriable issue of material fact as to the dangerousness of the roadway.\n\n\n\n\n       3\n       Government Code section 830.6. All further statutory references are to the\nGovernment Code unless otherwise indicated.\n\n                                               3\n\f       On appeal, plaintiffs make three arguments: (1) the City failed to meet its initial\n\nburden of production so as to shift the burden to plaintiffs to demonstrate the existence of\n\na triable issue of material fact; (2) plaintiffs’ evidence created a triable issue of material\n\nfact;4 and (3) the court erred in not granting a continuance of the hearing pursuant to\n\nCode of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (h).\n\n       We agree with plaintiffs that the City failed in its initial burden of production; as a\n\nresult, the burden never shifted to plaintiffs.5\n\n                                       II. ANALYSIS\n\nA. Dangerous Condition of Public Property\n\n       A governmental entity is liable for an injury caused by its property if at the time of\n\nthe injury: (1) the property was in a dangerous condition; (2) the injury was proximately\n\ncaused by the dangerous condition; (3) the dangerous condition created a reasonably\n\nforeseeable risk of the kind of injury which was incurred; and (4) the dangerous condition\n\nwas negligently or wrongfully created by an employee of the entity, or the entity had\n\n       4 Within this, plaintiffs argue that the court erred in sustaining the City’s\nobjections to the declaration of Bias. We do not address this argument because plaintiffs\nhave failed to properly seek review of these rulings. “It is appellant’s ‘burden on appeal\nto affirmatively challenge the trial court’s evidentiary ruling, and demonstrate the court’s\nerror.’ [Citation.] While plaintiffs on appeal explicitly state that the trial court erred in\nsustaining the objections to the . . . declaration, they fail ‘to identify the court’s\nevidentiary ruling as a distinct assignment of error, and there is no separate argument\nheading or analysis of the issue.’ [Citations.]” (Salas v. Department of Transportation\n(2011) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">198</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1058</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1074.)\n\n       5 Because we agree with plaintiffs on their initial argument we do not address\nwhether the court erred in not granting plaintiffs a continuance under Code of Civil\nProcedure section 437c, subdivision (h).\n\n                                               4\n\factual or constructive knowledge of the dangerous condition a sufficient time ahead of\n\nthe injury so as to take measures to protect against the dangerous condition. (§ 835.)\n\n       For the property to be considered in a “dangerous condition,” it must create “a\n\nsubstantial (as distinguished from a minor, trivial or insignificant) risk of injury when\n\nsuch property . . . is used with due care in a manner in which it is reasonably foreseeable\n\nthat it will be used.” (§ 830, subd. (a).)\n\n       “The qualification that the property is dangerous only when used with due care\n\ndoes not require the plaintiff to prove due care on the part of the third party . . . involved\n\nin the plaintiff’s injury. Rather, the statute means that the condition is dangerous if it\n\ncreates a substantial risk of harm when used with due care by the public generally, as\n\ndistinguished from the particular person charged as concurrent tortfeasor.” (Murrell v.\n\nState of California ex rel.

What we must determine therefore is whether in the abstract the factual\n\nsituation in the case at bench could be found by the finder of fact to have created a\n\ndangerous condition without regard to the specific conduct of [the third party driver] or\n\nthe plaintiff on this particular occasion.” (Mathews v.

Summary Judgment\n\n       A trial court properly grants summary judgment when there are no triable issues of\n\nmaterial fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. (Code Civ.\n\nProc., § 437c, subd. (c).) “The purpose of the law of summary judgment is to provide\n\ncourts with a mechanism to cut through the parties’ pleadings in order to determine\n\nwhether, despite their allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.\n\n[Citation.]” (Aguilar v.

(Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co., supra,\n\n25 Cal.4th at p. 849.) A moving party defendant bears the initial burden of production to\n\nmake a prima facie showing that no triable issue of material fact exists. Once the initial\n\nburden of production is met, the burden shifts to the responding party plaintiff to\n\n\n                                               6\n\fdemonstrate the existence of a triable issue of material fact. (Id. at pp. 850-851.) From\n\ncommencement to conclusion, the moving party defendant bears the burden of persuasion\n\nthat there is no triable issue of material fact and that the defendant is entitled to judgment\n\nas a matter of law. (Id. at p. 850.)\n\n       On appeal following the grant of summary judgment, we review the record de\n\nnovo, considering all of the evidence except that to which objections were made and\n\nsustained.

The City’s Undisputed Facts and Supporting Evidence Did Not Establish a\n\nComplete Defense to the Allegations of a Dangerous Condition of Public Property\n\n       First, the City did not, by way of its undisputed facts and supporting evidence,\n\naffirmatively establish that the roadway and adjacent shoulder were not in a dangerous\n\ncondition. The undisputed facts and evidence upon which the motion was granted were:\n\n       “1. In the morning of November 16, 2007, before 8:25 a.m., a fatal hit and run\n\naccident occurred on Palm Drive in Desert Hot Springs. The collision occurred between\n\nCamino Campesino and Avenue Aventura streets.”\n\n       “2. The area of Palm Drive where the accident occurred is straight, level and\n\npaved, with an unobstructed view in all directions.”\n\n       “3. The area of Palm Drive where the accident occurred is a four-lane roadway,\n\nwith two lanes of travel in each direction. There was a solid white line marking the edge\n\nof the roadway on the east side of Palm Drive, also known as a ‘fog line.’”\n\n\n                                             10\n\f       “4.

From May 2002 until November 16, 2007, there were no auto-pedestrian\n\naccidents in this area of Palm Drive.”\n\n       “7. From May 2002 until November 16, 2007, there were nine auto accidents (not\n\ninvolving pedestrians) in this area of Palm Drive, with varying causes.”\n\n       As support for these undisputed facts, the City submitted 11 photographs of the\n\nroadway which were attached to the declaration of Radames Gil, various traffic volume\n\ncounts taken over a space of years in conjunction with traffic collision reports, and a\n\nspread sheet depicting the number of accidents in the area.\n\n       Based on these undisputed facts and the evidence, the trial court granted summary\n\njudgment.

The plaintiffs’ decedent, who was driving southbound on\n\nColusa Street, brought her vehicle to a stop behind the limit line at the intersection of\n\nColusa Street and Friars Road. It was her intention to turn left and proceed eastbound on\n\n       6  Section 830.2 provides: “A condition is not a dangerous condition within the\nmeaning of this chapter if the trial or appellate court, viewing the evidence most\nfavorably to the plaintiff, determines as a matter of law that the risk created by the\ncondition was of such a minor, trivial or insignificant nature in view of the surrounding\ncircumstances that no reasonable person would conclude that the condition created a\nsubstantial risk of injury when such property or adjacent property was used with due care\nin a manner in which it was reasonably foreseeable that it would be used.” As provided\nin the Law Revision Commission comment to section 830.2, the rule set forth in this code\nsection stems primarily from “cases involving dangerous conditions of sidewalks.”\n\n                                             12\n\fFriars Road. After bringing her vehicle to this initial stop, she proceeded closer to Friars\n\nRoad and stopped again. She then began her left turn; at this point, a westbound motorist\n\non Friars Road was approximately 50 feet from the plaintiffs’ decedent’s vehicle. The\n\ncars collided, causing the death of plaintiffs’ decedent. At the time of the accident there\n\nwas an address sign and trees on the northeast corner of Friars Road and Colusa Street.\n\n       As framed by the court: “One of the major issues addressed by the testimony was\n\nwhether and to what degree the address sign and the trees located along the north side of\n\nFriars Road obstructed the visibility of drivers stopped on Colusa Street at the north side\n\nof the intersection.” (Carson, supra, 36 Cal.3d at p. 838.) A nearby resident “testified\n\nthat the driver of a southbound car on Colusa Street did not have a clear view of\n\noncoming westbound traffic until the front of [the] car had moved past the stop sign limit\n\nline and was protruding slightly into Friars Road past its north curb. This evidence\n\nsuggested that the sign and/or shrubbery obstructed decedent’s view at both her stopping\n\npoints.” (Ibid.) The plaintiffs did not call an expert to testify on the issue of dangerous\n\ncondition of public property.\n\n       After presentation of the plaintiffs’ case, the trial court granted a nonsuit. In\n\nreversing the grant of nonsuit, the Supreme Court discussed the city’s argument that the\n\nplaintiffs needed expert testimony to establish the existence of a dangerous condition.\n\n“‘[T]he decisive consideration in determining the admissibility of expert opinion\n\nevidence is whether the subject of inquiry is one of such common knowledge that men of\n\nordinary education could reach a conclusion as intelligently as the [expert] witness or\n\n\n                                              13\n\fwhether, on the other hand, the matter is sufficiently beyond common experience that the\n\nopinion of an expert would assist the trier of fact.’ [Citations.] Expert opinion evidence\n\nis required in some circumstances. ‘If the matter in issue is one within the knowledge of\n\nexperts only and not within the common knowledge of laymen, it is necessary for the\n\nplaintiff to introduce expert opinion evidence in order to establish a prima facie case.’\n\n[Citations.]” (Carson, supra, 36 Cal.3d at p. 844; see McCoy v. Gustafson (2009) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2255931\"><a href=\"/opinion/2255931/mccoy-v-gustafson/\"><span class=\"volume\">180</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 99.) After discussing various cases, some in which expert testimony was\n\nnecessary and some in which it was not, the court in Carson concluded: “‘Evaluated by\n\nthese standards, proof of an obstruction at the Colusa Street-Friars Road intersection did\n\nnot require expert testimony. No special expertise was required to show that a driver\n\nlooking east down Friars Road would have difficulty seeing oncoming westbound traffic.\n\nAccordingly, it was error to grant a nonsuit for the City on this ground.” (Carson, supra,\n\nat p. 845, italics added.)\n\n       In accord with the above discussion, the court in Miller, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1445387\"><a href=\"/opinion/1445387/miller-v-los-angeles-county-flood-control-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">689</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> came\n\nto an opposite conclusion as to the necessity for expert opinion on the facts before it.\n\nThere, the plaintiffs purchased a home on Country Club Drive. Country Club Drive\n\nserved “both as a passageway for vehicular traffic and, in times of heavy rain, as a flood\n\ncontrol channel. . . . [T]he street was designed with 18-inch curbs in order to contain the\n\nrainwater that ran through the canyon to the valley below. [Plaintiffs’] home was situated\n\nat a 90-degree curve in this street, so that it lay in a direct line with the natural water\n\nrunoff. At the head of Country Club Drive [was] . . . a flood control structure known as\n\n\n                                               14\n\fthe Upper Debris Basin. The dam-like structure [was] built . . . in 1929 . . . [and] was\n\ndesigned to collect mud and debris which, in times of flood, might endanger lives and\n\nproperty in the city below.” (Id. at pp. 692-693.)\n\n       One year before the plaintiffs purchased their home and two years after it was\n\nconstructed, a house next door had been destroyed by flood waters. Approximately eight\n\nmonths before the incident in question a fire substantially denuded the hills above the\n\ndebris basin. On the day of the incident, “a rainstorm quickly filled the Upper Debris\n\nBasin. A wall of water, mud and debris overflowed, traveling down the canyon to the\n\ncurve in the street where the [plaintiffs’] home was located.” (Miller, supra, 8 Cal.3d at\n\np. 693.) The home was destroyed. One person died in the home and two were injured.\n\nDefendant Noble Manors was sued for negligence in the design and construction of the\n\nhome. At trial, the plaintiffs did not call an expert relative to the negligence of the\n\ndefendant. Following presentation of the plaintiffs’ case, the trial court granted a nonsuit\n\non the basis that “the evidence did not establish a prima facie showing of negligence.”\n\n(Id. at p. 694.)\n\n       On appeal, the plaintiffs argued that the trial court should have allowed the jury to\n\ndetermine from their own common experience whether Noble Manors acted reasonably.\n\n(Miller, supra, 8 Cal.3d at p. 702.) In finding that expert testimony was necessary, the\n\ncourt indicated that “[t]he average layman has neither training nor experience in the\n\nconstruction industry and ordinarily cannot determine whether a particular building has\n\n\n\n\n                                              15\n\fbeen built with the requisite skill and in accordance with the standards prescribed by law\n\nor prevailing in the industry.” (Id. at. pp. 702-703, fn. omitted, italics added.)\n\n       Applying these concepts to the present case, it is evident that evidence from an\n\nexpert was necessary for purposes of the City prima facially establishing that there\n\nexisted no triable issue of material fact as to whether the roadway and adjacent shoulder\n\nconstituted a dangerous condition of public property. In most cases, the proper and safe\n\ndesign of public roadways requires special expertise and is done in accordance with\n\ncriteria prevailing in the traffic engineering field.7 It is not simply a matter of laying\n\npavement on top of dirt and painting lines thereon. A prime example of this is the 1999\n\n“Street Improvement Plan Palm Drive,” which was not admitted into evidence on the\n\npresent motion.\n\n       Here, there is no evidence that the design, construction, and maintenance of the\n\nroadway and adjacent dirt shoulder conformed to accepted highway design criteria or\n\nguidelines, or that the roadway was safe for motorists and pedestrians. For example,\n\nplaintiffs contend that in the area of the accident the roadway narrowed. Here, there is no\n\nevidence of the lane widths and the fact that they conformed with the prevailing and\n\n       7  See California Highway Design Manual (July 1, 2008) (“The manual establishes\nuniform policies and procedures to carry out the highway design functions . . . .”) and\nAmerican Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, A Policy on\nGeometric Design of Highways and Streets. The court takes judicial notice of the\nexistence of these publications relative to their availability and use in the design and\nconstruction of roadways, signing of said roadways, and the design and construction of\npedestrian and bicycle pathways. (See City of Maywood v. Los Angeles Unified School\nDist. (2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">208</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Further, and as exemplified by the\n\n1999 design of the roadway, which was not admitted into evidence, there was no\n\nevidence that the slope of the northbound lanes was in accordance with industry\n\nstandards. Lastly, there is no expert declaration relative to the fact that the roadway and\n\nadjacent shoulder were safe as it related to pedestrian traffic. Under the present facts, the\n\nsubmission of 11 innocuous photographs of a roadway simply does not meet the City’s\n\nburden of affirmatively demonstrating that no triable issue of material fact exists. Just as\n\na judge could look at photographs and surmise that a dangerous condition is not present,\n\na similarly situated judge could look at photographs and surmise that the drop-off\n\nbetween the paved portion of the roadway and the dirt shoulder is unsafe, thereby\n\ncontributing to a loss of control by the hit-and-run motorist. As in Miller, design of\n\nroadways is normally beyond the training and expertise of the average layperson. Under\n\nour facts, evidence that the design and construction of the roadway and adjacent shoulder\n\nwas within prevailing standards was necessary.\n\n       Here, there must be some expert evidence to support the conclusion that no triable\n\nissue of material fact exists as to the dangerousness of the public property.

The defendant argued that the plaintiff’s failure to produce expert\n\nevidence in opposition to the motion allowed for the trial court’s entry of summary\n\njudgment. “[T]he burden-shifting provisions of [Code of Civil Procedure] section 437c,\n\nsubdivision (o)(2) do not operate until the moving party first produces affirmative\n\nevidence negating the duty’s existence, or evidence that [defendants] did not breach the\n\nduty of care. [Citation.] [Defendants] produced no expert testimony negating the duty of\n\ncare or breach of duty elements of [plaintiff’s] cause of action, and the motion for\n\nsummary judgment should have been denied even though [plaintiff] did not produce\n\n\n                                              18\n\fexpert testimony.” (Id. at pp. 1534-1535.) “[I]f the showing by the defendant does not\n\nsupport judgment in his favor, the burden does not shift to the plaintiff and the motion\n\nmust be denied without regard to plaintiff’s showing.” (Id. at p. 1534.)\n\n       Here, the City failed to affirmatively produce sufficient evidence to shift the\n\nburden of production to plaintiffs; as such, it did not demonstrate its entitlement to\n\nsummary judgment.\n\n       2. The City Did Not Establish That Plaintiffs Cannot Prove an Element of Their\n\nCause of Action\n\n       “As an alternative to the difficult task of negating an element, the defendant may\n\npresent evidence to ‘show[] that one or more elements of the cause of action . . . cannot\n\nbe established’ by the plaintiff. [Citations.] A defendant ‘has shown that the plaintiff\n\ncannot establish at least one element of the cause of action by showing that the plaintiff\n\ndoes not possess, and cannot reasonably obtain, needed evidence: The defendant must\n\nshow that the plaintiff does not possess needed evidence, because otherwise the plaintiff\n\nmight be able to establish the elements of the cause of action; the defendant must also\n\nshow that the plaintiff cannot reasonably obtain needed evidence, because the plaintiff\n\nmust be allowed a reasonable opportunity to oppose the motion . . . .’ [Citations.] A\n\ndefendant can satisfy its initial burden to show an absence of evidence through\n\n‘admissions by the plaintiff following extensive discovery to the effect that he has\n\ndiscovered nothing’ [citation], or through discovery responses that are factually devoid.\n\n[Citations.] [¶] Only after the defendant’s initial burden has been met does the burden\n\n\n                                             19\n\fshift to the plaintiff to demonstrate, by reference to specific facts, not just allegations in\n\nthe pleadings, there is a triable issue of material fact as to the cause of action.” (Chavez\n\nv.

As\n\nstated: “‘An essential element of a cause of action for damages based on a dangerous\n\ncondition of public property is causation.’ [Citations.] Proof of causation is not the\n\nCity’s burden: ‘plaintiff must show that the dangerous condition in question was a\n\nsubstantial factor in causing his or her harm.’ [Citation.]” Within the context of a\n\nsummary judgment motion, the City’s argument is misplaced.\n\n       Initially, the case relied upon by the City for the proposition that it is plaintiffs’\n\nburden to show that the dangerous condition was a substantial factor in causing the harm\n\nis a case in which the trial court sustained a demurrer without leave to amend. The fact\n\npattern before that court was a situation in which the plaintiff’s decedent committed\n\nsuicide by jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge. The plaintiff contended that in the\n\nabsence of a “suicide barrier” the bridge was a dangerous condition. After discussing\n\nwell-settled law that the negligence or lack of due care exhibited by the plaintiff-user\n\ndoes not defeat a cause of action for dangerous condition, the court stated, as to the action\n\nbefore it: “We conclude reasonable minds will reach but one conclusion as to whether\n\nthe lack of a suicide barrier is a dangerous condition. By definition, persons who use the\n\n\n                                              20\n\fbridge to commit suicide are not using the bridge in a manner used by the general public\n\nexercising ordinary care.” (Milligan v.

As to causation, the court concluded: “Here,\n\nappellant does not allege that her daughter accidentally fell from the bridge while\n\nengaged in horseplay, while leaning over the railing to gain a better view, or while posing\n\nfor a photograph. Appellant admits that [the decedent] intentionally climbed over the\n\nexisting three-and-one-half-foot safety railing and jumped. Whatever defects may or may\n\nnot be present in the railing’s current design, they were not, as a matter of law, the cause\n\nof [the decedent’s] tragic death.” (Id. at p. 9.) On its facts, the case has no applicability\n\nto the present matter.\n\n       Further, on a motion for summary judgment, it is the defendant’s burden to\n\ndemonstrate that the plaintiff cannot prove causation. “[A] defendant cannot simply\n\n‘argue’ that a plaintiff lacks sufficient evidence to establish causation; the defendant must\n\nmake an affirmative ‘showing’ that the plaintiff cannot do so. While we acknowledge[]\n\nthat circumstantial evidence supporting a summary judgment motion ‘can consist of\n\n“factually devoid” discovery responses from which an absence of evidence can be\n\ninferred,’ we also note[] ‘that the burden should not shift without stringent review of the\n\ndirect, circumstantial and inferential evidence.’ [Citation.]” (Andrews v. Foster Wheeler\n\nLLC (2006) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">138</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

The burden never shifted to\n\nplaintiffs. The motion should have been denied.\n\n       3. The City’s Cases\n\n       In its opposition to the motion and on appeal, the City relies primarily on four\n\ncases for the proposition that in automobile versus pedestrian cases “as a matter of law\n\nthat there [is] no substantial risk of [an] accident so long as the driver and pedestrian\n\nexercise[] due care.” As such, “the claim of a dangerous condition can be resolved as a\n\nmatter of law ‘if reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion.’”\n\n       The first of the four cases is Brenner v.

There, the plaintiff was struck by a car as she was walking across Chase Avenue\n\nnear its intersection with Estes Street. (Id. at p. 436.) In the plaintiff’s second amended\n\ncomplaint, she alleged that the intersection was not safe for pedestrians because the city\n\n“‘failed to install traffic [regulatory] devices, traffic safety devices, traffic control\n\ndevices, signs or traffic signs, or take any steps to manage, control, or reduce the\n\nautomobile traffic flow or speed on Chase Avenue and/or . . . failed to take steps to\n\nprevent increased risk of harm and injury to the pedestrians . . . .’” (Id. at pp. 436, 438.)\n\n       In its demurrer, the defendant argued that it was immune from liability under\n\nsections 830.4 and 830.8 for its failure to install traffic (regulatory) devices, traffic safety\n\ndevices, traffic control devices, signs or traffic signs. In agreeing with this argument, the\n\n\n                                               22\n\fappellate court, in affirming the trial court’s granting of the demurrer without leave to\n\namend, stated: “[T]he Legislature has expressly provided that ‘[a] condition is not a\n\ndangerous condition within the meaning of this chapter merely because of the failure to\n\nprovide regulatory traffic control signals, stop signs, yield right-of-way signs, or speed\n\nrestriction signs, as described by the Vehicle Code, or distinctive roadway markings as\n\ndescribed in Section 21460 of the Vehicle Code.’ (§ 830.4.) Thus, the statutory scheme\n\nprecludes a plaintiff from imposing liability on a public entity for creating a dangerous\n\ncondition merely because it did not install the described traffic control devices.\n\n[Citations.] [¶] . . . Accordingly, if the facts pleaded by the plaintiff as a matter of law\n\ncannot support the finding of the existence of a dangerous condition within the meaning\n\nof the statutory scheme, a court may properly sustain a demurrer to the complaint.”\n\n(Brenner v. City of El Cajon, supra, 113 Cal.App.4th at pp. 439-440.) The case has little\n\nto no import on the present matter. Certainly, the case did involve an automobile versus\n\npedestrian accident and the court did hold that as a matter of law the plaintiff had not set\n\nforth a viable cause of action. The reason for the decision however was that based on the\n\nallegations of the plaintiff’s complaint, the governmental entity was immune from\n\nliability under section 830.4.8 This is not the situation that is before us. The allegations\n\nin the present complaint do not plead directly into a statutory immunity.\n\n       8  “A condition is not a dangerous condition within the meaning of this chapter\nmerely because of the failure to provide regulatory traffic control signals, stop signs,\nyield right-of-way signs, or speed restriction signs, as described by the Vehicle Code, or\ndistinctive roadway markings as described in Section 21460 of the Vehicle Code.”\n(§ 830.4.)\n\n                                              23\n\f         In Cerna v.

(Cerna, supra, 161 Cal.App.4th at p.\n\n1348.)\n\n         As described by the court: “Plaintiffs identified seven features that allegedly made\n\nthe City intersection dangerous: (1) the crosswalk was painted white, not yellow; (2)\n\nthere was no sign painted in the approaching roadway with the words ‘SLOW—\n\nSCHOOL XING’; (3) there was no traffic signal; (4) there were no crossing guards; (5)\n\nsigns warning of the presence of student pedestrians were either missing or in an\n\nincorrect position; (6) the crosswalk was not painted with diagonal or longitudinal lines;\n\nand (7) there were no blinking lights in the pavement along the parallel painted lines of\n\nthe crosswalk.” (Cerna, supra, 161 Cal.App.4th at p. 1348.)\n\n\n\n\n                                              24\n\f       In dispensing with all of the plaintiffs’ contentions, which were dependent on the\n\ncrosswalk being contiguous to a school (Veh. Code, § 21368), the court stated:\n\n“[P]laintiffs’ reliance on Vehicle Code section 21368—whether to create a mandatory\n\nduty or to demonstrate a dangerous condition—is misplaced because the statute is\n\ninapplicable. The intersection was not contiguous to school grounds and thus Vehicle\n\nCode [section] 21368 did not require demarcation in yellow paint and additional signage\n\nwarning of a school crossing. The location of the crosswalk relative to the School\n\ngrounds is not in dispute, and thus the applicability of Vehicle Code section 21368 is a\n\nquestion of law.” (Cerna, supra, 161 Cal.App.4th at p. 1350.)\n\n       Continuing, the court stated: “Plaintiffs’ reliance on other features of the\n\nintersection to prove that it was in a dangerous condition is similarly misplaced. The lack\n\nof a traffic signal at the intersection does not constitute proof of a dangerous condition.\n\n‘A condition is not . . . dangerous . . . merely because of the failure to provide regulatory\n\ntraffic control signals . . . .’ (Gov. Code, § 830.4; see Brenner v. City of El Cajon, supra,\n\n113 Cal.App.4th at p. 439.) Nor does the lack of crossing guards prove a dangerous\n\ncondition. The presence or absence of crossing guards is not a physical characteristic of\n\nthe intersection and thus not actionable as a dangerous condition. A lack of human\n\nsupervision and protection is not a deficiency in the physical characteristics of public\n\nproperty.” (Cerna, supra, 161 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1351-1352.)\n\n       As with Brenner, the court in Cerna determined that as a matter of law, the\n\nplaintiffs’ factual allegations were deficient. The court found that the crosswalk was not\n\n\n                                             25\n\fcontiguous to a school, thus the added protections provided for in the Vehicle Code were\n\nlegally inapplicable; the court further found that the plaintiffs’ additional allegations\n\nmoved directly into the area subsumed by Government Code section 830.4 (entity is\n\nimmune for its failure to provide regulatory traffic control signals). The only similarity\n\nCerna has with the present matter is that it involves an automobile versus pedestrian\n\naccident; its holding is otherwise inapplicable.\n\n       Salas v. Department of Transportation, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">198</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1058</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> involved a\n\nnighttime accident in which a pedestrian, while walking across State Route 12, was\n\nstruck and killed by a vehicle. At the time of the accident, the plaintiff’s decedent had\n\ndeviated from the crosswalk to examine a bag in the highway. In support of its motion\n\nfor summary judgment, the defendant submitted the declaration of Caltrans expert Ron\n\nNelson. Nelson declared that the roadway was straight and that there were no sight\n\nobstructions for either the motorist or the pedestrian. He further described the warning\n\nsigns adjacent to the roadway which notified motorists of the upcoming crosswalk. (Id.\n\nat pp. 1062-1063.) He declared that the signage met current California design standards\n\nand “that the accident location was not a dangerous condition of public property.” (Id. at\n\npp. 1064, 1066.)\n\n       As for the plaintiff’s evidence, the trial court sustained the defendant’s objections\n\nto all of the police reports of prior accidents in that the prior accidents were not\n\nsubstantially similar to the one at bar. The court further sustained objections to the\n\nentirety of the plaintiff’s expert’s declaration “except . . . to the innocuous statement that\n\n\n                                              26\n\fcrosswalks warn drivers of potential pedestrians.” (Salas v. Department of\n\nTransportation, supra, 198 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1072-1073, fn. omitted.)\n\n       The case is clearly inapposite. There, summary judgment was entered based on\n\nexpert testimony that the roadway complied with accepted design criteria and was not in\n\na dangerous condition at the time of the accident. That is not the case here. We have a\n\nsummary judgment granted on the basis of a judge viewing 11 photographs and coming\n\nto the conclusion, without the aid of expert evidence, that the roadway and adjacent\n\nshoulder were not in a dangerous condition.\n\n       In Sun v. City of Oakland (2008) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2247178\"><a href=\"/opinion/2247178/sun-v-city-of-oakland/\"><span class=\"volume\">166</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1177</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, the plaintiffs’ decedent\n\nwas struck by a vehicle while walking in an unmarked crosswalk on a four-lane roadway\n\nduring the daytime. Previously, there had been a marked crosswalk in the area. A car in\n\nthe No. 1 lane stopped to allow the decedent to cross in front. A second car traveling in\n\nthe No. 1 lane changed to the No. 2 lane and struck the plaintiffs’ decedent as she\n\nemerged from in front of the stopped vehicle. The trial court granted the defendant’s\n\nmotion for summary judgment.\n\n       On appeal, the plaintiffs argued that the condition was dangerous because of the\n\nunmarked crosswalk. (Sun v. City of Oakland, supra, 166 Cal.App.4th at p. 1184.) In\n\nresponse, the city, in reliance on the Vehicle Code, submitted: “‘[T]he fact that the\n\ncrosswalk was not marked . . . is irrelevant, and certainly does not create a dangerous\n\ncondition. Under California law, a crosswalk is either marked or unmarked, and the\n\n\n\n\n                                            27\n\fobligations of drivers and pedestrians to exercise caution and to yield the right of way are\n\nlargely the same regardless of the markings or lack thereof.’” (Id. at pp. 1184-1185.)\n\n       The appellate court agreed. As stated: “There must be a defect in the physical\n\ncondition of the property and that defect must have some causal relationship to the third\n\nparty conduct that injures the plaintiff. [Citation.] ‘[P]ublic liability lies under\n\n[Government Code] section 835 only when a feature of the public property has\n\n“increased or intensified” the danger to users from third party conduct.’ [Citation.]”\n\n(Sun v. City of Oakland, supra, 166 Cal.App.4th at p. 1187.) As such, the appellate court\n\naffirmed the trial court’s granting of summary judgment.\n\n       Much of what was said in Sun could be said here. There is a total lack of evidence\n\nin our record as to whether the public property increased or intensified the danger to\n\npedestrians from third party drivers. The burden, however, on summary judgment rested\n\nwith the City to demonstrate that no triable issue of material fact exists as it relates to this\n\nissue. Without the aid of expert testimony, 11 photographs of the roadway simply do not\n\nmeet the City’s initial burden.\n\n       Further, at page 23 of its respondent’s brief, the City submits that “the Vehicle\n\nCode long has contemplated that pedestrians will walk along roadways without a\n\nsidewalk. [Plaintiffs] submitted no law of any kind – administrative, judicial or\n\notherwise – to suggest the installation of a sidewalk is legally mandated, and that its\n\nabsence alone renders a public entity liable for a dangerous condition under the\n\nGovernment Code.” The argument misses the point; simply because no law mandates a\n\n\n                                              28\n\fpedestrian walkway or some other installation segregating vehicle and pedestrian traffic,\n\ndoes not mean that the area of roadway is not in a dangerous condition, within the\n\nmeaning of the Government Code.9\n\n                                   III.
