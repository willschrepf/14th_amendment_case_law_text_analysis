We grant Taylor’s motion to proceed in forma\npauperis, and leave the fee-collection details to the district court. See Henderson v.\nNorris, 129 F.3d 481, 483-85 (8th Cir. 1997) (per curiam). We affirm in part and\nreverse in part.\n\n       As to the dismissal of Taylor’s claims against defendants Botkins and Glore,\nthe district court was correct in dismissing the official-capacity claims against both\ndefendants, and the individual-capacity claims alleging Taylor was denied due\nprocess when he was placed in administrative segregation and when his property was\ndamaged or destroyed. See Orr v. Larkins, 610 F.3d 1032, 1034 (8th Cir. 2010) (per\ncuriam) (to prevail on Fourteenth Amendment due process claim, plaintiff must allege\nhe was deprived of liberty interest; to show protected liberty interest, plaintiff must\nshow conditions imposed were atypical or significant hardship; administrative\nsegregation is not in itself atypical or significant hardship); Clark v. Kan. City Mo.\nSch. Dist., 375 F.3d 698, 702 (8th Cir. 2004) (due process is not violated by property\ndeprivation if state employee’s acts were unauthorized and random, and meaningful\npostdeprivation remedy exists; Missouri provides meaningful postdeprivation remedy\nfor property loss with replevin action); Wilson v. Johnston, 68 Fed. Appx. 761, 761\n(8th Cir. 2003) (unpublished per curiam) (§ 1915(e)(2)(B) dismissal for frivolousness\nis reviewed for abuse of discretion); Moore v. Sims, 200 F.3d 1170, 1171 (8th Cir.\n2000) (per curiam) (§ 1915(e)(2)(B) dismissal for failure to state claim is reviewed\nde novo). We also agree that Taylor did not state a retaliation claim against Glore,\nbecause he did not allege facts suggesting Glore allowed Taylor’s property to be\ndamaged because Taylor had filed lawsuits. See Revels v. Vincenz, 382 F.3d 870,\n876 (8th Cir. 2004) (for First Amendment retaliation claim, plaintiff must show\nadverse action was motivated at least in part by exercise of protected activity).\n\n                                         -2-\n\f       We believe, however, that Taylor sufficiently stated a nonfrivolous First\nAmendment retaliation claim against Botkins. Taylor alleged that Botkins--who\nsupervised Taylor in his job at the prison law library--confronted him over a pending\nlawsuit which she believed he had brought against her, and that six days later she had\nhim placed in administrative segregation on a trumped-up allegation (for which he\nwas never formally charged or disciplined). See Zutz v. Nelson, 601 F.3d 842, 848-\n49 (8th Cir. 2010) (for First Amendment retaliation claim, plaintiff must “plead that\nhe/she ‘engaged in protected activity and that defendants, to retaliate for the protected\nactivity, took adverse action against [them] that would chill a person of ordinary\nfirmness from engaging in that activity’” (alteration in original) (quoting Lewis v.\nJacks, 486 F.3d 1025, 1028 (8th Cir. 2007))); see also Beaulieu v. Ludeman, 690 F.3d\n1017, 1025 (8th Cir. 2012) (filing of inmate lawsuit is protected First Amendment\nactivity); cf. Smith v. Fairview Ridges Hosp., 625 F.3d 1076, 1087-88 (8th Cir. 2010)\n(temporal proximity between knowledge of protected activity and adverse action may\nalone support causality in employment-retaliation case when proximity is very close).\n\n      As to the remaining defendants, the district court did not abuse its discretion\nby dropping them from the lawsuit, because the allegations against them did not arise\nfrom the same series of transactions and occurrences as those against Botkins and\nGlore. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 20(a)(2) (defining when permissive joinder is proper); Fed.\nR. Civ. P. 21 (court may drop party at any time on just terms for misjoinder); Bailey\nv. Bayer CropScience L.P., 563 F.3d 302, 308-09 (8th Cir. 2009) (standard of\nreview).\n\n      We therefore reverse and remand as to the First Amendment retaliation claim\nagainst Botkins. The judgment is otherwise affirmed.\n                      ______________________________\n\n\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\f",
