O’Donovan sued Weingarten for\n\nunlawful employment practices under the Texas Commission on Human Rights\n\nAct (TCHRA), alleging that the reduction in force was pretextual and her\n\ntermination was instead based on age and disability discrimination. Weingarten\n\nmoved for summary judgment on both claims. The trial court granted summary\n\njudgment, and O’Donovan appeals. Finding that O’Donovan failed to raise a fact\n\nissue to rebut Weingarten’s legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for her\n\ntermination, we affirm.\n\n                                   Background\n\n      O’Donovan first worked for Weingarten as a part-time employee in the early\n\n1980s. She voluntarily left her employment in 1985, but returned to Weingarten in\n\n1997 to work as a part-time assistant to Victoria Brown, Weingarten’s Director of\n\nLand Sales and Acquisitions. Brown and O’Donovan had worked together during\n\nO’Donovan’s earlier stint at the company, and they had maintained a friendship\n\nthrough the intervening years.\n\n      Brown was aware that O’Donovan had three young children and that one\n\nchild, in particular, had special needs that at times would require O’Donovan to be\n\nabsent during working hours. All three of O’Donovan’s children require regular\n\nmedical and psychiatric treatment, and one attended a special school.\n\n\n\n\n                                         2\n\f      In 2002, Brown promoted O’Donovan to coordinator of thoroughfare\n\nprojects, a full-time position. Brown offered O’Donovan some flexibility with her\n\nwork schedule so that she could attend to her children’s medical and personal\n\nneeds. O’Donovan performed her job well, and, in 2004, she was promoted to the\n\nfull-time position of government compliance representative.         Through 2007,\n\nO’Donovan continued to receive satisfactory performance reviews as well as\n\nannual salary increases and bonuses.\n\n      Meanwhile, in June 2006, Weingarten promoted administrative assistant\n\nAlison   Spencer to the position of assistant governmental               compliance\n\nrepresentative. A year later, Spencer was promoted to governmental compliance\n\nrepresentative, the same position as O’Donovan and one of two such positions in\n\nthe company at that time.\n\n      A few days after Spencer’s promotion, O’Donovan suffered an injury that\n\nrequired her to take short-term disability leave. When O’Donovan returned to\n\nwork three months later, in September 2007, the frequency of her absences from\n\nwork increased significantly.       Her 2007 performance review shows that\n\nO’Donovan was following a plan to catch up on incomplete work assignments, and\n\nhad an overall performance rating of “meets expectations,” at the center of the five-\n\npoint scale.\n\n\n\n\n                                         3\n\f      By January 2008, O’Donovan’s absences during working hours had\n\nincreased to the point that it affected her ability to complete her assignments\n\ntimely. At times, O’Donovan failed to clear the voicemail on her work cell phone;\n\nas a result, when she was away from the office, Brown was unable to leave her a\n\nmessage. O’Donovan attributed her absences to her own medical appointments,\n\npsychologist and psychiatrist appointments, personal issues, and her children’s\n\nregular medical, dental, and orthodontic appointments, as well as their school and\n\nextra-curricular activities.\n\n      O’Donovan’s February 2009 performance review stated that “O’Donovan’s\n\nwork product is generally good, and her job knowledge is excellent,” and also\n\nnoted that she “is able to think quickly on her feet and has a thorough\n\nunderstanding of her job and our processes.” Her frequent and ongoing absences,\n\nhowever, led to a performance rating of “needs improvement,” the second-lowest\n\nrating on the five-point scale. The review explained that “[d]ue to [O’Donovan’s]\n\nabsences [Brown has] been unable to assign [O’Donovan] projects that she would\n\notherwise be responsible for handling. At this time [O’Donovan] is not producing\n\nan acceptable amount of work for the position.” The review also noted that\n\nO’Donovan’s absences had become a burden on the department and created morale\n\nissues within the team.\n\n\n\n\n                                        4\n\f      As a result of the performance rating, the company provided O’Donovan\n\nwith a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP). The PIP required O’Donovan to be\n\npresent in the office for a minimum of forty hours during the work week with a\n\nreasonable allowance for occasional absences. It explained that O’Donovan was\n\nexpected to schedule multiple personal appointments in the same day to avoid\n\nmissing hours on multiple days and to take a vacation day when the appointments\n\nkept her out of the office for more than three hours. The PIP also required\n\nO’Donovan to provide time logs detailing the number of hours per week she\n\nmissed due to personal appointments, including specific arrival and departure\n\ntimes, and provide advance notice of all appointments.         In addition, Brown\n\nrequired O’Donovan to calendar all of her potential appointments so that Brown\n\ncould keep track of where O’Donovan might be if she were out of the office.\n\n      The PIP compliance period did not go smoothly. O’Donovan’s absences\n\ndecreased, but in July, she failed to attend a regular Monday morning meeting as a\n\nresult of misreading an email. Later in July, Brown documented O’Donovan’s\n\n“defensive, combative, [and] insubordinate behavior when O’Donovan refused to\n\nperform the job requested of her in the amount of time allotted causing a delay in a\n\nloan closing.” The amount of work she accomplished during the period compared\n\nunfavorably to the amount accomplished by Spencer.\n\n\n\n\n                                         5\n\f      In August 2009, Weingarten held an internal meeting to address the effect of\n\nthe overall decline in the economy on its acquisitions business.      The review\n\nrevealed that the number of acquisitions had dropped sharply. In contrast to the\n\nfifty-seven acquisitions the company made in the two-year period from 2005 to\n\n2007, Weingarten completed only two acquisitions in 2008 and had not acquired\n\nany property during 2009. As a result of these conditions, the company concluded\n\nthat it no longer needed two governmental compliance representatives to perform\n\nacquisition due diligence and decided to eliminate O’Donovan’s position.\n\n      Weingarten informed O’Donovan that it was terminating her employment\n\nbecause it was eliminating her job function as part of a reduction in force.\n\nWeingarten retained Spencer, who was less than forty years of age, to fill the\n\nremaining governmental compliance representative position.\n\n      Before bringing this lawsuit, O’Donovan filed a complaint with the Equal\n\nEmployment Opportunity Commission, claiming employment discrimination based\n\non her age. She also claimed disability discrimination based on her association\n\nwith her children.\n\n                                   Discussion\n\nSummary Judgment Standard of Review\n\n      An appellate court reviews de novo a trial court’s ruling on a summary\n\njudgment motion. Mann Frankfort Stein & Lipp Advisors, Inc. v. Fielding, 289\n\n                                        6\n\fS.W.3d 844, 848 (Tex. 2009). To succeed on a summary judgment motion under\n\nTexas Rule of Civil Procedure 166a(c), a movant must establish that there is no\n\ngenuine issue of material fact so that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter\n\nof law. TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(c); KPMG Peat Marwick v. Harrison Cnty. Hous. Fin.\n\nCorp., 988 S.W.2d 746, 748 (Tex. 1999).\n\n      To conclusively establish an essential element of the nonmovant’s claim, the\n\nmovant must show that reasonable minds could not differ as to the conclusion to be\n\ndrawn from the evidence. City of Keller v. Wilson, 168 S.W.3d 802, 816 (Tex.\n\n2005). The evidence is reviewed in the light most favorable to the non-movant,\n\ncrediting favorable evidence if reasonable jurors could and disregarding contrary\n\nevidence unless reasonable jurors could not. Fielding, 289 S.W.3d at 848 (citing\n\nCity of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 827). When, as here, a trial court’s order granting\n\nsummary judgment does not specify the grounds relied upon, we affirm the\n\nsummary judgment if any of the summary judgment grounds is meritorious. FM\n\nProps. Operating Co. v. City of Austin, 22 S.W.3d 868, 872–73 (Tex. 2000).\n\nEmployment Discrimination\n\n      O’Donovan brings her age and disability discrimination claims under the\n\nTexas Commission on Human Rights Act (TCHRA), the state counterpart to Title\n\nVII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. See TEX. LAB. CODE ANN. § 21.001(1) (West\n\n2006); Quantum Chem. Corp. v. Toennies, 47 S.W.3d 473, 476 (Tex. 2001). Texas\n\n                                         7\n\fcourts apply analogous federal statutes, and the cases interpreting them, to guide\n\nour understanding of the TCHRA. See Toennies, 47 S.W.3d at 476.\n\n      Under the TCHRA,\n\n      An employer commits an unlawful employment practice if because of\n      race, color, disability, religion, sex, national origin, or age the\n      employer:\n\n      (1) fails or refuses to hire an individual, discharges an individual, or\n      discriminates in any other manner against an individual in connection\n      with compensation or the terms, conditions, or privileges of\n      employment; or\n      (2) limits, segregates, or classifies an employee or applicant for\n      employment in a manner that would deprive or tend to deprive an\n      individual of any employment opportunity or adversely affect in any\n      other manner the status of an employee.\n\nTEX. LAB. CODE ANN. § 21.051 (West 2006).\n\n      In analyzing O’Donovan’s age and disability discrimination claims, we\n\napply the McDonnell-Douglas burden-shifting analysis. See McDonnell Douglas\n\nCorp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802–05, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 1824–25 (1973); see also\n\nWal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Canchola, 121 S.W.3d 735, 739 (Tex. 2003) (citing\n\nReeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 142–43, 120 S. Ct.\n\n2097, 2106 (2000)); M.D. Anderson Hosp. & Tumor Inst. v. Willrich, 28 S.W.3d\n\n22, 24 (Tex. 2000). Under this analysis, the plaintiff bears the initial burden to\n\ncome forward with a prima facie case of discrimination. Reeves, 530 U.S. at 142,\n\n120 S. Ct. at 2106; Toennies, 47 S.W.3d at 477. To make a prima facie case, the\n\nplaintiff must show that she (1) is a member of a class protected by the Act;\n                                         8\n\f(2) suffered an adverse employment decision; (3) was qualified for the position\n\nheld; and (4) was treated less favorably than similarly situated employees outside\n\nof the protected class. See Reeves, 530 U.S. at 142, 120 S. Ct. at 2106; see also\n\nFarrington v. Sysco Food Servs., Inc., 865 S.W.2d 247, 251 (Tex. App.—Houston\n\n[1st Dist.] 1993, writ denied). If O’Donovan establishes a prima facie case, the\n\nburden shifts to Weingarten to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for\n\nher termination.   See Reeves, 530 U.S. at 142, 120 S. Ct. at 2106; accord\n\nFarrington, 865 S.W.2d at 251. If Weingarten meets this burden, the burden shifts\n\nback to O’Donnell to show that the stated reason was a pretext for discrimination.\n\nSee Toennies, 47 S.W.3d at 477.\n\n      For the purpose of this appeal, we assume, without deciding, that\n\nO’Donovan made a prima facie case of both age and disability discrimination.\n\nUnder McDonnell-Douglas, then, we examine whether O’Donovan raised a fact\n\nissue on either claim to rebut Weingarten’s proffered legitimate, nondiscriminatory\n\nreason for terminating O’Donovan’s employment.           Weingarten offered two\n\nnondiscriminatory reasons for O’Donovan’s termination: economic conditions and\n\nperformance problems. We examine whether O’Donovan adduced any summary\n\njudgment evidence to rebut these reasons.\n\n\n\n\n                                         9\n\f      Reduction in force\n\n      A reduction in force is itself a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for\n\ntermination. EEOC v. Tex. Instrs. Inc., 100 F.3d 1173, 1181 (5th Cir. 1996). In\n\nher deposition, O’Donovan conceded that the economic conditions for commercial\n\nproperty developers like Weingarten had slowed to the point that, by 2008, its\n\nproperty acquisition activities had ground to a halt and “everything was at a\n\nstandstill.” O’Donovan does not raise evidence that the economic conditions were\n\na pretext: that Weingarten continued with two positions, or that her position was\n\nnecessary despite the downturn.\n\n      Absenteeism and performance issues\n\n      O’Donovan disputes Weingarten’s estimation of the amount of time that she\n\nspent out of the office, but she admitted in her deposition that, at times, she gave\n\nlittle or no notice that she would be absent on a particular day. By signing the PIP,\n\nO’Donovan also conceded that she had not been spent sufficient time in the office.\n\nShe agreed that Weingarten had a legitimate reason to ensure that it had consistent\n\nand reliable associates present at work to assist its customers and clients and\n\nwanted her to be in the office during working hours more consistently. In addition,\n\nO’Donovan admitted that her children’s disability-related appointments were not\n\nthe only reason for her absences, and that some absences were for her own\n\npersonal appointments.\n\n                                         10\n\f      O’Donovan responds that she was more qualified than Spencer to continue\n\nin the position, citing the fact that Brown regularly assigned her—not Spencer—\n\nthe more complex transactions to handle. As the Fifth Circuit has explained,\n\nhowever, “the issue is not whether [the plaintiff] or the retained employees were\n\nbetter qualified. An employer is entitled to make that decision for itself.” Walther\n\nv. Lone Star Gas Co., 952 F.2d 119, 123 (5th Cir. 1992). We hold that O’Donovan\n\nthus fails to raise a fact issue disputing whether these work performance issues\n\nserved as a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for Weingarten’s decision.\n\n      No remarks showing discriminatory animus\n\n      As an alternative, O’Donovan claims that she raises a fact issue with\n\nBrown’s direct evidence of discriminatory intent, because Brown commented to\n\nher about the age-consciousness of her own superiors. Remarks may raise a fact\n\nissue on O’Donovan’s claims of age or disability discrimination if they are: (1) age\n\nor disability related, (2) proximate in time to the employment decision, (3) made\n\nby an individual with authority over the employment decision at issue, and (4)\n\nrelated to the employment decision at issue. See Medina v. Ramsey Steel Co., 238\n\nF.3d 674, 683 (5th Cir. 2001).        O’Donovan falls short of meeting these\n\nrequirements. She does not identify any individual who expressed discriminatory\n\nanimus, the specific language used, when the individual might have made such a\n\nremark, or whether the individual played a part in the decision to eliminate\n\n                                        11\n\fO’Donovan’s job.       “Stray remarks, remote in time from [the employee’s]\n\ntermination, and not made by anyone directly connected with the RIF decisions,\n\nare not enough to raise a fact question about whether [the employer’s] reason for\n\nterminating [the employee] was pretextual.” Willrich, 28 S.W.3d at 25. Brown’s\n\nunspecified expressions of discomfort with her own aging do not themselves raise\n\na fact issue showing that Brown had age-related discriminatory animus toward\n\nO’Donovan that played a role in the decision to terminate O’Donovan’s\n\nemployment. Nor does O’Donovan identify remarks by any decision-maker that\n\nmight serve as circumstantial evidence of discriminatory animus toward\n\nO’Donovan’s need to attend to her children’s disabilities. Without circumstantial\n\nor direct evidence to support it, O’Donovan’s subjective belief that age or\n\ndisability was a factor in the termination decision is likewise insufficient to raise a\n\nfact issue. See id. We hold that the summary judgment evidence fails to raise a\n\nmaterial fact issue to rebut Weingarten’s legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for\n\nterminating O’Donovan’s employment.\n\n\n\n\n                                          12\n\f                                   Conclusion\n\n         The trial court properly granted summary judgment on O’Donovan’s age\n\nand disability discrimination claims. We therefore affirm the judgment of the trial\n\ncourt.\n\n\n\n\n                                             Jane Bland\n                                             Justice\n\nPanel consists of Justices Bland, Massengale, and Brown.\n\n\n\n\n                                        13\n\f",

O’Donovan performed her job well, and, in 2004, she was promoted to the\n\nfull-time position of government compliance representative.         Through 2007,\n\nO’Donovan continued to receive satisfactory performance reviews as well as\n\nannual salary increases and bonuses.\n\n      Meanwhile, in June 2006, Weingarten promoted administrative assistant\n\nAlison   Spencer to the position of assistant governmental               compliance\n\nrepresentative. A year later, Spencer was promoted to governmental compliance\n\nrepresentative, the same position as O’Donovan and one of two such positions in\n\nthe company at that time.\n\n      A few days after Spencer’s promotion, O’Donovan suffered an injury that\n\nrequired her to take short-term disability leave. When O’Donovan returned to\n\nwork three months later, in September 2007, the frequency of her absences from\n\nwork increased significantly.       Her 2007 performance review shows that\n\nO’Donovan was following a plan to catch up on incomplete work assignments, and\n\nhad an overall performance rating of “meets expectations,” at the center of the five-\n\npoint scale.\n\n\n\n\n                                         3\n\f      By January 2008, O’Donovan’s absences during working hours had\n\nincreased to the point that it affected her ability to complete her assignments\n\ntimely. At times, O’Donovan failed to clear the voicemail on her work cell phone;\n\nas a result, when she was away from the office, Brown was unable to leave her a\n\nmessage. O’Donovan attributed her absences to her own medical appointments,\n\npsychologist and psychiatrist appointments, personal issues, and her children’s\n\nregular medical, dental, and orthodontic appointments, as well as their school and\n\nextra-curricular activities.\n\n      O’Donovan’s February 2009 performance review stated that “O’Donovan’s\n\nwork product is generally good, and her job knowledge is excellent,” and also\n\nnoted that she “is able to think quickly on her feet and has a thorough\n\nunderstanding of her job and our processes.” Her frequent and ongoing absences,\n\nhowever, led to a performance rating of “needs improvement,” the second-lowest\n\nrating on the five-point scale. The review explained that “[d]ue to [O’Donovan’s]\n\nabsences [Brown has] been unable to assign [O’Donovan] projects that she would\n\notherwise be responsible for handling. At this time [O’Donovan] is not producing\n\nan acceptable amount of work for the position.” The review also noted that\n\nO’Donovan’s absences had become a burden on the department and created morale\n\nissues within the team.\n\n\n\n\n                                        4\n\f      As a result of the performance rating, the company provided O’Donovan\n\nwith a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP). The PIP required O’Donovan to be\n\npresent in the office for a minimum of forty hours during the work week with a\n\nreasonable allowance for occasional absences. It explained that O’Donovan was\n\nexpected to schedule multiple personal appointments in the same day to avoid\n\nmissing hours on multiple days and to take a vacation day when the appointments\n\nkept her out of the office for more than three hours. The PIP also required\n\nO’Donovan to provide time logs detailing the number of hours per week she\n\nmissed due to personal appointments, including specific arrival and departure\n\ntimes, and provide advance notice of all appointments.         In addition, Brown\n\nrequired O’Donovan to calendar all of her potential appointments so that Brown\n\ncould keep track of where O’Donovan might be if she were out of the office.\n\n      The PIP compliance period did not go smoothly. O’Donovan’s absences\n\ndecreased, but in July, she failed to attend a regular Monday morning meeting as a\n\nresult of misreading an email. Later in July, Brown documented O’Donovan’s\n\n“defensive, combative, [and] insubordinate behavior when O’Donovan refused to\n\nperform the job requested of her in the amount of time allotted causing a delay in a\n\nloan closing.” The amount of work she accomplished during the period compared\n\nunfavorably to the amount accomplished by Spencer.\n\n\n\n\n                                         5\n\f      In August 2009, Weingarten held an internal meeting to address the effect of\n\nthe overall decline in the economy on its acquisitions business.      The review\n\nrevealed that the number of acquisitions had dropped sharply. In contrast to the\n\nfifty-seven acquisitions the company made in the two-year period from 2005 to\n\n2007, Weingarten completed only two acquisitions in 2008 and had not acquired\n\nany property during 2009. As a result of these conditions, the company concluded\n\nthat it no longer needed two governmental compliance representatives to perform\n\nacquisition due diligence and decided to eliminate O’Donovan’s position.\n\n      Weingarten informed O’Donovan that it was terminating her employment\n\nbecause it was eliminating her job function as part of a reduction in force.\n\nWeingarten retained Spencer, who was less than forty years of age, to fill the\n\nremaining governmental compliance representative position.\n\n      Before bringing this lawsuit, O’Donovan filed a complaint with the Equal\n\nEmployment Opportunity Commission, claiming employment discrimination based\n\non her age. She also claimed disability discrimination based on her association\n\nwith her children.\n\n                                   Discussion\n\nSummary Judgment Standard of Review\n\n      An appellate court reviews de novo a trial court’s ruling on a summary\n\njudgment motion.

If O’Donovan establishes a prima facie case, the\n\nburden shifts to Weingarten to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for\n\nher termination.   See Reeves, 530 U.S. at 142, 120 S. Ct. at 2106; accord\n\nFarrington, 865 S.W.2d at 251. If Weingarten meets this burden, the burden shifts\n\nback to O’Donnell to show that the stated reason was a pretext for discrimination.\n\nSee Toennies, 47 S.W.3d at 477.\n\n      For the purpose of this appeal, we assume, without deciding, that\n\nO’Donovan made a prima facie case of both age and disability discrimination.\n\nUnder McDonnell-Douglas, then, we examine whether O’Donovan raised a fact\n\nissue on either claim to rebut Weingarten’s proffered legitimate, nondiscriminatory\n\nreason for terminating O’Donovan’s employment.           Weingarten offered two\n\nnondiscriminatory reasons for O’Donovan’s termination: economic conditions and\n\nperformance problems. We examine whether O’Donovan adduced any summary\n\njudgment evidence to rebut these reasons.\n\n\n\n\n                                         9\n\f      Reduction in force\n\n      A reduction in force is itself a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for\n\ntermination.

In\n\nher deposition, O’Donovan conceded that the economic conditions for commercial\n\nproperty developers like Weingarten had slowed to the point that, by 2008, its\n\nproperty acquisition activities had ground to a halt and “everything was at a\n\nstandstill.” O’Donovan does not raise evidence that the economic conditions were\n\na pretext: that Weingarten continued with two positions, or that her position was\n\nnecessary despite the downturn.\n\n      Absenteeism and performance issues\n\n      O’Donovan disputes Weingarten’s estimation of the amount of time that she\n\nspent out of the office, but she admitted in her deposition that, at times, she gave\n\nlittle or no notice that she would be absent on a particular day. By signing the PIP,\n\nO’Donovan also conceded that she had not been spent sufficient time in the office.\n\nShe agreed that Weingarten had a legitimate reason to ensure that it had consistent\n\nand reliable associates present at work to assist its customers and clients and\n\nwanted her to be in the office during working hours more consistently. In addition,\n\nO’Donovan admitted that her children’s disability-related appointments were not\n\nthe only reason for her absences, and that some absences were for her own\n\npersonal appointments.\n\n                                         10\n\f      O’Donovan responds that she was more qualified than Spencer to continue\n\nin the position, citing the fact that Brown regularly assigned her—not Spencer—\n\nthe more complex transactions to handle. As the Fifth Circuit has explained,\n\nhowever, “the issue is not whether [the plaintiff] or the retained employees were\n\nbetter qualified. An employer is entitled to make that decision for itself.” Walther\n\nv. Lone Star Gas Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"574349\"><a href=\"/opinion/574349/59-fair-emplpraccas-bna-848-58-empl-prac-dec-p-41258-melvin/\"><span class=\"volume\">952</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">119</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 123 (5th Cir. 1992). We hold that O’Donovan\n\nthus fails to raise a fact issue disputing whether these work performance issues\n\nserved as a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for Weingarten’s decision.\n\n      No remarks showing discriminatory animus\n\n      As an alternative, O’Donovan claims that she raises a fact issue with\n\nBrown’s direct evidence of discriminatory intent, because Brown commented to\n\nher about the age-consciousness of her own superiors. Remarks may raise a fact\n\nissue on O’Donovan’s claims of age or disability discrimination if they are: (1) age\n\nor disability related, (2) proximate in time to the employment decision, (3) made\n\nby an individual with authority over the employment decision at issue, and (4)\n\nrelated to the employment decision at issue. See Medina v. Ramsey Steel Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"23003\"><a href=\"/opinion/23003/medina-v-ramsey-steel-co-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">238</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">674</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 683 (5th Cir. 2001).        O’Donovan falls short of meeting these\n\nrequirements. She does not identify any individual who expressed discriminatory\n\nanimus, the specific language used, when the individual might have made such a\n\nremark, or whether the individual played a part in the decision to eliminate\n\n                                        11\n\fO’Donovan’s job.       “Stray remarks, remote in time from [the employee’s]\n\ntermination, and not made by anyone directly connected with the RIF decisions,\n\nare not enough to raise a fact question about whether [the employer’s] reason for\n\nterminating [the employee] was pretextual.” Willrich, 28 S.W.3d at 25. Brown’s\n\nunspecified expressions of discomfort with her own aging do not themselves raise\n\na fact issue showing that Brown had age-related discriminatory animus toward\n\nO’Donovan that played a role in the decision to terminate O’Donovan’s\n\nemployment. Nor does O’Donovan identify remarks by any decision-maker that\n\nmight serve as circumstantial evidence of discriminatory animus toward\n\nO’Donovan’s need to attend to her children’s disabilities. Without circumstantial\n\nor direct evidence to support it, O’Donovan’s subjective belief that age or\n\ndisability was a factor in the termination decision is likewise insufficient to raise a\n\nfact issue. See id. We hold that the summary judgment evidence fails to raise a\n\nmaterial fact issue to rebut Weingarten’s legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for\n\nterminating O’Donovan’s employment.\n\n\n\n\n                                          12\n\f                                   Conclusion\n\n         The trial court properly granted summary judgment on O’Donovan’s age\n\nand disability discrimination claims.
