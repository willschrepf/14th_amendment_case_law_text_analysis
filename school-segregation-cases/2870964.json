Baer’s\n(“Baer”) appeal from an order of the district court entered February\n20, 2004, granting summary judgment to the defendants, David Chase\nand DC Enterprises, Inc. (together called “Chase”), pursuant to\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c). This dispute centers on the\ncreation and development of the well-known television series, The\nSopranos. Through this action, Baer seeks compensation for what he\nperceives was his role in the creation and development of the popular\nand financially successful television series.\n\n\n\n           I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n\n\n         Chase, who originally was from New Jersey, but relocated to\nLos Angeles in 1971, is the creator, producer, writer and director of\nThe Sopranos. Chase has numerous credits for other television\nproductions as well. Before Chase met Baer, Chase had worked on a\nnumber of projects involving organized crime activities based in New\nJersey, including a script for “a mob boss in therapy,” a concept that,\nin part, would become the basis for The Sopranos.\n\n       In 1995, Chase was producing and directing a Rockford Files\n“movie-of-the–week” when he met Joseph Urbancyk who was\nworking on the set as a camera operator and temporary director of\nphotography. Chase mentioned to Urbancyk that he was looking for\nnew material and for writers who could develop feature film\n\n\n                                   2\n\fscreenplays that Chase later might re-write and direct. Urbancyk\nalso overheard Chase say that the creators of The Rockford Files were\nlooking to assign additional writers for their “movie of the week”\nproject.\n\n         Urbancyk became the connection between Chase and Baer as a\nresult of Urbancyk’s long-time friendship with Baer and his\nknowledge of Baer’s interest in pursuing a career in writing, directing\nand producing. Baer, who was a New Jersey attorney, recently had\nleft his employment in the Union County Prosecutor’s Office in\nElizabeth, New Jersey, where he had worked for the previous six\nyears.\n\n        Urbancyk urged Baer to write a script for The Rockford Files.\nBaer did so and gave it to Urbancyk who passed it on to Chase. Chase\nconsidered Baer’s work “interesting” and asked Urbancyk if Baer had\nany plans to be in Los Angeles. Upon hearing of Chase’s interest,\nBaer flew to Los Angeles to meet with Chase.\n\n        Chase, Urbancyk and Baer met for lunch on June 20, 1995. At\nthat time Chase informed Baer that he would be unable to use Baer’s\nscreenplay, as the remaining slots in The Rockford Files had been\nfilled. The lunch continued, however, with Baer describing his\nexperience as a prosecutor. Baer also pitched the idea to shoot “a film\nor television shows about the New Jersey Mafia.” App. at 40. At that\ntime Baer was unaware of Chase’s previous work involving mob\nactivity premised in New Jersey. At the lunch there was no reference\nto any payment that Chase might make to Baer for the latter’s services\nand the parties agree that they did not reach any agreement on that\nday.\n\n        In October 1995, Chase visited New Jersey for three days.\nDuring this “research visit” Baer arranged meetings for Chase with\nDetective Thomas Koczur, Detective Robert A. Jones, and Tony\nSpirito who provided Chase with information, material and personal\nstories about their experiences with organized crime. Koczur served\nas a tour guide and drove Chase and Baer to various locations in\nnorthern New Jersey. Koczur also arranged a lunch between Chase\nand Spirito. Spirito told true and sometimes personal stories\ninvolving loan sharking, a power struggle with two uncles involving a\nfamily business, and two individuals, Big Pussy and Little Pussy\n\n\n\n\n                                  3\n\fRusso.1 Chase also met with Jones, a detective with the Union\nCounty Prosecutor’s office who had experience investigating\norganized crime. Baer does not dispute that virtually all of the ideas\nand locations that he “contributed” to Chase existed in the public\nrecord.\n\n        After returning to Los Angeles, Chase sent Baer a copy of a\ndraft of a Sopranos screenplay that he had written, which was dated\nDecember 20, 1995. Baer asserts that after he read it he called Chase\nand made various comments with regard to it. Baer claims that the\ntwo spoke at least four times during the following year and that he\nsent a letter to Chase dated February 10, 1997, discussing The\nSopranos script. Baer ensured that Chase received the letter by\nconfirming its arrival with Chase’s assistant. On this appeal we\naccept Baer’s allegations regarding his input into The Sopranos draft.\n\n        Notwithstanding his February 10, 1997 letter, at his deposition\nBaer claimed that he last rendered services to Chase in 1995. Thus,\nBaer’s testimony included the following:\n\n                       Q. During any of those\n                       conversations after\n                       October of 1995, [when\n                       Chase visited New\n                       Jersey] did you provide\n                       any further information\n                       to Mr. Chase other than\n                       in relation to the sexual\n                       assault?\n\n                       A. Not really.\n\n                       Q. No?\n\n                       A. Not really. The\n                       screen play was done and\n                       there wasn’t really any\n                       need for it at that point\n                       as far as I knew.\n\n\n\n       1\n        These or similar story lines and characters have appeared in\nepisodes of The Sopranos.\n\n                                   4\n\f                           Q. So everything that\n                           you had done and to\n                           which you claim\n                           entitlement was done by\n                           the end of October 1995?\n\n                           A. Yes in terms of\n                           assisting him in helping\n                           with this project that\n                           would be true.\n\nApp. at 343-44.2 Notwithstanding this testimony, in Baer’s later\ncertification dated October 3, 2003, in opposition to Chase’s motion\nfor summary judgment he sought to clarify his deposition testimony,\nstating:\n\n                           117. I also sent him a\n                           letter dated February 10,\n                           1997 discussing the\n                           Sopranos script prior to\n                           making a trip to Los\n                           Angeles. After sending\n                           the letter, I spoke with\n                           Chase’s assistant, Kelly\n                           Kockzak, who confirmed\n                           that Chase had received\n                           it. This letter represents\n                           the last services I\n                           provided to Defendants.\n                           Most of my services\n                           were provided in 1995.\n\nApp. at 69.\n\n         Baer asserts that he and Chase orally agreed on three separate\noccasions that if the show became a success, Chase would “take care\nof” Baer, and “remunerate [Baer] in a manner commensurate to the\ntrue value of [his services].” App. at 113. According to Baer, he and\nChase first made this oral agreement on the telephone during one of\ntheir first two or three conversations during the summer of 1995. The\n\n\n        2\n            The reference to the “sexual assault” is not material to the issues\nhere.\n\n                                        5\n\fsecond occasion was on the telephone and occurred immediately prior\nto Chase’s October 1995 visit to New Jersey. The third time the\nparties reached the agreement was in person when they met in New\nJersey in October 1995.\n\n         Baer claims that on each of these occasions the parties had the\nsame conversation in which Chase offered to pay Baer, stating “you\nhelp me; I pay you.” App. at 112-13. Baer always rejected Chase’s\noffer, reasoning that Chase would be unable to pay him “for the true\nvalue of the services [Baer] was rendering.” Id. Each time Baer\nrejected Chase’s offer he did so with a counteroffer, “that I would\nperform the services while assuming the risk that if the show failed\n[Chase] would owe me nothing. If, however, the show succeeded he\nwould remunerate me in a manner commensurate to the true value of\nmy services.” Id. at 113. Baer acknowledges that this counteroffer,\nwhich in these proceedings we treat as having become the parties’\nagreement, always was oral and did not include any fixed term of\nduration or price. There is no other evidence in the record of any\nother discussion between Baer and Chase regarding the terms of the\ncontract. For purposes of the motion for summary judgment, Chase\naccepts Baer’s version of the events as true and thus concedes there\nwas an oral agreement to the extent that Baer sets it forth.\nNotwithstanding this agreement, insofar as we can ascertain, other\nthan Baer’s calls to Chase after he received the Sopranos script, the\nnext time Baer heard anything from or about Chase was when he\nreceived a phone call from Detective Koczur telling him that Chase\nwas in Elizabeth shooting The Sopranos. In fact, Chase has not paid\nBaer for his services.\n\n        On or about May 15, 2002, Baer filed a verified complaint\nagainst Chase in the district court and thereafter on May 2, 2003, Baer\nfiled an amended verified complaint. Baer’s amended complaint\nadvanced ten claims: (1) breach of contract; (2) breach of implied\ncontract; (3) breach of quasi-contract; (4) common law fraud; (5)\nequitable fraud; (6) negligent misrepresentation; (7) breach of\nfiduciary duty; (8) unfair competition under section 43(a) of the\nLanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125; (9) unfair competition and\nmisappropriation under N.J. Stat. Ann. § 56:4-1 (West 2001); and\n(10) tortious interference with prospective economic advantage. App.\nat 137-48. Baer subsequently withdrew the federal unfair competition\n\n\n\n\n                                   6\n\fclaim.3 Eventually Chase brought a motion for summary judgment\nunder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c) alleging that there was no\ngenuine issue as to any material fact and he was entitled to a judgment\nas a matter of law. Chase claimed that the alleged contract and\nimplied contract were too vague, ambiguous and lacking in essential\nterms to be enforced and the statute of frauds barred the actions based\non them. Moreover, Chase claimed that the statute of limitations\nbarred the breach of quasi-contract quantum meruit claim. Finally,\nChase alleged that each of Baer’s six remaining claims was lacking in\nmerit. Baer did not file a cross-motion for complete or partial\nsummary judgment.\n\n        The district court granted Chase’s motion, concluding that\nthere was no genuine issue of material fact with respect to any of\nBaer’s claims. The district court held with respect to the claims raised\non this appeal that: the contract claims were unenforceable due to\nvagueness, uncertainty, and the lack of essential terms in the contract;\nthe statute of limitations barred the quasi-contract claim; and the\nmisappropriation tort claim was without merit due to a lack of\nnovelty. In addition, the district court made certain rulings with\nrespect to evidence that we describe below which Baer challenges.\n\n\n\n       II.   JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n         The district court exercised diversity jurisdiction pursuant to\n28 U.S.C. § 1332 in that the parties were of diverse citizenship and\nthe amount in controversy exceeded $75,000 exclusive of interest and\ncosts. Our jurisdiction is founded on 28 U.S.C. § 1291, as this timely\nappeal is from a final order of the district court granting Chase’s\nmotion for summary judgment. We make a plenary review of the\ndistrict court’s order granting summary judgment to Chase. See\n\n\n        3\n         The district court indicated that Baer partially withdrew his\nfederal and state unfair competition and misappropriation claims, Baer\nv. Chase, No. Civ. A. 02-CV-2334, 2004 WL 350050, at *1 n.1 (Feb. 20,\n2004), and the docket entries support this statement but indicate that the\nentire misappropriation claim was withdrawn. See app. at 34. Yet the\ncourt discussed the state unfair competition and misappropriation claim\nat length, id. at *12-14, and rejected them on the merits. Moreover, the\nparties substantively have briefed the misappropriation claim so we\nregard it as still in the case.\n\n                                    7\n\fFakete v. Aetna, Inc., 308 F.3d 335, 337 (3d Cir. 2002) (citing\nFogleman v. Mercy Hosp., Inc., 283 F.3d 561, 566 n.3 (3d Cir.\n2002)). Insofar as the case involves state law, New Jersey law is\napplicable.\n\n\n\n                         III.   DISCUSSION\n\n              A. Baer’s Implied-In-Fact Contract Claim\n\n        Baer predicates his contract claim on this appeal on an\nimplied-in-fact contract rather than on the oral agreement he reached\nwith Chase. The issue with respect to the implied-in-fact contract\nclaim concerns whether Chase and Baer entered into an enforceable\ncontract for services Baer rendered that aided in the creation and\nproduction of The Sopranos. In the district court Baer offered two\nalternative theories in which a purported contract was formed: the\n“oral agreement/success contingency” and an implied-in-fact contract.\n\n        The parties agree for purposes of the summary judgment\nmotion that there was a contingent oral agreement providing for Chase\nto compensate Baer, depending on Chase’s “success,” in exchange for\nthe aid Baer provided in the creation and production of The Sopranos.\nAs we noted above, the parties reached the oral agreement in three\nexchanges in which Baer proposed: “that I would perform the services\nwhile assuming the risk that if the show failed [Chase] would owe me\nnothing. If, however, the show succeeded he would remunerate me in\na manner commensurate to the true value of my services.” App. at\n113. As we have indicated, for purposes of the summary judgment\nmotion only, Chase accepts this version of the events so we will\nregard the existence of the oral agreement as not in dispute.\n\n        The district court held, and Baer concedes on appeal, that this\noral agreement was “too vague to be enforced” as an express contract.\nAppellant’s br. at 30-31; see Baer v. Chase, No. Civ. A. 02-CV-2334,\n2004 WL 350050, at *6 (Feb. 20, 2004) (“The contract as articulated\nby the Plaintiff lacks essential terms, and is vague, indefinite and\nuncertain; no version of the alleged agreement contains sufficiently\nprecise terms to constitute an enforceable contract.”). This\ndescription of the oral agreement leaves at issue Baer’s contention that\nthe district court overlooked the existence of an enforceable implied-\nin-fact contract, rendering Chase liable for the services that Baer\n\n\n                                   8\n\fprovided.\n\n               1. The Distinction Between Express And Implied–In-\n                  Fact Contracts\n\n        The distinction between express and implied contracts rests on\nalternative methods of contract formation. Contracts are “express”\nwhen the parties state their terms and “implied” when the parties do\nnot state their terms. The distinction is based not on the contracts’\nlegal effect but on the way the parties manifest their mutual assent. In\nre Penn. Cent. Transp. Co., 831 F.2d 1221, 1228 (3d Cir. 1987) (“An\nimplied-in-fact contract, therefore, is a true contract arising from\nmutual agreement and intent to promise, but in circumstances in\nwhich the agreement and promise have not been verbally expressed.\nThe agreement is rather inferred from the conduct of the parties.”); see\nBaltimore O.R. Co. v. United States, 261 U.S. 592, 597, 43 S.Ct. 425,\n426-27 (1923). In other words, the terms “express” and “implied” do\nnot denote different kinds of contracts, but rather reference the\nevidence by which the parties demonstrate their agreement. See St.\nPaul Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Indem. Ins. Co. of N. Am., 158 A.2d\n825, 828 (N.J. 1960).\n\n        Baer’s attempt to find an implied-in-fact contract in his\ndealings with Chase does not strengthen his claim that Chase\nbreached his contract with him. There is only one contract at issue,\nChase’s promise to compensate Baer for services he rendered which\naided in the creation and production of The Sopranos. Chase’s\nstipulation that there was such a contract has the consequence of\nmaking Baer’s attempts to label this agreement “implied” rather than\n“express” to advance a distinction without a difference as the mode of\ncontract formation, as we will explain, is immaterial to the disposition\nof the breach of contract claim. In other words, inasmuch as the\nparties agree for purposes of these summary judgment proceedings\nthat there was an agreement, the manner in which they formed the\ncontract is immaterial because different legal consequences do not\nflow from analyzing the alleged contract as implied-in-fact rather than\nexpress. See Saint Barnabas Med. Ctr. v. Essex County, 543 A.2d 34,\n39 (N.J. 1988) (quoting St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co., 158 A.2d at\n828 (“[A] true contract implied in fact ‘is in legal effect an express\ncontract,’ and varies from the latter only insofar as the parties’\nagreement and assent thereto have been manifested by conduct instead\nof words.”). The district court was therefore correct in its holding that\n“[b]ecause the Defendants have assumed the existence of a contract as\n\n\n                                   9\n\fthe Plaintiff has described it for the purposes of the motion there is no\nissue regarding formation of the contract or assent, and the Plaintiff’s\ndistinction between express and implied contracts is irrelevant.” Baer,\n2004 WL 350050, at *5 (citations omitted).\n\n        Moreover, Baer’s claim of an implied-in-fact contract, in the\nface of an express agreement governing the same subject matter, is\nlegally untenable. There cannot be an implied-in-fact contract if there\nis an express contract that covers the same subject matter. In re Penn\nCent. Transp. Co., 831 F.2d at 1229-30; see Klebe v. United States,\n263 U.S. 188, 191-92, 44 S.Ct. 58, 58-59 (1923). In other words,\nexpress contract and implied-in-fact contract theories are mutually\nexclusive.\n\n        In In re Penn Central Transportation Company, 831 F.2d 1221,\nwe addressed the relationship between express and implied contracts.\nIn that case the government sought recovery under the Regional Rail\nReorganization Act for funds it paid to Penn Central in an attempt to\nsustain routine operations at the financially ailing railroad company.\nThe government and the railroad had entered into a number of express\nagreements pursuant to the Act to effectuate these loans. The\ngovernment later claimed that Penn Central performed unauthorized\nwork, resulting in the overpayment of $22.3 million to it. The\ngovernment argued that the Act dictated the specific and limited\nmanner in which the government loan money could be utilized, and,\naccordingly, sought return of its funding expended on “unauthorized”\nactivities.\n\n         In response, Penn Central put forth an interpretation of the Act\nin which the alleged unauthorized activities would have been\nacceptable under its requirements. In the alternative, it maintained\nthat it had an entered into a separate and enforceable implied-in-fact\ncontract with the government to continue using these funds for the\nactivities in which it was engaged, even if they were deemed outside\nthe scope of the Act. Id. at 1225.\n\n        We focused on and disallowed the railroad’s attempt to prove\nthe existence of both express and implied-in-fact agreements dealing\nwith the same subject. We stated, “no implied-in-fact contract may be\nfound when, as here, the parties have an express agreement dealing\nwith the same subject.” Id. at 1229. The operative principle here and\nin Penn Central Transportation Company is the same. As noted\nabove, there is only one agreement at issue in the present case,\n\n\n                                   10\n\fChase’s promise to pay Baer for the services he rendered. Chase\nconcedes the existence of the oral express agreement as alleged by\nBaer. Consequently, the fundamental contract law principle that\nimplied and express contacts are mutually exclusive forecloses Baer’s\nattempt to establish that there was an implied-in-fact contract.\n\n           New Jersey law, applicable here, recognizes the mutual\nexclusivity of express and implied contracts. Roselle Park Bldg. &\nLoan Ass’n v. Friedlander, 181 A. 316, 317 (N.J. Sup. Ct. 1935) (“[I]t\nis axiomatic that a contract cannot arise by implication in fact where\nthere is an express contract between the parties relating to the same\nsubject matter. . . .”). The existence of an express contract, however,\ndoes not preclude the existence of an implied contract if the implied\ncontract is distinct from the express contract. Atlas Corp. v. United\nStates, 895 F.2d 745, 754-55 (Fed. Cir. 1990); see Chase Manhattan\nBank v. Iridium Africa Corp., 239 F. Supp. 2d 402, 409 (D. Del.\n2002) (“A party may assert the existence of an express contract and\nimplied-in-fact contract only if the terms of the contracts alleged\ndiffer in some manner.”); ITT Fed. Support Servs., Inc. v. United\nStates, 531 F.2d 522, 528 n.12 (Ct. Cl. 1976) (“The implied contract,\nif it is to be valid, must be entirely unrelated to the express contract.\nThe existence of an express contract precludes the existence of an\nimplied contract dealing with the same subject.”).\n\n        Baer’s alleged implied-in-fact contract, however, rather than\nbeing distinct from or unrelated to the express oral contract is\nidentical to it. The stipulated oral agreement included Chase’s\npromise to compensate Baer for the services and ideas that Baer\nprovided Chase. Baer now asks that we find an implied-in-fact\ncontract that subjects Chase to liability for the very same undertaking.\nBaer provides a litany of facts which indicate that Chase may have\nused his services or prospered from his ideas. Nevertheless, in light\nof Chase’s stipulation to the existence of an agreement governing this\nsubject matter, this evidence is immaterial to the issues raised by the\nsummary judgment motion with respect to Baer’s attempt to establish\nthat there was an implied-in-fact contract between the parties.\n\n        The question is not whether Chase entered into an agreement\nwith Baer or whether Chase utilized his ideas. We already deem these\nmatters, for the purposes of the motion for summary judgment and\nthis appeal, as established. The question is whether Chase’s non-\nverbal actions prove there was a contract distinct from the express\nagreement or expanding on the terms of the agreement to make it\n\n\n                                   11\n\fenforceable. The answer is clearly that the actions do not do so. The\nalleged implied-in-fact contract completely mirrors the acknowledged\nexpress contract’s subject matter. Baer nowhere demonstrates that the\nsubject matter of the alleged implied-in-fact contract is distinct, more\ndefinite in terms of price and duration, or covers a subject matter\ndivergent from the oral agreement. The district court, therefore,\nwould have erred if it had analyzed this case on the basis that there\nwas a separate implied-in-fact contract distinct from the express\ncontract that governed the identical subject matter.\n\n               2. Definitiveness As To Price and Duration In An\n                  “Idea Submission” Case\n\n        Even assuming that Baer had been able to demonstrate that he\nhad an implied-in-fact contract with Chase, his contention that an\nimplied-in-fact contract claim in an idea submission case need not be\ndefinite as to price and duration, would be incorrect. Baer asserts that\nthe district court’s holding “that the absence of a price and duration\nterm render[s] an implied contract in an idea submission scenario too\nvague to be enforced . . . is contrary to the law in virtually every\njurisdiction that has ever considered the issue.” Appellant’s br. at 34.\nBaer’s claim fails on three grounds: (1) there is no distinction\nbetween express and implied contracts, aside from issues of contract\nformation; (2) definiteness with respect to price and duration is\nnecessary for idea submission cases under New Jersey contract law;\nand (3) the district court was correct in holding that the contract Baer\nalleges existed was too ambiguous and indefinite to be enforceable.\n\n               a. An Implied-In-Fact Contract Has The Same Legal\n                  Consequences As An Express Contract.\n\n       In fact there are no distinctions in legal effect, at least in the\ncontext of this case, when a promise is implied rather than express.\nSee Duffy v. Charles Schwab & Co., 123 F. Supp. 2d 802, 816-17\n(D.N.J. 2001) (“The only difference between an implied-in-fact\ncontract and an express contract is that the parties’ agreement has\nbeen manifested by conduct instead of words.”). No rationale exists\nto conclude that definiteness as to the essential terms of a contract\ncould be an exception from this fundamental principle. We therefore\ndetermine if in any “idea submission case,” whether predicated on an\nexpress or implied contract, definiteness is a requirement to create an\nenforceable contract.\n\n\n\n                                   12\n\f               b. A Contract Involving An Idea Submission Must Be\n               Definite With Respect To All Essential Terms To Be\n               Enforceable Under New Jersey Contract Law.\n\n        In fact “[a] contract arises from offer and acceptance, and must\nbe sufficiently definite so ‘that the performance to be rendered by\neach party can be ascertained with reasonable certainty.’” Weichert\nCo. Realtors v. Ryan, 608 A.2d 280, 284 (N.J. 1992) (citing West\nCaldwell v. Caldwell, 138 A.2d 402, 410 (N.J. 1958); Friedman v.\nTappan Dev. Corp., 126 A.2d 646, 650-51 (N.J. 1956); Leitner v.\nBraen, 143 A.2d 256, 259-60 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1958)).\nTherefore parties create an enforceable contract when they agree on its\nessential terms and manifest an intent that the terms bind them. West\nCaldwell, 138 A.2d at 410; see Johnson & Johnson v. Charmley Drug\nCo., 95 A.2d 391, 397 (N.J. 1953); California Natural v. Nestle\nHoldings, Inc., 631 F. Supp. 465, 470 (D.N.J.1986). If parties to an\nagreement do not agree on one or more essential terms of the\npurported agreement courts generally hold it to be unenforceable.\nWeichert, 608 A.2d at 284 (citing Heim v. Shore, 151 A.2d 556, 561-\n62 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1959) (holding agreement unenforceable\nbecause parties did not agree on terms of payment, principal amount\nof mortgage, due date, and interest rate)).\n\n        New Jersey contract law focuses on the performance promised\nwhen analyzing an agreement to determine if it is too vague to be\nenforced. “An agreement so deficient in the specification of its\nessential terms that the performance by each party cannot be\nascertained with reasonable certainty is not a contract, and clearly is\nnot an enforceable one.” Lo Bosco v. Kure Eng’g Ltd., 891 F. Supp.\n1020, 1025 (D.N.J. 1995) (citing Malaker Corp. Stockholders\nProtective Comm. v. First Jersey Nat’l Bank, 395 A.2d 222, 227 (N.J.\nSuper. Ct. App. Div. 1978)). A contract, therefore, is unenforceable\nfor vagueness when its essential terms are too indefinite to allow a\ncourt to determine with reasonable certainty what each party has\npromised to do. Weichert, 608 A.2d at 284; see West Caldwell, 138\nA.2d at 410 (“To be enforceable as a contractual undertaking, an\nagreement must be sufficiently definite in its terms that the\nperformance to be rendered by each party can be ascertained with\nreasonable certainty.”).\n\n       New Jersey law deems the price term, i.e., the amount of\ncompensation, an essential term of any contract. MDC Inv. Prop.,\nL.L.C. v. Marando, 44 F. Supp. 2d 693, 698-99 (D.N.J. 1999) (citing\n\n\n                                  13\n\fWeichert, 608 A.2d at 287). An agreement lacking definiteness of\nprice, however, is not unenforceable if the parties specify a practicable\nmethod by which they can determine the amount. Moorestown\nMgmt., Inc. v. Moorestown Bookshop, Inc., 249 A.2d 623, 628 (N.J.\nSuper. Ct. Ch. Div. 1969). However, in the absence of an agreement\nas to the manner or method of determining compensation the\npurported agreement is invalid. Weichert, 608 A.2d at 287.\nAdditionally, the duration of the contract is deemed an essential term\nand therefore any agreement must be sufficiently definitive to allow a\ncourt to determine the agreed upon length of the contractual\nrelationship. Lo Bosco, 891 F. Supp. at 1026 (“With regard to\ncontracts for services in return for a percentage of some\nyet-to-be-determined number, such as profits, sales, etc., the courts [of\nand in New Jersey] look to whether there are certain dates of\ncommencement and termination.”).\n\n        The New Jersey Supreme Court explicitly has held that an\nimplied-in-fact contract “must be sufficiently definite [so] that the\nperformance to be rendered by each party can be ascertained with\nreasonable certainty.” Weichert, 608 A.2d at 284 (citations and\ninternal quotations omitted). If possible, courts will “attach a\nsufficiently definite meaning to the terms of a bargain to make it\nenforceable[,]” Paley v. Barton Sav. and Loan Ass’n, 196 A.2d 682,\n686 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1964), and in doing so may refer to\n“commercial practice or other usage or custom.” Lynch v. New Deal\nDelivery Serv. Inc., 974 F. Supp. 441, 458 (D.N.J. 1997). But the\ncourts recognize that a contract is “unenforceable for vagueness when\nits terms are too indefinite to allow a court to determine with\nreasonable certainty what each party has promised to do.” Id. at 457.\n\n        Baer premises his argument on his view that New Jersey\nshould disregard the well-established requirement of definiteness in\nits contract law when the subject-matter of the contract is an “idea\nsubmission.” He cites extensively to a string of cases from various\njurisdictions which he urges support his contention. See, e.g., Wrench\nL.L.C v. Taco Bell Corp., 256 F.3d 446 (6th Cir. 2001); Nadel v.\nPlay-by-Play Toys & Novelties, Inc., 208 F.3d 368 (2d Cir. 2000);\nDuffy, 123 F. Supp. 2d 802. Baer contends that these cases support\nthe proposition that “[e]very Circuit that has published on the issue,\nhas upheld implied contract claims where price and duration were\nabsent and a price term was implied as the reasonable value of the\nideas conveyed.” Appellant’s br. at 34.\n\n\n\n                                   14\n\f        Baer’s argument is inaccurate and misleading. He attempts to\ntransform cases where the issues raised pertain to adequacy of\nconsideration and discrepancies over the use of submitted facts, into\nthe proposition that implied-in-fact contracts involving idea\nsubmissions need not be sufficiently definite. For example: Wrench,\n256 F.3d at 459-63, reversed a summary judgment disposition that\nheld that novelty was required to prove consideration and sustain an\nimplied-in-fact contract claim; Duffy, 123 F. Supp. 2d at 816-19, held\nthat a plaintiff must prove that an idea disclosed to the defendant was\nnovel in order to find consideration for the alleged contract and denied\nsummary judgment because a material issue existed over novelty and\nuse; Nadel, 208 F.3d at 374, reversed a summary judgment granted\n“only on ground that [the plaintiff’s] idea lacked general novelty and\nthus would not suffice as consideration” and remanded for the district\ncourt to determine “whether the other elements necessary to find a\nvalid express or implied-in-fact contract are present here.” Id. at 382.\nNone of the cases Baer cites holds that there is not a definiteness\nrequirement necessary to create an enforceable contract in idea\nsubmission cases. Duffy’s holding is helpful in summarizing the\nactual law to be derived from the above cited cases: “The existence of\nnovelty to the buyer only addresses the element of consideration\nnecessary for the formation of a contract. Thus, apart from\nconsideration, the formation of a contract will depend upon the\npresence of other elements.” Duffy, 123 F. Supp. 2d at 818 (citing\nNadel, 208 F.3d at 377 n.5).\n\n        New Jersey precedent does not support Baer’s attempt to carve\nout an exception to traditional principles of contract law for\nsubmission-of-idea cases. The New Jersey courts have not provided\neven the slightest indication that they intend to depart from their well-\nestablished requirement that enforceability of a contract requires\ndefiniteness with respect to the essential terms of that contract.\nAccordingly, we will not relax the need for Baer to demonstrate\ndefiniteness as to price and duration with respect to the contract he\nentered into with Chase.\n\n               3. The Alleged “Contract” Regardless Of Labels Is\n                  Too Vague To Be Enforced.\n\n        The final question with respect to the Baer’s contract claim,\ntherefore, is whether his contract is enforceable in light of the\ntraditional requirement of definitiveness in New Jersey contract law\nfor a contract to be enforceable. A contract may be expressed in\n\n\n                                   15\n\fwriting, or orally, or in acts, or partly in one of these ways and partly\nin others. Troy v. Rutgers, 774 A.2d 476, 482-83 (N.J. 2001). There\nis a point, however, at which interpretation becomes alteration. In re\nPenn Cent. Transp. Co., 831 F.2d at 1226 (citing Mellon Bank, N.A.\nv. Aetna Bus. Credit, Inc., 619 F.2d 1001, 1011 (3d Cir. 1980)). In\nthis case, even when all of the parties’ verbal and non-verbal actions\nare aggregated and viewed most favorably to Baer, we cannot find a\ncontract that is distinct and definitive enough to be enforceable.\n\n          Nothing in the record indicates that the parties agreed on\nhow, how much, where, or for what period Chase would compensate\nBaer. The parties did not discuss who would determine the “true\nvalue” of Baer’s services, when the “true value” would be calculated,\nor what variables would go into such a calculation. There was no\ndiscussion or agreement as to the meaning of “success” of The\nSopranos. There was no discussion how “profits” were to be defined.\nThere was no contemplation of dates of commencement or\ntermination of the contract. And again, nothing in Baer’s or Chase’s\nconduct, or the surrounding circumstances of the relationship, shed\nlight on, or answers, any of these questions. The district court was\ncorrect in its description of the contract between the parties: “The\ncontract as articulated by the Plaintiff lacks essential terms, and is\nvague, indefinite and uncertain; no version of the alleged agreement\ncontains sufficiently precise terms to constitute an enforceable\ncontract.” Baer, 2004 WL 350050, at *6. We therefore will affirm\nthe district court’s rejection of Baer’s claim to recover under a theory\nof implied-in-fact contract.\n\n                    B. Baer’s Quasi-Contract Claim\n\n         Our rejection of Baer’s implied-in-fact contract claim does not\npreclude him from recovering on his quasi-contract claim and thus in\nview of the district court’s disposition of that claim we consider when\nthe statute of limitations started running on it. This inquiry has two\nparts: (1) application of the discovery rule; and (2) whether the\ndistrict court erred in disregarding Baer’s certification in opposition to\nChase’s motion for summary judgment, particularly when it is clear\nthat evidence in the record corroborated the certification. The court\ndisregarded the certification on the grounds that it conflicted with\nBaer’s prior deposition testimony. This statute of limitations inquiry\nis critical as the district court did not reject the quasi-contract claim on\nthe merits, and there is no doubt that in an appropriate case,\ndepending on the facts, that a party may recover on a quasi-contract\n\n\n                                    16\n\fclaim even if there was no actual contract.\n\n        If, in fact, Baer’s deposition was accurate, everything to which\nhe claims entitlement for compensation had been completed by the\nend of October 1995, some six years and seven months before he filed\nthis lawsuit. In that circumstance, as we explain below, the district\ncourt would have held correctly that the New Jersey statute of\nlimitations barred Baer’s quasi-contract claim unless the discovery\nrule postponed the commencement of the limitations period. But the\ndeposition testimony may have been incomplete as there is evidence\nin the record refuting the portion of it indicating that Baer’s last\nrendition of services was in October 1995, as it is undisputed that\nBaer sent a letter to Chase on February 10, 1997, critiquing Chase’s\nearly screenplay of The Sopranos. Indeed, this letter was already in\nthe record at the time of the deposition. In addition, Baer corrected\nthe “misstatement” in his deposition by reference to the “undisputed\nfacts that were already in evidence” in his certification in opposition\nto Chase’s motion for summary judgment.\n\n        Preliminarily on the statute of limitations issue we observe\nthat under New Jersey law, non-personal injury actions involving\nmonetary damages must be “commenced within 6 years after the\ncause of any such action shall have accrued.” N.J. Stat. Ann. §\n2A:14-1 (West 2000). Moreover, there is no dispute between the\nparties that the six-year statute of limitations governs quasi-contract\nclaims. See Kopin v. Orange Prods., Inc., 688 A.2d 130, 140-41 (N.J.\nSuper. Ct. App. Div. 1997). The initial issue here, however, is an\ninquiry into when the statute started to run.\n\n         Baer challenges the district court’s holding that a quasi-\ncontract claim “accrued, if at all” for the purposes of statue of\nlimitations, when Baer rendered his final services in October 1995.\nBaer, 2004 WL 350050, at *9. Baer asserts that “the Court did not\naddress Plaintiff’s contention that the discovery rule should be applied\nand as a result the cause of action did not accrue until The Sopranos\nfirst aired on January 10, 1999.” Appellant’s br. at 58.\n\n        In New Jersey as elsewhere “[t]he discovery rule postpones the\ncommencement of a cause of action until a Plaintiff knows, or should\nhave known, of facts which establish that an injury has occurred, and\nthat fault for that injury can be attributed to another.” Riemer v. St.\nClaire’s Riverside Med. Ctr., 691 A.2d 1384, 1388-89 (N.J. Super. Ct.\nApp. Div. 1997) (citing Lynch v. Rubacky, 424 A.2d 1169, 1171 (N.J.\n\n\n                                  17\n\f1981) ( “[The rule] provides that in an appropriate case a cause of\naction will be held not to accrue until the injured party discovers, or\nby the exercise of reasonable diligence and intelligence should have\ndiscovered that he may have a basis for an actionable claim . . . (or)\nknows or has reason to know that he has a right of redress.”)).\n\n        Baer, however, does not cite any New Jersey decision applying\nthe discovery rule to delay the time when the statute of limitations\nbegins to run on a quasi-contract claim.4 Moreover, while most\njurisdictions have not ruled explicitly on whether the discovery rule\nshould apply in quantum meruit cases, those that have addressed the\nissue have chosen not to utilize the discovery rule, but rather to\nemploy a “last rendition of services” test. Thus, in Rabinowitz v.\nMass. Bonding & Insurance Co., 197 A. 44, 47 (N.J. 1938), the court\nused a last “rendition of services” calculation in an unjust enrichment\nclaim. Additionally, the court in Kopin, 688 A.2d at 140, cited a New\nYork case granting summary judgment predicated on the statute of\nlimitations in a quantum meruit case in which there was a failure of\nproof as to when the plaintiff completed his performance, Wint v.\nFields, 576 N.Y.S.2d 266 (N.Y. App. Div. 1991). See also GSGSB,\nInc. v. New York Yankees, 862 F. Supp. 1160, 1171 (S.D.N.Y. 1994)\n(“[A] cause of action for quantum meruit begins to run when the final\n\n\n        4\n          The only case that Baer cites purporting to apply the discovery\nrule to a quasi-contract claim is a New York case, German v. Pope John\nPaul, 621 N.Y.S. 311 (N.Y. App. Div. 1995); see Appellant’s br. at 59\n(“[T]he Court expressly held that the discovery rule is applicable to quasi\ncontract claims.”). In German, the plaintiff brought an action against\nthe Pope and others to recover on a tort claim and for breach of contract\nin connection with membership as a priest within a religious community.\nThe trial court barred his claim, basing its statute of limitations\ndetermination on the erroneous conclusion that the plaintiff had resigned\nfrom the priesthood in January 1987. The appellate division noted that,\nin fact, the plaintiff became aware of the alleged improprieties within the\nreligious community that gave rise to his causes of action for unjust\nenrichment in 1965 or 1966, some 27 years before he commenced the\naction and therefore held that the trial court properly dismissed the quasi-\ncontract claim. To the extent that German is applicable to the discovery\nrule at all, it applied the rule to invalidate rather than sustain a quasi-\ncontract claim. In the circumstances, German hardly provides us with a\nreason to predict that the New Jersey Supreme Court would apply the\ndiscovery rule to toll the accrual of a quasi-contract claim under New\nJersey law.\n\n                                    18\n\fservice has been performed.”) (citing Kramer, Levin, Nessen, Kamin\n& Frankel v. Aronoff, 638 F. Supp. 714, 722 (S.D.N.Y. 1986));\nMartin v. Camp, 114 N.E. 46 (N.Y. 1916); County of Broome v.\nBoard of Educ., 317 N.Y.S.2d 486, 489 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1971).\n\n        Baer’s rationale in urging us to adopt the discovery rule for\nquantum meruit claims is doctrinally untenable as well. He alleges\nthat “at the time Plaintiff’s services were completed, Plaintiff\nreasonably believed that remuneration for those services was\ngoverned by a contractual agreement contingent upon the success of\nthe show.” Appellant’s br. at 59. Baer therefore contends, “there is\nno possible way that Plaintiff knew or should have known that a cause\nof action had accrued until such time as The Sopranos aired on\nJanuary 10, 1999.” Id. He misunderstands the nature of a quantum\nmeruit claim with respect to the statute of limitations. “In cases based\non quasi-contract liability, the intention of the parties is entirely\ndisregarded. . . .” Callano v. Oakwood Park Homes Corp., 219 A.2d\n332, 334 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1966). In other words, Baer’s\nbelief that he was going to get paid if and when the show was a\nsuccess is irrelevant because his understanding of his oral contract,\neven if correct, does not govern his quasi-contract claim inasmuch as\na quasi-contract claim is not a “real” contract based on mutual consent\nand understanding of the parties. The essence of a quasi-contract\nclaim is not the expectancy of the parties, but rather the unjust\nenrichment of one of them. It therefore would be inappropriate to\nlook at Baer’s expectations of payment, rather than at the services he\nprovided Chase.\n\n        Zic v. Italian Government Travel Office, 149 F. Supp. 2d 473\n(N.D. Ill. 2001), addressed the question of when a cause of action\naccrued and started the running of the clock on the statute of\nlimitations in a quantum meruit suit. The plaintiff argued that his\nclaim did not begin until the defendant failed to recognize accrued\nseniority or to make retroactive salary increases to which he claimed\nentitlement. Id. at 476. The district court stated that this argument\n“misunderstands the essence of a quantum meruit claim, which is not\nthe plaintiff’s expectancy of payment, but the unjust enrichment of the\ndefendant.” Id. The court held that the cause of action accrues upon\npresentment and subsequent rejection of a bill for services, or as soon\nas the services were rendered. Id. at 475-76.\n\n       It is clear that any application of the discovery rule would be\ninappropriate in analyzing whether the statute of limitations ran on\nBaer’s quantum meruit claim. The district court was therefore correct\n\n                                  19\n\fin utilizing a last rendition of services test to analyze whether Baer’s\nclaim was time barred.\n\n        The district court, utilizing the last services rendered test, held\nthat the statute of limitations barred Baer’s quasi-contract claim based\non his deposition testimony that he last rendered services in October\n1995. The district court disregarded Baer’s later certification and the\nFebruary 10, 1997 letter, holding:\n\n                        [I]n this case, the\n                        Plaintiff’s deposition\n                        testimony regarding the\n                        date that performance\n                        was complete was a fact\n                        of crucial importance to\n                        his case, his performance\n                        and the February 10,\n                        1997 letter were the\n                        subject of extensive\n                        questioning, and the\n                        Plaintiff had access to\n                        the relevant information\n                        at the time of his\n                        deposition.\n\nBaer, 2004 WL 350050, at *9.\n\n         This disposition brings us to the second aspect of our statute of\nlimitations discussion, the “sham affidavit” doctrine. In this regard\nwe have held that a party may not create a material issue of fact to\ndefeat summary judgment by filing an affidavit disputing his or her\nown sworn testimony without demonstrating a plausible explanation\nfor the conflict. Hackman v. Valley Fair, 932 F.2d 239, 241 (3d Cir.\n1991). The “sham affidavit” doctrine refers to the trial courts’\n“practice of disregarding an offsetting affidavit that is submitted in\nopposition to a motion for summary judgment when the affidavit\ncontradicts the affiant’s prior deposition testimony.” Shelcusky v.\nGarjulio, 797 A.2d 138, 144 (N.J. 2002). When a party does not\nexplain the contradiction between the subsequent affidavit and the\nprior deposition, the alleged factual issue in dispute can be perceived\nas a “sham,” thereby not creating an impediment to a grant of\nsummary judgment based on the deposition. Id. Though the district\ncourt did not refer to the “sham affidavit” doctrine by name, it utilized\nits logic and cited precedent applying it in disregarding Baer’s\n\n                                    20\n\fcertification.\n\n       The “sham affidavit” doctrine has its roots in the Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit’s decision in Perma Research &\nDevelopment Co. v. Singer Co., 410 F.2d 572, 577-78 (2d Cir. 1969).\nThere the court, noting that the plaintiff was unable to justify an\ninconsistency between his deposition testimony and a later affidavit,\ndisregarded the affidavit and determined that summary judgment\nshould be granted against the plaintiff, explaining:\n\n                 If a party who has been examined at length on\n                 deposition could raise an issue of fact simply by\n                 submitting an affidavit contradicting his own prior\n                 testimony, this would greatly diminish the utility of\n                 summary judgment as a procedure for screening out\n                 sham issues of fact.\n\nId. at 578.\n\n        While many state and federal jurisdictions have incorporated\nthe logic of Perma in assessing subsequently filed conflicting\naffidavits following a deposition, its application has not been applied\nwithout regard for the surrounding circumstances. 11 James Wm.\nMoore, et al., Moore’s Federal Practice § 56.14[1][f] at 56-179 (3d ed.\n1997) (“If a party’s deposition and affidavit are in conflict, the\naffidavit is to be disregarded unless a legitimate reason can be given\nfor discrepancies.”). Thus, it is clear that merely because there is a\ndiscrepancy between deposition testimony and the deponent’s later\naffidavit a district court is not required in all cases to disregard the\naffidavit. Kennett-Murray Corp. v. Bone, 622 F.2d 887, 894 (5th Cir.\n1980); see Choudhry v. Jenkins, 559 F.2d 1085, 1090 (7th Cir. 1977)\n(summary judgment was improper even though party’s testimony was\n“not a paradigm of cogency or persuasiveness,” inasmuch it was not a\n“transparent sham”).\n\n        In Kennett-Murray, 622 F.2d 887, the Court of Appeals for the\nFifth Circuit declined to apply Perma and the “sham affidavit”\ndoctrine in an action in which an employer sought recovery on a\npromissory note and employment contract from a former employee.\nId. at 889. The central issue in dispute concerned “whether a genuine\nissue exist[ed] as to [a] question of fraud.” Id. at 893. The district\ncourt granted the plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment primarily\nrelying on the defendant’s deposition in which he testified that the\nplaintiff’s vice president had not made any representations about the\n\n                                    21\n\fnote or the employment contract. Id. at 892. The court, because of\ninconsistencies with the earlier testimony, disregarded a subsequently\nfiled affidavit supporting the defendant’s allegations of fraud, which\nif, considered, would have raised a material issue of fact. Id.\n\n        The court of appeals recognized that a court “cannot disregard\na party’s affidavit merely because it conflicts to some degree with an\nearlier deposition” and that “a genuine issue can exist by virtue of a\nparty’s affidavit even if it conflicts with earlier testimony of the\nparty’s deposition.” Id. at 893. In reversing the summary judgment\norder, it held that the subsequent affidavit was in fact not a “sham,” as\nthe defendant’s affidavit did not claim to raise a new or distinct\nmatter, but rather explained certain aspects of his deposition\ntestimony that caused confusion. Id. at 894. The court additionally\nrelied on the fact that the affidavit could not be said to constitute a\nreformulation of the defendant’s general defense nor was it at odds\nwith the general theory he put forth in the deposition. Id. at 894-95.\n\n         In Martin v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 851 F.2d 703\n(3d Cir. 1998), the plaintiff was the mother of a child born with birth\ndefects who made eight sworn factual statements tending to negate the\ndefendant drug manufacturer’s liability. Later, facing an almost\ncertain loss on summary judgment, she submitted a flatly\ncontradictory affidavit which did not contain an explanation for her\nchange in position. We adopted the logic of Perma, and held that the\ndistrict court properly could ignore the later affidavit. We, however,\ndid recognize that “there are situations in which sworn testimony can\nquite properly be corrected by a subsequent affidavit. . .[and] [w]here\nthe witness was confused at the earlier deposition or for some other\nreason misspoke, the subsequent correcting or clarifying affidavit may\nbe sufficient to create a material dispute of fact.” Id. at 705.\n\n        Baer argues that his deposition statement was “clearly, and\nunderstandably, mistaken,” reasoning that “he was thinking in terms\nof the overwhelming majority of his services.” Appellant’s br. at 62.\nThe district court refused to accept Baer’s “mistake” argument,\nrelying on the fact that the matter that was of critical importance to his\nclaim and the subject of repeated questioning. Baer, 2004 WL\n350050, at *9.\n\n        If Baer had advanced only the argument that he had made a\nmistake, exclusion of the later certification might have been\nappropriate. The district court, however, overlooked the importance\nof the evidence existing in the record, i.e., the February 10, 1997 letter\n\n                                   22\n\fthat buttressed Baer’s subsequent certification. We therefore must\naddress the question of whether corroborating evidence as to the\nsubstance of a later certification ameliorates the concerns that gave\nrise to the “sham affidavit” doctrine, thereby allowing a subsequent\ncompeting affidavit to create a dispute as to a genuine issue of a\nmaterial fact.\n\n        When there is independent evidence in the record to bolster an\notherwise questionable affidavit, courts generally have refused to\ndisregard the affidavit. See Bushell v. Wackenhut Int'l, Inc., 731 F.\nSupp. 1574, 1578 (S.D. Fla. 1990) (third party’s deposition testimony\ncan lend credence to subsequent affidavit). The Court of Appeals for\nthe Second Circuit has held the introduction of evidence can help\nrebut a charge of a “sham” affidavit. Thus, in Palazzo ex rel.\nDelmage v. Corio, 232 F.3d 38, 43-44 (2d Cir. 2000), the same court\nthat had decided Perma recognized that “a party’s deposition\ntestimony as to a given fact does not foreclose a trial or an evidentiary\nhearing where that testimony is contradicted by evidence other than\nthe deponent’s subsequent affidavit, for when such other evidence is\navailable, the concern that the proffered issue of fact is a mere ‘sham’\nis alleviated.” The court held that the district court properly allowed a\nparty to introduce documentary evidence to support his residency\nclaims contrary to his deposition. The Court of Appeals for the Tenth\nCircuit reached a similar conclusion in Delany v. Deere & Co., 219\nF.3d 1195, 1996 n.1 (10th Cir. 2000), in which it stated that, “[w]hile\na party may not defeat summary judgment by contradicting deposition\ntestimony in a subsequent affidavit, new evidence may furnish a good\nfaith basis for the inconsistency.”\n\n        Baer’s ability to point to evidence in the record that\ncorroborates his later affidavit alleviates the concern that he merely\nfiled an erroneous certification out of desperation to avoid summary\njudgment. Moreover, Chase does not deny receiving the letter and his\npersonal assistant told Baer that Chase, in fact, had received the letter.\nAnd finally, Chase himself has provided the letter in discovery.\nGiven this evidence which corroborates the certification, the concern\nthat Baer’s claim that he performed services as late as February 10,\n1997, is either desperate or erroneous is eliminated, and therefore the\ncourt should have analyzed the letter and the circumstances\nsurrounding it and Baer’s certification when ruling on the summary\n\n\n\n\n                                   23\n\fjudgment motion on the statute of limitations issue.5 The district\ncourt therefore erred, at least procedurally, in granting Chase’s\nsummary judgment motion based on the statute of limitations with\nrespect to Baer’s quantum meruit claim. We therefore will reverse the\nsummary judgment on this point and will remand the question of\nwhether Baer presented a timely and otherwise valid quasi-contract\n\n\n\n\n       5\n         Chase argues that even if we refuse to disregard the February 10,\n1997 letter, “the letter cannot be characterized as a compensable\n‘service’ as a matter of law.” Appellees’ br. at 42. Chase contends that\nwe should disregard the February letter on two grounds, the first of\nwhich is its timing. Chase did not receive the letter until some 14\nmonths after he mailed the screenplay to Baer, as well as after all the\nmajor networks had rejected the draft. Chase argues that even if the\nletter had value at one time, it had no value to him when he actually\nreceived it. Second, Chase argues that the letter had no value to him as\nit contained only cursory observations and laudatory phrases about his\nwork. Chase premises his argument on the assumption that in analyzing\nthe statute of limitations for quantum meruit purposes we should dissect\nthe last service rendered to deem if it provided value to the opposing\nparty.\n\n        We will not affirm the summary judgment on this basis. First,\nBaer’s letter describes the aspects of the screenplay that he believes were\nsuccessful, the parts to which he related personally, and what humor\nworked, and provided encouragement to continue with the project. App.\nat 22. We will not write these contributions off, as Chase attempts to do,\nas “empty flattery.”\n\n         Additionally, we will not dissect each interaction between\nlitigants to quantify the precise value of each correspondence or service\nrendered. The exchange of ideas and services should not be viewed as\nincremental, segregable interactions that we can assess individually for\npurposes of the statute of limitations. A separate issue would arise if a\nlitigant sent a correspondence or rendered a “sham service” in an attempt\nto avoid the statute. That situation, however, does not describe the\ncircumstances before us. We will not engage in Chase’s request to judge\nwhether the February letter, taken in isolation, was a “compensable\nservice.” We are satisfied that Baer sent the letter and Chase received it,\nand thus at least at this time it will serve as the “last service rendered”\nfor purposes of the statute of limitations calculus.\n\n                                    24\n\fclaim to the district court for further consideration.6\n\n                   C. Baer’s Misappropriation Claim\n\n        Baer next raises the issue of whether the district court erred in\nholding that the fact that the ideas he advanced existed in the public\ndomain precluded those ideas, alone or in combination, from\npossessing the requisite novelty so that their use cannot be the basis\nfor a claim for common law idea misappropriation. The cause of\naction of “misappropriation” is based on tort principles rather than on\ncontract law. Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition § 40, cmt. a.\nThe premise behind the tort is that when a party misappropriates\nanother’s confidential idea or some other type of property, the law\nimposes an obligation on that party to pay the other restitution for its\nimproper use. Id.; Duffy, 124 F. Supp. 2d at 808.\n\n       There is no dispute between the parties that this case is\ngoverned by the leading precedent on the misappropriation of ideas in\nNew Jersey, Flemming v. Ronson Corp., 258 A.2d 153, 156-57 (N.J.\nSuper. Ct. Law Div. 1969), aff’d, 275 A.2d 759 (N.J. Super. Ct. App.\nDiv. 1971); see also Ahlert v. Hasbro, Inc., 325 F. Supp. 2d 509, 513\nn.6 (D.N.J. 2004) (citing Flemming test in misappropriation claim);\nJohnson v. Benjamin Moore & Co., 788 A.2d 906, 914 (N.J. Super.\nCt. App. Div. 2002) (same); The court in Flemming articulated the\n\n\n        6\n         We do not consider whether Baer was entitled to summary\njudgment with respect to the timeliness of his quasi-contract claim. In\nthis regard we point out that Baer did not move for summary judgment\nin the district court. While it is not unusual for us when reversing a\nsummary judgment for one party to direct that the district court grant\nsummary judgment to the other party, ordinarily, at least, we do this in\ncircumstances in which the parties made cross-motions for summary\njudgment in the district court. See, e.g., Nazay v. Miller, 949 F.3d 1323,\n1327-28 (3d Cir. 1991); First Nat’l Bank v. Lincoln Nat’l Life Ins. Co.,\n824 F.2d 277, 281-82 (3d Cir. 1987). Accordingly, we go no further\nwith respect to the statute of limitations issue than to hold that the\ndistrict court should not have disregarded Baer’s certification and it\nshould have considered the February 10, 1997 letter. Therefore our\nanalysis in supra note 5, will not preclude the district court on a fuller\nexamination of the facts from coming to a conclusion contrary to ours as\nwe write on the point merely for the limited purpose of addressing\nChase’s argument that we should affirm the summary judgment on a\ndifferent basis than that of the district court.\n\n                                    25\n\ftest for determining whether the law will imply an obligation to pay\nfor a confidentially submitted idea: When “a person communicates a\nnovel idea to another with the intention that the latter may use the idea\nand compensate him for such use, the other party is liable for such use\nand must pay compensation if . . . (1) the idea was novel; (2) it was\nmade in confidence [to the defendant]; and (3) it was adopted and\nmade use of [by the defendant in connection with his own activities].”\nFlemming, 258 A.2d at 156-57 (citing Mitchell Novelty Co. v.\nUnited Mfg. Co., 199 F.2d 462 (7th Cir. 1952); De Filippis v.\nChrysler Corp., 53 F. Supp. 977 (S.D.N.Y. 1944), aff’d, 159 F.2d 478\n(2d Cir. 1947); Official Airlines Schedule Info. Serv., Inc. v. Eastern\nAir Lines, Inc., 333 F.2d 672 (5th Cir. 1964)).\n\n        Thus, the misappropriation issue on appeal is whether the\nideas Baer provided were novel. While novelty is clearly a\nprerequisite to establish a misappropriation claim in New Jersey,\nJohnson, 788 A.2d at 914-15, the courts have not articulated clearly\nthe test for determining whether an idea is sufficiently novel to\nwarrant protection. See Duffy, 123 F. Supp. 2d at 808. Two leading\ncases dealing with the parameters of New Jersey misappropriation law\narose in federal courts deciding state law issues, Duffy, 123 F. Supp.\n2d 802, and Bergin v. Century 21 Real Estate Corp., No. 98 Civ.\n8075, 2000 WL 223833 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 25, 2000), aff’d, 234 F.3d\n1261 (2d Cir. 2000) (table).\n\n        As the district court noted in Duffy, it is unclear whether the\nissue of novelty is “an issue of fact, for the fact finder, a question of\nlaw, for the jury or a mixed question of fact and law.” Duffy, 123 F.\nSupp. 2d at 808. The Flemming opinion followed a bench trial so\nsuch a determination was unnecessary. Flemming, 788 A.2d at 154.\nThe district court in Bergin, though deciding the case under New\nJersey law, looked to New York law and held that “[w]hether an idea\nis novel is an issue of law which may be decided on a motion for\nsummary judgment.” Bergin, 2000 WL 223833, at *9. The Duffy\ncourt held that the “New Jersey Supreme Court would determine that\nalthough some of the factors relevant to a determination of novelty\nmay be factual, the ultimate determination of whether an idea is novel\nis a question of law for the court.” 123 F. Supp. 2d at 809. Duffy\nrelied on the similarities to a court’s role with respect to\n“obviousness” in patent cases, citing Ryko Mfg. Co. v. Nu-Star, Inc.,\n950 F.2d 714, 716 (Fed. Cir. 1991), and cases holding that the\n“novelty” determination is a matter of law. See Duffy, 123 F. Supp.\n2d at 809 (citing extensive list of cases that hold that the\ndetermination of novelty is a question of law). Additionally, Duffy\n\n                                   26\n\findicated that “even courts holding that the question is a factual one\nhave not hesitated to grant summary judgment on the basis of lack of\nnovelty when the underlying facts do not support a finding of\nnovelty.” Id. (citing Wilson v. Barton & Ludwig, Inc., 296 S.E.2d 74,\n78 (Ga. Ct. App. 1982)). We believe that the district court here was\ncorrect in its conclusion as to how the New Jersey Supreme Court\nwould decide this issue and it is therefore necessary to determine the\n“novelty” of Baer’s contribution.\n\n        The predicates on which a property right in an idea may be\nbased are novelty and originality. See Downey v. General Foods\nCorp., 286 N.E.2d 257, 259 (N.Y. 1974). A misappropriation claim,\nunlike a contract-based claim, only can arise from the taking of an\nidea that is original or novel because the law of property does not\nprotect against the appropriation of that which is free and available to\nall. Nadel, 208 F.3d at 378. Therefore, anyone may use ideas in the\npublic domain freely with impunity. See Ed Graham Prods., Inc. v.\nNational Broad. Co., 347 N.Y.S.2d 766 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1973).\n\n        The district court here acknowledged Duffy’s observation that\nthe law of “unfair competition ‘is an amorphous area of\njurisprudence’ and ‘knows of no clear boundaries.’” Baer, 2004 WL\n350050, at *12 (citing Duffy, 123 F. Supp. 2d at 815). For example,\nthe court in Duffy noted that the Flemming court, “did not discuss a\nspecific test that should be used to determine whether an idea is\nnovel.” Duffy, 123 F. Supp. 2d at 809.\n\n         The present facts, however, do not compel us to set forth a\nbroad description of what is novel in our disposition of Baer’s\nmisappropriation claim. Though Flemming did not articulate a test\nfor affirmatively determining when an idea is “novel,” the court did\ncite examples of ideas that would not be novel. The Flemming court\nrecognized that even an otherwise novel idea would lose its novelty if\nit was “in the domain of public knowledge” before the defendant used\nit. Flemming, 258 A.2d at 157-58. The Duffy court expanded on this\nconclusion by noting “[a]n idea will not satisfy [the novelty\nrequirement] if it is not significantly different from, or is an obvious\nadaptation or combination of ideas in the public domain.” Duffy, 123\nF. Supp. 2d at 810. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit,\napplying New Jersey law, also noted in Bergin v. Century 21 Real\nEstate Corp., 234 F.3d 1261 (2d Cir. 2000) (table), available at 2000\nWL 1678777, at *3, that “[s]ummary judgment is appropriate where\nthe defendant knew of the idea or the idea was ‘a matter[] in the\ndomain of public knowledge before the plaintiff disclosed it to the\n\n                                   27\n\fdefendant.’” Other jurisdictions have taken like positions. See\nEducational Sales Programs, Inc. v. Dreyfus Corp., 317 N.Y.S.2d 840,\n844 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1970) (“The idea need not reflect the ‘flash of\ngenius,’ but it must shown genuine novelty and invention, and not a\nmerely clever or useful adaptation of existing knowledge.”); Oasis\nMusic, Inc. v. 900 U.S.A., Inc., 614 N.Y.S. 2d 878, 882-84 (N.Y. Sup.\nCt. 1994) (declining to attribute novelty where ideas were variations\nand adaptations of existing knowledge in the public domain). We\nconclude, similarly, that the New Jersey Supreme Court, if addressed\nwith the issue, would hold that ideas lose their novelty if they are in\nthe domain of public knowledge before use. Such ideas cannot be\nmisappropriated.\n\n        Baer admits that all of the locations he identified to Chase\nexist in the public domain.7 In addition, many of the stories and\npotential plot lines that Baer “provided” Chase existed in the public\nrecord.8 Moreover, as the district court noted, the additional ideas and\nstories that Baer claims were misappropriated were not his stories;\n“associates” of Baer actually told them to Chase:\n\n                      In particular, the Plaintiff seeks\n               compensation for Spirito’s story of\n               rivalry with his uncles in the aftermath\n               of his father's death, that Koczur’s\n               account to Chase that many waste\n               management companies were alleged to\n               be involved with organized crime,\n               Spirito’s story of his experiences with a\n               ‘loan shark’ and Jones’s description of\n               the way in which organized crime uses\n               loan shark debts to take over a business,\n\n\n       7\n       Baer “introduced” Chase to the City of Elizabeth, The Pulaski\nSkyway, and Centanni’s Meat Market.\n       8\n        For example, Baer relayed the following stories to Chase: the\nRCA and Morris Levy “scam,” which was the subject of a published\nbook; information regarding the DeCavalcante family and organized\ncrime which existed in public lure of New Jersey; and wire taps that\nwere part of the public record having been played at a criminal trial. We\nnote that Morris Levy, an individual Jones discussed, and who is a\nprominent figure in the parties’ briefs, is not unknown to this court. See\nUnited States v. Vastola, 915 F.2d 865, 868 (3d Cir. 1990).\n\n                                   28\n\f               Jones’s description of the operation of\n               ‘cutout’ schemes used by organized\n               crime, Koczur’s information regarding\n               the involvement of the DeCavalcante\n               crime family in Saint Anthony's Church\n               in Elizabeth, and a story told to Chase\n               by Jones about Morris Levy's horse\n               farm.\n\nBaer, 2004 WL 350050, at *13 (emphasis added). It is clear that\nvirtually all of Baer’s alleged contributions either existed in the public\ndomain or concerned stories and facts he did not provide.\n\n        Baer argues that he did not simply introduce these third-parties\nto Chase, but rather “the majority of ideas were suggested by Plaintiff\nprior to the meeting.” Appellant’s br. at 67. Baer alleges that his\naggregating and combining of ideas was essential in “put[ting] it all\ntogether” and “creat[ing] the ‘template’ for The Sopranos.”\nAppellant’s br. at 66. Baer alleges that it is “their combination that\ngives these ideas originality.” Id. at 68. In other words, Baer’s\ncontribution in essence was “choosing” which ideas, existing in the\npublic domain, he would present to Chase.\n\n        Aggregation of ideas and expression do not by themselves\ncreate novelty. In Duffy the plaintiff argued that “its idea was novel\nbecause [it] spent many months deciding the organization and layout\nof the data so its products could be readily understood by\nnonprofessional investors. . . . [It] stated that it was the format that\nmade Duffy’s reports unique and proprietary to [it].” 123 F. Supp. 2d\nat 812. The plaintiff in Duffy took data, fields and information in the\npublic domain and organized them to create a “mutual fund report\ncard.” Id. The court held that, though the organization and layout of\nthe data may involve some originality, this articulation of originality\nwent more to an idea’s expression than to the idea itself. Id. It is\nwell-established that an idea’s expression is not entitled to protection\nunder a state’s misappropriation law. Id. As the court in Duffy\nrecognized, “To the extent a state’s law purports to impose liability\nfor the misappropriation of an idea’s expression, such a law would be\npreempted by federal copyright law.” Duffy, 123 F. Supp. 2d at 812\nn.5 (citing 17 U.S.C. § 106; Wilson v. Mr. Tee’s, 855 F. Supp. 679,\n684-85 (D.N.J. 1994); Rowe v. Golden W. Television Prods., 445\nA.2d 1165 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1982)). Despite Baer’s\ncreativity in combining stories and facts existing in the public domain,\nNew Jersey does not protect this mode of originality under its\n\n                                   29\n\fmisappropriation law. Thus, the district court correctly granted Chase\nsummary judgment on Baer’s misappropriation claim.\n\n            D. District Court’s Exclusion of Expert Report\n\n        The final issue raised on appeal is whether the district court\nabused its discretion by excluding Baer’s expert report from\nconsideration on issues of liability. Early in the litigation, the court\nbifurcated the case into liability and damage phases, with expert\ndiscovery not being contemplated or authorized by any scheduling\norder. Baer’s attorney later retained John Agoglia as an “expert\nwitness” regarding “the damages aspect of case” to be used by Baer\n“should [Defendant] raise an issue regarding the calculation of\ndamages at summary judgment.” App. at 902, 914.\n\n         Faced with the summary judgment motion, Baer attempted to\ninclude Agoglia’s report which stated “a contribution of such ideas\nand services [as those made by Baer] toward the creation of a\ntelevision series such as The Sopranos . . . would commonly be\nrewarded with fixed payments and/or production bonuses and or a\nsliding scale of profit participation and/or screen credits in recognition\nof such contributions, or any combination thereof.” App. at 27. The\ndistrict court excluded Agoglia’s report based on the fact that he was\nnot presented as a liability expert and that his report did not opine on\nliability. App. at 175.\n\n         The district court did not abuse its discretion by disregarding\nthe report with respect to a summary judgment motion focusing solely\non issues of liability. Agoglia was not presented as an expert on\nliability. We agree with the court’s assessment that, “I don’t see how\nsomebody who was put forth under Rule 26 as a damages expert is\ngoing to be able to bootstrap liability issues into a summary judgment\nmotion.” App. at 196. The damage expert’s testimony had no\nrelevance to the questions of formation or enforceability of the\npurported contract. Chase named Agoglia to be an expert witness on\ndamages; his opinions with respect to liability are simply beside the\npoint.\n\n         Baer’s brief allocates little space in presenting an argument as\nto how the court erred in excluding the damages report from the\nliability phase of the trial. Bear clearly presented Agoglia as a\ndamages expert to the district court and his adversary. The court did\nnot err in refusing Baer’s attempts to “bootstrap” a damages witness\nwho repeatedly agreed that he had no legal training to testify as an\n\n                                    30\n\fexpert on liability.\n\n\n\n                          IV. CONCLUSION\n\n         Inasmuch as the district court erroneously disregarded Baer’s\ncertification, which, if considered, might have precluded the grant of\nsummary judgment on the quantum meruit claim on a statute of\nlimitations basis, we will reverse the order of the district court entered\nFebruary 20, 2004, and remand the case for further proceedings in the\ndistrict court solely on that claim. Otherwise we will affirm the order\nof February 20, 2004. The parties will bear their own costs in this\nappeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                   31\n\f",

Baer’s\n(“Baer”) appeal from an order of the district court entered February\n20, 2004, granting summary judgment to the defendants, David Chase\nand DC Enterprises, Inc. (together called “Chase”), pursuant to\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c). This dispute centers on the\ncreation and development of the well-known television series, The\nSopranos. Through this action, Baer seeks compensation for what he\nperceives was his role in the creation and development of the popular\nand financially successful television series.\n\n\n\n           I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n\n\n         Chase, who originally was from New Jersey, but relocated to\nLos Angeles in 1971, is the creator, producer, writer and director of\nThe Sopranos. Chase has numerous credits for other television\nproductions as well. Before Chase met Baer, Chase had worked on a\nnumber of projects involving organized crime activities based in New\nJersey, including a script for “a mob boss in therapy,” a concept that,\nin part, would become the basis for The Sopranos.\n\n       In 1995, Chase was producing and directing a Rockford Files\n“movie-of-the–week” when he met Joseph Urbancyk who was\nworking on the set as a camera operator and temporary director of\nphotography. Chase mentioned to Urbancyk that he was looking for\nnew material and for writers who could develop feature film\n\n\n                                   2\n\fscreenplays that Chase later might re-write and direct. Urbancyk\nalso overheard Chase say that the creators of The Rockford Files were\nlooking to assign additional writers for their “movie of the week”\nproject.\n\n         Urbancyk became the connection between Chase and Baer as a\nresult of Urbancyk’s long-time friendship with Baer and his\nknowledge of Baer’s interest in pursuing a career in writing, directing\nand producing. Baer, who was a New Jersey attorney, recently had\nleft his employment in the Union County Prosecutor’s Office in\nElizabeth, New Jersey, where he had worked for the previous six\nyears.\n\n        Urbancyk urged Baer to write a script for The Rockford Files.\nBaer did so and gave it to Urbancyk who passed it on to Chase. Chase\nconsidered Baer’s work “interesting” and asked Urbancyk if Baer had\nany plans to be in Los Angeles. Upon hearing of Chase’s interest,\nBaer flew to Los Angeles to meet with Chase.\n\n        Chase, Urbancyk and Baer met for lunch on June 20, 1995. At\nthat time Chase informed Baer that he would be unable to use Baer’s\nscreenplay, as the remaining slots in The Rockford Files had been\nfilled. The lunch continued, however, with Baer describing his\nexperience as a prosecutor. Baer also pitched the idea to shoot “a film\nor television shows about the New Jersey Mafia.” App. at 40. At that\ntime Baer was unaware of Chase’s previous work involving mob\nactivity premised in New Jersey. At the lunch there was no reference\nto any payment that Chase might make to Baer for the latter’s services\nand the parties agree that they did not reach any agreement on that\nday.\n\n        In October 1995, Chase visited New Jersey for three days.\nDuring this “research visit” Baer arranged meetings for Chase with\nDetective Thomas Koczur, Detective Robert A. Jones, and Tony\nSpirito who provided Chase with information, material and personal\nstories about their experiences with organized crime. Koczur served\nas a tour guide and drove Chase and Baer to various locations in\nnorthern New Jersey. Koczur also arranged a lunch between Chase\nand Spirito. Spirito told true and sometimes personal stories\ninvolving loan sharking, a power struggle with two uncles involving a\nfamily business, and two individuals, Big Pussy and Little Pussy\n\n\n\n\n                                  3\n\fRusso.1 Chase also met with Jones, a detective with the Union\nCounty Prosecutor’s office who had experience investigating\norganized crime. Baer does not dispute that virtually all of the ideas\nand locations that he “contributed” to Chase existed in the public\nrecord.\n\n        After returning to Los Angeles, Chase sent Baer a copy of a\ndraft of a Sopranos screenplay that he had written, which was dated\nDecember 20, 1995. Baer asserts that after he read it he called Chase\nand made various comments with regard to it. Baer claims that the\ntwo spoke at least four times during the following year and that he\nsent a letter to Chase dated February 10, 1997, discussing The\nSopranos script. Baer ensured that Chase received the letter by\nconfirming its arrival with Chase’s assistant. On this appeal we\naccept Baer’s allegations regarding his input into The Sopranos draft.\n\n        Notwithstanding his February 10, 1997 letter, at his deposition\nBaer claimed that he last rendered services to Chase in 1995. Thus,\nBaer’s testimony included the following:\n\n                       Q. During any of those\n                       conversations after\n                       October of 1995, [when\n                       Chase visited New\n                       Jersey] did you provide\n                       any further information\n                       to Mr. Chase other than\n                       in relation to the sexual\n                       assault?\n\n                       A. Not really.\n\n                       Q. No?\n\n                       A. Not really. The\n                       screen play was done and\n                       there wasn’t really any\n                       need for it at that point\n                       as far as I knew.\n\n\n\n       1\n        These or similar story lines and characters have appeared in\nepisodes of The Sopranos.\n\n                                   4\n\f                           Q. So everything that\n                           you had done and to\n                           which you claim\n                           entitlement was done by\n                           the end of October 1995?\n\n                           A. Yes in terms of\n                           assisting him in helping\n                           with this project that\n                           would be true.\n\nApp. at 343-44.2 Notwithstanding this testimony, in Baer’s later\ncertification dated October 3, 2003, in opposition to Chase’s motion\nfor summary judgment he sought to clarify his deposition testimony,\nstating:\n\n                           117. I also sent him a\n                           letter dated February 10,\n                           1997 discussing the\n                           Sopranos script prior to\n                           making a trip to Los\n                           Angeles. After sending\n                           the letter, I spoke with\n                           Chase’s assistant, Kelly\n                           Kockzak, who confirmed\n                           that Chase had received\n                           it. This letter represents\n                           the last services I\n                           provided to Defendants.\n                           Most of my services\n                           were provided in 1995.\n\nApp. at 69.\n\n         Baer asserts that he and Chase orally agreed on three separate\noccasions that if the show became a success, Chase would “take care\nof” Baer, and “remunerate [Baer] in a manner commensurate to the\ntrue value of [his services].” App. at 113. According to Baer, he and\nChase first made this oral agreement on the telephone during one of\ntheir first two or three conversations during the summer of 1995. The\n\n\n        2\n            The reference to the “sexual assault” is not material to the issues\nhere.\n\n                                        5\n\fsecond occasion was on the telephone and occurred immediately prior\nto Chase’s October 1995 visit to New Jersey. The third time the\nparties reached the agreement was in person when they met in New\nJersey in October 1995.\n\n         Baer claims that on each of these occasions the parties had the\nsame conversation in which Chase offered to pay Baer, stating “you\nhelp me; I pay you.” App. at 112-13. Baer always rejected Chase’s\noffer, reasoning that Chase would be unable to pay him “for the true\nvalue of the services [Baer] was rendering.” Id. Each time Baer\nrejected Chase’s offer he did so with a counteroffer, “that I would\nperform the services while assuming the risk that if the show failed\n[Chase] would owe me nothing. If, however, the show succeeded he\nwould remunerate me in a manner commensurate to the true value of\nmy services.” Id. at 113. Baer acknowledges that this counteroffer,\nwhich in these proceedings we treat as having become the parties’\nagreement, always was oral and did not include any fixed term of\nduration or price. There is no other evidence in the record of any\nother discussion between Baer and Chase regarding the terms of the\ncontract. For purposes of the motion for summary judgment, Chase\naccepts Baer’s version of the events as true and thus concedes there\nwas an oral agreement to the extent that Baer sets it forth.\nNotwithstanding this agreement, insofar as we can ascertain, other\nthan Baer’s calls to Chase after he received the Sopranos script, the\nnext time Baer heard anything from or about Chase was when he\nreceived a phone call from Detective Koczur telling him that Chase\nwas in Elizabeth shooting The Sopranos. In fact, Chase has not paid\nBaer for his services.\n\n        On or about May 15, 2002, Baer filed a verified complaint\nagainst Chase in the district court and thereafter on May 2, 2003, Baer\nfiled an amended verified complaint. Baer’s amended complaint\nadvanced ten claims: (1) breach of contract; (2) breach of implied\ncontract; (3) breach of quasi-contract; (4) common law fraud; (5)\nequitable fraud; (6) negligent misrepresentation; (7) breach of\nfiduciary duty; (8) unfair competition under section 43(a) of the\nLanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125; (9) unfair competition and\nmisappropriation under N.J. Stat. Ann. § 56:4-1 (West 2001); and\n(10) tortious interference with prospective economic advantage. App.\nat 137-48. Baer subsequently withdrew the federal unfair competition\n\n\n\n\n                                   6\n\fclaim.3 Eventually Chase brought a motion for summary judgment\nunder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c) alleging that there was no\ngenuine issue as to any material fact and he was entitled to a judgment\nas a matter of law. Chase claimed that the alleged contract and\nimplied contract were too vague, ambiguous and lacking in essential\nterms to be enforced and the statute of frauds barred the actions based\non them. Moreover, Chase claimed that the statute of limitations\nbarred the breach of quasi-contract quantum meruit claim. Finally,\nChase alleged that each of Baer’s six remaining claims was lacking in\nmerit. Baer did not file a cross-motion for complete or partial\nsummary judgment.\n\n        The district court granted Chase’s motion, concluding that\nthere was no genuine issue of material fact with respect to any of\nBaer’s claims. The district court held with respect to the claims raised\non this appeal that: the contract claims were unenforceable due to\nvagueness, uncertainty, and the lack of essential terms in the contract;\nthe statute of limitations barred the quasi-contract claim; and the\nmisappropriation tort claim was without merit due to a lack of\nnovelty. In addition, the district court made certain rulings with\nrespect to evidence that we describe below which Baer challenges.\n\n\n\n       II.   JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n         The district court exercised diversity jurisdiction pursuant to\n28 U.S.C. § 1332 in that the parties were of diverse citizenship and\nthe amount in controversy exceeded $75,000 exclusive of interest and\ncosts. Our jurisdiction is founded on 28 U.S.C. § 1291, as this timely\nappeal is from a final order of the district court granting Chase’s\nmotion for summary judgment. We make a plenary review of the\ndistrict court’s order granting summary judgment to Chase. See\n\n\n        3\n         The district court indicated that Baer partially withdrew his\nfederal and state unfair competition and misappropriation claims, Baer\nv. Chase, No. Civ.

See app. at 34. Yet the\ncourt discussed the state unfair competition and misappropriation claim\nat length, id. at *12-14, and rejected them on the merits. Moreover, the\nparties substantively have briefed the misappropriation claim so we\nregard it as still in the case.\n\n                                    7\n\fFakete v.

Baer’s Implied-In-Fact Contract Claim\n\n        Baer predicates his contract claim on this appeal on an\nimplied-in-fact contract rather than on the oral agreement he reached\nwith Chase. The issue with respect to the implied-in-fact contract\nclaim concerns whether Chase and Baer entered into an enforceable\ncontract for services Baer rendered that aided in the creation and\nproduction of The Sopranos. In the district court Baer offered two\nalternative theories in which a purported contract was formed: the\n“oral agreement/success contingency” and an implied-in-fact contract.\n\n        The parties agree for purposes of the summary judgment\nmotion that there was a contingent oral agreement providing for Chase\nto compensate Baer, depending on Chase’s “success,” in exchange for\nthe aid Baer provided in the creation and production of The Sopranos.\nAs we noted above, the parties reached the oral agreement in three\nexchanges in which Baer proposed: “that I would perform the services\nwhile assuming the risk that if the show failed [Chase] would owe me\nnothing. If, however, the show succeeded he would remunerate me in\na manner commensurate to the true value of my services.” App. at\n113. As we have indicated, for purposes of the summary judgment\nmotion only, Chase accepts this version of the events so we will\nregard the existence of the oral agreement as not in dispute.\n\n        The district court held, and Baer concedes on appeal, that this\noral agreement was “too vague to be enforced” as an express contract.\nAppellant’s br. at 30-31; see Baer v.

This\ndescription of the oral agreement leaves at issue Baer’s contention that\nthe district court overlooked the existence of an enforceable implied-\nin-fact contract, rendering Chase liable for the services that Baer\n\n\n                                   8\n\fprovided.\n\n               1. The Distinction Between Express And Implied–In-\n                  Fact Contracts\n\n        The distinction between express and implied contracts rests on\nalternative methods of contract formation. Contracts are “express”\nwhen the parties state their terms and “implied” when the parties do\nnot state their terms. The distinction is based not on the contracts’\nlegal effect but on the way the parties manifest their mutual assent. In\nre Penn. Cent. Transp.

In other words, the terms “express” and “implied” do\nnot denote different kinds of contracts, but rather reference the\nevidence by which the parties demonstrate their agreement.

There is only one contract at issue,\nChase’s promise to compensate Baer for services he rendered which\naided in the creation and production of The Sopranos. Chase’s\nstipulation that there was such a contract has the consequence of\nmaking Baer’s attempts to label this agreement “implied” rather than\n“express” to advance a distinction without a difference as the mode of\ncontract formation, as we will explain, is immaterial to the disposition\nof the breach of contract claim. In other words, inasmuch as the\nparties agree for purposes of these summary judgment proceedings\nthat there was an agreement, the manner in which they formed the\ncontract is immaterial because different legal consequences do not\nflow from analyzing the alleged contract as implied-in-fact rather than\nexpress.

The\ngovernment later claimed that Penn Central performed unauthorized\nwork, resulting in the overpayment of $22.3 million to it. The\ngovernment argued that the Act dictated the specific and limited\nmanner in which the government loan money could be utilized, and,\naccordingly, sought return of its funding expended on “unauthorized”\nactivities.\n\n         In response, Penn Central put forth an interpretation of the Act\nin which the alleged unauthorized activities would have been\nacceptable under its requirements. In the alternative, it maintained\nthat it had an entered into a separate and enforceable implied-in-fact\ncontract with the government to continue using these funds for the\nactivities in which it was engaged, even if they were deemed outside\nthe scope of the Act. Id. at 1225.\n\n        We focused on and disallowed the railroad’s attempt to prove\nthe existence of both express and implied-in-fact agreements dealing\nwith the same subject. We stated, “no implied-in-fact contract may be\nfound when, as here, the parties have an express agreement dealing\nwith the same subject.” Id. at 1229. The operative principle here and\nin Penn Central Transportation Company is the same. As noted\nabove, there is only one agreement at issue in the present case,\n\n\n                                   10\n\fChase’s promise to pay Baer for the services he rendered. Chase\nconcedes the existence of the oral express agreement as alleged by\nBaer. Consequently, the fundamental contract law principle that\nimplied and express contacts are mutually exclusive forecloses Baer’s\nattempt to establish that there was an implied-in-fact contract.\n\n           New Jersey law, applicable here, recognizes the mutual\nexclusivity of express and implied contracts.

Cl. 1976) (“The implied contract,\nif it is to be valid, must be entirely unrelated to the express contract.\nThe existence of an express contract precludes the existence of an\nimplied contract dealing with the same subject.”).\n\n        Baer’s alleged implied-in-fact contract, however, rather than\nbeing distinct from or unrelated to the express oral contract is\nidentical to it. The stipulated oral agreement included Chase’s\npromise to compensate Baer for the services and ideas that Baer\nprovided Chase. Baer now asks that we find an implied-in-fact\ncontract that subjects Chase to liability for the very same undertaking.\nBaer provides a litany of facts which indicate that Chase may have\nused his services or prospered from his ideas. Nevertheless, in light\nof Chase’s stipulation to the existence of an agreement governing this\nsubject matter, this evidence is immaterial to the issues raised by the\nsummary judgment motion with respect to Baer’s attempt to establish\nthat there was an implied-in-fact contract between the parties.\n\n        The question is not whether Chase entered into an agreement\nwith Baer or whether Chase utilized his ideas. We already deem these\nmatters, for the purposes of the motion for summary judgment and\nthis appeal, as established. The question is whether Chase’s non-\nverbal actions prove there was a contract distinct from the express\nagreement or expanding on the terms of the agreement to make it\n\n\n                                   11\n\fenforceable. The answer is clearly that the actions do not do so. The\nalleged implied-in-fact contract completely mirrors the acknowledged\nexpress contract’s subject matter. Baer nowhere demonstrates that the\nsubject matter of the alleged implied-in-fact contract is distinct, more\ndefinite in terms of price and duration, or covers a subject matter\ndivergent from the oral agreement. The district court, therefore,\nwould have erred if it had analyzed this case on the basis that there\nwas a separate implied-in-fact contract distinct from the express\ncontract that governed the identical subject matter.\n\n               2. Definitiveness As To Price and Duration In An\n                  “Idea Submission” Case\n\n        Even assuming that Baer had been able to demonstrate that he\nhad an implied-in-fact contract with Chase, his contention that an\nimplied-in-fact contract claim in an idea submission case need not be\ndefinite as to price and duration, would be incorrect. Baer asserts that\nthe district court’s holding “that the absence of a price and duration\nterm render[s] an implied contract in an idea submission scenario too\nvague to be enforced . . . is contrary to the law in virtually every\njurisdiction that has ever considered the issue.” Appellant’s br. at 34.\nBaer’s claim fails on three grounds: (1) there is no distinction\nbetween express and implied contracts, aside from issues of contract\nformation; (2) definiteness with respect to price and duration is\nnecessary for idea submission cases under New Jersey contract law;\nand (3) the district court was correct in holding that the contract Baer\nalleges existed was too ambiguous and indefinite to be enforceable.\n\n               a. An Implied-In-Fact Contract Has The Same Legal\n                  Consequences As An Express Contract.\n\n       In fact there are no distinctions in legal effect, at least in the\ncontext of this case, when a promise is implied rather than express.\nSee Duffy v. Charles Schwab & Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

No rationale exists\nto conclude that definiteness as to the essential terms of a contract\ncould be an exception from this fundamental principle. We therefore\ndetermine if in any “idea submission case,” whether predicated on an\nexpress or implied contract, definiteness is a requirement to create an\nenforceable contract.\n\n\n\n                                   12\n\f               b.

Baer contends that these cases support\nthe proposition that “[e]very Circuit that has published on the issue,\nhas upheld implied contract claims where price and duration were\nabsent and a price term was implied as the reasonable value of the\nideas conveyed.” Appellant’s br. at 34.\n\n\n\n                                   14\n\f        Baer’s argument is inaccurate and misleading. He attempts to\ntransform cases where the issues raised pertain to adequacy of\nconsideration and discrepancies over the use of submitted facts, into\nthe proposition that implied-in-fact contracts involving idea\nsubmissions need not be sufficiently definite. For example: Wrench,\n256 F.3d at 459-63, reversed a summary judgment disposition that\nheld that novelty was required to prove consideration and sustain an\nimplied-in-fact contract claim; Duffy, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 816-19, held\nthat a plaintiff must prove that an idea disclosed to the defendant was\nnovel in order to find consideration for the alleged contract and denied\nsummary judgment because a material issue existed over novelty and\nuse; Nadel, 208 F.3d at 374, reversed a summary judgment granted\n“only on ground that [the plaintiff’s] idea lacked general novelty and\nthus would not suffice as consideration” and remanded for the district\ncourt to determine “whether the other elements necessary to find a\nvalid express or implied-in-fact contract are present here.” Id. at 382.\nNone of the cases Baer cites holds that there is not a definiteness\nrequirement necessary to create an enforceable contract in idea\nsubmission cases. Duffy’s holding is helpful in summarizing the\nactual law to be derived from the above cited cases: “The existence of\nnovelty to the buyer only addresses the element of consideration\nnecessary for the formation of a contract. Thus, apart from\nconsideration, the formation of a contract will depend upon the\npresence of other elements.” Duffy, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The New Jersey courts have not provided\neven the slightest indication that they intend to depart from their well-\nestablished requirement that enforceability of a contract requires\ndefiniteness with respect to the essential terms of that contract.\nAccordingly, we will not relax the need for Baer to demonstrate\ndefiniteness as to price and duration with respect to the contract he\nentered into with Chase.\n\n               3. The Alleged “Contract” Regardless Of Labels Is\n                  Too Vague To Be Enforced.\n\n        The final question with respect to the Baer’s contract claim,\ntherefore, is whether his contract is enforceable in light of the\ntraditional requirement of definitiveness in New Jersey contract law\nfor a contract to be enforceable. A contract may be expressed in\n\n\n                                   15\n\fwriting, or orally, or in acts, or partly in one of these ways and partly\nin others. Troy v.

In\nthis case, even when all of the parties’ verbal and non-verbal actions\nare aggregated and viewed most favorably to Baer, we cannot find a\ncontract that is distinct and definitive enough to be enforceable.\n\n          Nothing in the record indicates that the parties agreed on\nhow, how much, where, or for what period Chase would compensate\nBaer. The parties did not discuss who would determine the “true\nvalue” of Baer’s services, when the “true value” would be calculated,\nor what variables would go into such a calculation. There was no\ndiscussion or agreement as to the meaning of “success” of The\nSopranos. There was no discussion how “profits” were to be defined.\nThere was no contemplation of dates of commencement or\ntermination of the contract. And again, nothing in Baer’s or Chase’s\nconduct, or the surrounding circumstances of the relationship, shed\nlight on, or answers, any of these questions. The district court was\ncorrect in its description of the contract between the parties: “The\ncontract as articulated by the Plaintiff lacks essential terms, and is\nvague, indefinite and uncertain; no version of the alleged agreement\ncontains sufficiently precise terms to constitute an enforceable\ncontract.” Baer, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2004</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">350050</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *6. We therefore will affirm\nthe district court’s rejection of Baer’s claim to recover under a theory\nof implied-in-fact contract.\n\n                    B. Baer’s Quasi-Contract Claim\n\n         Our rejection of Baer’s implied-in-fact contract claim does not\npreclude him from recovering on his quasi-contract claim and thus in\nview of the district court’s disposition of that claim we consider when\nthe statute of limitations started running on it. This inquiry has two\nparts: (1) application of the discovery rule; and (2) whether the\ndistrict court erred in disregarding Baer’s certification in opposition to\nChase’s motion for summary judgment, particularly when it is clear\nthat evidence in the record corroborated the certification. The court\ndisregarded the certification on the grounds that it conflicted with\nBaer’s prior deposition testimony. This statute of limitations inquiry\nis critical as the district court did not reject the quasi-contract claim on\nthe merits, and there is no doubt that in an appropriate case,\ndepending on the facts, that a party may recover on a quasi-contract\n\n\n                                    16\n\fclaim even if there was no actual contract.\n\n        If, in fact, Baer’s deposition was accurate, everything to which\nhe claims entitlement for compensation had been completed by the\nend of October 1995, some six years and seven months before he filed\nthis lawsuit. In that circumstance, as we explain below, the district\ncourt would have held correctly that the New Jersey statute of\nlimitations barred Baer’s quasi-contract claim unless the discovery\nrule postponed the commencement of the limitations period. But the\ndeposition testimony may have been incomplete as there is evidence\nin the record refuting the portion of it indicating that Baer’s last\nrendition of services was in October 1995, as it is undisputed that\nBaer sent a letter to Chase on February 10, 1997, critiquing Chase’s\nearly screenplay of The Sopranos. Indeed, this letter was already in\nthe record at the time of the deposition. In addition, Baer corrected\nthe “misstatement” in his deposition by reference to the “undisputed\nfacts that were already in evidence” in his certification in opposition\nto Chase’s motion for summary judgment.\n\n        Preliminarily on the statute of limitations issue we observe\nthat under New Jersey law, non-personal injury actions involving\nmonetary damages must be “commenced within 6 years after the\ncause of any such action shall have accrued.” N.J. Stat. Ann. §\n2A:14-1 (West 2000). Moreover, there is no dispute between the\nparties that the six-year statute of limitations governs quasi-contract\nclaims. See Kopin v. Orange Prods., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">688</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">130</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 140-41 (N.J.\nSuper. Ct. App. Div. 1997). The initial issue here, however, is an\ninquiry into when the statute started to run.\n\n         Baer challenges the district court’s holding that a quasi-\ncontract claim “accrued, if at all” for the purposes of statue of\nlimitations, when Baer rendered his final services in October 1995.\nBaer, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2004</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">350050</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *9. Baer asserts that “the Court did not\naddress Plaintiff’s contention that the discovery rule should be applied\nand as a result the cause of action did not accrue until The Sopranos\nfirst aired on January 10, 1999.” Appellant’s br. at 58.\n\n        In New Jersey as elsewhere “[t]he discovery rule postpones the\ncommencement of a cause of action until a Plaintiff knows, or should\nhave known, of facts which establish that an injury has occurred, and\nthat fault for that injury can be attributed to another.” Riemer v.

To the extent that German is applicable to the discovery\nrule at all, it applied the rule to invalidate rather than sustain a quasi-\ncontract claim.

He alleges\nthat “at the time Plaintiff’s services were completed, Plaintiff\nreasonably believed that remuneration for those services was\ngoverned by a contractual agreement contingent upon the success of\nthe show.” Appellant’s br. at 59. Baer therefore contends, “there is\nno possible way that Plaintiff knew or should have known that a cause\nof action had accrued until such time as The Sopranos aired on\nJanuary 10, 1999.” Id. He misunderstands the nature of a quantum\nmeruit claim with respect to the statute of limitations. “In cases based\non quasi-contract liability, the intention of the parties is entirely\ndisregarded. . . .” Callano v.

Super. Ct. App. Div. 1966). In other words, Baer’s\nbelief that he was going to get paid if and when the show was a\nsuccess is irrelevant because his understanding of his oral contract,\neven if correct, does not govern his quasi-contract claim inasmuch as\na quasi-contract claim is not a “real” contract based on mutual consent\nand understanding of the parties. The essence of a quasi-contract\nclaim is not the expectancy of the parties, but rather the unjust\nenrichment of one of them. It therefore would be inappropriate to\nlook at Baer’s expectations of payment, rather than at the services he\nprovided Chase.\n\n        Zic v.

The plaintiff argued that his\nclaim did not begin until the defendant failed to recognize accrued\nseniority or to make retroactive salary increases to which he claimed\nentitlement. Id. at 476. The district court stated that this argument\n“misunderstands the essence of a quantum meruit claim, which is not\nthe plaintiff’s expectancy of payment, but the unjust enrichment of the\ndefendant.” Id. The court held that the cause of action accrues upon\npresentment and subsequent rejection of a bill for services, or as soon\nas the services were rendered. Id. at 475-76.\n\n       It is clear that any application of the discovery rule would be\ninappropriate in analyzing whether the statute of limitations ran on\nBaer’s quantum meruit claim. The district court was therefore correct\n\n                                  19\n\fin utilizing a last rendition of services test to analyze whether Baer’s\nclaim was time barred.\n\n        The district court, utilizing the last services rendered test, held\nthat the statute of limitations barred Baer’s quasi-contract claim based\non his deposition testimony that he last rendered services in October\n1995.

When a party does not\nexplain the contradiction between the subsequent affidavit and the\nprior deposition, the alleged factual issue in dispute can be perceived\nas a “sham,” thereby not creating an impediment to a grant of\nsummary judgment based on the deposition.

Later, facing an almost\ncertain loss on summary judgment, she submitted a flatly\ncontradictory affidavit which did not contain an explanation for her\nchange in position. We adopted the logic of Perma, and held that the\ndistrict court properly could ignore the later affidavit. We, however,\ndid recognize that “there are situations in which sworn testimony can\nquite properly be corrected by a subsequent affidavit. . .[and] [w]here\nthe witness was confused at the earlier deposition or for some other\nreason misspoke, the subsequent correcting or clarifying affidavit may\nbe sufficient to create a material dispute of fact.” Id. at 705.\n\n        Baer argues that his deposition statement was “clearly, and\nunderstandably, mistaken,” reasoning that “he was thinking in terms\nof the overwhelming majority of his services.” Appellant’s br. at 62.\nThe district court refused to accept Baer’s “mistake” argument,\nrelying on the fact that the matter that was of critical importance to his\nclaim and the subject of repeated questioning. Baer, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2004</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">350050</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *9.\n\n        If Baer had advanced only the argument that he had made a\nmistake, exclusion of the later certification might have been\nappropriate. The district court, however, overlooked the importance\nof the evidence existing in the record, i.e., the February 10, 1997 letter\n\n                                   22\n\fthat buttressed Baer’s subsequent certification. We therefore must\naddress the question of whether corroborating evidence as to the\nsubstance of a later certification ameliorates the concerns that gave\nrise to the “sham affidavit” doctrine, thereby allowing a subsequent\ncompeting affidavit to create a dispute as to a genuine issue of a\nmaterial fact.\n\n        When there is independent evidence in the record to bolster an\notherwise questionable affidavit, courts generally have refused to\ndisregard the affidavit. See Bushell v. Wackenhut Int'l, Inc., 731 F.\nSupp. 1574, 1578 (S.D. Fla. 1990) (third party’s deposition testimony\ncan lend credence to subsequent affidavit). The Court of Appeals for\nthe Second Circuit has held the introduction of evidence can help\nrebut a charge of a “sham” affidavit. Thus, in Palazzo ex rel.\nDelmage v.

The Court of Appeals for the Tenth\nCircuit reached a similar conclusion in Delany v. Deere & Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"159935\"><a href=\"/opinion/159935/delaney-v-deere-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">219</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1195</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1996 n.1 (10th Cir. 2000), in which it stated that, “[w]hile\na party may not defeat summary judgment by contradicting deposition\ntestimony in a subsequent affidavit, new evidence may furnish a good\nfaith basis for the inconsistency.”\n\n        Baer’s ability to point to evidence in the record that\ncorroborates his later affidavit alleviates the concern that he merely\nfiled an erroneous certification out of desperation to avoid summary\njudgment. Moreover, Chase does not deny receiving the letter and his\npersonal assistant told Baer that Chase, in fact, had received the letter.\nAnd finally, Chase himself has provided the letter in discovery.\nGiven this evidence which corroborates the certification, the concern\nthat Baer’s claim that he performed services as late as February 10,\n1997, is either desperate or erroneous is eliminated, and therefore the\ncourt should have analyzed the letter and the circumstances\nsurrounding it and Baer’s certification when ruling on the summary\n\n\n\n\n                                   23\n\fjudgment motion on the statute of limitations issue.5 The district\ncourt therefore erred, at least procedurally, in granting Chase’s\nsummary judgment motion based on the statute of limitations with\nrespect to Baer’s quantum meruit claim. We therefore will reverse the\nsummary judgment on this point and will remand the question of\nwhether Baer presented a timely and otherwise valid quasi-contract\n\n\n\n\n       5\n         Chase argues that even if we refuse to disregard the February 10,\n1997 letter, “the letter cannot be characterized as a compensable\n‘service’ as a matter of law.” Appellees’ br. at 42. Chase contends that\nwe should disregard the February letter on two grounds, the first of\nwhich is its timing. Chase did not receive the letter until some 14\nmonths after he mailed the screenplay to Baer, as well as after all the\nmajor networks had rejected the draft. Chase argues that even if the\nletter had value at one time, it had no value to him when he actually\nreceived it. Second, Chase argues that the letter had no value to him as\nit contained only cursory observations and laudatory phrases about his\nwork. Chase premises his argument on the assumption that in analyzing\nthe statute of limitations for quantum meruit purposes we should dissect\nthe last service rendered to deem if it provided value to the opposing\nparty.\n\n        We will not affirm the summary judgment on this basis. First,\nBaer’s letter describes the aspects of the screenplay that he believes were\nsuccessful, the parts to which he related personally, and what humor\nworked, and provided encouragement to continue with the project. App.\nat 22. We will not write these contributions off, as Chase attempts to do,\nas “empty flattery.”\n\n         Additionally, we will not dissect each interaction between\nlitigants to quantify the precise value of each correspondence or service\nrendered. The exchange of ideas and services should not be viewed as\nincremental, segregable interactions that we can assess individually for\npurposes of the statute of limitations. A separate issue would arise if a\nlitigant sent a correspondence or rendered a “sham service” in an attempt\nto avoid the statute. That situation, however, does not describe the\ncircumstances before us. We will not engage in Chase’s request to judge\nwhether the February letter, taken in isolation, was a “compensable\nservice.” We are satisfied that Baer sent the letter and Chase received it,\nand thus at least at this time it will serve as the “last service rendered”\nfor purposes of the statute of limitations calculus.\n\n                                    24\n\fclaim to the district court for further consideration.6\n\n                   C. Baer’s Misappropriation Claim\n\n        Baer next raises the issue of whether the district court erred in\nholding that the fact that the ideas he advanced existed in the public\ndomain precluded those ideas, alone or in combination, from\npossessing the requisite novelty so that their use cannot be the basis\nfor a claim for common law idea misappropriation. The cause of\naction of “misappropriation” is based on tort principles rather than on\ncontract law. Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition § 40, cmt. a.\nThe premise behind the tort is that when a party misappropriates\nanother’s confidential idea or some other type of property, the law\nimposes an obligation on that party to pay the other restitution for its\nimproper use.

The Flemming opinion followed a bench trial so\nsuch a determination was unnecessary. Flemming, 788 A.2d at 154.\nThe district court in Bergin, though deciding the case under New\nJersey law, looked to New York law and held that “[w]hether an idea\nis novel is an issue of law which may be decided on a motion for\nsummary judgment.” Bergin, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">223833</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *9.

We believe that the district court here was\ncorrect in its conclusion as to how the New Jersey Supreme Court\nwould decide this issue and it is therefore necessary to determine the\n“novelty” of Baer’s contribution.\n\n        The predicates on which a property right in an idea may be\nbased are novelty and originality.

A misappropriation claim,\nunlike a contract-based claim, only can arise from the taking of an\nidea that is original or novel because the law of property does not\nprotect against the appropriation of that which is free and available to\nall. Nadel, 208 F.3d at 378. Therefore, anyone may use ideas in the\npublic domain freely with impunity. See Ed Graham Prods., Inc. v.\nNational Broad.

Though Flemming did not articulate a test\nfor affirmatively determining when an idea is “novel,” the court did\ncite examples of ideas that would not be novel. The Flemming court\nrecognized that even an otherwise novel idea would lose its novelty if\nit was “in the domain of public knowledge” before the defendant used\nit. Flemming, 258 A.2d at 157-58. The Duffy court expanded on this\nconclusion by noting “[a]n idea will not satisfy [the novelty\nrequirement] if it is not significantly different from, or is an obvious\nadaptation or combination of ideas in the public domain.” Duffy, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.

Such ideas cannot be\nmisappropriated.\n\n        Baer admits that all of the locations he identified to Chase\nexist in the public domain.7 In addition, many of the stories and\npotential plot lines that Baer “provided” Chase existed in the public\nrecord.8 Moreover, as the district court noted, the additional ideas and\nstories that Baer claims were misappropriated were not his stories;\n“associates” of Baer actually told them to Chase:\n\n                      In particular, the Plaintiff seeks\n               compensation for Spirito’s story of\n               rivalry with his uncles in the aftermath\n               of his father's death, that Koczur’s\n               account to Chase that many waste\n               management companies were alleged to\n               be involved with organized crime,\n               Spirito’s story of his experiences with a\n               ‘loan shark’ and Jones’s description of\n               the way in which organized crime uses\n               loan shark debts to take over a business,\n\n\n       7\n       Baer “introduced” Chase to the City of Elizabeth, The Pulaski\nSkyway, and Centanni’s Meat Market.\n       8\n        For example, Baer relayed the following stories to Chase: the\nRCA and Morris Levy “scam,” which was the subject of a published\nbook; information regarding the DeCavalcante family and organized\ncrime which existed in public lure of New Jersey; and wire taps that\nwere part of the public record having been played at a criminal trial.

In Duffy the plaintiff argued that “its idea was novel\nbecause [it] spent many months deciding the organization and layout\nof the data so its products could be readily understood by\nnonprofessional investors. . . . [It] stated that it was the format that\nmade Duffy’s reports unique and proprietary to [it].” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The plaintiff in Duffy took data, fields and information in the\npublic domain and organized them to create a “mutual fund report\ncard.” Id. The court held that, though the organization and layout of\nthe data may involve some originality, this articulation of originality\nwent more to an idea’s expression than to the idea itself. Id. It is\nwell-established that an idea’s expression is not entitled to protection\nunder a state’s misappropriation law. Id. As the court in Duffy\nrecognized, “To the extent a state’s law purports to impose liability\nfor the misappropriation of an idea’s expression, such a law would be\npreempted by federal copyright law.” Duffy, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Super. Ct. App. Div. 1982)). Despite Baer’s\ncreativity in combining stories and facts existing in the public domain,\nNew Jersey does not protect this mode of originality under its\n\n                                   29\n\fmisappropriation law. Thus, the district court correctly granted Chase\nsummary judgment on Baer’s misappropriation claim.\n\n            D. District Court’s Exclusion of Expert Report\n\n        The final issue raised on appeal is whether the district court\nabused its discretion by excluding Baer’s expert report from\nconsideration on issues of liability. Early in the litigation, the court\nbifurcated the case into liability and damage phases, with expert\ndiscovery not being contemplated or authorized by any scheduling\norder. Baer’s attorney later retained John Agoglia as an “expert\nwitness” regarding “the damages aspect of case” to be used by Baer\n“should [Defendant] raise an issue regarding the calculation of\ndamages at summary judgment.” App. at 902, 914.\n\n         Faced with the summary judgment motion, Baer attempted to\ninclude Agoglia’s report which stated “a contribution of such ideas\nand services [as those made by Baer] toward the creation of a\ntelevision series such as The Sopranos . . . would commonly be\nrewarded with fixed payments and/or production bonuses and or a\nsliding scale of profit participation and/or screen credits in recognition\nof such contributions, or any combination thereof.” App. at 27. The\ndistrict court excluded Agoglia’s report based on the fact that he was\nnot presented as a liability expert and that his report did not opine on\nliability. App. at 175.\n\n         The district court did not abuse its discretion by disregarding\nthe report with respect to a summary judgment motion focusing solely\non issues of liability. Agoglia was not presented as an expert on\nliability. We agree with the court’s assessment that, “I don’t see how\nsomebody who was put forth under Rule 26 as a damages expert is\ngoing to be able to bootstrap liability issues into a summary judgment\nmotion.” App. at 196. The damage expert’s testimony had no\nrelevance to the questions of formation or enforceability of the\npurported contract. Chase named Agoglia to be an expert witness on\ndamages; his opinions with respect to liability are simply beside the\npoint.\n\n         Baer’s brief allocates little space in presenting an argument as\nto how the court erred in excluding the damages report from the\nliability phase of the trial. Bear clearly presented Agoglia as a\ndamages expert to the district court and his adversary. The court did\nnot err in refusing Baer’s attempts to “bootstrap” a damages witness\nwho repeatedly agreed that he had no legal training to testify as an\n\n                                    30\n\fexpert on liability.\n\n\n\n                          IV. CONCLUSION\n\n         Inasmuch as the district court erroneously disregarded Baer’s\ncertification, which, if considered, might have precluded the grant of\nsummary judgment on the quantum meruit claim on a statute of\nlimitations basis, we will reverse the order of the district court entered\nFebruary 20, 2004, and remand the case for further proceedings in the\ndistrict court solely on that claim. Otherwise we will affirm the order\nof February 20, 2004. The parties will bear their own costs in this\nappeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                   31\n\f</pre>",
