(§§ 667, subds. (d), (e)(2)(A), 1170.12, subds.\n(b), (c)(2)(A), and that defendant had one serious felony prior. (§ 667, subd. (a).) The\ncourt also found it to be true that defendant is a habitual offender within the meaning of\nsection 667.71, subdivision (a). The court sentenced defendant to an indeterminate term\nof 75 years to live, plus a five-year determinate term.\n              On appeal, defendant contends the trial court erred when it denied his\nmotion to dismiss the case “due to the 15-year precharging delay.” He also argues the\ntrial court erred by failing to exercise its discretion “to strike at least one strike pursuant\n\n\n\n\n1             All further statutory references are to the Penal Code.\n\n\n                                               2\n\fto Romero.”2 Defendant’s last contention of error concerns an alleged illegal restitution\nand parole revocation fine.

In 1992,\nhe knew defendant. During the 2012 trial of the instant matter, Ruben testified defendant\n“would come around our apartment . . . our apartment complex and that’s how I met\nhim.” Defendant met Ruben’s parents at some point.\n             Ruben said there had been several incidents of inappropriate touching. He\ndescribed one that occurred while Ruben was sitting on top of a washer or dryer in the\nlaundry room. He said defendant “came up to me between my legs and kind of touching\nme and then he tried to — when he tried to kiss me, that’s when I kind of pushed him\naway and told him to stop.” He said the place where defendant touched him was “around\nmy butt.” Ruben turned his head, and defendant missed his lips, but kissed Ruben on his\nface. Defendant offered Ruben $5 “not to tell anybody.”\n             He related one other incident he remembered about defendant that\nhappened when “me and all the guys” were in the pool. “He grabbed me from my groin\nand kind of my chest and picked me up and kind of threw me across the water.”\n             Later, Ruben told a teacher about defendant’s conduct. After that, the\npolice got involved.\n\n\n1994, 1995\n             The victim, T.N. was born in late 1984. When he testified in 2012, he was\n27 years old. T.N. met defendant in the laundry room of the apartment complex where\n\n\n2            People v. Superior Court (Romero) (1996) 13 Cal.4th 497.\n\n                                            3\n\fthey both lived when he was nine or 10 years old. Defendant went to T.N.’s parents to\ninform them he was putting together a boys’ soccer team. T.N. joined the team, which\nwas composed of other boys who were about the same age.\n              T.N. described the first incident: “He was doing laundry in the laundromat\nroom. We were talking about the team and I can remember him saying if I ever kissed\nsomeone, a girl. I was kind of shocked because I never, you know, thought about that,\nyou know. I was growing up. I was a nine or ten year old. I said no. [¶] He kind of tells\nme, ‘You should practice with a fruit,’ you know. And he kissed me. It kind of felt\nawkward. That’s one of the ones that I can remember as starting.” T.N. explained\ndefendant kissed him on the mouth, using his tongue.\n              T.N. described how defendant’s conduct escalated: “Well, it started by\ntouching, you know, private areas. Getting more, you know, more into sexual stuff with\nprivate areas, kissing more intimately, stuff like that.” Defendant “kept telling [T.N.] to\ngrab his penis on occasions, masturbate him, stuff like that.” These contacts occurred\nboth on T.N.’s bare skin and through his clothing. At times, defendant ejaculated.\nDefendant at times would push T.N.’s head toward defendant’s penis to “try to get [T.N.]\nto suck his penis.”\n              According to T.N., defendant “would treat me good. I mean, he would buy\nme stuff, you know, take me on trips to Disneyland, Big Bear with family, obviously he\nwould be nice.” Reflecting back on being on the soccer team during those days, T.N.\nsaid he doesn’t think, that based on the merits, he deserved as much playing time as he\ngot. Defendant developed a relationship with the T.N.’s parents as well; he came to the\nfamily home, and drank and played cards with T.N.’s parents.\n              The prosecutor asked the following question: “You told us earlier about\ntimes where he would have you masturbate his bare penis and have you put your mouth\non his penis?” T.N. said “uh-huh,” and said that happened three times. The places where\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\fthese incidents occurred were, “[h]is brother’s house in the apartment complex where he\nlived and in the car.”\n              Regarding an occasion when T.N. went to an Immigration and Natural\nService (INS) office with defendant, T.N. described what happened: “He told me he was\ngoing to have to get some stuff and check into the office and I didn’t know what the\noffice was for. We waited in the waiting room and they called him in. Next thing I know\nhe’s in handcuffs and all that stuff, so I’m there crying, you know, and just being\nhysterical. I mean, my parents were not there, it was just him I was with. And knowing I\nwas by myself, I just started, you know, panicking.” Before T.N.’s father picked him up\nfrom the office, T.N. did have some contact with federal agents at the INS office. The\nagents asked T.N. “if he did anything like that to me,” and T.N. said “no.” T.N. never\nsaw defendant again.\n              At trial, William Wallace, who is currently employed with Homeland\nSecurity Investigations, testified. He said that on August 25, 1995, he was a special agent\nwith the INS at the Westminster, California office. At that time, he was informed about\ndefendant that the “immigration status showed that he had been arrested in Los Angeles.”\nWallace determined he had “a couple of arrests in his background” for child molestation,\nand that there was a parole warrant for his arrest.\n              While defendant was in Wallace’s office, defendant said he would like to\ntalk to the people who had come to the office with him. Defendant provided Wallace\nwith T.N.’s name, and said T.N.s father drove them to the INS office, and dropped them\noff while he went to buy groceries.\n              Wallace had T.N. paged to the front counter, and at trial Wallace described\nthe person who responded to the page: “It was a small Latino kid that was about 10 years\nold.” Wallace testified he did not interview T.N.\n\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\f              Afterward, Wallace called the Orange County Child Abuse Registry. He\ntold them they had taken defendant into custody and that “he had a couple of photos with\nhim of soccer teams.”\n\n\n2011\n              In January and February of 2011, Damon Tucker was assigned to the sexual\nassault unit at the Orange County District Attorney’s Office. Tucker was informed that\ndefendant was about to be released from prison, and he was asked to assist in possibly\nlocating other victims. In the performance of that duty, Tucker came upon an INS memo\nauthored by Wallace. Using an available computer database, Tucker located T.N.’s\naddress.\n              In February 28, 2011, Tucker went to T.N.’s home. At that time, T.N. told\nthe investigator of the touching, masturbation and oral sex incidents. Before that time,\nT.N. never told any police officers what happened.\n              The following questions were asked by the prosecutor and answered by the\nvictim:\n              “Q: So you didn’t tell anybody at INS and then, you didn’t tell anybody\nfrom law enforcement all the way up until the time when Investigator Tucker came to\nyour house?\n              “A: That’s right.\n              “Q: Can you tell us why it is over the years that you never went to the\npolice or anybody else about what happened?\n              “A: Well, as you know, it’s a very hard situation, you know, growing up,\nunderstanding what he was doing was wrong and being in school calling you names, gay,\nfaggot. I kind of put it in the past, you know. Kind of made a gap for that and put it\nbehind me. I moved forward with my life, you know. [¶] My parents always asked me\n‘that was weird, you know, that he would buy all that stuff, he would do this.’ And I\n\n                                             6\n\fwould be like, ‘I don’t know. He just liked me.’ But deep down I never came up open to\nanybody. [¶] The only person I came up opened to was my wife and that’s after having\nkids. It does take a hit to me knowing that I have kids and the thing that happened to\nme.”\n              A felony complaint was filed by the People on March 7, 2011.\n\n\nPretrial Motion to Dismiss\n              The information was filed on January 5, 2012, and amended on February\n24, 2012, alleging that between December 1, 1994 and August 25, 1995, defendant\ncommitted a lewd and lascivious act upon the victim. Defendant moved to dismiss the\ninformation for denial of due process and speedy trial. For purposes of the motion, the\nlawyers on both sides stipulated to the admission of certain facts and documents:\n              1) That Wallace’s August 25, 1995 memorandum “accurately reflects his\nactions and observations of that date.” Wallace’s memorandum includes: “[T.N.]’s\nfather arrived and stated that he had been delivering groceries. He was apprised of the\nsituation and told that other agencies would be contacting him regarding his son’s\nrelations with GONZALEZ. SSA Salacup asked [T.N.’s father] if he was aware of\nGONZALEZ’s previous history and he stated that he knew that GONZALEZ had some\nproblems before but was not aware of them. He stated that he and his wife had noticed a\nchange in their son’s behavior but did not understand the change. He stated that his son\nspent a lot of time alone with GONZALEZ because they trusted him. He stated that he\nleft [T.N.] with GONZALEZ this morning telling them he would return later to pick them\nup.” Also in the memorandum is the following: “I contacted Debbie Sherwood of the\nChild Abuse Registry who took a report regarding the events and circumstances\nregarding GONZALEZ and his relationship with T.N. She stated that it appeared that\nGONZALEZ was molesting children again and stated that she would be forwarding a\nreport to the Santa Ana Police Department for an immediate investigation.”\n\n                                            7\n\f               2) The August 25, 1995, Orange County Social Services Agency Child\nAbuse Report, that was forwarded to the Santa Ana and Garden Grove Police\nDepartments.\n               3) Defendant’s parole records prepared on or about September 3, 1995. A\nreport in those records states: “It would appear that the parolee in actuality has numerous\ncounts of violation of a special condition as he was seen pictured with his teams of soccer\nplayer[s]; all of which were minor children in addition to his other violations. The\nparolee continues to be a very dangerous person and has not abided by parole since his\nlast release from a violation. In view of his involvement in the instant offenses it is\nrecommended that he be returned to custody for a maximum amount of time as he\ncontinues to be a predatory individual.”\n               4) “Defendant Efren Gonzalez was arrested on or about August 25, 1995, at\nthe office of the INS. Defendant was then turned over to the custody of the [California\nDepartment of Correction] CDC and faced violation, and was adjudicated in violation . . .\nDefendant remained in Orange County Jail until he was adjudicated guilty on February\n18, 2000, and then sentenced to 172 months in state prison with credits to that date\ntotaling approximately one year. That sentence was completed on January 19, 2011.”\n               5) On January 18, 2011, the CDC obtained a 45-day hold to complete\nevaluation of Defendant as a “Sexually Violent Predator” . . . . On March 1, 2011, the\nPeople filed a civil petition . . . to have Defendant committed as an SVP . . . . The People\nthereafter filed this case on March 7, 2011.\n               6) Both the victim and his parents indicated that no police officers\ncontacted them until they were contacted on February 28, 2011.\n               At the hearing on the motion to dismiss, an officer from the Garden Grove\nPolice Department testified the department’s records revealed that defendant registered as\na sex offender in 1993. Defendant’s counsel argued at the hearing: “. . . And then the\nlast thing I would say is when we’re looking at the prejudice, I believe that all we need to\n\n                                               8\n\fshow is any small prejudice, and then it would go to whether the delay was unreasonable,\nand I don’t know what the reasonable amount is, but 16 years with absolutely no new\ndevelopments, zero, zero. It went back to something that was prepared the day of the\narrest. The date on the memo is the same day he was arrested. It was prepared the same\nday. It’s been sitting there the whole time and there has been no justification whatsoever\nfor the delay. There is absolutely zero. . . . They had everything they needed to go out to\nthe house, talk to the guy, 20-minute conversation, and file the case. So whose fault is\nthat? Well, that’s going to be law enforcement 100 percent.” The motion to dismiss was\ndenied.\n\n\nPosttrial Motion to Strike\n              On March 1, 2013, the court heard defendant’s Romero [People v. Superior\nCourt (Romero), supra, 13 Cal.4th 497] motion. In ruling on defendant’s motion, the\ncourt stated: “When the court looks at this case, yes, yes, the actual sex acts are not\namong the worst. But that’s like saying a particular murder is not as bad as the Night\nStalker or something. I’m not sure what that proves. [¶] The probation report talks about\naggravating and mitigating factors. Callous and cruel, yes. Victim vulnerable and\nyoung, yes. Planned, absolutely. Even starting with the soccer team. A violation of\ntrust, yes. One misdemeanor and five felony prior convictions, yes. Prior state prison\ncommitment, yes. On parole when this occurred, yes. Three psychologists saying he is a\nconfirmed pedophile, yes. SARATSO3—that’s an acronym saying he is high risk — yes.\nHe not only qualifies under the One Strike law, but under the Habitual Criminal law\n667.71, yes. [¶] [T.]N., though we may look as criminal laws that these acts aren’t so\nbad, compared to what we see sometimes, [T.]N. was affected. Counsel reminded me of\nthe touching thing where [it] is awkward for him to bathe his own children. [¶] So, can\n\n\n3             State Authorized Risk Assessment Tool for Sex Offenders.\n\n                                              9\n\fthe court make a finding that the sentence under the Three Strikes law is cruel and\nunusual? Well, it’s significant that though that’s been on the books for quite some time,\nthere’s no case law as far as I know, no case finding that to be cruel and unusual. [¶]\nNow, it’s true you have not only the One Strike law here but it’s tripled because of the\nthree strikes. But the court can’t find that to be cruel and unusual, despite the good\nbriefing by the defense. [¶] The defendant is not outside the spirit of Three Strikes law.\n[¶] And the court would decline to strike the strikes.”\n                                               II\n                                        DISCUSSION\nMotion to Dismiss\n              Defendant contends the trial court erred when it denied his motion to\ndismiss the case “due to the 15-year precharging delay.” He argues: “During those\nintervening years, [defendant] completed two prison terms. The prosecution mounted an\ninvestigation only when [defendant] was due to be paroled in 2011 on his most recent\nprior case. Then, [defendant] was detained for evaluation for potential civil commitment\nunder the SVP law. . . . In the course of that evaluation, the prosecution tracked down\n[T.N.], who then claimed [defendant] had molested him years ago, and this criminal\nprosecution was filed days later.”\n              “Notwithstanding any other limitation of time described in this chapter, a\ncriminal complaint may be filed within one year of the date of a report to a California law\nenforcement agency by a person of any age alleging that he or she, while under the age of\n18 years, was the victim of a crime described in Section 261, 286, 288, 288a, 288.5, or\n289, or Section 289.5 . . . .” (§ 803, subd. (f)(1).)\n              “A defendant’s state and federal constitutional speedy trial rights [citation]\ndo not attach before the defendant is arrested or a charging document has been filed.\n[Citation.] Nonetheless, a defendant is not without recourse if a delay in filing charges is\nprejudicial and unjustified. The statute of limitations is usually considered the primary\n\n                                              10\n\fguarantee against overly stale criminal charges [citation], but the right of due process\nprovides additional protection, safeguarding a criminal defendant’s interest in fair\nadjudication by preventing unjustified delays that weaken the defense through the\ndimming of memories, the death or disappearance of witnesses, and the loss or\ndestruction of material physical evidence. [Citation.]” (People v. Abel (2012) 53 Cal.4th\n891, 908.)\n                “A defendant seeking relief for undue delay in filing charges must first\ndemonstrate resulting prejudice, such as by showing the loss of a material witness or\nother missing evidence, or fading memory caused by the lapse of time. [Citation.]”\n(People v. Abel, supra, 53 Cal.4th at p. 908.) Prejudice to a defendant from precharging\ndelay is not presumed. (People v. Nelson (2008) 43 Cal.4th 1242, 1250.) Although\n“under California law, negligent, as well as purposeful, delay in bringing charges may,\nwhen accompanied by a showing of prejudice, violate due process. . . .” (Id. at p. 1255.)\n“If the delay was merely negligent, a greater showing of prejudice would be required to\nestablish a due process violation.” (Id. at p. 1256.) If the defendant fails to meet the\nburden of showing prejudice, there is no need to determine whether the delay was\njustified. (Serna v. Superior Court (1985) 40 Cal.3d. 239, 249.)\n                “Prejudice may be shown by ‘“loss of material witnesses due to lapse of\ntime [citation] or loss of evidence because of fading memories attributable to the delay.”’\n[Citations.]” (People v. Cowan (2010) 50 Cal.4th 401, 430.) “We review for abuse of\ndiscretion a trial court’s ruling on a motion to dismiss for prejudicial prearrest delay\n. . . .” (Id. at p. 431.)\n                Here defendant argues prejudice because the defense was unable to locate\nthe persons from Orange County Social Services Agency or the two police departments\nwho were assigned the investigation in 1995. Without those individuals, defendant\nargues, he has been unable to challenge T.N. and his family about their present position\nthey were not contacted in 1995. Defendant also argues T.N.’s dulled memory about\n\n                                              11\n\fwhen the acts occurred has prevented him from contacting witnesses who might have\nbeen available earlier. He also points out the INS took some soccer photos from\ndefendant in 1995, and as a result, he has been unable to track down other boys on the\nteam or their parents to use for impeachment purposes or character testimony.\n              With regard to the Disneyland trip, defendant points out that during his\ntestimony, T.N. said he could not recall who else went with them. Without the benefit of\nT.N.’s memory, defendant now argues, he was unable to develop an argument that\ndefendant did not give T.N. “special treatment as a means of grooming him as a victim.”\n              It would be difficult for this court to conclude there was no negligence here.\nRepresentatives of the federal government, the County of Orange, the City of Santa Ana\nand the City of Garden Grove were given information in 1995 warranting further\ninvestigation about child molestation. We will never know whether or not each agency\nthought another agency was performing an investigation. Nonetheless, while defendant\nargues a litany of possible consequences, he has not pointed us to any witness whose\nmemory was dulled to his detriment. Both Ruben L. and T.N. had hazy memories\nregarding some details, but we don’t find any prejudice to defendant as a result. T.N.\ntestified that it was not until he reached adulthood and had children of his own, that he\nwas ready to confide his secret to his wife. In fact, when he was specifically asked about\nmolestation by Wallace in 1995, he denied it. Thus, there is a strong indication he would\nnot have revealed the true facts to detectives had they investigated the matter in 1995.\nWallace did not remember much, but his detailed memorandum was kept. Defendant’s\narguments about alibi evidence are mere speculation. Soccer photographs, showing\ndefendant with a team of little boys, would more likely than not have undermined, rather\nthan assisted, his defense.\n              Under the law, we cannot presume prejudice. Under the circumstances we\nfind in this record, we cannot conclude defendant was actually prejudiced by the lengthy\n\n\n\n                                             12\n\fprefiling delay. Thus, we do not conclude the trial court abused its discretion in denying\ndefendant’s motion to dismiss.\n\n\nRomero Motion\n              Defendant next contends the trial court erred by failing to exercise its\ndiscretion to strike at least one strike pursuant to People v. Superior Court (Romero),\nsupra, 13 Cal.4th 497.\n              The United States Supreme Court stated California has a “‘valid interest in\ndeterring and segregating habitual criminals’” such as defendant. (Ewing v. California\n(2003) 538 U.S. 11, 25.) “As under the federal standard, a defendant’s history of\nrecidivism, which is part of the nature of the offense and the offender, justifies harsh\npunishment. [Citations.]” (People v. Meeks (2004) 123 Cal.App.4th 695, 709.)\n              Section 1385, subdivision (a) states in pertinent part, “The judge or\nmagistrate may, either of his or her own motion or upon application of the prosecuting\nattorney, and in furtherance of justice, order an action to be dismissed.” While the statute\nallows for a motion to be made only by the prosecutor or on the court’s own motion, a\ndefendant may “invite” the court to exercise its discretion to strike a prior felony. The\ncourt’s ruling on such a motion is reviewable for abuse of discretion. (People v.\nCarmony (2004) 33 Cal.4th 367, 374-375.) A trial court abuses its discretion only if its\nruling is “so irrational or arbitrary that no reasonable person could agree with it.” (Id. at\np. 377.)\n              The Three Strikes scheme is intended to limit courts’ discretion in\nsentencing repeat offenders. There exists no discretionary sentencing choice, unless the\nsentencing court determines that an exception should be made because defendant is\ndeemed to fall outside the spirit of the Three Strikes law. This analysis includes\nconsidering remoteness and the nonviolent nature of prior offenses. (See People v.\nBishop (1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 1245.) When deciding whether to strike a prior, “weight\n\n                                              13\n\fmust be accorded to factors intrinsic to the scheme, such as the nature and circumstances\nof the defendant’s present felonies and prior serious and/or violent felony convictions,\nand the particulars of the his background, character, and prospects. [Citation.]” (People\nv. Williams (1998) 17 Cal.4th 148, 161.)\n              State legislatures enacting Three Strikes laws made a deliberate policy\nchoice that individuals who have repeatedly engaged in serious or violent criminal\nbehavior, and whose conduct has not been deterred by more conventional punishment\napproaches, must be isolated from society to protect the public safety. (Ewing v.\nCalifornia, supra, 538 U.S. at p. 24.) “In imposing a three strikes sentence, the State’s\ninterest is not merely punishing the offense of conviction, or the ‘triggering’ offense: ‘It\nis in addition the interest . . . in dealing in a harsher manner with those who by repeated\ncriminal acts have shown that they are simply incapable of conforming to the norms of\nsociety as established by its criminal law.’ [Citations.]” (Id. at p. 29.)\n              Here the court very carefully and meticulously analyzed the state of affairs\nsurrounding defendant’s present crime and past crimes prior to denying his motion to\nstrike. Under the circumstances we find in this record, we cannot conclude the court\nabused its discretion.\n\n\nRestitution/Parole Revocation Order\n              Lastly, defendant contends the court violated his ex post facto rights when\nit imposed a restitution fine and parole revocation fine in the amount of $280 because his\ncrime occurred before the change in the law. He requests that we reduce the amount to\n$200.\n              In the instant matter, the trial court stated: “The court would impose a $280\nrestitution fine. If the defendant is ever released on parole and violates that parole,\nanother $280.” Defendant waived the right to be present at any future restitution hearing.\n\n\n\n                                              14\n\f             At the time of the offenses, the minimum restitution and parole revocation\nfines were $200. On January 1, 2012, the statutory minimum restitution fine was\nincreased to $240, and on January 1, 2013, the minimum restitution fine was increased to\n$280. (§ 1202.4, subd. (b)(1).)\n             As defendant cites us to nothing in the record to support his implied\ncontention the court intended to impose the minimum fine permitted by law, we deem this\nargument waived. (Schubert v. Reynolds (2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 100, 109.)\n                                           III\n                                    DISPOSITION\n             The judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 MOORE, J.\n\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\n\nO’LEARY, P.

(§§ 667, subds. (d), (e)(2)(A), 1170.12, subds.\n(b), (c)(2)(A), and that defendant had one serious felony prior. (§ 667, subd. (a).) The\ncourt also found it to be true that defendant is a habitual offender within the meaning of\nsection 667.71, subdivision (a). The court sentenced defendant to an indeterminate term\nof 75 years to live, plus a five-year determinate term.\n              On appeal, defendant contends the trial court erred when it denied his\nmotion to dismiss the case “due to the 15-year precharging delay.” He also argues the\ntrial court erred by failing to exercise its discretion “to strike at least one strike pursuant\n\n\n\n\n1             All further statutory references are to the Penal Code.\n\n\n                                               2\n\fto Romero.”2 Defendant’s last contention of error concerns an alleged illegal restitution\nand parole revocation fine.

In 1992,\nhe knew defendant. During the 2012 trial of the instant matter, Ruben testified defendant\n“would come around our apartment . . . our apartment complex and that’s how I met\nhim.” Defendant met Ruben’s parents at some point.\n             Ruben said there had been several incidents of inappropriate touching. He\ndescribed one that occurred while Ruben was sitting on top of a washer or dryer in the\nlaundry room. He said defendant “came up to me between my legs and kind of touching\nme and then he tried to — when he tried to kiss me, that’s when I kind of pushed him\naway and told him to stop.” He said the place where defendant touched him was “around\nmy butt.” Ruben turned his head, and defendant missed his lips, but kissed Ruben on his\nface. Defendant offered Ruben $5 “not to tell anybody.”\n             He related one other incident he remembered about defendant that\nhappened when “me and all the guys” were in the pool. “He grabbed me from my groin\nand kind of my chest and picked me up and kind of threw me across the water.”\n             Later, Ruben told a teacher about defendant’s conduct. After that, the\npolice got involved.\n\n\n1994, 1995\n             The victim, T.N. was born in late 1984. When he testified in 2012, he was\n27 years old.

Defendant went to T.N.’s parents to\ninform them he was putting together a boys’ soccer team. T.N. joined the team, which\nwas composed of other boys who were about the same age.\n              T.N. described the first incident: “He was doing laundry in the laundromat\nroom. We were talking about the team and I can remember him saying if I ever kissed\nsomeone, a girl. I was kind of shocked because I never, you know, thought about that,\nyou know. I was growing up. I was a nine or ten year old. I said no. [¶] He kind of tells\nme, ‘You should practice with a fruit,’ you know. And he kissed me. It kind of felt\nawkward. That’s one of the ones that I can remember as starting.” T.N. explained\ndefendant kissed him on the mouth, using his tongue.\n              T.N. described how defendant’s conduct escalated: “Well, it started by\ntouching, you know, private areas. Getting more, you know, more into sexual stuff with\nprivate areas, kissing more intimately, stuff like that.” Defendant “kept telling [T.N.] to\ngrab his penis on occasions, masturbate him, stuff like that.” These contacts occurred\nboth on T.N.’s bare skin and through his clothing. At times, defendant ejaculated.\nDefendant at times would push T.N.’s head toward defendant’s penis to “try to get [T.N.]\nto suck his penis.”\n              According to T.N., defendant “would treat me good. I mean, he would buy\nme stuff, you know, take me on trips to Disneyland, Big Bear with family, obviously he\nwould be nice.” Reflecting back on being on the soccer team during those days, T.N.\nsaid he doesn’t think, that based on the merits, he deserved as much playing time as he\ngot. Defendant developed a relationship with the T.N.’s parents as well; he came to the\nfamily home, and drank and played cards with T.N.’s parents.\n              The prosecutor asked the following question: “You told us earlier about\ntimes where he would have you masturbate his bare penis and have you put your mouth\non his penis?” T.N. said “uh-huh,” and said that happened three times. The places where\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\fthese incidents occurred were, “[h]is brother’s house in the apartment complex where he\nlived and in the car.”\n              Regarding an occasion when T.N. went to an Immigration and Natural\nService (INS) office with defendant, T.N. described what happened: “He told me he was\ngoing to have to get some stuff and check into the office and I didn’t know what the\noffice was for. We waited in the waiting room and they called him in. Next thing I know\nhe’s in handcuffs and all that stuff, so I’m there crying, you know, and just being\nhysterical. I mean, my parents were not there, it was just him I was with. And knowing I\nwas by myself, I just started, you know, panicking.” Before T.N.’s father picked him up\nfrom the office, T.N. did have some contact with federal agents at the INS office. The\nagents asked T.N. “if he did anything like that to me,” and T.N. said “no.” T.N. never\nsaw defendant again.\n              At trial, William Wallace, who is currently employed with Homeland\nSecurity Investigations, testified. He said that on August 25, 1995, he was a special agent\nwith the INS at the Westminster, California office. At that time, he was informed about\ndefendant that the “immigration status showed that he had been arrested in Los Angeles.”\nWallace determined he had “a couple of arrests in his background” for child molestation,\nand that there was a parole warrant for his arrest.\n              While defendant was in Wallace’s office, defendant said he would like to\ntalk to the people who had come to the office with him. Defendant provided Wallace\nwith T.N.’s name, and said T.N.s father drove them to the INS office, and dropped them\noff while he went to buy groceries.\n              Wallace had T.N. paged to the front counter, and at trial Wallace described\nthe person who responded to the page: “It was a small Latino kid that was about 10 years\nold.” Wallace testified he did not interview T.N.\n\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\f              Afterward, Wallace called the Orange County Child Abuse Registry. He\ntold them they had taken defendant into custody and that “he had a couple of photos with\nhim of soccer teams.”\n\n\n2011\n              In January and February of 2011, Damon Tucker was assigned to the sexual\nassault unit at the Orange County District Attorney’s Office. Tucker was informed that\ndefendant was about to be released from prison, and he was asked to assist in possibly\nlocating other victims. In the performance of that duty, Tucker came upon an INS memo\nauthored by Wallace. Using an available computer database, Tucker located T.N.’s\naddress.\n              In February 28, 2011, Tucker went to T.N.’s home. At that time, T.N. told\nthe investigator of the touching, masturbation and oral sex incidents. Before that time,\nT.N. never told any police officers what happened.\n              The following questions were asked by the prosecutor and answered by the\nvictim:\n              “Q: So you didn’t tell anybody at INS and then, you didn’t tell anybody\nfrom law enforcement all the way up until the time when Investigator Tucker came to\nyour house?\n              “A: That’s right.\n              “Q: Can you tell us why it is over the years that you never went to the\npolice or anybody else about what happened?\n              “A: Well, as you know, it’s a very hard situation, you know, growing up,\nunderstanding what he was doing was wrong and being in school calling you names, gay,\nfaggot. I kind of put it in the past, you know. Kind of made a gap for that and put it\nbehind me. I moved forward with my life, you know. [¶] My parents always asked me\n‘that was weird, you know, that he would buy all that stuff, he would do this.’ And I\n\n                                             6\n\fwould be like, ‘I don’t know. He just liked me.’ But deep down I never came up open to\nanybody. [¶] The only person I came up opened to was my wife and that’s after having\nkids. It does take a hit to me knowing that I have kids and the thing that happened to\nme.”\n              A felony complaint was filed by the People on March 7, 2011.\n\n\nPretrial Motion to Dismiss\n              The information was filed on January 5, 2012, and amended on February\n24, 2012, alleging that between December 1, 1994 and August 25, 1995, defendant\ncommitted a lewd and lascivious act upon the victim. Defendant moved to dismiss the\ninformation for denial of due process and speedy trial. For purposes of the motion, the\nlawyers on both sides stipulated to the admission of certain facts and documents:\n              1) That Wallace’s August 25, 1995 memorandum “accurately reflects his\nactions and observations of that date.” Wallace’s memorandum includes: “[T.N.]’s\nfather arrived and stated that he had been delivering groceries. He was apprised of the\nsituation and told that other agencies would be contacting him regarding his son’s\nrelations with GONZALEZ. SSA Salacup asked [T.N.’s father] if he was aware of\nGONZALEZ’s previous history and he stated that he knew that GONZALEZ had some\nproblems before but was not aware of them. He stated that he and his wife had noticed a\nchange in their son’s behavior but did not understand the change. He stated that his son\nspent a lot of time alone with GONZALEZ because they trusted him. He stated that he\nleft [T.N.] with GONZALEZ this morning telling them he would return later to pick them\nup.” Also in the memorandum is the following: “I contacted Debbie Sherwood of the\nChild Abuse Registry who took a report regarding the events and circumstances\nregarding GONZALEZ and his relationship with T.N. She stated that it appeared that\nGONZALEZ was molesting children again and stated that she would be forwarding a\nreport to the Santa Ana Police Department for an immediate investigation.”\n\n                                            7\n\f               2) The August 25, 1995, Orange County Social Services Agency Child\nAbuse Report, that was forwarded to the Santa Ana and Garden Grove Police\nDepartments.\n               3) Defendant’s parole records prepared on or about September 3, 1995. A\nreport in those records states: “It would appear that the parolee in actuality has numerous\ncounts of violation of a special condition as he was seen pictured with his teams of soccer\nplayer[s]; all of which were minor children in addition to his other violations. The\nparolee continues to be a very dangerous person and has not abided by parole since his\nlast release from a violation. In view of his involvement in the instant offenses it is\nrecommended that he be returned to custody for a maximum amount of time as he\ncontinues to be a predatory individual.”\n               4) “Defendant Efren Gonzalez was arrested on or about August 25, 1995, at\nthe office of the INS. Defendant was then turned over to the custody of the [California\nDepartment of Correction] CDC and faced violation, and was adjudicated in violation . . .\nDefendant remained in Orange County Jail until he was adjudicated guilty on February\n18, 2000, and then sentenced to 172 months in state prison with credits to that date\ntotaling approximately one year. That sentence was completed on January 19, 2011.”\n               5) On January 18, 2011, the CDC obtained a 45-day hold to complete\nevaluation of Defendant as a “Sexually Violent Predator” . . . . On March 1, 2011, the\nPeople filed a civil petition . . . to have Defendant committed as an SVP . . . . The People\nthereafter filed this case on March 7, 2011.\n               6) Both the victim and his parents indicated that no police officers\ncontacted them until they were contacted on February 28, 2011.\n               At the hearing on the motion to dismiss, an officer from the Garden Grove\nPolice Department testified the department’s records revealed that defendant registered as\na sex offender in 1993. Defendant’s counsel argued at the hearing: “. . . And then the\nlast thing I would say is when we’re looking at the prejudice, I believe that all we need to\n\n                                               8\n\fshow is any small prejudice, and then it would go to whether the delay was unreasonable,\nand I don’t know what the reasonable amount is, but 16 years with absolutely no new\ndevelopments, zero, zero. It went back to something that was prepared the day of the\narrest. The date on the memo is the same day he was arrested. It was prepared the same\nday. It’s been sitting there the whole time and there has been no justification whatsoever\nfor the delay. There is absolutely zero. . . . They had everything they needed to go out to\nthe house, talk to the guy, 20-minute conversation, and file the case. So whose fault is\nthat? Well, that’s going to be law enforcement 100 percent.” The motion to dismiss was\ndenied.\n\n\nPosttrial Motion to Strike\n              On March 1, 2013, the court heard defendant’s Romero [People v.

In ruling on defendant’s motion, the\ncourt stated: “When the court looks at this case, yes, yes, the actual sex acts are not\namong the worst. But that’s like saying a particular murder is not as bad as the Night\nStalker or something. I’m not sure what that proves. [¶] The probation report talks about\naggravating and mitigating factors. Callous and cruel, yes. Victim vulnerable and\nyoung, yes. Planned, absolutely. Even starting with the soccer team. A violation of\ntrust, yes. One misdemeanor and five felony prior convictions, yes. Prior state prison\ncommitment, yes. On parole when this occurred, yes. Three psychologists saying he is a\nconfirmed pedophile, yes. SARATSO3—that’s an acronym saying he is high risk — yes.\nHe not only qualifies under the One Strike law, but under the Habitual Criminal law\n667.71, yes. [¶] [T.]N., though we may look as criminal laws that these acts aren’t so\nbad, compared to what we see sometimes, [T.]N. was affected.

Well, it’s significant that though that’s been on the books for quite some time,\nthere’s no case law as far as I know, no case finding that to be cruel and unusual. [¶]\nNow, it’s true you have not only the One Strike law here but it’s tripled because of the\nthree strikes. But the court can’t find that to be cruel and unusual, despite the good\nbriefing by the defense.

The prosecution mounted an\ninvestigation only when [defendant] was due to be paroled in 2011 on his most recent\nprior case. Then, [defendant] was detained for evaluation for potential civil commitment\nunder the SVP law. . . . In the course of that evaluation, the prosecution tracked down\n[T.N.], who then claimed [defendant] had molested him years ago, and this criminal\nprosecution was filed days later.”\n              “Notwithstanding any other limitation of time described in this chapter, a\ncriminal complaint may be filed within one year of the date of a report to a California law\nenforcement agency by a person of any age alleging that he or she, while under the age of\n18 years, was the victim of a crime described in Section 261, 286, 288, 288a, 288.5, or\n289, or Section 289.5 . . . .” (§ 803, subd. (f)(1).)\n              “A defendant’s state and federal constitutional speedy trial rights [citation]\ndo not attach before the defendant is arrested or a charging document has been filed.\n[Citation.] Nonetheless, a defendant is not without recourse if a delay in filing charges is\nprejudicial and unjustified. The statute of limitations is usually considered the primary\n\n                                              10\n\fguarantee against overly stale criminal charges [citation], but the right of due process\nprovides additional protection, safeguarding a criminal defendant’s interest in fair\nadjudication by preventing unjustified delays that weaken the defense through the\ndimming of memories, the death or disappearance of witnesses, and the loss or\ndestruction of material physical evidence.

Although\n“under California law, negligent, as well as purposeful, delay in bringing charges may,\nwhen accompanied by a showing of prejudice, violate due process. . . .” (Id. at p. 1255.)\n“If the delay was merely negligent, a greater showing of prejudice would be required to\nestablish a due process violation.” (Id. at p. 1256.) If the defendant fails to meet the\nburden of showing prejudice, there is no need to determine whether the delay was\njustified. (Serna v. Superior Court (1985) 40 Cal.3d. 239, 249.)\n                “Prejudice may be shown by ‘“loss of material witnesses due to lapse of\ntime [citation] or loss of evidence because of fading memories attributable to the delay.”’\n[Citations.]” (People v.

Without those individuals, defendant\nargues, he has been unable to challenge T.N. and his family about their present position\nthey were not contacted in 1995. Defendant also argues T.N.’s dulled memory about\n\n                                              11\n\fwhen the acts occurred has prevented him from contacting witnesses who might have\nbeen available earlier. He also points out the INS took some soccer photos from\ndefendant in 1995, and as a result, he has been unable to track down other boys on the\nteam or their parents to use for impeachment purposes or character testimony.\n              With regard to the Disneyland trip, defendant points out that during his\ntestimony, T.N. said he could not recall who else went with them. Without the benefit of\nT.N.’s memory, defendant now argues, he was unable to develop an argument that\ndefendant did not give T.N. “special treatment as a means of grooming him as a victim.”\n              It would be difficult for this court to conclude there was no negligence here.\nRepresentatives of the federal government, the County of Orange, the City of Santa Ana\nand the City of Garden Grove were given information in 1995 warranting further\ninvestigation about child molestation. We will never know whether or not each agency\nthought another agency was performing an investigation. Nonetheless, while defendant\nargues a litany of possible consequences, he has not pointed us to any witness whose\nmemory was dulled to his detriment. Both Ruben L. and T.N. had hazy memories\nregarding some details, but we don’t find any prejudice to defendant as a result. T.N.\ntestified that it was not until he reached adulthood and had children of his own, that he\nwas ready to confide his secret to his wife. In fact, when he was specifically asked about\nmolestation by Wallace in 1995, he denied it. Thus, there is a strong indication he would\nnot have revealed the true facts to detectives had they investigated the matter in 1995.\nWallace did not remember much, but his detailed memorandum was kept. Defendant’s\narguments about alibi evidence are mere speculation. Soccer photographs, showing\ndefendant with a team of little boys, would more likely than not have undermined, rather\nthan assisted, his defense.\n              Under the law, we cannot presume prejudice. Under the circumstances we\nfind in this record, we cannot conclude defendant was actually prejudiced by the lengthy\n\n\n\n                                             12\n\fprefiling delay. Thus, we do not conclude the trial court abused its discretion in denying\ndefendant’s motion to dismiss.\n\n\nRomero Motion\n              Defendant next contends the trial court erred by failing to exercise its\ndiscretion to strike at least one strike pursuant to People v.

The\ncourt’s ruling on such a motion is reviewable for abuse of discretion. (People v.\nCarmony (2004) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2521321\"><a href=\"/opinion/2521321/people-v-carmony/\"><span class=\"volume\">33</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">367</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 374-375.) A trial court abuses its discretion only if its\nruling is “so irrational or arbitrary that no reasonable person could agree with it.” (Id. at\np. 377.)\n              The Three Strikes scheme is intended to limit courts’ discretion in\nsentencing repeat offenders. There exists no discretionary sentencing choice, unless the\nsentencing court determines that an exception should be made because defendant is\ndeemed to fall outside the spirit of the Three Strikes law. This analysis includes\nconsidering remoteness and the nonviolent nature of prior offenses. (See People v.\nBishop (1997) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">56</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1245</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.) When deciding whether to strike a prior, “weight\n\n                                              13\n\fmust be accorded to factors intrinsic to the scheme, such as the nature and circumstances\nof the defendant’s present felonies and prior serious and/or violent felony convictions,\nand the particulars of the his background, character, and prospects.

Williams (1998) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1125054\"><a href=\"/opinion/1125054/people-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">148</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 161.)\n              State legislatures enacting Three Strikes laws made a deliberate policy\nchoice that individuals who have repeatedly engaged in serious or violent criminal\nbehavior, and whose conduct has not been deterred by more conventional punishment\napproaches, must be isolated from society to protect the public safety. (Ewing v.\nCalifornia, supra, 538 U.S. at p. 24.) “In imposing a three strikes sentence, the State’s\ninterest is not merely punishing the offense of conviction, or the ‘triggering’ offense: ‘It\nis in addition the interest . . . in dealing in a harsher manner with those who by repeated\ncriminal acts have shown that they are simply incapable of conforming to the norms of\nsociety as established by its criminal law.’ [Citations.]” (Id. at p. 29.)\n              Here the court very carefully and meticulously analyzed the state of affairs\nsurrounding defendant’s present crime and past crimes prior to denying his motion to\nstrike. Under the circumstances we find in this record, we cannot conclude the court\nabused its discretion.\n\n\nRestitution/Parole Revocation Order\n              Lastly, defendant contends the court violated his ex post facto rights when\nit imposed a restitution fine and parole revocation fine in the amount of $280 because his\ncrime occurred before the change in the law. He requests that we reduce the amount to\n$200.\n              In the instant matter, the trial court stated: “The court would impose a $280\nrestitution fine. If the defendant is ever released on parole and violates that parole,\nanother $280.” Defendant waived the right to be present at any future restitution hearing.\n\n\n\n                                              14\n\f             At the time of the offenses, the minimum restitution and parole revocation\nfines were $200. On January 1, 2012, the statutory minimum restitution fine was\nincreased to $240, and on January 1, 2013, the minimum restitution fine was increased to\n$280. (§ 1202.4, subd. (b)(1).)\n             As defendant cites us to nothing in the record to support his implied\ncontention the court intended to impose the minimum fine permitted by law, we deem this\nargument waived.
