Mersaides McCauley was shot\nand killed by her ex-boyfriend Glenford Martinez as she\nleft the parking lot of her church in Chicago. Martinez\nthen turned the gun on himself. At the time of the murder-\nsuicide, Martinez was on parole for an earlier homicide\nand had a history of harassing and assaulting McCauley\n\f2                                               No. 09-3561\n\nin violation of his parole and a court order of protection\nissued on her behalf. Chicago law-enforcement and\nIllinois corrections officials were aware of these viola-\ntions and could have ensured that Martinez was\ndetained without bail, but they neither issued a parole-\nviolation warrant nor arrested him for violating the\norder of protection.\n  After Mersaides’s death, her father, Brewster McCauley,\nas administrator of her estate, filed suit in state court\nagainst the City of Chicago and several of its officials,\nthe Illinois Department of Corrections (“IDOC”) and its\ndirector, and Martinez’s estate. The complaint alleged\n13 separate federal and state claims for relief; those rele-\nvant here are equal-protection claims against the City\nof Chicago and the IDOC director.\n  The city and state defendants removed the case to\nfederal court and promptly moved to dismiss. The\ndistrict court granted the motion. The court held that\nfemale victims of domestic violence are not a “suspect”\nor “protected” class for purposes of equal-protection\nanalysis, so McCauley’s equal-protection claim against\nthe City failed as a matter of law. The court also held\nthat McCauley’s claim against the IDOC director was\nbarred by the Eleventh Amendment because the claim\nsought damages from the director in his official capacity.\nMcCauley asked for leave to conduct limited discovery\nin the hope of finding a basis for a personal-capacity equal-\nprotection claim against the IDOC director. The dis-\ntrict court denied this request. McCauley appealed.\n  We affirm, although on different grounds. The com-\nplaint does not plausibly state a policy-or-practice equal-\n\fNo. 09-3561                                               3\n\nprotection claim against the City. It contains only general-\nized allegations that the City failed to have specific\npolicies in effect to protect victims of domestic violence\nfrom harm inflicted by those who violate their parole\nor court orders of protection by committing acts of domes-\ntic violence. The complaint alleges, in essence, that the\nCity failed to single out domestic-violence victims as a\nclass for special protection, not that the City denied this\nclass of victims equal protection.\n  McCauley does not contest the dismissal of his equal-\nprotection claim against the IDOC director in his official\ncapacity, but he does seek review of the court’s denial of\nhis request for limited discovery for the purpose of\nfinding a basis for a personal-capacity claim. At oral\nargument, however, McCauley’s counsel admitted he\nhad no reason to believe the IDOC director had any\npersonal involvement in supervising Martinez’s parole,\nlet alone any of the events leading to Mersaides’s\ndeath. Accordingly, the district court properly denied\nthe request for Rule 12(b)(6) discovery.\n\n\n                      I. Background\n   In 1993 Martinez was convicted of murder and\nattempted murder and sentenced to 28 years in prison.\nHe was released in 2006 and placed on mandatory super-\nvised release for three years. In November 2007 Martinez\nwas arrested and charged with domestic battery for\nallegedly choking Mersaides McCauley, his former girl-\nfriend, until she lost consciousness. Two days later an\nIllinois state court entered an emergency order of pro-\n\f4                                              No. 09-3561\n\ntection against Martinez on behalf of Mersaides. Later\nthat month the court issued a plenary order of protec-\ntion. Both orders prohibited Martinez from having any\ncontact with Mersaides.\n  On two separate occasions, the Cook County State’s\nAttorney’s Office informed Martinez’s parole officer at\nIDOC of the battery charge and arrest. The arrest was a\nparole violation and subjected Martinez to immediate\ndetention without bail until his trial on the domestic-\nbattery charge. Despite having received this informa-\ntion, no one at IDOC ever issued a parole-violation\nwarrant against Martinez. After his release on bail, Marti-\nnez continued to contact Mersaides, repeatedly violating\nthe orders of protection. The complaint alleges that Chi-\ncago police were aware of these violations but never\narrested Martinez.\n  That Martinez remained a free man ended tragically\nfor Mersaides. As she was leaving a church service on\nthe evening of April 6, 2008, Martinez blocked her\nvehicle with his own, trapping her in the church\nparking lot. He shot her multiple times, and she died of\nthe gunshot wounds 30 minutes later. After leaving\nthe scene, Martinez turned the gun on himself and com-\nmitted suicide.\n  Mersaides’s father, Brewster McCauley, filed this suit\nas special administrator of his daughter’s estate. The\ncomplaint alleged 13 federal and state claims (primarily\nfor deprivation of due process and equal protection, and\nfor wrongful death) against the City of Chicago and\nunidentified Chicago police officers, IDOC, various IDOC\n\fNo. 09-3561                                              5\n\nofficials, then-IDOC Director Roger Walker, and Martinez’s\nestate. The city and state defendants removed the case to\nfederal court and moved to dismiss pursuant to Rule\n12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The\ndistrict court granted the motion, dismissed the federal\nclaims, and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdic-\ntion over the state-law claims. See 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3);\nHansen v. Bd. of Trs. of Hamilton Se. Sch. Corp., 551 F.3d\n599, 607 (7th Cir. 2008).\n  Only the equal-protection claims against the City and\nWalker are at issue on appeal. The claim against the City\nwas a policy-or-practice claim under Monell v. Depart-\nment of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658, 694 (1978). The com-\nplaint variously alleges that the City failed to have ade-\nquate policies in place for the protection of female\nvictims of domestic violence. The court began its analysis\nof this claim by rejecting McCauley’s contention that\nfemale victims of domestic violence are a “suspect class”\nfor equal-protection purposes. The judge opted for\nrational-basis review and then concluded that to avoid\ndismissal, McCauley needed to show that Mersaides\nwas a member of a protected class. Noting that “protected\nclass” and “suspect class” mean the same thing in equal-\nprotection doctrine, the judge held that McCauley\ncould not establish a necessary prerequisite for a claim\nunder the Equal Protection Clause; that is, because\nMersaides did not belong to a suspect class, she did not\nbelong to a protected class either. That meant, the court\nheld, that McCauley could not satisfy the first require-\nment of a prima facie case of discrimination under the\nEqual Protection Clause. Finally, the court held that the\n\f6                                                No. 09-3561\n\ncomplaint failed to state a “class of one” equal-protection\nclaim against the City.\n  As for the claim against IDOC Director Walker, the\ndistrict court held that the Eleventh Amendment’s\nsovereign-immunity protections barred McCauley from\nrecovering damages against him in his official capacity.\nSee Bd. of Trs. of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356, 363\n(2001); Peirick v. IUPUI Athletics Dep’t, 510 F.3d 681, 695\n(7th Cir. 2007); Joseph v. Bd. of Regents of the Univ. of Wis.\nSys., 432 F.3d 746, 748 (7th Cir. 2005). McCauley asked the\ncourt for a limited opportunity to conduct discovery in\nan effort to find a factual basis for a personal-capacity\nclaim against Walker. The court denied this request,\nessentially holding that it would be futile. Because\nMcCauley’s equal-protection claim against the City\nfailed as a matter of law, the court thought any similar\nclaim against Walker in his personal capacity would fail\nas well.\n\n\n                      II. Discussion\nA. McCauley’s Equal-Protection Claim Against the City\n   We review de novo the district court’s order dismissing\nthe equal-protection claim against the City. Brooks v. Ross,\n578 F.3d 574, 578 (7th Cir. 2009). To avoid dismissal,\nMcCauley’s complaint must contain allegations that\n“ ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’ ”\nAshcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1949 (2009) (quoting Bell\nAtl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)). “A claim\nhas facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual\n\fNo. 09-3561                                                   7\n\ncontent that allows the court to draw the reasonable\ninference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct\nalleged.” Id.\n  We note first that the district court’s analysis of\nMcCauley’s claim against the City suffers from some\nanalytical confusion; it conflates several distinct strains\nof equal-protection doctrine. The court began by\nholding that strict scrutiny did not apply because\nfemale victims of domestic violence are not a “suspect\nclass” for purposes of equal-protection analysis. The\ncourt then opted for rational-basis review, bypassing\nany form of intermediate scrutiny. The judge then took\na detour into the caselaw that applies to claims of dis-\ncrimination in public employment under the Equal Pro-\ntection Clause, citing Brown v. Budz, 398 F.3d 904, 916\n(7th Cir. 2005), and Salas v. Wisconsin Department of Cor-\nrections, 493 F.3d 913, 926 (7th Cir. 2007), for the ele-\nments of a prima facie case under the burden-shifting\napproach borrowed from Title VII. Using this framework,\nthe court held that because female domestic-violence\nvictims are not a protected class, McCauley could not\nestablish the first requirement of a prima facie case of\ndiscrimination. Finally, the court held that because the\nequal-protection claim was premised on Mersaides’s\ngroup affiliation as a victim of domestic violence, the\ncomplaint did not state a claim for a “class of one” equal-\nprotection violation. See generally, Vill. of Willowbrook\nv. Olech, 528 U.S. 562, 564 (2000) (recognizing a “class of\none” equal-protection claim); Srail v. Vill. of Lisle, Ill., 588\nF.3d 940, 943-44 (7th Cir. 2009) (discussing the elements\nof a “class of one” claim).\n\f8                                                   No. 09-3561\n\n  This analysis is problematic for several reasons. For\nstarters, analyzing the equal-protection claim under class-\nof-one doctrine was error. This is not a class-of-one\ncase; McCauley has never contended that it is. Nor\nis the burden-shifting prima facie case methodology\nappropriate here. That formula has been used in\nemployment-discrimination claims arising under the\nEqual Protection Clause or 42 U.S.C. § 1981 because equal-\nprotection claims alleging discrimination in public em-\nployment can be analogized to claims under Title VII.\nImporting the prima facie case requirements from Title\nVII doctrine makes sense in the public-employment\ncontext, but that approach does not apply more\nbroadly to all equal-protection cases. Finally, whether\nfemale domestic-violence victims are properly con-\nsidered a “suspect” or “protected” class for equal-protec-\ntion analysis is a merits question. The answer deter-\nmines what level of judicial review applies to the defen-\ndant’s actions, see, e.g., Srail, 588 F.3d at 943, a question\nnot normally appropriate for resolution at the\npleadings stage.1\n\n\n\n1\n  We note for completeness that McCauley makes alternative\narguments on this point. He first argues that female victims\nof domestic violence ought to be recognized as a suspect class\nfor equal-protection analysis, requiring strict scrutiny of the\nCity’s actions. He argues in the alternative that the claim\nshould be treated as more generally alleging discrimination\non the basis of gender, which calls for the application of inter-\nmediate scrutiny. See United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515,\n531 (1996).\n\fNo. 09-3561                                                  9\n\n  Though the district court’s analysis was faulty, the\nequal-protection claim against the City was properly\ndismissed. To state a Monell claim against the City for\nviolation of Mersaides’s right to equal protection,\nMcCauley was required to “plead[] factual content that\nallows the court to draw the reasonable inference” that\nthe City maintained a policy, custom, or practice of in-\ntentional discrimination against a class of persons to\nwhich Mersaides belonged. See Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1949;\nMonell, 436 U.S. at 694; Srail, 588 F.3d at 943. He did not\nmeet this burden.\n  In reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint under the\nplausibility standard announced in Twombly and Iqbal, we\naccept the well-pleaded facts in the complaint as true,\nbut legal conclusions and conclusory allegations merely\nreciting the elements of the claim are not entitled to\nthis presumption of truth. Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1951. After\nexcising the allegations not entitled to the presumption,\nwe determine whether the remaining factual allega-\ntions “plausibly suggest an entitlement to relief.” Id. The\n“[f]actual allegations must be enough to raise a right\nto relief above the speculative level.” Twombly, 550 U.S.\nat 555. That is, the complaint must contain “allegations\nplausibly suggesting (not merely consistent with)” an\nentitlement to relief. Id. at 557. If the allegations give rise\nto an “obvious alternative explanation,” Iqbal, 129 S. Ct.\nat 1951; Twombly, 550 U.S. at 567, then the complaint\nmay “stop[] short of the line between possibility and\nplausibility of ‘entitle[ment] to relief,’ ” Twombly, 550 U.S.\nat 557. Making the plausibility determination is “a con-\ntext-specific task that requires the reviewing court to\n\f10                                              No. 09-3561\n\ndraw on its judicial experience and common sense.”\nIqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1950.\n  We have interpreted Twombly and Iqbal to require the\nplaintiff to “provid[e] some specific facts” to support\nthe legal claims asserted in the complaint. Brooks, 578\nF.3d at 581. The degree of specificity required is not\neasily quantified, but “the plaintiff must give enough\ndetails about the subject-matter of the case to present\na story that holds together.” Swanson v. Citibank, N.A., 614\nF.3d 400, 404 (7th Cir. 2010). The required level of\nfactual specificity rises with the complexity of the claim.\nId. at 405 (“A more complex case . . . will require more\ndetail, both to give the opposing party notice of what\nthe case is all about and to show how, in the plaintiff’s\nmind at least, the dots should be connected.”).\n  Brooks and Swanson help illustrate the factual heft\nrequired to survive a motion to dismiss after Twombly\nand Iqbal. In Brooks the plaintiff was prosecuted for\nofficial misconduct and wire fraud relating to his duties\nas a Prison Review Board member. 578 F.3d at 578. He\nwas acquitted on these charges and filed suit alleging\na vast conspiracy by fellow board members, a state\npolice officer, an IDOC employee, and the Illinois\nAttorney General based on their participation in or co-\noperation with the investigation against him. Id. The\ncomplaint alleged that the defendants “knowingly, inten-\ntionally[,] and maliciously prosecute[d]” him in retalia-\ntion for his exercise of constitutionally protected rights.\nId. at 582. We held that this was “nothing more” than a\n“formulaic recitation of the cause of action,” insufficient\n\fNo. 09-3561                                               11\n\nto state a claim under Twombly and Iqbal. Id. The\nremaining allegations—primarily explaining each defen-\ndant’s role in the investigation—were just as consistent\nwith a lawful investigation as an illegal conspiracy to\nretaliate against Brooks. Id. at 581 (“The behavior Brooks\nhas alleged that the defendants engaged in is just as\nconsistent with lawful conduct as it is with wrongdoing.”).\nAccordingly, we affirmed the dismissal of the com-\nplaint. Id. at 582.\n   In Swanson, on the other hand, we applied Twombly/\nIqbal and held that the plaintiff’s allegations were suf-\nficient to survive a motion to dismiss on at least some\nof her claims. Swanson, an African-American loan appli-\ncant who was turned down for a loan, claimed that that\nthe denial was based on her race in violation of the\nFair Housing Act (among other causes of action). 614 F.3d\nat 402-03. Her complaint alleged that the defendants\nintentionally undervalued her home and that they did\nso because of her race. Id. at 403. She alleged that a third-\nparty appraiser had valued the home at $240,000, much\nhigher than the defendant’s valuation of $170,000. Id.\nWe held that because Swanson’s claim of housing dis-\ncrimination was uncomplicated, Swanson’s pleading\nburden under Twombly and Iqbal was satisfied. Id. at 404.\nHer complaint contained factual allegations identifying\n(1) who discriminated against her; (2) the type of dis-\ncrimination that occurred; and (3) when the discrimina-\ntion took place. Id. at 405. We held that given the straight-\nforward nature of the claim, Twombly/Iqbal required\nnothing more. Id. (citing Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A.,\n534 U.S. 506, 511-12 (2002)).\n\f12                                              No. 09-3561\n\n  This case is more like Brooks than Swanson. Many of\nthe alleged “facts” are actually legal conclusions or ele-\nments of the cause of action, which may be disregarded\non a motion to dismiss. See Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1951. For\nexample, McCauley alleges that the City “has an\nunwritten custom, practice and policy to afford lesser\nprotection or none at all to victims of domestic violence”\nand that “[t]here is no rational basis” for this purported\npolicy. Similarly, McCauley alleged the following:\n     [The City], through its agents, employees and/or\n     servants, acting under color of law, at the level of\n     official policy, practice, and custom, with deliberate,\n     callous, and conscious indifference to McCauley’s\n     constitutional rights, authorized, tolerated, and in-\n     stitutionalized the practices and ratified the illegal\n     conduct herein detailed, and at all times material to\n     this Complaint, [the City] had interrelated de facto\n     policies, practices, and customs.\nThese are the legal elements of the various claims\nMcCauley has asserted; they are not factual allegations\nand as such contribute nothing to the plausibility\nanalysis under Twombly/Iqbal.\n  Once the legal conclusions are disregarded, just one\nparagraph of factual allegations remains:\n     Defendant violated McCauley’s constitutional rights\n     under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 by:\n        a.   failing to provide adequate security and\n             promptly arrest Martinez;\n\fNo. 09-3561                                                13\n\n       b.     failing to promulgate any policy to ensure\n              the prompt arrest of individuals guilty of\n              violating protective orders;\n       c.     maintaining a policy or custom of failing\n              to timely arrest violators of protective orders;\n       d. maintaining a custom and practice of failing\n          to adequately train officers concerning the\n          necessity of promptly arresting individuals\n          guilty of violating protective orders;\n       e.     maintaining a policy or custom of failing to\n              have safeguards in place to ensure that viola-\n              tors of protective orders were timely arrested;\n       f.     failing to have a custom, practice and policy\n              in effect to verify whether someone who is\n              arrested for domestic violence is on parole;\n       g. failing to have a custom, practice and policy\n          to communicate with state officials and law\n          enforcement officials regarding domestic\n          violence arrests;\n       h. failing to have a custom, practice and policy\n          in effect in order to communicate with\n          parole agents on domestic violence arrests;\n       i.     failing to have a custom, practice and policy\n              in effect to verify whether an arrestee of a\n              domestic violence offense is on parole prior\n              to issuing an order of protection; and\n       j.     maintaining a custom, practice and policy of\n              ignoring the seriousness of domestic violence\n              arrests.\n\f14                                               No. 09-3561\n\n   McCauley maintains that these allegations are suf-\nficient to state a Monell equal-protection claim against\nthe City. We disagree. In order to state a facially\nplausible equal-protection claim under Monell, the\nfactual allegations in McCauley’s complaint must allow\nus to draw the reasonable inference that the City estab-\nlished a policy or practice of intentionally discriminating\nagainst female victims of domestic violence in the provi-\nsion of police protection. That is, McCauley needed to\nallege enough “by way of factual content to ‘nudg[e]’ his\nclaim of purposeful discrimination ‘across the line\nfrom conceivable to plausible.’ ” Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1952\n(quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570)).\n   Because the Equal Protection Clause is “concerned . . .\nwith equal treatment rather than with establishing\nentitlements to some minimum of government services,\n[it] does not entitle a person to adequate, or indeed to\nany, police protection.” Hilton v. City of Wheeling, 209\nF.3d 1005, 1007 (7th Cir. 2000); see also DeShaney v.\nWinnebago Cnty. Dep’t of Soc. Servs., 489 U.S. 189, 196\n(1989) (The government’s failure to protect an individual\nfrom private violence is not actionable under the Due\nProcess Clause.). “On the other hand, selective with-\ndrawal of police protection, as when the Southern states\nduring the Reconstruction era refused to give police\nprotection to their black citizens, is the prototypical denial\nof equal protection.” Hilton, 209 F.3d at 1007. The allega-\ntions in the paragraph quoted above do not plausibly\nsuggest that the City maintained a policy or practice of\nselective withdrawal of police protection. To the contrary,\nthe complaint alleges that the City failed to have par-\n\fNo. 09-3561                                               15\n\nticularized practices in place for the special protection of\ndomestic-violence victims. In essence, the complaint\nalleges that the City failed to promulgate specific\npolicies for this particular class of crime victims, not that\nthe City denied this class of victims equal protection. At\nmost, the factual allegations in the complaint plausibly\nsuggest the uneven allocation of limited police-protection\nservices; they do not plausibly suggest that the City\nmaintained an intentional policy or practice of omitting\npolice protection from female domestic-violence victims\nas a class.\n  Just as in Brooks, McCauley’s factual allegations are\nentirely consistent with lawful conduct—here a lawful\nallocation of limited police resources. 578 F.3d at 581. And\nthe complexity of McCauley’s equal-protection claim\ndistinguishes this case from Swanson. The housing-dis-\ncrimination claim at issue in Swanson was quite straight-\nforward. Putting the defendants on notice of what it\nentailed was simple, so Swanson did not need to plead\nmuch by way of factual content in her complaint. There,\nin the absence of an obvious legal alternative explana-\ntion, pleading the “who, what, and when” of the dis-\ncrimination claim was enough. See Swanson, 614 F.3d at\n405. Here, McCauley’s equal-protection claim is more\ncomplicated and counterintuitive. Yet he has alleged\nonly that the City failed to have particularized safe-\nguards in place for the special protection of domestic-\nviolence victims. For the reasons we have explained, this\ndoes not state a Monell equal-protection claim against\nthe City. This claim was properly dismissed.\n\f16                                                 No. 09-3561\n\nB. Predismissal Discovery Against Walker\n  McCauley does not challenge the district court’s order\ndismissing the official-capacity equal-protection claim\nagainst Walker on Eleventh Amendment grounds. In-\nstead, he argues that the court should have allowed him\nto conduct limited discovery regarding Walker’s per-\nsonal involvement in the events leading to Mersaides’s\nmurder on the chance he might unearth a basis for a\nclaim against Walker in his individual capacity. We\nreview the denial of McCauley’s discovery request for\nabuse of discretion. Griffin v. Foley, 542 F.3d 209, 223\n(7th Cir. 2008).\n   The district court’s refusal to authorize Rule 12(b)(6)\ndiscovery was based largely on the court’s view that any\npersonal-capacity claim against Walker would suffer\nfrom the same deficiencies as the Monell claim against\nthe City; namely, that Mersaides was not a member of a\n“suspect” or “protected” class for equal-protection pur-\nposes. For the reasons we have explained, this analysis\nis flawed. We nonetheless affirm on other grounds.\n  To determine whether pre-Rule 12(b)(6) discovery\nshould have been available in this case, we need not\ndecide the broader and more provocative question\nwhether it should be available in general, in light of the\nTwombly/Iqbal pleading regime.2 This is not a proper case\n\n\n2\n  Proposals for some form of “Rule 12(b)(6) discovery” have\nproliferated in academic circles in the wake of Twombly and\nIqbal. See, e.g., Arthur R. Miller, From Conley to Twombly to\n                                                  (continued...)\n\fNo. 09-3561                                                      17\n\nfor Rule 12(b)(6) discovery in any event. McCauley’s\ncounsel conceded at oral argument that he “has nothing”\nto suggest that Walker was personally involved in any of\nthe events leading to Mersaides’s death. Indeed, based on\nthe complaint, there is no reason at all to think the IDOC\ndirector had any personal role in Martinez’s parole super-\nvision, much less the specific events preceding Mersaides’s\ndeath. Accordingly, the denial of McCauley’s request\nfor Rule 12(b)(6) discovery was not an abuse of discretion.\n                                                       A FFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n2\n   (...continued)\nIqbal: A Double Play on the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 60\nD UKE L.

R EV . 473 (2010).\nThe theory underlying this effort is that the plausibility\nstandard for surviving a motion to dismiss requires new tools\nto meet the higher bar, especially where the information\nnecessary to survive a motion to dismiss is wholly or largely\nin the defendant’s hands. See Miller, supra, at 105 (“Since the\ncombined effect of Twombly, Iqbal, and the summary judgment\ntrilogy is to require a plaintiff to have greater knowledge\nconcerning his claim either before instituting an action or\nimmediately thereafter, inequality of information access\nduring those critical time frames poses a significant—if not\nthe most significant—problem for many people seeking af-\nfirmative relief.”).\n\f18                                                  No. 09-3561\n\n  H AMILTON, Circuit Judge, dissenting in part. I agree\nwith my colleagues that plaintiff has failed to state a\nclaim against defendant Walker. I respectfully dissent\nfrom the rejection of plaintiff’s equal protection claim\nagainst the City of Chicago. I am skeptical about\nplaintiff’s ability to prove the claim, but his complaint\nshould be sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss for\nfailure to state a claim, even under the new and\nsubjective pleading standards announced in Ashcroft v.\nIqbal, 129 S. Ct. 1937 (2009). I explain first my skepticism,\nthen some of the problems raised by Iqbal, and finally\nwhy the complaint should survive the motion to dismiss.\n   Mr. McCauley’s suit seeks to enforce the Fourteenth\nAmendment’s equal protection requirements on the\ndecisions of a major city police force about how to\nallocate its resources. Plaintiff’s only viable equal pro-\ntection theory is that the Chicago police department\nmade a deliberate decision to minimize the police pro-\ntection available to victims of domestic violence, and\nthat the police did so because of an intentional animus\nagainst women, who make up the vast majority of adult\nvictims of domestic violence. See Bureau of Justice Statis-\ntics, U.S. Dept. of Justice, Family Violence Statistics 11 (2005),\navailable at http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/fvs.\npdf (last visited Oct. 17, 2011) (finding that women\nwere 84% of spouse abuse victims and 86% of victims\nof abuse at the hands of a boyfriend or girlfriend).\n  As I said, I am skeptical about the plaintiff’s ability to\nprove such a claim. We require proof of intentional\nanimus and do not hold municipalities liable for a mere\n\fNo. 09-3561                                             19\n\nfailure to arrest, no matter how tragic the consequences\nappear in hindsight. E.g., Hernandez v. City of Goshen, 324\nF.3d 535, 538 (7th Cir. 2003), following DeShaney v.\nWinnebago County Dep’t of Social Services, 489 U.S. 189\n(1989). This approach avoids difficult questions that are\nall but unanswerable by courts in practice. To begin\nwith, how should the police allocate their resources? And\nhow should a federal court measure equality in the al-\nlocation of those resources? Should we focus on patrol\nofficers on the beat per square mile? Per capita? Based on\nneighborhood crime rates? How should we gauge the\nseriousness of different crimes? Surely armed robberies\ndeserve more attention than acts of vandalism, and\nattacks on vulnerable persons probably deserve more\nattention than bar fights.\n  A few moments of reflection could generate a list of\nmany more variables and factors that a sensible citizen\nwould want the police to consider in deciding how to\nallocate their resources for crime prevention. And no\nmatter how a police department decides to allocate its\nresources, it will be possible to identify categories of\ncrime victims who receive below-average attention from\nthe police. There is no way to ensure complete equality,\nand the infinite variations in the ways to measure\nequality require any court considering the question to\nact with great caution.\n  And yet the courthouse door must remain open to\nclaims that the police are systematically denying some\npeople the literal equal protection of the law. The history\nof the Reconstruction after the Civil War reminds us that\n\f20                                                No. 09-3561\n\nstate and local governments deliberately and systemati-\ncally denied equal protection of the laws to former\nslaves and their descendants. More recently, the\nJim Crow laws, internment of Japanese Americans, segre-\ngation, voting restrictions, gender discrimination, and\nharassment of Muslim Americans in the wake of the\nSeptember 11, 2001 terrorist attacks all remind us that\nconcerns about equal protection are not just matters of\nbygone history. A deliberate decision to withdraw or\nsubstantially reduce police protection to groups based\non race, national origin, gender, religion, or political\naffiliation should qualify for federal court attention\nand remedies.\n   We and other federal courts have often recognized\nthe legal viability of such claims, even if they are difficult\nto prove. See, e.g., Schroeder v. Hamilton School Dist., 282\nF.3d 946, 957 (7th Cir. 2002) (“the core violation of\nthe equal protection clause is indeed the selective with-\ndrawal of police protection from a disfavored group”)\n(Posner, J., concurring); Hilton v. City of Wheeling, 209\nF.3d 1005, 1007 (7th Cir. 2000), citing Slaughter-House\nCases, 83 U.S. (16 Wall.) 36, 70 (1872); Elliot-Park v.\nManglona, 592 F.3d 1003, 1007-08 (9th Cir. 2010) (refusing\nto dismiss plaintiff’s claim that officers’ failure to investi-\ngate and arrest a drunk driver because of alleged racial\nfavoritism violated equal protection); Price-Cornelison\nv. Brooks, 524 F.3d 1103, 1113-14 (10th Cir. 2008) (affirming\ndenial of qualified immunity where no rational basis\nwas asserted for alleged policy of providing less pro-\ntection to lesbian victims of domestic violence than to\n\fNo. 09-3561                                                21\n\nheterosexual victims), citing Watson v.

City of Philadelphia, 501 F.3d 134, 148-49\n(3d Cir. 2007).\n  As a claim that may seem improbable but not impos-\nsible, difficult to prove but not implausible, this case\nposes a test for federal civil pleading standards in the\nwake of Ashcroft v. Iqbal. In Iqbal, plaintiffs alleged that\nthey had been mistreated by federal law enforcement\nofficials because of their religion and their national\norigin in the wake of the September 11, 2001 terrorist\nattacks on the United States. The appeal concerned the\nplaintiffs’ claims against the Attorney General of the\nUnited States and the Director of the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation. The Supreme Court recognized that the\nalleged actions of the federal law enforcement officials\ncould have been perfectly legal so long as they were\nbased on even-handed application of the law, but that\nmistreatment based deliberately on religion or national\norigin could violate the Constitution. 129 S. Ct. at 1952.\n  The Court held in Iqbal that the plaintiffs had failed\nto allege a plausible claim of religious or national origin\ndiscrimination against Attorney General Ashcroft\nand FBI Director Mueller. Although the plaintiffs had\nalleged discriminatory intent, the Court found that the\ncomplaint did not “contain any factual allegation suf-\n\f22                                              No. 09-3561\n\nficient to plausibly suggest petitioners’ discriminatory\nstate of mind.” Id. The Court wrote that determining\nwhether a claim is plausible would “be a context-specific\ntask that requires the reviewing court to draw on its\njudicial experience and common sense.” Id. at 1950. The\nmethod of analysis employed by the Court in Iqbal in-\nvolved first “identifying the allegations in the complaint\nthat are not entitled to the assumption of truth” because\nthey are merely a “formulaic recitation of the elements”\nof the claim and thus “conclusory.” Id. at 1951. The\nCourt then looked only to the portions of the com-\nplaint it deemed to be “factual allegations” to make\na subjective plausibility determination.\n   As a subordinate federal court, it is our responsibility\nto do our best to apply the law as stated in Iqbal. My\ncolleagues do so here, and the Iqbal standard is clearly\ndecisive for the panel majority. The problem here is that\nit also our responsibility to do our best to apply other\nSupreme Court decisions involving pleading standards,\nincluding Leatherman v. Tarrant County Narcotics Intel-\nligence and Coordination Unit, 507 U.S. 163 (1993); Erickson\nv. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89 (2007); and Swierkiewicz v. Sorema\nN.A., 534 U.S. 506 (2002), as well as the Federal Rules\nof Civil Procedure as adopted by the Court and\napproved by Congress, and the form pleadings that\nare part of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and\nthat were also approved by the Court and Congress. Iqbal\nis in serious tension with these other decisions, rules,\nand forms, and the Court’s opinion fails to grapple with\nor resolve that tension. I do not believe it is an exaggera-\n\fNo. 09-3561                                                   23\n\ntion to say that these decisions, rules, and forms simply\nconflict with Iqbal.\n  As a result of this unresolved tension, since Iqbal was\ndecided, the lower federal court decisions seeking to\napply the new “plausibility” standard are wildly incon-\nsistent with each other, and with the conflicting decisions\nof the Supreme Court. Iqbal has also generated a small\nblizzard of articles by law professors and practitioners\ncritiquing the decision and analyzing its implications.\nOne of the most useful and persuasive of those is\nProfessor Arthur Miller’s article, From Conley to Twombly\nto Iqbal: A Double Play on the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,\n60 Duke L. J. 1 (2010). See also, e.g., Robert Bone, Plausibility\nPleading Revisited and Revised: A Comment on Ashcroft v.\nIqbal, 85 Notre Dame L. Rev. 849 (2010); Patricia W.\nHatamyar, The Tao of Pleading: Do Twombly and Iqbal\nMatter Empirically?, 59 Am. U. L. Rev. 553 (2010) (finding\nstatistically significant differences in the treatment of\nmotions to dismiss, particularly with regard to civil\nrights cases); Hon. Colleen McMahon, The Law of Unin-\ntended Consequences: Shockwaves in the Lower Courts after\nBell Atlantic v. Twombly, 41 Suffolk U. L. Rev. 851 (2008).\n  Without revisiting the entirety of this lengthy critique,\nI note below some of the key problems that Iqbal presents\nfor federal district and circuit judges, and the parties\nand attorneys who litigate cases before them:\n First, Iqbal’s reasoning and holding conflict with\nRule 9(b), which requires that a party alleging fraud or\nmistake “state with particularity the circumstances con-\n\f24                                              No. 09-3561\n\nstituting fraud or mistake.” As for other states of mind,\nhowever, the rule provides: “Malice, intent, knowledge,\nand other conditions of a person’s mind may be alleged\ngenerally.” In this context, “generally” means as a conclu-\nsion, without specifying underlying facts that would\nsupport the inference. For example, this provision has\nlong been understood not to require that discriminatory\nintent be alleged with particularity in employment dis-\ncrimination cases. See Swierkiewicz, 534 U.S. at 512 (unani-\nmously rejecting requirement that employment discrim-\nination complaint plead facts satisfying elements of\nprima facie case, because “imposing the Court of Ap-\npeals’ heightened pleading standard in employment\ndiscrimination cases conflicts with Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 8(a)(2)”).\n  Note that Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly endorsed the\ncontinued vitality of Swierkiewicz. 550 U.S. 544, 569-70\n(2007); see also Miller, 60 Duke L. J. at 31. Iqbal also\nseemed to endorse the key Swierkiewicz holding re-\ngarding heightened pleading standards, noting that\nRule 9 “excuses a party from pleading discriminatory\nintent under an elevated pleading standard.” 129 S. Ct. at\n1954 (disclaiming a “rigid rule requiring the detailed\npleading of a condition of mind” as “undesirable”). But\nin the analysis that was actually decisive in the\ncase, however, the Iqbal Court held that under Rule 8\nthe complaint lacked “any factual allegation sufficient\nto plausibly suggest petitioners’ discriminatory state of\nmind.” Id. at 1952. Iqbal does not elaborate on the nature\nand number of specific facts that must be included in\nthe Rule 8 “short and plain statement of the claim” in\n\fNo. 09-3561                                              25\n\norder to achieve plausibility. The Court’s application\nof Rule 8 to impose a more demanding pleading\nstandard for discriminatory intent is not consistent with\nits stated adherence to Rule 9 and its express authoriza-\ntion of general pleading of discriminatory intent and\nmost other states of mind. The Court’s statement about\nRule 9(b) that “ ‘generally’ is a relative term” does not\nsolve the problem or give practical guidance to district\ncourts. See id. at 1954.\n  Second, Iqbal conflicts with other recent Supreme Court\ndecisions. Iqbal did not overrule or question a number\nof the Court’s prior cases on notice pleading. See\nLeatherman, 507 U.S. at 168 (unanimously rejecting height-\nened pleading standard for custom-or-policy claim\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983); Erickson, 551 U.S. at 90 (after\nTwombly, summarily reversing dismissal of pro se\nprisoner’s complaint for deliberate indifference to\nmedical needs where the court of appeals deemed the\ncomplaint too “conclusory” with respect to whether\ndefendant’s actions caused “substantial harm,” and\nfinding that: “The holding departs in so stark a manner\nfrom the pleading standard mandated by the Federal\nRules of Civil Procedure that we grant review.”). Many\ncases, citing Leatherman, reject heightened pleading stan-\ndards for the elements of a Monell custom or policy\nclaim such as the one alleged here. See, e.g., Jackson v.\nMarion County, 66 F.3d 151, 153 (7th Cir. 1995) (“Leatherman\nmakes clear that the federal courts are not to interpolate\na requirement of fact pleading into the federal rules.”).\nAs noted, Iqbal also created tension with Swierkiewicz\nby endorsing its holding while simultaneously ap-\n\f26                                               No. 09-3561\n\npearing to require the same sort of fact-specific\npleading of discriminatory intent that the Swierkiewicz\nCourt rejected.\n  Third, Iqbal conflicts with the form complaints\napproved by the Supreme Court and Congress as part of\nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Rule 84 provides\nthat the forms in the appendix “suffice under these\nrules and illustrate the simplicity and brevity that\nthese rules contemplate.” Iqbal did not purport to over-\nrule or amend Rule 84 or the forms, but it is difficult\nto reconcile the new “plausibility” standard with those\nforms. Many of the approved forms require virtually\nno explanation of the underlying facts as long as the\ndefendant is informed of the event or transaction that\ngave rise to the claim, according to the broad notice\npurpose of the rules.\n   For example, Form 15 is a complaint for the conver-\nsion of property. It is sufficient for the plaintiff to allege\nthat on a stated date at a stated place, “the defendant\nconverted to the defendant’s own use property owned\nby the plaintiff,” and to identify the converted prop-\nerty and state its approximate value. Nothing more\nis needed — no factual details about the defendant’s\nactions, and no allegation concerning the defendant’s\nstate of mind. Under the plausibility standard of Iqbal,\nthis form complaint seems remarkably “conclusory,” yet\nit is sufficient according to Rule 84.\n  Similarly, Form 11 is a complaint for negligence. Apart\nfrom jurisdiction and damages, it is sufficient for the\ncomplaint to say only that on a stated date at a stated\n\fNo. 09-3561                                              27\n\nplace, defendant “negligently drove a motor vehicle\nagainst the plaintiff.” Again, nothing more is needed\nabout just what the defendant did or why those ac-\ntions amounted to negligence. This also seems quite\n“conclusory,” but it is sufficient under Rule 84. But cf.\nBranham v. Dolgencorp, Inc., 2009 WL 2604447, *2\n(W.D. Va. Aug. 24, 2009) (applying Iqbal standard to\ndismiss slip-and-fall negligence complaint because it\nfailed to allege “facts that show how the liquid came to\nbe on the floor, whether the Defendant knew or should\nhave known of the presence of the liquid, or how the\nPlaintiff’s accident occurred”).\n  Even Form 21, which includes a claim to set aside a\nfraudulent conveyance, is remarkably terse. That portion\nof the form complaint says only that on a stated date, the\ndefendant conveyed all or a specified portion of defen-\ndant’s real and personal property to another defendant\n“for the purpose of defrauding the plaintiff and hind-\nering or delaying the collection of the debt.” Again,\nnothing more is needed about the circumstances of\nthe conveyance, and the “general” or “conclusory” allega-\ntion of a purpose to defraud is sufficient. One could go\non with parallel analysis of the other form complaints.\n  Unless one can plausibly explain away the tension\nbetween Iqbal and Rule 9(b) and the Rule 84-endorsed\nform complaints, then Iqbal conflicts with the Rules En-\nabling Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2071 et seq., and the prescribed\nprocess for amending the Federal Rules of Civil Proce-\ndure. See Swierkiewicz, 534 U.S. at 515, citing Leatherman,\n507 U.S. at 168; Hill v. McDonough, 547 U.S. 573, 582 (2006)\n\f28                                                No. 09-3561\n\n(“Specific pleading requirements are mandated by the\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure, and not, as a general\nrule, through case-by-case determinations of the federal\ncourts.”).\n  Fourth, Iqbal’s reliance on the fact/conclusion dichot-\nomy is highly subjective, and returns courts to the long\ndisapproved methods of analysis under the regime of\ncode pleading. See Miller, 60 Duke L. J. at 23-24. Is an\nallegation that “defendant was negligent” or that “defen-\ndant acted with racially discriminatory intent” an allega-\ntion of fact or a conclusion? Calling these assertions\nelements of the claim is not logically sufficient to deter-\nmine when and if they should be denied a presumption of\ntruth. Even in Iqbal, the Court presumed true some as-\nsertions that could be characterized as conclusory, while\ndisapproving of others. See 129 S. Ct. at 1961 (Souter, J.,\ndissenting). Iqbal’s reliance on the fact/conclusion dichot-\nomy makes the difference indeterminate. Application\nof the dichotomy is leading to judge-specific and case-\nspecific differences in outcome that confuse everyone\ninvolved. The long legal history of code pleading, though\nperhaps distant enough in time to have been largely\nforgotten by most of todays’ lawyers and judges, pro-\nvides ample additional evidence on this point.\n  Fifth, Iqbal’s reliance on “judicial experience and\ncommon sense” invites the highly subjective and incon-\nsistent results that have been observed. The Iqbal con-\ncept of plausibility is “context-specific.” 129 S. Ct. at 1950.\nAs a practical matter, the concept invites district judges\nto exercise their individual views of the likely merits of\n\fNo. 09-3561                                               29\n\nthe case at the outset, when the only information\navailable is the complaint. Worse still, an uncritical\nreading of the Court’s “obvious alternative explanation”\nreasoning seems to invite judges to weigh competing\nexplanations for alleged conduct and dismiss cases merely\nbecause they believe one explanation over another. See 129\nS. Ct. at 1951 (referring to “more likely explanations”). In\napplication, this standard bears a striking resemblance to\nthe most stringent pleading requirement in American\ncivil law, for pleading scienter in securities fraud claims,\npursuant to the specific direction of Congress in the\nPrivate Securities Litigation Reform Act. See 15 U.S.C.\n§ 78u-4(b)(2) (requiring plaintiff to “state with par-\nticularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the\ndefendant acted with the required state of mind”); accord,\nTellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues and Rights, Ltd., 551 U.S. 308,\n323-24 (2007) (explaining that a “strong inference” must be\n“cogent and compelling, thus strong in light of other\nexplanations” for the defendant’s actions).\n  Congress has not imposed such a demanding standard\nfor pleading in any other context — including civil rights\nand employment discrimination cases, which often turn\non whether a defendant’s explanation for a decision is\nlegitimate or merely a pretext covering for unlawful\nbias. Rule 9(b) and the Supreme Court decisions in\nSwierkiewicz and Leatherman permit plaintiffs to plead\nintent generally, meaning without the sort of specifics\nrequired under the PSLRA. But if the Iqbal pleading\nstandard is applied in the district court, plaintiffs who\nalready face the uphill battle of proving secret intent\n\f30                                              No. 09-3561\n\nmust now contend with the possibility of pre-discovery\ndismissal whenever the alleged pretext asserted by de-\nfendants in their motion to dismiss sounds plausible to\nthe common sense of the particular judge. The potential\nharm of Iqbal in this context is that outcomes will vary\nbased on how different judges view the plausibility\nof, for example, a police policymaker harboring and\nacting on improper motives toward women who com-\nplain of domestic violence.\n   As we struggle with these problems, it is important to\nrecall that the Iqbal Court disclaimed such a probabilistic\nbalancing, absent access to evidence, to determine which\ntheory of the case seems more likely true. See 129 S. Ct. at\n1949 (“The plausibility standard is not akin to a ‘prob-\nability requirement’ . . . .”). Although the Iqbal opinion\nused phrases such as “more likely,” and “as between,”\nit should not be read to say that a plaintiff should lose\non the pleadings because a defendant had a more\nplausible alternative explanation. Rather, in light of the\nalternative explanation, plaintiff needed to “allege more\nby way of factual content to ‘nudg[e]’ his claim of pur-\nposeful discrimination ‘across the line from conceivable\nto plausible.’ ” 129 S. Ct. at 1952 (quoting Twombly, 550\nU.S. at 570). A plausible claim can seem less plausible\nor probable than the obvious alternative and still survive\ndismissal. Whether this distinction involves a real dif-\nference will depend on the care judges take not to ratify\npotential false pretexts as “obvious” when making\ntheir common-sense plausibility determinations on bare\npleadings.\n\fNo. 09-3561                                                   31\n\n  For example, in this case, the majority relies on Brooks,\nin which we followed the reasoning in Twombly and said\nthat the recited behavior was “just as consistent with\nlawful conduct as it is with wrongdoing.” Brooks v. Ross,\n578 F.3d 574, 581 (7th Cir. 2009). But this does not mean\nthat we upheld the dismissal because a tie goes to the\ndefendant. On its face, Iqbal leaves undisturbed the\nfactual presumption in favor of plaintiff on a motion to\ndismiss. Id. Rather, the claims were dismissed because,\nabsent more factual content, “Brooks’s allegations are\ntoo vague to provide notice to defendants of the con-\ntours of his . . . claim.” Id. at 581-82. The primary pur-\npose of notice pleading under Rule 8 is notice.\nImplausible pleadings do harm primarily by failing to\nground themselves sufficiently in reality such that defen-\ndants can know what is claimed. 1 Similarly, in Swanson\nv. Citibank, N.A., 614 F.3d 400 (7th Cir. 2010), we\n\n\n1\n   Some commentators have noted a concern, underlying\nTwombly and Iqbal, with limiting defendants’ supposed\nburden of complying with discovery. See Miller, 60 Duke L. J. at\n53-59; Bone, 85 Notre Dame L. R. at 859. Others answer with\ncompeting concerns about providing plaintiffs with access to\ncourts in order to discover the actual but often hidden explana-\ntion for defendants’ harmful conduct. Given proper notice of the\nsort of claim being asserted, the Federal Rules of Civil Pro-\ncedure give courts and parties powerful tools to confine the\nscope of discovery to relevant issues. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b).\nI respectfully suggest that effective use of those tools is\nmuch more likely to control costs of litigation than the subjec-\ntive and uncertain pleading standard of Iqbal, which has\nbeen multiplying litigation of pleading disputes.\n\f32                                              No. 09-3561\n\nreversed dismissal of a complaint that only alleged\nracial discrimination generally, mentioning just the per-\npetrator and time-frame. These allegations were enough\nto “give the opposing party notice of what the case is\nall about.” Id. at 405.\n  The difference in result between Brooks and Swanson\ndid not depend, in my view, on the existence of an\nobvious alternative explanation, which was present in\nboth cases. See id. at 411 (Posner, J., dissenting in part).\nNor is the Monell claim raised by McCauley here sub-\nstantially more complicated than the discrimination\nalleged in Swanson. Rather, whether each of these com-\nplaints survives a Rule 12(b)(6) motion depends on a\nhighly subjective plausibility determination. That deter-\nmination must be made with great care, guided by an\nawareness of the core notice purpose behind Rule 8, as\nwell as knowledge of the consequence of dismissing\nseemingly improbable, yet potentially meritorious, dis-\ncrimination claims at such an early stage.\n  A simple thought experiment underscores the dan-\ngerous potential over-breadth of the Iqbal mode\nof parsing complaints — of first applying too aggres-\nsively the fact/conclusion dichotomy to a complaint,\nand then applying the “obvious alternative explana-\ntion” analysis to the facts that remain.\n  Imagine that as a federal district judge, you have read\nTwombly and Iqbal and now must act on a motion to\ndismiss an equal protection complaint in which the\nkey paragraph reads:\n\fNo. 09-3561                                               33\n\n    The educational opportunities provided by de-\n    fendants for infant plaintiffs in the separate all-Negro\n    schools are inferior to those provided for white\n    school children similarly situated in violation of the\n    equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment\n    to the Constitution of the United States. The respects\n    in which these opportunities are inferior include\n    the physical facilities, curricula, teaching, resources,\n    student personnel services, access and all other ed-\n    ucational factors, tangible and intangible, offered to\n    school children in Topeka. Apart from all other\n    factors, the racial segregation herein practiced in\n    and of itself constitutes an inferiority in educational\n    opportunity offered to Negroes, when compared\n    to educational opportunity offered to whites.\nUnder the Iqbal approach, the first sentence merely\nrecites a legal conclusion regarding the elements of an\nequal protection cause of action and thus should be\nexcluded from the Iqbal analysis. The third sentence is\nsimilarly a bare conclusion that should also be ignored.\nOnly the middle sentence contains what might amount\nto facts under Iqbal. A closer analysis, however, reveals\nan arguably fatal lack of explanation regarding how the\nlisted items are inferior. The thrust of the sentence is a\nbare conclusion that all factors, tangible and intangible,\ncontribute to the claimed deprivation. Does this complaint\nprovide the specific factual content required by Iqbal?\n  Even if the alleged “respects in which these oppor-\ntunities are inferior” might properly be called allega-\ntions of fact, it would be difficult for a claim of invidious\n\f34                                                No. 09-3561\n\ndiscrimination to seem plausible in light of the obvious\nalternative explanations for these deficiencies. School\nboards possess limited resources. Perhaps they simply\nallocated those resources according to neutral factors.\nDisparity in outcome is just as consistent with the\nnatural effects of lower socio-economic status as it\nis with pernicious effects of racial segregation. Or so\nthe post-Iqbal argument might go.\n  The paragraph quoted above is, of course, taken\ndirectly from plaintiffs’ amended complaint in Brown v.\nBoard of Education, filed on May 29, 1951. Amendment\nto Paragraph Eight of the Amended Complaint, Brown\nv. Board of Education, 98 F. Supp. 797 (D. Kan. 1951),\navailable at http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=\n5479 (last visited Oct. 17, 2011). We also know that\nthe conclusory allegation of the third sentence\neventually appeared as the holding of the unanimous\nSupreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education,\n347 U.S. 483, 495 (1954) (“Separate educational facilities\nare inherently unequal.”). Under the standards of\nIqbal, however, it would be easy to argue that the\nplaintiffs in Brown failed to state a plausible claim\nfor relief that could survive dismissal. The Court’s shift\nto “plausibility” pleading, and the assignment of inter-\npretation of that standard to the subjective common-sense\nof individual judges, has markedly increased the danger\nof throwing out the proverbial baby with the bathwater.2\n\n\n\n2\n  See also Miller, 60 Duke L. J. at 127-30 (applying a similar\nhypothetical analysis to the complaint in the seminal notice\n                                                 (continued...)\n\fNo. 09-3561                                               35\n\n  In the face of all these problems, what are the lower\nfederal courts to do? These are all sources of controlling\nlaw that we are obliged to follow. Although careful analy-\nsis may help the lower federal courts determine, for\nexample, that the Iqbal pleading standard would not\nrequire a different result in particular cases, there will\nbe cases, and Mr. McCauley’s equal protection claim\nappears to be one of them, where the standard makes\na decisive difference.\n  The first thing we can do is recognize the uncertainty\nthat litigants, their lawyers, and district courts now\nface. As a result of that uncertainty, the courts of\nappeals should insist that in all but the most unusual\nsituations, a party whose pleading is dismissed based\non the Iqbal plausibility standard should be entitled to an\nopportunity to amend the pleading after the court has\nmade its decision. Allowing amendment after pleadings\ndismissals had long been our practice even before\nTwombly and Iqbal. See, e.g., Barry Aviation Inc. v. Land O’\nLakes Municipal Airport Comm’n, 377 F. 3d 682, 687 (7th\nCir. 2004) (quoting 5A Charles Allen Wright & Arthur R.\nMiller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1357 (2d ed. 1990)).\nWhether one favors broader or narrower readings of\nTwombly and Iqbal, no one denies that the cases are being\ninterpreted as having caused an upheaval in long-settled\nlaw. Attorneys and parties trying to draft complaints\n\n\n\n2\n  (...continued)\npleading case of Dioguardi v. Durning, 139 F.2d 774 (2d Cir.\n1944)).\n\f36                                              No. 09-3561\n\nand other pleadings will be left wondering about many\nimportant questions and contradictions that the Court\nhas not yet addressed. Rule 1 instructs us to construe\nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to secure the just,\nspeedy, and inexpensive determination of cases. The\nSupreme Court has often reminded us that pleading\nrules should be applied to facilitate a proper decision\non the merits rather than to impose a series of traps in\nwhich one mis-step can be decisive. E.g., Swierkiewicz,\n534 U.S. at 514 (“The liberal notice pleading of Rule 8(a)\nis the starting point of a simplified pleading system,\nwhich was adopted to focus litigation on the merits of\na claim.”), quoted in Christensen v. County of Boone, 483\nF.3d 454, 458-59 (7th Cir. 2007), and in Brooks, 578 F.3d at\n580. We should exercise caution to avoid punishing\nparties for imperfect predictions as to how the subjec-\ntive and inconsistent Iqbal standard might be applied\nin their case.\n  Some statistics show that generosity with regard to\nleave to amend appears to have increased under the\nnew pleading regime, even as the total percentage of\ndismissal motions granted has risen. See Hatamyar, 59\nAm. U. L. Rev. at 600 (analyzing statistics and finding\na “noticeable increase in dismissals with leave to amend\nunder Twombly and Iqbal”). District judges should\ncontinue to grant such leave when they are concerned\nwith the effects on plaintiffs that I have discussed above.\nThey should also grant leave when doing so could\nprevent results in otherwise similar cases from\ndiverging based merely on differences in plausibility\n\fNo. 09-3561                                                 37\n\ndeterminations made by different judges according to\ntheir individual judicial experience and common sense.\n  Courts must freely give leave to amend under\nRule 15(a) where interests of justice so require. Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 15(a); Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 181-82 (1962).\nUnder this liberal rule, we allow amendment on remand\nin many procedural dismissal cases, and certainly do so\nwhen relevant decisional law changed after the com-\nplaint was filed. See, e.g., Ienco v. City of Chicago, 286 F.3d\n994, 999 (7th Cir. 2002). When, as here, the changed deci-\nsional law involves the standard for pleading itself,\ninterests of justice call for an opportunity to amend essen-\ntially as a matter of course unless it is clear that the op-\nportunity would be futile. In Iqbal itself, the Supreme\nCourt remanded to the Second Circuit for a determina-\ntion whether to further remand — so that plaintiffs could\nseek leave to amend. 129 S. Ct. at 1954; see also Iqbal v.\nAshcroft, 574 F.3d 820, 822 (2d Cir. 2009) (remanding to\ndistrict court for determination regarding leave to\namend). We have continued to permit such amendment\nafter Twombly and Iqbal. See, e.g., Bausch v. Stryker Corp.,\n630 F.3d 546, 562 (7th Cir. 2010). We should do so here.\n  But where that approach is not enough to resolve\nthe case, I believe we must take care not to expand\nIqbal too aggressively beyond its highly unusual con-\ntext — allegations aimed at the nation’s highest-ranking\nlaw enforcement officials based on their response to\nunprecedented terrorist attacks on the United States\nhomeland — to cut off potentially viable claims. Iqbal\nexemplifies the old adage about hard cases. The failure\n\f38                                              No. 09-3561\n\nof the Supreme Court to address all of the law that would\nconflict with broad application of the case should weigh\nheavily against that broad application, at least until the\nSupreme Court provides clearer guidance about how to\nreconcile Iqbal with its prior cases, the Federal Rules of\nCivil Procedure, and their accompanying forms.\n  Reading the present complaint as a whole, plaintiff\nMcCauley has alleged the particulars of a plausible\nMonell claim. As the majority points out, McCauley has\nalleged the elements of such a claim using the relevant\nlegal language. While some of these statements are\nconclusory in nature, they serve to notify defendants\nand the court of the type of claim being brought. There\ncan be no doubt that the complaint provides suf-\nficient notice of the circumstances that gave rise to the\nclaims. McCauley made factual allegations that Chicago\npolice failed to arrest Martinez despite knowledge of\nhis harassment and violations, ¶ 25, and that this\nfailure resulted from a custom of untimeliness and indif-\nference with regard to the seriousness of domestic\nviolence, ¶ 125(c) and (j). McCauley alleges “deliberate\nindifference” generally, see ¶ 126, but elsewhere de-\nscribes numerous specific failures to act that are factu-\nally consistent with such an intent. See, e.g., ¶ 51. It\nis difficult to imagine what more McCauley might\nallege on the crucial question of intent without reciting\na list of specific states of mind that Chicago police policy-\nmakers might have. We did not require such a recital\nin Swanson and we should not do so here.\n  By extending Iqbal to dismiss plaintiff McCauley’s\nequal protection Monell claim against the City of Chicago,\n\fNo. 09-3561                                              39\n\nthe majority runs afoul of Leatherman, Rule 9(b), and the\nform complaints approved by the Supreme Court and\nCongress as part of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\nPerhaps the Supreme Court majority intended Iqbal to\nwork such a revolution in federal civil practice, but if so,\nthe Court failed to grapple with the conflicts and did not\nexpress any direct rejection of these other governing\nsources of law. Under these circumstances, therefore,\nI would reverse the dismissal of plaintiff’s equal protec-\ntion claim against the City of Chicago and give him\nan opportunity to pursue discovery. Even if I agreed\nthat the current version of the complaint failed to state\na claim, I would remand with instructions to give\nplaintiff an opportunity to file an amended complaint\nto try to comply with the new and uncertain standards\nof Iqbal.\n\n\n\n\n                          10-20-11\n\f",

Mersaides McCauley was shot\nand killed by her ex-boyfriend Glenford Martinez as she\nleft the parking lot of her church in Chicago. Martinez\nthen turned the gun on himself. At the time of the murder-\nsuicide, Martinez was on parole for an earlier homicide\nand had a history of harassing and assaulting McCauley\n\f2                                               No. 09-3561\n\nin violation of his parole and a court order of protection\nissued on her behalf. Chicago law-enforcement and\nIllinois corrections officials were aware of these viola-\ntions and could have ensured that Martinez was\ndetained without bail, but they neither issued a parole-\nviolation warrant nor arrested him for violating the\norder of protection.\n  After Mersaides’s death, her father, Brewster McCauley,\nas administrator of her estate, filed suit in state court\nagainst the City of Chicago and several of its officials,\nthe Illinois Department of Corrections (“IDOC”) and its\ndirector, and Martinez’s estate. The complaint alleged\n13 separate federal and state claims for relief; those rele-\nvant here are equal-protection claims against the City\nof Chicago and the IDOC director.\n  The city and state defendants removed the case to\nfederal court and promptly moved to dismiss. The\ndistrict court granted the motion. The court held that\nfemale victims of domestic violence are not a “suspect”\nor “protected” class for purposes of equal-protection\nanalysis, so McCauley’s equal-protection claim against\nthe City failed as a matter of law. The court also held\nthat McCauley’s claim against the IDOC director was\nbarred by the Eleventh Amendment because the claim\nsought damages from the director in his official capacity.\nMcCauley asked for leave to conduct limited discovery\nin the hope of finding a basis for a personal-capacity equal-\nprotection claim against the IDOC director. The dis-\ntrict court denied this request. McCauley appealed.\n  We affirm, although on different grounds. The com-\nplaint does not plausibly state a policy-or-practice equal-\n\fNo. 09-3561                                               3\n\nprotection claim against the City. It contains only general-\nized allegations that the City failed to have specific\npolicies in effect to protect victims of domestic violence\nfrom harm inflicted by those who violate their parole\nor court orders of protection by committing acts of domes-\ntic violence. The complaint alleges, in essence, that the\nCity failed to single out domestic-violence victims as a\nclass for special protection, not that the City denied this\nclass of victims equal protection.\n  McCauley does not contest the dismissal of his equal-\nprotection claim against the IDOC director in his official\ncapacity, but he does seek review of the court’s denial of\nhis request for limited discovery for the purpose of\nfinding a basis for a personal-capacity claim. At oral\nargument, however, McCauley’s counsel admitted he\nhad no reason to believe the IDOC director had any\npersonal involvement in supervising Martinez’s parole,\nlet alone any of the events leading to Mersaides’s\ndeath. Accordingly, the district court properly denied\nthe request for Rule 12(b)(6) discovery.\n\n\n                      I. Background\n   In 1993 Martinez was convicted of murder and\nattempted murder and sentenced to 28 years in prison.\nHe was released in 2006 and placed on mandatory super-\nvised release for three years. In November 2007 Martinez\nwas arrested and charged with domestic battery for\nallegedly choking Mersaides McCauley, his former girl-\nfriend, until she lost consciousness. Two days later an\nIllinois state court entered an emergency order of pro-\n\f4                                              No. 09-3561\n\ntection against Martinez on behalf of Mersaides. Later\nthat month the court issued a plenary order of protec-\ntion. Both orders prohibited Martinez from having any\ncontact with Mersaides.\n  On two separate occasions, the Cook County State’s\nAttorney’s Office informed Martinez’s parole officer at\nIDOC of the battery charge and arrest. The arrest was a\nparole violation and subjected Martinez to immediate\ndetention without bail until his trial on the domestic-\nbattery charge. Despite having received this informa-\ntion, no one at IDOC ever issued a parole-violation\nwarrant against Martinez. After his release on bail, Marti-\nnez continued to contact Mersaides, repeatedly violating\nthe orders of protection. The complaint alleges that Chi-\ncago police were aware of these violations but never\narrested Martinez.\n  That Martinez remained a free man ended tragically\nfor Mersaides. As she was leaving a church service on\nthe evening of April 6, 2008, Martinez blocked her\nvehicle with his own, trapping her in the church\nparking lot. He shot her multiple times, and she died of\nthe gunshot wounds 30 minutes later. After leaving\nthe scene, Martinez turned the gun on himself and com-\nmitted suicide.\n  Mersaides’s father, Brewster McCauley, filed this suit\nas special administrator of his daughter’s estate. The\ncomplaint alleged 13 federal and state claims (primarily\nfor deprivation of due process and equal protection, and\nfor wrongful death) against the City of Chicago and\nunidentified Chicago police officers, IDOC, various IDOC\n\fNo. 09-3561                                              5\n\nofficials, then-IDOC Director Roger Walker, and Martinez’s\nestate. The city and state defendants removed the case to\nfederal court and moved to dismiss pursuant to Rule\n12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The\ndistrict court granted the motion, dismissed the federal\nclaims, and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdic-\ntion over the state-law claims. See 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3);\nHansen v. Bd. of Trs. of Hamilton Se. Sch. Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1457088\"><a href=\"/opinion/1457088/hansen-v-board-of-trustees-of-hamilton/\"><span class=\"volume\">551</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">599</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 607 (7th Cir. 2008).\n  Only the equal-protection claims against the City and\nWalker are at issue on appeal. The claim against the City\nwas a policy-or-practice claim under Monell v. Depart-\nment of Social Services, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109881\"><a href=\"/opinion/109881/monell-v-new-york-city-dept-of-social-servs/\"><span class=\"volume\">436</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">658</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 694 (1978). The com-\nplaint variously alleges that the City failed to have ade-\nquate policies in place for the protection of female\nvictims of domestic violence. The court began its analysis\nof this claim by rejecting McCauley’s contention that\nfemale victims of domestic violence are a “suspect class”\nfor equal-protection purposes. The judge opted for\nrational-basis review and then concluded that to avoid\ndismissal, McCauley needed to show that Mersaides\nwas a member of a protected class. Noting that “protected\nclass” and “suspect class” mean the same thing in equal-\nprotection doctrine, the judge held that McCauley\ncould not establish a necessary prerequisite for a claim\nunder the Equal Protection Clause; that is, because\nMersaides did not belong to a suspect class, she did not\nbelong to a protected class either. That meant, the court\nheld, that McCauley could not satisfy the first require-\nment of a prima facie case of discrimination under the\nEqual Protection Clause. Finally, the court held that the\n\f6                                                No. 09-3561\n\ncomplaint failed to state a “class of one” equal-protection\nclaim against the City.\n  As for the claim against IDOC Director Walker, the\ndistrict court held that the Eleventh Amendment’s\nsovereign-immunity protections barred McCauley from\nrecovering damages against him in his official capacity.\nSee Bd. of Trs. of Univ. of Ala. v.

McCauley asked the\ncourt for a limited opportunity to conduct discovery in\nan effort to find a factual basis for a personal-capacity\nclaim against Walker.

Because\nMcCauley’s equal-protection claim against the City\nfailed as a matter of law, the court thought any similar\nclaim against Walker in his personal capacity would fail\nas well.\n\n\n                      II.

The court began by\nholding that strict scrutiny did not apply because\nfemale victims of domestic violence are not a “suspect\nclass” for purposes of equal-protection analysis. The\ncourt then opted for rational-basis review, bypassing\nany form of intermediate scrutiny. The judge then took\na detour into the caselaw that applies to claims of dis-\ncrimination in public employment under the Equal Pro-\ntection Clause, citing Brown v. Budz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"789313\"><a href=\"/opinion/789313/david-brown-v-timothy-budz/\"><span class=\"volume\">398</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">904</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 916\n(7th Cir. 2005), and Salas v.

Using this framework,\nthe court held that because female domestic-violence\nvictims are not a protected class, McCauley could not\nestablish the first requirement of a prima facie case of\ndiscrimination. Finally, the court held that because the\nequal-protection claim was premised on Mersaides’s\ngroup affiliation as a victim of domestic violence, the\ncomplaint did not state a claim for a “class of one” equal-\nprotection violation.

For\nstarters, analyzing the equal-protection claim under class-\nof-one doctrine was error. This is not a class-of-one\ncase; McCauley has never contended that it is. Nor\nis the burden-shifting prima facie case methodology\nappropriate here. That formula has been used in\nemployment-discrimination claims arising under the\nEqual Protection Clause or 42 U.S.C. § 1981 because equal-\nprotection claims alleging discrimination in public em-\nployment can be analogized to claims under Title VII.\nImporting the prima facie case requirements from Title\nVII doctrine makes sense in the public-employment\ncontext, but that approach does not apply more\nbroadly to all equal-protection cases. Finally, whether\nfemale domestic-violence victims are properly con-\nsidered a “suspect” or “protected” class for equal-protec-\ntion analysis is a merits question. The answer deter-\nmines what level of judicial review applies to the defen-\ndant’s actions, see, e.g., Srail, 588 F.3d at 943, a question\nnot normally appropriate for resolution at the\npleadings stage.1\n\n\n\n1\n  We note for completeness that McCauley makes alternative\narguments on this point. He first argues that female victims\nof domestic violence ought to be recognized as a suspect class\nfor equal-protection analysis, requiring strict scrutiny of the\nCity’s actions. He argues in the alternative that the claim\nshould be treated as more generally alleging discrimination\non the basis of gender, which calls for the application of inter-\nmediate scrutiny. See United States v. Virginia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118056\"><a href=\"/opinion/118056/united-states-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">515</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n531 (1996).\n\fNo. 09-3561                                                  9\n\n  Though the district court’s analysis was faulty, the\nequal-protection claim against the City was properly\ndismissed. To state a Monell claim against the City for\nviolation of Mersaides’s right to equal protection,\nMcCauley was required to “plead[] factual content that\nallows the court to draw the reasonable inference” that\nthe City maintained a policy, custom, or practice of in-\ntentional discrimination against a class of persons to\nwhich Mersaides belonged. See Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1949;\nMonell, 436 U.S. at 694; Srail, 588 F.3d at 943. He did not\nmeet this burden.\n  In reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint under the\nplausibility standard announced in Twombly and Iqbal, we\naccept the well-pleaded facts in the complaint as true,\nbut legal conclusions and conclusory allegations merely\nreciting the elements of the claim are not entitled to\nthis presumption of truth. Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1951. After\nexcising the allegations not entitled to the presumption,\nwe determine whether the remaining factual allega-\ntions “plausibly suggest an entitlement to relief.” Id. The\n“[f]actual allegations must be enough to raise a right\nto relief above the speculative level.” Twombly, 550 U.S.\nat 555. That is, the complaint must contain “allegations\nplausibly suggesting (not merely consistent with)” an\nentitlement to relief. Id. at 557. If the allegations give rise\nto an “obvious alternative explanation,” Iqbal, 129 S. Ct.\nat 1951; Twombly, 550 U.S. at 567, then the complaint\nmay “stop[] short of the line between possibility and\nplausibility of ‘entitle[ment] to relief,’ ” Twombly, 550 U.S.\nat 557. Making the plausibility determination is “a con-\ntext-specific task that requires the reviewing court to\n\f10                                              No. 09-3561\n\ndraw on its judicial experience and common sense.”\nIqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1950.\n  We have interpreted Twombly and Iqbal to require the\nplaintiff to “provid[e] some specific facts” to support\nthe legal claims asserted in the complaint. Brooks, 578\nF.3d at 581. The degree of specificity required is not\neasily quantified, but “the plaintiff must give enough\ndetails about the subject-matter of the case to present\na story that holds together.” Swanson v. Citibank, N.A., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"151889\"><a href=\"/opinion/151889/swanson-v-citibank-na/\"><span class=\"volume\">614</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">400</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 404 (7th Cir. 2010). The required level of\nfactual specificity rises with the complexity of the claim.\nId. at 405 (“A more complex case . . . will require more\ndetail, both to give the opposing party notice of what\nthe case is all about and to show how, in the plaintiff’s\nmind at least, the dots should be connected.”).\n  Brooks and Swanson help illustrate the factual heft\nrequired to survive a motion to dismiss after Twombly\nand Iqbal. In Brooks the plaintiff was prosecuted for\nofficial misconduct and wire fraud relating to his duties\nas a Prison Review Board member. 578 F.3d at 578. He\nwas acquitted on these charges and filed suit alleging\na vast conspiracy by fellow board members, a state\npolice officer, an IDOC employee, and the Illinois\nAttorney General based on their participation in or co-\noperation with the investigation against him. Id. The\ncomplaint alleged that the defendants “knowingly, inten-\ntionally[,] and maliciously prosecute[d]” him in retalia-\ntion for his exercise of constitutionally protected rights.\nId. at 582. We held that this was “nothing more” than a\n“formulaic recitation of the cause of action,” insufficient\n\fNo. 09-3561                                               11\n\nto state a claim under Twombly and Iqbal. Id. The\nremaining allegations—primarily explaining each defen-\ndant’s role in the investigation—were just as consistent\nwith a lawful investigation as an illegal conspiracy to\nretaliate against Brooks. Id. at 581 (“The behavior Brooks\nhas alleged that the defendants engaged in is just as\nconsistent with lawful conduct as it is with wrongdoing.”).\nAccordingly, we affirmed the dismissal of the com-\nplaint. Id. at 582.\n   In Swanson, on the other hand, we applied Twombly/\nIqbal and held that the plaintiff’s allegations were suf-\nficient to survive a motion to dismiss on at least some\nof her claims. Swanson, an African-American loan appli-\ncant who was turned down for a loan, claimed that that\nthe denial was based on her race in violation of the\nFair Housing Act (among other causes of action). 614 F.3d\nat 402-03. Her complaint alleged that the defendants\nintentionally undervalued her home and that they did\nso because of her race. Id. at 403. She alleged that a third-\nparty appraiser had valued the home at $240,000, much\nhigher than the defendant’s valuation of $170,000. Id.\nWe held that because Swanson’s claim of housing dis-\ncrimination was uncomplicated, Swanson’s pleading\nburden under Twombly and Iqbal was satisfied. Id. at 404.\nHer complaint contained factual allegations identifying\n(1) who discriminated against her; (2) the type of dis-\ncrimination that occurred; and (3) when the discrimina-\ntion took place. Id. at 405. We held that given the straight-\nforward nature of the claim, Twombly/Iqbal required\nnothing more. Id. (citing Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A.,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118482\"><a href=\"/opinion/118482/swierkiewicz-v-sorema-na/\"><span class=\"volume\">534</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">506</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 511-12 (2002)).\n\f12                                              No. 09-3561\n\n  This case is more like Brooks than Swanson. Many of\nthe alleged “facts” are actually legal conclusions or ele-\nments of the cause of action, which may be disregarded\non a motion to dismiss. See Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1951. For\nexample, McCauley alleges that the City “has an\nunwritten custom, practice and policy to afford lesser\nprotection or none at all to victims of domestic violence”\nand that “[t]here is no rational basis” for this purported\npolicy. Similarly, McCauley alleged the following:\n     [The City], through its agents, employees and/or\n     servants, acting under color of law, at the level of\n     official policy, practice, and custom, with deliberate,\n     callous, and conscious indifference to McCauley’s\n     constitutional rights, authorized, tolerated, and in-\n     stitutionalized the practices and ratified the illegal\n     conduct herein detailed, and at all times material to\n     this Complaint, [the City] had interrelated de facto\n     policies, practices, and customs.\nThese are the legal elements of the various claims\nMcCauley has asserted; they are not factual allegations\nand as such contribute nothing to the plausibility\nanalysis under Twombly/Iqbal.\n  Once the legal conclusions are disregarded, just one\nparagraph of factual allegations remains:\n     Defendant violated McCauley’s constitutional rights\n     under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 by:\n        a.   failing to provide adequate security and\n             promptly arrest Martinez;\n\fNo. 09-3561                                                13\n\n       b.     failing to promulgate any policy to ensure\n              the prompt arrest of individuals guilty of\n              violating protective orders;\n       c.     maintaining a policy or custom of failing\n              to timely arrest violators of protective orders;\n       d. maintaining a custom and practice of failing\n          to adequately train officers concerning the\n          necessity of promptly arresting individuals\n          guilty of violating protective orders;\n       e.     maintaining a policy or custom of failing to\n              have safeguards in place to ensure that viola-\n              tors of protective orders were timely arrested;\n       f.     failing to have a custom, practice and policy\n              in effect to verify whether someone who is\n              arrested for domestic violence is on parole;\n       g. failing to have a custom, practice and policy\n          to communicate with state officials and law\n          enforcement officials regarding domestic\n          violence arrests;\n       h. failing to have a custom, practice and policy\n          in effect in order to communicate with\n          parole agents on domestic violence arrests;\n       i.     failing to have a custom, practice and policy\n              in effect to verify whether an arrestee of a\n              domestic violence offense is on parole prior\n              to issuing an order of protection; and\n       j.     maintaining a custom, practice and policy of\n              ignoring the seriousness of domestic violence\n              arrests.\n\f14                                               No. 09-3561\n\n   McCauley maintains that these allegations are suf-\nficient to state a Monell equal-protection claim against\nthe City. We disagree. In order to state a facially\nplausible equal-protection claim under Monell, the\nfactual allegations in McCauley’s complaint must allow\nus to draw the reasonable inference that the City estab-\nlished a policy or practice of intentionally discriminating\nagainst female victims of domestic violence in the provi-\nsion of police protection. That is, McCauley needed to\nallege enough “by way of factual content to ‘nudg[e]’ his\nclaim of purposeful discrimination ‘across the line\nfrom conceivable to plausible.’ ” Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1952\n(quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570)).\n   Because the Equal Protection Clause is “concerned . . .\nwith equal treatment rather than with establishing\nentitlements to some minimum of government services,\n[it] does not entitle a person to adequate, or indeed to\nany, police protection.” Hilton v. City of Wheeling, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768390\"><a href=\"/opinion/768390/eyrle-s-hilton-iv-v-city-of-wheeling/\"><span class=\"volume\">209</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1005</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1007 (7th Cir. 2000); see also DeShaney v.\nWinnebago Cnty.

The allega-\ntions in the paragraph quoted above do not plausibly\nsuggest that the City maintained a policy or practice of\nselective withdrawal of police protection. To the contrary,\nthe complaint alleges that the City failed to have par-\n\fNo. 09-3561                                               15\n\nticularized practices in place for the special protection of\ndomestic-violence victims. In essence, the complaint\nalleges that the City failed to promulgate specific\npolicies for this particular class of crime victims, not that\nthe City denied this class of victims equal protection. At\nmost, the factual allegations in the complaint plausibly\nsuggest the uneven allocation of limited police-protection\nservices; they do not plausibly suggest that the City\nmaintained an intentional policy or practice of omitting\npolice protection from female domestic-violence victims\nas a class.\n  Just as in Brooks, McCauley’s factual allegations are\nentirely consistent with lawful conduct—here a lawful\nallocation of limited police resources. 578 F.3d at 581. And\nthe complexity of McCauley’s equal-protection claim\ndistinguishes this case from Swanson. The housing-dis-\ncrimination claim at issue in Swanson was quite straight-\nforward. Putting the defendants on notice of what it\nentailed was simple, so Swanson did not need to plead\nmuch by way of factual content in her complaint. There,\nin the absence of an obvious legal alternative explana-\ntion, pleading the “who, what, and when” of the dis-\ncrimination claim was enough. See Swanson, 614 F.3d at\n405. Here, McCauley’s equal-protection claim is more\ncomplicated and counterintuitive. Yet he has alleged\nonly that the City failed to have particularized safe-\nguards in place for the special protection of domestic-\nviolence victims. For the reasons we have explained, this\ndoes not state a Monell equal-protection claim against\nthe City. This claim was properly dismissed.\n\f16                                                 No. 09-3561\n\nB. Predismissal Discovery Against Walker\n  McCauley does not challenge the district court’s order\ndismissing the official-capacity equal-protection claim\nagainst Walker on Eleventh Amendment grounds. In-\nstead, he argues that the court should have allowed him\nto conduct limited discovery regarding Walker’s per-\nsonal involvement in the events leading to Mersaides’s\nmurder on the chance he might unearth a basis for a\nclaim against Walker in his individual capacity. We\nreview the denial of McCauley’s discovery request for\nabuse of discretion. Griffin v. Foley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1437740\"><a href=\"/opinion/1437740/griffin-v-foley/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">209</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 223\n(7th Cir. 2008).\n   The district court’s refusal to authorize Rule 12(b)(6)\ndiscovery was based largely on the court’s view that any\npersonal-capacity claim against Walker would suffer\nfrom the same deficiencies as the Monell claim against\nthe City; namely, that Mersaides was not a member of a\n“suspect” or “protected” class for equal-protection pur-\nposes. For the reasons we have explained, this analysis\nis flawed. We nonetheless affirm on other grounds.\n  To determine whether pre-Rule 12(b)(6) discovery\nshould have been available in this case, we need not\ndecide the broader and more provocative question\nwhether it should be available in general, in light of the\nTwombly/Iqbal pleading regime.2 This is not a proper case\n\n\n2\n  Proposals for some form of “Rule 12(b)(6) discovery” have\nproliferated in academic circles in the wake of Twombly and\nIqbal. See, e.g., Arthur R. Miller, From Conley to Twombly to\n                                                  (continued...)\n\fNo. 09-3561                                                      17\n\nfor Rule 12(b)(6) discovery in any event. McCauley’s\ncounsel conceded at oral argument that he “has nothing”\nto suggest that Walker was personally involved in any of\nthe events leading to Mersaides’s death. Indeed, based on\nthe complaint, there is no reason at all to think the IDOC\ndirector had any personal role in Martinez’s parole super-\nvision, much less the specific events preceding Mersaides’s\ndeath. Accordingly, the denial of McCauley’s request\nfor Rule 12(b)(6) discovery was not an abuse of discretion.\n                                                       A FFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n2\n   (...continued)\nIqbal: A Double Play on the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 60\nD UKE L.

See Miller, supra, at 105 (“Since the\ncombined effect of Twombly, Iqbal, and the summary judgment\ntrilogy is to require a plaintiff to have greater knowledge\nconcerning his claim either before instituting an action or\nimmediately thereafter, inequality of information access\nduring those critical time frames poses a significant—if not\nthe most significant—problem for many people seeking af-\nfirmative relief.”).\n\f18                                                  No. 09-3561\n\n  H AMILTON, Circuit Judge, dissenting in part. I agree\nwith my colleagues that plaintiff has failed to state a\nclaim against defendant Walker. I respectfully dissent\nfrom the rejection of plaintiff’s equal protection claim\nagainst the City of Chicago. I am skeptical about\nplaintiff’s ability to prove the claim, but his complaint\nshould be sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss for\nfailure to state a claim, even under the new and\nsubjective pleading standards announced in Ashcroft v.\nIqbal, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145875\"><a href=\"/opinion/145875/ashcroft-v-iqbal/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

I explain first my skepticism,\nthen some of the problems raised by Iqbal, and finally\nwhy the complaint should survive the motion to dismiss.\n   Mr. McCauley’s suit seeks to enforce the Fourteenth\nAmendment’s equal protection requirements on the\ndecisions of a major city police force about how to\nallocate its resources. Plaintiff’s only viable equal pro-\ntection theory is that the Chicago police department\nmade a deliberate decision to minimize the police pro-\ntection available to victims of domestic violence, and\nthat the police did so because of an intentional animus\nagainst women, who make up the vast majority of adult\nvictims of domestic violence. See Bureau of Justice Statis-\ntics, U.S. Dept. of Justice, Family Violence Statistics 11 (2005),\navailable at http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/fvs.\npdf (last visited Oct. 17, 2011) (finding that women\nwere 84% of spouse abuse victims and 86% of victims\nof abuse at the hands of a boyfriend or girlfriend).\n  As I said, I am skeptical about the plaintiff’s ability to\nprove such a claim.

This approach avoids difficult questions that are\nall but unanswerable by courts in practice. To begin\nwith, how should the police allocate their resources? And\nhow should a federal court measure equality in the al-\nlocation of those resources? Should we focus on patrol\nofficers on the beat per square mile? Per capita? Based on\nneighborhood crime rates? How should we gauge the\nseriousness of different crimes? Surely armed robberies\ndeserve more attention than acts of vandalism, and\nattacks on vulnerable persons probably deserve more\nattention than bar fights.\n  A few moments of reflection could generate a list of\nmany more variables and factors that a sensible citizen\nwould want the police to consider in deciding how to\nallocate their resources for crime prevention. And no\nmatter how a police department decides to allocate its\nresources, it will be possible to identify categories of\ncrime victims who receive below-average attention from\nthe police. There is no way to ensure complete equality,\nand the infinite variations in the ways to measure\nequality require any court considering the question to\nact with great caution.\n  And yet the courthouse door must remain open to\nclaims that the police are systematically denying some\npeople the literal equal protection of the law. The history\nof the Reconstruction after the Civil War reminds us that\n\f20                                                No. 09-3561\n\nstate and local governments deliberately and systemati-\ncally denied equal protection of the laws to former\nslaves and their descendants. More recently, the\nJim Crow laws, internment of Japanese Americans, segre-\ngation, voting restrictions, gender discrimination, and\nharassment of Muslim Americans in the wake of the\nSeptember 11, 2001 terrorist attacks all remind us that\nconcerns about equal protection are not just matters of\nbygone history. A deliberate decision to withdraw or\nsubstantially reduce police protection to groups based\non race, national origin, gender, religion, or political\naffiliation should qualify for federal court attention\nand remedies.\n   We and other federal courts have often recognized\nthe legal viability of such claims, even if they are difficult\nto prove.

Iqbal. In Iqbal, plaintiffs alleged that\nthey had been mistreated by federal law enforcement\nofficials because of their religion and their national\norigin in the wake of the September 11, 2001 terrorist\nattacks on the United States. The appeal concerned the\nplaintiffs’ claims against the Attorney General of the\nUnited States and the Director of the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation. The Supreme Court recognized that the\nalleged actions of the federal law enforcement officials\ncould have been perfectly legal so long as they were\nbased on even-handed application of the law, but that\nmistreatment based deliberately on religion or national\norigin could violate the Constitution. 129 S. Ct. at 1952.\n  The Court held in Iqbal that the plaintiffs had failed\nto allege a plausible claim of religious or national origin\ndiscrimination against Attorney General Ashcroft\nand FBI Director Mueller. Although the plaintiffs had\nalleged discriminatory intent, the Court found that the\ncomplaint did not “contain any factual allegation suf-\n\f22                                              No. 09-3561\n\nficient to plausibly suggest petitioners’ discriminatory\nstate of mind.” Id. The Court wrote that determining\nwhether a claim is plausible would “be a context-specific\ntask that requires the reviewing court to draw on its\njudicial experience and common sense.” Id. at 1950. The\nmethod of analysis employed by the Court in Iqbal in-\nvolved first “identifying the allegations in the complaint\nthat are not entitled to the assumption of truth” because\nthey are merely a “formulaic recitation of the elements”\nof the claim and thus “conclusory.” Id. at 1951. The\nCourt then looked only to the portions of the com-\nplaint it deemed to be “factual allegations” to make\na subjective plausibility determination.\n   As a subordinate federal court, it is our responsibility\nto do our best to apply the law as stated in Iqbal. My\ncolleagues do so here, and the Iqbal standard is clearly\ndecisive for the panel majority. The problem here is that\nit also our responsibility to do our best to apply other\nSupreme Court decisions involving pleading standards,\nincluding Leatherman v.

Iqbal\nis in serious tension with these other decisions, rules,\nand forms, and the Court’s opinion fails to grapple with\nor resolve that tension. I do not believe it is an exaggera-\n\fNo. 09-3561                                                   23\n\ntion to say that these decisions, rules, and forms simply\nconflict with Iqbal.\n  As a result of this unresolved tension, since Iqbal was\ndecided, the lower federal court decisions seeking to\napply the new “plausibility” standard are wildly incon-\nsistent with each other, and with the conflicting decisions\nof the Supreme Court. Iqbal has also generated a small\nblizzard of articles by law professors and practitioners\ncritiquing the decision and analyzing its implications.\nOne of the most useful and persuasive of those is\nProfessor Arthur Miller’s article, From Conley to Twombly\nto Iqbal: A Double Play on the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,\n60 Duke L. J. 1 (2010). See also, e.g., Robert Bone, Plausibility\nPleading Revisited and Revised: A Comment on Ashcroft v.\nIqbal, 85 Notre Dame L. Rev. 849 (2010); Patricia W.\nHatamyar, The Tao of Pleading: Do Twombly and Iqbal\nMatter Empirically?, 59 Am. U. L. Rev. 553 (2010) (finding\nstatistically significant differences in the treatment of\nmotions to dismiss, particularly with regard to civil\nrights cases); Hon. Colleen McMahon, The Law of Unin-\ntended Consequences: Shockwaves in the Lower Courts after\nBell Atlantic v. Twombly, 41 Suffolk U. L. Rev. 851 (2008).\n  Without revisiting the entirety of this lengthy critique,\nI note below some of the key problems that Iqbal presents\nfor federal district and circuit judges, and the parties\nand attorneys who litigate cases before them:\n First, Iqbal’s reasoning and holding conflict with\nRule 9(b), which requires that a party alleging fraud or\nmistake “state with particularity the circumstances con-\n\f24                                              No. 09-3561\n\nstituting fraud or mistake.” As for other states of mind,\nhowever, the rule provides: “Malice, intent, knowledge,\nand other conditions of a person’s mind may be alleged\ngenerally.” In this context, “generally” means as a conclu-\nsion, without specifying underlying facts that would\nsupport the inference. For example, this provision has\nlong been understood not to require that discriminatory\nintent be alleged with particularity in employment dis-\ncrimination cases. See Swierkiewicz, 534 U.S. at 512 (unani-\nmously rejecting requirement that employment discrim-\nination complaint plead facts satisfying elements of\nprima facie case, because “imposing the Court of Ap-\npeals’ heightened pleading standard in employment\ndiscrimination cases conflicts with Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 8(a)(2)”).\n  Note that Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly endorsed the\ncontinued vitality of Swierkiewicz. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145730\"><a href=\"/opinion/145730/bell-atlantic-corp-v-twombly/\"><span class=\"volume\">550</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">544</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 569-70\n(2007); see also Miller, 60 Duke L. J. at 31. Iqbal also\nseemed to endorse the key Swierkiewicz holding re-\ngarding heightened pleading standards, noting that\nRule 9 “excuses a party from pleading discriminatory\nintent under an elevated pleading standard.” 129 S. Ct. at\n1954 (disclaiming a “rigid rule requiring the detailed\npleading of a condition of mind” as “undesirable”). But\nin the analysis that was actually decisive in the\ncase, however, the Iqbal Court held that under Rule 8\nthe complaint lacked “any factual allegation sufficient\nto plausibly suggest petitioners’ discriminatory state of\nmind.” Id. at 1952. Iqbal does not elaborate on the nature\nand number of specific facts that must be included in\nthe Rule 8 “short and plain statement of the claim” in\n\fNo. 09-3561                                              25\n\norder to achieve plausibility. The Court’s application\nof Rule 8 to impose a more demanding pleading\nstandard for discriminatory intent is not consistent with\nits stated adherence to Rule 9 and its express authoriza-\ntion of general pleading of discriminatory intent and\nmost other states of mind. The Court’s statement about\nRule 9(b) that “ ‘generally’ is a relative term” does not\nsolve the problem or give practical guidance to district\ncourts. See id. at 1954.\n  Second, Iqbal conflicts with other recent Supreme Court\ndecisions. Iqbal did not overrule or question a number\nof the Court’s prior cases on notice pleading. See\nLeatherman, 507 U.S. at 168 (unanimously rejecting height-\nened pleading standard for custom-or-policy claim\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983); Erickson, 551 U.S. at 90 (after\nTwombly, summarily reversing dismissal of pro se\nprisoner’s complaint for deliberate indifference to\nmedical needs where the court of appeals deemed the\ncomplaint too “conclusory” with respect to whether\ndefendant’s actions caused “substantial harm,” and\nfinding that: “The holding departs in so stark a manner\nfrom the pleading standard mandated by the Federal\nRules of Civil Procedure that we grant review.”). Many\ncases, citing Leatherman, reject heightened pleading stan-\ndards for the elements of a Monell custom or policy\nclaim such as the one alleged here. See, e.g., Jackson v.\nMarion County, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"704059\"><a href=\"/opinion/704059/howard-l-jackson-v-marion-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">151</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 153 (7th Cir. 1995) (“Leatherman\nmakes clear that the federal courts are not to interpolate\na requirement of fact pleading into the federal rules.”).\nAs noted, Iqbal also created tension with Swierkiewicz\nby endorsing its holding while simultaneously ap-\n\f26                                               No. 09-3561\n\npearing to require the same sort of fact-specific\npleading of discriminatory intent that the Swierkiewicz\nCourt rejected.\n  Third, Iqbal conflicts with the form complaints\napproved by the Supreme Court and Congress as part of\nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Rule 84 provides\nthat the forms in the appendix “suffice under these\nrules and illustrate the simplicity and brevity that\nthese rules contemplate.” Iqbal did not purport to over-\nrule or amend Rule 84 or the forms, but it is difficult\nto reconcile the new “plausibility” standard with those\nforms. Many of the approved forms require virtually\nno explanation of the underlying facts as long as the\ndefendant is informed of the event or transaction that\ngave rise to the claim, according to the broad notice\npurpose of the rules.\n   For example, Form 15 is a complaint for the conver-\nsion of property. It is sufficient for the plaintiff to allege\nthat on a stated date at a stated place, “the defendant\nconverted to the defendant’s own use property owned\nby the plaintiff,” and to identify the converted prop-\nerty and state its approximate value. Nothing more\nis needed — no factual details about the defendant’s\nactions, and no allegation concerning the defendant’s\nstate of mind. Under the plausibility standard of Iqbal,\nthis form complaint seems remarkably “conclusory,” yet\nit is sufficient according to Rule 84.\n  Similarly, Form 11 is a complaint for negligence. Apart\nfrom jurisdiction and damages, it is sufficient for the\ncomplaint to say only that on a stated date at a stated\n\fNo. 09-3561                                              27\n\nplace, defendant “negligently drove a motor vehicle\nagainst the plaintiff.” Again, nothing more is needed\nabout just what the defendant did or why those ac-\ntions amounted to negligence. This also seems quite\n“conclusory,” but it is sufficient under Rule 84. But cf.\nBranham v. Dolgencorp, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2604447</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *2\n(W.D. Va. Aug. 24, 2009) (applying Iqbal standard to\ndismiss slip-and-fall negligence complaint because it\nfailed to allege “facts that show how the liquid came to\nbe on the floor, whether the Defendant knew or should\nhave known of the presence of the liquid, or how the\nPlaintiff’s accident occurred”).\n  Even Form 21, which includes a claim to set aside a\nfraudulent conveyance, is remarkably terse. That portion\nof the form complaint says only that on a stated date, the\ndefendant conveyed all or a specified portion of defen-\ndant’s real and personal property to another defendant\n“for the purpose of defrauding the plaintiff and hind-\nering or delaying the collection of the debt.” Again,\nnothing more is needed about the circumstances of\nthe conveyance, and the “general” or “conclusory” allega-\ntion of a purpose to defraud is sufficient. One could go\non with parallel analysis of the other form complaints.\n  Unless one can plausibly explain away the tension\nbetween Iqbal and Rule 9(b) and the Rule 84-endorsed\nform complaints, then Iqbal conflicts with the Rules En-\nabling Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2071 et seq., and the prescribed\nprocess for amending the Federal Rules of Civil Proce-\ndure. See Swierkiewicz, 534 U.S. at 515, citing Leatherman,\n507 U.S. at 168; Hill v. McDonough, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145647\"><a href=\"/opinion/145647/hill-v-mcdonough/\"><span class=\"volume\">547</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">573</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 582 (2006)\n\f28                                                No. 09-3561\n\n(“Specific pleading requirements are mandated by the\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure, and not, as a general\nrule, through case-by-case determinations of the federal\ncourts.”).\n  Fourth, Iqbal’s reliance on the fact/conclusion dichot-\nomy is highly subjective, and returns courts to the long\ndisapproved methods of analysis under the regime of\ncode pleading. See Miller, 60 Duke L. J. at 23-24. Is an\nallegation that “defendant was negligent” or that “defen-\ndant acted with racially discriminatory intent” an allega-\ntion of fact or a conclusion? Calling these assertions\nelements of the claim is not logically sufficient to deter-\nmine when and if they should be denied a presumption of\ntruth. Even in Iqbal, the Court presumed true some as-\nsertions that could be characterized as conclusory, while\ndisapproving of others. See 129 S. Ct. at 1961 (Souter, J.,\ndissenting). Iqbal’s reliance on the fact/conclusion dichot-\nomy makes the difference indeterminate. Application\nof the dichotomy is leading to judge-specific and case-\nspecific differences in outcome that confuse everyone\ninvolved. The long legal history of code pleading, though\nperhaps distant enough in time to have been largely\nforgotten by most of todays’ lawyers and judges, pro-\nvides ample additional evidence on this point.\n  Fifth, Iqbal’s reliance on “judicial experience and\ncommon sense” invites the highly subjective and incon-\nsistent results that have been observed. The Iqbal con-\ncept of plausibility is “context-specific.” 129 S. Ct. at 1950.\nAs a practical matter, the concept invites district judges\nto exercise their individual views of the likely merits of\n\fNo. 09-3561                                               29\n\nthe case at the outset, when the only information\navailable is the complaint. Worse still, an uncritical\nreading of the Court’s “obvious alternative explanation”\nreasoning seems to invite judges to weigh competing\nexplanations for alleged conduct and dismiss cases merely\nbecause they believe one explanation over another. See 129\nS. Ct. at 1951 (referring to “more likely explanations”). In\napplication, this standard bears a striking resemblance to\nthe most stringent pleading requirement in American\ncivil law, for pleading scienter in securities fraud claims,\npursuant to the specific direction of Congress in the\nPrivate Securities Litigation Reform Act. See 15 U.S.C.\n§ 78u-4(b)(2) (requiring plaintiff to “state with par-\nticularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the\ndefendant acted with the required state of mind”); accord,\nTellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues and Rights, Ltd., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145709\"><a href=\"/opinion/145709/tellabs-inc-v-makor-issues-rights-ltd/\"><span class=\"volume\">551</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">308</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n323-24 (2007) (explaining that a “strong inference” must be\n“cogent and compelling, thus strong in light of other\nexplanations” for the defendant’s actions).\n  Congress has not imposed such a demanding standard\nfor pleading in any other context — including civil rights\nand employment discrimination cases, which often turn\non whether a defendant’s explanation for a decision is\nlegitimate or merely a pretext covering for unlawful\nbias. Rule 9(b) and the Supreme Court decisions in\nSwierkiewicz and Leatherman permit plaintiffs to plead\nintent generally, meaning without the sort of specifics\nrequired under the PSLRA. But if the Iqbal pleading\nstandard is applied in the district court, plaintiffs who\nalready face the uphill battle of proving secret intent\n\f30                                              No. 09-3561\n\nmust now contend with the possibility of pre-discovery\ndismissal whenever the alleged pretext asserted by de-\nfendants in their motion to dismiss sounds plausible to\nthe common sense of the particular judge. The potential\nharm of Iqbal in this context is that outcomes will vary\nbased on how different judges view the plausibility\nof, for example, a police policymaker harboring and\nacting on improper motives toward women who com-\nplain of domestic violence.\n   As we struggle with these problems, it is important to\nrecall that the Iqbal Court disclaimed such a probabilistic\nbalancing, absent access to evidence, to determine which\ntheory of the case seems more likely true. See 129 S. Ct. at\n1949 (“The plausibility standard is not akin to a ‘prob-\nability requirement’ . . . .”). Although the Iqbal opinion\nused phrases such as “more likely,” and “as between,”\nit should not be read to say that a plaintiff should lose\non the pleadings because a defendant had a more\nplausible alternative explanation. Rather, in light of the\nalternative explanation, plaintiff needed to “allege more\nby way of factual content to ‘nudg[e]’ his claim of pur-\nposeful discrimination ‘across the line from conceivable\nto plausible.’ ” 129 S. Ct. at 1952 (quoting Twombly, 550\nU.S. at 570). A plausible claim can seem less plausible\nor probable than the obvious alternative and still survive\ndismissal. Whether this distinction involves a real dif-\nference will depend on the care judges take not to ratify\npotential false pretexts as “obvious” when making\ntheir common-sense plausibility determinations on bare\npleadings.\n\fNo. 09-3561                                                   31\n\n  For example, in this case, the majority relies on Brooks,\nin which we followed the reasoning in Twombly and said\nthat the recited behavior was “just as consistent with\nlawful conduct as it is with wrongdoing.” Brooks v. Ross,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1456401\"><a href=\"/opinion/1456401/brooks-v-ross/\"><span class=\"volume\">578</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">574</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 581 (7th Cir. 2009). But this does not mean\nthat we upheld the dismissal because a tie goes to the\ndefendant. On its face, Iqbal leaves undisturbed the\nfactual presumption in favor of plaintiff on a motion to\ndismiss. Id. Rather, the claims were dismissed because,\nabsent more factual content, “Brooks’s allegations are\ntoo vague to provide notice to defendants of the con-\ntours of his . . . claim.” Id. at 581-82. The primary pur-\npose of notice pleading under Rule 8 is notice.\nImplausible pleadings do harm primarily by failing to\nground themselves sufficiently in reality such that defen-\ndants can know what is claimed. 1 Similarly, in Swanson\nv. Citibank, N.A., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"151889\"><a href=\"/opinion/151889/swanson-v-citibank-na/\"><span class=\"volume\">614</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">400</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th Cir. 2010), we\n\n\n1\n   Some commentators have noted a concern, underlying\nTwombly and Iqbal, with limiting defendants’ supposed\nburden of complying with discovery. See Miller, 60 Duke L. J. at\n53-59; Bone, 85 Notre Dame L. R. at 859. Others answer with\ncompeting concerns about providing plaintiffs with access to\ncourts in order to discover the actual but often hidden explana-\ntion for defendants’ harmful conduct. Given proper notice of the\nsort of claim being asserted, the Federal Rules of Civil Pro-\ncedure give courts and parties powerful tools to confine the\nscope of discovery to relevant issues. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b).\nI respectfully suggest that effective use of those tools is\nmuch more likely to control costs of litigation than the subjec-\ntive and uncertain pleading standard of Iqbal, which has\nbeen multiplying litigation of pleading disputes.\n\f32                                              No. 09-3561\n\nreversed dismissal of a complaint that only alleged\nracial discrimination generally, mentioning just the per-\npetrator and time-frame. These allegations were enough\nto “give the opposing party notice of what the case is\nall about.” Id. at 405.\n  The difference in result between Brooks and Swanson\ndid not depend, in my view, on the existence of an\nobvious alternative explanation, which was present in\nboth cases. See id. at 411 (Posner, J., dissenting in part).\nNor is the Monell claim raised by McCauley here sub-\nstantially more complicated than the discrimination\nalleged in Swanson. Rather, whether each of these com-\nplaints survives a Rule 12(b)(6) motion depends on a\nhighly subjective plausibility determination. That deter-\nmination must be made with great care, guided by an\nawareness of the core notice purpose behind Rule 8, as\nwell as knowledge of the consequence of dismissing\nseemingly improbable, yet potentially meritorious, dis-\ncrimination claims at such an early stage.\n  A simple thought experiment underscores the dan-\ngerous potential over-breadth of the Iqbal mode\nof parsing complaints — of first applying too aggres-\nsively the fact/conclusion dichotomy to a complaint,\nand then applying the “obvious alternative explana-\ntion” analysis to the facts that remain.\n  Imagine that as a federal district judge, you have read\nTwombly and Iqbal and now must act on a motion to\ndismiss an equal protection complaint in which the\nkey paragraph reads:\n\fNo. 09-3561                                               33\n\n    The educational opportunities provided by de-\n    fendants for infant plaintiffs in the separate all-Negro\n    schools are inferior to those provided for white\n    school children similarly situated in violation of the\n    equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment\n    to the Constitution of the United States. The respects\n    in which these opportunities are inferior include\n    the physical facilities, curricula, teaching, resources,\n    student personnel services, access and all other ed-\n    ucational factors, tangible and intangible, offered to\n    school children in Topeka. Apart from all other\n    factors, the racial segregation herein practiced in\n    and of itself constitutes an inferiority in educational\n    opportunity offered to Negroes, when compared\n    to educational opportunity offered to whites.\nUnder the Iqbal approach, the first sentence merely\nrecites a legal conclusion regarding the elements of an\nequal protection cause of action and thus should be\nexcluded from the Iqbal analysis. The third sentence is\nsimilarly a bare conclusion that should also be ignored.\nOnly the middle sentence contains what might amount\nto facts under Iqbal. A closer analysis, however, reveals\nan arguably fatal lack of explanation regarding how the\nlisted items are inferior. The thrust of the sentence is a\nbare conclusion that all factors, tangible and intangible,\ncontribute to the claimed deprivation. Does this complaint\nprovide the specific factual content required by Iqbal?\n  Even if the alleged “respects in which these oppor-\ntunities are inferior” might properly be called allega-\ntions of fact, it would be difficult for a claim of invidious\n\f34                                                No. 09-3561\n\ndiscrimination to seem plausible in light of the obvious\nalternative explanations for these deficiencies. School\nboards possess limited resources. Perhaps they simply\nallocated those resources according to neutral factors.\nDisparity in outcome is just as consistent with the\nnatural effects of lower socio-economic status as it\nis with pernicious effects of racial segregation. Or so\nthe post-Iqbal argument might go.\n  The paragraph quoted above is, of course, taken\ndirectly from plaintiffs’ amended complaint in Brown v.\nBoard of Education, filed on May 29, 1951. Amendment\nto Paragraph Eight of the Amended Complaint, Brown\nv. Board of Education, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1899646\"><a href=\"/opinion/1899646/brown-v-board-of-education-of-topeka/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

We also know that\nthe conclusory allegation of the third sentence\neventually appeared as the holding of the unanimous\nSupreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105221\"><a href=\"/opinion/105221/brown-v-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">347</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">483</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 495 (1954) (“Separate educational facilities\nare inherently unequal.”). Under the standards of\nIqbal, however, it would be easy to argue that the\nplaintiffs in Brown failed to state a plausible claim\nfor relief that could survive dismissal. The Court’s shift\nto “plausibility” pleading, and the assignment of inter-\npretation of that standard to the subjective common-sense\nof individual judges, has markedly increased the danger\nof throwing out the proverbial baby with the bathwater.2\n\n\n\n2\n  See also Miller, 60 Duke L. J. at 127-30 (applying a similar\nhypothetical analysis to the complaint in the seminal notice\n                                                 (continued...)\n\fNo. 09-3561                                               35\n\n  In the face of all these problems, what are the lower\nfederal courts to do? These are all sources of controlling\nlaw that we are obliged to follow. Although careful analy-\nsis may help the lower federal courts determine, for\nexample, that the Iqbal pleading standard would not\nrequire a different result in particular cases, there will\nbe cases, and Mr. McCauley’s equal protection claim\nappears to be one of them, where the standard makes\na decisive difference.\n  The first thing we can do is recognize the uncertainty\nthat litigants, their lawyers, and district courts now\nface. As a result of that uncertainty, the courts of\nappeals should insist that in all but the most unusual\nsituations, a party whose pleading is dismissed based\non the Iqbal plausibility standard should be entitled to an\nopportunity to amend the pleading after the court has\nmade its decision. Allowing amendment after pleadings\ndismissals had long been our practice even before\nTwombly and Iqbal. See, e.g., Barry Aviation Inc. v. Land O’\nLakes Municipal Airport Comm’n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"787141\"><a href=\"/opinion/787141/barry-aviation-incorporated-v-land-olakes-municipal-airport-commission/\"><span class=\"volume\">377</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">682</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 687 (7th\nCir. 2004) (quoting 5A Charles Allen Wright & Arthur R.\nMiller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1357 (2d ed. 1990)).\nWhether one favors broader or narrower readings of\nTwombly and Iqbal, no one denies that the cases are being\ninterpreted as having caused an upheaval in long-settled\nlaw. Attorneys and parties trying to draft complaints\n\n\n\n2\n  (...continued)\npleading case of Dioguardi v. Durning, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1568071\"><a href=\"/opinion/1568071/dioguardi-v-durning/\"><span class=\"volume\">139</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">774</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2d Cir.\n1944)).\n\f36                                              No. 09-3561\n\nand other pleadings will be left wondering about many\nimportant questions and contradictions that the Court\nhas not yet addressed. Rule 1 instructs us to construe\nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to secure the just,\nspeedy, and inexpensive determination of cases. The\nSupreme Court has often reminded us that pleading\nrules should be applied to facilitate a proper decision\non the merits rather than to impose a series of traps in\nwhich one mis-step can be decisive. E.g., Swierkiewicz,\n534 U.S. at 514 (“The liberal notice pleading of Rule 8(a)\nis the starting point of a simplified pleading system,\nwhich was adopted to focus litigation on the merits of\na claim.”), quoted in Christensen v. County of Boone, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"797469\"><a href=\"/opinion/797469/anita-christensen-and-robert-alty-v-county-of-boone-illinois-and-edward/\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">454</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 458-59 (7th Cir. 2007), and in Brooks, 578 F.3d at\n580. We should exercise caution to avoid punishing\nparties for imperfect predictions as to how the subjec-\ntive and inconsistent Iqbal standard might be applied\nin their case.\n  Some statistics show that generosity with regard to\nleave to amend appears to have increased under the\nnew pleading regime, even as the total percentage of\ndismissal motions granted has risen. See Hatamyar, 59\nAm. U. L. Rev. at 600 (analyzing statistics and finding\na “noticeable increase in dismissals with leave to amend\nunder Twombly and Iqbal”). District judges should\ncontinue to grant such leave when they are concerned\nwith the effects on plaintiffs that I have discussed above.\nThey should also grant leave when doing so could\nprevent results in otherwise similar cases from\ndiverging based merely on differences in plausibility\n\fNo. 09-3561                                                 37\n\ndeterminations made by different judges according to\ntheir individual judicial experience and common sense.\n  Courts must freely give leave to amend under\nRule 15(a) where interests of justice so require. Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 15(a); Foman v. Davis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106497\"><a href=\"/opinion/106497/foman-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">371</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">178</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 181-82 (1962).\nUnder this liberal rule, we allow amendment on remand\nin many procedural dismissal cases, and certainly do so\nwhen relevant decisional law changed after the com-\nplaint was filed. See, e.g., Ienco v. City of Chicago, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"777272\"><a href=\"/opinion/777272/joseph-ienco-v-city-of-chicago-a-municipal-corporation-po-kenneth/\"><span class=\"volume\">286</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">994</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 999 (7th Cir. 2002). When, as here, the changed deci-\nsional law involves the standard for pleading itself,\ninterests of justice call for an opportunity to amend essen-\ntially as a matter of course unless it is clear that the op-\nportunity would be futile. In Iqbal itself, the Supreme\nCourt remanded to the Second Circuit for a determina-\ntion whether to further remand — so that plaintiffs could\nseek leave to amend. 129 S. Ct. at 1954; see also Iqbal v.\nAshcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1359330\"><a href=\"/opinion/1359330/iqbal-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">574</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">820</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 822 (2d Cir. 2009) (remanding to\ndistrict court for determination regarding leave to\namend). We have continued to permit such amendment\nafter Twombly and Iqbal. See, e.g., Bausch v. Stryker Corp.,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"181671\"><a href=\"/opinion/181671/bausch-v-stryker-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">630</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">546</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 562 (7th Cir. 2010). We should do so here.\n  But where that approach is not enough to resolve\nthe case, I believe we must take care not to expand\nIqbal too aggressively beyond its highly unusual con-\ntext — allegations aimed at the nation’s highest-ranking\nlaw enforcement officials based on their response to\nunprecedented terrorist attacks on the United States\nhomeland — to cut off potentially viable claims. Iqbal\nexemplifies the old adage about hard cases. The failure\n\f38                                              No. 09-3561\n\nof the Supreme Court to address all of the law that would\nconflict with broad application of the case should weigh\nheavily against that broad application, at least until the\nSupreme Court provides clearer guidance about how to\nreconcile Iqbal with its prior cases, the Federal Rules of\nCivil Procedure, and their accompanying forms.\n  Reading the present complaint as a whole, plaintiff\nMcCauley has alleged the particulars of a plausible\nMonell claim. As the majority points out, McCauley has\nalleged the elements of such a claim using the relevant\nlegal language. While some of these statements are\nconclusory in nature, they serve to notify defendants\nand the court of the type of claim being brought. There\ncan be no doubt that the complaint provides suf-\nficient notice of the circumstances that gave rise to the\nclaims. McCauley made factual allegations that Chicago\npolice failed to arrest Martinez despite knowledge of\nhis harassment and violations, ¶ 25, and that this\nfailure resulted from a custom of untimeliness and indif-\nference with regard to the seriousness of domestic\nviolence, ¶ 125(c) and (j). McCauley alleges “deliberate\nindifference” generally, see ¶ 126, but elsewhere de-\nscribes numerous specific failures to act that are factu-\nally consistent with such an intent. See, e.g., ¶ 51. It\nis difficult to imagine what more McCauley might\nallege on the crucial question of intent without reciting\na list of specific states of mind that Chicago police policy-\nmakers might have. We did not require such a recital\nin Swanson and we should not do so here.\n  By extending Iqbal to dismiss plaintiff McCauley’s\nequal protection Monell claim against the City of Chicago,\n\fNo. 09-3561                                              39\n\nthe majority runs afoul of Leatherman, Rule 9(b), and the\nform complaints approved by the Supreme Court and\nCongress as part of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\nPerhaps the Supreme Court majority intended Iqbal to\nwork such a revolution in federal civil practice, but if so,\nthe Court failed to grapple with the conflicts and did not\nexpress any direct rejection of these other governing\nsources of law. Under these circumstances, therefore,\nI would reverse the dismissal of plaintiff’s equal protec-\ntion claim against the City of Chicago and give him\nan opportunity to pursue discovery. Even if I agreed\nthat the current version of the complaint failed to state\na claim, I would remand with instructions to give\nplaintiff an opportunity to file an amended complaint\nto try to comply with the new and uncertain standards\nof Iqbal.\n\n\n\n\n                          10-20-11\n\f</pre>",
