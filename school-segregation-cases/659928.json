This action\n\nalso seeks to invalidate the requirement that a political committee’s ads include an\n\nannouncement identifying the sponsor of the ad. See generally Fla. Stat. § 106.011\n\net seq. (2012) (the Florida Campaign Financing statutes).\n\n       The District Court upheld the Florida statutes and that ruling is the subject of\n\nthis appeal. Specifically, the District Court found no constitutional impediment to\n\nthe Florida Campaign Financing statutes as they apply to a ballot issue election. In\n\nso holding, the District Court validated Florida’s registration, bookkeeping, and\n\nreporting requirements together with advertising disclaimer requirements placed on\n\ngroups who spend money to influence ballot issue elections.\n\n       Because we are reviewing the District Court’s ruling on cross motions for\n\nsummary judgment, we review it de novo. Owen v. I. C. Sys., Inc., 629 F.3d 1263,\n\n1270 (11th Cir. 2011). We have carefully studied the constitutional issues as well\n\nas the record in this case, and for the reasons that follow, we affirm the District\n\nCourt’s ruling.\n\n∗\n Honorable C. Roger Vinson, United States District Judge for the Northern District of Florida,\nsitting by designation.\n                                               2\n\f              Case: 12-14074     Date Filed: 06/14/2013    Page: 3 of 35\n\n\n                                I. BACKGROUND\n\n      Andrew Nathan Worley, Pat Wayman, and John Scolaro (Challengers)\n\nwanted to join Robin Stublen—one of the original plaintiffs in the suit below—to\n\noppose a collection of statutes known as “Amendment 4” in Florida’s 2010 general\n\nelection. Challengers say they wanted to enhance their speech by pooling their\n\nmoney to buy radio ads. They planned to have each member of their group\n\ncontribute $150 so they would have at least $600 to spend on thirty-second radio\n\nads setting out five reasons to oppose Amendment 4. They also wanted to “pass\n\nthe hat” to raise and spend more money if possible.\n\n      It is true, as Challengers say, that even if they had raised and spent only their\n\nown $600, they would have met the definition of a “political committee”—or\n\nPAC—under Florida law. See Fla. Stat. § 106.011(1)(a) (defining a “political\n\ncommittee” to include two or more individuals who accept contributions of—or\n\nspend—more than $500 in a year to expressly advocate the election or defeat of a\n\ncandidate or the passage or defeat of a ballot issue). It is also true that once\n\nChallengers became a PAC under the statutes, there were a number of\n\nrequirements they had to meet. First and foremost, Florida PACs must disclose\n\ntheir donors who seek to influence Florida elections. See generally id. § 106.07\n\n(describing reporting requirements).\n\n      The regulations also oblige a Florida PAC to:\n\n\n                                           3\n\f                Case: 12-14074       Date Filed: 06/14/2013       Page: 4 of 35\n\n\n    • register with the state within 10 days after it is organized or, if it is organized\n      within ten days of an election, register immediately, id. § 106.03(1)(a);\n\n    • appoint a treasurer and establish a campaign depository, id. § 106.021(1)(a);\n\n    • deposit all funds within five business days of receipt, id. § 106.05;\n\n    • make all expenditures by check drawn from the campaign account, id.\n      § 106.11(1)(a);\n\n    • keep “detailed accounts” of receipts and expenditures, current to within no\n      more than two days, id. § 106.06(1);\n\n    • maintain records for at least two years after the date of the election to which\n      the accounts refer, id. § 106.06(3);\n\n    • file regular reports with the Division of Elections, itemizing every\n      contribution and expenditure, small or large, id. § 106.07(4)(a);1 and\n\n    • submit to random audits by the Division of Elections, id. § 106.22(10).\n\nFlorida PACs may not accept anonymous contributions in any amount or take cash\n\ncontributions over fifty dollars. Id. §§ 106.07(4)(A), 106.09. But there is no limit\n\non how much a Florida PAC can raise or spend. The information PACs are\n\nrequired to disclose is available to the public on the website of the Florida Division\n\nof Elections. See About Campaign Finance Database, Florida Division of\n\nElections, http://election.dos.state.fl.us/campaign-finance/cam-finance-data.shtml\n\n(last visited May 30, 2013).\n\n1\n Twenty-four states have ballot issue elections. Ballot Initiative Primer, CitizensinCharge.org,\nhttp://www.citizensincharge.org/learn/primer (last visited May 30, 2013). Four, including\nFlorida, have no minimum threshold for reporting contributions to, or expenditures by, PACs.\nAlaska Stat. Ann. § 15.13.040(b)(2) (2012); Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. § 169.226(e) (2012); and\nOhio Rev. Code Ann. § 3517.10(b)(4)(b) (2012).\n                                                4\n\f              Case: 12-14074     Date Filed: 06/14/2013   Page: 5 of 35\n\n\n      Challengers also want to invalidate the requirement that Florida speakers,\n\nincluding PACs, who spend money on an election identify themselves in their\n\npolitical ads. See Fla. Stat. § 106.143(1)(c)–(d). As with the disclosure\n\nrequirements, Challengers would also be governed by this provision. This means\n\nthey would have to include a short disclaimer in each of their radio ads.\n\n      Challengers brought this action to vindicate their view that these regulations\n\nare unduly burdensome and had chilled their speech, ultimately causing them to\n\nabandon their efforts. First, Challengers say they did not have time to “learn and\n\ncomply with the many regulations,” and they were rendered “unable to speak.”\n\nFor example, Challenger Pat Wayman, “[d]espite having worked in a law office . .\n\n. found the legal requirements confusing and did not believe that she could balance\n\nthe time required to serve as a political-committee treasurer with her other\n\nresponsibilities.” Election officials acknowledge that the laws were complex, and\n\nthat state officials newly working with the laws need months of study to become\n\ncomfortable with them.\n\n      Second, Challengers did not want to identify themselves in their radio ads.\n\nRather, they wanted to use all of their airtime for their message alone, so it could\n\nbe evaluated solely on the basis of its content. They calculated that a disclaimer\n\nwould take at least six seconds to read, thus forcing them to shorten their political\n\n\n\n\n                                          5\n\f                Case: 12-14074       Date Filed: 06/14/2013       Page: 6 of 35\n\n\nmessage by twenty percent. Alternatively, they would have to buy fewer, longer\n\nads to accommodate the time needed for the disclaimer.\n\n       Shortly before the 2010 election, Challengers brought this action protesting\n\nFlorida’s campaign finance disclosure and disclaimer scheme both facially and as\n\napplied to them—a small, grassroots group spending in a ballot issue election.\n\nThey rely upon the Supreme Court’s ruling in Citizens United v. Federal Election\n\nCommission, 558 U.S. 310, 130 S. Ct. 876 (2010), to support their argument that\n\nthe Florida scheme unconstitutionally burdens their freedom of speech.2\n\n       The District Court granted summary judgment to Florida with respect to the\n\ndisclosure and disclaimer requirements. However, the District Court found\n\nFlorida’s ban on contributions received in the last five days before an election to be\n\n2\n  Though the 2010 election has long passed, Challengers are politically active and say they\nintend to engage in similar political activity in the future. The parties do not dispute that this\ncase is ripe for adjudication. See Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393, 401–02, 95 S. Ct. 553, 558–59\n(1975) (explaining that a case remains ripe where the alleged harm is “capable of repetition, yet\nevading review” because there was insufficient time to litigate the original challenge and because\nthere is a reasonable expectation that the same party will be harmed in the same way again)\n(quotation marks omitted).\n\n        Also, Challengers continue to say that the Florida Campaign Financing statutes are\ndefective both facially and as applied. However, the record before us is not sufficient to\nestablish the nature and scope of Challengers’ activity. As the District Court remarked, “we’re\nnot [necessarily] talking about the $600 they wanted to spend last time” because Challengers\nsimply argued, with little specificity, that “they want to do this again.” Neither is the record\ndeveloped about how much money Challengers plan to or will raise by soliciting contributions.\nAt oral argument, their counsel would not limit the extent of Challengers’ proposed election\nspending, at one point admitting that “well, if someone gave them a million dollars, they would\nbe happy to spend that.”\n\n       Based on the record now before us, we have analyzed this case as a facial challenge to the\nFlorida Campaign Financing statutes made by groups spending to influence ballot issue elections\nas opposed to candidate elections.\n                                                6\n\f                Case: 12-14074        Date Filed: 06/14/2013        Page: 7 of 35\n\n\nunconstitutional, thus vindicating Challengers’ position in that regard. See Fla.\n\nStat. § 106.08(4). The State did not appeal that ruling.\n\n                       II. FLORIDA’S DISCLOSURE SCHEME\n\n    Challengers argue that the District Court was wrong to examine Florida’s PAC\n\nregulations under exacting scrutiny, rather than strict scrutiny. Challengers also\n\ncontest the District Court’s ruling that these regulations are constitutional in the\n\ncontext of a ballot issue election, arguing that the government lacks an\n\n“informational interest”3 in requiring disclosure for ballot initiatives.\n\n                                A. What Level of Scrutiny?\n\n       The Supreme Court has held that “[l]aws that burden political speech are\n\nsubject to strict scrutiny, which requires the Government to prove that the\n\nrestriction furthers a compelling interest and is narrowly tailored to achieve that\n\ninterest.” Citizens United, 558 U.S. at 340, 130 S. Ct. at 898 (quotation marks\n\nomitted). “At the same time, [the Supreme Court has] subjected strictures on\n\ncampaign-related speech that [it] found less onerous to a lower level of scrutiny\n\nand upheld those restrictions.” Arizona Free Enter. Club’s Freedom Club PAC v.\n\nBennett, ___ U.S. ___, ___, 131 S. Ct. 2806, 2817 (2011). On this subject,\n\nCitizens United offered the following guidance: “Disclaimer and disclosure\n\n\n3\n  As the Supreme Court has done, we will refer to a state’s interest in providing information to\nthe electorate as the state’s “informational interest.” See, e.g., Citizens United, 558 U.S. at 369,\n130 S. Ct. at 915.\n                                                  7\n\f              Case: 12-14074     Date Filed: 06/14/2013   Page: 8 of 35\n\n\nrequirements may burden the ability to speak, but they ‘impose no ceiling on\n\ncampaign-related activities,’ and ‘do not prevent anyone from speaking.’ The\n\nCourt has subjected these requirements to ‘exacting scrutiny,’ which requires a\n\n‘substantial relation’ between the disclosure requirement and a ‘sufficiently\n\nimportant’ governmental interest.” 558 U.S. at 366–67, 130 S. Ct. at 914 (citations\n\nomitted); see also Doe v. Reed, ___ U.S. ___, ___, 130 S. Ct. 2811, 2818 (2010)\n\n(listing “precedents considering First Amendment challenges to disclosure\n\nrequirements” analyzed under “exacting scrutiny”).\n\n      Challengers draw their argument from Citizens United, stating that the PAC\n\nregulations “put [them] in the same position that corporate shareholders and\n\nmanagers were in before Citizens United[:] . . . If Plaintiffs wish to speak\n\ncollectively, they must either speak through a heavily regulated PAC, or not at all.”\n\nBased on this, they say Florida’s PAC regulations must be reviewed under strict\n\nscrutiny. It is true that in Citizens United, the Supreme Court used strict scrutiny\n\nwhen it struck down a law that prohibited corporations from spending money from\n\ntheir corporate treasury to independently advocate for or against a candidate. The\n\nCourt characterized this prohibition, 2 U.S.C. § 441b (2006), as a ban on speech\n\neven though corporations could, under the law, establish and speak through a PAC.\n\nCitizens United, 558 U.S. at 337–40, 130 S. Ct. at 897–99. In support of their\n\nargument here, Challengers say that the Supreme Court found the rules they\n\n\n                                          8\n\f              Case: 12-14074    Date Filed: 06/14/2013   Page: 9 of 35\n\n\nconsidered in Citizens United to be a “ban” on speech for two independent reasons:\n\n1) because the corporation could not itself speak, and 2) because PACs were\n\noverregulated, burdensome alternatives. See id. at 337–39, 130 S. Ct. at 897–98.\n\nWith this reading in mind, Challengers urge that the Citizens United decision\n\nmeans “federal PAC requirements”—and by extension the “materially identical”\n\nregulations in this case—“must be reviewed with strict scrutiny.”\n\n      Challengers’ attempt to analogize the corporate expenditure ban in Citizens\n\nUnited to Florida PAC regulations misses the mark in at least four ways. First,\n\nPart IV of the Citizens United decision made clear that disclosure and disclaimer\n\nregimes are subject to “exacting scrutiny,” even where those regimes have costs\n\nthat potentially “decrease[] both the quantity and effectiveness of the group’s\n\nspeech.” 558 U.S. at 366, 368, 130 S. Ct. at 914–15.\n\n      Citizens United echoed Buckley v. Valeo, where the Supreme Court\n\ndistinguished between limits on political spending, which “necessarily reduce[] the\n\nquantity of expression by restricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of\n\ntheir exploration, and the size of the audience reached” and disclosure regulations,\n\nwhich “impose no ceiling on campaign-related activities.” Buckley v. Valeo, 424\n\nU.S. 1, 19, 64, 96 S. Ct. 612, 634, 656 (1976) (per curiam). Although the Court\n\nrecognized that disclosure carries with it “significant encroachments on First\n\nAmendment rights,” disclosure requirements are examined under exacting scrutiny\n\n\n                                          9\n\f             Case: 12-14074     Date Filed: 06/14/2013   Page: 10 of 35\n\n\nbecause they “appear to be the least restrictive means of curbing the evils of\n\ncampaign ignorance and corruption . . . ” Id. at 64, 68, 96 S. Ct. at 656, 658.\n\n      Challengers minimize Part IV of Citizens United by arguing that it is a\n\n“separate discussion[] of disclosure” relating only to federal electioneering\n\ncommunication disclosure, rather than the “uniquely burdensome” PAC disclosure.\n\nBut what the Supreme Court said in Part IV is not so easily set aside. The Court’s\n\ndescription of PAC requirements as burdensome does nothing to alter its holding in\n\nPart IV that disclosure schemes are subject to exacting scrutiny. Citizens United,\n\n558 U.S. at 366–67, 130 S. Ct. at 914; see also Real Truth About Abortion, Inc. v.\n\nFEC, 681 F.3d 544, 549 (4th Cir. 2012) (“[A]fter Citizens United, it remains the\n\nlaw that provisions imposing disclosure obligations are reviewed under . . .\n\n‘exacting scrutiny.’”).\n\n      Second, Citizens United found the “prohibition on corporate independent\n\nexpenditures” to be an outright ban on speech, but made no such finding about\n\nfederal PAC requirements. 558 U.S. at 339, 130 S. Ct. at 898. More to the point,\n\nthe Court analyzed the prohibition on political contributions by corporations (2\n\nU.S.C. § 441b) under strict scrutiny because it entirely prevented a corporation\n\nfrom speaking as a corporation, and the only justification given for the ban was\n\nthat it was “corporate speech.” Id. at 337–43, 130 S. Ct. at 897–900. In this\n\ncontext, strict scrutiny applied “notwithstanding the fact that a PAC created by a\n\n\n                                         10\n\f             Case: 12-14074     Date Filed: 06/14/2013   Page: 11 of 35\n\n\ncorporation can still speak” because “[a] PAC is a separate association from the\n\ncorporation.” Id. at 337, 130 S. Ct. at 897. “So the PAC exemption from § 441b’s\n\n[corporate treasury] expenditure ban, § 441b(b)(2), [still did] not allow\n\ncorporations to speak.” Id. (emphasis added). It is true, of course, that Citizens\n\nUnited discussed PAC regulations as “burdensome alternatives.” Id. But nowhere\n\ndid Citizens United hold that PAC regulations themselves constitute a ban on\n\nspeech or that they should be subject to strict scrutiny. Cf. SpeechNow.org v.\n\nFEC, 599 F.3d 686, 696–98 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (en banc) (upholding the federal PAC\n\nrequirements under exacting scrutiny in the wake of Citizens United), cert. denied,\n\nKeating v. FEC, ___ U.S. ___, 131 S. Ct. 553 (2010).\n\n      In contrast with the corporations in Citizens United, Challengers are free to\n\nspeak themselves. It is only when they wish to speak collectively to influence\n\nelections that the Florida PAC regulations apply. Challengers reject this assurance,\n\nand assert that this is the same argument made and rejected in Citizens United. But\n\nthat is not so. Citizens United rejected the argument that an individual corporation,\n\nowned by corporate shareholders and managed by corporate managers, could be\n\nconfined to speaking through a PAC or through its individual shareholders or\n\nmanagers. 558 U.S. at 337, 130 S. Ct. at 897. Citizens United did not reject laws\n\nthat require individuals spending collectively for the purpose of influencing an\n\n\n\n\n                                         11\n\f             Case: 12-14074    Date Filed: 06/14/2013   Page: 12 of 35\n\n\nelection to comply with PAC regulations. See SpeechNow.org, 599 F.3d at 696–\n\n98.\n\n      Third, Challengers’ position is in conflict with cases from every one of our\n\nsister Circuits who have considered the question, all of whom have applied\n\nexacting scrutiny to disclosure schemes.

Buescher, 625 F.3d 1247, 1249–50, 1261\n\n(10th Cir. 2010); SpeechNow.org, 599 F.3d at 696.\n\n      It is worth noting from among these cases, that SpeechNow.org v. Federal\n\nElection Commission presented facts very similar to those we consider here. In\n\nthat case, five people wanted to get together and spend on an election but argued\n\nthat “the additional burden that would be imposed on SpeechNow[.org] if it were\n\nrequired to comply with the organizational and reporting requirements applicable\n\nto political committees [was] too much for the First Amendment to bear.”\n\n\n                                        12\n\f               Case: 12-14074       Date Filed: 06/14/2013       Page: 13 of 35\n\n\nSpeechNow.org, 599 F.3d at 697. SpeechNow.org was prepared to comply with\n\nreporting requirements for individuals making independent expenditures under 2\n\nU.S.C. § 434(c), 434(g)(1)–(2), but argued against the §§ 431 and 432 burdens (on\n\ngroups), such as “designating a treasurer and retaining records.” Id. at 697–98.\n\nWriting for the en banc court, Judge Sentelle examined and rejected that argument\n\nunder exacting scrutiny. See id. at 697–98.\n\n       Finally, to the extent Challengers seek to rely on the Eighth Circuit’s opinion\n\nin Minnesota Citizens Concerned for Life, Inc. v. Swanson, it offers them little if\n\nany help. In Minnesota Citizens, the Eighth Circuit examined a law requiring\n\nevery association wishing to make any independent election expenditures to\n\n“create and register its own independent expenditure political fund.” 692 F.3d at\n\n868. It is true that the Eighth Circuit questioned whether exacting scrutiny applied\n\nto laws “which subject associations that engage in minimal speech to . . .\n\nregulations that accompany status as a PAC.” Id. at 875 (quotation marks and\n\nalterations omitted). But in the end, the Minnesota Citizens Court applied exacting\n\nscrutiny to examine Minnesota’s political fund rules. Id. at 874–77.4\n\n       After considering each of Challengers’ arguments, we conclude that\n\nFlorida’s PAC regulations are subject to “exacting scrutiny,” so they must be\n\n\n4\n  But see Minn. Citizens, 692 F.3d at 880–87 (Melloy, J., concurring and dissenting, joined by\nMurphy, Bye and Smith, JJ.) (arguing that the “exacting scrutiny” applied by the majority\nrequired more from the government than a proper exacting scrutiny analysis).\n                                               13\n\f             Case: 12-14074     Date Filed: 06/14/2013    Page: 14 of 35\n\n\nsubstantially related to a sufficiently important government interest. Citizens\n\nUnited, 558 U.S. at 366–67, 130 S. Ct. at 914.\n\n                B. Sufficiently Important Government Interest?\n\n      As the Supreme Court explained in Buckley,\n\n      disclosure provides the electorate with information as to where\n      political campaign money comes from and how it is spent by the\n      candidate in order to aid the voters in evaluating those who seek\n      federal office. It allows voters to place each candidate in the political\n      spectrum more precisely than is often possible solely on the basis of\n      party labels and campaign speeches. The sources of a candidate’s\n      financial support also alert the voter to the interests to which a\n      candidate is most likely to be responsive and thus facilitate predictions\n      of future performance in office.\n\n424 U.S. at 66–67, 96 S. Ct. at 657 (quotation marks and footnote omitted).\n\n      In Citizens United, the Court upheld disclosure and disclaimer requirements\n\nbased, in part, on the “governmental interest in providing information to the\n\nelectorate.” 558 U.S. at 368, 130 S. Ct. at 914. The Court explained that “the\n\npublic has an interest in knowing who is speaking about a candidate.” Id. at 369,\n\n130 S. Ct. at 915. Indeed, it endorsed disclosure as a matter of sound public\n\npolicy: “The First Amendment protects political speech; and disclosure permits\n\ncitizens and shareholders to react to the speech of corporate entities in a proper\n\nway. This transparency enables the electorate to make informed decisions and give\n\nproper weight to different speakers and messages.” Id. at 371, 130 S. Ct. at 916.\n\n\n\n\n                                          14\n\f             Case: 12-14074     Date Filed: 06/14/2013    Page: 15 of 35\n\n\n      Challengers argue here that the public’s right to know who is speaking about\n\na candidate does not extend to ballot issues. In support, Challengers say that\n\ncorruption and political favoritism are notably absent in the context of ballot issue\n\nelections. See First Nat’l Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U.S. 765, 790, 98 S. Ct.\n\n1407, 1423 (1978) (“The risk of corruption perceived in cases involving candidate\n\nelections . . . simply is not present in a popular vote on a public issue.”) (emphasis\n\nadded) (citations omitted). Against this background, Challengers tell us there is\n\n“only one interest compelling enough to justify PAC requirements: the prevention\n\nof ‘quid pro quo corruption’ of political candidates.” Challengers’ crucial point is\n\nthat voters have an interest in knowing “who is speaking about a candidate.” See\n\nCitizens United, 558 U.S. at 369, 130 S. Ct. at 915 (emphasis added).\n\n      Finally, Challengers argue that the Supreme Court has never relied on the\n\npublic’s right to know where there is no risk of corruption, despite having been\n\ninvited to do so. In support, Challengers point to Doe v. Reed, in which the State\n\nof Washington defended its law that allowed the names and addresses of those who\n\nhad signed a petition to challenge a state law by referendum to be made public.\n\n130 S. Ct. at 2815. Washington said making public those who signed the petitions\n\nwould combat fraud; ferret out invalid signatures; and promote transparency and\n\naccountability. Id. at 2819. The Supreme Court neither recognized nor\n\ninvalidated Washington’s informational interest in this context. Rather, the Court\n\n\n                                          15\n\f             Case: 12-14074      Date Filed: 06/14/2013    Page: 16 of 35\n\n\nobserved that Washington had a sufficient “interest in preserving the integrity of\n\nthe electoral process,” such that it did not need to “address the State’s\n\n‘informational’ interest.” Id.\n\n      In any event, Challengers’ attempt to delink the Supreme Court’s acceptance\n\nof a state’s informational interest from ballot issues creates problems for them.\n\nFirst, their argument that there can be no informational interest in the absence of a\n\nfear of quid pro quo corruption, i.e., in a ballot issue election, was rejected in\n\nCitizens United. Central to the holding of Citizens United was the Supreme\n\nCourt’s conclusion that “independent expenditures, including those made by\n\ncorporations, do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption.” 558\n\nU.S. at 357, 130 S. Ct. at 909. Thus, when the Court upheld disclosure\n\nrequirements even where a corporation was making only independent\n\nexpenditures, it sanctioned disclosure where it found no corruption or appearance\n\nof corruption. To the extent the Court held that “the informational interest alone is\n\nsufficient to justify” disclosure, id. at 369, 130 S. Ct. at 915–16, it cannot be true\n\nthat, as Challengers assert, there is no sufficient or valid interest in providing\n\ninformation to voters in the absence of corruption.\n\n      Second, Challengers’ argument is not consistent with two cases, directly on\n\npoint, in which the Supreme Court explicitly endorsed disclosure schemes as\n\nconstitutional, if not beneficial, in ballot issue elections. In First National Bank of\n\n\n                                           16\n\f             Case: 12-14074      Date Filed: 06/14/2013    Page: 17 of 35\n\n\nBoston v. Bellotti, the Court struck down a Massachusetts statute that banned\n\nspending by banks and corporations in referendum elections on issues that did not\n\ndirectly affect their property. 435 U.S. at 767–68, 98 S. Ct. at 1411. It is true that\n\nBellotti held that such limits were not warranted in a ballot issue election lacking\n\nfear of quid pro quo corruption. See id. at 789–90, 98 S. Ct. at 1423. But the\n\nCourt also explained that “[c]orporate advertising, unlike some methods of\n\nparticipation in political campaigns, is likely to be highly visible. Identification of\n\nthe source of advertising may be required as a means of disclosure, so that the\n\npeople will be able to evaluate the arguments to which they are being subjected.”\n\nId. at 792 n.32, 98 S. Ct. at 1424 n.32. The Bellotti ruling would not allow\n\nMassachusetts, in service of providing better information, to cut back on speech by\n\nbanning it from a certain source: corporations. “[F]ar from inviting greater\n\nrestriction of speech,” explained the Court, “the direct participation of the people\n\nin a referendum, if anything, increases the need for the widest possible\n\ndissemination of information from diverse and antagonistic sources.” Id. at 792\n\nn.29, 98 S. Ct. at 1424 n.29 (quotation marks omitted). And the companion to this\n\nbroader participation is the idea that disclosure and disclaimer rules lead to more\n\nspeech and more information disseminated to the public. Thus the Supreme Court\n\nhas taught that disclosure rules do promote a legitimate government interest,\n\nwhether in the ballot issue or candidate election context.\n\n\n                                          17\n\f             Case: 12-14074      Date Filed: 06/14/2013    Page: 18 of 35\n\n\n      Indeed, in Citizens Against Rent Control/Coalition for Fair Housing v. City\n\nof Berkeley, California, the Supreme Court again endorsed broad disclosure rules\n\nin the context of a ballot issue election. 454 U.S. 290, 298–300, 102 S. Ct. 434,\n\n438–39 (1981). The Court noted that Berkeley voters would know “the identity of\n\nthose whose money supports or opposes a given ballot measure since contributors\n\nmust make their identities known under [another section] of the ordinance.” Id. at\n\n298, 102 S. Ct. at 438. What the Court objected to was “restricting contributions”\n\nin the absence of quid pro quo corruption. Id. at 297, 102 S. Ct. at 438 (emphasis\n\nadded) (quotation marks omitted). The Court held that the contribution limits\n\nimposed by Berkeley were unnecessary because “[t]he integrity of the political\n\nsystem will be adequately protected if contributors are identified in a public filing\n\nrevealing the amounts contributed . . . [and] if it is thought wise, legislation can\n\noutlaw anonymous contributions.” Id. at 299–300, 102 S. Ct. at 439. Citizens\n\nAgainst Rent Control clearly recognizes the informational interest Florida\n\nadvances before us.\n\n      Challengers argue that the ballot issue case more on point is McIntyre v.\n\nOhio Elections Commission, 514 U.S. 334, 115 S. Ct. 1511 (1995). In her case,\n\nand in contrast to ours, Mrs. McIntyre represented only herself in handing out\n\nhandbills she had composed, and which opposed a school tax referendum. Id. at\n\n337, 115 S. Ct. at 1514. She was fined for violating an Ohio statute which\n\n\n                                           18\n\f             Case: 12-14074     Date Filed: 06/14/2013    Page: 19 of 35\n\n\noutlawed the distribution of anonymous campaign literature. Id. at 338, 115 S. Ct.\n\nat 1514. However, the Supreme Court invalidated the law requiring that political\n\nhandbills contain an author disclaimer when the handbills were about “ballot issues\n\nthat present[ed] neither a substantial risk of libel nor any potential appearance of\n\ncorrupt advantage.” Id. at 351–52, 115 S. Ct. at 1521. But the Court also\n\ndiscussed campaign finance disclosures, making it clear that “[t]hough such\n\nmandatory reporting [of the amount and use of money spent] undeniably impedes\n\nprotected First Amendment activity, the intrusion is a far cry from compelled self-\n\nidentification on all election-related writings.” Id. at 355, 115 S. Ct. at 1523. The\n\nCourt contrasted the impact of disclosure rules requiring a name on a handbill with\n\nthose requiring disclosure of an “expenditure.” It recognized that disclosure of\n\nexpenditures is “less specific, less personal, and less provocative.” Id. Thus, we\n\ndo not find McIntyre to be as helpful to Challengers’ case as they suggest.\n\n      Third, the weight of persuasive Circuit precedent cuts against the distinction\n\nbetween candidate elections and ballot issue elections which Challengers ask us to\n\nadopt. See, e.g., Ctr. for Individual Freedom, 697 F.3d at 480–85; Family PAC v.\n\nMcKenna, 685 F.3d 800, 803–814 (9th Cir. 2012); McKee II, 669 F.3d at 39–41;\n\nMcKee I, 649 F.3d at 41–44, 55–61; Human Life, 624 F.3d at 1002–1019; cf.\n\nSpeechNow.org, 599 F.3d at 696 (where the D.C. Circuit did not consider a ballot\n\nissue election but nevertheless interpreted Buckley as having “upheld . . .\n\n\n                                          19\n\f             Case: 12-14074     Date Filed: 06/14/2013   Page: 20 of 35\n\n\ndisclosure requirements . . . based on a governmental interest in ‘provid[ing] the\n\nelectorate with information’ about the sources of political campaign funds, not just\n\nthe interest in deterring corruption and enforcing anti-corruption measures”\n\n(emphasis added)). The First and the Ninth Circuits have even described the\n\ninformational interest as “compelling” in the ballot issue context. McKee II, 669\n\nF.3d at 40; McKee I, 649 F.3d at 57; Human Life, 624 F.3d at 1005–06.\n\n      Our sister Circuits have offered thoughtful explanations for why disclosure\n\nadvances government interests in the ballot issue context. For example, the\n\nSeventh Circuit explained its belief that:\n\n      Educating voters is at least as important, if not more so, in the context\n      of initiatives and referenda as in candidate elections. In direct\n      democracy, where citizens are responsible for taking positions on\n      some of the day’s most contentious and technical issues, voters act as\n      legislators, while interest groups and individuals advocating a\n      measure’s defeat or passage act as lobbyists.\n\nCtr. for Individual Freedom, 697 F.3d at 480 (quotation marks and alterations\n\nomitted). The Ninth Circuit suggested that disclosure may be more useful in the\n\ncontext of ballot initiatives because:\n\n      Disclosure also gives voters insight into the actual policy\n      ramifications of a ballot measure. Knowing which interested parties\n      back or oppose a ballot measure is critical, especially when one\n      considers that ballot-measure language is typically confusing, and the\n      long-term policy ramifications of the ballot measure are often\n      unknown. At least by knowing who backs or opposes a given\n      initiative, voters will have a pretty good idea of who stands to benefit\n      from the legislation. In addition, mandating disclosure of the\n\n\n                                             20\n\f             Case: 12-14074     Date Filed: 06/14/2013   Page: 21 of 35\n\n\n      financiers of a ballot initiative may prevent the wolf from\n      masquerading in sheep’s clothing.\n\nFamily PAC, 685 F.3d at 808 (quotation marks and citations omitted).\n\n      Nevertheless, Challengers urge us to adopt the Tenth Circuit’s contrary\n\nreasoning in Sampson v. Buescher. In Sampson, the Tenth Circuit recognized that\n\nwith respect to “financial-disclosure requirement[s] in the ballot-issue context,” the\n\nSupreme Court “has spoken favorably of such requirements.” 625 F.3d at 1257.\n\nHowever, the Sampson Court expressed its own view that “[i]t is not obvious that\n\nthere is” a “public interest in knowing who is spending and receiving money to\n\nsupport or oppose a ballot issue” because candidate elections are “ad hominem\n\naffairs” that require voters to “evaluate a human being,” whereas ballot issue\n\nelections simply present a “choice [of] whether to approve or disapprove of\n\ndiscrete governmental action.” Id. at 1256–57. This distinction led the Tenth\n\nCircuit to suggest that nondisclosure would actually be a net positive because it\n\nwould “require the debate to actually be about the merits of the proposition on the\n\nballot,” not the people funding it. Id. at 1257.\n\n      In the same way the Supreme Court in Citizens United rejected the idea that\n\nthe messenger distorts the message, see 558 U.S. at 349–51, 130 S. Ct. at 904–905,\n\nwe reject the notion that knowing who the messenger is distorts the message. The\n\npremise of the antidistortion argument rejected in Citizens United is that\n\ncorporations use the corporate form to accumulate wealth, which allows them to\n                                          21\n\f             Case: 12-14074      Date Filed: 06/14/2013    Page: 22 of 35\n\n\npromote ideas “that have little or no correlation to the public’s support.” Id. at\n\n348, 130 S. Ct. at 903 (citation omitted). The Court disposed of this argument,\n\nsaying that “[p]olitical speech is indispensable to decisionmaking in a democracy,”\n\nwhether “the speech comes from a corporation” or “an individual.” Id. at 349, 130\n\nS. Ct. at 904 (citation omitted). Citizens United does not command states to enact\n\ndisclosure laws, but it does suggest that First Amendment analysis must be wary of\n\nthe argument that less speech is more. The Circuits recognizing a sufficient\n\ninformational interest in the ballot issue context have the better arguments.\n\n      Finally, we note that even in Sampson, the Tenth Circuit did not invalidate a\n\nlaw that required disclosures in the ballot issue context. Instead it held the law\n\nunconstitutional as applied to those plaintiffs because “the governmental interest in\n\nimposing . . . regulations is minimal, if not nonexistent, in light of the small size of\n\nthe contributions.” Sampson, 625 F.3d at 1261. Thus, even Sampson does not, in\n\nthe end, call into question that there could be a “sufficiently important”\n\ninformational interest in requiring disclosure in the ballot issue context.\n\n      Our reading of Supreme Court and persuasive Circuit precedent compels us\n\nto conclude that promoting an informed electorate in a ballot issue election is a\n\nsufficiently important governmental interest to justify the Florida PAC regulations\n\nwe consider here.\n\n              C. Substantially Related to the Government Interest?\n\n\n                                           22\n\f             Case: 12-14074     Date Filed: 06/14/2013    Page: 23 of 35\n\n\n      “Though possibly less rigorous than strict scrutiny, exacting scrutiny is more\n\nthan a rubber stamp.” Minn. Citizens, 692 F.3d at 876 (citations omitted).\n\nExacting scrutiny requires that Florida’s interest in promoting an informed\n\nelectorate be “substantially related” to its PAC regulations. See Citizens United,\n\n558 U.S. at 366–67, 130 S. Ct. at 914. Applying this standard, Florida must justify\n\nthe burden its PAC regulations place on even small groups raising $500 or more by\n\nrequiring that they register as political committees; meet ongoing reporting\n\ndeadlines; and track and report all contributions, no matter how small.\n\n      Challengers argue that the law is not properly tailored because it “imposes\n\nno minimum threshold on disclosure [and] requires the disclosure of a vast amount\n\nof unnecessary information,” which is burdensome, especially for grassroots\n\ngroups. Challengers read precedent from our sister Circuits to favor a finding that\n\nFlorida’s extensive reporting obligations fail exacting scrutiny. Challengers say\n\nthe facts of their case are most analogous to those in Sampson, where the Tenth\n\nCircuit found that similar PAC requirements imposed on a group that raised just\n\n$782.02 failed exacting scrutiny. Challengers also urge us to adopt the reasoning\n\nof Minnesota Citizens to find that “ongoing reporting requirements” along with\n\n“[o]ther requirements, such as requiring a treasurer, segregated funds, and record-\n\nkeeping” are “unrelated” to a professed informational interest or at best\n\n“tangentially related” to that interest. 692 F.3d at 875 n.9.\n\n\n                                          23\n\f             Case: 12-14074     Date Filed: 06/14/2013    Page: 24 of 35\n\n\n      But neither Sampson nor Minnesota Citizens is helpful to us given the nature\n\nof this challenge. As we mentioned in footnote 2, supra, we are not equipped to\n\nevaluate this case as an “as applied” challenge because the record does not tell us\n\nenough about what Challengers are doing. While Challengers have emphasized\n\nthat they are merely a grassroots group of four people who want to spend a modest\n\namount of money in a ballot issue election, they also emphasize their desire to\n\nsolicit contributions. We know little if anything about how much money they\n\nintend to raise or how many people they wish to solicit. We will not speculate\n\nabout their future success as fundraisers. Based on the record we do have, we\n\nconsider this challenge to the Florida PAC regulations to be a facial challenge.\n\nThis means that Challengers cannot prevail unless they can prove “that no set of\n\ncircumstances exists under which the [regulations] would be valid.” United States\n\nv. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 745, 107 S. Ct. 2095, 2100 (1987). They have not\n\ncarried that burden here.\n\n      First, the District Court got it right when it said that the organizational\n\nrequirements in Florida’s PAC regulations do not generally impose an undue\n\nburden on PACs. We agree with the District Court that these regulations “require\n\nlittle more if anything than a prudent person or group would do in these\n\ncircumstances anyway.” Certainly a group wanting to raise and spend money to\n\ninfluence an election likely would: “put someone in charge of the money” and\n\n\n                                          24\n\f             Case: 12-14074     Date Filed: 06/14/2013   Page: 25 of 35\n\n\ndecide where to keep it, see Fla. Stat. § 106.021(1)(a) (requiring that Florida PACs\n\nappoint a treasurer and open a separate bank account); avoid loss or comingling of\n\nfunds by depositing money into that account promptly, see id. § 106.05 (requiring\n\nFlorida PACs to deposit all funds within five business days of receipt); keep good\n\nrecords, see id. § 106.06(1), (3) (requiring Florida PACs to keep updated records);\n\nand, to promote good recordkeeping, disburse funds by check rather than cash, see\n\nid. § 106.11(1)(a) (requiring Florida PACs to disburse funds by check). See\n\nSpeechNow.org, 599 F.3d at 696–98 (holding that similar organizational\n\nrequirements in the federal PAC regulations were not unconstitutionally\n\nburdensome).\n\n      In much the same way, the reporting and registration requirements are not\n\nunduly burdensome. Registration involves submitting a “statement of\n\norganization,” see Fla. Stat. § 106.03(1)(a), which requires filling out four pages of\n\nbasic information. Florida PACs must file periodic reports, see id. § 106.07(3), but\n\nreporting requirements are allowed under our Constitution, and if there is\n\nsomething to report, it would make sense that Challengers would be tracking\n\ncontributions anyway. Florida PACs may be subjected to random audits, see id.\n\n§ 106.22(10), but this again is a small burden—especially where the PAC already\n\ntracks the money it gets in and gives out. Finally, the ongoing reporting\n\nrequirements are not especially burdensome given that Florida law allows PACs to\n\n\n                                          25\n\f               Case: 12-14074       Date Filed: 06/14/2013       Page: 26 of 35\n\n\nterminate more easily than federal PAC requirements allow. Compare Fla. Stat.\n\n§ 106.03(2)(j) (requiring a Florida PAC to state how it will dispose of its residual\n\nfunds if it terminates) and id. § 106.03(5) (requiring a Florida PAC that “disbands\n\nor determines it will no longer receive contributions or make expenditures” to\n\n“notify the agency or officer with whom such committee is required to [register]”),\n\nwith 11 C.F.R. §§ 102.3(a)(1), 116.7 (allowing a committee to terminate only upon\n\nfiling a written notice with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) or other\n\nagency specified under 11 C.F.R. § 105, and only if the PAC settles “outstanding\n\ndebts and obligations”) and id. at § 102.4 (outlining the FEC termination process).\n\n       Second, Florida’s PAC regulations advance the government’s informational\n\ninterest even as they apply to small groups in Florida and require the tracking of\n\nany and all donations. Albeit in dicta, in Let’s Help Florida. v. McCrary, the Fifth\n\nCircuit endorsed Florida’s then-existing PAC regulations as a suitable alternative\n\nto contribution limits insofar as they helped to inform the electorate about spending\n\nin campaigns. 621 F.2d 195, 200–01 (5th Cir. 1980).5 And at least one court has\n\nremarked that “[i]t is far from clear . . . that even a zero-dollar disclosure threshold\n\nwould succumb to exacting scrutiny.” Family PAC, 685 F.3d at 809 n.7.\n\n       Challengers’ pleas on behalf of a few people pooling a small amount of\n\nmoney ring a bit hollow to the extent that they refuse to foreclose their option for\n\n5\n In Bonner v. City of Prichard, we adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth\nCircuit handed down before October 1, 1981. 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir. 1981) (en banc).\n                                               26\n\f             Case: 12-14074     Date Filed: 06/14/2013   Page: 27 of 35\n\n\nraising big money. Now Challengers present themselves as intending to spend\n\nonly $600. However, as we noted above, they also acknowledged at oral argument\n\nthat if they received a $1 million donation, they would happily spend it.\n\nChallengers argue that the government may only regulate “established” groups.\n\nHowever, requiring registration by groups who start with as little as $500 also\n\nadvances the government’s informational interests. Indeed, we know that federal\n\nPAC requirements kick in once a group has raised $1000 during a calendar year to\n\ninfluence elections and that these requirements have not been held\n\nunconstitutional. See 2 U.S.C. § 431(4)(a) (2012); Buckley, 424 U.S. at 79–80, 96\n\nS. Ct. at 663–64; cf. SpeechNow.org, 599 F.3d at 696–98 (concerning a PAC\n\nformed by just five individuals).\n\n      Florida also advances its informational interest through a first-dollar\n\ndisclosure threshold because knowing the source of even small donations is\n\ninformative in the aggregate and prevents evasion of disclosure. As the First\n\nCircuit explained in National Organization for Marriage, Inc. v. McKee (McKee\n\nII), “[t]he issue is . . . not whether voters clamor for information about each ‘Hank\n\nJones’ who gave $100 to support an initiative. Rather, the issue is whether the\n\ncumulative effect of disclosure ensures that the electorate will have access to\n\ninformation regarding the driving forces backing and opposing each bill.” 669\n\nF.3d at 41 (quotation marks omitted). To reiterate, we recognize that the\n\n\n                                          27\n\f             Case: 12-14074     Date Filed: 06/14/2013    Page: 28 of 35\n\n\ngovernment’s informational interest may not be greatly advanced by disclosing a\n\nsingle, small contribution. However, disclosure of a plethora of small\n\ncontributions could certainly inform voters about the breadth of support for a group\n\nor a cause. As Florida also points out, the first-dollar threshold prevents a big\n\ndonor from thwarting the State’s informational interest entirely by making a\n\nnumber of small donations.\n\n      Finally, Supreme Court and Circuit precedent has “consistently upheld\n\norganizational and reporting requirements against facial challenges,”\n\nSpeechNow.org, 599 F.3d at 696, in part because crafting such disclosure schemes\n\nis better left to the legislature. While we hold that the disclosure scheme survives\n\nexacting scrutiny, we nevertheless find the discussion in National Organization for\n\nMarriage v. McKee (McKee I) assessing disclosure thresholds to be instructive:\n\n             [Plaintiffs] argue[] that Maine lacks a “sufficiently important”\n      interest in the $100 threshold at which the reporting requirement\n      adheres, and, alternatively, that the threshold lacks a “substantial\n      relation” to a sufficiently important governmental interest.\n      [Plaintiffs’] argument operates from a mistaken premise; we do not\n      review reporting thresholds under the “exacting scrutiny” framework.\n      In Buckley, facing a similar challenge to a $10 threshold for a\n      recordkeeping provision and a $100 reporting threshold, the Supreme\n      Court noted that the choice of where to set such monetary thresholds\n      “is necessarily a judgmental decision, best left in the context of this\n      complex legislation to congressional discretion.”           The Court\n      concluded that, although there was no evidence in the record that\n      Congress had “focused carefully on the appropriate level at which to\n      require recording and disclosure,” and despite the fact that the low\n      thresholds might “discourage participation by some citizens in the\n      political process,” it could not say that “the limits designated are\n                                          28\n\f               Case: 12-14074       Date Filed: 06/14/2013       Page: 29 of 35\n\n\n       wholly without rationality.” The Court thus upheld [the Federal\n       Election Campaign Act’s] recordkeeping and reporting thresholds.\n\n              Following Buckley, we have granted “judicial deference to\n       plausible legislative judgments” as to the appropriate location of a\n       reporting threshold, and have upheld such legislative determinations\n       unless they are “‘wholly without rationality.’”\n\n649 F.3d at 60 (citations omitted); see also Family PAC, 685 F.3d at 811\n\n(“[D]isclosure thresholds . . . are inherently inexact; courts therefore owe\n\nsubstantial deference to legislative judgments fixing these amounts.”). With this in\n\nmind, we cannot say that the PAC regulations are too broad to be substantially\n\nrelated to Florida’s informational interests.\n\n       Third, Challengers’ arguments that Sampson and Minnesota Citizens dictate\n\nan outcome in their favor make little sense given the nature of their appeal. In\n\nSampson, the Tenth Circuit held that application of Colorado PAC requirements to\n\na group of individuals who reported “nonmonetary contributions (signs, a banner,\n\npostcards, and postage) totaling $782.02” for a ballot issue election was\n\nunconstitutional.6 625 F.3d at 1252. The law in that case imposed registration\n\nrequirements on groups raising or spending over $200 and required disclosure for\n\nall donations over $20. Id. at 1249. But in any event, the Tenth Circuit did not\n\n6\n  After the plaintiffs in Sampson received a complaint from the Colorado Secretary of State, they\nraised cash in the amount of $1,426, and paid $1,178.82 of that amount for attorney fees. 625\nF.3d at 1260 & n.5. The ballot issue they opposed was a proposal to annex the neighborhood of\nParker North into the Town of Parker. Id. at 1251. The annexation measure was defeated by a\nvote of 351 to 21 prior to the Tenth Circuit’s ruling in Sampson, id., and there was no indication\nthat the Sampson plaintiffs intended to involve themselves in any future ballot issues. See\ngenerally id. at 1251–54.\n                                                29\n\f              Case: 12-14074       Date Filed: 06/14/2013     Page: 30 of 35\n\n\nfacially strike down that law, explaining that “[w]e do not attempt to draw a bright\n\nline below which a ballot-issue committee cannot be required to report\n\ncontributions and expenditures. The case before us is quite unlike ones involving\n\nthe expenditure of tens of millions of dollars. . . .” Id. at 1261.\n\n       Here, Challengers openly acknowledge they seek to raise more money in the\n\nfuture. This fact distinguishes them from the Sampson plaintiffs, who never\n\nexpressed a desire to continue soliciting contributions. See generally id. at 1251–\n\n54. Thus, our ruling in favor of Florida does not conflict with Sampson, and we\n\nneed not reach the question of whether the statute is constitutional as applied to\n\nfour individuals raising only $600.\n\n       Neither is Minnesota Citizens of assistance to Challengers. Minnesota\n\nCitizens limited its holding to ongoing reporting requirements for associations\n\nspending to influence elections that did not otherwise qualify as PACs under\n\nMinnesota law. See 692 F.3d at 877. The Eighth Circuit left no question that\n\ngroups “whose major purpose is to influence the nomination or election of a\n\ncandidate or to promote or defeat a ballot question,” like Challengers here, would\n\nhave to comply with the state political fund disclosure requirements challenged in\n\nMinnesota Citizens. Id. at 877 n.11 (quotation marks omitted). 7\n\n\n\n7\n The law in Minnesota Citizens was flawed in part because “Minnesota ha[d] not stated any\nplausible reason why continued reporting from nearly all associations, regardless of the\n                                             30\n\f               Case: 12-14074        Date Filed: 06/14/2013       Page: 31 of 35\n\n\n       Challengers are free to petition the legislature to reset the reporting\n\nrequirements for Florida’s PAC regulations, but we decline to do so here.\n\nChallengers’ facial challenge cannot succeed because Florida has adequately\n\ndemonstrated that existing PAC regulations are substantially related to a\n\nsufficiently important government interest.8\n\n      III. FLORIDA’S ADVERTISING DISCLAIMER REQUIREMENT\n\n       Challengers also contest the District Court’s finding that Florida’s\n\nadvertising disclaimer requirement is constitutional in ballot issue elections.\n\nChallengers reference McIntyre, in which the Supreme Court explained that “an\n\nauthor’s decision to remain anonymous, like other decisions concerning omissions\n\nor additions to the content of a publication, is an aspect of the freedom of speech\n\nprotected by the First Amendment.” 514 U.S. at 342, 115 S. Ct. at 1516. In\n\n\n\nassociation’s major purpose, [was] necessary to accomplish [its] interests.” 692 F.3d at 877\n(second emphasis added).\n\n        It is worth noting that this lack of a “major purpose” requirement for regulation was also\nthe way in which the Minnesota Citizens Court distinguished that case from SpeechNow.org. Id.\nat 875 n.10. But in Florida, in contrast to Minnesota, for all elections, including ballot issue\nelections, “[c]orporations regulated by chapter 607 or chapter 617 or other business entities\nformed for purposes other than to support or oppose issues or candidates” are, in fact “not\nconsidered political committees.” Fla. Stat. § 106.011(1)(b). In other words, there is no\nMinnesota Citizens problem with a lack of a “major purpose” test because the law does not\n“impose[] . . . requirements on all associations, regardless of the association’s purpose.” 692 F.3d\nat 875 n.10.\n8\n While we decline to address Florida’s failure to set minimum thresholds on disclosure, we do\nhave concerns about the burdens that the lack of these minimums place on truly small grassroots\ngroups with little experience and little money. However, because this appeal is properly viewed\nas a facial challenge, the issue need not be decided here\n                                                31\n\f             Case: 12-14074     Date Filed: 06/14/2013    Page: 32 of 35\n\n\nCitizens United, however, the Supreme Court expressly rejected the argument that\n\na broadcast advertisement disclaimer requirement was unconstitutional because it\n\n“decrease[d] both the quantity and effectiveness of the group’s speech by forcing it\n\nto devote four seconds of each advertisement to the spoken disclaimer.” 558 U.S.\n\nat 368, 130 S. Ct. at 915. The Court noted, among other things, that it had\n\nexplained in Bellotti that “[i]dentification of the source of advertising may be\n\nrequired as a means of disclosure.” Id. (quoting Bellotti, 435 U.S. at 792 n.32, 98\n\nS. Ct. at 1424 n.32).\n\n      Nonetheless, Challengers argue that McIntyre remains good law, and\n\ndictates the demise of Florida’s disclaimer requirement. Specifically, Challengers\n\nargue that under McIntyre, Florida’s “simple interest in providing voters with\n\nadditional relevant information,” 514 U.S. at 348, 115 S. Ct. at 1520, is not a\n\nsufficient interest to burden speech significantly. Indeed, Challengers argue that\n\nthe burden on their speech is greater than that placed on the pamphleteer in\n\nMcIntyre, as they will probably have to decrease a thirty-second message by six\n\nseconds, resulting in a twenty percent loss in content.\n\n      Challengers say, too, that the District Court’s distinguishing of McIntyre\n\nconflicted with First Amendment principles. First, Challengers argue that the\n\nDistrict Court drew a distinction between handbills and radio ads, which was\n\nwrong because courts “must decline to draw, and then redraw, constitutional lines\n\n\n                                          32\n\f             Case: 12-14074     Date Filed: 06/14/2013    Page: 33 of 35\n\n\nbased on the particular media or technology used to disseminate political speech.”\n\nCitizens United, 558 U.S. at 326, 130 S. Ct. at 891. Second, Challengers argue that\n\nthe District Court’s finding that their collaborative speech did not fall within the\n\nscope of McIntyre’s holding was also error because the First Amendment applies\n\nwith equal force to groups and individuals. Third, Challengers object to the\n\nDistrict Court’s holding that McIntyre did not apply to them because they have no\n\nright to receive anonymous contributions to fund radio ads. Specifically,\n\nChallengers object to this holding because they argue that the Supreme Court has\n\nnever found a state informational interest in the ballot issue context that could\n\nthwart anonymous contributions.\n\n      Each of Challengers’ arguments fails in light of Citizens United, Bellotti,\n\nCitizens Against Rent Control, and McIntyre itself. First, Florida’s disclaimer\n\nrequirement is materially indistinguishable from the disclaimer requirement upheld\n\nin Citizens United. The only differences in the disclaimer requirements before us\n\nand those addressed by the Supreme Court in Citizens United are that we have a\n\nballot issue election before us, and Challengers claim it will take them six seconds\n\nto read the disclaimer as opposed to the four seconds recited in Citizens United.\n\nSee Citizens United, 558 U.S. at 366, 130 S. Ct. at 914. Citizens United upheld\n\nthat disclaimer requirement without any mention of McIntyre. Id. at 366–71, 130\n\nS. Ct. at 914–16. As we have discussed at length, Challengers’ proposed\n\n\n                                          33\n\f             Case: 12-14074      Date Filed: 06/14/2013   Page: 34 of 35\n\n\ndistinction between ballot issue elections and candidate elections is not supported\n\nby precedent and does not compel a departure from Citizens United here.\n\n      Second, a disclaimer requirement was endorsed in the ballot issue context,\n\nalbeit in dicta, in Bellotti. 435 U.S. at 792 n.32, 98 S. Ct. at 1424 n.32\n\n(“Identification of the source of advertising may be required as a means of\n\ndisclosure, so that the people will be able to evaluate the arguments to which they\n\nare being subjected.”). McIntyre did not purport to overrule Bellotti. 514 U.S. at\n\n353–54, 115 S. Ct. at 1522–23.\n\n      Third, McIntyre was a narrow decision that expressly disavowed application\n\nto other forms of media. McIntyre limited its holding to “only written\n\ncommunications and, particularly, leaflets of the kind Mrs. McIntyre distributed.”\n\n514 U.S. at 338 n.3, 115 S. Ct. at 1514 n.3; see also Reed, 130 S. Ct. at 2831 n.4\n\n(Stevens, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment) (explaining the\n\nlimitations of McIntyre). Indeed McIntyre declined to address the constitutionality\n\nof the radio provision of the Ohio statute. 514 U.S. at 338 n.3, 115 S. Ct. at 1514\n\nn.3. As Justice Ginsburg wrote in concurrence:\n\n      In for a calf is not always in for a cow. The Court’s decision finds\n      unnecessary, overintrusive, and inconsistent with American ideals the\n      State’s imposition of a fine on an individual leafleteer who, within her\n      local community, spoke her mind, but sometimes not her name. We\n      do not thereby hold that the State may not in other, larger\n      circumstances require the speaker to disclose its interest by disclosing\n      its identity.\n\n\n                                          34\n\f               Case: 12-14074     Date Filed: 06/14/2013    Page: 35 of 35\n\n\nId. at 358, 115 S. Ct. at 1524 (Ginsburg, J., concurring). McIntyre simply did not\n\nspeak to disclaimers required for radio ads.\n\n         Fourth, the fact that the advertising disclaimer requirement here applies to\n\ngroups that spend money in elections is important. See McIntyre, 514 U.S. at 355,\n\n115 S. Ct. at 1523 (describing campaign finance disclosure requirements as being\n\nless burdensome than other speech regulations). Citizens Against Rent Control,\n\nwhich McIntyre did not purport to overrule, explained, albeit in dicta, that “if it is\n\nthought wise, legislation can outlaw anonymous contributions.” 454 U.S. at 300,\n\n102 S. Ct. at 439. A disclaimer naming the PAC that purchased the ad prevents\n\nanonymous election spending. Challengers argue that even if this is true, the\n\ndisclaimer does not actually advance any interest in disclosure because all funders\n\nhave to do is disclaim the name of the PAC, not a list of individual contributors.\n\nBut we reject that argument given that Florida PACs have to disclose their\n\ncontributors in a public forum. Indeed, that is what Challengers are complaining\n\nabout.\n\n         Therefore, we agree with the District Court that Florida’s advertising\n\ndisclaimer requirement is constitutional.\n\n                                  IV. CONCLUSION\n\n         For each of these reasons, the opinion of the District Court is\n\n         AFFIRMED.\n\n\n                                            35\n\f",

This action\n\nalso seeks to invalidate the requirement that a political committee’s ads include an\n\nannouncement identifying the sponsor of the ad. See generally Fla. Stat. § 106.011\n\net seq. (2012) (the Florida Campaign Financing statutes).\n\n       The District Court upheld the Florida statutes and that ruling is the subject of\n\nthis appeal. Specifically, the District Court found no constitutional impediment to\n\nthe Florida Campaign Financing statutes as they apply to a ballot issue election. In\n\nso holding, the District Court validated Florida’s registration, bookkeeping, and\n\nreporting requirements together with advertising disclaimer requirements placed on\n\ngroups who spend money to influence ballot issue elections.\n\n       Because we are reviewing the District Court’s ruling on cross motions for\n\nsummary judgment, we review it de novo.

Roger Vinson, United States District Judge for the Northern District of Florida,\nsitting by designation.\n                                               2\n\f              Case: 12-14074     Date Filed: 06/14/2013    Page: 3 of 35\n\n\n                                I. BACKGROUND\n\n      Andrew Nathan Worley, Pat Wayman, and John Scolaro (Challengers)\n\nwanted to join Robin Stublen—one of the original plaintiffs in the suit below—to\n\noppose a collection of statutes known as “Amendment 4” in Florida’s 2010 general\n\nelection. Challengers say they wanted to enhance their speech by pooling their\n\nmoney to buy radio ads. They planned to have each member of their group\n\ncontribute $150 so they would have at least $600 to spend on thirty-second radio\n\nads setting out five reasons to oppose Amendment 4. They also wanted to “pass\n\nthe hat” to raise and spend more money if possible.\n\n      It is true, as Challengers say, that even if they had raised and spent only their\n\nown $600, they would have met the definition of a “political committee”—or\n\nPAC—under Florida law.

Stat. § 106.011(1)(a) (defining a “political\n\ncommittee” to include two or more individuals who accept contributions of—or\n\nspend—more than $500 in a year to expressly advocate the election or defeat of a\n\ncandidate or the passage or defeat of a ballot issue). It is also true that once\n\nChallengers became a PAC under the statutes, there were a number of\n\nrequirements they had to meet. First and foremost, Florida PACs must disclose\n\ntheir donors who seek to influence Florida elections. See generally id. § 106.07\n\n(describing reporting requirements).\n\n      The regulations also oblige a Florida PAC to:\n\n\n                                           3\n\f                Case: 12-14074       Date Filed: 06/14/2013       Page: 4 of 35\n\n\n    • register with the state within 10 days after it is organized or, if it is organized\n      within ten days of an election, register immediately, id. § 106.03(1)(a);\n\n    • appoint a treasurer and establish a campaign depository, id. § 106.021(1)(a);\n\n    • deposit all funds within five business days of receipt, id. § 106.05;\n\n    • make all expenditures by check drawn from the campaign account, id.\n      § 106.11(1)(a);\n\n    • keep “detailed accounts” of receipts and expenditures, current to within no\n      more than two days, id. § 106.06(1);\n\n    • maintain records for at least two years after the date of the election to which\n      the accounts refer, id. § 106.06(3);\n\n    • file regular reports with the Division of Elections, itemizing every\n      contribution and expenditure, small or large, id. § 106.07(4)(a);1 and\n\n    • submit to random audits by the Division of Elections, id. § 106.22(10).\n\nFlorida PACs may not accept anonymous contributions in any amount or take cash\n\ncontributions over fifty dollars. Id. §§ 106.07(4)(A), 106.09. But there is no limit\n\non how much a Florida PAC can raise or spend. The information PACs are\n\nrequired to disclose is available to the public on the website of the Florida Division\n\nof Elections.

See Fla. Stat. § 106.143(1)(c)–(d). As with the disclosure\n\nrequirements, Challengers would also be governed by this provision. This means\n\nthey would have to include a short disclaimer in each of their radio ads.\n\n      Challengers brought this action to vindicate their view that these regulations\n\nare unduly burdensome and had chilled their speech, ultimately causing them to\n\nabandon their efforts. First, Challengers say they did not have time to “learn and\n\ncomply with the many regulations,” and they were rendered “unable to speak.”\n\nFor example, Challenger Pat Wayman, “[d]espite having worked in a law office . .\n\n. found the legal requirements confusing and did not believe that she could balance\n\nthe time required to serve as a political-committee treasurer with her other\n\nresponsibilities.” Election officials acknowledge that the laws were complex, and\n\nthat state officials newly working with the laws need months of study to become\n\ncomfortable with them.\n\n      Second, Challengers did not want to identify themselves in their radio ads.\n\nRather, they wanted to use all of their airtime for their message alone, so it could\n\nbe evaluated solely on the basis of its content. They calculated that a disclaimer\n\nwould take at least six seconds to read, thus forcing them to shorten their political\n\n\n\n\n                                          5\n\f                Case: 12-14074       Date Filed: 06/14/2013       Page: 6 of 35\n\n\nmessage by twenty percent. Alternatively, they would have to buy fewer, longer\n\nads to accommodate the time needed for the disclaimer.\n\n       Shortly before the 2010 election, Challengers brought this action protesting\n\nFlorida’s campaign finance disclosure and disclaimer scheme both facially and as\n\napplied to them—a small, grassroots group spending in a ballot issue election.\n\nThey rely upon the Supreme Court’s ruling in Citizens United v.

FLORIDA’S DISCLOSURE SCHEME\n\n    Challengers argue that the District Court was wrong to examine Florida’s PAC\n\nregulations under exacting scrutiny, rather than strict scrutiny. Challengers also\n\ncontest the District Court’s ruling that these regulations are constitutional in the\n\ncontext of a ballot issue election, arguing that the government lacks an\n\n“informational interest”3 in requiring disclosure for ballot initiatives.\n\n                                A. What Level of Scrutiny?\n\n       The Supreme Court has held that “[l]aws that burden political speech are\n\nsubject to strict scrutiny, which requires the Government to prove that the\n\nrestriction furthers a compelling interest and is narrowly tailored to achieve that\n\ninterest.” Citizens United, 558 U.S. at 340, 130 S. Ct. at 898 (quotation marks\n\nomitted). “At the same time, [the Supreme Court has] subjected strictures on\n\ncampaign-related speech that [it] found less onerous to a lower level of scrutiny\n\nand upheld those restrictions.” Arizona Free Enter.

On this subject,\n\nCitizens United offered the following guidance: “Disclaimer and disclosure\n\n\n3\n  As the Supreme Court has done, we will refer to a state’s interest in providing information to\nthe electorate as the state’s “informational interest.” See, e.g., Citizens United, 558 U.S. at 369,\n130 S.

Ct. at 914 (citations\n\nomitted); see also Doe v. Reed, ___ U.S. ___, ___, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"150541\"><a href=\"/opinion/150541/doe-v-reed/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

If Plaintiffs wish to speak\n\ncollectively, they must either speak through a heavily regulated PAC, or not at all.”\n\nBased on this, they say Florida’s PAC regulations must be reviewed under strict\n\nscrutiny. It is true that in Citizens United, the Supreme Court used strict scrutiny\n\nwhen it struck down a law that prohibited corporations from spending money from\n\ntheir corporate treasury to independently advocate for or against a candidate. The\n\nCourt characterized this prohibition, 2 U.S.C. § 441b (2006), as a ban on speech\n\neven though corporations could, under the law, establish and speak through a PAC.\n\nCitizens United, 558 U.S. at 337–40, 130 S. Ct. at 897–99. In support of their\n\nargument here, Challengers say that the Supreme Court found the rules they\n\n\n                                          8\n\f              Case: 12-14074    Date Filed: 06/14/2013   Page: 9 of 35\n\n\nconsidered in Citizens United to be a “ban” on speech for two independent reasons:\n\n1) because the corporation could not itself speak, and 2) because PACs were\n\noverregulated, burdensome alternatives. See id. at 337–39, 130 S. Ct. at 897–98.\n\nWith this reading in mind, Challengers urge that the Citizens United decision\n\nmeans “federal PAC requirements”—and by extension the “materially identical”\n\nregulations in this case—“must be reviewed with strict scrutiny.”\n\n      Challengers’ attempt to analogize the corporate expenditure ban in Citizens\n\nUnited to Florida PAC regulations misses the mark in at least four ways. First,\n\nPart IV of the Citizens United decision made clear that disclosure and disclaimer\n\nregimes are subject to “exacting scrutiny,” even where those regimes have costs\n\nthat potentially “decrease[] both the quantity and effectiveness of the group’s\n\nspeech.” 558 U.S. at 366, 368, 130 S. Ct. at 914–15.\n\n      Citizens United echoed Buckley v. Valeo, where the Supreme Court\n\ndistinguished between limits on political spending, which “necessarily reduce[] the\n\nquantity of expression by restricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of\n\ntheir exploration, and the size of the audience reached” and disclosure regulations,\n\nwhich “impose no ceiling on campaign-related activities.” Buckley v. Valeo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109380\"><a href=\"/opinion/109380/buckley-v-valeo/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 19, 64, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109380\"><a href=\"/opinion/109380/buckley-v-valeo/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">612</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 634, 656 (1976) (per curiam). Although the Court\n\nrecognized that disclosure carries with it “significant encroachments on First\n\nAmendment rights,” disclosure requirements are examined under exacting scrutiny\n\n\n                                          9\n\f             Case: 12-14074     Date Filed: 06/14/2013   Page: 10 of 35\n\n\nbecause they “appear to be the least restrictive means of curbing the evils of\n\ncampaign ignorance and corruption . . . ” Id. at 64, 68, 96 S. Ct. at 656, 658.\n\n      Challengers minimize Part IV of Citizens United by arguing that it is a\n\n“separate discussion[] of disclosure” relating only to federal electioneering\n\ncommunication disclosure, rather than the “uniquely burdensome” PAC disclosure.\n\nBut what the Supreme Court said in Part IV is not so easily set aside. The Court’s\n\ndescription of PAC requirements as burdensome does nothing to alter its holding in\n\nPart IV that disclosure schemes are subject to exacting scrutiny. Citizens United,\n\n558 U.S. at 366–67, 130 S. Ct. at 914; see also Real Truth About Abortion, Inc. v.\n\nFEC, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">681</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">544</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 549 (4th Cir. 2012) (“[A]fter Citizens United, it remains the\n\nlaw that provisions imposing disclosure obligations are reviewed under . . .\n\n‘exacting scrutiny.’”).\n\n      Second, Citizens United found the “prohibition on corporate independent\n\nexpenditures” to be an outright ban on speech, but made no such finding about\n\nfederal PAC requirements. 558 U.S. at 339, 130 S. Ct. at 898. More to the point,\n\nthe Court analyzed the prohibition on political contributions by corporations (2\n\nU.S.C. § 441b) under strict scrutiny because it entirely prevented a corporation\n\nfrom speaking as a corporation, and the only justification given for the ban was\n\nthat it was “corporate speech.” Id. at 337–43, 130 S. Ct. at 897–900. In this\n\ncontext, strict scrutiny applied “notwithstanding the fact that a PAC created by a\n\n\n                                         10\n\f             Case: 12-14074     Date Filed: 06/14/2013   Page: 11 of 35\n\n\ncorporation can still speak” because “[a] PAC is a separate association from the\n\ncorporation.” Id. at 337, 130 S. Ct. at 897. “So the PAC exemption from § 441b’s\n\n[corporate treasury] expenditure ban, § 441b(b)(2), [still did] not allow\n\ncorporations to speak.” Id. (emphasis added). It is true, of course, that Citizens\n\nUnited discussed PAC regulations as “burdensome alternatives.” Id. But nowhere\n\ndid Citizens United hold that PAC regulations themselves constitute a ban on\n\nspeech or that they should be subject to strict scrutiny. Cf.

It is only when they wish to speak collectively to influence\n\nelections that the Florida PAC regulations apply. Challengers reject this assurance,\n\nand assert that this is the same argument made and rejected in Citizens United. But\n\nthat is not so. Citizens United rejected the argument that an individual corporation,\n\nowned by corporate shareholders and managed by corporate managers, could be\n\nconfined to speaking through a PAC or through its individual shareholders or\n\nmanagers. 558 U.S. at 337, 130 S.

Federal\n\nElection Commission presented facts very similar to those we consider here. In\n\nthat case, five people wanted to get together and spend on an election but argued\n\nthat “the additional burden that would be imposed on SpeechNow[.org] if it were\n\nrequired to comply with the organizational and reporting requirements applicable\n\nto political committees [was] too much for the First Amendment to bear.”\n\n\n                                        12\n\f               Case: 12-14074       Date Filed: 06/14/2013       Page: 13 of 35\n\n\nSpeechNow.org, 599 F.3d at 697. SpeechNow.org was prepared to comply with\n\nreporting requirements for individuals making independent expenditures under 2\n\nU.S.C. § 434(c), 434(g)(1)–(2), but argued against the §§ 431 and 432 burdens (on\n\ngroups), such as “designating a treasurer and retaining records.” Id. at 697–98.\n\nWriting for the en banc court, Judge Sentelle examined and rejected that argument\n\nunder exacting scrutiny. See id. at 697–98.\n\n       Finally, to the extent Challengers seek to rely on the Eighth Circuit’s opinion\n\nin Minnesota Citizens Concerned for Life, Inc. v. Swanson, it offers them little if\n\nany help. In Minnesota Citizens, the Eighth Circuit examined a law requiring\n\nevery association wishing to make any independent election expenditures to\n\n“create and register its own independent expenditure political fund.” 692 F.3d at\n\n868. It is true that the Eighth Circuit questioned whether exacting scrutiny applied\n\nto laws “which subject associations that engage in minimal speech to . . .\n\nregulations that accompany status as a PAC.” Id. at 875 (quotation marks and\n\nalterations omitted). But in the end, the Minnesota Citizens Court applied exacting\n\nscrutiny to examine Minnesota’s political fund rules. Id. at 874–77.4\n\n       After considering each of Challengers’ arguments, we conclude that\n\nFlorida’s PAC regulations are subject to “exacting scrutiny,” so they must be\n\n\n4\n  But see Minn. Citizens, 692 F.3d at 880–87 (Melloy, J., concurring and dissenting, joined by\nMurphy, Bye and Smith, JJ.)

Sufficiently Important Government Interest?\n\n      As the Supreme Court explained in Buckley,\n\n      disclosure provides the electorate with information as to where\n      political campaign money comes from and how it is spent by the\n      candidate in order to aid the voters in evaluating those who seek\n      federal office. It allows voters to place each candidate in the political\n      spectrum more precisely than is often possible solely on the basis of\n      party labels and campaign speeches. The sources of a candidate’s\n      financial support also alert the voter to the interests to which a\n      candidate is most likely to be responsive and thus facilitate predictions\n      of future performance in office.\n\n424 U.S. at 66–67, 96 S. Ct. at 657 (quotation marks and footnote omitted).\n\n      In Citizens United, the Court upheld disclosure and disclaimer requirements\n\nbased, in part, on the “governmental interest in providing information to the\n\nelectorate.” 558 U.S. at 368, 130 S. Ct. at 914. The Court explained that “the\n\npublic has an interest in knowing who is speaking about a candidate.” Id. at 369,\n\n130 S. Ct. at 915. Indeed, it endorsed disclosure as a matter of sound public\n\npolicy: “The First Amendment protects political speech; and disclosure permits\n\ncitizens and shareholders to react to the speech of corporate entities in a proper\n\nway. This transparency enables the electorate to make informed decisions and give\n\nproper weight to different speakers and messages.” Id. at 371, 130 S. Ct. at 916.\n\n\n\n\n                                          14\n\f             Case: 12-14074     Date Filed: 06/14/2013    Page: 15 of 35\n\n\n      Challengers argue here that the public’s right to know who is speaking about\n\na candidate does not extend to ballot issues. In support, Challengers say that\n\ncorruption and political favoritism are notably absent in the context of ballot issue\n\nelections. See First Nat’l Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109836\"><a href=\"/opinion/109836/first-nat-bank-of-boston-v-bellotti/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">765</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 790, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109836\"><a href=\"/opinion/109836/first-nat-bank-of-boston-v-bellotti/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Against this background, Challengers tell us there is\n\n“only one interest compelling enough to justify PAC requirements: the prevention\n\nof ‘quid pro quo corruption’ of political candidates.” Challengers’ crucial point is\n\nthat voters have an interest in knowing “who is speaking about a candidate.” See\n\nCitizens United, 558 U.S. at 369, 130 S. Ct. at 915 (emphasis added).\n\n      Finally, Challengers argue that the Supreme Court has never relied on the\n\npublic’s right to know where there is no risk of corruption, despite having been\n\ninvited to do so. In support, Challengers point to Doe v. Reed, in which the State\n\nof Washington defended its law that allowed the names and addresses of those who\n\nhad signed a petition to challenge a state law by referendum to be made public.\n\n130 S. Ct. at 2815. Washington said making public those who signed the petitions\n\nwould combat fraud; ferret out invalid signatures; and promote transparency and\n\naccountability. Id. at 2819. The Supreme Court neither recognized nor\n\ninvalidated Washington’s informational interest in this context. Rather, the Court\n\n\n                                          15\n\f             Case: 12-14074      Date Filed: 06/14/2013    Page: 16 of 35\n\n\nobserved that Washington had a sufficient “interest in preserving the integrity of\n\nthe electoral process,” such that it did not need to “address the State’s\n\n‘informational’ interest.” Id.\n\n      In any event, Challengers’ attempt to delink the Supreme Court’s acceptance\n\nof a state’s informational interest from ballot issues creates problems for them.\n\nFirst, their argument that there can be no informational interest in the absence of a\n\nfear of quid pro quo corruption, i.e., in a ballot issue election, was rejected in\n\nCitizens United. Central to the holding of Citizens United was the Supreme\n\nCourt’s conclusion that “independent expenditures, including those made by\n\ncorporations, do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption.” 558\n\nU.S. at 357, 130 S. Ct. at 909. Thus, when the Court upheld disclosure\n\nrequirements even where a corporation was making only independent\n\nexpenditures, it sanctioned disclosure where it found no corruption or appearance\n\nof corruption. To the extent the Court held that “the informational interest alone is\n\nsufficient to justify” disclosure, id. at 369, 130 S. Ct. at 915–16, it cannot be true\n\nthat, as Challengers assert, there is no sufficient or valid interest in providing\n\ninformation to voters in the absence of corruption.\n\n      Second, Challengers’ argument is not consistent with two cases, directly on\n\npoint, in which the Supreme Court explicitly endorsed disclosure schemes as\n\nconstitutional, if not beneficial, in ballot issue elections. In First National Bank of\n\n\n                                           16\n\f             Case: 12-14074      Date Filed: 06/14/2013    Page: 17 of 35\n\n\nBoston v. Bellotti, the Court struck down a Massachusetts statute that banned\n\nspending by banks and corporations in referendum elections on issues that did not\n\ndirectly affect their property. 435 U.S. at 767–68, 98 S. Ct. at 1411. It is true that\n\nBellotti held that such limits were not warranted in a ballot issue election lacking\n\nfear of quid pro quo corruption. See id. at 789–90, 98 S. Ct. at 1423. But the\n\nCourt also explained that “[c]orporate advertising, unlike some methods of\n\nparticipation in political campaigns, is likely to be highly visible. Identification of\n\nthe source of advertising may be required as a means of disclosure, so that the\n\npeople will be able to evaluate the arguments to which they are being subjected.”\n\nId. at 792 n.32, 98 S. Ct. at 1424 n.32. The Bellotti ruling would not allow\n\nMassachusetts, in service of providing better information, to cut back on speech by\n\nbanning it from a certain source: corporations. “[F]ar from inviting greater\n\nrestriction of speech,” explained the Court, “the direct participation of the people\n\nin a referendum, if anything, increases the need for the widest possible\n\ndissemination of information from diverse and antagonistic sources.” Id. at 792\n\nn.29, 98 S. Ct. at 1424 n.29 (quotation marks omitted). And the companion to this\n\nbroader participation is the idea that disclosure and disclaimer rules lead to more\n\nspeech and more information disseminated to the public. Thus the Supreme Court\n\nhas taught that disclosure rules do promote a legitimate government interest,\n\nwhether in the ballot issue or candidate election context.\n\n\n                                          17\n\f             Case: 12-14074      Date Filed: 06/14/2013    Page: 18 of 35\n\n\n      Indeed, in Citizens Against Rent Control/Coalition for Fair Housing v. City\n\nof Berkeley, California, the Supreme Court again endorsed broad disclosure rules\n\nin the context of a ballot issue election. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110588\"><a href=\"/opinion/110588/citizens-against-rent-controlcoalition-for-fair-housing-v-berkeley/\"><span class=\"volume\">454</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">290</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 298–300, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110588\"><a href=\"/opinion/110588/citizens-against-rent-controlcoalition-for-fair-housing-v-berkeley/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">434</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n438–39 (1981). The Court noted that Berkeley voters would know “the identity of\n\nthose whose money supports or opposes a given ballot measure since contributors\n\nmust make their identities known under [another section] of the ordinance.” Id. at\n\n298, 102 S. Ct. at 438. What the Court objected to was “restricting contributions”\n\nin the absence of quid pro quo corruption. Id. at 297, 102 S. Ct. at 438 (emphasis\n\nadded) (quotation marks omitted). The Court held that the contribution limits\n\nimposed by Berkeley were unnecessary because “[t]he integrity of the political\n\nsystem will be adequately protected if contributors are identified in a public filing\n\nrevealing the amounts contributed . . . [and] if it is thought wise, legislation can\n\noutlaw anonymous contributions.” Id. at 299–300, 102 S. Ct. at 439. Citizens\n\nAgainst Rent Control clearly recognizes the informational interest Florida\n\nadvances before us.\n\n      Challengers argue that the ballot issue case more on point is McIntyre v.\n\nOhio Elections Commission, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117921\"><a href=\"/opinion/117921/mcintyre-v-ohio-elections-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">334</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117921\"><a href=\"/opinion/117921/mcintyre-v-ohio-elections-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1511</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1995). In her case,\n\nand in contrast to ours, Mrs. McIntyre represented only herself in handing out\n\nhandbills she had composed, and which opposed a school tax referendum. Id. at\n\n337, 115 S. Ct. at 1514. She was fined for violating an Ohio statute which\n\n\n                                           18\n\f             Case: 12-14074     Date Filed: 06/14/2013    Page: 19 of 35\n\n\noutlawed the distribution of anonymous campaign literature. Id. at 338, 115 S. Ct.\n\nat 1514. However, the Supreme Court invalidated the law requiring that political\n\nhandbills contain an author disclaimer when the handbills were about “ballot issues\n\nthat present[ed] neither a substantial risk of libel nor any potential appearance of\n\ncorrupt advantage.” Id. at 351–52, 115 S. Ct. at 1521. But the Court also\n\ndiscussed campaign finance disclosures, making it clear that “[t]hough such\n\nmandatory reporting [of the amount and use of money spent] undeniably impedes\n\nprotected First Amendment activity, the intrusion is a far cry from compelled self-\n\nidentification on all election-related writings.” Id. at 355, 115 S. Ct. at 1523. The\n\nCourt contrasted the impact of disclosure rules requiring a name on a handbill with\n\nthose requiring disclosure of an “expenditure.” It recognized that disclosure of\n\nexpenditures is “less specific, less personal, and less provocative.” Id. Thus, we\n\ndo not find McIntyre to be as helpful to Challengers’ case as they suggest.\n\n      Third, the weight of persuasive Circuit precedent cuts against the distinction\n\nbetween candidate elections and ballot issue elections which Challengers ask us to\n\nadopt. See, e.g., Ctr. for Individual Freedom, 697 F.3d at 480–85; Family PAC v.\n\nMcKenna, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">685</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">800</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 803–814 (9th Cir. 2012); McKee II, 669 F.3d at 39–41;\n\nMcKee I, 649 F.3d at 41–44, 55–61; Human Life, 624 F.3d at 1002–1019; cf.\n\nSpeechNow.org, 599 F.3d at 696 (where the D.C. Circuit did not consider a ballot\n\nissue election but nevertheless interpreted Buckley as having “upheld . . .\n\n\n                                          19\n\f             Case: 12-14074     Date Filed: 06/14/2013   Page: 20 of 35\n\n\ndisclosure requirements . . . based on a governmental interest in ‘provid[ing] the\n\nelectorate with information’ about the sources of political campaign funds, not just\n\nthe interest in deterring corruption and enforcing anti-corruption measures”\n\n(emphasis added)). The First and the Ninth Circuits have even described the\n\ninformational interest as “compelling” in the ballot issue context. McKee II, 669\n\nF.3d at 40; McKee I, 649 F.3d at 57; Human Life, 624 F.3d at 1005–06.\n\n      Our sister Circuits have offered thoughtful explanations for why disclosure\n\nadvances government interests in the ballot issue context. For example, the\n\nSeventh Circuit explained its belief that:\n\n      Educating voters is at least as important, if not more so, in the context\n      of initiatives and referenda as in candidate elections. In direct\n      democracy, where citizens are responsible for taking positions on\n      some of the day’s most contentious and technical issues, voters act as\n      legislators, while interest groups and individuals advocating a\n      measure’s defeat or passage act as lobbyists.\n\nCtr. for Individual Freedom, 697 F.3d at 480 (quotation marks and alterations\n\nomitted). The Ninth Circuit suggested that disclosure may be more useful in the\n\ncontext of ballot initiatives because:\n\n      Disclosure also gives voters insight into the actual policy\n      ramifications of a ballot measure. Knowing which interested parties\n      back or oppose a ballot measure is critical, especially when one\n      considers that ballot-measure language is typically confusing, and the\n      long-term policy ramifications of the ballot measure are often\n      unknown. At least by knowing who backs or opposes a given\n      initiative, voters will have a pretty good idea of who stands to benefit\n      from the legislation. In addition, mandating disclosure of the\n\n\n                                             20\n\f             Case: 12-14074     Date Filed: 06/14/2013   Page: 21 of 35\n\n\n      financiers of a ballot initiative may prevent the wolf from\n      masquerading in sheep’s clothing.\n\nFamily PAC, 685 F.3d at 808 (quotation marks and citations omitted).\n\n      Nevertheless, Challengers urge us to adopt the Tenth Circuit’s contrary\n\nreasoning in Sampson v. Buescher. In Sampson, the Tenth Circuit recognized that\n\nwith respect to “financial-disclosure requirement[s] in the ballot-issue context,” the\n\nSupreme Court “has spoken favorably of such requirements.” 625 F.3d at 1257.\n\nHowever, the Sampson Court expressed its own view that “[i]t is not obvious that\n\nthere is” a “public interest in knowing who is spending and receiving money to\n\nsupport or oppose a ballot issue” because candidate elections are “ad hominem\n\naffairs” that require voters to “evaluate a human being,” whereas ballot issue\n\nelections simply present a “choice [of] whether to approve or disapprove of\n\ndiscrete governmental action.” Id. at 1256–57. This distinction led the Tenth\n\nCircuit to suggest that nondisclosure would actually be a net positive because it\n\nwould “require the debate to actually be about the merits of the proposition on the\n\nballot,” not the people funding it. Id. at 1257.\n\n      In the same way the Supreme Court in Citizens United rejected the idea that\n\nthe messenger distorts the message, see 558 U.S. at 349–51, 130 S. Ct. at 904–905,\n\nwe reject the notion that knowing who the messenger is distorts the message. The\n\npremise of the antidistortion argument rejected in Citizens United is that\n\ncorporations use the corporate form to accumulate wealth, which allows them to\n                                          21\n\f             Case: 12-14074      Date Filed: 06/14/2013    Page: 22 of 35\n\n\npromote ideas “that have little or no correlation to the public’s support.” Id. at\n\n348, 130 S. Ct. at 903 (citation omitted). The Court disposed of this argument,\n\nsaying that “[p]olitical speech is indispensable to decisionmaking in a democracy,”\n\nwhether “the speech comes from a corporation” or “an individual.” Id. at 349, 130\n\nS. Ct. at 904 (citation omitted). Citizens United does not command states to enact\n\ndisclosure laws, but it does suggest that First Amendment analysis must be wary of\n\nthe argument that less speech is more. The Circuits recognizing a sufficient\n\ninformational interest in the ballot issue context have the better arguments.\n\n      Finally, we note that even in Sampson, the Tenth Circuit did not invalidate a\n\nlaw that required disclosures in the ballot issue context. Instead it held the law\n\nunconstitutional as applied to those plaintiffs because “the governmental interest in\n\nimposing . . . regulations is minimal, if not nonexistent, in light of the small size of\n\nthe contributions.” Sampson, 625 F.3d at 1261. Thus, even Sampson does not, in\n\nthe end, call into question that there could be a “sufficiently important”\n\ninformational interest in requiring disclosure in the ballot issue context.\n\n      Our reading of Supreme Court and persuasive Circuit precedent compels us\n\nto conclude that promoting an informed electorate in a ballot issue election is a\n\nsufficiently important governmental interest to justify the Florida PAC regulations\n\nwe consider here.\n\n              C. Substantially Related to the Government Interest?\n\n\n                                           22\n\f             Case: 12-14074     Date Filed: 06/14/2013    Page: 23 of 35\n\n\n      “Though possibly less rigorous than strict scrutiny, exacting scrutiny is more\n\nthan a rubber stamp.” Minn. Citizens, 692 F.3d at 876 (citations omitted).\n\nExacting scrutiny requires that Florida’s interest in promoting an informed\n\nelectorate be “substantially related” to its PAC regulations. See Citizens United,\n\n558 U.S. at 366–67, 130 S. Ct. at 914. Applying this standard, Florida must justify\n\nthe burden its PAC regulations place on even small groups raising $500 or more by\n\nrequiring that they register as political committees; meet ongoing reporting\n\ndeadlines; and track and report all contributions, no matter how small.\n\n      Challengers argue that the law is not properly tailored because it “imposes\n\nno minimum threshold on disclosure [and] requires the disclosure of a vast amount\n\nof unnecessary information,” which is burdensome, especially for grassroots\n\ngroups. Challengers read precedent from our sister Circuits to favor a finding that\n\nFlorida’s extensive reporting obligations fail exacting scrutiny. Challengers say\n\nthe facts of their case are most analogous to those in Sampson, where the Tenth\n\nCircuit found that similar PAC requirements imposed on a group that raised just\n\n$782.02 failed exacting scrutiny. Challengers also urge us to adopt the reasoning\n\nof Minnesota Citizens to find that “ongoing reporting requirements” along with\n\n“[o]ther requirements, such as requiring a treasurer, segregated funds, and record-\n\nkeeping” are “unrelated” to a professed informational interest or at best\n\n“tangentially related” to that interest. 692 F.3d at 875 n.9.\n\n\n                                          23\n\f             Case: 12-14074     Date Filed: 06/14/2013    Page: 24 of 35\n\n\n      But neither Sampson nor Minnesota Citizens is helpful to us given the nature\n\nof this challenge. As we mentioned in footnote 2, supra, we are not equipped to\n\nevaluate this case as an “as applied” challenge because the record does not tell us\n\nenough about what Challengers are doing. While Challengers have emphasized\n\nthat they are merely a grassroots group of four people who want to spend a modest\n\namount of money in a ballot issue election, they also emphasize their desire to\n\nsolicit contributions. We know little if anything about how much money they\n\nintend to raise or how many people they wish to solicit. We will not speculate\n\nabout their future success as fundraisers. Based on the record we do have, we\n\nconsider this challenge to the Florida PAC regulations to be a facial challenge.\n\nThis means that Challengers cannot prevail unless they can prove “that no set of\n\ncircumstances exists under which the [regulations] would be valid.” United States\n\nv. Salerno, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111891\"><a href=\"/opinion/111891/united-states-v-salerno/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">739</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 745, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111891\"><a href=\"/opinion/111891/united-states-v-salerno/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

They have not\n\ncarried that burden here.\n\n      First, the District Court got it right when it said that the organizational\n\nrequirements in Florida’s PAC regulations do not generally impose an undue\n\nburden on PACs. We agree with the District Court that these regulations “require\n\nlittle more if anything than a prudent person or group would do in these\n\ncircumstances anyway.” Certainly a group wanting to raise and spend money to\n\ninfluence an election likely would: “put someone in charge of the money” and\n\n\n                                          24\n\f             Case: 12-14074     Date Filed: 06/14/2013   Page: 25 of 35\n\n\ndecide where to keep it, see Fla. Stat. § 106.021(1)(a) (requiring that Florida PACs\n\nappoint a treasurer and open a separate bank account); avoid loss or comingling of\n\nfunds by depositing money into that account promptly, see id. § 106.05 (requiring\n\nFlorida PACs to deposit all funds within five business days of receipt); keep good\n\nrecords, see id. § 106.06(1), (3) (requiring Florida PACs to keep updated records);\n\nand, to promote good recordkeeping, disburse funds by check rather than cash, see\n\nid. § 106.11(1)(a) (requiring Florida PACs to disburse funds by check). See\n\nSpeechNow.org, 599 F.3d at 696–98 (holding that similar organizational\n\nrequirements in the federal PAC regulations were not unconstitutionally\n\nburdensome).\n\n      In much the same way, the reporting and registration requirements are not\n\nunduly burdensome. Registration involves submitting a “statement of\n\norganization,” see Fla. Stat. § 106.03(1)(a), which requires filling out four pages of\n\nbasic information. Florida PACs must file periodic reports, see id. § 106.07(3), but\n\nreporting requirements are allowed under our Constitution, and if there is\n\nsomething to report, it would make sense that Challengers would be tracking\n\ncontributions anyway. Florida PACs may be subjected to random audits, see id.\n\n§ 106.22(10), but this again is a small burden—especially where the PAC already\n\ntracks the money it gets in and gives out. Finally, the ongoing reporting\n\nrequirements are not especially burdensome given that Florida law allows PACs to\n\n\n                                          25\n\f               Case: 12-14074       Date Filed: 06/14/2013       Page: 26 of 35\n\n\nterminate more easily than federal PAC requirements allow. Compare Fla.

Albeit in dicta, in Let’s Help Florida. v. McCrary, the Fifth\n\nCircuit endorsed Florida’s then-existing PAC regulations as a suitable alternative\n\nto contribution limits insofar as they helped to inform the electorate about spending\n\nin campaigns. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"377991\"><a href=\"/opinion/377991/lets-help-florida-a-political-committee-and-paul-m-bruun-v-jesse-m/\"><span class=\"volume\">621</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">195</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 200–01 (5th Cir. 1980).5 And at least one court has\n\nremarked that “[i]t is far from clear . . . that even a zero-dollar disclosure threshold\n\nwould succumb to exacting scrutiny.” Family PAC, 685 F.3d at 809 n.7.\n\n       Challengers’ pleas on behalf of a few people pooling a small amount of\n\nmoney ring a bit hollow to the extent that they refuse to foreclose their option for\n\n5\n In Bonner v.

Now Challengers present themselves as intending to spend\n\nonly $600. However, as we noted above, they also acknowledged at oral argument\n\nthat if they received a $1 million donation, they would happily spend it.\n\nChallengers argue that the government may only regulate “established” groups.\n\nHowever, requiring registration by groups who start with as little as $500 also\n\nadvances the government’s informational interests. Indeed, we know that federal\n\nPAC requirements kick in once a group has raised $1000 during a calendar year to\n\ninfluence elections and that these requirements have not been held\n\nunconstitutional. See 2 U.S.C. § 431(4)(a) (2012); Buckley, 424 U.S. at 79–80, 96\n\nS. Ct. at 663–64; cf. SpeechNow.org, 599 F.3d at 696–98 (concerning a PAC\n\nformed by just five individuals).\n\n      Florida also advances its informational interest through a first-dollar\n\ndisclosure threshold because knowing the source of even small donations is\n\ninformative in the aggregate and prevents evasion of disclosure. As the First\n\nCircuit explained in National Organization for Marriage, Inc. v. McKee (McKee\n\nII), “[t]he issue is . . . not whether voters clamor for information about each ‘Hank\n\nJones’ who gave $100 to support an initiative. Rather, the issue is whether the\n\ncumulative effect of disclosure ensures that the electorate will have access to\n\ninformation regarding the driving forces backing and opposing each bill.” 669\n\nF.3d at 41 (quotation marks omitted). To reiterate, we recognize that the\n\n\n                                          27\n\f             Case: 12-14074     Date Filed: 06/14/2013    Page: 28 of 35\n\n\ngovernment’s informational interest may not be greatly advanced by disclosing a\n\nsingle, small contribution. However, disclosure of a plethora of small\n\ncontributions could certainly inform voters about the breadth of support for a group\n\nor a cause. As Florida also points out, the first-dollar threshold prevents a big\n\ndonor from thwarting the State’s informational interest entirely by making a\n\nnumber of small donations.\n\n      Finally, Supreme Court and Circuit precedent has “consistently upheld\n\norganizational and reporting requirements against facial challenges,”\n\nSpeechNow.org, 599 F.3d at 696, in part because crafting such disclosure schemes\n\nis better left to the legislature. While we hold that the disclosure scheme survives\n\nexacting scrutiny, we nevertheless find the discussion in National Organization for\n\nMarriage v. McKee (McKee I) assessing disclosure thresholds to be instructive:\n\n             [Plaintiffs] argue[] that Maine lacks a “sufficiently important”\n      interest in the $100 threshold at which the reporting requirement\n      adheres, and, alternatively, that the threshold lacks a “substantial\n      relation” to a sufficiently important governmental interest.\n      [Plaintiffs’] argument operates from a mistaken premise; we do not\n      review reporting thresholds under the “exacting scrutiny” framework.\n      In Buckley, facing a similar challenge to a $10 threshold for a\n      recordkeeping provision and a $100 reporting threshold, the Supreme\n      Court noted that the choice of where to set such monetary thresholds\n      “is necessarily a judgmental decision, best left in the context of this\n      complex legislation to congressional discretion.”           The Court\n      concluded that, although there was no evidence in the record that\n      Congress had “focused carefully on the appropriate level at which to\n      require recording and disclosure,” and despite the fact that the low\n      thresholds might “discourage participation by some citizens in the\n      political process,” it could not say that “the limits designated are\n                                          28\n\f               Case: 12-14074       Date Filed: 06/14/2013       Page: 29 of 35\n\n\n       wholly without rationality.” The Court thus upheld [the Federal\n       Election Campaign Act’s] recordkeeping and reporting thresholds.\n\n              Following Buckley, we have granted “judicial deference to\n       plausible legislative judgments” as to the appropriate location of a\n       reporting threshold, and have upheld such legislative determinations\n       unless they are “‘wholly without rationality.’”\n\n649 F.3d at 60 (citations omitted); see also Family PAC, 685 F.3d at 811\n\n(“[D]isclosure thresholds . . . are inherently inexact; courts therefore owe\n\nsubstantial deference to legislative judgments fixing these amounts.”). With this in\n\nmind, we cannot say that the PAC regulations are too broad to be substantially\n\nrelated to Florida’s informational interests.\n\n       Third, Challengers’ arguments that Sampson and Minnesota Citizens dictate\n\nan outcome in their favor make little sense given the nature of their appeal. In\n\nSampson, the Tenth Circuit held that application of Colorado PAC requirements to\n\na group of individuals who reported “nonmonetary contributions (signs, a banner,\n\npostcards, and postage) totaling $782.02” for a ballot issue election was\n\nunconstitutional.6 625 F.3d at 1252. The law in that case imposed registration\n\nrequirements on groups raising or spending over $200 and required disclosure for\n\nall donations over $20. Id. at 1249. But in any event, the Tenth Circuit did not\n\n6\n  After the plaintiffs in Sampson received a complaint from the Colorado Secretary of State, they\nraised cash in the amount of $1,426, and paid $1,178.82 of that amount for attorney fees. 625\nF.3d at 1260 & n.5. The ballot issue they opposed was a proposal to annex the neighborhood of\nParker North into the Town of Parker. Id. at 1251. The annexation measure was defeated by a\nvote of 351 to 21 prior to the Tenth Circuit’s ruling in Sampson, id., and there was no indication\nthat the Sampson plaintiffs intended to involve themselves in any future ballot issues. See\ngenerally id. at 1251–54.\n                                                29\n\f              Case: 12-14074       Date Filed: 06/14/2013     Page: 30 of 35\n\n\nfacially strike down that law, explaining that “[w]e do not attempt to draw a bright\n\nline below which a ballot-issue committee cannot be required to report\n\ncontributions and expenditures. The case before us is quite unlike ones involving\n\nthe expenditure of tens of millions of dollars. . . .” Id. at 1261.\n\n       Here, Challengers openly acknowledge they seek to raise more money in the\n\nfuture. This fact distinguishes them from the Sampson plaintiffs, who never\n\nexpressed a desire to continue soliciting contributions. See generally id. at 1251–\n\n54. Thus, our ruling in favor of Florida does not conflict with Sampson, and we\n\nneed not reach the question of whether the statute is constitutional as applied to\n\nfour individuals raising only $600.\n\n       Neither is Minnesota Citizens of assistance to Challengers. Minnesota\n\nCitizens limited its holding to ongoing reporting requirements for associations\n\nspending to influence elections that did not otherwise qualify as PACs under\n\nMinnesota law. See 692 F.3d at 877. The Eighth Circuit left no question that\n\ngroups “whose major purpose is to influence the nomination or election of a\n\ncandidate or to promote or defeat a ballot question,” like Challengers here, would\n\nhave to comply with the state political fund disclosure requirements challenged in\n\nMinnesota Citizens. Id. at 877 n.11 (quotation marks omitted). 7\n\n\n\n7\n The law in Minnesota Citizens was flawed in part because “Minnesota ha[d] not stated any\nplausible reason why continued reporting from nearly all associations, regardless of the\n                                             30\n\f               Case: 12-14074        Date Filed: 06/14/2013       Page: 31 of 35\n\n\n       Challengers are free to petition the legislature to reset the reporting\n\nrequirements for Florida’s PAC regulations, but we decline to do so here.\n\nChallengers’ facial challenge cannot succeed because Florida has adequately\n\ndemonstrated that existing PAC regulations are substantially related to a\n\nsufficiently important government interest.8\n\n      III. FLORIDA’S ADVERTISING DISCLAIMER REQUIREMENT\n\n       Challengers also contest the District Court’s finding that Florida’s\n\nadvertising disclaimer requirement is constitutional in ballot issue elections.\n\nChallengers reference McIntyre, in which the Supreme Court explained that “an\n\nauthor’s decision to remain anonymous, like other decisions concerning omissions\n\nor additions to the content of a publication, is an aspect of the freedom of speech\n\nprotected by the First Amendment.” 514 U.S. at 342, 115 S. Ct. at 1516. In\n\n\n\nassociation’s major purpose, [was] necessary to accomplish [its] interests.” 692 F.3d at 877\n(second emphasis added).\n\n        It is worth noting that this lack of a “major purpose” requirement for regulation was also\nthe way in which the Minnesota Citizens Court distinguished that case from SpeechNow.org. Id.\nat 875 n.10. But in Florida, in contrast to Minnesota, for all elections, including ballot issue\nelections, “[c]orporations regulated by chapter 607 or chapter 617 or other business entities\nformed for purposes other than to support or oppose issues or candidates” are, in fact “not\nconsidered political committees.” Fla. Stat. § 106.011(1)(b). In other words, there is no\nMinnesota Citizens problem with a lack of a “major purpose” test because the law does not\n“impose[] . . . requirements on all associations, regardless of the association’s purpose.” 692 F.3d\nat 875 n.10.\n8\n While we decline to address Florida’s failure to set minimum thresholds on disclosure, we do\nhave concerns about the burdens that the lack of these minimums place on truly small grassroots\ngroups with little experience and little money. However, because this appeal is properly viewed\nas a facial challenge, the issue need not be decided here\n                                                31\n\f             Case: 12-14074     Date Filed: 06/14/2013    Page: 32 of 35\n\n\nCitizens United, however, the Supreme Court expressly rejected the argument that\n\na broadcast advertisement disclaimer requirement was unconstitutional because it\n\n“decrease[d] both the quantity and effectiveness of the group’s speech by forcing it\n\nto devote four seconds of each advertisement to the spoken disclaimer.” 558 U.S.\n\nat 368, 130 S. Ct. at 915. The Court noted, among other things, that it had\n\nexplained in Bellotti that “[i]dentification of the source of advertising may be\n\nrequired as a means of disclosure.” Id. (quoting Bellotti, 435 U.S. at 792 n.32, 98\n\nS. Ct. at 1424 n.32).\n\n      Nonetheless, Challengers argue that McIntyre remains good law, and\n\ndictates the demise of Florida’s disclaimer requirement. Specifically, Challengers\n\nargue that under McIntyre, Florida’s “simple interest in providing voters with\n\nadditional relevant information,” 514 U.S. at 348, 115 S. Ct. at 1520, is not a\n\nsufficient interest to burden speech significantly. Indeed, Challengers argue that\n\nthe burden on their speech is greater than that placed on the pamphleteer in\n\nMcIntyre, as they will probably have to decrease a thirty-second message by six\n\nseconds, resulting in a twenty percent loss in content.\n\n      Challengers say, too, that the District Court’s distinguishing of McIntyre\n\nconflicted with First Amendment principles. First, Challengers argue that the\n\nDistrict Court drew a distinction between handbills and radio ads, which was\n\nwrong because courts “must decline to draw, and then redraw, constitutional lines\n\n\n                                          32\n\f             Case: 12-14074     Date Filed: 06/14/2013    Page: 33 of 35\n\n\nbased on the particular media or technology used to disseminate political speech.”\n\nCitizens United, 558 U.S. at 326, 130 S. Ct. at 891. Second, Challengers argue that\n\nthe District Court’s finding that their collaborative speech did not fall within the\n\nscope of McIntyre’s holding was also error because the First Amendment applies\n\nwith equal force to groups and individuals. Third, Challengers object to the\n\nDistrict Court’s holding that McIntyre did not apply to them because they have no\n\nright to receive anonymous contributions to fund radio ads. Specifically,\n\nChallengers object to this holding because they argue that the Supreme Court has\n\nnever found a state informational interest in the ballot issue context that could\n\nthwart anonymous contributions.\n\n      Each of Challengers’ arguments fails in light of Citizens United, Bellotti,\n\nCitizens Against Rent Control, and McIntyre itself. First, Florida’s disclaimer\n\nrequirement is materially indistinguishable from the disclaimer requirement upheld\n\nin Citizens United. The only differences in the disclaimer requirements before us\n\nand those addressed by the Supreme Court in Citizens United are that we have a\n\nballot issue election before us, and Challengers claim it will take them six seconds\n\nto read the disclaimer as opposed to the four seconds recited in Citizens United.\n\nSee Citizens United, 558 U.S. at 366, 130 S. Ct. at 914. Citizens United upheld\n\nthat disclaimer requirement without any mention of McIntyre. Id. at 366–71, 130\n\nS. Ct. at 914–16. As we have discussed at length, Challengers’ proposed\n\n\n                                          33\n\f             Case: 12-14074      Date Filed: 06/14/2013   Page: 34 of 35\n\n\ndistinction between ballot issue elections and candidate elections is not supported\n\nby precedent and does not compel a departure from Citizens United here.\n\n      Second, a disclaimer requirement was endorsed in the ballot issue context,\n\nalbeit in dicta, in Bellotti. 435 U.S. at 792 n.32, 98 S. Ct. at 1424 n.32\n\n(“Identification of the source of advertising may be required as a means of\n\ndisclosure, so that the people will be able to evaluate the arguments to which they\n\nare being subjected.”). McIntyre did not purport to overrule Bellotti. 514 U.S. at\n\n353–54, 115 S. Ct. at 1522–23.\n\n      Third, McIntyre was a narrow decision that expressly disavowed application\n\nto other forms of media. McIntyre limited its holding to “only written\n\ncommunications and, particularly, leaflets of the kind Mrs. McIntyre distributed.”\n\n514 U.S. at 338 n.3, 115 S. Ct. at 1514 n.3; see also Reed, 130 S. Ct. at 2831 n.4\n\n(Stevens, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment) (explaining the\n\nlimitations of McIntyre). Indeed McIntyre declined to address the constitutionality\n\nof the radio provision of the Ohio statute. 514 U.S. at 338 n.3, 115 S. Ct. at 1514\n\nn.3. As Justice Ginsburg wrote in concurrence:\n\n      In for a calf is not always in for a cow. The Court’s decision finds\n      unnecessary, overintrusive, and inconsistent with American ideals the\n      State’s imposition of a fine on an individual leafleteer who, within her\n      local community, spoke her mind, but sometimes not her name. We\n      do not thereby hold that the State may not in other, larger\n      circumstances require the speaker to disclose its interest by disclosing\n      its identity.\n\n\n                                          34\n\f               Case: 12-14074     Date Filed: 06/14/2013    Page: 35 of 35\n\n\nId. at 358, 115 S. Ct. at 1524 (Ginsburg, J., concurring). McIntyre simply did not\n\nspeak to disclaimers required for radio ads.\n\n         Fourth, the fact that the advertising disclaimer requirement here applies to\n\ngroups that spend money in elections is important. See McIntyre, 514 U.S. at 355,\n\n115 S. Ct. at 1523 (describing campaign finance disclosure requirements as being\n\nless burdensome than other speech regulations). Citizens Against Rent Control,\n\nwhich McIntyre did not purport to overrule, explained, albeit in dicta, that “if it is\n\nthought wise, legislation can outlaw anonymous contributions.” 454 U.S. at 300,\n\n102 S. Ct. at 439. A disclaimer naming the PAC that purchased the ad prevents\n\nanonymous election spending. Challengers argue that even if this is true, the\n\ndisclaimer does not actually advance any interest in disclosure because all funders\n\nhave to do is disclaim the name of the PAC, not a list of individual contributors.\n\nBut we reject that argument given that Florida PACs have to disclose their\n\ncontributors in a public forum. Indeed, that is what Challengers are complaining\n\nabout.\n\n         Therefore, we agree with the District Court that Florida’s advertising\n\ndisclaimer requirement is constitutional.\n\n                                  IV. CONCLUSION\n\n         For each of these reasons, the opinion of the District Court is\n\n         AFFIRMED.\n\n\n                                            35\n\f</pre>",
