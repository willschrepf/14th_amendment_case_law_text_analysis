As explained below,\nwe adhere to our earlier conclusion that W est Virginia may validly designate State\nCollege as the beneficiary of appropriated funds under the Second Morrill Act.\nW e reverse, however, our original conclusion that W est Virginia’s designation of\nState College as a Second Morrill Act beneficiary made that school eligible for\nfunds appropriated pursuant to 7 U .S.C . §§ 3221, 3222, 3223 and similar statutes.\n(Follow ing the usage o f Agriculture, we shall refer to these statutes collectively as\nthe “ 1890 derivative statutes ”) Rather, we conclude that State College is not eli­\ngible for funds under the 1890 derivative statutes.\n\n                                                                              I.\n                              AN OVERVIEW OF THE LEGAL HISTORY\n                              OF THE LAND-GRANT COLLEGE SYSTEM\n\n   A know ledge o f the legal history of the land-grant college system is essential to\ninterpreting the Second Morrill A ct and the 1890 derivative statutes.

The land-grant college system began in 1862 with the\nFirst Morrill Act, ch. 130, 12 Stat. 503 (1862) (“First Morrill Act”)-2 That statute\nprovided the states with grants of public land or equivalent land scrip. Id. § 1, 12\nStat. at 503. The states that chose to “take and claim the benefit” o f the First M or­\nrill Act were required to invest the funds derived from the sale o f the land or land\nscrip in such fashion that the principal would “remain forever undiminished.” Id.\n§ 4, 12 Stat. at 504. The states were further required to devote the interest gener­\nated by such funds exclusively to the “endowment, support, and maintenance of at\nleast one college where the leading object shall be . . . to teach such branches of\n\n\n    2   For accounts o f the history o f the college land-grant system , see Joseph B Edm ond, The M agnificent\nC harter The O rigin a n d Role o j the M orrill L and-G ranl C olleges a n d U niversities (1978); Allan N evins,\nThe State U niversities a n d D em ocracy (1962), Edw ard D Eddy, Colleges j o r O ur L a n d and Tim e: The\nLand-G rant Idea in A m erican Education (1957), and Earle D.

The states were\nrequired to express acceptance of the land grant (or land scrip) through their legis­\nlatures.3 Once a state had accepted, it would still lose its benefit unless it provided\n“within five years . . . not less than one college” o f the prescribed kind. Id. § 5, 12\nStat. at 504.\n    The H atch Act. The A ct of M ar. 2, 1887, ch. 314, 24 Stat. 440 (codified as\namended at 7 U.S.C. §§ 361a-390d) authorized appropriations for agricultural re­\nsearch at experim ent stations under the direction either o f a college “established, or\nwhich may hereafter be established, in accordance with the provisions of [the First\nMorrill A ct]” or an independent station established by a state. See id. §§ 1 ,2 , 8,\n24 Stat. at 440-42. Unlike the First M orrill Act, the Hatch Act provided for pay­\nments by the federal government directly to the beneficiary institutions, although\nthe appropriations were still said to be “to each State.” Id. § 5, 24 Stat. at 441. In\nstates having tw o colleges established under the First Morrill Act, the funds were\nto be divided equally unless the state’s legislature directed otherwise. See id. § 1,\n24 Stat. at 440.\n    The S econ d M orrill A ct. The Second M orrill Act provided an annual appropri­\nation o f funds “to each State .. . for the more complete endowment and m ainten­\nance o f colleges for the benefit o f agriculture and the mechanic arts now estab­\nlished, or which may be hereafter established, in accordance with [the provisions of\nthe First M orrill A ct].” § 1, 26 Stat. at 417-18. The funds so appropriated were to\nbe paid to the state treasurer “designated by the laws of such State . . . to receive\nthe sam e” and then “immediately [paid] over . . . to the treasurers of the respective\ncolleges . . . entitled to receive the sam e.” Id. § 2, 26 Stat. at 418. The use of the\nfunds was restricted to “instruction in agriculture, the mechanic arts, the English\nlanguage and the various branches o f mathematical, physical, natural and economic\nscience, with special reference to their applications in the industries of life, and to\nthe facilities for such instruction.” Id. § 1, 26 Stat. at 418.\n   The Second Morrill A ct also forbade paym ent of funds appropriated under the\nAct to colleges “where a distinction of race or color is made in the admission of\nstudents.” Id. This prohibition, however, was qualified by a proviso deeming the\nestablishm ent o f a separate college for each race to be sufficient compliance if the\nfunds were divided “equitably” betw een the tw o schools. Id. A second proviso\ndescribed the m echanics o f “separate but equal” compliance in greater detail:\n\n              That in any State in which there has been one college established\n           in pursuance o f the [First M orrill Act], and also in which an educa­\n           tional institution o f like character has been established, or may be\n           hereafter established, and is now aided by such State from its own\n\n    1 T h e deadline for acceptance was two y e ars from the d ate o f the First M orrill A c t's enactm ent.

The Act of May 8, 1914, ch. 79, 38 Stat. 372 (codified as\namended at 7 U.S.C. §§ 341-349) established and funded agricultural extension\nservices “in connection with the college or colleges in each State now receiving, or\nwhich may hereafter receive, the benefits of the [First Morrill Act] . . . and the\n[Second Morrill Act].” Id. § 1, 38 Stat. at 372-73. As with the Second M orrill\nAct, the appropriations were payable to the States for disbursement. Id. § 4, 38\nStat. at 374. States having more than one eligible college were permitted to divide\nthe appropriation as the legislature saw fit. Id. § I, 38 Stat. at 373.\n\n                                                       B.\n\n    In 1863, the W est Virginia Legislature assented to the provisions of the First\nMorrill Act. 1863 W. Va. Acts ch. 56. After passage of the Second Morrill Act,\nthe W est Virginia Legislature assented to its terms, designated W est Virginia U ni­\nversity as the beneficiary of the funds available under the First Morrill Act, and\nestablished State College as the beneficiary o f a portion of the funds for the in­\nstruction of “colored” students. 1891 W. Va. Acts ch. 65, § l.4 W est Virginia was\namong a group o f seventeen states that ultimately complied with the Second M or­\nrill A ct’s eligibility requirements by establishing a racially segregated land-grant\ncollege for black students.5 The class of institutions thus established or designated\nby these seventeen states are commonly known as the 1890 colleges. The colleges\nin these same' states that restricted enrollment to white students, as well as the\n\n\n   4 Slate C ollege w as chartered as “The West V irginia C olored Institute.\" A m erican U niversities and C ol-\nleges 1822 (14th ed. 1992) In 1915, its nam e was changed to “T he W est V irginia C ollegiate Institute ” Id\nat 1823.

S ee Knight, 787 F. Supp. at 1145 n.44, 1167-68.\n   In m ost states, there is only a single land-grant college, which receives all of the\nfunds distributed to the state under the four statutes discussed in the preceding sub­\npart. Even in states having both an 1862 and an 1890 college, the experiment sta­\ntion and extension service funded under the Hatch and Smith-Lever Acts,\nrespectively, are alm ost uniformly located at the 1862 college, which consequently\nreceives all of the appropriations provided pursuant to those two Acts. See id. at\n1167-68.6 Furtherm ore, according to Agriculture, no 1890 college receives First\nMorrill Act funds.7 Consequently, w ith respect to the four statutes outlined above,\nthe only funds that the 1890 colleges receive are a share o f the Second Morrill Act\nappropriation.8 Thus, except as altered by the 1890 derivative statutes, see infra\nPart I.C, the pattern of unequal distribution o f federal funds (and o f state funds as\nwell) has rem ained little changed from the inception of the 1890 colleges.9 In the\nmid-1950s, the Suprem e Court held that the system of racially “separate but equal”\nstate education (including higher education) was unconstitutional.10 The end of\nde ju r e racial segregation raised the question whether there was a necessity for the\ncontinued participation of the 1890 colleges in the land-grant system. See Eddy,\nsupra note 2, at 265-66 (1957). T hus, West Virginia complied with the Supreme\nC ourt’s decisions by integrating both its 1862 college, W est Virginia University,\nand its 1890 college, State College, and by consolidating the land-grant function in\nW est V irginia University. State C ollege was removed from the land-grant system.\nSee 1957 W. Va. Acts ch. 72, John C. Harlan, H istory o f West Virginia State C ol­\nlege 1 8 9 1 -1 9 6 5 , at 101-04 (1968).

ISSUES F O R R E C O N S ID E R A T IO N\n\n    In 1991, W est Virginia enacted a law renewing its assent to the provisions of\nthe Second M orrill Act and designating State College as the sole beneficiary of\nfederal appropriations available under that Act. 1991 W. Va. Acts ch. 6 0 .13 As\ndiscussed above, State College was formerly an 1890 college. Its status as a land-\ngrant college was withdrawn in 1957 as part of West V irginia’s effort to desegre­\ngate its higher education system. Thus, the enactment in 1991 represents an at­\ntempt to restore State College’s status after a hiatus of thirty-four years.\n    By current standards, the annual appropriation of $50,000 available to each\nstate under the Second Morrill Act is not substantial. Request for Reconsideration,\nApp. at 8-34. Significantly more funding is available, however, under the 1890\nderivative statutes. West Virginia seeks funding for State College under both the\nSecond Morrill Act and the 1890 derivative statutes.14\n   Agriculture contends that State College is not eligible for funding under either\nthe Second Morrill Act or the 1890 derivative statutes.13 Agriculture maintains\nthat an institution may not receive Second Morrill Act appropriations unless it also\nreceives funds under the First Morrill Act. Because W est Virginia has not desig­\nnated State College to receive funds under the First Morrill Act, (and State College\ndoes not in fact receive funds under that Act), Agriculture concludes that State\nCollege may not be designated to receive appropriations under the Second Morrill\nAct.\n\n\n\n    '■ T he authorizations for appropriations contained in 7 U S C.

Nevertheless, Agriculture main­\ntains that because State College w as withdrawn from the land-grant system, the\nonly way to restore it is by the usual route requiring receipt of benefits under the\nFirst M orrill Act. Agriculture argues that the exception to that requirement — the\nracial segregation proviso — is unconstitutional, and hence, no longer available to\nW est V irginia.16\n   Concerning State College’s eligibility for funding under the 1890 derivative\nstatutes, A griculture contends that if State College fails to qualify for appropria­\ntions under the Second Morrill Act, it may not take advantage of the 1890 deriva­\ntive statutes, which condition funding upon an institution’s eligibility for\nappropriations under the Second M orrill Act. In addition, Agriculture denies that\nState College could qualify for funding under the 1890 derivative statutes even if it\nwere eligible to receive appropriations under the Second Morrill Act. It notes that\nthe class of colleges eligible for Second Morrill Act appropriations includes all the\n1862 colleges that receive appropriations under the First and Second Morrill Acts.\nBut, A griculture contends, Congress did not intend to benefit every such school.\nRather, C ongress intended to benefit only a specific group of sixteen historically\nblack colleges in the land-grant system at the time that the 1890 derivative statutes\nwere enacted (and also the historically black Tuskegee University, which is not a\nland-grant college). Agriculture invokes legislative history on this point, which it\nurges must guide the interpretation of the statutory language. Thus, in A gricul­\nture’s view, even assum ing that State College could now be designated to receive\nFirst M orrill Act funds, it nevertheless could not qualify for funding under the\n1890 derivative statutes, because it is not among the schools that Congress in­\ntended to benefit.\n   This O ffice’s original opinion (superseded by this one) agreed with W est V ir­\nginia. W e concluded that a state m ay designate an institution for Second Morrill\nAct appropriations without designating it for First Morrill Act funds if the school\nmeets the educational requirements of the First Morrill Act and the non­\ndiscrim ination requirem ent of the Second M orrill Act.

It ad­\nvances certain textual arguments concerning the Second M om ll Act to bolster its\nreading of that Act. With respect to the 1890 derivative statutes, Agriculture in­\nsists that we must avoid a result that is both absurd in itself and at odds with clear\nlegislative history. Agriculture emphasizes that a decision that State College may\nshare in funding under the 1890 derivative statutes carries potentially broad impli­\ncations. The language of these statutes seemingly encompasses a ll schools eligible\nto receive Second Morrill Act appropriations, including the 1862 institutions.\nThus, says Agriculture, “[i]f your opinion were adopted, a minimum of 74 institu­\ntions [i.e., all land-grant colleges and Tuskegee University] would become eligible\nfor the [funding] that is now distributed among 17 institutions [i.e., only the 1890\ncolleges and Tuskegee University].” Request for Reconsideration at 7 Obviously,\nthis outcome would considerably lessen the share of funds given to the 1890 col­\nleges. According to Agriculture, this outcome is absurd because the very purpose\nof the 1890 derivative statutes, as shown by the legislative history, was to remedy a\nhistorical inequity: the states that had maintained racially segregated systems had\ngiven almost all land-grant funding to their 1862 colleges while excluding the 1890\ncolleges from the federal bounty. Consequently, Agriculture concludes that the\n1890 derivative statutes must be read to authorize appropriations only for the bene­\nfit of the 1890 colleges.\n\n                               III.\n              STATE COLLEGE’S ELIGIBILITY FOR FUNDS\n               UNDER THE 1890 DERIVATIVE STATUTES\n\n   On reconsideration, we conclude that the 1890 derivative statutes provide ap­\npropriations only for the benefit of the 1890 colleges. Furthermore, we find that\nState College is not among the intended beneficiaries. Because we think that State\nCollege’s eligibility for appropriations under the Second M om ll A ct does not con­\ntrol its eligibility for appropriations under the 1890 derivative statutes, we leave\nconsideration of the Second Morrill Act to Part IV, infra.\n\n                                               A.\n\n   Our analysis of the 1890 derivative statutes is guided by a longstanding rule of\nconstruction very recently reiterated by a unanimous Supreme Court:\n\n       Over and over we have stressed that “[i]n expounding a statute, we\n       must not be guided by a single sentence or mem ber of a sentence,\n       but look to the provisions of the whole law, and to its object and\n\n\n                                              193\n\f                            Opinions o f th e O ffice o f L e g a l Counsel\n\n\n        policy.” U nited States v.

(consulting title).\n    It is undisputed that, from the tim e of the Second Morrill A ct’s enactment in\n1890 to this day, the colleges eligible to receive funds under that Act have included\nboth the 1862 colleges and the 1890 colleges. Indeed, as indicated above, the Sec­\nond M orrill Act was passed in large part for the specific benefit o f the 1862 col­\nleges. On their face, however, the 1890 derivative statutes fail to distinguish\nbetween the class o f colleges eligible for Second Morrill A ct funds, including both\nthe 1862 colleges and the 1890 colleges, and the more restricted class of 1890\ncolleges. For example, although N A R E T § 1444 is entitled “Extension at 1890\nLand-G rant Colleges,” 91 Stat. at 1007, the body of § 1444 creates a permanent\nauthorization for Congress “to . . . appropriate[] annually such sums as Congress\nmay determ ine necessary to support continuing agricultural and forestry extension\nat co lleg e s elig ib le to receive fu n d s under the [ the S econ d M o rrill A ct].” Id.\n(em phasis added). Similarly, NARET § 1445 is entitled “Agricultural Research at\n1890 Land-G rant Colleges;” the substantive text of § 1445, however, authorizes\nannual appropriations o f “such sum s as Congress may determine necessary to sup­\nport continuing agricultural research at colleges eligible to receive fu n d s under the\n[S eco n d M o rrill A c t].” 91 Stat. at 1009 (em phasis added). Thus, were we to con­\nsider the substantive provisions of the 1890 derivative statutes alone, without ref­\nerence to the titles, the legislative history, the other portions of the statutory text, or\nthe structure and purpose of the overall statutory scheme for the land-grant col­\nleges, we would be forced to conclude that those provisions benefited 1862 and\n1890 colleges alike.\n    Such a conclusion would, however, be at odds with the unmistakable purpose of\nthe 1890 derivative statutes. That purpose is to rectify the historical imbalance of\nfunding between the 1862 and 1890 colleges — an imbalance that originated in\nracial segregation.

How­\n       ever, it must be emphasized that very few of the 1890 schools . . .\n       receive any state funding, and Federal funding for agricultural re­\n       search, which has not been on a permanent basis but rather on a\n       grants basis, has only been available to the 1890’s . . . since 1967.\n       Permanent funding for agricultural research has been available to\n       the state agricultural experim ent stations of the 1862 institutions\n       since 1887.\n\nH.R. Rep. No. 95-348, at 122 (1977) (“House R eport”).\n   During hearings concerning § 1433 of the Agriculture and Food Act o f 1981,\nthe need for the bill was put as follows:\n\n          This Congress has been supporting agricultural research for a\n       long time. As far back as 1862, Congress set up the land grant col­\n       lege system. Over the years, the institutions created under the 1862\n       Act have been helped to build research programs which are the envy\n       of the world.\n\n          Later, in 1890, Congress passed a second Morrill Act which was\n       designed specifically to support black land grant institutions. . . .\n          These institutions, which were originally created under the old\n       separate-but-equal doctrine, have had to make do with inadequate\n       state funding and little or no federal funding in the past for research,\n       teaching and extension. Their achievements with limited resources\n       have been tremendous, but . . . there is a limit to the number of\n       bricks a man can make without straw. The 17 institutions we are\n       dealing with need help now to bring their food and agricultural re­\n       search facilities up to acceptable levels.\n\n         The 1890 colleges need, simply, to catch up. That is what H.R.\n       1309 is designed to help them do.\n\n1890 Land-G rant C olleges F acilities: H earings on H.R. 1309 B efore the Sub-\ncomm. on D epartm ent O perations, Research, and Foreign A griculture o f the\nH ouse Comm, on Agriculture, 97th Cong. 8-9 (1981) (“House H earing” ) (prepared\nstatement of Rep. de la Garza); see also id. at 13-17 (prepared statem ent o f Rep.\nFord) (contrasting historically “meager funding” by the states and the federal gov­\nernment for the 1890 colleges with the “royal treatment” provided for the 1862\ncolleges, and asserting that H.R. 1309 would provide ‘“ catch-up” ’ funds to the\n1890 colleges “for years o f past neglect”).\n\n                                              195\n\f                                        Opinions o f th e Office o f L e g a l C ounsel\n\n\n    In drafting the 1890 derivative statutes to benefit the 1890 colleges, however,\nCongress conflated two distinct classes: colleges eligible to receive Second M or­\nrill Act funds, and the 1890 colleges. Thus, with respect to NARET §§ 1444 and\n 1445, both the Conference and the House Reports use the description “colleges\neligible to receive funds under the [Second M orrill A ct]” interchangeably with\n“ 1890 institutions.” See, e.g., S. Conf. Rep. No. 95-418, at 225-28 (1977)\n(“Conference R eport”); House R eport at 123-24. In fact, of course, the terms are\nnot interchangeable, because all o f the 1862 colleges, as well as the 1890 colleges,\nreceive Second M orrill A ct funds. Congress also understood the class o f 1890\ncolleges to consist wholly of sixteen identified, historically black schools. See,\ne.g., H.R. Rep. No. 97-151, at 3 (1981) (enum erating the sixteen 1890 colleges).17\n    It appears that Congress intended to fund only the sixteen identified 1890 col­\nleges, and mistakenly assumed that only they w ere eligible for Second Morrill Act\nfunds. The Conference and House Reports specifically contrast the 1890 colleges\nwith the 1862 colleges, thus showing that Congress understood the distinction be­\ntween the two classes, even though it supposed that only the former class was eli­\ngible for Second M orrill Act appropriations. S ee Conference Report at 225-27;\nHouse Report at 122. Thus, the legislative history suggests that NARET §§ 1444\nand 1445 were intended to authorize appropriations only for the 1890 colleges.18\n    References to unenacted materials evidencing C ongress’s intent would not alone\nbe sufficient to control the enacted language o f N A RET §§ 1444 and 1445, even if\nthose m aterials dem onstrated that th e statutory language Congress adopted derived\nfrom a m istake o f fact or law.

An\ninterpretation of NARET §§ 1444 and 1445 that takes those provisions to refer\nonly to the 1890 colleges is the only reading of the statute that can account for the\n“full text, language[,] . . . structure, and subject m atter.” N ational Bank o f O r., 508\nU.S. at 455.\n   As detailed below, this understanding o f the 1890 derivative statutes helps ex­\nplain certain provisions in those enactments that otherwise would remain anoma­\nlous. Although these anomalies do not necessarily rise to the level of intrinsic\ntextual ambiguity, nor do they create patently absurd results, our ability to explain\nthem provides some assurance that our use of legislative history has contributed to\na proper understanding of the text.19\n   The first anomaly has to do with the computation o f funding authorized by NA­\nRET §§ 1444(a) and 1445(a). In § 1444(a), it is keyed to a percentage of the\namount of funds appropriated for extension work under the Smith-Lever Act. See\n91 Stat. at 1007. Likewise, in § 1445(a), research funds are authorized in an\namount based upon a percentage of the level of funds appropriated for agricultural\nresearch under the Hatch Act. See id. at 1009. As noted above, however, every\nstate has given its Smith-Lever and Hatch Act funds exclusively to its 1862 college\nand experiment stations controlled exclusively by those schools (except Arkansas,\nwhich has an independent experim ent station). If §§ 1444 and 1445 are designed\nto rectify the states’ historic discrimination between the 1862 and 1890 colleges,\nthese funding mechanisms would have a discernible purpose. But if §§ 1444 and\n 1445 are read to benefit the 1862 colleges as well as the 1890 colleges, then Con­\ngress would have created a (much smaller) duplicate mechanism to fund research\nand extension at colleges already receiving appropriations for these purposes under\nthe Smith-Lever Act and the Hatch Act. It also seems unlikely that when Congress\nprovided “catch up” funds for the 1890 colleges, it did so by appropriating still\nmore funds for the 1862 colleges already acknowledged to be receiving the lion’s\nshare of state and federal land-grant funding. It is more consonant with the statu­\n\n\n    19    S ee Retch i’ G reat Lakes Indian Fish a n d W tldhje C iim m 'n, 4 F 3d 4 90 (7th C ir 1993) T here, the\ncourt suggested that one may “ seek m eaning beneath the sem antic level not only w hen there is an ‘intrinsic'\nam biguity      but also w hen there is an ‘ex trin sic ’ one, that is, w hen doubt that the literal m eaning is the\ncorrect one arises only w hen one know s som ething ab o u t the concrete activities         intended to [be] regu-\nlate[d].” Id. at 494.

Sub­\nsection (c) provides: “The State director o f the cooperative extension service and\nthe adm inistrative head for extension at the eligible institution in each State where\nan eligible institution is located shall jointly develop, by mutual agreement, a com­\nprehensive program of extension for such State.” 91 Stat. at 1008. As mentioned,\nevery state has an extension service created under the Smith-Lever Act and at­\ntached to that state’s 1862 college. This subsection, however, contemplates that\nnot every state has an eligible institution (making it necessary to include the phrase\n“where an eligible institution is located”). It also presupposes a distinction be­\ntween the statew ide extension program and the extension program at an eligible\ninstitution, whose administrative heads are instructed to work “jointly.” These\npresum ptions do not make sense if § 1444 is read to include the 1862 colleges,\nwhich have extension programs. They make sense, however, if § 1444 is read to\nestablish a new extension program for the exclusive benefit of the 1890 colleges,\nwhich are found only in sixteen states and do not have an extension program under\nthe Sm ith-Lever Act. Indeed, the Conference Report confirms that the purpose of\nsubsection (c) is to coordinate the extension program newly created under § 1444\nat each 1890 college with the existing extension program at the 1862 college lo­\ncated in the same state. Conference Report at 226-27; see also House Report at\n122 (“ [T]he com m ittee wishes to stress its desire that the agricultural research con­\nducted at the 1890’s . . . and the involved 1862 institutions not be duplicative.”).\n   A third anom aly appears in § 1433(a) o f the A griculture and Food Act o f 1981,\nwhich is opaque unless read to benefit only the 1890 colleges. It states:\n\n            It is hereby declared to be the intent of Congress to assist the in­\n       stitutions eligible to receive funds under the [Second M om ll Act]\n       . . . in the acquisition and improvement o f research facilities and\n       equipm ent so that eligible institutions may participate fully with the\n       State agricultural experiment stations in a balanced attack on the re­\n       search needs of the people o f their States.\n\n95 Stat. at 1312. As has been indicated, no state has more than one agricultural\nexperim ent station, and all (but one) of these are under the control of an 1862 col­\nlege that receives Second Morrill Act benefits. Section 1433(a) cannot refer to\nboth the 1862 and 1890 colleges because that would mean that the 1862 colleges in\nstates w ithout 1890 colleges are to “participate fully” with them selves in perform­\ning agricultural research. Thus, the text makes sense only if the eligible institutions\nare understood as a class separate from the existing state agricultural experiment\nstations. Properly construed, the section reflects once again the congressional pur­\n\n                                              198\n\f                  Reconsideration o f P rior Opinion C oncerning L and-C ranl C olleges\n\n\npose o f providing additional funding to the 1890 colleges to restore “balance[]” in\nthe allocation of federal funds between the 1862 and 1890 colleges, thus rectifying\na perceived imbalance that had prevented the 1890 colleges from “participat[ing]\nfully” in agricultural research.\n    The very same analysis applies to the language of § 1416(a) o f the Food Secu­\nrity Act of 1985, 99 Stat. at 1549, setting forth a declaration of congressional intent\nin authorizing grants to upgrade cooperative extension facilities. The title of\n§ 1416, moreover, is “Grants to upgrade 1890 land-grant college extension facili­\nties.” Id.\n    In sum, a number of anomalies disappear when the 1890 derivative statutes are\nread as benefiting solely the 1890 colleges. There are, moreover, aspects of the\n 1890 derivative statutes that affirmatively support such a reading. First, it is sig­\nnificant that all of the 1890 derivative statutes allocate funds not to the states, as is\ntrue of the earlier land-grant statutes, but directly to the eligible institutions.20 The\nlegislative history indicates that Congress understood this structure as a departure\nfrom prior practice with respect to the 1862 colleges. See Conference Report at\n226 (rejecting a Senate bill provision that would have provided that the states “act\nas intermediaries with respect to the extension programs between the 1890 institu­\ntions and the Secretary of Agriculture in the same manner as currently exists for\n 1862 institutions” in favor of a House am endm ent that provided for a direct rela­\ntionship between the 1890 institutions and the Secretary). This difference in\nstructure is consistent with the expressed purpose of the 1890 derivative statutes to\nrectify an imbalance of funding brought about largely by the discriminatory action\nof the states in their allocation of federal (and state) funds.\n    Second, as noted above, the titles of most o f the 1890 derivative statutes ex­\npressly refer to funding for the 1890 colleges. See, e.g., NARET § 1444, 91 Stat.\nat 1007 (“Extension at 1890 land-grant colleges”); FACT Act § 1612(b), 104 Stat.\nat 3722 (“Grants to upgrade agricultural and food sciences facilities at 1890 land-\ngrant colleges”). The titles provide strong textual evidence that the 1890 deriva­\ntive statutes are designed to benefit only the 1890 colleges.\n    Finally, the sums appropriated pursuant to the 1890 derivative statutes are much\nsmaller than those appropriated pursuant to the earlier land-grant statutes. For ex­\nample, the FY 94 Appropriation provides the 1862 colleges and experiment sta­\ntions with $272,582,000 in Smith-Lever Act funding for extension work and\n$171,304,000 in Hatch Act funding for research. In contrast, it provides only\n$25,472,000 for extension work pursuant to NARET § 1444 and $28,157,000 for\nresearch pursuant to NARET § 1445. See 107 Stat. at 1051, 1053. In each case, if\nthe N A RET funds were divided over seventy-four schools (the combined total o f\nthe 1862 and 1890 colleges and Tuskegee University), no school would derive\n\n\n   20    A lthough the H atch A ct provides for disbursem ent o f funds by the federal governm ent directly to the\nbeneficiaries, the states effectively each choose the beneficiary, and the appropriation is said to be '“to each\nState ” 24 Slat, at 441\n\n                                                     199\n\f                                      Opinions o f the O ffice o f L egal Counsel\n\n\nmuch benefit from its share of funds and the am ount received by an 1862 college\nwould be m inuscule relative to the funds that each such college will receive for\nessentially the sam e purposes pursuant to the Sm ith-Lever and Hatch Acts. These\ncircum stances suggest that the congressional intent was not to divide the 1890 de­\nrivative funds am ong all the land-grant colleges, but only among the 1890 colleges.\nSee R ose v. R ose, 481 U.S. 619, 630-31 (1987) (em ploying division o f appropria­\ntions am ong beneficiaries to determine meaning o f statute).\n   O ur exam ination o f the FACT A ct § 1612, 104 Stat. at 3721, as well as its leg­\nislative history, confirm s that Congress continued to equate the colleges eligible to\nreceive benefits under the Second M orrill Act with the 1890 colleges. See, e.g.,\nH.R. C onf. Rep. No. 101-916, at 1047-48 (1990). The same is true o f the FY 94\nAppropriation, 107 Stat. at 1051-53, and its legislative history. See, e.g., H.R.\nRep. No. 103-153, at 29, 40 (1993); S. Rep. N o. 103-102, at 29, 40-1 (1993).\nThus, the class of intended beneficiaries has not changed.\n\n                                                             B.\n\n   Having concluded that Congress intended the phrase “eligible to receive funds\n[under the Second M orrill Act]” to refer solely to the 1890 colleges, we must de­\ntermine w hether State College falls within this class. Congress understood this\nclass to encom pass a specific list o f sixteen identified schools (to which was added\nthe Tuskegee Institute). See, e.g., H.R. Rep. No. 97-151, at 3 (1981) (listing the\n1890 colleges). Because State College was not among the identified schools, it\nwould seem that it may not share in 1890 derivative funding.\n   C ongress’s list of 1890 colleges, moreover, likely was drawn from the general\nunderstanding of the term “ 1890 college” as a category encompassing historically\nblack land-grant colleges with a com m on genesis in the Second Morrill Act.\nOriginally, State College was commonly understood to be among this group. Be­\ncause State College was withdrawn from the land-grant system, however, it lost its\nstanding as an 1890 college. Thus, when the 1890 derivative statutes were passed,\nthis term was no longer commonly understood to include State College.21 State\nCollege, therefore, was not (and could not have been) among the intended benefi­\nciaries of those statutes.\n   It m ight be argued nonetheless that W est V irginia’s putative restoration of State\nCollege to the land-grant system also restored it to the category of 1890 colleges.22\nW est V irginia took this action in 1991, prior to the 1993 enactment o f the FY 94\n\n\n     21 C om pare, e.g , E ddy, su p ra noie 2, at 2 5 8 -5 9 (1 9 5 7 ) (State C ollege included am ong the 1890 colleges)\nwith, e         E d m o n d , su p ra note 2, at 63 (1978) (State C ollege ab sen t from list o f the 1890 colleges otherw ise\ndraw n from E d d y 's book).\n    22 T h is m ay be the b asis o f W est V irg in ia G o v ern o r C a p e rto n 's suggestion that W est V irginia's\n* re d e sig n a tio n ” o f State C ollege under the S eco n d M orrill A ct m akes it eligible for 1890 derivative funding\nSee L e tte r for E dw ard M adigan, Secretary o f A g ricu ltu re, D epartm ent of A griculture, from G aston Caperton,\nG o v ern o r o f W est V irg in ia at 2 (A ug. 9, 1991).\n\n                                                            200\n\f                   Reconsideration o f Prior Opinion C oncerning L and-G rant C olleges\n\n\nAppropriation. Therefore, we cannot a p rio ri exclude the possibility that, at the\ntime the FY 94 Appropriation was enacted, either Congress believed that State\nCollege was once again an 1890 college or, in a more general sense, that “ 1890\ncollege” as a term of art once again included State College. The A ppropriation’s\nlegislative history, however, does not offer any discussion as to what schools Con­\ngress thought were among the 1890 colleges.23 Furthermore, the general usage\ndoes not appear to have changed.24 In light o f the previous congressional belief (as\nwell as the general understanding among those using the term) that State College\nwas not one of the 1890 colleges, this silence is tantamount to not recognizing\nState College’s restoration as an 1890 college.25 Consequently, we conclude that\nthe reference to 1890 colleges in the FY 94 Appropriation does not include State\nCollege.

Agriculture construes this general language to condi­\ntion the eligibility of a college to receive funds under the Second Morrill Act upon\nits designation as a recipient of First Morrill Act funds. In our original opinion, we\nreached the opposite conclusion, construing this language to impose only a re­\nquirement that a college conform to the educational requirements of the First M or­\nrill Act (and the non-discrimination requirement in the Second Morrill Act).\n    In light of our conclusions in Part III, supra, this issue does not have any bear­\ning on the question of whether State College (or any college) may qualify for\n\n\n    21 See, e g , H R Rep No. 103-153, at 29, 40, S Rep.

M oreover, we note that there are no\nrestrictions on the division of funds between schools eligible for First Morrill Act\nfunds. See infra note 27 and accompanying text. Therefore, as Agriculture has\nacknow ledged, W est Virginia “could meet the threshold of 1862 designation by\ngiving State College one dollar of 1862 monies per year.” Request for Reconsid­\neration at 10. Furtherm ore, as indicated earlier, the annual appropriation for each\nstate under the Second Morrill Act is not large by today’s standards. These con­\nsiderations substantially reduce the practical importance of any decision on this\nissue. N onetheless, since State C ollege’s eligibility for Second Morrill Act funding\nremains in dispute, we will reconsider the issue. W e conclude that, although the\nquestion is a close one, the balance o f the evidence favors our original view.\n   T he legislative history of the Second M orrill Act suggests that Congress be­\nlieved that the appropriated funds would in fact be used to supplement the funds\navailable to the land-grant colleges and departments that had been established by\nthe states pursuant to the First M orrill Act.26 Furtherm ore, the development o f the\nland-grant system has indeed followed this course. Except for the 1890 colleges,\nonly colleges receiving the benefits o f the First M orrill A ct have been designated\nby their respective states to receive appropriations under the Second Morrill Act.\nNonetheless, in our original opinion, we took the view that the statutory language\ndid not specifically mandate that the states allocate Second Morrill A ct funds only\nto colleges already endow ed with F irst Morrill A ct funds if a state (such as W est\nVirginia) wished to do otherwise.\n   In support o f our original construction of the Second Morrill Act, these kinds of\nconsiderations may be cited: the statutory scheme, the contrast with the language\nof a sim ilar statute, the longstanding practice o f those administering the Act, and\njudicial construction of it. First, the existence o f such a specific limitation seems at\nodds with the statutory scheme, w hich vests the states with very broad power to\nallocate Second Morrill Act appropriations to institutions o f their choosing. Thus,\nthe Suprem e Court in Wyoming ex rel. Wyoming Agric. C ollege v. Irvine, 206 U.S.\n278, 284 (1907), sum m arized the plenary nature o f the states’ power over First and\nSecond M orrill Act funds as follows: “the fund and its interest [under the First\nM orrill Act] and the annual appropriations [under the Second Morrill Act] are the\nproperty o f the State and not of any institution within it.”27 This statutory scheme\nrenders the proposed limitation virtually superfluous because, as Agriculture con-\n\n\n   26 See, e.g , S R ep N o. 51 - 1028, at I -2 (1 8 9 0 ); H R.

The Smith-Lever Act follows the struc­\nture of the Second M orrill Act in giving appropriated funds to the states. 38 Stat.\nat 373. It expressly provides, however, that the states must allocate the appropri­\nated funds for extension work at “the college or colleges in each State now receiv­\ning, or which may hereafter receive, the benefits of the [First Morrill Act] . .. and\nof the [Second Morrill Act].” Id. Thus, Congress knew how to impose this type of\nrequirement in clear language when it wished to do so. The contrasting absence of\nan explicit requirement in the Second Morrill Act tends to show that none was in­\ntended.\n    A third consideration is that Agriculture to this day has permitted the states to\ncontinue giving Second Morrill Act appropriations to the 1890 colleges without\nrequiring that they receive First Morrill Act funds, notwithstanding the invalidity o f\nthe racial segregation proviso. See supra note 10 and accompanying text. W ithout\nthe benefit of the exemption contained in that proviso, however, all of the 1890\ncolleges should have been subject to what Agriculture takes to be the requirement\nthat they receive First Morrill Act funds, to the same extent as if they were 1862\ncolleges. Thus, Agriculture’s administration of the Second Morrill Act does not\nsupport its position with respect to State College.\n    Finally, the judicial decisions construing the Second Morrill Act support our\nconstruction of the Act, although we agree with Agriculture that they are not dis­\npositive o f the precise question at issue. The cases concerning requirements for\nreceipt of First and Second Morrill Act funds have focused on the type of educa­\ntion to be provided by a college in order to be eligible for such funds. See M arden,\n30 N.E at 556-57 (holding that a college may receive First and Second Morrill\nAct funds if it is of the type specified in the First Morrill Act); In re Agric. Funds,\n21 A. 916, 917 (R.I. 1890) (holding that the failure of Rhode Island’s agricultural\nschool to teach the mechanic arts disqualified it from Second Morrill A ct funds\nthat were intended “ ‘for the benefit of agriculture and the mechanic arts.’”)\n(emphasis added) (quoting the First Morrill Act, § 4, 12 Stat. at 504); S tate ex rel.\nWyoming Agric. C ollege v. Irvine, 84 P. 90, 100 (Wyo. 1906) (sum m arizing In re\nAgric.

These decisions do not say that receipt of First M om ll Act funds is a\nprerequisite for eligibility for Second Morrill Act appropriations. On the other\nhand, neither M arden nor In re Agric. Funds holds squarely that a college may\n\n   28     M oreover, C o n g ress's evident purpose in the First and Second M orrill A cts w as to prom ote a certain\nlype o f educational institution — i e , '‘colleges devoted to agriculture and the m echanic arts. * A g ric u ltu re's\nrequirem ent -- that a school receive First M orrill Act funds -- does not advance this purpose to any greater\ndegree than o u r construction, which requires that any school eligible to receive Second M orrill Aci funds\nalso conform to the educational requirem ents im posed by the First and Second M orrill Acts\n\n                                                      203\n\f                                     Opinions o f the O ffice o f L egal C ounsel\n\n\nreceive Second Morrill Act funds even if it does not receive First Morrill Act\nfunds. In M arden, Massachusetts Institute of Technology in fact was receiving\nboth. In In re Agric. Funds, the court denied the state agricultural college eligibil­\nity for Second M orrill Act funds.29\n    Agriculture nonetheless contends that the statute does require that any college\nreceiving Second M orrill Act appropriations have been designated for First Morrill\nAct funds. A griculture infers this requirem ent primarily from the recitation that the\nSecond M orrill A ct’s appropriations are “for the more complete endowment and\nm aintenance” of the land-grant colleges. The suggestion is that the words “more\ncom plete” imply that the states are required to use these funds solely to supplement\nthe endow m ent o f schools receiving First Morrill Act funds. Agriculture reinforces\nthis point by noting that the First M orrill A ct requires states to “take and claim the\nbenefit” for “at least one college.” 12 Stat. 504. Under the terms of the First M or­\nrill Act, a state failing to designate at least one beneficiary would forfeit its benefit\nentirely under that Act, id. at 504-05, without which no institution could be “more\ncom p letely ] endow ed” under the Second M orrill Act. In light of the considera­\ntions discussed above, we doubt that the very general language concerning the pur­\npose o f the Second M orrill Act can support the construction that Agriculture has\nplaced upon it.\n    The text of the Second Morrill Act, however, lends support to Agriculture’s\nview for another reason. The Second M orrill A c t’s (invalid) racial segregation\nproviso deem ed the establishment o f institutions for “colored students” to be com ­\npliance with the proviso that forbade discrimination in the admission of students\nbased on race or color. It did so by authorizing states having a college “established\nin pursuance o f [the First M omll A ct]” to establish (if they had not already done\nso) an institution “o f like character” for black students, “whether or not it has re­\nceived money heretofore under the [First M orrill A ct].” 26 Stat. at 418. This lim ­\nited exem ption of schools for “colored students” from receipt of First Morrill Act\nfunds would seem to imply a congressional understanding that schools receiving\nappropriations under the Second M orrill Act and not established under the proviso\nbe otherw ise subject to the requirement of receiving o f First Morrill Act funds.\n    Som e pertinent legislative history also substantiates Agriculture’s view. Most\nrelevant is a floor exchange between Senator Hoar and Senator Blair. During a\ndiscussion o f the draft bill, Senator Hoar suggested that the bill ought to, but did\nnot, allow states to allocate the appropriated benefits to an institution devoted to\nthe agriculture and mechanic arts “which did not receive the benefit of the original\n\n\n   29     R hode Isla n d ’s ag ricu ltu ral school was n o t a recipient o f First M o m ll A ct funds (only Rhode Island’s\nB row n U n iv ersity ap p ears to have been specifically so desig n ated ) T hus, the court could have disqualified\nthe agricu ltu ral school from Second M om ll A ct appropriations on this ground alone, if it had read that A ct in\nthe m an n er that A g riculture proposes.

Rec. 6086 (1890). He suggested that the bill be amended\nto rectify this perceived deficiency. Senator Blair — who was answering questions\nand objections from the Senators concerning the bill — asserted initially that the\nbill did not require amendment because it “meets . . . the suggestion[] of [Senator\nHoar] as it now is.” Id. This initial response implied that the bill did not require\ncolleges to receive First Morrill Act funds in order to be eligible for the new ap­\npropriation. When Senator Hoar expressed skepticism that the bill met his con­\ncerns, however, Senator Blair elaborated as follows:\n\n          It was not the understanding of the committee that we were rec­\n       ommending an annual appropriation for an indefinite number of\n       colleges which might hereafter come to be established. M eritorious\n       colleges undoubtedly will be established including the same subject\n       matter; but it was thought that the States where these colleges are\n       should receive a certain specific amount, $15,000 a year, and let\n       them appropriate that money, as they necessarily must now, to the\n       single agricultural college that exists in each State.\n\n           If there should be subsequently from those same funds — and I\n       do not see how it can be done, for the whole amount that was real­\n       ized from the lands under that act is already invested in every State\n       — but if it is conceivable that they should be subdivided and those\n       institutions multiplied with the funds already in the possession of\n       the State, then let them divide this annual appropriation for the sup­\n       port o f several if they see fit, but otherwise let it be concentrated\n       upon a single one of the institutions. However, they must be insti­\n       tutions which derive their vitality from the original act of Congress\n       making appropriations of the public lands. The nation itself cer­\n       tainly ought not to be dragged beyond what originates in that spe­\n       cific act of Congress in the way o f support of the agricultural\n       colleges and those of the mechanic arts which the States may see fit\n       to multiply among themselves hereafter.\n\nId. at 6087. This statement suggests that Senator Blair viewed the Second Morrill\nAct as prohibiting states from allocating funds to colleges not endowed with First\nMorrill Act funds. O f course, the statement is at odds with Senator B lair’s initial\nresponse to Senator H oar’s suggested amendment. Nonetheless, it is much more\ndetailed than the initial response and therefore likely reflects Senator B lair’s views\nmore accurately.\n   Senator B lair’s statement, however, belies the balance of political forces at the\ntime of the Second M orrill Act. To be sure, the Second M om ll A ct’s enactm ent\nlargely resulted from fierce lobbying by the land-grant college presidents, an effort\n\n\n                                              205\n\f                                       Opinions o f the O ffice o f L eg a l C ounsel\n\n\nobviously intended to obtain funds for these particular colleges and no others.30\nToo, the college presidents were able to squelch Senator’s Hoar proposal for ex­\nplicit language perm itting schools not receiving First Morrill Act funds to be given\nSecond M orrill A ct appropriations. See W illiams, supra note 2, at 144. It is\ndoubtful, however, that the college presidents had the political strength to obtain\nexplicit language confining Second M orrill Act appropriations to schools receiving\nFirst M orrill Act funds. They faced powerful opposition from the Grange m ove­\nment, w hich had long “condemn[ed] the colleges for their inability to attract agri­\ncultural students and vow[ed] to oppose the schools in every way,” W illiams,\nsupra note 2, at 3; see Eddy, supra note 2, at 73; Ross, su pra note 2, at 79-80. The\nstrength o f the Grange was reflected by the “G range Amendment” to the Second\nM orrill Act, which restricted application o f the appropriations more narrowly and\nexplicitly than had the First M orrill Act. The college presidents were forced to\ninclude these restrictions if they w ere to obtain even the G range’s sullen acquies­\ncence in the Second M orrill Act. It is doubtful that the bill would have passed had\nthey not done so.31 Even with such acquiescence, the Grange maintained their ef­\nforts to redirect federal funding aw ay from the existing land-grant colleges.32\nThere seems little doubt that the G range would have opposed vociferously (and\nprobably successfully) any language that expressly confined Second Morrill Act\nappropriations to schools receiving the benefits o f the First Morrill Act.\n\n\n\n     10 A s one re p resen tativ e in the House com plained:\n         I tell you, M r Speaker, that the only lo b b y 1 have seen at this session o f C ongress was the educa­\n         tional lobby, co m p o sed o f the presidents o f the ag ricu ltu ral institutions They have haunted the\n         co rrid o rs o f this C apitol; they have sto o d sentinel at the d o o r o f the C om m ittee on Education,\n         th ey h ave ev en in terru p ted the solemn delib eratio n s o f th at body by im prudent and im pudent\n         co m m u n ic atio n s. .

They were even fearful that the\nSecond M orrill Act could actually be interpreted to deny them such funds alto­\ngether. Thus, barely two months after the enactment of the Second Morrill Act:\n\n             Atherton and Alvord [two influential land-grant college presi­\n       dents who had each played a major role in lobbying for the Second\n       Morrill Act] were extremely anxious about the potential for rogue\n       initiatives— especially from the Grange— to exclude land-grant\n       colleges from receiving the benefits of the act or to qualify non-\n       land-grant colleges for the new funds. Thus, they prepared a “B rief\n       of Points” for A ssistant Interior Secretary Chandler and distributed\n       it as appropriate to various land-grant colleges. In their document,\n       Atherton and Alvord interpreted the second Morrill Act as a\n       “supplement to the Act of 1862.” They were careful to note that the\n       latter act applied only to institutions designated by their state legis­\n       latures to receive funds from the original act. Anticipating argu­\n       ments to the contrary, Atherton and Alvord emphasized that the\n       broad nature of the original act, and the power it gave to the various\n       states to develop their land-grant colleges according to the demands\n       o f local conditions, had given rise to a disparate class of institutions\n       . . . . They further emphasized that questions of institutional pur­\n       pose and organization . . . had already been settled in the various\n       states “and cannot now be raised to debar them from the benefits o f\n       the Act of 1890.”\n\nWilliams, su pra note 2, at 151-52 & n.75. It seems likely that the land-grant col­\nlege presidents would have obtained explicit language in their favor two months\nearlier if they could have done so. Thus, the absence of such language from the\nSecond M orrill Act does not appear to be mere oversight. Rather, it appears to\nreflect a stalemate between the college presidents and the Grange. In these circum ­\nstances, we do not find the single (somewhat contradictory) statement by Senator\nBlair to be controlling of our interpretation of the Second Morrill Act.\n   In sum, although the statute (including its legislative history) is not unam bigu­\nous, we conclude that the balance of the evidence supports the view that the Sec­\nond Morrill A ct’s appropriations may be given to colleges regardless o f whether\nthey are endowed under the First Morrill Act.

The land-grant college system began in 1862 with the\nFirst Morrill Act, ch. 130, 12 Stat. 503 (1862) (“First Morrill Act”)-2 That statute\nprovided the states with grants of public land or equivalent land scrip. Id. § 1, 12\nStat. at 503. The states that chose to “take and claim the benefit” o f the First M or­\nrill Act were required to invest the funds derived from the sale o f the land or land\nscrip in such fashion that the principal would “remain forever undiminished.” Id.\n§ 4, 12 Stat. at 504. The states were further required to devote the interest gener­\nated by such funds exclusively to the “endowment, support, and maintenance of at\nleast one college where the leading object shall be . . . to teach such branches of\n\n\n    2   For accounts o f the history o f the college land-grant system , see Joseph B Edm ond, The M agnificent\nC harter The O rigin a n d Role o j the M orrill L and-G ranl C olleges a n d U niversities (1978); Allan N evins,\nThe State U niversities a n d D em ocracy (1962), Edw ard D Eddy, Colleges j o r O ur L a n d and Tim e: The\nLand-G rant Idea in A m erican Education (1957), and Earle D.

The states were\nrequired to express acceptance of the land grant (or land scrip) through their legis­\nlatures.3 Once a state had accepted, it would still lose its benefit unless it provided\n“within five years . . . not less than one college” o f the prescribed kind. Id. § 5, 12\nStat. at 504.\n    The H atch Act. The A ct of M ar. 2, 1887, ch. 314, 24 Stat. 440 (codified as\namended at 7 U.S.C. §§ 361a-390d) authorized appropriations for agricultural re­\nsearch at experim ent stations under the direction either o f a college “established, or\nwhich may hereafter be established, in accordance with the provisions of [the First\nMorrill A ct]” or an independent station established by a state. See id. §§ 1 ,2 , 8,\n24 Stat. at 440-42. Unlike the First M orrill Act, the Hatch Act provided for pay­\nments by the federal government directly to the beneficiary institutions, although\nthe appropriations were still said to be “to each State.” Id. § 5, 24 Stat. at 441. In\nstates having tw o colleges established under the First Morrill Act, the funds were\nto be divided equally unless the state’s legislature directed otherwise. See id. § 1,\n24 Stat. at 440.\n    The S econ d M orrill A ct. The Second M orrill Act provided an annual appropri­\nation o f funds “to each State .. . for the more complete endowment and m ainten­\nance o f colleges for the benefit o f agriculture and the mechanic arts now estab­\nlished, or which may be hereafter established, in accordance with [the provisions of\nthe First M orrill A ct].” § 1, 26 Stat. at 417-18. The funds so appropriated were to\nbe paid to the state treasurer “designated by the laws of such State . . . to receive\nthe sam e” and then “immediately [paid] over . . . to the treasurers of the respective\ncolleges . . . entitled to receive the sam e.” Id. § 2, 26 Stat. at 418. The use of the\nfunds was restricted to “instruction in agriculture, the mechanic arts, the English\nlanguage and the various branches o f mathematical, physical, natural and economic\nscience, with special reference to their applications in the industries of life, and to\nthe facilities for such instruction.” Id. § 1, 26 Stat. at 418.\n   The Second Morrill A ct also forbade paym ent of funds appropriated under the\nAct to colleges “where a distinction of race or color is made in the admission of\nstudents.” Id. This prohibition, however, was qualified by a proviso deeming the\nestablishm ent o f a separate college for each race to be sufficient compliance if the\nfunds were divided “equitably” betw een the tw o schools. Id. A second proviso\ndescribed the m echanics o f “separate but equal” compliance in greater detail:\n\n              That in any State in which there has been one college established\n           in pursuance o f the [First M orrill Act], and also in which an educa­\n           tional institution o f like character has been established, or may be\n           hereafter established, and is now aided by such State from its own\n\n    1 T h e deadline for acceptance was two y e ars from the d ate o f the First M orrill A c t's enactm ent.

The Act of May 8, 1914, ch. 79, 38 Stat. 372 (codified as\namended at 7 U.S.C. §§ 341-349) established and funded agricultural extension\nservices “in connection with the college or colleges in each State now receiving, or\nwhich may hereafter receive, the benefits of the [First Morrill Act] . . . and the\n[Second Morrill Act].” Id. § 1, 38 Stat. at 372-73. As with the Second M orrill\nAct, the appropriations were payable to the States for disbursement. Id. § 4, 38\nStat. at 374. States having more than one eligible college were permitted to divide\nthe appropriation as the legislature saw fit. Id. § I, 38 Stat. at 373.\n\n                                                       B.\n\n    In 1863, the W est Virginia Legislature assented to the provisions of the First\nMorrill Act. 1863 W. Va. Acts ch. 56. After passage of the Second Morrill Act,\nthe W est Virginia Legislature assented to its terms, designated W est Virginia U ni­\nversity as the beneficiary of the funds available under the First Morrill Act, and\nestablished State College as the beneficiary o f a portion of the funds for the in­\nstruction of “colored” students. 1891 W. Va. Acts ch. 65, § l.4 W est Virginia was\namong a group o f seventeen states that ultimately complied with the Second M or­\nrill A ct’s eligibility requirements by establishing a racially segregated land-grant\ncollege for black students.5 The class of institutions thus established or designated\nby these seventeen states are commonly known as the 1890 colleges. The colleges\nin these same' states that restricted enrollment to white students, as well as the\n\n\n   4 Slate C ollege w as chartered as “The West V irginia C olored Institute.\" A m erican U niversities and C ol-\nleges 1822 (14th ed. 1992) In 1915, its nam e was changed to “T he W est V irginia C ollegiate Institute ” Id\nat 1823.

S ee Knight, 787 F. Supp. at 1145 n.44, 1167-68.\n   In m ost states, there is only a single land-grant college, which receives all of the\nfunds distributed to the state under the four statutes discussed in the preceding sub­\npart. Even in states having both an 1862 and an 1890 college, the experiment sta­\ntion and extension service funded under the Hatch and Smith-Lever Acts,\nrespectively, are alm ost uniformly located at the 1862 college, which consequently\nreceives all of the appropriations provided pursuant to those two Acts. See id. at\n1167-68.6 Furtherm ore, according to Agriculture, no 1890 college receives First\nMorrill Act funds.7 Consequently, w ith respect to the four statutes outlined above,\nthe only funds that the 1890 colleges receive are a share o f the Second Morrill Act\nappropriation.8 Thus, except as altered by the 1890 derivative statutes, see infra\nPart I.C, the pattern of unequal distribution o f federal funds (and o f state funds as\nwell) has rem ained little changed from the inception of the 1890 colleges.9 In the\nmid-1950s, the Suprem e Court held that the system of racially “separate but equal”\nstate education (including higher education) was unconstitutional.10 The end of\nde ju r e racial segregation raised the question whether there was a necessity for the\ncontinued participation of the 1890 colleges in the land-grant system. See Eddy,\nsupra note 2, at 265-66 (1957). T hus, West Virginia complied with the Supreme\nC ourt’s decisions by integrating both its 1862 college, W est Virginia University,\nand its 1890 college, State College, and by consolidating the land-grant function in\nW est V irginia University. State C ollege was removed from the land-grant system.\nSee 1957 W. Va. Acts ch. 72, John C. Harlan, H istory o f West Virginia State C ol­\nlege 1 8 9 1 -1 9 6 5 , at 101-04 (1968).

ISSUES F O R R E C O N S ID E R A T IO N\n\n    In 1991, W est Virginia enacted a law renewing its assent to the provisions of\nthe Second M orrill Act and designating State College as the sole beneficiary of\nfederal appropriations available under that Act. 1991 W. Va. Acts ch. 6 0 .13 As\ndiscussed above, State College was formerly an 1890 college. Its status as a land-\ngrant college was withdrawn in 1957 as part of West V irginia’s effort to desegre­\ngate its higher education system. Thus, the enactment in 1991 represents an at­\ntempt to restore State College’s status after a hiatus of thirty-four years.\n    By current standards, the annual appropriation of $50,000 available to each\nstate under the Second Morrill Act is not substantial. Request for Reconsideration,\nApp. at 8-34. Significantly more funding is available, however, under the 1890\nderivative statutes. West Virginia seeks funding for State College under both the\nSecond Morrill Act and the 1890 derivative statutes.14\n   Agriculture contends that State College is not eligible for funding under either\nthe Second Morrill Act or the 1890 derivative statutes.13 Agriculture maintains\nthat an institution may not receive Second Morrill Act appropriations unless it also\nreceives funds under the First Morrill Act. Because W est Virginia has not desig­\nnated State College to receive funds under the First Morrill Act, (and State College\ndoes not in fact receive funds under that Act), Agriculture concludes that State\nCollege may not be designated to receive appropriations under the Second Morrill\nAct.\n\n\n\n    '■ T he authorizations for appropriations contained in 7 U S C.

Nevertheless, Agriculture main­\ntains that because State College w as withdrawn from the land-grant system, the\nonly way to restore it is by the usual route requiring receipt of benefits under the\nFirst M orrill Act. Agriculture argues that the exception to that requirement — the\nracial segregation proviso — is unconstitutional, and hence, no longer available to\nW est V irginia.16\n   Concerning State College’s eligibility for funding under the 1890 derivative\nstatutes, A griculture contends that if State College fails to qualify for appropria­\ntions under the Second Morrill Act, it may not take advantage of the 1890 deriva­\ntive statutes, which condition funding upon an institution’s eligibility for\nappropriations under the Second M orrill Act. In addition, Agriculture denies that\nState College could qualify for funding under the 1890 derivative statutes even if it\nwere eligible to receive appropriations under the Second Morrill Act. It notes that\nthe class of colleges eligible for Second Morrill Act appropriations includes all the\n1862 colleges that receive appropriations under the First and Second Morrill Acts.\nBut, A griculture contends, Congress did not intend to benefit every such school.\nRather, C ongress intended to benefit only a specific group of sixteen historically\nblack colleges in the land-grant system at the time that the 1890 derivative statutes\nwere enacted (and also the historically black Tuskegee University, which is not a\nland-grant college). Agriculture invokes legislative history on this point, which it\nurges must guide the interpretation of the statutory language. Thus, in A gricul­\nture’s view, even assum ing that State College could now be designated to receive\nFirst M orrill Act funds, it nevertheless could not qualify for funding under the\n1890 derivative statutes, because it is not among the schools that Congress in­\ntended to benefit.\n   This O ffice’s original opinion (superseded by this one) agreed with W est V ir­\nginia. W e concluded that a state m ay designate an institution for Second Morrill\nAct appropriations without designating it for First Morrill Act funds if the school\nmeets the educational requirements of the First Morrill Act and the non­\ndiscrim ination requirem ent of the Second M orrill Act.

It ad­\nvances certain textual arguments concerning the Second M om ll Act to bolster its\nreading of that Act. With respect to the 1890 derivative statutes, Agriculture in­\nsists that we must avoid a result that is both absurd in itself and at odds with clear\nlegislative history. Agriculture emphasizes that a decision that State College may\nshare in funding under the 1890 derivative statutes carries potentially broad impli­\ncations. The language of these statutes seemingly encompasses a ll schools eligible\nto receive Second Morrill Act appropriations, including the 1862 institutions.\nThus, says Agriculture, “[i]f your opinion were adopted, a minimum of 74 institu­\ntions [i.e., all land-grant colleges and Tuskegee University] would become eligible\nfor the [funding] that is now distributed among 17 institutions [i.e., only the 1890\ncolleges and Tuskegee University].” Request for Reconsideration at 7 Obviously,\nthis outcome would considerably lessen the share of funds given to the 1890 col­\nleges. According to Agriculture, this outcome is absurd because the very purpose\nof the 1890 derivative statutes, as shown by the legislative history, was to remedy a\nhistorical inequity: the states that had maintained racially segregated systems had\ngiven almost all land-grant funding to their 1862 colleges while excluding the 1890\ncolleges from the federal bounty. Consequently, Agriculture concludes that the\n1890 derivative statutes must be read to authorize appropriations only for the bene­\nfit of the 1890 colleges.\n\n                               III.\n              STATE COLLEGE’S ELIGIBILITY FOR FUNDS\n               UNDER THE 1890 DERIVATIVE STATUTES\n\n   On reconsideration, we conclude that the 1890 derivative statutes provide ap­\npropriations only for the benefit of the 1890 colleges. Furthermore, we find that\nState College is not among the intended beneficiaries. Because we think that State\nCollege’s eligibility for appropriations under the Second M om ll A ct does not con­\ntrol its eligibility for appropriations under the 1890 derivative statutes, we leave\nconsideration of the Second Morrill Act to Part IV, infra.\n\n                                               A.\n\n   Our analysis of the 1890 derivative statutes is guided by a longstanding rule of\nconstruction very recently reiterated by a unanimous Supreme Court:\n\n       Over and over we have stressed that “[i]n expounding a statute, we\n       must not be guided by a single sentence or mem ber of a sentence,\n       but look to the provisions of the whole law, and to its object and\n\n\n                                              193\n\f                            Opinions o f th e O ffice o f L e g a l Counsel\n\n\n        policy.” U nited States v.

All aspects o f a statute, including its title, may be consulted in order\nto determ ine the congressional intent. See id. (consulting title).\n    It is undisputed that, from the tim e of the Second Morrill A ct’s enactment in\n1890 to this day, the colleges eligible to receive funds under that Act have included\nboth the 1862 colleges and the 1890 colleges. Indeed, as indicated above, the Sec­\nond M orrill Act was passed in large part for the specific benefit o f the 1862 col­\nleges. On their face, however, the 1890 derivative statutes fail to distinguish\nbetween the class o f colleges eligible for Second Morrill A ct funds, including both\nthe 1862 colleges and the 1890 colleges, and the more restricted class of 1890\ncolleges. For example, although N A R E T § 1444 is entitled “Extension at 1890\nLand-G rant Colleges,” 91 Stat. at 1007, the body of § 1444 creates a permanent\nauthorization for Congress “to . . . appropriate[] annually such sums as Congress\nmay determ ine necessary to support continuing agricultural and forestry extension\nat co lleg e s elig ib le to receive fu n d s under the [ the S econ d M o rrill A ct].” Id.\n(em phasis added). Similarly, NARET § 1445 is entitled “Agricultural Research at\n1890 Land-G rant Colleges;” the substantive text of § 1445, however, authorizes\nannual appropriations o f “such sum s as Congress may determine necessary to sup­\nport continuing agricultural research at colleges eligible to receive fu n d s under the\n[S eco n d M o rrill A c t].” 91 Stat. at 1009 (em phasis added). Thus, were we to con­\nsider the substantive provisions of the 1890 derivative statutes alone, without ref­\nerence to the titles, the legislative history, the other portions of the statutory text, or\nthe structure and purpose of the overall statutory scheme for the land-grant col­\nleges, we would be forced to conclude that those provisions benefited 1862 and\n1890 colleges alike.\n    Such a conclusion would, however, be at odds with the unmistakable purpose of\nthe 1890 derivative statutes. That purpose is to rectify the historical imbalance of\nfunding between the 1862 and 1890 colleges — an imbalance that originated in\nracial segregation. The House R eport concerning § 1444 o f NARET described its\npurpose as follows:\n\n          The comm ittee intends that the 1890 land-grant colleges . . . be­\n        com e partners in the D epartment’s agricultural research effort in the\n\n\n                                                 194\n\f             Reconsideration o f P rior O pinion C oncerning L and-G rant C olleges\n\n\n       food and agricultural scie n c e s.. .. [T]he research capacity in the\n       food and agricultural sciences at the 1890’s . . . is not as great as the\n       agricultural research capacity of many o f the 1862 schools. How­\n       ever, it must be emphasized that very few of the 1890 schools . . .\n       receive any state funding, and Federal funding for agricultural re­\n       search, which has not been on a permanent basis but rather on a\n       grants basis, has only been available to the 1890’s . . . since 1967.\n       Permanent funding for agricultural research has been available to\n       the state agricultural experim ent stations of the 1862 institutions\n       since 1887.\n\nH.R. Rep. No. 95-348, at 122 (1977) (“House R eport”).\n   During hearings concerning § 1433 of the Agriculture and Food Act o f 1981,\nthe need for the bill was put as follows:\n\n          This Congress has been supporting agricultural research for a\n       long time. As far back as 1862, Congress set up the land grant col­\n       lege system. Over the years, the institutions created under the 1862\n       Act have been helped to build research programs which are the envy\n       of the world.\n\n          Later, in 1890, Congress passed a second Morrill Act which was\n       designed specifically to support black land grant institutions. . . .\n          These institutions, which were originally created under the old\n       separate-but-equal doctrine, have had to make do with inadequate\n       state funding and little or no federal funding in the past for research,\n       teaching and extension. Their achievements with limited resources\n       have been tremendous, but . . . there is a limit to the number of\n       bricks a man can make without straw. The 17 institutions we are\n       dealing with need help now to bring their food and agricultural re­\n       search facilities up to acceptable levels.\n\n         The 1890 colleges need, simply, to catch up. That is what H.R.\n       1309 is designed to help them do.\n\n1890 Land-G rant C olleges F acilities: H earings on H.R. 1309 B efore the Sub-\ncomm. on D epartm ent O perations, Research, and Foreign A griculture o f the\nH ouse Comm, on Agriculture, 97th Cong. 8-9 (1981) (“House H earing” ) (prepared\nstatement of Rep. de la Garza); see also id. at 13-17 (prepared statem ent o f Rep.\nFord) (contrasting historically “meager funding” by the states and the federal gov­\nernment for the 1890 colleges with the “royal treatment” provided for the 1862\ncolleges, and asserting that H.R. 1309 would provide ‘“ catch-up” ’ funds to the\n1890 colleges “for years o f past neglect”).\n\n                                              195\n\f                                        Opinions o f th e Office o f L e g a l C ounsel\n\n\n    In drafting the 1890 derivative statutes to benefit the 1890 colleges, however,\nCongress conflated two distinct classes: colleges eligible to receive Second M or­\nrill Act funds, and the 1890 colleges. Thus, with respect to NARET §§ 1444 and\n 1445, both the Conference and the House Reports use the description “colleges\neligible to receive funds under the [Second M orrill A ct]” interchangeably with\n“ 1890 institutions.” See, e.g., S. Conf. Rep. No. 95-418, at 225-28 (1977)\n(“Conference R eport”); House R eport at 123-24. In fact, of course, the terms are\nnot interchangeable, because all o f the 1862 colleges, as well as the 1890 colleges,\nreceive Second M orrill A ct funds. Congress also understood the class o f 1890\ncolleges to consist wholly of sixteen identified, historically black schools. See,\ne.g., H.R. Rep. No. 97-151, at 3 (1981) (enum erating the sixteen 1890 colleges).17\n    It appears that Congress intended to fund only the sixteen identified 1890 col­\nleges, and mistakenly assumed that only they w ere eligible for Second Morrill Act\nfunds. The Conference and House Reports specifically contrast the 1890 colleges\nwith the 1862 colleges, thus showing that Congress understood the distinction be­\ntween the two classes, even though it supposed that only the former class was eli­\ngible for Second M orrill Act appropriations. S ee Conference Report at 225-27;\nHouse Report at 122. Thus, the legislative history suggests that NARET §§ 1444\nand 1445 were intended to authorize appropriations only for the 1890 colleges.18\n    References to unenacted materials evidencing C ongress’s intent would not alone\nbe sufficient to control the enacted language o f N A RET §§ 1444 and 1445, even if\nthose m aterials dem onstrated that th e statutory language Congress adopted derived\nfrom a m istake o f fact or law.

Cl.\n1948) (holding that courts “have no power to, in effect, reform statutes because\nCongress, in writing them, labored under a misapprehension as to facts or law”).\nOur obligation, however, is to give meaning and effect to the entirety o f the rele­\nvant statutory texts, and we can do so here only if we assume that the 1890 deriva­\ntive statutes were designed for the sole benefit of the 1890 colleges. An\ninterpretation of NARET §§ 1444 and 1445 that takes those provisions to refer\nonly to the 1890 colleges is the only reading of the statute that can account for the\n“full text, language[,] . . . structure, and subject m atter.” N ational Bank o f O r., 508\nU.S. at 455.\n   As detailed below, this understanding o f the 1890 derivative statutes helps ex­\nplain certain provisions in those enactments that otherwise would remain anoma­\nlous. Although these anomalies do not necessarily rise to the level of intrinsic\ntextual ambiguity, nor do they create patently absurd results, our ability to explain\nthem provides some assurance that our use of legislative history has contributed to\na proper understanding of the text.19\n   The first anomaly has to do with the computation o f funding authorized by NA­\nRET §§ 1444(a) and 1445(a). In § 1444(a), it is keyed to a percentage of the\namount of funds appropriated for extension work under the Smith-Lever Act. See\n91 Stat. at 1007. Likewise, in § 1445(a), research funds are authorized in an\namount based upon a percentage of the level of funds appropriated for agricultural\nresearch under the Hatch Act. See id. at 1009. As noted above, however, every\nstate has given its Smith-Lever and Hatch Act funds exclusively to its 1862 college\nand experiment stations controlled exclusively by those schools (except Arkansas,\nwhich has an independent experim ent station). If §§ 1444 and 1445 are designed\nto rectify the states’ historic discrimination between the 1862 and 1890 colleges,\nthese funding mechanisms would have a discernible purpose. But if §§ 1444 and\n 1445 are read to benefit the 1862 colleges as well as the 1890 colleges, then Con­\ngress would have created a (much smaller) duplicate mechanism to fund research\nand extension at colleges already receiving appropriations for these purposes under\nthe Smith-Lever Act and the Hatch Act. It also seems unlikely that when Congress\nprovided “catch up” funds for the 1890 colleges, it did so by appropriating still\nmore funds for the 1862 colleges already acknowledged to be receiving the lion’s\nshare of state and federal land-grant funding. It is more consonant with the statu­\n\n\n    19    S ee Retch i’ G reat Lakes Indian Fish a n d W tldhje C iim m 'n, 4 F 3d 4 90 (7th C ir 1993) T here, the\ncourt suggested that one may “ seek m eaning beneath the sem antic level not only w hen there is an ‘intrinsic'\nam biguity      but also w hen there is an ‘ex trin sic ’ one, that is, w hen doubt that the literal m eaning is the\ncorrect one arises only w hen one know s som ething ab o u t the concrete activities         intended to [be] regu-\nlate[d].” Id. at 494. Thus. “ A literal reading o f the F air Labor Standards Act w ould create a senseless d is­\ntinction betw een Indian police and all other public police           N othing in the A ct alerts the read er to the\nproblem ; you have to know that there are Indian police to recognize it But once it is recognized, the Act,\nview ed as a purposive, rational docum ent, becom es am b iguous, creating room for interpretation W e cannot\nthink o f any reason other than oversight why C ongress failed to extend the law enforcem ent exem ption to\nIndian police      [and] no reason has been suggested to us.\" Id.\n\n                                                      197\n\f                           Opinions o f the O ffice o f L egal C ounsel\n\n\ntory purpose to read the 1890 derivative statutes as appropriating funds solely for\nthe 1890 colleges.\n   A second anom aly occurs in NARET § 1444(c), which contains presuppositions\nthat make sense only if § 1444 is read to apply solely to the 1890 colleges. Sub­\nsection (c) provides: “The State director o f the cooperative extension service and\nthe adm inistrative head for extension at the eligible institution in each State where\nan eligible institution is located shall jointly develop, by mutual agreement, a com­\nprehensive program of extension for such State.” 91 Stat. at 1008. As mentioned,\nevery state has an extension service created under the Smith-Lever Act and at­\ntached to that state’s 1862 college. This subsection, however, contemplates that\nnot every state has an eligible institution (making it necessary to include the phrase\n“where an eligible institution is located”). It also presupposes a distinction be­\ntween the statew ide extension program and the extension program at an eligible\ninstitution, whose administrative heads are instructed to work “jointly.” These\npresum ptions do not make sense if § 1444 is read to include the 1862 colleges,\nwhich have extension programs. They make sense, however, if § 1444 is read to\nestablish a new extension program for the exclusive benefit of the 1890 colleges,\nwhich are found only in sixteen states and do not have an extension program under\nthe Sm ith-Lever Act. Indeed, the Conference Report confirms that the purpose of\nsubsection (c) is to coordinate the extension program newly created under § 1444\nat each 1890 college with the existing extension program at the 1862 college lo­\ncated in the same state. Conference Report at 226-27; see also House Report at\n122 (“ [T]he com m ittee wishes to stress its desire that the agricultural research con­\nducted at the 1890’s . . . and the involved 1862 institutions not be duplicative.”).\n   A third anom aly appears in § 1433(a) o f the A griculture and Food Act o f 1981,\nwhich is opaque unless read to benefit only the 1890 colleges. It states:\n\n            It is hereby declared to be the intent of Congress to assist the in­\n       stitutions eligible to receive funds under the [Second M om ll Act]\n       . . . in the acquisition and improvement o f research facilities and\n       equipm ent so that eligible institutions may participate fully with the\n       State agricultural experiment stations in a balanced attack on the re­\n       search needs of the people o f their States.\n\n95 Stat. at 1312. As has been indicated, no state has more than one agricultural\nexperim ent station, and all (but one) of these are under the control of an 1862 col­\nlege that receives Second Morrill Act benefits. Section 1433(a) cannot refer to\nboth the 1862 and 1890 colleges because that would mean that the 1862 colleges in\nstates w ithout 1890 colleges are to “participate fully” with them selves in perform­\ning agricultural research. Thus, the text makes sense only if the eligible institutions\nare understood as a class separate from the existing state agricultural experiment\nstations. Properly construed, the section reflects once again the congressional pur­\n\n                                              198\n\f                  Reconsideration o f P rior Opinion C oncerning L and-C ranl C olleges\n\n\npose o f providing additional funding to the 1890 colleges to restore “balance[]” in\nthe allocation of federal funds between the 1862 and 1890 colleges, thus rectifying\na perceived imbalance that had prevented the 1890 colleges from “participat[ing]\nfully” in agricultural research.\n    The very same analysis applies to the language of § 1416(a) o f the Food Secu­\nrity Act of 1985, 99 Stat. at 1549, setting forth a declaration of congressional intent\nin authorizing grants to upgrade cooperative extension facilities. The title of\n§ 1416, moreover, is “Grants to upgrade 1890 land-grant college extension facili­\nties.” Id.\n    In sum, a number of anomalies disappear when the 1890 derivative statutes are\nread as benefiting solely the 1890 colleges. There are, moreover, aspects of the\n 1890 derivative statutes that affirmatively support such a reading. First, it is sig­\nnificant that all of the 1890 derivative statutes allocate funds not to the states, as is\ntrue of the earlier land-grant statutes, but directly to the eligible institutions.20 The\nlegislative history indicates that Congress understood this structure as a departure\nfrom prior practice with respect to the 1862 colleges. See Conference Report at\n226 (rejecting a Senate bill provision that would have provided that the states “act\nas intermediaries with respect to the extension programs between the 1890 institu­\ntions and the Secretary of Agriculture in the same manner as currently exists for\n 1862 institutions” in favor of a House am endm ent that provided for a direct rela­\ntionship between the 1890 institutions and the Secretary). This difference in\nstructure is consistent with the expressed purpose of the 1890 derivative statutes to\nrectify an imbalance of funding brought about largely by the discriminatory action\nof the states in their allocation of federal (and state) funds.\n    Second, as noted above, the titles of most o f the 1890 derivative statutes ex­\npressly refer to funding for the 1890 colleges. See, e.g., NARET § 1444, 91 Stat.\nat 1007 (“Extension at 1890 land-grant colleges”); FACT Act § 1612(b), 104 Stat.\nat 3722 (“Grants to upgrade agricultural and food sciences facilities at 1890 land-\ngrant colleges”). The titles provide strong textual evidence that the 1890 deriva­\ntive statutes are designed to benefit only the 1890 colleges.\n    Finally, the sums appropriated pursuant to the 1890 derivative statutes are much\nsmaller than those appropriated pursuant to the earlier land-grant statutes. For ex­\nample, the FY 94 Appropriation provides the 1862 colleges and experiment sta­\ntions with $272,582,000 in Smith-Lever Act funding for extension work and\n$171,304,000 in Hatch Act funding for research. In contrast, it provides only\n$25,472,000 for extension work pursuant to NARET § 1444 and $28,157,000 for\nresearch pursuant to NARET § 1445. See 107 Stat. at 1051, 1053. In each case, if\nthe N A RET funds were divided over seventy-four schools (the combined total o f\nthe 1862 and 1890 colleges and Tuskegee University), no school would derive\n\n\n   20    A lthough the H atch A ct provides for disbursem ent o f funds by the federal governm ent directly to the\nbeneficiaries, the states effectively each choose the beneficiary, and the appropriation is said to be '“to each\nState ” 24 Slat, at 441\n\n                                                     199\n\f                                      Opinions o f the O ffice o f L egal Counsel\n\n\nmuch benefit from its share of funds and the am ount received by an 1862 college\nwould be m inuscule relative to the funds that each such college will receive for\nessentially the sam e purposes pursuant to the Sm ith-Lever and Hatch Acts. These\ncircum stances suggest that the congressional intent was not to divide the 1890 de­\nrivative funds am ong all the land-grant colleges, but only among the 1890 colleges.\nSee R ose v. R ose, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111884\"><a href=\"/opinion/111884/rose-v-rose/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">619</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 630-31 (1987) (em ploying division o f appropria­\ntions am ong beneficiaries to determine meaning o f statute).\n   O ur exam ination o f the FACT A ct § 1612, 104 Stat. at 3721, as well as its leg­\nislative history, confirm s that Congress continued to equate the colleges eligible to\nreceive benefits under the Second M orrill Act with the 1890 colleges. See, e.g.,\nH.R. C onf. Rep. No. 101-916, at 1047-48 (1990). The same is true o f the FY 94\nAppropriation, 107 Stat. at 1051-53, and its legislative history. See, e.g., H.R.\nRep. No. 103-153, at 29, 40 (1993); S. Rep. N o. 103-102, at 29, 40-1 (1993).\nThus, the class of intended beneficiaries has not changed.\n\n                                                             B.\n\n   Having concluded that Congress intended the phrase “eligible to receive funds\n[under the Second M orrill Act]” to refer solely to the 1890 colleges, we must de­\ntermine w hether State College falls within this class. Congress understood this\nclass to encom pass a specific list o f sixteen identified schools (to which was added\nthe Tuskegee Institute). See, e.g., H.R. Rep. No. 97-151, at 3 (1981) (listing the\n1890 colleges). Because State College was not among the identified schools, it\nwould seem that it may not share in 1890 derivative funding.\n   C ongress’s list of 1890 colleges, moreover, likely was drawn from the general\nunderstanding of the term “ 1890 college” as a category encompassing historically\nblack land-grant colleges with a com m on genesis in the Second Morrill Act.\nOriginally, State College was commonly understood to be among this group. Be­\ncause State College was withdrawn from the land-grant system, however, it lost its\nstanding as an 1890 college. Thus, when the 1890 derivative statutes were passed,\nthis term was no longer commonly understood to include State College.21 State\nCollege, therefore, was not (and could not have been) among the intended benefi­\nciaries of those statutes.\n   It m ight be argued nonetheless that W est V irginia’s putative restoration of State\nCollege to the land-grant system also restored it to the category of 1890 colleges.22\nW est V irginia took this action in 1991, prior to the 1993 enactment o f the FY 94\n\n\n     21 C om pare, e.g , E ddy, su p ra noie 2, at 2 5 8 -5 9 (1 9 5 7 ) (State C ollege included am ong the 1890 colleges)\nwith, e         E d m o n d , su p ra note 2, at 63 (1978) (State C ollege ab sen t from list o f the 1890 colleges otherw ise\ndraw n from E d d y 's book).\n    22 T h is m ay be the b asis o f W est V irg in ia G o v ern o r C a p e rto n 's suggestion that W est V irginia's\n* re d e sig n a tio n ” o f State C ollege under the S eco n d M orrill A ct m akes it eligible for 1890 derivative funding\nSee L e tte r for E dw ard M adigan, Secretary o f A g ricu ltu re, D epartm ent of A griculture, from G aston Caperton,\nG o v ern o r o f W est V irg in ia at 2 (A ug. 9, 1991).\n\n                                                            200\n\f                   Reconsideration o f Prior Opinion C oncerning L and-G rant C olleges\n\n\nAppropriation. Therefore, we cannot a p rio ri exclude the possibility that, at the\ntime the FY 94 Appropriation was enacted, either Congress believed that State\nCollege was once again an 1890 college or, in a more general sense, that “ 1890\ncollege” as a term of art once again included State College. The A ppropriation’s\nlegislative history, however, does not offer any discussion as to what schools Con­\ngress thought were among the 1890 colleges.23 Furthermore, the general usage\ndoes not appear to have changed.24 In light o f the previous congressional belief (as\nwell as the general understanding among those using the term) that State College\nwas not one of the 1890 colleges, this silence is tantamount to not recognizing\nState College’s restoration as an 1890 college.25 Consequently, we conclude that\nthe reference to 1890 colleges in the FY 94 Appropriation does not include State\nCollege. Accordingly, State College may not share in the funds appropriated in the\nFY 94 Appropriation pursuant to the authorizations contained in the 1890 deriva­\ntive statutes.\n\n                                    IV.\n                   STATE COLLEGE’S ELIGIBILITY FOR FUNDS\n                      UNDER THE SECOND MORRILL ACT\n\n    W e turn now to the question posed by A griculture’s Request for Reconsidera­\ntion whether a land-grant college may receive Second Morrill Act appropriations if\nit does not receive funds under the First Morrill Act.\n    The Second M om ll Act provides an annual appropriation of funds “to each\nState . . . for the more complete endowment and maintenance of colleges for the\nbenefit of agriculture and the mechanic arts now established, or which may be\nhereafter established, in accordance with [the provisions o f the First Morrill Act].”\nId. § 1, 26 Stat. at 417-18. Agriculture construes this general language to condi­\ntion the eligibility of a college to receive funds under the Second Morrill Act upon\nits designation as a recipient of First Morrill Act funds. In our original opinion, we\nreached the opposite conclusion, construing this language to impose only a re­\nquirement that a college conform to the educational requirements of the First M or­\nrill Act (and the non-discrimination requirement in the Second Morrill Act).\n    In light of our conclusions in Part III, supra, this issue does not have any bear­\ning on the question of whether State College (or any college) may qualify for\n\n\n    21 See, e g , H R Rep No. 103-153, at 29, 40, S Rep.

M oreover, we note that there are no\nrestrictions on the division of funds between schools eligible for First Morrill Act\nfunds. See infra note 27 and accompanying text. Therefore, as Agriculture has\nacknow ledged, W est Virginia “could meet the threshold of 1862 designation by\ngiving State College one dollar of 1862 monies per year.” Request for Reconsid­\neration at 10. Furtherm ore, as indicated earlier, the annual appropriation for each\nstate under the Second Morrill Act is not large by today’s standards. These con­\nsiderations substantially reduce the practical importance of any decision on this\nissue. N onetheless, since State C ollege’s eligibility for Second Morrill Act funding\nremains in dispute, we will reconsider the issue. W e conclude that, although the\nquestion is a close one, the balance o f the evidence favors our original view.\n   T he legislative history of the Second M orrill Act suggests that Congress be­\nlieved that the appropriated funds would in fact be used to supplement the funds\navailable to the land-grant colleges and departments that had been established by\nthe states pursuant to the First M orrill Act.26 Furtherm ore, the development o f the\nland-grant system has indeed followed this course. Except for the 1890 colleges,\nonly colleges receiving the benefits o f the First M orrill A ct have been designated\nby their respective states to receive appropriations under the Second Morrill Act.\nNonetheless, in our original opinion, we took the view that the statutory language\ndid not specifically mandate that the states allocate Second Morrill A ct funds only\nto colleges already endow ed with F irst Morrill A ct funds if a state (such as W est\nVirginia) wished to do otherwise.\n   In support o f our original construction of the Second Morrill Act, these kinds of\nconsiderations may be cited: the statutory scheme, the contrast with the language\nof a sim ilar statute, the longstanding practice o f those administering the Act, and\njudicial construction of it. First, the existence o f such a specific limitation seems at\nodds with the statutory scheme, w hich vests the states with very broad power to\nallocate Second Morrill Act appropriations to institutions o f their choosing.

The Smith-Lever Act follows the struc­\nture of the Second M orrill Act in giving appropriated funds to the states. 38 Stat.\nat 373. It expressly provides, however, that the states must allocate the appropri­\nated funds for extension work at “the college or colleges in each State now receiv­\ning, or which may hereafter receive, the benefits of the [First Morrill Act] . .. and\nof the [Second Morrill Act].” Id. Thus, Congress knew how to impose this type of\nrequirement in clear language when it wished to do so. The contrasting absence of\nan explicit requirement in the Second Morrill Act tends to show that none was in­\ntended.\n    A third consideration is that Agriculture to this day has permitted the states to\ncontinue giving Second Morrill Act appropriations to the 1890 colleges without\nrequiring that they receive First Morrill Act funds, notwithstanding the invalidity o f\nthe racial segregation proviso. See supra note 10 and accompanying text. W ithout\nthe benefit of the exemption contained in that proviso, however, all of the 1890\ncolleges should have been subject to what Agriculture takes to be the requirement\nthat they receive First Morrill Act funds, to the same extent as if they were 1862\ncolleges. Thus, Agriculture’s administration of the Second Morrill Act does not\nsupport its position with respect to State College.\n    Finally, the judicial decisions construing the Second Morrill Act support our\nconstruction of the Act, although we agree with Agriculture that they are not dis­\npositive o f the precise question at issue. The cases concerning requirements for\nreceipt of First and Second Morrill Act funds have focused on the type of educa­\ntion to be provided by a college in order to be eligible for such funds.

In M arden, Massachusetts Institute of Technology in fact was receiving\nboth. In In re Agric. Funds, the court denied the state agricultural college eligibil­\nity for Second M orrill Act funds.29\n    Agriculture nonetheless contends that the statute does require that any college\nreceiving Second M orrill Act appropriations have been designated for First Morrill\nAct funds. A griculture infers this requirem ent primarily from the recitation that the\nSecond M orrill A ct’s appropriations are “for the more complete endowment and\nm aintenance” of the land-grant colleges. The suggestion is that the words “more\ncom plete” imply that the states are required to use these funds solely to supplement\nthe endow m ent o f schools receiving First Morrill Act funds. Agriculture reinforces\nthis point by noting that the First M orrill A ct requires states to “take and claim the\nbenefit” for “at least one college.” 12 Stat. 504. Under the terms of the First M or­\nrill Act, a state failing to designate at least one beneficiary would forfeit its benefit\nentirely under that Act, id. at 504-05, without which no institution could be “more\ncom p letely ] endow ed” under the Second M orrill Act. In light of the considera­\ntions discussed above, we doubt that the very general language concerning the pur­\npose o f the Second M orrill Act can support the construction that Agriculture has\nplaced upon it.\n    The text of the Second Morrill Act, however, lends support to Agriculture’s\nview for another reason. The Second M orrill A c t’s (invalid) racial segregation\nproviso deem ed the establishment o f institutions for “colored students” to be com ­\npliance with the proviso that forbade discrimination in the admission of students\nbased on race or color. It did so by authorizing states having a college “established\nin pursuance o f [the First M omll A ct]” to establish (if they had not already done\nso) an institution “o f like character” for black students, “whether or not it has re­\nceived money heretofore under the [First M orrill A ct].” 26 Stat. at 418. This lim ­\nited exem ption of schools for “colored students” from receipt of First Morrill Act\nfunds would seem to imply a congressional understanding that schools receiving\nappropriations under the Second M orrill Act and not established under the proviso\nbe otherw ise subject to the requirement of receiving o f First Morrill Act funds.\n    Som e pertinent legislative history also substantiates Agriculture’s view. Most\nrelevant is a floor exchange between Senator Hoar and Senator Blair. During a\ndiscussion o f the draft bill, Senator Hoar suggested that the bill ought to, but did\nnot, allow states to allocate the appropriated benefits to an institution devoted to\nthe agriculture and mechanic arts “which did not receive the benefit of the original\n\n\n   29     R hode Isla n d ’s ag ricu ltu ral school was n o t a recipient o f First M o m ll A ct funds (only Rhode Island’s\nB row n U n iv ersity ap p ears to have been specifically so desig n ated ) T hus, the court could have disqualified\nthe agricu ltu ral school from Second M om ll A ct appropriations on this ground alone, if it had read that A ct in\nthe m an n er that A g riculture proposes.

Rec. 6086 (1890). He suggested that the bill be amended\nto rectify this perceived deficiency. Senator Blair — who was answering questions\nand objections from the Senators concerning the bill — asserted initially that the\nbill did not require amendment because it “meets . . . the suggestion[] of [Senator\nHoar] as it now is.” Id. This initial response implied that the bill did not require\ncolleges to receive First Morrill Act funds in order to be eligible for the new ap­\npropriation. When Senator Hoar expressed skepticism that the bill met his con­\ncerns, however, Senator Blair elaborated as follows:\n\n          It was not the understanding of the committee that we were rec­\n       ommending an annual appropriation for an indefinite number of\n       colleges which might hereafter come to be established. M eritorious\n       colleges undoubtedly will be established including the same subject\n       matter; but it was thought that the States where these colleges are\n       should receive a certain specific amount, $15,000 a year, and let\n       them appropriate that money, as they necessarily must now, to the\n       single agricultural college that exists in each State.\n\n           If there should be subsequently from those same funds — and I\n       do not see how it can be done, for the whole amount that was real­\n       ized from the lands under that act is already invested in every State\n       — but if it is conceivable that they should be subdivided and those\n       institutions multiplied with the funds already in the possession of\n       the State, then let them divide this annual appropriation for the sup­\n       port o f several if they see fit, but otherwise let it be concentrated\n       upon a single one of the institutions. However, they must be insti­\n       tutions which derive their vitality from the original act of Congress\n       making appropriations of the public lands. The nation itself cer­\n       tainly ought not to be dragged beyond what originates in that spe­\n       cific act of Congress in the way o f support of the agricultural\n       colleges and those of the mechanic arts which the States may see fit\n       to multiply among themselves hereafter.\n\nId. at 6087. This statement suggests that Senator Blair viewed the Second Morrill\nAct as prohibiting states from allocating funds to colleges not endowed with First\nMorrill Act funds. O f course, the statement is at odds with Senator B lair’s initial\nresponse to Senator H oar’s suggested amendment. Nonetheless, it is much more\ndetailed than the initial response and therefore likely reflects Senator B lair’s views\nmore accurately.\n   Senator B lair’s statement, however, belies the balance of political forces at the\ntime of the Second M orrill Act. To be sure, the Second M om ll A ct’s enactm ent\nlargely resulted from fierce lobbying by the land-grant college presidents, an effort\n\n\n                                              205\n\f                                       Opinions o f the O ffice o f L eg a l C ounsel\n\n\nobviously intended to obtain funds for these particular colleges and no others.30\nToo, the college presidents were able to squelch Senator’s Hoar proposal for ex­\nplicit language perm itting schools not receiving First Morrill Act funds to be given\nSecond M orrill A ct appropriations. See W illiams, supra note 2, at 144. It is\ndoubtful, however, that the college presidents had the political strength to obtain\nexplicit language confining Second M orrill Act appropriations to schools receiving\nFirst M orrill Act funds. They faced powerful opposition from the Grange m ove­\nment, w hich had long “condemn[ed] the colleges for their inability to attract agri­\ncultural students and vow[ed] to oppose the schools in every way,” W illiams,\nsupra note 2, at 3; see Eddy, supra note 2, at 73; Ross, su pra note 2, at 79-80. The\nstrength o f the Grange was reflected by the “G range Amendment” to the Second\nM orrill Act, which restricted application o f the appropriations more narrowly and\nexplicitly than had the First M orrill Act. The college presidents were forced to\ninclude these restrictions if they w ere to obtain even the G range’s sullen acquies­\ncence in the Second M orrill Act. It is doubtful that the bill would have passed had\nthey not done so.31 Even with such acquiescence, the Grange maintained their ef­\nforts to redirect federal funding aw ay from the existing land-grant colleges.32\nThere seems little doubt that the G range would have opposed vociferously (and\nprobably successfully) any language that expressly confined Second Morrill Act\nappropriations to schools receiving the benefits o f the First Morrill Act.\n\n\n\n     10 A s one re p resen tativ e in the House com plained:\n         I tell you, M r Speaker, that the only lo b b y 1 have seen at this session o f C ongress was the educa­\n         tional lobby, co m p o sed o f the presidents o f the ag ricu ltu ral institutions They have haunted the\n         co rrid o rs o f this C apitol; they have sto o d sentinel at the d o o r o f the C om m ittee on Education,\n         th ey h ave ev en in terru p ted the solemn delib eratio n s o f th at body by im prudent and im pudent\n         co m m u n ic atio n s. .

Thus, barely two months after the enactment of the Second Morrill Act:\n\n             Atherton and Alvord [two influential land-grant college presi­\n       dents who had each played a major role in lobbying for the Second\n       Morrill Act] were extremely anxious about the potential for rogue\n       initiatives— especially from the Grange— to exclude land-grant\n       colleges from receiving the benefits of the act or to qualify non-\n       land-grant colleges for the new funds. Thus, they prepared a “B rief\n       of Points” for A ssistant Interior Secretary Chandler and distributed\n       it as appropriate to various land-grant colleges. In their document,\n       Atherton and Alvord interpreted the second Morrill Act as a\n       “supplement to the Act of 1862.” They were careful to note that the\n       latter act applied only to institutions designated by their state legis­\n       latures to receive funds from the original act. Anticipating argu­\n       ments to the contrary, Atherton and Alvord emphasized that the\n       broad nature of the original act, and the power it gave to the various\n       states to develop their land-grant colleges according to the demands\n       o f local conditions, had given rise to a disparate class of institutions\n       . . . . They further emphasized that questions of institutional pur­\n       pose and organization . . . had already been settled in the various\n       states “and cannot now be raised to debar them from the benefits o f\n       the Act of 1890.”\n\nWilliams, su pra note 2, at 151-52 & n.75. It seems likely that the land-grant col­\nlege presidents would have obtained explicit language in their favor two months\nearlier if they could have done so. Thus, the absence of such language from the\nSecond M orrill Act does not appear to be mere oversight. Rather, it appears to\nreflect a stalemate between the college presidents and the Grange. In these circum ­\nstances, we do not find the single (somewhat contradictory) statement by Senator\nBlair to be controlling of our interpretation of the Second Morrill Act.\n   In sum, although the statute (including its legislative history) is not unam bigu­\nous, we conclude that the balance of the evidence supports the view that the Sec­\nond Morrill A ct’s appropriations may be given to colleges regardless o f whether\nthey are endowed under the First Morrill Act. Accordingly, West Virginia could\nvalidly designate State College to receive appropriations under the Second Morrill\nAct.\n\n\n\n\n                                             207\n\f                                     Opinions o f the O ffice o f L egal C ounsel\n\n\n                                            V. CONCLUSIONS\n\n    W e conclude that W est Virginia could validly designate State College as a re­\ncipient o f Second Morrill Act appropriations without designating it to receive First\nMorrill Act funds. We further conclude that, regardless o f State College’s eligibil­\nity for Second M orrill Act appropriations, it is not among those colleges eligible\nfor benefits under the 1890 derivative statutes.33\n\n\n\n                                                                    W A LTER DELLINGER\n                                                                   A ssista n t A ttorney G eneral\n                                                                     Office o f L egal Counsel\n\n\n\n\n     31 A g ricu ltu re m ay w ish to request that C o n g ress refer specifically to the 1890 colleges in its future ap-\npropnacions p u rsu a n t to the 1890 derivative statu tes.
