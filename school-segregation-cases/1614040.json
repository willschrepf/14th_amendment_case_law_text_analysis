Yonkers Board of Education</i> 624 F.Supp. 1276 (S.D.N.Y.1985). On December 18, 1985 the Court established a schedule for the action's remedy phase. The Yonkers Board of Education and the City of Yonkers were directed to submit remedy proposals on or before February 17, 1986.</p>\n<p>On February 17, 1986, the Yonkers Board of Education submitted to the Court and the parties its proposed remedial plan, entitled \"Educational Improvement Plan for the Yonkers Public School System\". The United States and Plaintiffs-Intervenors (hereinafter \"the NAACP\") filed their responses to the Board's remedial proposal by March 12, 1986. On April 2, 1986 the Board filed modifications to its original remedial proposal, entitled \"Modifications to the Educational Improvement Plan submitted on February 17, 1986\" to which the United States and the NAACP filed responses by April 7, 1986.</p>\n<p>The Court conducted a hearing from April 8, 1986 through April 15, 1986 receiving testimony and documentary evidence to assist it in fashioning an appropriate remedy for the unlawful condition of segregation found to exist in the Yonkers Public Schools.</p>\n<p>On April 22, 1986, this Court issued its opinion and Proposed Remedial Order. On May 7, 1986, the Board submitted its Response and Objections to the Court's Proposed Remedial Order. Following consultation with all the parties the Court hereby sets forth its order for the desegregation of the Yonkers Public School System.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES</h2>\n<p>The implementation strategies which form the foundation for the Yonkers public schools Educational Improvement Plan shall include:</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>School Closings</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The district shall close the following schools effective September, 1986:</p>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1541</span>\n    School # 6\n    School # 10\n    School # 11\n    School # 32\n    School # 34\n    Fermi Middle School\n    Hawthorne Middle School\n    Yonkers High School\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>Elementary Schools</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The district shall operate the following elementary schools effective September, 1986:</p>\n    School # 5\n    School # 8\n    School # 9\n    School # 13\n    School # 14\n    School # 16\n    School # 17\n    School # 19\n    School # 21\n    School # 22\n    School # 23\n    School # 26\n    School # 28\n    School # 29\n    School # 30\n    Enrico Fermi\n<p>The attendance zones for these schools shall be those areas set forth in Appendix A. During the 1986-87 school year, the Board shall develop and begin to implement attendance area magnet programs designated for School 19 and Enrico Fermi, to open September 1987.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. <i>Dedicated Magnet Schools</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The district shall operate dedicated magnet schools to reduce racial/ethnic isolation by attracting students to programs that emphasize areas of special interest. Students will be recruited to leave their regular attendance zone school to enroll in schools that have no specific attendance zone. The district shall operate the following district-wide dedicated magnet schools effective September, 1986:</p>\n<blockquote>School # 10  Early Childhood Center (Pre-K)</blockquote>\n<blockquote>PEARLS  Gifted and Talented (Pre K-6) Hudson River Museum Junior High School  Science, Social Studies and Creative Arts, Gifted and Talented (7-9)</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Saunders Trades, Technical, Business and Computer High School (and Academic Magnet Component)</blockquote>\n<p>Until the new Hudson River Junior High School is completed the 7-9 Gifted and Talented magnet program currently housed in Emerson and Mark Twain will be moved to Hawthorne. In addition, the 4-6 Gifted and Talented component of the PEARLS program planned for September, 1986 will also be housed in Hawthorne. Upon opening of the Hudson River Junior High School Hawthorne shall house the PEARLS program Pre K-6. Until the new Hudson River Junior High School is completed, the Pre K-3 component of the PEARLS program will be housed in School # 32.</p>\n<p>Admission criteria for dedicated magnet schools, as well as for other magnet and specialized programs, will be submitted to a court appointed Monitor by June 1, 1986 for the magnet schools and programs to be implemented in September 1986 and by January 15, 1987 for the magnet schools and programs to be implemented in September 1987. Any party may offer its comments on such criteria to the Monitor. This procedure will be followed whenever a new program is slated to commence in the ensuing school term. All magnet students will take the required subjects and course work necessary for promotion and graduation, and all high school magnet students will have the opportunity to meet college entrance requirements. By June 15, 1986 the Board shall provide the Monitor and the parties with a description of the academic magnet program to be offered at Saunders.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4. <i>Attendance Area Magnet Schools</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The district shall operate the following attendance area magnet schools effective September, 1986:</p>\n<blockquote>School # 18  Scholastic Academy for Traditional Education (K-6)</blockquote>\n<blockquote>School # 25  Science, Social Studies, Physical Development, Creative Arts, Extended Day (K-6)</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1542</span> School # 27  Montessori, Humanities and Creative Arts, Extended Day (K-6) Martin Luther King  High Technology Computer Assisted Instruction, Extended Day (K-6)</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Burroughs Junior High School  Career Development and Pre-Vocational (7-9)</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Emerson Junior High School  Performing and Visual Arts, Multilingual Education (7-9)</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Mark Twain Junior High School  Physical Development (7-9)</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Gorton Senior High School  Pre-Professional Magnet Program (10-12)</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Lincoln Senior High School  Performing Arts Magnet Program (10-12)</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Roosevelt Senior High School  Communication Arts Magnet Program (10-12)</blockquote>\n<p>Effective September 1987, the following additional attendance area magnet schools will be opened:</p>\n<blockquote>School # Multilanguage Options  Global Perspective (K-6)</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Enrico Fermi  Computer Assisted Instruction and Performing Arts (K-6)</blockquote>\n<p>The attendance zones for all of the attendance area magnet schools are set forth in Appendix A.</p>\n<p>For the first year of this Order the attendance area elementary magnet school will be integrated by admission policy which will afford an opportunity for enrollment to all students in the district to the maximum extent consistent with the integrative goals of the Order. In implementing this policy the Board may impose such limitations as shall be appropriate to achieve its objectives.</p>\n<p>At the secondary level attendance area students and interested magnet students from throughout the district will be selected by application controlling for racial and ethnic balance.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>5. <i>Voluntary Student Transfers  VST</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The district shall direct a Voluntary Student Transfer program permitting minority students who attend predominantly minority schools to transfer to non-minority schools. Conversely, white students attending predominantly white schools may transfer to predominantly minority schools of their choice for the same reason. The purpose of such transfers is to enhance the racial/ethnic balance of the receiving school. Such transfers will not be permitted, however, if they would adversely impact on the racial composition of either the receiving or the sending school.</p>\n<p>To encourage Voluntary Student Transfers, enrichment and supplemental programs will be established in those schools where sufficient seating capacity has been identified.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. SCHOOL DISTRICT ORGANIZATION</h2>\n<p>The district shall establish a K-6, 7-9, 10-12 grade pattern organization as follows:</p>\n<p></p>\n<pre>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1543</span>\n                                                                                         CIS = Compensatory Infusion Services\n                   PROPOSED ORDERSCHOOL                                                 CAI = Computer Assisted Instruction\n                   DISTRICT REORGANIZATION                                               VST = Voluntary Student Transfer\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n|   School   |    Current Organization   |       Proposed Organization          |              Program Description<sup>[*]</sup>               |\n|------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| #5         |  K-6 Neighborhood School  |  K-6 Neighborhood VST School         |  Writing to Read; Kindermath                       |\n| #6         |  K-6 Neighborhood School  |  CLOSED                              |  -                                                 |\n| #8         |  K-6 Neighborhood School  |  K-6 Neighborhood VST School         |  Project Zoo                                       |\n| #9         |  K-6 Neighborhood School  |  K-6 Neighborhood School             |  -                                                 |\n| #10        |  K-6 Neighborhood School  |  Early Childhood Center              |  Early Childhood Center (PreK)                     |\n| #13        |  K-6 Neighborhood School  |  K-6 Neighborhood School             |  Writing to Read                                   |\n| #14        |  K-6 Neighborhood School  |  K-6 Neighborhood VST School         |  Project Zoo                                       |\n| #16        |  K-6 Neighborhood School  |  K-6 Neighborhood School             |  -                                                 |\n| #17        |  K-6 Neighborhood School  |  K-6 Neighborhood School             |  Writing to Read; Kindermath                       |\n| #18        |  K-6 Neighborhood School  |  K-6 Attendance Area Magnet          |  Scholastic Academy for Traditional Ed.; CIS       |\n| #19        |  K-6 Neighborhood School  |  K-6 Attend.

INTEGRATION GOALS AND TIME-TABLE</h2>\n<p>The District shall seek to achieve the following levels of desegregation as measured by the percentage of students attending desegregated schools at the respective grade pattern organizational levels:</p>\n<p></p>\n<pre>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1544</span>\n   Start of        % of Elementary        % of Junior          % of Senior\n  School Year         Students           High Students        High Students\n  1986-1987              50%                100%                  100%\n  1987- *               100%                100%                  100%\n</pre>\n<p>For purposes of this Order and at the present time, a desegregated school shall be defined as within plus or minus 20 percentage points of the districtwide average of minority students, (the relevant minority population is comprised of Black and Hispanic students), for that grade pattern organization level; if the school is a dedicated magnet or an attendance area magnet, however, it is desegregated if its minority enrollment is within plus or minus 15 percentage points of the districtwide average of minority students at that grade pattern organization level during the first year of operation and plus or minus 10 percentage points of the districtwide average for that grade pattern organization level in the second year of operation.</p>\n<p>* In the Spring of 1987, the Court will evaluate the progress made by the Board in the implementation of the voluntary aspects of this order for the purpose of establishing an appropriate timetable for the achievement of such goals. The Board shall report to the Court on March 16, 1987 the extent to which its plan has succeeded in achieving these goals through voluntary transfers. Should sufficient majority race students not voluntarily transfer from identifiably white schools and/or sufficient minority students not transfer to identifiably white schools, the Board shall propose its plan for accomplishing the desegregation of all its schools. The parties shall submit their comments to this proposal two weeks thereafter and, if necessary, the Court shall schedule an evidentiary hearing before ordering into effect a proposal to fully integrate Yonkers elementary schools through such techniques as enrollment caps, the redrawing of elementary school attendance lines, and other measures. To permit possible utilization of redrawn elementary school attendance lines, the Board shall submit to the Court and the parties, no later than January 5, 1987, its proposal for such lines drawn consistently with the criteria set forth in the Court's Opinion and Proposed Order of April 22, 1986. The extent to which any redrawn elementary school attendance lines would be effective for September 1987 would depend upon the progress made by the Board in implementating the voluntary aspects of this Order. Depending upon the degree of that progress, the Court may order implementation of the redrawn attendance lines in whole, in part or not at all.</p>\n<p>Those schools which do not meet the district's integration goals and which remain predominantly minority during the transition period shall provide supplemental educational services.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. STUDENT ASSIGNMENT</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>Recruitment</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In order to maximize the extent to which the integrative goals of this order will be reached through voluntary student assignments, the administration of the Yonkers public school system will establish an intense recruitment phase which will include the following activities:</p>\n<blockquote>· dissemination of brochures and fliers describing the new program options throughout the city</blockquote>\n<blockquote>· direct mailing of program options and descriptions to all parents</blockquote>\n<blockquote>· newspaper, billboard and radio and cable television announcements of available magnet programs</blockquote>\n<blockquote>· publication of all recruitment material in Spanish and Arabic</blockquote>\n<blockquote>· school based recruitment meetings conducted by building administrators and central office staff</blockquote>\n<blockquote>· telephone recruitment centers, English and Bilingual, through which parents will be called directly to explain magnet programs</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1545</span> · telephone hotline to respond to inquiries</blockquote>\n<blockquote>· acceptance of initial registration by telephone as appropriate</blockquote>\n<blockquote>· community meetings with minority groups and organizations to solicit support and assistance in the dissemination of magnet program availability</blockquote>\n<blockquote>· door to door canvass by district personnel to explain magnet program availability</blockquote>\n<blockquote>· magnet fair in which students and their parents will be transported to central display centers with movies, slides and material available for briefing</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>Selection</i>\n</h2>\n<p>A fundamental aspect of the implementation procedures in the Remedy proposal will be the requirement that all parents must select the schools which their children will attend for September 1986 even if it is the attendance area school. Parents must indicate their first three choices for 1986-87. For the first year, no student will be admitted into any school, magnet school, or attendance area school without the parent having indicated that selection as one of the three choices. The Board shall make every effort to assign each student to the optimum choice school listed on his or her choice form.</p>\n<p>For 1987-88, the parent or guardian of each student in the district will again be required (as early in the school year as is deemed feasible but no later than March 1, 1987) to submit to the Board in writing a school choice form listing three choices for his or her child. For the 1987-88 school term, at least one of the child's choices must be a school where that child's attendance will further the goals of desegregation as defined in this order. Again, the Board shall make every effort to assign each student to the optimum choice school listed on his or her form. The same procedure will be followed in subsequent years for students living in the district but attending public school for the first time, students born in the district who are beginning school, students transferring into the district, and students moving from one grade organizational level to the next (e.g., from junior high to high school).</p>\n<p>This procedure will begin immediately after the issuance of this Order. In subsequent years, as much planning lead time shall be provided as is possible. The objective of requiring three options is to force a choice and thereby inform parents of the availability of magnet program options and encourage their selection. All applications will be logged and numbered and a receipt given for each application. Only one application per child will be accepted. The procedure would be initiated immediately after issuance of the Order and certainly before the end of the 1985-86 school year. In subsequent years, it would be initiated early in the school year to provide as much planning lead time as possible for the district and for parents. In addition to selection forms and program descriptions which will be mailed to all parents in the district, building principals, counselors and teachers will be required to meet with parents and review the options available to them.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>(a) Admission Criteria</h2>\n<p>After the initial selection phase has been completed, the district shall use the following process for admission into the magnet schools provided it does not prevent the district from achieving its goal for desegregation:</p>\n<blockquote>For those magnet schools or programs in which the requests of qualified students do not exceed stated capacity, those students will be immediately notified and admitted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>For those magnet schools or programs in which the requests of qualified students are greater than stated capacity, first priority will be given to those students already enrolled. Then, a random selection will be conducted on the basis of desired integrative goals. Such random selection will be conducted publicly with observers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>For those students whose first choice of a magnet school is not granted, the parents will be individually contacted to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1546</span> reaffirm the desirability of the second or third choice. Every effort shall be made at this stage to encourage the parents to accept the second or third choice of a magnet school. For those students who are placed on a waiting list at the request of the parents because of the unavailability of space, a requirement will be established that they must reapply during the next recruitment phase but will be given preference provided that the granting of such preference will not adversely impact the racial/ethnic balance of the school.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>If admission criteria are met, every preference shall be given to the siblings of children already enrolled in magnet schools provided that such admission does not adversely impact on the racial/ethnic balance of the magnet school.</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>(b) Sibling Preference</h2>\n<p>When more applications for vacancies in a school or program are received than there are seats available, all applications will be randomly selected. After random selection, a rank-ordered waiting list, based on the random selection, will be developed. Names of siblings not initially accepted will be placed at the top of the rank-ordered waiting list. If only one twin is accepted the other twin will also be enrolled provided that whatever admission criteria exist, if any, are met.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>(c) Admission to Specialized Programs</h2>\n<p><i>Gifted and Talented</i> students selected for participation in the district's Gifted and Talented Magnet Programs are those who, by virtue of potential and/or achievement, are capable of high academic performance. Eligibility for the program is determined for each applicant following a careful analysis of standardized test scores, report card information, teacher input (on learning, task commitment, creativity and leadership) and parent input when possible. Entrance examinations will be included at the fourth grade level and above. All available information will be recorded and handled through a weighted matrix traditionally used for the selection of Gifted and Talented students. (Baldwin Matrix). On the basis of the test scores of the students who apply, a cut-off point will be determined and then students shall be admitted on a racial/ethnic balanced basis. It is anticipated that the selection will be geared toward the top five percent over the district cut-off point or points on multi-measures. Student selection shall be made to ensure a balanced racial/ethnic student composition and will be conducted by a committee of at least three administrators, to include at least one of whom would be minority.</p>\n<p>Enrollment in these programs continues from one grade level to the next provided a student is achieving at the expected rate and level and the parents desire program continuation. A student may be counseled out of the program if progress is poor and/or the program is not in the student's best interest.</p>\n<p><i>Citywide High School Career Specialty Magnet Programs</i> will enroll students who have a sincere interest and believe they have the ability to succeed. Prior to submitting an application for such a program, counseling services will be provided so that there is reasonable expectation that the student will meet the success. The student and parent will be provided with information clearly outlining the schools' programs, expectations, and course requirements. If the number of applicants exceeds the available space, students will be selected based upon aptitude for the specific area, teacher recommendation, report card information and attendance patterns. These data will be weighted and ranked to ensure balanced racial/ethnic participation. Student selection will be made by a team of at least three administrators, at least one of whom shall be a minority member.</p>\n<p><i>The Performing and Visual Arts Magnets</i> will accept applications from interested students who must also undergo an audition in their specific areas of interest. These areas include Dance, Drama, Vocal and Instrumental Music. Selection will be made on the basis of specific criteria for each performing arts area. Student selection will be made to ensure racial/ethnic <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1547</span> balance and selection will be made by a group of at least three performing arts teachers, at least one of whom shall be minority member.</p>\n<p>Students applying for Fine Arts and Graphic Arts programs must submit a portfolio of work for review. Selection will be made on the basis of specific criteria for the Visual Arts. Student selection will be made to ensure a racial/ethnic balance and selection will be made by a group of at least three Visual Arts teachers, at least one of whom shall be a minority member.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>(d) Notification of Status</h2>\n<p>Parents or guardians will be notified by mail indicating whether their children have been accepted, or placed on a waiting list for magnet schools or programs. Parents will be asked to confirm their intention to enroll their children in the program into which they have been accepted by mailing back within a stated return period, a confirmation letter which will have been enclosed in their letter of notification.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. <i>Appeal Procedure</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Parents who wish to question admission procedures or appeal the decision of the selection committee will be required to put appeal in writing. The parent first will be invited to discuss the concern with a magnet counselor. If, after the counselor interview, the parent desires to continue the appeal, a Placement Review Committee will review all material and make a final determination of magnet placement. The decisions must not adversely affect the integrative objectives of this Order. If a student cannot be accepted immediately after review, an otherwise qualified student will be placed on a priority waiting list. The Placement Review Committee will be composed of at least three Central Office administrators to be determined by the Superintendent of Schools and will include minority participation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>E. STAFF ASSIGNMENT</h2>\n<p>The district shall make every effort to ensure that by September, 1986, the racial composition of teachers at each school within approximately plus or minus five percentage points of the districtwide average for minority teachers, as a result of reassignments in connection with school closings and conversions and the reassignment of teachers to magnet schools and magnet programs. Thereafter, the district shall attempt to maintain the racial distribution of teachers on a reasonably uniform basis, while respecting the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement between the district and the Yonkers Federation of Teachers.</p>\n<p>If the Board cannot achieve this goal while adhering to the collective bargaining agreement, the parties may make applications to the Court for the requisite modifications.</p>\n<p>With respect to the staffing of magnet programs and magnet schools, the district and the Yonkers Federation of Teachers have agreed to establish a process for selection which would address the mutual concerns of both parties.</p>\n<p>Although the Court denied the application by the NAACP for the adoption of an affirmative action hiring program at this time such ruling is without prejudice to renewal subsequent to March 16, 1987 if it should appear that the aforesaid efforts of the Board and the Yonkers Federation of Teachers have not achieved satisfactory levels of minority staff hiring and distribution throughout the Yonkers school system.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>F.

Services and Programs</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Educational Improvement Plan</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Yonkers Public Schools</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>SUPPORTIVE SERVICES AND PROGRAM</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>Staff Development</i>\n</h2>\n<p>A comprehensive staff development plan to assist administrators and teachers in the implementation of new programs for September will begin in the Summer of 1986.</p>\n<p>Beginning in June, the New York State Education Department's National Diffusion Network Team will conduct a series of inservice workshops for teachers for six separate programs included in the Remedy Proposal:</p>\n<blockquote>(a) Project Zoo</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(b) Kindermath Program</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(c) Project Ecology</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(d) The Early Prevention of School Failure Program</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(e) The Starwalk Program</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(f) Every Child a Winner</blockquote>\n<p>Additional workshops will focus on two special programs being provided to staff at every Voluntary Student Transfer (VST) site. These programs are the <i>Talents Unlimited Program</i> and the <i>Student Team Leadership Program.</i> A special cadre of teachers and principals from these VST schools will be trained as turnkey facilitators who in turn will train other teachers and administrators in other VST schools which will house identical programs.</p>\n<p>The new Comprehensive Staff Development Plan is based upon the New York State Education Department guidelines recommending a full day program for all teachers. Additional activities derived from a needs assessments and understanding of district goals are also incorporated into the Plan.</p>\n<p>In addition, Staff Development activities in preparation for September, 1986 will include a minimum of three days of intensive training and five action workshops to be held during August, 1986 and which will be designed exclusively to provide the necessary program skills for every teacher assigned to a districtwide magnet program.</p>\n<p>Over the course of the summer and continuing through the entire school year, university professors representing Sarah Lawrence College will work with teachers in developing and expanding curriculum for the Foreign Language and Multicultural Educational (FLAME) Programs located at School 30 and also School 22. Teachers College, Columbia University will assist with the PEARLS Program.</p>\n<p>State University of New York's Partnership Consortium and the State will work with teachers in the Aesthetics and Science Programs located at Martin Luther King Jr., Fermi and Emerson; Iona College of New Rochelle will concentrate on computer programs located throughout the district, particularly in Martin Luther King; St. Joseph's Hospital, affiliated with the Medical and Health Magnet at Gorton High School, and a pool of other kinds of needed training for staff to ensure the successful implementation of the total instructional program in September.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>Remediation</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Remediation is not separate, but part of the total education process. It is an ongoing process and takes place when students are identified through a variety of sources including but not limited to teacher observations, New York State mandated tests, and districtwide evaluation procedures.</p>\n<p>A formal process in the early identification of pupils who need special help in developing the basic skills of reading comprehension, mathematics, and writing is required by the Yonkers Remediation Program. Early identification and the monitoring of pupil progress in developing these skills are important features of the current program and will continue to be emphasized under this Order.</p>\n<p>The basic criteria for determining remedial instruction is based on student test scores on the mandated New York State Tests administered in Grades 3, 5, 6, and 8. However, when a student falls below the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1573</span> State Reference Point on these tests, the following process takes place;</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Stage I</i></h2>\n<p><i>Parental Notification:</i> A standardized reporting form is sent to parents. The form includes the students' scores and the content and scope of the instructional program. The form indicates the remediation teacher and provides an opportunity for parents to receive recommendations on how to assist in the reinforcement of the identified remedial area(s).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Stage II</i></h2>\n<p><i>Student Participation:</i> Students receive both individualized and small group instruction from their classroom teacher and/or from the reading and math specialist.</p>\n<p>The students' progress is monitored through the Yonkers Remediation district Program which consists of an outline of skills necessary to master the basics in the content areas of reading, mathematics and writing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Stage III</i></h2>\n<p><i>Termination of Pupil Participation in the Yonkers Remedial Program:</i> When a pupil is provided remediation for a period of time (not less than six months) and there is strong evidence that the remediation is no longer needed, the student is re-tested with the appropriate New York State test for the grade level. This opportunity is given to the student in February and June.</p>\n<p>If the appropriate passing scores have been achieved, a student is removed from the remedial program. The decision to end remediation must be supported by all available information and be endorsed by the classroom teacher.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Stage IV</i></h2>\n<p><i>Parental Notification:</i> Parents are also notified when the remedial program is terminated. Written notice, containing the reason for ending the program, is provided. If parents request that remedial programs be continued, every effort must be made to accommodate their wishes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Remediation</i></h2>\n<p>The Yonkers public schools will continue to refine its current Remediation Program. Remediation for Yonkers students will not be confined to the above process but will be developed, improved and expanded according to the needs reflected by the student population. It will continue to target those students in the non-desegregative environment during the transitional period and the Yonkers public schools will meet full compliance with the educational goals set forth in this Order.</p>\n<p>The Yonkers program will be incorporated into educational experiences which will include parents as partners in reading; computer literacy training to reinforce basic skills; and the involvement of city library services to encourage reading for lifetime enjoyment.</p>\n<p>\"Thought is Taught\" will be the new motto which will emphasize thinking skills as the prerequisite to all basic skills.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. <i>School Improvement Plan</i>\n</h2>\n<p>A basic component in the new program of instruction mandated by the State of New York, the Regents Action Plan, is the identification of those schools within the State requiring special assistance. Identification of these schools is made in an annual release of a Comprehensive Assessment Report in which the schools are identified according to the following selection indicators:</p>\n<blockquote> Student test data on all pupil evaluation program tests, all Regents preliminary competency tests, all Regents examinations, all occupational education proficiency examinations and all second language proficiency examinations</blockquote>\n<blockquote> Student enrollment by grade</blockquote>\n<blockquote> Number of students transferred into the alternative high school equivalency preparation program</blockquote>\n<blockquote> Data, as required by the commissioner, on diplomas and certificates awarded</blockquote>\n<blockquote> Any additional information which the superintendent of the school district, or the chief administrative officer of the nonpublic school believes will reflect the relative assessment of a school building or district.</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1574</span> The Comprehensive Assessment Report for the Yonkers public school system was released on December 4, 1985, in which 12 schools were identified by the State of New York as in need of special assistance. (The list was subsequently reduced to 11 with the removal of Gorton High School) Each of the schools is located on the west side of the city and all but 3 are predominately minority.</p>\n<p>An integral part of the Comprehensive Assessment Report is the requirement that the Superintendent of Schools, in cooperation with the professional staff, establish a Comprehensive School Improvement Plan (CSIP) which would specify specific measures, procedures, and recommendations which would be undertaken to improve student achievement in the schools identified as being in need of assistance (CAR schools).</p>\n<p>In addition to the Comprehensive School Improvement Plan being developed for the CAR schools, the administration directed that such plans be developed for each school so that a comprehensive assessment of needs, both programmatical and physical, could be provided for the school system. Although the district would be reorganized under this Order, that program will be continued and will follow the guidelines established by the New York State Education Department which are that the Comprehensive School Improvement Plans must be developed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote> In consultation with teachers, administrators and other school personnel</blockquote>\n<blockquote> On an individual school basis for implementation in September of 1986</blockquote>\n<blockquote> On the prescribed format (i.e., including definition of individual school needs, goals, objectives, activities, timelines, and evaluation)</blockquote>\n<blockquote> Using the Effective Schools Model  a grass roots approach to planning for effective change initiated by individual school staffs</blockquote>\n<p>An active program of inservicing of administrators and teachers has been undertaken by the administration for the development of the School Improvement Plan. These activities include the following:</p>\n<blockquote> School administrators have been provided training in preparation for their tasks of acting as turnkey workshop leaders of sessions designed for plan development. These administrative staff development sessions included training by central office personnel, university professors, Metro Center staff and fellow principals who have successfully followed the Effective Schools Model.</blockquote>\n<blockquote> Two half and one full day workshop led by principals were conducted in each school. During these sessions CSIPs were developed and will be refined for presentation to the Superintendent of Schools, Board of Education and (in the case of the eleven CAR identified schools) the New York State Education Department.</blockquote>\n<blockquote> Each school plan will be reviewed for additional assistance required for effective implementation. Beginning in March, six New York State Education Department Effective Schools Consortium representatives will be worked in concert with the eleven CAR identified school principals and staffs in an effort to commence preparation for the plan. They will serve as support personnel along with local curriculum coordinators and Chapter II teacher trainers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote> It should be noted that the selection of these schools was based on data for the 1983-84 school year and significant progress has been made in the improvement of student achievement in many of the schools identified by the State Education Department since that time. These efforts will be encouraged and further developed as the CSIP process unfolds but it must be recognized that many of the schools identified will be changed under this Proposal. The more significant task is to maintain accurate identification of the children attending the CAR schools and to ensure appropriate remediation for them.</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1575</span> 4. <i>Districtwide Program</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The district has developed various curricular models and programs designed to foster an understanding and appreciation of differences among races, cultures and groups. These include programs such as: Student Team Learning, Talents Unlimited, and the Ferguson-Florissant Writing Project. These have been facilitated by ECIA Chapter 2 teacher training to ensure a consistent quality of inservice in these interactive programs. In addition to the classroom models and schoolwide programs, there are many districtwide activities designed to increase interracial exposure and improve intergroup relations.</p>\n<blockquote><i>High School Student Council</i></blockquote>\n<blockquote>At the high school level, the district has established an inter-school student council to promote school improvement projects and to advise the Superintendent of student matters. Five high school students, one from each school, were selected for summer training in leadership and attended a New York State Student Seminar in July, 1985. This group of racially balanced students have given their leadership to the total group. The teacher-advisor for this group is a former <i>NATIONAL TEACHER OF THE YEAR.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote><i>Outward Bound</i></blockquote>\n<blockquote>The district has co-sponsored an Outward Bound Program which sent several high school students throughout the country to learn to survive with other students in a variety of experiences.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><i>Convocation</i></blockquote>\n<blockquote>The district is planning a seventh and eighth grade convocation on relevant topics to bring students together in a problem-solving situation. Future plans include a county-wide convocation under university sponsorship.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><i>Summer School</i></blockquote>\n<blockquote>A centralized summer school program is offered to all high school students and includes counseling services and remedial instruction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><i>Music and Art Fair</i></blockquote>\n<blockquote>The district's Music and Art Fair is the culmination of school-based activities throughout the year and provides an opportunity for interracial exposure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><i>Spelling Bee</i></blockquote>\n<blockquote>The district Spelling Bee is the culmination of classroom, school and area bees of all elementary schools. In addition to the English Spelling bee competitions, simultaneous competitions are also conducted in Spanish.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><i>Interschool Trips</i></blockquote>\n<blockquote>As part of the district's program with the Westchester Council of the Arts, cultural trips are planned for several elementary schools. In addition, interschool trips for specific school events are sponsored to provide for interracial exposure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><i>Yonkers Educational and Cultural Arts Center</i></blockquote>\n<blockquote>The restoration of this beautiful turn-of-the-century mansion has truly been the result of community and school district interest and shared support. Students from the Saunders Trades and Technical High School's architectural department restored the building; community members donated money and resources; horticulture students from other district high schools beautified the grounds; and Culinary Arts students prepare meals for community events and public fetes. In addition, it serves as a teacher training facility and conference center open to the entire county.</blockquote>\n<p>In order to achieve the district's goals of creating a multicultural environment and reducing ethnic and racial isolation, the district will continue to support and expand multi-cultural activities.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>5. <i>Facilities</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The infrastructure of the Yonkers public schools has been in a deteriorating state for many years due to the lack of capital funding. The situation in some of the schools within the City has approached a state of alarm in terms of physical condition, let alone the learning environment of children and for staff.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1576</span> It is to be noted that the district has a comprehensive Capital Improvement Program extending over the next five years and the rehabilitation needs of the facilities throughout the district are clearly severe. Every effort shall be made to continue the efforts of the district to obtain additional funding to continue the rehabilitation program which will be initiated under the $11.3 million bond program.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>6. <i>Extra-Curricular Programs</i>\n</h2>\n<p>There is a very comprehensive extra-curricular program in the Yonkers public school system, including interscholastic sports, intramural activities, and a variety of other activities related to student clubs, newspaper, drama clubs, bands, musical shows and other programs for students' interests and activity preferences. In order to ensure equality in terms of participation and availability of extra-curricular activity to students who attend Magnet School or who transfer voluntarily to enhance integration, the district will:</p>\n<p> ensure that transportation is available after school for those students who wish to participate in extra-curricular activities and who are transported to school.</p>\n<p> establish pre-determined pick-up and drop-off points for students participating in extra-curricular programs to ensure safety and reasonableness in terms of distance and time.</p>\n<p>In addition, the district will closely monitor the racial/ethnic composition of the extra-curricular program in each school to maintain an appropriate and desirable balance. Recruitment efforts will be established within each school to assist in the efforts to provide such a balance.</p>\n<p>Extra-curricular programs shall be based on need, interest and preference of the students, both in area attendance zone, as well as for those students who voluntarily transfer to the school for racial/ethnic integration purposes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>7. <i>Compensatory Infusion Programs</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Those schools which do not meet the district's integration goals and which remain predominantly minority during the transition period will be eligible for intensive compensatory programs. These will include smaller class sizes, additional reading teachers, reading aides and trained mathematics specialists and aides who will provide individually guided instruction in small groups, using special materials and newly equipped labs. Transitional schools will also be eligible for increased guidance, psychological, and social work services to ensure an optimum learning environment.</p>\n<p>Moreover, a summer school program for low achieving students is planned to mitigate the effects of \"summer loss\" and to provide additional instructional time. Prevention of future school failure is the goal of the group counseling component.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>8. <i>Chapter I Services</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The Chapter I funds provided to the Yonkers public schools currently supports reading teachers, mathematic teachers, ESL teachers and teacher support in 10 elementary schools and two middle schools. The students who are receiving these services and who are entitled to receive these services will continue to receive them under the Remedy Proposal in one of two major ways:</p>\n<p> Those schools under the new organization with a high percentage of eligible students will receive full time supplemental staff for small group remediation instruction in reading, mathematics, and ESL. In addition, instructional material and equipment will also be provided.</p>\n<p> In those schools where there are small numbers of eligible students, instruction will be provided in a resource model or a tutorial model. In those instances, Chapter I funds will be provided to support the additional teacher time required.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]   All neighborhood schools will also have a common core of enrichment programs. The programs described here are above and beyond\nthe common core.</p>\n<p>[**]   And a strong academic Magnet component the precise nature of which shall be recommended by the district and which may be\ncommenced on a grade-a-year basis.</p>\n<p>[***]   Subject to the Court's final decision regarding Whitman following completion of the housing portion of the remedy hearings and without\nprejudice to that decision.</p>\n\n</div>",

Yonkers Board of Education</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2304726\"><a href=\"/opinion/2304726/united-states-v-yonkers-bd-of-educ/\"><span class=\"volume\">624</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1276</span></a></span> (S.D.N.Y.1985). On December 18, 1985 the Court established a schedule for the action's remedy phase. The Yonkers Board of Education and the City of Yonkers were directed to submit remedy proposals on or before February 17, 1986.</p>\n<p>On February 17, 1986, the Yonkers Board of Education submitted to the Court and the parties its proposed remedial plan, entitled \"Educational Improvement Plan for the Yonkers Public School System\". The United States and Plaintiffs-Intervenors (hereinafter \"the NAACP\") filed their responses to the Board's remedial proposal by March 12, 1986. On April 2, 1986 the Board filed modifications to its original remedial proposal, entitled \"Modifications to the Educational Improvement Plan submitted on February 17, 1986\" to which the United States and the NAACP filed responses by April 7, 1986.</p>\n<p>The Court conducted a hearing from April 8, 1986 through April 15, 1986 receiving testimony and documentary evidence to assist it in fashioning an appropriate remedy for the unlawful condition of segregation found to exist in the Yonkers Public Schools.</p>\n<p>On April 22, 1986, this Court issued its opinion and Proposed Remedial Order. On May 7, 1986, the Board submitted its Response and Objections to the Court's Proposed Remedial Order. Following consultation with all the parties the Court hereby sets forth its order for the desegregation of the Yonkers Public School System.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES</h2>\n<p>The implementation strategies which form the foundation for the Yonkers public schools Educational Improvement Plan shall include:</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>School Closings</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The district shall close the following schools effective September, 1986:</p>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1541</span>\n    School # 6\n    School # 10\n    School # 11\n    School # 32\n    School # 34\n    Fermi Middle School\n    Hawthorne Middle School\n    Yonkers High School\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>Elementary Schools</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The district shall operate the following elementary schools effective September, 1986:</p>\n    School # 5\n    School # 8\n    School # 9\n    School # 13\n    School # 14\n    School # 16\n    School # 17\n    School # 19\n    School # 21\n    School # 22\n    School # 23\n    School # 26\n    School # 28\n    School # 29\n    School # 30\n    Enrico Fermi\n<p>The attendance zones for these schools shall be those areas set forth in Appendix A. During the 1986-87 school year, the Board shall develop and begin to implement attendance area magnet programs designated for School 19 and Enrico Fermi, to open September 1987.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. <i>Dedicated Magnet Schools</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The district shall operate dedicated magnet schools to reduce racial/ethnic isolation by attracting students to programs that emphasize areas of special interest. Students will be recruited to leave their regular attendance zone school to enroll in schools that have no specific attendance zone. The district shall operate the following district-wide dedicated magnet schools effective September, 1986:</p>\n<blockquote>School # 10  Early Childhood Center (Pre-K)</blockquote>\n<blockquote>PEARLS  Gifted and Talented (Pre K-6) Hudson River Museum Junior High School  Science, Social Studies and Creative Arts, Gifted and Talented (7-9)</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Saunders Trades, Technical, Business and Computer High School (and Academic Magnet Component)</blockquote>\n<p>Until the new Hudson River Junior High School is completed the 7-9 Gifted and Talented magnet program currently housed in Emerson and Mark Twain will be moved to Hawthorne. In addition, the 4-6 Gifted and Talented component of the PEARLS program planned for September, 1986 will also be housed in Hawthorne. Upon opening of the Hudson River Junior High School Hawthorne shall house the PEARLS program Pre K-6. Until the new Hudson River Junior High School is completed, the Pre K-3 component of the PEARLS program will be housed in School # 32.</p>\n<p>Admission criteria for dedicated magnet schools, as well as for other magnet and specialized programs, will be submitted to a court appointed Monitor by June 1, 1986 for the magnet schools and programs to be implemented in September 1986 and by January 15, 1987 for the magnet schools and programs to be implemented in September 1987. Any party may offer its comments on such criteria to the Monitor. This procedure will be followed whenever a new program is slated to commence in the ensuing school term. All magnet students will take the required subjects and course work necessary for promotion and graduation, and all high school magnet students will have the opportunity to meet college entrance requirements. By June 15, 1986 the Board shall provide the Monitor and the parties with a description of the academic magnet program to be offered at Saunders.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4. <i>Attendance Area Magnet Schools</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The district shall operate the following attendance area magnet schools effective September, 1986:</p>\n<blockquote>School # 18  Scholastic Academy for Traditional Education (K-6)</blockquote>\n<blockquote>School # 25  Science, Social Studies, Physical Development, Creative Arts, Extended Day (K-6)</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1542</span> School # 27  Montessori, Humanities and Creative Arts, Extended Day (K-6) Martin Luther King  High Technology Computer Assisted Instruction, Extended Day (K-6)</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Burroughs Junior High School  Career Development and Pre-Vocational (7-9)</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Emerson Junior High School  Performing and Visual Arts, Multilingual Education (7-9)</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Mark Twain Junior High School  Physical Development (7-9)</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Gorton Senior High School  Pre-Professional Magnet Program (10-12)</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Lincoln Senior High School  Performing Arts Magnet Program (10-12)</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Roosevelt Senior High School  Communication Arts Magnet Program (10-12)</blockquote>\n<p>Effective September 1987, the following additional attendance area magnet schools will be opened:</p>\n<blockquote>School # Multilanguage Options  Global Perspective (K-6)</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Enrico Fermi  Computer Assisted Instruction and Performing Arts (K-6)</blockquote>\n<p>The attendance zones for all of the attendance area magnet schools are set forth in Appendix A.</p>\n<p>For the first year of this Order the attendance area elementary magnet school will be integrated by admission policy which will afford an opportunity for enrollment to all students in the district to the maximum extent consistent with the integrative goals of the Order. In implementing this policy the Board may impose such limitations as shall be appropriate to achieve its objectives.</p>\n<p>At the secondary level attendance area students and interested magnet students from throughout the district will be selected by application controlling for racial and ethnic balance.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>5. <i>Voluntary Student Transfers  VST</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The district shall direct a Voluntary Student Transfer program permitting minority students who attend predominantly minority schools to transfer to non-minority schools. Conversely, white students attending predominantly white schools may transfer to predominantly minority schools of their choice for the same reason. The purpose of such transfers is to enhance the racial/ethnic balance of the receiving school. Such transfers will not be permitted, however, if they would adversely impact on the racial composition of either the receiving or the sending school.</p>\n<p>To encourage Voluntary Student Transfers, enrichment and supplemental programs will be established in those schools where sufficient seating capacity has been identified.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. SCHOOL DISTRICT ORGANIZATION</h2>\n<p>The district shall establish a K-6, 7-9, 10-12 grade pattern organization as follows:</p>\n<p></p>\n<pre>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1543</span>\n                                                                                         CIS = Compensatory Infusion Services\n                   PROPOSED ORDERSCHOOL                                                 CAI = Computer Assisted Instruction\n                   DISTRICT REORGANIZATION                                               VST = Voluntary Student Transfer\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n|   School   |    Current Organization   |       Proposed Organization          |              Program Description<sup>[*]</sup>               |\n|------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| #5         |  K-6 Neighborhood School  |  K-6 Neighborhood VST School         |  Writing to Read; Kindermath                       |\n| #6         |  K-6 Neighborhood School  |  CLOSED                              |  -                                                 |\n| #8         |  K-6 Neighborhood School  |  K-6 Neighborhood VST School         |  Project Zoo                                       |\n| #9         |  K-6 Neighborhood School  |  K-6 Neighborhood School             |  -                                                 |\n| #10        |  K-6 Neighborhood School  |  Early Childhood Center              |  Early Childhood Center (PreK)                     |\n| #13        |  K-6 Neighborhood School  |  K-6 Neighborhood School             |  Writing to Read                                   |\n| #14        |  K-6 Neighborhood School  |  K-6 Neighborhood VST School         |  Project Zoo                                       |\n| #16        |  K-6 Neighborhood School  |  K-6 Neighborhood School             |  -                                                 |\n| #17        |  K-6 Neighborhood School  |  K-6 Neighborhood School             |  Writing to Read; Kindermath                       |\n| #18        |  K-6 Neighborhood School  |  K-6 Attendance Area Magnet          |  Scholastic Academy for Traditional Ed.; CIS       |\n| #19        |  K-6 Neighborhood School  |  K-6 Attend.

INTEGRATION GOALS AND TIME-TABLE</h2>\n<p>The District shall seek to achieve the following levels of desegregation as measured by the percentage of students attending desegregated schools at the respective grade pattern organizational levels:</p>\n<p></p>\n<pre>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1544</span>\n   Start of        % of Elementary        % of Junior          % of Senior\n  School Year         Students           High Students        High Students\n  1986-1987              50%                100%                  100%\n  1987- *               100%                100%                  100%\n</pre>\n<p>For purposes of this Order and at the present time, a desegregated school shall be defined as within plus or minus 20 percentage points of the districtwide average of minority students, (the relevant minority population is comprised of Black and Hispanic students), for that grade pattern organization level; if the school is a dedicated magnet or an attendance area magnet, however, it is desegregated if its minority enrollment is within plus or minus 15 percentage points of the districtwide average of minority students at that grade pattern organization level during the first year of operation and plus or minus 10 percentage points of the districtwide average for that grade pattern organization level in the second year of operation.</p>\n<p>* In the Spring of 1987, the Court will evaluate the progress made by the Board in the implementation of the voluntary aspects of this order for the purpose of establishing an appropriate timetable for the achievement of such goals. The Board shall report to the Court on March 16, 1987 the extent to which its plan has succeeded in achieving these goals through voluntary transfers. Should sufficient majority race students not voluntarily transfer from identifiably white schools and/or sufficient minority students not transfer to identifiably white schools, the Board shall propose its plan for accomplishing the desegregation of all its schools. The parties shall submit their comments to this proposal two weeks thereafter and, if necessary, the Court shall schedule an evidentiary hearing before ordering into effect a proposal to fully integrate Yonkers elementary schools through such techniques as enrollment caps, the redrawing of elementary school attendance lines, and other measures. To permit possible utilization of redrawn elementary school attendance lines, the Board shall submit to the Court and the parties, no later than January 5, 1987, its proposal for such lines drawn consistently with the criteria set forth in the Court's Opinion and Proposed Order of April 22, 1986. The extent to which any redrawn elementary school attendance lines would be effective for September 1987 would depend upon the progress made by the Board in implementating the voluntary aspects of this Order. Depending upon the degree of that progress, the Court may order implementation of the redrawn attendance lines in whole, in part or not at all.</p>\n<p>Those schools which do not meet the district's integration goals and which remain predominantly minority during the transition period shall provide supplemental educational services.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. STUDENT ASSIGNMENT</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>Recruitment</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In order to maximize the extent to which the integrative goals of this order will be reached through voluntary student assignments, the administration of the Yonkers public school system will establish an intense recruitment phase which will include the following activities:</p>\n<blockquote>· dissemination of brochures and fliers describing the new program options throughout the city</blockquote>\n<blockquote>· direct mailing of program options and descriptions to all parents</blockquote>\n<blockquote>· newspaper, billboard and radio and cable television announcements of available magnet programs</blockquote>\n<blockquote>· publication of all recruitment material in Spanish and Arabic</blockquote>\n<blockquote>· school based recruitment meetings conducted by building administrators and central office staff</blockquote>\n<blockquote>· telephone recruitment centers, English and Bilingual, through which parents will be called directly to explain magnet programs</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1545</span> · telephone hotline to respond to inquiries</blockquote>\n<blockquote>· acceptance of initial registration by telephone as appropriate</blockquote>\n<blockquote>· community meetings with minority groups and organizations to solicit support and assistance in the dissemination of magnet program availability</blockquote>\n<blockquote>· door to door canvass by district personnel to explain magnet program availability</blockquote>\n<blockquote>· magnet fair in which students and their parents will be transported to central display centers with movies, slides and material available for briefing</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>Selection</i>\n</h2>\n<p>A fundamental aspect of the implementation procedures in the Remedy proposal will be the requirement that all parents must select the schools which their children will attend for September 1986 even if it is the attendance area school. Parents must indicate their first three choices for 1986-87. For the first year, no student will be admitted into any school, magnet school, or attendance area school without the parent having indicated that selection as one of the three choices. The Board shall make every effort to assign each student to the optimum choice school listed on his or her choice form.</p>\n<p>For 1987-88, the parent or guardian of each student in the district will again be required (as early in the school year as is deemed feasible but no later than March 1, 1987) to submit to the Board in writing a school choice form listing three choices for his or her child. For the 1987-88 school term, at least one of the child's choices must be a school where that child's attendance will further the goals of desegregation as defined in this order. Again, the Board shall make every effort to assign each student to the optimum choice school listed on his or her form. The same procedure will be followed in subsequent years for students living in the district but attending public school for the first time, students born in the district who are beginning school, students transferring into the district, and students moving from one grade organizational level to the next (e.g., from junior high to high school).</p>\n<p>This procedure will begin immediately after the issuance of this Order. In subsequent years, as much planning lead time shall be provided as is possible. The objective of requiring three options is to force a choice and thereby inform parents of the availability of magnet program options and encourage their selection. All applications will be logged and numbered and a receipt given for each application. Only one application per child will be accepted. The procedure would be initiated immediately after issuance of the Order and certainly before the end of the 1985-86 school year. In subsequent years, it would be initiated early in the school year to provide as much planning lead time as possible for the district and for parents. In addition to selection forms and program descriptions which will be mailed to all parents in the district, building principals, counselors and teachers will be required to meet with parents and review the options available to them.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>(a) Admission Criteria</h2>\n<p>After the initial selection phase has been completed, the district shall use the following process for admission into the magnet schools provided it does not prevent the district from achieving its goal for desegregation:</p>\n<blockquote>For those magnet schools or programs in which the requests of qualified students do not exceed stated capacity, those students will be immediately notified and admitted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>For those magnet schools or programs in which the requests of qualified students are greater than stated capacity, first priority will be given to those students already enrolled. Then, a random selection will be conducted on the basis of desired integrative goals. Such random selection will be conducted publicly with observers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>For those students whose first choice of a magnet school is not granted, the parents will be individually contacted to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1546</span> reaffirm the desirability of the second or third choice. Every effort shall be made at this stage to encourage the parents to accept the second or third choice of a magnet school. For those students who are placed on a waiting list at the request of the parents because of the unavailability of space, a requirement will be established that they must reapply during the next recruitment phase but will be given preference provided that the granting of such preference will not adversely impact the racial/ethnic balance of the school.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>If admission criteria are met, every preference shall be given to the siblings of children already enrolled in magnet schools provided that such admission does not adversely impact on the racial/ethnic balance of the magnet school.</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>(b) Sibling Preference</h2>\n<p>When more applications for vacancies in a school or program are received than there are seats available, all applications will be randomly selected. After random selection, a rank-ordered waiting list, based on the random selection, will be developed. Names of siblings not initially accepted will be placed at the top of the rank-ordered waiting list. If only one twin is accepted the other twin will also be enrolled provided that whatever admission criteria exist, if any, are met.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>(c) Admission to Specialized Programs</h2>\n<p><i>Gifted and Talented</i> students selected for participation in the district's Gifted and Talented Magnet Programs are those who, by virtue of potential and/or achievement, are capable of high academic performance. Eligibility for the program is determined for each applicant following a careful analysis of standardized test scores, report card information, teacher input (on learning, task commitment, creativity and leadership) and parent input when possible. Entrance examinations will be included at the fourth grade level and above. All available information will be recorded and handled through a weighted matrix traditionally used for the selection of Gifted and Talented students. (Baldwin Matrix). On the basis of the test scores of the students who apply, a cut-off point will be determined and then students shall be admitted on a racial/ethnic balanced basis. It is anticipated that the selection will be geared toward the top five percent over the district cut-off point or points on multi-measures. Student selection shall be made to ensure a balanced racial/ethnic student composition and will be conducted by a committee of at least three administrators, to include at least one of whom would be minority.</p>\n<p>Enrollment in these programs continues from one grade level to the next provided a student is achieving at the expected rate and level and the parents desire program continuation. A student may be counseled out of the program if progress is poor and/or the program is not in the student's best interest.</p>\n<p><i>Citywide High School Career Specialty Magnet Programs</i> will enroll students who have a sincere interest and believe they have the ability to succeed. Prior to submitting an application for such a program, counseling services will be provided so that there is reasonable expectation that the student will meet the success. The student and parent will be provided with information clearly outlining the schools' programs, expectations, and course requirements. If the number of applicants exceeds the available space, students will be selected based upon aptitude for the specific area, teacher recommendation, report card information and attendance patterns. These data will be weighted and ranked to ensure balanced racial/ethnic participation. Student selection will be made by a team of at least three administrators, at least one of whom shall be a minority member.</p>\n<p><i>The Performing and Visual Arts Magnets</i> will accept applications from interested students who must also undergo an audition in their specific areas of interest. These areas include Dance, Drama, Vocal and Instrumental Music. Selection will be made on the basis of specific criteria for each performing arts area. Student selection will be made to ensure racial/ethnic <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1547</span> balance and selection will be made by a group of at least three performing arts teachers, at least one of whom shall be minority member.</p>\n<p>Students applying for Fine Arts and Graphic Arts programs must submit a portfolio of work for review. Selection will be made on the basis of specific criteria for the Visual Arts. Student selection will be made to ensure a racial/ethnic balance and selection will be made by a group of at least three Visual Arts teachers, at least one of whom shall be a minority member.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>(d) Notification of Status</h2>\n<p>Parents or guardians will be notified by mail indicating whether their children have been accepted, or placed on a waiting list for magnet schools or programs. Parents will be asked to confirm their intention to enroll their children in the program into which they have been accepted by mailing back within a stated return period, a confirmation letter which will have been enclosed in their letter of notification.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. <i>Appeal Procedure</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Parents who wish to question admission procedures or appeal the decision of the selection committee will be required to put appeal in writing. The parent first will be invited to discuss the concern with a magnet counselor. If, after the counselor interview, the parent desires to continue the appeal, a Placement Review Committee will review all material and make a final determination of magnet placement. The decisions must not adversely affect the integrative objectives of this Order. If a student cannot be accepted immediately after review, an otherwise qualified student will be placed on a priority waiting list. The Placement Review Committee will be composed of at least three Central Office administrators to be determined by the Superintendent of Schools and will include minority participation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>E. STAFF ASSIGNMENT</h2>\n<p>The district shall make every effort to ensure that by September, 1986, the racial composition of teachers at each school within approximately plus or minus five percentage points of the districtwide average for minority teachers, as a result of reassignments in connection with school closings and conversions and the reassignment of teachers to magnet schools and magnet programs. Thereafter, the district shall attempt to maintain the racial distribution of teachers on a reasonably uniform basis, while respecting the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement between the district and the Yonkers Federation of Teachers.</p>\n<p>If the Board cannot achieve this goal while adhering to the collective bargaining agreement, the parties may make applications to the Court for the requisite modifications.</p>\n<p>With respect to the staffing of magnet programs and magnet schools, the district and the Yonkers Federation of Teachers have agreed to establish a process for selection which would address the mutual concerns of both parties.</p>\n<p>Although the Court denied the application by the NAACP for the adoption of an affirmative action hiring program at this time such ruling is without prejudice to renewal subsequent to March 16, 1987 if it should appear that the aforesaid efforts of the Board and the Yonkers Federation of Teachers have not achieved satisfactory levels of minority staff hiring and distribution throughout the Yonkers school system.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>F. SPECIAL EDUCATION</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>Principles for Administration of Special Education</i>\n</h2>\n<p>· In the administration of its Special Education services, the district shall adhere to the following principles:</p>\n<p>· That handicapped students be guaranteed the same constitutional rights provided all other students</p>\n<p>· That all other regular education interventions and strategies are explored and utilized where appropriate prior to a students referral for and placement in special education programs</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1548</span> That in as much as special education is one among many instructional options encompassed within a continuum of educational services, it is the responsibility of both regular and special education to meet the educational needs of handicapped students, particularly with respect to such areas as occupational education, gifted and talented programs, limited English proficiency services and other magnet programs operated by the school district</p>\n<p>· That to the maximum extent appropriate, handicapped students should be educated with students who are not handicapped and that removal of handicapped students from the regular education environment should occur only when the nature or severity of the handicap is such that education in regular classes with the use of supplementary aids and services cannot be achieved satisfactorily</p>\n<p>· That handicapped students are entitled to the right to due process, and the right to participate in appropriate education programs and activities in the least restrictive environment</p>\n<p>· That the provision of appropriate educational opportunities for handicapped students is based on the identification and evaluation of each student's unique needs</p>\n<p>· That tests and evaluation materials will be non-discriminatory and utilized for the purpose intended</p>\n<p>· That all handicapped students and their parents should be afforded the protections of procedural due process in the identification, evaluation and placement within special education, including collection, use and dissemination of all data developed by the district for that purpose.</p>\n<p>· That handicapped students be grouped for classroom placement by age-appropriate functioning level, and that such groupings reflect the system-wide racial/ethnic composition of all like special education groups at that functioning level, the only exception to this racial/ethnic criterion for grouping shall be those groupings designed for the provision of bilingual special education services</p>\n<p>· As legally mandated, each student receiving special education services will have an annual program review by the Committee on the Handicapped in order to evaluate the appropriateness and effectiveness of program placement and services and also a triennal assessment for the purpose of determining the need for continuation, change, or termination of special education services</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>Criteria for Location of Special Education Program Within Individual Schools</i>\n</h2>\n<p>· Programs for the following students; secondary  resource (R); secondary  learning problems (L); and secondary  emotional problems (E), will be placed in all junior and senior high schools with attendance zones to enable students receiving these programs to attend school in their income attendance zone.</p>\n<p>· Programs for the following students; elementary  resource (R); elementary  learning problems (L); and elementary  emotional problems (E), will be placed in attendance zone elementary schools to the extent possible. In the absence of adequate numbers of students of like functioning level in each elementary attendance zone school, programs for students of like functioning level will be placed in schools closest to their attendance zone school.</p>\n<p>· Programs providing services to elementary students who are educable mentally retarded (ER); hearing impaired (H); and neurologically impaired (N), will be placed in schools located in approximately the center of the city so that transportation is kept at a minimal level.</p>\n<p>· Programs providing services to secondary students who are educable mentally retarded (ER); hearing impaired (H); and neurologically impaired (N), will be placed in each attendance zone secondary school to the maximum extent possible based upon the numbers of students requiring such services. In the absence of sufficient numbers of students of like functioning levels, students will be placed in schools closest to their attendance zone schools.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1549</span> · Programs for \"low incidence\" handicapping conditions providing services to elementary and secondary students who are trainable mentally retarded (TR); speech and language impaired (SL); gifted learning disabled (HL); bilingual handicapped (LB); multiple handicapped (MH); physically or orthopedically handicapped (PH); Rockland Day Treatment Program (E-YDT); Yonkers Learning Center (EYLC); diagnostic (D), and emotionally disturbed students with non-aggressive behavior (EN), will be placed in schools compatible with the unique needs of the students and the regular education programs within the schools.</p>\n<p>· Programs providing speech (Spch) or vision (Vis) resource services for handicapped students whose only special education needs are these services will be provided to the students in their attendance zone schools.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. <i>Guidelines for the Assignment of Special Education Students into Programs Within Schools</i>\n</h2>\n<p>· Transportation shall be provided to special education students where their homes are one and one-half miles from their assigned schools. Such transportation shall not exceed forty minutes of travel time and shall be scheduled to ensure that the school day affords a full day of instruction. Transportation will be provided to any special education students regardless of their residence and school program if the Committee on the Handicapped (COH) determines that the handicapping condition is such that transportation is required.</p>\n<p>· Special education students shall have the opportunity to be mainstreamed in accordance with their Individual Education Program (I.E.P.).</p>\n<p>· The district shall make every effort to maintain elementary special education students in their assigned K-6 school in order to ensure continuity of program. In the absence of an appropriate program in the assigned elementary school, the special education student may be reassigned to a different school only once. However, a change in placement by the COH overrides this one time only reassignment.</p>\n<p>· Special education students are ensured access to all district extra curricular activities and, in addition, will be provided the necessary transportation.</p>\n<p>· Special education students are ensured access to all regular education occupational and magnet programs. Applicants for such programs will be required to complete the application process and to be diagnosed for career options by a professional. The assessment will be made available to the COH for recommendation.</p>\n<p>· The district shall make every effort to ensure that the racial/ethnic composition of students of like functioning level student groupings shall reflect the composition of students of like functioning levels on a districtwide basis.</p>\n<p>· Special education students will be placed in classes designed to meet their needs and not assigned to integrate schools.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4. <i>Guidelines for the Placement of Limited English Proficient (LEP) Students into Special Education Classes</i>\n</h2>\n<p>· Limited English Proficient (LEP) students who are of foreign birth or ancestry, who speak little or no English, and who have scored below the statewide reference point on an English language proficiency test, and who are referred to the COH for possible Special Education, should be further assessed for language dominance in their native language in order to ascertain the language to be used for further assessment.</p>\n<p>· The use of tests for potentially handicapped LEP students will be non-biased and non-discriminatory in accord with the most current research. LEP students will be assessed by diagnosticians proficient in the child's native language, where available. In the absence of such a diagnostician, the student will be provided a translator during the assessment process. In this event, the COH will ensure the use of non-verbal assessment instruments as well. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1550</span> A native language representative will assist the parent/guardian and student in all aspects of the evaluation, diagnostic, and due process procedures.</p>\n<p>· Placement of the LEP child will be based on the student's functioning level and native language proficiency.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>G. BILINGUAL EDUCATION</h2>\n<p>The district shall continue to meet the needs of all Limited English Proficient students under this Order and the FLAME and multilingual programs shall not be considered a substitute for bilingual education.</p>\n<p>English proficient Hispanic (monolingual or bilingual) students who are not eligible for the bilingual education program according to the State regulations will be assigned in accordance with the requirements of this order. Former LEP Students who have achieved English language proficiency and/or have been in a program of bilingual education of ESL for three years will be mainstreamed and provided the same opportunity to participate in all educational aspects of this Order. Bilingual education and ESL staff will be assigned according to need, i.e., the numbers of LEP students in a building, consistent with the reassignment of students throughout the district.</p>\n<p>By June 1, 1986, the Board shall designate where bilingual programs shall be offered at both the elementary and secondary level for the 1986-87 school year and outline how it shall provide language assistance for Hispanic students that wish to enroll in special magnet programs.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>H. TRANSPORTATION</h2>\n<p>Under this Order, transportation will be provided:</p>\n<blockquote>· to those students who elect to enroll in Magnet Schools</blockquote>\n<blockquote>· to those students who elect to participate in the voluntary student transfer program</blockquote>\n<blockquote>· to those students who are required to travel in excess of 1½ miles to their neighborhood school</blockquote>\n<blockquote>· to parochial students who live within the City of Yonkers and who travel more than 1½ miles to their school within the City of Yonkers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>· to those adults currently enrolled in the Adult Programs located in the old Commerce building when it is relocated to School # 31.</blockquote>\n<p>When student assignments are established, a consultant transportation firm shall be contracted by the district to develop a safe, reasonable, and manageable transportation program that will be equitable in terms of burden for both majority and minority students.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. HUMAN RELATIONS</h2>\n<p>The district shall implement a human relations program specifically designed to achieve the following objectives:</p>\n<blockquote>· To increase alternatives of administrators in analyzing potential inter and intra group problems and promoting group cooperation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>· To improve communications among administrators, teachers, students and community.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>· To enhance the awareness of administrators, school personnel and students of diverse cultural backgrounds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>· To increase the training of a cadre of administrators and teaching personnel to facilitate the use of Human Relations experiences with students.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>· To provide students with experiences which will assist them in developing and facilitating communication, decision making and problem solving skills.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>· To assist students in developing an understanding of their rights and responsibilities as members of the school community.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>· To provide an atmosphere in which the school community will be assured of the safe transport of its students to and from school.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>· The district shall implement the schedule of activities related to human relations, staff development and community education included in Appendix B of this Order.</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1551</span> J. FUNDING</h2>\n<p>It is anticipated that the necessary funding will be provided by the City of Yonkers, and the Board is to advise the Court forthwith if for any reason it is unable to implement the programs set forth herein because of a lack of adequate funding.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>K. ASSURANCES</h2>\n<p>· The Board shall establish a comprehensive staff development program which will be a component of its ongoing inservice program for teachers and administrators and which will address areas such as racial attitudes, student discipline procedures, academic achievement and performance goals, teaching in a diverse racial/ethnic environment, and integration goals.</p>\n<p>· The Board shall provide students equal access to extra-curricular activities. To facilitate such participation, it shall provide appropriate after school transportation for students eligible for transportation.</p>\n<p>· In the implementation of this Order, the Board shall provide a comprehensive program of information to the community, including committees of parents and other members of the public who have a particular interest in the issues that may arise during implementation, and to staff in an effort to attain maximum participation in all aspects of the integrative component of this Order including but not limited to media, community meetings, brochures, leaflets, and other recruitment activities. Plaintiffs-Intervenors shall encourage members of the minority community to support the integrative components of this Order.</p>\n<p>· The Board shall ensure that with respect to the use of any desegregation techniques such as school closing or openings, site selections and new construction, and boundary adjustments, its policies and practices shall be consistent with the integrative purpose of this Order, as well as the principles of sound management and administration of the school district.</p>\n<p>· The Board shall ensure that this Order is afforded every opportunity for successful implementation through the provision of a comprehensive program of information to the community as well as appropriate human relations programs for staff and students.</p>\n<p>· The Board shall ensure that its Code of Disciplinary Standards is publicized and that clear and adequate notification is provided all students, parents, teachers and administrators of such standards and of the non-discriminatory application of these disciplinary procedures.</p>\n<p>· The Board shall ensure that the location of transfer of ESL/Bilingual programs in its elementary and secondary schools take place in a manner which will not detract from the objectives of this Order while ensuring that sufficient numbers of students requiring such services are enrolled at each location in order to justify the provision of bilingual or ESL programs. Ample provision shall be made to enable, to the maximum extent possible, students desiring bilingual programs to participate in the dedicated and area attendance magnet programs described elsewhere herein.</p>\n<p>· The Board shall ensure that it continue its obligation to fully implement the terms and conditions of its existing agreements with the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights and the New York State Education Department which have been designed to ensure compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, P.L. 94-142, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended and the New York Commissioner of Education's Regulations regarding the provision of special education.</p>\n<p>· The Board shall ensure, to the maximum extent possible, that racial isolation does not occur within any school building or program operated by the Board.</p>\n<p>· The Board shall ensure the provision of remediation to those students scoring below the State Reference Point in the State mandated Pupil Evaluation Program in the basic subject areas of reading and mathematics. In addition, the Board shall encourage the participation of those students in need of remediation in these magnet <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1552</span> programs specifically designed to improve student achievement levels in the basic skills areas.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>L. MONITORING</h2>\n<p>Each party, after consultation with the others, shall suggest to the Court one or more candidates for Monitor.</p>\n<p>The nominees must be both qualified and willing to serve, and his or her specified compensation shall be borne by the school district. A Monitor shall be empowered to request specific information from the school district relevant to implementation of this Order. She/he shall issue reports to the Court and the parties assessing different aspects of implementation of the remedy and shall be empowered to make recommendations to the Court with respect to changes she/he believes necessary to make the plan more effective. The Board and the other parties shall make their recommendations within five (5) days from the date of this Order.</p>\n<p>Once a Monitor is appointed, one of his/her preliminary tasks shall be assessment of the school district's admissions criteria for the magnet schools and magnet programs. These criteria shall be submitted to the Monitor by June 1, 1986 for those programs that are continuing or will be beginning in September, 1986. Admissions criteria for programs slated to commence in September, 1987 will be submitted to the Monitor by January 15, 1987 and the same procedures will be followed. Any party may at each time offer comments on these admissions criteria.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>M. PARENT COORDINATOR</h2>\n<p>The parent coordinator shall be responsible for working with parents in recruitment and information dissemination and for developing a working relationship with parent organizations in the community. The parent coordinator also shall foster communication with non-English speaking parents.

Services and Programs</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Educational Improvement Plan</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Yonkers Public Schools</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>SUPPORTIVE SERVICES AND PROGRAM</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>Staff Development</i>\n</h2>\n<p>A comprehensive staff development plan to assist administrators and teachers in the implementation of new programs for September will begin in the Summer of 1986.</p>\n<p>Beginning in June, the New York State Education Department's National Diffusion Network Team will conduct a series of inservice workshops for teachers for six separate programs included in the Remedy Proposal:</p>\n<blockquote>(a) Project Zoo</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(b) Kindermath Program</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(c) Project Ecology</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(d) The Early Prevention of School Failure Program</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(e) The Starwalk Program</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(f) Every Child a Winner</blockquote>\n<p>Additional workshops will focus on two special programs being provided to staff at every Voluntary Student Transfer (VST) site. These programs are the <i>Talents Unlimited Program</i> and the <i>Student Team Leadership Program.</i> A special cadre of teachers and principals from these VST schools will be trained as turnkey facilitators who in turn will train other teachers and administrators in other VST schools which will house identical programs.</p>\n<p>The new Comprehensive Staff Development Plan is based upon the New York State Education Department guidelines recommending a full day program for all teachers. Additional activities derived from a needs assessments and understanding of district goals are also incorporated into the Plan.</p>\n<p>In addition, Staff Development activities in preparation for September, 1986 will include a minimum of three days of intensive training and five action workshops to be held during August, 1986 and which will be designed exclusively to provide the necessary program skills for every teacher assigned to a districtwide magnet program.</p>\n<p>Over the course of the summer and continuing through the entire school year, university professors representing Sarah Lawrence College will work with teachers in developing and expanding curriculum for the Foreign Language and Multicultural Educational (FLAME) Programs located at School 30 and also School 22. Teachers College, Columbia University will assist with the PEARLS Program.</p>\n<p>State University of New York's Partnership Consortium and the State will work with teachers in the Aesthetics and Science Programs located at Martin Luther King Jr., Fermi and Emerson; Iona College of New Rochelle will concentrate on computer programs located throughout the district, particularly in Martin Luther King; St. Joseph's Hospital, affiliated with the Medical and Health Magnet at Gorton High School, and a pool of other kinds of needed training for staff to ensure the successful implementation of the total instructional program in September.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>Remediation</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Remediation is not separate, but part of the total education process. It is an ongoing process and takes place when students are identified through a variety of sources including but not limited to teacher observations, New York State mandated tests, and districtwide evaluation procedures.</p>\n<p>A formal process in the early identification of pupils who need special help in developing the basic skills of reading comprehension, mathematics, and writing is required by the Yonkers Remediation Program. Early identification and the monitoring of pupil progress in developing these skills are important features of the current program and will continue to be emphasized under this Order.</p>\n<p>The basic criteria for determining remedial instruction is based on student test scores on the mandated New York State Tests administered in Grades 3, 5, 6, and 8. However, when a student falls below the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1573</span> State Reference Point on these tests, the following process takes place;</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Stage I</i></h2>\n<p><i>Parental Notification:</i> A standardized reporting form is sent to parents. The form includes the students' scores and the content and scope of the instructional program. The form indicates the remediation teacher and provides an opportunity for parents to receive recommendations on how to assist in the reinforcement of the identified remedial area(s).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Stage II</i></h2>\n<p><i>Student Participation:</i> Students receive both individualized and small group instruction from their classroom teacher and/or from the reading and math specialist.</p>\n<p>The students' progress is monitored through the Yonkers Remediation district Program which consists of an outline of skills necessary to master the basics in the content areas of reading, mathematics and writing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Stage III</i></h2>\n<p><i>Termination of Pupil Participation in the Yonkers Remedial Program:</i> When a pupil is provided remediation for a period of time (not less than six months) and there is strong evidence that the remediation is no longer needed, the student is re-tested with the appropriate New York State test for the grade level. This opportunity is given to the student in February and June.</p>\n<p>If the appropriate passing scores have been achieved, a student is removed from the remedial program. The decision to end remediation must be supported by all available information and be endorsed by the classroom teacher.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Stage IV</i></h2>\n<p><i>Parental Notification:</i> Parents are also notified when the remedial program is terminated. Written notice, containing the reason for ending the program, is provided. If parents request that remedial programs be continued, every effort must be made to accommodate their wishes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Remediation</i></h2>\n<p>The Yonkers public schools will continue to refine its current Remediation Program. Remediation for Yonkers students will not be confined to the above process but will be developed, improved and expanded according to the needs reflected by the student population. It will continue to target those students in the non-desegregative environment during the transitional period and the Yonkers public schools will meet full compliance with the educational goals set forth in this Order.</p>\n<p>The Yonkers program will be incorporated into educational experiences which will include parents as partners in reading; computer literacy training to reinforce basic skills; and the involvement of city library services to encourage reading for lifetime enjoyment.</p>\n<p>\"Thought is Taught\" will be the new motto which will emphasize thinking skills as the prerequisite to all basic skills.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. <i>School Improvement Plan</i>\n</h2>\n<p>A basic component in the new program of instruction mandated by the State of New York, the Regents Action Plan, is the identification of those schools within the State requiring special assistance. Identification of these schools is made in an annual release of a Comprehensive Assessment Report in which the schools are identified according to the following selection indicators:</p>\n<blockquote> Student test data on all pupil evaluation program tests, all Regents preliminary competency tests, all Regents examinations, all occupational education proficiency examinations and all second language proficiency examinations</blockquote>\n<blockquote> Student enrollment by grade</blockquote>\n<blockquote> Number of students transferred into the alternative high school equivalency preparation program</blockquote>\n<blockquote> Data, as required by the commissioner, on diplomas and certificates awarded</blockquote>\n<blockquote> Any additional information which the superintendent of the school district, or the chief administrative officer of the nonpublic school believes will reflect the relative assessment of a school building or district.</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1574</span> The Comprehensive Assessment Report for the Yonkers public school system was released on December 4, 1985, in which 12 schools were identified by the State of New York as in need of special assistance. (The list was subsequently reduced to 11 with the removal of Gorton High School) Each of the schools is located on the west side of the city and all but 3 are predominately minority.</p>\n<p>An integral part of the Comprehensive Assessment Report is the requirement that the Superintendent of Schools, in cooperation with the professional staff, establish a Comprehensive School Improvement Plan (CSIP) which would specify specific measures, procedures, and recommendations which would be undertaken to improve student achievement in the schools identified as being in need of assistance (CAR schools).</p>\n<p>In addition to the Comprehensive School Improvement Plan being developed for the CAR schools, the administration directed that such plans be developed for each school so that a comprehensive assessment of needs, both programmatical and physical, could be provided for the school system. Although the district would be reorganized under this Order, that program will be continued and will follow the guidelines established by the New York State Education Department which are that the Comprehensive School Improvement Plans must be developed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote> In consultation with teachers, administrators and other school personnel</blockquote>\n<blockquote> On an individual school basis for implementation in September of 1986</blockquote>\n<blockquote> On the prescribed format (i.e., including definition of individual school needs, goals, objectives, activities, timelines, and evaluation)</blockquote>\n<blockquote> Using the Effective Schools Model  a grass roots approach to planning for effective change initiated by individual school staffs</blockquote>\n<p>An active program of inservicing of administrators and teachers has been undertaken by the administration for the development of the School Improvement Plan. These activities include the following:</p>\n<blockquote> School administrators have been provided training in preparation for their tasks of acting as turnkey workshop leaders of sessions designed for plan development. These administrative staff development sessions included training by central office personnel, university professors, Metro Center staff and fellow principals who have successfully followed the Effective Schools Model.</blockquote>\n<blockquote> Two half and one full day workshop led by principals were conducted in each school. During these sessions CSIPs were developed and will be refined for presentation to the Superintendent of Schools, Board of Education and (in the case of the eleven CAR identified schools) the New York State Education Department.</blockquote>\n<blockquote> Each school plan will be reviewed for additional assistance required for effective implementation. Beginning in March, six New York State Education Department Effective Schools Consortium representatives will be worked in concert with the eleven CAR identified school principals and staffs in an effort to commence preparation for the plan. They will serve as support personnel along with local curriculum coordinators and Chapter II teacher trainers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote> It should be noted that the selection of these schools was based on data for the 1983-84 school year and significant progress has been made in the improvement of student achievement in many of the schools identified by the State Education Department since that time. These efforts will be encouraged and further developed as the CSIP process unfolds but it must be recognized that many of the schools identified will be changed under this Proposal. The more significant task is to maintain accurate identification of the children attending the CAR schools and to ensure appropriate remediation for them.</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1575</span> 4. <i>Districtwide Program</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The district has developed various curricular models and programs designed to foster an understanding and appreciation of differences among races, cultures and groups. These include programs such as: Student Team Learning, Talents Unlimited, and the Ferguson-Florissant Writing Project. These have been facilitated by ECIA Chapter 2 teacher training to ensure a consistent quality of inservice in these interactive programs. In addition to the classroom models and schoolwide programs, there are many districtwide activities designed to increase interracial exposure and improve intergroup relations.</p>\n<blockquote><i>High School Student Council</i></blockquote>\n<blockquote>At the high school level, the district has established an inter-school student council to promote school improvement projects and to advise the Superintendent of student matters. Five high school students, one from each school, were selected for summer training in leadership and attended a New York State Student Seminar in July, 1985. This group of racially balanced students have given their leadership to the total group. The teacher-advisor for this group is a former <i>NATIONAL TEACHER OF THE YEAR.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote><i>Outward Bound</i></blockquote>\n<blockquote>The district has co-sponsored an Outward Bound Program which sent several high school students throughout the country to learn to survive with other students in a variety of experiences.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><i>Convocation</i></blockquote>\n<blockquote>The district is planning a seventh and eighth grade convocation on relevant topics to bring students together in a problem-solving situation. Future plans include a county-wide convocation under university sponsorship.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><i>Summer School</i></blockquote>\n<blockquote>A centralized summer school program is offered to all high school students and includes counseling services and remedial instruction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><i>Music and Art Fair</i></blockquote>\n<blockquote>The district's Music and Art Fair is the culmination of school-based activities throughout the year and provides an opportunity for interracial exposure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><i>Spelling Bee</i></blockquote>\n<blockquote>The district Spelling Bee is the culmination of classroom, school and area bees of all elementary schools. In addition to the English Spelling bee competitions, simultaneous competitions are also conducted in Spanish.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><i>Interschool Trips</i></blockquote>\n<blockquote>As part of the district's program with the Westchester Council of the Arts, cultural trips are planned for several elementary schools. In addition, interschool trips for specific school events are sponsored to provide for interracial exposure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><i>Yonkers Educational and Cultural Arts Center</i></blockquote>\n<blockquote>The restoration of this beautiful turn-of-the-century mansion has truly been the result of community and school district interest and shared support. Students from the Saunders Trades and Technical High School's architectural department restored the building; community members donated money and resources; horticulture students from other district high schools beautified the grounds; and Culinary Arts students prepare meals for community events and public fetes. In addition, it serves as a teacher training facility and conference center open to the entire county.</blockquote>\n<p>In order to achieve the district's goals of creating a multicultural environment and reducing ethnic and racial isolation, the district will continue to support and expand multi-cultural activities.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>5. <i>Facilities</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The infrastructure of the Yonkers public schools has been in a deteriorating state for many years due to the lack of capital funding. The situation in some of the schools within the City has approached a state of alarm in terms of physical condition, let alone the learning environment of children and for staff.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1576</span> It is to be noted that the district has a comprehensive Capital Improvement Program extending over the next five years and the rehabilitation needs of the facilities throughout the district are clearly severe. Every effort shall be made to continue the efforts of the district to obtain additional funding to continue the rehabilitation program which will be initiated under the $11.3 million bond program.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>6. <i>Extra-Curricular Programs</i>\n</h2>\n<p>There is a very comprehensive extra-curricular program in the Yonkers public school system, including interscholastic sports, intramural activities, and a variety of other activities related to student clubs, newspaper, drama clubs, bands, musical shows and other programs for students' interests and activity preferences. In order to ensure equality in terms of participation and availability of extra-curricular activity to students who attend Magnet School or who transfer voluntarily to enhance integration, the district will:</p>\n<p> ensure that transportation is available after school for those students who wish to participate in extra-curricular activities and who are transported to school.</p>\n<p> establish pre-determined pick-up and drop-off points for students participating in extra-curricular programs to ensure safety and reasonableness in terms of distance and time.</p>\n<p>In addition, the district will closely monitor the racial/ethnic composition of the extra-curricular program in each school to maintain an appropriate and desirable balance. Recruitment efforts will be established within each school to assist in the efforts to provide such a balance.</p>\n<p>Extra-curricular programs shall be based on need, interest and preference of the students, both in area attendance zone, as well as for those students who voluntarily transfer to the school for racial/ethnic integration purposes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>7. <i>Compensatory Infusion Programs</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Those schools which do not meet the district's integration goals and which remain predominantly minority during the transition period will be eligible for intensive compensatory programs. These will include smaller class sizes, additional reading teachers, reading aides and trained mathematics specialists and aides who will provide individually guided instruction in small groups, using special materials and newly equipped labs. Transitional schools will also be eligible for increased guidance, psychological, and social work services to ensure an optimum learning environment.</p>\n<p>Moreover, a summer school program for low achieving students is planned to mitigate the effects of \"summer loss\" and to provide additional instructional time. Prevention of future school failure is the goal of the group counseling component.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>8. <i>Chapter I Services</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The Chapter I funds provided to the Yonkers public schools currently supports reading teachers, mathematic teachers, ESL teachers and teacher support in 10 elementary schools and two middle schools. The students who are receiving these services and who are entitled to receive these services will continue to receive them under the Remedy Proposal in one of two major ways:</p>\n<p> Those schools under the new organization with a high percentage of eligible students will receive full time supplemental staff for small group remediation instruction in reading, mathematics, and ESL. In addition, instructional material and equipment will also be provided.</p>\n<p> In those schools where there are small numbers of eligible students, instruction will be provided in a resource model or a tutorial model. In those instances, Chapter I funds will be provided to support the additional teacher time required.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]   All neighborhood schools will also have a common core of enrichment programs. The programs described here are above and beyond\nthe common core.</p>\n<p>[**]   And a strong academic Magnet component the precise nature of which shall be recommended by the district and which may be\ncommenced on a grade-a-year basis.</p>\n<p>[***]   Subject to the Court's final decision regarding Whitman following completion of the housing portion of the remedy hearings and without\nprejudice to that decision.</p>\n\n</div>",
