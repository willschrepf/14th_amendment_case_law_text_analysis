Dominguez brought suit against Don A. Gilbert, Commissioner of the Texas\r\nHealth and Human Services Commission (\"the Department\"), and Sharon Thompson, Director of\r\nMedicaid Program Integrity, Office of Investigations and Enforcement (\"Medicaid Enforcement\"),\r\nseeking a writ of mandamus to compel the release of documents requested pursuant to the Texas\r\nPublic Information Act.  <em>See </em>Tex. Gov't Code Ann. §§ 552.001-.353 (West 1994 &amp; Supp. 2001)\r\n(\"the Act\").<sup> (1)</sup>  Prior to a hearing before the trial court, the Department produced some of the requested\r\ndocuments but refused to produce others, asserting that they were confidential as a matter of law and\r\ntherefore expressly excepted from disclosure under the Act.  Following a hearing and an <em>in camera</em>\r\ninspection of the withheld documents, the trial court issued an order denying Dominguez's petition\r\nfor writ of mandamus.<sup> (2)</sup>  We will reverse the order and remand the cause to the trial court.<strong></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tIn January 1998, Medicaid Enforcement began investigating Dominguez, a practicing\r\nphysician, for possible Medicaid fraud.  In the course of the investigation, Medicaid Enforcement\r\nobtained Dominguez's actual files, or copies thereof, regarding his treatment of over 700 patients. \r\nAs a result of Medicaid Enforcement's investigation, it sent Dominguez an administrative sanctions\r\nletter.  Following receipt of the letter, Dominguez made a request pursuant to the Act for a complete\r\ncopy of Medicaid Enforcement's investigative file and any other documents relating to the\r\nallegations against him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tDominguez made his request in July 1999.  Thereafter, Dominguez and the\r\nDepartment engaged in settlement negotiations; however, the Department took no action regarding\r\nDominguez's request.  On May 5, 2000, Dominguez filed a petition for writ of mandamus requesting\r\nthat the trial court compel the Department to produce all information related to the investigation for\r\nhis inspection and duplication.  On May 24, the Department sent Dominguez 400 pages that were\r\nresponsive to his request; however, the Department withheld or redacted about 100 pages, which it\r\nmaintained were confidential by law and could not be produced.  In response to Dominguez's\r\npetition in the trial court, the Department filed an answer, asserting that the production of all\r\ndocuments not excepted from disclosure under the Act rendered the cause moot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe trial court conducted a hearing at which both parties presented argument and\r\nDominguez called one witness.  Thereafter, the trial court conducted an <em>in camera</em> inspection of the\r\nwithheld documents and issued an order denying Dominguez's petition for writ of mandamus. \r\nDominguez requested findings of fact and conclusions of law, which appear in the record.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tBecause Dominguez has not seen the disputed documents, he cannot be certain of\r\ntheir contents.  He asserts that the 400 pages in his possession, however, contain references that\r\nindicate that there are other documents that should have been produced.  Dominguez claims that\r\nthese withheld documents are not confidential as a matter of law because they contain information\r\nabout his treatment of his patients, for whom he is the primary-care physician.  He also alleges that\r\nthe documents contain notes made by a physician who reviewed his records on behalf of Medicaid\r\nEnforcement.  Specifically, he maintains that the reviewing physician annotated the patient files,\r\nevaluating the medical necessity of Dominguez's treatment.  According to Dominguez, this\r\nphysician's determination of \"no medical necessity\" forms the basis of the Department's punitive\r\nand costly sanctions against him.  Finally, Dominguez argues that the Department must disclose the\r\ndocuments because it failed to follow the procedural requirements set forth in the Act for requesting\r\na determination from the Attorney General.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe Department asserts that the documents contain confidential information relating\r\nto Medicaid coverage and treatment of Dominguez's patients by other physicians, as well as\r\nDominguez.  The Department argues that federal and state law prohibit the disclosure of such\r\ninformation regarding Medicaid recipients.  While the Department concedes that the documents do\r\ncontain some information regarding Dominguez's treatment of his patients, it denies that the\r\ndocuments contain notes or other work product.  Finally, the Department contends that it delayed\r\ntaking action on Dominguez's written request because the parties were participating in settlement\r\nnegotiations. </p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><strong>DISCUSSION</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>The Texas Public Information Act</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tIt is the policy of the State of Texas that each person is entitled to have \"complete\r\ninformation about the affairs of government and the official acts of public officials and employees.\" \r\nTex. Gov't Code Ann. § 552.001(a) (West 1994).  The primary purpose of the Act is to grant the\r\npeople access to information \"so that they may retain control over the instruments they have\r\ncreated.\"  <em>Id</em>.  \"To that end, the provisions of the Act are to be liberally construed in favor of the\r\ndisclosure of government-held information.\"  <em>Hancock v. State Bd. of Ins</em>., 797 S.W.2d 379, 381\r\n(Tex. App.--Austin 1990, no writ); <em>accord </em>Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 552.001(b) (West 1994).  The\r\nAct defines public information as \"information that is collected, assembled, or maintained under a\r\nlaw or ordinance or in connection with the transaction of official business\" by or for a governmental\r\nbody.  Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 552.002(a) (West Supp. 2001).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tUpon receipt of a request from any person, the officer for public information of a\r\ngovernmental body is required to <em>promptly</em> produce public documents for inspection, duplication,\r\nor both.  <em>Id</em>. § 552.221(a).  If the information is unavailable at the time of the request, or cannot be\r\nproduced within ten business days, the officer is required to notify the requestor in writing and set\r\na date for production within a reasonable time.  <em>Id</em>. § 552.221(c), (d).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tAlthough the Act favors disclosure, it also contains exceptions from disclosure for\r\nover twenty categories of information.  <em>See</em> <em>id.</em> §§ 552.101-.132 (West 1994 &amp; Supp. 2001).  For\r\nexample, an exception prohibits disclosure of \"information considered to be confidential by law,\r\neither constitutional, statutory, or by judicial decision.\"  <em>Id</em>. § 552.101 (West 1994).  If a\r\ngovernmental body wants to withhold information, the Act requires it to request a decision from the\r\nAttorney General about whether an exception can be claimed, unless a previous determination has\r\nalready addressed the exception's applicability to the specific type of information at issue.  Act of\r\nJune 1, 1997, 75th Leg., R.S., ch. 1231, § 5, 1997 Tex. Gen. Laws 4701, 4701 (amended 1999)\r\n(current version at Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 552.301(a) (West Supp. 2001)).  If the governmental\r\nbody is seeking an Attorney General's determination, it must do so in writing within ten business\r\ndays of receiving the request.  <em>Id</em>. (current version at Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 552.301(b) (West\r\nSupp. 2001)).  The Act does not require notice to the requestor that such a determination is being\r\nsought.  <em>See id</em>. (current version at Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 553.301(d) (West Supp. 2001)).<sup> (3)</sup>  The\r\nAct is also silent as to the course of action an agency must take when relying on a previous\r\ndetermination that the information is excepted from disclosure.  <em>See</em> <em>id</em>.  There is no statutory\r\nrequirement that the governmental body give notice to the requestor that it is withholding\r\ninformation in reliance on an earlier determination.  <em>See id.  </em>The failure to seek an Attorney\r\nGeneral's determination <em>when one is required</em> creates a presumption that the information is \"public\r\ninformation.\"  Act of April 30,1993, 73d Leg., R.S., ch. 268, §1, 1993 Tex. Gen. Laws 583, 605\r\n(amended 1999) (current version at Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 552.302 (West Supp. 2001)).</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><strong><em>The Petition for Writ of Mandamus</em></strong><em></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tDominguez argues that because the Department did not timely respond to his\r\napplication or request an Attorney General's determination regarding whether the information was\r\nwithin an exception to the Act, there is a presumption that the information is public.  <em>See</em> <em>id</em>. \r\nHowever, the Department is not required to request a determination when one has already been\r\nissued regarding the exception's applicability to the specific type of information being sought.  Act\r\nof June 1, 1997, 75th Leg., R.S., ch. 1231, § 5, 1997 Tex. Gen. Laws 4701, 4701 (amended 1999). \r\nIn this case, the Attorney General's open records decision number 584 appears to be on point, and\r\nthe Department is entitled to rely on it.  <em>See</em> Tex. Att'y Gen. ORD-584 (1991).  The more prudent\r\ncourse of action would have been for the Department to notify Dominguez that it withheld the\r\ndocuments under an exception to the Act and in reliance on a previous determination.<sup> (4)</sup>  However,\r\nthe Act does not contemplate the automatic disclosure of information as a sanction for the\r\nDepartment's failure to do so.  The issue before us is whether the information qualifies for an\r\nexception under the Act. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tInformation is excepted from disclosure under the Act \"if it is information considered\r\nto be confidential by law, either constitutional, statutory, or by judicial decision.\"  Tex. Gov't Code\r\nAnn. § 552.101.  A governmental body can voluntarily disclose records that it is not required to\r\ndisclose <em>unless</em> those records are \"confidential under law.\" <em>Id</em>. § 552.007(a) (West Supp. 2001).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tFederal law requires that state Medicaid plans provide safeguards restricting the\r\ndisclosure of information concerning applicants and recipients to \"purposes <em>directly connected</em> with\r\nthe administration of the plan.\"  42 U.S.C.A. §1396a(a)(7) (West Supp. 2000) (emphasis added). \r\nPurposes directly connected with the administration of a state Medicaid plan include establishing\r\neligibility, determining the amount of medical assistance, providing services, and conducting an\r\ninvestigation related to administration of the plan.  42 C.F.R. § 431.302 (2000).  At a minimum,\r\nsafeguarded information must include names, addresses, medical services provided, social and\r\neconomic circumstances, agency evaluations of personal information, medical data, income\r\neligibility, and the amount of medical assistance payments.  <em>Id</em>. § 431.305.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tIn Texas, the Medicaid program is administered by the Department.  Tex. Hum. Res.\r\nCode Ann. § 32.021(a) (West Supp. 2001).  State law dictates that it is a misdemeanor for a person\r\nto disclose \"any information\" concerning Medicaid applicants and recipients \"if the information is\r\ndirectly or indirectly derived from the records, papers, files, or communications\" of the Department\r\nor acquired by Department employees in the performance of their official duties.  <em>Id</em>. § 12.003(a)\r\n(West 2001).  The legislature has directed the Department to establish safeguards restricting the\r\ndisclosure of information concerning Medicaid applicants and recipients to \"purposes <em>directly\r\nconnected</em> with the administration\" of Department programs.  <em>Id</em>. § 21.012(a) (emphasis added).  The\r\nAttorney General has determined that information regarding Medicaid clients is excepted from\r\ndisclosure under the Act as \"information deemed confidential by statutory law.\"  <em>See</em> Tex. Att'y Gen.\r\nORD-584 (interpreting sections 12.003 and 21.012 of Texas Human Resources Code and\r\npredecessor to 42 U.S.C.A. § 1396a(a)(7)).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tOn appeal, Dominguez and the Department disagree regarding the contents of the\r\ndisputed documents.  Following its <em>in camera</em> review of those documents, the trial court made a\r\nfinding that the withheld and redacted information pertained only to Medicaid recipients.  This was\r\nthe basis for the court's conclusion that the information was confidential under federal and state law\r\nand thus could not be disclosed.  However, the pages inspected <em>in camera</em> were not submitted with\r\nthe record on appeal.  This court requested the documents under seal from the clerk of the trial court,\r\nonly to learn that they were not of record.  Apparently, they were sent to the trial court judge via hand\r\ndelivery, under cover letter, without a request that the documents be filed or entered as evidence.<sup> (5)</sup> \r\nWe must determine a case on the record as filed.  <em>Mitchison v. Houston Indep. Sch. Dist</em>., 803\r\nS.W.2d 769, 771 (Tex. App.--Houston [14th Dist.] 1991, writ denied).  Therefore, even if the\r\nDepartment could reproduce the documents, we cannot examine them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe appellant usually bears the burden of presenting a trial court record that is\r\nsufficient to show reversible error.  <em>See </em>Tex. R. App. P. 34.6(b); <em>see also Piotrowski v. Minns</em>, 873\r\nS.W.2d 368, 370 (Tex. 1993) (\"The duty to protect the record does not spring into being only at the\r\nconclusion of trial, when the appellant begins the steps to perfect an appeal.\").  However, there are\r\nexceptions to this general rule.  For example, when the court reporter's notes are lost or destroyed\r\nthrough no fault of the appellant, he may be entitled to a new trial.  Tex. R. App. P. 34.6(f); <em>see also\r\nPiotrowski</em>, 873 S.W.2d at 370.  In this instance, where Dominguez had no access to the documents\r\nand they were not offered in open court, the burden to preserve them of record for appellate review\r\nmust lie with the Department.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tThis case presents a dispute analogous to a discovery dispute, in which a party seeks\r\nto avoid producing allegedly privileged documents.  The Texas Supreme Court has stated, as\r\nfollows: </p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\tOnly in certain narrow circumstances is it appropriate to obstruct the search\r\nfor truth by denying discovery.  Very limited exceptions to the strongly preferred\r\npolicy of openness are recognized in our state procedural rules and statutes.  The\r\nburden is on the party seeking to avoid discovery to plead the basis for exemption or\r\nimmunity and to produce evidence supporting that claim. . . . If the trial court\r\ndetermines that an <em>in camera </em>inspection of the requested discovery is necessary, the\r\nmaterials must be segregated and produced to the court. </p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><em>State v. Lowry</em>, 802 S.W.2d 669, 671 (Tex. 1991) (citations omitted).  Furthermore, \"[i]n the absence\r\nof any additional evidence to support the claimed privilege, [the appellate] court must review the\r\ndocuments themselves to determine if they clearly support the privilege as a matter of law.\"  <em>Barnes\r\nv. Whittington</em>, 751 S.W.2d 493, 495 (Tex. 1988) (citations omitted); s<em>ee also</em> <em>In re Monsanto Co</em>.,\r\n998 S.W.2d 917, 929 (Tex. App.--Waco 1999, no pet.); <em>Oyster Creek Fin. Corp. v. Richwood Invs.\r\nII</em>, 957 S.W.2d 640, 646-47 (Tex. App.--Amarillo 1997, pet. denied);<em> Osborne v. Johnson</em>, 954\r\nS.W.2d 180, 185 (Tex. App.--Waco 1997, no pet.).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tIt is the policy of the State to construe the Public Information Act liberally in favor\r\nof disclosure.  Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 552.001(b).  If the trial court determines that an <em>in camera\r\n</em>inspection is necessary, the material must be segregated and produced for the court.  Thus, the\r\nburden to produce the disputed information, and to preserve it of record for the appeal, lies with the\r\ngovernmental body seeking to assert an exception to the Act.  The Department has failed to carry this\r\nburden.  On this record it is impossible for us to determine whether the withheld documents contain\r\n<em>only</em> confidential information pertaining to Medicaid patients.  Therefore, we reverse the order\r\ndenying Dominguez's writ of mandamus and remand to the trial court for further proceedings in\r\nwhich the documents can be filed under seal and inspected <em>in camera</em> once more.  In the event of\r\nanother appeal, the complete record will be available for our review.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><strong><em>Litigation Costs and Attorneys' Fees</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>\t</em></strong><em></em>Dominguez asserts that the trial court had no discretion to deny his request for\r\nlitigation costs and attorneys' fees.  To the contrary, under the version of the Act governing this case,\r\nit is in the discretion of the trial court to award costs and fees incurred by the party who substantially\r\nprevails.<sup> (6)</sup>  Act of April 30,1993, 73d Leg., R.S., ch. 268, §1, 1993 Tex. Gen. Laws 583, 606\r\n(amended 1999) (current version at Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 552.323 (West Supp. 2001)).  One\r\nfactor for the court to consider is whether the governmental body had a reasonable basis for its\r\nactions.  <em>Id</em>.  However, in light of the disposition of this appeal, the issue of costs and fees is not yet\r\nripe for our review.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><strong><center>DISPOSITION</center></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tIn the trial court, Dominguez filed a petition for writ of mandamus.  This is the\r\nstatutory remedy provided to private citizens by the Act.  Act of May 19, 1995, 74th Leg., R.S., ch.\r\n1035, § 24, 1995 Tex. Gen. Laws 5127, 5140 (amended 1999) (current version at Tex. Gov't Code\r\nAnn. § 552.321 (West Supp. 2001)).  Concurrently, Dominguez sought a declaratory judgment that,\r\namong other things, the withheld information should be made available to the public as a matter of\r\nlaw.  In response, the Department filed a plea to the jurisdiction.  Relying on the 1999 amendments\r\nto the Act, the Department argued that the Act explicitly waived the State's sovereign immunity from\r\nsuit by private citizens <em>only</em> for suit for writ of mandamus.  <em>See </em>Tex. Gov't Code Ann. §§ 552.321,\r\n.3215 (West Supp. 2001).  The 1999 amendments added section 552.3215, which provides that\r\nactions for declaratory judgment may be brought by a district attorney, county attorney, or the\r\nAttorney General.  <em>See </em>Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 552.3215(c).  That section does not provide for\r\ndeclaratory actions maintained by requestors.  Following the hearing and <em>in camera</em> inspection, the\r\ntrial court issued an order granting the Department's plea.  The trial court stated in its conclusions\r\nof law that Dominguez was not a party that could properly seek a declaratory judgment under the Act\r\nand that his sole remedy was mandamus.  However, as previously noted, the 1999 amendments do\r\nnot govern this appeal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\"The Declaratory Judgments Act gives courts the power to declare rights, status and\r\nother legal relations, whether further relief is claimed or could be claimed.\"  <em>City of Garland v.\r\nDallas Morning News</em>, 22 S.W.3d 351, 357 (Tex. 2000) (applying Act in effect in September 1993). \r\nUnder earlier versions of the Act, \"both requestors and governmental bodies have brought\r\ndeclaratory judgment actions in open records cases since the Act's inception.\"  <em>Id</em>.  Historically,\r\nrequestors could sue for declaratory judgment <em>in addition to</em> mandamus.  <em>Id</em>.  We express no opinion\r\nas to whether the 1999 amendments to the Act changed the law in this regard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tTherefore, we reverse the trial court's order granting the Department's plea to the\r\njurisdiction and render judgment that Dominguez has standing to seek a declaratory judgment.  We\r\nfurther reverse the trial court's order denying Dominguez's petition for writ of mandamus and\r\nremand for further proceedings. </p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t<span>                                                                                     </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\t\t\t\tMack Kidd, Justice</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before Justices Kidd, B.

Tex.\r\nGov't Code Ann. §§ 552.001-.353 (West 1994 &amp; Supp. 2001).  Because Dominguez made his\r\nrequest prior to the September 1, 1999 effective date of the amendments, the prior version of the Act\r\ncontrols this case.  <em>See City of Garland v. Dallas Morning News</em>, 22 S.W.3d 351, 354 n.1 (Tex.\r\n2000).  We will cite to the current code only for those sections that were unaffected by the 1999\r\namendments.\r\n</p><p>2.      \tDominguez's petition also sought declaratory judgment.

The trial court stated in its conclusions\r\nof law that Dominguez was not a party that could properly seek a declaratory judgment under the Act\r\nand that his sole remedy was mandamus.

Dominguez brought suit against Don A. Gilbert, Commissioner of the Texas\r\nHealth and Human Services Commission (\"the Department\"), and Sharon Thompson, Director of\r\nMedicaid Program Integrity, Office of Investigations and Enforcement (\"Medicaid Enforcement\"),\r\nseeking a writ of mandamus to compel the release of documents requested pursuant to the Texas\r\nPublic Information Act.  <em>See </em>Tex. Gov't Code Ann. §§ 552.001-.353 (West 1994 &amp; Supp. 2001)\r\n(\"the Act\").<sup> (1)</sup>  Prior to a hearing before the trial court, the Department produced some of the requested\r\ndocuments but refused to produce others, asserting that they were confidential as a matter of law and\r\ntherefore expressly excepted from disclosure under the Act.  Following a hearing and an <em>in camera</em>\r\ninspection of the withheld documents, the trial court issued an order denying Dominguez's petition\r\nfor writ of mandamus.<sup> (2)</sup>  We will reverse the order and remand the cause to the trial court.<strong></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tIn January 1998, Medicaid Enforcement began investigating Dominguez, a practicing\r\nphysician, for possible Medicaid fraud.  In the course of the investigation, Medicaid Enforcement\r\nobtained Dominguez's actual files, or copies thereof, regarding his treatment of over 700 patients. \r\nAs a result of Medicaid Enforcement's investigation, it sent Dominguez an administrative sanctions\r\nletter.  Following receipt of the letter, Dominguez made a request pursuant to the Act for a complete\r\ncopy of Medicaid Enforcement's investigative file and any other documents relating to the\r\nallegations against him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tDominguez made his request in July 1999.  Thereafter, Dominguez and the\r\nDepartment engaged in settlement negotiations; however, the Department took no action regarding\r\nDominguez's request.  On May 5, 2000, Dominguez filed a petition for writ of mandamus requesting\r\nthat the trial court compel the Department to produce all information related to the investigation for\r\nhis inspection and duplication.  On May 24, the Department sent Dominguez 400 pages that were\r\nresponsive to his request; however, the Department withheld or redacted about 100 pages, which it\r\nmaintained were confidential by law and could not be produced.  In response to Dominguez's\r\npetition in the trial court, the Department filed an answer, asserting that the production of all\r\ndocuments not excepted from disclosure under the Act rendered the cause moot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe trial court conducted a hearing at which both parties presented argument and\r\nDominguez called one witness.  Thereafter, the trial court conducted an <em>in camera</em> inspection of the\r\nwithheld documents and issued an order denying Dominguez's petition for writ of mandamus. \r\nDominguez requested findings of fact and conclusions of law, which appear in the record.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tBecause Dominguez has not seen the disputed documents, he cannot be certain of\r\ntheir contents.  He asserts that the 400 pages in his possession, however, contain references that\r\nindicate that there are other documents that should have been produced.  Dominguez claims that\r\nthese withheld documents are not confidential as a matter of law because they contain information\r\nabout his treatment of his patients, for whom he is the primary-care physician.  He also alleges that\r\nthe documents contain notes made by a physician who reviewed his records on behalf of Medicaid\r\nEnforcement.  Specifically, he maintains that the reviewing physician annotated the patient files,\r\nevaluating the medical necessity of Dominguez's treatment.  According to Dominguez, this\r\nphysician's determination of \"no medical necessity\" forms the basis of the Department's punitive\r\nand costly sanctions against him.  Finally, Dominguez argues that the Department must disclose the\r\ndocuments because it failed to follow the procedural requirements set forth in the Act for requesting\r\na determination from the Attorney General.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe Department asserts that the documents contain confidential information relating\r\nto Medicaid coverage and treatment of Dominguez's patients by other physicians, as well as\r\nDominguez.  The Department argues that federal and state law prohibit the disclosure of such\r\ninformation regarding Medicaid recipients.  While the Department concedes that the documents do\r\ncontain some information regarding Dominguez's treatment of his patients, it denies that the\r\ndocuments contain notes or other work product.  Finally, the Department contends that it delayed\r\ntaking action on Dominguez's written request because the parties were participating in settlement\r\nnegotiations. </p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><strong>DISCUSSION</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>The Texas Public Information Act</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tIt is the policy of the State of Texas that each person is entitled to have \"complete\r\ninformation about the affairs of government and the official acts of public officials and employees.\" \r\nTex. Gov't Code Ann. § 552.001(a) (West 1994).  The primary purpose of the Act is to grant the\r\npeople access to information \"so that they may retain control over the instruments they have\r\ncreated.\"  <em>Id</em>.  \"To that end, the provisions of the Act are to be liberally construed in favor of the\r\ndisclosure of government-held information.\"  <em>Hancock v. State Bd. of Ins</em>., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2416992\"><a href=\"/opinion/2416992/hancock-v-state-bd-of-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">797</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">379</span></a></span>, 381\r\n(Tex. App.--Austin 1990, no writ); <em>accord </em>Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 552.001(b) (West 1994).  The\r\nAct defines public information as \"information that is collected, assembled, or maintained under a\r\nlaw or ordinance or in connection with the transaction of official business\" by or for a governmental\r\nbody.  Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 552.002(a) (West Supp. 2001).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tUpon receipt of a request from any person, the officer for public information of a\r\ngovernmental body is required to <em>promptly</em> produce public documents for inspection, duplication,\r\nor both.  <em>Id</em>. § 552.221(a).  If the information is unavailable at the time of the request, or cannot be\r\nproduced within ten business days, the officer is required to notify the requestor in writing and set\r\na date for production within a reasonable time.  <em>Id</em>. § 552.221(c), (d).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tAlthough the Act favors disclosure, it also contains exceptions from disclosure for\r\nover twenty categories of information.  <em>See</em> <em>id.</em> §§ 552.101-.132 (West 1994 &amp; Supp. 2001).  For\r\nexample, an exception prohibits disclosure of \"information considered to be confidential by law,\r\neither constitutional, statutory, or by judicial decision.\"  <em>Id</em>. § 552.101 (West 1994).  If a\r\ngovernmental body wants to withhold information, the Act requires it to request a decision from the\r\nAttorney General about whether an exception can be claimed, unless a previous determination has\r\nalready addressed the exception's applicability to the specific type of information at issue.  Act of\r\nJune 1, 1997, 75th Leg., R.S., ch. 1231, § 5, 1997 Tex. Gen. Laws 4701, 4701 (amended 1999)\r\n(current version at Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 552.301(a) (West Supp. 2001)).  If the governmental\r\nbody is seeking an Attorney General's determination, it must do so in writing within ten business\r\ndays of receiving the request.  <em>Id</em>. (current version at Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 552.301(b) (West\r\nSupp. 2001)).  The Act does not require notice to the requestor that such a determination is being\r\nsought.  <em>See id</em>. (current version at Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 553.301(d) (West Supp. 2001)).<sup> (3)</sup>  The\r\nAct is also silent as to the course of action an agency must take when relying on a previous\r\ndetermination that the information is excepted from disclosure.  <em>See</em> <em>id</em>.  There is no statutory\r\nrequirement that the governmental body give notice to the requestor that it is withholding\r\ninformation in reliance on an earlier determination.  <em>See id.  </em>The failure to seek an Attorney\r\nGeneral's determination <em>when one is required</em> creates a presumption that the information is \"public\r\ninformation.\"  Act of April 30,1993, 73d Leg., R.S., ch. 268, §1, 1993 Tex. Gen. Laws 583, 605\r\n(amended 1999) (current version at Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 552.302 (West Supp. 2001)).</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><strong><em>The Petition for Writ of Mandamus</em></strong><em></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tDominguez argues that because the Department did not timely respond to his\r\napplication or request an Attorney General's determination regarding whether the information was\r\nwithin an exception to the Act, there is a presumption that the information is public.  <em>See</em> <em>id</em>. \r\nHowever, the Department is not required to request a determination when one has already been\r\nissued regarding the exception's applicability to the specific type of information being sought.  Act\r\nof June 1, 1997, 75th Leg., R.S., ch. 1231, § 5, 1997 Tex. Gen. Laws 4701, 4701 (amended 1999). \r\nIn this case, the Attorney General's open records decision number 584 appears to be on point, and\r\nthe Department is entitled to rely on it.  <em>See</em> Tex. Att'y Gen. ORD-584 (1991).  The more prudent\r\ncourse of action would have been for the Department to notify Dominguez that it withheld the\r\ndocuments under an exception to the Act and in reliance on a previous determination.<sup> (4)</sup>  However,\r\nthe Act does not contemplate the automatic disclosure of information as a sanction for the\r\nDepartment's failure to do so.  The issue before us is whether the information qualifies for an\r\nexception under the Act. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tInformation is excepted from disclosure under the Act \"if it is information considered\r\nto be confidential by law, either constitutional, statutory, or by judicial decision.\"  Tex. Gov't Code\r\nAnn. § 552.101.  A governmental body can voluntarily disclose records that it is not required to\r\ndisclose <em>unless</em> those records are \"confidential under law.\" <em>Id</em>. § 552.007(a) (West Supp. 2001).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tFederal law requires that state Medicaid plans provide safeguards restricting the\r\ndisclosure of information concerning applicants and recipients to \"purposes <em>directly connected</em> with\r\nthe administration of the plan.\"  42 U.S.C.A. §1396a(a)(7) (West Supp. 2000) (emphasis added). \r\nPurposes directly connected with the administration of a state Medicaid plan include establishing\r\neligibility, determining the amount of medical assistance, providing services, and conducting an\r\ninvestigation related to administration of the plan.  42 C.F.R. § 431.302 (2000).  At a minimum,\r\nsafeguarded information must include names, addresses, medical services provided, social and\r\neconomic circumstances, agency evaluations of personal information, medical data, income\r\neligibility, and the amount of medical assistance payments.  <em>Id</em>. § 431.305.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tIn Texas, the Medicaid program is administered by the Department.  Tex. Hum. Res.\r\nCode Ann. § 32.021(a) (West Supp. 2001).  State law dictates that it is a misdemeanor for a person\r\nto disclose \"any information\" concerning Medicaid applicants and recipients \"if the information is\r\ndirectly or indirectly derived from the records, papers, files, or communications\" of the Department\r\nor acquired by Department employees in the performance of their official duties.  <em>Id</em>. § 12.003(a)\r\n(West 2001).  The legislature has directed the Department to establish safeguards restricting the\r\ndisclosure of information concerning Medicaid applicants and recipients to \"purposes <em>directly\r\nconnected</em> with the administration\" of Department programs.  <em>Id</em>. § 21.012(a) (emphasis added).  The\r\nAttorney General has determined that information regarding Medicaid clients is excepted from\r\ndisclosure under the Act as \"information deemed confidential by statutory law.\"  <em>See</em> Tex. Att'y Gen.\r\nORD-584 (interpreting sections 12.003 and 21.012 of Texas Human Resources Code and\r\npredecessor to 42 U.S.C.A. § 1396a(a)(7)).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tOn appeal, Dominguez and the Department disagree regarding the contents of the\r\ndisputed documents.  Following its <em>in camera</em> review of those documents, the trial court made a\r\nfinding that the withheld and redacted information pertained only to Medicaid recipients.  This was\r\nthe basis for the court's conclusion that the information was confidential under federal and state law\r\nand thus could not be disclosed.  However, the pages inspected <em>in camera</em> were not submitted with\r\nthe record on appeal.  This court requested the documents under seal from the clerk of the trial court,\r\nonly to learn that they were not of record.  Apparently, they were sent to the trial court judge via hand\r\ndelivery, under cover letter, without a request that the documents be filed or entered as evidence.<sup> (5)</sup> \r\nWe must determine a case on the record as filed.  <em>Mitchison v.

App.--Houston [14th Dist.] 1991, writ denied).  Therefore, even if the\r\nDepartment could reproduce the documents, we cannot examine them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe appellant usually bears the burden of presenting a trial court record that is\r\nsufficient to show reversible error.  <em>See </em>Tex. R. App. P. 34.6(b); <em>see also Piotrowski v.

However, there are\r\nexceptions to this general rule.  For example, when the court reporter's notes are lost or destroyed\r\nthrough no fault of the appellant, he may be entitled to a new trial.  Tex. R. App. P. 34.6(f); <em>see also\r\nPiotrowski</em>, 873 S.W.2d at 370.  In this instance, where Dominguez had no access to the documents\r\nand they were not offered in open court, the burden to preserve them of record for appellate review\r\nmust lie with the Department.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tThis case presents a dispute analogous to a discovery dispute, in which a party seeks\r\nto avoid producing allegedly privileged documents.  The Texas Supreme Court has stated, as\r\nfollows: </p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\tOnly in certain narrow circumstances is it appropriate to obstruct the search\r\nfor truth by denying discovery.  Very limited exceptions to the strongly preferred\r\npolicy of openness are recognized in our state procedural rules and statutes.  The\r\nburden is on the party seeking to avoid discovery to plead the basis for exemption or\r\nimmunity and to produce evidence supporting that claim. . . . If the trial court\r\ndetermines that an <em>in camera </em>inspection of the requested discovery is necessary, the\r\nmaterials must be segregated and produced to the court. </p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><em>State v.

App.--Waco 1997, no pet.).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tIt is the policy of the State to construe the Public Information Act liberally in favor\r\nof disclosure.  Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 552.001(b).  If the trial court determines that an <em>in camera\r\n</em>inspection is necessary, the material must be segregated and produced for the court.  Thus, the\r\nburden to produce the disputed information, and to preserve it of record for the appeal, lies with the\r\ngovernmental body seeking to assert an exception to the Act.  The Department has failed to carry this\r\nburden.  On this record it is impossible for us to determine whether the withheld documents contain\r\n<em>only</em> confidential information pertaining to Medicaid patients.  Therefore, we reverse the order\r\ndenying Dominguez's writ of mandamus and remand to the trial court for further proceedings in\r\nwhich the documents can be filed under seal and inspected <em>in camera</em> once more.  In the event of\r\nanother appeal, the complete record will be available for our review.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><strong><em>Litigation Costs and Attorneys' Fees</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>\t</em></strong><em></em>Dominguez asserts that the trial court had no discretion to deny his request for\r\nlitigation costs and attorneys' fees.  To the contrary, under the version of the Act governing this case,\r\nit is in the discretion of the trial court to award costs and fees incurred by the party who substantially\r\nprevails.<sup> (6)</sup>  Act of April 30,1993, 73d Leg., R.S., ch. 268, §1, 1993 Tex. Gen. Laws 583, 606\r\n(amended 1999) (current version at Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 552.323 (West Supp. 2001)).  One\r\nfactor for the court to consider is whether the governmental body had a reasonable basis for its\r\nactions.  <em>Id</em>.  However, in light of the disposition of this appeal, the issue of costs and fees is not yet\r\nripe for our review.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><strong><center>DISPOSITION</center></strong>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tIn the trial court, Dominguez filed a petition for writ of mandamus.  This is the\r\nstatutory remedy provided to private citizens by the Act.  Act of May 19, 1995, 74th Leg., R.S., ch.\r\n1035, § 24, 1995 Tex. Gen. Laws 5127, 5140 (amended 1999) (current version at Tex. Gov't Code\r\nAnn. § 552.321 (West Supp. 2001)).  Concurrently, Dominguez sought a declaratory judgment that,\r\namong other things, the withheld information should be made available to the public as a matter of\r\nlaw.  In response, the Department filed a plea to the jurisdiction.  Relying on the 1999 amendments\r\nto the Act, the Department argued that the Act explicitly waived the State's sovereign immunity from\r\nsuit by private citizens <em>only</em> for suit for writ of mandamus.  <em>See </em>Tex. Gov't Code Ann. §§ 552.321,\r\n.3215 (West Supp. 2001).  The 1999 amendments added section 552.3215, which provides that\r\nactions for declaratory judgment may be brought by a district attorney, county attorney, or the\r\nAttorney General.  <em>See </em>Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 552.3215(c).  That section does not provide for\r\ndeclaratory actions maintained by requestors.  Following the hearing and <em>in camera</em> inspection, the\r\ntrial court issued an order granting the Department's plea.  The trial court stated in its conclusions\r\nof law that Dominguez was not a party that could properly seek a declaratory judgment under the Act\r\nand that his sole remedy was mandamus.  However, as previously noted, the 1999 amendments do\r\nnot govern this appeal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\"The Declaratory Judgments Act gives courts the power to declare rights, status and\r\nother legal relations, whether further relief is claimed or could be claimed.\"  <em>City of Garland v.\r\nDallas Morning News</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1376478\"><a href=\"/opinion/1376478/city-of-garland-v-dallas-morning-news/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">351</span></a></span>, 357 (Tex. 2000) (applying Act in effect in September 1993). \r\nUnder earlier versions of the Act, \"both requestors and governmental bodies have brought\r\ndeclaratory judgment actions in open records cases since the Act's inception.\"  <em>Id</em>.
