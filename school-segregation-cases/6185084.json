Brown, District Judge, Presiding\n\n                        Argued and Submitted June 6, 2017\n                                Portland, Oregon\n\nBefore: GOULD and RAWLINSON, Circuit Judges, and BURNS,** District\nJudge.\n\n\n\n\n      *\n             This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent\nexcept as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.\n      **\n            The Honorable Larry A. Burns, United States District Judge for the\nSouthern District of California, sitting by designation.\n\f      Christopher Paul Poulain (Poulain) appeals from the district court’s grant of\n\nsummary judgment in favor of Defendants on the basis that his action brought\n\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983 was untimely.\n\n      The district court did not err in granting summary judgment on Poulain’s §\n\n1983 action because no material issue of fact existed regarding when Poulain\n\ndiscovered his injury. Poulain’s injury accrued on February 21, 2007, when he\n\nlearned that the removed growth was benign. See Bonneau v. Centennial Sch. Dist.\n\nNo. 28J, 666 F.3d 577, 581 (9th Cir. 2012) (holding that a “cause of action accrues\n\nwhen the plaintiff knows or has reason to know of the injury.”) (citation and\n\ninternal quotation marks omitted). Poulain’s assertion that he learned of the injury\n\nwhen an unidentified nurse informed him that a doctor might have foregone\n\nconducting a biopsy because the procedure is “expensive and time consuming,”\n\nmisses the mark. The nurse’s statement might serve as evidence of Defendants’\n\ndeliberate indifference, however, evidence of deliberate indifference is not the\n\nsame as accrual of an action. See Lukovsky v. City & Cty. of San Francisco, 535\n\nF.3d 1044, 1050 (9th Cir. 2008) (clarifying that the cause of action accrues when\n\nthe injury occurs rather than when the consequences of the action are “fully felt.”)\n\n      Poulain conceded that his action was untimely. However, Poulain asserts\n\nthat he is entitled to equitable tolling because he was proceeding pro se and had\n\n\n                                          2\n\frestricted access to the law library. But these circumstances are not\n\n“extraordinary,” as is required for equitable tolling. Credit Suisse Sec. LLC v.\n\nSimmonds, 132 S. Ct. 1414, 1419 (2012) (applying the statute of limitations).\n\n      A pro se petitioner’s lack of legal sophistication is not, by itself, an\n\nextraordinary circumstance warranting equitable tolling. See Ford v. Pliler, 590\n\nF.3d 782, 789 (9th Cir. 2009). Additionally, we have explained that “[o]rdinary\n\nprison limitations on [a plaintiff’s] access to the law library” are “neither\n\nextraordinary,” nor do they make it “impossible for him to file his petition in a\n\ntimely manner.” Ramirez v. Yates, 571 F.3d 993, 998 (9th Cir. 2009) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted). Poulain faced conditions typical of prison life, and any\n\nrestrictions placed on his ability to prosecute his claim were not “extraordinary”\n\nsuch that equitable tolling is appropriate. See id. (holding that a plaintiff was not\n\nentitled to equitable tolling “simply because he remained in administrative\n\nsegregation and had limited access to the law library and copier” and\n\ndistinguishing such circumstances from the “denial altogether of access to his\n\npersonal legal papers.”).\n\n      Because Poulain has not shown that extraordinary circumstances prevented\n\nhim from timely filing a complaint, it is unnecessary to determine whether\n\nequitable tolling is appropriate under Oregon law.\n\n\n                                            3\n\fAFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n            4\n\f",
