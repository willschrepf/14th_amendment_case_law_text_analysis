Middle Bucks Area Vocational Technical\nSchool, 972 F.2d 1364, 1365 (3d Cir. 1992) (en banc),\nwherein Judge Seitz noted that such cases as this present “a\nclassic case of constitutional line drawing in a most\nexcruciating factual context.”\n2\n We will refer to the Blackhawk School District and\nAssistant Principal Balaski collectively as the “Defendants.”\n\n                              2\n\fclaim that Brittany and her sister Emily were subjected to\nbullying in the form of a series of threats, assaults, and acts of\nracial intimidation at the hands of a fellow student and her\naccomplice. Unable to obtain help from school officials, the\nMorrows were ultimately compelled to remove their children\nfrom their school. Thereafter, the Morrows brought suit\nalleging that school officials denied them substantive due\nprocess under the Fourteenth Amendment by not protecting\nBrittany and Emily. The Third Amended Complaint (the\n“Complaint”) asserted a cause of action under 42 U.S.C. §\n1983 and a supplemental state law claim for “negligence\nand/or gross or willful misconduct.”\n\n       The District Court dismissed the Complaint based on\nour decision in D.R. v. Middle Bucks Area Vocational\nTechnical School, 972 F.2d 1364 (3d Cir. 1992) (en banc).\nThere, we concluded that the school did not have a “special\nrelationship” with students that would give rise to a\nconstitutional duty to protect them from harm from other\nstudents given the alleged facts. See id. at 1372 (finding that\n“no special relationship based upon a restraint of liberty exists\nhere”). The District Court also held that the injury the\nMorrows complained of was not the result of any affirmative\naction by the Defendants. Accordingly, the court held that\nthe Defendants are not liable under the “state-created danger”\ndoctrine.     The District Court therefore dismissed the\nMorrows‟ Complaint, and this appeal followed. The appeal\nwas initially argued before a panel of this Court. Thereafter,\nwe granted en banc review to reexamine the very important\nquestions raised by the allegations in the Complaint.\n\n       We now affirm the judgment of the District Court and\nhold that the allegations do not establish the special\nrelationship or the state-created danger that must exist before\na constitutional duty to protect arises under the Fourteenth\nAmendment.\n\n  I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n                   A. Factual Background\n\n\n\n\n                                3\n\f       Brittany and Emily Morrow attended Blackhawk High\nSchool in Beaver County, Pennsylvania.3 Beginning in\nJanuary 2008, they were subjected to a series of threats and\nphysical assaults by Shaquana Anderson, a fellow student.\nSpecifically, on January 5, 2008, Anderson threatened\nBrittany by phone and on a MySpace blog.4 Two days later,\nAnderson physically attacked Brittany in the school‟s lunch\nroom. Pursuant to its “No Tolerance Policy,” the school\nsuspended both girls for three days. Brittany‟s mother also\nreported Anderson to the local police at the recommendation\nof Assistant Principal Balaski. As a result, Anderson was\ncharged with simple assault, terroristic threats, and\nharassment. Nevertheless, Anderson continued to bully\nBrittany and Emily. In fact, shortly after she returned to\nschool, Anderson again attacked Brittany by attempting to\nthrow her down a set of stairs. During that incident,\nAnderson allegedly called Brittany a “cracker,” told her that\nshe was “retarded” and “had better learn to fight back,” and\nasked “why don‟t you learn to talk right?”\n\n       On April 9, 2008, Anderson was placed on probation\nby the Court of Common Pleas of Beaver County, Juvenile\nDivision, and ordered to have no contact with Brittany. Five\nmonths later, Anderson was adjudicated delinquent by a\nJuvenile Master of that court, and was again ordered to have\nno contact with Brittany. Copies of both of these “no-\ncontact” orders were provided to the school and to Assistant\nPrincipal Balaski.\n\n\n\n3\n  Since this is an appeal from the District Court‟s grant of the\nDefendants‟ Motion to Dismiss pursuant to rule 12(b)(6) of\nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, we must accept the\nfactual allegations contained in the Morrows‟ Complaint as\ntrue. Warren Gen. Hosp. v. Amgen Inc., 643 F.3d 77, 84 (3d\nCir. 2011).\n4\n   “MySpace” is a popular social-networking website that\n“allows its members to create online „profiles,‟ which are\nindividual web pages on which members post photographs,\nvideos, and information about their lives and interests.” Doe\nv. MySpace, Inc., 474 F. Supp. 2d 843, 845 (W.D. Tex. 2007).\n\n                               4\n\f       Despite the court‟s intervention, on September 12,\n2008, Anderson boarded Brittany‟s school bus, even though\nthat bus did not service Anderson‟s home route. Anderson\nthreatened Brittany, and she elbowed Brittany in the throat at\na school football game that evening. A few days later, Abbey\nHarris, Anderson‟s friend, struck Emily in the throat. These\nincidents were reported to school officials.\n\n       The Morrows subsequently met with school officials,\nbut they responded by telling the Morrows that they could not\nguarantee Brittany and Emily‟s safety. Instead, rather than\nremoving Anderson and her confederate from the school,\nschool officials advised the Morrows to consider another\nschool for their children. In October 2008, the Morrows\nenrolled their daughters in a different school.\n\n                   B. Procedural History\n\n       The Morrows thereafter filed this suit pursuant to 42\nU.S.C. § 1983, alleging a violation of their Fourteenth\nAmendment substantive due process rights.5 They also\nincluded a supplemental state law claim against Assistant\nPrincipal Balaski for “negligence and/or gross and willful\nmisconduct.” The Morrows acknowledge that the Fourteenth\nAmendment‟s Due Process Clause does not generally impose\nan affirmative duty on the state to protect individuals from\nharm caused by private citizens. However, they argue that\nthe general rule is not applicable because the Defendants had\na “special relationship” with Brittany and Emily. They also\nargue that the Defendants are liable because they created the\ndangerous situation in which Brittany and Emily found\nthemselves, and that circumstance gave rise to a duty to\nprotect the Morrow sisters from that danger.\n\n        The District Court dismissed the Morrows‟ Complaint\nwith prejudice, and declined to exercise supplemental\njurisdiction over the state law claim.6 In its written opinion,\n5\n  The Morrows seek: 1) compensatory damages as to all\nDefendants; 2) punitive damages as to defendant Balaski; and\n3) attorneys‟ fees.\n6\n  Because the District Court dismissed the Complaint with\nprejudice, it was not necessary for the court to reach the\n                              5\n\fthe District Court explained that we have held that there is no\nspecial relationship between public school authorities and\nstudents. The court also concluded that the Morrows had\n“identified no action of the Defendants that utilized their\nauthority in a way that rendered Minor Plaintiffs more\nvulnerable than they would have been otherwise.” Morrow v.\nBalaski, No. 10-cv-292, 2011 WL 915863, at *5 (W.D. Pa.\nMar. 16, 2011). Although the District Court noted that it was\n“sympathetic to Plaintiffs‟ plight,” it nevertheless concluded\nthat the Morrows “have not stated a cause of action under\ncurrent Third Circuit case law.” Id.\n\n       This appeal followed.7\n\n               II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n        Our review of a district court‟s dismissal under Federal\nRule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) is plenary. Great W. Mining\n& Mineral Co. v. Fox Rothschild LLP, 615 F.3d 159, 163 (3d\nCir. 2010). “Under Rule 12(b)(6), a motion to dismiss may\nbe granted only if, accepting all well-pleaded allegations in\nthe complaint as true and viewing them in the light most\nfavorable to the plaintiff, a court finds that plaintiff‟s claims\nlack facial plausibility.” Warren Gen. Hosp. v. Amgen Inc.,\n643 F.3d 77, 84 (3d Cir. 2011). Although we must accept the\nallegations in the complaint as true, “we are not compelled to\naccept unsupported conclusions and unwarranted inferences,\nor a legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation.”\nBaraka v. McGreevey, 481 F.3d 187, 195 (3d Cir. 2007)\n(citations and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n                      III. DISCUSSION\n\n      To state a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, a plaintiff\nmust allege a person acting under color of state law engaged\nin conduct that violated a right protected by the Constitution\nor laws of the United States. Nicini v. Morra, 212 F.3d 798,\n\nissues of municipal liability and qualified immunity that the\nDefendants raised in their Motion to Dismiss.\n7\n  The District Court had subject matter jurisdiction pursuant\nto 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343. We have appellate\njurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n\n                                6\n\f806 (3d Cir. 2000) (en banc). Accordingly, “[t]he first step in\nevaluating a section 1983 claim is to „identify the exact\ncontours of the underlying right said to have been violated‟\nand to [then] determine „whether the plaintiff has alleged a\ndeprivation of a constitutional right at all.‟” Id. (quoting\nCnty. of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 841 n. 5 (1998)).\n\n       As we noted at the outset, the Morrows‟ § 1983 claim\nrests on the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment. The Due Process Clause provides that a state\nshall not “deprive any person of life, liberty, or property,\nwithout due process of law.” U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1.\nThe Morrows invoke the substantive component of due\nprocess, which “protects individual liberty against „certain\ngovernment actions regardless of the fairness of the\nprocedures used to implement them.‟” Collins v. City of\nHarker Heights, 503 U.S. 115, 125 (1992) (quoting Daniels v.\nWilliams, 474 U.S. 327, 331 (1986)). Specifically, the\nMorrows allege that school officials violated a liberty interest\nby failing to protect Emily and Brittany from the threats and\nassaults inflicted by fellow students.\n\n       Like the District Court, we are sympathetic to the\nMorrows‟ plight.      Brittany and Emily were verbally,\nphysically and—no doubt—emotionally tormented by a\nfellow student who was adjudicated delinquent based on her\nactions against the Morrow sisters. When the Morrows\nrequested that the Defendants do something to protect\nBrittany and Emily from the persistent harassment and\nbullying, school officials responded by suggesting that the\nMorrows consider moving to a different school rather than\nremoving the bully from the school.\n\n        We therefore certainly understand why the Morrows\nwould conclude that the school‟s response to the abuse\ninflicted on their daughters was unfair and unjust.\nNevertheless, our adjudication of the Morrows‟ claims must\nbe governed by Supreme Court precedent. As we shall\nexplain, it is also guided by authoritative Supreme Court\ndicta.\n\n      The Supreme Court has long established that “[a]s a\ngeneral matter, . . . a State‟s failure to protect an individual\n\n                               7\n\fagainst private violence simply does not constitute a violation\nof the Due Process Clause.” DeShaney v. Winnebago Cnty.\nDep’t of Social Servs., 489 U.S. 189, 197 (1989). The Due\nProcess Clause forbids the state itself from depriving\n“individuals of life, liberty, or property without „due process\nof law,‟ but its language cannot fairly be extended to impose\nan affirmative obligation on the State to ensure that those\ninterests do not come to harm through other means.” Id. at\n195.\n\n       In DeShaney, the Winnebago County Department of\nSocial Services received ongoing reports from family friends\nand medical personnel that a four-year old boy (“Joshua”)\nwas suffering physical abuse at the hands of his father. At\none point, the state obtained a court order placing Joshua in\nthe temporary custody of the local hospital, but later returned\nhim to the custody of his abusive father. Following Joshua‟s\nreturn, the county social worker assigned to the case\ncontinued to document multiple incidents of suspected abuse.\nDespite these reports, the county failed to remove Joshua\nfrom his father‟s custody. Eventually, the father beat Joshua\nso badly that the boy suffered permanent brain damage.\nJoshua and his mother sought redress by suing the county\nunder § 1983. They argued that the county had denied them\nsubstantive due process under the Fourteenth Amendment by\nnot protecting Joshua from his father. Id. at 191-93.\n\n       Despite these “undeniably tragic” facts, id. at 191, the\nSupreme Court held that the county‟s failure to provide\nJoshua with adequate protection against his father‟s violence\ndid not amount to a substantive due process violation. The\nCourt explained that the Due Process Clause limits state\ngovernments but does not generally impose an affirmative\nobligation upon states to protect individuals from private\ncitizens. Id. at 195-96. However, the Court carved out a very\nnarrow exception to that general rule wherein the Constitution\ndoes “impose[] upon the State affirmative duties of care and\nprotection with respect to particular individuals.” Id. at 198.\nThat exception has come to be known as the “special\nrelationship” exception. It applies when a special relationship\nhas been established because “the State takes a person into its\ncustody and holds him there against his will.” Id. at 199-200.\n\n\n                              8\n\f        In addition to the special relationship exception, we\nhave recognized that the Due Process Clause can impose an\naffirmative duty to protect if the state‟s own actions create the\nvery danger that causes the plaintiff‟s injury. See Kneipp v.\nTedder, 95 F.3d 1199, 1201 (3d Cir. 1996). In Kneipp, police\nofficers stopped Kneipp and her husband for causing a\ndisturbance on a highway while they were walking home\nfrom a bar, but they thereafter allowed Kneipp‟s husband to\ncontinue to their home to tend to their son. Kneipp‟s husband\nlater testified that because his wife was drunk, he assumed the\nofficers would take her to the hospital or to the police station.\nHowever, the officers abandoned her despite her obvious\nintoxication, thereby forcing her to walk home alone in the\ncold. She subsequently fell down an embankment and\nsuffered hypothermia resulting in permanent brain damage.\nId. at 1201-03. In the subsequent suit against the state under\n§ 1983, we held that the officers‟ conduct denied Kneipp her\nFourtheenth Amendment right to substantive due process\nbecause the actions of the police created the danger that\ncaused her injury. Id. at 1213.\n\n       Accordingly, the Morrows can state a claim under §\n1983 if they have adequately alleged circumstances giving\nrise to a “special relationship” between their daughters and\nthe Defendants pursuant to DeShaney, or if their Complaint\nadequately alleges affirmative conduct on the part of the\nDefendants to support the “state-created danger” exception\nthat we adopted in Kneipp.\n\n                   A. Special Relationship\n\n       As the Court instructed in DeShaney, an affirmative\nduty to protect may arise out of certain “special relationships”\nbetween the state and particular individuals. See DeShaney,\n489 U.S. at 197-98. The Supreme Court has found that the\nrelationship between the state and its incarcerated or\ninvoluntarily committed citizens is the kind of “special\nrelationship” that creates an affirmative duty upon the state to\nprovide adequate medical care to incarcerated prisoners, see\nEstelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 103 (1976), and to ensure the\n“reasonable safety” of involuntarily committed mental\npatients, Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 324 (1982).\nEstelle and Youngberg, “[t]aken together . . . stand . . . for the\n\n                                9\n\fproposition that when the State takes a person into its custody\nand holds him there against his will, the Constitution imposes\nupon it a corresponding duty to assume some responsibility\nfor his safety and general well-being.” DeShaney, 489 U.S. at\n199-200.\n\n        It is clear from the decision in DeShaney that the\nstate‟s constitutional “duty to protect arises not from the\nState‟s knowledge of the individual‟s predicament or from its\nexpressions of intent to help him, but from the limitation\nwhich it has imposed on his freedom to act on his own\nbehalf.” Id. at 200. In other words, “it is the State‟s\naffirmative act of restraining the individual‟s freedom to act\non       his      own      behalf—through         incarceration,\ninstitutionalization, or other similar restraint of personal\nliberty—which is the „deprivation of liberty‟ triggering the\nprotections of the Due Process Clause, not its failure to act to\nprotect his liberty interests against harms inflicted by other\nmeans.” Id. (emphasis added).\n\n        A minor child attending public school most certainly\ndoes not have the freedom of action or independence of an\nadult.8 Nevertheless, the Supreme Court has not had occasion\nto specifically decide whether that is sufficient to create a\nspecial relationship between public schools and their students\nunder the Due Process Clause. We have, however, previously\nconsidered the application of the special relationship doctrine\nin the public school context. In D.R. v. Middle Bucks Area\nVocational Technical School, 972 F.2d 1364 (3d Cir. 1992), a\nsixteen-year-old hearing and communication-impaired\nstudent (“D.R.”) and a seventeen-year-old classmate (“L.H.”)\nalleged that several male students physically, verbally, and\nsexually assaulted them during a graphic arts class during the\nschool day over a period of several months. The male\nstudents forced them into the classroom‟s unisex bathroom or\ndarkroom and physically abused and sexually molested the\nplaintiffs multiple times per week. A student teacher was\n8\n  “[T]he preservation of order and a proper educational\nenvironment requires close supervision of schoolchildren, as\nwell as the enforcement of rules against conduct that would\nbe perfectly permissible if undertaken by an adult.” New\nJersey v. T.L.O., 469 U.S. 325, 339 (1985).\n\n                              10\n\fpresent in the classroom when the abuses occurred. Although\nD.R. did not claim to have informed her of the situation, D.R.\nalleged that the teacher either heard the assaults or should\nhave heard them. L.H. alleged that she complained to the\nschool‟s assistant director about the boys‟ conduct, but he\ntook no action. Middle Bucks, 972 F.2d at 1366.\n\n        Although we recognized the horrific nature of the\nallegations, we nevertheless held that “the school defendants‟\nauthority over D.R. during the school day cannot be said to\ncreate the type of physical custody necessary to bring it\nwithin the special relationship noted in DeShaney.” Id. at\n1372.       We rejected the plaintiffs‟ argument that\nPennsylvania‟s compulsory school attendance laws and the\nschool‟s exercise of in loco parentis authority over its\nstudents so restrain the students‟ liberty that they can be\nconsidered to have been in state “custody” during school\nhours for Fourteenth Amendment purposes. Id. at 1370-72.\nOur conclusion was largely informed by the fact that “parents\nremain the primary caretakers, despite their [children‟s]\npresence in school.” Id. at 1371. We explained that “[t]he\nEstelle-Youngberg type custody referred to by the Court in\nDeShaney . . . is to be sharply contrasted with D.R.‟s\nsituation.” Id.      Although the doctrine of in loco parentis\ncertainly cloaks public schools with some authority over\nschool children, see, e.g., Morse v. Frederick, 551 U.S. 393,\n413-14 (2007) (reviewing legal doctrine of in loco parentis),\nthat control, without more, is not analogous to the state‟s\nauthority over an incarcerated prisoner or an individual who\nhas been involuntarily committed to a mental facility.\n\n       Nonetheless, when we decided Middle Bucks, the\nSupreme Court‟s jurisprudence allowed room to debate this\nissue because the Court had not enumerated the parameters of\nthe control or custody required for the creation of a special\nrelationship under the Fourteenth Amendment. Accordingly,\nin a compelling dissent to the Middle Bucks majority, then-\nChief Judge Sloviter argued for a “functional” approach to\n“custody”:\n\n      I believe that we are free to decide . . . that the\n      state compulsion that students attend school, the\n      status of most students as minors whose\n\n                              11\n\f        judgment is not fully mature, the discretion\n        extended by the state to schools to control\n        student behavior, and the pervasive control\n        exercised by the schools over their students\n        during the period of time they are in school,\n        combine to create the type of special\n        relationship which imposes a constitutional duty\n        on the schools to protect the liberty interests of\n        students while they are in the state‟s functional\n        custody.\n\nMiddle Bucks, 972 F.2d at 1377 (Sloviter, C.J., dissenting,\njoined by Mannsmann, Scirica and Nygaard, JJ.); see also\nMaldonado v. Josey, 975 F.2d 727, 733 (10th Cir. 1992)\n(Seymour, J., concurring) (“I would . . . hold that a child\nlegally required to attend school and thereby forced into the\ntemporary day-time custody of the state‟s agents is\nconstitutionally entitled to some level of protection from\nharm and care for basic safety.”).\n\n       However, after our decision in Middle Bucks, the\nSupreme Court decided Vernonia School District 47J v.\nActon, 515 U.S. 646 (1995). There, the Court clarified the\napplicability of DeShaney‟s special relationship exception in\nthe context of public schools. The specific issue in Vernonia\nwas whether a public school‟s policy requiring student\nathletes to submit to random drug testing violates the Fourth\nAmendment. Id. at 648. In holding that such a policy does\nnot violate the Fourth Amendment, the Court noted:\n“Central, in our view, to the present case is the fact that the\nsubjects of the Policy are (1) children, who (2) have been\ncommitted to the temporary custody of the State as\nschoolmaster.” Id. at 654. The Court then stated: “[W]e do\nnot, of course, suggest that public schools as a general matter\nhave such a degree of control over children as to give rise to a\nconstitutional „duty to protect.‟” Id. at 655 (citing DeShaney,\n489 U.S. at 200).\n       Although that statement is technically dictum, we have\npreviously explained that we cannot lightly ignore the force\nof Supreme Court dicta. See In re McDonald, 205 F.3d 606,\n612-13 (3d Cir. 2000).9 Moreover, although the statement\n9\n    In In re McDonald, we explained:\n\n                               12\n\fwas made in the context of the Court‟s analysis of a student\nathlete‟s reasonable expectation of privacy in public schools,\nthe citation to DeShaney is no less pertinent to our inquiry\nbecause it provides insight into the Court‟s interpretation of\nDeShaney‟s application to public schools. Indeed, short of an\nactual holding on the precise issue here, it is difficult to\nimagine a clearer or more forceful indicator of the Court‟s\nown interpretation of DeShaney and the special relationship\nexception recognized there as applied to public schools. See\nid. (“The Supreme Court uses dicta to help control and\ninfluence the many issues it cannot decide because of its\nlimited docket.”).\n\n       In addition, every other Circuit Court of Appeals that\nhas considered this issue in a precedential opinion has\nrejected the argument that a special relationship generally\nexists between public schools and their students. See, e.g.,\nHasenfus v. LaJeunesse, 175 F.3d 68, 69-72 (1st Cir. 1999);\nDoe v. Covington Cnty. Sch. Dist., 675 F.3d 849, 857-58, 863\n(5th Cir. 2012) (en banc); Doe v.

Polk Cnty. Sch. Bd., 129 F.3d 560, 568-69\n(11th Cir. 1997).10\n\n        Accordingly, the Supreme Court‟s dictum in Vernonia\nas well as the consensus from our sister Circuit Courts of\nAppeals both reinforce our conclusion that public schools, as\na general matter, do not have a constitutional duty to protect\nstudents from private actors. We know of nothing that has\noccurred in the twenty years since we decided Middle Bucks\nthat would undermine this conclusion. We therefore find the\ndissent‟s assertion here that “factual developments since\nMiddle Bucks have further undercut its rationale,” Fuentes\nDissent 18, unpersuasive. The first two examples our\ndissenting colleagues offer of “schools exercising greater\ncontrol over students” include the use of technology tracking\nstudent movement to ensure they are in class11 and the\nmonitoring of social media activity by students.12 Id. Such\nexamples merely illustrate new precautionary measures some\nschools have undertaken in response to emerging technology.\nIt is difficult to see how such measures constitute limitations\non a student‟s “freedom to act on his own behalf,” see\nDeShaney, 489 U.S. at 200, that are so severely restrictive as\nto equate public school students with prisoners or those who\nare involuntarily committed to secure mental institutions.\n\n       Similarly, a school‟s exercise of authority to lock\nclassrooms in the wake of tragedies such as those that have\n\n10\n   The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has not\nsquarely decided this issue. However, district courts in the\nSecond Circuit have generally held that compulsory\nattendance laws do not create a special relationship between\nstudents and school districts resulting in a duty to protect\nagainst private actors. See, e.g., Chambers v. N. Rockland\nCent. Sch. Dist., 815 F. Supp. 2d 753, 763 n. 10 (S.D.N.Y.\n2011) (“The consensus among the courts is that the „special\nrelationship‟ doctrine does not apply to the school setting.”).\n11\n  Fuentes Dissent 18 (citing Maurice Chammah and Nick\nSwartsell, Student IDs That Track the Students, N.Y. TIMES,\nOCT. 6, 2012, http://nyti.ms/ThvbFq).\n12\n  Id. (citing J.S. ex rel. Snyder v. Blue Mountain Sch. Dist.,\n650 F.3d 915, 915 (3d Cir. 2011)).\n\n                               14\n\foccurred in Newtown, Connecticut and Colombine, Colorado,\nsee Fuentes Dissent 18-19, may be a relevant factor in\ndetermining whether a special relationship or a state-created\ndanger exists in those specific cases. However, the fact that\ncertain schools may resort to such restrictions does not\nadvance our inquiry here or allow us to conclude that the facts\nalleged in the Complaint are sufficient to give rise to a special\nrelationship or a state created danger.\n\n       In arguing that we should find a special relationship\nhere, Judge Fuentes cites to Judge Becker‟s statement in\ndissent in Middle Bucks that “a special relationship [between\na public school and its students] may exist under certain\nnarrow circumstances.” Fuentes Dissent 3. We do not\ndisagree. In holding that public schools do not generally have\na constitutional duty to protect students from private actors\nand that the allegations here are not sufficient to establish a\nspecial relationship, we do not foreclose the possibility of a\nspecial relationship arising between a particular school and\nparticular students under certain unique and narrow\ncircumstances. However, any such circumstances must be so\nsignificant as to forge a different kind of relationship between\na student and a school than that which is inherent in the\ndiscretion afforded school administrators as part of the\nschool‟s traditional in loco parentis authority or compulsory\nattendance laws.\n\n        The circumstances that our dissenting colleagues rely\nupon to insist that a special relationship exists under the facts\nalleged here are not “certain narrow” circumstances at all.\nInstead, they are endemic in the relationship between public\nschools and their students. The dissent would hold that a\nspecial relationship exists such that “Blackhawk undertook a\nlimited obligation to keep the Morrows safe . . . because\nBlackhawk compelled school attendance, exercised extensive\ncontrol over not only the student victims but also the specific\nthreat at issue in the case—a violent bully subject to two\nrestraining orders—and enforced school policies that\nprevented the Morrows from being fully able to protect\nthemselves.” Fuentes Dissent 3. However, those factors do\nnot distinguish the circumstances here from those that arise in\nthe general relationship between public schools and their\nstudents.\n\n                               15\n\f       As discussed above, we cannot hold that a special\nrelationship arose from compulsory school attendance laws\nand the concomitant in loco parentis authority and discretion\nthat schools necessarily exercise over students, or the school‟s\nfailure to do more to protect Brittany and Emily, without\nignoring the analysis in DeShaney, and the “considered dicta”\nin Vernonia School District. In arguing to the contrary, our\ndissenting colleagues exaggerate the extent of a school‟s\ncontrol over its students. Judge Fuentes insists that “[t]he\nState‟s authority over children while they are in school\nextends beyond their well-being and is nearly absolute.”\nFuentes Dissent 9 (emphasis added). However, the mere fact\nthat a school can require uniforms, 24 Pa. Stat. Ann. § 13-\n1317.3, or prescribe certain behavior while students are in\nschool, 22 Pa. Code § 12.2, does not suggest a special\nrelationship at all. Rather, such commonly accepted authority\nover student conduct is inherent in the nature of the\nrelationship of public schools and their pupils.13 They do not\nsuggest that a concomitant constitutional duty to protect\nstudents necessarily arises from that authority.\n       Significantly, our dissenting colleagues do not purport\nto argue that compulsory attendance laws and the school‟s\nauthority over students are themselves sufficient to satisfy the\nlimited exception carved out in DeShaney. Thus, the dissent\nattempts to characterize the specific circumstances of this\n\n\n13\n   Moreover, the generic responsibilities and authority\nprescribed by state law are not nearly as compelling and\nauthoritarian as our dissenting colleagues suggest. For\nexample, Judge Fuentes cites 22 Pa. Code § 12.2 in arguing\nthat state law requires that students “engage in conscientious\neffort in classroom work and homework.” Fuentes Dissent 9.\nHowever, it is doubtful that parents or students really fear that\nthe awesome authority or weight of the state will come\ncrashing down upon students who do not hand in homework\nor conscientiously participate in class. It is also not at all\nclear how the state‟s authority to require such “conscientious\neffort” restricts parents‟ ability to protect their children, or the\nstudents‟ ability to protect themselves, while in school.\n\n\n                                16\n\fcase as so extraordinary and compelling that a constitutional\nduty to protect arose under DeShaney. We are not persuaded.\n\n       The fact that “the specific threat at issue in this case”\nwas “a violent bully subject to two restraining orders,”\nFuentes Dissent 3, does not necessarily give rise to a special\nrelationship. The restraining orders to which the dissent\nrefers were addressed to Anderson, not the Defendants, and\nthe orders themselves do not impose any affirmative duties on\nthe Defendants. Indeed, we very much doubt that any\nDefendant was a party to the proceedings that resulted in the\norders, and no such involvement has been alleged. Although\nthe Defendants, and other third parties, are prohibited from\nmaking contact with the Morrow children on Anderson’s\nbehalf, the no-contact orders cannot reasonably be interpreted\nas imposing any obligation on the Defendants to ensure\nAnderson‟s compliance with the orders or to otherwise\nenforce them. Cf. Town of Castle Rock v. Gonzales, 545 U.S.\n748, 768 (2005) (holding that police department‟s failure to\nenforce restraining order did not constitute a violation of due\nprocess under the Fourteenth Amendment).\n\n        Moreover, whether our dissenting colleagues are\n referencing the school‟s “No Tolerance Policy,” or the policy\n that allegedly required Anderson‟s expulsion from school, in\n arguing that the Defendants “enforced school policies that\n prevented the Morrows from being fully able to protect\n themselves,” Fuentes Dissent 3, neither the mere existence of\n such common disciplinary policies, nor the school‟s exercise\n of discretion in enforcing them, altered the relationship\n between the school and its students to the extent required to\n create a constitutional duty under the Supreme Court‟s\n precedent.14\n\n14\n   Indeed, Judge Fuentes‟s suggestion that the school‟s “No\nTolerance Policy” limited “the Morrows‟ ability to protect\nthemselves,” Fuentes Dissent 14, is both unavailing and\ntroubling. The manner in which the school interpreted and\nenforced the policy here is certainly open to question as it\nappears Brittany was suspended for resisting Anderson‟s\nattack. However, that does not begin to approach the kind of\nrestriction on freedom required to give rise to a special\nrelationship under DeShaney. Were we to accept Judge\n                              17\n\f      The Morrows‟ attempt to distinguish their situation\nbased on the Defendants‟ “actual knowledge of Anderson‟s\ncriminal conduct in this case” is similarly unpersuasive.\nThey argue that such knowledge, combined with “the quasi-\ncustodial relationship that exists in all cases between a public\nschool and its pupils,” created a special relationship for\nsubstantive due process purposes.\n\n       DeShaney suggests otherwise. Neither our decision in\nMiddle Bucks, nor the dictum in Vernonia, necessarily\nforecloses the possibility of a special relationship arising in\nan appropriate case. However, the Court has instructed that\nany such relationship “arises not from the State‟s knowledge\nof the individual‟s predicament or from its expressions of\nintent to help him, but from the limitation which it has\nimposed on his freedom to act on his own behalf.”\nDeShaney, 489 U.S. at 200. Thus, under DeShaney, the\nDefendants‟ knowledge—of both the no-contact orders and\nAnderson‟s threats and conduct—may be relevant to\ndetermining whether the Defendants‟ conduct was\nsufficiently egregious to violate a previously existing duty to\nprotect the Morrow children, but that knowledge cannot\ncreate a duty that did not otherwise exist.\n\n       To find a special relationship here, our dissenting\ncolleagues rely, in part, on our analysis in the foster care\ncontext in Nicini v. Morra, 212 F.3d 798 (3d Cir. 2000) (en\nbanc). See Fuentes Dissent 10. However, we explained there\nthat “distinctions between children placed in foster care and\nthe prisoners at issue in Estelle or the institutionalized\nmentally retarded persons at issue in Youngberg are matters\nof degree rather than of kind. In each of these cases the state,\nby affirmative act, renders the individual substantially\n„dependent upon the state . . . to meet [his or her] basic\nneeds.‟” Id. at 808 (alteration in original) (citation omitted)\n(quoting Middle Bucks, 972 F.2d at 1372). By “„finding the\nchildren and placing them with state approved families . . . ,\n\nFuentes‟s proposition, school policies prohibiting the carrying\nof weapons or even cellular telephones at school could\ntheoretically also give rise to a constitutional duty to protect\nbecause such policies can also be interpreted as limiting\nstudents‟ ability to protect themselves.\n\n                              18\n\fthe state assumes an important continuing, if not immediate,\nresponsibility for the child‟s wellbeing.‟” Id. (quoting\nMiddle Bucks, 972 F.2d at 1372).15\n\n        As we explained in Middle Bucks, unlike children in\nfoster care, students in public schools continue to be primarily\ndependent on their parents for their care and protection, not\non their school. Despite the students‟ compulsory attendance\nin school during the school day and the school‟s authority to\nact in loco parentis during that time, the school‟s authority\nand responsibility neither supplants nor replaces the parent‟s\nultimate responsibility for the student absent more than is\nalleged here. Unlike foster care, the restrictions that schools\nplace on students generally, and the specific restrictions\nalleged here, are different in kind from the restrictions faced\nby the prisoners at issue in Estelle or the institutionalized\npersons in Youngberg.\n\n       This point is illustrated by the fact that schools\ngenerally may not administer medical treatment to students\nwithout first obtaining parental consent. See Parents United\nfor Better Sch., Inc. v. Sch. Dist. of Phila. Bd. of Educ., 646\nA.2d 689, 691 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 1994) (“The principle that\nparental consent must be secured before [schools may\nprovide] medical treatment . . . is time honored and has been\nrecognized by both the courts and the legislature.”). In\n15\n   The foster care cases from other circuits cited by Judge\nFuentes also turn on the fact that the state had displaced the\nparents‟ role as primary caregiver and transferred such\nresponsibility to the foster family, an agent of the state. See\ne.g., Norfleet v. Ark. Dep’t of Human Servs., 989 F.2d 289,\n293 (8th Cir. 1993) (“In this case, a special custodial\nrelationship . . . was created by the state when it took Taureen\nfrom his caregiver and placed him in foster care. . . . In foster\ncare, a child loses his freedom and ability to make decisions\nabout his own welfare, and must rely on the state to take care\nof his needs. It cannot be seriously doubted that the state\nassumed an obligation to provide medical care.”); Yvonne L.\nv. N.M. Dep’t of Human Servs., 959 F.2d 883, 893 (10th Cir.\n1992) (“[I]f the persons responsible place children in a foster\nhome or institution they know or suspect to be dangerous to\nthe children[,] they incur liability if the harm occurs.”).\n\n                               19\n\fcontrast, when a minor enters foster care, state actors have the\nauthority to bypass parental consent by obtaining a court\norder authorizing medical treatment. See 55 Pa. Code §§\n3130.91, 3800.19(b); 42 Pa. Stat. Ann. § 6357 (stating that the\ncustodian, to whom legal custody of a child has been given by\nthe Court of Common Pleas under the Juvenile Act, has “the\nright to determine the nature of the care and treatment of the\nchild, including ordinary medical care”).16 When a state\nagency has custody of a minor child for whom a decree of\ntermination of parental rights has been entered, the agency\nacquires authority to consent to all medical examination or\ntreatment, including major medical, psychiatric and surgical\ntreatment of the minor even without obtaining a court order.\nSee 23 Pa. Stat. Ann. § 2521(c).\n\n       The dissent‟s citation to Smith v. District of Columbia,\n413 F.3d 86 (D.C. Cir. 2005), is also unavailing. In Smith,\nthe court found a special relationship between the District of\nColumbia and “an adjudicated delinquent whom the District\nhad, by affirmative exercise of its police power, placed with\nits agent, [an independent living program], through a court\norder revocable only by another court order.” Id. at 94. The\ndissent argues that “[l]ike the children in Smith, the Morrows\nwere technically free to „come and go‟ from school after\ncertain hours but „risk[ed] punishment‟ for „fail[ing] to obey\n[the State‟s] restrictions on [their] . . . freedom‟ while in\nschool.” Fuentes Dissent 13 (alterations in original) (quoting\nSmith, 413 F.3d at 94). However, the fact that the juvenile in\nSmith enjoyed a degree of freedom of movement while\nhoused at the independent living program is not\ndeterminative. The state‟s liability arose from the fact that\n16\n   See also Lordes M. Rosado, Consent to Treatment and\nConfidentiality Provisions Affecting Minors in Pennsylvania,\nJuvenile Law Center, Jan. 2006, at 13, available at\nhttp://www.jlc.org/resources/publications/consent-treatment-\nand-confidentiality-provisions-affecting-minors-pennsylvani\n(“As a matter of practice, upon accepting a new child for\nservices, private [foster care] agencies have the child‟s\nparent/guardian sign a general release authorizing the agency\nto obtain routine medical examination and treatment for the\nchild. The private agencies in turn authorize the foster parent\nto obtain [such treatment] for the children.”).\n\n                              20\n\fthe state, through court order, had removed the juvenile from\nthe care and custody of his parents and required him to live\nunder the care and custody of the independent living program,\nwhich was acting as the state‟s agent under a very detailed\ncontract between the program and the state.\n\n       In DeShaney, the Supreme Court expressly noted that\n“[h]ad the State by the affirmative exercise of its power\nremoved [the child] from free society and placed him in a\nfoster home operated by its agents, we might have a situation\nsufficiently analogous to incarceration or institutionalization\nto give rise to an affirmative duty to protect.” DeShaney, 489\nU.S. at 201 n.9. That is precisely what happened in Nicini; it\nis not what happened here.              Moreover, the Court\nacknowledged in DeShaney that “several Courts of Appeals\nhave held, by analogy to Estelle and Youngberg, that the State\nmay be held liable under the Due Process Clause for failing to\nprotect children in foster homes.” Id. Citing this footnote,\nthe court in Smith found that the independent living program\nthere “presents a scenario close to the one described in the\nDeShaney footnote.” Smith, 413 F.3d at 94.\n\n       The dissent contends that this “focus on who remains\nthe victim‟s primary caregiver . . . contrast[s] sharply with our\nholding in Horton v. Flenory, 889 F.2d 454 (3d Cir. 1989).”\nFuentes Dissent 6 n.3. We agree that the facts of Horton are\ninstructive, but believe that they clearly counsel against\nimposing a constitutional duty here.\n\n       In Horton, the owner of a nightclub suspected an\nemployee, Powdrill, of burglarizing the club. The owner and\nanother employee began interrogating Powdrill about the\nburglary. During that interrogation, Powdrill was severely\nbeaten. The owner was a retired veteran of the local police\ndepartment, 889 F.2d at 456, and the township where the club\nwas located had “[a]n official policy of deferring to private\nowners with respect to the investigation of crimes in private\nclubs.” Id. at 458. Nevertheless, the owner did eventually\ncall police. An officer, who had served on the police force\nwith the owner, subsequently arrived, but the officer left\nPowdrill alone in the owner‟s custody noting that Powdrill\nwas “in good hands”—despite observing blood and evidence\nof a beating. Id. at 456. After the officer left, Powdrill was\n\n                               21\n\fbeaten again and subsequently died from his injuries. His\nestate brought an action against the municipality and the\nresponding officer under § 1983. We held that the township\ncould be liable because the jury could have found that the\ntownship had “delegated . . . its traditional police functions”\nto the owner of the club. Id. at 458. The responding officer\n“used his official status to confirm that [the owner] was free\nto continue the custodial interrogation even though Mr.\nPowdrill was in fear for his safety and wanted to leave.” Id.\nAlthough we framed the precise issue there as whether or not\nPowdrill “was in state custody at the time of the fatal\nbeating,” id., our inquiry focused on whether the defendant\nhad so limited Powdrill‟s ability to act in his own interest as\nto create the special relationship required for constitutional\nliability. We explained:\n\n      DeShaney requires that the state have imposed\n      some kind of limitation on a victim‟s ability to\n      act in his own interests. While specifically\n      referring        to       imprisonment        and\n      institutionalization—the Estelle and Youngberg\n      examples—the court acknowledges that other\n      similar state-imposed restraints of personal\n      liberty trigger a state duty to prevent harm.\n\nId.\n\n      Our finding of a special relationship in Horton also\nturned on the fact that the abuser there acted pursuant to\ndelegated state authority.\n\n      From the evidence the jury could find that New\n      Kensington delegated to [the owner] its\n      traditional police functions . . . . [A] state can\n      be held responsible for a private action if the\n      private actor has exercised coercive power with\n      significant encouragement, overt or covert,\n      from the state. The function of investigating\n      crimes is clearly a governmental function. An\n      official policy of deferring to private owners\n      with respect to the investigation of crimes in\n      private clubs, which the jury could have found\n      from the evidence, suffices to permit a legal\n\n                              22\n\f       conclusion that [the owner], maintaining\n       custody over Mr. Powdrill, was exercising a\n       delegated state function.\n\nId. (citations omitted).\n\n        The custody that the plaintiff in Horton was subjected\n to when he was fatally beaten was thus akin to the state‟s\n custody over prisoners. The township had ceded its police\n authority to detain and interrogate to the club owner. The\n control a school has over its students does not begin to\n approximate the restriction of freedom of movement and\n isolation from possible assistance that existed in Horton or\n other cases prescribed by DeShaney and its progeny.\n\n       Despite our dissenting colleagues‟ suggestion that the\n school‟s passivity here amounted to affirmative conduct,\n there is no assertion that Anderson acted under authority\n delegated by the school or that she “exercised coercive\n power with significant encouragement . . . from” the school.\n See id. In fact, Anderson was disciplined for her conduct.\n Although the school‟s response may well have been as\n inadequate as it was unfair to the Morrow children, the\n school certainly did not give Anderson or her confederate the\n authority to harass or bully the Morrow children. We\n therefore see no conflict between our analysis here and our\n analysis in Horton.\n\n       In reaching this conclusion, we reiterate that we both\nappreciate the Morrows‟ concerns and that we are\nsympathetic to their plight. Parents in their position should be\nable to send their children off to school with some level of\ncomfort that those children will be safe from bullies such as\nAnderson and her confederate. Indeed, the increasing\nprevalence of the kind of bullying alleged here has generated\nconsiderable discussion and legislative action. See T.K. v.\nNew York City Dep’t of Educ., 779 F. Supp. 2d 289, 297-98\n(E.D.N.Y. 2011) (discussing the problem of school bullying\nin the United States).17 Nonetheless, “the Constitution does\n\n17\n   See also Jackie Calmes, Obamas Focus on Antibullying\nEfforts, N.Y. Times, Mar. 10, 2011, available at\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/11/us/politics/11obama.htm\n                              23\n\fnot provide judicial remedies for every social . . . ill.”\nLindsey v. Normet, 405 U.S. 56, 74 (1972). Given the\nlimitations of DeShaney, and the language in Vernonia, it is\nnow clear that the redress the Morrows seek must come from\na source other than the United States Constitution.\n\n        Our dissenting colleagues take us to task for\nexpressing concern for the Morrows‟ plight without providing\na remedy and suggest that the very fact that we are troubled\nby the result counsels in favor of a constitutional remedy. See\nFuentes Dissent 2 (“The Morrows are today left without a\nlegal remedy for these actions. That future victims may seek\nrelief from State legislatures is of no help to them. We do not\nadequately discharge our duty to interpret the Constitution by\nmerely describing the facts [of these cases] as „tragic‟ and\ninvoking state tort law.”) (internal citation and quotation\nmarks omitted) (alteration in original); Ambro Partial\nConcurrence and Partial Dissent 1 (“I share Judge Fuentes‟\nconcern that failing to hold a school accountable for violence\ndone to students creates an incentive for school administrators\nto pursue inaction when they are uniquely situated to prevent\nharm to their students.”).\n\n        However, “the due process clause is not a surrogate for\nlocal tort law or state statutory and administrative remedies.”\nHasenfus v. LaJeunesse, 175 F.3d 68, 74 (1st Cir. 1999). Nor\nis “[s]ubstantive due process . . . a license for judges to\nsupersede the decisions of local officials and elected\nlegislators on such matters.” Id.\n\n       Obviously, neither our holding here nor the Supreme\nCourt‟s jurisprudence forecloses states from providing public\nschool students and their parents with personally enforceable\nremedies under state law. We realize that Pennsylvania‟s\ncourts have held that school districts are “the beneficiaries of\nimmunity pursuant to the [Political Subdivision Tort Claim]\n\nl. In light of the growing problem of school bullying, 49\nstates, including Pennsylvania, see 24 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 13-\n1303.1-A, have now passed anti-bullying laws. U.S. Dep‟t of\nHealth & Human Servs., Policies & Laws,\nwww.stopbullying.gov/laws/index.html (last visited Jan. 7,\n2013).\n\n                              24\n\fAct” (now codified at 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 8541) and are not\nsubject to “tort liability . . . when students are injured in the\ncourse of the school day, even if, assuming arguendo, there\nwas negligence on the part of the school officials.” Auerbach\nv. Council Rock Sch. Dist., 459 A.2d 1376, 1378 (Pa.\nCommw. Ct. 1983). However, state legislatures retain the\nauthority to reconsider and change such restrictions in order\nto better respond to the kind of bullying that happened here\nand that appears to be all too pervasive in far too many of\ntoday‟s schools. See T.K. v. New York City Dep’t of Educ.,\n779 F. Supp. 2d at 297-98.\n\n       For the reasons we have explained, we cannot fashion\na constitutional remedy under the special relationship theory\nbased on the facts alleged in this case.\n\n                  B. State-Created Danger\n\n        The Morrows alternatively argue that the Defendants\nhad a duty to protect Brittany and Emily because they created\nor exacerbated a dangerous situation. As we explained above,\nin Kneipp v. Tedder, 95 F.3d at 1201, we first adopted the\nstate-created danger theory as a way to establish a\nconstitutional violation in suits brought under § 1983. We\nconfirmed that liability may attach where the state acts to\ncreate or enhance a danger that deprives the plaintiff of his or\nher Fourteenth Amendment right to substantive due process.\nKneipp, 95 F.3d at 1205. To prevail on this theory, the\nMorrows must prove the following four elements:\n\n      1) the harm ultimately caused was foreseeable\nand fairly direct;\n\n       2) a state actor acted with a degree of\n       culpability that shocks the conscience;\n\n       3) a relationship between the state and the\n       plaintiff existed such that the plaintiff was a\n       foreseeable victim of the defendant‟s acts, or a\n       member of a discrete class of persons subjected\n       to the potential harm brought about by the\n       state‟s actions, as opposed to a member of the\n       public in general; and\n\n                               25\n\f       4) a state actor affirmatively used his or her\n       authority in a way that created a danger to the\n       citizen or that rendered the citizen more\n       vulnerable to danger than had the state not acted\n       at all.\n\nBright v. Westmoreland Cnty., 443 F.3d 276, 281 (3d Cir.\n2006) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n       The Defendants focus on the last prong of the test.18\nThey argue that the Morrows have failed to allege any\naffirmative action by school administrators that made the\nMorrow children more vulnerable than they would have been\nhad the administrators stood by and done nothing at all. The\nMorrows argue that the Defendants‟ affirmative act was\nsuspending Anderson, and then implicitly inviting her to\nreturn to school following the suspension. In other words, the\nMorrows argue that by permitting Anderson to return to\nschool rather than expelling her, school officials affirmatively\nused their authority to create a danger that Anderson would\nattack Brittany and Emily once again. The Morrows also\npoint to the “affirmative act” of allowing Anderson to board\nthe Morrow children‟s school bus, where Anderson\nthreatened to attack Brittany.\n\n       We have explained that the line between action and\ninaction is not always easily drawn. “„If the state puts a man\nin a position of danger from private persons and then fails to\nprotect him, it will not be heard to say that its role was merely\npassive; it is as much an active tortfeasor as if it had thrown\nhim into a snake pit.‟” Middle Bucks, 972 F.2d at 1374\n(quoting Bowers v. DeVito, 686 F.2d 616, 618 (7th Cir.\n1982)). However, the Morrows‟ Complaint simply attempts\nto redefine clearly passive inaction as affirmative acts. Cf.\nSanford v. Stiles, 456 F.3d 298, 311-12 (3d Cir. 2006)\n(holding that, where a high school guidance counselor failed\nto properly evaluate the sincerity of a student‟s comment to\nanother student that he wanted to kill himself, she had not\n18\n    The Defendants claim that the Morrows cannot prove the\nfirst three prongs of the test either, but their primary focus is\non prong four.\n\n                                26\n\fcommitted an affirmative act but rather failed to prevent his\ndeath).\n\n        We are not persuaded by the Morrows‟ argument that\nthe Defendants affirmatively created or enhanced a danger to\nBrittany and Emily by suspending Anderson and then\nallowing her to return to school when the suspension ended.\nAlthough the suspension was an affirmative act by school\nofficials, we fail to see how the suspension created a new\ndanger for the Morrow children or “rendered [them] more\nvulnerable to danger than had the state not acted at all.”\nBright, 443 F.3d at 281. To the contrary, the suspension\nlikely made the Morrows safer, albeit temporarily. In\naddition, the fact that Defendants failed to expel Anderson,\nor, as the Morrows would describe it, “permitted” Anderson\nto return to school after the suspension ended, does not\nsuggest an affirmative act.\n\n        While the Morrows make much of the fact that\nDefendants‟ failure to expel Anderson after she was\nadjudicated “guilty of a crime” may have been contrary to a\nschool policy mandating expulsion in such circumstances, we\ndecline to hold that a school‟s alleged failure to enforce a\ndisciplinary policy is equivalent to an affirmative act under\nthe circumstances here.\n\n        The dissent argues that Defendants‟ failure to expel\nAnderson constitutes an affirmative “exercise of authority”\nthat contributed to the danger the Morrows faced, thereby\ntriggering a duty to protect. Under this reasoning, however,\nevery decision by school officials to use or decline to use\ntheir authority, disciplinary or otherwise, would constitute\naffirmative conduct that may trigger a duty to protect. The\ndissent claims that “state authority necessarily brings with it\ndiscretion as to whether or not to take specific actions, and\nthe decision to take one action over another—or to take no\naction at all—is itself an „affirmative exercise of authority‟\nthat may carry serious consequences.” Fuentes Dissent 24.\nThus, were we to accept the dissent‟s formulation here, the\nstate-created danger exception would swallow the rule. 19\n\n19\n  Judge Ambro also makes a very forceful point in\nexpressing a concern that “creating a constitutional tort out of\n                               27\n\fSchools would always be liable, under the Dissent‟s view, for\nany injury that could be linked to either action or inaction.\nAny and all failures to act would be transformed into an\naffirmative exercise of authority.\n\n        The Morrows also rely on the fact that the Defendants\npermitted Anderson to board Emily and Brittany‟s bus despite\nknowing about the no-contact orders against Anderson, and\nknowing that that bus did not service Anderson‟s home route.\nHowever, the only reasonable interpretation of that allegation\nis that the Defendants failed to take any affirmative steps to\nensure that Anderson did not board the Morrow children‟s\nbus.20 Here again, the Complaint attempts to morph passive\ninaction into affirmative acts. However, merely restating the\nDefendants‟ inaction as an affirmative failure to act does not\nalter the passive nature of the alleged conduct.\n\n        As Judge Ambro explains, the requirement of an actual\naffirmative act “is not intended to turn on semantics of act\nand omission. Instead, the requirement serves . . . to\ndistinguish cases where . . . officials might have done more . .\n. [from] cases where . . . officials created or increased the risk\nitself.” Ambro Partial Concurrence and Partial Dissent 1.\nWe therefore hold that the Complaint also fails to state a\ncause of action under the state-created danger exception.\n\n                     IV. CONCLUSION\n\n\n\n\na school‟s failure to expel a student creates a too-easy\nincentive for schools to expel quickly students who engage in\nany violent behavior in order to avoid liability or the threat of\nsuit.” Ambro Partial Concurrence and Partial Dissent 3.\n20\n  For example, school authorities could have alerted the\nappropriate bus drivers of the no-contact orders against\nAnderson and given drivers a photograph of Anderson so they\ncould identify her and prevent her from boarding the wrong\nbus.\n\n                               28\n\f       For all the reasons set forth above, we will affirm the\n District Court‟s order granting the Defendants‟ Motion to\n Dismiss.21\n\n\n\n\n21\n   Because the Morrows cannot make out a claim under\neither the special relationship or state-created danger theories\nof constitutional liability, we need not address whether\ndefendant Balaski should be afforded qualified immunity or\nwhether the School District may be held liable as a municipal\ndefendant.\n\n                               29\n\fSMITH, Circuit Judge, concurring.\n\n       I join Chief Judge McKee‘s well-reasoned majority\nopinion in its entirety. I write separately only to explain the\nlimited circumstances under which I believe we may overrule\none of our prior en banc decisions.\n\n        ―Stare decisis should be more than a fine-sounding\nphrase.‖ Oregon ex rel. State Land Bd. v. Corvallis Sand &\nGravel Co., 429 U.S. 363, 394 (1977) (Marshall, J.,\ndissenting). Yet it is nothing more than that if it does not\nrequire us, in the ordinary course, to adhere to a precedent\nwith which we disagree. And even sitting en banc, we do not\nconduct a plenary re-examination of our prior decisions; we\ninstead remain constrained by our precedent ―to the degree\ncounseled by principles of stare decisis.‖ Bolden v. Se. Pa.\nTransp. Auth., 953 F.2d 807, 813 (3d Cir. 1991) (en banc).\nIndeed, ―even in constitutional cases‖ such as this one, the\ndoctrine of stare decisis ―carries such persuasive force‖ that\ndeparting from it has ―always required‖ some ―special\njustification.‖ Arizona v. Rumsey, 467 U.S. 203, 212 (1984).\n\n      According to the Supreme Court, those justifications\nmust be nothing short of ―exceptional.‖1 Randall v. Sorrell,\n\n1\n  This is not to say that courts never encounter longstanding\nprecedent that must be consigned to the dustbin of history.\nThe clearest example is Plessy v. Ferguson. In Plessy, the\nSupreme Court concluded that state-mandated racial\nsegregation in educational facilities could satisfy equal\nprotection as long as the facilities were physically equivalent.\nPlessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537, 551 (1896). The Court did\n                               1\n\fso largely because it rejected the argument that enforced\nsegregation laws were intended to ―stamp[] [blacks] with a\nbadge of inferiority.‖ Id. The next sixty years of experience,\nhowever, directly disproved this premise, showing that\nseparate-but-equal facilities nonetheless had the effect of\ncreating unequal educational opportunities based on race.\nBrown v. Bd. of Educ. of Topeka, Shawnee Cnty., Kan., 347\nU.S. 483, 493–95 (1954) (―Whatever may have been the\nextent of psychological knowledge at the time of Plessy v.\nFerguson, this finding is amply supported by modern\nauthority.‖). Such experience justified—indeed, required—\nthe Court to correct its clearly erroneous interpretation of the\npurpose behind the enforced segregation laws and overrule\nPlessy. See id. at 495.\n        A less egregious example of precedent that was rightly\ndiscarded is Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. John D. Park & Sons\nCo. In Dr. Miles, the Supreme Court held that vertical price\nagreements between a manufacturer and its distributors were\nper se antitrust violations. 200 U.S. 376, 407–08 (1911). The\nCourt reasoned that such vertical agreements were\neconomically analogous to unlawful horizontal agreements\namong competing distributors because vertical agreements\nalways tended to restrict competition and decrease output. Id.\nat 408. Nearly a century later, though, the Supreme Court\nrecognized the ―differences in economic effect between\nvertical and horizontal agreements, differences the Dr. Miles\nCourt failed to consider.‖ Leegin Creative Leather Prods.,\nInc. v. PSKS, Inc., 551 U.S. 877, 889 (2007). With the\n―economic literature [] replete with procompetitive\njustifications‖ for vertical price agreements between\n                               2\n\f548 U.S. 230, 244 (2006) (quoting Rumsey, 467 U.S. at 212).\nIf its precedent‘s reasoning was clearly wrong, then stare\ndecisis loses some (though not all) of its force. See Dickerson\nv. United States, 530 U.S. 428, 443 (2000) (―Whether or not\nwe would agree with Miranda‘s reasoning and its resulting\nrule[] were we addressing the issue in the first instance, the\nprinciples of stare decisis weigh heavily against overruling it\nnow.‖); see also McDonald v. City of Chi., Ill., 130 S. Ct.\n3020, 3050 (2010) (Scalia, J., concurring) (―Despite my\nmisgivings about Substantive Due Process as an original\nmatter, I have acquiesced in the Court‘s incorporation of\ncertain guarantees in the Bill of Rights because it is both long\nestablished and narrowly limited.‖ (quotation marks and\ncitation omitted)).     Perhaps a prior case has become\nunworkable—that is, newly discovered facts have\nundermined the case‘s reasoning, subsequent legal\ndevelopments have unmoored the case from its doctrinal\nanchors, or ―experience has [otherwise] pointed up the\nprecedent‘s shortcomings.‖ Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S.\n223, 233 (2009); Leegin Creative Leather Prods., Inc. v.\nPSKS, Inc., 551 U.S. 877, 887–88 (2007). And if the\nprecedent is particularly recent and has not generated any\nserious reliance interests, the rigging controlling the sails of\nstare decisis carries additional slack. See, e.g., Citizens\nUnited v. FEC, 130 S. Ct. 876, 912–13 (2010); Montejo v.\nLouisiana, 556 U.S. 778, 793 (2009).\n\n      As other courts of appeals have concluded, these same\nconsiderations should guide our own stare decisis analysis.\n\nmanufacturers and distributors, the Supreme Court properly\noverruled Dr. Miles.

Pate, 20\nF.3d 1550, 1565 n.21 (11th Cir. 1994) (en banc) (same).\n\n       None of these special justifications are present here.\n\n        Middle Bucks‘s interpretation of the Supreme Court‘s\ndecision in DeShaney v. Winnebago County Department of\nSocial Services, 489 U.S. 189, 196–97 (1989), was correct at\nthe time it was decided. DeShaney held that substantive due\nprocess does not confer a right to state protection except\nwhen the state affirmatively acts to restrict a person‘s\n―freedom to act on his own behalf, through imprisonment,\ninstitutionalization, or other similar restraint of personal\nliberty.‖ Id. at 200. In D.R. v. Middle Bucks Area Vocational\nTechnical School, we interpreted ―other similar restraint of\npersonal liberty‖ to require total and involuntary state custody\nwith no access to private assistance. 972 F.2d 1364, 1371 (3d\nCir. 1992) (en banc) (―Institutionalized persons are wholly\n                               4\n\fdependent upon the state for food, shelter, clothing, and\nsafety. It is not within their power to provide for themselves,\nnor are they given the opportunity to seek outside help to\nmeet their basic needs. Obviously, they are not free to\nleave.‖). We then concluded that, unlike prisoners and\ninstitutionalized individuals, students are not rendered totally\ndependent on the state just because the state requires them to\nattend school. Id.\n\n        The reasonableness of that interpretation of\nDeShaney‘s state-restraint requirement is self-evident. To be\nsure, the Middle Bucks dissent viewed DeShaney‘s state-\nrestraint requirement more expansively to reach not only\ncustodial restraints such as incarceration and involuntary\ninstitutionalization but also situations in which an individual\nfaces ―substantial [state] compulsion.‖ Id. at 1379 (Sloviter,\nJ., dissenting).       But compared to incarceration and\ninstitutionalization, substantial state compulsion is not a\n―similar restraint of personal liberty‖: a state can substantially\ncompel a person without ―so restrain[ing] [his] liberty that it\nrenders him unable to care for himself‖ while ―fail[ing] to\nprovide for his basic human needs.‖ DeShaney, 489 U.S. at\n200. Even if, as the majority notes, ―the Supreme Court‘s\njurisprudence [at the time of Middle Bucks] allowed room to\ndebate this issue,‖ Majority Op. at 13, the very point of stare\ndecisis is to forbid us from revisiting a debate every time\nthere are reasonable arguments to be made on both sides.\nAgostini v. Felton, 521 U.S. 203, 235 (1997) (explaining that\nstare decisis reflects ―a policy judgment that ‗in most matters\nit is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled\nthan that it be settled right‘‖ (quoting Burnet v. Coronado Oil\n& Gas Co., 285 U.S. 393, 406 (1932) (Brandeis, J.,\n                                5\n\fconcurring))). Middle Bucks‘s reasoning was not so clearly\nwrong that we may—or should—cast it aside.\n\n        And that is especially true when one considers the\nlimited nature of en banc review. En banc review is primarily\nreserved for correcting and maintaining consistency in panel\ndecisions involving difficult and important questions of law.\nFed. R. App. P. 35(a); see, e.g., United States v. Games-\nPerez, 695 F.3d 1104, 1124 (10th Cir. 2012) (Gorsuch, J.,\ndissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc) (―[S]urely it\nis uncontroversial to suggest that the point of the en banc\nprocess, the very reason for its existence, is to correct grave\nerrors in panel precedents when they become apparent . . . .‖\n(emphasis added)); Pfizer, Inc. v . Apotex, Inc., 488 F.3d\n1377, 1380–81 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (Newman, J., dissenting from\nthe denial of rehearing en banc) (―The function of en banc\nhearings . . . is not only to eliminate intra-circuit conflicts, but\nalso to correct and deter panel opinions that are pretty clearly\nwrong.‖ (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks and\ncitations omitted)). We do not sit en banc to ―reopen settled\nissues which have already been given en banc treatment‖\nabsent intervening developments undermining our earlier\ndecision. Igartua v. United States, 654 F.3d 99, 100 (1st Cir.\n2011) (Lynch, J., concurring in the denial of en banc review);\nsee also McKinney, 20 F.3d at 1565 n.21 (―[T]his is the first\ntime this court sitting en banc has addressed this issue; thus,\nthe implications of stare decisis are less weighty than if we\nwere overturning a precedent established by the court en\nbanc.‖). Absent such exceptional intervening developments,\nthe ―essence of stare decisis is that the mere existence of\n[Middle Bucks] becomes a reason for adhering to [its]\nholding[] in subsequent cases.‖ United States v. Reyes-\n                                 6\n\fHernandez, 624 F.3d 405, 412 (7th Cir. 2010) (internal\nquotation marks and citations omitted).\n\n        Intervening legal and factual developments have only\nstrengthened our decision in Middle Bucks. Since then, the\nSupreme Court has sharply circumscribed substantive due\nprocess, limiting its protections to only those ―carefully\ndescribed,‖ unenumerated rights that are ―‗deeply rooted in\nthis Nation‘s history and tradition‘‖ and ―‗implicit in the\nconcept of ordered liberty.‘‖ Chavez v. Martinez, 538 U.S.\n760, 775 (2003) (quoting Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S.\n702, 720–21 (1997)); see also Dist. Att’y’s Office for Third\nJudicial Dist. v. Osborne, 557 U.S. 52, 69 (2009) (refusing to\nrecognize a liberty interest protected by due process unless it\nis ―so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as\nto be ranked as fundamental‖ (internal quotation marks and\ncitation omitted)).\n\n       It can hardly be said that ―neither liberty nor justice\nwould exist,‖ id., by forgoing a judicially enforceable right\nagainst the states to protect students from private harm.\nHistory points the other way. Under the doctrine of in loco\nparentis, states have long permitted schools to exercise\ncontrol over students on the theory that parents delegated part\nof their parental authority to the schools during the school\nday.      See, e.g., 24 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 13-1317.\n―[S]choolteachers and administrators had almost complete\ndiscretion to establish and enforce the rules they believed\nwere necessary to maintain control over their classrooms‖—\ndiscretion that the ―judiciary was reluctant to interfere‖ with.\nSafford Unified Sch. Dist. No. 1 v. Redding, 557 U.S. 364,\n383, 398 (2009) (Thomas, J., concurring) (internal quotations\n                               7\n\fand citations omitted); see also D.O.F. v. Lewisburg Area\nSch. Dist. Bd. of Sch. Dirs., 868 A.2d 28, 33 (Pa. Commw. Ct.\n2004) (noting that ―local school boards have broad discretion\nin determining school disciplinary policy‖ and that a court\nmay not act as ―a ‗super‘ school board‖ by ―substituting its\nown judgment for that of the school district‖); Washington v.\nSeattle Sch. Dist. No. 1, 458 U.S. 457, 481 (1982) (―No single\ntradition in public education is more deeply rooted than local\ncontrol over the operation of schools . . . .‖ (quoting Milliken\nv. Bradley, 418 U.S. 717, 741 (1974))). Faced with a\ntradition that once permitted almost no judicial limitations on\nschools‘ disciplinary authority, id. at 416, I cannot conclude\nthat substantive due process enshrines the opposite—a right\nto judicial intervention in school disciplinary decisions. The\n―mere novelty of such a claim is reason enough to doubt that\n‗substantive due process‘ sustains it.‖ Osborne, 557 U.S. at\n72 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n        Just as the constriction of substantive due process has\nbolstered Middle Bucks‘s vitality, there are no new factual\ndevelopments that undermine the decision‘s reasoning. To be\nsure, a body of intervening research has revealed that school\nbullying undeniably causes serious harm to its victims. This\nevidence, however, has no bearing on Middle Bucks‘s two-\npart rationale. First, the severity of harm caused by bullying\nis irrelevant to Middle Bucks‘s constitutional judgment that\nsubstantive due process is not triggered by substantial state\ncompulsion. See, e.g., Planned Parenthood of Se. Pa. v.\nCasey, 505 U.S. 833, 860 (1992) (acknowledging that ―time\nhas overtaken some of [Roe v. Wade‘s] factual assumptions‖\nabout when a fetus is viable and when abortions are safe for\nthe mother, but concluding that these developments ―have no\n                               8\n\fbearing‖ on the ―soundness or unsoundness of [Roe‘s]\nconstitutional judgment‖ that ―viability marks the earliest\npoint at which the State‘s interest in fetal life is\nconstitutionally adequate to justify a legislative ban on\nnontherapeutic abortions‖). After all, substantive due process\n―does not entail a body of constitutional law imposing\nliability whenever someone cloaked with state authority\ncauses harm.‖ Cnty. of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833,\n848 (1998).\n\n       Second, empirical revelations about bullying‘s effects\ndo not change Middle Bucks‘s factual judgment that\ncompulsory education laws fall short of making students\nwholly dependent on the state. If anything, students are\nsubjected to less state compulsion today than at the time of\nMiddle Bucks.       With increased availability of private\nschooling, homeschooling, private tutoring, online and\ndistance education, and charter schools, modern families have\nmore options to satisfy the compulsory school laws. And\nschool authority over students has significantly eroded in\nfavor of parental control and private sources of assistance.\nSee New Jersey v. T.L.O., 469 U.S. 325, 336 (1985) (―More\ngenerally, the Court has recognized that the concept of\nparental delegation as a source of school authority is not\nentirely consonant with compulsory education laws. Today‘s\npublic school officials do not merely exercise authority\nvoluntarily conferred on them by individual parents; rather,\nthey act in furtherance of publicly mandated educational and\ndisciplinary policies.‖ (internal quotation marks and citations\nomitted)). The most serious disciplinary problems are\nhandled by police officers and the legal system, not school\nadministrators and the disciplinary code. See, e.g., In re R.H.,\n                               9\n\f791 A.2d 331 (Pa. 2002); Commonwealth v. Williams, 749\nA.2d 957 (Pa. Super. Ct. 2000). States no longer permit\nschools to inflict corporal punishment. See, e.g., 22 Pa. Code\n§ 12.5(a). And so forth.\n\n        Students these days also have the protection of state\ntort laws that did not exist when we decided Middle Bucks.\nNearly every state has enacted anti-bullying laws since we\ndecided Middle Bucks, showing that our decision has not\nprevented states from experimenting with their own solutions\nto the problems of bullying. There is ―no institutional need to\nsend judges off on [a] ‗mission-almost-impossible‘‖ to\nprevent and cure the effects of school bullying when\nlegislators ―are able ‗to amass the stuff of actual experience\nand cull conclusions from it.‘‖ McDonald, 130 S. Ct. at 3128\n(Breyer, J., dissenting) (quoting United States v. Gainey, 380\nU.S. 63, 67 (1965)). ―To suddenly constitutionalize this area\nwould short-circuit what looks to be a prompt and considered\nlegislative response.‖ Osborne, 557 U.S. at 73. If the people\nof Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey and the Virgin\nIslands want to expose their schools to greater liability for\ninaction, or if they desire different solutions to the problem\nthat all on this en banc court agree bullying to be, it is their\nprerogative to do so. Middle Bucks does not stand in their\nway.\n\n       In fact, Pennsylvania, like many other states, has\ndeliberately chosen not to make schools and other local\ngovernment agencies liable for claims like the Morrows‘.\nPennsylvania Political Subdivision Tort Claims Act, 42 Pa.\nCons. Stat. §§ 8541–42; see Sanford v. Stiles, 456 F.3d 298,\n315 (3d Cir. 2006) (per curiam) (explaining that local state\n                              10\n\fagencies, including school districts, are ―given broad tort\nimmunity‖ under the Pennsylvania Political Subdivision Tort\nClaims Act); Tackett v. Pine Richland Sch. Dist., 793 A.2d\n1022, 1025 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 2002) (holding that the\nPennsylvania Political Subdivision Tort Claims Act\nimmunized a school district from liability where a teacher‘s\nalleged failure to supervise students‘ chemistry experiment\ncaused an explosion and severely burned a student);\nAuerbach v. Council Rock Sch. Dist., 459 A.2d 1376, 1378\n(Pa. Commw. Ct. 1983) (holding that the Political\nSubdivision Tort Claims Act immunized a school district\nfrom liability for student-on-student injuries, even if school\ndistrict allegedly failed to protect the victim or supervise the\nattacker); Husser v. Sch. Dist. of Pittsburgh, 228 A.2d 910,\n910–11 (Pa. 1967) (holding that a school district was entitled\nto governmental immunity for a student‘s on-campus\nmugging even if school officials knew of ―similar criminal\nacts [that had] occurred with great frequency . . . in the\nmonths immediately prior to the attack‖ and took no\nprecautionary measures). And of course, state law usually\nprovides victims with the ability to sue and recover from\nbullies who assault, inflict emotional distress on, or commit\nother torts against fellow students and from the parents whose\nnegligent care allow the bullies to do so. See Restatement\n(Second) of Torts §§ 283A (discussing children‘s tort\nliability), 316 (discussing a parent‘s tort liability for\nnegligently controlling his child); see, e.g., Condel v. Savo, 39\nA.2d 51, 53 (Pa. 1944) (permitting a tort action against\nparents who ―kn[e]w of the habit of their child of striking\nother children with sticks‖ and took ―no steps to correct, or\nrestrain‖ the child).\n\n                               11\n\f        Lastly, even though Middle Bucks is only two decades\nold, schools have come to rely on it in developing their\npersonnel and behavioral policies. Schools have long\noperated under a regime in which they have no affirmative\nfederal duty to protect students from private violence during\nthe school day. There is no reason to upset these expectations\nby imposing an amorphous, judicially created standard that\nraises more questions than it answers—especially when states\nhave proven themselves capable of addressing the problem of\nbullying. Osborne, 557 U.S. at 74 (―It is hard to imagine\nwhat tools federal courts would use to answer [such\nquestions]. . . . [T]here is no reason to suspect that their\nanswers to these questions would be any better than those of\nstate courts and legislatures, and good reason to suspect the\nopposite.‖); McDonald, 130 S. Ct. at 3101 (Stevens, J.,\ndissenting) (―Another key constraint on substantive due\nprocess analysis is respect for the democratic process. If a\nparticular liberty interest is already being given careful\nconsideration in, and subjected to ongoing calibration by, the\nStates, judicial enforcement may not be appropriate.‖).\nAbruptly reversing course would require precisely the sort of\n―extensive legislative response‖ that stare decisis aims to\navoid. Hilton v. S.C. Pub. Rys. Comm’n, 502 U.S. 197, 202\n(1991) (noting that stare decisis ―has added force‖ when the\nlegislature has relied on a previous decision in such a way\nthat overruling that decision would ―require an extensive\nlegislative response‖).\n\n       It comes as no surprise, then, that Middle Bucks is no\n―legal anomaly‖ deserving of abandonment. Randall, 548\nU.S. at 244. Aside from the Second and D.C. Circuits, which\nhave not considered the issue, all other courts of appeals have\n                              12\n\fheld that compulsory school attendance, coupled with\nschools‘ authority over their students, does not trigger the\nprotections of substantive due process.

It is ―rarely appropriate to\noverrule circuit precedent just to move from one side of the\nconflict to another,‖ United States v. Corner, 598 F.3d 411,\n414 (7th Cir. 2010) (en banc), and no ―compelling basis‖\nwarrants our creating a conflict here where none exists,\nWagner v. PennWest Farm Credit, ACA, 109 F.3d 909, 912\n(3d Cir. 1997) (―In light of such an array of [unanimous]\nprecedent [from seven other courts of appeals], we would\nrequire a compelling basis to hold otherwise before effecting\na circuit split.‖); Butler Cnty.

Ct. at 911–12. Departing from\n                             13\n\fMiddle Bucks would create a circuit split in exchange for\nforsaking the Supreme Court‘s repeated reluctance against\nexpanding substantive due process. See NASA v. Nelson, 131\nS. Ct. 746, 756 n.10 (2011). That, to me, is a lose-lose\nproposition.\n\n\n\n\n                           14\n\fAMBRO, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in\npart\n\n       I share Judge Fuentes’s concern that failing to hold a\nschool accountable for violence done to students creates an\nincentive for school administrators to pursue inaction when\nthey are uniquely situated to prevent harm to their students.\nFor that reason, as well as the others in Judge Fuentes’s\nexceptional opinion, I wholeheartedly join Part I of the\ndissent, and would hold that a special relationship exists\nbetween the School and its students.\n\n       But I cannot agree that the facts of this case\ndemonstrate a cause of action under our state-created danger\ntheory. The majority concludes that the School’s decision not\nto expel Anderson is a failure to act and one that did not\nrender the Morrows more susceptible to danger. I agree, but\nthink we must delve further. Thus, while I join that part of\nthe Court’s judgment, I write separately on this issue.\n\n        The fourth requirement of our state-created danger\nclaim is that ―a state actor affirmatively used his or her\nauthority in a way that created a danger to the citizen or that\nrendered the citizen more vulnerable to danger than had the\nstate not acted at all.‖ Bright v. Westmoreland Cnty., 443\nF.3d 276, 281 (3d Cir. 2006). This test, I believe, is not\nintended to turn on the semantics of act and omission.\nInstead, the requirement serves an important purpose: to\ndistinguish cases where government officials might have done\nmore to protect a citizen from a risk of harm in contrast to\ncases where government officials created or increased the risk\nitself. Following violence, suffering, and/or death of one of\nour citizens, we often wish that a state actor with the authority\nto do so had intervened. We are not comforted by concluding\nthat officials failed to act when we could just as easily say\nthat they affirmatively decided to do something. But we are\n\n\n\n\n                               1\n\flimited by the protection afforded by the Constitution and the\nSupreme Court’s holding in DeShaney v. Winnebago Cnty.\nDep’t of Soc. Servs., 489 U.S. 189, 197 (1989) (―[A] State’s\nfailure to protect an individual . . . simply does not constitute\na violation of the Due Process Clause.‖).              We have\nrecognized a narrow exception to DeShaney’s rule: a\nconstitutional remedy may exist when a government actor\ncreates or increases the risk to a citizen. Id. at 201; Kneipp v.\nTedder, 95 F.3d 1199 (3d Cir. 1996).\n\n        Judge Fuentes makes the most compelling case\npossible: ―it may be inferred from the Complaint that the\nSchool did do something‖ by deciding to suspend rather than\nexpel Anderson, and then continuing to keep her in school\ndespite repeated acts of violence, criminal adjudication, and a\ndisciplinary code that directed expulsion. Fuentes Dissent 26.\nBut the context of the School’s decision—the prior violence,\nthe no-contact order, the disciplinary code, and the ability to\nprotect the Morrows by expelling Anderson—are factors\nrelevant to the School’s special relationship with the\nMorrows. I do not believe we can consider these factors to\ndeem the School’s behavior a creation of risk. The School\nacted no differently in failing to protect a vulnerable member\nof society from harm than defendants in cases where no state-\ncreated danger exists, including DeShaney. 489 U.S. at 201\n(risk of abuse suffered by four year old left in the care of his\nfather was not created by social workers who had previously\nremoved him and returned him to the home); Sanford v.\nStiles, 456 F.3d 298, 311–12 (3d Cir. 2006) (high school\nstudent’s risk of suicide not caused or increased by guidance\ncounselor who met with him twice); Bright, 443 F.3d 276\n(risk of attack not created by police who failed to arrest\nattacker after he violated parole).\n\n       Holding that the School’s actions—or lack thereof—in\nthis case were sufficient to plead a state-created danger claim\n\n\n\n\n                               2\n\fwould substantially broaden this narrow exception.\nDeShaney is grounded in constitutional law, but has an\nimportant practical effect too. Federal courts cannot be the\nforum for every complaint that a government actor could have\ntaken an alternate course that would have avoided harm to\none of our citizens. I also worry that creating a constitutional\ntort out of a school’s failure to expel a student creates a too-\neasy incentive for schools to expel quickly students who\nengage in any violent behavior in order to avoid liability or\nthe threat of suit.\n\n       The special relationship theory, which is far more\ncircumscribed, does not present this same risk. Accordingly,\nI concur in part and dissent in part.\n\n\n\n\n                               3\n\fFUENTES, Circuit Judge, with whom Judges Jordan,\nVanaskie, and Nygaard join, and with whom Judge Ambro\njoins as to part I, dissenting:\n\n       Over the course of several months, minors Brittany\nand Emily Morrow (the “Morrows”) suffered repeated\nphysical and verbal assaults at the hand of a bully and her\nfriend, classmates in their public school in the Blackhawk\nSchool District in Pennsylvania (the “School” or\n“Blackhawk”).1 The attacks included racially motivated\nassaults, verbal harassment of the Morrows in their home and\non-line, attempting to push Brittany down a flight of stairs\nduring school hours, and violent physical assaults on the\nMorrows at a School football game and on a school bus.\nEarly on in this history of attacks, the bully was charged by\nthe authorities with assault and making terroristic threats, was\neventually placed on probation by the Court of Common\nPleas, and was ordered to have no contact with Brittany.\nSchool officials were aware of these proceedings and had\neven suspended the bully for a brief period before she was\n\n1\n  This appeal comes to us following the District Court‟s\ndismissal pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). Therefore, all that is\nrequired is that the Complaint “contain sufficient factual\nmatter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is\nplausible on its face.” Ill. Nat’l Ins. Co. v. Wyndham\nWorldwide Operations, Inc., 653 F.3d 225, 230 (3d Cir. 2011)\n(citing Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009)) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). “[W]e accept as true all allegations\nin the plaintiff‟s complaint as well as all reasonable\ninferences that can be drawn from them, and we construe\nthem in a light most favorable to the non-movant.” Monroe v.\nBeard, 536 F.3d 198, 205 (3d Cir. 2008).\n\n\n\n\n                               1\n\fplaced on probation. Nevertheless, the bully was readmitted\nto School and some of the instances of violence described\nabove occurred after her return. Eventually, the bully was\nadjudicated a juvenile delinquent and was again ordered to\nhave no contact with Brittany. It also bears noting that many\nof the bully‟s attacks occurred after Blackhawk officials had\nsuspended the Morrows themselves for their involvement in\nthe dispute, pursuant to the School‟s “No Tolerance Policy.”\nIt is reasonable to infer that, to the Morrows, application of\nthe policy (which could have led to their permanent expulsion\nfrom the School) meant that they risked disciplinary action\nshould they act to forestall attacks by the bully. Despite all\nthis, Blackhawk officials refused to protect the Morrows from\ndanger. When the Morrows sought help, they were told that\nthe School would not guarantee their safety and, surprisingly,\nthat their best course of action would be to find another\nschool.\n\n        The Morrows are today left without a legal remedy for\nthese actions. That future victims may seek relief from State\nlegislatures, Majority Op. at 23-25, is of no help to them.\n“We do not adequately discharge our duty to interpret the\nConstitution by merely describing the facts [of these cases] as\n„tragic‟ and invoking state tort law.” Doe ex rel. Magee v.\nCovington Cnty. Sch. Dist., 675 F.3d 849, 886-87 (5th Cir.\n2012) (en banc) (Weiner, J., dissenting) (citing Maldonado v.\nJosey, 975 F.2d 727, 735 (10th Cir. 1992) (Seymour, J.,\nconcurring)).\n\n        Worse, today‟s result is wrong as a matter of law. The\nlegal and factual relationship between students and school\nofficials during the school day, the coercive power that the\nstate exercises over school children, and the role of the school\n\n\n\n\n                               2\n\fofficials in this case in placing the Morrows in greater danger,\nall dictate a result contrary to that reaffirmed and endorsed\ntoday.\n\nI.     The Existence of a “Special Relationship” Between\n       The Morrows And Blackhawk School Officials\n\n        Twenty years ago, a narrow majority of this Court\ndecided in D.R. v. Middle Bucks Area Vocational Technical\nSchool, 972 F.2d 1364 (3d Cir. 1992) (en banc), that school\nofficials have no obligation to protect school children from\nany physical harm that may occur during school hours. Close\nanalysis of the reasoning in Middle Bucks, however, shows\nthat its entire legal basis was a misunderstanding of the\nSupreme Court‟s seminal decision in DeShaney v. Winnebago\nCounty Social Services, 489 U.S. 189 (1989), and of the\nrelationship between the State and school children.\n\n        Reconsidering the coercive power that the State\nexercises over students, and the ways in which the State may\nrestrict a student and his or her parents‟ ability to protect that\nstudent from harm, we would conclude, like Judge Becker in\nMiddle Bucks, that a special relationship may exist under\ncertain narrow circumstances. See Middle Bucks, 972 F.2d at\n1384 (Becker, J., dissenting). As pertains to this case, we\nwould hold that Blackhawk undertook a limited obligation to\nkeep the Morrows safe from harm at the hands of the bully\nbecause Blackhawk compelled school attendance, exercised\nextensive control over not only the student victims but also\nthe specific threat at issue in the case—a violent bully subject\nto two restraining orders that victimized the Morrows over an\nextended period of time—and enforced school policies that\n\n\n\n\n                                3\n\fprevented the Morrows from being fully able to protect\nthemselves.\n\n                              A.\n\n        As the majority outlines, in DeShaney the Supreme\nCourt held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment did not impose on the State of Wisconsin a\nblanket affirmative duty to interfere with the parental\nrelationship between Randy DeShaney and his son Joshua,\nand that therefore the State was not liable for harm the child\nsuffered or was likely to suffer at the hands of his father. 489\nU.S. at 195-96. The Court noted that an affirmative duty to\nprotect arose only if there was a “special relationship”\nbetween the State and the imperiled individual, and that the\nState‟s actions in taking temporary custody of Joshua and\nlater returning him to his father, who was known to be\nabusive, were insufficient to give rise to such a relationship.\nId. at 197-198.\n\n       The DeShaney Court referred to two cases that\nexemplify when a State enters into a special relationship. In\nEstelle v. Gamble, the Court had held that the Eighth\nAmendment imposed a duty to provide “adequate medical\ncare” to prisoners given that they were unable to procure such\ncare on their own “by reason of the deprivation of [their]\nliberty” by the State. Id. at 198-99 (quoting Estelle v.\nGamble, 429 U.S. 97, 103-04 (1976)). And in Youngblood v.\nRomeo, the Court extended Estelle‟s holding to require States\nto provide “involuntarily committed mental patients with such\nservices as are necessary to ensure their „reasonable safety‟\nfrom themselves and others.” Id. at 199 (quoting Youngblood\nv. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 314-325 (1982)).\n\n\n\n\n                               4\n\f       Three years later, in Middle Bucks, we held that a\n“special relationship” did not exist between the State and\nschool children, despite Pennsylvania‟s compulsory education\nlaws. 972 F.2d at 1371-73. As the majority recognizes today,\nthe crux of our holding in Middle Bucks is that although the\nState exercises in loco parentis authority over children during\nschool hours, the parents “remain the primary caretakers”\nover their children. Id. at 1371. In other words, Middle\nBucks‟ central premise is that a student, unlike a prisoner or\nthe involuntarily committed, is not subjected to “full time\nsevere and continuous state restriction.” Id.\n\n        But Middle Bucks provides no basis to conclude that\nDeShaney endorses an all-or-nothing approach that turns on\nthe existence of “round-the-clock” physical custody or on\nwho remained the primary caregiver. See id. at 1379\n(Sloviter, C.J., dissenting). Were the existence of either fact\ndispositive in Estelle, Youngblood, or even DeShaney itself,\nthe Supreme Court surely would have said so explicitly.\nInstead, the Court explained that the common thread that\nunites Estelle and Youngblood is that a person is left “unable\nto care for himself” by the “State‟s affirmative act of\nrestraining the individual‟s freedom to act on his own behalf.”\nDeShaney, 489 U.S. at 200. The Court contrasted these\nsituations to Joshua‟s case by noting that returning Joshua to\nhis father‟s care did not constitute a restraint on his liberty to\nact on his own behalf. Id. The result in DeShaney is also\nexplained by other facts, none of which turns on the lack of\npermanent physical custody: (1) that the “harms Joshua\nsuffered occurred not while he was in the State‟s custody;”\n(2) that the State “played no part in [the] creation” of the\n\n\n\n\n                                5\n\fdanger; and (3) that the State did not do “anything to render\n[Joshua] any more vulnerable.” Id. at 201.2\n\n       Because DeShaney itself did not provide the Middle\nBucks majority with the absolute physical custody\nrequirement, it relied on our prior decision in Philadelphia\nPolice to conclude that DeShaney “set[] out a test of physical\ncustody.”     Middle Bucks, 972 F.2d at 1370 (citing\nPhiladelphia Police & Fire Ass’n v. Philadelphia, 874 F.2d\n156, 167 (3d Cir. 1989)). Philadelphia Police had held that\nthe State is not responsible for harm suffered by mentally\nhandicapped individuals living at home, but it neither requires\nabsolute physical custody nor turns on who the primary\ncaregiver was. See Philadelphia Police, 874 F.2d at 167.\n\n2\n  Moreover, the duty assumed in Estelle was commensurate\nwith the restriction the State had imposed on the individual‟s\nliberty: a prisoner is restrained from seeking medical help on\nhis own, so under Estelle the State must provide it.\nDeShaney, 489 U.S. at 198-99 (citing Estelle, 429 U.S. at\n103-104). Estelle does not recognize a generalized duty to\nprotect prisoners from all harm, despite the fact that prisoners\nare under the permanent physical custody of the State. And\nthe only gloss on Youngblood provided in DeShaney was to\nnote that because the mentally committed were less culpable\nthan the incarcerated and “may not be punished at all,” the\nState takes upon itself a duty, broader than in Estelle, to keep\nsuch individuals safe. Id. at 199 (citation omitted). This\nanalysis suggests that the Court favored a more nuanced look\nat the relationship between the individual and the State,\ncertainly one more flexible than the rigid test of Middle\nBucks.\n\n\n\n\n                               6\n\fIndeed, the case arguably implies that the State could be held\nliable for harm suffered by the individual while in temporary\nState custody. To be sure, Philadelphia Police and DeShaney\nforeclose any argument that the State is responsible for the\nsafety of school children while in their own homes. But\nPhiladelphia Police does not bridge the gap between\nDeShaney and an “absolute physical custody” requirement.\nThus, it is clear that Middle Bucks‟ gloss on DeShaney has no\ndoctrinal foundation.3\n\n\n\n3\n  Middle Bucks‟ absolute physical custody requirement and its\nfocus on who remains the victim‟s primary caregiver also\ncontrast sharply with our holding in Horton v. Flenory, 889\nF.2d 454 (3d Cir. 1989). In Horton, we held that a special\nrelationship existed between the employees and the\nproprietors of a nightclub, who had been delegated law\nenforcement authority by the local police, and that there was a\nduty to protect an employee from harm while he was in the\ntemporary physical custody of the owners. Id. at 458.\nAlthough we sat en banc in Middle Bucks, the Middle Bucks‟\nmajority‟s failure to address Horton‟s interpretation of\nDeShaney is significant. “[R]eturning to the intrinsically\nsounder doctrine established in prior cases may better serve\nthe values of stare decisis.” Citizens United v. Fed. Election\nComm’n, 130 S.Ct. 876, 920 (2010) (Roberts, C.J.,\nconcurring) (quotation marks and citation omitted). We do\nnot suggest that there is a “conflict” between today‟s analysis\nand Horton. See Majority Op. at 23. Horton merely\nillustrates that Middle Bucks‟ absolute physical custody\nrequirement was ill-advised and doctrinally unfounded.\n\n\n\n\n                              7\n\f                                B.\n\n       As the Supreme Court has observed, “[t]he State exerts\ngreat authority and coercive power through mandatory\nattendance requirements.” Edwards v. Aguillard, 482 U.S.\n578, 584 (1987). Reexamining the relationship between\nschool children and the State in light of our understanding of\nDeShaney leads to the inescapable conclusion that a special\nrelationship may exist under certain specific circumstances.\n\n       In Pennsylvania, attending school is obligatory for\nchildren between the ages of eight and seventeen. 24 Pa. Stat.\nAnn. §§ 13-1326, 1327(a). Parents who fail to comply with\nthese mandates face punishment as severe as imprisonment.\nId. §1333(a)(1).4 Once the State compels attendance, it has\nconsiderable power over the child‟s well-being as a matter of\nboth law and fact. Pennsylvania‟s in loco parentis statute\ngives school officials “the same authority as to conduct and\nbehavior over the pupils attending . . . school . . . as the[ir]\nparents.” Id. § 13-1317. And “[t]he rights and liabilities\narising out of an in loco parentis relationship are . . . exactly\nthe same as between parent and child.” T.B. v. L.R.M., 786\nA.2d 913, 916-17 (Pa. 2001).               This may be an\nunderstatement.      A parent may punish a child for\n“incorrigibility,” but he may not, like the State, initiate\njuvenile delinquency proceedings. 24 Pa. Stat. Ann. § 13-\n1338.\n\n\n\n\n4\n  The State‟s first intrusion into the lives of its citizens in the\nschool context may be considered to be when it enrolls all\nparents as the funders of public schools via taxation.\n\n\n\n\n                                8\n\f        It is true that parents retain the ultimate legal custody\nand responsibility over the child. But a parent‟s immediate\nability to protect his child is significantly curtailed during the\ntime the child is in the physical custody of school officials.\nDuring that time, the State may well be the only caregiver to\nwhich children may turn to for help. Middle Bucks attempted\nto dilute the strength of this reasoning by noting that it cannot\n“be denied that a parent is justified in withdrawing his child\nfrom a school where the health and welfare of the child is\nthreatened.” 972 F.2d at 1371 (quoting Zebra v. Sch. Dist. of\nPittsburgh, 296 A.2d 748, 751 (Pa. 1972)). But this\noverlooks that this right is extremely narrow, limited to\nsituations in which a child‟s safety is “positively and\nimmediately threatened.” Commonwealth ex rel. Sch. Dist. of\nPittsburgh v. Ross, 330 A.2d 290, 292 (Pa. Commw. Ct.\n1975). In Ross, a parent could not withdraw a student\nalthough the child had been pushed into a wall and cut with\nscissors by other students. Id. at 291. And in Zebra, a parent\ncould not withdraw his child even though he was threatened\nwith physical harm “if any reports were made to the school\nauthorities” regarding a bully‟s extortion attempt, and\n“[m]any of the . . . students became ill, developed nervous\nconditions, required medical treatment, [and] were afraid\nwhile attending [the school].” Sch. Dist. of Pittsburgh v.\nZebra, 287 A.2d 870, 872 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 1972), order\nreversed by Zebra, 296 A.2d 748. Thus, a Pennsylvania\nparent appears not to be free to withdraw a child absent the\nmost egregious conditions.               Indeed, “[m]ost parents,\nrealistically, have . . . little ability to influence what occurs in\nthe school.” Morse v. Frederick, 551 U.S. 393, 424 (2007)\n(Alito, J., concurring).\n\n\n\n\n                                 9\n\f        The State‟s authority over children while they are in\nschool extends beyond their well-being and is nearly absolute,\ncovering what they may wear and how they may behave. See\ngenerally 24 Pa. Stat. Ann. § 13-1317.3; 22 Pa. Code § 12.2\n(detailing student responsibility to engage in “conscientious\neffort in classroom work and homework”). Officials may\n“proceed against said child before the juvenile court” for\nmisbehavior. 24 Pa. Stat. Ann. § 13-1338. At thirteen, the\nchild is also subject to penalties for failure to comply with\ncompulsory school laws. Id. § 13-1333(b).5\n\n        The Blackhawk Student Handbook reflects these\nrestrictions on students‟ liberty and on their parent‟s ability to\nact on the child‟s behalf, and goes further by regulating\nstudent conduct in classrooms, school buses, cafeterias, and\nsporting activities; providing that students missing class will\nbe required to attend the School for detention on Saturdays\nand that officials “may consider corporal punishment” upon a\nstudent; and prohibiting students from having cell phones.\nSee Blackhawk High School Student Handbook “Statement of\nStudent             Behavior,”            available             at\nhttp://blackhawk.bhs.schoolfusion.us/modules/cms/pages.pht\n\n\n5\n   That these measures are “inherent in the nature of the\nrelationship of public schools and their pupils,” Majority Op.\nat 16, is of no moment. See also id. at 15. Restrictions on\nliberty are also “inherent” in the relationship between the\nState and the imprisoned or involuntarily committed, but the\nsignificance of such restrictions is not diminished by the fact\nthat the State has a vested and even necessary power to\nimpose them.\n\n\n\n\n                               10\n\fml?pageid=41593 (hereinafter “Handbook”); see also 24 Pa.\nStat. Ann. § 13-1317.6\n\n       In DeShaney, the State simply left Joshua where it\nfound him; he was not harmed while in the State‟s physical\ncustody or by anyone or anything over which the State had\nany immediate authority. Here, by contrast, the State\naffirmatively removed the children from their parents‟\ncustody for a period of time, limited what both the children\nand the parents could do respecting the children‟s safety\nduring that period, and exercised control over a continuous\nthreat the children faced over an extended period of time.\nThis is enough to hold that a special relationship existed\nbetween the School and the Morrows. But if more were\nneeded, one may look at cases involving the special\nrelationship between the State and children it places in foster\ncare.\n\n\n6\n   Given the prohibition against students carrying means of\ncommunicating with their parents during school hours, which\nin 1992 represented a ban on pagers, it is obviously difficult,\nif not practically impossible, for a student to seek help from a\nparent during school hours. Middle Bucks largely overlooked\nthis. 972 F.3d at 1372 (noting that “channels for outside\ncommunication were not totally closed” during school hours).\nContrary to the majority‟s suggestion, we do not question the\nwisdom of school policies aimed at student safety or\ndiscipline, see Majority Op. at 17 n.14, and we doubt schools\nwill change any policies to avoid liability under the narrow\ncircumstances described here. But we look to those policies\nto better understand the nature of the relationship between\nstudents and the State.\n\n\n\n\n                              11\n\f       Since Middle Bucks, several Courts of Appeals have\nanswered the question left open by the Supreme Court in\nDeShaney regarding the existence of a special relationship\nbetween the State and the children it places in foster homes.\nSee 489 U.S. at 201 n.9. These courts have held that a special\nrelationship exists in such cases because the State, in placing\na child in foster care, “renders the individual substantially\ndependent upon the state . . . to meet [his or her] basic needs.”\nNicini v. Morra, 212 F.3d 798, 808 (3d Cir. 2000) (en banc)\n(quotation marks and citation omitted); see also Lintz v.\nSkipski, 25 F.3d 304, 305 (6th Cir. 1994); Norfleet v. Ark.\nDep’t of Human Servs., 989 F.2d 289, 293 (8th Cir. 1993);\nYvonne L. v. N.M. Dep’t of Human Servs., 959 F.2d 883, 893\n(10th Cir. 1992).\n\n       Our own case, Nicini, involved a child who was not in\nthe State‟s absolute care but was placed in a foster home. The\nchild‟s parents had signed a foster care placement agreement\nwith the State, and the State permitted the child to stay on a\ntemporary basis with another family, the Morras, after the\nchild ran away from home. The child sued the State on the\ntheory that it had failed to sufficiently investigate the Morras,\nwhom he alleged sexually abused him. Although we\n“recognize[d] that the analogy between foster children . . .\nand prisoners and institutionalized persons” from Estelle and\nYoungblood was “incomplete,” and that foster children “enjoy\na greater degree of freedom and are more likely to be able to\ntake steps to ensure their own safety,” we held that a special\nrelationship existed because the child was effectively in State\n\n\n\n\n                               12\n\fcustody and was “substantially dependent” on the State for\nhis safety. 212 F.3d at 808 (quotation marks omitted).7\n\n       Nicini thus “discredit[s]” not just the “underlying\nreasoning” of Middle Bucks, but also its reading of DeShaney.\nCitizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 921 (Roberts, C.J., concurring)\n(explaining that “stare decisis does not control” when the\n“underlying reasoning” of precedent in question has been\n“discredited”). Nicini makes clear that physical custody\ncannot be the lynchpin of a DeShaney special relationship\nbecause the child there was not under the State‟s control at\nthe time the harm occurred. Moreover, the State in Nicini\nwas not the primary caregiver. As the D.C. Circuit has\nrecognized, the result and reasoning in the foster care cases\nhave thus created “tension [with the] public school cases”\n\n7\n  Middle Bucks places some emphasis on the fact that schools\ndo not restrict a child‟s ability to provide for his basic needs,\nsee Middle Bucks, 972 F.2d at 1372, but this is not the proper\nrubric of analysis under DeShaney. The State did not restrict\nthe individual‟s ability to provide for his basic needs in\nYoungblood or in the foster care cases. The individual‟s\nability to do so was restricted by circumstances over which\nthe State had no control and in which it played no part. At\nmost, the State undertook some responsibility when it stepped\ninto the lives of such individuals. So too in the school\ncontext. Minors are unable to provide for their basic needs\nwithout their parents on account of age. By compelling\nattendance in school, the State does not alter that reality, but\ndoes temporarily curtail a parent‟s ability to be a caregiver,\nthereby undertaking that responsibility—albeit a more limited\none—in the same way it does in Youngblood and Nicini.\n\n\n\n\n                               13\n\fbecause “[b]oth involve state constriction of a child‟s liberty\n. . . yet only the former triggers DeShaney custody.” Smith v.\nDistrict of Columbia, 413 F.3d 86, 96 (D.C. Cir. 2005). And\nSmith itself demonstrates that the fact that children return to\ntheir parents at the end of the school day is not dispositive.\nThere, the Court held that a State has a special relationship\nwith juvenile delinquents the State places in an “independent\nliving” youth program, but over which it exerts neither\nabsolute physical control nor supervision. See id. at 94.8\n\n        Moreover, not only do these cases provide reason to\nrevisit the legal underpinning of Middle Bucks, they provide\nfurther support for holding that a special relationship exists in\nthis case. Here, unlike in Nicini or DeShaney, the State had\ncustody of the children at the time of the injury in question,\nand the children were “substantially dependent” on the State\nfor their safety during school hours, despite the existence of\nother caregivers. Nicini, 212 F.3d at 808 (quotation marks\nomitted). Like the children in Smith, the Morrows were\ntechnically free to “come and go” from school after certain\nhours but “risk[ed] punishment” for “fail[ing] to obey [the\nState‟s] restrictions on [their] . . . freedom” while in school.\n\n8\n  Indeed, even though a student returns home after the school\nday, the State may continue to exercise some control over\nsome of the student‟s activities. See J.S. ex rel. Snyder v.\nBlue Mountain Sch. Dist., 650 F.3d 915 (3d Cir. 2011)\n(addressing propriety of school action under the First\nAmendment). If students have a cause of action under § 1983\nagainst school administrators who attempt to discipline them\nfor out-of-school internet postings as we held in J.S., then\nsurely students also have a cause of action against school\nadministrators who fail to protect them from in-school harms.\n\n\n\n\n                               14\n\fSmith, 413 F.3d at 94. If anything, the existence of a special\nrelationship is clearer here than in Nicini because the State in\nthis case had physical custody over both the victim and the\naggressor and was thus uniquely positioned to protect the\nchild from harm. Neither factor existed in Nicini or in\nDeShaney. Fairly read, the additional element of control that\nexisted in the relationship between the State and Nicini that\ndid not exist in DeShaney is that in Nicini the State entered\ninto a temporary agreement with Nicini‟s parents pursuant to\nwhich the parents consented to have their son placed in foster\ncare. More is present here. Compulsory schooling laws,\ntogether with the restrictions on parents‟ and their children‟s\nability to free themselves from State control, arguably impose\non the State a greater obligation here than that which it\nundertook in Nicini.\n\n        The majority seizes on the temporary nature of the\nstudent/State relationship and also attempts to distinguish\nNicini and Smith on the ground that parents remain the\nprimary caregivers over school children. But this fact does\nnot negate that during school hours the State has the\n“immediate [] responsibility for the child‟s wellbeing.”\nNicini, 212 F.3d at 808. In our view, this fact demonstrates,\nat most, that the difference between the State‟s relationship\nwith the Nicini children and schoolchildren is a difference in\ndegree, not kind, and suggests that the proper course is to\nimpose a constitutional duty on schools only under limited\ncircumstances. See Middle Bucks, 972 F.2d at 1384 (Becker,\nJ., dissenting). In Middle Bucks, Judge Becker found the\nexistence of a special relationship based on the state‟s\ncompulsory attendance laws, the student‟s disability, and the\n“affirmative steps [the school took] to confine the student to\nsituations where she was physically threatened.” Id. Under\n\n\n\n\n                              15\n\fthe circumstances before us—Pennsylvania‟s compulsory\nschooling laws, the existence of the restraining orders that\nprohibited contact between the bully and the Morrows, the\nfact that the School had custody and control over the very\nthreat that harmed the Morrows, and the enforcement of the\n“No-Tolerance” Policy, all suggesting that the Morrows‟\nability to protect themselves was limited—we “have no\ndifficulty deciding” that a special relationship arose between\nthe School and the Morrows. Id.\n\n        Restrictions on a person‟s liberty to protect him- or\nherself from danger are the lynchpin of DeShaney. See 489\nU.S. at 199-201. An approach that abandons Middle Bucks‟\ndoctrinally unsound requirements and focuses on whether a\nState substantially restricted a student‟s ability to defend\nherself from a particular danger, in addition to the general\nrestraints on liberty imposed by compulsory schooling laws,\nis therefore more in line with DeShaney and simply makes\nmore sense. Adopting such an approach and considering the\nspecific circumstances of this case, we would hold that the\nComplaint has adequately pled the existence of a special\nrelationship between the Morrows and the School vis-à-vis\nthe bully, and remand the case for discovery on that claim.9\n\n9\n  I would also note that, in the school context, children are\nplaced under State control for the undeniably important goal\nof “prepar[ing them] for citizenship in the Republic.” Bethel\nSch. Dist. No. 403 v. Fraser, 478 U.S. 675, 681 (1986)\n(citation omitted). This restraint on the liberty of students is\njustified by the State‟s own overarching interest in education.\n\n       In addition, if it is unconstitutional to confine in unsafe\nconditions the mentally infirm, then surely it must be\n\n\n\n\n                               16\n\f                              C.\n\n        Today‟s majority does not quarrel with the foregoing\nor fully reject the dissenters‟ reasoning in Middle Bucks.\nMajority Op. at 11-12 (instead calling the Middle Bucks\ndissent “compelling”). Nevertheless, the Court refuses to\nrevisit Middle Bucks, asserting that the matter has been settled\nby dictum in a decision of the Supreme Court. But neither\nthat comment nor principles of stare decisis preclude us from\nrevisiting Middle Bucks or control the outcome of this case.\n\n                               1.\n\n        In Vernonia School District 47J v. Acton, the Supreme\nCourt upheld under the Fourth Amendment a school policy\nrequiring athletes to submit to drug tests. The Court relied on\nthe lowered expectations of privacy that students have in\nschools, because they are “committed to the temporary\ncustody of the State.” 515 U.S. 646, 654 (1995). The Court\ncommented that it did not mean to “suggest that public\nschools as a general matter have such a degree of control over\nchildren as to give rise to a constitutional „duty to protect.‟”\nId. at 655 (citing DeShaney, 489 U.S. at 200). Seizing on this\nlanguage, the majority concludes that “it is difficult to\n\n\nunconstitutional to refuse to protect from harm school\nchildren whose liberty the State restricts on its own accord.\nSee DeShaney, 489 U.S. at 199 (“If it is cruel and unusual\npunishment to hold convicted criminals in unsafe conditions,\nit must be unconstitutional . . . to confine the involuntarily\ncommitted—who may not be punished at all—in unsafe\nconditions.” (citation omitted)).\n\n\n\n\n                              17\n\fimagine a clearer or more forceful indicator of the Court‟s\ninterpretation of its holding in DeShaney.” Majority Op. at\n13.\n\n       But the Vernonia dictum cannot bear the great weight\nthe majority places on it.10 Simply put, this case is not a\n“general matter.” Vernonia, 515 U.S. at 655. The School\nadministrators here had custody of a bully, who was\nprohibited from contact with Brittany Morrow by two court\n\n10\n    That is particularly true because much of the dicta in\nVeronia that both precedes and follows the language quoted\nby the majority points in the opposite direction. In framing\nthe degree of control that public school officials exercise over\ntheir students, the Court began with the premise that\n“unemancipated minors lack some of the most fundamental\nrights of self-determination—including even the right of\nliberty in its narrow sense, i.e., the right to come and go at\nwill.” 515 U.S. at 654. The Court also noted that it had\n“rejected the notion that public schools . . . exercise only\nparental power over their students,” a “view of things” that it\nsaid is “not entirely consonant with compulsory education\nlaws.” Id. at 655 (internal quotation marks omitted). And the\nCourt “emphasized[] that the nature of that power is custodial\nand tutelary, permitting a degree of supervision and control\nthat could not be exercised over free adults,” id., following\nits passing reference to DeShaney with a recitation of the\nvarious ways in which “school authorities ac[t] in loco\nparentis” and a statement that the nature of constitutional\nfreedoms enjoyed by students “is what is appropriate for\nchildren in school.” Id. at 655-56 (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n\n\n\n\n                              18\n\forders. Despite the State‟s knowledge of a very specific,\ncontinuing, and serious threat against a particular student, the\nSchool failed to prevent subsequent attacks and instead took\naction against the victims themselves pursuant to the “No\nTolerance Policy.” When faced with a specific request for\nhelp, the School told the Morrows that it could not offer\nassistance, and even suggested it would be best if they, not\nthe bully, left and attended another school.\n\n       To be sure, we do not “lightly ignore” Supreme Court\ndicta, Majority Op. at 13, and the Vernonia dictum\nundoubtedly “invites some caution,” Hasenfus v. LaJeunesse,\n175 F.3d 68, 71 (1st Cir. 1999). But we also ought not to\nstretch dicta beyond the specific question it controls, so as to\ncurtail constitutional rights. While the Vernonia dictum\nprecludes us from holding that school districts have as “a\ngeneral matter” a duty to protect students, it does not\nforeclose finding a special relationship under specific\ncircumstances.11\n\n                               2.\n\n       Nor do we lightly suggest that our precedent be\noverturned. But even assuming that the same stare decisis\nconcerns that cabin the Supreme Court‟s discretion to revisit\nits own precedent apply with equal force to the Courts of\n\n11\n  Notably, one of the decisions by our sister Circuits cited by\nthe majority specifically refuses to read the dictum in\nVernonia to preclude finding a special relationship in the\nschool context under all circumstances. See Hasenfus, 175\nF.3d at 71-72.\n\n\n\n\n                              19\n\fAppeals, those principles do not stand in the way of revisiting\nMiddle Bucks.\n\n        We should revisit Middle Bucks because its underlying\npremise, that the special relationship test turns on the\nexistence of permanent physical custody, was clearly\nerroneous and set our jurisprudence astray from the contours\nof the special relationship test. See supra Part I.A. The fact\nthat the majority does not defend the outcome of Middle\nBucks as standing on its own suggests that the decision\nremains sufficiently controversial as to counsel “a greater\nwillingness to consider new approaches capable of restoring\nour doctrine to sounder footing.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct.\nat 922 (Roberts, C.J., concurring). Even the Supreme Court,\nwhen it “has confronted a wrongly decided, unworkable\nprecedent calling for some future action . . . [,] ha[s] chosen .\n. . to overrule the precedent.” Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U.S.\n808, 842-43 (1991) (Souter, J., concurring).12\n\n12\n   Moreover, Middle Bucks has been subject to criticism. See,\ne.g., Deborah Austern Colson, Note, Safe Enough to Learn:\nPlacing an Affirmative Duty of Protection on Public Schools\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983, 30 HARV. C.R.-C.L. L. REV. 169,\n183, 196 (1995) (denouncing “mechanical” analysis of the\nrelationship between students and school officials, and\nsuggesting that we should “make case-by-case, fact-intensive\ninquiries into state action”); Robert C. Slim, Comment, The\nSpecial Relationship Doctrine and a School Official’s Duty to\nProtect Students from Harm, 46 BAYLOR L. REV. 215 (1994);\nCase Comment, Third Circuit Finds No Affirmative Duty of\nCare by School Officials to Their Students: D.R. v. Middle\nBucks Area Vocational Technical School, 106 HARV. L. REV.\n1224 (1993).\n\n\n\n\n                               20\n\f        In addition, although the record before us on this\nquestion is bare, one might also argue that at least some\nfactual developments since Middle Bucks have further\nundercut its rationale and provide additional reasons to\nreexamine it. The proper question is whether Middle Bucks‟\nassumptions about the level of control that schools exert over\nstudents have been challenged. There are now abundant\nexamples of schools exercising greater control over students,\nranging from technology tracking student movements at all\ntimes to ensure they are in class, see Maurice Chammah and\nNick Swartsell, Student IDs That Track the Students, N.Y.\nTIMES, OCT. 6, 2012, http://nyti.ms/ThvbFq, to monitoring\nonline social media activity within and outside school\npremises, see, e.g., J.S.., 650 F.3d at 915, and, in the wake of\nrecent tragic school shootings, locking classrooms in further\nrestriction of student movement. See, e.g., Stephen Ceasar\nand Howard Blume, To lock classroom doors or not?, LOS\nANGELES TIMES, Jan. 13, 2013, http://soc.li/2N96T3f (noting\nincrease in locked classrooms in the wake of the Newtown,\nConnecticut shootings, and how such measures have resulted\nin other problems such as an instance of a teacher sexually\nassaulting students).13 Stare decisis does not require us to\n\n13\n    We do not contend that the limitations on students‟\nfreedoms are comparable to those imposed on prisoners or the\ninvoluntarily committed. See Majority Op. at 14-15. The\nexamples do show, however, that the relationship between\nschool children and the State is far more intrusive than the\nrelationship between Joshua DeShaney and the social services\ndepartment, and that in some ways the relationship restricts\nthe freedom of students, as a factual matter, more so than the\nrelationship between the State and the children in Nicini and\nSmith.\n\n\n\n\n                              21\n\fdefinitively settle the questions raised by these new\ncircumstances, nor does it preclude us from revisiting Middle\nBucks while sitting en banc.\n\nII.   Blackhawk May Have Also Created the Danger\n      That Harmed The Morrows\n\n       The Morrows also argue that the School may be liable\nunder the “state-created danger” theory.14 The majority\nconcludes that this cause of action must also be dismissed\nbecause the Morrows have failed to plead an “affirmative act”\nby the School. Majority Op. at 26-27. Although we have\nacknowledged that “the line between action and inaction may\nnot always be clear” in the context of these kinds of claims,\nBright v. Westmoreland Cnty., 443 F.3d 276, 282 (3d Cir.\n2006), the consequence of that line becomes sadly clearer\nwith the Court‟s decision in this case: administrators who let\nviolence run rampant can take shelter under the label\n“inaction.” Dereliction of duty becomes a school‟s best\ndefense.     This outcome is contrary to an appropriate\nunderstanding of the state-created danger doctrine. Indeed,\nalthough the doctrine represents a narrow exception to\nDeShaney, the majority narrows the exception to the\nvanishing point by saying that school officials are free to\nignore court orders and their own disciplinary code, enabling\na pattern of physical abuse to persist.\n\n\n14\n   We and other Circuits derived this theory from the\nSupreme Court‟s statement in DeShaney that “[w]hile the\nState may have been aware of the dangers that [plaintiff]\nfaced in the free world, it played no part in their creation.”\n489 U.S. at 201.\n\n\n\n\n                             22\n\f     To prove a state-created danger, a plaintiff must\ndemonstrate that:\n\n       (1) the harm ultimately caused was foreseeable\n       and fairly direct; (2) a state actor acted with a\n       degree of culpability that shocks the conscience;\n       (3) a relationship between the state and the\n       plaintiff existed such that the plaintiff was a\n       foreseeable victim of the defendant‟s acts, or a\n       member of a discrete class of persons subjected\n       to the potential harm brought about by the\n       state‟s actions, as opposed to a member of the\n       public in general; and (4) a state actor\n       affirmatively used his or her authority in a way\n       that created a danger to the citizen or that\n       rendered the citizen more vulnerable to danger\n       than had the state not acted at all.\n\nId. at 281 (quotation marks and citations omitted). The first\nand third elements are not in dispute in this case.15 We\ntherefore discuss the second and fourth elements to\n\n\n\n15\n  The first prong is satisfied by the two court orders directing\nthe bully to have no contact with the Morrows, which were\ndelivered to the School, because the threat posed by the bully\nwas both “foreseeable” by the School and “fairly direct” as to\nthe Morrows. The third prong is satisfied because the\nassignment of the Morrows to Blackhawk under the\ncompulsory school attendance law made them part of a\n“discrete class of person subject to the potential harm”\nbrought about by the School‟s conduct.\n\n\n\n\n                              23\n\fdemonstrate that the Morrows‟ complaint adequately pleads\nthis cause of action.16\n\n                              A.\n\n       The second prong of the state-created danger test sets\n“deliberate indifference” as “[t]he level of culpability\nrequired to shock the conscience . . . in cases where\ndeliberation is possible and officials have time to make\nunhurried judgments.” Sanford v. Stiles, 456 F.3d 298, 309\n(3d Cir. 2006) (quotation marks omitted). The “deliberate\nindifference” formulation applies here because the decision\nwith respect to the bully and the Morrows was neither “split-\nsecond” nor made in a “matter of hours or minutes,” id. at\n310 (citation omitted), but rather was made and sustained\nover eight months stretching from January to October 2008.\n\n       In addition, the Complaint here supports an inference\nof deliberate indifference on the part of the School principal,\nBalaski. Balaski knew that the bully was not permitted to\ncontact the Morrows. Moreover, the Handbook mandates\nsome action by officials in response to students who commit\n“Level IV” offenses, which include assault and battery, and\n\n16\n    Because, as noted, this case comes to us from a ruling on a\nmotion to dismiss, we must draw all reasonable inferences in\nthe Morrows‟ favor. Monroe, 536 F.3d at 205. If, based on\nthe facts pled in the Morrows‟ Complaint, “we cannot\nreasonably conclude at this juncture of the case that the harm\n. . . came about by means apart from the state,” Middle Bucks,\n972 F.2d at 1382 (Sloviter, C. J., dissenting), the Morrows\nshould have the opportunity for discovery to determine the\nprecise nature of the School‟s conduct.\n\n\n\n\n                              24\n\farguably calls for their expulsion. However, Balaski ignored\nthe import of the no-contact orders and decided not to abide\nby the school‟s own Disciplinary Code. His decisions are\nalleged to have put the bully in proximity to and contact with\nthe Morrows, despite ample reason to believe the bully would\ncontinue to assault the Morrows. Consequently, they have\nadequately pled deliberate indifference and satisfied the\nsecond prong of the state-created danger theory.\n\n                               B.\n\n        Under the fourth prong of the theory, “liability . . . is\npredicated upon the states‟ affirmative acts which work to the\nplaintiffs‟ detriment in terms of exposure to danger.”17\n\n17\n   It is worth noting that DeShaney does not actually compel\nthe inclusion of the “affirmative act” requirement into the\nfourth element of the state-created danger test. When we first\nconsidered the state-created danger theory, we said that\nDeShaney holds “that a state‟s failure to take affirmative\naction to protect a victim from the actions of a third person\nwill not, in the absence of a custodial relationship between the\nstate and the victim, support a civil rights claim.” Brown v.\nGrabowski, 922 F.2d 1097, 1100-01 (3d Cir. 1990).\nHowever, DeShaney used the phrase “affirmative act” only to\nrefer to state conduct sufficient to create a special\nrelationship. See, e.g., DeShaney, 489 U.S. at 200. By\ncontrast, in contemplating the possibility of a state-created\ndanger, the Court simply suggested that the State must have\n“played [some] part” in the creation of that danger. Id. at\n201. Much like the requirement that the State have absolute\nphysical custody in the context of the special relationship test,\nthe “affirmative act” element is our own addition, and one\n\n\n\n\n                               25\n\fBright, 443 F.3d at 282 (quoting Middle Bucks, 972 F.2d at\n1374). But it is not easy to discern from our cases what\nconstitutes an affirmative act and what does not.\n\n        In Kneipp v. Tedder, we held that there was a\nsubstantive due process violation when police stopped an\nintoxicated couple on the street and then permitted the wife to\ngo home alone, resulting in her fall down an embankment and\nultimate death. 95 F.3d 1199, 1211 (3d Cir. 1996). Then, in\nRivas v. City of Passaic, we held liable emergency medical\ntechnicians (“EMTs”) who told police officers that a man in\nthe midst of a seizure had assaulted them but did not inform\nthe officers of the man‟s medical condition. 365 F.3d 181,\n195 (3d Cir. 2004). We said that the state had created a\ndanger in Kneipp because the defendants “used their authority\nas police officers to create a dangerous situation or to make\n[the victim] more vulnerable to danger [than] had they not\nintervened.” 95 F.2d at 1209. In Rivas, we aggregated an\nearlier action (the EMTs‟ call that brought the police) with\nthe inaction that was the actual cause of harm (the failure to\ninform the police of the victim‟s condition) and decided it\nwas sufficient because such sequence “created an opportunity\nfor harm that would not have otherwise existed.” 365 F.3d at\n197.\n\n       As these cases demonstrate, virtually any action may\nbe characterized as a failure to take some alternative action or\nvice-versa. See, e.g., Covington Cnty., 675 F.3d at 864, 866\n(describing the police officers in Kneipp as having “sent” the\nvictim home alone, but recasting parents‟ allegation that a\n\n\nthat is not necessarily helpful to safeguarding constitutional\nrights.\n\n\n\n\n                              26\n\fschool released their child to an unauthorized person in\nviolation of school policy as a “failure to adopt a stricter\npolicy”).18\n\n       Moreover, any conduct pled as the source of a state-\ncreated danger is likely to include a combination of action\nand inaction, depending on how far back in the causal chain a\ncourt goes. See Bright, 443 F.3d at 291 (Nygaard, J.,\n\n18\n   We also struggled with the “action/inaction” determination\nin Middle Bucks when we distinguished two cases in which\nthe state indisputably created a danger by a failure to act. The\nfirst case was Horton, where a club owner empowered by the\npolice to act as law enforcement beat up one of his employees\nwhile interrogating him about an alleged theft. The club\nowner then called a police officer who failed to remove the\nemployee from the club owner‟s custody, despite evidence of\nsevere physical mistreatment. We held that the police officer\nwas potentially liable. See Horton, 889 F.2d at 458. In the\nother case, a minor was committed to a foster home based on\na charge of assault and battery upon her father. The state later\nlearned, but failed to disclose, the fact that the parents had\nfabricated the assault charge. The First Circuit held that the\nstate was liable because its failure to disclose the false charge\nresulted in continued custody of the daughter in foster homes\nand other placements. See Germany v. Vance, 868 F.2d 9 (1st\nCir. 1989). We distinguished those cases from Middle Bucks,\nin which we held that a failure to act did not support a state-\ncreated danger claim, because we “read both cases to turn\nupon a finding of „functional‟ custody,” 972 F.2d at 1375,\nthat we believed did not exist in Middle Bucks, but we\nprovided no justification for that distinction.\n\n\n\n\n                               27\n\fdissenting) (“By cabining Bright‟s claim based solely on an\nensuing delay in taking action, the majority lops off the initial\naffirmative act so it can conclude that there was no\naffirmative act.”).    Indeed, in Kneipp and Rivas, the\nimmediate harm to the victims was due to the defendant‟s\nfailure to act. Therefore, the better way of understanding\nthese cases, contrary to the majority‟s embrace of the\n“affirmative act” requirement today, is to recognize that “the\ndispositive factor appears to be whether the state has in some\nway placed the plaintiff in a dangerous position that was\nforeseeable, and not whether the act was more appropriately\ncharacterized as an affirmative act.” Morse v. Lower Merion\nSch. Dist., 132 F.3d 902, 915 (3d Cir. 1997).19\n\n19\n   Given that, as noted, the “affirmative act” requirement is\nnot actually present in DeShaney, it is not surprising that we\nhave not always required an “affirmative act” as part of the\nfourth prong of the state-created danger test. As Judge\nNygaard noted in Bright, “[s]ince Kneipp . . . enunciated our\nstate-created danger test, not one of our cases [had] inserted\nthe word „affirmatively‟ into the fourth element of the test”\nprior to Bright. 443 F.3d at 288 (Nygaard, J., dissenting).\nRather, we consider whether “the state actor used his\nauthority to create an opportunity for danger that otherwise\nwould not have existed.” Kneipp, 95 F.3d at 1208; see\ngenerally Bright, 443 F.3d at 288 (Nygaard, J., dissenting)\n(collecting cases). Judge Nygaard rightly observed in Bright\nthat these cases “shifted away from inquiring into the\nexistence of affirmative acts as a standard to establish the\nfourth element of our test for a compelling reason: to so hinge\nour inquiry would center us squarely in the troublesome\ndecisional thicket governing the distinction between action\nand inaction.” Bright, 443 F.3d at 289.\n\n\n\n\n                               28\n\f        The majority in Bright suggested that there is “no\nconflict” between the “use of authority” and “affirmative act”\nformulations of the fourth prong of the state-created danger\ntest because “state actors cannot use their authority to create .\n. . an opportunity [for injury to the plaintiff] by failing to act.”\n443 F.3d at 283 n.6 (quotation marks omitted). But that\nstatement is wrong both linguistically and logically. It is\nwrong linguistically because authority is a broader concept\nthan action. See Ye v. United States, 484 F.3d 634, 639-40\n(3d Cir. 2007) (treating “affirmative action” as a specific\ninstance of the “exercise of authority”). And it is wrong\nlogically because state authority necessarily brings with it\ndiscretion whether to take specific actions, and the decision to\ntake one action over another—or to take no action at all—is\nitself an “affirmative exercise of authority” that may carry\nserious consequences. In many, if not most, state-created\ndanger cases, the state actor will have made a decision to act\nin the context of some set of policies. For example, police\ndepartments have procedures with respect to the enforcement\nof restraining orders, and their enforcement decisions must be\nviewed in the context of those policies. See, e.g., Sheets v.\nMullins, 287 F.3d 581, 589 (6th Cir. 2002) (considering\nsheriff‟s liability in the context of court-mandated process for\nrestraint orders); Freeman v. Ferguson, 911 F.2d 52, 55 (8th\nCir. 1990) (considering whether police chief interfered with\nstandard police procedures with respect to enforcement of\nrestraint order).\n\n       The exercise of authority by school officials must\nsimilarly be viewed in the context of policies and procedures\nwhose express purpose is to protect students while they are\nunder school control. If a school exercises its authority to\ncontravene a policy designed to protect students, then “the\n\n\n\n\n                                29\n\fschool officials‟ role [is] not merely passive or simply\nnegligent.” Covington Cnty., 675 F.3d at 882 (Wiener, J.,\ndissenting). It cannot rightly be said of a school‟s decision to\nexercise its authority to violate or suspend a policy that would\nprotect a student that “it placed [that student] in no worse\nposition than that in which he would have been had [the state]\nnot acted at all.”20 DeShaney, 489 U.S. at 201. As we said in\nMiddle Bucks, “[i]f the state puts a man in a position of\ndanger from private persons and then fails to protect him, it\nwill not be heard to say that its role was merely passive; it is\nas much an active tortfeasor as if it had thrown him into a\nsnake pit.” 972 F.2d at 1374 (citation omitted). The\nmajority‟s argument that our view of the state-created danger\nexception threatens to “swallow the rule,” Majority Op. at 26,\nignores the key role played by school disciplinary policies, as\nwell as other policies that cabin officials‟ discretion, in our\nformulation of the state-created danger exception.\n\n20\n   One might argue that holding public schools liable under\nthe state-created danger theory based on their own protective\npolicies creates an incentive to eliminate or weaken those\npolicies. However, those policies are typically mandated by\nthe State. For example, Pennsylvania requires that each\nschool “adopt a code of student conduct that includes policies\ngoverning student discipline.” 22 Pa. Code § 12.3(c). Also,\nunder its “Safe Schools” statute, Pennsylvania requires each\nschool to have a policy relating to bullying that must be\nincorporated into its code of student conduct and disciplinary\ncode. 24 Pa. Stat. Ann. § 13-1303.1-A(a). Moreover, we\ndoubt that any rational school district will opt for eliminating\npolicies designed to protect children, and permit teachers to\nabandon children to danger, simply to avoid liability in\negregious cases such as this.\n\n\n\n\n                              30\n\f       Ultimately, the misguided effort to equate “affirmative\nact” and “exercise of authority” begs the real question at\nissue: whether a state actor increased the risk someone faced.\nRegardless of whether a state-created danger requires either\nan “affirmative act” to place an individual in danger or an\n“exercise of authority” that renders him more vulnerable to\ndanger, the facts pled in the Complaint, accepted as true,\ntogether with the reasonable inferences we are required to\ndraw, satisfy either standard.\n\n       While the majority reasons there was no affirmative\nact on the part of the School, it may be inferred from the\nComplaint that the School did do something. Principal\nBalaksi engaged in decision-making as to the implementation\nof a provision of the Disciplinary Code. The Disciplinary\nCode states that Level IV offenses “are clearly criminal in\nnature and are so serious that they always require\nadministrative action resulting in the immediate removal from\nschool.” Compl. ¶ 16 (emphasis added). Therefore, it may be\nreasonably inferred that the School affirmatively exercised its\ndiscretion to permit the bully to return to school after she was\nadjudicated a delinquent and made the subject of the two no-\ncontact orders. Moreover, the School conceded at oral\nargument that the principal could have initiated the hearing\nprocess that would have been necessary prior to permanently\nexpelling the bully from the School, but that he did not do so.\nConsequently, it is fairly inferable from the Complaint that\nthere were internal discussions that preceded the decision to\ndecline enforcement of the Disciplinary Code against the\nbully. Those discussions, and that decision, put the Morrows\n\n\n\n\n                              31\n\fat a heightened risk of harm and satisfy the fourth element of\nthe state-created danger test.21\n\n        The majority‟s conclusion to the contrary turns on its\nassumption that the bully would have continued to attend\nschool had she not been suspended. See Majority Op. at 26-\n27. But this is plainly incorrect in light of the Disciplinary\nCode that obligated School officials to do something about\nthe bully‟s continued criminal behavior after her return from\nschool. Without explanation, the majority “decline[s] to hold\nthat a school‟s alleged failure to enforce a disciplinary code is\nequivalent to an affirmative act.” Id. at 27. Precisely\nbecause, in choosing to ignore that mandate, the School\nofficials contributed to the danger the Morrows faced, we\nwould reach the opposite conclusion.\n\n                               C.\n\n       Like Kneipp, this case presents “unique facts,” 95 F.3d\nat 1208, that distinguish it from Middle Bucks and set it apart\nfrom the majority of state-created danger cases that we have\n\n21\n   One might also reasonably infer that the School officials\naffirmatively acted in a way that increased the danger to the\nMorrows by putting them and the bully in the same lunch\nroom or allowing the bully to board the Morrows‟ school bus\ndespite the fact that it did not serve her home route. See, e.g.,\nCompl. ¶ 18. The School argues that the incident on the\nschool bus cannot constitute the basis of liability because the\nMorrows were less restrained by the School when they were\non the bus. This argument confuses the physical restraint\ncomponent of the special relationship test with the state-\ncreated danger theory.\n\n\n\n\n                               32\n\fseen. In Middle Bucks, where the question was “extremely\nclose,” 972 F.2d at 1374, we held that, “[a]s in DeShaney,\n„the most that can be said of the state functionaries . . . is that\nthey stood by and did nothing when suspicious circumstances\ndictated a more active role for them.‟” Id. at 1376 (quoting\nDeShaney, 489 U.S. at 203). But the high school principal\nhere, Balaski, was not confronted with “suspicious\ncircumstances.” He was confronted with a student who had\nbeen charged with assault and making terroristic threats and\nharassment, had been adjudicated a delinquent, had\nrepeatedly attacked the Morrows over the course of several\nmonths, and had been the subject of two no-contact orders\nthat were delivered to the School.              And Balaski‟s\ndecisionmaking did not occur in a vacuum but instead\noperated under a Disciplinary Code and an Anti-Bullying\nPolicy that the School was required to adopt by the\nPennsylvania legislature. See supra note 20. In Middle\nBucks, we said that the defendants “did not subject plaintiffs\nto an inherently dangerous environment,” 972 F.2d at 1375,\nbut, here, Balaski‟s decision not to expel the bully\nunquestionably subjected the Morrows to an inherently\ndangerous environment. This is evidenced by his own\nstatement to the Morrows‟ parents that the school “could not\nguarantee the safety” of their daughters. Compl. ¶ 20. The\nMorrows should therefore be permitted to take their state-\ncreated danger cause of action past the pleadings stage.\n\nIII.   Conclusion\n\n       It has been suggested that the “elephant in the room”\nin cases of this nature is a desire by the federal courts to avoid\nbecoming the forum for all disputes involving everyday\nschoolyard quarrels. See, e.g., Middle Bucks, 972 F.3d at\n\n\n\n\n                                33\n\f1384 (Sloviter, C.J., dissenting); Oral Arg. Audio Tr. 26:39-\n27:08 (Ambro, J.). But there exist sufficient evidentiary and\nprocedural protections to assuage any concerns that a limited\nreview of Middle Bucks will open the floodgates to all school-\nrelated litigation. See Middle Bucks, 972 F.2d at 1384\n(Sloviter, C.J., dissenting). And to plead a plausible special\nrelationship cause of action, the student must clear another\nhurdle by pointing to other circumstances beyond the\nrestraints imposed ordinarily by compulsory schooling laws.\nRun-of-the-mill schoolyard fights, isolated or random acts of\nviolence, or matters where a school played no part in\nexacerbating the threat, would likely not be covered.\n\n       But regardless of the efficacy of these devices, we\nought not refuse to grant relief that is warranted simply to\nstem future litigation. While turning away the Morrows may\nbe convenient as a matter of management of judicial\nresources or as a matter of school policy, it is neither\nexpedient nor sound as a matter of constitutional law. The\nmajority avers that students and concerned parents may seek\nredress from their legislatures, but concedes that the law as it\nexists today, at least in Pennsylvania, immunizes schools\nfrom such suits. See Majority Op. at 25 (citing Auerbach v.\nCouncil Rock Sch. Dist., 459 A.2d 1376, 1378 (Pa. Commw.\nCt. 1983)). Perhaps students may seek redress under other\nfederal statutes for certain instances of pervasive or race-\nmotivated harassment.22 But these limited remedies will not\n\n22\n  See, e.g., Zeno v. Pine Plains Cent. Sch. Dist., 702 F.3d 655\n(2d Cir. 2012) (permitting cause of action to proceed against\nschool district under Title VI for permitting plaintiff to be\nbullied on account of race); Shore Regional High Sch. Bd. of\nEduc. v. P.S., 381 F.3d 194 (3d Cir. 2004) (recognizing claim\n\n\n\n\n                              34\n\fbe available for all cases, and we should not require that the\nlevel of attacks reach frightening extremes before school\nofficials are required to intervene. “When claims like these\nfall through the cracks, § 1983 seems less than the powerful\ntool to vindicate constitutional rights it was designed to be.”\nBlack v. Indiana Area Sch. Dist., 985 F.2d 707, 715 (3d Cir.\n1993) (Scirica, J., concurring).\n\n        Most ironically, today‟s victory may be pyrrhic for\nschool officials. To the detriment of schools‟ ability to\nmanage their own affairs, concerned parents could seek\ngreater control and awareness over the moment-to-moment\nsafety of their children, knowing that the school officials to\nwhom they entrust their children are under no legal obligation\nto protect them from harm. Some parents may even take\nunilateral acts to protect their children. See, e.g., Ryan\nRaiche, Parents of boy who brought butcher knife to school\nsay it was to defend himself from bullies, ABC Action News\nWFTS-TV, Jan. 14, 2013, http://shar.es/jEG8P. At worst,\nschools may be unwittingly encouraging the law of the jungle\nto be the reigning norm. We hope this is not the case.\n\n       It cannot be denied that schools both create and\nregulate the conditions to which students are subject during\nthe school day. When a State interrupts even temporarily the\n\n\nagainst school based on the Individuals with Disabilities\nEducation Act). Notably, the existence of alternative causes\nof action further undercuts implicit reliance on a desire to\nshield school officials from suits as a reason to depart from\nsound constitutional principles. Bullying-related suits will\ncontinue as long as the issue is in the public eye regardless of\ntoday‟s decision.\n\n\n\n\n                              35\n\fprovision of care by a parent to a child, steps into the shoes of\nthat parent, and restricts the ability of the child to defend\nherself from a specific threat, the State ought to be seen as\nincurring a narrow, concomitant responsibility to act as one\nwould expect the child‟s parents to act: to protect the child\nfrom that danger. The School‟s explicit refusal to do so\nshould give us more pause than it does today. Moreover,\nwhen a school official chooses not to remove a student who\nhas committed violent acts against another student, despite\npolicies that call for such removal, that official has surely\nplaced the victim in a worse position than if the disciplinary\npolicy had run its ordinary course. And when a school\ncreates an atmosphere in which serious violence is tolerated\nand brings no consequence, it acts in a manner that renders all\nstudents more vulnerable.\n\n       We respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                               36\n\fNygaard, Circuit Judge, dissenting.\n\n       More than twenty years ago, we took up the troubling\nappeal of two female high school students who had been\nsexually assaulted by seven male students in a classroom,\nduring a graphic arts class. See D.R. v. Middle Bucks Area\nVocational Technical School, et al., 972 F.2d 1364, 1366 (3d\nCir. 1992). Despite compulsory education laws, we held that\nschools do not have an affirmative constitutional duty to\nprotect students from the actions of third parties while they\nattend school.

Thereafter, the Morrows brought suit\nalleging that school officials denied them substantive due\nprocess under the Fourteenth Amendment by not protecting\nBrittany and Emily. The Third Amended Complaint (the\n“Complaint”) asserted a cause of action under 42 U.S.C. §\n1983 and a supplemental state law claim for “negligence\nand/or gross or willful misconduct.”\n\n       The District Court dismissed the Complaint based on\nour decision in D.R. v. Middle Bucks Area Vocational\nTechnical School, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"589625\"><a href=\"/opinion/589625/dr-a-minor-child-by-her-parent-and-natural-guardian-lr-and-lr/\"><span class=\"volume\">972</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1364</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir. 1992) (en banc).\nThere, we concluded that the school did not have a “special\nrelationship” with students that would give rise to a\nconstitutional duty to protect them from harm from other\nstudents given the alleged facts. See id. at 1372 (finding that\n“no special relationship based upon a restraint of liberty exists\nhere”). The District Court also held that the injury the\nMorrows complained of was not the result of any affirmative\naction by the Defendants. Accordingly, the court held that\nthe Defendants are not liable under the “state-created danger”\ndoctrine.     The District Court therefore dismissed the\nMorrows‟ Complaint, and this appeal followed. The appeal\nwas initially argued before a panel of this Court. Thereafter,\nwe granted en banc review to reexamine the very important\nquestions raised by the allegations in the Complaint.\n\n       We now affirm the judgment of the District Court and\nhold that the allegations do not establish the special\nrelationship or the state-created danger that must exist before\na constitutional duty to protect arises under the Fourteenth\nAmendment.\n\n  I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n                   A. Factual Background\n\n\n\n\n                                3\n\f       Brittany and Emily Morrow attended Blackhawk High\nSchool in Beaver County, Pennsylvania.3 Beginning in\nJanuary 2008, they were subjected to a series of threats and\nphysical assaults by Shaquana Anderson, a fellow student.\nSpecifically, on January 5, 2008, Anderson threatened\nBrittany by phone and on a MySpace blog.4 Two days later,\nAnderson physically attacked Brittany in the school‟s lunch\nroom. Pursuant to its “No Tolerance Policy,” the school\nsuspended both girls for three days. Brittany‟s mother also\nreported Anderson to the local police at the recommendation\nof Assistant Principal Balaski. As a result, Anderson was\ncharged with simple assault, terroristic threats, and\nharassment. Nevertheless, Anderson continued to bully\nBrittany and Emily. In fact, shortly after she returned to\nschool, Anderson again attacked Brittany by attempting to\nthrow her down a set of stairs. During that incident,\nAnderson allegedly called Brittany a “cracker,” told her that\nshe was “retarded” and “had better learn to fight back,” and\nasked “why don‟t you learn to talk right?”\n\n       On April 9, 2008, Anderson was placed on probation\nby the Court of Common Pleas of Beaver County, Juvenile\nDivision, and ordered to have no contact with Brittany. Five\nmonths later, Anderson was adjudicated delinquent by a\nJuvenile Master of that court, and was again ordered to have\nno contact with Brittany. Copies of both of these “no-\ncontact” orders were provided to the school and to Assistant\nPrincipal Balaski.\n\n\n\n3\n  Since this is an appeal from the District Court‟s grant of the\nDefendants‟ Motion to Dismiss pursuant to rule 12(b)(6) of\nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, we must accept the\nfactual allegations contained in the Morrows‟ Complaint as\ntrue.

Tex. 2007).\n\n                               4\n\f       Despite the court‟s intervention, on September 12,\n2008, Anderson boarded Brittany‟s school bus, even though\nthat bus did not service Anderson‟s home route. Anderson\nthreatened Brittany, and she elbowed Brittany in the throat at\na school football game that evening. A few days later, Abbey\nHarris, Anderson‟s friend, struck Emily in the throat. These\nincidents were reported to school officials.\n\n       The Morrows subsequently met with school officials,\nbut they responded by telling the Morrows that they could not\nguarantee Brittany and Emily‟s safety. Instead, rather than\nremoving Anderson and her confederate from the school,\nschool officials advised the Morrows to consider another\nschool for their children. In October 2008, the Morrows\nenrolled their daughters in a different school.\n\n                   B. Procedural History\n\n       The Morrows thereafter filed this suit pursuant to 42\nU.S.C. § 1983, alleging a violation of their Fourteenth\nAmendment substantive due process rights.5 They also\nincluded a supplemental state law claim against Assistant\nPrincipal Balaski for “negligence and/or gross and willful\nmisconduct.” The Morrows acknowledge that the Fourteenth\nAmendment‟s Due Process Clause does not generally impose\nan affirmative duty on the state to protect individuals from\nharm caused by private citizens. However, they argue that\nthe general rule is not applicable because the Defendants had\na “special relationship” with Brittany and Emily. They also\nargue that the Defendants are liable because they created the\ndangerous situation in which Brittany and Emily found\nthemselves, and that circumstance gave rise to a duty to\nprotect the Morrow sisters from that danger.\n\n        The District Court dismissed the Morrows‟ Complaint\nwith prejudice, and declined to exercise supplemental\njurisdiction over the state law claim.6 In its written opinion,\n5\n  The Morrows seek: 1) compensatory damages as to all\nDefendants; 2) punitive damages as to defendant Balaski; and\n3) attorneys‟ fees.\n6\n  Because the District Court dismissed the Complaint with\nprejudice, it was not necessary for the court to reach the\n                              5\n\fthe District Court explained that we have held that there is no\nspecial relationship between public school authorities and\nstudents. The court also concluded that the Morrows had\n“identified no action of the Defendants that utilized their\nauthority in a way that rendered Minor Plaintiffs more\nvulnerable than they would have been otherwise.” Morrow v.\nBalaski, No. 10-cv-292, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">915863</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *5 (W.D.

DISCUSSION\n\n      To state a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, a plaintiff\nmust allege a person acting under color of state law engaged\nin conduct that violated a right protected by the Constitution\nor laws of the United States. Nicini v. Morra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768726\"><a href=\"/opinion/768726/anthony-nicini-jr-v-edward-morra-new-jersey-department-of-health-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">212</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">798</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\nissues of municipal liability and qualified immunity that the\nDefendants raised in their Motion to Dismiss.\n7\n  The District Court had subject matter jurisdiction pursuant\nto 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343. We have appellate\njurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n\n                                6\n\f806 (3d Cir. 2000) (en banc). Accordingly, “[t]he first step in\nevaluating a section 1983 claim is to „identify the exact\ncontours of the underlying right said to have been violated‟\nand to [then] determine „whether the plaintiff has alleged a\ndeprivation of a constitutional right at all.‟” Id. (quoting\nCnty. of Sacramento v. Lewis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118214\"><a href=\"/opinion/118214/countyof-sacramento-v-lewis/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">833</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 841 n. 5 (1998)).\n\n       As we noted at the outset, the Morrows‟ § 1983 claim\nrests on the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment. The Due Process Clause provides that a state\nshall not “deprive any person of life, liberty, or property,\nwithout due process of law.” U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1.\nThe Morrows invoke the substantive component of due\nprocess, which “protects individual liberty against „certain\ngovernment actions regardless of the fairness of the\nprocedures used to implement them.‟” Collins v. City of\nHarker Heights, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112699\"><a href=\"/opinion/112699/collins-v-harker-heights/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">115</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 125 (1992) (quoting Daniels v.\nWilliams, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111555\"><a href=\"/opinion/111555/daniels-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">327</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 331 (1986)). Specifically, the\nMorrows allege that school officials violated a liberty interest\nby failing to protect Emily and Brittany from the threats and\nassaults inflicted by fellow students.\n\n       Like the District Court, we are sympathetic to the\nMorrows‟ plight.      Brittany and Emily were verbally,\nphysically and—no doubt—emotionally tormented by a\nfellow student who was adjudicated delinquent based on her\nactions against the Morrow sisters. When the Morrows\nrequested that the Defendants do something to protect\nBrittany and Emily from the persistent harassment and\nbullying, school officials responded by suggesting that the\nMorrows consider moving to a different school rather than\nremoving the bully from the school.\n\n        We therefore certainly understand why the Morrows\nwould conclude that the school‟s response to the abuse\ninflicted on their daughters was unfair and unjust.\nNevertheless, our adjudication of the Morrows‟ claims must\nbe governed by Supreme Court precedent. As we shall\nexplain, it is also guided by authoritative Supreme Court\ndicta.\n\n      The Supreme Court has long established that “[a]s a\ngeneral matter, . . . a State‟s failure to protect an individual\n\n                               7\n\fagainst private violence simply does not constitute a violation\nof the Due Process Clause.” DeShaney v. Winnebago Cnty.\nDep’t of Social Servs., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112202\"><a href=\"/opinion/112202/deshaney-v-winnebago-county-dept-of-social-servs/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">189</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 197 (1989). The Due\nProcess Clause forbids the state itself from depriving\n“individuals of life, liberty, or property without „due process\nof law,‟ but its language cannot fairly be extended to impose\nan affirmative obligation on the State to ensure that those\ninterests do not come to harm through other means.” Id. at\n195.\n\n       In DeShaney, the Winnebago County Department of\nSocial Services received ongoing reports from family friends\nand medical personnel that a four-year old boy (“Joshua”)\nwas suffering physical abuse at the hands of his father. At\none point, the state obtained a court order placing Joshua in\nthe temporary custody of the local hospital, but later returned\nhim to the custody of his abusive father. Following Joshua‟s\nreturn, the county social worker assigned to the case\ncontinued to document multiple incidents of suspected abuse.\nDespite these reports, the county failed to remove Joshua\nfrom his father‟s custody. Eventually, the father beat Joshua\nso badly that the boy suffered permanent brain damage.\nJoshua and his mother sought redress by suing the county\nunder § 1983. They argued that the county had denied them\nsubstantive due process under the Fourteenth Amendment by\nnot protecting Joshua from his father. Id. at 191-93.\n\n       Despite these “undeniably tragic” facts, id. at 191, the\nSupreme Court held that the county‟s failure to provide\nJoshua with adequate protection against his father‟s violence\ndid not amount to a substantive due process violation. The\nCourt explained that the Due Process Clause limits state\ngovernments but does not generally impose an affirmative\nobligation upon states to protect individuals from private\ncitizens. Id. at 195-96. However, the Court carved out a very\nnarrow exception to that general rule wherein the Constitution\ndoes “impose[] upon the State affirmative duties of care and\nprotection with respect to particular individuals.” Id. at 198.\nThat exception has come to be known as the “special\nrelationship” exception. It applies when a special relationship\nhas been established because “the State takes a person into its\ncustody and holds him there against his will.” Id. at 199-200.\n\n\n                              8\n\f        In addition to the special relationship exception, we\nhave recognized that the Due Process Clause can impose an\naffirmative duty to protect if the state‟s own actions create the\nvery danger that causes the plaintiff‟s injury. See Kneipp v.\nTedder, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"726573\"><a href=\"/opinion/726573/samantha-kneipp-an-incompetent-person-by-ronald-a-cusack-sr-rosanne-m/\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1199</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1201 (3d Cir. 1996). In Kneipp, police\nofficers stopped Kneipp and her husband for causing a\ndisturbance on a highway while they were walking home\nfrom a bar, but they thereafter allowed Kneipp‟s husband to\ncontinue to their home to tend to their son. Kneipp‟s husband\nlater testified that because his wife was drunk, he assumed the\nofficers would take her to the hospital or to the police station.\nHowever, the officers abandoned her despite her obvious\nintoxication, thereby forcing her to walk home alone in the\ncold. She subsequently fell down an embankment and\nsuffered hypothermia resulting in permanent brain damage.\nId. at 1201-03. In the subsequent suit against the state under\n§ 1983, we held that the officers‟ conduct denied Kneipp her\nFourtheenth Amendment right to substantive due process\nbecause the actions of the police created the danger that\ncaused her injury. Id. at 1213.\n\n       Accordingly, the Morrows can state a claim under §\n1983 if they have adequately alleged circumstances giving\nrise to a “special relationship” between their daughters and\nthe Defendants pursuant to DeShaney, or if their Complaint\nadequately alleges affirmative conduct on the part of the\nDefendants to support the “state-created danger” exception\nthat we adopted in Kneipp.\n\n                   A. Special Relationship\n\n       As the Court instructed in DeShaney, an affirmative\nduty to protect may arise out of certain “special relationships”\nbetween the state and particular individuals. See DeShaney,\n489 U.S. at 197-98. The Supreme Court has found that the\nrelationship between the state and its incarcerated or\ninvoluntarily committed citizens is the kind of “special\nrelationship” that creates an affirmative duty upon the state to\nprovide adequate medical care to incarcerated prisoners, see\nEstelle v. Gamble, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109561\"><a href=\"/opinion/109561/estelle-v-gamble/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">97</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 103 (1976), and to ensure the\n“reasonable safety” of involuntarily committed mental\npatients, Youngberg v.

In other words, “it is the State‟s\naffirmative act of restraining the individual‟s freedom to act\non       his      own      behalf—through         incarceration,\ninstitutionalization, or other similar restraint of personal\nliberty—which is the „deprivation of liberty‟ triggering the\nprotections of the Due Process Clause, not its failure to act to\nprotect his liberty interests against harms inflicted by other\nmeans.” Id. (emphasis added).\n\n        A minor child attending public school most certainly\ndoes not have the freedom of action or independence of an\nadult.8 Nevertheless, the Supreme Court has not had occasion\nto specifically decide whether that is sufficient to create a\nspecial relationship between public schools and their students\nunder the Due Process Clause.

There, the Court clarified the\napplicability of DeShaney‟s special relationship exception in\nthe context of public schools. The specific issue in Vernonia\nwas whether a public school‟s policy requiring student\nathletes to submit to random drug testing violates the Fourth\nAmendment. Id. at 648. In holding that such a policy does\nnot violate the Fourth Amendment, the Court noted:\n“Central, in our view, to the present case is the fact that the\nsubjects of the Policy are (1) children, who (2) have been\ncommitted to the temporary custody of the State as\nschoolmaster.” Id. at 654.

We know of nothing that has\noccurred in the twenty years since we decided Middle Bucks\nthat would undermine this conclusion. We therefore find the\ndissent‟s assertion here that “factual developments since\nMiddle Bucks have further undercut its rationale,” Fuentes\nDissent 18, unpersuasive. The first two examples our\ndissenting colleagues offer of “schools exercising greater\ncontrol over students” include the use of technology tracking\nstudent movement to ensure they are in class11 and the\nmonitoring of social media activity by students.12 Id. Such\nexamples merely illustrate new precautionary measures some\nschools have undertaken in response to emerging technology.\nIt is difficult to see how such measures constitute limitations\non a student‟s “freedom to act on his own behalf,” see\nDeShaney, 489 U.S. at 200, that are so severely restrictive as\nto equate public school students with prisoners or those who\nare involuntarily committed to secure mental institutions.\n\n       Similarly, a school‟s exercise of authority to lock\nclassrooms in the wake of tragedies such as those that have\n\n10\n   The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has not\nsquarely decided this issue.

However, the fact that\ncertain schools may resort to such restrictions does not\nadvance our inquiry here or allow us to conclude that the facts\nalleged in the Complaint are sufficient to give rise to a special\nrelationship or a state created danger.\n\n       In arguing that we should find a special relationship\nhere, Judge Fuentes cites to Judge Becker‟s statement in\ndissent in Middle Bucks that “a special relationship [between\na public school and its students] may exist under certain\nnarrow circumstances.” Fuentes Dissent 3. We do not\ndisagree. In holding that public schools do not generally have\na constitutional duty to protect students from private actors\nand that the allegations here are not sufficient to establish a\nspecial relationship, we do not foreclose the possibility of a\nspecial relationship arising between a particular school and\nparticular students under certain unique and narrow\ncircumstances. However, any such circumstances must be so\nsignificant as to forge a different kind of relationship between\na student and a school than that which is inherent in the\ndiscretion afforded school administrators as part of the\nschool‟s traditional in loco parentis authority or compulsory\nattendance laws.\n\n        The circumstances that our dissenting colleagues rely\nupon to insist that a special relationship exists under the facts\nalleged here are not “certain narrow” circumstances at all.\nInstead, they are endemic in the relationship between public\nschools and their students. The dissent would hold that a\nspecial relationship exists such that “Blackhawk undertook a\nlimited obligation to keep the Morrows safe . . . because\nBlackhawk compelled school attendance, exercised extensive\ncontrol over not only the student victims but also the specific\nthreat at issue in the case—a violent bully subject to two\nrestraining orders—and enforced school policies that\nprevented the Morrows from being fully able to protect\nthemselves.” Fuentes Dissent 3. However, those factors do\nnot distinguish the circumstances here from those that arise in\nthe general relationship between public schools and their\nstudents.\n\n                               15\n\f       As discussed above, we cannot hold that a special\nrelationship arose from compulsory school attendance laws\nand the concomitant in loco parentis authority and discretion\nthat schools necessarily exercise over students, or the school‟s\nfailure to do more to protect Brittany and Emily, without\nignoring the analysis in DeShaney, and the “considered dicta”\nin Vernonia School District. In arguing to the contrary, our\ndissenting colleagues exaggerate the extent of a school‟s\ncontrol over its students. Judge Fuentes insists that “[t]he\nState‟s authority over children while they are in school\nextends beyond their well-being and is nearly absolute.”\nFuentes Dissent 9 (emphasis added). However, the mere fact\nthat a school can require uniforms, 24 Pa. Stat. Ann. § 13-\n1317.3, or prescribe certain behavior while students are in\nschool, 22 Pa. Code § 12.2, does not suggest a special\nrelationship at all. Rather, such commonly accepted authority\nover student conduct is inherent in the nature of the\nrelationship of public schools and their pupils.13 They do not\nsuggest that a concomitant constitutional duty to protect\nstudents necessarily arises from that authority.\n       Significantly, our dissenting colleagues do not purport\nto argue that compulsory attendance laws and the school‟s\nauthority over students are themselves sufficient to satisfy the\nlimited exception carved out in DeShaney. Thus, the dissent\nattempts to characterize the specific circumstances of this\n\n\n13\n   Moreover, the generic responsibilities and authority\nprescribed by state law are not nearly as compelling and\nauthoritarian as our dissenting colleagues suggest. For\nexample, Judge Fuentes cites 22 Pa. Code § 12.2 in arguing\nthat state law requires that students “engage in conscientious\neffort in classroom work and homework.” Fuentes Dissent 9.\nHowever, it is doubtful that parents or students really fear that\nthe awesome authority or weight of the state will come\ncrashing down upon students who do not hand in homework\nor conscientiously participate in class. It is also not at all\nclear how the state‟s authority to require such “conscientious\neffort” restricts parents‟ ability to protect their children, or the\nstudents‟ ability to protect themselves, while in school.\n\n\n                                16\n\fcase as so extraordinary and compelling that a constitutional\nduty to protect arose under DeShaney. We are not persuaded.\n\n       The fact that “the specific threat at issue in this case”\nwas “a violent bully subject to two restraining orders,”\nFuentes Dissent 3, does not necessarily give rise to a special\nrelationship. The restraining orders to which the dissent\nrefers were addressed to Anderson, not the Defendants, and\nthe orders themselves do not impose any affirmative duties on\nthe Defendants. Indeed, we very much doubt that any\nDefendant was a party to the proceedings that resulted in the\norders, and no such involvement has been alleged. Although\nthe Defendants, and other third parties, are prohibited from\nmaking contact with the Morrow children on Anderson’s\nbehalf, the no-contact orders cannot reasonably be interpreted\nas imposing any obligation on the Defendants to ensure\nAnderson‟s compliance with the orders or to otherwise\nenforce them. Cf. Town of Castle Rock v. Gonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799991\"><a href=\"/opinion/799991/castle-rock-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">545</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">748</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 768 (2005) (holding that police department‟s failure to\nenforce restraining order did not constitute a violation of due\nprocess under the Fourteenth Amendment).\n\n        Moreover, whether our dissenting colleagues are\n referencing the school‟s “No Tolerance Policy,” or the policy\n that allegedly required Anderson‟s expulsion from school, in\n arguing that the Defendants “enforced school policies that\n prevented the Morrows from being fully able to protect\n themselves,” Fuentes Dissent 3, neither the mere existence of\n such common disciplinary policies, nor the school‟s exercise\n of discretion in enforcing them, altered the relationship\n between the school and its students to the extent required to\n create a constitutional duty under the Supreme Court‟s\n precedent.14\n\n14\n   Indeed, Judge Fuentes‟s suggestion that the school‟s “No\nTolerance Policy” limited “the Morrows‟ ability to protect\nthemselves,” Fuentes Dissent 14, is both unavailing and\ntroubling. The manner in which the school interpreted and\nenforced the policy here is certainly open to question as it\nappears Brittany was suspended for resisting Anderson‟s\nattack. However, that does not begin to approach the kind of\nrestriction on freedom required to give rise to a special\nrelationship under DeShaney. Were we to accept Judge\n                              17\n\f      The Morrows‟ attempt to distinguish their situation\nbased on the Defendants‟ “actual knowledge of Anderson‟s\ncriminal conduct in this case” is similarly unpersuasive.\nThey argue that such knowledge, combined with “the quasi-\ncustodial relationship that exists in all cases between a public\nschool and its pupils,” created a special relationship for\nsubstantive due process purposes.\n\n       DeShaney suggests otherwise. Neither our decision in\nMiddle Bucks, nor the dictum in Vernonia, necessarily\nforecloses the possibility of a special relationship arising in\nan appropriate case. However, the Court has instructed that\nany such relationship “arises not from the State‟s knowledge\nof the individual‟s predicament or from its expressions of\nintent to help him, but from the limitation which it has\nimposed on his freedom to act on his own behalf.”\nDeShaney, 489 U.S. at 200. Thus, under DeShaney, the\nDefendants‟ knowledge—of both the no-contact orders and\nAnderson‟s threats and conduct—may be relevant to\ndetermining whether the Defendants‟ conduct was\nsufficiently egregious to violate a previously existing duty to\nprotect the Morrow children, but that knowledge cannot\ncreate a duty that did not otherwise exist.\n\n       To find a special relationship here, our dissenting\ncolleagues rely, in part, on our analysis in the foster care\ncontext in Nicini v. Morra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768726\"><a href=\"/opinion/768726/anthony-nicini-jr-v-edward-morra-new-jersey-department-of-health-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">212</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">798</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir. 2000) (en\nbanc). See Fuentes Dissent 10. However, we explained there\nthat “distinctions between children placed in foster care and\nthe prisoners at issue in Estelle or the institutionalized\nmentally retarded persons at issue in Youngberg are matters\nof degree rather than of kind. In each of these cases the state,\nby affirmative act, renders the individual substantially\n„dependent upon the state . . . to meet [his or her] basic\nneeds.‟” Id. at 808 (alteration in original) (citation omitted)\n(quoting Middle Bucks, 972 F.2d at 1372). By “„finding the\nchildren and placing them with state approved families . . . ,\n\nFuentes‟s proposition, school policies prohibiting the carrying\nof weapons or even cellular telephones at school could\ntheoretically also give rise to a constitutional duty to protect\nbecause such policies can also be interpreted as limiting\nstudents‟ ability to protect themselves.\n\n                              18\n\fthe state assumes an important continuing, if not immediate,\nresponsibility for the child‟s wellbeing.‟” Id. (quoting\nMiddle Bucks, 972 F.2d at 1372).15\n\n        As we explained in Middle Bucks, unlike children in\nfoster care, students in public schools continue to be primarily\ndependent on their parents for their care and protection, not\non their school. Despite the students‟ compulsory attendance\nin school during the school day and the school‟s authority to\nact in loco parentis during that time, the school‟s authority\nand responsibility neither supplants nor replaces the parent‟s\nultimate responsibility for the student absent more than is\nalleged here. Unlike foster care, the restrictions that schools\nplace on students generally, and the specific restrictions\nalleged here, are different in kind from the restrictions faced\nby the prisoners at issue in Estelle or the institutionalized\npersons in Youngberg.\n\n       This point is illustrated by the fact that schools\ngenerally may not administer medical treatment to students\nwithout first obtaining parental consent.

In Smith,\nthe court found a special relationship between the District of\nColumbia and “an adjudicated delinquent whom the District\nhad, by affirmative exercise of its police power, placed with\nits agent, [an independent living program], through a court\norder revocable only by another court order.” Id. at 94. The\ndissent argues that “[l]ike the children in Smith, the Morrows\nwere technically free to „come and go‟ from school after\ncertain hours but „risk[ed] punishment‟ for „fail[ing] to obey\n[the State‟s] restrictions on [their] . . . freedom‟ while in\nschool.” Fuentes Dissent 13 (alterations in original) (quoting\nSmith, 413 F.3d at 94). However, the fact that the juvenile in\nSmith enjoyed a degree of freedom of movement while\nhoused at the independent living program is not\ndeterminative. The state‟s liability arose from the fact that\n16\n   See also Lordes M.

That is precisely what happened in Nicini; it\nis not what happened here.              Moreover, the Court\nacknowledged in DeShaney that “several Courts of Appeals\nhave held, by analogy to Estelle and Youngberg, that the State\nmay be held liable under the Due Process Clause for failing to\nprotect children in foster homes.” Id. Citing this footnote,\nthe court in Smith found that the independent living program\nthere “presents a scenario close to the one described in the\nDeShaney footnote.” Smith, 413 F.3d at 94.\n\n       The dissent contends that this “focus on who remains\nthe victim‟s primary caregiver . . . contrast[s] sharply with our\nholding in Horton v. Flenory, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"532046\"><a href=\"/opinion/532046/mamie-horton-individually-and-as-administratrix-of-the-estate-of-douglas/\"><span class=\"volume\">889</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">454</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir. 1989).”\nFuentes Dissent 6 n.3. We agree that the facts of Horton are\ninstructive, but believe that they clearly counsel against\nimposing a constitutional duty here.\n\n       In Horton, the owner of a nightclub suspected an\nemployee, Powdrill, of burglarizing the club. The owner and\nanother employee began interrogating Powdrill about the\nburglary. During that interrogation, Powdrill was severely\nbeaten. The owner was a retired veteran of the local police\ndepartment, 889 F.2d at 456, and the township where the club\nwas located had “[a]n official policy of deferring to private\nowners with respect to the investigation of crimes in private\nclubs.” Id. at 458. Nevertheless, the owner did eventually\ncall police. An officer, who had served on the police force\nwith the owner, subsequently arrived, but the officer left\nPowdrill alone in the owner‟s custody noting that Powdrill\nwas “in good hands”—despite observing blood and evidence\nof a beating. Id. at 456. After the officer left, Powdrill was\n\n                               21\n\fbeaten again and subsequently died from his injuries. His\nestate brought an action against the municipality and the\nresponding officer under § 1983. We held that the township\ncould be liable because the jury could have found that the\ntownship had “delegated . . . its traditional police functions”\nto the owner of the club. Id. at 458. The responding officer\n“used his official status to confirm that [the owner] was free\nto continue the custodial interrogation even though Mr.\nPowdrill was in fear for his safety and wanted to leave.” Id.\nAlthough we framed the precise issue there as whether or not\nPowdrill “was in state custody at the time of the fatal\nbeating,” id., our inquiry focused on whether the defendant\nhad so limited Powdrill‟s ability to act in his own interest as\nto create the special relationship required for constitutional\nliability. We explained:\n\n      DeShaney requires that the state have imposed\n      some kind of limitation on a victim‟s ability to\n      act in his own interests. While specifically\n      referring        to       imprisonment        and\n      institutionalization—the Estelle and Youngberg\n      examples—the court acknowledges that other\n      similar state-imposed restraints of personal\n      liberty trigger a state duty to prevent harm.\n\nId.\n\n      Our finding of a special relationship in Horton also\nturned on the fact that the abuser there acted pursuant to\ndelegated state authority.\n\n      From the evidence the jury could find that New\n      Kensington delegated to [the owner] its\n      traditional police functions . . . . [A] state can\n      be held responsible for a private action if the\n      private actor has exercised coercive power with\n      significant encouragement, overt or covert,\n      from the state. The function of investigating\n      crimes is clearly a governmental function. An\n      official policy of deferring to private owners\n      with respect to the investigation of crimes in\n      private clubs, which the jury could have found\n      from the evidence, suffices to permit a legal\n\n                              22\n\f       conclusion that [the owner], maintaining\n       custody over Mr. Powdrill, was exercising a\n       delegated state function.\n\nId. (citations omitted).\n\n        The custody that the plaintiff in Horton was subjected\n to when he was fatally beaten was thus akin to the state‟s\n custody over prisoners. The township had ceded its police\n authority to detain and interrogate to the club owner. The\n control a school has over its students does not begin to\n approximate the restriction of freedom of movement and\n isolation from possible assistance that existed in Horton or\n other cases prescribed by DeShaney and its progeny.\n\n       Despite our dissenting colleagues‟ suggestion that the\n school‟s passivity here amounted to affirmative conduct,\n there is no assertion that Anderson acted under authority\n delegated by the school or that she “exercised coercive\n power with significant encouragement . . . from” the school.\n See id. In fact, Anderson was disciplined for her conduct.\n Although the school‟s response may well have been as\n inadequate as it was unfair to the Morrow children, the\n school certainly did not give Anderson or her confederate the\n authority to harass or bully the Morrow children. We\n therefore see no conflict between our analysis here and our\n analysis in Horton.\n\n       In reaching this conclusion, we reiterate that we both\nappreciate the Morrows‟ concerns and that we are\nsympathetic to their plight. Parents in their position should be\nable to send their children off to school with some level of\ncomfort that those children will be safe from bullies such as\nAnderson and her confederate. Indeed, the increasing\nprevalence of the kind of bullying alleged here has generated\nconsiderable discussion and legislative action.

Given the\nlimitations of DeShaney, and the language in Vernonia, it is\nnow clear that the redress the Morrows seek must come from\na source other than the United States Constitution.\n\n        Our dissenting colleagues take us to task for\nexpressing concern for the Morrows‟ plight without providing\na remedy and suggest that the very fact that we are troubled\nby the result counsels in favor of a constitutional remedy. See\nFuentes Dissent 2 (“The Morrows are today left without a\nlegal remedy for these actions. That future victims may seek\nrelief from State legislatures is of no help to them. We do not\nadequately discharge our duty to interpret the Constitution by\nmerely describing the facts [of these cases] as „tragic‟ and\ninvoking state tort law.”) (internal citation and quotation\nmarks omitted) (alteration in original); Ambro Partial\nConcurrence and Partial Dissent 1 (“I share Judge Fuentes‟\nconcern that failing to hold a school accountable for violence\ndone to students creates an incentive for school administrators\nto pursue inaction when they are uniquely situated to prevent\nharm to their students.”).\n\n        However, “the due process clause is not a surrogate for\nlocal tort law or state statutory and administrative remedies.”\nHasenfus v.

Ct. 1983). However, state legislatures retain the\nauthority to reconsider and change such restrictions in order\nto better respond to the kind of bullying that happened here\nand that appears to be all too pervasive in far too many of\ntoday‟s schools. See T.K. v. New York City Dep’t of Educ.,\n779 F. Supp. 2d at 297-98.\n\n       For the reasons we have explained, we cannot fashion\na constitutional remedy under the special relationship theory\nbased on the facts alleged in this case.\n\n                  B. State-Created Danger\n\n        The Morrows alternatively argue that the Defendants\nhad a duty to protect Brittany and Emily because they created\nor exacerbated a dangerous situation. As we explained above,\nin Kneipp v. Tedder, 95 F.3d at 1201, we first adopted the\nstate-created danger theory as a way to establish a\nconstitutional violation in suits brought under § 1983. We\nconfirmed that liability may attach where the state acts to\ncreate or enhance a danger that deprives the plaintiff of his or\nher Fourteenth Amendment right to substantive due process.\nKneipp, 95 F.3d at 1205. To prevail on this theory, the\nMorrows must prove the following four elements:\n\n      1) the harm ultimately caused was foreseeable\nand fairly direct;\n\n       2) a state actor acted with a degree of\n       culpability that shocks the conscience;\n\n       3) a relationship between the state and the\n       plaintiff existed such that the plaintiff was a\n       foreseeable victim of the defendant‟s acts, or a\n       member of a discrete class of persons subjected\n       to the potential harm brought about by the\n       state‟s actions, as opposed to a member of the\n       public in general; and\n\n                               25\n\f       4) a state actor affirmatively used his or her\n       authority in a way that created a danger to the\n       citizen or that rendered the citizen more\n       vulnerable to danger than had the state not acted\n       at all.\n\nBright v. Westmoreland Cnty., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"793871\"><a href=\"/opinion/793871/john-bright-individually-and-in-his-capacity-as-administrator-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">276</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 281 (3d Cir.\n2006) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n       The Defendants focus on the last prong of the test.18\nThey argue that the Morrows have failed to allege any\naffirmative action by school administrators that made the\nMorrow children more vulnerable than they would have been\nhad the administrators stood by and done nothing at all. The\nMorrows argue that the Defendants‟ affirmative act was\nsuspending Anderson, and then implicitly inviting her to\nreturn to school following the suspension. In other words, the\nMorrows argue that by permitting Anderson to return to\nschool rather than expelling her, school officials affirmatively\nused their authority to create a danger that Anderson would\nattack Brittany and Emily once again. The Morrows also\npoint to the “affirmative act” of allowing Anderson to board\nthe Morrow children‟s school bus, where Anderson\nthreatened to attack Brittany.\n\n       We have explained that the line between action and\ninaction is not always easily drawn. “„If the state puts a man\nin a position of danger from private persons and then fails to\nprotect him, it will not be heard to say that its role was merely\npassive; it is as much an active tortfeasor as if it had thrown\nhim into a snake pit.‟” Middle Bucks, 972 F.2d at 1374\n(quoting Bowers v. DeVito, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"407837\"><a href=\"/opinion/407837/thomas-l-bowers-administrator-of-the-estate-of-marguerite-anne-bowers/\"><span class=\"volume\">686</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">616</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 618 (7th Cir.\n1982)). However, the Morrows‟ Complaint simply attempts\nto redefine clearly passive inaction as affirmative acts. Cf.\nSanford v. Stiles, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"795169\"><a href=\"/opinion/795169/kathleen-sanford-individually-and-as-administratrix-of-the-estate-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">456</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">298</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 311-12 (3d Cir. 2006)\n(holding that, where a high school guidance counselor failed\nto properly evaluate the sincerity of a student‟s comment to\nanother student that he wanted to kill himself, she had not\n18\n    The Defendants claim that the Morrows cannot prove the\nfirst three prongs of the test either, but their primary focus is\non prong four.\n\n                                26\n\fcommitted an affirmative act but rather failed to prevent his\ndeath).\n\n        We are not persuaded by the Morrows‟ argument that\nthe Defendants affirmatively created or enhanced a danger to\nBrittany and Emily by suspending Anderson and then\nallowing her to return to school when the suspension ended.\nAlthough the suspension was an affirmative act by school\nofficials, we fail to see how the suspension created a new\ndanger for the Morrow children or “rendered [them] more\nvulnerable to danger than had the state not acted at all.”\nBright, 443 F.3d at 281. To the contrary, the suspension\nlikely made the Morrows safer, albeit temporarily. In\naddition, the fact that Defendants failed to expel Anderson,\nor, as the Morrows would describe it, “permitted” Anderson\nto return to school after the suspension ended, does not\nsuggest an affirmative act.\n\n        While the Morrows make much of the fact that\nDefendants‟ failure to expel Anderson after she was\nadjudicated “guilty of a crime” may have been contrary to a\nschool policy mandating expulsion in such circumstances, we\ndecline to hold that a school‟s alleged failure to enforce a\ndisciplinary policy is equivalent to an affirmative act under\nthe circumstances here.\n\n        The dissent argues that Defendants‟ failure to expel\nAnderson constitutes an affirmative “exercise of authority”\nthat contributed to the danger the Morrows faced, thereby\ntriggering a duty to protect. Under this reasoning, however,\nevery decision by school officials to use or decline to use\ntheir authority, disciplinary or otherwise, would constitute\naffirmative conduct that may trigger a duty to protect. The\ndissent claims that “state authority necessarily brings with it\ndiscretion as to whether or not to take specific actions, and\nthe decision to take one action over another—or to take no\naction at all—is itself an „affirmative exercise of authority‟\nthat may carry serious consequences.” Fuentes Dissent 24.\nThus, were we to accept the dissent‟s formulation here, the\nstate-created danger exception would swallow the rule. 19\n\n19\n  Judge Ambro also makes a very forceful point in\nexpressing a concern that “creating a constitutional tort out of\n                               27\n\fSchools would always be liable, under the Dissent‟s view, for\nany injury that could be linked to either action or inaction.\nAny and all failures to act would be transformed into an\naffirmative exercise of authority.\n\n        The Morrows also rely on the fact that the Defendants\npermitted Anderson to board Emily and Brittany‟s bus despite\nknowing about the no-contact orders against Anderson, and\nknowing that that bus did not service Anderson‟s home route.\nHowever, the only reasonable interpretation of that allegation\nis that the Defendants failed to take any affirmative steps to\nensure that Anderson did not board the Morrow children‟s\nbus.20 Here again, the Complaint attempts to morph passive\ninaction into affirmative acts. However, merely restating the\nDefendants‟ inaction as an affirmative failure to act does not\nalter the passive nature of the alleged conduct.\n\n        As Judge Ambro explains, the requirement of an actual\naffirmative act “is not intended to turn on semantics of act\nand omission. Instead, the requirement serves . . . to\ndistinguish cases where . . . officials might have done more . .\n. [from] cases where . . . officials created or increased the risk\nitself.” Ambro Partial Concurrence and Partial Dissent 1.\nWe therefore hold that the Complaint also fails to state a\ncause of action under the state-created danger exception.\n\n                     IV. CONCLUSION\n\n\n\n\na school‟s failure to expel a student creates a too-easy\nincentive for schools to expel quickly students who engage in\nany violent behavior in order to avoid liability or the threat of\nsuit.” Ambro Partial Concurrence and Partial Dissent 3.\n20\n  For example, school authorities could have alerted the\nappropriate bus drivers of the no-contact orders against\nAnderson and given drivers a photograph of Anderson so they\ncould identify her and prevent her from boarding the wrong\nbus.\n\n                               28\n\f       For all the reasons set forth above, we will affirm the\n District Court‟s order granting the Defendants‟ Motion to\n Dismiss.21\n\n\n\n\n21\n   Because the Morrows cannot make out a claim under\neither the special relationship or state-created danger theories\nof constitutional liability, we need not address whether\ndefendant Balaski should be afforded qualified immunity or\nwhether the School District may be held liable as a municipal\ndefendant.\n\n                               29\n\fSMITH, Circuit Judge, concurring.\n\n       I join Chief Judge McKee‘s well-reasoned majority\nopinion in its entirety.

Faced with a\ntradition that once permitted almost no judicial limitations on\nschools‘ disciplinary authority, id. at 416, I cannot conclude\nthat substantive due process enshrines the opposite—a right\nto judicial intervention in school disciplinary decisions.

To be\nsure, a body of intervening research has revealed that school\nbullying undeniably causes serious harm to its victims. This\nevidence, however, has no bearing on Middle Bucks‘s two-\npart rationale. First, the severity of harm caused by bullying\nis irrelevant to Middle Bucks‘s constitutional judgment that\nsubstantive due process is not triggered by substantial state\ncompulsion. See, e.g., Planned Parenthood of Se. Pa. v.\nCasey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112786\"><a href=\"/opinion/112786/planned-parenthood-of-southeastern-pa-v-casey/\"><span class=\"volume\">505</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">833</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 860 (1992) (acknowledging that ―time\nhas overtaken some of [Roe v.

If anything, students are\nsubjected to less state compulsion today than at the time of\nMiddle Bucks.       With increased availability of private\nschooling, homeschooling, private tutoring, online and\ndistance education, and charter schools, modern families have\nmore options to satisfy the compulsory school laws. And\nschool authority over students has significantly eroded in\nfavor of parental control and private sources of assistance.\nSee New Jersey v.

The majority concludes that the School’s decision not\nto expel Anderson is a failure to act and one that did not\nrender the Morrows more susceptible to danger. I agree, but\nthink we must delve further. Thus, while I join that part of\nthe Court’s judgment, I write separately on this issue.\n\n        The fourth requirement of our state-created danger\nclaim is that ―a state actor affirmatively used his or her\nauthority in a way that created a danger to the citizen or that\nrendered the citizen more vulnerable to danger than had the\nstate not acted at all.‖ Bright v.

This test, I believe, is not\nintended to turn on the semantics of act and omission.\nInstead, the requirement serves an important purpose: to\ndistinguish cases where government officials might have done\nmore to protect a citizen from a risk of harm in contrast to\ncases where government officials created or increased the risk\nitself. Following violence, suffering, and/or death of one of\nour citizens, we often wish that a state actor with the authority\nto do so had intervened. We are not comforted by concluding\nthat officials failed to act when we could just as easily say\nthat they affirmatively decided to do something. But we are\n\n\n\n\n                               1\n\flimited by the protection afforded by the Constitution and the\nSupreme Court’s holding in DeShaney v. Winnebago Cnty.\nDep’t of Soc.

Fuentes Dissent 26.\nBut the context of the School’s decision—the prior violence,\nthe no-contact order, the disciplinary code, and the ability to\nprotect the Morrows by expelling Anderson—are factors\nrelevant to the School’s special relationship with the\nMorrows. I do not believe we can consider these factors to\ndeem the School’s behavior a creation of risk. The School\nacted no differently in failing to protect a vulnerable member\nof society from harm than defendants in cases where no state-\ncreated danger exists, including DeShaney. 489 U.S. at 201\n(risk of abuse suffered by four year old left in the care of his\nfather was not created by social workers who had previously\nremoved him and returned him to the home); Sanford v.\nStiles, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"795169\"><a href=\"/opinion/795169/kathleen-sanford-individually-and-as-administratrix-of-the-estate-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">456</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">298</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 311–12 (3d Cir. 2006) (high school\nstudent’s risk of suicide not caused or increased by guidance\ncounselor who met with him twice); Bright, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"793871\"><a href=\"/opinion/793871/john-bright-individually-and-in-his-capacity-as-administrator-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">276</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(risk of attack not created by police who failed to arrest\nattacker after he violated parole).\n\n       Holding that the School’s actions—or lack thereof—in\nthis case were sufficient to plead a state-created danger claim\n\n\n\n\n                               2\n\fwould substantially broaden this narrow exception.\nDeShaney is grounded in constitutional law, but has an\nimportant practical effect too. Federal courts cannot be the\nforum for every complaint that a government actor could have\ntaken an alternate course that would have avoided harm to\none of our citizens. I also worry that creating a constitutional\ntort out of a school’s failure to expel a student creates a too-\neasy incentive for schools to expel quickly students who\nengage in any violent behavior in order to avoid liability or\nthe threat of suit.\n\n       The special relationship theory, which is far more\ncircumscribed, does not present this same risk.

Eventually, the bully was\nadjudicated a juvenile delinquent and was again ordered to\nhave no contact with Brittany. It also bears noting that many\nof the bully‟s attacks occurred after Blackhawk officials had\nsuspended the Morrows themselves for their involvement in\nthe dispute, pursuant to the School‟s “No Tolerance Policy.”\nIt is reasonable to infer that, to the Morrows, application of\nthe policy (which could have led to their permanent expulsion\nfrom the School) meant that they risked disciplinary action\nshould they act to forestall attacks by the bully. Despite all\nthis, Blackhawk officials refused to protect the Morrows from\ndanger.

Winnebago\nCounty Social Services, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112202\"><a href=\"/opinion/112202/deshaney-v-winnebago-county-dept-of-social-servs/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">189</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1989), and of the\nrelationship between the State and school children.\n\n        Reconsidering the coercive power that the State\nexercises over students, and the ways in which the State may\nrestrict a student and his or her parents‟ ability to protect that\nstudent from harm, we would conclude, like Judge Becker in\nMiddle Bucks, that a special relationship may exist under\ncertain narrow circumstances. See Middle Bucks, 972 F.2d at\n1384 (Becker, J., dissenting). As pertains to this case, we\nwould hold that Blackhawk undertook a limited obligation to\nkeep the Morrows safe from harm at the hands of the bully\nbecause Blackhawk compelled school attendance, exercised\nextensive control over not only the student victims but also\nthe specific threat at issue in the case—a violent bully subject\nto two restraining orders that victimized the Morrows over an\nextended period of time—and enforced school policies that\n\n\n\n\n                                3\n\fprevented the Morrows from being fully able to protect\nthemselves.\n\n                              A.\n\n        As the majority outlines, in DeShaney the Supreme\nCourt held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment did not impose on the State of Wisconsin a\nblanket affirmative duty to interfere with the parental\nrelationship between Randy DeShaney and his son Joshua,\nand that therefore the State was not liable for harm the child\nsuffered or was likely to suffer at the hands of his father. 489\nU.S. at 195-96. The Court noted that an affirmative duty to\nprotect arose only if there was a “special relationship”\nbetween the State and the imperiled individual, and that the\nState‟s actions in taking temporary custody of Joshua and\nlater returning him to his father, who was known to be\nabusive, were insufficient to give rise to such a relationship.\nId. at 197-198.\n\n       The DeShaney Court referred to two cases that\nexemplify when a State enters into a special relationship. In\nEstelle v. Gamble, the Court had held that the Eighth\nAmendment imposed a duty to provide “adequate medical\ncare” to prisoners given that they were unable to procure such\ncare on their own “by reason of the deprivation of [their]\nliberty” by the State.

And in Youngblood v.\nRomeo, the Court extended Estelle‟s holding to require States\nto provide “involuntarily committed mental patients with such\nservices as are necessary to ensure their „reasonable safety‟\nfrom themselves and others.” Id. at 199 (quoting Youngblood\nv.

As the majority recognizes today,\nthe crux of our holding in Middle Bucks is that although the\nState exercises in loco parentis authority over children during\nschool hours, the parents “remain the primary caretakers”\nover their children.

In other words, Middle\nBucks‟ central premise is that a student, unlike a prisoner or\nthe involuntarily committed, is not subjected to “full time\nsevere and continuous state restriction.” Id.\n\n        But Middle Bucks provides no basis to conclude that\nDeShaney endorses an all-or-nothing approach that turns on\nthe existence of “round-the-clock” physical custody or on\nwho remained the primary caregiver. See id. at 1379\n(Sloviter, C.J., dissenting). Were the existence of either fact\ndispositive in Estelle, Youngblood, or even DeShaney itself,\nthe Supreme Court surely would have said so explicitly.\nInstead, the Court explained that the common thread that\nunites Estelle and Youngblood is that a person is left “unable\nto care for himself” by the “State‟s affirmative act of\nrestraining the individual‟s freedom to act on his own behalf.”\nDeShaney, 489 U.S. at 200. The Court contrasted these\nsituations to Joshua‟s case by noting that returning Joshua to\nhis father‟s care did not constitute a restraint on his liberty to\nact on his own behalf. Id. The result in DeShaney is also\nexplained by other facts, none of which turns on the lack of\npermanent physical custody: (1) that the “harms Joshua\nsuffered occurred not while he was in the State‟s custody;”\n(2) that the State “played no part in [the] creation” of the\n\n\n\n\n                                5\n\fdanger; and (3) that the State did not do “anything to render\n[Joshua] any more vulnerable.” Id. at 201.2\n\n       Because DeShaney itself did not provide the Middle\nBucks majority with the absolute physical custody\nrequirement, it relied on our prior decision in Philadelphia\nPolice to conclude that DeShaney “set[] out a test of physical\ncustody.”     Middle Bucks, 972 F.2d at 1370 (citing\nPhiladelphia Police & Fire Ass’n v. Philadelphia, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">874</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">156</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 167 (3d Cir. 1989)). Philadelphia Police had held that\nthe State is not responsible for harm suffered by mentally\nhandicapped individuals living at home, but it neither requires\nabsolute physical custody nor turns on who the primary\ncaregiver was. See Philadelphia Police, 874 F.2d at 167.\n\n2\n  Moreover, the duty assumed in Estelle was commensurate\nwith the restriction the State had imposed on the individual‟s\nliberty: a prisoner is restrained from seeking medical help on\nhis own, so under Estelle the State must provide it.\nDeShaney, 489 U.S. at 198-99 (citing Estelle, 429 U.S. at\n103-104). Estelle does not recognize a generalized duty to\nprotect prisoners from all harm, despite the fact that prisoners\nare under the permanent physical custody of the State. And\nthe only gloss on Youngblood provided in DeShaney was to\nnote that because the mentally committed were less culpable\nthan the incarcerated and “may not be punished at all,” the\nState takes upon itself a duty, broader than in Estelle, to keep\nsuch individuals safe. Id. at 199 (citation omitted). This\nanalysis suggests that the Court favored a more nuanced look\nat the relationship between the individual and the State,\ncertainly one more flexible than the rigid test of Middle\nBucks.\n\n\n\n\n                               6\n\fIndeed, the case arguably implies that the State could be held\nliable for harm suffered by the individual while in temporary\nState custody. To be sure, Philadelphia Police and DeShaney\nforeclose any argument that the State is responsible for the\nsafety of school children while in their own homes. But\nPhiladelphia Police does not bridge the gap between\nDeShaney and an “absolute physical custody” requirement.\nThus, it is clear that Middle Bucks‟ gloss on DeShaney has no\ndoctrinal foundation.3\n\n\n\n3\n  Middle Bucks‟ absolute physical custody requirement and its\nfocus on who remains the victim‟s primary caregiver also\ncontrast sharply with our holding in Horton v.

Id. at 458.\nAlthough we sat en banc in Middle Bucks, the Middle Bucks‟\nmajority‟s failure to address Horton‟s interpretation of\nDeShaney is significant. “[R]eturning to the intrinsically\nsounder doctrine established in prior cases may better serve\nthe values of stare decisis.” Citizens United v.

Reexamining the relationship between\nschool children and the State in light of our understanding of\nDeShaney leads to the inescapable conclusion that a special\nrelationship may exist under certain specific circumstances.\n\n       In Pennsylvania, attending school is obligatory for\nchildren between the ages of eight and seventeen. 24 Pa. Stat.\nAnn. §§ 13-1326, 1327(a). Parents who fail to comply with\nthese mandates face punishment as severe as imprisonment.\nId. §1333(a)(1).4 Once the State compels attendance, it has\nconsiderable power over the child‟s well-being as a matter of\nboth law and fact. Pennsylvania‟s in loco parentis statute\ngives school officials “the same authority as to conduct and\nbehavior over the pupils attending . . . school . . . as the[ir]\nparents.” Id. § 13-1317. And “[t]he rights and liabilities\narising out of an in loco parentis relationship are . . . exactly\nthe same as between parent and child.” T.B. v.

This may be an\nunderstatement.      A parent may punish a child for\n“incorrigibility,” but he may not, like the State, initiate\njuvenile delinquency proceedings. 24 Pa. Stat. Ann. § 13-\n1338.\n\n\n\n\n4\n  The State‟s first intrusion into the lives of its citizens in the\nschool context may be considered to be when it enrolls all\nparents as the funders of public schools via taxation.\n\n\n\n\n                                8\n\f        It is true that parents retain the ultimate legal custody\nand responsibility over the child. But a parent‟s immediate\nability to protect his child is significantly curtailed during the\ntime the child is in the physical custody of school officials.\nDuring that time, the State may well be the only caregiver to\nwhich children may turn to for help. Middle Bucks attempted\nto dilute the strength of this reasoning by noting that it cannot\n“be denied that a parent is justified in withdrawing his child\nfrom a school where the health and welfare of the child is\nthreatened.” 972 F.2d at 1371 (quoting Zebra v. Sch. Dist. of\nPittsburgh, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">296</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">748</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 751 (Pa. 1972)).

And in Zebra, a parent\ncould not withdraw his child even though he was threatened\nwith physical harm “if any reports were made to the school\nauthorities” regarding a bully‟s extortion attempt, and\n“[m]any of the . . . students became ill, developed nervous\nconditions, required medical treatment, [and] were afraid\nwhile attending [the school].” Sch.

See\ngenerally 24 Pa. Stat. Ann. § 13-1317.3; 22 Pa. Code § 12.2\n(detailing student responsibility to engage in “conscientious\neffort in classroom work and homework”). Officials may\n“proceed against said child before the juvenile court” for\nmisbehavior. 24 Pa. Stat. Ann. § 13-1338. At thirteen, the\nchild is also subject to penalties for failure to comply with\ncompulsory school laws. Id. § 13-1333(b).5\n\n        The Blackhawk Student Handbook reflects these\nrestrictions on students‟ liberty and on their parent‟s ability to\nact on the child‟s behalf, and goes further by regulating\nstudent conduct in classrooms, school buses, cafeterias, and\nsporting activities; providing that students missing class will\nbe required to attend the School for detention on Saturdays\nand that officials “may consider corporal punishment” upon a\nstudent; and prohibiting students from having cell phones.\nSee Blackhawk High School Student Handbook “Statement of\nStudent             Behavior,”            available             at\nhttp://blackhawk.bhs.schoolfusion.us/modules/cms/pages.pht\n\n\n5\n   That these measures are “inherent in the nature of the\nrelationship of public schools and their pupils,” Majority Op.\nat 16, is of no moment. See also id. at 15. Restrictions on\nliberty are also “inherent” in the relationship between the\nState and the imprisoned or involuntarily committed, but the\nsignificance of such restrictions is not diminished by the fact\nthat the State has a vested and even necessary power to\nimpose them.\n\n\n\n\n                               10\n\fml?pageid=41593 (hereinafter “Handbook”); see also 24 Pa.\nStat. Ann. § 13-1317.6\n\n       In DeShaney, the State simply left Joshua where it\nfound him; he was not harmed while in the State‟s physical\ncustody or by anyone or anything over which the State had\nany immediate authority. Here, by contrast, the State\naffirmatively removed the children from their parents‟\ncustody for a period of time, limited what both the children\nand the parents could do respecting the children‟s safety\nduring that period, and exercised control over a continuous\nthreat the children faced over an extended period of time.\nThis is enough to hold that a special relationship existed\nbetween the School and the Morrows. But if more were\nneeded, one may look at cases involving the special\nrelationship between the State and children it places in foster\ncare.\n\n\n6\n   Given the prohibition against students carrying means of\ncommunicating with their parents during school hours, which\nin 1992 represented a ban on pagers, it is obviously difficult,\nif not practically impossible, for a student to seek help from a\nparent during school hours. Middle Bucks largely overlooked\nthis. 972 F.3d at 1372 (noting that “channels for outside\ncommunication were not totally closed” during school hours).\nContrary to the majority‟s suggestion, we do not question the\nwisdom of school policies aimed at student safety or\ndiscipline, see Majority Op. at 17 n.14, and we doubt schools\nwill change any policies to avoid liability under the narrow\ncircumstances described here. But we look to those policies\nto better understand the nature of the relationship between\nstudents and the State.\n\n\n\n\n                              11\n\f       Since Middle Bucks, several Courts of Appeals have\nanswered the question left open by the Supreme Court in\nDeShaney regarding the existence of a special relationship\nbetween the State and the children it places in foster homes.\nSee 489 U.S. at 201 n.9. These courts have held that a special\nrelationship exists in such cases because the State, in placing\na child in foster care, “renders the individual substantially\ndependent upon the state . . . to meet [his or her] basic needs.”\nNicini v.

The\nchild‟s parents had signed a foster care placement agreement\nwith the State, and the State permitted the child to stay on a\ntemporary basis with another family, the Morras, after the\nchild ran away from home. The child sued the State on the\ntheory that it had failed to sufficiently investigate the Morras,\nwhom he alleged sexually abused him. Although we\n“recognize[d] that the analogy between foster children . . .\nand prisoners and institutionalized persons” from Estelle and\nYoungblood was “incomplete,” and that foster children “enjoy\na greater degree of freedom and are more likely to be able to\ntake steps to ensure their own safety,” we held that a special\nrelationship existed because the child was effectively in State\n\n\n\n\n                               12\n\fcustody and was “substantially dependent” on the State for\nhis safety. 212 F.3d at 808 (quotation marks omitted).7\n\n       Nicini thus “discredit[s]” not just the “underlying\nreasoning” of Middle Bucks, but also its reading of DeShaney.\nCitizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 921 (Roberts, C.J., concurring)\n(explaining that “stare decisis does not control” when the\n“underlying reasoning” of precedent in question has been\n“discredited”). Nicini makes clear that physical custody\ncannot be the lynchpin of a DeShaney special relationship\nbecause the child there was not under the State‟s control at\nthe time the harm occurred. Moreover, the State in Nicini\nwas not the primary caregiver. As the D.C. Circuit has\nrecognized, the result and reasoning in the foster care cases\nhave thus created “tension [with the] public school cases”\n\n7\n  Middle Bucks places some emphasis on the fact that schools\ndo not restrict a child‟s ability to provide for his basic needs,\nsee Middle Bucks, 972 F.2d at 1372, but this is not the proper\nrubric of analysis under DeShaney. The State did not restrict\nthe individual‟s ability to provide for his basic needs in\nYoungblood or in the foster care cases. The individual‟s\nability to do so was restricted by circumstances over which\nthe State had no control and in which it played no part. At\nmost, the State undertook some responsibility when it stepped\ninto the lives of such individuals. So too in the school\ncontext. Minors are unable to provide for their basic needs\nwithout their parents on account of age. By compelling\nattendance in school, the State does not alter that reality, but\ndoes temporarily curtail a parent‟s ability to be a caregiver,\nthereby undertaking that responsibility—albeit a more limited\none—in the same way it does in Youngblood and Nicini.\n\n\n\n\n                               13\n\fbecause “[b]oth involve state constriction of a child‟s liberty\n. . . yet only the former triggers DeShaney custody.” Smith v.\nDistrict of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186512\"><a href=\"/opinion/186512/smith-minnie-v-dc/\"><span class=\"volume\">413</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">86</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 96 (D.C. Cir. 2005). And\nSmith itself demonstrates that the fact that children return to\ntheir parents at the end of the school day is not dispositive.\nThere, the Court held that a State has a special relationship\nwith juvenile delinquents the State places in an “independent\nliving” youth program, but over which it exerts neither\nabsolute physical control nor supervision. See id. at 94.8\n\n        Moreover, not only do these cases provide reason to\nrevisit the legal underpinning of Middle Bucks, they provide\nfurther support for holding that a special relationship exists in\nthis case. Here, unlike in Nicini or DeShaney, the State had\ncustody of the children at the time of the injury in question,\nand the children were “substantially dependent” on the State\nfor their safety during school hours, despite the existence of\nother caregivers. Nicini, 212 F.3d at 808 (quotation marks\nomitted). Like the children in Smith, the Morrows were\ntechnically free to “come and go” from school after certain\nhours but “risk[ed] punishment” for “fail[ing] to obey [the\nState‟s] restrictions on [their] . . . freedom” while in school.\n\n8\n  Indeed, even though a student returns home after the school\nday, the State may continue to exercise some control over\nsome of the student‟s activities. See J.S. ex rel. Snyder v.\nBlue Mountain Sch. Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"218709\"><a href=\"/opinion/218709/js-ex-rel-snyder-v-blue-mountain-school-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">650</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">915</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir. 2011)\n(addressing propriety of school action under the First\nAmendment). If students have a cause of action under § 1983\nagainst school administrators who attempt to discipline them\nfor out-of-school internet postings as we held in J.S., then\nsurely students also have a cause of action against school\nadministrators who fail to protect them from in-school harms.\n\n\n\n\n                               14\n\fSmith, 413 F.3d at 94. If anything, the existence of a special\nrelationship is clearer here than in Nicini because the State in\nthis case had physical custody over both the victim and the\naggressor and was thus uniquely positioned to protect the\nchild from harm. Neither factor existed in Nicini or in\nDeShaney. Fairly read, the additional element of control that\nexisted in the relationship between the State and Nicini that\ndid not exist in DeShaney is that in Nicini the State entered\ninto a temporary agreement with Nicini‟s parents pursuant to\nwhich the parents consented to have their son placed in foster\ncare. More is present here. Compulsory schooling laws,\ntogether with the restrictions on parents‟ and their children‟s\nability to free themselves from State control, arguably impose\non the State a greater obligation here than that which it\nundertook in Nicini.\n\n        The majority seizes on the temporary nature of the\nstudent/State relationship and also attempts to distinguish\nNicini and Smith on the ground that parents remain the\nprimary caregivers over school children. But this fact does\nnot negate that during school hours the State has the\n“immediate [] responsibility for the child‟s wellbeing.”\nNicini, 212 F.3d at 808. In our view, this fact demonstrates,\nat most, that the difference between the State‟s relationship\nwith the Nicini children and schoolchildren is a difference in\ndegree, not kind, and suggests that the proper course is to\nimpose a constitutional duty on schools only under limited\ncircumstances. See Middle Bucks, 972 F.2d at 1384 (Becker,\nJ., dissenting). In Middle Bucks, Judge Becker found the\nexistence of a special relationship based on the state‟s\ncompulsory attendance laws, the student‟s disability, and the\n“affirmative steps [the school took] to confine the student to\nsituations where she was physically threatened.” Id. Under\n\n\n\n\n                              15\n\fthe circumstances before us—Pennsylvania‟s compulsory\nschooling laws, the existence of the restraining orders that\nprohibited contact between the bully and the Morrows, the\nfact that the School had custody and control over the very\nthreat that harmed the Morrows, and the enforcement of the\n“No-Tolerance” Policy, all suggesting that the Morrows‟\nability to protect themselves was limited—we “have no\ndifficulty deciding” that a special relationship arose between\nthe School and the Morrows. Id.\n\n        Restrictions on a person‟s liberty to protect him- or\nherself from danger are the lynchpin of DeShaney. See 489\nU.S. at 199-201. An approach that abandons Middle Bucks‟\ndoctrinally unsound requirements and focuses on whether a\nState substantially restricted a student‟s ability to defend\nherself from a particular danger, in addition to the general\nrestraints on liberty imposed by compulsory schooling laws,\nis therefore more in line with DeShaney and simply makes\nmore sense. Adopting such an approach and considering the\nspecific circumstances of this case, we would hold that the\nComplaint has adequately pled the existence of a special\nrelationship between the Morrows and the School vis-à-vis\nthe bully, and remand the case for discovery on that claim.9\n\n9\n  I would also note that, in the school context, children are\nplaced under State control for the undeniably important goal\nof “prepar[ing them] for citizenship in the Republic.” Bethel\nSch.

Seizing on this\nlanguage, the majority concludes that “it is difficult to\n\n\nunconstitutional to refuse to protect from harm school\nchildren whose liberty the State restricts on its own accord.\nSee DeShaney, 489 U.S. at 199 (“If it is cruel and unusual\npunishment to hold convicted criminals in unsafe conditions,\nit must be unconstitutional . . . to confine the involuntarily\ncommitted—who may not be punished at all—in unsafe\nconditions.” (citation omitted)).\n\n\n\n\n                              17\n\fimagine a clearer or more forceful indicator of the Court‟s\ninterpretation of its holding in DeShaney.” Majority Op. at\n13.\n\n       But the Vernonia dictum cannot bear the great weight\nthe majority places on it.10 Simply put, this case is not a\n“general matter.” Vernonia, 515 U.S. at 655. The School\nadministrators here had custody of a bully, who was\nprohibited from contact with Brittany Morrow by two court\n\n10\n    That is particularly true because much of the dicta in\nVeronia that both precedes and follows the language quoted\nby the majority points in the opposite direction. In framing\nthe degree of control that public school officials exercise over\ntheir students, the Court began with the premise that\n“unemancipated minors lack some of the most fundamental\nrights of self-determination—including even the right of\nliberty in its narrow sense, i.e., the right to come and go at\nwill.” 515 U.S. at 654. The Court also noted that it had\n“rejected the notion that public schools . . . exercise only\nparental power over their students,” a “view of things” that it\nsaid is “not entirely consonant with compulsory education\nlaws.” Id. at 655 (internal quotation marks omitted). And the\nCourt “emphasized[] that the nature of that power is custodial\nand tutelary, permitting a degree of supervision and control\nthat could not be exercised over free adults,” id., following\nits passing reference to DeShaney with a recitation of the\nvarious ways in which “school authorities ac[t] in loco\nparentis” and a statement that the nature of constitutional\nfreedoms enjoyed by students “is what is appropriate for\nchildren in school.” Id. at 655-56 (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n\n\n\n\n                              18\n\forders. Despite the State‟s knowledge of a very specific,\ncontinuing, and serious threat against a particular student, the\nSchool failed to prevent subsequent attacks and instead took\naction against the victims themselves pursuant to the “No\nTolerance Policy.” When faced with a specific request for\nhelp, the School told the Morrows that it could not offer\nassistance, and even suggested it would be best if they, not\nthe bully, left and attended another school.\n\n       To be sure, we do not “lightly ignore” Supreme Court\ndicta, Majority Op. at 13, and the Vernonia dictum\nundoubtedly “invites some caution,” Hasenfus v. LaJeunesse,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198449\"><a href=\"/opinion/198449/hasenfus-v-lajeunesse/\"><span class=\"volume\">175</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">68</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 71 (1st Cir. 1999). But we also ought not to\nstretch dicta beyond the specific question it controls, so as to\ncurtail constitutional rights. While the Vernonia dictum\nprecludes us from holding that school districts have as “a\ngeneral matter” a duty to protect students, it does not\nforeclose finding a special relationship under specific\ncircumstances.11\n\n                               2.\n\n       Nor do we lightly suggest that our precedent be\noverturned.

See supra Part I.A. The fact\nthat the majority does not defend the outcome of Middle\nBucks as standing on its own suggests that the decision\nremains sufficiently controversial as to counsel “a greater\nwillingness to consider new approaches capable of restoring\nour doctrine to sounder footing.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct.\nat 922 (Roberts, C.J., concurring). Even the Supreme Court,\nwhen it “has confronted a wrongly decided, unworkable\nprecedent calling for some future action . . .

See,\ne.g., Deborah Austern Colson, Note, Safe Enough to Learn:\nPlacing an Affirmative Duty of Protection on Public Schools\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983, 30 HARV. C.R.-C.L. L. REV. 169,\n183, 196 (1995) (denouncing “mechanical” analysis of the\nrelationship between students and school officials, and\nsuggesting that we should “make case-by-case, fact-intensive\ninquiries into state action”); Robert C.

REV.\n1224 (1993).\n\n\n\n\n                               20\n\f        In addition, although the record before us on this\nquestion is bare, one might also argue that at least some\nfactual developments since Middle Bucks have further\nundercut its rationale and provide additional reasons to\nreexamine it. The proper question is whether Middle Bucks‟\nassumptions about the level of control that schools exert over\nstudents have been challenged. There are now abundant\nexamples of schools exercising greater control over students,\nranging from technology tracking student movements at all\ntimes to ensure they are in class, see Maurice Chammah and\nNick Swartsell, Student IDs That Track the Students, N.Y.\nTIMES, OCT. 6, 2012, http://nyti.ms/ThvbFq, to monitoring\nonline social media activity within and outside school\npremises, see, e.g., J.S.., 650 F.3d at 915, and, in the wake of\nrecent tragic school shootings, locking classrooms in further\nrestriction of student movement. See, e.g., Stephen Ceasar\nand Howard Blume, To lock classroom doors or not?, LOS\nANGELES TIMES, Jan. 13, 2013, http://soc.li/2N96T3f (noting\nincrease in locked classrooms in the wake of the Newtown,\nConnecticut shootings, and how such measures have resulted\nin other problems such as an instance of a teacher sexually\nassaulting students).13 Stare decisis does not require us to\n\n13\n    We do not contend that the limitations on students‟\nfreedoms are comparable to those imposed on prisoners or the\ninvoluntarily committed. See Majority Op. at 14-15. The\nexamples do show, however, that the relationship between\nschool children and the State is far more intrusive than the\nrelationship between Joshua DeShaney and the social services\ndepartment, and that in some ways the relationship restricts\nthe freedom of students, as a factual matter, more so than the\nrelationship between the State and the children in Nicini and\nSmith.\n\n\n\n\n                              21\n\fdefinitively settle the questions raised by these new\ncircumstances, nor does it preclude us from revisiting Middle\nBucks while sitting en banc.\n\nII.   Blackhawk May Have Also Created the Danger\n      That Harmed The Morrows\n\n       The Morrows also argue that the School may be liable\nunder the “state-created danger” theory.14 The majority\nconcludes that this cause of action must also be dismissed\nbecause the Morrows have failed to plead an “affirmative act”\nby the School. Majority Op. at 26-27. Although we have\nacknowledged that “the line between action and inaction may\nnot always be clear” in the context of these kinds of claims,\nBright v. Westmoreland Cnty., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"793871\"><a href=\"/opinion/793871/john-bright-individually-and-in-his-capacity-as-administrator-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">276</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 282 (3d Cir.\n2006), the consequence of that line becomes sadly clearer\nwith the Court‟s decision in this case: administrators who let\nviolence run rampant can take shelter under the label\n“inaction.” Dereliction of duty becomes a school‟s best\ndefense.     This outcome is contrary to an appropriate\nunderstanding of the state-created danger doctrine. Indeed,\nalthough the doctrine represents a narrow exception to\nDeShaney, the majority narrows the exception to the\nvanishing point by saying that school officials are free to\nignore court orders and their own disciplinary code, enabling\na pattern of physical abuse to persist.\n\n\n14\n   We and other Circuits derived this theory from the\nSupreme Court‟s statement in DeShaney that “[w]hile the\nState may have been aware of the dangers that [plaintiff]\nfaced in the free world, it played no part in their creation.”\n489 U.S. at 201.\n\n\n\n\n                             22\n\f     To prove a state-created danger, a plaintiff must\ndemonstrate that:\n\n       (1) the harm ultimately caused was foreseeable\n       and fairly direct; (2) a state actor acted with a\n       degree of culpability that shocks the conscience;\n       (3) a relationship between the state and the\n       plaintiff existed such that the plaintiff was a\n       foreseeable victim of the defendant‟s acts, or a\n       member of a discrete class of persons subjected\n       to the potential harm brought about by the\n       state‟s actions, as opposed to a member of the\n       public in general; and (4) a state actor\n       affirmatively used his or her authority in a way\n       that created a danger to the citizen or that\n       rendered the citizen more vulnerable to danger\n       than had the state not acted at all.\n\nId. at 281 (quotation marks and citations omitted). The first\nand third elements are not in dispute in this case.15 We\ntherefore discuss the second and fourth elements to\n\n\n\n15\n  The first prong is satisfied by the two court orders directing\nthe bully to have no contact with the Morrows, which were\ndelivered to the School, because the threat posed by the bully\nwas both “foreseeable” by the School and “fairly direct” as to\nthe Morrows. The third prong is satisfied because the\nassignment of the Morrows to Blackhawk under the\ncompulsory school attendance law made them part of a\n“discrete class of person subject to the potential harm”\nbrought about by the School‟s conduct.\n\n\n\n\n                              23\n\fdemonstrate that the Morrows‟ complaint adequately pleads\nthis cause of action.16\n\n                              A.\n\n       The second prong of the state-created danger test sets\n“deliberate indifference” as “[t]he level of culpability\nrequired to shock the conscience . . . in cases where\ndeliberation is possible and officials have time to make\nunhurried judgments.” Sanford v. Stiles, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"795169\"><a href=\"/opinion/795169/kathleen-sanford-individually-and-as-administratrix-of-the-estate-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">456</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">298</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 309\n(3d Cir. 2006) (quotation marks omitted). The “deliberate\nindifference” formulation applies here because the decision\nwith respect to the bully and the Morrows was neither “split-\nsecond” nor made in a “matter of hours or minutes,” id. at\n310 (citation omitted), but rather was made and sustained\nover eight months stretching from January to October 2008.\n\n       In addition, the Complaint here supports an inference\nof deliberate indifference on the part of the School principal,\nBalaski. Balaski knew that the bully was not permitted to\ncontact the Morrows. Moreover, the Handbook mandates\nsome action by officials in response to students who commit\n“Level IV” offenses, which include assault and battery, and\n\n16\n    Because, as noted, this case comes to us from a ruling on a\nmotion to dismiss, we must draw all reasonable inferences in\nthe Morrows‟ favor. Monroe, 536 F.3d at 205. If, based on\nthe facts pled in the Morrows‟ Complaint, “we cannot\nreasonably conclude at this juncture of the case that the harm\n. . . came about by means apart from the state,” Middle Bucks,\n972 F.2d at 1382 (Sloviter, C. J., dissenting), the Morrows\nshould have the opportunity for discovery to determine the\nprecise nature of the School‟s conduct.\n\n\n\n\n                              24\n\farguably calls for their expulsion. However, Balaski ignored\nthe import of the no-contact orders and decided not to abide\nby the school‟s own Disciplinary Code. His decisions are\nalleged to have put the bully in proximity to and contact with\nthe Morrows, despite ample reason to believe the bully would\ncontinue to assault the Morrows. Consequently, they have\nadequately pled deliberate indifference and satisfied the\nsecond prong of the state-created danger theory.\n\n                               B.\n\n        Under the fourth prong of the theory, “liability . . . is\npredicated upon the states‟ affirmative acts which work to the\nplaintiffs‟ detriment in terms of exposure to danger.”17\n\n17\n   It is worth noting that DeShaney does not actually compel\nthe inclusion of the “affirmative act” requirement into the\nfourth element of the state-created danger test. When we first\nconsidered the state-created danger theory, we said that\nDeShaney holds “that a state‟s failure to take affirmative\naction to protect a victim from the actions of a third person\nwill not, in the absence of a custodial relationship between the\nstate and the victim, support a civil rights claim.” Brown v.\nGrabowski, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">922</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1097</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1100-01 (3d Cir. 1990).\nHowever, DeShaney used the phrase “affirmative act” only to\nrefer to state conduct sufficient to create a special\nrelationship. See, e.g., DeShaney, 489 U.S. at 200. By\ncontrast, in contemplating the possibility of a state-created\ndanger, the Court simply suggested that the State must have\n“played [some] part” in the creation of that danger. Id. at\n201. Much like the requirement that the State have absolute\nphysical custody in the context of the special relationship test,\nthe “affirmative act” element is our own addition, and one\n\n\n\n\n                               25\n\fBright, 443 F.3d at 282 (quoting Middle Bucks, 972 F.2d at\n1374). But it is not easy to discern from our cases what\nconstitutes an affirmative act and what does not.\n\n        In Kneipp v. Tedder, we held that there was a\nsubstantive due process violation when police stopped an\nintoxicated couple on the street and then permitted the wife to\ngo home alone, resulting in her fall down an embankment and\nultimate death. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"726573\"><a href=\"/opinion/726573/samantha-kneipp-an-incompetent-person-by-ronald-a-cusack-sr-rosanne-m/\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1199</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1211 (3d Cir. 1996). Then, in\nRivas v. City of Passaic, we held liable emergency medical\ntechnicians (“EMTs”) who told police officers that a man in\nthe midst of a seizure had assaulted them but did not inform\nthe officers of the man‟s medical condition. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"785861\"><a href=\"/opinion/785861/milagros-rivas-individually-and-as-administrator-ad-prosequendum-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">365</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">181</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n195 (3d Cir. 2004). We said that the state had created a\ndanger in Kneipp because the defendants “used their authority\nas police officers to create a dangerous situation or to make\n[the victim] more vulnerable to danger [than] had they not\nintervened.” 95 F.2d at 1209. In Rivas, we aggregated an\nearlier action (the EMTs‟ call that brought the police) with\nthe inaction that was the actual cause of harm (the failure to\ninform the police of the victim‟s condition) and decided it\nwas sufficient because such sequence “created an opportunity\nfor harm that would not have otherwise existed.” 365 F.3d at\n197.\n\n       As these cases demonstrate, virtually any action may\nbe characterized as a failure to take some alternative action or\nvice-versa. See, e.g., Covington Cnty., 675 F.3d at 864, 866\n(describing the police officers in Kneipp as having “sent” the\nvictim home alone, but recasting parents‟ allegation that a\n\n\nthat is not necessarily helpful to safeguarding constitutional\nrights.\n\n\n\n\n                              26\n\fschool released their child to an unauthorized person in\nviolation of school policy as a “failure to adopt a stricter\npolicy”).18\n\n       Moreover, any conduct pled as the source of a state-\ncreated danger is likely to include a combination of action\nand inaction, depending on how far back in the causal chain a\ncourt goes. See Bright, 443 F.3d at 291 (Nygaard, J.,\n\n18\n   We also struggled with the “action/inaction” determination\nin Middle Bucks when we distinguished two cases in which\nthe state indisputably created a danger by a failure to act. The\nfirst case was Horton, where a club owner empowered by the\npolice to act as law enforcement beat up one of his employees\nwhile interrogating him about an alleged theft. The club\nowner then called a police officer who failed to remove the\nemployee from the club owner‟s custody, despite evidence of\nsevere physical mistreatment. We held that the police officer\nwas potentially liable. See Horton, 889 F.2d at 458. In the\nother case, a minor was committed to a foster home based on\na charge of assault and battery upon her father. The state later\nlearned, but failed to disclose, the fact that the parents had\nfabricated the assault charge. The First Circuit held that the\nstate was liable because its failure to disclose the false charge\nresulted in continued custody of the daughter in foster homes\nand other placements. See Germany v. Vance, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"518738\"><a href=\"/opinion/518738/suzanne-germany-v-carol-vance-suzanne-germany-v-carol-vance/\"><span class=\"volume\">868</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st\nCir. 1989). We distinguished those cases from Middle Bucks,\nin which we held that a failure to act did not support a state-\ncreated danger claim, because we “read both cases to turn\nupon a finding of „functional‟ custody,” 972 F.2d at 1375,\nthat we believed did not exist in Middle Bucks, but we\nprovided no justification for that distinction.\n\n\n\n\n                               27\n\fdissenting) (“By cabining Bright‟s claim based solely on an\nensuing delay in taking action, the majority lops off the initial\naffirmative act so it can conclude that there was no\naffirmative act.”).    Indeed, in Kneipp and Rivas, the\nimmediate harm to the victims was due to the defendant‟s\nfailure to act. Therefore, the better way of understanding\nthese cases, contrary to the majority‟s embrace of the\n“affirmative act” requirement today, is to recognize that “the\ndispositive factor appears to be whether the state has in some\nway placed the plaintiff in a dangerous position that was\nforeseeable, and not whether the act was more appropriately\ncharacterized as an affirmative act.” Morse v. Lower Merion\nSch. Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"749872\"><a href=\"/opinion/749872/jerome-p-morse-individually-and-as-of-the-estate-of-diane-m-morse/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">902</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 915 (3d Cir. 1997).19\n\n19\n   Given that, as noted, the “affirmative act” requirement is\nnot actually present in DeShaney, it is not surprising that we\nhave not always required an “affirmative act” as part of the\nfourth prong of the state-created danger test. As Judge\nNygaard noted in Bright, “[s]ince Kneipp . . . enunciated our\nstate-created danger test, not one of our cases [had] inserted\nthe word „affirmatively‟ into the fourth element of the test”\nprior to Bright. 443 F.3d at 288 (Nygaard, J., dissenting).\nRather, we consider whether “the state actor used his\nauthority to create an opportunity for danger that otherwise\nwould not have existed.” Kneipp, 95 F.3d at 1208; see\ngenerally Bright, 443 F.3d at 288 (Nygaard, J., dissenting)\n(collecting cases). Judge Nygaard rightly observed in Bright\nthat these cases “shifted away from inquiring into the\nexistence of affirmative acts as a standard to establish the\nfourth element of our test for a compelling reason: to so hinge\nour inquiry would center us squarely in the troublesome\ndecisional thicket governing the distinction between action\nand inaction.” Bright, 443 F.3d at 289.\n\n\n\n\n                               28\n\f        The majority in Bright suggested that there is “no\nconflict” between the “use of authority” and “affirmative act”\nformulations of the fourth prong of the state-created danger\ntest because “state actors cannot use their authority to create .\n. . an opportunity [for injury to the plaintiff] by failing to act.”\n443 F.3d at 283 n.6 (quotation marks omitted). But that\nstatement is wrong both linguistically and logically. It is\nwrong linguistically because authority is a broader concept\nthan action. See Ye v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"797564\"><a href=\"/opinion/797564/zi-z-ye-yu-zhen-cao-hw-v-united-states-of-america-us-department-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">634</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 639-40\n(3d Cir. 2007) (treating “affirmative action” as a specific\ninstance of the “exercise of authority”). And it is wrong\nlogically because state authority necessarily brings with it\ndiscretion whether to take specific actions, and the decision to\ntake one action over another—or to take no action at all—is\nitself an “affirmative exercise of authority” that may carry\nserious consequences. In many, if not most, state-created\ndanger cases, the state actor will have made a decision to act\nin the context of some set of policies. For example, police\ndepartments have procedures with respect to the enforcement\nof restraining orders, and their enforcement decisions must be\nviewed in the context of those policies. See, e.g., Sheets v.\nMullins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"777345\"><a href=\"/opinion/777345/theresa-sheets-theresa-sheets-as-the-administrator-for-the-estate-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">287</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">581</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 589 (6th Cir. 2002) (considering\nsheriff‟s liability in the context of court-mandated process for\nrestraint orders); Freeman v.

If a school exercises its authority to\ncontravene a policy designed to protect students, then “the\n\n\n\n\n                                29\n\fschool officials‟ role [is] not merely passive or simply\nnegligent.” Covington Cnty., 675 F.3d at 882 (Wiener, J.,\ndissenting). It cannot rightly be said of a school‟s decision to\nexercise its authority to violate or suspend a policy that would\nprotect a student that “it placed [that student] in no worse\nposition than that in which he would have been had [the state]\nnot acted at all.”20 DeShaney, 489 U.S. at 201. As we said in\nMiddle Bucks, “[i]f the state puts a man in a position of\ndanger from private persons and then fails to protect him, it\nwill not be heard to say that its role was merely passive; it is\nas much an active tortfeasor as if it had thrown him into a\nsnake pit.” 972 F.2d at 1374 (citation omitted). The\nmajority‟s argument that our view of the state-created danger\nexception threatens to “swallow the rule,” Majority Op. at 26,\nignores the key role played by school disciplinary policies, as\nwell as other policies that cabin officials‟ discretion, in our\nformulation of the state-created danger exception.\n\n20\n   One might argue that holding public schools liable under\nthe state-created danger theory based on their own protective\npolicies creates an incentive to eliminate or weaken those\npolicies. However, those policies are typically mandated by\nthe State. For example, Pennsylvania requires that each\nschool “adopt a code of student conduct that includes policies\ngoverning student discipline.” 22 Pa. Code § 12.3(c). Also,\nunder its “Safe Schools” statute, Pennsylvania requires each\nschool to have a policy relating to bullying that must be\nincorporated into its code of student conduct and disciplinary\ncode. 24 Pa. Stat. Ann. § 13-1303.1-A(a). Moreover, we\ndoubt that any rational school district will opt for eliminating\npolicies designed to protect children, and permit teachers to\nabandon children to danger, simply to avoid liability in\negregious cases such as this.\n\n\n\n\n                              30\n\f       Ultimately, the misguided effort to equate “affirmative\nact” and “exercise of authority” begs the real question at\nissue: whether a state actor increased the risk someone faced.\nRegardless of whether a state-created danger requires either\nan “affirmative act” to place an individual in danger or an\n“exercise of authority” that renders him more vulnerable to\ndanger, the facts pled in the Complaint, accepted as true,\ntogether with the reasonable inferences we are required to\ndraw, satisfy either standard.\n\n       While the majority reasons there was no affirmative\nact on the part of the School, it may be inferred from the\nComplaint that the School did do something. Principal\nBalaksi engaged in decision-making as to the implementation\nof a provision of the Disciplinary Code. The Disciplinary\nCode states that Level IV offenses “are clearly criminal in\nnature and are so serious that they always require\nadministrative action resulting in the immediate removal from\nschool.” Compl. ¶ 16 (emphasis added). Therefore, it may be\nreasonably inferred that the School affirmatively exercised its\ndiscretion to permit the bully to return to school after she was\nadjudicated a delinquent and made the subject of the two no-\ncontact orders. Moreover, the School conceded at oral\nargument that the principal could have initiated the hearing\nprocess that would have been necessary prior to permanently\nexpelling the bully from the School, but that he did not do so.\nConsequently, it is fairly inferable from the Complaint that\nthere were internal discussions that preceded the decision to\ndecline enforcement of the Disciplinary Code against the\nbully. Those discussions, and that decision, put the Morrows\n\n\n\n\n                              31\n\fat a heightened risk of harm and satisfy the fourth element of\nthe state-created danger test.21\n\n        The majority‟s conclusion to the contrary turns on its\nassumption that the bully would have continued to attend\nschool had she not been suspended. See Majority Op. at 26-\n27. But this is plainly incorrect in light of the Disciplinary\nCode that obligated School officials to do something about\nthe bully‟s continued criminal behavior after her return from\nschool. Without explanation, the majority “decline[s] to hold\nthat a school‟s alleged failure to enforce a disciplinary code is\nequivalent to an affirmative act.” Id. at 27. Precisely\nbecause, in choosing to ignore that mandate, the School\nofficials contributed to the danger the Morrows faced, we\nwould reach the opposite conclusion.\n\n                               C.\n\n       Like Kneipp, this case presents “unique facts,” 95 F.3d\nat 1208, that distinguish it from Middle Bucks and set it apart\nfrom the majority of state-created danger cases that we have\n\n21\n   One might also reasonably infer that the School officials\naffirmatively acted in a way that increased the danger to the\nMorrows by putting them and the bully in the same lunch\nroom or allowing the bully to board the Morrows‟ school bus\ndespite the fact that it did not serve her home route. See, e.g.,\nCompl. ¶ 18. The School argues that the incident on the\nschool bus cannot constitute the basis of liability because the\nMorrows were less restrained by the School when they were\non the bus. This argument confuses the physical restraint\ncomponent of the special relationship test with the state-\ncreated danger theory.\n\n\n\n\n                               32\n\fseen. In Middle Bucks, where the question was “extremely\nclose,” 972 F.2d at 1374, we held that, “[a]s in DeShaney,\n„the most that can be said of the state functionaries . . . is that\nthey stood by and did nothing when suspicious circumstances\ndictated a more active role for them.‟” Id. at 1376 (quoting\nDeShaney, 489 U.S. at 203). But the high school principal\nhere, Balaski, was not confronted with “suspicious\ncircumstances.” He was confronted with a student who had\nbeen charged with assault and making terroristic threats and\nharassment, had been adjudicated a delinquent, had\nrepeatedly attacked the Morrows over the course of several\nmonths, and had been the subject of two no-contact orders\nthat were delivered to the School.              And Balaski‟s\ndecisionmaking did not occur in a vacuum but instead\noperated under a Disciplinary Code and an Anti-Bullying\nPolicy that the School was required to adopt by the\nPennsylvania legislature. See supra note 20. In Middle\nBucks, we said that the defendants “did not subject plaintiffs\nto an inherently dangerous environment,” 972 F.2d at 1375,\nbut, here, Balaski‟s decision not to expel the bully\nunquestionably subjected the Morrows to an inherently\ndangerous environment. This is evidenced by his own\nstatement to the Morrows‟ parents that the school “could not\nguarantee the safety” of their daughters. Compl. ¶ 20. The\nMorrows should therefore be permitted to take their state-\ncreated danger cause of action past the pleadings stage.\n\nIII.   Conclusion\n\n       It has been suggested that the “elephant in the room”\nin cases of this nature is a desire by the federal courts to avoid\nbecoming the forum for all disputes involving everyday\nschoolyard quarrels. See, e.g., Middle Bucks, 972 F.3d at\n\n\n\n\n                                33\n\f1384 (Sloviter, C.J., dissenting); Oral Arg. Audio Tr. 26:39-\n27:08 (Ambro, J.). But there exist sufficient evidentiary and\nprocedural protections to assuage any concerns that a limited\nreview of Middle Bucks will open the floodgates to all school-\nrelated litigation. See Middle Bucks, 972 F.2d at 1384\n(Sloviter, C.J., dissenting). And to plead a plausible special\nrelationship cause of action, the student must clear another\nhurdle by pointing to other circumstances beyond the\nrestraints imposed ordinarily by compulsory schooling laws.\nRun-of-the-mill schoolyard fights, isolated or random acts of\nviolence, or matters where a school played no part in\nexacerbating the threat, would likely not be covered.\n\n       But regardless of the efficacy of these devices, we\nought not refuse to grant relief that is warranted simply to\nstem future litigation. While turning away the Morrows may\nbe convenient as a matter of management of judicial\nresources or as a matter of school policy, it is neither\nexpedient nor sound as a matter of constitutional law. The\nmajority avers that students and concerned parents may seek\nredress from their legislatures, but concedes that the law as it\nexists today, at least in Pennsylvania, immunizes schools\nfrom such suits. See Majority Op. at 25 (citing Auerbach v.\nCouncil Rock Sch.

To the detriment of schools‟ ability to\nmanage their own affairs, concerned parents could seek\ngreater control and awareness over the moment-to-moment\nsafety of their children, knowing that the school officials to\nwhom they entrust their children are under no legal obligation\nto protect them from harm. Some parents may even take\nunilateral acts to protect their children. See, e.g., Ryan\nRaiche, Parents of boy who brought butcher knife to school\nsay it was to defend himself from bullies, ABC Action News\nWFTS-TV, Jan. 14, 2013, http://shar.es/jEG8P. At worst,\nschools may be unwittingly encouraging the law of the jungle\nto be the reigning norm. We hope this is not the case.\n\n       It cannot be denied that schools both create and\nregulate the conditions to which students are subject during\nthe school day. When a State interrupts even temporarily the\n\n\nagainst school based on the Individuals with Disabilities\nEducation Act). Notably, the existence of alternative causes\nof action further undercuts implicit reliance on a desire to\nshield school officials from suits as a reason to depart from\nsound constitutional principles. Bullying-related suits will\ncontinue as long as the issue is in the public eye regardless of\ntoday‟s decision.\n\n\n\n\n                              35\n\fprovision of care by a parent to a child, steps into the shoes of\nthat parent, and restricts the ability of the child to defend\nherself from a specific threat, the State ought to be seen as\nincurring a narrow, concomitant responsibility to act as one\nwould expect the child‟s parents to act: to protect the child\nfrom that danger. The School‟s explicit refusal to do so\nshould give us more pause than it does today. Moreover,\nwhen a school official chooses not to remove a student who\nhas committed violent acts against another student, despite\npolicies that call for such removal, that official has surely\nplaced the victim in a worse position than if the disciplinary\npolicy had run its ordinary course. And when a school\ncreates an atmosphere in which serious violence is tolerated\nand brings no consequence, it acts in a manner that renders all\nstudents more vulnerable.\n\n       We respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                               36\n\fNygaard, Circuit Judge, dissenting.\n\n       More than twenty years ago, we took up the troubling\nappeal of two female high school students who had been\nsexually assaulted by seven male students in a classroom,\nduring a graphic arts class. See D.R. v. Middle Bucks Area\nVocational Technical School, et al., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"589625\"><a href=\"/opinion/589625/dr-a-minor-child-by-her-parent-and-natural-guardian-lr-and-lr/\"><span class=\"volume\">972</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1364</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1366 (3d\nCir. 1992).
