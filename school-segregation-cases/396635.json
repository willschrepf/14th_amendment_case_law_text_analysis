Yancey, Valdosta, Ga., for defendants-appellees.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appeal from the United States District Court for the Middle District of Georgia.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before AINSWORTH, GODBOLD and HILL, Circuit Judges.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PER CURIAM:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case our concern is with the existence of several virtually one-race elementary schools in a system that is otherwise fully desegregated.  The district court found that Valdosta's schools had achieved unitary status, and denied the United States' motion for supplemental relief.  We vacate and remand for further consideration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A desegregation order for the Valdosta, Georgia school system was issued in 1971.  Valdosta has complied with this plan, and has in large part successfully eradicated the dual school system that existed prior to 1971.  Nevertheless, implementation of the plan has resulted in the continued existence of several racially identifiable elementary schools.  This court has due regard for the success of the Valdosta school board in abolishing the vestiges of the dual system at the junior and senior high school levels.  We acknowledge that \"the existence of some small number of . . .  virtually one-race schools . . .  is not in and of itself the mark of a system that still practices segregation by law.\"  Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 402 U.S. 1, 26, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 1281, 28 L.Ed.2d 554 (1971).  Yet we cannot conclude that Valdosta has fully eliminated its dual school system.  In evaluating this appeal we look to the law of school desegregation as currently understood in this Circuit.  See Dandridge v. Jefferson Parish School Bd., 5 Cir., 456 F.2d 552, 554, cert. denied, 409 U.S. 978, 93 S.Ct. 306, 34 L.Ed.2d 240 (1972).  The critical issue here is whether a unitary system has been achieved at any time subsequent to the imposition of the desegregation order.  Thus, this case is not comparable to the situation in Pasadena City Bd. of Educ. v. Spangler, 427 U.S. 424, 96 S.Ct. 2697, 49 L.Ed.2d 599 (1976), where a unitary system already had been achieved, and the racial concentrations were the result of demographic changes rather than the actions of the school board.

Fifty-five percent of Valdosta's elementary school population is black, and 80% of those black students attend schools that are over 90% black West Gordon, Lomax, and Southeast elementary schools.
