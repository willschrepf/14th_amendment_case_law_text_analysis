We vacate the district court’s order granting attorney\n\nfees and render judgment reducing the amount of the fee award.\n\n                            I.   BACKGROUND\n\n     Houston Independent School District teacher Barbara Coleman\n\nsued HISD, district superintendent Andre Hornsby, Ryan Middle\n\nSchool principal Anita Ellis, and Jones High School principal\n\n\n     *\n          Pursuant to 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the Court has determined\nthat this opinion should not be published and is not precedent\nexcept under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH CIR. R.\n47.5.4.\n\fParlee Crawford, alleging that she was denied a position as an\n\nassistant principal at both Ryan Middle School and Jones High\n\nSchool because she is white, in violation of the Equal Protection\n\nClause and 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981, 1983 and 1985.            Coleman’s theory of\n\nthe case was that HISD was exercising a racial preference in favor\n\nof Hispanic administrators.\n\n     Coleman’s   complaint       identified    two   separate   incidents    of\n\nintentional discrimination; she named HISD, Hornsby, and Ellis with\n\nrespect to the district’s failure to give her a position as the\n\nassistant principal of Ryan Middle School, and named HISD, Hornsby,\n\nand Crawford with respect to the district’s failure to give her a\n\nposition as an assistant principal at Jones High School.                  After\n\nsubstantial   discovery    and    several     motions   hearings,     defendant\n\nCrawford was granted qualified immunity.             Defendant Hornsby was\n\nalso granted qualified immunity, but only as to Coleman’s claims\n\nthat she was denied an assistant principal position at Jones High\n\nSchool.   Defendants      Hornsby    and    Ellis    were   denied    qualified\n\nimmunity with respect to Coleman’s claims that she was denied a\n\nposition at Ryan Middle School.\n\n     Defendant   Ellis,    but    not   Hornsby,     appealed   the    district\n\ncourt’s denial of qualified immunity to this Court, which resulted\n\nin a published opinion reversing the district court’s denial of\n\nqualified immunity on narrow legal grounds. See Coleman v. City of\n\nHouston, 113 F.3d 528, 534-35 (5th Cir. 1997).                  We did not,\n\nhowever, render judgment granting Ellis qualified immunity. To the\n\ncontrary, the Court expressly left open the question of whether\n\n\n                                        2\n\fother grounds might exist for denying qualified immunity on remand.\n\nId. The district court did not dismiss the claims against Ellis on\n\nremand, and those claims remained in the suit, along with Coleman’s\n\nclaims against HISD and Coleman’s claims that Hornsby discriminated\n\nagainst her with respect to an assistant principal position at Ryan\n\nMiddle School.\n\n       Coleman then settled the case.    The settlement afforded\n\nColeman: (1) a permanent administrative position as an assistant\n\nprincipal; (2) an administrator’s contract that would qualify her\n\nfor further promotions; and (3) compensation in the form of back\n\npay for the time period during which she was denied a promotion.\n\nThe settlement did not otherwise provide for the recovery of\n\ncompensatory or punitive damages.\n\n       The parties were unable to agree on the amount of attorney\n\nfees that Coleman was entitled to recover as the “prevailing\n\nparty,” see 42 U.S.C. § 1988, and Coleman filed a petition for fees\n\nand costs in the district court in March 1998.   At that time, the\n\ncase had been pending for almost three years.    Coleman requested\n\n$159,597.75 in attorney and support staff fees and $4,947.43 in\n\ncosts.2\n\n       Coleman’s request included attorney fees in the amount of\n\n   2\n          Coleman’s initial fee request actually requested $107,131\nin attorney fees, to be enhanced by a 1.5 multiplier for a total of\n$160,696.50 in attorney fees. The figures in the original petition\nwere based upon an erroneous calculation of the total number of\nhours set forth in the supporting documentation. Coleman later\nsubmitted a page correcting the number of hours and total amount of\nbilled fees to $ 106,398.59. Coleman did not, however, correct the\ntotal request to reflect the lower figure of $159,597.75 after the\nmultiplier was applied.\n\n                                 3\n\f$85,962.50, including $73,062.50 for the services of partners\n\nStuart     and     Carol    Nelkin       (calculated         as    208.75    hours     at\n\n$350.00/hour), $9,350 for the services of first-year associate\n\nKenneth Krock (calculated as 46.75 hours at $200.00/hour), and\n\n$3,550     for    the   services    of    an     unidentified       associate,    “MFH”\n\n(calculated       as    17.75    hours    at     $200.00/hour).         Coleman      also\n\nrequested        $19,900   for    the     work    of    four      para-professionals,\n\nincluding $12,700 for work done by law clerk Kenneth Krock before\n\nhe passed the bar exam (calculated as 158.75 hours at $80.00/hour),\n\n$5,500 for the work of paralegal “EBB” (calculated as 68.75 hours\n\nat $80.00), $960 for the work of paralegal “WSL” (calculated as 12\n\nhours at $80.00/hour), and $740 for the work of paralegal “CLC”\n\n(calculated as 9.25 hours at $80.00).                  As a final element, Coleman\n\nrequested $536 for the overtime services of certain clerical staff.\n\nColeman also argued that applicable precedent justified application\n\nof a 1.5 multiplier as an enhancement to the requested lodestar\n\namount of $106,398.50, for a total fee request of $159,597.75, plus\n\nthe $4,947.43 in costs and expenses.\n\n      The defendants responded with lengthy and specific objections\n\nto   the   fee     petition.       With    respect      to   the    number   of   hours\n\nreasonably expended, the defendants argued that the district court\n\nshould exclude from any fee award: (1) hours expended on, or with\n\ncertain limited exceptions, during the prior Fifth Circuit appeal;\n\n(2) duplicative hours billed by a law clerk for attending, rather\n\nthan conducting or participating in, depositions; (3) duplicative\n\nhours billed by Stuart Nelkin for certain client communications;\n\n\n                                            4\n\f(4) unnecessary hours spent discussing unrelated or tangentially\n\nrelated issues     with   the    Texas       Comptroller    or    the     press;     (5)\n\nunnecessary hours billed for “legal research” before the first\n\npretrial   conference;     (6)     excessive       hours        billed    as    client\n\ncommunications; (7) unjustified separate billings for clerical\n\nstaff overtime; and (8) several hours billed by paralegal staff at\n\n$80.00/hour for “filing documents.” With respect to the reasonable\n\nhourly rate for participating attorneys, the defendants argued that\n\nthe Nelkins’ $350.00/hour rate was excessive, even for well-\n\nqualified lawyers experienced in the civil rights area.                              The\n\ndefendants further argued that the $200.00/hour rate billed by the\n\nnewly-graduated,     first-year     associate       Kenneth        Krock       and   the\n\nunidentified “MFH” was excessive.\n\n     Following   a   brief      contested      hearing     on    the     matter,     the\n\ndistrict court awarded Coleman $107,000 in attorney and support\n\nstaff fees and $4,947.43 in costs.             The district court’s award of\n\nattorney fees approximated the total number of hours requested at\n\nthe hourly rates submitted,3 but reduced Coleman’s $159,597.75\n\nrequest by refusing to allow the requested 1.5 multiplier.\n\n     HISD and the individual defendants appeal.                    The defendants\n\nconcede Coleman is entitled to recover some attorney fees, but\n\nargue by way of various categorical and specific challenges that\n\n\n     3\n          Coleman’s corrected request, excluding any multiplier,\nwas in the amount of $106,398.50, plus $4,947.43 in costs, for a\ntotal of $111,345.93. The record does not reflect, either in the\nrelevant pleadings or in the transcript of the hearing on attorney\nfees, how the district court reached the final award figure of\n$107,000 plus costs.\n\n                                         5\n\fthe award of attorney and support staff fees should be reduced to\n\n$20,959.50.     Defendants make no challenge to the amount of costs\n\nawarded, and Coleman has not cross-appealed the district court’s\n\nrefusal to apply a 1.5 multiplier to enhance the amount of billed\n\nfees.   Having reviewed Coleman’s fee petition in light of the\n\nrecord and the applicable precedent, we conclude that the district\n\ncourt either ignored or failed to adequately address certain merit-\n\nworthy objections raised by the defendants when making the award of\n\nattorney fees.     We therefore vacate the district court’s order\n\ngranting Coleman $107,000 in attorney fees plus $4,947.43 in costs\n\nand render judgment reducing the award of fees as set forth in this\n\nopinion.\n\n\n\n                   II.   APPLICABLE LEGAL PRINCIPLES\n\n     This Circuit has defined a two-step process for determining\n\n“reasonable” attorney fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988.     First,\n\nthe district court must calculate a lodestar fee, which is the\n\nproduct of the number of hours reasonably expended on the case and\n\nthe hourly rate that is reasonable for the participating lawyers.\n\nSee Migis v. Pearle Vision, Inc., 135 F.3d 1041, 1047 (5th Cir.\n\n1998). The lodestar determination is not mechanistic, and the\n\ndistrict court’s determination of the lodestar amount should not be\n\nguided solely by the billing records or the rates requested in the\n\nfee petition.    See, e.g., Hensley v. Eckerhart, 103 S. Ct. 1933,\n\n1939-40 (1983); Abrams v. Baylor College of Medicine, 805 F.2d 528,\n\n536 (5th Cir. 1986).      Rather, the district court is required to\n\n\n                                   6\n\fidentify from the fee petition those hours that were “reasonably”\n\nexpended on the litigation.        When making that determination, the\n\ndistrict court is obligated to scrutinize the billing records\n\ncarefully and to exclude excessive, duplicative, or otherwise\n\nunnecessary entries.        See City of Riverside v. Rivera, 106 S. Ct.\n\n2686, 2691 (1986); Hensley, 103 S. Ct. at 1939; Abrams, 805 F.2d at\n\n536.    The district court should also consider whether the work\n\nperformed was “‘legal work in the strict sense,’ or was merely\n\nclerical work that happened to be performed by a lawyer.”                 Abrams,\n\n805 F.2d at 536 (quoting Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc.,\n\n488 F.2d 714, 717 (5th Cir. 1974)).\n\n       Similarly, the district court must determine reasonable hourly\n\nrates for the billing attorneys or paralegals. A reasonable hourly\n\nrate is determined with reference to the prevailing market rate in\n\nthe relevant legal community for similar work.               See Leroy v. City\n\nof Houston, 906 F.2d 1068, 1079 (5th Cir. 1990).               While the hourly\n\nrate must be “adequate to attract competent counsel,” the “measure\n\nis not the rates which lions at the bar may command.”                         Id.\n\n(internal    quotations     omitted).       The     burden   of    demonstrating\n\nreasonableness is on the fee applicant.              See id.      Factual deter-\n\nminations relating to the number of hours reasonably expended and\n\nthe reasonable hourly rate are reviewed for clear error.                      See\n\nMigis, 135 F.3d at 1047.\n\n       In the second step, the district court must consider whether\n\nthe    circumstances   of    the   case     merit    an   upward    or   downward\n\nadjustment of the lodestar amount.          That determination is informed\n\n\n                                        7\n\fby a consideration of the twelve factors defined in Johnson v.\n\nGeorgia Highway Express, Inc., 488 F.2d 714, 717 (5th Cir. 1974).\n\nThose factors are: (1) the time and labor required; (2) the novelty\n\nand difficulty of the legal issues; (3) the skill required to\n\nperform the legal service properly; (4) the preclusion of other\n\nemployment by the attorney as a result of taking the case; (5) the\n\ncustomary fee; (6) whether the fee is fixed or contingent; (7) time\n\nlimitations imposed by the client or other circumstances; (8) the\n\nmonetary   amount   involved   and    the   results   obtained;   (9)   the\n\nexperience, reputation, and ability of the attorneys; (10) whether\n\nthe case is undesirable; (11) the nature and duration of the\n\nprofessional relationship with the client; and (12) awards in\n\nsimilar cases.      See, e.g., Rivera, 106 S. Ct. at 2691 n.3.          The\n\nJohnson factors are favorably cited in both the House and Senate\n\nReports accompanying 42 U.S.C. § 1988, and have likewise been\n\nadopted by the Supreme Court.        See, e.g., id. at 2691.\n\n     The Johnson factors are more than just a laundry list of\n\nfactors to be systematically passed upon once a determination of\n\nthe lodestar amount is made.         Indeed, this Court has emphasized\n\nthat the Johnson factors are relevant to and may often “govern the\n\ndetermination of reasonableness itself.”        Abrams, 805 F.2d at 536.\n\nThe district court’s application of the Johnson factors, its\n\ndecision whether to depart from the lodestar amount, and thus, the\n\nultimate fee award, are reviewed for an abuse of discretion.            See\n\nMigis, 135 F.3d at 1047; Louisiana Power & Light Co. v. Kellstrom,\n\n50 F.3d 319, 329 (5th Cir. 1995).\n\n\n                                     8\n\f     In this appeal, the defendants challenge the district court’s\n\ndetermination of the reasonable number of hours expended and its\n\nfinal determination that the fee request was reasonable.\n\n\n\n                  III.    THE REASONABLE NUMBER OF HOURS\n\n     The district court did not enter an order addressing the\n\ndefendant’s specific objections to Coleman’s fee petition, and the\n\ntranscript of the brief hearing in the district court provides the\n\nonly discussion of the district court’s reasoning.                 The district\n\ncourt   first    held    that   Coleman    was   a   “prevailing    party”   and\n\ntherefore entitled to attorney fees.             See 42 U.S.C. § 1988.       The\n\ndefendants do not directly challenge that finding on appeal.                 The\n\ndistrict court then rejected any approach that would require a\n\nsegregation of successful arguments as opposed to unsuccessful\n\narguments for the purpose of parsing the fee award.                 Using that\n\nrationale,      the     district   court    addressed     and   rejected     the\n\ndefendants’ argument that Coleman should not recover for hours that\n\nwere billed for or during defendant Ellis’ appeal from the district\n\ncourt’s order denying qualified immunity.             The district court did\n\nnot otherwise address the defendants’ specific challenges to the\n\nnumber of hours reasonably expended on the litigation.\n\n\n\nA.   The Prior Appeal\n\n     On appeal, the defendants argue that Coleman should not\n\nrecover for any hours expended on the Fifth Circuit appeal, which\n\nthe defendants say Coleman “lost,” and defendant Ellis “won.”\n\n\n                                       9\n\f     As an initial matter, we note that Ellis did not unambiguously\n\n“win” the appeal.    While it is true that this Court reversed the\n\ndistrict court’s order denying summary judgment, our prior opinion\n\nis narrowly drafted to find error with the assumption used by the\n\ndistrict court to deny qualified immunity; that is, that Ellis\n\nmight   still   be   liable   to    Coleman    even     if   Ellis   did   not\n\nintentionally    discriminate      against    Coleman    because     Hornsby’s\n\ndiscriminatory intent, if any, could be imputed to Ellis.                  See\n\nColeman, 113 F.3d at 535 (“[W]e emphasize that our decision in this\n\ninterlocutory appeal is limited to the narrow legal proposition\n\nthat a district court may not impute the alleged discriminatory\n\nmotivations of a superior to a subordinate for purposes of the\n\nqualified immunity analysis.”).           The opinion does not render\n\njudgment that Ellis is entitled to qualified immunity, and in fact,\n\nexpressly leaves open the question of whether an order denying\n\nqualified immunity might otherwise be appropriate, stating:\n\n          [W]e express no opinion as to whether the court\n          erred in assuming that Ellis did not intentionally\n          discriminate against Coleman; nor do we consider\n          whether a genuine issue of material fact exists\n          concerning   the   allegations    of   intentional\n          discrimination on the part of Ellis. On remand,\n          the district court is free to entertain this\n          alternate ground for denying qualified immunity.\n\nId. (footnote omitted).\n\n     On remand, Ellis did not seek, and was not granted, dismissal\n\nfrom the case in her individual capacity.         Thus, Coleman’s claims\n\nagainst Ellis were live claims at the time the parties reached\n\nsettlement.     Indeed, Coleman’s claims against HISD, Ellis, and\n\nHornsby as to the Ryan Middle School position were the only live\n\n                                     10\n\fclaims remaining to be settled when the parties agreed to settle\n\nthe case.   Crawford and Hornsby had already been granted qualified\n\nimmunity as to Coleman’s claims relating to the Jones High School\n\nposition.      The   defendants’   argument   that   the   appeal   was   an\n\nunqualified success for their side is without merit.          Thus, it is\n\nreasonable to say, on the force of the settlement, that Coleman\n\n“prevailed” in her claims against Ellis.\n\n     Moreover, there is ample authority for the proposition that a\n\npartially prevailing party may recover all reasonably incurred\n\nattorney fees, even though the party did not prevail on all claims,\n\nas to all defendants, or as to all issues in a matter.         See, e.g.,\n\nHensley, 103 S. Ct. at 1940 (1983); Kellstrom, 50 F.3d at 327; Cobb\n\nv. Miller, 818 F.2d 1227, 1233 (5th Cir. 1987).       When the plaintiff\n\nhas prevailed as to some claims, and failed as to others, the key\n\nis whether the successful and unsuccessful claims are based upon\n\nthe same facts and legal theories, i.e. whether the claims are\n\nrelated. See Hensley, 103 S. Ct. at 1940.       When the successful and\n\nunsuccessful claims involve a “common core of facts” or are based\n\nupon “related legal theories,” then attorney fees incurred in the\n\npresentation of unsuccessful claims are recoverable on the theory\n\nthat they contributed to the plaintiff’s ultimate success.                Id.\n\nSimilarly, a prevailing party may not recover for hours devoted\n\nsolely to claims against defendants as to whom the plaintiff did\n\nnot prevail.     See Kellstrom, 50 F.3d at 327.        “But when claims\n\nagainst multiple parties share a common core of facts or related\n\nlegal theories, a fee applicant may claim all hours reasonably\n\n\n                                    11\n\fnecessary to litigate those issues.” Id. (internal quotations\n\nomitted).\n\n      In this case, Coleman named HISD, Hornsby, and Ellis in her\n\nclaim that she was denied a position at Ryan Middle School.\n\nAlthough Ellis appealed the district court’s denial of qualified\n\nimmunity from suit, she was never granted qualified immunity or\n\notherwise dismissed from the suit prior to settlement of the claims\n\nagainst her.    Thus, the claims against Ellis at the time of appeal\n\nand the claims ultimately settled in Coleman’s favor are identical.\n\nWe   conclude   that   the   district   court   did   not   clearly   err   by\n\nincluding as a category certain hours billed as a consequence of\n\nEllis’ prior appeal on the issue of qualified immunity.\n\n      Neither did the district court clearly err by including time\n\nbilled during the pendency of the appeal.             The defendants argue\n\nthat Coleman should not be able to recover for hours billed while\n\nthe appeal was pending because the case was stayed in the district\n\ncourt between March 29, 1996 and May 19, 1997, when this Court\n\nissued its opinion in Coleman.\n\n      We disagree. Ellis appealed in April 1996. Although the case\n\nwas later closed for statistical purposes in July 1996, Coleman\n\nfiled a motion for leave to amend her pleadings, together with an\n\namended complaint, while the appeal was pending in January 1997.\n\nMoreover, Coleman’s attorneys were also pursuing an EEOC right to\n\nsue letter while the appeal was pending.\n\n      Defendants acknowledge that Coleman was continuing work on an\n\namended complaint and the EEOC right to sue letter, and do not\n\n\n                                    12\n\fargue that the time billed for those activities should be excluded\n\nfrom Coleman’s recovery.        Rather, the defendants argue that time\n\nnot clearly tied to either the Fifth Circuit appeal, the amended\n\ncomplaint, or the EEOC right to sue letter should be excluded.\n\n     Having conducted an independent review of the billing records,\n\nwe are able to find only 20 otherwise recoverable attorney hours\n\n(11.75 billed by Stuart Nelkin at $350.00 and 8.25 billed by\n\nKenneth Krock at $200.00/hour), and 6.5 otherwise recoverable\n\nsupport staff hours (all billed by Kenneth Krock before he was\n\nadmitted to the bar) that fall within this category.            Most of these\n\nhours    are   billed     for   either    meeting     with   or    reviewing\n\ncorrespondence from Coleman or opposing counsel.             Many of these\n\nhours are clustered around significant events occurring in the\n\nappeal, such as the designation of the appellate record, the filing\n\nof the appellate briefs, and oral argument.            While more detailed\n\nentries specifying the reason for certain calls or meetings would\n\ncertainly have been desirable, we cannot, on the basis of this\n\nrecord, conclude that the district court erred by including these\n\nhours as a category of recoverable time.\n\n     For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the district court did\n\nnot clearly    err   by   refusing   to   reduce    Coleman’s    request   for\n\nattorney and support staff fees by excluding hours billed as a\n\nconsequence of, or during the prior appeal of this case to our\n\nCourt.\n\n\n\nB.   Duplicative and Unnecessary Entries\n\n\n                                     13\n\f     Defendants argue that Coleman should not be permitted to\n\nrecover attorney fees for hours that law clerk Kenneth Krock spent\n\nattending, rather than participating in, or conducting depositions.\n\nThe billing records reflect that Krock spent at least 17 hours\n\nattending depositions conducted by one of the Nelkins.               Krock also\n\nbilled     an   additional    six     hours     preparation   time    for   the\n\ndepositions. The defendants challenge this time as duplicative and\n\nunnecessary.\n\n     We agree.       Coleman does not contend that Krock actively\n\nparticipated, even in a supporting role, during the deposition.\n\n“[H]ours spent in duplicative activity or spent in the passive role\n\nof an observer while other attorneys perform[]” is generally not\n\nrecoverable.     Flowers v. Wiley, 675 F.2d 704, 705 (5th Cir. 1982).\n\nWe conclude that the 17 hours billed as observation time should\n\nhave been excluded from the determination of reasonable hours by\n\nthe district court.        That principle does not, however, require\n\nexclusion of Krock’s preparation time, which could have been\n\nlegitimately incurred preparing materials for the partner’s use.\n\n     For the foregoing reasons, the number of hours submitted for\n\nthe work of law clerk Krock will be reduced by 17 hours in the\n\nfinal fee award.\n\n     Defendants     also     object    to     certain   facially   duplicative\n\nentries.    For example, defendants challenge Stuart Nelkins’ dual\n\nentries for client meetings on January 31, 1996, and for reading a\n\nclient letter on May 22, 1996.        Having reviewed the record, and the\n\narguments of the parties, we agree that these entries are suspect.\n\n\n                                       14\n\fA total of one hour will be deducted from the total number of hours\n\nbilled by Stuart Nelkin to account for these duplications.\n\n     Defendants also challenge an August 14, 1995 entry for 4.5\n\nhours of “legal research” performed by law clerk Kenneth Krock.\n\nDefendants argue the research was unnecessary, and alternatively,\n\nthat the entry is too vague to support recovery.\n\n     We disagree.   There is nothing patently unreasonable about\n\nconducting preliminary research on a case once it is initiated.         In\n\naddition, we have declined to find clear error when an award was\n\npremised upon similar entries.    See Kellstrom, 50 F.3d at 327.       The\n\ndistrict court’s inclusion of the 4.5 hours billed by Kenneth Krock\n\non August 14, 1995 was not clearly erroneous.\n\n     Defendants also challenge the district court’s decision to\n\npermit Coleman to recover for hours expended on what they claim are\n\nunrelated matters. When investigating this case, Coleman’s lawyers\n\ndiscovered that a Hispanic group had filed suit against HISD\n\nalleging system-wide discrimination.       Coleman’s position in this\n\nlitigation was that HISD inappropriately responded to that suit and\n\npolitical pressure by exercising a racial preference in favor of\n\nHispanics.   Defendants object to several hours billed to research\n\nnews articles and to obtain videotape records of the Hispanic\n\ncommunity’s protests against HISD.\n\n     Coleman’s counsel also learned that the Texas Comptroller was\n\nconducting an audit of HISD, including their hiring and promotion\n\npolicies.    Counsel   claims    that   they   were   contacted   by   the\n\nComptroller for information about Coleman’s case and decided to\n\n\n                                  15\n\fcooperate because they thought any resulting report would be\n\nbeneficial to her case.        Defendants object to several hours billed\n\nfor conversations with the Texas Comptroller and for making copies\n\nfor the Comptroller.\n\n      Defendants argue that none of this time is recoverable because\n\nit was not spent “on the litigation” of the matter, citing several\n\ndistrict court cases, including Watkins v. Fordice, 807 F. Supp.\n\n406   (S.D.   Miss.    1992)   (holding        that     “plaintiffs'      attorneys'\n\nlegislative lobbying work and their work relating to the Justice\n\nDepartment's review of the State's Section 5 submission were not\n\n‘necessary’ to advance the litigation.”). The cited cases prohibit\n\nrecovery for tangentially related investigation that benefits or\n\nmay   benefit   the    attorney      in   more    than    one   case.      There    is\n\nundoubtedly     a   fine    line    between      necessary      investigation      and\n\nunjustified over billing.           But counsel’s investigation of the suit\n\nby Hispanics against HISD was clearly related to her theory that\n\nHISD was systematically favoring Hispanic administrators.                      There\n\nis, therefore, no error in the district court’s decision to include\n\nthe   relatively      few   hours    at   issue    as    part    of   a   reasonable\n\ninvestigation of Coleman’s claims.\n\n\n\nC.    Client Communications\n\n      Defendants also argue that Coleman’s attorneys billed an\n\nexcessive amount of time for client communications.                        Coleman’s\n\ncounsel billed approximately 66 hours for activities that can be\n\ncharacterized as client communications, such as meetings, telephone\n\n\n                                          16\n\fcalls,   and    either   preparing   correspondence    to   or   reviewing\n\ncorrespondence from the client.4      Defendants note that Coleman was\n\nnot deposed and that she was not asked to respond to any written\n\ndiscovery.     They therefore suspect that counsel was merely holding\n\nColeman’s hand and request that the time be reduced by fifty\n\npercent.     Defendants are particularly perturbed by the lengthy\n\nphone calls and meetings because they believe many occurred during\n\nnormal working hours when HISD was already paying Coleman to work.\n\n     We consider this a very close issue.      Attorneys are required\n\nto exercise sound billing judgment, see Hensley, 103 S. Ct. at\n\n1939-40, and the inclusion in this case of a large number of hours\n\nfor client communications, without any elaboration with respect to\n\nthe purpose or aim of the communication, and without any mention of\n\nthe objective to be sought with respect to such communication, is\n\nsufficient to call the judgment of the billing attorneys into\n\nquestion.      On the other hand, we note that many of the client\n\ncommunications billed in this case can be tied to significant\n\nevents in the litigation.     To the extent that client communication\n\nbecame excessive when the need arose, we note that only about one-\n\nthird of the hours billed as client communications were billed by\n\na partner at the higher $350.00/hour rate.            Most of the hours\n\nbilled as client communications were in fact billed by support\n\nstaff rather than by attorneys.\n\n\n     4\n          As   noted   in the defendants’ briefs, an exact\ndetermination of the time spent on client communication is not\npossible because entries containing multiple tasks are not\nsegregated.\n\n                                     17\n\f     It may well be that Coleman was more demanding than good\n\nbilling judgment allows.       In any event, this case comes about as\n\nclose to the boundary between justifiable client communication and\n\nindulgent over billing as we can imagine.            Nonetheless, we are\n\nultimately persuaded by the deferential standard of review that we\n\nare not able, on the basis of this record, to second-guess the\n\ndistrict court’s judgment.      While we may disagree with respect to\n\nthe permissible number of hours that should have been expended\n\ncommunicating with Ms. Coleman, we are not able to say that the\n\ndistrict court’s determination of the reasonable number of hours in\n\nthis regard is clearly erroneous.        Likewise, we are not able to say\n\nthat the district court’s refusal to reduce the number of hours\n\nreasonably   requested   was   an   abuse   of   discretion.   For   these\n\nreasons, we conclude that the district court’s refusal to reduce\n\nthe number of hours billed as client communications is not clearly\n\nerroneous.\n\n\n\nD.   Clerical Overtime\n\n     Defendants challenge 23.25 hours billed by clerical staff.\n\nAll of this time was billed as overtime.          Defendants argue that,\n\nwithout regard to the issue of whether clerical staff time can ever\n\nbe separately billed, there is no factual or legal justification\n\nfor permitting the Nelkins’ office staff to be compensated for\n\novertime.    Neither the fee petition nor the briefs explain why\n\novertime was necessary.    In addition, the district court expressly\n\nnoted, as part of its Johnson analysis, that there were no unusual\n\n\n                                    18\n\ftime restrictions in the case.\n\n     We agree.    The 23.25 hours billed as clerical staff overtime\n\nwill be deducted from the total number of compensable hours.   Our\n\nholding in this regard eliminates the need to address whether the\n\nhourly rates requested for those staff members were reasonable.\n\n\n\nE.   Clerical Work Performed by a Paralegal\n\n     Finally, the defendants raise certain objections to hours\n\nbilled by paralegal “WSL” at $80.00/hour for “filing documents.”\n\nParalegal expense is recoverable only to the extent that the work\n\nperformed is similar to that typically performed by lawyers. Allen\n\nv. United States Steel Corp., 665 F.2d 689, 697 (5th Cir. Unit B\n\n1982).    Otherwise, paralegal expense is an unrecoverable overhead\n\nexpense. See id. “Of course, purely clerical or secretarial tasks\n\nshould not be billed at a paralegal rate, regardless of who\n\nperforms them.”    Missouri v. Jenkins, 109 S. Ct. 2463, 2472 n.10\n\n(1989).\n\n     Neither the record nor applicable precedent supports the use\n\nof a relatively expensive paralegal to file documents.     The 3.5\n\nhours billed by paralegal “WSL” for “filing documents” will be\n\ndeducted from the total number of hours in the fee petition.\n\n     On the basis of the foregoing analysis the district court’s\n\ndetermination of the number of hours reasonably billed will be\n\nreduced as follows: Stuart Nelkin’s hours will be reduced from 194\n\nto 191; Carol Nelkin’s hours will remain the same at 14.75 hours;\n\nKenneth Krock’s hours as an attorney will remain the same at 46.75\n\n\n                                 19\n\fhours; “MFH”’s hours will remain the same at 17.75 hours; Kenneth\n\nKrock’s hours as a law clerk will be reduced from 158.75 to 141.75;\n\nparalegal “WSL”’s hours will be reduced from 12 to 8.5; paralegal\n\n“EBB”’s hours will remain the same at 68.75; paralegal “CLC”’s\n\nhours will remain the same at 9.25; and the 23.25 hours billed as\n\nclerical overtime will be deleted entirely.\n\n\n\n                         IV.   THE REASONABLE HOURLY RATE\n\n     We must next consider the district court’s determination that\n\nthe hourly rates requested by Coleman’s counsel were reasonable.\n\nColeman requested that partners be compensated at the rate of\n\n$350.00/hour, that associate attorneys be compensated at the rate\n\nof $200.00/hour, and that the law clerk and the paralegals be\n\ncompensated at the rate of $80.00/hour.                   Defendants objected to\n\nthese   rates,     submitting       evidence   that   the    maximum       reasonable\n\nbilling     rate     for       an   experienced    partner       would     be   about\n\n$240.00/hour, while relatively new associates should be billed at\n\nonly $125.00/hour.             The district court held that the highest\n\nreasonable hourly rate would ordinarily be $250.00, but that\n\n“because    of     the    contingency,”      the   rate    of    $350.00/hour      for\n\npartners,    with        similar    upward   adjustments        in   the   rates   for\n\nassociates and paralegals, was justified.\n\n     Based upon our review of the record, we agree with the\n\ndistrict court that the reasonable hourly rates in this case are\n\nmuch lower than those requested by Coleman.                          In our view, a\n\nreasonable hourly rate for similar work in the relevant legal\n\n\n                                          20\n\fmarket would place partner compensation at $250.00/hour, associate\n\ncompensation for Kenneth Krock and “MFH” at $125.00/hour, and law\n\nclerk and paralegal compensation at $65.00/hour. We likewise agree\n\nwith the district court that some upward adjustment for contingency\n\nis appropriate.   Coleman presented evidence that the complexity of\n\ncivil rights litigation and the delay attending payment of the fees\n\nin   civil   rights   litigation     potentially    deters   accomplished\n\npractitioners from accepting such cases on a contingent fee basis.\n\nColeman claimed in the district court, and again on appeal, that\n\nwhile she initially agreed to pay her attorney fees, the payment of\n\nfees became, at some point, contingent upon a successful outcome.\n\nWhile the terms of any contract engaging the attorneys’ services is\n\nnot determinative with respect to the reasonable hourly rate that\n\nmay be used to calculate a lodestar amount, we agree with Coleman\n\nthat the inherent risk of loss and the lengthy delay in recovering\n\nattorney fees are material to our determination of a reasonable\n\nhourly rate.    See Blanchard v. Bergeron, 109 S. Ct. 939, 944-46\n\n(1989).\n\n     All things considered, however, and with due consideration of\n\nthe record evidence, we conclude that those factors justify a more\n\nmodest increase for partner compensation from $250.00/hour to\n\n$275.00/hour,   in    associate    compensation    from   $125.00/hour   to\n\n$137.00/hour, and in law clerk and paralegal compensation from\n\n$65.00/hour to $72.00/hour.       The district court’s decision setting\n\nthe reasonable hourly rates much higher because of a \"contingency\n\nfactor\" was clearly erroneous.        The lodestar calculation carried\n\n\n                                     21\n\fout below will be based upon those rates.\n\n\n\n             V.   Overall Reasonableness under Johnson\n\n     Defendants also make several challenges to the overall award\n\non the basis of the Johnson factors.    The most critical Johnson\n\nfactor is the degree of success obtained.   See Hensley, 103 S. Ct.\n\nat 1941. Defendants maintain that Coleman’s recovery was minute in\n\ncomparison to what she sought.\n\n     We disagree. The district court ordered HISD to place Coleman\n\nin an administrative position comparable in status and pay to an\n\nassistant principal position.    Coleman’s salary in that position\n\nwas more than $7,000 higher than her teacher salary.          At the\n\nconclusion of the suit, the settlement provided that Coleman would\n\nbe given such a position permanently.   Defendants also argue that\n\nColeman’s recovery of attorney fees is unreasonable because it is\n\ndisproportionate to her monetary recovery, citing Migis v. Pearle\n\nVision, Inc., 135 F.3d 1041 (5th Cir. 1998).\n\n     The Supreme Court has flatly rejected a bright-line rule that\n\nattorney fees under § 1988 must be proportionate to the damages\n\nrecovered.   See Rivera, 106 S. Ct. at 2697 (“We reject the\n\nproposition that fee awards under § 1988 should necessarily be\n\nproportionate to the amount of damages a civil rights plaintiff\n\nactually recovers.”).    Moreover, the extent of success is not\n\nmeasured solely by monetary damages.     See id. (“a civil rights\n\nplaintiff often secures important social benefits that are not\n\nreflected in nominal or relatively small damages awards.”).    Thus,\n\n\n                                 22\n\fwhile the amount of monetary damages recovered should be considered\n\nas one of the twelve Johnson factors, it should not be given\n\ndeterminative   effect   where   the   plaintiff   has   received   other\n\nmeaningful relief.\n\n     Coleman’s victory in this case was substantial enough to\n\nsupport the award of fees as modified by this opinion.        We find no\n\nabuse of discretion in the district court’s rejection of the\n\ndefendants’ arguments to the contrary.\n\n\n\n                             CONCLUSION\n\n     The district court’s award of attorney and support staff fees\n\nin the amount of $107,000, plus $4,947.43 in costs and expenses is\n\nVACATED and judgment is RENDERED granting Coleman attorney and\n\nsupport staff fees in the amount of $81,851.75, plus $4,947.43 in\n\ncosts and expenses.\n\n\n\n\n                                  23\n\f",

BACKGROUND\n\n     Houston Independent School District teacher Barbara Coleman\n\nsued HISD, district superintendent Andre Hornsby, Ryan Middle\n\nSchool principal Anita Ellis, and Jones High School principal\n\n\n     *\n          Pursuant to 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the Court has determined\nthat this opinion should not be published and is not precedent\nexcept under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH CIR. R.\n47.5.4.\n\fParlee Crawford, alleging that she was denied a position as an\n\nassistant principal at both Ryan Middle School and Jones High\n\nSchool because she is white, in violation of the Equal Protection\n\nClause and 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981, 1983 and 1985.            Coleman’s theory of\n\nthe case was that HISD was exercising a racial preference in favor\n\nof Hispanic administrators.\n\n     Coleman’s   complaint       identified    two   separate   incidents    of\n\nintentional discrimination; she named HISD, Hornsby, and Ellis with\n\nrespect to the district’s failure to give her a position as the\n\nassistant principal of Ryan Middle School, and named HISD, Hornsby,\n\nand Crawford with respect to the district’s failure to give her a\n\nposition as an assistant principal at Jones High School.                  After\n\nsubstantial   discovery    and    several     motions   hearings,     defendant\n\nCrawford was granted qualified immunity.             Defendant Hornsby was\n\nalso granted qualified immunity, but only as to Coleman’s claims\n\nthat she was denied an assistant principal position at Jones High\n\nSchool.   Defendants      Hornsby    and    Ellis    were   denied    qualified\n\nimmunity with respect to Coleman’s claims that she was denied a\n\nposition at Ryan Middle School.\n\n     Defendant   Ellis,    but    not   Hornsby,     appealed   the    district\n\ncourt’s denial of qualified immunity to this Court, which resulted\n\nin a published opinion reversing the district court’s denial of\n\nqualified immunity on narrow legal grounds.

We did not,\n\nhowever, render judgment granting Ellis qualified immunity. To the\n\ncontrary, the Court expressly left open the question of whether\n\n\n                                        2\n\fother grounds might exist for denying qualified immunity on remand.\n\nId. The district court did not dismiss the claims against Ellis on\n\nremand, and those claims remained in the suit, along with Coleman’s\n\nclaims against HISD and Coleman’s claims that Hornsby discriminated\n\nagainst her with respect to an assistant principal position at Ryan\n\nMiddle School.\n\n       Coleman then settled the case.    The settlement afforded\n\nColeman: (1) a permanent administrative position as an assistant\n\nprincipal; (2) an administrator’s contract that would qualify her\n\nfor further promotions; and (3) compensation in the form of back\n\npay for the time period during which she was denied a promotion.\n\nThe settlement did not otherwise provide for the recovery of\n\ncompensatory or punitive damages.\n\n       The parties were unable to agree on the amount of attorney\n\nfees that Coleman was entitled to recover as the “prevailing\n\nparty,” see 42 U.S.C. § 1988, and Coleman filed a petition for fees\n\nand costs in the district court in March 1998.   At that time, the\n\ncase had been pending for almost three years.    Coleman requested\n\n$159,597.75 in attorney and support staff fees and $4,947.43 in\n\ncosts.2\n\n       Coleman’s request included attorney fees in the amount of\n\n   2\n          Coleman’s initial fee request actually requested $107,131\nin attorney fees, to be enhanced by a 1.5 multiplier for a total of\n$160,696.50 in attorney fees. The figures in the original petition\nwere based upon an erroneous calculation of the total number of\nhours set forth in the supporting documentation. Coleman later\nsubmitted a page correcting the number of hours and total amount of\nbilled fees to $ 106,398.59. Coleman did not, however, correct the\ntotal request to reflect the lower figure of $159,597.75 after the\nmultiplier was applied.\n\n                                 3\n\f$85,962.50, including $73,062.50 for the services of partners\n\nStuart     and     Carol    Nelkin       (calculated         as    208.75    hours     at\n\n$350.00/hour), $9,350 for the services of first-year associate\n\nKenneth Krock (calculated as 46.75 hours at $200.00/hour), and\n\n$3,550     for    the   services    of    an     unidentified       associate,    “MFH”\n\n(calculated       as    17.75    hours    at     $200.00/hour).         Coleman      also\n\nrequested        $19,900   for    the     work    of    four      para-professionals,\n\nincluding $12,700 for work done by law clerk Kenneth Krock before\n\nhe passed the bar exam (calculated as 158.75 hours at $80.00/hour),\n\n$5,500 for the work of paralegal “EBB” (calculated as 68.75 hours\n\nat $80.00), $960 for the work of paralegal “WSL” (calculated as 12\n\nhours at $80.00/hour), and $740 for the work of paralegal “CLC”\n\n(calculated as 9.25 hours at $80.00).                  As a final element, Coleman\n\nrequested $536 for the overtime services of certain clerical staff.\n\nColeman also argued that applicable precedent justified application\n\nof a 1.5 multiplier as an enhancement to the requested lodestar\n\namount of $106,398.50, for a total fee request of $159,597.75, plus\n\nthe $4,947.43 in costs and expenses.\n\n      The defendants responded with lengthy and specific objections\n\nto   the   fee     petition.       With    respect      to   the    number   of   hours\n\nreasonably expended, the defendants argued that the district court\n\nshould exclude from any fee award: (1) hours expended on, or with\n\ncertain limited exceptions, during the prior Fifth Circuit appeal;\n\n(2) duplicative hours billed by a law clerk for attending, rather\n\nthan conducting or participating in, depositions; (3) duplicative\n\nhours billed by Stuart Nelkin for certain client communications;\n\n\n                                            4\n\f(4) unnecessary hours spent discussing unrelated or tangentially\n\nrelated issues     with   the    Texas       Comptroller    or    the     press;     (5)\n\nunnecessary hours billed for “legal research” before the first\n\npretrial   conference;     (6)     excessive       hours        billed    as    client\n\ncommunications; (7) unjustified separate billings for clerical\n\nstaff overtime; and (8) several hours billed by paralegal staff at\n\n$80.00/hour for “filing documents.” With respect to the reasonable\n\nhourly rate for participating attorneys, the defendants argued that\n\nthe Nelkins’ $350.00/hour rate was excessive, even for well-\n\nqualified lawyers experienced in the civil rights area.                              The\n\ndefendants further argued that the $200.00/hour rate billed by the\n\nnewly-graduated,     first-year     associate       Kenneth        Krock       and   the\n\nunidentified “MFH” was excessive.\n\n     Following   a   brief      contested      hearing     on    the     matter,     the\n\ndistrict court awarded Coleman $107,000 in attorney and support\n\nstaff fees and $4,947.43 in costs.             The district court’s award of\n\nattorney fees approximated the total number of hours requested at\n\nthe hourly rates submitted,3 but reduced Coleman’s $159,597.75\n\nrequest by refusing to allow the requested 1.5 multiplier.\n\n     HISD and the individual defendants appeal.                    The defendants\n\nconcede Coleman is entitled to recover some attorney fees, but\n\nargue by way of various categorical and specific challenges that\n\n\n     3\n          Coleman’s corrected request, excluding any multiplier,\nwas in the amount of $106,398.50, plus $4,947.43 in costs, for a\ntotal of $111,345.93. The record does not reflect, either in the\nrelevant pleadings or in the transcript of the hearing on attorney\nfees, how the district court reached the final award figure of\n$107,000 plus costs.\n\n                                         5\n\fthe award of attorney and support staff fees should be reduced to\n\n$20,959.50.     Defendants make no challenge to the amount of costs\n\nawarded, and Coleman has not cross-appealed the district court’s\n\nrefusal to apply a 1.5 multiplier to enhance the amount of billed\n\nfees.   Having reviewed Coleman’s fee petition in light of the\n\nrecord and the applicable precedent, we conclude that the district\n\ncourt either ignored or failed to adequately address certain merit-\n\nworthy objections raised by the defendants when making the award of\n\nattorney fees.     We therefore vacate the district court’s order\n\ngranting Coleman $107,000 in attorney fees plus $4,947.43 in costs\n\nand render judgment reducing the award of fees as set forth in this\n\nopinion.\n\n\n\n                   II.   APPLICABLE LEGAL PRINCIPLES\n\n     This Circuit has defined a two-step process for determining\n\n“reasonable” attorney fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988.     First,\n\nthe district court must calculate a lodestar fee, which is the\n\nproduct of the number of hours reasonably expended on the case and\n\nthe hourly rate that is reasonable for the participating lawyers.\n\nSee Migis v. Pearle Vision, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"751557\"><a href=\"/opinion/751557/78-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1379-73-empl-prac-dec-p-45308-melissa/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1041</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1047 (5th Cir.\n\n1998). The lodestar determination is not mechanistic, and the\n\ndistrict court’s determination of the lodestar amount should not be\n\nguided solely by the billing records or the rates requested in the\n\nfee petition.    See, e.g., Hensley v. Eckerhart, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110929\"><a href=\"/opinion/110929/hensley-v-eckerhart/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Rather, the district court is required to\n\n\n                                   6\n\fidentify from the fee petition those hours that were “reasonably”\n\nexpended on the litigation.        When making that determination, the\n\ndistrict court is obligated to scrutinize the billing records\n\ncarefully and to exclude excessive, duplicative, or otherwise\n\nunnecessary entries.        See City of Riverside v. Rivera, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111730\"><a href=\"/opinion/111730/riverside-v-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The district court should also consider whether the work\n\nperformed was “‘legal work in the strict sense,’ or was merely\n\nclerical work that happened to be performed by a lawyer.”                 Abrams,\n\n805 F.2d at 536 (quoting Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc.,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"315529\"><a href=\"/opinion/315529/7-fair-emplpraccas-1-7-empl-prac-dec-p-9079-richard-johnson-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">714</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 717 (5th Cir. 1974)).\n\n       Similarly, the district court must determine reasonable hourly\n\nrates for the billing attorneys or paralegals. A reasonable hourly\n\nrate is determined with reference to the prevailing market rate in\n\nthe relevant legal community for similar work.               See Leroy v. City\n\nof Houston, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"543758\"><a href=\"/opinion/543758/moses-leroy-v-the-city-of-houston-greater-houston-civic-council-v-frank/\"><span class=\"volume\">906</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1068</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1079 (5th Cir. 1990).

The     burden   of    demonstrating\n\nreasonableness is on the fee applicant.              See id.      Factual deter-\n\nminations relating to the number of hours reasonably expended and\n\nthe reasonable hourly rate are reviewed for clear error.                      See\n\nMigis, 135 F.3d at 1047.\n\n       In the second step, the district court must consider whether\n\nthe    circumstances   of    the   case     merit    an   upward    or   downward\n\nadjustment of the lodestar amount.          That determination is informed\n\n\n                                        7\n\fby a consideration of the twelve factors defined in Johnson v.\n\nGeorgia Highway Express, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"315529\"><a href=\"/opinion/315529/7-fair-emplpraccas-1-7-empl-prac-dec-p-9079-richard-johnson-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">714</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 717 (5th Cir. 1974).\n\nThose factors are: (1) the time and labor required; (2) the novelty\n\nand difficulty of the legal issues; (3) the skill required to\n\nperform the legal service properly; (4) the preclusion of other\n\nemployment by the attorney as a result of taking the case; (5) the\n\ncustomary fee; (6) whether the fee is fixed or contingent; (7) time\n\nlimitations imposed by the client or other circumstances; (8) the\n\nmonetary   amount   involved   and    the   results   obtained;   (9)   the\n\nexperience, reputation, and ability of the attorneys; (10) whether\n\nthe case is undesirable; (11) the nature and duration of the\n\nprofessional relationship with the client; and (12) awards in\n\nsimilar cases.      See, e.g., Rivera, 106 S. Ct. at 2691 n.3.          The\n\nJohnson factors are favorably cited in both the House and Senate\n\nReports accompanying 42 U.S.C. § 1988, and have likewise been\n\nadopted by the Supreme Court.        See, e.g., id. at 2691.\n\n     The Johnson factors are more than just a laundry list of\n\nfactors to be systematically passed upon once a determination of\n\nthe lodestar amount is made.         Indeed, this Court has emphasized\n\nthat the Johnson factors are relevant to and may often “govern the\n\ndetermination of reasonableness itself.”        Abrams, 805 F.2d at 536.\n\nThe district court’s application of the Johnson factors, its\n\ndecision whether to depart from the lodestar amount, and thus, the\n\nultimate fee award, are reviewed for an abuse of discretion.            See\n\nMigis, 135 F.3d at 1047; Louisiana Power & Light Co. v. Kellstrom,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"7017\"><a href=\"/opinion/7017/louisiana-power-light-co-v-kellstrom/\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">319</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 329 (5th Cir. 1995).\n\n\n                                     8\n\f     In this appeal, the defendants challenge the district court’s\n\ndetermination of the reasonable number of hours expended and its\n\nfinal determination that the fee request was reasonable.\n\n\n\n                  III.    THE REASONABLE NUMBER OF HOURS\n\n     The district court did not enter an order addressing the\n\ndefendant’s specific objections to Coleman’s fee petition, and the\n\ntranscript of the brief hearing in the district court provides the\n\nonly discussion of the district court’s reasoning.                 The district\n\ncourt   first    held    that   Coleman    was   a   “prevailing    party”   and\n\ntherefore entitled to attorney fees.             See 42 U.S.C. § 1988.       The\n\ndefendants do not directly challenge that finding on appeal.                 The\n\ndistrict court then rejected any approach that would require a\n\nsegregation of successful arguments as opposed to unsuccessful\n\narguments for the purpose of parsing the fee award.                 Using that\n\nrationale,      the     district   court    addressed     and   rejected     the\n\ndefendants’ argument that Coleman should not recover for hours that\n\nwere billed for or during defendant Ellis’ appeal from the district\n\ncourt’s order denying qualified immunity.             The district court did\n\nnot otherwise address the defendants’ specific challenges to the\n\nnumber of hours reasonably expended on the litigation.\n\n\n\nA.   The Prior Appeal\n\n     On appeal, the defendants argue that Coleman should not\n\nrecover for any hours expended on the Fifth Circuit appeal, which\n\nthe defendants say Coleman “lost,” and defendant Ellis “won.”\n\n\n                                       9\n\f     As an initial matter, we note that Ellis did not unambiguously\n\n“win” the appeal.    While it is true that this Court reversed the\n\ndistrict court’s order denying summary judgment, our prior opinion\n\nis narrowly drafted to find error with the assumption used by the\n\ndistrict court to deny qualified immunity; that is, that Ellis\n\nmight   still   be   liable   to    Coleman    even     if   Ellis   did   not\n\nintentionally    discriminate      against    Coleman    because     Hornsby’s\n\ndiscriminatory intent, if any, could be imputed to Ellis.                  See\n\nColeman, 113 F.3d at 535 (“[W]e emphasize that our decision in this\n\ninterlocutory appeal is limited to the narrow legal proposition\n\nthat a district court may not impute the alleged discriminatory\n\nmotivations of a superior to a subordinate for purposes of the\n\nqualified immunity analysis.”).           The opinion does not render\n\njudgment that Ellis is entitled to qualified immunity, and in fact,\n\nexpressly leaves open the question of whether an order denying\n\nqualified immunity might otherwise be appropriate, stating:\n\n          [W]e express no opinion as to whether the court\n          erred in assuming that Ellis did not intentionally\n          discriminate against Coleman; nor do we consider\n          whether a genuine issue of material fact exists\n          concerning   the   allegations    of   intentional\n          discrimination on the part of Ellis. On remand,\n          the district court is free to entertain this\n          alternate ground for denying qualified immunity.\n\nId. (footnote omitted).\n\n     On remand, Ellis did not seek, and was not granted, dismissal\n\nfrom the case in her individual capacity.         Thus, Coleman’s claims\n\nagainst Ellis were live claims at the time the parties reached\n\nsettlement.     Indeed, Coleman’s claims against HISD, Ellis, and\n\nHornsby as to the Ryan Middle School position were the only live\n\n                                     10\n\fclaims remaining to be settled when the parties agreed to settle\n\nthe case.   Crawford and Hornsby had already been granted qualified\n\nimmunity as to Coleman’s claims relating to the Jones High School\n\nposition.      The   defendants’   argument   that   the   appeal   was   an\n\nunqualified success for their side is without merit.          Thus, it is\n\nreasonable to say, on the force of the settlement, that Coleman\n\n“prevailed” in her claims against Ellis.\n\n     Moreover, there is ample authority for the proposition that a\n\npartially prevailing party may recover all reasonably incurred\n\nattorney fees, even though the party did not prevail on all claims,\n\nas to all defendants, or as to all issues in a matter.         See, e.g.,\n\nHensley, 103 S. Ct. at 1940 (1983); Kellstrom, 50 F.3d at 327; Cobb\n\nv. Miller, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"488545\"><a href=\"/opinion/488545/elbert-a-cobb-and-gail-smith-cobb-husband-and-wife-v-beauregard-h/\"><span class=\"volume\">818</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1227</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1233 (5th Cir. 1987).       When the plaintiff\n\nhas prevailed as to some claims, and failed as to others, the key\n\nis whether the successful and unsuccessful claims are based upon\n\nthe same facts and legal theories, i.e. whether the claims are\n\nrelated. See Hensley, 103 S. Ct. at 1940.       When the successful and\n\nunsuccessful claims involve a “common core of facts” or are based\n\nupon “related legal theories,” then attorney fees incurred in the\n\npresentation of unsuccessful claims are recoverable on the theory\n\nthat they contributed to the plaintiff’s ultimate success.                Id.\n\nSimilarly, a prevailing party may not recover for hours devoted\n\nsolely to claims against defendants as to whom the plaintiff did\n\nnot prevail.     See Kellstrom, 50 F.3d at 327.        “But when claims\n\nagainst multiple parties share a common core of facts or related\n\nlegal theories, a fee applicant may claim all hours reasonably\n\n\n                                    11\n\fnecessary to litigate those issues.” Id. (internal quotations\n\nomitted).\n\n      In this case, Coleman named HISD, Hornsby, and Ellis in her\n\nclaim that she was denied a position at Ryan Middle School.\n\nAlthough Ellis appealed the district court’s denial of qualified\n\nimmunity from suit, she was never granted qualified immunity or\n\notherwise dismissed from the suit prior to settlement of the claims\n\nagainst her.    Thus, the claims against Ellis at the time of appeal\n\nand the claims ultimately settled in Coleman’s favor are identical.\n\nWe   conclude   that   the   district   court   did   not   clearly   err   by\n\nincluding as a category certain hours billed as a consequence of\n\nEllis’ prior appeal on the issue of qualified immunity.\n\n      Neither did the district court clearly err by including time\n\nbilled during the pendency of the appeal.             The defendants argue\n\nthat Coleman should not be able to recover for hours billed while\n\nthe appeal was pending because the case was stayed in the district\n\ncourt between March 29, 1996 and May 19, 1997, when this Court\n\nissued its opinion in Coleman.\n\n      We disagree. Ellis appealed in April 1996. Although the case\n\nwas later closed for statistical purposes in July 1996, Coleman\n\nfiled a motion for leave to amend her pleadings, together with an\n\namended complaint, while the appeal was pending in January 1997.\n\nMoreover, Coleman’s attorneys were also pursuing an EEOC right to\n\nsue letter while the appeal was pending.\n\n      Defendants acknowledge that Coleman was continuing work on an\n\namended complaint and the EEOC right to sue letter, and do not\n\n\n                                    12\n\fargue that the time billed for those activities should be excluded\n\nfrom Coleman’s recovery.        Rather, the defendants argue that time\n\nnot clearly tied to either the Fifth Circuit appeal, the amended\n\ncomplaint, or the EEOC right to sue letter should be excluded.\n\n     Having conducted an independent review of the billing records,\n\nwe are able to find only 20 otherwise recoverable attorney hours\n\n(11.75 billed by Stuart Nelkin at $350.00 and 8.25 billed by\n\nKenneth Krock at $200.00/hour), and 6.5 otherwise recoverable\n\nsupport staff hours (all billed by Kenneth Krock before he was\n\nadmitted to the bar) that fall within this category.            Most of these\n\nhours    are   billed     for   either    meeting     with   or    reviewing\n\ncorrespondence from Coleman or opposing counsel.             Many of these\n\nhours are clustered around significant events occurring in the\n\nappeal, such as the designation of the appellate record, the filing\n\nof the appellate briefs, and oral argument.            While more detailed\n\nentries specifying the reason for certain calls or meetings would\n\ncertainly have been desirable, we cannot, on the basis of this\n\nrecord, conclude that the district court erred by including these\n\nhours as a category of recoverable time.\n\n     For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the district court did\n\nnot clearly    err   by   refusing   to   reduce    Coleman’s    request   for\n\nattorney and support staff fees by excluding hours billed as a\n\nconsequence of, or during the prior appeal of this case to our\n\nCourt.\n\n\n\nB.   Duplicative and Unnecessary Entries\n\n\n                                     13\n\f     Defendants argue that Coleman should not be permitted to\n\nrecover attorney fees for hours that law clerk Kenneth Krock spent\n\nattending, rather than participating in, or conducting depositions.\n\nThe billing records reflect that Krock spent at least 17 hours\n\nattending depositions conducted by one of the Nelkins.               Krock also\n\nbilled     an   additional    six     hours     preparation   time    for   the\n\ndepositions. The defendants challenge this time as duplicative and\n\nunnecessary.\n\n     We agree.       Coleman does not contend that Krock actively\n\nparticipated, even in a supporting role, during the deposition.\n\n“[H]ours spent in duplicative activity or spent in the passive role\n\nof an observer while other attorneys perform[]” is generally not\n\nrecoverable.     Flowers v. Wiley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"402376\"><a href=\"/opinion/402376/ruby-flowers-v-ruth-m-wiley-grayson-county-tax-assessor-collector/\"><span class=\"volume\">675</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">704</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 705 (5th Cir. 1982).\n\nWe conclude that the 17 hours billed as observation time should\n\nhave been excluded from the determination of reasonable hours by\n\nthe district court.        That principle does not, however, require\n\nexclusion of Krock’s preparation time, which could have been\n\nlegitimately incurred preparing materials for the partner’s use.\n\n     For the foregoing reasons, the number of hours submitted for\n\nthe work of law clerk Krock will be reduced by 17 hours in the\n\nfinal fee award.\n\n     Defendants     also     object    to     certain   facially   duplicative\n\nentries.    For example, defendants challenge Stuart Nelkins’ dual\n\nentries for client meetings on January 31, 1996, and for reading a\n\nclient letter on May 22, 1996.        Having reviewed the record, and the\n\narguments of the parties, we agree that these entries are suspect.\n\n\n                                       14\n\fA total of one hour will be deducted from the total number of hours\n\nbilled by Stuart Nelkin to account for these duplications.\n\n     Defendants also challenge an August 14, 1995 entry for 4.5\n\nhours of “legal research” performed by law clerk Kenneth Krock.\n\nDefendants argue the research was unnecessary, and alternatively,\n\nthat the entry is too vague to support recovery.\n\n     We disagree.   There is nothing patently unreasonable about\n\nconducting preliminary research on a case once it is initiated.         In\n\naddition, we have declined to find clear error when an award was\n\npremised upon similar entries.    See Kellstrom, 50 F.3d at 327.       The\n\ndistrict court’s inclusion of the 4.5 hours billed by Kenneth Krock\n\non August 14, 1995 was not clearly erroneous.\n\n     Defendants also challenge the district court’s decision to\n\npermit Coleman to recover for hours expended on what they claim are\n\nunrelated matters. When investigating this case, Coleman’s lawyers\n\ndiscovered that a Hispanic group had filed suit against HISD\n\nalleging system-wide discrimination.       Coleman’s position in this\n\nlitigation was that HISD inappropriately responded to that suit and\n\npolitical pressure by exercising a racial preference in favor of\n\nHispanics.   Defendants object to several hours billed to research\n\nnews articles and to obtain videotape records of the Hispanic\n\ncommunity’s protests against HISD.\n\n     Coleman’s counsel also learned that the Texas Comptroller was\n\nconducting an audit of HISD, including their hiring and promotion\n\npolicies.    Counsel   claims    that   they   were   contacted   by   the\n\nComptroller for information about Coleman’s case and decided to\n\n\n                                  15\n\fcooperate because they thought any resulting report would be\n\nbeneficial to her case.        Defendants object to several hours billed\n\nfor conversations with the Texas Comptroller and for making copies\n\nfor the Comptroller.\n\n      Defendants argue that none of this time is recoverable because\n\nit was not spent “on the litigation” of the matter, citing several\n\ndistrict court cases, including Watkins v. Fordice, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1967431\"><a href=\"/opinion/1967431/watkins-v-fordice/\"><span class=\"volume\">807</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">406</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">   (S.D.   Miss.    1992)   (holding        that     “plaintiffs'      attorneys'\n\nlegislative lobbying work and their work relating to the Justice\n\nDepartment's review of the State's Section 5 submission were not\n\n‘necessary’ to advance the litigation.”). The cited cases prohibit\n\nrecovery for tangentially related investigation that benefits or\n\nmay   benefit   the    attorney      in   more    than    one   case.      There    is\n\nundoubtedly     a   fine    line    between      necessary      investigation      and\n\nunjustified over billing.           But counsel’s investigation of the suit\n\nby Hispanics against HISD was clearly related to her theory that\n\nHISD was systematically favoring Hispanic administrators.                      There\n\nis, therefore, no error in the district court’s decision to include\n\nthe   relatively      few   hours    at   issue    as    part    of   a   reasonable\n\ninvestigation of Coleman’s claims.\n\n\n\nC.    Client Communications\n\n      Defendants also argue that Coleman’s attorneys billed an\n\nexcessive amount of time for client communications.                        Coleman’s\n\ncounsel billed approximately 66 hours for activities that can be\n\ncharacterized as client communications, such as meetings, telephone\n\n\n                                          16\n\fcalls,   and    either   preparing   correspondence    to   or   reviewing\n\ncorrespondence from the client.4      Defendants note that Coleman was\n\nnot deposed and that she was not asked to respond to any written\n\ndiscovery.     They therefore suspect that counsel was merely holding\n\nColeman’s hand and request that the time be reduced by fifty\n\npercent.     Defendants are particularly perturbed by the lengthy\n\nphone calls and meetings because they believe many occurred during\n\nnormal working hours when HISD was already paying Coleman to work.\n\n     We consider this a very close issue.      Attorneys are required\n\nto exercise sound billing judgment, see Hensley, 103 S. Ct. at\n\n1939-40, and the inclusion in this case of a large number of hours\n\nfor client communications, without any elaboration with respect to\n\nthe purpose or aim of the communication, and without any mention of\n\nthe objective to be sought with respect to such communication, is\n\nsufficient to call the judgment of the billing attorneys into\n\nquestion.      On the other hand, we note that many of the client\n\ncommunications billed in this case can be tied to significant\n\nevents in the litigation.     To the extent that client communication\n\nbecame excessive when the need arose, we note that only about one-\n\nthird of the hours billed as client communications were billed by\n\na partner at the higher $350.00/hour rate.            Most of the hours\n\nbilled as client communications were in fact billed by support\n\nstaff rather than by attorneys.\n\n\n     4\n          As   noted   in the defendants’ briefs, an exact\ndetermination of the time spent on client communication is not\npossible because entries containing multiple tasks are not\nsegregated.\n\n                                     17\n\f     It may well be that Coleman was more demanding than good\n\nbilling judgment allows.       In any event, this case comes about as\n\nclose to the boundary between justifiable client communication and\n\nindulgent over billing as we can imagine.            Nonetheless, we are\n\nultimately persuaded by the deferential standard of review that we\n\nare not able, on the basis of this record, to second-guess the\n\ndistrict court’s judgment.      While we may disagree with respect to\n\nthe permissible number of hours that should have been expended\n\ncommunicating with Ms. Coleman, we are not able to say that the\n\ndistrict court’s determination of the reasonable number of hours in\n\nthis regard is clearly erroneous.        Likewise, we are not able to say\n\nthat the district court’s refusal to reduce the number of hours\n\nreasonably   requested   was   an   abuse   of   discretion.   For   these\n\nreasons, we conclude that the district court’s refusal to reduce\n\nthe number of hours billed as client communications is not clearly\n\nerroneous.\n\n\n\nD.   Clerical Overtime\n\n     Defendants challenge 23.25 hours billed by clerical staff.\n\nAll of this time was billed as overtime.          Defendants argue that,\n\nwithout regard to the issue of whether clerical staff time can ever\n\nbe separately billed, there is no factual or legal justification\n\nfor permitting the Nelkins’ office staff to be compensated for\n\novertime.    Neither the fee petition nor the briefs explain why\n\novertime was necessary.    In addition, the district court expressly\n\nnoted, as part of its Johnson analysis, that there were no unusual\n\n\n                                    18\n\ftime restrictions in the case.\n\n     We agree.    The 23.25 hours billed as clerical staff overtime\n\nwill be deducted from the total number of compensable hours.   Our\n\nholding in this regard eliminates the need to address whether the\n\nhourly rates requested for those staff members were reasonable.\n\n\n\nE.   Clerical Work Performed by a Paralegal\n\n     Finally, the defendants raise certain objections to hours\n\nbilled by paralegal “WSL” at $80.00/hour for “filing documents.”\n\nParalegal expense is recoverable only to the extent that the work\n\nperformed is similar to that typically performed by lawyers. Allen\n\nv. United States Steel Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"397409\"><a href=\"/opinion/397409/27-fair-emplpraccas-1293-27-empl-prac-dec-p-32338-dorothy-allen/\"><span class=\"volume\">665</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">689</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 697 (5th Cir. Unit B\n\n1982).    Otherwise, paralegal expense is an unrecoverable overhead\n\nexpense. See id. “Of course, purely clerical or secretarial tasks\n\nshould not be billed at a paralegal rate, regardless of who\n\nperforms them.”    Missouri v. Jenkins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112299\"><a href=\"/opinion/112299/missouri-v-jenkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2463</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2472 n.10\n\n(1989).\n\n     Neither the record nor applicable precedent supports the use\n\nof a relatively expensive paralegal to file documents.     The 3.5\n\nhours billed by paralegal “WSL” for “filing documents” will be\n\ndeducted from the total number of hours in the fee petition.\n\n     On the basis of the foregoing analysis the district court’s\n\ndetermination of the number of hours reasonably billed will be\n\nreduced as follows: Stuart Nelkin’s hours will be reduced from 194\n\nto 191; Carol Nelkin’s hours will remain the same at 14.75 hours;\n\nKenneth Krock’s hours as an attorney will remain the same at 46.75\n\n\n                                 19\n\fhours; “MFH”’s hours will remain the same at 17.75 hours; Kenneth\n\nKrock’s hours as a law clerk will be reduced from 158.75 to 141.75;\n\nparalegal “WSL”’s hours will be reduced from 12 to 8.5; paralegal\n\n“EBB”’s hours will remain the same at 68.75; paralegal “CLC”’s\n\nhours will remain the same at 9.25; and the 23.25 hours billed as\n\nclerical overtime will be deleted entirely.\n\n\n\n                         IV.   THE REASONABLE HOURLY RATE\n\n     We must next consider the district court’s determination that\n\nthe hourly rates requested by Coleman’s counsel were reasonable.\n\nColeman requested that partners be compensated at the rate of\n\n$350.00/hour, that associate attorneys be compensated at the rate\n\nof $200.00/hour, and that the law clerk and the paralegals be\n\ncompensated at the rate of $80.00/hour.                   Defendants objected to\n\nthese   rates,     submitting       evidence   that   the    maximum       reasonable\n\nbilling     rate     for       an   experienced    partner       would     be   about\n\n$240.00/hour, while relatively new associates should be billed at\n\nonly $125.00/hour.             The district court held that the highest\n\nreasonable hourly rate would ordinarily be $250.00, but that\n\n“because    of     the    contingency,”      the   rate    of    $350.00/hour      for\n\npartners,    with        similar    upward   adjustments        in   the   rates   for\n\nassociates and paralegals, was justified.\n\n     Based upon our review of the record, we agree with the\n\ndistrict court that the reasonable hourly rates in this case are\n\nmuch lower than those requested by Coleman.                          In our view, a\n\nreasonable hourly rate for similar work in the relevant legal\n\n\n                                          20\n\fmarket would place partner compensation at $250.00/hour, associate\n\ncompensation for Kenneth Krock and “MFH” at $125.00/hour, and law\n\nclerk and paralegal compensation at $65.00/hour. We likewise agree\n\nwith the district court that some upward adjustment for contingency\n\nis appropriate.   Coleman presented evidence that the complexity of\n\ncivil rights litigation and the delay attending payment of the fees\n\nin   civil   rights   litigation     potentially    deters   accomplished\n\npractitioners from accepting such cases on a contingent fee basis.\n\nColeman claimed in the district court, and again on appeal, that\n\nwhile she initially agreed to pay her attorney fees, the payment of\n\nfees became, at some point, contingent upon a successful outcome.\n\nWhile the terms of any contract engaging the attorneys’ services is\n\nnot determinative with respect to the reasonable hourly rate that\n\nmay be used to calculate a lodestar amount, we agree with Coleman\n\nthat the inherent risk of loss and the lengthy delay in recovering\n\nattorney fees are material to our determination of a reasonable\n\nhourly rate.    See Blanchard v. Bergeron, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112196\"><a href=\"/opinion/112196/blanchard-v-bergeron/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">939</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 944-46\n\n(1989).\n\n     All things considered, however, and with due consideration of\n\nthe record evidence, we conclude that those factors justify a more\n\nmodest increase for partner compensation from $250.00/hour to\n\n$275.00/hour,   in    associate    compensation    from   $125.00/hour   to\n\n$137.00/hour, and in law clerk and paralegal compensation from\n\n$65.00/hour to $72.00/hour.       The district court’s decision setting\n\nthe reasonable hourly rates much higher because of a \"contingency\n\nfactor\" was clearly erroneous.        The lodestar calculation carried\n\n\n                                     21\n\fout below will be based upon those rates.\n\n\n\n             V.   Overall Reasonableness under Johnson\n\n     Defendants also make several challenges to the overall award\n\non the basis of the Johnson factors.    The most critical Johnson\n\nfactor is the degree of success obtained.   See Hensley, 103 S. Ct.\n\nat 1941. Defendants maintain that Coleman’s recovery was minute in\n\ncomparison to what she sought.\n\n     We disagree. The district court ordered HISD to place Coleman\n\nin an administrative position comparable in status and pay to an\n\nassistant principal position.    Coleman’s salary in that position\n\nwas more than $7,000 higher than her teacher salary.          At the\n\nconclusion of the suit, the settlement provided that Coleman would\n\nbe given such a position permanently.   Defendants also argue that\n\nColeman’s recovery of attorney fees is unreasonable because it is\n\ndisproportionate to her monetary recovery, citing Migis v. Pearle\n\nVision, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"751557\"><a href=\"/opinion/751557/78-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1379-73-empl-prac-dec-p-45308-melissa/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1041</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (5th Cir. 1998).\n\n     The Supreme Court has flatly rejected a bright-line rule that\n\nattorney fees under § 1988 must be proportionate to the damages\n\nrecovered.   See Rivera, 106 S. Ct. at 2697 (“We reject the\n\nproposition that fee awards under § 1988 should necessarily be\n\nproportionate to the amount of damages a civil rights plaintiff\n\nactually recovers.”).    Moreover, the extent of success is not\n\nmeasured solely by monetary damages.     See id. (“a civil rights\n\nplaintiff often secures important social benefits that are not\n\nreflected in nominal or relatively small damages awards.”).    Thus,\n\n\n                                 22\n\fwhile the amount of monetary damages recovered should be considered\n\nas one of the twelve Johnson factors, it should not be given\n\ndeterminative   effect   where   the   plaintiff   has   received   other\n\nmeaningful relief.\n\n     Coleman’s victory in this case was substantial enough to\n\nsupport the award of fees as modified by this opinion.        We find no\n\nabuse of discretion in the district court’s rejection of the\n\ndefendants’ arguments to the contrary.\n\n\n\n                             CONCLUSION\n\n     The district court’s award of attorney and support staff fees\n\nin the amount of $107,000, plus $4,947.43 in costs and expenses is\n\nVACATED and judgment is RENDERED granting Coleman attorney and\n\nsupport staff fees in the amount of $81,851.75, plus $4,947.43 in\n\ncosts and expenses.\n\n\n\n\n                                  23\n\f</pre>",
