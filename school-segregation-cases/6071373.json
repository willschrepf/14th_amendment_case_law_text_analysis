(BUDDY) PIKE, SR., DANIEL L. WALKER,\nW. TOBIN WILSON, VHSC CEMENT, LLC\nAND FEW READY MIX CONCRETE CO.,\n                                         Appellants\nv.\n\nTEXAS EMC MANAGEMENT, LLC, TEXAS EMC\nPRODUCTS, LP AND EMC CEMENT, BV,\n                                   Appellees\n\n\n\n                          From the 77th District Court\n                           Limestone County, Texas\n                            Trial Court No. 30,023-A\n\n\n                         MEMORANDUM OPINION\n\n\n      In numerous issues, appellants, Clinton W. Pike Sr., Daniel L. Walker, W. Tobin\n\nWilson, VHSC Cement, LLC, and Few Ready Mix Concrete, challenge a judgment in\n\nfavor of appellees, Texas EMC Management, LLC, Texas EMC Products, LP, and EMC\n\nCement, BV, stemming from the breakup of a partnership and the subsequent purchase\n\nof the partnership’s assets at a foreclosure sale. In a cross-appeal, EMC Management,\n\fEMC Products, and EMC Cement complain about the trial court’s denial of their request\n\nfor a permanent injunction in favor of cross-appellees, Pike, Walker, Wilson, VHSC, and\n\nFew Ready Mix.1 After review, we modify the Amended Final Judgment to delete Pike’s\n\nliability for breach of his Management Agreement with EMC Products and affirm the\n\njudgment in all other respects. We also reverse the trial court’s denial of the permanent\n\ninjunction and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.2\n\n                                 I.       SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE\n\n        Here, appellants raise sufficiency challenges with regard to aspects of the\n\nAmended Final Judgment. In a legal-sufficiency review, we consider the evidence in the\n\nlight most favorable to the verdict, indulging every reasonable inference in favor of the\n\nverdict. Autozone, Inc. v. Reyes, 272 S.W.3d 588, 592 (Tex. 2008) (per curiam); Associated\n\nIndem. Corp. v. CAT Contracting, Inc., 964 S.W.2d 276, 286 (Tex. 1998). To determine\n\nwhether legally-sufficient evidence supports a challenged finding of fact, we credit\n\nevidence that supports the finding if reasonable jurors could, and disregard contrary\n\nevidence unless reasonable jurors could not. See Kroger Tex. Ltd. P’ship v. Suberu, 216\n\nS.W.3d 788, 793 (Tex. 2006); see also City of Keller v. Wilson, 168 S.W.3d 802, 822 (Tex. 2005).\n\nThe factfinder is the sole judge of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be\n\n\n\n        1As this is a memorandum opinion and the parties are familiar with the facts, we only recite those\nnecessary to the disposition of the case. See TEX. R. APP. P. 47.1, 47.4.\n\n        2We withdraw our opinion and judgment of May 31, 2017, and substitute this memorandum\nopinion and judgment to make non-dispositive changes.\n\nPike, et al. v. Tex. EMC Mgmt., LLC, et al.                                                        Page 2\n\fassigned to their testimony. See City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 819. The factfinder is free to\n\nbelieve one witness and disbelieve another, and reviewing courts may not impose their\n\nown opinions to the contrary. Id. As such, reviewing courts must assume that the\n\nfactfinder decided all credibility questions in the favor of the findings and chose what\n\ntestimony to disregard in a way that was in favor of the findings, if a reasonable person\n\ncould do so. Id. at 819-20.\n\n        Additionally, it is within the factfinder’s province to resolve conflicts in the\n\nevidence.     Id. at 820.     Consequently, we must assume that, where reasonable, the\n\nfactfinder resolved all conflicts in the evidence in a manner consistent with the findings.\n\nId. Where conflicting inferences can be drawn from the evidence, it is within the province\n\nof the factfinder to choose which inference to draw, so long as more than one inference\n\ncan reasonably be drawn. Id. at 821. Thus, we must assume that the factfinder made all\n\ninferences in favor of the findings if a reasonable person could do so. Id. As stated in\n\nCity of Keller, the final test for legal sufficiency must always be “whether the evidence at\n\ntrial would entitle reasonable and fair-minded people to reach the verdict under review.”\n\nId. at 827. Anything more than a scintilla of evidence is legally sufficient to support the\n\nfinding. See Cont’l Coffee Prods. Co. v. Cazarez, 937 S.W.2d 444, 450 (Tex. 1996).\n\n        In a factual-sufficiency challenge, an appellate court must consider and weigh all\n\nof the evidence. Cain v. Bain, 709 S.W.2d 175, 176 (Tex. 1986) (per curiam). The verdict\n\nshould be set aside only if it is so contrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence\n\n\nPike, et al. v. Tex. EMC Mgmt., LLC, et al.                                            Page 3\n\fas to be clearly wrong and unjust. Id. We may not pass upon the witnesses’ credibility\n\nor substitute our judgment for that of the factfinder, even if the evidence would support\n\na different result. 2900 Smith, Ltd. v. Constellation New Energy, Inc., 301 S.W.3d 741, 746\n\n(Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2009, no pet.). If we determine the evidence is factually\n\ninsufficient, we must detail the evidence relevant to the issue and state in what regard\n\nthe contrary evidence greatly outweighs the evidence supporting the trial court’s\n\njudgment; we need not do so when affirming the judgment. Id.\n\n             II.     BREACH-OF-CONTRACT CLAIMS AGAINST WALKER AND WILSON\n\n        In their second issue, Walker, Wilson, and Few Ready Mix argue that appellees’\n\nbreach-of-contract claim against Walker and Wilson is invalid as a matter of law, arguing,\n\namong other things, that: (1) the failure to provide an infinite amount of money was not\n\na breach of the Partnership Agreement; and (2) appellees breached the Partnership\n\nAgreement first. Walker, Wilson, and Few Ready Mix also contend that EMC Cement\n\nlacks standing to recover for diminished value of the partnership; that the attorney’s fees\n\naward is improper; and that the amount awarded to Walker and Wilson for appellees’\n\nbreach of the Partnership Agreement was incorrect.\n\n        A. Standing\n\n        Because it is a threshold matter, we will first consider the standing argument.\n\n“Standing is a constitutional prerequisite to maintaining suit in either federal or state\n\ncourt.” Williams v. Lara, 52 S.W.3d 171, 178 (Tex. 2001) (citing Tex. Ass’n of Bus. v. Tex. Air\n\n\nPike, et al. v. Tex. EMC Mgmt., LLC, et al.                                              Page 4\n\fControl Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440, 444 (Tex. 1993)). Standing “focuses on whether a party has a\n\nsufficient relationship with the lawsuit so as to have a ‘justiciable interest’ in its outcome.”\n\nAustin Nursing Ctr., Inc. v. Lovato, 171 S.W.3d 845, 848 (Tex. 2005). Essentially, parties\n\nhave standing when they are personally aggrieved, regardless of whether they are acting\n\nwith legal authority. See Nootsie, Ltd. v. Williamson County Appraisal Dist., 925 S.W.2d 659,\n\n661 (Tex. 1996).\n\n        On appeal, Walker, Wilson, and Few Ready Mix assert that EMC Cement lacks\n\nstanding to bring a claim against Walker and Wilson for breach of the Partnership\n\nAgreement because the cause of action belongs to the partnership, not the individual\n\npartners. Appellees counter that this argument involves capacity and, as such, has been\n\nwaived by a failure to file a verified denial under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 93. See\n\nTEX. R. CIV. P. 93.\n\n        Capacity is a procedural issue dealing with the personal qualifications of a party\n\nto litigate. See Lovato, 171 S.W.3d at 848; see also Hubbard v. Rosenthal, No. 10-10-00267-\n\nCV, 2012 Tex. App. LEXIS 4391, at *9 (Tex. App.—Waco May 30, 2012, pet. denied) (mem.\n\nop.). “[A] party has capacity when it has the legal authority to act, regardless of whether\n\nit has a justiciable interest in the controversy.” Lovato, 171 S.W.3d at 848-49; see El T.\n\nMexican Rests. v. Bacon, 921 S.W.2d 247, 250 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1995, no writ)\n\n(stating that capacity is a party’s legal authority to go to court to prosecute or defend a\n\nsuit). While standing may be raised for the first time on appeal, capacity must be raised\n\n\nPike, et al. v. Tex. EMC Mgmt., LLC, et al.                                              Page 5\n\fby verified plea in the trial court or else it is deemed waived. See Lovato, 171 S.W.3d at\n\n849; see also Sixth RMA Partners, L.P. v. Sibley, 111 S.W.3d 46, 56 (Tex. 2003).\n\n        We characterize the standing argument as a challenge to EMC Cement’s right to\n\nrecover in the capacity in which it filed suit. 3 In other words, we conclude that Walker,\n\nWilson, and Few Ready Mix’s argument that EMC Cement did not have authority to\n\nprosecute this lawsuit because that authority belonged to the partnership involves\n\ncapacity, not standing. See Pledger v. Schoellkopf, 762 S.W.2d 145, 145-46 (Tex. 1988) (per\n\ncuriam) (holding that the question whether claims brought by shareholders belonged to\n\nthe corporation involved capacity); see also Baker v. City of Robinson, 305 S.W.3d 783, 788\n\n(Tex. App.—Waco 2009, pet. denied) (concluding that an individual’s alleged lack of\n\nstanding to recover lost profits suffered by a partnership was really an issue of capacity);\n\nWHM Props. v. Dallas County, 119 S.W.3d 325, 330-31 (Tex. App.—Waco 2003, no pet.)\n\n(holding that an issue presented as a “standing” challenge pertaining to corporate status\n\nactually involved “capacity”). And because the record does not contain a verified plea\n\n\n\n\n        3 And even if Walker, Wilson, and Few Ready Mix’s argument involved standing, we note that\nsection 152.210 of the Texas Business Organizations Code provides:\n\n        A partner is liable to a partnership and the other partners for:\n\n            (1) A breach of the partnership agreement; or\n\n            (2) A violation of a duty to the partnership or other partners under this chapter that\n                causes harm to the partnership or the other partners.\n\nTEX. BUS. ORG. CODE ANN. § 152.210 (West 2012). In other words, section 152.210 would have conferred\nstanding on EMC Cement, a Class A limited partner. See id.\n\nPike, et al. v. Tex. EMC Mgmt., LLC, et al.                                                          Page 6\n\ffiled in the trial court under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 93, we conclude that this\n\nargument has been waived. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 93; see also Lovato, 171 S.W.3d at 849; Sixth\n\nRMA Partners, L.P., 111 S.W.3d at 56.\n\n        B. The Partnership Agreement\n\n        Next, we will address Walker, Wilson, and Few Ready Mix’s arguments regarding\n\nthe Partnership Agreement.\n\n        The partners in EMC Products, a Texas limited partnership, are EMC\n\nManagement, EMC Cement, Walker and certain members of his family, and Wilson.\n\nEMC Management is a general partner with a 1% share in the partnership. EMC Cement\n\nis a Class A limited partner with a 49.5% ownership stake. Walker and his family and\n\nWilson are Class B limited partners with a collective 49.5% ownership share in the\n\npartnership. Under the Partnership Agreement, the following was required of Class B\n\nlimited partners Walker and Wilson:\n\n        Section 2.5. Financing Assistance by Class B Limited Partners. The Class\n        B Limited Partners shall loan funds to and/or obtain financing for the\n        Partnership to meet the Primary Objective until such time as the\n        Partnership has the financial ability to obtain such financing on its own\n        resources. The General Partner and the Class A Limited Partner shall have\n        no obligation to make loans to and/or obtain financing for the Partnership.\n\nSection 1.5 of the Partnership Agreement outlines the primary objective of the\n\nPartnership as follows: “The Partners agree that the primary objective of the partnership\n\nwill be to maximize the degree and speed of market penetration for the Products in the\n\n\n\nPike, et al. v. Tex. EMC Mgmt., LLC, et al.                                           Page 7\n\fState of Texas, in accordance with market demand and potential, respecting sound\n\nbusiness principals.”\n\n        The usage of the term “shall” in Section 2.5 of the Partnership Agreement imposed\n\na mandatory duty on Walker and Wilson to loan funds and/or obtain financing. See\n\nLesikar v. Moon, 237 S.W.3d 361, 367 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2007, pet. denied)\n\n(“The word ‘shall’ as used in contracts is generally mandatory, operating to impose a\n\nduty.” (internal citations omitted)); In re J.L.W., 919 S.W.2d 841, 842 (Tex. App.—El Paso\n\n1996, no writ) (stating that the term “shall” is generally construed to be mandatory and\n\nmay also be considered as directory). However, despite this language, Walker, Wilson,\n\nand Few Ready Mix assert that their duty to loan or obtain funds was limited by the\n\n“sound business principals” language of the primary objective, and thus, the failure to\n\nprovide an infinite amount of money did not constitute a breach of the agreement.\n\n        We do not agree with Walker, Wilson, and Few Ready Mix’s interpretation of the\n\nPartnership Agreement.            The “sound business principles” language modifies the\n\nlanguage about the partnership’s goal of maximizing market penetration, not Walker and\n\nWilson’s obligation to loan funds and/or obtain financing for the partnership. The\n\ninterpretation advanced on appeal by Walker, Wilson, and Few Ready Mix would require\n\nus to rewrite the agreement to move the “sound business principles” language from\n\nSection 1.5 to Section 2.5 of the Partnership Agreement—something we cannot do. See\n\n\n\n\nPike, et al. v. Tex. EMC Mgmt., LLC, et al.                                         Page 8\n\fAm. Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Schaefer, 124 S.W.3d 154, 162 (Tex. 2003) (“But we may neither\n\nrewrite the parties’ contract nor add to its language.”).\n\n        And to the extent that Walker, Wilson, and Few Ready Mix contend that they did\n\nnot have to provide further financing because the partnership was unable to meet the\n\nprimary objective, we note that such a contention raises the affirmative defense of\n\nexcuse—something that Walker and Wilson had to plead and prove in the trial court. See\n\nTEX. R. CIV. P. 94; see also Trencor, Inc. v. Cornech Mach. Co., 115 S.W.3d 145, 153 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Fort Worth 2003, pet. denied). A review of the record reveals that they did neither.\n\nAs such, Walker and Wilson waived any excuse argument brought on appeal. See AMS\n\nConst. Co. v. K.H.K. Scaffolding Houston, Inc., 357 S.W.3d 30, 43 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st\n\nDist.] 2011, pet. dism’d); see also RE/MAX of Tex., Inc. v. Katar Corp., 961 S.W.2d 324, 327\n\n(Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1997, writ denied) (noting that excuse is an affirmative\n\ndefense and thus is waived if not pleaded or tried by consent).\n\n        Additionally, Walker, Wilson, and Few Ready Mix argue that Walker and Wilson’s\n\nbreach of the Partnership Agreement was excused because of the jury’s finding that EMC\n\nProducts also breached the agreement. Irrespective of the excuse affirmative defense that\n\nwas not pleaded in the trial court, the jury concluded that Walker and Wilson were the\n\nfirst to breach the Partnership Agreement. However, whether EMC Products or Walker\n\nand Wilson breached first is immaterial because of the well-settled rule that when a party\n\nmaterially breaches an agreement, the non-breaching party can elect to either rescind the\n\n\nPike, et al. v. Tex. EMC Mgmt., LLC, et al.                                           Page 9\n\fagreement or affirm and seek damages, but not both. See Texana Oil Co. v. Stephenson, 521\n\nS.W.2d 104, 106-07 (Tex. App.—El Paso 1975, no writ). Therefore, “[t]reating a contract\n\nas continuing, after a breach, deprives the non-breaching party of any excuse for\n\nterminating their own performance.” Chilton Ins. Co. v. Pate & Pate Enters., Inc., 930\n\nS.W.2d 877, 888 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 1996, writ denied) (citing W. Irrigation Co. v.\n\nReeves County Land Co., 233 S.W.2d 599, 602 (Tex. Civ. App.—El Paso 1950, no writ)).\n\n        Here, Walker and Wilson continued to perform under the Partnership Agreement,\n\ndespite the purported breach by EMC Products and then sought damages.               See id.\n\n(“Seeking to recover damages under the contract, as Pate did, is evidence that Pate\n\nconsidered the contract as continuing.” (citing Cox, Colton, Stoner, Starr and Co., P.C. v.\n\nDeloitte, Haskins & Sells, 672 S.W.2d 282, 286-87 (Tex. App.—El Paso 1984, no writ))). At\n\nthe point in time that Walker and Wilson believed that EMC Products breached the\n\nagreement, they were faced with one of two mutually-exclusive courses of action: (1)\n\ndiscontinue their performance, rescind the contract, and sue for material breach; or (2)\n\ncontinue performing and lose the other party’s material breach as an excuse for its own\n\nnon-performance. Id. (citing W. Irrigation Co., 233 S.W.2d at 602). Therefore, because\n\nWalker and Wilson chose to continue performing their duties under the Partnership\n\nAgreement after they believed EMC Products breached the agreement, Wilson and\n\nWalker forfeited any excuse for their own breach. See id. (“By its actions, Pate chose the\n\n\n\n\nPike, et al. v. Tex. EMC Mgmt., LLC, et al.                                         Page 10\n\flatter. Because Pate treated the contract as continuing after Chilton’s material breach,\n\nPate forfeited any excuse for its own breach.”).\n\n        Having rejected Walker, Wilson, and Few Ready Mix’s complaints about the jury’s\n\nbreach-of-contract finding, we therefore overrule their second issue.4\n\n                    III.     CIVIL CONSPIRACY & JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY\n\n        In their third issue, Walker, Wilson, and Few Ready Mix argue that appellees’\n\njoint-and-several liability theories fail as a matter of law for a number of reasons: (1) the\n\nevidence supporting underlying tort liability is lacking; (2) that the “knowingly\n\nparticipated” theory cannot be a valid basis for joint-and-several liability; and (3) the\n\nconspiracy theory is flawed.\n\nA.      Applicable Law\n\n        The elements of civil conspiracy are (1) two or more persons, (2) an object to be\n\naccomplished, (3) a meeting of the minds on the object or course of action, (4) one or more\n\nunlawful, overt acts, and (5) damages as a proximate result. Tri v. J.T.T., 162 S.W.3d 552,\n\n556 (Tex. 2005); see BP Auto., L.P. v. RML Waxahachie Dodge, LLC, 448 S.W.3d 562, 573 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2014, no pet.). Civil conspiracy “‘requires specific intent’ to\n\nagree ‘to accomplish an unlawful purpose or to accomplish a lawful purpose by unlawful\n\n\n\n\n        Because we believe that Walker, Wilson, and Few Ready Mix’s complaints about attorney’s fees\n        4\n\nand the damages awarded to them are best categorized in a separate section, we will consider these\ncomplaints later in this memorandum opinion.\n\nPike, et al. v.

Discussion\n\n        Ronin and Lygren both testified that, in 2008 and 2009, they began negotiating\n\nwith C-Change in California about financing, developing, and commercializing EMC\n\nCement’s intellectual property.               According to Ronin and Lygren, John Preston, a\n\nmanaging partner of C-Change, and Alan Quasha, the president of Quadrant\n\nManagement, were involved in the negotiations. Lygren noted that Walker and Wilson\n\nwere aware of the C-Change negotiations, though Wilson’s testimony implied that he\n\nwas unaware of the negotiations. Nevertheless, as a result of the negotiations, Ronin,\n\nLygren, and C-Change executed a letter of intent calling “for C-Change to commit to\n\n\nPike, et al. v. Tex. EMC Mgmt., LLC, et al.                                           Page 12\n\fcontribute a maximum investment of 50 million dollars to . . . California, 49 million to the\n\ncompany and a million to the idea” in exchange for a 51% equity interest in a holding\n\ncompany formed to develop and commercialize EMC Cement technology in California.\n\nBeginning in 2010, Quasha and Preston spoke with Walker and Wilson several times.\n\nApparently, Quasha and Preston told Walker and Wilson that they wanted to buy EMC\n\nProducts’ business but did not want to enter into an agreement with Lygren. Both Ronin\n\nand Lygren testified that they were unaware that Quasha and Preston were\n\ncommunicating with Walker and Wilson. In any event, in December 2010, EMC Cement\n\ncalled off negotiations with C-Change.\n\n        In January 2011, Walker and Wilson, frustrated with the actions of Lygren and\n\nRonin, decided to stop making the monthly $25,000 payments on EMC Products’ loan\n\nwith Texas Capital Bank, thereby causing the partnership to default on an underlying\n\nloan. Phillip Wood, Texas Capital Bank’s Executive Vice President, testified that Walker\n\nand Wilson had stated that their goal was to end their relationship with Lygren and allow\n\nQuasha and Preston to buy EMC Products’ assets at a foreclosure sale following the\n\ndefault. These plans were subsequently relayed to Quasha and Preston, according to the\n\ntestimony.\n\n        Lygren recounted that, in February 2011, Wilson told Wood that a group\n\nrepresented by Quasha was interested in EMC Products—a sentiment that Quasha\n\n\n\n\nPike, et al. v. Tex. EMC Mgmt., LLC, et al.                                          Page 13\n\fconfirmed to Wood. On April 12, 2011, Texas Capital Bank noticed the foreclosure of\n\nEMC Products’ assets for May 3, 2011.\n\n        VHSC formed on April 28, 2011. The company is owned by INEA International,\n\nLimited, a company purportedly closely associated with Quasha and Preston. According\n\nto Wood, Wilson put together the potential sale of the loan to INEA, which led to Quasha\n\nentering into discussions with the bank. These discussions allegedly resulted in a draft\n\nagreement that designated Quasha as the sole primary contact for purposes of the\n\nagreement.\n\n        Also in April 2011, Lygren informed the bank that EMC Products’ license from\n\nEMC Cement was “neither assignable nor transferable” and that the foreclosure\n\nproceedings would result in the disclosure of intellectual property belonging to EMC\n\nCement. Lygren also noted that the bank had no right to foreclose and that legal action\n\nwould be taken if the foreclosure was to proceed. Lygren then notified Walker a couple\n\nof days before May 3, 2011, that EMC Cement had terminated the license agreement with\n\nEMC Products.\n\n        Upon receiving Lygren’s notices, the bank decided not to conduct the foreclosure\n\nsale. However, Walker and Wilson coordinated the purported sale of the loan to Few\n\nReady Mix, Walker’s company, so that Few Ready Mix could foreclose on EMC Products’\n\nassets on May 3, 2011. To facilitate the purported sale of the loan, Walker and Wilson\n\nboth wired over $1.9 million to the bank on behalf of Few Ready Mix. Thereafter, Few\n\n\nPike, et al. v. Tex. EMC Mgmt., LLC, et al.                                      Page 14\n\fReady Mix sold EMC Products’ assets to VHSC at the May 3, 2011 foreclosure sale.\n\nWilson served as the trustee, and Preston was the bidder at the foreclosure sale.\n\n        VHSC bought EMC Products’ assets for $3,126,090; however, the winning bid left\n\nan approximate $800,000 deficiency on the loan. In any event, Walker testified that he\n\nand Wilson equally shared the proceeds from the sale. A day later, Few Ready Mix sold\n\nthe loan agreement to VHSC for $300,000. Walker and Wilson once again equally split\n\nthe proceeds from the sale. And within days of the sale, VHSC began selling products\n\nproduced by EMC Cement’s purported trade secrets.\n\n        Based on the evidence outlined above, and viewing the evidence in the light most\n\nfavorable to the jury’s verdict, we conclude that a rational factfinder could determine that\n\nWalker, Wilson, and Few Ready Mix worked together to achieve the common goal of\n\ndelivering EMC Cement’s trade secrets to Quasha and Preston at VHSC by breaching the\n\nPartnership Agreement, defaulting on the loan, and ensuring that EMC Products’ assets\n\nwere sold to VHSC at the foreclosure sale—acts that resulted in damage to EMC Cement.\n\nSee Tri, 162 S.W.3d at 556; Juhl, 936 S.W.2d at 644; Riley, 900 S.W.2d at 719; BP Auto., L.P.,\n\n448 S.W.3d at 573; see also Reyes, 272 S.W.3d at 592; City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 822.\n\nFurthermore, we cannot say that the jury’s verdict as to the civil-conspiracy claim is so\n\ncontrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence as to be clearly wrong and unjust.\n\nSee Cain, 709 S.W.2d at 176. Accordingly, we conclude that the evidence supporting the\n\n\n\n\nPike, et al. v. Tex. EMC Mgmt., LLC, et al.                                            Page 15\n\fjury’s finding of civil conspiracy against Walker, Wilson, and Few Ready Mix is\n\nsupported by legally- and factually-sufficient evidence. We overrule their third issue.5\n\n                                         IV.     CUMULATIVE ERROR\n\n        In their fourth issue, Walker, Wilson, and Few Ready Mix assert that the trial\n\ncourt’s alleged cumulative errors “probably led to the rendition of an improper result.”\n\nWe disagree.\n\nA.      Applicable Law\n\n\n\n\n        5 In this issue, Walker, Wilson, and Few Ready Mix also appear to argue that civil conspiracy only\napplies to dangerous activities and that the issue was improperly submitted to the jury. First, we note that\nthe “purpose of the concert of action theory is to deter antisocial or dangerous behavior.” Juhl v. Airington,\n936 S.W.2d 640, 644 (Tex. 1996) (citations omitted). Concert of action “imposes liability not for an\nagreement, but for substantially assisting and encouraging a wrongdoer in a tortious act.” Id. However,\nin analyzing Airington’s claims, the Juhl Court considered civil conspiracy and the concert-of-action theory\nas separate theories. See id. (noting that “[b]ecause Airington’s pleadings allege only that defendants were\nnegligent, civil conspiracy is not a theory upon which he could have relied to avoid summary judgment”\nand subsequently analyzing Airington’s concert-of-action theory). We therefore are not persuaded by\nWalker, Wilson, and Few Ready Mix’s assertion that civil conspiracy only applies to dangerous activities.\n\n          Additionally, we reject Walker, Wilson, and Few Ready Mix’s complaint about the jury charge. In\ntheir brief, Walker, Wilson, and Few Ready Mix invoke Casteel and argue that the conspiracy question was\nimpermissibly commingled with valid and invalid liability grounds. See Crown Life Ins. Co. v. Casteel, 22\nS.W.3d 378, 388 (Tex. 2000) (reversing for a new trial due to the erroneous commingling of valid and invalid\nliability theories in a single broad-form liability question). At trial, Walker, Wilson, and Few Ready Mix\ndid not raise a Casteel objection to the conspiracy question. See Burbage v. Burbage, 447 S.W.3d 249, 255-56\n(Tex. 2014) (“Thus, in Casteel, we required a new trial when a timely and specific objection preserved the\nissue of erroneous commingling of valid and invalid theories of liability in a broad-form liability question,\nsuch that the appellate court could not determine whether the jury based its verdict on an improperly\nsubmitted theory. . . . [I]n situations where a party does not raise a Casteel-type objection, that party surely\ncannot raise a Casteel issue when it failed to preserve a claim of an invalid theory of liability that forms the\nbasis of a Casteel-type error.”). Rather, Walker, Wilson, and Few Ready Mix objected that the conspiracy\nquestion was not supported by the evidence and that the question was duplicative of the aiding and\nabetting question associated with the breach-of-fiduciary-duty questions. As such, we conclude that this\nargument was waived. See Burbage, 447 S.W.3d at 255-56.\n\nPike, et al. v. Tex. EMC Mgmt., LLC, et al.                                                            Page 16\n\f        “A reviewing court may reverse a lower-court judgment under the cumulative-\n\nerror doctrine when the record shows a number of instances or error, no one instance\n\nbeing sufficient to call for reversal, yet all instances taken together may do so.” Rhey v.\n\nRedic, 408 S.W.3d 440, 462 (Tex. App.—El Paso 2013, no pet.) (citing Sproles Motor Freight\n\nLines, Inc. v. Long, 140 Tex. 494, 168 S.W.2d 642, 645 (1943); Univ. of Tex. at Austin v. Hinton,\n\n822 S.W.2d 197, 205 (Tex. App.—Austin 1991, no writ)). “To show cumulative error, an\n\nappellant must show that, based on the record as a whole, but for the alleged errors, the\n\njury would have rendered a verdict favorable to it.” Id. (citing Hinton, 822 S.W.2d at 205).\n\nB.      Discussion\n\n        In this issue, Walker, Wilson, and Few Ready Mix point to several instances that\n\nthey assert demonstrate cumulative error. Specifically, they complain that the trial court\n\nimproperly: (1) included fiduciary-duty questions in the charge; (2) admitted Plaintiff’s\n\nExhibit 129 into evidence over their objection; (3) overruled their motion for directed\n\nverdict on several claims; and (4) allowed questioning about the failure to disclose\n\ndiscussions surrounding the purchase of the EMC Products note. Based on our review\n\nof the record and our analysis of prior issues, there is sufficient evidence to support the\n\njury’s liability findings against Walker, Wilson, and Few Ready Mix. And as such, we\n\ncannot say that, based on the record as a whole, but for the alleged errors, the jury would\n\nhave rendered a verdict in favor of Walker, Wilson and Few Ready Mix. See Long, 168\n\nS.W.2d at 645; see also Rhey, 408 S.W.3d at 462; Hinton, 822 S.W.2d at 205. Accordingly,\n\n\nPike, et al. v. Tex. EMC Mgmt., LLC, et al.                                              Page 17\n\fWalker, Wilson, and Few Ready Mix have not satisfied their burden in this issue. See\n\nLong, 168 S.W.2d at 645; see also Rhey, 408 S.W.3d at 462; Hinton, 822 S.W.2d at 205. We\n\noverrule Walker, Wilson, and Few Ready Mix’s fourth issue.\n\n                              V.       TRADE-SECRET MISAPPROPRIATION\n\n        In their first issue, VHSC and Pike assert that EMC Cement’s trade-secret claim\n\nfails as a matter of law.\n\nA.      Applicable Law\n\n        A trade secret is “any formula, pattern, device or compilation of information which\n\nis used in one’s business and presents an opportunity to obtain an advantage over\n\ncompetitors who do not know or use it.” In re Bass, 113 S.W.3d 735, 739 (Tex. 2003).\n\n“There must be a substantial amount of attendant secrecy for information to be a trade\n\nsecret.” Sw. Energy Prod. Co. v. Berry-Helfand, 411 S.W.3d 581, 597 (Tex. App.—Tyler 2013,\n\npet. granted) (citing Rugen v. Interactive Bus. Sys., Inc., 864 S.W.2d 548, 552 (Tex. App.—\n\nDallas 1993, no writ)). “[A] trade secret can exist in a combination of characteristics and\n\ncomponents[,] each of which, by itself, is in the public domain, but the unified process,\n\n[the] design and operation of which in unique combination[] affords a competitive\n\nadvantage, is a protected trade secret.” Id. (citing Metallurgical Indus. v. Fourtek, Inc., 790\n\nF.2d 1195, 1202 (5th Cir. 1986)). “A trade secret is not necessarily destroyed by a\n\ndisclosure, but, in disclosing a trade secret, the owner must establish a confidential\n\nrelationship with the other party, by contract or otherwise, or the secret will be lost by\n\n\nPike, et al. v. Tex. EMC Mgmt., LLC, et al.                                             Page 18\n\fthe disclosure.” Id. (citing Furr’s, Inc. v. United Specialty Adver. Co., 385 S.W.2d 456, 459\n\n(Tex. App.—El Paso 1964, writ ref’d n.r.e.). With respect to “use,” Texas law has adopted\n\nthe Restatement definition:\n\n        Any exploitation of the trade secret that is likely to result in injury to the\n        trade secret owner or enrichment to the defendant is a “use” under this\n        Section. Thus, marketing goods that embody the trade secret, employing\n        the trade secret in manufacturing or production, relying on the trade secret\n        to assist or accelerate research or development, or soliciting customers\n        through the use of information that is a trade secret . . . all constitute “use.”\n\nBohnsack v. Varco, L.P., 668 F.3d 262, 279 (5th Cir. 2012) (quoting RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF\n\nUNFAIR COMPETITION § 40 cmt. c (1995)); see Sw. Energy Prod. Co., 411 S.W.3d at 597.\n\n        Under Texas law, trade-secret misappropriation requires: (1) the existence of a\n\ntrade secret; (2) a breach of a confidential relationship or improper discovery of the trade\n\nsecret; (3) use of the trade secret; and (4) damages. See Bohnsack, 668 F.3d at 279; see also\n\nTrilogy Software, Inc. v. Callidus Software, Inc., 143 S.W.3d 452, 463 (Tex. App.—Austin\n\n2004, pet. denied); IBP, Inc. v. Klumpe, 101 S.W.3d 461, 476 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 2001,\n\npet. denied). Proof of trade-secret misappropriation often depends upon circumstantial\n\nevidence. Sw. Energy Prod. Co., 411 S.W.3d at 598 (citing SI Handling Sys., Inc. v. Heisley,\n\n753 F.2d 1244, 1261 (3d Cir. 1985)).\n\nB.      Discussion\n\n        At trial, Ronin testified about the information that EMC Cement maintained as\n\ntrade secrets and about specific documents that contained trade-secret information.\n\nSpecifically, Ronin described confidential Mill Records and test reports from 2010 that\nPike, et al. v. Tex. EMC Mgmt., LLC, et al.                                                 Page 19\n\fcontain specific details about EMC Cement processes. Ronin explained that the records\n\nshow the test results of processing materials through high-energy vibratory-ball mills\n\n(“VBM”) under different conditions. According to Ronin, the tests show that changing\n\nthe speed at which fly ash is fed through the mill affects the final product. Additionally,\n\nthe tests indicate the effects of varying the size and weight of the grinding media, the\n\nparticle size of the fly ash, and the configuration of the openings on the mill wall. Ronin\n\ntestified that these test results and records were not intended to be disclosed to the public\n\nbecause they were trade secrets.\n\n        Ronin also explained the he did fill out a patent application for the VBMs, but that\n\nhe purposely excluded certain information to prevent it from being released to the public.\n\nRonin noted that: “We didn’t include information related to an exact positioning of the\n\nopenings, an exact configuration of the openings, an exact size of the openings related to\n\ndifferent rates, through capacities of the mill. So this whole element you always keep it\n\nout like the trade secret—know how.” He denied including the aforementioned Mill\n\nRecords and reports from 2010 in the patent application.\n\n        In later testimony, Ronin stated that EMC Cement maintained information as trade\n\nsecrets about the grinding media—i.e., the ceramic balls—within the mills, the frequency\n\nand amplitude of the mill’s vibrations, data regarding the alteration of fly ash in the mill,\n\nand the results of performance tests on two EMC products, CemPozz and PozzoSlag.\n\nRonin also testified that these trade secrets gave EMC Cement a competitive advantage\n\n\nPike, et al. v. Tex. EMC Mgmt., LLC, et al.                                           Page 20\n\fover its competitors in the cement industry because EMC Cement was the “one company\n\nwho’s doing this” and that EMC Cement had always taken measures to protect and guard\n\nthe secrecy of the trade-secret information.\n\n        The record reflects that Pike, the former general manager of EMC Products who\n\neventually became President of VHSC, included the Mill Records in the patent\n\napplication he filed on May 6, 2011, just three days after VHSC acquired the EMC assets\n\nat the foreclosure. With regard to the Mill Records, Pike testified that “[t]he data\n\nbelonged to Texas EMC but what we did with that data and how we modified that mill,\n\nparticularly the mill, I felt like it was the mill modification nothing to do with the\n\nprocess.” Nevertheless, Pike admitted that this information was EMC’s trade secrets and\n\nthat it contained highly-sensitive information.\n\n        Based on our review of the evidence, a rational factfinder could conclude that EMC\n\nCement identified its trade secrets at trial; that Pike used his position at EMC Products to\n\nobtain the trade-secret information that ultimately benefitted his new employer, VHSC—\n\na competitor of EMC Products; that Pike used the information in his patent application\n\nand VHSC used the information to produce cement subsequent to the foreclosure sale;\n\nand that the use of the trade-secret information caused EMC Cement damage. See\n\nBohnsack, 668 F.3d at 279; Sw. Energy Prod. Co., 411 S.W.3d at 598; Trilogy Software, Inc.,\n\n143 S.W.3d at 463; Klumpe, 101 S.W.3d at 476. Therefore, viewing the evidence in the light\n\nmost favorable to the jury’s verdict, we conclude that the trade-secret-misappropriation\n\n\nPike, et al. v. Tex. EMC Mgmt., LLC, et al.                                          Page 21\n\ffinding is supported by legally-sufficient evidence. See Reyes, 272 S.W.3d at 592; City of\n\nKeller, 168 S.W.3d at 822; see also Bohnsack, 668 F.3d at 279; Sw. Energy Prod. Co., 411 S.W.3d\n\nat 598; Trilogy Software, Inc., 143 S.W.3d at 463; Klumpe, 101 S.W.3d at 476. Additionally,\n\nwe cannot say that the jury’s verdict as to this claim is so contrary to the overwhelming\n\nweight of the evidence as to be clearly wrong and unjust. See Cain, 709 S.W.2d at 176.\n\nThus, we further conclude that the jury’s finding as to this claim is supported by factually-\n\nsufficient evidence. See id.\n\n        However, despite our conclusion that the jury’s finding on the trade-secret-\n\nmisappropriation claim is supported by legally- and factually-sufficient evidence, VHSC\n\nand Pike contend that EMC Cement consistently disclosed its “secret” technology in\n\npatent applications and public materials; therefore, there was no trade secret to\n\nmisappropriate. In addition, VHSC and Pike allege that they were authorized to use any\n\ntrade secrets that EMC Cement might have had based on licenses acquired in the\n\nforeclosure sale.\n\n        The record includes testimony from Ronin, the inventor of the process, about the\n\nmethods and tools he developed over time for activating fly ash and the data collected\n\nfrom years of experimentation. And as outlined above, information related to the unique\n\nconfiguration, use, and maintenance of the VBMs used to produce CemPozz and\n\nPozzoSlag were kept as trade secrets within the company and were not disclosed to the\n\npublic in advertising materials or in a patent application filed by Ronin. In fact, Ronin\n\n\nPike, et al. v. Tex. EMC Mgmt., LLC, et al.                                             Page 22\n\ftestified that he purposefully excluded certain trade-secret information from his patent\n\napplication to protect it from disclosure to the public. Ronin also noted that PozzoSlag,\n\nfor example, could not be reproduced using only the information contained in the patent\n\napplication. The disputed trade-secret information was needed to replicate PozzoSlag.\n\nMoreover, the record reveals that it was Pike, not Ronin, who disclosed EMC Cement\n\ntrade-secret information to the public via his patent application.\n\n        In addition, we are not persuaded by VHSC and Pike’s contention that they were\n\nauthorized to use EMC Cement’s trade secrets by virtue of the licenses acquired in the\n\nforeclosure sale. The Deed of Trust acquired after the foreclosure sale provided the\n\nfollowing definition for “Contracts”:         [A]ll of the right, title and interest of [EMC\n\nProducts], including equitable rights, in, to, and under any and all . . . contracts, licenses,\n\nor permits which are directly or indirectly related to, or connected with, the development,\n\nownership, maintenance or operation of the [cement plant].” Despite this language,\n\nLygren testified that EMC Cement terminated the License Agreement before the\n\nforeclosure sale. To corroborate Lygren’s testimony, appellees included an email dated\n\nApril 20, 2011, notifying Walker that EMC Products’ rights under the License Agreement\n\nwith EMC Cement had been cancelled. Therefore, at the time of the foreclosure sale, EMC\n\nProducts had no license to convey to VHSC, and thus, VHSC could not have acquired use\n\nof EMC Cement’s trade secrets by virtue of the License Agreement. Accordingly, we\n\n\n\n\nPike, et al. v. Tex. EMC Mgmt., LLC, et al.                                             Page 23\n\freject VHSC and Pike’s arguments with regard to the trade-secret-misappropriation\n\nfinding and overrule their first issue.\n\n          VI.      BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORTIOUS INTERFERENCE WITH AN EXISTING\n                                   CONTRACT, & CONSPIRACY\n\n        In their second issue, VHSC and Pike argue that appellees’ tortious-interference,\n\nbreach-of-contract, and conspiracy claims fail as a matter of law.\n\nA.      Applicable Law\n\n        The elements of a breach-of-contract claim are: (1) the existence of a valid contract\n\nbetween plaintiff and defendant; (2) the plaintiff’s performance or tender of performance;\n\n(3) the defendant’s breach of the contract; and (4) the plaintiff’s damage as a result of the\n\nbreach. Runge v. Raytheon E-Systems, Inc., 57 S.W.3d 562, 565 (Tex. App.—Waco 2001, no\n\npet.). On the other hand, the elements for a cause of action for tortious interference with\n\na contract are: (1) an existing contract subject to interference; (2) a willful and intentional\n\nact of interference with the contract; (3) that proximately caused the plaintiff’s injury; and\n\n(4) caused actual damage or loss. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am. v. Fin. Review Servs., Inc., 29\n\nS.W.3d 74, 77 (Tex. 2000).\n\nB.      Discussion\n\n        In 2006, appellees hired Pike as the general manager to oversee day-to-day\n\noperations for EMC Products.

Page 26\n\f        to it by the other for any purpose other than as contemplated by this\n        Agreement without the prior written consent of the other.\n\n        As stated earlier, VHSC was formed on April 28, 2011, just a few days prior to the\n\nscheduled foreclosure sale of EMC Products’ assets. At the May 3, 2011 foreclosure sale,\n\nVHSC acquired EMC Products’ assets. On May 5, 2011, Pike resigned from EMC\n\nProducts and immediately went to work for VHSC as its president. The following day,\n\nVHSC filed a patent application naming Pike as the sole inventor. Testimony revealed\n\nthat the substance of the patent application was based on Ronin and EMC Cement’s\n\ntechnology and trade secrets. Even Pike admitted at trial that he gave VHSC highly-\n\nsensitive trade-secret information from EMC Cement. Pike further acknowledged that\n\nhe filed the patent application containing trade-secret information because he was upset\n\nwith Lygren and Ronin.\n\n        Pike later testified that Preston approached him the day after the foreclosure sale\n\nand suggested that he apply for a patent for EMC Products’ technology and information\n\nand assign the patent to VHSC.                Pike gathered “a stack” of material containing\n\ninformation that he and Ronin had spent eighteen months preparing and faxed the\n\ninformation to VHSC’s patent attorney on May 5, 2011. A day later, VHSC filed the patent\n\napplication with twenty-five patent claims. In support of their contention that VHSC\n\ninterfered with Pike’s Management Agreement by inducing Pike to divulge confidential\n\ntrade-secret information obtained from EMC Products prior to the May 3, 2011\n\nforeclosure sale, appellees asked Ronin, the owner of twenty-seven patents, how long the\nPike, et al. v. Tex. EMC Mgmt., LLC, et al.                                           Page 27\n\fprocess is for filing a patent. Ronin responded, “[u]sually takes—if you’re really focused\n\non that, between four and six weeks when you have all experimental data.”\n\n        Based on the foregoing, and viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to\n\nthe jury’s verdict, we conclude that a rational factfinder could conclude that Pike\n\nbreached the Management Agreement by providing VHSC with trade-secret information\n\nobtained during his employment with EMC Products.6 Accordingly, we hold that the\n\nevidence supporting the jury’s finding that Pike breached the Management Agreement is\n\nlegally sufficient. See Reyes, 272 S.W.3d at 592; City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 822; see also\n\nRunge, 57 S.W.3d at 565. Additionally, we cannot say that the jury’s verdict as to this\n\nclaim is so contrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence as to be clearly wrong\n\nand unjust. See Cain, 709 S.W.2d at 176. Thus, we further conclude that the jury’s finding\n\nas to this claim is supported by factually-sufficient evidence. See id.\n\n        However, our analysis of this issue does not stop there. VHSC also challenges the\n\njury’s tortious-interference finding, asserting four arguments: (1) EMC Products lacks\n\nstanding to assert the tortious-interference claim because it currently has no interest in\n\nthe Management Agreement; (2) VHSC could not interfere with the Management\n\nAgreement because VHSC acquired EMC Products’ assets in the foreclosure sale; (3)\n\n\n\n        6Pike also makes a standing argument in this issue, which hinges on the assumption that the breach\ntranspired after the foreclosure sale. However, we reject this argument because we conclude that the jury\ncould have determined that the breach of the Management Agreement transpired prior to the foreclosure\nsale. Accordingly, appellees had a “justiciable interest” in the outcome at the time the breach occurred. See\nAustin Nursing Ctr., Inc. v. Lovato, 171 S.W.3d 845, 848 (Tex. 2005).\n\nPike, et al. v. Tex. EMC Mgmt., LLC, et al.                                                         Page 28\n\fVHSC had a license to use the confidential information; and (4) VHSC’s actions were\n\njustified because it acquired the License and Management Agreements in the foreclosure\n\nsale. Each of these arguments is premised on a faulty assumption—that appellees’\n\ntortious-interference claim is based on events that occurred after the May 3, 2011\n\nforeclosure sale. In Question No. 8 of the charge, the jury was asked: “Did VHSC\n\nintentionally interfere with Pike’s Management Agreement prior to May 4, 2011?” The\n\njury answered Question No. 8 in the affirmative. And based on the evidence outlined\n\nabove with respect to Pike’s Management Agreement, a rational factfinder could have\n\nconcluded that VHSC induced Pike to share EMC Cement’s confidential information—\n\nan act that was prohibited by Pike’s Management Agreement—long before the\n\nforeclosure sale for purposes of filing the patent application and to produce and market\n\nVHSC cement. We therefore conclude that the evidence contains legally- and factually-\n\nsufficient evidence to support the jury’s finding that VHSC tortiously interfered with\n\nPike’s Management Agreement. See Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 29 S.W.3d at 77; see also\n\nReyes, 272 S.W.3d at 592; City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 822; Cain, 709 S.W.2d at 176.\n\n        And finally, VHSC and Pike also challenge the jury’s conspiracy finding. While\n\nwe agree that Pike cannot be liable for interfering with his own Management Agreement,\n\nsee, e.g., In re Vesta Ins. Group, Inc., 192 S.W.3d 759, 761 (Tex. 2006), we note that we have\n\nalready determined that legally- and factually-sufficient evidence supports the jury’s\n\nfinding that VHSC and Pike misappropriated EMC Cement’s trade secrets and that\n\n\nPike, et al. v. Tex. EMC Mgmt., LLC, et al.                                             Page 29\n\fVHSC tortiously interfered with Pike’s Management Agreement. Thus, VHSC and Pike’s\n\nliability is not based on the jury’s conspiracy finding, but on findings of direct liability.\n\nNevertheless, throughout this memorandum opinion, we document VHSC and Pike’s\n\ninvolvement in the conspiracy to default on EMC Products’ loans, sell EMC Products’\n\nassets at a foreclosure sale, and form a new company, VHSC, using the trade-secret\n\ninformation and technology obtained from EMC Cement.\n\n         As stated earlier, “once a civil conspiracy is found, each co-conspirator is\n\nresponsible for the action of any of the co-conspirators which is in furtherance of the\n\nunlawful combination.”           Akin, 661 S.W.2d at 921; see Carroll, 592 S.W.2d at 926.\n\nAdditionally, because we have upheld the jury’s conspiracy finding, all co-conspirators\n\nare jointly and severally liable for actual damages resulting from acts in furtherance of\n\nthe conspiracy. See Carroll, 592 S.W.2d at 925-26; Sandt, 401 S.W.3d at 220 (“The concept\n\nof civil conspiracy is sometimes used by a plaintiff as a basis for establishing joint and\n\nseveral liability among several defendants, some of whom may not have committed a tort\n\nby their own conduct.”); Moody, 161 S.W.3d at 90. Accordingly, we conclude that the\n\njury’s conspiracy finding against VHSC and Pike is supported by legally- and factually-\n\nsufficient evidence. See Akin, 661 S.W.2d at 921; Carroll, 592 S.W.2d at 296; Sandt, 401\n\nS.W.3d at 220; Moody, 161 S.W.3d at 90; see also Reyes, 272 S.W.3d at 592; City of Keller, 168\n\nS.W.3d at 822; Cain, 709 S.W.2d at 176. We therefore overrule VHSC and Pike’s second\n\nissue.\n\n\nPike, et al. v. Tex. EMC Mgmt., LLC, et al.                                            Page 30\n\f                        VII.     THE DAMAGES & ATTORNEY’S FEES AWARDS7\n\n        In their third through fifth issues, VHSC and Pike make numerous challenges to\n\nthe damages award. Specifically, they assert that the evidence supporting the damages\n\naward is conclusory and speculative and, thus, is not sufficient. Additionally, they\n\ncontend that appellees’ damage model is not competent evidence; the record contains no\n\nevidence of “costs saved” damages; the trial court’s judgment improperly allowed\n\nappellees to recover multiple times for the same injury; and that the trial court’s judgment\n\nincorrectly calculated the deficiency judgment. Moreover, in their first issue, Walker,\n\nWilson, and Few Ready Mix join in the arguments made by VHSC and Pike and also\n\nassert that appellees’ damage model is not a proper “lost profits” or “market value”\n\nmodel; that appellees’ expert opinions are mixed with fact and fiction and cannot support\n\nthe damages award; and that EMC Cement cannot recover under a damage model that is\n\n\n        7  On appeal, appellees argued that any damages complaints were waived pursuant to Coastal\nTransport Co. v. Crown Central Petroleum Corp., 136 S.W.3d 227 (Tex. 2004) and Maritime Overseas Corp. v.\nEllis, 971 S.W.2d 402 (Tex. 1998)—which the former held that an objection is required to challenge expert\ntestimony on the basis of underlying methodology, technique, or foundational data used by the witness.\nHowever, recent commentators have noted the following:\n\n        At the time Coastal Transport exception may have been viewed as a narrow one. But in\n        subsequent cases, the Court has defined “conclusory” and “speculative” to incorporate a\n        broad array of reliability challenges, and as a result, the Coastal Transport exception to\n        Maritime Overseas’s objection requirement has nearly swallowed the rule. Thus, in Texas,\n        appellate challenges to expert evidence are routinely raised and decided under a legal-\n        sufficiency rubric, not the admissibility rubric.\n\nHarvey Brown & Melissa Davis, Eight Gates for Expert Witnesses: Fifteen Years Later, 52 HOUS. L. REV. 1, 46-\n47 (2014); see generally Houston Unlimited, Inc. v. Mel Acres Ranch, 443 S.W.3d 820 (Tex. 2014); City of San\nAntonio v. Pollock, 284 S.W.3d 809 (Tex. 2009). Therefore, despite the fact that appellants did not object in\nthe trial court regarding damages, given the trend of allowing parties to challenge expert-witness testimony\nunder the legal-sufficiency rubric, we will address appellants’ damages complaints in this appeal.\n\nPike, et al. v. Tex. EMC Mgmt., LLC, et al.                                                          Page 31\n\fpremised on the diminished value of a partnership interest. Walker, Wilson, and Few\n\nReady Mix also challenge the attorney’s fees award.\n\nA.      Modification of the Amended Final Judgment\n\n        The Amended Final Judgment awarded the following damages:\n\n           For misappropriation of trade secrets and conspiracy, the trial court awarded\n            EMC Cement $1.5 million from VHSC, Pike, Walker, Wilson, and Few Ready\n            Mix, jointly and severally, as well as pre- and post-judgment interest.\n\n           For tortious interference with Pike’s Management Agreement, the trial court\n            awarded EMC Products $7 million from VHSC, Pike, Walker, Wilson, and Few\n            Ready Mix, jointly and severally, as well as pre- and post-judgment interest.\n\n           For breach of the Management Agreement, the trial court awarded EMC\n            Products $1 million from Pike, as well as pre- and post-judgment interest.\n\n           For breach of the Partnership Agreement, the trial court awarded EMC Cement\n            $7 million from Walker and Wilson, jointly and severally, as well as pre- and\n            post-judgment interest.\n\n           Additionally, the trial court awarded EMC Cement $580,000 in attorney’s fees\n            from Walker and Wilson, as well as attorney’s fees for appeals to this Court\n            and the Texas Supreme Court.\n\n        At the outset of our analysis, we note that appellees have conceded that Pike\n\ncannot be liable for intentionally interfering with his own contract—the Management\n\nAgreement. See In re Vesta Ins. Group, Inc., 192 S.W.3d at 761 (“The obligation not to\n\ninterfere with existing contracts is a general obligation imposed by law. But it is not\n\nimposed on the parties to that contract, as ‘a party cannot tortiously interfere with its own\n\ncontract.’” (quoting Holloway v. Skinner, 898 S.W.2d 793, 796 (Tex. 1995)) (emphasis in\n\n\n\nPike, et al. v. Tex. EMC Mgmt., LLC, et al.                                           Page 32\n\foriginal)). As such, the Amended Final Judgment should be modified to remove Pike’s\n\nliability for the tortious-interference-with-the-Management-Agreement claim.\n\nB.      Applicable Law\n\n        We now endeavor to analyze the remaining damage awards. “In determining\n\ndamages, the jury has discretion to award damages within the range of evidence\n\npresented at trial.” Gulf States Utils. Co. v. Low, 79 S.W.3d 561, 566 (Tex. 2002) (citing Price\n\nPfister, Inc. v. Moore & Kimmey, Inc., 48 S.W.3d 341, 352 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.]\n\n2001, pet. denied)). Lost profits must be shown by competent evidence with reasonable\n\ncertainty. Helena Chem. Co. v. Wilkins, 47 S.W.3d 486, 504 (Tex. 2001). At a minimum,\n\nopinions or estimates of lost profits “must be based on objective facts, figures, or data\n\nfrom which the lost-profits amount may be ascertained.” Id. In most instances, when\n\nconducting a lost-profit analysis, you look to past profits and adjust these numbers based\n\non the surrounding circumstances to determine what the lost profit for a certain time\n\nperiod should be. Tex. Instruments, Inc. v. Teletron Energy Mgmt., Inc., 877 S.W.2d 276, 279\n\n(Tex. 1994).\n\n        However, where no history of relevant past profits exists, such as the case here, a\n\nhistorically-unprofitable business must produce “some other objective data, such as\n\nfuture contracts, from which lost profits can be calculated with reasonable certainty.”\n\nHelena Chem. Co., 47 S.W.3d at 505.           “Revenue forecasting[,] as in a lost[-]income\n\nanalysis[,] must be based on objective facts or data and established to a reasonable\n\n\nPike, et al. v. Tex.

App.—El Paso\n\n2009, pet. denied) (citing Helena Chem Co., 47 S.W.3d at 505).\n\n        “When an expert opinion is admitted into evidence without objection, ‘it may be\n\nconsidered probative evidence even if the basis for the opinion is unreliable.’” Houston\n\nUnlimited, Inc. v. Mel Acres Ranch, 443 S.W.3d 820, 829 (Tex. 2014) (quoting City of San\n\nAntonio v. Pollock, 284 S.W.3d 809, 818 (Tex. 2009)). “‘But if no basis for the opinion is\n\noffered, or the basis offered provides no support, the opinion is merely a conclusory\n\nstatement and cannot be considered probative evidence, regardless of whether there is\n\nno objection.’” Id. (citing Pollock, 284 S.W.3d at 818). “This is because the evidentiary\n\nvalue of expert testimony is derived from its basis, not from the mere fact that the expert\n\nhas said it.” Id. (citations omitted).\n\nC.      Discussion\n\n        On appeal, many of appellants’ arguments on damages center on the proposition\n\nthat Lygren’s opinion is unreliable and suffers from analytical gaps because it is allegedly\n\nbased on speculation and improper data. In particular, appellants challenge Lygren’s\n\nassumption of a 19% annual growth rate through 2021, Miller’s assumption of an 11-18%\n\nannual growth rate through 2018, and projections of rising sales prices and volumes,\n\ndespite EMC Products’ track record of unprofitability.\n\n        Expert testimony is unreliable if “there is simply too great an analytical gap\n\nbetween the data [relied upon] and the opinion proffered.” Gammill v. Jack Williams\n\n\nPike, et al. v. Tex. EMC Mgmt., LLC, et al.                                          Page 34\n\fChevrolet, Inc., 972 S.W.2d 713, 726 (Tex. 1998) (internal citations omitted). An expert must\n\n“connect the data relied on and his or her opinion” and “show how that data is valid\n\nsupport for the opinion reached.” Whirlpool Corp. v. Camacho, 298 S.W.3d 631, 642 (Tex.\n\n2009) (citing Pollock, 284 S.W.3d at 819-20; Volkswagen of Am., Inc. v. Ramirez, 159 S.W.3d\n\n897, 906 (Tex. 2004); Gammill, 972 S.W.2d at 726). “We are not required . . . to ignore fatal\n\ngaps in an expert’s analysis or assertions that are simply incorrect.” Volkswagen of Am.,\n\nInc., 159 S.W.3d at 912. “A flaw in the expert’s reasoning from the data may render\n\nreliance on a study unreasonable and render the differences drawn therefrom dubious.\n\nUnder that circumstance, the expert’s scientific testimony is unreliable and, legally, no\n\nevidence.” Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc. v. Havner, 953 S.W.2d 706, 714 (Tex. 1997).\n\n        1.      Lygren’s Testimony About the Value of EMC Products\n\n        At trial, Lygren testified that the value of the Texas EMC business related to the\n\nJewett plant, including EMC technology was “about $12 million, excluding the value of\n\nthe plant itself” before the foreclosure sale. After the foreclosure sale, the business was\n\nvalued at zero. Later, Lygren stated that the value of the plant as carried on the books of\n\nEMC Products as of March 2011 was “about $4 million.” Lygren purportedly arrived at\n\nthese values based on two theories: (1) a comparison of EMC Products’ operation in\n\nTexas to the proposed partnership with C-Change in California; and (2) EMC Products’\n\nfinancial records from 2006-2010, Pike’s projections about future growth, historical\n\nrecords of cement sales in Texas, and generally-accepted accounting methods.\n\n\nPike, et al. v. Tex. EMC Mgmt., LLC, et al.                                           Page 35\n\fLygren’s assessment that the business had fair-market value of $12 million prior to the\n\nforeclosure sale was based on an evaluation of EMC Products’ projected EBITDA8 for the\n\nyears 2011 through 2020. Lygren, an individual with a Bachelor of Science in Business\n\nfrom the Norwegian School of Business and over forty years’ of experience in business,\n\ntestified that EBITDA is recognized and commonly used for assessing the value of a\n\nbusiness. Appellants’ damages expert, Todd Burchett, agreed that an EBITDA-based\n\nanalysis is an acceptable valuation methodology, though he asserted that the\n\nmethodology was not properly applied in this case.\n\n        In any event, Lygren noted that he arrived at his valuation by considering the\n\nfollowing: (1) EMC Products’ financial statements from 2006-10, which notably reflected\n\npositive EBITDA figures; (2) Federal Accounting Standards and Procedures; (3)\n\nInternational Private Equity Fund and Venture Capital Guidelines; (4) Pike’s projections\n\nfor EMC Products’ earnings and expenses for 2011; (5) American Coal Ash Association\n\nreports on consumption and production of fly ash in the United States; (6) United States\n\nGeological Survey reports on cement consumption in Texas; and (7) deposition testimony\n\nof Walker. Using this information, Lygren made the following determinations: (1) the\n\namount of Portland Cement that was sold in Texas from 2005-2012; (2) the market\n\npotential for CemPozz, a substitute product for Portland Cement; (3) market penetration\n\n\n\n\n        8 EBITDA is described as the business’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and\namortization.\n\nPike, et al. v.

Page 36\n\ffor CemPozz from 2005-2010, which Lygren characterized as having “significant upside\n\npotential”; (4) EMC Products’ average EBITDA from 2006-2010 as $458,003;9 (5) the\n\nvolume of products EMC Products would have sold in 2011 (86,273 tons); (6) the price\n\nper ton sale price EMC Products would have received in 2011 ($52.97), based on sales\n\nprices from 2006-10; (7) cost of goods sold per ton for 2011 ($34.52), based on costs from\n\n2006-10; and (8) administrative, sales, and marketing costs for 2011, based on Pike’s\n\nestimates ($573,328 for general administrative expenses and $199,291 for sales and\n\nmarketing). Using these figures, Lygren extrapolated that EMC Products would have\n\nhad an EBITDA of $819,083 for 2011. When using a 20% inflation rate to discount cash\n\nflows over a nine-year period, Lygren calculated the net present value of the EBITDA of\n\n2011 to be $682,569.\n\n        Next, Lygren projected a 19% annual increase in sales volume from 2012 through\n\n2020. This projection was based on a 48% increase in sales volume that Pike estimated\n\nfor 2011 over 2010 and EMC Products’ historical market penetration, which was small at\n\nthe time of the foreclosure sale. Additionally, Lygren projected the selling price per ton\n\nthat EMC Products would receive for sales from 2012 through 2020, based on prices from\n\n2005 to 2010. The price projections increased from $55.26 per ton in 2012 to $73.61 per ton\n\nin 2020. Lygren did the same for cost of goods sold and administrative, sales, and\n\n\n\n\n        9 Lygren recounted that EMC Products’ EBITDA for 2006-10 was as follows: (1) $506,149 for 2006;\n(2) $745,071 for 2007; (3) $389,914 for 2008; (4) $461,499 for 2009; and (5) $187,308 for 2010.\n\nPike, et al. v.

With respect to administrative, sales, and\n\nmarketing costs, Lygren applied a 1.5% inflation rate. From these figures, Lygren derived\n\na yearly EBITDA for 2012 through 2020, and after applying the previously-mentioned\n\n20% discount rate, Lygren determined the present value of the EBITDA figures for 2012\n\nthrough 2020.\n\n        Based on the foregoing testimony, we cannot say that Lygren’s testimony was\n\nunreliable on its face.

Given the number of sources Lygren relied upon and Lygren’s\n\nextensive testimony explaining how he arrived at his valuation, we do not believe that\n\nLygren’s testimony about the valuation of the business constituted ipse dixit.

Testimony About Misappropriation-of-Trade-Secret Damages\n\n        Appellants also complain about Lygren’s testimony regarding damages sustained\n\nfor misappropriation of trade secrets.\n\n        Damages in trade secret cases can take a variety of forms. The variety of\n        approaches demonstrates the flexible and imaginative methods employed.\n        The methods used to calculate damages include the value of the plaintiff’s\n        lost profits; the defendant’s actual profits from the use of the secret; the\n        value that a reasonably prudent investor would have paid for the trade\n        secret; the development costs the defendant avoided by the\n        misappropriation; and a “reasonable royalty.” Courts adjust the measure\n        of damages to accord with the commercial setting of the injury, the likely\n        future consequences of the misappropriation, and the nature and extent of\n        the defendant’s use of the trade secret. Each case is controlled by its own\n        peculiar facts and circumstances.\n\nSw. Energy Prod. Co., 411 S.W.3d at 608-09 (internal citations & quotations omitted).\n\n        The law does not require absolute certainty as to the amount of lost profit.\n        While damages may not be determined by mere speculation or guess, it will\nPike, et al. v.

App.—Houston\n\n[14th Dist.] 1988, no writ); see Szczepanik v. First S. Trust Co., 883 S.W.2d 648, 649 (Tex.\n\n1994) (per curiam); see also Wellogix, Inc. v. Accenture, L.L.P., No. 11-20816, 2013 U.S. App.\n\nLEXIS 25944, at **22-27 (5th Cir. May 15, 2013).\n\n        In the instant case, the jury was tasked with determining EMC Cement’s trade-\n\nsecret damages based on “the costs saved by VHSC as a result of its use . . . of the Trade\n\nSecrets in Texas” and the value of the use of the trade secrets to a reasonably-prudent\n\ninvestor. The record evidence reflects that EMC Cement’s technology and trade secrets\n\nwere developed for many years at a cost of millions of dollars. Lygren noted that he\n\npersonally invested $20 million in the development of technology that ultimately resulted\n\nin the CemPozz and PozzoSlag products.\n\n        Presumably, VHSC saved some on development costs, especially given that we\n\nhave affirmed VHSC’s liability under appellees’ misappropriation-of-trade-secrets claim.\n\nHowever, appellees do not direct us to record evidence reflecting the amount of\n\ndevelopment costs saved by VHSC as a result of the misappropriation.                Lygren’s\n\ntestimony about his personal investment in the entire EMC business is not enough to\n\nsupport the jury’s conclusion that VHSC saved $1.5 million in development costs as a\n\nresult of the misappropriation of EMC Cement’s trade secrets. See Houston Mercantile\n\nExch. Corp. v. Dailey Petroleum Corp., 930 S.W.2d 242, 248 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.]\nPike, et al. v. Tex.

Page 40\n\f1996, no writ) (finding that, as a threshold requirement to recovering damages in trade-\n\nsecret and unfair-competition claims, “a plaintiff must produce evidence from which the\n\njury may reasonably infer that the damages sued for have resulted from the conduct of\n\nthe defendant.”). Lygren’s personal investment could have been used to finance other\n\nbusiness expenses across EMC’s entire business enterprise just as easily as it could have\n\nbeen used to finance trade-secret technology. See MGE UPS Sys. v. GE Consumer & Indus.,\n\nInc., 622 F.3d 361, 369 (5th Cir. 2010) (applying Texas law, and finding no evidence of\n\ntrade-secret damages where “MGE has not presented evidence that provides any means\n\nof distinguishing revenue PMI gained from other sources from revenue gained through\n\nmisappropriation of MGE’s trade secrets, let alone a calculation of profits from the\n\nrelevant portion of revenue”) And though damages in trade-secret cases can be flexible\n\nand imaginative, appellees have not proffered sufficient evidence for the jury to have\n\nmade a just and reasonable inference regarding development costs saved by VHSC. See\n\nSzczepanik, 883 S.W.2d at 649; Sw. Energy Prod. Co., 411 S.W.3d at 608-09; Houston\n\nMercantile Exch.

Paula’s Miller’s Expert Testimony\n\n        Appellees also presented the testimony of Paula Miller, by deposition, regarding\n\nthe value of EMC Products. Miller is a financial consultant with an MBA in finance and\n\na Master of Science in accounting. Previously, Miller worked for Coopers & Lybrand and\n\nhas had her own consulting firm since 1996. In her deposition testimony, Miller reviewed\n\nEMC Products’ balance sheets, profit-and-loss statements, and EBITDA statements from\n\n2003 through March of 2011. Miller asserted that she applied general business valuation\n\nstandards of the American Society of Appraisers and the American Institute of Certified\n\nPublic Accountants in arriving at her valuation of the business. Miller recounted that she\n\nused the EBITDA figures from 2006 through March of 2011 to forecast future earnings\n\n\n\n\n        10 However, despite our conclusion that the damage theory based on the development costs saved\nby VHSC is not supported by legally-sufficient evidence, we can still affirm the $1.5 million award for\nmisappropriation of trade secrets. In the charge, the jury was asked to calculate damages for\nmisappropriation of trade secrets based on: (1) the value that a reasonably prudent investor would have\npaid for use of the trade secrets in Texas; and (2) development costs saved by VHSC. In its order granting,\nin part, appellants’ motion for JNOV, the trial court set aside the jury’s $1.5 million award with respect to\nthe value a reasonably prudent investor would have paid for use of the trade secrets in Texas. We believe\nthat the trial court erred in setting aside that finding. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 301; see also Tanner v. Nationwide\nMut. Fire Ins. Co., 289 S.W.3d 828, 830 (Tex. 2009); Brown v. Bank of Galveston, 963 S.W.2d 511, 513 (Tex. 1998).\nInstead, as shown above, the trial court should have set aside the finding premised on development costs\nsaved. Because the trial court erred, we reverse the portion of the JNOV setting aside the jury’s finding in\nQuestion 2(a) of the jury charge and reinstate that finding as support for appellees’ misappropriation-of-\ntrade-secrets claim. See John Masek Corp. v. Davis, 848 S.W.2d 170, 173 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1992,\nwrit denied) (noting that if there is more than a scintilla of competent evidence to support the jury’s\nfindings, the JNOV will be reversed) (citing Navarette v. Temple Indep. Sch. Dist., 706 S.W.2d 308, 309 (Tex.\n1986)).\n\nPike, et al. v. Tex. EMC Mgmt., LLC, et al.                                                             Page 42\n\fbased on a seven-year business cycle and determined that the fair market value of EMC\n\nProducts in May 2011 was approximately $5.3 million, not including plant and\n\nequipment.\n\n        As was the case with Lygren, appellants challenge Miller’s testimony on the\n\nground that it is unreliable because it is based on faulty data. And similar to Lygren,\n\nappellants did not raise this challenge during trial or when either Lygren or Miller\n\ntestified. Nevertheless, like Lygren, we cannot say that Miller’s testimony was unreliable\n\non its face. See Beaumont, 205 S.W.3d at 621; Durham Transp. Co., 201 S.W.3d at 868 n.5; see\n\nalso Lockhart, 2013 Tex. App. LEXIS 4075, at **30-31. Miller’s testimony was based on\n\nwidely-accepted EBITDA-valuation methodology and was supported by data, including\n\nEMC Products’ financial records. Furthermore, Miller linked the basis of her testimony\n\nwith her conclusions about the value of the business. We therefore cannot say that\n\nMiller’s testimony was founded on unsupported assumptions and, thus, incompetent.\n\nSee Earle, 998 S.W.2d at 890; see also Justiss, 397 S.W.3d at 156; Havner, 953 S.W.2d at 712.\n\n        4.      Harry Swanstrom’s Testimony\n\n        The record reflects that Harry Swanstrom and his company, Swanstrom\n\nEngineering, designed, built, and acquired equipment for EMC Products’ plant in 2003.\n\nSwanstrom continued to work on the plant through at least 2005. At trial, Swanstrom\n\ntestified that the value of the plant and equipment was $4.1 million in May 2011, when\n\n\n\n\nPike, et al. v. Tex. EMC Mgmt., LLC, et al.                                            Page 43\n\fthe foreclosure sale took place—a figure roughly 75% of the price VHSC paid for EMC\n\nProducts’ assets at a foreclosure sale.\n\n        On appeal, appellant challenge Swanstrom’s testimony on two grounds: (1) his\n\nmethod; and (2) the reliability of his evidence. Specifically, with respect to Swanstrom’s\n\nmethod, appellants contend that he improperly used the replacement value of the\n\nequipment as a basis for his opinion.\n\n        “Fair market value has been defined as ‘the price which the property would bring\n\nwhen it is offered for sale by one who desires, but is not obliged to sell, and is bought by\n\none who is under no necessity of buying it.’” Burns v. Rochon, 190 S.W.3d 263, 270 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2006, no pet.) (quoting City of Austin v. Cannizzo, 153 Tex. 324,\n\n267 S.W.2d 808, 815 (1954)). However, when property has no readily ascertainable fair\n\nmarket value, “the measure of damages is the actual value of the property to the owner\n\nat the time of its loss.” Id. (citing Crisp v. Sec. Nat’l Ins. Co., 369 S.W.2d 326 (Tex. 1963)).\n\n“The actual value measure of damages has frequently been employed in cases of\n\nconversion involving furniture and equipment used in the operation of restaurants and\n\nbars.” Id. (citations omitted).\n\n        In determining both fair market value and actual value, courts have\n        considered the purchase price paid by an owner, particularly when\n        evidence of the purchase price is neither objected to nor controverted. See\n        Wutke v. Yolton, 71 S.W.2d 549, 552 (Tex. Civ. App.—Beaumont 1934, writ\n        ref’d) (holding that purchase price is probative of actual value); San Antonio\n        Pub. Serv. Co. v. Murray, 59 S.W.2d 851, 854 (Tex. Civ. App.—Beaumont\n        1933) (holding that purchase price is probative of fair market value when it\n        is the only evidence admitted regarding value and its admission is not\nPike, et al. v.

No matter what measure of damages is employed in\n        establishing the value of the converted property, “it is well settled that the\n        owner of property can testify as to his opinion regarding the value of his\n        own property . . . even if the owner’s testimony is halting and indefinite it\n        nonetheless will be sufficient to sustain a verdict when there is no\n        controverting evidence.” Espinosa v. Schomberg, 601 S.W.2d 161, 164 (Tex.\n        Civ. App.—Waco 1980, writ ref’d n.r.e.).\n\nId. at 270-71.\n\n        Here, Swanstrom testified that there was no way to establish a fair market value\n\nfor the used equipment in the facility. Accordingly, he based his opinion on the purchase\n\nprice of the equipment, plus a 20% escalation factor that he applied based on his\n\nexperience in pricing equipment. This testimony was offered without objection, and it\n\nwas unrebutted. Therefore, in light of Burns and other case law cited above, we cannot\n\nsay that the measure of damages used by Swanstrom was improper. See id. at 270-71; see\n\nalso Yolton, 71 S.W.2d at 552; Murray, 59 S.W.2d at 854.\n\n        Additionally, appellants contend that Swanstrom’s testimony was unreliable. We\n\nreject this argument as the record indicates that Swanstrom based his testimony on his\n\nexperience both in pricing equipment and as the designer and builder of the plant\n\nequipment involved in this case. Thus, we conclude that Swanstrom sufficiently linked\n\nhis testimony with his conclusions regarding the value of the plant equipment. See Earle,\n\n998 S.W.2d at 890; see also Justiss, 397 S.W.3d at 156; Havner, 953 S.W.2d at 712.\n\n        5.       The One-Satisfaction Rule\n\n\n\n\nPike, et al. v. Tex.

Co. v. Sterling, 822 S.W.2d\n\n1, 8 (Tex. 1991); see Tony Gullo Motors I, L.P. v. Chapa, 212 S.W.3d 299, 303 (Tex. 2006).\n\nHowever, “a ‘jury’s award is not duplicative simply because it allocated damages under\n\ntwo distinct causes of action.” Aspen Tech., Inc. v. M3 Tech, Inc., 569 F. App’x 259, 271 (5th\n\nCir. 2014) (not designated for publication) (quoting Indu Craft, Inc. v. Bank of Baroda, 47\n\nF.3d 490, 497 (2d Cir. 1995)); see DSC Comm’cns Corp. v. Next Level Comm’cns, 107 F.3d 322,\n\n330 (5th Cir. 1997) (“The damage model Sears presented showed the total damages\n\nallocated to Next Level’s alleged wrongful conduct. The jury then allocated damages to\n\neach different cause of action. DSC was not obligated to precisely apportion damages for\n\neach instance of wrongful conduct it alleged, as unitary damages models are permissible\n\nunder Texas law.” (citing Bildon Farms, Inc. v. Ward County Improvement Dist., No. 2, 415\n\nS.W.2d 890, 896 (Tex. 1967))). In other words, “a court may rationally conclude that the\n\njury found that the plaintiff suffered that amount of injuries and ‘merely allocated that\n\namount between the two different causes of action.” Aspen Tech., Inc., 569 F. App’x at 271\n\n(citing Indu Craft, Inc., 47 F.3d at 497).\n\n        Here, the Amended Final Judgment awarded, among other things, $7 million to\n\nEMC Products on the claim involving tortious interference with Pike’s Management\n\nAgreement; $7 million to EMC Cement for the claim of breach of the Partnership\n\n\nPike, et al. v.

These figures were based on the aforementioned unchallenged\n\ntestimony regarding the value of the EMC Products business and assets at the time of the\n\nforeclosure sale. And based on the foregoing case law, and our affirmance of appellants’\n\nunderlying liability, the jury was entitled to allocate the damages between the three\n\ncauses of action without violating the one-satisfaction rule.

Attorney’s Fees\n\n        Next, Walker, Wilson, and Few Ready Mix challenge the attorney’s fees award,\n\narguing that the trial court should not have granted the fees because billing records were\n\nnot produced until trial; there was no proof of presentment; the fees were not segregated;\n\nand the only support for the award was the breach-of-the-Partnership-Agreement claim,\n\nwhich Walker, Wilson, and Few Ready Mix contend should be reversed and rendered.\n\n        At the outset, we reject the argument that the attorney’s fees award should be\n\nreversed based on the breach-of-the-Partnership-Agreement claim. Earlier, we held that\n\nthe evidence supporting that claim is sufficient. Furthermore, Walker, Wilson, and Few\n\nReady Mix have not provided any citations to case law or the record to support this\n\nargument. See TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1(i).\n\n\n\n\nPike, et al. v. Tex.

Essentially, Walker, Wilson, and Few Ready Mix contend that the\n\ntrial court abused its discretion in admitting the billing records at trial. We review a trial\n\ncourt’s decision to admit or exclude evidence for an abuse of discretion. See City of\n\nBrownsville v. Alvarado, 897 S.W.2d 750, 753 (Tex. 1995); see also Cady v.

McShane, 239 S.W.3d 231, 234 (Tex.\n\n2007)). A trial court exceeds its discretion if it acts in an arbitrary or unreasonable manner\n\nor without reference to guiding rules or principles. See Bowie Mem’l Hosp. v. Wright, 79\n\nS.W.3d 48, 52 (Tex. 2002). When reviewing matters committed to the trial court’s\n\ndiscretion, we may not substitute our own judgment for the trial court’s judgment. Id.\n\nAnd we must uphold the trial court’s evidentiary ruling if there is any legitimate basis\n\nfor the ruling. Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. v. Malone, 972 S.W.2d 35, 43 (Tex. 1998).\n\n        At the hearing on attorney’s fees, counsel for Walker, Wilson, and Few Ready Mix\n\nargued that requests for production were propounded, but records of fee billings were\n\nnot produced until well into trial on April 30, 2011. Counsel for appellees explained the\n\nnumbers of hours spent by counsel in this trial and that a lot of effort was made to get up\n\nto speed on this case both before and after trial days. Counsel further asserted that “it\n\ntakes more time to represent the plaintiff than it does to represent the defendant. . . . But\n\n\n\n\nPike, et al. v. Tex. EMC Mgmt., LLC, et al.                                            Page 48\n\fthe time that I testified to was time that was actually spent.” The trial court took the\n\nmatter under advisement, but eventually admitted the fee records into evidence.\n\n        Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 193.6(a) provides that a party who fails to make,\n\namend, or supplement a discovery response in a timely manner may not introduce the\n\nuntimely information in evidence unless the court finds good cause or no unfair surprise\n\nor prejudice to the other parties. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 193.6(a). On appeal, Walker, Wilson,\n\nand Few Ready Mix do not address the exception for unfair surprise or prejudice, but\n\nrather focus on good cause. Given that counsel for appellees explained that the fees\n\ncorresponded with work associated with trial—largely an event attended by all parties\n\nin this case, we cannot say that the record demonstrates a finding of unfair surprise or\n\nprejudice. See id. at R. 193.6(b). Therefore, we cannot say that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion in admitting the billing records. See McShane, 239 S.W.3d at 234; Alvarado, 897\n\nS.W.2d at 753; see also Cady, 2015 Tex. App. LEXIS 4501, at *9.\n\n        Walker, Wilson, and Few Ready Mix also complain that appellees did not properly\n\npresent the underlying claim. To recover attorney’s fees under Chapter 38 of the Texas\n\nCivil Practice and Remedies Code,\n\n        (1) the claimant must be represented by an attorney;\n\n        (2) the claimant must present the claim to the opposing party or to a duly\n            authorized agent of the opposing party; and\n\n        (3) payment for the just amount owed must not have been tendered before the\n            expiration of the 30th day after the claim is presented.\n\n\nPike, et al. v. Tex. EMC Mgmt., LLC, et al.                                         Page 49\n\fTEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE. ANN. § 38.002 (West 2015). The purpose of the presentment\n\nrequirement is to allow the person against whom the claim is asserted an opportunity to\n\npay a claim within thirty days of receiving notice of the claim without incurring an\n\nobligation for attorney’s fees.          See Jones v. Kelley, 614 S.W.2d 95, 100 (Tex. 1981).\n\nPresentment requires no particular form; all that is necessary is an assertion of a debt or\n\nclaim, a request for payment, and the opposing party’s refusal to pay. Id.; see Standard\n\nConstructors, Inc. v. Chevron Chem. Co., 101 S.W.3d 619, 627 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st\n\nDist.] 2003, pet. denied). “When the question of attorney’s fees is submitted to the court,\n\nthe court may consider the entire case file to determine whether presentment was made.”\n\nBethel v. Norman Furniture Co., 756 S.W.2d 6, 8 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1988, no\n\nwrit) (citing Carrington v. Hart, 703 S.W.2d 814, 818 (Tex. App.—Austin 1988, no writ));\n\nsee TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 38.004(1) (West 2015).\n\n        The claimant bears the burden to plead and prove presentment of its contract claim\n\nand that the party failed to tender performance. See Ellis v. Waldrop, 656 S.W.2d 902, 905\n\n(Tex. 1983) (op. on reh’g). “But when a claimant avers in its petition that all conditions\n\nprecedent to recovery have occurred or have been performed, it is required to prove only\n\nthose conditions precedent that have specifically been denied by the opposing party.”\n\nShin-Con Dev. Corp. v. I.P. Invs., Ltd., 270 S.W.3d 759, 768 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2008, pet.\n\ndenied) (citing TEX. R. CIV. P. 54); see Belew v. Rector, 202 S.W.3d 849, 857 (Tex. App.—\n\nEastland 2006, no pet.).\n\n\nPike, et al. v. Tex. EMC Mgmt., LLC, et al.                                           Page 50\n\f        In the instant case, EMC Cement pleaded “[a]ll conditions precedent necessary for\n\nthe enforcement of the Partnership Agreement, the Management Agreement, and the\n\nLicense Agreement have been satisfied, fulfilled, or excused.” Walker, Wilson, and Few\n\nReady Mix responded “that all conditions precedent necessary for enforcement of the\n\nPartnership Agreement have not occurred.” By failing to specifically deny that appellees\n\nfailed to present their contract claim as required by statute, Walker, Wilson, and Few\n\nReady Mix have waived their right to complain of such failure on appeal. See Shin-Con\n\nDev. Corp., 270 S.W.3d at 768 (citing Gill Sav. Ass’n v. Int’l Supply Co., Inc., 759 S.W.2d 697,\n\n701 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1988, writ denied)); see also TEX. R. CIV. P. 54 (“In pleading the\n\nperformance or occurrence of conditions precedent, it shall be sufficient to aver generally\n\nthat all conditions precedent have been performed or have occurred.                When such\n\nperformance or occurrences have been so plead, the party so pleading same shall be\n\nrequired to prove only such of them as are specifically denied by the opposite party.”).\n\n        And finally, we address Walker, Wilson, and Few Ready Mix’s contention that the\n\nattorney’s fees should have been segregated. An appellate court reviews a trial court’s\n\ndecision on the award of attorney’s fees for an abuse of discretion. Bocquet v. Herring, 972\n\nS.W.2d 19, 21 (Tex. 1998). “Whether to award attorney’s fees, and to which party, is a\n\ndecision that is solely within the trial court’s discretion and will not be reversed absent a\n\nclear abuse of that discretion.” Sammons v. Elder, 940 S.W.2d 276, 284 (Tex. App.—Waco\n\n1997, writ denied).\n\n\nPike, et al. v. Tex. EMC Mgmt., LLC, et al.                                             Page 51\n\f        Ordinarily, fees claimants must segregate fees between claims for which they are\n\nrecoverable and claims for which they are not. Chapa, 212 S.W.3d at 311. Moreover, the\n\nneed to segregate fees is a question of law that appellate courts review de novo. See id. at\n\n312. However, a recognized exception to the duty to segregate arises when the attorney’s\n\nfees rendered are in connection with claims arising out of the same transaction and are\n\nso interrelated that their “prosecution or defense entails proof or denial of essentially the\n\nsame facts.” Sterling, 822 S.W.2d at 10; see Ski River Dev., Inc. v. McCalla, 167 S.W.3d 121,\n\n143 (Tex. App.—Waco 2005, pet. denied). “Therefore, when the causes of action involved\n\nin the suit are dependent upon the same set of facts or circumstances and thus are\n\n‘intertwined to the point of being inseparable,’ the party suing for attorney’s fees may\n\nrecover the entire amount covering all claims.” McCalla, 167 S.W.3d at 143 (quoting\n\nSterling, 822 S.W.2d at 11).\n\n        At the hearing on attorney’s fees in this case, the trial court heard testimony that\n\nappellees’ contract claims against Walker and Wilson were too intertwined with the other\n\nclaims in the case to segregate. The record evidence supports this contention, especially\n\ngiven that Walker and Wilson’s breaches of the Partnership Agreement were closely\n\nlinked with the conspiracy to end the EMC Products partnership and misappropriate\n\nEMC Cement’s trade secrets for a new competitor in the cement business, VHSC.\n\nAccordingly, based on the record before us, we cannot say that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion in accepting appellees’ testimony that the claims were too intertwined to\n\n\nPike, et al. v. Tex. EMC Mgmt., LLC, et al.                                           Page 52\n\fsegregate and awarding appellees’ attorney’s-fees request. See Bocquet, 972 S.W.2d at 21;\n\nSterling, 822 S.W.2d at 10-11; McCalla, 167 S.W.3d at 143; see also Classic Superoof LLC v.\n\nBean, No. 05-12-00941-CV, 2014 Tex. App. LEXIS 11365, at **23-24 (Tex. App.—Dallas Oct.\n\n14, 2014, pet. denied) (mem. op.) (finding no abuse of discretion where the trial court did\n\nnot require the segregation of attorney’s fees because the testimony established that the\n\nclaims at issue were inextricably intertwined).\n\n        7.      Walker and Wilson’s Monthly Payments to Texas Central Bank\n\n        Walker and Wilson also argue that they are entitled to recover sums they “loaned”\n\nto EMC Products. Their claim is premised on the jury’s award of $250,000 to Walker and\n\nWilson for “unpaid loans made to EMC Products,” which they contend omits funds that\n\nare still owed. Specifically, Walker and Wilson allege that they should be reimbursed for\n\nthe $25,000 monthly principal payments made to the bank from July 2009 to December\n\n2010.\n\n        At the outset, we note that Walker and Wilson have not cited any authority to\n\nsupport their claim for these amounts. See TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1(i). Moreover, under the\n\nexpress terms of the Partnership Agreement, any payments made by Walker and Wilson\n\nto the bank as a result of their personal guarantees were deemed to be additional capital\n\ncontributions to the partnership, rather than loans.      Specifically, section 2.6 of the\n\nPartnership Agreement provided:\n\n        Deemed Additional Capital Contributions. A Partner shall be deemed to\n        have made an additional Capital Contribution to the Partnership if and to\nPike, et al. v. Tex. EMC Mgmt., LLC, et al.                                         Page 53\n\f        the extent: (i) such Partner makes any payment to a creditor of the\n        Partnership because of personal liability thereon; or (ii) such Partner makes\n        any payment to a creditor of the Partnership because of the personal\n        guarantee by such Partner.\n\n        Because Walker and Wilson admitted that they made $25,000 monthly principal\n\npayments because of their personal guarantees, and because Walker admitted that he\n\nunderstood the payments to be additional capital contributions under the terms of the\n\nPartnership Agreement, we cannot say that it was error to not include the principal\n\npayments in the judgment.\n\n        8.      EMC Products’ Liability Under the Loan Agreement\n\n        In this sub-issue, VHSC contends that EMC Products is liable for the amount\n\nallegedly remaining due on the loan. The record reflects that Walker and Wilson wired\n\na combined sum of $3,937,418—the full amount outstanding on the EMC Products loan—\n\nto Texas Capital Bank. VHSC asserts that this money was sent on behalf of Few Ready\n\nMix to pay for its acquisition of the loan. VHSC, Pike, Walker, Wilson, and Few Ready\n\nMix moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on this complaint.\n\n        A trial court may disregard a jury’s verdict and render a JNOV if there is no\n\nevidence to support the jury’s findings or if a directed verdict would have been proper.\n\nBrown v. Bank of Galveston, 963 S.W.2d 511, 513 (Tex. 1998); see TEX. R. CIV. P. 301. We\n\nreview the trial court’s ruling on a motion for JNOV under a legal-sufficiency standard.\n\nSee Tanner v. Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 289 S.W.3d 828, 830 (Tex. 2009).\n\n\n\nPike, et al. v. Tex. EMC Mgmt., LLC, et al.                                             Page 54\n\f        Phillip Wood, formerly the Executive Vice President of Texas Capital Bank,\n\ntestified that, on May 2 and May 3, Walker and Wilson each wired $1,968,709. Wood\n\nnoted that the beneficiary listed on the document was EMC Products, not the bank.\n\nThough Wood believed that the wire transfers were for the purchase of the note, he\n\nadmitted that there was not any reference to the purchase of the note in bank documents.\n\nThe bank honored the beneficiary named in the wire transfer and applied the funds to\n\nEMC Products’ account. The transactions were recorded in the bank ledger, and as a\n\nresult of the transactions, the principal balance of the note was zero.\n\n        Given that bank documents do not reflect a purchase of the note, but rather the\n\npaying off of the note, we cannot say that the jury erred in relying on the bank’s records\n\nin finding that EMC Products complied with the loan agreement. As such, we hold that\n\nthe trial court did not err in failing to enter judgment notwithstanding the verdict on\n\nVHSC’s deficiency counterclaim. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 301; see also Tanner, 289 S.W.3d at 830;\n\nBrown, 963 S.W.2d at 513.\n\n        Based on the foregoing, we overrule VHSC and Pike’s third through fifth issues.\n\nWe also overrule Walker, Wilson, and Few Ready Mix’s first issue.\n\n                                     VIII. PERMANENT INJUNCTION\n\n        In their sole issue on cross-appeal, EMC Management, EMC Products, and EMC\n\nCement contend that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to enter a permanent\n\n\n\n\nPike, et al. v. Tex. EMC Mgmt., LLC, et al.                                          Page 55\n\finjunction in their favor, especially considering VHSC and Pike have used and disclosed\n\nEMC Cement trade secrets and are in a position to continue to do so.\n\nA.       Applicable Law\n\n         Whether to grant a permanent injunction is ordinarily within the sound discretion\n\nof the trial court and, on appeal, review of the trial court’s action is limited to the question\n\nof whether the trial court clearly abused its discretion. See Noell v. City of Carrollton, 431\n\nS.W.3d 682, 712 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2014, pet. denied); see also Devon Energy Prod. Co., L.P.\n\nv. McCarver, No. 10-15-00002-CV, 2015 Tex. App. LEXIS 8241, at *3 (Tex. App.—Waco\n\nAug. 6, 2015, no pet.) (mem. op.). We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the\n\ntrial court’s judgment. Swate v. Medina Cmty. Hosp., 966 S.W.2d 693, 700 (Tex. App.—San\n\nAntonio 1998, pet. denied). If some evidence appears in the record that reasonably\n\nsupports the trial court’s decision, there is no abuse of discretion. Id. The trial court\n\nabuses its discretion only if the record contains no evidence supporting the trial court’s\n\nfindings. Operation Rescue-Nat’l v. Planned Parenthood of Houston, 975 S.W.2d 546, 560 (Tex.\n\n1998).\n\n         At common law, the applicant seeking injunctive relief must demonstrate: (1) the\n\nexistence of a wrongful act; (2) the existence of imminent harm; (3) the existence of\n\nirreparable injury; and (4) the absence of an adequate remedy at law. See Noell, 431\n\nS.W.3d at 712; see also McCarver, 2015 Tex. App. LEXIS 8241, at *3. “Without proof of all\n\nfour elements, injunctive relief is improper.” John Paul Mitchell Sys. v. Randalls Food Mkts.,\n\n\nPike, et al. v. Tex. EMC Mgmt., LLC, et al.                                             Page 56\n\fInc., 17 S.W.3d 721, 732 (Tex. App.—Austin 2000, pet. denied). An injunction will not be\n\nissued to prevent injury that is purely conjectural or speculative. Jordan v. Landry’s Seafood\n\nRest., Inc., 89 S.W.3d 737, 742 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2002, pet. denied) (op. on\n\nreh’g).\n\nB.        Discussion\n\n          The complaints about the permanent injunction correspond with the\n\nmisappropriation-of-trade-secrets claim alleged at trial. The trial court made numerous\n\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law. Ultimately, the trial court concluded that EMC\n\nCement does not face imminent harm based on the following fact findings:\n\n          1. VHSC is not currently using any of EMC Cement’s claimed trade\n             secrets.\n\n          2. VHSC discontinued use of any EMC Cement’s claimed trade secrets\n             shortly after the foreclosure sale.\n\n          3. Soon after the foreclosure sale, VHSC removed the equipment\n             modifications EMC Cement used to mill cementitious material.\n\n          4. Within several weeks of the foreclosure sale, VHSC began using\n             different materials in its milling process, by among other things,\n             substituting lime for Portland Cement.\n\n          5. In 2012, VHSC began using entirely different milling equipment that\n             employed a different technique to produce cementitious materials.\n\nAnd in concluding that EMC Cement did not face imminent harm, the trial court stated\n\nthat the Amended Final Judgment awarded future damages for the misappropriation of\n\ntrade secrets; thus, EMC Cement already obtained an adequate legal remedy and is not\n\n\nPike, et al. v. Tex. EMC Mgmt., LLC, et al.                                            Page 57\n\fentitled to a permanent injunction.           Contrary to the assertions of cross-appellees,\n\nappellants have challenged the trial court’s findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n\n        1.      Existence of a Wrongful Act\n\n        As we have concluded earlier, the evidence supporting cross-appellants’\n\nmisappropriation-of-trade-secrets claim is legally and factually sufficient. As such, cross-\n\nappellants have established the first prong for a permanent injunction—a wrongful act.\n\n        2.      Imminent Harm\n\n        The next prong—imminent harm—was hotly contested at trial and was the focus\n\nof the trial court’s findings of fact. On cross-appeal, cross-appellants contend that harm\n\nis presumed in a misappropriation-of-trade-secrets case when a defendant possesses\n\ntrade secrets and is in a position to use them. Cross-appellees, on the other hand, argue\n\nthat there is no basis for finding imminent harm, especially considering that the trial\n\ncourt, in its findings of fact, stated that VHSC is no longer using the claimed trade secrets.\n\nWith this prong, we necessarily have to analyze the propriety of the trial court’s findings\n\nof fact and conclusions of law.\n\n        Findings of fact entered in a case tried to the court have the same force and dignity\n\nas a jury verdict. Anderson v. City of Seven Points, 806 S.W.2d 791, 794 (Tex. 1991). We\n\nthus review findings of fact by the same standards that are applied in reviewing the legal\n\nand factual sufficiency of the evidence supporting a jury’s answer to a jury question. Id.\n\nWe have already laid out the governing law for legal and factual sufficiency.\n\n\nPike, et al. v. Tex. EMC Mgmt., LLC, et al.                                            Page 58\n\f        The standard of review for conclusions of law is de novo. See BMC Software Belg.,\n\nN.V. v. Marchand, 83 S.W.3d 789, 794 (Tex. 2002). We evaluate the trial court’s legal\n\nconclusions independently to determine whether the trial court correctly drew the legal\n\nconclusions from the facts. Id. We uphold conclusions of law on appeal if the judgment\n\ncan be sustained on any legal theory the evidence supports. Material P’ships, Inc. v.\n\nVentura, 102 S.W.3d 252, 257 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2003, pet. denied). Thus,\n\nincorrect conclusions of law do not require reversal if the controlling findings of fact\n\nsupport the judgment under a correct legal theory. Id.\n\n        At trial, Pike admitted that VHSC was using EMC Cement trade secrets, including\n\nthe VBMs, in May 2013, or, in other words, two years after the foreclosure sale.\n\nAdditionally, immediately after the foreclosure sale, VHSC sold the same PozzoSlag\n\nproduct that EMC Products had developed, and testimony at trial revealed that VHSC\n\nwas still selling PozzoSlag at the time of trial. Finally, the evidence indicated that Pike\n\nworked with Ronin to develop processes for using Rotary Ball Mills to manufacture\n\nenergetically-modified cement, and at the time of trial, VHSC was using this same\n\ntechnology to manufacture PozzoSlag.\n\n        In light of this unchallenged evidence, it is our belief that a reasonable factfinder\n\ncould not have concluded that VHSC stopped using EMC Cement trade secrets shortly\n\nafter the foreclosure sale. Additionally, a reasonable factfinder could have concluded\n\nthat VHSC was using EMC Cement trade secrets at the time the permanent injunction\n\n\nPike, et al. v. Tex. EMC Mgmt., LLC, et al.                                           Page 59\n\fwas denied. As such, we conclude that the trial court’s findings of fact regarding VHSC’s\n\nusage of EMC Cement’s trade secrets are not supported by legally-sufficient evidence.\n\nAnd given that the underlying fact findings are not supported by legally-sufficient\n\nevidence, we must reverse the trial court’s conclusion of law that EMC Cement did not\n\nface imminent harm.11\n\n        And despite the fact that the trial court’s findings of fact and conclusions of law\n\npertaining to imminent harm are not supported by sufficient evidence, we also agree with\n\ncross-appellants’ contention that when a defendant possesses trade secrets and is in a\n\nposition to use them, harm is presumed. See IAC, Ltd. v. Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc., 160\n\nS.W.3d 191, 200 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2005, no pet.) (“When a defendant possesses\n\ntrade secrets and is in a position to use them, harm to the trade secret owner may be\n\npresumed” (citing Fox v. Tropical Warehouses, Inc., 121 S.W.3d 853, 860 (Tex. App.—Fort\n\nWorth 2003, no pet.))); T-N-T Motorsports, Inc. v. Hennessey Motorsports, 965 S.W.2d 18, 24\n\n(Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1998, no pet.) (holding that because appellant possesses\n\nconfidential information and was in a position to use it, appellant was likely to use the\n\ninformation to the former employer’s detriment); see also Hill v. McLane Co., No. 03-10-\n\n\n\n\n        11 Not only is the trial court’s conclusion of law regarding imminent harm erroneous based on the\ninsufficiency of the underlying findings of fact, but the assumption that the Amended Final Judgment\nawarded future damages to EMC Cement and was an adequate legal remedy is incorrect. In fact, as stated\nearlier in this memorandum opinion, the jury was asked two damages questions with respect to the\nmisappropriation-of-trade-secrets claim. Both of the questions asked about past damages—namely, what\na reasonably prudent investor would have paid for use of EMC Cement’s trade secrets in Texas and what\ndevelopment costs were saved by VHSC.\n\nPike, et al. v. Tex. EMC Mgmt., LLC, et al.                                                      Page 60\n\f00293-CV, 2011 Tex. App. LEXIS 169, at *14 (Tex.

(“It was proper for the trial court to\n\nenjoin Lockhart from using such information because he is still in a position to use it.”).\n\nHere, Pike was previously the general manager for EMC Products and had access to EMC\n\nCement’s trade secrets.            However, the record shows that immediately after the\n\nforeclosure sale, Pike went to work for VHSC, another cement-manufacturing company,\n\nand tried to patent EMC Products’ trade secrets. Furthermore, Pike admitted that VHSC\n\ncontinued to use EMC Products’ trade secrets until at least May 2013. Clearly, Pike and\n\nVHSC were in possession of EMC Cement’s trade-secret information and were in a\n\nposition to use it. Accordingly, under these circumstances, imminent harm is presumed.12\n\nSee IAC, Ltd., 160 S.W.3d at 200; Fox, 121 S.W.3d at 860; T-N-T Motorsports, Inc., 965 S.W.2d\n\nat 24; see also Hill, 2011 Tex.

Irreparable Injury and Absence of an Adequate Remedy at Law\n\n\n\n\n          12And to the extent that cross-appellees argue that the imminent-harm presumption only applies\nto temporary injunctions, we first note that cross-appellees have not cited any controlling authority to\nsupport that contention. Furthermore, “[a]s the Supreme Court of the United States has recognized, the\nstandards applicable to requests for preliminary and permanent injunctions are ‘essentially the\nsame . . . with the exception that the plaintiff must show a likelihood of success on the merits rather than\nactual success’ when pursuing a preliminary injunction.” Heil Trailer Int’l Co. v. Kula, 542 F. App’x 329, 335\n(5th Cir. 2013) (not designated for publication) (quoting Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7,\n32 (2008)); see Amoco Prod. Co. v. Vill. of Gambell, AK, 480 U.S. 531, 546 n.12 (1987).\n\nPike, et al. v. Tex. EMC Mgmt., LLC, et al.                                                            Page 61\n\fIt is undisputed that the final two prongs of this inquiry are directly related. See Williams\n\nv. Compressor Eng’g Corp., 704 S.W.2d 469, 472 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1986, writ\n\nref’d n.r.e.) (“When the term ‘irreparable injury’ is used with ‘no adequate remedy at\n\nlaw[,]’ the former term is a misnomer, because if an injury is irreparable, there is no\n\nremedy for it, adequate or inadequate.”). Cross-appellees contend that EMC was not\n\nirreparably harmed by the alleged misappropriation of trade secrets because Pike was an\n\nindependent contractor, and because the damage award for this claim already considered\n\nfuture damages.\n\n        We first reject cross-appellees’ latter contention about future damages.          As\n\nexplained in footnote 9, the jury was asked about past damages in the charge question\n\npertaining to misappropriation of trade secrets. As such, we cannot say that the damage\n\naward already considered future damages.\n\n        Additionally, we are not persuaded by cross-appellees’ contention that Pike’s\n\nwork status somehow affects the analysis of this issue. The record evidence clearly\n\nestablished that Pike worked at EMC Products and had access to EMC Cement’s trade\n\nsecrets. The record also indicates that Pike, on behalf of VHSC, used the trade-secret\n\ninformation to attempt to file a patent, as well as market cement products manufactured\n\nby VHSC.\n\n        Furthermore, numerous courts have held the following:\n\n           “We agree with the trial court’s disregarding of the answer to the issue and its\n            ruling that where the uncontradicted evidence shows that a former employee\nPike, et al. v.

Williams, 704 S.W.2d\n            at 470.\n\n           “Even in the best of good faith, a former technical or ‘creative’ employee such\n            as Powell working for a competitor such as SRI can hardly prevent his\n            knowledge or his former employer’s confidential methods from showing up in\n            his work. . . . The mere rendition of service in the same area would almost\n            necessarily impart such knowledge to some degree in his subsequent\n            employment. Powell cannot be loyal both to his promise to his former\n            employer, EDS, and to his new obligation to his present employer, SRI. In these\n            circumstances, the most effective protective device is to restrain Powell from\n            working in the same computer field in which he was associated while\n            employed by EDS.” Elec. Data Sys Corp. v. Powell, 524 S.W.2d 393, 398 (Tex.\n            App.—Dallas 1975, writ ref’d n.r.e.) (internal citations omitted).\n\n           “When a defendant possesses trade secrets and is in a position to use them,\n            harm to the trade secret owner may be presumed. . . . The threatened\n            disclosure of trade secrets constitutes irreparable injury as a matter of law.”\n            IAC, Ltd., 160 S.W.3d at 200 (internal citations omitted).\n\n           “Texas precedent is that the threatened disclosure or use of the trade secrets of\n            another constitutes irreparable injury as a matter of law.” Core Labs.

CONCLUSION\n\n        In sum, with respect to the direct appeal, we modify the Amended Final Judgment\n\nto reflect that Pike is not liable for intentionally interfering with his own Management\n\nAgreement and affirm the Amended Final Judgment in all other respects.

The factfinder is free to\n\nbelieve one witness and disbelieve another, and reviewing courts may not impose their\n\nown opinions to the contrary. Id. As such, reviewing courts must assume that the\n\nfactfinder decided all credibility questions in the favor of the findings and chose what\n\ntestimony to disregard in a way that was in favor of the findings, if a reasonable person\n\ncould do so. Id. at 819-20.\n\n        Additionally, it is within the factfinder’s province to resolve conflicts in the\n\nevidence.     Id. at 820.     Consequently, we must assume that, where reasonable, the\n\nfactfinder resolved all conflicts in the evidence in a manner consistent with the findings.\n\nId. Where conflicting inferences can be drawn from the evidence, it is within the province\n\nof the factfinder to choose which inference to draw, so long as more than one inference\n\ncan reasonably be drawn. Id. at 821. Thus, we must assume that the factfinder made all\n\ninferences in favor of the findings if a reasonable person could do so. Id. As stated in\n\nCity of Keller, the final test for legal sufficiency must always be “whether the evidence at\n\ntrial would entitle reasonable and fair-minded people to reach the verdict under review.”\n\nId. at 827. Anything more than a scintilla of evidence is legally sufficient to support the\n\nfinding. See Cont’l Coffee Prods. Co. v.

Id.\n\n             II.     BREACH-OF-CONTRACT CLAIMS AGAINST WALKER AND WILSON\n\n        In their second issue, Walker, Wilson, and Few Ready Mix argue that appellees’\n\nbreach-of-contract claim against Walker and Wilson is invalid as a matter of law, arguing,\n\namong other things, that: (1) the failure to provide an infinite amount of money was not\n\na breach of the Partnership Agreement; and (2) appellees breached the Partnership\n\nAgreement first. Walker, Wilson, and Few Ready Mix also contend that EMC Cement\n\nlacks standing to recover for diminished value of the partnership; that the attorney’s fees\n\naward is improper; and that the amount awarded to Walker and Wilson for appellees’\n\nbreach of the Partnership Agreement was incorrect.\n\n        A.

The Partnership Agreement\n\n        Next, we will address Walker, Wilson, and Few Ready Mix’s arguments regarding\n\nthe Partnership Agreement.\n\n        The partners in EMC Products, a Texas limited partnership, are EMC\n\nManagement, EMC Cement, Walker and certain members of his family, and Wilson.\n\nEMC Management is a general partner with a 1% share in the partnership. EMC Cement\n\nis a Class A limited partner with a 49.5% ownership stake. Walker and his family and\n\nWilson are Class B limited partners with a collective 49.5% ownership share in the\n\npartnership. Under the Partnership Agreement, the following was required of Class B\n\nlimited partners Walker and Wilson:\n\n        Section 2.5. Financing Assistance by Class B Limited Partners. The Class\n        B Limited Partners shall loan funds to and/or obtain financing for the\n        Partnership to meet the Primary Objective until such time as the\n        Partnership has the financial ability to obtain such financing on its own\n        resources. The General Partner and the Class A Limited Partner shall have\n        no obligation to make loans to and/or obtain financing for the Partnership.\n\nSection 1.5 of the Partnership Agreement outlines the primary objective of the\n\nPartnership as follows: “The Partners agree that the primary objective of the partnership\n\nwill be to maximize the degree and speed of market penetration for the Products in the\n\n\n\nPike, et al. v.

Discussion\n\n        Ronin and Lygren both testified that, in 2008 and 2009, they began negotiating\n\nwith C-Change in California about financing, developing, and commercializing EMC\n\nCement’s intellectual property.               According to Ronin and Lygren, John Preston, a\n\nmanaging partner of C-Change, and Alan Quasha, the president of Quadrant\n\nManagement, were involved in the negotiations. Lygren noted that Walker and Wilson\n\nwere aware of the C-Change negotiations, though Wilson’s testimony implied that he\n\nwas unaware of the negotiations. Nevertheless, as a result of the negotiations, Ronin,\n\nLygren, and C-Change executed a letter of intent calling “for C-Change to commit to\n\n\nPike, et al. v. Tex. EMC Mgmt., LLC, et al.                                           Page 12\n\fcontribute a maximum investment of 50 million dollars to . . . California, 49 million to the\n\ncompany and a million to the idea” in exchange for a 51% equity interest in a holding\n\ncompany formed to develop and commercialize EMC Cement technology in California.\n\nBeginning in 2010, Quasha and Preston spoke with Walker and Wilson several times.\n\nApparently, Quasha and Preston told Walker and Wilson that they wanted to buy EMC\n\nProducts’ business but did not want to enter into an agreement with Lygren. Both Ronin\n\nand Lygren testified that they were unaware that Quasha and Preston were\n\ncommunicating with Walker and Wilson. In any event, in December 2010, EMC Cement\n\ncalled off negotiations with C-Change.\n\n        In January 2011, Walker and Wilson, frustrated with the actions of Lygren and\n\nRonin, decided to stop making the monthly $25,000 payments on EMC Products’ loan\n\nwith Texas Capital Bank, thereby causing the partnership to default on an underlying\n\nloan. Phillip Wood, Texas Capital Bank’s Executive Vice President, testified that Walker\n\nand Wilson had stated that their goal was to end their relationship with Lygren and allow\n\nQuasha and Preston to buy EMC Products’ assets at a foreclosure sale following the\n\ndefault. These plans were subsequently relayed to Quasha and Preston, according to the\n\ntestimony.\n\n        Lygren recounted that, in February 2011, Wilson told Wood that a group\n\nrepresented by Quasha was interested in EMC Products—a sentiment that Quasha\n\n\n\n\nPike, et al. v. Tex. EMC Mgmt., LLC, et al.                                          Page 13\n\fconfirmed to Wood. On April 12, 2011, Texas Capital Bank noticed the foreclosure of\n\nEMC Products’ assets for May 3, 2011.\n\n        VHSC formed on April 28, 2011. The company is owned by INEA International,\n\nLimited, a company purportedly closely associated with Quasha and Preston. According\n\nto Wood, Wilson put together the potential sale of the loan to INEA, which led to Quasha\n\nentering into discussions with the bank. These discussions allegedly resulted in a draft\n\nagreement that designated Quasha as the sole primary contact for purposes of the\n\nagreement.\n\n        Also in April 2011, Lygren informed the bank that EMC Products’ license from\n\nEMC Cement was “neither assignable nor transferable” and that the foreclosure\n\nproceedings would result in the disclosure of intellectual property belonging to EMC\n\nCement. Lygren also noted that the bank had no right to foreclose and that legal action\n\nwould be taken if the foreclosure was to proceed. Lygren then notified Walker a couple\n\nof days before May 3, 2011, that EMC Cement had terminated the license agreement with\n\nEMC Products.\n\n        Upon receiving Lygren’s notices, the bank decided not to conduct the foreclosure\n\nsale. However, Walker and Wilson coordinated the purported sale of the loan to Few\n\nReady Mix, Walker’s company, so that Few Ready Mix could foreclose on EMC Products’\n\nassets on May 3, 2011. To facilitate the purported sale of the loan, Walker and Wilson\n\nboth wired over $1.9 million to the bank on behalf of Few Ready Mix. Thereafter, Few\n\n\nPike, et al. v. Tex. EMC Mgmt., LLC, et al.                                      Page 14\n\fReady Mix sold EMC Products’ assets to VHSC at the May 3, 2011 foreclosure sale.\n\nWilson served as the trustee, and Preston was the bidder at the foreclosure sale.\n\n        VHSC bought EMC Products’ assets for $3,126,090; however, the winning bid left\n\nan approximate $800,000 deficiency on the loan. In any event, Walker testified that he\n\nand Wilson equally shared the proceeds from the sale. A day later, Few Ready Mix sold\n\nthe loan agreement to VHSC for $300,000. Walker and Wilson once again equally split\n\nthe proceeds from the sale. And within days of the sale, VHSC began selling products\n\nproduced by EMC Cement’s purported trade secrets.\n\n        Based on the evidence outlined above, and viewing the evidence in the light most\n\nfavorable to the jury’s verdict, we conclude that a rational factfinder could determine that\n\nWalker, Wilson, and Few Ready Mix worked together to achieve the common goal of\n\ndelivering EMC Cement’s trade secrets to Quasha and Preston at VHSC by breaching the\n\nPartnership Agreement, defaulting on the loan, and ensuring that EMC Products’ assets\n\nwere sold to VHSC at the foreclosure sale—acts that resulted in damage to EMC Cement.\n\nSee Tri, 162 S.W.3d at 556; Juhl, 936 S.W.2d at 644; Riley, 900 S.W.2d at 719; BP Auto., L.P.,\n\n448 S.W.3d at 573; see also Reyes, 272 S.W.3d at 592; City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 822.\n\nFurthermore, we cannot say that the jury’s verdict as to the civil-conspiracy claim is so\n\ncontrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence as to be clearly wrong and unjust.\n\nSee Cain, 709 S.W.2d at 176. Accordingly, we conclude that the evidence supporting the\n\n\n\n\nPike, et al. v. Tex. EMC Mgmt., LLC, et al.                                            Page 15\n\fjury’s finding of civil conspiracy against Walker, Wilson, and Few Ready Mix is\n\nsupported by legally- and factually-sufficient evidence. We overrule their third issue.5\n\n                                         IV.     CUMULATIVE ERROR\n\n        In their fourth issue, Walker, Wilson, and Few Ready Mix assert that the trial\n\ncourt’s alleged cumulative errors “probably led to the rendition of an improper result.”\n\nWe disagree.\n\nA.      Applicable Law\n\n\n\n\n        5 In this issue, Walker, Wilson, and Few Ready Mix also appear to argue that civil conspiracy only\napplies to dangerous activities and that the issue was improperly submitted to the jury. First, we note that\nthe “purpose of the concert of action theory is to deter antisocial or dangerous behavior.” Juhl v. Airington,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">936</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">640</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 644 (Tex. 1996) (citations omitted). Concert of action “imposes liability not for an\nagreement, but for substantially assisting and encouraging a wrongdoer in a tortious act.” Id. However,\nin analyzing Airington’s claims, the Juhl Court considered civil conspiracy and the concert-of-action theory\nas separate theories. See id. (noting that “[b]ecause Airington’s pleadings allege only that defendants were\nnegligent, civil conspiracy is not a theory upon which he could have relied to avoid summary judgment”\nand subsequently analyzing Airington’s concert-of-action theory). We therefore are not persuaded by\nWalker, Wilson, and Few Ready Mix’s assertion that civil conspiracy only applies to dangerous activities.\n\n          Additionally, we reject Walker, Wilson, and Few Ready Mix’s complaint about the jury charge. In\ntheir brief, Walker, Wilson, and Few Ready Mix invoke Casteel and argue that the conspiracy question was\nimpermissibly commingled with valid and invalid liability grounds. See Crown Life Ins. Co. v. Casteel, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1376467\"><a href=\"/opinion/1376467/crown-life-ins-co-v-casteel/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">378</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 388 (Tex. 2000) (reversing for a new trial due to the erroneous commingling of valid and invalid\nliability theories in a single broad-form liability question). At trial, Walker, Wilson, and Few Ready Mix\ndid not raise a Casteel objection to the conspiracy question. See Burbage v.

[I]n situations where a party does not raise a Casteel-type objection, that party surely\ncannot raise a Casteel issue when it failed to preserve a claim of an invalid theory of liability that forms the\nbasis of a Casteel-type error.”). Rather, Walker, Wilson, and Few Ready Mix objected that the conspiracy\nquestion was not supported by the evidence and that the question was duplicative of the aiding and\nabetting question associated with the breach-of-fiduciary-duty questions. As such, we conclude that this\nargument was waived. See Burbage, 447 S.W.3d at 255-56.\n\nPike, et al. v. Tex. EMC Mgmt., LLC, et al.

Specifically, they complain that the trial court\n\nimproperly: (1) included fiduciary-duty questions in the charge; (2) admitted Plaintiff’s\n\nExhibit 129 into evidence over their objection; (3) overruled their motion for directed\n\nverdict on several claims; and (4) allowed questioning about the failure to disclose\n\ndiscussions surrounding the purchase of the EMC Products note. Based on our review\n\nof the record and our analysis of prior issues, there is sufficient evidence to support the\n\njury’s liability findings against Walker, Wilson, and Few Ready Mix. And as such, we\n\ncannot say that, based on the record as a whole, but for the alleged errors, the jury would\n\nhave rendered a verdict in favor of Walker, Wilson and Few Ready Mix.

Discussion\n\n        At trial, Ronin testified about the information that EMC Cement maintained as\n\ntrade secrets and about specific documents that contained trade-secret information.\n\nSpecifically, Ronin described confidential Mill Records and test reports from 2010 that\nPike, et al. v. Tex. EMC Mgmt., LLC, et al.                                                 Page 19\n\fcontain specific details about EMC Cement processes. Ronin explained that the records\n\nshow the test results of processing materials through high-energy vibratory-ball mills\n\n(“VBM”) under different conditions. According to Ronin, the tests show that changing\n\nthe speed at which fly ash is fed through the mill affects the final product. Additionally,\n\nthe tests indicate the effects of varying the size and weight of the grinding media, the\n\nparticle size of the fly ash, and the configuration of the openings on the mill wall. Ronin\n\ntestified that these test results and records were not intended to be disclosed to the public\n\nbecause they were trade secrets.\n\n        Ronin also explained the he did fill out a patent application for the VBMs, but that\n\nhe purposely excluded certain information to prevent it from being released to the public.\n\nRonin noted that: “We didn’t include information related to an exact positioning of the\n\nopenings, an exact configuration of the openings, an exact size of the openings related to\n\ndifferent rates, through capacities of the mill. So this whole element you always keep it\n\nout like the trade secret—know how.” He denied including the aforementioned Mill\n\nRecords and reports from 2010 in the patent application.\n\n        In later testimony, Ronin stated that EMC Cement maintained information as trade\n\nsecrets about the grinding media—i.e., the ceramic balls—within the mills, the frequency\n\nand amplitude of the mill’s vibrations, data regarding the alteration of fly ash in the mill,\n\nand the results of performance tests on two EMC products, CemPozz and PozzoSlag.\n\nRonin also testified that these trade secrets gave EMC Cement a competitive advantage\n\n\nPike, et al. v. Tex. EMC Mgmt., LLC, et al.                                           Page 20\n\fover its competitors in the cement industry because EMC Cement was the “one company\n\nwho’s doing this” and that EMC Cement had always taken measures to protect and guard\n\nthe secrecy of the trade-secret information.\n\n        The record reflects that Pike, the former general manager of EMC Products who\n\neventually became President of VHSC, included the Mill Records in the patent\n\napplication he filed on May 6, 2011, just three days after VHSC acquired the EMC assets\n\nat the foreclosure. With regard to the Mill Records, Pike testified that “[t]he data\n\nbelonged to Texas EMC but what we did with that data and how we modified that mill,\n\nparticularly the mill, I felt like it was the mill modification nothing to do with the\n\nprocess.” Nevertheless, Pike admitted that this information was EMC’s trade secrets and\n\nthat it contained highly-sensitive information.\n\n        Based on our review of the evidence, a rational factfinder could conclude that EMC\n\nCement identified its trade secrets at trial; that Pike used his position at EMC Products to\n\nobtain the trade-secret information that ultimately benefitted his new employer, VHSC—\n\na competitor of EMC Products; that Pike used the information in his patent application\n\nand VHSC used the information to produce cement subsequent to the foreclosure sale;\n\nand that the use of the trade-secret information caused EMC Cement damage.

Therefore, viewing the evidence in the light\n\nmost favorable to the jury’s verdict, we conclude that the trade-secret-misappropriation\n\n\nPike, et al. v. Tex. EMC Mgmt., LLC, et al.                                          Page 21\n\ffinding is supported by legally-sufficient evidence. See Reyes, 272 S.W.3d at 592; City of\n\nKeller, 168 S.W.3d at 822; see also Bohnsack, 668 F.3d at 279; Sw. Energy Prod. Co., 411 S.W.3d\n\nat 598; Trilogy Software, Inc., 143 S.W.3d at 463; Klumpe, 101 S.W.3d at 476. Additionally,\n\nwe cannot say that the jury’s verdict as to this claim is so contrary to the overwhelming\n\nweight of the evidence as to be clearly wrong and unjust. See Cain, 709 S.W.2d at 176.\n\nThus, we further conclude that the jury’s finding as to this claim is supported by factually-\n\nsufficient evidence. See id.\n\n        However, despite our conclusion that the jury’s finding on the trade-secret-\n\nmisappropriation claim is supported by legally- and factually-sufficient evidence, VHSC\n\nand Pike contend that EMC Cement consistently disclosed its “secret” technology in\n\npatent applications and public materials; therefore, there was no trade secret to\n\nmisappropriate. In addition, VHSC and Pike allege that they were authorized to use any\n\ntrade secrets that EMC Cement might have had based on licenses acquired in the\n\nforeclosure sale.\n\n        The record includes testimony from Ronin, the inventor of the process, about the\n\nmethods and tools he developed over time for activating fly ash and the data collected\n\nfrom years of experimentation. And as outlined above, information related to the unique\n\nconfiguration, use, and maintenance of the VBMs used to produce CemPozz and\n\nPozzoSlag were kept as trade secrets within the company and were not disclosed to the\n\npublic in advertising materials or in a patent application filed by Ronin. In fact, Ronin\n\n\nPike, et al. v. Tex. EMC Mgmt., LLC, et al.                                             Page 22\n\ftestified that he purposefully excluded certain trade-secret information from his patent\n\napplication to protect it from disclosure to the public. Ronin also noted that PozzoSlag,\n\nfor example, could not be reproduced using only the information contained in the patent\n\napplication. The disputed trade-secret information was needed to replicate PozzoSlag.\n\nMoreover, the record reveals that it was Pike, not Ronin, who disclosed EMC Cement\n\ntrade-secret information to the public via his patent application.\n\n        In addition, we are not persuaded by VHSC and Pike’s contention that they were\n\nauthorized to use EMC Cement’s trade secrets by virtue of the licenses acquired in the\n\nforeclosure sale. The Deed of Trust acquired after the foreclosure sale provided the\n\nfollowing definition for “Contracts”:         [A]ll of the right, title and interest of [EMC\n\nProducts], including equitable rights, in, to, and under any and all . . . contracts, licenses,\n\nor permits which are directly or indirectly related to, or connected with, the development,\n\nownership, maintenance or operation of the [cement plant].” Despite this language,\n\nLygren testified that EMC Cement terminated the License Agreement before the\n\nforeclosure sale. To corroborate Lygren’s testimony, appellees included an email dated\n\nApril 20, 2011, notifying Walker that EMC Products’ rights under the License Agreement\n\nwith EMC Cement had been cancelled. Therefore, at the time of the foreclosure sale, EMC\n\nProducts had no license to convey to VHSC, and thus, VHSC could not have acquired use\n\nof EMC Cement’s trade secrets by virtue of the License Agreement. Accordingly, we\n\n\n\n\nPike, et al. v. Tex. EMC Mgmt., LLC, et al.

Discussion\n\n        In 2006, appellees hired Pike as the general manager to oversee day-to-day\n\noperations for EMC Products.              As a condition of his employment, Pike signed a\n\nManagement Agreement, which provided that, among other things, he agreed to be\n\n\n\nPike, et al. v. Tex.

Page 26\n\f        to it by the other for any purpose other than as contemplated by this\n        Agreement without the prior written consent of the other.\n\n        As stated earlier, VHSC was formed on April 28, 2011, just a few days prior to the\n\nscheduled foreclosure sale of EMC Products’ assets. At the May 3, 2011 foreclosure sale,\n\nVHSC acquired EMC Products’ assets. On May 5, 2011, Pike resigned from EMC\n\nProducts and immediately went to work for VHSC as its president. The following day,\n\nVHSC filed a patent application naming Pike as the sole inventor. Testimony revealed\n\nthat the substance of the patent application was based on Ronin and EMC Cement’s\n\ntechnology and trade secrets. Even Pike admitted at trial that he gave VHSC highly-\n\nsensitive trade-secret information from EMC Cement. Pike further acknowledged that\n\nhe filed the patent application containing trade-secret information because he was upset\n\nwith Lygren and Ronin.\n\n        Pike later testified that Preston approached him the day after the foreclosure sale\n\nand suggested that he apply for a patent for EMC Products’ technology and information\n\nand assign the patent to VHSC.                Pike gathered “a stack” of material containing\n\ninformation that he and Ronin had spent eighteen months preparing and faxed the\n\ninformation to VHSC’s patent attorney on May 5, 2011. A day later, VHSC filed the patent\n\napplication with twenty-five patent claims. In support of their contention that VHSC\n\ninterfered with Pike’s Management Agreement by inducing Pike to divulge confidential\n\ntrade-secret information obtained from EMC Products prior to the May 3, 2011\n\nforeclosure sale, appellees asked Ronin, the owner of twenty-seven patents, how long the\nPike, et al. v. Tex. EMC Mgmt., LLC, et al.                                           Page 27\n\fprocess is for filing a patent. Ronin responded, “[u]sually takes—if you’re really focused\n\non that, between four and six weeks when you have all experimental data.”\n\n        Based on the foregoing, and viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to\n\nthe jury’s verdict, we conclude that a rational factfinder could conclude that Pike\n\nbreached the Management Agreement by providing VHSC with trade-secret information\n\nobtained during his employment with EMC Products.6 Accordingly, we hold that the\n\nevidence supporting the jury’s finding that Pike breached the Management Agreement is\n\nlegally sufficient. See Reyes, 272 S.W.3d at 592; City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 822; see also\n\nRunge, 57 S.W.3d at 565. Additionally, we cannot say that the jury’s verdict as to this\n\nclaim is so contrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence as to be clearly wrong\n\nand unjust. See Cain, 709 S.W.2d at 176. Thus, we further conclude that the jury’s finding\n\nas to this claim is supported by factually-sufficient evidence. See id.\n\n        However, our analysis of this issue does not stop there. VHSC also challenges the\n\njury’s tortious-interference finding, asserting four arguments: (1) EMC Products lacks\n\nstanding to assert the tortious-interference claim because it currently has no interest in\n\nthe Management Agreement; (2) VHSC could not interfere with the Management\n\nAgreement because VHSC acquired EMC Products’ assets in the foreclosure sale; (3)\n\n\n\n        6Pike also makes a standing argument in this issue, which hinges on the assumption that the breach\ntranspired after the foreclosure sale. However, we reject this argument because we conclude that the jury\ncould have determined that the breach of the Management Agreement transpired prior to the foreclosure\nsale. Accordingly, appellees had a “justiciable interest” in the outcome at the time the breach occurred. See\nAustin Nursing Ctr., Inc. v. Lovato, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894666\"><a href=\"/opinion/894666/austin-nursing-center-inc-v-lovato/\"><span class=\"volume\">171</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">845</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 848 (Tex. 2005).\n\nPike, et al. v.

Page 28\n\fVHSC had a license to use the confidential information; and (4) VHSC’s actions were\n\njustified because it acquired the License and Management Agreements in the foreclosure\n\nsale. Each of these arguments is premised on a faulty assumption—that appellees’\n\ntortious-interference claim is based on events that occurred after the May 3, 2011\n\nforeclosure sale. In Question No. 8 of the charge, the jury was asked: “Did VHSC\n\nintentionally interfere with Pike’s Management Agreement prior to May 4, 2011?” The\n\njury answered Question No. 8 in the affirmative. And based on the evidence outlined\n\nabove with respect to Pike’s Management Agreement, a rational factfinder could have\n\nconcluded that VHSC induced Pike to share EMC Cement’s confidential information—\n\nan act that was prohibited by Pike’s Management Agreement—long before the\n\nforeclosure sale for purposes of filing the patent application and to produce and market\n\nVHSC cement. We therefore conclude that the evidence contains legally- and factually-\n\nsufficient evidence to support the jury’s finding that VHSC tortiously interfered with\n\nPike’s Management Agreement.

While\n\nwe agree that Pike cannot be liable for interfering with his own Management Agreement,\n\nsee, e.g., In re Vesta Ins.

Thus, VHSC and Pike’s\n\nliability is not based on the jury’s conspiracy finding, but on findings of direct liability.\n\nNevertheless, throughout this memorandum opinion, we document VHSC and Pike’s\n\ninvolvement in the conspiracy to default on EMC Products’ loans, sell EMC Products’\n\nassets at a foreclosure sale, and form a new company, VHSC, using the trade-secret\n\ninformation and technology obtained from EMC Cement.\n\n         As stated earlier, “once a civil conspiracy is found, each co-conspirator is\n\nresponsible for the action of any of the co-conspirators which is in furtherance of the\n\nunlawful combination.”           Akin, 661 S.W.2d at 921; see Carroll, 592 S.W.2d at 926.\n\nAdditionally, because we have upheld the jury’s conspiracy finding, all co-conspirators\n\nare jointly and severally liable for actual damages resulting from acts in furtherance of\n\nthe conspiracy.

THE DAMAGES & ATTORNEY’S FEES AWARDS7\n\n        In their third through fifth issues, VHSC and Pike make numerous challenges to\n\nthe damages award. Specifically, they assert that the evidence supporting the damages\n\naward is conclusory and speculative and, thus, is not sufficient. Additionally, they\n\ncontend that appellees’ damage model is not competent evidence; the record contains no\n\nevidence of “costs saved” damages; the trial court’s judgment improperly allowed\n\nappellees to recover multiple times for the same injury; and that the trial court’s judgment\n\nincorrectly calculated the deficiency judgment. Moreover, in their first issue, Walker,\n\nWilson, and Few Ready Mix join in the arguments made by VHSC and Pike and also\n\nassert that appellees’ damage model is not a proper “lost profits” or “market value”\n\nmodel; that appellees’ expert opinions are mixed with fact and fiction and cannot support\n\nthe damages award; and that EMC Cement cannot recover under a damage model that is\n\n\n        7  On appeal, appellees argued that any damages complaints were waived pursuant to Coastal\nTransport Co. v.

But in\n        subsequent cases, the Court has defined “conclusory” and “speculative” to incorporate a\n        broad array of reliability challenges, and as a result, the Coastal Transport exception to\n        Maritime Overseas’s objection requirement has nearly swallowed the rule. Thus, in Texas,\n        appellate challenges to expert evidence are routinely raised and decided under a legal-\n        sufficiency rubric, not the admissibility rubric.\n\nHarvey Brown & Melissa Davis, Eight Gates for Expert Witnesses: Fifteen Years Later, 52 HOUS.

Therefore, despite the fact that appellants did not object in\nthe trial court regarding damages, given the trend of allowing parties to challenge expert-witness testimony\nunder the legal-sufficiency rubric, we will address appellants’ damages complaints in this appeal.\n\nPike, et al. v. Tex. EMC Mgmt., LLC, et al.                                                          Page 31\n\fpremised on the diminished value of a partnership interest.

Discussion\n\n        On appeal, many of appellants’ arguments on damages center on the proposition\n\nthat Lygren’s opinion is unreliable and suffers from analytical gaps because it is allegedly\n\nbased on speculation and improper data. In particular, appellants challenge Lygren’s\n\nassumption of a 19% annual growth rate through 2021, Miller’s assumption of an 11-18%\n\nannual growth rate through 2018, and projections of rising sales prices and volumes,\n\ndespite EMC Products’ track record of unprofitability.\n\n        Expert testimony is unreliable if “there is simply too great an analytical gap\n\nbetween the data [relied upon] and the opinion proffered.” Gammill v.

Lygren’s Testimony About the Value of EMC Products\n\n        At trial, Lygren testified that the value of the Texas EMC business related to the\n\nJewett plant, including EMC technology was “about $12 million, excluding the value of\n\nthe plant itself” before the foreclosure sale. After the foreclosure sale, the business was\n\nvalued at zero. Later, Lygren stated that the value of the plant as carried on the books of\n\nEMC Products as of March 2011 was “about $4 million.” Lygren purportedly arrived at\n\nthese values based on two theories: (1) a comparison of EMC Products’ operation in\n\nTexas to the proposed partnership with C-Change in California; and (2) EMC Products’\n\nfinancial records from 2006-2010, Pike’s projections about future growth, historical\n\nrecords of cement sales in Texas, and generally-accepted accounting methods.\n\n\nPike, et al. v. Tex. EMC Mgmt., LLC, et al.                                           Page 35\n\fLygren’s assessment that the business had fair-market value of $12 million prior to the\n\nforeclosure sale was based on an evaluation of EMC Products’ projected EBITDA8 for the\n\nyears 2011 through 2020. Lygren, an individual with a Bachelor of Science in Business\n\nfrom the Norwegian School of Business and over forty years’ of experience in business,\n\ntestified that EBITDA is recognized and commonly used for assessing the value of a\n\nbusiness. Appellants’ damages expert, Todd Burchett, agreed that an EBITDA-based\n\nanalysis is an acceptable valuation methodology, though he asserted that the\n\nmethodology was not properly applied in this case.\n\n        In any event, Lygren noted that he arrived at his valuation by considering the\n\nfollowing: (1) EMC Products’ financial statements from 2006-10, which notably reflected\n\npositive EBITDA figures; (2) Federal Accounting Standards and Procedures; (3)\n\nInternational Private Equity Fund and Venture Capital Guidelines; (4) Pike’s projections\n\nfor EMC Products’ earnings and expenses for 2011; (5) American Coal Ash Association\n\nreports on consumption and production of fly ash in the United States; (6) United States\n\nGeological Survey reports on cement consumption in Texas; and (7) deposition testimony\n\nof Walker. Using this information, Lygren made the following determinations: (1) the\n\namount of Portland Cement that was sold in Texas from 2005-2012; (2) the market\n\npotential for CemPozz, a substitute product for Portland Cement; (3) market penetration\n\n\n\n\n        8 EBITDA is described as the business’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and\namortization.\n\nPike, et al. v. Tex. EMC Mgmt., LLC, et al.                                              Page 36\n\ffor CemPozz from 2005-2010, which Lygren characterized as having “significant upside\n\npotential”; (4) EMC Products’ average EBITDA from 2006-2010 as $458,003;9 (5) the\n\nvolume of products EMC Products would have sold in 2011 (86,273 tons); (6) the price\n\nper ton sale price EMC Products would have received in 2011 ($52.97), based on sales\n\nprices from 2006-10; (7) cost of goods sold per ton for 2011 ($34.52), based on costs from\n\n2006-10; and (8) administrative, sales, and marketing costs for 2011, based on Pike’s\n\nestimates ($573,328 for general administrative expenses and $199,291 for sales and\n\nmarketing). Using these figures, Lygren extrapolated that EMC Products would have\n\nhad an EBITDA of $819,083 for 2011. When using a 20% inflation rate to discount cash\n\nflows over a nine-year period, Lygren calculated the net present value of the EBITDA of\n\n2011 to be $682,569.\n\n        Next, Lygren projected a 19% annual increase in sales volume from 2012 through\n\n2020. This projection was based on a 48% increase in sales volume that Pike estimated\n\nfor 2011 over 2010 and EMC Products’ historical market penetration, which was small at\n\nthe time of the foreclosure sale. Additionally, Lygren projected the selling price per ton\n\nthat EMC Products would receive for sales from 2012 through 2020, based on prices from\n\n2005 to 2010. The price projections increased from $55.26 per ton in 2012 to $73.61 per ton\n\nin 2020. Lygren did the same for cost of goods sold and administrative, sales, and\n\n\n\n\n        9 Lygren recounted that EMC Products’ EBITDA for 2006-10 was as follows: (1) $506,149 for 2006;\n(2) $745,071 for 2007; (3) $389,914 for 2008; (4) $461,499 for 2009; and (5) $187,308 for 2010.\n\nPike, et al. v.

With respect to administrative, sales, and\n\nmarketing costs, Lygren applied a 1.5% inflation rate. From these figures, Lygren derived\n\na yearly EBITDA for 2012 through 2020, and after applying the previously-mentioned\n\n20% discount rate, Lygren determined the present value of the EBITDA figures for 2012\n\nthrough 2020.\n\n        Based on the foregoing testimony, we cannot say that Lygren’s testimony was\n\nunreliable on its face.

The record evidence reflects that EMC Cement’s technology and trade secrets\n\nwere developed for many years at a cost of millions of dollars. Lygren noted that he\n\npersonally invested $20 million in the development of technology that ultimately resulted\n\nin the CemPozz and PozzoSlag products.\n\n        Presumably, VHSC saved some on development costs, especially given that we\n\nhave affirmed VHSC’s liability under appellees’ misappropriation-of-trade-secrets claim.\n\nHowever, appellees do not direct us to record evidence reflecting the amount of\n\ndevelopment costs saved by VHSC as a result of the misappropriation.

Miller is a financial consultant with an MBA in finance and\n\na Master of Science in accounting. Previously, Miller worked for Coopers & Lybrand and\n\nhas had her own consulting firm since 1996. In her deposition testimony, Miller reviewed\n\nEMC Products’ balance sheets, profit-and-loss statements, and EBITDA statements from\n\n2003 through March of 2011. Miller asserted that she applied general business valuation\n\nstandards of the American Society of Appraisers and the American Institute of Certified\n\nPublic Accountants in arriving at her valuation of the business. Miller recounted that she\n\nused the EBITDA figures from 2006 through March of 2011 to forecast future earnings\n\n\n\n\n        10 However, despite our conclusion that the damage theory based on the development costs saved\nby VHSC is not supported by legally-sufficient evidence, we can still affirm the $1.5 million award for\nmisappropriation of trade secrets. In the charge, the jury was asked to calculate damages for\nmisappropriation of trade secrets based on: (1) the value that a reasonably prudent investor would have\npaid for use of the trade secrets in Texas; and (2) development costs saved by VHSC. In its order granting,\nin part, appellants’ motion for JNOV, the trial court set aside the jury’s $1.5 million award with respect to\nthe value a reasonably prudent investor would have paid for use of the trade secrets in Texas. We believe\nthat the trial court erred in setting aside that finding. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 301; see also Tanner v. Nationwide\nMut. Fire Ins.

And similar to Lygren,\n\nappellants did not raise this challenge during trial or when either Lygren or Miller\n\ntestified. Nevertheless, like Lygren, we cannot say that Miller’s testimony was unreliable\n\non its face. See Beaumont, 205 S.W.3d at 621; Durham Transp.

Miller’s testimony was based on\n\nwidely-accepted EBITDA-valuation methodology and was supported by data, including\n\nEMC Products’ financial records. Furthermore, Miller linked the basis of her testimony\n\nwith her conclusions about the value of the business. We therefore cannot say that\n\nMiller’s testimony was founded on unsupported assumptions and, thus, incompetent.\n\nSee Earle, 998 S.W.2d at 890; see also Justiss, 397 S.W.3d at 156; Havner, 953 S.W.2d at 712.\n\n        4.

Counsel for appellees explained the\n\nnumbers of hours spent by counsel in this trial and that a lot of effort was made to get up\n\nto speed on this case both before and after trial days. Counsel further asserted that “it\n\ntakes more time to represent the plaintiff than it does to represent the defendant. . . . But\n\n\n\n\nPike, et al. v. Tex.

See TEX. R. CIV. P. 193.6(a). On appeal, Walker, Wilson,\n\nand Few Ready Mix do not address the exception for unfair surprise or prejudice, but\n\nrather focus on good cause. Given that counsel for appellees explained that the fees\n\ncorresponded with work associated with trial—largely an event attended by all parties\n\nin this case, we cannot say that the record demonstrates a finding of unfair surprise or\n\nprejudice. See id. at R. 193.6(b). Therefore, we cannot say that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion in admitting the billing records.

Moreover, the\n\nneed to segregate fees is a question of law that appellate courts review de novo. See id. at\n\n312. However, a recognized exception to the duty to segregate arises when the attorney’s\n\nfees rendered are in connection with claims arising out of the same transaction and are\n\nso interrelated that their “prosecution or defense entails proof or denial of essentially the\n\nsame facts.” Sterling, 822 S.W.2d at 10; see Ski River Dev., Inc. v.

Walker and Wilson’s Monthly Payments to Texas Central Bank\n\n        Walker and Wilson also argue that they are entitled to recover sums they “loaned”\n\nto EMC Products. Their claim is premised on the jury’s award of $250,000 to Walker and\n\nWilson for “unpaid loans made to EMC Products,” which they contend omits funds that\n\nare still owed. Specifically, Walker and Wilson allege that they should be reimbursed for\n\nthe $25,000 monthly principal payments made to the bank from July 2009 to December\n\n2010.\n\n        At the outset, we note that Walker and Wilson have not cited any authority to\n\nsupport their claim for these amounts. See TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1(i). Moreover, under the\n\nexpress terms of the Partnership Agreement, any payments made by Walker and Wilson\n\nto the bank as a result of their personal guarantees were deemed to be additional capital\n\ncontributions to the partnership, rather than loans.      Specifically, section 2.6 of the\n\nPartnership Agreement provided:\n\n        Deemed Additional Capital Contributions. A Partner shall be deemed to\n        have made an additional Capital Contribution to the Partnership if and to\nPike, et al. v. Tex. EMC Mgmt., LLC, et al.

EMC Products’ Liability Under the Loan Agreement\n\n        In this sub-issue, VHSC contends that EMC Products is liable for the amount\n\nallegedly remaining due on the loan. The record reflects that Walker and Wilson wired\n\na combined sum of $3,937,418—the full amount outstanding on the EMC Products loan—\n\nto Texas Capital Bank. VHSC asserts that this money was sent on behalf of Few Ready\n\nMix to pay for its acquisition of the loan. VHSC, Pike, Walker, Wilson, and Few Ready\n\nMix moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on this complaint.\n\n        A trial court may disregard a jury’s verdict and render a JNOV if there is no\n\nevidence to support the jury’s findings or if a directed verdict would have been proper.\n\nBrown v.

Wood\n\nnoted that the beneficiary listed on the document was EMC Products, not the bank.\n\nThough Wood believed that the wire transfers were for the purchase of the note, he\n\nadmitted that there was not any reference to the purchase of the note in bank documents.\n\nThe bank honored the beneficiary named in the wire transfer and applied the funds to\n\nEMC Products’ account. The transactions were recorded in the bank ledger, and as a\n\nresult of the transactions, the principal balance of the note was zero.\n\n        Given that bank documents do not reflect a purchase of the note, but rather the\n\npaying off of the note, we cannot say that the jury erred in relying on the bank’s records\n\nin finding that EMC Products complied with the loan agreement. As such, we hold that\n\nthe trial court did not err in failing to enter judgment notwithstanding the verdict on\n\nVHSC’s deficiency counterclaim. See TEX. R. CIV.

Discussion\n\n          The complaints about the permanent injunction correspond with the\n\nmisappropriation-of-trade-secrets claim alleged at trial. The trial court made numerous\n\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law. Ultimately, the trial court concluded that EMC\n\nCement does not face imminent harm based on the following fact findings:\n\n          1. VHSC is not currently using any of EMC Cement’s claimed trade\n             secrets.\n\n          2. VHSC discontinued use of any EMC Cement’s claimed trade secrets\n             shortly after the foreclosure sale.\n\n          3. Soon after the foreclosure sale, VHSC removed the equipment\n             modifications EMC Cement used to mill cementitious material.\n\n          4. Within several weeks of the foreclosure sale, VHSC began using\n             different materials in its milling process, by among other things,\n             substituting lime for Portland Cement.\n\n          5. In 2012, VHSC began using entirely different milling equipment that\n             employed a different technique to produce cementitious materials.\n\nAnd in concluding that EMC Cement did not face imminent harm, the trial court stated\n\nthat the Amended Final Judgment awarded future damages for the misappropriation of\n\ntrade secrets; thus, EMC Cement already obtained an adequate legal remedy and is not\n\n\nPike, et al. v.

Contrary to the assertions of cross-appellees,\n\nappellants have challenged the trial court’s findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n\n        1.      Existence of a Wrongful Act\n\n        As we have concluded earlier, the evidence supporting cross-appellants’\n\nmisappropriation-of-trade-secrets claim is legally and factually sufficient. As such, cross-\n\nappellants have established the first prong for a permanent injunction—a wrongful act.\n\n        2.      Imminent Harm\n\n        The next prong—imminent harm—was hotly contested at trial and was the focus\n\nof the trial court’s findings of fact. On cross-appeal, cross-appellants contend that harm\n\nis presumed in a misappropriation-of-trade-secrets case when a defendant possesses\n\ntrade secrets and is in a position to use them. Cross-appellees, on the other hand, argue\n\nthat there is no basis for finding imminent harm, especially considering that the trial\n\ncourt, in its findings of fact, stated that VHSC is no longer using the claimed trade secrets.\n\nWith this prong, we necessarily have to analyze the propriety of the trial court’s findings\n\nof fact and conclusions of law.\n\n        Findings of fact entered in a case tried to the court have the same force and dignity\n\nas a jury verdict.

Id.\n\n        At trial, Pike admitted that VHSC was using EMC Cement trade secrets, including\n\nthe VBMs, in May 2013, or, in other words, two years after the foreclosure sale.\n\nAdditionally, immediately after the foreclosure sale, VHSC sold the same PozzoSlag\n\nproduct that EMC Products had developed, and testimony at trial revealed that VHSC\n\nwas still selling PozzoSlag at the time of trial. Finally, the evidence indicated that Pike\n\nworked with Ronin to develop processes for using Rotary Ball Mills to manufacture\n\nenergetically-modified cement, and at the time of trial, VHSC was using this same\n\ntechnology to manufacture PozzoSlag.\n\n        In light of this unchallenged evidence, it is our belief that a reasonable factfinder\n\ncould not have concluded that VHSC stopped using EMC Cement trade secrets shortly\n\nafter the foreclosure sale. Additionally, a reasonable factfinder could have concluded\n\nthat VHSC was using EMC Cement trade secrets at the time the permanent injunction\n\n\nPike, et al. v. Tex.

As such, we conclude that the trial court’s findings of fact regarding VHSC’s\n\nusage of EMC Cement’s trade secrets are not supported by legally-sufficient evidence.\n\nAnd given that the underlying fact findings are not supported by legally-sufficient\n\nevidence, we must reverse the trial court’s conclusion of law that EMC Cement did not\n\nface imminent harm.11\n\n        And despite the fact that the trial court’s findings of fact and conclusions of law\n\npertaining to imminent harm are not supported by sufficient evidence, we also agree with\n\ncross-appellants’ contention that when a defendant possesses trade secrets and is in a\n\nposition to use them, harm is presumed.

In fact, as stated\nearlier in this memorandum opinion, the jury was asked two damages questions with respect to the\nmisappropriation-of-trade-secrets claim. Both of the questions asked about past damages—namely, what\na reasonably prudent investor would have paid for use of EMC Cement’s trade secrets in Texas and what\ndevelopment costs were saved by VHSC.\n\nPike, et al. v.

However, the record shows that immediately after the\n\nforeclosure sale, Pike went to work for VHSC, another cement-manufacturing company,\n\nand tried to patent EMC Products’ trade secrets. Furthermore, Pike admitted that VHSC\n\ncontinued to use EMC Products’ trade secrets until at least May 2013. Clearly, Pike and\n\nVHSC were in possession of EMC Cement’s trade-secret information and were in a\n\nposition to use it.

(“When the term ‘irreparable injury’ is used with ‘no adequate remedy at\n\nlaw[,]’ the former term is a misnomer, because if an injury is irreparable, there is no\n\nremedy for it, adequate or inadequate.”). Cross-appellees contend that EMC was not\n\nirreparably harmed by the alleged misappropriation of trade secrets because Pike was an\n\nindependent contractor, and because the damage award for this claim already considered\n\nfuture damages.\n\n        We first reject cross-appellees’ latter contention about future damages.          As\n\nexplained in footnote 9, the jury was asked about past damages in the charge question\n\npertaining to misappropriation of trade secrets. As such, we cannot say that the damage\n\naward already considered future damages.\n\n        Additionally, we are not persuaded by cross-appellees’ contention that Pike’s\n\nwork status somehow affects the analysis of this issue. The record evidence clearly\n\nestablished that Pike worked at EMC Products and had access to EMC Cement’s trade\n\nsecrets. The record also indicates that Pike, on behalf of VHSC, used the trade-secret\n\ninformation to attempt to file a patent, as well as market cement products manufactured\n\nby VHSC.\n\n        Furthermore, numerous courts have held the following:\n\n           “We agree with the trial court’s disregarding of the answer to the issue and its\n            ruling that where the uncontradicted evidence shows that a former employee\nPike, et al. v.
