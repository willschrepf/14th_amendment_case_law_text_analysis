SemGroup sold oil to and\ntraded oil futures with Appellees, downstream oil purchasers.\nThe producers took no actions to protect themselves in case\n\n\n\n\n                              10\n\fof SemGroup’s insolvency. The downstream purchasers did;\nin the case of default, they could set off the amount they owed\nSemGroup for oil by the amount SemGroup would owe them\nfor the value of the outstanding futures trades. Accordingly,\nwhen SemGroup filed for bankruptcy, the downstream\npurchasers were paid in full while the oil producers were paid\nonly in part.\n\n       Because the oil producers did not take precautionary\nmeasures to ensure payment in case of SemGroup’s\ninsolvency, all they have to rely on are local laws they\ncontend give them automatically perfected security interests\nor trust rights in the oil that ended up in the hands of the\ndownstream purchasers. But the parties who took precautions\nagainst insolvency do not act as insurers to those who took\nnone. Accordingly, we affirm the grant of summary\njudgment in the downstream purchasers’ favor.\n\n                    I.     BACKGROUND\n\nSemGroup’s Two Businesses\n\n       SemGroup L.P. and its subsidiaries (jointly and\nseverally referred to as “SemGroup”) provided “midstream”\noil services. It purchased oil from producers and resold it to\ndownstream purchasers. It also traded financial options\ncontracts for the right to buy or sell oil at a fixed price on a\nfuture date. At the end of the fiscal year preceding\nbankruptcy, SemGroup’s revenues were $13.2 billion.\n\n       Two of SemGroup’s operating companies, SemCrude,\nL.P. and Eaglwing, L.P., purchased oil from thousands of\nwells in several states and from thousands of oil producers,\nincluding from Appellants, producers located in Texas,\nKansas, and Oklahoma. The producers act on behalf of many\nparties who have interests in the oil at the wellhead. These\n\n\n\n\n                              11\n\finterest owners include the person or entity who owns the\nland in fee simple, and thus owns the rights to the minerals.\nThat person or entity transfers the mineral rights to an oil\ncompany through a lease. The company holds the “working\ninterest”—the right to drill and sell the oil from the leased\nland. The working-interest owners appoint an operator to\nwork the well. Most of the producers in this appeal are\nowners of working interests or operators.\n\n      After purchase, SemGroup moved the oil via trucks\nand pipelines and stored it in major aggregation centers in\nOklahoma, Kansas, and elsewhere. Per industry custom,\nSemGroup purchased the oil on credit, paying for it on the\n20th day of the month following the sale. For example, oil\npurchased in January would be paid for on February 20.\n\n       SemGroup always paid the producers for the oil in full\nuntil the bankruptcy filing. It then resold the product to\ndownstream purchasers, including to Appellees, J. Aron &\nCompany and BP Oil Supply Co., both large oil distributors.\nSemGroup expressly warranted to the downstream purchasers\nthat it sold them oil “free from all royalties, liens, and\nencumbrances.” See, e.g., Conoco General Provisions § B,\nJ.A. 2505. Again, per industry custom the downstream\npurchasers bought the oil on credit, with payment due the\n20th of the following month. J. Aron and BP had no\ncommunication with the thousands of oil producers from\nwhom SemGroup purchased the oil and only knew of the\nexistence of some of the larger producers. J. Aron and BP\ndispute whether they even purchased any of Appellants’ oil\nand contend that Appellants cannot trace the oil they sold, as\nit was mixed with millions of barrels of oil from innumerable\nother producers.\n\n       Until the bankruptcy filing, J. Aron and BP paid in full\nfor the oil they bought. BP also sold oil to SemGroup, so\n\n\n\n\n                              12\n\fwhen payment was due they would net out their obligations—\ni.e., if BP bought $10 million from SemGroup and SemGroup\nbought $8 million from BP, then BP would just pay $2\nmillion to SemGroup.\n\n        In addition to midstream oil services, SemGroup also\ntraded oil futures with J. Aron and BP. This trading strategy\nlead to SemGroup’s insolvency. Essentially SemGroup bet\nthat the price of oil would drop, while J. Aron and BP wanted\nto secure a low price of oil in the event that prices would rise.\nSemGroup would win the bet if the oil price dropped while J.\nAron and BP would win if the price rose. The (simplified)\nmechanics are as follows.\n\n        SemGroup sold what are known as call options. In\nexchange for an upfront premium, the purchaser of the call\noption received the right to purchase oil at a specified price\nand date. To illustrate, if in December J. Aron purchased the\nright to buy 10,000 barrels of oil at $50 a barrel on March 1,\nbut the market price that date was $45 a barrel, that option\nwas worthless because J. Aron could buy oil at a cheaper\nprice on the market; the $50 buying right did not save J. Aron\nmoney. SemGroup therefore would make money: it received\nthe upfront premium J. Aron paid for the option, but did not\nend up losing the bet because it would not have to sell oil at\nless than market price. Conversely, if the market price on\nMarch 1 was $55 a barrel, J. Aron would be “in the\nmoney”—SemGroup would have to sell J. Aron 10,000\nbarrels of oil at $50 a barrel, $5 below the market rate.\nSemGroup thus would lose $50,000 dollars on the option\nbecause, if J. Aron did not have the buying right, SemGroup\ncould have sold that oil on the market for the going price of\n$55. These options did not “physically settle.” That is,\nSemGroup would not actually sell these oil barrels; it would\njust owe J. Aron $50,000.\n\n\n\n\n                               13\n\f        SemGroup’s gambling strategy was in stark contrast\nwith hedging oil prices. To hedge a drop in the price of oil,\nSemGroup could have acquired put options—the right to sell\noil at a specified price. This would protect them against price\ndrops while still allowing them to take advantage of selling at\nhigh oil prices.\n\n        As it turns out, SemGroup was a bad gambler. Oil\nprices rose throughout 2007 and 2008. Its CEO believed that\neventually oil prices would drop. So each time SemGroup\nlost money on these options, rather than realize the financial\nloss, it would sell more options to cover the loss. This is\nreferred to as “rolling” in the industry, and is essentially\ndoubling down on a lost bet. For example, if SemGroup lost\n$1 million on the March 1 trade, it would resell new options\nand collect $1 million in new premiums, thus betting that the\nprice of oil would drop on a date in the future. SemGroup\nthought that, if it kept “rolling” these options, eventually the\nprice of oil would drop and all the options would be\nworthless. If that happened, SemGroup would have acquired\nall of these upfront premium payments at no cost. This\ndoubling-down strategy had a downside, however. Rolling\noptions greatly increased SemGroup’s exposure to future\nlosses. By July 2008 it was exposed to a potential $2.8\nbillion loss if the option bets did not pay off.\n\nLiquidity Problems, Setoff Rights, and the Bankruptcy\nFiling\n\n       SemGroup had to pledge cash collateral to margin\naccounts to cover its exposure on the options. The cash in\nthese margin accounts assured the trading counterparties that\nSemGroup could pay for any loss on the options. The margin\nexposure was calculated by the “mark to market” method—\nthe amount SemGroup would owe the counterparty if the\noption liquidated that day. As SemGroup’s exposure on these\n\n\n\n\n                              14\n\foptions increased, so did its margin requirements. Eventually\nit ran out of funds to meet those margin obligations, causing\nits bankruptcy.\n\n       Before the bankruptcy, J. Aron and BP started buying\noil from, and trading options with, SemGroup. In November\n2007, J. Aron entered into a master agreement governing its\nrelationship with SemGroup, and in April 2008 BP entered\ninto a similar arrangement. Under the agreements, in the\nevent of SemGroup’s default J. Aron and BP could set off any\noutstanding amount due for oil purchases with the amount\nowed on options trades. Until SemGroup’s default, J. Aron\nand BP always paid in full for their oil purchases and never\nexercised a setoff right.\n\n        Through the late spring and early summer 2008, oil\nprices kept rising and SemGroup continued losing on its\ntrades. It failed to receive additional financing to meet its\never-increasing margin obligations. On July 17, 2008, as set\nout in their agreement, J. Aron asked SemGroup for adequate\nassurance of performance and that SemGroup meet certain\ncredit-support thresholds. When SemGroup did not respond,\nJ. Aron called a default. The parties thus set off the\noutstanding amounts due. J. Aron owed to SemGroup $435\nmillion in oil purchases, and SemGroup owed to J. Aron $345\nmillion in outstanding options trades. Accordingly, J. Aron\nowed $90 million, the net amount after the oil and options\nwere set off.\n\n     On July 22, 2008, soon after J. Aron called the default,\nSemGroup filed for bankruptcy. This triggered a default as to\nBP, so it also set off the prepetition amount it owed\n\n\n\n\n                             15\n\fSemGroup for oil less the amount SemGroup owed it for the\noptions trades. Consequently, BP owed $10 million.1\n\nBankruptcy Proceedings\n\n        Following its Chapter 11 filing, more than a thousand\noil producers were unpaid. Oil producers, purchasers, and\nSemGroup’s lending banks inundated the Bankruptcy Court\nwith adversary proceedings and motions to distribute\nSemGroup’s assets.        The Court established omnibus\nprocedures to determine the producers’ rights and priorities\nversus the banks, with a single adversary proceeding for each\nstate where the producers sold product. The relative priority\nof the producers and downstream purchasers was preserved\nfor later rulings.\n\n       In those rulings, the Bankruptcy Court first held that\nthe lending banks’ security interests in SemGroup’s assets\ntook priority over any purported lien or trust rights granted\nunder state law. It certified appeals directly to our Court as\nmatters of first impression, 28 U.S.C. § 158(d)(2), but the\nproducers and lending banks settled while the appeals were\npending. By stipulation, the producers reserved their right to\npursue their claims against the downstream purchasers and to\nappeal these rulings in the future.\n\n       Meanwhile, J. Aron and BP filed separate adversary\nproceedings where they sought to tender the amount they\nowed to the bankruptcy estate in exchange for a release from\nall liability. The producers also filed nearly 30 separate\nlawsuits against J. Aron and BP in state and federal courts.\nThese suits were transferred to the Bankruptcy Court for\n\n1\n  There is no contention before us that the Bankruptcy Code\nprohibited these setoffs. See generally 11 U.S.C. §§ 362(b)\nand 553.\n\n\n\n\n                             16\n\fresolution.     In September 2009, it confirmed the\nreorganization plan by which J. Aron and BP’s tendered\nfunds were turned over to the producers for full payment of\noil delivered between July 2 and July 21, 2008.2 The\ntendered funds also paid off 12.9% of the amount owed for\noil sold from June 1 to July 1, 2008.\n\n       After a discovery process involving more than 100\nparties, over 150 depositions, and millions of pages of\ndocuments, J. Aron and BP moved for summary judgment\nagainst the Appellant-Producers (hereafter, the “Producers”).\nThe Bankruptcy Court filed proposed findings of facts and\nconclusions of law recommending summary judgment in\nfavor of J. Aron and BP. It concluded in exceptional depth\nand easily understood language that there was no evidence of\nfraud and that J. Aron and BP purchased the oil from\nSemGroup free of any purported security interest either as (1)\nbuyers for value, or (2) as buyers in the ordinary course. In re\nSemCrude, L.P., 504 B.R. 39, 44 (Bankr. D. Del. 2013). The\nDistrict Court overruled the Producers’ objections to the\nBankruptcy Court’s recommendation and adopted it. In re\nSemcrude, L.P., No. 14-CV-41 (SLR), 2015 WL 4594516 (D.\nDel. July 30, 2015).\n\nSummary of Claims on Appeal\n\n      The Producers’ claims do not rely on bankruptcy law.\nThey are based on state statutes and common law fraud. The\n\n2\n   This followed from 11 U.S.C. § 503(b)(9), whereby an\nallowable administrative expense includes “the value of any\ngoods received by the debtor within 20 days before the date\nof commencement of a case under this title in which the\ngoods have been sold to the debtor in the ordinary course of\nsuch debtor’s business.”\n\n\n\n\n                              17\n\fTexas and Kansas Producers argue that, under their states’\nnonuniform amendments to the Uniform Commercial Code,\nthey had perfected security interests in the oil they sold to\nSemGroup and J. Aron and BP took the oil subject to these\ninterests. The Oklahoma Producers bring separate claims\nderived from an Oklahoma statute they contend imposes an\nimplied trust for their benefit. They also claim to have an\nequitable interest in the oil proceeds J. Aron and BP took to\nset off the options debt.\n\n                    II.    JURISDICTION\n\n        We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291 to review\nthe District Court’s grant of summary judgment. Yet the\nProducers argue that the District Court lacked subject matter\njurisdiction even though the confirmed Chapter 11 plan\nexpressly provided for jurisdiction over this controversy.\n\n        The Bankruptcy Court determined that the proceeding\nbefore it was non-core,3 but both it and the District Court\nexercised jurisdiction because that proceeding was “related\nto” SemGroup’s bankruptcy case.                 See 28 U.S.C.\n§ 157(c)(1)(“A bankruptcy judge may hear a proceeding that\nis not a core proceeding but that is otherwise related to a case\nunder title 11.”); 28 U.S.C. § 1334(b) (“[T]he district courts\nshall have original but not exclusive jurisdiction of all civil\nproceedings . . . related to cases under title 11.”).\n\n      The Bankruptcy and District Courts correctly\ndetermined that “related-to” bankruptcy jurisdiction exists\nhere. That is so where the adversary proceeding has any\n“conceivabl[e]” effect on the bankruptcy estate. Nuveen\n\n3\n  In contrast to non-core, a core bankruptcy proceeding\nincludes, among other things, estate administration, claims,\nplans, and debt discharges. 28 U.S.C. § 157(b)(2).\n\n\n\n\n                              18\n\fMun. Trust ex rel. Nuveen High Yield Mun. Bond Fund v.\nWithumSmith Brown, P.C., 692 F.3d 283, 293 (3d Cir. 2012)\n(citing Pacor, Inc. v. Higgins, 743 F.2d 984 (3d Cir. 1984)).\nAll we ask is whether the “outcome could alter the debtor’s\nrights, liabilities, options, or freedom of action (either\npositively or negatively) and which in any way impacts upon\nthe handling and administration of the bankrupt estate.” Id. at\n294 (quoting Pacor, 743 F.2d at 994).\n\n        Related-to jurisdiction—like other types of federal\njurisdiction—is determined at the time of filing. Id. (citing\nGrupo Dataflux v. Atlas Global Grp., L.P., 541 U.S. 567,\n570–71 (2004)). The Producers thus miss the mark by\narguing that, because the plan has now been confirmed, the\nbankruptcy estates can no longer be affected. See id.\n(“[C]onfirmation of a bankruptcy plan does not divest a\ndistrict court of related-to jurisdiction over pre-confirmation\nclaims.”) (citations omitted).\n\n       At the time of filing of these adversary actions and\nrelated Producers’ suits, which was prior to plan\nconfirmation, the Producers’ claims unquestionably could\nhave affected the bankruptcy estates. Resolving these claims\nsets the competing rights among creditors to the estates’\nfunds. Moreover, if the Bankruptcy Court had disallowed the\nsetoff process (whereby J. Aron and BP set off the amount\nowed for the oil less what was owed on the options contracts),\nthey might have had to return money to SemGroup’s estate.\nAccordingly, the Bankruptcy and District Courts possessed\nrelated-to jurisdiction, and we have jurisdiction to hear this\nappeal.\n\n               III.   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n      We exercise plenary review over a grant of summary\njudgment. Rosen v. Bezner, 996 F.2d 1527, 1530 (3d Cir.\n\n\n\n\n                              19\n\f1993). It is proper when, viewing the evidence in the light\nmost favorable to the opposing party, “there is no genuine\ndispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to\njudgment as a matter of law.” Id.; Fed. R. Civ. P. 56.\n\n                       IV.     ANALYSIS\n\n        As noted, the Texas and Kansas Producers rely on\ntheir states’ nonuniform amendments to the Uniform\nCommercial Code, which they argue give them automatically\nperfected security interests in the oil they sold to SemGroup\nthat J. Aron and BP ultimately received. We first conclude\nthat the Producers do not have a perfected security interest\neven if Texas or Kansas law applied. Accordingly, J. Aron\nand BP purchased the oil from SemGroup free of any lien as\nbuyers for value. U.C.C. § 9-317(b).\n\n       Next, we turn to these Producers’ fraud claim and\nagree with the Bankruptcy and District Courts that there is no\nevidence of fraud. J. Aron and BP took precautions to protect\nthemselves in case SemGroup became insolvent, but they did\nnot defraud SemGroup’s other creditors.\n\n        To conclude, we address the Oklahoma Producers’\nclaims based on an Oklahoma statute they contend imposes a\ntrust relationship between them and anyone who purchases\ntheir oil. That interpretation lacks logic and is not supported\nby the statute’s text.\n\nA.     The U.C.C. Claim\n\n        Because we must parse uniform and state-specific\nversions of U.C.C. Article 9 (the Article on security interests),\nit is helpful to explain briefly a few fundamental concepts. A\nsecurity interest is “an interest in personal property or fixtures\nwhich secures payment or performance of an obligation.”\n\n\n\n\n                               20\n\fU.C.C. § 1-201(b)(35). In other words, it is a lien on a piece\nof property that secures payment of a debt. If the debt is not\npaid, the person who holds the security interest can repossess\nthat property—i.e., take it in satisfaction of the debt. The\nperson who owns that security interest is called the “secured\nparty.” U.C.C. § 9-102(a)(73) (“‘Secured party’ means: (A)\na person in whose favor a security interest is created or\nprovided for under a security agreement, whether or not any\nobligation to be secured is outstanding.”). The property\nsubject to the security interest is called “collateral.” U.C.C.\n§ 9-102(a)(12). And a “debtor” is the person with an\nownership interest in that collateral. U.C.C. § 9-102(a)(28)\n(“‘Debtor’ means: (A) a person having an interest, other than\na security interest or other lien, in the collateral, whether or\nnot the person is an obligor. . . .”) (emphasis added).\n\n        The Producers contend that they sold the oil to\nSemGroup on credit subject to a security interest—that is,\nthey retained a lien in the oil as long as SemGroup had not\npaid them for that oil, and if SemGroup did not pay for the oil\nthe Producers could hypothetically repossess it. The oil they\nsold here is the “collateral,” and SemGroup, who purchased\nthe oil, is the “debtor.” The Producers further assert that their\nsecurity interests continued in the oil even after SemGroup\nresold it to J. Aron and BP. See U.C.C. § 9-315(a)(1) (“a\nsecurity interest or agricultural lien continues in collateral\nnotwithstanding sale”). Thus, J. Aron and BP received the oil\nsubject to the security interest, and, because SemGroup did\nnot pay the Producers in full, the Producers had the right to\nreclaim the oil from J. Aron and BP. Accordingly, J. Aron\nand BP would have to return to the Producers the value of the\noil used to set off options debt with SemGroup.\n\n       J. Aron and BP, however, contend that they took the\noil as buyers for value and thus free of any security interest.\nSee U.C.C. § 9-317(b) (“[A] buyer, other than a secured\n\n\n\n\n                               21\n\fparty, of . . . goods . . . takes free of a security interest . . . if\nthe buyer gives value and receives delivery of the collateral\nwithout knowledge of the security interest . . . and before it is\nperfected.”). This defense is simple: if a security interest is\nnot perfected,4 a buyer takes the property free of that security\ninterest unless the buyer actually knew of the security\ninterest. As discussed below, we conclude that J. Aron and\nBP qualify as buyers for value. To do so, we address whether\n(1) the security interests were perfected, (2) J. Aron and BP\nactually bought the oil or acquired it as secured parties, and\n(3) they knew the Producers’ security interests even existed.\n\n       1.      Security interests were not perfected.\n\n       To perfect a security interest, in most instances a party\nmust file a financing statement in the appropriate state office.\nSee U.C.C. § 9-310(a) (“[A] financing statement must be filed\nto perfect all security interests.”). Here, the Texas and\nKansas Producers did not file a financing statement or take\nany other steps to perfect their security interests. Instead,\nthey urge us to apply their states’ versions of the U.C.C.\nbecause they contain nonuniform amendments that the\nProducers argue give oil producers an automatically perfected\nsecurity interest in the oil they produced. See Tex. Bus. &\nCom. Code § 9.343 (“(a) This section provides a security\n\n4\n   The holder of a “perfected” security interest has much\nstronger recourse to enforce that interest against third parties\nthan if the interest was not perfected. Generally perfection\ncomes into play to determine priority over conflicting\ninterests in collateral: perfected security interests have\npriority over unperfected security interests, and, as between\nconflicting security interests, the security interest perfected\nfirst has priority over interests perfected later. See U.C.C.\n§ 9-322.\n\n\n\n\n                                 22\n\finterest in favor of interest owners, as secured parties, to\nsecure the obligations of the first purchaser of oil and gas\nproduction, as debtor, to pay the purchase price. . . . (b) The\nsecurity interest provided by this section is perfected\nautomatically without the filing of a financing statement.”);\nKan. Stat. § 84-9-339a(a) (same); Kan. Stat § 84-9-339a(b)\n(“the security interest provided by this section is perfected as\nof the date of recording [the production of that oil]”). But the\nProducers miss that, even if we were to apply Texas or\nKansas law,5 we apply those states’ versions of Article 9, not\njust their nonuniform amendments in isolation. See Tex. Bus.\n& Com. Code § 9.343(p) (“The rights of any person claiming\nunder a security interest or lien created by this section are\ngoverned by the other provisions of [Article 9] except to the\nextent that this section necessarily displaces those\nprovisions.”); Kan. Stat. § 84-9-339a(o) (same).\n\n         Texas and Kansas, along with every other state,\nadopted a key feature of revised U.C.C. Article 9: its uniform\nchoice-of-law provision. So even starting with Texas’s or\nKansas’s U.C.C., we begin with this rule, which states that\n“while a debtor is located in a jurisdiction, the local law of\nthat jurisdiction governs perfection, the effect of perfection or\nnonperfection, and the priority of a security interest in\ncollateral.” U.C.C. § 9-301(1); see Tex. Bus. & Com. Code\n§ 9.301(1) (same); Kan. Stat. § 84-9-301(1) (same); see also\n\n5\n   The Bankruptcy and District Courts applied Delaware’s\nU.C.C. choice-of-law rules because that is the forum state.\nSee, e.g., Robeson Indus. Corp. v. Hartford Accident &\nIndemn. Co., 178 F.3d 160, 164–65 (3d Cir. 1999) (applying\nchoice of law of forum state in resolving adversary\nproceeding based on state-law claim). We need not reach this\nissue for the purposes of this appeal because, regardless of the\nstate, each has the same choice-of-law rule, U.C.C. § 9-301.\n\n\n\n\n                               23\n\fU.C.C. § 9-301 cmt.4 (“[T]he law governing perfection of\nsecurity interests in both tangible and intangible collateral,\nwhether perfected by filing or automatically, is the law of the\njurisdiction of the debtor’s location, as determined under\nSection 9-307.”).\n\n       Here, as noted above, SemGroup is the debtor because\nit purchased the oil on credit subject to the Producers’\nsecurity interests. SemGroup and its affiliates are registered\nin Delaware or Oklahoma. U.C.C. § 9-307(e) (“A registered\norganization that is organized under the law of a State is\nlocated in that State.”). Accordingly, the “local law of\n[Delaware or Oklahoma] governs perfection,” not Texas or\nKansas law. U.C.C. § 9-301(1). Oklahoma and Delaware\nrequire perfection by filing a financing statement. Okla. Stat.\ntit. 12A, § 1-9-310; Del. Code tit. 6, § 9-310. Because it is\nundisputed that the Producers never made such a filing, their\ninterests are unperfected.\n\n       The only potential exception to § 9-301(1)’s debtor-\nlocation rule is for as-extracted collateral. See U.C.C. § 9-\n301(4) (“The local law of the jurisdiction in which the\nwellhead or minehead is located governs perfection, the effect\nof perfection or nonperfection, and the priority of a security\ninterest in as-extracted collateral.”). The Producers’ oil does\nnot qualify for this exception because, for oil to be as-\nextracted collateral, a debtor must have a preexisting interest\nin the oil before it is extracted at the wellhead. See U.C.C.\n§ 9-102(a)(6) (“‘As-extracted collateral’ means (A) oil, gas,\nor other minerals that are subject to a security interest that: (i)\nis created by a debtor having an interest in the minerals\nbefore extraction; and (ii) attaches to the minerals as\nextracted; or (B) accounts arising out of the sale at the\nwellhead or minehead of oil, gas, or other minerals in which\nthe debtor had an interest before extraction.”) (emphases\nadded). Here, SemGroup had no interest in the oil while it\n\n\n\n\n                                24\n\fwas in the ground. Only after the Producers extracted and\nsold it did SemGroup become involved.\n\n       The Producers nonetheless argue that these automatic\nperfection laws “necessarily displace” the choice-of-law rule.\nSee Tex. Bus. & Com. Code § 9.343(p) (“The rights of any\nperson claiming under a security interest or lien created by\nthis section are governed by the other provisions of this\nchapter except to the extent that this section necessarily\ndisplaces those provisions.”) (emphasis added); Kan. Stat.\n§ 84-9-339a(o) (same). But nothing about these automatic\nperfection laws “necessarily displace[s]” the rest of Article 9.\nRather, these local laws apply when the debtor is located in\nTexas or Kansas, or where the debtor is so closely involved at\nthe wellhead that it has some preexisting interest in the oil\nbefore it is extracted from the ground so that the oil\nconstitutes as-extracted collateral. U.C.C. §§ 9-301(1) & (4).\n\n        The Producers further rely on a provision referring to\nsecurity interests created by the government. U.C.C. § 9-\n109(c)(3) (“This article does not apply to the extent that . . . a\nstatute of another State, a foreign country, or a governmental\nunit of another State or a foreign country, other than a statute\ngenerally applicable to security interests, expressly governs\ncreation, perfection, priority, or enforcement of a security\ninterest created by the state, country, or governmental unit.”)\n(emphasis added). An entity of Texas or Kansas government\ndid not create the security interests. Instead, the security\ninterests were created by SemGroup purchasing oil from the\nProducers.\n\n       The Producers also argue that Delaware or Oklahoma\nperfection laws incorporate the automatic-perfection oil lien\nlaws. They rely on an Official Comment to a separate section\nof Article 9 (on buyer defenses) that generally mentions the\nexistence of nonuniform amendments. See U.C.C. § 9-320\n\n\n\n\n                               25\n\fcmt.7 (“Several [states] have adopted special statutes and\nnonuniform amendments to Article 9 to provide special\nprotections to mineral owners.”). This Comment recognizes\nthat certain states might adopt special provisions to protect\nmineral owners; it does not automatically incorporate\nunspecified local laws. Beyond that, a Comment to the\nU.C.C. does not supersede statutory text, and the Comment\nsays nothing about overriding Article 9’s choice-of-law rules.\n\n       All told, the Producers misunderstand the burdens and\nuncertainty their U.C.C. interpretation would create.\nSemGroup resold oil from thousands of producers located in\neight different states. The downstream purchasers, including\nJ. Aron and BP, had no dealings with this diverse group of\nproducers, did not even know who these producers were, and\nwere buying oil in bulk from storage centers, so they did not\nknow which producers’ oil they received. To determine\npossible conflicting security interests, instead of merely\nchecking the filing records of the states of the entities they\npurchase from, downstream purchasers would have to\ndiscover the identities and locations of potentially thousands\nof producers with whom they have no contact.\n\n        Eliminating this type of uncertainty was of\nfoundational importance to the U.C.C.’s simplified notice\nsystem. Prior to the 2001 revisions of the U.C.C., parties\nnormally had to search for financing statements wherever a\ndebtor had collateral to know if anything was encumbered.\nSee U.C.C. § 9-103(b)(1) (1995) (“Except as otherwise\nprovided in this subsection, perfection and the effect of\nperfection or non-perfection of a security interest in collateral\nare governed by the law of the jurisdiction where the\ncollateral is when the last event occurs on which is based the\nassertion that the security interest is perfected or\nunperfected.”). Now the U.C.C. requires that a party check\nfor filings in the debtor’s location and understand that locale’s\n\n\n\n\n                               26\n\fsecured transactions laws. See U.C.C. § 9-101 cmt.4(c)\n(“This Article changes the choice-of-law rule governing\nperfection (i.e., where to file) for most collateral to the law of\nthe jurisdiction where the debtor is located.”). If the oil\nproducers want to encumber the oil they sell to an out-of-state\nfirst purchaser, all they need to do is comply with the rules\nuniformly applicable throughout the country to all sellers of\ngoods—file a financing statement in the state where that first\npurchaser is located.\n\n        In conclusion, under U.C.C. § 9-301(1), Delaware and\nOklahoma law govern perfection. Texas and Kansas’s\nnonuniform amendments to Article 9 do not save the\nProducers. J. Aron and BP thus may qualify as buyers for\nvalue because the security interests the Producers may have\nclaimed were not perfected. See U.C.C. § 9-317(b) (buyer-\nfor-value defense only applies “before [the security interest]\nis perfected”).\n\n       2.      J. Aron and BP purchased the oil from\n               SemGroup.\n\n        The second premise underlying the Producers’ claims\nis that J. Aron and BP did not buy the oil from SemGroup.\nInstead, under the parties’ setoff agreements, J. Aron and BP\nacquired oil as a secured party—they took it as collateral for\nthe options trades—and thus did not give “value” for it. See\nU.C.C. § 9-317(b) (“A buyer, other than a secured party, of\n. . . goods . . . takes free of a security interest . . . if the buyer\ngives value . . . .”).\n\n       The Producers mischaracterize J. Aron and BP’s\nbusiness relationships with SemGroup. J. Aron and BP did\nnot acquire the oil because it was collateral for the options\ntrades; they acquired it on credit per industry custom. These\npurchases on credit—promises to pay—are more than\n\n\n\n\n                                 27\n\fsufficient to satisfy the “value” requirement. See U.C.C. § 1-\n204 (“[A] person gives value for rights if the person acquires\nthem . . . (4) in return for any consideration sufficient to\nsupport a simple contract.”). And not only did J. Aron’s and\nBP’s promises to pay satisfy the value requirement, the\npurchases gave SemGroup a new, valuable asset—accounts\nreceivable, or simply “accounts” for U.C.C. purposes. See\nU.C.C. § 9-102(a)(2) (“‘Account’ . . . means a right to\npayment of a monetary obligation . . . (i) for property that has\nbeen or is to be sold . . . .”). SemGroup’s accounts receivable\nwere in turn used as collateral to secure its obligations to J.\nAron and BP under the options trades.\n\n        To illustrate, when J. Aron and BP purchased oil on\ncredit, SemGroup received IOUs from them. These IOUs\nbecame SemGroup’s accounts. In turn, J. Aron and BP\ncontracted for a setoff right between SemGroup’s accounts\nand any amount SemGroup might owe J. Aron or BP for the\noptions trades. In the event SemGroup ended up owing them\nmoney on the options trades, J. Aron and BP would get their\nIOUs (the accounts) back.\n       Hence these IOUs served as collateral for the options\ntrades, not the oil.6 J. Aron and BP received oil simply\n\n6\n  The accounts receivable created by the oil purchases were\nvaluable to SemGroup, reducing its trading costs and\nincreasing its liquidity. For example, as part of its option\ntrades with J. Aron, SemGroup had to post cash collateral to\nmeet margin requirements based on its exposure to that entity.\nThis relieved SemGroup from posting the required cash\nmargin based on the amount J. Aron owed SemGroup for oil\npurchases. To illustrate, if SemGroup had to post a $50,000\ncash margin, it could substitute that amount with the accounts\nreceivable (meaning J. Aron’s IOUs) worth $50,000. As a\n\n\n\n\n                              28\n\fbecause they purchased it. Thus, because J. Aron and BP\npurchased oil from SemGroup and did not acquire it as\nsecured parties, they meet this requirement of the buyer-for-\nvalue defense. See U.C.C. § 9-317(b) (“A buyer, other than a\nsecured party, of . . . goods . . . .”).\n\n       3.     J. Aron and BP did not have knowledge of\nthe           Producers’ security interests.\n\n       Whether J. Aron and BP bought the oil “without\nknowledge of the security interest” is the only remaining\ndisputed requirement. We agree with the District Court that\nno reasonable factfinder could conclude that they had\n\n\nresult of this arrangement, SemGroup could put its cash to\nother uses.\n\n       The accounts receivable also were valuable for the\nProducers and others that dealt with SemGroup. The\nProducers’ security interests could have extended to\nSemGroup’s accounts receivable created by J. Aron and BP’s\npurchases. See U.C.C. § 9-315(a)(2) (“a security interest\nattaches to any identifiable proceeds of collateral”); U.C.C.\n§ 9-102(a)(64) (defining “proceeds” to include “(A) whatever\nis acquired upon the sale, lease, license, exchange, or other\ndisposition of collateral; (B) whatever is collected on, or\ndistributed on account of, collateral. . . .”). But the Producers\ndo not assert their security interests in SemGroup’s accounts\nreceivable, likely because their interests could have been\nsubordinated to J. Aron and BP’s setoff rights. See U.C.C.\n§ 9-404; see also 504 B.R. at 52. The Producers could have\ncontracted with SemGroup to ensure that these accounts\nwould not be used as collateral for SemGroup’s options\ntrading business, but they did not.\n\n\n\n\n                               29\n\fknowledge of the Producers’ security interests in oil. Despite\nvolumes of discovery, at most the Producers have produced\nindications of constructive knowledge (a reason to know), but\nU.C.C. § 1-202(b) requires “actual knowledge.”\n\n       SemGroup sold oil to J. Aron and BP per the industry\nstandard Conoco General Provisions, which expressly\ndisclaim the existence of any continuing security interest:\n“The Seller warrants good title to all crude oil delivered\nhereunder and warrants that such crude oil shall be free from\nall royalties, liens, encumbrances and all applicable foreign,\nfederal, state and local taxes.” J.A. 2505. Some 15 Producers\neven used this Conoco warranty language in their sales to\nSemGroup, although those Producers now argue that it\napplied only to third-party liens, not the ones created between\na Producer and the purchaser.\n\n       It is also undisputed that the Producers never\ncommunicated with J. Aron and BP about any subject, let\nalone a security interest. Indeed, the Producers never took\nany steps to notify anyone about their purported security\ninterest. And despite massive document discovery and\nnumerous depositions, there is no evidence that anyone at J.\nAron or BP—or anyone else for that matter—knew about the\nclaimed security interests.\n\n       Nonetheless, the Producers contend that we can\nreasonably infer actual knowledge because of testimony that\nJ. Aron or BP (1) were aware of state lien laws, (2) knew of\nthe existence of some of the Producers, (3) knew that\nSemGroup purchased the oil on credit from the Producers,\nand (4) were aware that SemGroup’s credit agreements with\nits lending banks carved out from the lending base those\nassets encumbered by “statutory Liens, if any, created under\nthe laws of [various states].”       J.A. 9488-89.      This\ncircumstantial evidence in no way shows that when\n\n\n\n\n                              30\n\fSemGroup resold the oil and expressly warranted that it was\nnot encumbered by security interests, J. Aron and BP actually\nknew the truth was otherwise. At most, this establishes\nconstructive knowledge—that J. Aron and BP might have a\nreason to believe that some oil was encumbered by a security\ninterest at some time. But constructive knowledge does not\ndefeat the buyer-for-value defense; only “actual knowledge”\ndoes. U.C.C. § 1-202(b).\n\n       Thus J. Aron and BP did not have actual knowledge of\nany security interest in the oil they purchased and meet all\nother requirements of the buyer-for-value defense.\nAccordingly, they took the oil free of the Producers’ liens to\nthe extent they even existed.7\n\n\n7\n  In light of this ruling, we need not reach the District and\nBankruptcy Court’s determination in the alternative that J.\nAron and BP took the oil free of the security interests as\nbuyers in the ordinary course. See U.C.C. § 9-320(a) (“[A]\nbuyer in ordinary course of business . . . takes free of a\nsecurity interest created by the buyer’s seller, even if the\nsecurity interest is perfected and the buyer knows of its\nexistence.”); see also U.C.C. § 1-201(b)(9) (the seller must be\n“in the business of selling goods of that kind”). BP purchased\noil from SemCrude, and it is undisputed that SemCrude was\nin the business of buying and selling oil and that it created the\nsecurity interests when it purchased the oil from the\nProducers on credit.          After the Bankruptcy Court\nrecommended summary judgment, however, the Producers\nbelatedly argued that J. Aron cannot avail itself of this\ndefense because it purchased oil from SemCrude’s parent,\nSemGroup. Because the Bankruptcy and District Courts did\nnot have the full opportunity to reach this issue, it is not clear\n\n\n\n\n                               31\n\fB.     The Fraud Claims\n\n        The Producers’ fraud claims also fail. They do not\nbring claims for fraudulent transfers under the Bankruptcy\nCode. See 11 U.S.C. § 548. Rather, they bring a common\nlaw fraud claim, contending that SemGroup did not intend to\npay for the Producers’ oil, and J. Aron and BP participated in\nthis scheme to defraud.\n\n       The Producers first argue that the District Court erred\nprocedurally by granting summary judgment sua sponte on\nfraud because J. Aron and BP moved for summary judgment\nonly as to the causation element of fraud. Even if this were a\n“sua sponte” grant, the Producers knew they needed to show\nthat their fraud claims should survive summary judgment and\nthe District Court did not abuse its discretion.\n\n       District courts “possess the power to enter summary\njudgments sua sponte, so long as the losing party was on\nnotice that she had to come forward with all of her evidence.”\nAnderson v. Wachovia Mortg. Corp., 621 F.3d 261, 280 (3d\nCir. 2010) (quoting Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317,\n326 (1986)). “Notice” simply requires that “the targeted\nparty ha[ve] reason to believe the court might reach the issue\nand receive[] a fair opportunity to put its best foot forward.’”\nCouden v. Duffy, 446 F.3d 483, 500 (3d Cir. 2006) (citations\nomitted). Even if the “notice” requirement is not met, the\ngrant of summary judgment is only reversible if there is\nprejudice. See id. at 507.\n\n\n\nto us whether SemGroup (the parent) was in the business of\nselling oil or whether it was involved in creating the security\ninterests. Accordingly, out of an abundance of caution, we do\nnot reach this issue.\n\n\n\n\n                              32\n\f        Here, the Producers had the full opportunity to oppose\nsummary judgment. The Bankruptcy Court, at the Producers’\nrequest, continued J. Aron and BP’s initial motions for\nsummary judgment and gave the Producers an additional\nyear of discovery. Because there is no direct evidence of\nfraud, the Producers base their entire fraud claim on\nSemGroup’s business structure and its transactions with J.\nAron and BP. Yet all of this was the subject of discovery.\nThe Producers addressed the fraud claims in oral argument\nbefore the Bankruptcy Court, and they have conducted\nnumerous depositions and compiled documentary evidence\nthat they now rely on in their effort to show fraud.\n\n        Moreover, even if we were to conclude there was\ninsufficient notice or opportunity to develop the record, the\nProducers still have not shown prejudice. They argue that\nthey would have introduced expert affidavits “had they been\ngiven proper notice that J. Aron/BP were moving for\nsummary judgment on all elements of all fraud claims.”\nAssociated Producers Br. 51. These experts merely ask us to\ninfer fraud because J. Aron and BP knew SemGroup’s trading\nstrategy was risky yet continued to trade options. But these\nreports would not have defeated summary judgment.\n\n        J. Aron and BP never communicated with the\nProducers, so naturally they did not make any false\nstatements to them. As noted already, J. Aron and BP did not\neven know the identities of the thousands of producers that\nsold SemGroup the oil. SemGroup, until the bankruptcy\nfiling, always paid the Producers in full for the oil, and J.\nAron and BP also always paid in full for the oil they\npurchased.\n\n      Despite the lack of evidence that anyone did not intend\nto pay for the oil, the Producers contend that SemGroup\npurchased the oil without intending to pay for it and J. Aron\n\n\n\n\n                             33\n\fand BP aided and abetted this fraudulent scheme. But we fail\nto find one item of evidence indicating that SemGroup ever\nintended to avoid paying for oil.\n\n        The Producers never identify a time at which\nSemGroup started buying oil without an intent to pay or with\na reckless disregard for its ability to do so. The only evidence\nof SemGroup’s fraud comes from the Bankruptcy Examiner’s\nreport, but it has nothing to do with SemGroup’s oil\npurchases.       Instead, it addresses certain SemGroup\nexecutives’ misconduct, which formed the basis of a\nshareholder lawsuit. See In re SemCrude L.P., 796 F.3d 310\n(3d Cir. 2015). And, if anything, the findings of the\nExaminer cut against fraud, as he concluded that SemGroup\nbecame insolvent because it kept losing on its options trades\nand that “[l]ast minute attempts by it to increase its credit\nfacility failed.” J.A. 869. If SemGroup had successfully\nincreased its credit facility and avoided bankruptcy, all\nevidence suggests that it would have paid the Producers.\n\n        Even if we were to assume, for the sake of argument,\nthat this evidence demonstrated that SemGroup defrauded the\nProducers, the evidence that J. Aron and BP conspired with\nSemGroup or aided and abetted this fraudulent scheme is still\nnonexistent. A civil conspiracy requires a shared intent to\ncommit fraud—a “meeting of the minds.” See State ex rel.\nMays v. Ridenhour, 811 P.2d 1220, 1226 (Kan. 1991); Cotten\nv. Weatherford Bancshares, Inc., 187 S.W.3d 687, 701 (Tex.\nApp. 2006); Brock v. Thompson, 948 P.2d 279, 294 (Okla.\n1997), as corrected (Apr. 3, 1998). Aiding and abetting\nrequires, in addition to substantial assistance or participation,\nknowledge of the fraud. See Mays, 811 P.2d at 1232; Cotten,\n187 S.W.3d at 701; Cooper v. Bondoni, 841 P.2d 608, 612\n(Okla. Civ. App. 1992).\n\n\n\n\n                               34\n\f       There simply is no evidence that either J. Aron or BP\nknew it was taking oil that had not been paid for. Their mere\nknowledge that SemGroup purchased oil on credit, as was\nindustry custom, does not suggest that they knew that any\nunidentified producers were still owed money or that\nSemGroup did not intend to pay for the oil when payment\nwas due. Again, J. Aron and BP were purchasing oil at large\naggregation centers where oil mixed with the same\ncommodity from myriad other producers in various states. J.\nAron and BP did not know that any of the millions of barrels\nof oil they purchased—to the extent it actually was the\nProducers’ oil (a point J. Aron and BP vigorously dispute)—\nhad not been paid for on the agreed payment date or that\nSemGroup did not intend to pay for it. At most the\npurchases-on-credit arrangement that is industry custom\nallows for a reasonable inference that, when J. Aron and BP\ntransacted with SemGroup, they may have known that\nSemGroup might still have owed the Producers. However, no\nevidence leads to a reasonable inference that J. Aron and BP\nknew SemGroup intended to avoid paying for this oil or was\nreckless with its ability to pay for the oil.\n\n       The Producers also attempt to infer fraud from the\noptions trades. They contend that J. Aron and BP knew that\nSemGroup’s trading was speculative and not legitimate\nhedging, and thus, “[d]espite numerous concerns and red\nflags, no one from J. Aron or BP took reasonable steps to\nverify that this was a legitimate trading or hedging strategy,”\nall the while continuing to do business with SemGroup.\nAssociated Producers Br. 56. This lawful activity simply\ndoes not permit an inference of fraud.\n\n       J. Aron and BP paid millions in premiums up front for\noptions to secure a price for oil, protecting themselves against\nan oil-price increase. SemGroup bet the opposite—that oil\nprices would drop. The prices kept rising, so SemGroup lost.\n\n\n\n\n                              35\n\fWhile this was a risky strategy that did not pay off, and in\nhindsight hedging might have served SemGroup better, this\nbusiness arrangement does not demonstrate that J. Aron and\nBP intended to take the oil away from the Producers without\npayment.\n\nC.     The Oklahoma Production Revenue Standards Act\n       Claims\n\n        The Oklahoma Producers separately argue that the\nOklahoma Production Revenue Standards Act (the “PRSA”),\nOkla. Stat. tit. 52, §§ 570.1 et seq., creates an implied trust in\ntheir favor that, absent full payment, travels perpetually down\nthe stream of commerce; in other words, so long as those\nProducers have not been paid, whoever possesses the oil does\nso for their benefit.8 In addition, the argument goes, so long\nas an Oklahoma Producer has not been paid, whoever owns\nthe proceeds of the oil needs to account for those proceeds to\nthat Producer. Thus, even though downstream purchasers\n(like J. Aron) generally do not know the oil producers who\nsold the oil to the midstream purchasers, they allegedly have\nlegal obligations to each Oklahoma Producer. Based on these\ntrust duties, that Producer may bring claims against J. Aron\nfor conversion, unjust enrichment, constructive fraud, and\ndeclaratory relief.\n\n       Fortunately for J. Aron and anyone who has\nunwittingly filled a gas tank with Oklahoma-produced oil,\n\n8\n  There is a sound argument that the Oklahoma Producers\nwaived their PRSA trust arguments by expressly disclaiming\nthem in the District Court. Nevertheless, in light of the\nimportance of the legal questions at stake, we exercise our\ndiscretion to consider the issue despite the waiver. Issa v.\nSch. Dist. of Lancaster, 847 F.3d 121, 139 n.8 (3d Cir. 2017).\n\n\n\n\n                               36\n\fthis interpretation simply fails the text of the statute. First,\nwhatever duties the PRSA creates, they do not apply to\ndownstream purchasers like J. Aron. The PRSA regulates the\nrelationships of the many parties at the wellhead, which\ninclude the various interest owners and the operators of those\nwells. Those interests are highly fractionalized and multiple\npersons may have a right to revenue from any well. See Okla.\nStat. tit. 52, § 570.2 (defining an “owner[’s]” interest,\n“proportionate production interest,” “royalty interest,” and\n“subsequently created interest”). The Oklahoma Producers\nthemselves might owe many obligations to the various\ninterest owners of their production. As there are numerous\nparties involved at the wellhead, the PRSA regulates all\nmanner of these parties’ relationship, for example, dictating\nspecific procedures for how proceeds of production are\nshared among interest owners and operators, id. § 570.4, the\nprocess for “[d]esignation of person[s] for certain royalt[ies],\naccounting and remittance functions,” id. § 570.5, detailed\nreporting requirements for all those involved at the wellhead,\nid. 570.8, and the “[i]nformation to be included with\npayments to [the] interest owner,” including how many\ndecimals revenue should be calculated and the measurements\nto describe gas volume. Id. § 570.12.\n        The PRSA, however, has no provisions relating to\ndownstream purchasers. Those purchasers could be located\nout of state, and, as in the case of J. Aron, could be so far\nremoved from the wellhead they do not even know the\nidentities of the producers or the interest owners those\nproducers represent. See Okla. Stat. tit. 52, § 570.2(1)\n(“‘Owner’ means a person or governmental entity with a legal\ninterest in the mineral acreage under a well which entitles that\nperson or entity to oil or gas production or the proceeds or\nrevenues therefrom.”). The statute simply does not govern\nthe relationship of persons who later, down the line of\ncommerce, repurchase this oil.\n\n\n\n\n                              37\n\f       Second, while the PRSA contains some language\nsuggesting a trust-like relationship, there is no language\nstating that it creates an implied trust that travels perpetually\ndown the stream of commerce. PRSA § 570.10(a) states:\n\n       All proceeds from the sale of production shall\n       be regarded as separate and distinct from all\n       other funds of any person receiving or holding\n       the same until such time as such proceeds are\n       paid to the owners legally entitled thereto. Any\n       person holding revenue or proceeds from the\n       sale of production shall hold such revenue or\n       proceeds for the benefit of the owners legally\n       entitled thereto. Nothing in this subsection shall\n       create an express trust.\n\nOkla. Stat. tit. 52, § 570.10(a).\n\n        The Oklahoma Producers rely on a 2008 Oklahoma\nAttorney General Opinion that concluded the language\n“owners legally entitled” to proceeds of the oil actually meant\n“implied beneficiaries,” and therefore “[t]he holder of the\nrevenue or proceeds of oil and gas production acquires no\nright, title or interest in such revenue or proceeds.” 2008 OK\nAG 31 ¶ 22 (citations omitted). The Bankruptcy Court\nrejected the Attorney General’s interpretation, and so have an\nOklahoma intermediate appellate court and District Courts in\nOklahoma. See In re SemCrude, L.P., et al., 407 B.R. 140,\n155 (Bankr. D. Del. 2009); Gaskins v. Texon, LP, 321 P.3d\n985, 989 (Okla. Civ. App. 2014); Naylor Farms, Inc. v.\nAnadarko OGC Co., 2011 WL 7267853, at *1 (W.D. Okla.\nJune 23, 2011); McKnight v. Linn Operating, Inc., No. CIV-\n10-30-R, 2010 WL 9039794, at *3 (W.D. Okla. Apr. 1,\n2010). We agree.\n\n\n\n\n                                38\n\f        Although the PRSA’s language—that sale proceeds\n“shall be regarded as separate and distinct” and shall be held\nfor the benefit of the owners “legally entitled thereto”—\nechoes trust language, these words cannot be stretched to\ncreate automatically an implied trust. First, it is a conceptual\nleap to take the language “paid to the owners legally entitled\nthereto” to mean that interest owners and producers\nautomatically possess the “legal entitlement” of ownership of\na beneficial interest in the proceeds, and that whoever\nactually holds the proceeds has no title to them. As the\nBankruptcy Court noted, in the few instances where\nOklahoma statutes have been construed to create an implied\ntrust, those statutes imposed many more trust duties. See 407\nB.R. at 152 (“[Those other statutes] demonstrated the\nrequisite clear intent to form a trust because the State of\nOklahoma (or an organ thereof) is the trustee, holding\nidentified funds, for the benefit of identified beneficiaries. In\nsharp contrast, the PRSA does not identify a specific trustee,\nactually require segregation of a trust res or otherwise impose\nrights and        duties    typically associated with a\ntrustee/beneficiary relationship.”).\n\n        Second, a more faithful interpretation of the PRSA is\nthat it provides for the imposition of a trust only in limited\nways. As the concluding sentence of PRSA § 570.10(a)\nstates, “Nothing in this subsection shall create an express\ntrust.” In contrast to an express trust, implied trusts arise in\nOklahoma where it would be inequitable for one party to keep\ntitle to property. There are two types of implied trusts—\nresulting or constructive. A resulting trust may be judicially\nimposed “where the circumstances indicate that the grantor of\nlegal title to property did not intend for the beneficial interest\nto be enjoyed by the grantee of the legal title.” Gaskins, 321\nP.3d at 989 n.5 (citation omitted). A constructive trust may\nbe imposed “when an individual obtains a legal right to\nproperty through fraudulent, abusive means, or through a\n\n\n\n\n                               39\n\fmethod which violates equity and good conscience.” Id.\n(citation omitted). In either case, equity or good conscience\ncould require imposing trustee burdens on a party who\nviolated a duty owed to another under the PRSA. However,\nthe Oklahoma Producers do not argue that equity demands\nimposition of a trust, but only rely on the Attorney General’s\ninterpretation that the PRSA automatically implies a trust.\n\n        Finally, the Oklahoma Producers argue that the\nlegislature “restated” that the PRSA created trust rights when\nit passed the 2010 Oklahoma Lien Act. This new Act created\nautomatic oil liens in favor of producers that are outside the\nscope of the U.C.C. See Sahar Jooshani, There’s A New Act\nin Town: How the Oklahoma Oil and Gas Owners’ Lien Act\nof 2010 Strengthens the Position of Oklahoma Interest\nOwners, 65 Okla. L. Rev. 133 (2012); Alvin C. Harrell and\nFrederick H. Miller, Aftermath of the SemGroup Case:\nOklahoma Enacts the Oil and Gas Owners’ Lien Act of\n2010, 81 Okla. Bar Assoc. J. 2818 (2010).\n\n         The 2010 Lien Act does not apply to our appeal\nbecause it post-dated SemGroup’s bankruptcy. Yet the\nOklahoma Producers point to it as evidence that the\nOklahoma Legislature believed the PRSA created\nautomatically an implied trust. The Lien Act includes buyer\ndefenses for the liens it creates, which also apply to PRSA\n§ 570.10(a): if the downstream purchasers were buyers in the\nordinary course or had paid all consideration due, they take\nfree of “any obligations created by [the PRSA].” Okla. Stat.\ntit. 52, § 549.6. The logic is that if the Oklahoma Legislature\ndid not believe that the PRSA creates trust rights, the 2010\nLien Act would not have included buyer defenses to the\nPRSA. However, our take is that to the extent an implied\ntrust could be imposed under PRSA § 570.10(a), all the\nOklahoma Legislature made clear was that downstream\npurchasers could avail themselves of buyer defenses.\n\n\n\n\n                              40\n\f       In summary, the PRSA did not create an implied trust\nhere and did not impose any duties on J. Aron. As all the\nOklahoma Producers’ theories of relief were predicated on\nthis construal of the Act, the District Court correctly entered\nsummary judgment against the Oklahoma Producers.\n\n                 *      *      *       *      *\n\n        Texas, Kansas, and Oklahoma all include statutes that\nprovide some protections for those who produce oil in their\nStates, but those protections do not reach downstream parties\nlike J. Aron and BP. The Producers theoretically could have\nperfected their security interests, traced those interests in the\noil that extended to their accounts receivable, and forbade\nSemGroup from using those accounts as margin collateral for\ntheir options trades.\n\n       But why didn’t the Producers take such precautions?\nThey contend they are a loose collection of relatively\nunsophisticated parties. However, these parties pool their\ninterests and choose operators to extract and sell their oil; it\ndoes not seem farfetched that they could also choose a\nrepresentative to file financing statements to perfect security\ninterests or take other measures to protect against an oil\npurchaser’s insolvency. The more likely explanation is that\nno midstream or downstream oil purchaser would buy oil\nfrom the Producers if they sought to encumber that oil as it\nflowed through interstate commerce and changed hands.\n\n       The oil industry operates through sales on credit. It\ninvolves thousands of producers and those producers\nrepresent countless interest owners who have fractionalized\ninterests at the well. Downstream purchasers have no contact\nwith these producers and do not even know who they are.\nThis oil is pooled with myriad other producers’ oil and is\nresold many times before consumers get it at the retail pump.\n\n\n\n\n                               41\n\fThe industry thus uses the Conoco warranty that this oil is\nsold free and clear of any liens because it is a hard-to-trace,\nliquid asset that flows throughout the country.\n\n       In sum, if any producer of oil tries to sell it subject to a\nsecurity interest or implied trust that flows endlessly down the\nstream of commerce, it will be unsold. The Producers’\ncontention that a lien or trust follows oil from their wells to\nthe gas pump does not make sense for this type of market.\nThe effect of any opinion from us upholding the Producers’\npositions would be chaos. We thus affirm the superbly\nreasoned rulings of both the Bankruptcy and District Courts.\n\n\n\n\n                                42\n\f",

SemGroup sold oil to and\ntraded oil futures with Appellees, downstream oil purchasers.\nThe producers took no actions to protect themselves in case\n\n\n\n\n                              10\n\fof SemGroup’s insolvency. The downstream purchasers did;\nin the case of default, they could set off the amount they owed\nSemGroup for oil by the amount SemGroup would owe them\nfor the value of the outstanding futures trades. Accordingly,\nwhen SemGroup filed for bankruptcy, the downstream\npurchasers were paid in full while the oil producers were paid\nonly in part.\n\n       Because the oil producers did not take precautionary\nmeasures to ensure payment in case of SemGroup’s\ninsolvency, all they have to rely on are local laws they\ncontend give them automatically perfected security interests\nor trust rights in the oil that ended up in the hands of the\ndownstream purchasers. But the parties who took precautions\nagainst insolvency do not act as insurers to those who took\nnone. Accordingly, we affirm the grant of summary\njudgment in the downstream purchasers’ favor.\n\n                    I.     BACKGROUND\n\nSemGroup’s Two Businesses\n\n       SemGroup L.P. and its subsidiaries (jointly and\nseverally referred to as “SemGroup”) provided “midstream”\noil services. It purchased oil from producers and resold it to\ndownstream purchasers. It also traded financial options\ncontracts for the right to buy or sell oil at a fixed price on a\nfuture date. At the end of the fiscal year preceding\nbankruptcy, SemGroup’s revenues were $13.2 billion.\n\n       Two of SemGroup’s operating companies, SemCrude,\nL.P. and Eaglwing, L.P., purchased oil from thousands of\nwells in several states and from thousands of oil producers,\nincluding from Appellants, producers located in Texas,\nKansas, and Oklahoma. The producers act on behalf of many\nparties who have interests in the oil at the wellhead. These\n\n\n\n\n                              11\n\finterest owners include the person or entity who owns the\nland in fee simple, and thus owns the rights to the minerals.\nThat person or entity transfers the mineral rights to an oil\ncompany through a lease. The company holds the “working\ninterest”—the right to drill and sell the oil from the leased\nland. The working-interest owners appoint an operator to\nwork the well. Most of the producers in this appeal are\nowners of working interests or operators.\n\n      After purchase, SemGroup moved the oil via trucks\nand pipelines and stored it in major aggregation centers in\nOklahoma, Kansas, and elsewhere. Per industry custom,\nSemGroup purchased the oil on credit, paying for it on the\n20th day of the month following the sale. For example, oil\npurchased in January would be paid for on February 20.\n\n       SemGroup always paid the producers for the oil in full\nuntil the bankruptcy filing. It then resold the product to\ndownstream purchasers, including to Appellees, J. Aron &\nCompany and BP Oil Supply Co., both large oil distributors.\nSemGroup expressly warranted to the downstream purchasers\nthat it sold them oil “free from all royalties, liens, and\nencumbrances.” See, e.g., Conoco General Provisions § B,\nJ.A. 2505. Again, per industry custom the downstream\npurchasers bought the oil on credit, with payment due the\n20th of the following month. J. Aron and BP had no\ncommunication with the thousands of oil producers from\nwhom SemGroup purchased the oil and only knew of the\nexistence of some of the larger producers. J. Aron and BP\ndispute whether they even purchased any of Appellants’ oil\nand contend that Appellants cannot trace the oil they sold, as\nit was mixed with millions of barrels of oil from innumerable\nother producers.\n\n       Until the bankruptcy filing, J. Aron and BP paid in full\nfor the oil they bought. BP also sold oil to SemGroup, so\n\n\n\n\n                              12\n\fwhen payment was due they would net out their obligations—\ni.e., if BP bought $10 million from SemGroup and SemGroup\nbought $8 million from BP, then BP would just pay $2\nmillion to SemGroup.\n\n        In addition to midstream oil services, SemGroup also\ntraded oil futures with J. Aron and BP. This trading strategy\nlead to SemGroup’s insolvency. Essentially SemGroup bet\nthat the price of oil would drop, while J. Aron and BP wanted\nto secure a low price of oil in the event that prices would rise.\nSemGroup would win the bet if the oil price dropped while J.\nAron and BP would win if the price rose. The (simplified)\nmechanics are as follows.\n\n        SemGroup sold what are known as call options. In\nexchange for an upfront premium, the purchaser of the call\noption received the right to purchase oil at a specified price\nand date. To illustrate, if in December J. Aron purchased the\nright to buy 10,000 barrels of oil at $50 a barrel on March 1,\nbut the market price that date was $45 a barrel, that option\nwas worthless because J. Aron could buy oil at a cheaper\nprice on the market; the $50 buying right did not save J. Aron\nmoney. SemGroup therefore would make money: it received\nthe upfront premium J. Aron paid for the option, but did not\nend up losing the bet because it would not have to sell oil at\nless than market price. Conversely, if the market price on\nMarch 1 was $55 a barrel, J. Aron would be “in the\nmoney”—SemGroup would have to sell J. Aron 10,000\nbarrels of oil at $50 a barrel, $5 below the market rate.\nSemGroup thus would lose $50,000 dollars on the option\nbecause, if J. Aron did not have the buying right, SemGroup\ncould have sold that oil on the market for the going price of\n$55. These options did not “physically settle.” That is,\nSemGroup would not actually sell these oil barrels; it would\njust owe J. Aron $50,000.\n\n\n\n\n                               13\n\f        SemGroup’s gambling strategy was in stark contrast\nwith hedging oil prices. To hedge a drop in the price of oil,\nSemGroup could have acquired put options—the right to sell\noil at a specified price. This would protect them against price\ndrops while still allowing them to take advantage of selling at\nhigh oil prices.\n\n        As it turns out, SemGroup was a bad gambler. Oil\nprices rose throughout 2007 and 2008. Its CEO believed that\neventually oil prices would drop. So each time SemGroup\nlost money on these options, rather than realize the financial\nloss, it would sell more options to cover the loss. This is\nreferred to as “rolling” in the industry, and is essentially\ndoubling down on a lost bet. For example, if SemGroup lost\n$1 million on the March 1 trade, it would resell new options\nand collect $1 million in new premiums, thus betting that the\nprice of oil would drop on a date in the future. SemGroup\nthought that, if it kept “rolling” these options, eventually the\nprice of oil would drop and all the options would be\nworthless. If that happened, SemGroup would have acquired\nall of these upfront premium payments at no cost. This\ndoubling-down strategy had a downside, however. Rolling\noptions greatly increased SemGroup’s exposure to future\nlosses. By July 2008 it was exposed to a potential $2.8\nbillion loss if the option bets did not pay off.\n\nLiquidity Problems, Setoff Rights, and the Bankruptcy\nFiling\n\n       SemGroup had to pledge cash collateral to margin\naccounts to cover its exposure on the options. The cash in\nthese margin accounts assured the trading counterparties that\nSemGroup could pay for any loss on the options. The margin\nexposure was calculated by the “mark to market” method—\nthe amount SemGroup would owe the counterparty if the\noption liquidated that day. As SemGroup’s exposure on these\n\n\n\n\n                              14\n\foptions increased, so did its margin requirements. Eventually\nit ran out of funds to meet those margin obligations, causing\nits bankruptcy.\n\n       Before the bankruptcy, J. Aron and BP started buying\noil from, and trading options with, SemGroup. In November\n2007, J. Aron entered into a master agreement governing its\nrelationship with SemGroup, and in April 2008 BP entered\ninto a similar arrangement. Under the agreements, in the\nevent of SemGroup’s default J. Aron and BP could set off any\noutstanding amount due for oil purchases with the amount\nowed on options trades. Until SemGroup’s default, J. Aron\nand BP always paid in full for their oil purchases and never\nexercised a setoff right.\n\n        Through the late spring and early summer 2008, oil\nprices kept rising and SemGroup continued losing on its\ntrades. It failed to receive additional financing to meet its\never-increasing margin obligations. On July 17, 2008, as set\nout in their agreement, J. Aron asked SemGroup for adequate\nassurance of performance and that SemGroup meet certain\ncredit-support thresholds. When SemGroup did not respond,\nJ. Aron called a default. The parties thus set off the\noutstanding amounts due. J. Aron owed to SemGroup $435\nmillion in oil purchases, and SemGroup owed to J. Aron $345\nmillion in outstanding options trades. Accordingly, J. Aron\nowed $90 million, the net amount after the oil and options\nwere set off.\n\n     On July 22, 2008, soon after J. Aron called the default,\nSemGroup filed for bankruptcy. This triggered a default as to\nBP, so it also set off the prepetition amount it owed\n\n\n\n\n                             15\n\fSemGroup for oil less the amount SemGroup owed it for the\noptions trades. Consequently, BP owed $10 million.1\n\nBankruptcy Proceedings\n\n        Following its Chapter 11 filing, more than a thousand\noil producers were unpaid. Oil producers, purchasers, and\nSemGroup’s lending banks inundated the Bankruptcy Court\nwith adversary proceedings and motions to distribute\nSemGroup’s assets.        The Court established omnibus\nprocedures to determine the producers’ rights and priorities\nversus the banks, with a single adversary proceeding for each\nstate where the producers sold product. The relative priority\nof the producers and downstream purchasers was preserved\nfor later rulings.\n\n       In those rulings, the Bankruptcy Court first held that\nthe lending banks’ security interests in SemGroup’s assets\ntook priority over any purported lien or trust rights granted\nunder state law. It certified appeals directly to our Court as\nmatters of first impression, 28 U.S.C. § 158(d)(2), but the\nproducers and lending banks settled while the appeals were\npending. By stipulation, the producers reserved their right to\npursue their claims against the downstream purchasers and to\nappeal these rulings in the future.\n\n       Meanwhile, J. Aron and BP filed separate adversary\nproceedings where they sought to tender the amount they\nowed to the bankruptcy estate in exchange for a release from\nall liability. The producers also filed nearly 30 separate\nlawsuits against J. Aron and BP in state and federal courts.\nThese suits were transferred to the Bankruptcy Court for\n\n1\n  There is no contention before us that the Bankruptcy Code\nprohibited these setoffs. See generally 11 U.S.C. §§ 362(b)\nand 553.\n\n\n\n\n                             16\n\fresolution.     In September 2009, it confirmed the\nreorganization plan by which J. Aron and BP’s tendered\nfunds were turned over to the producers for full payment of\noil delivered between July 2 and July 21, 2008.2 The\ntendered funds also paid off 12.9% of the amount owed for\noil sold from June 1 to July 1, 2008.\n\n       After a discovery process involving more than 100\nparties, over 150 depositions, and millions of pages of\ndocuments, J. Aron and BP moved for summary judgment\nagainst the Appellant-Producers (hereafter, the “Producers”).\nThe Bankruptcy Court filed proposed findings of facts and\nconclusions of law recommending summary judgment in\nfavor of J. Aron and BP. It concluded in exceptional depth\nand easily understood language that there was no evidence of\nfraud and that J. Aron and BP purchased the oil from\nSemGroup free of any purported security interest either as (1)\nbuyers for value, or (2) as buyers in the ordinary course.

July 30, 2015).\n\nSummary of Claims on Appeal\n\n      The Producers’ claims do not rely on bankruptcy law.\nThey are based on state statutes and common law fraud. The\n\n2\n   This followed from 11 U.S.C. § 503(b)(9), whereby an\nallowable administrative expense includes “the value of any\ngoods received by the debtor within 20 days before the date\nof commencement of a case under this title in which the\ngoods have been sold to the debtor in the ordinary course of\nsuch debtor’s business.”\n\n\n\n\n                              17\n\fTexas and Kansas Producers argue that, under their states’\nnonuniform amendments to the Uniform Commercial Code,\nthey had perfected security interests in the oil they sold to\nSemGroup and J. Aron and BP took the oil subject to these\ninterests. The Oklahoma Producers bring separate claims\nderived from an Oklahoma statute they contend imposes an\nimplied trust for their benefit. They also claim to have an\nequitable interest in the oil proceeds J. Aron and BP took to\nset off the options debt.\n\n                    II.    JURISDICTION\n\n        We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291 to review\nthe District Court’s grant of summary judgment. Yet the\nProducers argue that the District Court lacked subject matter\njurisdiction even though the confirmed Chapter 11 plan\nexpressly provided for jurisdiction over this controversy.\n\n        The Bankruptcy Court determined that the proceeding\nbefore it was non-core,3 but both it and the District Court\nexercised jurisdiction because that proceeding was “related\nto” SemGroup’s bankruptcy case.

R. Civ. P. 56.\n\n                       IV.     ANALYSIS\n\n        As noted, the Texas and Kansas Producers rely on\ntheir states’ nonuniform amendments to the Uniform\nCommercial Code, which they argue give them automatically\nperfected security interests in the oil they sold to SemGroup\nthat J. Aron and BP ultimately received. We first conclude\nthat the Producers do not have a perfected security interest\neven if Texas or Kansas law applied. Accordingly, J. Aron\nand BP purchased the oil from SemGroup free of any lien as\nbuyers for value. U.C.C. § 9-317(b).\n\n       Next, we turn to these Producers’ fraud claim and\nagree with the Bankruptcy and District Courts that there is no\nevidence of fraud. J. Aron and BP took precautions to protect\nthemselves in case SemGroup became insolvent, but they did\nnot defraud SemGroup’s other creditors.\n\n        To conclude, we address the Oklahoma Producers’\nclaims based on an Oklahoma statute they contend imposes a\ntrust relationship between them and anyone who purchases\ntheir oil. That interpretation lacks logic and is not supported\nby the statute’s text.\n\nA.     The U.C.C. Claim\n\n        Because we must parse uniform and state-specific\nversions of U.C.C. Article 9 (the Article on security interests),\nit is helpful to explain briefly a few fundamental concepts. A\nsecurity interest is “an interest in personal property or fixtures\nwhich secures payment or performance of an obligation.”\n\n\n\n\n                               20\n\fU.C.C. § 1-201(b)(35). In other words, it is a lien on a piece\nof property that secures payment of a debt. If the debt is not\npaid, the person who holds the security interest can repossess\nthat property—i.e., take it in satisfaction of the debt. The\nperson who owns that security interest is called the “secured\nparty.” U.C.C. § 9-102(a)(73) (“‘Secured party’ means: (A)\na person in whose favor a security interest is created or\nprovided for under a security agreement, whether or not any\nobligation to be secured is outstanding.”). The property\nsubject to the security interest is called “collateral.” U.C.C.\n§ 9-102(a)(12). And a “debtor” is the person with an\nownership interest in that collateral. U.C.C. § 9-102(a)(28)\n(“‘Debtor’ means: (A) a person having an interest, other than\na security interest or other lien, in the collateral, whether or\nnot the person is an obligor. . . .”) (emphasis added).\n\n        The Producers contend that they sold the oil to\nSemGroup on credit subject to a security interest—that is,\nthey retained a lien in the oil as long as SemGroup had not\npaid them for that oil, and if SemGroup did not pay for the oil\nthe Producers could hypothetically repossess it. The oil they\nsold here is the “collateral,” and SemGroup, who purchased\nthe oil, is the “debtor.” The Producers further assert that their\nsecurity interests continued in the oil even after SemGroup\nresold it to J. Aron and BP. See U.C.C. § 9-315(a)(1) (“a\nsecurity interest or agricultural lien continues in collateral\nnotwithstanding sale”). Thus, J. Aron and BP received the oil\nsubject to the security interest, and, because SemGroup did\nnot pay the Producers in full, the Producers had the right to\nreclaim the oil from J. Aron and BP. Accordingly, J. Aron\nand BP would have to return to the Producers the value of the\noil used to set off options debt with SemGroup.\n\n       J. Aron and BP, however, contend that they took the\noil as buyers for value and thus free of any security interest.\nSee U.C.C. § 9-317(b) (“[A] buyer, other than a secured\n\n\n\n\n                               21\n\fparty, of . . . goods . . . takes free of a security interest . . . if\nthe buyer gives value and receives delivery of the collateral\nwithout knowledge of the security interest . . . and before it is\nperfected.”). This defense is simple: if a security interest is\nnot perfected,4 a buyer takes the property free of that security\ninterest unless the buyer actually knew of the security\ninterest. As discussed below, we conclude that J. Aron and\nBP qualify as buyers for value. To do so, we address whether\n(1) the security interests were perfected, (2) J. Aron and BP\nactually bought the oil or acquired it as secured parties, and\n(3) they knew the Producers’ security interests even existed.\n\n       1.      Security interests were not perfected.\n\n       To perfect a security interest, in most instances a party\nmust file a financing statement in the appropriate state office.\nSee U.C.C. § 9-310(a) (“[A] financing statement must be filed\nto perfect all security interests.”). Here, the Texas and\nKansas Producers did not file a financing statement or take\nany other steps to perfect their security interests. Instead,\nthey urge us to apply their states’ versions of the U.C.C.\nbecause they contain nonuniform amendments that the\nProducers argue give oil producers an automatically perfected\nsecurity interest in the oil they produced. See Tex. Bus. &\nCom. Code § 9.343 (“(a) This section provides a security\n\n4\n   The holder of a “perfected” security interest has much\nstronger recourse to enforce that interest against third parties\nthan if the interest was not perfected. Generally perfection\ncomes into play to determine priority over conflicting\ninterests in collateral: perfected security interests have\npriority over unperfected security interests, and, as between\nconflicting security interests, the security interest perfected\nfirst has priority over interests perfected later. See U.C.C.\n§ 9-322.\n\n\n\n\n                                 22\n\finterest in favor of interest owners, as secured parties, to\nsecure the obligations of the first purchaser of oil and gas\nproduction, as debtor, to pay the purchase price. . . . (b) The\nsecurity interest provided by this section is perfected\nautomatically without the filing of a financing statement.”);\nKan. Stat. § 84-9-339a(a) (same); Kan. Stat § 84-9-339a(b)\n(“the security interest provided by this section is perfected as\nof the date of recording [the production of that oil]”). But the\nProducers miss that, even if we were to apply Texas or\nKansas law,5 we apply those states’ versions of Article 9, not\njust their nonuniform amendments in isolation. See Tex. Bus.\n& Com. Code § 9.343(p) (“The rights of any person claiming\nunder a security interest or lien created by this section are\ngoverned by the other provisions of [Article 9] except to the\nextent that this section necessarily displaces those\nprovisions.”); Kan. Stat. § 84-9-339a(o) (same).\n\n         Texas and Kansas, along with every other state,\nadopted a key feature of revised U.C.C. Article 9: its uniform\nchoice-of-law provision. So even starting with Texas’s or\nKansas’s U.C.C., we begin with this rule, which states that\n“while a debtor is located in a jurisdiction, the local law of\nthat jurisdiction governs perfection, the effect of perfection or\nnonperfection, and the priority of a security interest in\ncollateral.” U.C.C. § 9-301(1); see Tex. Bus. & Com. Code\n§ 9.301(1) (same); Kan. Stat. § 84-9-301(1) (same); see also\n\n5\n   The Bankruptcy and District Courts applied Delaware’s\nU.C.C. choice-of-law rules because that is the forum state.\nSee, e.g., Robeson Indus. Corp. v. Hartford Accident &\nIndemn. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"764376\"><a href=\"/opinion/764376/robeson-industries-corp-v-hartford-accident-indemnity-company-zurich/\"><span class=\"volume\">178</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">160</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 164–65 (3d Cir. 1999) (applying\nchoice of law of forum state in resolving adversary\nproceeding based on state-law claim). We need not reach this\nissue for the purposes of this appeal because, regardless of the\nstate, each has the same choice-of-law rule, U.C.C. § 9-301.\n\n\n\n\n                               23\n\fU.C.C. § 9-301 cmt.4 (“[T]he law governing perfection of\nsecurity interests in both tangible and intangible collateral,\nwhether perfected by filing or automatically, is the law of the\njurisdiction of the debtor’s location, as determined under\nSection 9-307.”).\n\n       Here, as noted above, SemGroup is the debtor because\nit purchased the oil on credit subject to the Producers’\nsecurity interests. SemGroup and its affiliates are registered\nin Delaware or Oklahoma. U.C.C. § 9-307(e) (“A registered\norganization that is organized under the law of a State is\nlocated in that State.”). Accordingly, the “local law of\n[Delaware or Oklahoma] governs perfection,” not Texas or\nKansas law. U.C.C. § 9-301(1). Oklahoma and Delaware\nrequire perfection by filing a financing statement. Okla. Stat.\ntit. 12A, § 1-9-310; Del. Code tit. 6, § 9-310. Because it is\nundisputed that the Producers never made such a filing, their\ninterests are unperfected.\n\n       The only potential exception to § 9-301(1)’s debtor-\nlocation rule is for as-extracted collateral. See U.C.C. § 9-\n301(4) (“The local law of the jurisdiction in which the\nwellhead or minehead is located governs perfection, the effect\nof perfection or nonperfection, and the priority of a security\ninterest in as-extracted collateral.”). The Producers’ oil does\nnot qualify for this exception because, for oil to be as-\nextracted collateral, a debtor must have a preexisting interest\nin the oil before it is extracted at the wellhead. See U.C.C.\n§ 9-102(a)(6) (“‘As-extracted collateral’ means (A) oil, gas,\nor other minerals that are subject to a security interest that: (i)\nis created by a debtor having an interest in the minerals\nbefore extraction; and (ii) attaches to the minerals as\nextracted; or (B) accounts arising out of the sale at the\nwellhead or minehead of oil, gas, or other minerals in which\nthe debtor had an interest before extraction.”) (emphases\nadded). Here, SemGroup had no interest in the oil while it\n\n\n\n\n                                24\n\fwas in the ground. Only after the Producers extracted and\nsold it did SemGroup become involved.\n\n       The Producers nonetheless argue that these automatic\nperfection laws “necessarily displace” the choice-of-law rule.\nSee Tex. Bus. & Com. Code § 9.343(p) (“The rights of any\nperson claiming under a security interest or lien created by\nthis section are governed by the other provisions of this\nchapter except to the extent that this section necessarily\ndisplaces those provisions.”) (emphasis added); Kan. Stat.\n§ 84-9-339a(o) (same). But nothing about these automatic\nperfection laws “necessarily displace[s]” the rest of Article 9.\nRather, these local laws apply when the debtor is located in\nTexas or Kansas, or where the debtor is so closely involved at\nthe wellhead that it has some preexisting interest in the oil\nbefore it is extracted from the ground so that the oil\nconstitutes as-extracted collateral. U.C.C. §§ 9-301(1) & (4).\n\n        The Producers further rely on a provision referring to\nsecurity interests created by the government. U.C.C. § 9-\n109(c)(3) (“This article does not apply to the extent that . . . a\nstatute of another State, a foreign country, or a governmental\nunit of another State or a foreign country, other than a statute\ngenerally applicable to security interests, expressly governs\ncreation, perfection, priority, or enforcement of a security\ninterest created by the state, country, or governmental unit.”)\n(emphasis added). An entity of Texas or Kansas government\ndid not create the security interests. Instead, the security\ninterests were created by SemGroup purchasing oil from the\nProducers.\n\n       The Producers also argue that Delaware or Oklahoma\nperfection laws incorporate the automatic-perfection oil lien\nlaws. They rely on an Official Comment to a separate section\nof Article 9 (on buyer defenses) that generally mentions the\nexistence of nonuniform amendments. See U.C.C. § 9-320\n\n\n\n\n                               25\n\fcmt.7 (“Several [states] have adopted special statutes and\nnonuniform amendments to Article 9 to provide special\nprotections to mineral owners.”). This Comment recognizes\nthat certain states might adopt special provisions to protect\nmineral owners; it does not automatically incorporate\nunspecified local laws. Beyond that, a Comment to the\nU.C.C. does not supersede statutory text, and the Comment\nsays nothing about overriding Article 9’s choice-of-law rules.\n\n       All told, the Producers misunderstand the burdens and\nuncertainty their U.C.C. interpretation would create.\nSemGroup resold oil from thousands of producers located in\neight different states. The downstream purchasers, including\nJ. Aron and BP, had no dealings with this diverse group of\nproducers, did not even know who these producers were, and\nwere buying oil in bulk from storage centers, so they did not\nknow which producers’ oil they received. To determine\npossible conflicting security interests, instead of merely\nchecking the filing records of the states of the entities they\npurchase from, downstream purchasers would have to\ndiscover the identities and locations of potentially thousands\nof producers with whom they have no contact.\n\n        Eliminating this type of uncertainty was of\nfoundational importance to the U.C.C.’s simplified notice\nsystem. Prior to the 2001 revisions of the U.C.C., parties\nnormally had to search for financing statements wherever a\ndebtor had collateral to know if anything was encumbered.\nSee U.C.C. § 9-103(b)(1) (1995) (“Except as otherwise\nprovided in this subsection, perfection and the effect of\nperfection or non-perfection of a security interest in collateral\nare governed by the law of the jurisdiction where the\ncollateral is when the last event occurs on which is based the\nassertion that the security interest is perfected or\nunperfected.”). Now the U.C.C. requires that a party check\nfor filings in the debtor’s location and understand that locale’s\n\n\n\n\n                               26\n\fsecured transactions laws. See U.C.C. § 9-101 cmt.4(c)\n(“This Article changes the choice-of-law rule governing\nperfection (i.e., where to file) for most collateral to the law of\nthe jurisdiction where the debtor is located.”). If the oil\nproducers want to encumber the oil they sell to an out-of-state\nfirst purchaser, all they need to do is comply with the rules\nuniformly applicable throughout the country to all sellers of\ngoods—file a financing statement in the state where that first\npurchaser is located.\n\n        In conclusion, under U.C.C. § 9-301(1), Delaware and\nOklahoma law govern perfection. Texas and Kansas’s\nnonuniform amendments to Article 9 do not save the\nProducers. J. Aron and BP thus may qualify as buyers for\nvalue because the security interests the Producers may have\nclaimed were not perfected. See U.C.C. § 9-317(b) (buyer-\nfor-value defense only applies “before [the security interest]\nis perfected”).\n\n       2.      J. Aron and BP purchased the oil from\n               SemGroup.\n\n        The second premise underlying the Producers’ claims\nis that J. Aron and BP did not buy the oil from SemGroup.\nInstead, under the parties’ setoff agreements, J. Aron and BP\nacquired oil as a secured party—they took it as collateral for\nthe options trades—and thus did not give “value” for it. See\nU.C.C. § 9-317(b) (“A buyer, other than a secured party, of\n. . . goods . . . takes free of a security interest . . . if the buyer\ngives value . . . .”).\n\n       The Producers mischaracterize J. Aron and BP’s\nbusiness relationships with SemGroup. J. Aron and BP did\nnot acquire the oil because it was collateral for the options\ntrades; they acquired it on credit per industry custom. These\npurchases on credit—promises to pay—are more than\n\n\n\n\n                                 27\n\fsufficient to satisfy the “value” requirement. See U.C.C. § 1-\n204 (“[A] person gives value for rights if the person acquires\nthem . . . (4) in return for any consideration sufficient to\nsupport a simple contract.”). And not only did J. Aron’s and\nBP’s promises to pay satisfy the value requirement, the\npurchases gave SemGroup a new, valuable asset—accounts\nreceivable, or simply “accounts” for U.C.C. purposes. See\nU.C.C. § 9-102(a)(2) (“‘Account’ . . . means a right to\npayment of a monetary obligation . . . (i) for property that has\nbeen or is to be sold . . . .”). SemGroup’s accounts receivable\nwere in turn used as collateral to secure its obligations to J.\nAron and BP under the options trades.\n\n        To illustrate, when J. Aron and BP purchased oil on\ncredit, SemGroup received IOUs from them. These IOUs\nbecame SemGroup’s accounts. In turn, J. Aron and BP\ncontracted for a setoff right between SemGroup’s accounts\nand any amount SemGroup might owe J. Aron or BP for the\noptions trades. In the event SemGroup ended up owing them\nmoney on the options trades, J. Aron and BP would get their\nIOUs (the accounts) back.\n       Hence these IOUs served as collateral for the options\ntrades, not the oil.6 J. Aron and BP received oil simply\n\n6\n  The accounts receivable created by the oil purchases were\nvaluable to SemGroup, reducing its trading costs and\nincreasing its liquidity. For example, as part of its option\ntrades with J. Aron, SemGroup had to post cash collateral to\nmeet margin requirements based on its exposure to that entity.\nThis relieved SemGroup from posting the required cash\nmargin based on the amount J. Aron owed SemGroup for oil\npurchases. To illustrate, if SemGroup had to post a $50,000\ncash margin, it could substitute that amount with the accounts\nreceivable (meaning J. Aron’s IOUs) worth $50,000. As a\n\n\n\n\n                              28\n\fbecause they purchased it. Thus, because J. Aron and BP\npurchased oil from SemGroup and did not acquire it as\nsecured parties, they meet this requirement of the buyer-for-\nvalue defense. See U.C.C. § 9-317(b) (“A buyer, other than a\nsecured party, of . . . goods . . . .”).\n\n       3.     J. Aron and BP did not have knowledge of\nthe           Producers’ security interests.\n\n       Whether J. Aron and BP bought the oil “without\nknowledge of the security interest” is the only remaining\ndisputed requirement. We agree with the District Court that\nno reasonable factfinder could conclude that they had\n\n\nresult of this arrangement, SemGroup could put its cash to\nother uses.\n\n       The accounts receivable also were valuable for the\nProducers and others that dealt with SemGroup. The\nProducers’ security interests could have extended to\nSemGroup’s accounts receivable created by J. Aron and BP’s\npurchases. See U.C.C. § 9-315(a)(2) (“a security interest\nattaches to any identifiable proceeds of collateral”); U.C.C.\n§ 9-102(a)(64) (defining “proceeds” to include “(A) whatever\nis acquired upon the sale, lease, license, exchange, or other\ndisposition of collateral; (B) whatever is collected on, or\ndistributed on account of, collateral. . . .”). But the Producers\ndo not assert their security interests in SemGroup’s accounts\nreceivable, likely because their interests could have been\nsubordinated to J. Aron and BP’s setoff rights. See U.C.C.\n§ 9-404; see also 504 B.R. at 52. The Producers could have\ncontracted with SemGroup to ensure that these accounts\nwould not be used as collateral for SemGroup’s options\ntrading business, but they did not.\n\n\n\n\n                               29\n\fknowledge of the Producers’ security interests in oil. Despite\nvolumes of discovery, at most the Producers have produced\nindications of constructive knowledge (a reason to know), but\nU.C.C. § 1-202(b) requires “actual knowledge.”\n\n       SemGroup sold oil to J. Aron and BP per the industry\nstandard Conoco General Provisions, which expressly\ndisclaim the existence of any continuing security interest:\n“The Seller warrants good title to all crude oil delivered\nhereunder and warrants that such crude oil shall be free from\nall royalties, liens, encumbrances and all applicable foreign,\nfederal, state and local taxes.” J.A. 2505. Some 15 Producers\neven used this Conoco warranty language in their sales to\nSemGroup, although those Producers now argue that it\napplied only to third-party liens, not the ones created between\na Producer and the purchaser.\n\n       It is also undisputed that the Producers never\ncommunicated with J. Aron and BP about any subject, let\nalone a security interest. Indeed, the Producers never took\nany steps to notify anyone about their purported security\ninterest. And despite massive document discovery and\nnumerous depositions, there is no evidence that anyone at J.\nAron or BP—or anyone else for that matter—knew about the\nclaimed security interests.\n\n       Nonetheless, the Producers contend that we can\nreasonably infer actual knowledge because of testimony that\nJ. Aron or BP (1) were aware of state lien laws, (2) knew of\nthe existence of some of the Producers, (3) knew that\nSemGroup purchased the oil on credit from the Producers,\nand (4) were aware that SemGroup’s credit agreements with\nits lending banks carved out from the lending base those\nassets encumbered by “statutory Liens, if any, created under\nthe laws of [various states].”       J.A. 9488-89.      This\ncircumstantial evidence in no way shows that when\n\n\n\n\n                              30\n\fSemGroup resold the oil and expressly warranted that it was\nnot encumbered by security interests, J. Aron and BP actually\nknew the truth was otherwise. At most, this establishes\nconstructive knowledge—that J. Aron and BP might have a\nreason to believe that some oil was encumbered by a security\ninterest at some time. But constructive knowledge does not\ndefeat the buyer-for-value defense; only “actual knowledge”\ndoes. U.C.C. § 1-202(b).\n\n       Thus J. Aron and BP did not have actual knowledge of\nany security interest in the oil they purchased and meet all\nother requirements of the buyer-for-value defense.\nAccordingly, they took the oil free of the Producers’ liens to\nthe extent they even existed.7\n\n\n7\n  In light of this ruling, we need not reach the District and\nBankruptcy Court’s determination in the alternative that J.\nAron and BP took the oil free of the security interests as\nbuyers in the ordinary course. See U.C.C. § 9-320(a) (“[A]\nbuyer in ordinary course of business . . . takes free of a\nsecurity interest created by the buyer’s seller, even if the\nsecurity interest is perfected and the buyer knows of its\nexistence.”); see also U.C.C. § 1-201(b)(9) (the seller must be\n“in the business of selling goods of that kind”). BP purchased\noil from SemCrude, and it is undisputed that SemCrude was\nin the business of buying and selling oil and that it created the\nsecurity interests when it purchased the oil from the\nProducers on credit.          After the Bankruptcy Court\nrecommended summary judgment, however, the Producers\nbelatedly argued that J. Aron cannot avail itself of this\ndefense because it purchased oil from SemCrude’s parent,\nSemGroup. Because the Bankruptcy and District Courts did\nnot have the full opportunity to reach this issue, it is not clear\n\n\n\n\n                               31\n\fB.     The Fraud Claims\n\n        The Producers’ fraud claims also fail. They do not\nbring claims for fraudulent transfers under the Bankruptcy\nCode. See 11 U.S.C. § 548. Rather, they bring a common\nlaw fraud claim, contending that SemGroup did not intend to\npay for the Producers’ oil, and J. Aron and BP participated in\nthis scheme to defraud.\n\n       The Producers first argue that the District Court erred\nprocedurally by granting summary judgment sua sponte on\nfraud because J. Aron and BP moved for summary judgment\nonly as to the causation element of fraud. Even if this were a\n“sua sponte” grant, the Producers knew they needed to show\nthat their fraud claims should survive summary judgment and\nthe District Court did not abuse its discretion.\n\n       District courts “possess the power to enter summary\njudgments sua sponte, so long as the losing party was on\nnotice that she had to come forward with all of her evidence.”\nAnderson v.

Accordingly, out of an abundance of caution, we do\nnot reach this issue.\n\n\n\n\n                              32\n\f        Here, the Producers had the full opportunity to oppose\nsummary judgment. The Bankruptcy Court, at the Producers’\nrequest, continued J. Aron and BP’s initial motions for\nsummary judgment and gave the Producers an additional\nyear of discovery. Because there is no direct evidence of\nfraud, the Producers base their entire fraud claim on\nSemGroup’s business structure and its transactions with J.\nAron and BP. Yet all of this was the subject of discovery.\nThe Producers addressed the fraud claims in oral argument\nbefore the Bankruptcy Court, and they have conducted\nnumerous depositions and compiled documentary evidence\nthat they now rely on in their effort to show fraud.\n\n        Moreover, even if we were to conclude there was\ninsufficient notice or opportunity to develop the record, the\nProducers still have not shown prejudice. They argue that\nthey would have introduced expert affidavits “had they been\ngiven proper notice that J. Aron/BP were moving for\nsummary judgment on all elements of all fraud claims.”\nAssociated Producers Br. 51. These experts merely ask us to\ninfer fraud because J. Aron and BP knew SemGroup’s trading\nstrategy was risky yet continued to trade options. But these\nreports would not have defeated summary judgment.\n\n        J. Aron and BP never communicated with the\nProducers, so naturally they did not make any false\nstatements to them. As noted already, J. Aron and BP did not\neven know the identities of the thousands of producers that\nsold SemGroup the oil. SemGroup, until the bankruptcy\nfiling, always paid the Producers in full for the oil, and J.\nAron and BP also always paid in full for the oil they\npurchased.\n\n      Despite the lack of evidence that anyone did not intend\nto pay for the oil, the Producers contend that SemGroup\npurchased the oil without intending to pay for it and J. Aron\n\n\n\n\n                             33\n\fand BP aided and abetted this fraudulent scheme. But we fail\nto find one item of evidence indicating that SemGroup ever\nintended to avoid paying for oil.\n\n        The Producers never identify a time at which\nSemGroup started buying oil without an intent to pay or with\na reckless disregard for its ability to do so. The only evidence\nof SemGroup’s fraud comes from the Bankruptcy Examiner’s\nreport, but it has nothing to do with SemGroup’s oil\npurchases.       Instead, it addresses certain SemGroup\nexecutives’ misconduct, which formed the basis of a\nshareholder lawsuit. See In re SemCrude L.P., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">796</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">310</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(3d Cir. 2015). And, if anything, the findings of the\nExaminer cut against fraud, as he concluded that SemGroup\nbecame insolvent because it kept losing on its options trades\nand that “[l]ast minute attempts by it to increase its credit\nfacility failed.” J.A. 869. If SemGroup had successfully\nincreased its credit facility and avoided bankruptcy, all\nevidence suggests that it would have paid the Producers.\n\n        Even if we were to assume, for the sake of argument,\nthat this evidence demonstrated that SemGroup defrauded the\nProducers, the evidence that J. Aron and BP conspired with\nSemGroup or aided and abetted this fraudulent scheme is still\nnonexistent.

Civ. App. 1992).\n\n\n\n\n                               34\n\f       There simply is no evidence that either J. Aron or BP\nknew it was taking oil that had not been paid for. Their mere\nknowledge that SemGroup purchased oil on credit, as was\nindustry custom, does not suggest that they knew that any\nunidentified producers were still owed money or that\nSemGroup did not intend to pay for the oil when payment\nwas due. Again, J. Aron and BP were purchasing oil at large\naggregation centers where oil mixed with the same\ncommodity from myriad other producers in various states. J.\nAron and BP did not know that any of the millions of barrels\nof oil they purchased—to the extent it actually was the\nProducers’ oil (a point J. Aron and BP vigorously dispute)—\nhad not been paid for on the agreed payment date or that\nSemGroup did not intend to pay for it. At most the\npurchases-on-credit arrangement that is industry custom\nallows for a reasonable inference that, when J. Aron and BP\ntransacted with SemGroup, they may have known that\nSemGroup might still have owed the Producers. However, no\nevidence leads to a reasonable inference that J. Aron and BP\nknew SemGroup intended to avoid paying for this oil or was\nreckless with its ability to pay for the oil.\n\n       The Producers also attempt to infer fraud from the\noptions trades. They contend that J. Aron and BP knew that\nSemGroup’s trading was speculative and not legitimate\nhedging, and thus, “[d]espite numerous concerns and red\nflags, no one from J. Aron or BP took reasonable steps to\nverify that this was a legitimate trading or hedging strategy,”\nall the while continuing to do business with SemGroup.\nAssociated Producers Br. 56. This lawful activity simply\ndoes not permit an inference of fraud.\n\n       J. Aron and BP paid millions in premiums up front for\noptions to secure a price for oil, protecting themselves against\nan oil-price increase. SemGroup bet the opposite—that oil\nprices would drop. The prices kept rising, so SemGroup lost.\n\n\n\n\n                              35\n\fWhile this was a risky strategy that did not pay off, and in\nhindsight hedging might have served SemGroup better, this\nbusiness arrangement does not demonstrate that J. Aron and\nBP intended to take the oil away from the Producers without\npayment.\n\nC.     The Oklahoma Production Revenue Standards Act\n       Claims\n\n        The Oklahoma Producers separately argue that the\nOklahoma Production Revenue Standards Act (the “PRSA”),\nOkla. Stat. tit. 52, §§ 570.1 et seq., creates an implied trust in\ntheir favor that, absent full payment, travels perpetually down\nthe stream of commerce; in other words, so long as those\nProducers have not been paid, whoever possesses the oil does\nso for their benefit.8 In addition, the argument goes, so long\nas an Oklahoma Producer has not been paid, whoever owns\nthe proceeds of the oil needs to account for those proceeds to\nthat Producer. Thus, even though downstream purchasers\n(like J. Aron) generally do not know the oil producers who\nsold the oil to the midstream purchasers, they allegedly have\nlegal obligations to each Oklahoma Producer. Based on these\ntrust duties, that Producer may bring claims against J. Aron\nfor conversion, unjust enrichment, constructive fraud, and\ndeclaratory relief.\n\n       Fortunately for J. Aron and anyone who has\nunwittingly filled a gas tank with Oklahoma-produced oil,\n\n8\n  There is a sound argument that the Oklahoma Producers\nwaived their PRSA trust arguments by expressly disclaiming\nthem in the District Court. Nevertheless, in light of the\nimportance of the legal questions at stake, we exercise our\ndiscretion to consider the issue despite the waiver. Issa v.\nSch. Dist. of Lancaster, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">847</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">121</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 139 n.8 (3d Cir. 2017).\n\n\n\n\n                               36\n\fthis interpretation simply fails the text of the statute. First,\nwhatever duties the PRSA creates, they do not apply to\ndownstream purchasers like J. Aron. The PRSA regulates the\nrelationships of the many parties at the wellhead, which\ninclude the various interest owners and the operators of those\nwells. Those interests are highly fractionalized and multiple\npersons may have a right to revenue from any well. See Okla.\nStat. tit. 52, § 570.2 (defining an “owner[’s]” interest,\n“proportionate production interest,” “royalty interest,” and\n“subsequently created interest”). The Oklahoma Producers\nthemselves might owe many obligations to the various\ninterest owners of their production. As there are numerous\nparties involved at the wellhead, the PRSA regulates all\nmanner of these parties’ relationship, for example, dictating\nspecific procedures for how proceeds of production are\nshared among interest owners and operators, id. § 570.4, the\nprocess for “[d]esignation of person[s] for certain royalt[ies],\naccounting and remittance functions,” id. § 570.5, detailed\nreporting requirements for all those involved at the wellhead,\nid. 570.8, and the “[i]nformation to be included with\npayments to [the] interest owner,” including how many\ndecimals revenue should be calculated and the measurements\nto describe gas volume. Id. § 570.12.\n        The PRSA, however, has no provisions relating to\ndownstream purchasers. Those purchasers could be located\nout of state, and, as in the case of J. Aron, could be so far\nremoved from the wellhead they do not even know the\nidentities of the producers or the interest owners those\nproducers represent. See Okla. Stat. tit. 52, § 570.2(1)\n(“‘Owner’ means a person or governmental entity with a legal\ninterest in the mineral acreage under a well which entitles that\nperson or entity to oil or gas production or the proceeds or\nrevenues therefrom.”). The statute simply does not govern\nthe relationship of persons who later, down the line of\ncommerce, repurchase this oil.\n\n\n\n\n                              37\n\f       Second, while the PRSA contains some language\nsuggesting a trust-like relationship, there is no language\nstating that it creates an implied trust that travels perpetually\ndown the stream of commerce. PRSA § 570.10(a) states:\n\n       All proceeds from the sale of production shall\n       be regarded as separate and distinct from all\n       other funds of any person receiving or holding\n       the same until such time as such proceeds are\n       paid to the owners legally entitled thereto. Any\n       person holding revenue or proceeds from the\n       sale of production shall hold such revenue or\n       proceeds for the benefit of the owners legally\n       entitled thereto. Nothing in this subsection shall\n       create an express trust.\n\nOkla. Stat. tit. 52, § 570.10(a).\n\n        The Oklahoma Producers rely on a 2008 Oklahoma\nAttorney General Opinion that concluded the language\n“owners legally entitled” to proceeds of the oil actually meant\n“implied beneficiaries,” and therefore “[t]he holder of the\nrevenue or proceeds of oil and gas production acquires no\nright, title or interest in such revenue or proceeds.” 2008 OK\nAG 31 ¶ 22 (citations omitted). The Bankruptcy Court\nrejected the Attorney General’s interpretation, and so have an\nOklahoma intermediate appellate court and District Courts in\nOklahoma.

Okla. Apr. 1,\n2010). We agree.\n\n\n\n\n                                38\n\f        Although the PRSA’s language—that sale proceeds\n“shall be regarded as separate and distinct” and shall be held\nfor the benefit of the owners “legally entitled thereto”—\nechoes trust language, these words cannot be stretched to\ncreate automatically an implied trust. First, it is a conceptual\nleap to take the language “paid to the owners legally entitled\nthereto” to mean that interest owners and producers\nautomatically possess the “legal entitlement” of ownership of\na beneficial interest in the proceeds, and that whoever\nactually holds the proceeds has no title to them. As the\nBankruptcy Court noted, in the few instances where\nOklahoma statutes have been construed to create an implied\ntrust, those statutes imposed many more trust duties. See 407\nB.R. at 152 (“[Those other statutes] demonstrated the\nrequisite clear intent to form a trust because the State of\nOklahoma (or an organ thereof) is the trustee, holding\nidentified funds, for the benefit of identified beneficiaries. In\nsharp contrast, the PRSA does not identify a specific trustee,\nactually require segregation of a trust res or otherwise impose\nrights and        duties    typically associated with a\ntrustee/beneficiary relationship.”).\n\n        Second, a more faithful interpretation of the PRSA is\nthat it provides for the imposition of a trust only in limited\nways. As the concluding sentence of PRSA § 570.10(a)\nstates, “Nothing in this subsection shall create an express\ntrust.” In contrast to an express trust, implied trusts arise in\nOklahoma where it would be inequitable for one party to keep\ntitle to property. There are two types of implied trusts—\nresulting or constructive. A resulting trust may be judicially\nimposed “where the circumstances indicate that the grantor of\nlegal title to property did not intend for the beneficial interest\nto be enjoyed by the grantee of the legal title.” Gaskins, 321\nP.3d at 989 n.5 (citation omitted). A constructive trust may\nbe imposed “when an individual obtains a legal right to\nproperty through fraudulent, abusive means, or through a\n\n\n\n\n                               39\n\fmethod which violates equity and good conscience.” Id.\n(citation omitted). In either case, equity or good conscience\ncould require imposing trustee burdens on a party who\nviolated a duty owed to another under the PRSA. However,\nthe Oklahoma Producers do not argue that equity demands\nimposition of a trust, but only rely on the Attorney General’s\ninterpretation that the PRSA automatically implies a trust.\n\n        Finally, the Oklahoma Producers argue that the\nlegislature “restated” that the PRSA created trust rights when\nit passed the 2010 Oklahoma Lien Act. This new Act created\nautomatic oil liens in favor of producers that are outside the\nscope of the U.C.C. See Sahar Jooshani, There’s A New Act\nin Town: How the Oklahoma Oil and Gas Owners’ Lien Act\nof 2010 Strengthens the Position of Oklahoma Interest\nOwners, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">65</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Okla.</span> <span class=\"page\">L</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Rev. 133 (2012); Alvin C. Harrell and\nFrederick H. Miller, Aftermath of the SemGroup Case:\nOklahoma Enacts the Oil and Gas Owners’ Lien Act of\n2010, 81 Okla. Bar Assoc. J. 2818 (2010).\n\n         The 2010 Lien Act does not apply to our appeal\nbecause it post-dated SemGroup’s bankruptcy. Yet the\nOklahoma Producers point to it as evidence that the\nOklahoma Legislature believed the PRSA created\nautomatically an implied trust. The Lien Act includes buyer\ndefenses for the liens it creates, which also apply to PRSA\n§ 570.10(a): if the downstream purchasers were buyers in the\nordinary course or had paid all consideration due, they take\nfree of “any obligations created by [the PRSA].” Okla. Stat.\ntit. 52, § 549.6. The logic is that if the Oklahoma Legislature\ndid not believe that the PRSA creates trust rights, the 2010\nLien Act would not have included buyer defenses to the\nPRSA. However, our take is that to the extent an implied\ntrust could be imposed under PRSA § 570.10(a), all the\nOklahoma Legislature made clear was that downstream\npurchasers could avail themselves of buyer defenses.\n\n\n\n\n                              40\n\f       In summary, the PRSA did not create an implied trust\nhere and did not impose any duties on J. Aron. As all the\nOklahoma Producers’ theories of relief were predicated on\nthis construal of the Act, the District Court correctly entered\nsummary judgment against the Oklahoma Producers.\n\n                 *      *      *       *      *\n\n        Texas, Kansas, and Oklahoma all include statutes that\nprovide some protections for those who produce oil in their\nStates, but those protections do not reach downstream parties\nlike J. Aron and BP. The Producers theoretically could have\nperfected their security interests, traced those interests in the\noil that extended to their accounts receivable, and forbade\nSemGroup from using those accounts as margin collateral for\ntheir options trades.\n\n       But why didn’t the Producers take such precautions?\nThey contend they are a loose collection of relatively\nunsophisticated parties. However, these parties pool their\ninterests and choose operators to extract and sell their oil; it\ndoes not seem farfetched that they could also choose a\nrepresentative to file financing statements to perfect security\ninterests or take other measures to protect against an oil\npurchaser’s insolvency. The more likely explanation is that\nno midstream or downstream oil purchaser would buy oil\nfrom the Producers if they sought to encumber that oil as it\nflowed through interstate commerce and changed hands.\n\n       The oil industry operates through sales on credit. It\ninvolves thousands of producers and those producers\nrepresent countless interest owners who have fractionalized\ninterests at the well. Downstream purchasers have no contact\nwith these producers and do not even know who they are.\nThis oil is pooled with myriad other producers’ oil and is\nresold many times before consumers get it at the retail pump.\n\n\n\n\n                               41\n\fThe industry thus uses the Conoco warranty that this oil is\nsold free and clear of any liens because it is a hard-to-trace,\nliquid asset that flows throughout the country.\n\n       In sum, if any producer of oil tries to sell it subject to a\nsecurity interest or implied trust that flows endlessly down the\nstream of commerce, it will be unsold. The Producers’\ncontention that a lien or trust follows oil from their wells to\nthe gas pump does not make sense for this type of market.\nThe effect of any opinion from us upholding the Producers’\npositions would be chaos. We thus affirm the superbly\nreasoned rulings of both the Bankruptcy and District Courts.\n\n\n\n\n                                42\n\f</pre>",
