AYERS\n                         OPINION\n\nTALLMAN, Circuit Judge:\n\n   Scott Lynn Pinholster faces a death sentence in California\nfor murdering Thomas Johnson and Robert Beckett on Janu-\nary 9, 1982, robbing Johnson and Beckett with intentional\ninfliction of great bodily injury and with personal use of a\nknife, robbing Todd Croutch with a firearm, and burglarizing\nMichael Kumar’s residence. The jury found two special cir-\ncumstances: Pinholster, in the same proceeding, was con-\nvicted of more than one murder, Cal. Penal Code\n§ 190.2(a)(3) (1984), and he committed the murders during a\nrobbery and a burglary, id. § 190.2(a)(17)(i), (vii). The jury\nfixed Pinholster’s penalty at death, and on June 4, 1984, the\nLos Angeles County Superior Court so sentenced him.\n\n   On automatic appeal, the California Supreme Court, in an\nopinion written by Justice Stanley Mosk, set aside one\nmultiple-murder special-circumstance finding but otherwise\naffirmed the judgment. See People v. Pinholster, 824 P.2d\n571 (Cal. 1992). Pinholster sought a writ of habeas corpus. He\nchallenged his convictions and death sentence. The California\nSupreme Court summarily denied Pinholster’s state petition\nfor habeas corpus. Pinholster filed a federal habeas corpus\npetition but the district court dismissed it when the parties\nstipulated that the petition contained unexhausted claims. Pin-\nholster returned to state court to exhaust those claims. On\nOctober 1, 1997, the California Supreme Court denied Pinhol-\nster’s second habeas petition.\n\n   Pinholster then filed an amended federal habeas petition\nand requested an evidentiary hearing on several claims. The\ndistrict court granted the State’s motion for summary judg-\nment on Pinholster’s claims challenging the constitutionality\nof his convictions. Pinholster appeals the district court’s\ndenial of his request for an evidentiary hearing on his guilt\nphase ineffective assistance of counsel claims. However, the\n\f                           PINHOLSTER v. AYERS                           4735\ndistrict court concluded that his counsel inadequately investi-\ngated and deficiently presented mitigating evidence at the\npenalty phase and granted Pinholster’s habeas petition with\nrespect to the death penalty. The State cross-appeals the dis-\ntrict court’s judgment setting aside Pinholster’s death sen-\ntence.\n\n   We affirm the district court’s denial of an evidentiary hear-\ning on Pinholster’s claims of ineffective assistance during the\nguilt phase. We reverse the district court’s grant of habeas\nrelief on Pinholster’s death sentence.\n\n                                      I\n\n                                      A\n\n   On January 9, 1982, Pinholster fatally stabbed the victims,\nJohnson and Beckett, during Pinholster’s burglary of Kumar’s\nresidence.1 Pinholster, 824 P.2d at 582. Kumar was a known\ndrug dealer and acquaintance of Pinholster. Charles Kempf,\nanother acquaintance of Pinholster, testified that in mid-\nDecember 1981, Pinholster suggested to Kempf and three oth-\ners that they rob Kumar of his drug stash.2 Id. According to\nKempf, Pinholster considered Kumar “an easy mark.” Id. The\nfive went to Kumar’s home, but soon aborted the plan. Kumar\nwas not home during the December visit, and they preferred\nto gain access through Kumar rather than break in. Id. Kempf\ntestified that Pinholster carried a buck knife, and Pinholster\nclaimed he would get Kumar’s drugs “one way or the other.”\nIn addition, Kempf testified that Pinholster bragged about\n  1\n     We extract many of the facts and procedural history from the Califor-\nnia Supreme Court opinion affirming Pinholster’s convictions and death\nsentence on direct appeal, Pinholster, 824 P.2d 571, which are confirmed\nby our own independent review of the record.\n   2\n     Kempf had a previous conviction for receiving stolen property and was\nunder arrest when he first talked with the police. He told the jury that the\nauthorities did not promise leniency or other benefits in return for his testi-\nmony. Pinholster, 824 P.2d at 582.\n\f4736                  PINHOLSTER v. AYERS\nhaving stabbed someone in the rectum during a previous rob-\nbery. Id.\n\n   Art Corona—an accomplice in the crimes—served as the\nState’s primary witness. He testified that on January 8, 1982,\nhe attended a social gathering at Pinholster’s apartment com-\nplex. Id. Corona agreed to help Pinholster and co-defendant\nBrown rob Kumar. Id. En route, Corona drove the two in his\ncar and stopped at Lisa Tapar’s residence. Id. Pinholster\nwanted Tapar to help them gain access to Kumar’s residence.\nId. After Tapar refused to allow Pinholster into her apartment,\nhe used his buck knife to vandalize the door of her apartment\nand the hood of her car. Id. Tapar, her father, and another wit-\nness corroborated Corona’s version of this incident. The\ngroup then left Tapar’s apartment to burglarize Kumar’s resi-\ndence.\n\n   Corona testified about the events that took place during the\nburglary. Pinholster gained entry by breaking a window in the\nrear of the home and Brown entered through an open sliding-\nglass door. Id. at 582-83. The three ransacked the house. Id.\nat 583. Pinholster found marijuana in a bedroom and spilled\na green substance in the kitchen. Id. At this time, victims\nJohnson and Beckett (Kumar’s housesitters) arrived, opened\nthe front door, discovered the crime, and shouted they would\ncall the police. The three burglars attempted to leave through\nthe rear sliding-glass door, but Johnson and Beckett came\naround to the back. As Johnson tried to enter, Pinholster\nstabbed Johnson in the chest three to four times with the\nknife. The California Supreme Court summarized Corona’s\ndescription of the robbery, stabbing, and murders as follows:\n\n    [Pinholster] backed [Johnson] out of the house and\n    onto the patio, demanding drugs and money and\n    repeatedly striking him. Johnson dropped his wallet\n    on the ground and obeyed [Pinholster’s] order to sit.\n    Then Beckett approached, and [Pinholster] attacked\n    him. Corona saw that [Pinholster] was stabbing\n\f                      PINHOLSTER v. AYERS                     4737\n      Beckett, striking him in the chest as Corona had seen\n      [Pinholster] strike Johnson. [Pinholster] repeatedly\n      stabbed Beckett, again demanding money and drugs.\n      [Pinholster] picked up Johnson’s wallet and took a\n      wallet from Beckett’s pocket. [Pinholster] repeatedly\n      kicked Beckett in the head. Corona then saw code-\n      fendant Brown stabbing Johnson in the chest. The\n      three men withdrew, and Corona drove them back to\n      [Pinholster’s] apartment. Brown and [Pinholster]\n      commented that they had “gotten them good,” and\n      Brown said he had “buried his knife to the hilt” in\n      Johnson.\n\nId.\n\n  After the murders, the three returned to Pinholster’s apart-\nment and split the proceeds. Pinholster washed his knife and\na woman named Debbie washed Brown’s knife. Id. The next\nday, Pinholster telephoned Corona and told him to “lie low.”\nTwo weeks later, Corona turned himself in and gave a state-\nment to the police. Corona testified at trial consistent with his\nearlier statement except that at trial he also mentioned seeing\nBrown stab Johnson and that he, Brown, and Pinholster\ndivided the proceeds. Id.\n\n   Casey Corona, Art Corona’s wife, was at Pinholster’s\napartment when Pinholster, Brown, and Art Corona returned\nfrom Kumar’s house. At trial, Casey corroborated Corona’s\ntestimony about the planning, execution, and cover up of the\nrobbery/murders. She testified that she saw Pinholster wash\nblood off his knife and she heard him say: “It had to be done\nthe way it was done. We had to do what we had to do.” Id.\nPolice had recently arrested Casey on a drug charge, and she\ntestified that the prosecution assisted her entry into a diver-\nsion program.\n\n  Art Corona also testified that Pinholster had threatened him\non numerous occasions. Specifically, prior to the preliminary\n\f4738                  PINHOLSTER v. AYERS\nhearing, Pinholster threatened to “blow up” Corona on his\nway to court if Corona testified against him. Pinholster\nimpeached Corona with Corona’s prior burglary conviction\nand Corona’s admission that he was a professional burglar. Id.\n\n   The State introduced physical evidence to corroborate Pin-\nholster’s presence in Kumar’s residence after it had been ran-\nsacked. Corona testified that Pinholster wore jeans and boots\non the night of the murders. Police found boots with micro-\nscopic blood stains and a towel with a blood stain in Pinhol-\nster’s apartment. Police also found a pair of jeans with a blood\nstain; however, investigators could not confirm whether the\nblood was human. In addition, when police arrested Brown,\nhe had a buck knife with dimensions that corresponded to one\nof Johnson’s stab wounds. Id. at 583-84. Investigators also\ndiscovered traces of human blood near the hilt of Brown’s\nknife. The police found human blood on the inside forearm of\nthe sleeve of Corona’s shirt, but they found no blood on his\nknife. Id. at 584.\n\n   Pinholster presented an alibi when he testified in his own\ndefense at trial. He characterized himself as a “professional\nrobber” who used guns while preying on drug dealers, not a\nmurderer who used knives. He boasted of being a “very good\nrobber,” claiming that he had committed “hundreds” of rob-\nberies and that he had only been caught by the authorities one\ntime. To support his defense, Pinholster admitted to robbing\nThomas Croutch at gunpoint on another occasion, and having\nplanned to rob Kumar, but denied having recruited Kempf and\nthe three other individuals to do so. Pinholster also admitted\nto breaking into Kumar’s house on the night of the murders.\n\n   By way of his alibi, Pinholster claimed he had thrown a\nparty in memory of his best friend, “Shotgun,” on the night\nof the murders. Id. He testified that around 8 p.m. he left the\nparty and went to Kumar’s house, broke a window, and\ngained access through the kitchen. He took a bag of mari-\njuana, touched a bluish substance in a bedroom, and spilled a\n\f                          PINHOLSTER v. AYERS                           4739\nbag with green material in the kitchen. He denied ransacking\nthe house or killing anyone.3 Id. Pinholster said he had\nreturned to his house around 9 p.m., and smoked a consider-\nable amount of marijuana and consumed a lot of alcohol.\nAround 11:30 p.m., Corona asked Pinholster for an ounce of\nmarijuana to sell. Pinholster said he gave Kumar’s address to\nCorona in exchange for a third of whatever drugs Corona took\nfrom Kumar’s house. Corona could not find Kumar’s resi-\ndence and returned around 1 a.m. Pinholster gave him the\ndirections again, and around 1:30 a.m. Pinholster went to\nTapar’s house to tell her that “Shotgun” had died.4 Id. at 585.\nHe admitted to stabbing her door and carving a swastika and\nlightning bolt on her car after she refused to admit him. Pin-\nholster claimed that he returned to his apartment around 2\na.m., and Corona returned around 4 a.m. Pinholster’s brother\nand several friends corroborated his version of the events. The\nsuperior court jury by its verdict obviously rejected Pinhol-\nster’s alibi defense.\n\n                                     B\n\n   The State sought the death penalty. On March 22, 1983, the\nprosecution mailed a California Penal Code section 190.3 let-\nter to Pinholster at the Los Angeles County Jail, notifying him\nthat the State intended to offer aggravating evidence at the\npenalty proceedings. Pinholster and his counsel5 contended\n  3\n     During rebuttal, the state called Eric Klemetti who testified that he had\npurchased marijuana from Johnson at the Kumar residence at 9 p.m. He\nclaimed that the house was not ransacked and everything was in order.\nPinholster, 824 P.2d at 585.\n   4\n     On rebuttal, Tapar contradicted Pinholster when she testified that Pin-\nholster arrived at her house in Corona’s car, not his own as he had said.\nShe also claimed not to have known “Shotgun,” giving Pinholster no rea-\nson to discuss his death with her.\n   5\n     Between April 20, 1982, and January 19, 1983, court-appointed coun-\nsel Marvin Part represented Pinholster. Attorney James Armstrong was\nappointed in his place in January 1983. Pinholster requested to proceed\n\f4740                     PINHOLSTER v. AYERS\nthey were not informed of the letter until the guilt phase con-\ncluded on April 24, 1984. Pinholster moved to exclude aggra-\nvating evidence based on the prosecution’s failure to comply\nwith California Penal Code section 190.3. The court denied\nthe motion.6 Rather than move to continue the penalty phase\n—a request the state trial court indicated it would grant—\nPinholster’s counsel (Brainard and Dettmar) elected to pro-\nceed. The penalty phase began on May 1, 1984. The court\ninstructed the jury on May 2, 1984, and the jury returned a\nverdict of death on each of the two murder counts on May 7,\n1984.\n\n   The prosecution called eight penalty phase witnesses. First,\nJack Taube, Pinholster’s juvenile probation officer, testified\nthat Pinholster had previously struck a bailiff without cause\nafter a court proceeding. Several bailiffs had to physically\nrestrain Pinholster, and, as Pinholster left the proceeding, he\ncontinued to orally threaten the wounded bailiff. Taube also\ntestified about Pinholster’s involvement in juvenile gangs.\nSecond, Los Angeles Police Department (“LAPD”) patrol\nofficer David Kaufman testified that shortly after he and his\npartner responded to a fight involving Pinholster, Pinholster\nappeared to fake an epileptic seizure. Officer Kaufman also\ntestified that once handcuffed, Pinholster became belligerent\nand threatened to kick the officers. After the officers trans-\nferred Pinholster to a facility for possible medical treatment,\n\nwithout counsel, and from March 17, 1983, to July 13, 1983, Pinholster\nrepresented himself. On July 12, 1983, the Los Angeles County Superior\nCourt appointed Harry W. Brainard after Pinholster changed his mind. On\nDecember 20, 1983, the superior court also appointed Wilbur G. Dettmar\nas second counsel under California Penal Code section 1095. Brainard and\nDettmar represented Pinholster during the guilt and penalty phases of his\ntrial.\n   6\n     On state habeas review, the Los Angeles County Superior Court held\nan evidentiary hearing and determined that Pinholster, while representing\nhimself pre-trial, received actual notice of the State’s intent to seek the\ndeath penalty. Pinholster does not challenge that finding here.\n\f                     PINHOLSTER v. AYERS                  4741\nand upon removing Pinholster’s leg restraints, Pinholster\nkicked Officer Kaufman in the head.\n\n   Third, Ernest Guzman, another LAPD officer, testified that\nafter refusing to enter his police vehicle on a different occa-\nsion, Pinholster seemingly faked an epileptic seizure. After\nthe officers placed Pinholster in the police car he became vio-\nlent, kicking at Officer Guzman’s head. After Pinholster told\nthe officers that he had a knee injury, they transported him to\nValley Receiving Hospital for an evaluation. During that time,\nPinholster spat in Guzman’s partner’s face, and refused to\nallow doctors to examine his knee. Pinholster kicked and\nbroke one of the glass panes in the x-ray machine. Fourth,\nDeputy Sheriff Michael Loper testified to having “numerous\nrun-ins” with Pinholster in a Los Angeles County Jail. Pinhol-\nster struck Loper as he assisted another deputy in gaining con-\ntrol over Pinholster, who had refused to comply with jail\nrules.\n\n   Fifth, Operations Sergeant Thomas Piggott testified about\nPinholster’s violent reputation and disciplinary record at the\nLos Angeles County Central Jail. He described eleven docu-\nmented incidents of Pinholster’s violence or recalcitrance and\nstated that Pinholster had a reputation of throwing cups of\nurine at the deputies as they walked by his cell. Piggott also\ntestified that he tried to counsel Pinholster, but Pinholster\ninsisted that he wanted to go to prison. Piggott recalled Pin-\nholster saying, “They better send me now, because if they\ndon’t I’ll just go out on the streets and do something to get\nback in, go to prison.”\n\n  Sixth, Theodore Mesquita testified about fighting with Pin-\nholster over a woman Mesquita dated, which resulted in Pin-\nholster cutting Mesquita’s arm with a straight razor, requiring\napproximately fifty stitches. Pinholster’s wife, Cathy Ann\nSmith, testified that Pinholster once broke her jaw while\nseeming to have an epileptic seizure. Finally, Sheriff’s Ser-\n\f4742                  PINHOLSTER v. AYERS\ngeant Joseph Barrett testified that Pinholster told Barrett he\nwould kill Art Corona when released from prison.\n\n   In addition, to minimize the inconvenience of gathering\nwitnesses from San Luis Obispo, Pinholster’s counsel stipu-\nlated that (1) Pinholster’s prior kidnaping conviction involved\na knife, but that no plea bargain governed the knife use allega-\ntion (Pinholster admitted to carrying the knife and placing it\nat the victim’s throat), and (2) Pinholster committed numer-\nous prison disciplinary infractions, including throwing urine\nat and threatening various corrections officers. Counsel stipu-\nlated that Pinholster threatened to stab a corrections officer\nand to throw another corrections officer off of the prison tier.\nPinholster’s disciplinary infractions resulted in the Director of\nCorrections ordering Pinholster to be placed on a special\ndisciplinary diet for a nine-day period in 1979, a procedure\nreserved for only the most disruptive inmates.\n\n   Pinholster’s counsel, Dettmar, waived making an opening\nstatement in the penalty phase of his trial and immediately\ncalled Pinholster’s mother, Burnice Brashear. She testified\nabout Pinholster’s strained relationship with his step-father,\nBud Brashear; Pinholster’s head injury at age two and one-\nhalf years when she ran over him with her car; his head injury\nshortly thereafter when his head cracked the windshield dur-\ning a car accident; his disruptive behavior at school; a psy-\nchologist’s recommendation that Pinholster be committed to\na mental hospital when he was ten; his time in a class for the\nemotionally handicapped; his view of himself as a neighbor-\nhood Robin Hood because he stole things to distribute to the\nneighborhood children; his frequent stays at boys’ homes,\njuvenile halls, and juvenile camps; and his epilepsy, which\nshe believed resulted from a severe beating at age eighteen in\ncounty jail.\n\n                               C\n\n   Following Pinholster’s unsuccessful direct appeal, he initi-\nated habeas proceedings in state and federal court. We detail\n\f                       PINHOLSTER v. AYERS                     4743\nhis submissions with regard to his penalty phase ineffective\nassistance of counsel claim because the State contends that,\nby the time of the federal evidentiary hearing, this claim had\ntransmogrified into a completely new theory for which Pin-\nholster now relies on yet a third set of mental health experts.\n\n                                 1\n\n   Pinholster raised fifty claims for relief in his state habeas\npetition. Relevant to this appeal, Pinholster claims his counsel\nprovided ineffective assistance at the guilt and penalty phases\nof his trial. Regarding his death sentence, he argues that his\ntrial counsel unreasonably failed to investigate, prepare, and\npresent mitigating evidence, and unreasonably presented evi-\ndence that hurt his mitigation case. Had his counsel investi-\ngated mitigating evidence, he contends, his lawyers would\nhave uncovered a wealth of mitigating evidence—a turbulent,\ndysfunctional, violent and abusive home life; serious, well-\ndocumented educational disabilities; and profound mental dis-\norders. To support this claim, Pinholster submitted declara-\ntions from family members and from his trial attorney,\nBrainard; various medical, legal, and school records of Pin-\nholster and his relatives; and a declaration obtained during\nhabeas proceedings from psychiatrist Dr. George Woods.\n\n   Dr. Woods diagnosed Pinholster with a long standing bipo-\nlar mood disorder with psychotic features. Dr. Woods opined\nthat, during the murders, Pinholster was substantially\nimpaired by a bipolar mood disorder operating synergistically\nwith a seizure disorder.7 Dr. Woods also criticized Dr. John\nStalberg’s psychiatric evaluation. Dr. Stalberg had previously\nexamined Pinholster at defense counsel’s request on March\n11, 1984, after trial began. He reviewed case materials sup-\nplied by counsel, including police reports and a probation\nreport. Dr. Stalberg concluded that Pinholster did not manifest\n  7\n  “Seizure disorder” is the medically preferred term for what is com-\nmonly known as epilepsy.\n\f4744                      PINHOLSTER v. AYERS\nby history any significant signs of mental disorder or defect\nother than Antisocial Personality Disorder.8 Dr. Stalberg\nstated he saw no mitigating evidence, and defense counsel\ndecided not to pursue this issue at the time. Habeas counsel\ndisavowed Dr. Stalberg as a credible expert after retaining Dr.\nWoods to criticize Dr. Stalberg’s mid-trial evaluation of Pin-\nholster.\n\n   After the parties filed briefing in the state habeas case, the\nCalifornia Supreme Court issued an order to show cause, but\nsubsequently vacated it as “improvidently granted.” The court\nthen denied the writ “on the substantive ground that it is with-\nout merit.” The California Supreme Court also denied several\nother claims on procedural grounds.\n\n                                     2\n\n   In Pinholster’s first federal habeas petition, he continued to\nmaintain that his trial counsel unreasonably failed to investi-\ngate, prepare, and present mitigating evidence during the pen-\nalty phase. This time, however, Pinholster switched tactics\nand renamed Dr. Stalberg as his psychiatric expert. In April\n1997, Pinholster’s habeas counsel asked Dr. Stalberg to\nreview additional materials pertaining to Pinholster and his\nfamily. Dr. Stalberg reviewed the materials and spoke with\nseveral of Pinholster’s family members. Dr. Stalberg then\nconcluded that knowledge of Pinholster’s family history of\n   8\n     The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM),\nDSM-III, the American Psychiatric Association’s handbook in effect in\n1984 for diagnosing mental disorders, describes Antisocial Personality\nDisorder as a personality disorder with a history of continuous and chronic\nantisocial behavior in which the rights of others are violated, persistence\ninto adult life of a pattern of antisocial behavior that began before the age\nof 15, and failure to sustain good job performance over a period of several\nyears. Lying, stealing, fighting, truancy, and resisting authority are typi-\ncally prevalent in early childhood, and in adulthood these kinds of behav-\nior continue and include the failure to accept social norms with respect to\nlawful behavior.\n\f                      PINHOLSTER v. AYERS                  4745\nsevere psychiatric disorders, Pinholster’s disturbed behavior\nduring childhood, and his irrational and highly aggressive\nactions immediately before the homicides would have caused\nhim to inquire further before concluding that Pinholster\nmerely had a personality disorder. Dr. Stalberg also would\nhave inquired further to determine if the homicides related to\na mental impairment caused by organic/neurological dysfunc-\ntion. Dr. Stalberg now declared that the new information he\nreviewed would have materially modified his previous opin-\nion regarding mitigating circumstances, and that his review\nnow demonstrated the existence of voluminous mitigating\nevidence.\n\n   Because the declaration contained new material facts, the\nparties stipulated that certain claims, including the penalty\nphase ineffective assistance of counsel claim, were unex-\nhausted. The district court allowed Pinholster to exhaust the\nclaims in state court.\n\n                               3\n\n   Pinholster filed a copy of his federal petition and Dr. Stal-\nberg’s new declaration in the California Supreme Court. The\ncourt denied Pinholster’s petition “on the substantive ground\nthat it was without merit” and denied other claims on proce-\ndural grounds.\n\n                               4\n\n   Pinholster filed a “First Amended Petition for Writ of\nHabeas Corpus” in federal court on November 14, 1997. On\nApril 13, 1999, Pinholster filed a request for a federal eviden-\ntiary hearing. Applying pre-Antiterrorism and Effective Death\nPenalty Act (“AEDPA”) standards, the district court granted\nan evidentiary hearing on Pinholster’s penalty phase ineffec-\n\f4746                      PINHOLSTER v. AYERS\ntive assistance of counsel claim, and two other claims not rel-\nevant to this appeal.9\n\n   Dr. Stalberg anticipated testifying as a witness at the fed-\neral evidentiary hearing. Pinholster submitted two new decla-\nrations from Dr. Stalberg to support his amended federal\nhabeas petition. The first, dated January 24, 2000, explained\nthat it was Dr. Stalberg’s custom and practice in 1984 when\nretained by defense counsel in a capital case to form an opin-\nion about a defendant’s mental state during the offense and to\nidentify mitigating circumstances. The second, dated June 5,\n2001, expanded upon and specified the factual bases for the\nopinions Dr. Stalberg previously presented to the district\ncourt. In July 2001, the State Attorney General’s Office\ndeposed Dr. Stalberg. The Deputy Attorney General ques-\ntioned Dr. Stalberg about his earlier declarations, and Pinhol-\nster’s counsel asked Dr. Stalberg to elaborate on various\naspects of his opinions, and to express his opinions about Pin-\nholster’s mental health.\n\n   Dr. Stalberg testified that the additional materials he\nreviewed did not alter his conclusion that Pinholster suffers\nfrom Antisocial Personality Disorder. As a result of this dam-\naging testimony, on May 9, 2002, Pinholster’s current coun-\nsel, the Federal Public Defender, advised Dr. Stalberg that he\nwould no longer call him as a witness during the evidentiary\nhearing, and he no longer considered Dr. Stalberg to be Pin-\nholster’s expert.\n\n   The district court nonetheless proceeded with an evidenti-\nary hearing in September 2002. The Federal Public Defend-\ner’s Office now utilized two new experts—Dr. Sophia\nVinogradov and Dr. Donald Olson—to bolster Pinholster’s\n  9\n    At this time, the district court also granted the State’s motion for sum-\nmary judgment on select claims, including Pinholster’s claims of ineffec-\ntive assistance of counsel at the guilt phase discussed in section III of this\nopinion.\n\f                      PINHOLSTER v. AYERS                  4747\npenalty phase ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Dr.\nVinogradov and Dr. Olson both submitted declarations as\ndirect testimony at the evidentiary hearing. Dr. Vinogradov\nconcluded that Pinholster suffered “personality change,\naggressive type, due to serious childhood head trauma.” Dr.\nOlson, a pediatric neurologist, testified that Pinholster likely\nsuffered brain damage from two head injuries in his early\nchildhood, which created a risk of epilepsy.\n\n   On March 25, 2003, the district court granted Pinholster’s\nhabeas petition and vacated his death sentence. The district\ncourt noted that Pinholster’s attorneys admitted they had not\n“prepared any evidence by way of mitigation,” yet trial coun-\nsel declined an offer for a penalty phase continuance to pre-\npare extenuating evidence. The district court further reasoned\nthat trial counsel called one witness—Pinholster’s mother—\nand her testimony was damaging, incomplete, and inaccurate.\nThe district court found Pinholster’s attorneys’ performance\ndeficient because they failed to adequately investigate miti-\ngating evidence and lacked a reasonable strategic decision for\ntheir failure. The district court ultimately found prejudice\nbased on the significant evidence of Pinholster’s childhood\nabuse and mental impairments, combined with the prosecu-\ntor’s emphasis during summation on the lack of mitigating\nevidence and the length of the jury’s deliberations.\n\n   The district court revisited its March 25, 2003, Order\nGranting Writ of Habeas Corpus, after determining that\nAEDPA applied under Woodford v. Garceau, 538 U.S. 202\n(2003). The Supreme Court filed Woodford on the same day\nthe district court had filed its Order. The district court none-\ntheless concluded that: (1) Pinholster timely filed his federal\nhabeas petition; (2) Pinholster was entitled to an evidentiary\nhearing under AEDPA; and (3) AEDPA did not affect its\nOrder granting Pinholster habeas relief because the California\nSupreme Court “did not adjudicate Pinholster’s claim that\ncounsel was ineffective for failing to investigate and present\nmitigating evidence at the penalty phase.”\n\f4748                      PINHOLSTER v. AYERS\n                                    II\n\n  We review de novo the district court’s decision to grant or\ndeny a petition for writ of habeas corpus. Lambert v. Blodgett,\n393 F.3d 943, 964 (9th Cir. 2004). We review factual findings\nand credibility findings made in the context of granting or\ndenying the petition for clear error. Id.\n\n   Neither party disputes that AEDPA now governs Pinhol-\nster’s petition. AEDPA requires us to defer to the state court’s\ndetermination of federal issues, unless that determination\nresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an\nunreasonable application of, clearly established federal law,\nas determined by the Supreme Court. 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1).10\nDeference to state court decisions applies only to claims the\nstate court adjudicated on the merits.11 Lambert, 393 F.3d at\n965. De novo review applies if the state court did not reach\n  10\n      The court may also grant a petition where the state court adjudication\nof a claim is based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light\nof the evidence presented in the state court proceeding. 28 U.S.C.\n§ 2254(d)(2). We will address § 2254(d)(2) only when applicable to Pin-\nholster’s appeal.\n   11\n      The district court incorrectly concluded that the California Supreme\nCourt’s decision disposing of Pinholster’s penalty phase ineffective assis-\ntance of counsel claim was not an adjudication on the merits entitled to\ndeference. The California Supreme Court’s denial of a habeas petition\nwithout comment or citation constitutes a decision on the merits of the\nfederal claims. See Hunter v. Aispuro, 982 F.2d 344, 347-48 (9th Cir.\n1992); see also Gaston v. Palmer, 417 F.3d 1030, 1038 (9th Cir. 2005).\nThough we would ordinarily look through the California Supreme Court’s\nsummary denial to the “last reasoned decision [in the state court system],”\nShackleford v. Hubbard, 234 F.3d 1072, 1079 n.2 (9th Cir. 2000), no other\nstate court determination addresses ineffective assistance of counsel at the\npenalty phase. Absent a last-reasoned state court decision on this claim,\nwe must “perform an ‘independent review of the record’ to ascertain\nwhether the state court decision was objectively unreasonable.” Himes v.\nThompson, 336 F.3d 848, 853 (9th Cir. 2003) (quoting Delgado v. Lewis,\n223 F.3d 976, 982 (9th Cir. 2000)); see also Greene v. Lambert, 288 F.3d\n1081, 1089 (9th Cir. 2002).\n\f                       PINHOLSTER v.

Mayle, 391 F.3d 989,\n996 (9th Cir. 2004).\n\n   A decision is “contrary to” federal law when the state court\napplies a rule of law that contradicts the governing law set\nforth in Supreme Court precedent or when the state court\nmakes a determination contrary to a Supreme Court decision\non materially indistinguishable facts. Williams v. Taylor, 529\nU.S. 362, 405-06 (2000). A state court unreasonably applies\nfederal law when its application of Supreme Court precedent\nto the facts of petitioner’s case is objectively unreasonable. Id.\nat 409.\n\n                                III\n\n   We first address Pinholster’s appeal of the district court’s\ngrant of summary judgment in favor of the State on his claims\nof ineffective assistance of counsel during the guilt phase of\nhis trial. Pinholster seeks an evidentiary hearing, arguing that\nhe has provided a colorable claim that his counsel performed\ndeficiently. His primary contention is that his counsel failed\nto adequately investigate the State’s physical evidence placing\nhim at the scene during the murders and this resulted in an\nuninformed decision to have Pinholster testify in his own\ndefense. See United States v. Curtis, 742 F.2d 1070, 1076 (7th\nCir. 1984) (per curiam) (“When a defendant asserts that he\ndesires to exercise his constitutional right to testify truthfully,\ncounsel’s duty is to inform the defendant why he believes this\ncourse will be unwise or dangerous.”).\n\n   At the time the California Supreme Court rendered its last\ndecision—October 1, 1997—the Supreme Court’s two-part\nstandard for analyzing ineffective assistance of counsel was\nclearly established law. See Strickland v. Washington, 466\nU.S. 668, 687 (1984). To establish a Sixth Amendment viola-\ntion, Pinholster had to show that: (1) his counsel’s perfor-\nmance was deficient, i.e., it fell below an objective standard\nof reasonableness, and (2) the deficient performance preju-\n\f4750                      PINHOLSTER v. AYERS\ndiced him. Id. In reviewing counsel’s performance, we “must\nbe highly deferential” and should make every effort “to elimi-\nnate the distorting effects of hindsight.” Id. at 689. Even if we\nconclude that counsel performed deficiently, to obtain relief\nthe “defendant must show that there is a reasonable probabil-\nity that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of\nthe proceeding would have been different. A reasonable prob-\nability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in\nthe outcome.” Id. at 694.\n\n                                     A\n\n   [1] To satisfy the first prong of Strickland, Pinholster must\n“identify[ ] the acts or omissions ‘that are alleged not to have\nbeen the result of reasonable professional judgment.’ ” Earp\nv. Ornoski, 431 F.3d 1158, 1173-74 (9th Cir. 2005) (quoting\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 690). The State offered during its case-\nin-chief the following pieces of physical evidence to corrobo-\nrate Corona’s testimony and place Pinholster at the scene of\nthe crime at the time of the murders: (1) investigators found\ndried blood on the bottom of the boots taken from Pinholster’s\ncloset and the sole print matched a bloody boot print near the\nvictims’ bodies; and (2) investigators found a palm print\nmatching Pinholster’s print located within the Kumar resi-\ndence.12 Pinholster contends that trial counsel’s failure to\ninvestigate this evidence constituted deficient performance,\nleading to an ill-advised decision to have Pinholster testify in\nhis own defense, during which he admitted to several incrimi-\nnating facts.\n  12\n    Pinholster requests that we take judicial notice of the following docu-\nments to support his assertion that the State unlawfully destroyed all of the\nphysical evidence after trial: (1) an excerpt of the Master Index with a list\nof the State’s physical evidence; (2) a certificate from the Los Angeles\nCounty Superior Court ordering the exhibits listed on the “non-valuable\nexhibit” list destroyed; and (3) the “non-valuable exhibit” list. We deny\nhis request as these documents are not relevant to the resolution of this\nappeal. See Santa Monica Food Not Bombs v. City of Santa Monica, 450\nF.3d 1022, 1025 n.2 (9th Cir. 2006).\n\f                      PINHOLSTER v. AYERS                  4751\n                               1\n\n   Assuming trial counsel’s failure to investigate the physical\nevidence fell below the objective standard of reasonableness,\nwe nevertheless conclude that the district court properly\ngranted the State’s motion for summary judgment because\nPinholster failed to raise a colorable claim that the deficient\nperformance prejudiced him. See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 697\n(stating that a court may presume ineffective assistance to dis-\npose of a claim on prejudice grounds).\n\n   At the homicide scene, the police detectives discovered\nboot prints left in blood near the victims’ bodies. When exe-\ncuting the search warrant for Pinholster’s apartment, homicide\ndetectives found a pair of black boots that appeared to have\ntread marks that were similar to the prints left at the scene.\nTesting revealed microscopic stains on the boots that gave\npositive reactions for blood. Specifically, investigators\ndetected blood in all of the crevices of the right boot. Crimi-\nnalist Steven Schliebe also testified that the treads on the\nboots taken from Pinholster’s apartment were consistent with\nthe treads that left the boot prints at the crime scene.\n\n   During cross-examination of Detective Coffey—the detec-\ntive who discovered the boots in Pinholster’s apartment—\nPinholster’s counsel asked whether the boots had a common\ntread. The detective responded, “I’m not a boot expert, but I\nhad not seen this type of tread on boots. I have seen other\ntypes of tread. Not to say it’s not common or uncommon. To\nme, I have not seen that type of tread before.” In his habeas\npetition, however, Pinholster offered a declaration from\nCriminalist Schliebe that stated otherwise: Schliebe declared\nthat, “had he been asked if the sole pattern [of Pinholster’s\nboots and the boot prints found at the crime scene were] com-\nmon in the Southern California area,” he would have\nanswered, “the shoe sole pattern is fairly common and is fre-\nquently found on work and sport boots.”\n\f4752                  PINHOLSTER v. AYERS\n   The district court denied Pinholster’s claim of ineffective\nassistance of counsel for lack of prejudice. It reasoned that\n“the boot that was found in [Pinholster’s] home had a trace of\nblood on it[,] which distinguishes it from other boots with the\nsame tread.” The district court also denied Pinholster’s claim\nthat trial counsel were ineffective for eliciting Detective Cof-\nfey’s opinion that the boot print was uncommon. It reasoned\nthat Detective Coffey “never testified that the boot print was\nuncommon”; rather, he “stated that he had not seen the sole\npattern before” and “clarified that he was not a boot print\nexpert.”\n\n   The second piece of physical evidence was a palm print\nlifted from a closet door frame in the Kumar residence that\nmatched a palm print later taken from Pinholster. During\ndirect examination, the fingerprint expert testified that he con-\nducted two prior identification attempts before he was able to\nconclusively determine that the print lifted from the door\nmatched Pinholster’s. The expert explained that the palm print\nlifted from the closet door came from the far outside portion\nof the left palm. In the two prior attempts, the lab used exem-\nplar cards that excluded the outside portion of the palm. Nor-\nmally, when a person is palm printed, the palm is laid flat on\nthe exemplar card. Therefore, as the expert testified, “it was\nnot until [Detective] Coffey provided [his] office with this\nexemplar card with the palm prints, and also a roll of the far\nleft-hand side, that [he was] able to find the area that matched\nup with the print that [he] lifted from the door frame.”\n\n   Pinholster argues that his trial counsel were ineffective for\nfailing to independently test the palm print. In support of his\nargument, Pinholster offered a declaration of an independent\nfingerprint expert, Clarence Collins. After examining both the\nlifted print and the rolled palm print taken from Pinholster,\nCollins concluded that the prints “were not made by the same\nperson.” In addition, Pinholster offers a declaration taken\nfrom Brainard stating that, “[h]ad I known Scott Pinholster\ndid not deposit the latent print found at the Kumar residence,\n\f                           PINHOLSTER v. AYERS                             4753\nI would have conducted the defense differently, and would\nhave appropriately changed my advice to my client. I proba-\nbly would have advised Scott Pinholster not to testify during\n[the] guilt phase.”\n\n   The district court denied Pinholster’s request for an eviden-\ntiary hearing on the basis that he again failed to show preju-\ndice. First, Pinholster admitted that he was inside Kumar’s\nresidence on the night of the murders. Second, Pinholster’s\ntrial counsel merely stated that he probably would have\nadvised Pinholster not to testify.13 This does not necessarily\nshow that Pinholster’s admission would not otherwise have\nbeen made. The record is quite clear that Pinholster was eager\nto take the stand so he could convince the jury that, although\nhe saw himself as a professional thief who preyed on drug\ndealers, his modus operandi was to carry a gun, not to stab his\nvictims with knives.\n\n   [2] We agree with the district court and hold that Pinholster\nfailed to show a colorable claim that he was prejudiced by\ntrial counsel’s alleged failure to independently investigate the\nState’s physical evidence. Despite Pinholster’s contention,\nCollins’s declaration does not prove that the State’s finger-\nprint expert was lying or misinformed. At most, it creates a\nbattle of the experts.14 Moreover, the jury heard the State’s\n  13\n      We are not holding, nor do we think the district court found, that Pin-\nholster’s counsel’s statement that he “probably” would not have advised\nPinholster to testify is sufficient to establish that counsel’s failure to inves-\ntigate was non-prejudicial. See Dissent Op. at 4785 n.2. Indeed, Pinholster\nuses counsel’s declaration to argue that he was prejudiced. Pinholster\nargues that had his trial counsel investigated the palm print he would have\nknown there was a discrepancy and therefore never would have advised\nPinholster to testify. Pinholster argues that without his testimony there was\nno evidence that he was in Kumar’s residence at the time of the murders\nand therefore counsel’s failure to investigate was prejudicial. As we dis-\ncuss infra these arguments are simply unpersuasive as there was a wealth\nof other evidence proving Pinholster’s presence in the Kumar residence.\n   14\n      Contrary to the dissent’s assertion, we are not saying that the existence\nof a “battle of the experts” reduces any prejudice resulting from counsel’s\n\f4754                      PINHOLSTER v. AYERS\nfingerprint expert testify that he could not match Pinholster’s\nprint until the third attempt. Although Pinholster argues that\nthe “State’s expert was pressured to find a match,” no evi-\ndence supports such a contention. In addition, the State pre-\nsented the palm print evidence to place Pinholster in the\nKumar residence at the time of the murders. This evidence\nwas cumulative as Corona testified that Pinholster was in the\nKumar residence at the time of the murders, and substantial\nportions of Corona’s testimony were corroborated by Lisa\nTapar, her father, and Casey Corona. Pinholster’s admission\nto the jury that he was inside Kumar’s house at some point\nthat night further convinces us that the alleged ineffectiveness\ndid not prejudice him. Therefore, we hold that the jury’s ver-\ndict would not have been affected even if Pinholster’s trial\ncounsel had conducted an independent investigation and\nintroduced evidence that the palm print was not Pinholster’s.\n\n   [3] Pinholster also failed to show a colorable claim that he\nwas prejudiced by trial counsel’s failure to investigate the\nboot prints. The State did not argue that this evidence con-\nnected Pinholster to the crime because the sole prints were\nunique; rather, the state argued that this evidence connected\nPinholster to the crime scene because (1) the sole prints were\nconsistent, and (2) Pinholster’s boots were found to have\ntraces of human blood on the bottom. Therefore, even if the\njury heard evidence that the sole prints were common in\nSouthern California, this would not have changed the verdict.\nPinholster offers no other evidence to suggest that the boot\nprint evidence was faulty.\n\n                                     2\n\n  Because we conclude that Pinholster failed to raise a color-\nable claim that he was prejudiced by trial counsel’s failure to\n\nfailure to investigate the palm print. See Dissent at 4785 n.2. We are sim-\nply saying that Collins’s declaration creates only a battle of the experts;\nit does not prove Pinholster’s contention that the State’s expert was misin-\nformed, improperly influenced, or lying.\n\f                      PINHOLSTER v. AYERS                   4755\ninvestigate the State’s physical evidence, we cannot conclude\nthat trial counsel’s decision to advise Pinholster to testify in\nhis own defense amounted to ineffective assistance. The dis-\nsent is ensnared in the trap of 20/20 hindsight. It fails to give\na sufficient level of deference to counsel’s judgments given\nthe evidence and the type of defense Pinholster wanted to pur-\nsue. See Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U.S. 374, 381 (2005) (“In\njudging the defense’s investigation, as in applying Strickland\ngenerally, hindsight is discounted by pegging adequacy to\ncounsel’s perspective at the time investigative decisions are\nmade and by giving a heavy measure of deference to coun-\nsel’s judgments.” (internal quotation marks and citation omit-\nted)).\n\n   “An accused’s right to testify is a constitutional right of\nfundamental dimension.” United States v. Joelson, 7 F.3d\n174, 177 (9th Cir. 1993). When reviewing ineffective assis-\ntance of counsel claims that question the attorney’s trial strat-\negy, it is important to “note that a defendant’s Sixth\nAmendment rights are his alone, and that trial counsel, while\nheld to a standard of ‘reasonable effectiveness,’ is still only\nan assistant to the defendant and not the master of the\ndefense.” Mulligan v. Kemp, 771 F.2d 1436, 1441 (11th Cir.\n1985). The reasonableness of counsel’s chosen trial strategy\ndepends critically “on informed strategic choices made by the\ndefendant and on information supplied by the defendant.”\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 691. The record amply demonstrates\nthat this strategic tactical decision was deliberate and consid-\nered. Pinholster actively participated in all key decisions, as\nhe represented himself pro se at one point before the trial, and\nstrongly directed the strategy he wished counsel to pursue.\n\n   The record shows that Pinholster directed his trial counsel\nto pursue an alibi defense on his behalf. On June 24, 1983, the\ntrial court held a hearing on a motion to dismiss filed by Pin-\nholster while representing himself. Pinholster argued that his\nfirst appointed trial counsel, Marvin Part, coerced him into\nwaiving his right to a speedy trial. During the hearing, Pinhol-\n\f4756                     PINHOLSTER v. AYERS\nster called Part to testify, waiving his attorney-client privilege.\nPinholster questioned why Part refused to interview possible\nalibi witnesses in the face of physical evidence linking Pin-\nholster to the crime scene. Pinholster’s insistent decision to\npursue an alibi defense necessarily impacted his counsel’s\ntrial strategy.15\n\n   Even without the physical evidence, the State presented\noverwhelming evidence that Pinholster was at the Kumar resi-\ndence on the day of the murders. Corona’s testimony not only\nplaced Pinholster at the scene during the murders, but it also\ndetailed Pinholster’s participation in the murders. Several\nother witnesses corroborated Corona’s testimony.\n\n   [4] In light of the evidence placing Pinholster at the scene,\nPinholster’s failure to show prejudice from his trial counsel’s\nfailure to investigate the physical evidence, and Pinholster’s\nstrong desire to pursue an alibi defense, we cannot second\nguess trial counsel’s decision to advise Pinholster to testify.16\nIn Strickland, the Court recognized that “[c]ounsel’s actions\nare usually based . . . on informed strategic choices made by\nthe defendant and on information supplied by the defendant.”\n466 U.S. at 691. To support Pinholster’s alibi defense, trial\ncounsel needed to explain the overwhelming evidence prov-\n  15\n    Brainard declared:\n      The strategy decided upon prior to trial was to demonstrate Scott\n      committed robberies and not burglaries, and that Scott used guns,\n      not knives, as weapons. I assumed Scott would admit to having\n      committed a few robberies, not hundreds, although we never\n      explicitly discussed the number. Part of [the] strategy decided\n      upon prior to trial was to admit the Croutch robbery during trial.\n   16\n      The dissent assumes that trial counsel never advised “Pinholster\nagainst testifying, because the jury would likely conclude he was lying.”\nSee Dissent at 4786. There is a dearth of evidence in the record detailing\nany discussion between trial counsel and Pinholster about his decision to\ntestify during the guilt phase. Pinholster does not allege, and there is no\nevidence to support, the dissent’s assumption that trial counsel neglected\nto discuss the risks of testifying with their client.\n\f                          PINHOLSTER v. AYERS                          4757\ning that Pinholster intended to rob the Kumar residence on the\nnight of the murders. In other words, counsel needed Pinhol-\nster to tell his version of the events—that he was a robber, not\na burglar, and that he used guns, not knives. Given the evi-\ndence presented by the State, trial counsel’s tactical decision\nto advise Pinholster to testify was reasonable. See id. Such a\ndecision does not amount to constitutionally deficient perfor-\nmance. To declare that it was wrong because in hindsight it\nproved unsuccessful and must have been uninformed is not\nwhat the Supreme Court intended when we analyze a Strick-\nland claim after the fact.\n\n                                     B\n\n   We also conclude that Pinholster has failed to present a col-\norable claim that he was prejudiced by the other alleged\ninstances of ineffective assistance of counsel during the guilt\nphase of his trial.\n\n                                     1\n\n   One alleged instance concerned Art Corona’s police inter-\nview. Through stipulation of counsel, the State introduced the\nunredacted tape recording and transcription of Corona’s\npolice interview. During the interview, Corona claimed that\nPinholster admitted involvement in the shooting of two “wet-\nbacks,” that he had beaten an elderly woman, was involved in\na cocaine “rip-off,” sold drugs, committed robberies, and had\naffiliated with white supremacist prison gangs.17\n\n   The California Supreme Court rejected Pinholster’s ineffec-\ntive assistance of counsel claim, concluding that trial counsel\nhad a “rational tactical reason” for deciding not to object to\nadmission of the entire interview. Pinholster, 824 P.2d at 604.18\n  17\n     Trial counsel did not object to replaying the tape during deliberations,\nor allowing the jury to keep the transcript while deliberating.\n  18\n     Unlike Pinholster’s other ineffective assistance of counsel claims, the\nCalifornia Supreme Court reached the merits of this claim in the direct\nappeal. It therefore constitutes the “last reasoned decision” of the state\ncourt. See Shackleford, 234 F.3d at 1079 n.2.\n\f4758                  PINHOLSTER v. AYERS\nThe court reasoned that “[Pinholster] needed to create an\nimpression of candor to carry his testimony that he had bro-\nken into the Kumar house on the night of the murder[s], but\nhad stolen the drugs and left before Corona arrived and\nstabbed the murder victims.” Id. Pinholster himself testified\nabout his violent criminal past and the references that Corona\nmade to specific instances “simply confirmed what [Pinhol-\nster] was willing to say about himself.” Id.\n\n   The California Supreme Court called Corona’s reference to\nthe Aryan Brotherhood “clearly innocuous,” as Corona testi-\nfied that it was Brown who was affiliated with the group, not\nPinholster. Id. Moreover, the interview could reasonably be\nseen as favorable to Pinholster’s defense. “[T]he tape con-\ntained statements inconsistent with Corona’s trial testimony,\nshowed Corona’s eagerness to cooperate with the police, and\ncontained some reference to Corona’s contact with one\n‘Butch,’ who [Pinholster] claimed was Corona’s actual\naccomplice.” Id. The district court denied Pinholster’s motion\nfor an evidentiary hearing because certain aspects of the tape\nwere “beneficial to Pinholster’s case” and therefore trial coun-\nsel “arguably were not deficient for failing to object to it.”\nThe district court concluded that admitting the tape was not\nprejudicial because the case against Pinholster was strong and\nthe prosecution successfully discredited his defense.\n\n   [5] Whether counsel’s actions constituted a “tactical” deci-\nsion is a question of fact, and we must decide whether the\nstate court made an unreasonable determination of the facts in\nlight of the evidence before it. See Edwards v. Lamarque, 475\nF.3d 1121, 1126 (9th Cir. 2007) (en banc) (citing Taylor v.\nMaddox, 366 F.3d 992, 999-1000 (9th Cir. 2004)). For the\nreasons expressed by the district court, we hold that the Cali-\nfornia Supreme Court’s conclusion that counsel made a tacti-\ncal decision to admit the entire tape was not an unreasonable\ndetermination of fact. Accordingly, the court’s conclusion that\ncounsel made a reasonable decision was not objectively\n\f                      PINHOLSTER v. AYERS                  4759\nunreasonable. See id. (stating that the “reasonableness of\ncounsel’s decision is best described as a question of law”).\n\n                               2\n\n   Pinholster also claims his counsel were ineffective in fail-\ning to object to Detective Coffey’s testimony. Detective Cof-\nfey testified that Terry Pinholster, Pinholster’s brother, said\nScott Pinholster’s arrest was “no big deal” because his brother\nhad been arrested for murder before. Pinholster argues that\nbecause he had never before been arrested or charged with\nmurder, his trial counsel had no tactical basis for failing to\nobject to this statement. The district court granted summary\njudgment to the State on this issue, concluding that Pinholster\nhad failed to show prejudice as the jury had “already heard\nthat [Pinholster] was involved in a shoot-out in which two\n‘wetbacks’ had been killed. The jury could easily have sur-\nmised that [Pinholster] was arrested for murder as a result of\nthat incident.”\n\n   [6] Trial counsel’s failure to object to this evidence raises\nconcerns: The portion of the Corona tape discussing the “wet-\nback” murders and the hearsay statement of Pinholster’s\nbrother undermine the heart of Pinholster’s defense—that he\nis a robber not a murderer. Nevertheless, because the Califor-\nnia Supreme Court’s decision regarding the Corona tape was\nobjectively reasonable, it cannot be said that Pinholster suf-\nfered prejudice from admission of his brother’s statement. As\nthe district court reasoned, it is likely the jury put the two\ntogether, making his brother’s statement no more prejudicial\nthan admission of the “wetback” statement.\n\n                               3\n\n  Pinholster contends that his trial counsel were ineffective\nby admitting into evidence a prior felony conviction for kid-\nnaping after the trial court granted a motion in limine to pro-\nhibit the State from using the evidence on cross-examination.\n\f4760                        PINHOLSTER v. AYERS\nIn a declaration filed with Pinholster’s state and federal\nhabeas petitions, Brainard admitted that he “d[id] not recall\nwhy [he] elicited Scott Pinholster’s kidnapping conviction\nafter the court ruled that this conviction was inadmissible for\nimpeachment purposes.”\n\n   Brainard’s question opened the door for the prosecution to\nquestion Pinholster about prior offenses in which he used a\nknife rather than a gun. The trial court—without objection\nfrom Pinholster’s attorneys—allowed the State to recall Pin-\nholster to the stand and question him as to whether he used\na knife during the course of the kidnaping. Pinholster testified\nthat he pled guilty to using a knife but denied actually having\nused the knife during the commission of the offense.\nAlthough use of a knife is alleged in the criminal information,\nit was not a term of the plea agreement.19 Brainard filed a dec-\nlaration stating that he could “not recall whether [he] knew\nthe knife enhancement allegation was not found true.”\n\n   [7] We hold that Pinholster has failed to show a colorable\nclaim that he was prejudiced by his trial counsel’s allegedly\ndeficient performance. The jury heard other evidence that Pin-\nholster possessed knives, including his own admission that he\nused a buck knife to vandalize Lisa Tapar’s car on the night\nof the murders. The district court properly denied Pinholster\nan evidentiary hearing on this ineffective assistance of coun-\nsel claim.\n  19\n    The colloquy during the change of plea hearing went as follows:\n       The court: Mr. Pinholster, Count I of the information charges\n                   that on August 21st of last year you kidnapped a\n                   person named Jena, J-e-n-a, Rae, R-a-e, Burdett, B-\n                   u-r-d-e-t-t; that is, that you forcefully took her from\n                   one place to another. Do you understand that\n                   charge?\n       Pinholster: Yes, sir.\n       The court: Is that what you did?\n       Pinholster: Yes, sir.\n\f                     PINHOLSTER v. AYERS                  4761\n                              4\n\n   Charles Kempf testified that during an aborted robbery\nattempt at Kumar’s residence Pinholster bragged about stab-\nbing an unidentified individual in the rectum. Pinholster con-\ntends that his trial counsel were ineffective for failing to\nobject to Kempf’s statement and failing to impeach Kempf\nwith a prior statement in which he claims that Pinholster’s\nfriend did the stabbing.\n\n   [8] Pinholster cannot make out a colorable claim that he\nwas prejudiced by the admission of this evidence. During his\nown testimony, which was dramatic and unusual in the candor\nPinholster displayed in bragging about his life of crime, Pin-\nholster admitted to several violent acts and the evidence pres-\nented against him was overwhelming. The California\nSupreme Court so found, see Pinholster, 824 P.2d at 601,\n604, and we cannot say that the district court erred by failing\nto grant an evidentiary hearing.\n\n                              5\n\n   During rebuttal, Eric Klemetti testified that he purchased\nmarijuana from Johnson at the Kumar residence around 9\np.m. on the night of the murders. To impeach his credibility,\nPinholster’s trial counsel asked Klemetti whether he had ever\ncommitted a burglary with Pinholster, and whether he had\nacted as an informant during that case. Pinholster argues that\nthis amounted to ineffective assistance because the conviction\nundercut his testimony that he committed robberies rather\nthan burglaries and was otherwise inadmissible.\n\n   [9] We agree with the district court. Trial counsel made a\nrational tactical decision to impeach Klemetti’s testimony\nwith this evidence as the witness would have otherwise gone\nunchallenged. Moreover, Pinholster failed to show prejudice\nbecause he had already admitted that he burglarized Kumar’s\nresidence on the night of the murders.\n\f4762                  PINHOLSTER v. AYERS\n                               6\n\n   Pinholster challenges his trial counsel’s decision to admit\nevidence that the police had recovered narcotics during the\nsearch of his apartment. He also claims ineffective assistance\ndue to his trial counsel’s failure to exclude evidence that he\nhad thrown a gun from the window of a different apartment\nwhile the police executed a search warrant on his apartment.\nAlthough his trial counsel challenged the officers’ identifica-\ntion of Pinholster, Pinholster admitted during cross-\nexamination that he threw the gun.\n\n   [10] The district court concluded that (1) Pinholster failed\nto show prejudice, as he admitted to using drugs and possess-\ning guns in his testimony; (2) that even without Pinholster’s\ntestimony, the narcotics evidence was not prejudicial, as the\njury heard from other sources, including Corona, that Pinhol-\nster used drugs; and (3) that though trial counsel attempted to\nchallenge the officers’ identification of Pinholster as the man\nwho threw the gun, it is reasonable to believe that the jury\nfound the officers’ testimony credible. We agree and hold that\nthe district court properly denied Pinholster’s request for an\nevidentiary hearing.\n\n                               7\n\n   Pinholster argues that trial counsel were ineffective for ask-\ning prospective jurors questions about white supremacist\ngangs such as the Aryan Brotherhood. The district court con-\ncluded that trial counsel were not deficient because they knew\nthe Corona tape contained references to the Aryan Brother-\nhood, and they made a tactical decision to forewarn the jurors\nthat the subject might arise. On appeal, Pinholster argues that\ntrial counsel were ineffective for failing to object when the\nprosecution returned to this theme throughout the guilt phase\nof the trial.\n\n   [11] Pinholster has again failed to make a colorable claim\nthat he was prejudiced by the alleged deficient performance.\n\f                          PINHOLSTER v. AYERS                         4763\nGiven the strong evidence against Pinholster, it is not reason-\nably probable that trial counsel’s failure to exclude all refer-\nences to Pinholster’s connection to white supremacists\naffected the verdict.\n\n                                    IV\n\n   We now turn to the State’s appeal. The State contends that\nthe district court improperly found, based on evidence not\nbefore the state court, that Pinholster’s trial counsel inade-\nquately investigated and deficiently presented mitigating evi-\ndence at the penalty phase. We hold that Pinholster properly\nexhausted his ineffective assistance of counsel claim, and that\nany error the district court may have committed in holding an\nevidentiary hearing is harmless because, even with the evi-\ndence presented at the hearing, Pinholster has not shown that\nhe was prejudiced by counsel’s failure to offer additional mit-\nigating evidence.20\n\n                                    A\n\n   A state prisoner must exhaust all available remedies in state\ncourt before a federal court may grant him habeas relief. 28\nU.S.C. § 2254(b)(1)(A); O’Sullivan v. Boerckel, 526 U.S.\n838, 842 (1999). A state prisoner must describe the operative\nfacts and federal legal theory on which he grounds his claim\nso the state court has a “ ‘fair opportunity’ to apply control-\nling legal principles to the facts bearing upon his constitu-\ntional claim.” Anderson v. Harless, 459 U.S. 4, 6 (1982) (per\n  20\n    The State contends the district court abused its discretion by granting\nPinholster a federal evidentiary hearing. The State argues that the district\ncourt failed to consider whether Pinholster—given his shifting medical\nimpairment theories and new lay witness declarations—properly devel-\noped a factual basis for his claim in state court. See Baja v. Ducharme,\n187 F.3d 1075, 1078 (9th Cir. 1999). The State waived this issue by fail-\ning to raise it in its opening brief. See United States v. Kama, 394 F.3d\n1236, 1238 (9th Cir. 2005). Moreover, as we discuss infra, any error was\nharmless.\n\f4764                  PINHOLSTER v. AYERS\ncuriam) (quoting Picard v. Connor, 404 U.S. 270, 276\n(1971)). Presenting additional facts to the district court does\nnot evade the exhaustion requirement when the prisoner pres-\nents the substance of his claim to the state courts. See Vasquez\nv. Hillery, 474 U.S. 254, 257-58, 260 (1986) (rejecting chal-\nlenge to new evidence because it did not fundamentally alter\nthe legal claim the state courts previously considered).\n\n   [12] We review de novo whether Pinholster failed to\nexhaust California remedies. See Castillo v. McFadden, 399\nF.3d 993, 998 (9th Cir. 2005). The California Supreme Court\nhad a sufficient opportunity to hear Pinholster’s claim of inef-\nfective assistance of counsel at the penalty phase. Throughout\nthe habeas proceedings, Pinholster has continued to press the\nsame legal claim (ineffective assistance at the penalty phase)\nand the same factual basis (e.g., counsel failed to present sig-\nnificant mitigating evidence and, instead, presented harmful,\nfalse evidence at the penalty phase). The federal and state\npetitions detail many identical facts. Both describe trial coun-\nsel’s failure to seek a continuance to prepare for the penalty\nphase; counsel’s introduction of Mrs. Brashear’s testimony;\nPinholster’s childhood home life; and Pinholster’s back-\nground, including his educational, medical, psychological,\nsocial, and family history. Pinholster did not, as the State con-\ntends, “present vague and conclusory constitutional claims in\nthe state court, phrased with sweeping generality and sup-\nported by skimpy factual allegations.”\n\n   [13] Though during the proceedings Pinholster relied on\ndifferent experts with differing mental impairment theories,\nthe evolving theories have not significantly changed the evi-\ndentiary basis for his arguments. These experts relied on the\nsame background information Pinholster presented to the state\ncourt, and their testimonies represent only a fragment of the\nmitigating evidence submitted in the state habeas proceedings.\nAccordingly, the facts adduced at the evidentiary hearing\nhave not fundamentally altered the legal claim the California\nSupreme Court already considered and rejected, and we con-\n\f                          PINHOLSTER v. AYERS                         4765\nclude that Pinholster has exhausted this claim. See Weaver v.\nThompson, 197 F.3d 359, 364 (9th Cir. 1999) (rejecting\nexhaustion argument as “unwarranted hairsplitting” where at\neach step the legal claim remained the same, but the precise\nfactual predicate for the claim changed after the evidentiary\nhearing).\n\n                                    B\n\n   Habeas relief is proper if the California Supreme Court’s\ndecision was either “contrary to, or involved an unreasonable\napplication of” Strickland.21 Williams, 529 U.S. at 391 (inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted). We need not determine whether\nPinholster’s trial counsel performed deficiently because we\nfind the prejudice inquiry dispositive. See Strickland, 466\nU.S. at 697 (“[T]here is no reason . . . to address both compo-\nnents of the inquiry if the defendant makes an insufficient\nshowing of one. In particular, a court need not determine\nwhether counsel’s performance was deficient before examin-\ning the prejudice suffered by the defendant as a result of the\nalleged deficiencies.”).\n\n  Pinholster bears the “heavy burden” of establishing actual\nprejudice. See Williams, 529 U.S. at 394 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). He must demonstrate that there is a reason-\nable probability the sentencer would have found death unwar-\nranted absent his counsel’s errors. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 695.\n“A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to under-\nmine confidence in the outcome. [I]t is insufficient to show\nonly that the errors had some conceivable effect on the out-\ncome of the proceeding, because virtually every act or omis-\n  21\n    Because the California Supreme Court summarily denied Pinholster’s\npenalty phase ineffective assistance of counsel claim, we have indepen-\ndently reviewed the record to ascertain whether the state court decision\nwas objectively unreasonable. See Himes, 336 F.3d at 853; Pirtle v. Mor-\ngan, 313 F.3d 1160, 1167 (9th Cir. 2002). Though unable to analyze the\nbasis for the state court’s decision, we still view the decision through the\n“objectively unreasonable” lens. See Delgado, 223 F.3d at 982.\n\f4766                      PINHOLSTER v. AYERS\nsion of counsel would meet that test.” Williams, 529 U.S. at\n394 (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 693-94 (citation omit-\nted)). In Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510 (2003), the Supreme\nCourt explained that we must reweigh the evidence in aggra-\nvation against the totality of available mitigating evidence to\nassess prejudice. Id. at 534. In so doing, “we evaluate the\ntotality of the evidence—‘both that adduced at trial, and the\nevidence adduced in the habeas proceeding[s].’ ” Id. at 536\n(emphasis omitted) (quoting Williams, 529 U.S. 397-98).22\n\n   The dissent relies heavily on the Supreme Court’s decisions\nin Williams, Wiggins,23 and Rompilla. However, as Justice\nO’Connor stated in her concurrence in Rompilla, we must\napply a “case-by-case approach to determining whether an\nattorney’s performance was unconstitutionally deficient under\nStrickland.” Rompilla, 545 U.S. at 393-94 (O’Connor, J., con-\ncurring). The Supreme Court has not gone so far as to say that\nan attorney’s failure to uncover a certain class of mitigating\nevidence automatically results in a showing of prejudice. See\nid. Therefore, we must conduct an independent review of the\nevidence presented, reweighing what the State produced in\nthe form of aggravating evidence against that which Pinhol-\nster produces in mitigation. Like the California Supreme\nCourt, we conclude that the potential mitigating evidence is\ninsufficient to outweigh the overwhelming aggravating evi-\n  22\n      Despite Chief Judge Kozinski’s misgivings, Rompilla v. Beard, 545\nU.S. 374 (2005), does not signal a change in the Supreme Court’s\napproach to analyzing the prejudice prong under Strickland. See Kozinski\nConcurrence at 4780. The Court’s decision not to address the aggravating\nevidence in Rompilla more likely resulted from its conclusion that peti-\ntioner was clearly prejudiced from his counsel’s ineffective assistance, see\n545 U.S. at 390 (“We think Rompilla has shown beyond any doubt that\ncounsel’s lapse was prejudicial; Pennsylvania, indeed, does not even con-\ntest the claim of prejudice”), rather than from an express desire to overrule\nprior precedent.\n   23\n      But even the dissent concedes that the aggravating evidence here is\nstronger than that in Wiggins because Wiggins, unlike Pinholster, did not\nhave a record of violent conduct. See Dissent at 4802.\n\f                         PINHOLSTER v. AYERS                        4767\ndence. We are heavily influenced by the damage Pinholster\ndid to himself when he took the stand in the guilt phase and\ntestified to an unrepentant life of violent crime.\n\n   [14] During the state and federal habeas proceedings, Pin-\nholster submitted evidence to the state court showing that he\nsuffered years of significant neglect and physical and emo-\ntional abuse as a child. Pinholster’s step-father, Bud Brashear,\nfrequently beat Pinholster with his fists, a belt, or anything\nelse available, including a two-by-four board. Moreover, Pin-\nholster presented evidence during the habeas proceedings that,\nbecause he resembled his biological father, he was severely\nbeaten by his grandparents.\n\n   Pinholster painted somewhat of a different picture during a\nJuly 16, 1991, interview with a defense investigator Sheryl\nDuvall, who at the time worked as an independent Criminal\nJustice Consultant. She was hired by an attorney named Leon-\nard Tauman to prepare a social history on Pinholster. As\nreflected in her interview notes, Pinholster discussed his\nsocial history, including his relationship with various family\nmembers.24 Pinholster rejected his mother’s claim that his\nstep-father “abused” him growing up. Although he admitted\nthat his step-father used a homemade paddle freely on him\nand his brothers, Pinholster claimed that they “benefitted”\nfrom the “discipline.” Pinholster’s primary complaint about\n   24\n      The district court refused to consider statements made in Duvall’s\ninterview notes on the basis that the notes constituted inadmissible hear-\nsay. However, the parties stipulated to the admission of these interview\nnotes during the evidentiary hearing; Pinholster’s habeas counsel made no\nobjection based on hearsay. See United States v. Foster, 711 F.2d 871, 877\n(9th Cir. 1983) (stating that, where there is no objection to hearsay evi-\ndence, “such evidence is to be given its natural probative effect as if it\nwere in law admissible” (internal quotation marks omitted)). Furthermore,\nthe Supreme Court has instructed us to “ ‘evaluate the totality of the\nevidence—both that adduced at trial, and the evidence adduced in the\nhabeas proceeding[s].’ ” Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 536 (quoting Williams, 529\nU.S. at 397-98)).\n\f4768                       PINHOLSTER v. AYERS\nhis step-father was that “he didn’t seem to want the kids\naround.”\n\n   Although Pinholster presented evidence of physical abuse\nfrom his maternal grandmother, Pinholster claimed that he\nand his maternal grandfather were very close. He spent sum-\nmers with his grandparents, working on their chicken farm.\nHe claimed that his “[grandfather] was affectionate with the\nboys. He made them work hard on the farm but he was quick\nto praise their efforts.” Pinholster’s grandfather made him feel\ngood about himself. When Duvall asked Pinholster whether\nhe believed his life would have been different had his grand-\nfather lived, Pinholster responded “definitely.” He claimed\nthat, after his first arrest, he would have been sent to live with\nhis grandparents. These sentiments were supported in a medi-\ncal report developed upon Pinholster’s release from the Cam-\narillo State Hospital in 1971 when Pinholster was eleven-\nyears-old. Pinholster was reported as being “very close” to his\nmaternal grandfather, with his grandfather’s death being an\n“emotional shock.”\n\n   During the interview with Duvall in 1991, Pinholster also\ndescribed his relationship with his mother, Mrs. Brashear. He\nclaimed that he always “felt very close to his mother,” and he\nhad nothing but praise for her. He stated that “[s]he’s always\nbeen supportive of all the kids. She’s always the first there\nand last to leave. She always had a hot dinner on the table.”\nAt the time of the interview, Pinholster remained in close con-\ntact with his mother.25\n  25\n    The dissent questions our consideration of Pinholster’s description of\nhis social history. See Dissent at 4794. We are not crediting Pinholster’s\ndescription of the events over that of other family members. We recognize\nthat Pinholster was likely beaten and abused by both his step-father and\nmaternal grandmother. While we in no way condone such treatment of any\nchild, our role in these inquiries is to try and assess the extent of the miti-\ngating evidence as it relates to the potential prejudice to Pinholster. In\ndoing so, Pinholster’s own perception of his childhood and its affect on\nhim is certainly relevant. We also find relevant the fact that Pinholster’s\npaternal grandfather provided some stability during Pinholster’s early\nchildhood.\n\f                      PINHOLSTER v. AYERS                  4769\n   [15] In addition, the jury did hear some mitigating evidence\nfrom Pinholster’s mother during her penalty phase testimony.\nWe recognize that Mrs. Brashear inaccurately portrayed her-\nself as a dedicated, caring mother, and, indeed, she failed to\npresent Pinholster’s troubled childhood and mental and emo-\ntional problems in the most compelling manner. Nonetheless,\nthe jury heard mitigating facts from her testimony. Mrs.\nBrashear described Pinholster’s strained relationship with his\nstep-father, conceding that Bud Brashear’s attempts to disci-\npline Pinholster sometimes rose to the level of abuse.\n\n   On cross-examination, she admitted that her daughter,\nTammy Brashear, was currently on probation, and that her\nother son, Alvin Pinholster, died after attempting to evade the\nauthorities. Mrs. Brashaer recounted an accident when she ran\nover Pinholster (who was a toddler) with her car, nearly tear-\ning off one of Pinholster’s ears and causing a shoulder injury\nthat required just over a week in the hospital. She also dis-\ncussed Pinholster’s second head injury resulting from another\ncar accident; a psychologist’s recommendation to commit\nPinholster to a mental hospital at age ten; his time in a class\nfor emotionally handicapped children; and his epilepsy, which\nshe believed resulted from a severe beating at age eighteen in\ncounty jail. The penalty phase verdict reflects the jury’s obvi-\nous rejection of such mitigating circumstances in light of all\nthat Pinholster had said and done as a recidivist and the bru-\ntality of these robbery/murders.\n\n   [16] It is unlikely Pinholster’s evidence of mental impair-\nment would have had a significant impact on the jury. As a\ntoddler, Pinholster was in two separate car accidents that\nallegedly resulted in head injuries, and throughout his child-\nhood and early adolescence, Pinholster displayed symptoms\nof and received treatment for epilepsy. Nevertheless, the\nexperts’ opinions about Pinholster’s psychological impair-\nments and whether these impairments resulted from a head\ninjury have varied considerably, becoming somewhat of a\n\f4770                      PINHOLSTER v. AYERS\nmoving target for the California Supreme Court and federal\ncourts on habeas review.\n\n   The California Supreme Court has denied two habeas peti-\ntions, one in which Pinholster relied on Dr. Woods as his\nexpert, and another in which he relied on Dr. Stalberg as his\nexpert. Dr. Woods opined that, during the murders, Pinholster\nwas substantially impaired by a bipolar mood disorder operat-\ning synergistically with a seizure disorder. Declining to pre-\nsent Dr. Woods’s diagnosis,26 Pinholster rehired Dr. Stalberg\nas his expert for the second state habeas petition. Dr. Stalberg\nstated that he had reviewed the materials presented by Pinhol-\nster’s habeas counsel and that, had he known of “Pinholster’s\nfamily history of severe psychiatric disorders, his disturbed\nbehavior during childhood, and his irrational and highly\naggressive actions immediately before the homicides,” he\nwould have “ma[de] further inquiry before concluding that\n[Pinholster] had merely a personality disorder.” He further\nstated that “[t]he new material” would have “materially modi-\nfied [his] opinion regarding mitigating circumstances.” After\nthe California Supreme Court again denied Pinholster’s\nhabeas petition, he appeared ready to proceed to federal court\nwith Dr. Stalberg as his expert.\n   26\n      None of the other experts agreed with Dr. Woods’s diagnosis of bipo-\nlar mood disorder. In his June 2001 declaration, Dr. Stalberg stated that\nPinholster “was substantially impaired by a bipolar mood disorder operat-\ning synergistically with intoxication and a seizure disorder at the time the\ncrime was committed.” However, during the evidentiary hearing, Dr. Stal-\nberg rejected that statement as his own testimony. He stated, “I never said\nthat and never testified to [Pinholster having bipolar mood disorder].”\nSubsequently, in August 2002, Dr. Stalberg filed another declaration in\nwhich he stated simply that Dr. Woods’s diagnosis of bipolar mood disor-\nder was “incorrect.” Dr. David Rudnick, a neuropsychiatrist who served\nas an expert for the State during the federal evidentiary hearing, stated in\nhis declaration of July 11, 2001, that “[t]here is no evidence for the diag-\nnosis of bipolar disorder at any time in Mr. Pinholster’s life.” Similarly,\nDr. Vinogradov stated that she found “no clear information supporting\ntrue full-blown hypomanic or depressive episodes.”\n\f                         PINHOLSTER v. AYERS                         4771\n   On June 5, 2001, Dr. Stalberg executed a more detailed\ndeclaration in which he stated that the penalty phase testi-\nmony of Mrs. Brashear was “profoundly misleading” as she\nfailed to truthfully describe Pinholster’s early childhood,\nwhich “was marked by significant deprivation, physical\nabuse, and extreme neglect.” Dr. Stalberg again acknowl-\nedged that Pinholster likely suffers from a seizure disorder,\nand went on to opine that some of the violent incidents in Pin-\nholster’s past—the breaking of his wife’s jaw and his assault\non Officer Kaufman—could have been attributed to his sei-\nzure disorder.\n\n   After Dr. Stalberg refused, despite all of the new mitigating\nevidence, to alter his diagnosis of Antisocial Personality Dis-\norder, Pinholster’s habeas counsel informed him that he\nwould no longer be serving as their expert. Instead, in support\nof his amended federal habeas petition, Pinholster choose to\nrely on the new expert testimony of Dr. Vinogradov and Dr.\nOlson. Dr. Olson concluded that “it is reasonably probable\nthat Mr. Pinholster has suffered from partial epilepsy since at\nleast 1968.” In support of his conclusion, Dr. Olson relied on\nthe two head injuries Pinholster suffered as a child, Pinhol-\nster’s abnormal EEG at age nine,27 the descriptions of Pinhol-\nster’s seizures provided by other witnesses, and Pinholster’s\ntreatment for seizures with standard anti-seizure medication.\n\n   Dr. Vinogradov relied on the same evidence as the other\nexperts and conducted two face-to-face interviews with Pin-\nholster. She implicitly rejected Dr. Woods’s diagnosis, stating\nthere was “no clear information supporting true full-blown\nhypomanic or depressive episodes.” However, she diagnosed\nPinholster with “personality change, aggressive type, due to\n  27\n    Dr. Rudnick testified that Pinholster’s abnormal EEG in 1968 could\nhave been caused by his Attention Deficient Hyperactivity Disorder, or by\nthe fact that he was only nine-years-old at the time. As Dr. Rudnick\ndescribed, maturation of the brain is “characterized by a reduction in slow\nwave activity of the same frequencies observed” in Pinholster.\n\f4772                      PINHOLSTER v. AYERS\nserious childhood head trauma.” She opined that, “[o]n the\nnight of the crimes, while intoxicated on multiple substances,\nMr. Pinholster experienced perceptual aberrations and possi-\nble psychotic symptoms.”\n\n   [17] The dissent believes that Pinholster has presented evi-\ndence of “substantial neurological and emotional disorders.”\nDissent at 4794. However, the only constant with regard to\nthe evolving defense expert testimony has been Dr. Stalberg’s\ndiagnosis of Antisocial Personality Disorder and the experts’\nagreement that it is reasonably probable that Pinholster suf-\nfered from epilepsy.28 The California Supreme Court has\nfaced a revolving door of experts, each presenting his or her\nown theory on Pinholster’s mental health. Although we have\nno pronounced reason to question the credibility of Pinhol-\nster’s new experts, we conclude that no newly-minted expert\ntheory to explain his behavior would have made a difference\nin the face of what Pinholster said and did.\n\n  Though the Supreme Court has recently highlighted\ndefense counsel’s constitutional duty to adequately investigate\nmitigating evidence, we cannot say from the record either\nbefore the state or federal district court that it was objectively\n   28\n      Dr. Rudnick agreed with Dr. Stalberg’s diagnosis and also noted in his\ndeclaration that John Geiger, M.D., a staff psychiatrist at San Quentin\nState Prison, diagnosed Pinholster with Antisocial Personality Disorder\nand concluded that his violent behavior was “approximately that of the\naverage condemned area inmate.” Charles E. Steinke, Ph.D., a staff psy-\nchologist at San Quentin, also agreed with Dr. Geiger’s diagnosis of Anti-\nsocial Personality Disorder. We have previously noted that a diagnosis of\nAntisocial Personality Disorder is “potentially more harmful to [a] peti-\ntioner than [helpful].” Gerlaugh v. Stewart, 129 F.3d 1027, 1035 (9th Cir.\n1997); see also Daniels v. Woodford, 428 F.3d 1181, 1204-05 (9th Cir.\n2005) (concluding that the jury “never heard any mitigating psychological\nexplanation for Daniels’s behavior” because trial counsel relied solely on\ntestimony suggesting that Daniel was a “sociopath”); Clabourne v. Lewis,\n64 F.3d 1373, 1384 (9th Cir. 1995) (stating that omitted mental health\nrecords were “hardly . . . helpful” as they indicated that the defendant had\n“an antisocial personality”).\n\f                      PINHOLSTER v. AYERS                   4773\nunreasonable for the California Supreme Court to deny relief.\nWhile trial counsel could have presented more detailed miti-\ngating evidence—in the form of Pinholster’s social history\nand mental health history—that evidence falls short when\ncompared to the mitigating evidence available in Williams,\nWiggins, and Rompilla, and the overwhelming evidence in\naggravation which Pinholster faced.\n\n   In Williams, had counsel performed effectively the jury\nwould have learned that Williams’s parents were imprisoned\nfor criminal neglect; Williams’s father repeatedly beat him;\nWilliams was borderline mentally retarded and had not\nadvanced beyond sixth grade; and, while in prison, Williams\nhelped crack a prison drug ring, he returned a prison guard’s\nmissing wallet, and prison officials testified that he was the\nleast likely to act violently out of all the inmates. 529 U.S. at\n395-96. As the Supreme Court emphasized, this mitigating\nevidence coupled with the evidence the jury did hear—that\n“Williams turned himself in, alerting police to a crime they\notherwise would never have discovered, express[ed] remorse\nfor his actions, and cooperat[ed] with the police after that”—\ncould have influenced the jury’s view of Williams’s moral\nculpability. Id. at 398. In Williams, the additional mitigating\nevidence tended to show that Williams’s “violent behavior\nwas a compulsive reaction rather than a product of cold-\nblooded premeditation.” Id. Pinholster, on the other hand,\npresented himself to the jury as a classic antisocial personality\nwho revels in his disobedience to the law and social mores.\n\n   In Wiggins, defense counsel failed to present evidence that\nWiggins’s mother was an alcoholic and abusive to Wiggins\nand his siblings, Wiggins entered foster care at age six, two\nfoster mothers physically abused him, his second foster father\nrepeatedly raped and molested him, he spent time homeless,\nand he was mentally retarded. 539 U.S. at 525, 535, 545. In\nfinding that Wiggins was prejudiced by his counsel’s ineffec-\ntive assistance at the penalty phase, the Supreme Court com-\npared Wiggins to Williams, noting that “Wiggins does not\n\f4774                      PINHOLSTER v. AYERS\nhave a record of violent conduct that could have been intro-\nduced by the State to offset this powerful mitigating narra-\ntive.” Id. at 537. Pinholster, in contrast, is the epitome of a\nrepeat offender who specializes in violent crimes.\n\n   In Rompilla, had defense counsel conducted a sufficient\ninvestigation into mitigating evidence, the jury would have\nlearned that Rompilla’s parents suffered from severe alcohol-\nism; Rompilla’s mother drank during her pregnancy, causing\nRompilla to develop fetal alcohol syndrom; Rompilla and his\nbrothers also developed serious drinking problems; Rompil-\nla’s father severely beat both Rompilla and his mother; Rom-\npilla’s mother and father fought violently, with one incident\nresulting in his mother stabbing his father; and that Rompilla\nsuffered a depraved childhood, during which he was locked\nin a mesh dog pen, isolated from other children, and slept in\nan attic with no heat. 545 U.S. at 391-92. In addition, counsel\nwould have found evidence suggesting that Rompilla suffered\nfrom schizophrenia and other mental disorders.\n\n   [18] In contrast to the petitioner in Wiggins, who had no\nprior convictions nor a record of violent conduct, cf. Wiggins,\n539 U.S. at 537, Pinholster’s violent past—a past Pinholster\nproudly boasted about to the jury—offsets the mitigating evi-\ndence. Pinholster bragged that he had committed hundreds of\narmed robberies within a three-year time period. In addition,\nhe admitted to a prior kidnaping, during which he held a knife\nto the victim’s throat. And, unlike the petitioner in Williams,\nPinholster neither expressed remorse over the murders of\nThomas Johnson and Robert Beckett, nor attempted to aid the\npolice in their investigation. Rather, Pinholster threatened to\nkill the State’s lead witness, Art Corona, and proudly\nrecounted his recusant behavior in front of the jury.29\n  29\n    During the penalty phase, the jury also heard evidence regarding the\nnumerous threats and assaults Pinholster inflicted on law enforcement, as\nwell as several disciplinary infractions while he was arrested and incarcer-\nated. For example, LAPD officers Kaufman and Guzman testified that\n\f                          PINHOLSTER v. AYERS                          4775\n   We recognize that, at first glance, Pinholster’s habeas peti-\ntion more closely resembles that of the petitioner in Rompilla.\nNevertheless, there are significant differences, and we must\nanalyze an attorney’s alleged ineffective assistance of counsel\non a case-by-case approach. See Rompilla, 545 U.S. at 393-\n94, 396 (O’Connor, J., concurring). California law provides\nthat, in determining the penalty, the jury shall consider, if rel-\nevant, “[t]he circumstances of the crime of which the defen-\ndant was convicted in the present proceeding and the\nexistence of any special circumstances.” Cal. Penal Code\n§ 190.3(a). Indeed, the trial court instructed the jury that “[i]n\ndetermining which penalty is to be imposed on the Defendant,\nyou shall consider all of the evidence which has been received\nduring any part of the trial of this case.” Here, the jury wit-\n\nPinholster kicked or attempted to kick them in the head while they tried\nto restrain him on different occasions. Los Angeles County Central Jail\nOperations Sergeant Thomas Piggott testified to some of the eleven disci-\nplinary incidents with Pinholster involving “overt violence or some chal-\nlenge to future recalcitrant type behavior.” Finally, the State presented the\ntestimony of Cathy Ann Smith. She testified that Pinholster broke her jaw\nwhile seemingly having an epileptic seizure. However, because trial coun-\nsel could have rebutted some of this aggravating evidence, we do not give\nit substantial weight in the reweighing of the aggravating and mitigating\nfactors. For example, former Los Angeles County Deputy Sheriff Dale\nPeroutka would have testified that Pinholster “eventually [ ] turned him-\nself around” such that Peroutka and other deputies recommended to reclas-\nsify Pinholster from administrative segregation to the general population.\nPeroutka no longer saw Pinholster as a danger to other deputies or\ninmates; he reached an agreement with Pinholster that he could join the\ngeneral population if he behaved and complied with the rules. Likewise,\ntrial counsel could have diminished the impact of a serious disciplinary\ninfraction admitted by stipulation. Allan Page Crowder, the corrections\nofficer Pinholster allegedly threatened to throw off a tier in state prison,\nwould have testified that had he been a more seasoned officer, he would\nnot have considered the 1978 verbal altercation worthy of a CDC 115\ndisciplinary report. Nevertheless, because we find other more substantial\naggravating evidence in the record, this newfound mitigating evidence\ndoes not change our ultimate conclusion that no reasonable juror would\nhave been persuaded to change his vote.\n\f4776                     PINHOLSTER v. AYERS\nnessed first-hand Pinholster’s lack of remorse. Cf. Schriro v.\nLandrigan, 127 S. Ct. 1933, 1944 (2007) (noting that the\n“postconviction court was well acquainted with Landrigan’s\nexceedingly violent past and had seen first hand his belliger-\nent behavior”); see also id. (“In his comments [to the sentenc-\ning judge], defendant not only failed to show remorse or offer\nmitigating evidence, but he flaunted his menancing behavior.”\n(internal quotation marks and first alteration omitted)). Justice\nMosk specifically emphasized that point in authoring the deci-\nsion for the California Supreme Court: “[Pinholster] himself\nmade his criminal disposition clear [to the jury.] In fact, he\ngloried in it.” Pinholster, 824 P.2d at 611.\n\n   [19] Pinholster viciously beat the two murder victims,\nrepeatedly stabbed them with a knife, and took their wallets\nfor a gain of $23 and a quarter-ounce of marijuana.30 Yet,\nunder oath, Pinholster denied murdering the victims and\nbragged about the successful hundred-plus robberies he had\npreviously committed. Pinholster called himself a “profes-\n   30\n      The dissent questions the heinousness of these murders, comparing\nthis factual scenario with those found in Belmontes v. Brown, 414 F.3d\n1094 (9th Cir. 2005), rev’d on other grounds, Ayers v. Belmontes, 127\nS. Ct. 469 (2006); Hovey v. Ayers, 458 F.3d 892 (9th Cir. 2006); and\nFields v. Brown, 431 F.3d 1186 (9th Cir. 2005). Dissent at 4797-99. How-\never, for the jury charged with the duty of weighing the mitigating and\naggravating factors in determining whether this defendant should receive\na life sentence or suffer death, these separate, unconnected murders are\nirrelevant. Unlike a trial judge who may try several murder cases, or an\nappellate court that may review several different murder convictions in\nthose states imposing a proportionality review on appeal in capital cases,\nthis is likely the first and only time these jury members will become so\nintimate with facts involving the taking of human lives. The jury does not\ncompare one murder to another, ranking the heinousness of the individual\ncrimes on some imaginary scale. California does not require a proportion-\nality review as do some other states in death penalty cases. Rather, as the\nSupreme Court has directed appellate courts to do, juries also consider the\nunderlying facts of a death penalty case on an individualized case-by-case\nbasis in weighing the aggravating and mitigating facts. Cal. Penal Code\n§ 190.3. We do not share our colleague’s view that this was not a particu-\nlarly heinous double homicide.\n\f                           PINHOLSTER v. AYERS                           4777\nsional robber,” and testified that he often wrote his name and\nscratched swastikas on other people’s property as a “sideline\nto robbery.”31 Moreover, the jury heard evidence that Pinhol-\nster was previously convicted for kidnaping, that he threat-\nened to kill the State’s lead witness, and that, in a jealous\nrage, Pinholster slashed the arm of Thomas Mesquita with a\nstraight razor.\n\n   Pinholster’s detailed account of his version of the events on\nthe night of the murders would obviously affect the jury’s\nview of Pinholster’s mental impairment evidence. And, the\njury also observed firsthand on the witness stand an individual\nwho failed to respect the gravitas of the multiple murder trial\nthrough his unrepentant attitude. In addition to taking pride in\nhis criminal background, Pinholster was openly disrespectful\nof the deputy prosecutor and ignored the seriousness of his\nunderlying murders. The record reflects that Pinholster was\neither laughing or smirking during numerous stages of the\ndeputy prosecutor’s cross-examination.\n\n   [20] We cannot ignore the fact that, even while hearing\nPinholster’s defense in the guilt phase of the trial, the jury was\nconsidering facts that were also relevant to appropriate pun-\nishment. See Cal. Penal Code § 190.3(a). In his testimony,\nPinholster portrayed himself as a career criminal who reveled\nin his antisocial persona. As Dr. Rudnick explained in his dec-\nlaration, “individuals with Antisocial Personality Disorder\nmay have an inflated and arrogant self-appraisal, behave in a\ncocky or self-assured manner, lack realistic concern about\ntheir problems and display a glib, superficial charm.”32 The\n  31\n      Dr. Rudnick stated that “[Pinholster’s] behavior at Lisa Tapar’s house\nwas a clear, angry reaction to having the door closed on him. After stab-\nbing the door, he performed the very deliberate, aggressive act of carving\nvarious Nazi symbols on Lisa’s car.” This analysis, along with Pinhol-\nster’s ability to give a detailed description of his actions during this event,\nwould not have been forgotten by the jury considering any of the newly\nproffered mitigating evidence.\n   32\n      As detailed above, Dr. Woods used Pinholster’s behavior at trial to\nsupport his diagnosis of bipolar mood disorder. Given that Pinholster\n\f4778                     PINHOLSTER v. AYERS\nCalifornia Supreme Court, which acknowledged the fact that\nPinholster “gloried” in his criminal history, could reasonably\nhave concluded that no amount of clever “after-the-fact”\nassessment by habeas defense psychiatrists would have con-\nvinced even a single juror to change his vote.\n\n                                   V\n\n   We affirm the district court’s denial of Pinholster’s request\nfor an evidentiary hearing on ineffective assistance of counsel\nat the guilt phase and remand for dismissal of the petition. We\nreverse the district court’s grant of habeas relief on his inef-\nfective assistance of counsel claim at the penalty phase.\n\n  AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part, VACATED, and\nREMANDED.\n\n\n\n\nchose not to rely on Dr. Woods’s diagnosis in his federal habeas petition,\nand that both Dr. Stalberg and Dr. Rudnick discredit this diagnosis, we\ncannot believe the jury would have given it much weight.\n\fPINHOLSTER v. AYERS            4779\n                      Volume 2 of 2\n\f4780                  PINHOLSTER v. AYERS\n\n\n\nKOZINSKI, Chief Judge, concurring:\n\n   I join Judge Tallman’s opinion in full, but I do have one\nmisgiving: I’m not sure whether Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U.S.\n374, 393 (2005), still allows us to “reweigh the evidence in\naggravation against the totality of available mitigating evi-\ndence,” Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510, 534 (2003), when\ncounsel fails to uncover mitigating evidence. After all, coun-\nsel failed to uncover mitigating evidence in Rompilla, and the\nSupreme Court didn’t seem to address the aggravating evi-\ndence in assessing prejudice. See Rompilla, 545 U.S. at 393.\nStill, I have a hard time believing that Rompilla overruled a\nrecent case like Wiggins without bothering to say so. See id.\n(quoting Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 538).\n\n   Rompilla devotes most of its analysis to describing coun-\nsel’s deficiencies, not to assessing the prejudice to petitioner.\nThe Court found that counsel were ineffective in Rompilla\nbecause they failed to adequately prepare for a penalty phase\nhearing where the prosecution focused on petitioner’s prior\nconviction, not because they failed to look for evidence of\nchildhood abuse. See Rompilla, 545 U.S. at 394-96\n(O’Connor, J., concurring). As Justice O’Connor’s linchpin\nconcurrence made clear, counsel’s “trial-preparation” there\nwas deficient because they failed to obtain petitioner’s prior\nconviction file in anticipation of a hearing where the prosecu-\ntion would focus on that conviction. Id. at 395. Had defense\ncounsel properly prepared for the hearing by obtaining that\nfile, they would have stumbled across a cache of valuable evi-\n\f                      PINHOLSTER v. AYERS                   4781\ndence of childhood abuse and mental defect. Id. at 390-91\n(majority opinion). I read Rompilla for the unremarkable\nproposition that counsel must take the steps a reasonable law-\nyer would take in preparing for a hearing, not that counsel are\nalways ineffective for failing to uncover childhood mitigating\nevidence.\n\n   I would therefore find (as an alternative ground for rever-\nsal) that petitioner’s counsel weren’t deficient, because they\nmade a rational decision to pursue what was essentially a\n“pity” mitigation case, rather than try to make out a case of\nmental defect. Counsel faced a difficult situation: During the\nguilt phase, petitioner portrayed himself as a career criminal\nand boasted that he had committed hundreds of robberies\nusing a gun. And petitioner admitted to breaking into Kumar’s\nhouse on the night of the murders. The jury had ample oppor-\ntunity to evaluate petitioner’s demeanor. Counsel may well\nhave felt that petitioner’s articulate and coherent testimony\nportrayed him as a clever liar, not as someone who is mentally\ndeficient. This conclusion would have been bolstered by Dr.\nStalberg, who evaluated petitioner’s mental state and found\nhim essentially normal. While Dr. Stalberg has since flipped\na couple of times in his conclusions, petitioner doesn’t rely on\nhim now, so we can’t say that Dr. Stalberg would ultimately\nhave come up with a helpful diagnosis, had petitioner’s law-\nyers only given him more facts. Petitioner’s new lawyers did\neventually manage to find psychiatrists willing to say he is\nmentally impaired, but trial counsel had no reason to believe\nthat they could swiftly find another doctor who would dis-\nagree with their own expert’s diagnosis.\n\n   Under these circumstances, it was reasonable for them to\neschew a mental defect defense and pursue another mitigation\nstrategy. Ultimately, they focused on petitioner’s mother, who\ntestified about his head injuries, his disruptive behavior in\nschool, a psychologist’s recommendation that she commit him\nto a mental hospital, his frequent stays at juvenile hall and his\nepilepsy. The dissent chastises trial counsel for making “no\n\f4782                  PINHOLSTER v. AYERS\ninvestigation into Pinholster’s background at all,” dissent at\n4790, but I don’t see why talking to a defendant’s mother\ndoesn’t count as an investigation into his background. The\ninvestigation may not have been as thorough as our dissenting\ncolleague would have preferred, but surely it’s wrong to say\nthat defense counsel conducted no investigation at all.\n\n   Petitioner’s mother was not the perfect mitigation witness,\nbut it’s not clear that petitioner had a perfect mitigation wit-\nness. Nor is perfection the standard; the question is whether,\napplying the broad deference due to counsel under Strickland\nv. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 690-91 (1984), and the even\nbroader deference due to the California Supreme Court under\nAEDPA, 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d), we can say that counsel’s deci-\nsion is wholly unreasonable. This was not a case like Rom-\npilla or Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 395 (2000), where\nreview of a single file would have yielded a treasure trove of\nmitigating evidence; finding all the evidence that petitioner’s\ncurrent lawyers have amassed after years of effort and expert-\nshopping was simply beyond the time and resources available\nto counsel at the time of trial.\n\n   Justice O’Connor’s concurrence in Rompilla reaffirmed the\n“longstanding case-by-case approach to determining whether\nan attorney’s performance was unconstitutionally deficient.”\nRompilla, 545 U.S. at 394 (O’Connor, J., concurring). Rom-\npilla involved a particular hearing regarding petitioner’s prior\nconviction, and because counsel failed to adequately prepare\nfor that hearing by obtaining petitioner’s prior conviction file,\ncounsel were unable to adequately rebut the prior conviction\nevidence. See id. at 394-96. This was a discrete, precisely\nidentifiable strategy—“a sure bet,” id. at 389 (majority\nopinion)—that no competent counsel could overlook or\nbypass. It is quite different from counsel’s debatable judg-\nment call here as to how best to present their mitigation case\n—after petitioner portrayed himself as a career criminal at the\nguilt phase and their mental expert found no basis for mitiga-\ntion. Under a “case-by-case approach,” id. at 394 (O’Connor,\n\f                     PINHOLSTER v. AYERS                  4783\nJ., concurring), I can’t say that counsel’s decision to focus\nsolely on petitioner’s mother was unreasonable in these diffi-\ncult circumstances. Nor was the state court unreasonable in\nfinding that petitioner’s constitutional rights were not vio-\nlated.\n\n\n\nFISHER, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\n   I respectfully dissent. This case is controlled by a trio of\nrecent Supreme Court decisions holding that petitioners’ Sixth\nAmendment rights were violated when their lawyers failed to\npresent available mitigating evidence during the penalty\nphases of their capital trials. See Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U.S.\n374 (2005); Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510 (2003); Williams\nv. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362 (2000). The majority’s attempts to\ndistinguish these cases are not persuasive. Pinholster’s coun-\nsel performed at least as deficiently as the lawyers in the\nCourt’s recent decisions; and Pinholster was prejudiced as a\nresult since the mitigating evidence that could have been\nintroduced on his behalf was at least as strong as that in Wil-\nliams, Wiggins and Rompilla, and the aggravating evidence\nagainst him was if anything weaker than that in Williams and\nRompilla. Binding Supreme Court precedent therefore com-\npels the conclusion that the state court’s summary denial of\nPinholster’s penalty phase ineffective assistance of counsel\n(IAC) claim was objectively unreasonable. I would therefore\nremand for the district court to issue a writ vacating Pinhol-\nster’s sentence, unless within a reasonable time set by the\ncourt the State conducts a new penalty phase trial or imposes\na lesser sentence consistent with law.\n\n                              I.\n\n  Before addressing the majority’s penalty phase analysis, I\npause to note my partial disagreement with its resolution of\nPinholster’s guilt phase IAC claim. I agree that the district\n\f4784                      PINHOLSTER v. AYERS\ncourt did not err in denying Pinholster’s request for an eviden-\ntiary hearing on that claim, but I would base that conclusion\nsolely on Pinholster’s failure to present a colorable claim of\nprejudice. I cannot agree with the majority’s conclusion that\ncounsel’s decision to advise Pinholster to testify was a reason-\nable tactical choice rather than deficient performance.1\n\n   Pinholster’s counsel advised him to testify to a defense that\nwas not only implausible and nonsensical, but also demon-\nstrably false. There was compelling evidence disproving\nalmost every facet of the defense’s case. First, contrary to Pin-\nholster’s claim that he was a gun-toting robber and not a\nknife-wielding burglar, several witnesses testified at trial that\nthey saw Pinholster carrying a large buck knife immediately\nbefore and after the murders. Pinholster himself admitted to\ncarrying a knife on the night of the murders, and a knife\nsheath was found in his pocket when he was arrested. Pinhol-\nster also testified, contrary to his claim that he was not a bur-\nglar, that he had burglarized Kumar’s home just hours before\nthe murders took place. In contrast, Corona testified that he\nand Pinholster went to Kumar’s house on the night of the\nmurders intending to rob Kumar, and that the intended rob-\nbery turned into a burglary only when they found Kumar’s\nhome unoccupied. Corona — the State’s lead witness — thus\ngave testimony that was more consistent with Pinholster’s\n   1\n     I also disagree with the majority’s conclusion that the California\nSupreme Court reasonably concluded that Pinholster’s counsel was effec-\ntive in failing to object to highly prejudicial evidence suggesting that Pin-\nholster murdered two other individuals in Sun Valley. That court’s\nconclusion was based entirely on the assumption that the evidence would\nassist Pinholster’s defense. However, Pinholster’s defense was irrational\nand should have never been put forth. The California Supreme Court also\nfailed to consider whether Pinholster could have received the same benefit\nin terms of “candor,” People v. Pinholster, 824 P.2d 571, 604 (Cal. 1992),\nby requesting redaction of the prior murder evidence from the Corona tape\nand allowing the remainder to be played. Finally, as the prosecution never\nproduced evidence that two Latino men were killed in a shootout in Sun\nValley, it appears that Corona’s prior murder comments were simply\nuntrue.\n\f                          PINHOLSTER v. AYERS                          4785\ndefense than even Pinholster’s own testimony. The second\npart of Pinholster’s alibi — that he was at Kumar’s residence\nbefore and not after his visit to Tapar’s house — was also dis-\nproved at trial. Contrary to Pinholster’s statement that he went\nto Tapar’s residence by himself in order to tell her about Shot-\ngun’s death, Tapar testified that she did not know Shotgun\nand that Pinholster arrived in Corona’s car and appeared\nintent on robbing Kumar. Even more damaging was Klemet-\nti’s testimony that he was at Kumar’s house at 9 p.m. and\nfound no signs of the burglary that Pinholster claimed to have\ncommitted at 8 p.m.\n\n   On its own, counsel’s chosen defense was misguided. But\nin light of counsel’s additional failure to investigate important\nphysical evidence, including the palm print and the boot print,\nit amounted to deficient performance.2 Although a defendant’s\nright to testify is his own and may not be overridden by coun-\nsel, counsel nonetheless has the responsibility to indepen-\ndently investigate and challenge a defendant’s implausible\nstory. See Phillips v. Woodford, 267 F.3d 966, 978-79 (9th\nCir. 2001) (stating that an attorney has an obligation to inves-\ntigate defendant’s “ ‘incredibly lame’ ” alibi and “ ‘confront\nthe petitioner with the difficulties of his story’ ” (quoting\nJohnson v. Baldwin, 114 F.3d 835, 838, 840 (9th Cir. 1997)).\n  2\n    The majority suggests that Pinholster suffered less prejudice from his\ncounsels’ failure to investigate the palm print, because counsel “merely\nstated that he probably” would have advised Pinholster not to testify had\nhe known of evidence that the palm print found at the crime scene did not\nmatch Pinholster’s palm. See Maj. Op. at 4753 & n.13. The question is not\nwhat Pinholster’s ineffective counsel would have done but rather what\neffective counsel would have done. Competent counsel would have cer-\ntainly advised Pinholster not to testify. Nor do I agree that the existence\nof only a “battle of the experts” with regard to the palm print evidence\nsomehow reduces the prejudice from counsel’s failure to investigate. See\nid. at 4754-55. Evidence that creates a “battle of the experts” is precisely\nthe type of evidence that gives rise to reasonable doubt, and thus will typi-\ncally support a finding of prejudice. In this case it is only because other\nevidence overwhelmingly shows Pinholster’s guilt that the new palm print\nevidence does not amount to prejudice.\n\f4786                     PINHOLSTER v. AYERS\nHere, an investigation would have revealed that Pinholster’s\nalibi was highly suspect, giving rise to counsel’s obligation to\nadvise Pinholster against testifying, because the jury would\nlikely conclude he was lying.3 See also id. at 979 (“ ‘The prej-\nudice from failing to investigate the alibi and confer more\nfully with petitioner is not avoided by the fact the petitioner\nmisinformed his attorney.’ ”) (quoting Johnson, 114 F.3d at\n840). At the very least, counsel’s shortcoming in this regard\nmakes out a colorable claim of deficient performance for pur-\nposes of obtaining an evidentiary hearing. See id. (noting that\nthe “colorable claim” standard is “far less onerous” than the\nstandard for granting the writ); see also Earp v. Ornoski, 431\nF.3d 1158, 1170 (9th Cir. 2005) (describing the “colorable\nclaim” standard as “a low bar”).\n\n   Nonetheless, I agree that Pinholster has failed to present a\ncolorable claim of prejudice. There was overwhelming evi-\ndence of Pinholster’s guilt, including: Art Corona’s eyewit-\nness testimony of the murders; Casey Corona’s testimony that\nshe saw Pinholster washing blood off his knife soon after the\nmurders while stating “[i]t had to be done the way it was\ndone”; Kempf’s testimony that Pinholster stated — while\nclutching his buck knife — that he wanted to rob Kumar “one\nway or the other”; Tapar’s testimony that Pinholster appeared\nat her door with a knife just before the murders and that she\nhad the impression that Pinholster intended to steal from\nKumar; and evidence that one Gian Norelli had heard Pinhol-\nster brag about stabbing two people in Tarzana, where Kumar\nlived. In light of this evidence, it is difficult to conceive of\nany reasonable juror not voting to convict absent a convincing\ndefense theory. Pinholster has failed to articulate such a\n  3\n   The majority’s insistence that Pinholster’s counsel were not ineffective\nbecause Pinholster was “eager to take the stand” is not illuminating. Maj.\nOp. at 4753. Counsels’ deficient failure to investigate Pinholster’s alibi\ndefense, which in turn rendered them unable to provide competent advice\nabout whether he should testify, made it impossible for Pinholster to make\nan informed decision as to whether he should exercise his constitutional\nright to do so.\n\f                      PINHOLSTER v. AYERS                   4787\ndefense theory. Cf. Phillips, 267 F.3d at 980-81 (gauging\nwhether there was a colorable claim of prejudice by compar-\ning the deficient defense presented at trial to a proposed alter-\nnative defense). For this reason alone, I would hold that the\ndistrict court appropriately denied Pinholster an evidentiary\nhearing on guilt phase ineffective assistance and, necessarily,\nthat the district court properly denied habeas relief with\nregard to guilt.\n\n   Notwithstanding that counsel’s deficiencies were not preju-\ndicial at the guilt phase, I would hold that they added consid-\nerably to the prejudice Pinholster suffered at the penalty\nphase. Counsel’s deficient performance at the guilt phase\nresulted in the jury hearing Pinholster boast about committing\nhundreds of robberies as well as other damaging evidence\nsuggesting that Pinholster murdered two men. The majority\nitself makes evident that counsel’s failure to advise Pinholster\nagainst taking the stand during the guilt phase was prejudicial\nat the penalty phase, because it repeatedly invokes the “dam-\nage Pinholster did to himself when he took the stand in the\nguilt phase and testified to an unrepentant life of violent\ncrime.” See Maj. Op. at 4767; see also id. at 4772 (“[N]o\nnewly-minted expert theory to explain his behavior would\nhave made a difference in the face of what Pinholster said and\ndid.”); id. at 4774 (noting that any mitigating evidence would\nhave been offset when Pinholster “proudly boasted to the\njury” about his life of crime). The same jury that decided Pin-\nholster’s guilt went on to decide his penalty, so the harmful\nguilt phase evidence undoubtedly added to the other prejudi-\ncial errors Pinholster’s counsel committed at the penalty\nphase, to which I now turn.\n\n                               II.\n\n  The majority holds that the California Supreme Court’s\nsummary denial of Pinholster’s penalty phase IAC claim was\nnot objectively unreasonable. I disagree. In my view, the\nSupreme Court’s recent decisions in Williams, Wiggins and\n\f4788                  PINHOLSTER v. AYERS\nRompilla compel the conclusion that Pinholster’s counsel per-\nformed deficiently and that Pinholster was prejudiced as a\nresult. The state court’s ruling to the contrary was indeed an\n“unreasonable application of[ ] clearly established Federal\nlaw, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United\nStates.” 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1).\n\n                              A.\n\n   The majority proceeds straight to the prejudice prong of the\nIAC inquiry and does not contend that Pinholster’s trial coun-\nsel performed competently. See Maj. Op. at 4765. This is a\nwise decision, because counsel manifestly failed to satisfy the\nprofessional standards for penalty phase representation. The\nSupreme Court has held that “trial counsel [must] conduct a\nthorough investigation of the defendant’s background.” Wil-\nliams, 529 U.S. at 396 (citing the applicable American Bar\nAssociation standards); see also Rompilla, 545 U.S. at 387 &\nn.7; Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 524 (“[I]nvestigations into mitigat-\ning evidence should comprise efforts to discover all reason-\nably available mitigating evidence . . . .”) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Employing this approach, the Court found\ndeficient performance — despite AEDPA’s deferential stan-\ndard of review — in Williams, Wiggins, and Rompilla. In Wil-\nliams, counsel began to prepare for the penalty phase less than\na week before trial, presented only four witnesses and “failed\nto conduct an investigation that would have uncovered exten-\nsive records graphically describing Williams’ nightmarish\nchildhood.” 529 U.S. at 369, 395. In Wiggins, counsel pre-\nsented no evidence of the petitioner’s life history or family\nbackground, and failed to consult documentary evidence\nbeyond the petitioner’s presentence investigation (PSI) report\nand Department of Social Services (DSS) records. See 539\nU.S. at 516, 524-29. And in Rompilla, counsel presented five\nwitnesses during the penalty phase and reviewed the reports\nof three mental health experts, but failed to examine the peti-\ntioner’s prior conviction file even though the prosecution had\n\f                      PINHOLSTER v. AYERS                    4789\ndeclared its intention to introduce that file’s contents at trial.\nSee 545 U.S. at 381-86.\n\n   Pinholster’s attorneys plainly performed even more defi-\nciently than the lawyers in Williams, Wiggins and Rompilla.\nAccording to billing records, they spent only 6.5 hours pre-\nparing for the penalty phase of Pinholster’s trial. One week\nbefore the penalty phase began, counsel admitted that they\n“had not prepared any evidence by way of mitigation,” and\nthen declined to request a continuance so that they could con-\nduct a proper investigation, telling the court that they did not\nthink more time “would make a great deal of difference.”\nThey obtained no medical or psychological records, law\nenforcement records or school reports for Pinholster or his\nsiblings, even though all of this documentary evidence was\nreadily available. They failed to provide the psychiatrist they\nretained, Dr. Stalberg, with any of the materials he needed to\nevaluate Pinholster properly. They interviewed and presented\njust one witness, Pinholster’s mother, whose testimony at trial\nwas highly misleading and self-serving. They waived their\nopening statement in the penalty phase. If the lawyers in Wil-\nliams and Rompilla performed deficiently even though they\ninterviewed and presented multiple witnesses, and if counsel’s\nperformance in Wiggins was deficient despite the examination\nof the petitioner’s PSI report and DSS records, then Pinhol-\nster’s attorneys cannot have satisfied the professional stan-\ndards for penalty phase representation. It is not reasonable for\na lawyer to interview and present just one witness, to fail to\nuncover abundant readily available mitigating evidence and to\nspend less than a day preparing for a proceeding at which the\njury will decide whether the lawyer’s client should live or die.\n\n   Chief Judge Kozinski, concurring, suggests that this perfor-\nmance was not deficient because counsel “made a rational\ndecision to pursue what was essentially a ‘pity’ mitigation\ncase, rather than trying to make out a case of mental defect.”\nConcurring Op. at 4781. Relying almost exclusively on Jus-\ntice O’Connor’s nonbinding concurrence in Rompilla, he\n\f4790                  PINHOLSTER v. AYERS\nargues that Rompilla stands only for the “unremarkable prop-\nosition” that counsel must take reasonable steps to prepare for\na hearing, not “that counsel are always ineffective for failing\nto uncover childhood mitigating evidence.” Id. Even if he\nwere correct that Rompilla’s holding is so limited, however,\nthe same cannot be said for Williams, where the Court noted\nthat it was “barely disputed” that counsel were ineffective\nwhere, as here, they “did not begin to prepare for [the penalty]\nphase of the proceeding until a week before the trial” and\n“failed to conduct an investigation that would have uncovered\nextensive records graphically describing Williams’ nightmar-\nish childhood, not because of any strategic calculation but\nbecause they incorrectly thought that state law barred access\nto such records.” 529 U.S. at 395 (emphasis added).\n\n  In this case, counsel failed to conduct an investigation into\nPinholster’s background — not through any mistake of law,\nbut through apathy or negligence. This hardly seems to be a\nmore defensible strategic choice. Although in certain cases\ncounsel may have “sound reason to think it would have been\npointless to spend time and money on . . . additional investi-\ngation,” and hence counsel’s failure to uncover additional\nmitigating evidence would not be unreasonable, here there\nwas no investigation into Pinholster’s background at all,\nbeyond interviewing his mother. Rompilla, 545 U.S. at 383.\nWhere no meaningful investigation is even attempted, counsel\ncould hardly have developed any “sound reason” to think that\n“additional investigation” would be fruitless. Id. (emphasis\nadded); see also id. at 389 (explaining that conducting further\ninvestigation may not be necessary “when a lawyer truly has\nreason to doubt” that further useful mitigating information\nwill be found) (emphasis added). Here counsel not only con-\nducted the very barest kind of investigation, they failed to\nconduct any follow-up investigation into the limited mitigat-\ning evidence that they did learn from Pinholster’s mother,\nsuch as evidence that Pinholster suffered from epilepsy. Thus\neven where counsel developed “sound reason” to believe that\n\f                      PINHOLSTER v. AYERS                  4791\nfurther investigation would yield fruitful evidence, counsel\nutterly neglected that duty. Id.\n\n   Lastly, contrary to Chief Judge Kozinski’s suggestion,\ncounsel could not have made a “rational decision” to pursue\na mitigation strategy that relied solely on Pinholster’s moth-\ner’s inaccurate testimony, when counsel failed to explore\nmeaningfully any other options. See Concurring Op. at 4781.\nAs the Court has explained, the question is “not whether\ncounsel should have presented a mitigation case,” but\n“whether the investigation supporting counsel’s decision not\nto introduce mitigating evidence of [the defendant’s] back-\nground was itself reasonable.” See Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 523.\nEven if one could hypothesize a world in which relying on\nPinholster’s mother’s testimony and eschewing a mental\ndefect defense was a reasonable defense strategy, Pinholster’s\ncounsel could not have made such a strategic decision where\nthey “abandoned their investigation of petitioner’s back-\nground after having acquired only rudimentary knowledge of\nhis history from a narrow set of sources.” Id. at 524. Coun-\nsel’s failure to investigate here was even more flagrant than\nin Williams, Wiggins or Rompilla, and so was manifestly\nunreasonable under clearly established Supreme Court law.\n\n                              B.\n\n                               1.\n\n   The majority holds that even if the performance of Pinhol-\nster’s counsel was deficient, it was not objectively unreason-\nable for the state court to rule that Pinholster was not thereby\nprejudiced. In reaching this conclusion, the majority mini-\nmizes or ignores much of the mitigating evidence that Pinhol-\nster could have presented, overstates the value of what little\nmitigating evidence was actually put before the jury, and\nexaggerates the aggravating evidence that was introduced\nagainst him. The majority thus imposes a much more stringent\ntest for prejudice than is required by Strickland v. Washing-\n\f4792                  PINHOLSTER v. AYERS\nton, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), and its progeny. While it is true that\nPinholster must demonstrate that there is a “reasonable proba-\nbility that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result\nof the proceeding would have been different,” the Court has\nemphasized that a reasonable probability is less than the pre-\nponderance more-likely-than-not standard. See Strickland,\n466 U.S. at 693-94; see also Rompilla, 545 U.S. at 393\n(“[A]lthough we suppose it is possible that [the sentencer]\ncould have heard it all and still decided on the death penalty,\nthat is not the test.”). The gap between the evidence that was\npresented and what could have been presented is more than\nsufficient to “undermine confidence in the outcome” of the\nproceeding. See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694.\n\n   Beginning with the available mitigating evidence, the\nmajority ignores or downplays much of the probative infor-\nmation that Pinholster could have presented at trial. First, the\n“years of significant neglect and physical and emotional\nabuse” that Pinholster experienced as a child were not, as the\nmajority implies, limited to the beatings by his stepfather and\ngrandmother. Maj. Op. at 4767-68. His birth father, Garland\nPinholster, abandoned the family when Pinholster was an\ninfant. Pinholster’s family was extremely poor, to the point\nthat the children would sometimes mix flour and water when\nthey were hungry. Neither Pinholster’s stepfather nor his\nmother evinced any concern for Pinholster and his siblings.\nIndeed, Pinholster’s mother often laughed when her children\nbehaved inappropriately, encouraged them to steal from\nnearby rail cars and dressed the children in rags while buying\nmink coats for herself.\n\n   Second, the lives of Pinholster’s siblings were worse than\nthe majority indicates. Pinholster’s half-sister, Tammy Brash-\near, was convicted of prostitution and forcible sexual battery,\nand became a ward of the juvenile court when she was 16.\nPinholster’s brother, Alvin Pinholster, was arrested for rob-\nbery, rape, sodomy and other offenses, suffered from severe\ndepression and schizophrenia and eventually committed sui-\n\f                     PINHOLSTER v. AYERS                  4793\ncide. Pinholster’s other brother, Terry Pinholster, suffered\nfrom depression and became a user of PCP. And Pinholster’s\nhalf-brother, Guy Pinholster, suffered from depression as well\nas bipolar mood disorder, and was frequently beaten by his\nfather.\n\n   Third, Pinholster’s own medical history is more problem-\natic than the majority acknowledges. He suffered his first\nhead injury at age two when he was run over by his mother’s\ncar, resulting in a two-week hospital stay. He suffered a sec-\nond severe head injury a year later, during a car accident in\nwhich Pinholster’s head hit the front windshield hard enough\nto shatter the glass. According to Dr. Woods, these injuries at\nthe very least supported a post-traumatic diagnosis, and may\nhave accounted for the abnormal EEG that Pinholster\nrecorded as a child. Similarly, Dr. Olson and Dr. Vinogradov\nstated that the injuries damaged Pinholster’s brain and caused\nhim to become more aggressive, while Dr. Stalberg described\nthe injuries as potentially “devastating” and linked them to\nPinholster’s epilepsy. That epilepsy was severe enough that\nPinholster was prescribed medication from age nine onward\nand repeatedly suffered complex partial and grand mal sei-\nzures. Different doctors also diagnosed Pinholster with bipo-\nlar mood disorder (Dr. Woods) and personality change due to\nchildhood head trauma (Dr. Olson and Dr. Vinogradov),\nwhile agreeing that he was epileptic. At age 11, Pinholster\nspent more than four months in a mental institution.\n\n   Fourth, the majority does not even acknowledge that Pin-\nholster had severe learning disabilities in school and was\nsocially isolated and maladjusted as a child. According to his\nelementary school teacher, Lois Rainwater, Pinholster “had\nno friends at all,” “seemed incapable of relating either to his\npeers or to adults,” “seemed like a child who got no attention\nor structure at home” and “fell through the cracks emotionally\nand every other way.” Lastly, Pinholster had a history of\nabusing alcohol, nicotine, marijuana, and heroin. He started\ndrinking alcohol, smoking, sniffing glue and paint and using\n\f4794                  PINHOLSTER v. AYERS\nmarijuana between the ages of 10 and 12; using Seconal and\ndowners between the ages of 13 and 14; and using heroin and\ncocaine between the ages of 14 and 16. On the night of the\nevents in question, Pinholster was heavily intoxicated with\nboth alcohol and drugs.\n\n   Instead of discussing this substantial available mitigating\nevidence that was not put before the jury, the majority instead\ndwells on an interview Pinholster gave to a social worker in\n1991, where he downplayed the extent of the abuse he suf-\nfered as a child. See Maj. Op. at 4767-69. Although the\nmajority acknowledges that Pinholster’s stepfather “fre-\nquently beat Pinholster with his fists, a belt, or anything else\navailable, including a two-by-four board,” the majority none-\ntheless focuses on Pinholster’s — the abused child’s — inter-\npretation of these events as nothing but “discipline” that\n“benefitted” him and his brothers. Id. at 4767-68. Further,\nwhile the majority goes on at length about the positive rela-\ntionship Pinholster may have with his maternal grandfather,\nPinholster’s uncle and aunt testified that it was Pinholster’s\ngrandmother who would frequently “beat the hell out of” Pin-\nholster from the time when he was a toddler. Every medical\nprofessional who evaluated Pinholster concluded that he suf-\nfered severe abuse and neglect in his childhood. Further, mul-\ntiple doctors who evaluated Pinholster noted his tendency to\nportray his own history inaccurately or minimize the serious-\nness of his childhood trauma so as to maintain a facade of per-\nsonal control. The majority’s emphasis on Pinholster’s\nrationalization of his mother’s neglect therefore seems rather\nmyopic if not disingenuous.\n\n   The majority also attempts to minimize the evidence of\nPinholster’s substantial neurological and emotional disorders\nby emphasizing disagreements among the experts as to some\ndiagnoses, and stating that “the only constant with regards to\nthe evolving defense expert testimony has been Dr. Stalberg’s\ndiagnosis of Antisocial Personality Disorder and the experts’\nagreement that it is reasonably probable that Pinholster suf-\n\f                     PINHOLSTER v. AYERS                  4795\nfered from epilepsy.” Maj. Op. at 4772. It is unclear why the\nmajority dismisses the importance of these diagnoses, which\nare clearly sufficient of themselves to indicate an organic\nbasis for some of Pinholster’s behavior. Further, Dr. Woods\nconcluded that Pinholster suffered from bipolar mood disor-\nder and Dr. Olson and Dr. Vinogradov concluded that Pinhol-\nster suffered from brain damage attributable to childhood\ntrauma, which may have explained in part his aggressive\nbehavior. Even if not all experts concurred on the exact set of\ndiagnoses, numerous doctors agreed that Pinholster suffered\nfrom psychological disorders that may have influenced his\ncriminal acts. Further, this medical testimony might have also\naffected the jury’s interpretation of Pinholster’s guilt phase\ntestimony, again by suggesting an organic basis for his ten-\ndency to exaggerate his past. Yet none of this medical evi-\ndence or testimony was put before the jury to evaluate, and\nthe majority acknowledges that it has no reason to doubt the\ncredibility of these medical professionals.\n\n   The majority also gives too much credit to the penalty\nphase testimony of Pinholster’s mother, Burnice Brashear.\nWhile Brashear’s testimony did include some “mitigating evi-\ndence,” see id. at 4769 — as was inevitable given Pinholster’s\nhorrific childhood — the overall impression she conveyed of\nPinholster’s upbringing was not just incomplete but actually\nuntrue. Contrary to her statements in court, Pinholster’s sib-\nlings were not “[b]asically very good children,” and they got\ninto much more than “small trouble” with drugs, alcohol and\nthe law. The beatings that Pinholster endured at the hands of\nhis stepfather were quite certainly child abuse, not mere “dis-\ncipline” or “arguments and hassles,” as Brashear also charac-\nterized them. Pinholster and his siblings did not have\n“everything normally materialwise that most people have,”\n“decent clothes” and “a nice house,” but instead suffered from\nmalnutrition, lack of clothing and neglect. Pinholster’s epi-\nlepsy was first diagnosed at age nine, not after he was beaten\nat age 18. And Pinholster did not do “much better” at school\nafter being diagnosed with “perceptive vision” and moved to\n\f4796                  PINHOLSTER v. AYERS\na different classroom; rather, his academic performance con-\ntinued to decline, and by his teenage years he was being shuf-\nfled from one institutional setting to another. Instead of\nminimizing the damage done by Brashear’s testimony, I\nwould simply adhere to the conclusions of Dr. Stalberg and\nthe district court. Dr. Stalberg described Brashear’s state-\nments as “profoundly misleading,” while the district court\nopined that “[t]he available evidence ‘was far different from\nthe unfocused snapshot’ presented by Pinholster’s attorneys at\ntrial.” Hence the majority attributes false weight to the jury’s\nsupposedly “obvious rejection of such mitigating circum-\nstances.” Id. at 4769. The jury was not presented with an\naccurate picture of the mitigating circumstances, so it hardly\ncould have rejected them.\n\n   Finally, the majority not only overvalues Brashear’s testi-\nmony, but also ignores the way in which its deficiencies were\nturned against Pinholster by the prosecution. During the pen-\nalty phase closing arguments, the State was able to claim, on\nthe basis of Brashear’s inaccurate statements, that Pinholster\nhad resorted to crime and violence even though he “came\nfrom a good home,” “was not a deprived child” and “had\nmany things going for him, probably more than many chil-\ndren.” The State also was able to discount Brashear’s testi-\nmony about Pinholster’s epilepsy — and indeed to accuse her\nof lying about it — by pointing to the complete lack of cor-\nroborating evidence as well as her own ignorance about the\ncondition. On cross-examination, Brashear stated that she did\nnot know what type of epilepsy Pinholster had, that she was\nunsure when she found out about the condition and that on\none occasion she had taken Pinholster to a doctor and, as the\nprosecutor put it, “lo and behold, just like that the doctor told\nthem he had epilepsy.” Brashear’s flawed testimony, in com-\nbination with Pinholster’s counsel’s failure to present any\nother evidence in mitigation, thus made possible the State’s\ndevastating conclusion: “What did the defendant proffer in\nthis particular case as to ask you to come back with anything\nless than death? . . . Not one person except his mother.” Cf.\n\f                     PINHOLSTER v. AYERS                  4797\nKaris v. Calderon, 283 F.3d 1117, 1139 (9th Cir. 2002) (find-\ning prejudice in part because “[t]he defense counsel’s por-\ntrayal of [petitioner] as intelligent without any indication of\nhis violent and abusive childhood afforded the prosecution a\nvery effective argument,” and enabled “[t]he prosecutor [to]\nemphasize[ ] the fact that [petitioner] was ‘bright’ and ‘cun-\nning’ and that he ‘well knew exactly what he was doing’ ”).\n\n                              2.\n\n   On the other side of the ledger, the majority describes the\naggravating evidence that was introduced against Pinholster\nas “overwhelming.” Maj. Op. at 4766, 4773. This evidence\nmust not be understated, and Pinholster is obviously not a\nsympathetic person, but deeming the aggravating evidence\n“overwhelming” does not make it so. First, the murders them-\nselves were not as heinous as many of the other terrible\ncrimes that we have considered in capital cases. Pinholster did\nnot intend to kill anyone when he went to Kumar’s house, and\nindeed was surprised when the housesitters, Johnson and\nBeckett, arrived at the scene. Thus to the extent there was any\npremeditation, it formed immediately before the instant\noffenses took place, when a drunk, high and emotionally dis-\ntraught Pinholster and his two codefendants, Corona and\nBrown, suddenly discovered that they were not alone in\nKumar’s house. Moreover, Brown stabbed Johnson as well\nand said that he had “ ‘buried his knife to the hilt’ ” in him,\nmeaning that it is uncertain whether Pinholster was responsi-\nble for Johnson’s fatal wounds. See Pinholster, 824 P.2d at\n582-84.\n\n   We have previously described a very similar crime as “in\nessence a robbery gone wrong.” Belmontes v. Brown, 414\nF.3d 1094, 1139 (9th Cir. 2005), rev’d on other grounds,\nAyers v. Belmontes, 127 S. Ct. 469 (2006). We commented in\nBelmontes that the murder, which involved the bludgeoning\nof a single victim with an iron bar during a robbery, “was not\npre-planned, nor did it involve kidnapping, rape, torture . . .\n\f4798                 PINHOLSTER v. AYERS\nor any of the other especially heinous elements that usually\nare present when a jury votes for the ultimate penalty.” Id.;\nsee also Summerlin v. Schriro, 427 F.3d 623, 641 (9th Cir.\n2005) (en banc) (noting that “instantaneous premeditation” is\n“not definitive for the purpose of establishing the especially\nheinous, cruel, or depraved aggravator”). Although Pinhol-\nster’s crime was surely vicious, the facts of the crime were\nunfortunately far from extreme in either their depravity or\ncruelty. See, e.g., Hovey v. Ayers, 458 F.3d 892, 898 (9th Cir.\n2006) (defendant abducted a young girl as she was walking\nhome from school, sexually molested her and abandoned her\non the side of the road with six skull fractures and 14 lacera-\ntion wounds); Fields v. Brown, 431 F.3d 1186, 1202 (9th Cir.\n2005) (defendant was responsible for a “ ‘one-man crime\nwave’ ” during which he committed “a murder and at least\nthree kidnapings, rapes, and robberies within a three-week\nperiod of time”).\n\n   Second, the aggravating evidence introduced against Pin-\nholster that pertained to incidents other than the murders\nthemselves was also less severe than that in many of our pre-\nvious cases. As the majority notes, Pinholster denied murder-\ning Johnson and Beckett, referred to himself as a\n“professional robber,” testified that he often scratched peo-\nple’s property, was convicted of kidnaping and received sev-\neral disciplinary infractions while arrested and incarcerated.\nSee Maj. Op. at 4774-77 & n.29. As presented to the jury,\nhowever, Pinholster’s criminal record was not very extensive,\nas it did not include any convictions other than the kidnaping\ncount. Moreover, although the majority believes this aggra-\nvating evidence was of overwhelming importance, the prose-\ncutor did not actually refer to Pinholster’s denial of his\ninvolvement in the murders, his prior robberies or his pen-\nchant for scratching property at any point during the penalty\nphase. Considering analogous aggravating evidence in Bel-\nmontes, we concluded that it was “not strong,” but was “mini-\nmal” and “weak[ ].” 414 F.3d at 1106, 1139-40. The relevant\nfacts in that case consisted of Belmontes’ “previous[ ] incarc-\n\f                      PINHOLSTER v. AYERS                    4799\nerat[ation] in the youth facility for being an accessory after\nthe fact to voluntary manslaughter, one domestic violence\nincident, and two occurrences relating to possession, or possi-\nble possession, of a gun.” Id. at 1139. Similarly, we noted that\nthe prosecution presented “considerable” aggravating evi-\ndence in Boyde v. Brown, 404 F.3d 1159, 1179 (9th Cir.\n2005). The incidents introduced in that case included the peti-\ntioner’s assaults on former classmates, his throwing bricks at\na van, his theft of his stepfather’s gun, his prior robberies, his\ndrug use while incarcerated and his plot to escape from\nprison. See id.\n\n   The majority dismisses the relevance of any comparisons\nbetween Pinholster’s murders and other crimes, noting that\nunder California law, the jury reviews only the facts in front\nof it and does not conduct a proportionality review by com-\nparing the crime to others. See Maj. Op. at 4775-76 n.30. All\njurors, however, consider a case against a background of\nsocial understandings and shared experiences about crime and\ncriminals, which in turn influences their decision as to\nwhether someone has committed an offense so heinous as to\nwarrant the ultimate penalty. Indeed, the majority’s emphasis\non the lack of proportionality analysis in California law\nunderscores the prejudice that resulted from counsels’ failure\nto put forth the reams of the readily available mitigating evi-\ndence in Pinholster’s case. Because the jurors could weigh\nonly the aggravating and mitigating evidence presented to\nthem, the omissions of and outright misrepresentations about\nmitigating evidence on Pinholster’s side of the scale plainly\nleft the jury with little to tip the balance toward life imprison-\nment over execution.\n\n   Finally, as discussed above, some of the aggravating evi-\ndence that the majority cites would never have been intro-\nduced had Pinholster’s counsel not performed deficiently\nduring the guilt phase of the trial. In particular, Pinholster’s\nreferences to his own past robberies — probably the most\ndamning testimony the jury heard, next to the details of the\n\f4800                  PINHOLSTER v. AYERS\nactual murders — and his statements about the swastikas and\nsignatures he frequently scratched into other people’s prop-\nerty would never have been admitted. See Maj. Op. at 4776-\n77. Competent representation during the trial’s first stage\nwould thus have further weakened the prosecution’s argument\nduring the penalty phase that Pinholster deserved the ultimate\npenalty.\n\n                               3.\n\n   The mitigating evidence that Pinholster could have intro-\nduced was therefore substantially more compelling than the\nmajority acknowledges, whereas the aggravating evidence\nwas somewhat weaker. If the evidence on both sides of the\nledger is fairly characterized, and evaluated in light of the\nSupreme Court’s recent decisions in Williams, Wiggins and\nRompilla, it is clear that the California Supreme Court’s\ndenial of Pinholster’s penalty phase IAC claim was objec-\ntively unreasonable.\n\n   The available mitigating evidence in Williams was that the\npetitioner had been beaten by his father, that his parents had\nbeen imprisoned for criminal neglect, that he had been placed\nunder the custody of the social services bureau for two years,\nthat he was borderline mentally retarded, that he had helped\ncrack a prison drug ring and that he had been a peaceful pris-\noner. See 529 U.S. at 395-96. The aggravating evidence, on\nthe other hand, was that the petitioner had been convicted of\narmed robbery, burglary and grand larceny prior to the murder\nfor which he was sentenced to death, and that after the murder\nhe perpetrated two auto thefts and two separate assaults on\nelderly victims. The jury also learned that he was convicted\nfor setting a fire while in jail. See id. at 368-69. In Wiggins,\nthe available mitigating evidence was that the petitioner expe-\nrienced severe privation and abuse while in his mother’s cus-\ntody, that he was abused, sexually molested and raped while\nin foster care, that he was homeless for a period and that his\nmental capacity was diminished. See 539 U.S. at 535. The\n\f                      PINHOLSTER v. AYERS                  4801\nonly aggravating evidence was that the petitioner had\ndrowned his elderly victim and ransacked her apartment; he\nhad no record of violent conduct before or after the murder.\nSee id. at 514, 537. Finally, the available mitigating evidence\nin Rompilla was that the petitioner grew up in a slum, that he\nwas abused by his father, that his parents were alcoholics, that\nhe consumed too much alcohol, that he was mentally retarded\nand that he suffered from organic brain damage. See 545 U.S.\nat 390-93. The aggravating evidence consisted of the petition-\ner’s prior convictions for rape, burglary and theft, as well as\nhis use of torture in committing the murder for which he was\nsentenced to death. See id. at 378; Rompilla v. Horn, 355 F.3d\n233, 237 (3d Cir. 2004), overruled by 545 U.S. 374 (2005).\n\n   Although the majority asserts that Pinholster’s available\nmitigating evidence “falls short when compared to the miti-\ngating evidence available in Williams, Wiggins, and Rompil-\nla,” that evidence cannot be meaningfully distinguished from\nthese cases. Maj. Op. at 4773. Pinholster, Williams, Wiggins\nand Rompilla were all badly beaten by their parents. All four\nmen grew up in extreme poverty with little to no parental\nattention. All four spent time in foster homes and other insti-\ntutional settings as children. Pinholster and Rompilla suffered\nfrom organic brain damage, while Williams and Wiggins\nwere mentally retarded or close to it. And both Pinholster and\nRompilla were addicted to alcohol.\n\n  Rather than heed these obvious similarities, the majority\nemphasizes the differences that inevitably exist between one\nperson’s life and another’s. For instance, Williams, unlike\nPinholster, behaved well while in prison and Wiggins, also\nunlike Pinholster, was sexually molested and spent time\nhomeless. Maj. Op. at 4773. These minor factual contrasts\ncannot be legally dispositive, particularly given that several\naspects of Pinholster’s available mitigating evidence have no\nparallel in Williams, Wiggins and Rompilla. Pinholster’s\nmother, for example, did not just neglect him but rather\nactively encouraged his illegal activities. His siblings had\n\f4802                  PINHOLSTER v. AYERS\nserious problems with alcohol, drugs, mental health and the\nlaw. Pinholster himself is a lifelong epileptic prone to severe\nseizures. He was socially isolated and maladjusted as a child.\nHis substance abuse issues began at an early age and involved\nan array of illegal drugs. And Pinholster’s counsel did not just\npresent incomplete information about him in mitigation, but\nrather allowed his mother to give inaccurate testimony that\nwas then used against him by the prosecution. I do not neces-\nsarily contend that these differences make Pinholster’s avail-\nable mitigating evidence more powerful than that in Williams,\nWiggins and Rompilla. They do, however, more than offset\nthe supposedly meaningful contrasts that the majority identi-\nfies.\n\n   On the aggravating evidence side, I agree with the majority\nthat Wiggins can be distinguished because the petitioner in\nthat case, unlike Pinholster, “[did] not have a record of violent\nconduct that could have been introduced by the State to offset\nth[e] powerful mitigating narrative.” 539 U.S. at 537; see\nMaj. Op. at 4773-74. However, the aggravating evidence\nagainst Pinholster was not dispositively stronger than that in\nWilliams and Rompilla. It is true, as the majority asserts, that\nPinholster admitted to committing many past robberies — in\nguilt phase testimony that would never have taken place had\nhe been competently represented, and that the prosecutor\nnever mentioned during the penalty phase — and that he was\nan unusually problematic inmate. See Maj. Op. at 4774-76 &\nn.29. But Williams also committed theft-related offenses both\nbefore and after his homicide, and, unlike Pinholster, he was\nactually convicted of some of those crimes (namely his 1976\narmed robbery and his 1982 burglary and grand larceny).\nThere is also no analogue in Pinholster’s criminal history to\nWilliams’ “two separate violent assaults on elderly victims\nperpetrated after the [relevant] murder,” his proclivity for\nstarting fires or the testimony by two expert witnesses that he\nwould “pose a serious continuing threat to society.” 529 U.S.\nat 368-69. Rompilla, similarly, was actually convicted of bur-\nglary and theft. He was also convicted of rape — a more seri-\n\f                      PINHOLSTER v. AYERS                  4803\nous crime than any Pinholster committed before the instant\nmurders — and tortured his homicide victim before finally\nputting him out of his misery. See 545 U.S. at 378; 355 F.3d\nat 237. Again, I do not necessarily argue that these differences\nmake the aggravating evidence against Pinholster weaker than\nthat in Williams and Rompilla. But I cannot accept the majori-\nty’s conclusion that the aggravating evidence against Pinhol-\nster was dispositively worse.\n\n   Though the majority does not address them, it is also clear\nthat none of the Supreme Court decisions that have upheld\nstate court denials of petitioners’ penalty phase IAC claims\nare as relevant here as Williams, Wiggins and Rompilla. In\nStrickland, “[t]he evidence that respondent says his trial coun-\nsel should have offered at the sentencing hearing would\nbarely have altered the sentencing profile presented to the\nsentencing judge,” and the aggravating factors were “over-\nwhelming.” 466 U.S. at 699-700. The balance between avail-\nable mitigating evidence and aggravating evidence was thus\nstarkly different from Williams, Wiggins, Rompilla and the\ncase before us. In Burger v. Kemp, 483 U.S. 776 (1987), and\nBell v. Cone, 535 U.S. 685 (2002), the Court never reached\nthe prejudice prong of the IAC inquiry because it concluded\nthat the petitioners’ lawyers had not performed deficiently.\nThe aggravating evidence in Burger and Bell was also more\nsevere than in this case, while the available mitigating evi-\ndence was less powerful. See Bell, 535 U.S. at 699; Burger,\n483 U.S. at 789-94. Woodford v. Visciotti, 537 U.S. 19\n(2002), is inapposite for the same reason: The aggravating\nevidence, which included the knifing of one man and the stab-\nbing of a pregnant woman, was “devastating” while the avail-\nable mitigating evidence was not particularly potent. Id. at 26.\nSchriro v. Landrigan, 127 S. Ct. 1933 (2007), finally, dealt\nprimarily with the extraneous issue of a petitioner instructing\nhis lawyer not to mount a case in mitigation. The Court also\nexplicitly labeled the available mitigating evidence in that\ncase as “weak,” and noted the petitioner’s “exceedingly vio-\nlent past” of murders, kidnapings and prison escapes. Id. at\n\f4804                  PINHOLSTER v. AYERS\n1944. Accordingly, nothing in the Supreme Court’s other pen-\nalty phase IAC decisions undermines my conclusion that we\nare bound here by Williams, Wiggins and Rompilla — and\nthat those cases require us to hold that the California Supreme\nCourt’s denial of Pinholster’s penalty phase IAC claim was\nobjectively unreasonable.\n\n                              III.\n\n   The California Supreme Court’s summary denial of Pinhol-\nster’s penalty phase IAC claim was an objectively unreason-\nable application of Strickland. The performance of\nPinholster’s counsel at the penalty phase was plainly defi-\ncient; and the available mitigating evidence in his favor and\nthe aggravating evidence against him — when they are fairly\ncharacterized — render this case materially indistinguishable\nfor purposes of prejudice from Williams and Rompilla. I\ntherefore dissent. I would remand for the district court to issue\na writ vacating Pinholster’s sentence, unless within a reason-\nable time set by the court the State conducts a new penalty\nphase trial or imposes a lesser sentence consistent with law.\n\f",

AYERS\n                         OPINION\n\nTALLMAN, Circuit Judge:\n\n   Scott Lynn Pinholster faces a death sentence in California\nfor murdering Thomas Johnson and Robert Beckett on Janu-\nary 9, 1982, robbing Johnson and Beckett with intentional\ninfliction of great bodily injury and with personal use of a\nknife, robbing Todd Croutch with a firearm, and burglarizing\nMichael Kumar’s residence. The jury found two special cir-\ncumstances: Pinholster, in the same proceeding, was con-\nvicted of more than one murder, Cal. Penal Code\n§ 190.2(a)(3) (1984), and he committed the murders during a\nrobbery and a burglary, id. § 190.2(a)(17)(i), (vii). The jury\nfixed Pinholster’s penalty at death, and on June 4, 1984, the\nLos Angeles County Superior Court so sentenced him.\n\n   On automatic appeal, the California Supreme Court, in an\nopinion written by Justice Stanley Mosk, set aside one\nmultiple-murder special-circumstance finding but otherwise\naffirmed the judgment. See People v. Pinholster, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1203248\"><a href=\"/opinion/1203248/people-v-pinholster/\"><span class=\"volume\">824</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">571</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Cal. 1992). Pinholster sought a writ of habeas corpus. He\nchallenged his convictions and death sentence. The California\nSupreme Court summarily denied Pinholster’s state petition\nfor habeas corpus. Pinholster filed a federal habeas corpus\npetition but the district court dismissed it when the parties\nstipulated that the petition contained unexhausted claims. Pin-\nholster returned to state court to exhaust those claims. On\nOctober 1, 1997, the California Supreme Court denied Pinhol-\nster’s second habeas petition.\n\n   Pinholster then filed an amended federal habeas petition\nand requested an evidentiary hearing on several claims. The\ndistrict court granted the State’s motion for summary judg-\nment on Pinholster’s claims challenging the constitutionality\nof his convictions. Pinholster appeals the district court’s\ndenial of his request for an evidentiary hearing on his guilt\nphase ineffective assistance of counsel claims. However, the\n\f                           PINHOLSTER v. AYERS                           4735\ndistrict court concluded that his counsel inadequately investi-\ngated and deficiently presented mitigating evidence at the\npenalty phase and granted Pinholster’s habeas petition with\nrespect to the death penalty. The State cross-appeals the dis-\ntrict court’s judgment setting aside Pinholster’s death sen-\ntence.\n\n   We affirm the district court’s denial of an evidentiary hear-\ning on Pinholster’s claims of ineffective assistance during the\nguilt phase. We reverse the district court’s grant of habeas\nrelief on Pinholster’s death sentence.\n\n                                      I\n\n                                      A\n\n   On January 9, 1982, Pinholster fatally stabbed the victims,\nJohnson and Beckett, during Pinholster’s burglary of Kumar’s\nresidence.1 Pinholster, 824 P.2d at 582. Kumar was a known\ndrug dealer and acquaintance of Pinholster. Charles Kempf,\nanother acquaintance of Pinholster, testified that in mid-\nDecember 1981, Pinholster suggested to Kempf and three oth-\ners that they rob Kumar of his drug stash.2 Id. According to\nKempf, Pinholster considered Kumar “an easy mark.” Id. The\nfive went to Kumar’s home, but soon aborted the plan. Kumar\nwas not home during the December visit, and they preferred\nto gain access through Kumar rather than break in. Id. Kempf\ntestified that Pinholster carried a buck knife, and Pinholster\nclaimed he would get Kumar’s drugs “one way or the other.”\nIn addition, Kempf testified that Pinholster bragged about\n  1\n     We extract many of the facts and procedural history from the Califor-\nnia Supreme Court opinion affirming Pinholster’s convictions and death\nsentence on direct appeal, Pinholster, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1203248\"><a href=\"/opinion/1203248/people-v-pinholster/\"><span class=\"volume\">824</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">571</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, which are confirmed\nby our own independent review of the record.\n   2\n     Kempf had a previous conviction for receiving stolen property and was\nunder arrest when he first talked with the police.

The\ngroup then left Tapar’s apartment to burglarize Kumar’s resi-\ndence.\n\n   Corona testified about the events that took place during the\nburglary. Pinholster gained entry by breaking a window in the\nrear of the home and Brown entered through an open sliding-\nglass door. Id. at 582-83. The three ransacked the house. Id.\nat 583. Pinholster found marijuana in a bedroom and spilled\na green substance in the kitchen. Id. At this time, victims\nJohnson and Beckett (Kumar’s housesitters) arrived, opened\nthe front door, discovered the crime, and shouted they would\ncall the police. The three burglars attempted to leave through\nthe rear sliding-glass door, but Johnson and Beckett came\naround to the back. As Johnson tried to enter, Pinholster\nstabbed Johnson in the chest three to four times with the\nknife. The California Supreme Court summarized Corona’s\ndescription of the robbery, stabbing, and murders as follows:\n\n    [Pinholster] backed [Johnson] out of the house and\n    onto the patio, demanding drugs and money and\n    repeatedly striking him. Johnson dropped his wallet\n    on the ground and obeyed [Pinholster’s] order to sit.\n    Then Beckett approached, and [Pinholster] attacked\n    him. Corona saw that [Pinholster] was stabbing\n\f                      PINHOLSTER v. AYERS                     4737\n      Beckett, striking him in the chest as Corona had seen\n      [Pinholster] strike Johnson. [Pinholster] repeatedly\n      stabbed Beckett, again demanding money and drugs.\n      [Pinholster] picked up Johnson’s wallet and took a\n      wallet from Beckett’s pocket. [Pinholster] repeatedly\n      kicked Beckett in the head. Corona then saw code-\n      fendant Brown stabbing Johnson in the chest. The\n      three men withdrew, and Corona drove them back to\n      [Pinholster’s] apartment. Brown and [Pinholster]\n      commented that they had “gotten them good,” and\n      Brown said he had “buried his knife to the hilt” in\n      Johnson.\n\nId.\n\n  After the murders, the three returned to Pinholster’s apart-\nment and split the proceeds. Pinholster washed his knife and\na woman named Debbie washed Brown’s knife. Id. The next\nday, Pinholster telephoned Corona and told him to “lie low.”\nTwo weeks later, Corona turned himself in and gave a state-\nment to the police. Corona testified at trial consistent with his\nearlier statement except that at trial he also mentioned seeing\nBrown stab Johnson and that he, Brown, and Pinholster\ndivided the proceeds. Id.\n\n   Casey Corona, Art Corona’s wife, was at Pinholster’s\napartment when Pinholster, Brown, and Art Corona returned\nfrom Kumar’s house. At trial, Casey corroborated Corona’s\ntestimony about the planning, execution, and cover up of the\nrobbery/murders. She testified that she saw Pinholster wash\nblood off his knife and she heard him say: “It had to be done\nthe way it was done. We had to do what we had to do.” Id.\nPolice had recently arrested Casey on a drug charge, and she\ntestified that the prosecution assisted her entry into a diver-\nsion program.\n\n  Art Corona also testified that Pinholster had threatened him\non numerous occasions. Specifically, prior to the preliminary\n\f4738                  PINHOLSTER v. AYERS\nhearing, Pinholster threatened to “blow up” Corona on his\nway to court if Corona testified against him. Pinholster\nimpeached Corona with Corona’s prior burglary conviction\nand Corona’s admission that he was a professional burglar. Id.\n\n   The State introduced physical evidence to corroborate Pin-\nholster’s presence in Kumar’s residence after it had been ran-\nsacked. Corona testified that Pinholster wore jeans and boots\non the night of the murders. Police found boots with micro-\nscopic blood stains and a towel with a blood stain in Pinhol-\nster’s apartment. Police also found a pair of jeans with a blood\nstain; however, investigators could not confirm whether the\nblood was human. In addition, when police arrested Brown,\nhe had a buck knife with dimensions that corresponded to one\nof Johnson’s stab wounds. Id. at 583-84. Investigators also\ndiscovered traces of human blood near the hilt of Brown’s\nknife. The police found human blood on the inside forearm of\nthe sleeve of Corona’s shirt, but they found no blood on his\nknife. Id. at 584.\n\n   Pinholster presented an alibi when he testified in his own\ndefense at trial. He characterized himself as a “professional\nrobber” who used guns while preying on drug dealers, not a\nmurderer who used knives. He boasted of being a “very good\nrobber,” claiming that he had committed “hundreds” of rob-\nberies and that he had only been caught by the authorities one\ntime. To support his defense, Pinholster admitted to robbing\nThomas Croutch at gunpoint on another occasion, and having\nplanned to rob Kumar, but denied having recruited Kempf and\nthe three other individuals to do so. Pinholster also admitted\nto breaking into Kumar’s house on the night of the murders.\n\n   By way of his alibi, Pinholster claimed he had thrown a\nparty in memory of his best friend, “Shotgun,” on the night\nof the murders. Id. He testified that around 8 p.m. he left the\nparty and went to Kumar’s house, broke a window, and\ngained access through the kitchen. He took a bag of mari-\njuana, touched a bluish substance in a bedroom, and spilled a\n\f                          PINHOLSTER v. AYERS                           4739\nbag with green material in the kitchen. He denied ransacking\nthe house or killing anyone.3 Id. Pinholster said he had\nreturned to his house around 9 p.m., and smoked a consider-\nable amount of marijuana and consumed a lot of alcohol.\nAround 11:30 p.m., Corona asked Pinholster for an ounce of\nmarijuana to sell. Pinholster said he gave Kumar’s address to\nCorona in exchange for a third of whatever drugs Corona took\nfrom Kumar’s house. Corona could not find Kumar’s resi-\ndence and returned around 1 a.m. Pinholster gave him the\ndirections again, and around 1:30 a.m. Pinholster went to\nTapar’s house to tell her that “Shotgun” had died.4 Id. at 585.\nHe admitted to stabbing her door and carving a swastika and\nlightning bolt on her car after she refused to admit him. Pin-\nholster claimed that he returned to his apartment around 2\na.m., and Corona returned around 4 a.m. Pinholster’s brother\nand several friends corroborated his version of the events. The\nsuperior court jury by its verdict obviously rejected Pinhol-\nster’s alibi defense.\n\n                                     B\n\n   The State sought the death penalty. On March 22, 1983, the\nprosecution mailed a California Penal Code section 190.3 let-\nter to Pinholster at the Los Angeles County Jail, notifying him\nthat the State intended to offer aggravating evidence at the\npenalty proceedings. Pinholster and his counsel5 contended\n  3\n     During rebuttal, the state called Eric Klemetti who testified that he had\npurchased marijuana from Johnson at the Kumar residence at 9 p.m. He\nclaimed that the house was not ransacked and everything was in order.\nPinholster, 824 P.2d at 585.\n   4\n     On rebuttal, Tapar contradicted Pinholster when she testified that Pin-\nholster arrived at her house in Corona’s car, not his own as he had said.\nShe also claimed not to have known “Shotgun,” giving Pinholster no rea-\nson to discuss his death with her.\n   5\n     Between April 20, 1982, and January 19, 1983, court-appointed coun-\nsel Marvin Part represented Pinholster. Attorney James Armstrong was\nappointed in his place in January 1983. Pinholster requested to proceed\n\f4740                     PINHOLSTER v. AYERS\nthey were not informed of the letter until the guilt phase con-\ncluded on April 24, 1984. Pinholster moved to exclude aggra-\nvating evidence based on the prosecution’s failure to comply\nwith California Penal Code section 190.3. The court denied\nthe motion.6 Rather than move to continue the penalty phase\n—a request the state trial court indicated it would grant—\nPinholster’s counsel (Brainard and Dettmar) elected to pro-\nceed. The penalty phase began on May 1, 1984. The court\ninstructed the jury on May 2, 1984, and the jury returned a\nverdict of death on each of the two murder counts on May 7,\n1984.\n\n   The prosecution called eight penalty phase witnesses. First,\nJack Taube, Pinholster’s juvenile probation officer, testified\nthat Pinholster had previously struck a bailiff without cause\nafter a court proceeding. Several bailiffs had to physically\nrestrain Pinholster, and, as Pinholster left the proceeding, he\ncontinued to orally threaten the wounded bailiff. Taube also\ntestified about Pinholster’s involvement in juvenile gangs.\nSecond, Los Angeles Police Department (“LAPD”) patrol\nofficer David Kaufman testified that shortly after he and his\npartner responded to a fight involving Pinholster, Pinholster\nappeared to fake an epileptic seizure. Officer Kaufman also\ntestified that once handcuffed, Pinholster became belligerent\nand threatened to kick the officers. After the officers trans-\nferred Pinholster to a facility for possible medical treatment,\n\nwithout counsel, and from March 17, 1983, to July 13, 1983, Pinholster\nrepresented himself. On July 12, 1983, the Los Angeles County Superior\nCourt appointed Harry W. Brainard after Pinholster changed his mind. On\nDecember 20, 1983, the superior court also appointed Wilbur G. Dettmar\nas second counsel under California Penal Code section 1095. Brainard and\nDettmar represented Pinholster during the guilt and penalty phases of his\ntrial.\n   6\n     On state habeas review, the Los Angeles County Superior Court held\nan evidentiary hearing and determined that Pinholster, while representing\nhimself pre-trial, received actual notice of the State’s intent to seek the\ndeath penalty. Pinholster does not challenge that finding here.\n\f                     PINHOLSTER v. AYERS                  4741\nand upon removing Pinholster’s leg restraints, Pinholster\nkicked Officer Kaufman in the head.\n\n   Third, Ernest Guzman, another LAPD officer, testified that\nafter refusing to enter his police vehicle on a different occa-\nsion, Pinholster seemingly faked an epileptic seizure. After\nthe officers placed Pinholster in the police car he became vio-\nlent, kicking at Officer Guzman’s head. After Pinholster told\nthe officers that he had a knee injury, they transported him to\nValley Receiving Hospital for an evaluation. During that time,\nPinholster spat in Guzman’s partner’s face, and refused to\nallow doctors to examine his knee. Pinholster kicked and\nbroke one of the glass panes in the x-ray machine. Fourth,\nDeputy Sheriff Michael Loper testified to having “numerous\nrun-ins” with Pinholster in a Los Angeles County Jail. Pinhol-\nster struck Loper as he assisted another deputy in gaining con-\ntrol over Pinholster, who had refused to comply with jail\nrules.\n\n   Fifth, Operations Sergeant Thomas Piggott testified about\nPinholster’s violent reputation and disciplinary record at the\nLos Angeles County Central Jail. He described eleven docu-\nmented incidents of Pinholster’s violence or recalcitrance and\nstated that Pinholster had a reputation of throwing cups of\nurine at the deputies as they walked by his cell. Piggott also\ntestified that he tried to counsel Pinholster, but Pinholster\ninsisted that he wanted to go to prison. Piggott recalled Pin-\nholster saying, “They better send me now, because if they\ndon’t I’ll just go out on the streets and do something to get\nback in, go to prison.”\n\n  Sixth, Theodore Mesquita testified about fighting with Pin-\nholster over a woman Mesquita dated, which resulted in Pin-\nholster cutting Mesquita’s arm with a straight razor, requiring\napproximately fifty stitches. Pinholster’s wife, Cathy Ann\nSmith, testified that Pinholster once broke her jaw while\nseeming to have an epileptic seizure. Finally, Sheriff’s Ser-\n\f4742                  PINHOLSTER v. AYERS\ngeant Joseph Barrett testified that Pinholster told Barrett he\nwould kill Art Corona when released from prison.\n\n   In addition, to minimize the inconvenience of gathering\nwitnesses from San Luis Obispo, Pinholster’s counsel stipu-\nlated that (1) Pinholster’s prior kidnaping conviction involved\na knife, but that no plea bargain governed the knife use allega-\ntion (Pinholster admitted to carrying the knife and placing it\nat the victim’s throat), and (2) Pinholster committed numer-\nous prison disciplinary infractions, including throwing urine\nat and threatening various corrections officers. Counsel stipu-\nlated that Pinholster threatened to stab a corrections officer\nand to throw another corrections officer off of the prison tier.\nPinholster’s disciplinary infractions resulted in the Director of\nCorrections ordering Pinholster to be placed on a special\ndisciplinary diet for a nine-day period in 1979, a procedure\nreserved for only the most disruptive inmates.\n\n   Pinholster’s counsel, Dettmar, waived making an opening\nstatement in the penalty phase of his trial and immediately\ncalled Pinholster’s mother, Burnice Brashear. She testified\nabout Pinholster’s strained relationship with his step-father,\nBud Brashear; Pinholster’s head injury at age two and one-\nhalf years when she ran over him with her car; his head injury\nshortly thereafter when his head cracked the windshield dur-\ning a car accident; his disruptive behavior at school; a psy-\nchologist’s recommendation that Pinholster be committed to\na mental hospital when he was ten; his time in a class for the\nemotionally handicapped; his view of himself as a neighbor-\nhood Robin Hood because he stole things to distribute to the\nneighborhood children; his frequent stays at boys’ homes,\njuvenile halls, and juvenile camps; and his epilepsy, which\nshe believed resulted from a severe beating at age eighteen in\ncounty jail.\n\n                               C\n\n   Following Pinholster’s unsuccessful direct appeal, he initi-\nated habeas proceedings in state and federal court. We detail\n\f                       PINHOLSTER v. AYERS                     4743\nhis submissions with regard to his penalty phase ineffective\nassistance of counsel claim because the State contends that,\nby the time of the federal evidentiary hearing, this claim had\ntransmogrified into a completely new theory for which Pin-\nholster now relies on yet a third set of mental health experts.\n\n                                 1\n\n   Pinholster raised fifty claims for relief in his state habeas\npetition. Relevant to this appeal, Pinholster claims his counsel\nprovided ineffective assistance at the guilt and penalty phases\nof his trial. Regarding his death sentence, he argues that his\ntrial counsel unreasonably failed to investigate, prepare, and\npresent mitigating evidence, and unreasonably presented evi-\ndence that hurt his mitigation case. Had his counsel investi-\ngated mitigating evidence, he contends, his lawyers would\nhave uncovered a wealth of mitigating evidence—a turbulent,\ndysfunctional, violent and abusive home life; serious, well-\ndocumented educational disabilities; and profound mental dis-\norders. To support this claim, Pinholster submitted declara-\ntions from family members and from his trial attorney,\nBrainard; various medical, legal, and school records of Pin-\nholster and his relatives; and a declaration obtained during\nhabeas proceedings from psychiatrist Dr. George Woods.\n\n   Dr. Woods diagnosed Pinholster with a long standing bipo-\nlar mood disorder with psychotic features. Dr. Woods opined\nthat, during the murders, Pinholster was substantially\nimpaired by a bipolar mood disorder operating synergistically\nwith a seizure disorder.7 Dr. Woods also criticized Dr. John\nStalberg’s psychiatric evaluation. Dr. Stalberg had previously\nexamined Pinholster at defense counsel’s request on March\n11, 1984, after trial began. He reviewed case materials sup-\nplied by counsel, including police reports and a probation\nreport. Dr. Stalberg concluded that Pinholster did not manifest\n  7\n  “Seizure disorder” is the medically preferred term for what is com-\nmonly known as epilepsy.\n\f4744                      PINHOLSTER v. AYERS\nby history any significant signs of mental disorder or defect\nother than Antisocial Personality Disorder.8 Dr. Stalberg\nstated he saw no mitigating evidence, and defense counsel\ndecided not to pursue this issue at the time. Habeas counsel\ndisavowed Dr. Stalberg as a credible expert after retaining Dr.\nWoods to criticize Dr. Stalberg’s mid-trial evaluation of Pin-\nholster.\n\n   After the parties filed briefing in the state habeas case, the\nCalifornia Supreme Court issued an order to show cause, but\nsubsequently vacated it as “improvidently granted.” The court\nthen denied the writ “on the substantive ground that it is with-\nout merit.” The California Supreme Court also denied several\nother claims on procedural grounds.\n\n                                     2\n\n   In Pinholster’s first federal habeas petition, he continued to\nmaintain that his trial counsel unreasonably failed to investi-\ngate, prepare, and present mitigating evidence during the pen-\nalty phase. This time, however, Pinholster switched tactics\nand renamed Dr. Stalberg as his psychiatric expert. In April\n1997, Pinholster’s habeas counsel asked Dr. Stalberg to\nreview additional materials pertaining to Pinholster and his\nfamily. Dr. Stalberg reviewed the materials and spoke with\nseveral of Pinholster’s family members. Dr. Stalberg then\nconcluded that knowledge of Pinholster’s family history of\n   8\n     The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM),\nDSM-III, the American Psychiatric Association’s handbook in effect in\n1984 for diagnosing mental disorders, describes Antisocial Personality\nDisorder as a personality disorder with a history of continuous and chronic\nantisocial behavior in which the rights of others are violated, persistence\ninto adult life of a pattern of antisocial behavior that began before the age\nof 15, and failure to sustain good job performance over a period of several\nyears. Lying, stealing, fighting, truancy, and resisting authority are typi-\ncally prevalent in early childhood, and in adulthood these kinds of behav-\nior continue and include the failure to accept social norms with respect to\nlawful behavior.\n\f                      PINHOLSTER v. AYERS                  4745\nsevere psychiatric disorders, Pinholster’s disturbed behavior\nduring childhood, and his irrational and highly aggressive\nactions immediately before the homicides would have caused\nhim to inquire further before concluding that Pinholster\nmerely had a personality disorder. Dr. Stalberg also would\nhave inquired further to determine if the homicides related to\na mental impairment caused by organic/neurological dysfunc-\ntion. Dr. Stalberg now declared that the new information he\nreviewed would have materially modified his previous opin-\nion regarding mitigating circumstances, and that his review\nnow demonstrated the existence of voluminous mitigating\nevidence.\n\n   Because the declaration contained new material facts, the\nparties stipulated that certain claims, including the penalty\nphase ineffective assistance of counsel claim, were unex-\nhausted. The district court allowed Pinholster to exhaust the\nclaims in state court.\n\n                               3\n\n   Pinholster filed a copy of his federal petition and Dr. Stal-\nberg’s new declaration in the California Supreme Court. The\ncourt denied Pinholster’s petition “on the substantive ground\nthat it was without merit” and denied other claims on proce-\ndural grounds.\n\n                               4\n\n   Pinholster filed a “First Amended Petition for Writ of\nHabeas Corpus” in federal court on November 14, 1997. On\nApril 13, 1999, Pinholster filed a request for a federal eviden-\ntiary hearing. Applying pre-Antiterrorism and Effective Death\nPenalty Act (“AEDPA”) standards, the district court granted\nan evidentiary hearing on Pinholster’s penalty phase ineffec-\n\f4746                      PINHOLSTER v. AYERS\ntive assistance of counsel claim, and two other claims not rel-\nevant to this appeal.9\n\n   Dr. Stalberg anticipated testifying as a witness at the fed-\neral evidentiary hearing. Pinholster submitted two new decla-\nrations from Dr. Stalberg to support his amended federal\nhabeas petition. The first, dated January 24, 2000, explained\nthat it was Dr. Stalberg’s custom and practice in 1984 when\nretained by defense counsel in a capital case to form an opin-\nion about a defendant’s mental state during the offense and to\nidentify mitigating circumstances. The second, dated June 5,\n2001, expanded upon and specified the factual bases for the\nopinions Dr. Stalberg previously presented to the district\ncourt. In July 2001, the State Attorney General’s Office\ndeposed Dr. Stalberg. The Deputy Attorney General ques-\ntioned Dr. Stalberg about his earlier declarations, and Pinhol-\nster’s counsel asked Dr. Stalberg to elaborate on various\naspects of his opinions, and to express his opinions about Pin-\nholster’s mental health.\n\n   Dr. Stalberg testified that the additional materials he\nreviewed did not alter his conclusion that Pinholster suffers\nfrom Antisocial Personality Disorder. As a result of this dam-\naging testimony, on May 9, 2002, Pinholster’s current coun-\nsel, the Federal Public Defender, advised Dr. Stalberg that he\nwould no longer call him as a witness during the evidentiary\nhearing, and he no longer considered Dr. Stalberg to be Pin-\nholster’s expert.\n\n   The district court nonetheless proceeded with an evidenti-\nary hearing in September 2002. The Federal Public Defend-\ner’s Office now utilized two new experts—Dr. Sophia\nVinogradov and Dr. Donald Olson—to bolster Pinholster’s\n  9\n    At this time, the district court also granted the State’s motion for sum-\nmary judgment on select claims, including Pinholster’s claims of ineffec-\ntive assistance of counsel at the guilt phase discussed in section III of this\nopinion.\n\f                      PINHOLSTER v. AYERS                  4747\npenalty phase ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Dr.\nVinogradov and Dr. Olson both submitted declarations as\ndirect testimony at the evidentiary hearing. Dr. Vinogradov\nconcluded that Pinholster suffered “personality change,\naggressive type, due to serious childhood head trauma.” Dr.\nOlson, a pediatric neurologist, testified that Pinholster likely\nsuffered brain damage from two head injuries in his early\nchildhood, which created a risk of epilepsy.\n\n   On March 25, 2003, the district court granted Pinholster’s\nhabeas petition and vacated his death sentence. The district\ncourt noted that Pinholster’s attorneys admitted they had not\n“prepared any evidence by way of mitigation,” yet trial coun-\nsel declined an offer for a penalty phase continuance to pre-\npare extenuating evidence. The district court further reasoned\nthat trial counsel called one witness—Pinholster’s mother—\nand her testimony was damaging, incomplete, and inaccurate.\nThe district court found Pinholster’s attorneys’ performance\ndeficient because they failed to adequately investigate miti-\ngating evidence and lacked a reasonable strategic decision for\ntheir failure. The district court ultimately found prejudice\nbased on the significant evidence of Pinholster’s childhood\nabuse and mental impairments, combined with the prosecu-\ntor’s emphasis during summation on the lack of mitigating\nevidence and the length of the jury’s deliberations.\n\n   The district court revisited its March 25, 2003, Order\nGranting Writ of Habeas Corpus, after determining that\nAEDPA applied under Woodford v. Garceau, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"127903\"><a href=\"/opinion/127903/woodford-v-garceau/\"><span class=\"volume\">538</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">202</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(2003). The Supreme Court filed Woodford on the same day\nthe district court had filed its Order. The district court none-\ntheless concluded that: (1) Pinholster timely filed his federal\nhabeas petition; (2) Pinholster was entitled to an evidentiary\nhearing under AEDPA; and (3) AEDPA did not affect its\nOrder granting Pinholster habeas relief because the California\nSupreme Court “did not adjudicate Pinholster’s claim that\ncounsel was ineffective for failing to investigate and present\nmitigating evidence at the penalty phase.”\n\f4748                      PINHOLSTER v. AYERS\n                                    II\n\n  We review de novo the district court’s decision to grant or\ndeny a petition for writ of habeas corpus. Lambert v.

AEDPA requires us to defer to the state court’s\ndetermination of federal issues, unless that determination\nresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an\nunreasonable application of, clearly established federal law,\nas determined by the Supreme Court. 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1).10\nDeference to state court decisions applies only to claims the\nstate court adjudicated on the merits.11 Lambert, 393 F.3d at\n965. De novo review applies if the state court did not reach\n  10\n      The court may also grant a petition where the state court adjudication\nof a claim is based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light\nof the evidence presented in the state court proceeding. 28 U.S.C.\n§ 2254(d)(2). We will address § 2254(d)(2) only when applicable to Pin-\nholster’s appeal.\n   11\n      The district court incorrectly concluded that the California Supreme\nCourt’s decision disposing of Pinholster’s penalty phase ineffective assis-\ntance of counsel claim was not an adjudication on the merits entitled to\ndeference.

Pinholster seeks an evidentiary hearing, arguing that\nhe has provided a colorable claim that his counsel performed\ndeficiently. His primary contention is that his counsel failed\nto adequately investigate the State’s physical evidence placing\nhim at the scene during the murders and this resulted in an\nuninformed decision to have Pinholster testify in his own\ndefense.

The State offered during its case-\nin-chief the following pieces of physical evidence to corrobo-\nrate Corona’s testimony and place Pinholster at the scene of\nthe crime at the time of the murders: (1) investigators found\ndried blood on the bottom of the boots taken from Pinholster’s\ncloset and the sole print matched a bloody boot print near the\nvictims’ bodies; and (2) investigators found a palm print\nmatching Pinholster’s print located within the Kumar resi-\ndence.12 Pinholster contends that trial counsel’s failure to\ninvestigate this evidence constituted deficient performance,\nleading to an ill-advised decision to have Pinholster testify in\nhis own defense, during which he admitted to several incrimi-\nnating facts.\n  12\n    Pinholster requests that we take judicial notice of the following docu-\nments to support his assertion that the State unlawfully destroyed all of the\nphysical evidence after trial: (1) an excerpt of the Master Index with a list\nof the State’s physical evidence; (2) a certificate from the Los Angeles\nCounty Superior Court ordering the exhibits listed on the “non-valuable\nexhibit” list destroyed; and (3) the “non-valuable exhibit” list.

AYERS                  4751\n                               1\n\n   Assuming trial counsel’s failure to investigate the physical\nevidence fell below the objective standard of reasonableness,\nwe nevertheless conclude that the district court properly\ngranted the State’s motion for summary judgment because\nPinholster failed to raise a colorable claim that the deficient\nperformance prejudiced him. See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 697\n(stating that a court may presume ineffective assistance to dis-\npose of a claim on prejudice grounds).\n\n   At the homicide scene, the police detectives discovered\nboot prints left in blood near the victims’ bodies. When exe-\ncuting the search warrant for Pinholster’s apartment, homicide\ndetectives found a pair of black boots that appeared to have\ntread marks that were similar to the prints left at the scene.\nTesting revealed microscopic stains on the boots that gave\npositive reactions for blood. Specifically, investigators\ndetected blood in all of the crevices of the right boot. Crimi-\nnalist Steven Schliebe also testified that the treads on the\nboots taken from Pinholster’s apartment were consistent with\nthe treads that left the boot prints at the crime scene.\n\n   During cross-examination of Detective Coffey—the detec-\ntive who discovered the boots in Pinholster’s apartment—\nPinholster’s counsel asked whether the boots had a common\ntread. The detective responded, “I’m not a boot expert, but I\nhad not seen this type of tread on boots. I have seen other\ntypes of tread. Not to say it’s not common or uncommon. To\nme, I have not seen that type of tread before.” In his habeas\npetition, however, Pinholster offered a declaration from\nCriminalist Schliebe that stated otherwise: Schliebe declared\nthat, “had he been asked if the sole pattern [of Pinholster’s\nboots and the boot prints found at the crime scene were] com-\nmon in the Southern California area,” he would have\nanswered, “the shoe sole pattern is fairly common and is fre-\nquently found on work and sport boots.”\n\f4752                  PINHOLSTER v. AYERS\n   The district court denied Pinholster’s claim of ineffective\nassistance of counsel for lack of prejudice. It reasoned that\n“the boot that was found in [Pinholster’s] home had a trace of\nblood on it[,] which distinguishes it from other boots with the\nsame tread.” The district court also denied Pinholster’s claim\nthat trial counsel were ineffective for eliciting Detective Cof-\nfey’s opinion that the boot print was uncommon. It reasoned\nthat Detective Coffey “never testified that the boot print was\nuncommon”; rather, he “stated that he had not seen the sole\npattern before” and “clarified that he was not a boot print\nexpert.”\n\n   The second piece of physical evidence was a palm print\nlifted from a closet door frame in the Kumar residence that\nmatched a palm print later taken from Pinholster. During\ndirect examination, the fingerprint expert testified that he con-\nducted two prior identification attempts before he was able to\nconclusively determine that the print lifted from the door\nmatched Pinholster’s. The expert explained that the palm print\nlifted from the closet door came from the far outside portion\nof the left palm. In the two prior attempts, the lab used exem-\nplar cards that excluded the outside portion of the palm. Nor-\nmally, when a person is palm printed, the palm is laid flat on\nthe exemplar card. Therefore, as the expert testified, “it was\nnot until [Detective] Coffey provided [his] office with this\nexemplar card with the palm prints, and also a roll of the far\nleft-hand side, that [he was] able to find the area that matched\nup with the print that [he] lifted from the door frame.”\n\n   Pinholster argues that his trial counsel were ineffective for\nfailing to independently test the palm print. In support of his\nargument, Pinholster offered a declaration of an independent\nfingerprint expert, Clarence Collins. After examining both the\nlifted print and the rolled palm print taken from Pinholster,\nCollins concluded that the prints “were not made by the same\nperson.” In addition, Pinholster offers a declaration taken\nfrom Brainard stating that, “[h]ad I known Scott Pinholster\ndid not deposit the latent print found at the Kumar residence,\n\f                           PINHOLSTER v. AYERS                             4753\nI would have conducted the defense differently, and would\nhave appropriately changed my advice to my client. I proba-\nbly would have advised Scott Pinholster not to testify during\n[the] guilt phase.”\n\n   The district court denied Pinholster’s request for an eviden-\ntiary hearing on the basis that he again failed to show preju-\ndice. First, Pinholster admitted that he was inside Kumar’s\nresidence on the night of the murders. Second, Pinholster’s\ntrial counsel merely stated that he probably would have\nadvised Pinholster not to testify.13 This does not necessarily\nshow that Pinholster’s admission would not otherwise have\nbeen made. The record is quite clear that Pinholster was eager\nto take the stand so he could convince the jury that, although\nhe saw himself as a professional thief who preyed on drug\ndealers, his modus operandi was to carry a gun, not to stab his\nvictims with knives.\n\n   [2] We agree with the district court and hold that Pinholster\nfailed to show a colorable claim that he was prejudiced by\ntrial counsel’s alleged failure to independently investigate the\nState’s physical evidence. Despite Pinholster’s contention,\nCollins’s declaration does not prove that the State’s finger-\nprint expert was lying or misinformed. At most, it creates a\nbattle of the experts.14 Moreover, the jury heard the State’s\n  13\n      We are not holding, nor do we think the district court found, that Pin-\nholster’s counsel’s statement that he “probably” would not have advised\nPinholster to testify is sufficient to establish that counsel’s failure to inves-\ntigate was non-prejudicial. See Dissent Op. at 4785 n.2. Indeed, Pinholster\nuses counsel’s declaration to argue that he was prejudiced. Pinholster\nargues that had his trial counsel investigated the palm print he would have\nknown there was a discrepancy and therefore never would have advised\nPinholster to testify. Pinholster argues that without his testimony there was\nno evidence that he was in Kumar’s residence at the time of the murders\nand therefore counsel’s failure to investigate was prejudicial. As we dis-\ncuss infra these arguments are simply unpersuasive as there was a wealth\nof other evidence proving Pinholster’s presence in the Kumar residence.\n   14\n      Contrary to the dissent’s assertion, we are not saying that the existence\nof a “battle of the experts” reduces any prejudice resulting from counsel’s\n\f4754                      PINHOLSTER v. AYERS\nfingerprint expert testify that he could not match Pinholster’s\nprint until the third attempt. Although Pinholster argues that\nthe “State’s expert was pressured to find a match,” no evi-\ndence supports such a contention. In addition, the State pre-\nsented the palm print evidence to place Pinholster in the\nKumar residence at the time of the murders. This evidence\nwas cumulative as Corona testified that Pinholster was in the\nKumar residence at the time of the murders, and substantial\nportions of Corona’s testimony were corroborated by Lisa\nTapar, her father, and Casey Corona. Pinholster’s admission\nto the jury that he was inside Kumar’s house at some point\nthat night further convinces us that the alleged ineffectiveness\ndid not prejudice him. Therefore, we hold that the jury’s ver-\ndict would not have been affected even if Pinholster’s trial\ncounsel had conducted an independent investigation and\nintroduced evidence that the palm print was not Pinholster’s.\n\n   [3] Pinholster also failed to show a colorable claim that he\nwas prejudiced by trial counsel’s failure to investigate the\nboot prints. The State did not argue that this evidence con-\nnected Pinholster to the crime because the sole prints were\nunique; rather, the state argued that this evidence connected\nPinholster to the crime scene because (1) the sole prints were\nconsistent, and (2) Pinholster’s boots were found to have\ntraces of human blood on the bottom. Therefore, even if the\njury heard evidence that the sole prints were common in\nSouthern California, this would not have changed the verdict.\nPinholster offers no other evidence to suggest that the boot\nprint evidence was faulty.\n\n                                     2\n\n  Because we conclude that Pinholster failed to raise a color-\nable claim that he was prejudiced by trial counsel’s failure to\n\nfailure to investigate the palm print. See Dissent at 4785 n.2. We are sim-\nply saying that Collins’s declaration creates only a battle of the experts;\nit does not prove Pinholster’s contention that the State’s expert was misin-\nformed, improperly influenced, or lying.\n\f                      PINHOLSTER v. AYERS                   4755\ninvestigate the State’s physical evidence, we cannot conclude\nthat trial counsel’s decision to advise Pinholster to testify in\nhis own defense amounted to ineffective assistance. The dis-\nsent is ensnared in the trap of 20/20 hindsight. It fails to give\na sufficient level of deference to counsel’s judgments given\nthe evidence and the type of defense Pinholster wanted to pur-\nsue. See Rompilla v.

When reviewing ineffective assis-\ntance of counsel claims that question the attorney’s trial strat-\negy, it is important to “note that a defendant’s Sixth\nAmendment rights are his alone, and that trial counsel, while\nheld to a standard of ‘reasonable effectiveness,’ is still only\nan assistant to the defendant and not the master of the\ndefense.” Mulligan v.

The reasonableness of counsel’s chosen trial strategy\ndepends critically “on informed strategic choices made by the\ndefendant and on information supplied by the defendant.”\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 691. The record amply demonstrates\nthat this strategic tactical decision was deliberate and consid-\nered. Pinholster actively participated in all key decisions, as\nhe represented himself pro se at one point before the trial, and\nstrongly directed the strategy he wished counsel to pursue.\n\n   The record shows that Pinholster directed his trial counsel\nto pursue an alibi defense on his behalf. On June 24, 1983, the\ntrial court held a hearing on a motion to dismiss filed by Pin-\nholster while representing himself. Pinholster argued that his\nfirst appointed trial counsel, Marvin Part, coerced him into\nwaiving his right to a speedy trial. During the hearing, Pinhol-\n\f4756                     PINHOLSTER v. AYERS\nster called Part to testify, waiving his attorney-client privilege.\nPinholster questioned why Part refused to interview possible\nalibi witnesses in the face of physical evidence linking Pin-\nholster to the crime scene. Pinholster’s insistent decision to\npursue an alibi defense necessarily impacted his counsel’s\ntrial strategy.15\n\n   Even without the physical evidence, the State presented\noverwhelming evidence that Pinholster was at the Kumar resi-\ndence on the day of the murders. Corona’s testimony not only\nplaced Pinholster at the scene during the murders, but it also\ndetailed Pinholster’s participation in the murders. Several\nother witnesses corroborated Corona’s testimony.\n\n   [4] In light of the evidence placing Pinholster at the scene,\nPinholster’s failure to show prejudice from his trial counsel’s\nfailure to investigate the physical evidence, and Pinholster’s\nstrong desire to pursue an alibi defense, we cannot second\nguess trial counsel’s decision to advise Pinholster to testify.16\nIn Strickland, the Court recognized that “[c]ounsel’s actions\nare usually based . . . on informed strategic choices made by\nthe defendant and on information supplied by the defendant.”\n466 U.S. at 691. To support Pinholster’s alibi defense, trial\ncounsel needed to explain the overwhelming evidence prov-\n  15\n    Brainard declared:\n      The strategy decided upon prior to trial was to demonstrate Scott\n      committed robberies and not burglaries, and that Scott used guns,\n      not knives, as weapons. I assumed Scott would admit to having\n      committed a few robberies, not hundreds, although we never\n      explicitly discussed the number. Part of [the] strategy decided\n      upon prior to trial was to admit the Croutch robbery during trial.\n   16\n      The dissent assumes that trial counsel never advised “Pinholster\nagainst testifying, because the jury would likely conclude he was lying.”\nSee Dissent at 4786. There is a dearth of evidence in the record detailing\nany discussion between trial counsel and Pinholster about his decision to\ntestify during the guilt phase. Pinholster does not allege, and there is no\nevidence to support, the dissent’s assumption that trial counsel neglected\nto discuss the risks of testifying with their client.\n\f                          PINHOLSTER v. AYERS                          4757\ning that Pinholster intended to rob the Kumar residence on the\nnight of the murders. In other words, counsel needed Pinhol-\nster to tell his version of the events—that he was a robber, not\na burglar, and that he used guns, not knives. Given the evi-\ndence presented by the State, trial counsel’s tactical decision\nto advise Pinholster to testify was reasonable. See id. Such a\ndecision does not amount to constitutionally deficient perfor-\nmance. To declare that it was wrong because in hindsight it\nproved unsuccessful and must have been uninformed is not\nwhat the Supreme Court intended when we analyze a Strick-\nland claim after the fact.\n\n                                     B\n\n   We also conclude that Pinholster has failed to present a col-\norable claim that he was prejudiced by the other alleged\ninstances of ineffective assistance of counsel during the guilt\nphase of his trial.\n\n                                     1\n\n   One alleged instance concerned Art Corona’s police inter-\nview. Through stipulation of counsel, the State introduced the\nunredacted tape recording and transcription of Corona’s\npolice interview. During the interview, Corona claimed that\nPinholster admitted involvement in the shooting of two “wet-\nbacks,” that he had beaten an elderly woman, was involved in\na cocaine “rip-off,” sold drugs, committed robberies, and had\naffiliated with white supremacist prison gangs.17\n\n   The California Supreme Court rejected Pinholster’s ineffec-\ntive assistance of counsel claim, concluding that trial counsel\nhad a “rational tactical reason” for deciding not to object to\nadmission of the entire interview. Pinholster, 824 P.2d at 604.18\n  17\n     Trial counsel did not object to replaying the tape during deliberations,\nor allowing the jury to keep the transcript while deliberating.\n  18\n     Unlike Pinholster’s other ineffective assistance of counsel claims, the\nCalifornia Supreme Court reached the merits of this claim in the direct\nappeal. It therefore constitutes the “last reasoned decision” of the state\ncourt. See Shackleford, 234 F.3d at 1079 n.2.\n\f4758                  PINHOLSTER v. AYERS\nThe court reasoned that “[Pinholster] needed to create an\nimpression of candor to carry his testimony that he had bro-\nken into the Kumar house on the night of the murder[s], but\nhad stolen the drugs and left before Corona arrived and\nstabbed the murder victims.” Id. Pinholster himself testified\nabout his violent criminal past and the references that Corona\nmade to specific instances “simply confirmed what [Pinhol-\nster] was willing to say about himself.” Id.\n\n   The California Supreme Court called Corona’s reference to\nthe Aryan Brotherhood “clearly innocuous,” as Corona testi-\nfied that it was Brown who was affiliated with the group, not\nPinholster. Id. Moreover, the interview could reasonably be\nseen as favorable to Pinholster’s defense. “[T]he tape con-\ntained statements inconsistent with Corona’s trial testimony,\nshowed Corona’s eagerness to cooperate with the police, and\ncontained some reference to Corona’s contact with one\n‘Butch,’ who [Pinholster] claimed was Corona’s actual\naccomplice.” Id. The district court denied Pinholster’s motion\nfor an evidentiary hearing because certain aspects of the tape\nwere “beneficial to Pinholster’s case” and therefore trial coun-\nsel “arguably were not deficient for failing to object to it.”\nThe district court concluded that admitting the tape was not\nprejudicial because the case against Pinholster was strong and\nthe prosecution successfully discredited his defense.\n\n   [5] Whether counsel’s actions constituted a “tactical” deci-\nsion is a question of fact, and we must decide whether the\nstate court made an unreasonable determination of the facts in\nlight of the evidence before it. See Edwards v. Lamarque, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"796729\"><a href=\"/opinion/796729/kristopher-c-edwards-v-a-lamarque-warden/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1121</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1126 (9th Cir. 2007) (en banc) (citing Taylor v.\nMaddox, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786028\"><a href=\"/opinion/786028/leif-taylor-v-thomas-m-maddox-interim-director-george-galaza-cal-terhune/\"><span class=\"volume\">366</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">992</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 999-1000 (9th Cir. 2004)). For the\nreasons expressed by the district court, we hold that the Cali-\nfornia Supreme Court’s conclusion that counsel made a tacti-\ncal decision to admit the entire tape was not an unreasonable\ndetermination of fact.

Detective Cof-\nfey testified that Terry Pinholster, Pinholster’s brother, said\nScott Pinholster’s arrest was “no big deal” because his brother\nhad been arrested for murder before. Pinholster argues that\nbecause he had never before been arrested or charged with\nmurder, his trial counsel had no tactical basis for failing to\nobject to this statement. The district court granted summary\njudgment to the State on this issue, concluding that Pinholster\nhad failed to show prejudice as the jury had “already heard\nthat [Pinholster] was involved in a shoot-out in which two\n‘wetbacks’ had been killed. The jury could easily have sur-\nmised that [Pinholster] was arrested for murder as a result of\nthat incident.”\n\n   [6] Trial counsel’s failure to object to this evidence raises\nconcerns: The portion of the Corona tape discussing the “wet-\nback” murders and the hearsay statement of Pinholster’s\nbrother undermine the heart of Pinholster’s defense—that he\nis a robber not a murderer. Nevertheless, because the Califor-\nnia Supreme Court’s decision regarding the Corona tape was\nobjectively reasonable, it cannot be said that Pinholster suf-\nfered prejudice from admission of his brother’s statement. As\nthe district court reasoned, it is likely the jury put the two\ntogether, making his brother’s statement no more prejudicial\nthan admission of the “wetback” statement.\n\n                               3\n\n  Pinholster contends that his trial counsel were ineffective\nby admitting into evidence a prior felony conviction for kid-\nnaping after the trial court granted a motion in limine to pro-\nhibit the State from using the evidence on cross-examination.\n\f4760                        PINHOLSTER v. AYERS\nIn a declaration filed with Pinholster’s state and federal\nhabeas petitions, Brainard admitted that he “d[id] not recall\nwhy [he] elicited Scott Pinholster’s kidnapping conviction\nafter the court ruled that this conviction was inadmissible for\nimpeachment purposes.”\n\n   Brainard’s question opened the door for the prosecution to\nquestion Pinholster about prior offenses in which he used a\nknife rather than a gun. The trial court—without objection\nfrom Pinholster’s attorneys—allowed the State to recall Pin-\nholster to the stand and question him as to whether he used\na knife during the course of the kidnaping. Pinholster testified\nthat he pled guilty to using a knife but denied actually having\nused the knife during the commission of the offense.\nAlthough use of a knife is alleged in the criminal information,\nit was not a term of the plea agreement.19 Brainard filed a dec-\nlaration stating that he could “not recall whether [he] knew\nthe knife enhancement allegation was not found true.”\n\n   [7] We hold that Pinholster has failed to show a colorable\nclaim that he was prejudiced by his trial counsel’s allegedly\ndeficient performance. The jury heard other evidence that Pin-\nholster possessed knives, including his own admission that he\nused a buck knife to vandalize Lisa Tapar’s car on the night\nof the murders. The district court properly denied Pinholster\nan evidentiary hearing on this ineffective assistance of coun-\nsel claim.\n  19\n    The colloquy during the change of plea hearing went as follows:\n       The court: Mr. Pinholster, Count I of the information charges\n                   that on August 21st of last year you kidnapped a\n                   person named Jena, J-e-n-a, Rae, R-a-e, Burdett, B-\n                   u-r-d-e-t-t; that is, that you forcefully took her from\n                   one place to another. Do you understand that\n                   charge?\n       Pinholster: Yes, sir.\n       The court: Is that what you did?\n       Pinholster: Yes, sir.\n\f                     PINHOLSTER v. AYERS                  4761\n                              4\n\n   Charles Kempf testified that during an aborted robbery\nattempt at Kumar’s residence Pinholster bragged about stab-\nbing an unidentified individual in the rectum. Pinholster con-\ntends that his trial counsel were ineffective for failing to\nobject to Kempf’s statement and failing to impeach Kempf\nwith a prior statement in which he claims that Pinholster’s\nfriend did the stabbing.\n\n   [8] Pinholster cannot make out a colorable claim that he\nwas prejudiced by the admission of this evidence. During his\nown testimony, which was dramatic and unusual in the candor\nPinholster displayed in bragging about his life of crime, Pin-\nholster admitted to several violent acts and the evidence pres-\nented against him was overwhelming. The California\nSupreme Court so found, see Pinholster, 824 P.2d at 601,\n604, and we cannot say that the district court erred by failing\nto grant an evidentiary hearing.\n\n                              5\n\n   During rebuttal, Eric Klemetti testified that he purchased\nmarijuana from Johnson at the Kumar residence around 9\np.m. on the night of the murders. To impeach his credibility,\nPinholster’s trial counsel asked Klemetti whether he had ever\ncommitted a burglary with Pinholster, and whether he had\nacted as an informant during that case. Pinholster argues that\nthis amounted to ineffective assistance because the conviction\nundercut his testimony that he committed robberies rather\nthan burglaries and was otherwise inadmissible.\n\n   [9] We agree with the district court. Trial counsel made a\nrational tactical decision to impeach Klemetti’s testimony\nwith this evidence as the witness would have otherwise gone\nunchallenged. Moreover, Pinholster failed to show prejudice\nbecause he had already admitted that he burglarized Kumar’s\nresidence on the night of the murders.\n\f4762                  PINHOLSTER v. AYERS\n                               6\n\n   Pinholster challenges his trial counsel’s decision to admit\nevidence that the police had recovered narcotics during the\nsearch of his apartment. He also claims ineffective assistance\ndue to his trial counsel’s failure to exclude evidence that he\nhad thrown a gun from the window of a different apartment\nwhile the police executed a search warrant on his apartment.\nAlthough his trial counsel challenged the officers’ identifica-\ntion of Pinholster, Pinholster admitted during cross-\nexamination that he threw the gun.\n\n   [10] The district court concluded that (1) Pinholster failed\nto show prejudice, as he admitted to using drugs and possess-\ning guns in his testimony; (2) that even without Pinholster’s\ntestimony, the narcotics evidence was not prejudicial, as the\njury heard from other sources, including Corona, that Pinhol-\nster used drugs; and (3) that though trial counsel attempted to\nchallenge the officers’ identification of Pinholster as the man\nwho threw the gun, it is reasonable to believe that the jury\nfound the officers’ testimony credible. We agree and hold that\nthe district court properly denied Pinholster’s request for an\nevidentiary hearing.\n\n                               7\n\n   Pinholster argues that trial counsel were ineffective for ask-\ning prospective jurors questions about white supremacist\ngangs such as the Aryan Brotherhood. The district court con-\ncluded that trial counsel were not deficient because they knew\nthe Corona tape contained references to the Aryan Brother-\nhood, and they made a tactical decision to forewarn the jurors\nthat the subject might arise. On appeal, Pinholster argues that\ntrial counsel were ineffective for failing to object when the\nprosecution returned to this theme throughout the guilt phase\nof the trial.\n\n   [11] Pinholster has again failed to make a colorable claim\nthat he was prejudiced by the alleged deficient performance.\n\f                          PINHOLSTER v. AYERS                         4763\nGiven the strong evidence against Pinholster, it is not reason-\nably probable that trial counsel’s failure to exclude all refer-\nences to Pinholster’s connection to white supremacists\naffected the verdict.\n\n                                    IV\n\n   We now turn to the State’s appeal. The State contends that\nthe district court improperly found, based on evidence not\nbefore the state court, that Pinholster’s trial counsel inade-\nquately investigated and deficiently presented mitigating evi-\ndence at the penalty phase. We hold that Pinholster properly\nexhausted his ineffective assistance of counsel claim, and that\nany error the district court may have committed in holding an\nevidentiary hearing is harmless because, even with the evi-\ndence presented at the hearing, Pinholster has not shown that\nhe was prejudiced by counsel’s failure to offer additional mit-\nigating evidence.20\n\n                                    A\n\n   A state prisoner must exhaust all available remedies in state\ncourt before a federal court may grant him habeas relief. 28\nU.S.C. § 2254(b)(1)(A); O’Sullivan v.

The California Supreme Court\nhad a sufficient opportunity to hear Pinholster’s claim of inef-\nfective assistance of counsel at the penalty phase. Throughout\nthe habeas proceedings, Pinholster has continued to press the\nsame legal claim (ineffective assistance at the penalty phase)\nand the same factual basis (e.g., counsel failed to present sig-\nnificant mitigating evidence and, instead, presented harmful,\nfalse evidence at the penalty phase). The federal and state\npetitions detail many identical facts. Both describe trial coun-\nsel’s failure to seek a continuance to prepare for the penalty\nphase; counsel’s introduction of Mrs. Brashear’s testimony;\nPinholster’s childhood home life; and Pinholster’s back-\nground, including his educational, medical, psychological,\nsocial, and family history. Pinholster did not, as the State con-\ntends, “present vague and conclusory constitutional claims in\nthe state court, phrased with sweeping generality and sup-\nported by skimpy factual allegations.”\n\n   [13] Though during the proceedings Pinholster relied on\ndifferent experts with differing mental impairment theories,\nthe evolving theories have not significantly changed the evi-\ndentiary basis for his arguments. These experts relied on the\nsame background information Pinholster presented to the state\ncourt, and their testimonies represent only a fragment of the\nmitigating evidence submitted in the state habeas proceedings.\nAccordingly, the facts adduced at the evidentiary hearing\nhave not fundamentally altered the legal claim the California\nSupreme Court already considered and rejected, and we con-\n\f                          PINHOLSTER v.

See Dissent at 4802.\n\f                         PINHOLSTER v. AYERS                        4767\ndence. We are heavily influenced by the damage Pinholster\ndid to himself when he took the stand in the guilt phase and\ntestified to an unrepentant life of violent crime.\n\n   [14] During the state and federal habeas proceedings, Pin-\nholster submitted evidence to the state court showing that he\nsuffered years of significant neglect and physical and emo-\ntional abuse as a child. Pinholster’s step-father, Bud Brashear,\nfrequently beat Pinholster with his fists, a belt, or anything\nelse available, including a two-by-four board. Moreover, Pin-\nholster presented evidence during the habeas proceedings that,\nbecause he resembled his biological father, he was severely\nbeaten by his grandparents.\n\n   Pinholster painted somewhat of a different picture during a\nJuly 16, 1991, interview with a defense investigator Sheryl\nDuvall, who at the time worked as an independent Criminal\nJustice Consultant. She was hired by an attorney named Leon-\nard Tauman to prepare a social history on Pinholster. As\nreflected in her interview notes, Pinholster discussed his\nsocial history, including his relationship with various family\nmembers.24 Pinholster rejected his mother’s claim that his\nstep-father “abused” him growing up. Although he admitted\nthat his step-father used a homemade paddle freely on him\nand his brothers, Pinholster claimed that they “benefitted”\nfrom the “discipline.” Pinholster’s primary complaint about\n   24\n      The district court refused to consider statements made in Duvall’s\ninterview notes on the basis that the notes constituted inadmissible hear-\nsay. However, the parties stipulated to the admission of these interview\nnotes during the evidentiary hearing; Pinholster’s habeas counsel made no\nobjection based on hearsay. See United States v. Foster, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"421208\"><a href=\"/opinion/421208/united-states-v-gregory-foster-johnnie-lee-gibson-billy-jackson-ronald/\"><span class=\"volume\">711</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">871</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 877\n(9th Cir. 1983) (stating that, where there is no objection to hearsay evi-\ndence, “such evidence is to be given its natural probative effect as if it\nwere in law admissible” (internal quotation marks omitted)). Furthermore,\nthe Supreme Court has instructed us to “ ‘evaluate the totality of the\nevidence—both that adduced at trial, and the evidence adduced in the\nhabeas proceeding[s].’ ” Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 536 (quoting Williams, 529\nU.S. at 397-98)).\n\f4768                       PINHOLSTER v. AYERS\nhis step-father was that “he didn’t seem to want the kids\naround.”\n\n   Although Pinholster presented evidence of physical abuse\nfrom his maternal grandmother, Pinholster claimed that he\nand his maternal grandfather were very close. He spent sum-\nmers with his grandparents, working on their chicken farm.\nHe claimed that his “[grandfather] was affectionate with the\nboys. He made them work hard on the farm but he was quick\nto praise their efforts.” Pinholster’s grandfather made him feel\ngood about himself. When Duvall asked Pinholster whether\nhe believed his life would have been different had his grand-\nfather lived, Pinholster responded “definitely.” He claimed\nthat, after his first arrest, he would have been sent to live with\nhis grandparents. These sentiments were supported in a medi-\ncal report developed upon Pinholster’s release from the Cam-\narillo State Hospital in 1971 when Pinholster was eleven-\nyears-old. Pinholster was reported as being “very close” to his\nmaternal grandfather, with his grandfather’s death being an\n“emotional shock.”\n\n   During the interview with Duvall in 1991, Pinholster also\ndescribed his relationship with his mother, Mrs. Brashear. He\nclaimed that he always “felt very close to his mother,” and he\nhad nothing but praise for her. He stated that “[s]he’s always\nbeen supportive of all the kids. She’s always the first there\nand last to leave. She always had a hot dinner on the table.”\nAt the time of the interview, Pinholster remained in close con-\ntact with his mother.25\n  25\n    The dissent questions our consideration of Pinholster’s description of\nhis social history. See Dissent at 4794. We are not crediting Pinholster’s\ndescription of the events over that of other family members. We recognize\nthat Pinholster was likely beaten and abused by both his step-father and\nmaternal grandmother. While we in no way condone such treatment of any\nchild, our role in these inquiries is to try and assess the extent of the miti-\ngating evidence as it relates to the potential prejudice to Pinholster. In\ndoing so, Pinholster’s own perception of his childhood and its affect on\nhim is certainly relevant. We also find relevant the fact that Pinholster’s\npaternal grandfather provided some stability during Pinholster’s early\nchildhood.\n\f                      PINHOLSTER v. AYERS                  4769\n   [15] In addition, the jury did hear some mitigating evidence\nfrom Pinholster’s mother during her penalty phase testimony.\nWe recognize that Mrs. Brashear inaccurately portrayed her-\nself as a dedicated, caring mother, and, indeed, she failed to\npresent Pinholster’s troubled childhood and mental and emo-\ntional problems in the most compelling manner. Nonetheless,\nthe jury heard mitigating facts from her testimony. Mrs.\nBrashear described Pinholster’s strained relationship with his\nstep-father, conceding that Bud Brashear’s attempts to disci-\npline Pinholster sometimes rose to the level of abuse.\n\n   On cross-examination, she admitted that her daughter,\nTammy Brashear, was currently on probation, and that her\nother son, Alvin Pinholster, died after attempting to evade the\nauthorities. Mrs. Brashaer recounted an accident when she ran\nover Pinholster (who was a toddler) with her car, nearly tear-\ning off one of Pinholster’s ears and causing a shoulder injury\nthat required just over a week in the hospital. She also dis-\ncussed Pinholster’s second head injury resulting from another\ncar accident; a psychologist’s recommendation to commit\nPinholster to a mental hospital at age ten; his time in a class\nfor emotionally handicapped children; and his epilepsy, which\nshe believed resulted from a severe beating at age eighteen in\ncounty jail. The penalty phase verdict reflects the jury’s obvi-\nous rejection of such mitigating circumstances in light of all\nthat Pinholster had said and done as a recidivist and the bru-\ntality of these robbery/murders.\n\n   [16] It is unlikely Pinholster’s evidence of mental impair-\nment would have had a significant impact on the jury. As a\ntoddler, Pinholster was in two separate car accidents that\nallegedly resulted in head injuries, and throughout his child-\nhood and early adolescence, Pinholster displayed symptoms\nof and received treatment for epilepsy. Nevertheless, the\nexperts’ opinions about Pinholster’s psychological impair-\nments and whether these impairments resulted from a head\ninjury have varied considerably, becoming somewhat of a\n\f4770                      PINHOLSTER v. AYERS\nmoving target for the California Supreme Court and federal\ncourts on habeas review.\n\n   The California Supreme Court has denied two habeas peti-\ntions, one in which Pinholster relied on Dr. Woods as his\nexpert, and another in which he relied on Dr. Stalberg as his\nexpert. Dr. Woods opined that, during the murders, Pinholster\nwas substantially impaired by a bipolar mood disorder operat-\ning synergistically with a seizure disorder. Declining to pre-\nsent Dr. Woods’s diagnosis,26 Pinholster rehired Dr. Stalberg\nas his expert for the second state habeas petition. Dr. Stalberg\nstated that he had reviewed the materials presented by Pinhol-\nster’s habeas counsel and that, had he known of “Pinholster’s\nfamily history of severe psychiatric disorders, his disturbed\nbehavior during childhood, and his irrational and highly\naggressive actions immediately before the homicides,” he\nwould have “ma[de] further inquiry before concluding that\n[Pinholster] had merely a personality disorder.” He further\nstated that “[t]he new material” would have “materially modi-\nfied [his] opinion regarding mitigating circumstances.” After\nthe California Supreme Court again denied Pinholster’s\nhabeas petition, he appeared ready to proceed to federal court\nwith Dr. Stalberg as his expert.\n   26\n      None of the other experts agreed with Dr. Woods’s diagnosis of bipo-\nlar mood disorder. In his June 2001 declaration, Dr. Stalberg stated that\nPinholster “was substantially impaired by a bipolar mood disorder operat-\ning synergistically with intoxication and a seizure disorder at the time the\ncrime was committed.” However, during the evidentiary hearing, Dr. Stal-\nberg rejected that statement as his own testimony. He stated, “I never said\nthat and never testified to [Pinholster having bipolar mood disorder].”\nSubsequently, in August 2002, Dr. Stalberg filed another declaration in\nwhich he stated simply that Dr. Woods’s diagnosis of bipolar mood disor-\nder was “incorrect.” Dr. David Rudnick, a neuropsychiatrist who served\nas an expert for the State during the federal evidentiary hearing, stated in\nhis declaration of July 11, 2001, that “[t]here is no evidence for the diag-\nnosis of bipolar disorder at any time in Mr. Pinholster’s life.” Similarly,\nDr. Vinogradov stated that she found “no clear information supporting\ntrue full-blown hypomanic or depressive episodes.”\n\f                         PINHOLSTER v. AYERS                         4771\n   On June 5, 2001, Dr. Stalberg executed a more detailed\ndeclaration in which he stated that the penalty phase testi-\nmony of Mrs. Brashear was “profoundly misleading” as she\nfailed to truthfully describe Pinholster’s early childhood,\nwhich “was marked by significant deprivation, physical\nabuse, and extreme neglect.” Dr. Stalberg again acknowl-\nedged that Pinholster likely suffers from a seizure disorder,\nand went on to opine that some of the violent incidents in Pin-\nholster’s past—the breaking of his wife’s jaw and his assault\non Officer Kaufman—could have been attributed to his sei-\nzure disorder.\n\n   After Dr. Stalberg refused, despite all of the new mitigating\nevidence, to alter his diagnosis of Antisocial Personality Dis-\norder, Pinholster’s habeas counsel informed him that he\nwould no longer be serving as their expert. Instead, in support\nof his amended federal habeas petition, Pinholster choose to\nrely on the new expert testimony of Dr. Vinogradov and Dr.\nOlson. Dr. Olson concluded that “it is reasonably probable\nthat Mr. Pinholster has suffered from partial epilepsy since at\nleast 1968.” In support of his conclusion, Dr. Olson relied on\nthe two head injuries Pinholster suffered as a child, Pinhol-\nster’s abnormal EEG at age nine,27 the descriptions of Pinhol-\nster’s seizures provided by other witnesses, and Pinholster’s\ntreatment for seizures with standard anti-seizure medication.\n\n   Dr. Vinogradov relied on the same evidence as the other\nexperts and conducted two face-to-face interviews with Pin-\nholster. She implicitly rejected Dr. Woods’s diagnosis, stating\nthere was “no clear information supporting true full-blown\nhypomanic or depressive episodes.” However, she diagnosed\nPinholster with “personality change, aggressive type, due to\n  27\n    Dr. Rudnick testified that Pinholster’s abnormal EEG in 1968 could\nhave been caused by his Attention Deficient Hyperactivity Disorder, or by\nthe fact that he was only nine-years-old at the time. As Dr. Rudnick\ndescribed, maturation of the brain is “characterized by a reduction in slow\nwave activity of the same frequencies observed” in Pinholster.\n\f4772                      PINHOLSTER v. AYERS\nserious childhood head trauma.” She opined that, “[o]n the\nnight of the crimes, while intoxicated on multiple substances,\nMr. Pinholster experienced perceptual aberrations and possi-\nble psychotic symptoms.”\n\n   [17] The dissent believes that Pinholster has presented evi-\ndence of “substantial neurological and emotional disorders.”\nDissent at 4794. However, the only constant with regard to\nthe evolving defense expert testimony has been Dr. Stalberg’s\ndiagnosis of Antisocial Personality Disorder and the experts’\nagreement that it is reasonably probable that Pinholster suf-\nfered from epilepsy.28 The California Supreme Court has\nfaced a revolving door of experts, each presenting his or her\nown theory on Pinholster’s mental health. Although we have\nno pronounced reason to question the credibility of Pinhol-\nster’s new experts, we conclude that no newly-minted expert\ntheory to explain his behavior would have made a difference\nin the face of what Pinholster said and did.\n\n  Though the Supreme Court has recently highlighted\ndefense counsel’s constitutional duty to adequately investigate\nmitigating evidence, we cannot say from the record either\nbefore the state or federal district court that it was objectively\n   28\n      Dr. Rudnick agreed with Dr. Stalberg’s diagnosis and also noted in his\ndeclaration that John Geiger, M.D., a staff psychiatrist at San Quentin\nState Prison, diagnosed Pinholster with Antisocial Personality Disorder\nand concluded that his violent behavior was “approximately that of the\naverage condemned area inmate.” Charles E. Steinke, Ph.D., a staff psy-\nchologist at San Quentin, also agreed with Dr. Geiger’s diagnosis of Anti-\nsocial Personality Disorder. We have previously noted that a diagnosis of\nAntisocial Personality Disorder is “potentially more harmful to [a] peti-\ntioner than [helpful].” Gerlaugh v.

AYERS                   4773\nunreasonable for the California Supreme Court to deny relief.\nWhile trial counsel could have presented more detailed miti-\ngating evidence—in the form of Pinholster’s social history\nand mental health history—that evidence falls short when\ncompared to the mitigating evidence available in Williams,\nWiggins, and Rompilla, and the overwhelming evidence in\naggravation which Pinholster faced.\n\n   In Williams, had counsel performed effectively the jury\nwould have learned that Williams’s parents were imprisoned\nfor criminal neglect; Williams’s father repeatedly beat him;\nWilliams was borderline mentally retarded and had not\nadvanced beyond sixth grade; and, while in prison, Williams\nhelped crack a prison drug ring, he returned a prison guard’s\nmissing wallet, and prison officials testified that he was the\nleast likely to act violently out of all the inmates. 529 U.S. at\n395-96. As the Supreme Court emphasized, this mitigating\nevidence coupled with the evidence the jury did hear—that\n“Williams turned himself in, alerting police to a crime they\notherwise would never have discovered, express[ed] remorse\nfor his actions, and cooperat[ed] with the police after that”—\ncould have influenced the jury’s view of Williams’s moral\nculpability. Id. at 398. In Williams, the additional mitigating\nevidence tended to show that Williams’s “violent behavior\nwas a compulsive reaction rather than a product of cold-\nblooded premeditation.” Id. Pinholster, on the other hand,\npresented himself to the jury as a classic antisocial personality\nwho revels in his disobedience to the law and social mores.\n\n   In Wiggins, defense counsel failed to present evidence that\nWiggins’s mother was an alcoholic and abusive to Wiggins\nand his siblings, Wiggins entered foster care at age six, two\nfoster mothers physically abused him, his second foster father\nrepeatedly raped and molested him, he spent time homeless,\nand he was mentally retarded. 539 U.S. at 525, 535, 545. In\nfinding that Wiggins was prejudiced by his counsel’s ineffec-\ntive assistance at the penalty phase, the Supreme Court com-\npared Wiggins to Williams, noting that “Wiggins does not\n\f4774                      PINHOLSTER v. AYERS\nhave a record of violent conduct that could have been intro-\nduced by the State to offset this powerful mitigating narra-\ntive.” Id. at 537. Pinholster, in contrast, is the epitome of a\nrepeat offender who specializes in violent crimes.\n\n   In Rompilla, had defense counsel conducted a sufficient\ninvestigation into mitigating evidence, the jury would have\nlearned that Rompilla’s parents suffered from severe alcohol-\nism; Rompilla’s mother drank during her pregnancy, causing\nRompilla to develop fetal alcohol syndrom; Rompilla and his\nbrothers also developed serious drinking problems; Rompil-\nla’s father severely beat both Rompilla and his mother; Rom-\npilla’s mother and father fought violently, with one incident\nresulting in his mother stabbing his father; and that Rompilla\nsuffered a depraved childhood, during which he was locked\nin a mesh dog pen, isolated from other children, and slept in\nan attic with no heat. 545 U.S. at 391-92. In addition, counsel\nwould have found evidence suggesting that Rompilla suffered\nfrom schizophrenia and other mental disorders.\n\n   [18] In contrast to the petitioner in Wiggins, who had no\nprior convictions nor a record of violent conduct, cf. Wiggins,\n539 U.S. at 537, Pinholster’s violent past—a past Pinholster\nproudly boasted about to the jury—offsets the mitigating evi-\ndence. Pinholster bragged that he had committed hundreds of\narmed robberies within a three-year time period. In addition,\nhe admitted to a prior kidnaping, during which he held a knife\nto the victim’s throat. And, unlike the petitioner in Williams,\nPinholster neither expressed remorse over the murders of\nThomas Johnson and Robert Beckett, nor attempted to aid the\npolice in their investigation. Rather, Pinholster threatened to\nkill the State’s lead witness, Art Corona, and proudly\nrecounted his recusant behavior in front of the jury.29\n  29\n    During the penalty phase, the jury also heard evidence regarding the\nnumerous threats and assaults Pinholster inflicted on law enforcement, as\nwell as several disciplinary infractions while he was arrested and incarcer-\nated. For example, LAPD officers Kaufman and Guzman testified that\n\f                          PINHOLSTER v. AYERS                          4775\n   We recognize that, at first glance, Pinholster’s habeas peti-\ntion more closely resembles that of the petitioner in Rompilla.\nNevertheless, there are significant differences, and we must\nanalyze an attorney’s alleged ineffective assistance of counsel\non a case-by-case approach. See Rompilla, 545 U.S. at 393-\n94, 396 (O’Connor, J., concurring). California law provides\nthat, in determining the penalty, the jury shall consider, if rel-\nevant, “[t]he circumstances of the crime of which the defen-\ndant was convicted in the present proceeding and the\nexistence of any special circumstances.” Cal. Penal Code\n§ 190.3(a). Indeed, the trial court instructed the jury that “[i]n\ndetermining which penalty is to be imposed on the Defendant,\nyou shall consider all of the evidence which has been received\nduring any part of the trial of this case.” Here, the jury wit-\n\nPinholster kicked or attempted to kick them in the head while they tried\nto restrain him on different occasions. Los Angeles County Central Jail\nOperations Sergeant Thomas Piggott testified to some of the eleven disci-\nplinary incidents with Pinholster involving “overt violence or some chal-\nlenge to future recalcitrant type behavior.” Finally, the State presented the\ntestimony of Cathy Ann Smith. She testified that Pinholster broke her jaw\nwhile seemingly having an epileptic seizure. However, because trial coun-\nsel could have rebutted some of this aggravating evidence, we do not give\nit substantial weight in the reweighing of the aggravating and mitigating\nfactors. For example, former Los Angeles County Deputy Sheriff Dale\nPeroutka would have testified that Pinholster “eventually [ ] turned him-\nself around” such that Peroutka and other deputies recommended to reclas-\nsify Pinholster from administrative segregation to the general population.\nPeroutka no longer saw Pinholster as a danger to other deputies or\ninmates; he reached an agreement with Pinholster that he could join the\ngeneral population if he behaved and complied with the rules. Likewise,\ntrial counsel could have diminished the impact of a serious disciplinary\ninfraction admitted by stipulation. Allan Page Crowder, the corrections\nofficer Pinholster allegedly threatened to throw off a tier in state prison,\nwould have testified that had he been a more seasoned officer, he would\nnot have considered the 1978 verbal altercation worthy of a CDC 115\ndisciplinary report. Nevertheless, because we find other more substantial\naggravating evidence in the record, this newfound mitigating evidence\ndoes not change our ultimate conclusion that no reasonable juror would\nhave been persuaded to change his vote.\n\f4776                     PINHOLSTER v.

Dissent at 4797-99. How-\never, for the jury charged with the duty of weighing the mitigating and\naggravating factors in determining whether this defendant should receive\na life sentence or suffer death, these separate, unconnected murders are\nirrelevant. Unlike a trial judge who may try several murder cases, or an\nappellate court that may review several different murder convictions in\nthose states imposing a proportionality review on appeal in capital cases,\nthis is likely the first and only time these jury members will become so\nintimate with facts involving the taking of human lives. The jury does not\ncompare one murder to another, ranking the heinousness of the individual\ncrimes on some imaginary scale. California does not require a proportion-\nality review as do some other states in death penalty cases. Rather, as the\nSupreme Court has directed appellate courts to do, juries also consider the\nunderlying facts of a death penalty case on an individualized case-by-case\nbasis in weighing the aggravating and mitigating facts. Cal. Penal Code\n§ 190.3. We do not share our colleague’s view that this was not a particu-\nlarly heinous double homicide.\n\f                           PINHOLSTER v. AYERS                           4777\nsional robber,” and testified that he often wrote his name and\nscratched swastikas on other people’s property as a “sideline\nto robbery.”31 Moreover, the jury heard evidence that Pinhol-\nster was previously convicted for kidnaping, that he threat-\nened to kill the State’s lead witness, and that, in a jealous\nrage, Pinholster slashed the arm of Thomas Mesquita with a\nstraight razor.\n\n   Pinholster’s detailed account of his version of the events on\nthe night of the murders would obviously affect the jury’s\nview of Pinholster’s mental impairment evidence. And, the\njury also observed firsthand on the witness stand an individual\nwho failed to respect the gravitas of the multiple murder trial\nthrough his unrepentant attitude. In addition to taking pride in\nhis criminal background, Pinholster was openly disrespectful\nof the deputy prosecutor and ignored the seriousness of his\nunderlying murders. The record reflects that Pinholster was\neither laughing or smirking during numerous stages of the\ndeputy prosecutor’s cross-examination.\n\n   [20] We cannot ignore the fact that, even while hearing\nPinholster’s defense in the guilt phase of the trial, the jury was\nconsidering facts that were also relevant to appropriate pun-\nishment. See Cal. Penal Code § 190.3(a). In his testimony,\nPinholster portrayed himself as a career criminal who reveled\nin his antisocial persona. As Dr. Rudnick explained in his dec-\nlaration, “individuals with Antisocial Personality Disorder\nmay have an inflated and arrogant self-appraisal, behave in a\ncocky or self-assured manner, lack realistic concern about\ntheir problems and display a glib, superficial charm.”32 The\n  31\n      Dr. Rudnick stated that “[Pinholster’s] behavior at Lisa Tapar’s house\nwas a clear, angry reaction to having the door closed on him. After stab-\nbing the door, he performed the very deliberate, aggressive act of carving\nvarious Nazi symbols on Lisa’s car.” This analysis, along with Pinhol-\nster’s ability to give a detailed description of his actions during this event,\nwould not have been forgotten by the jury considering any of the newly\nproffered mitigating evidence.\n   32\n      As detailed above, Dr. Woods used Pinholster’s behavior at trial to\nsupport his diagnosis of bipolar mood disorder. Given that Pinholster\n\f4778                     PINHOLSTER v. AYERS\nCalifornia Supreme Court, which acknowledged the fact that\nPinholster “gloried” in his criminal history, could reasonably\nhave concluded that no amount of clever “after-the-fact”\nassessment by habeas defense psychiatrists would have con-\nvinced even a single juror to change his vote.\n\n                                   V\n\n   We affirm the district court’s denial of Pinholster’s request\nfor an evidentiary hearing on ineffective assistance of counsel\nat the guilt phase and remand for dismissal of the petition. We\nreverse the district court’s grant of habeas relief on his inef-\nfective assistance of counsel claim at the penalty phase.\n\n  AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part, VACATED, and\nREMANDED.\n\n\n\n\nchose not to rely on Dr. Woods’s diagnosis in his federal habeas petition,\nand that both Dr. Stalberg and Dr. Rudnick discredit this diagnosis, we\ncannot believe the jury would have given it much weight.\n\fPINHOLSTER v.

Beard, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799980\"><a href=\"/opinion/799980/rompilla-v-beard/\"><span class=\"volume\">545</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">374</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 393 (2005), still allows us to “reweigh the evidence in\naggravation against the totality of available mitigating evi-\ndence,” Wiggins v. Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130159\"><a href=\"/opinion/130159/wiggins-v-smith-warden/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">510</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 534 (2003), when\ncounsel fails to uncover mitigating evidence. After all, coun-\nsel failed to uncover mitigating evidence in Rompilla, and the\nSupreme Court didn’t seem to address the aggravating evi-\ndence in assessing prejudice. See Rompilla, 545 U.S. at 393.\nStill, I have a hard time believing that Rompilla overruled a\nrecent case like Wiggins without bothering to say so. See id.\n(quoting Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 538).\n\n   Rompilla devotes most of its analysis to describing coun-\nsel’s deficiencies, not to assessing the prejudice to petitioner.\nThe Court found that counsel were ineffective in Rompilla\nbecause they failed to adequately prepare for a penalty phase\nhearing where the prosecution focused on petitioner’s prior\nconviction, not because they failed to look for evidence of\nchildhood abuse. See Rompilla, 545 U.S. at 394-96\n(O’Connor, J., concurring). As Justice O’Connor’s linchpin\nconcurrence made clear, counsel’s “trial-preparation” there\nwas deficient because they failed to obtain petitioner’s prior\nconviction file in anticipation of a hearing where the prosecu-\ntion would focus on that conviction. Id. at 395. Had defense\ncounsel properly prepared for the hearing by obtaining that\nfile, they would have stumbled across a cache of valuable evi-\n\f                      PINHOLSTER v. AYERS                   4781\ndence of childhood abuse and mental defect. Id. at 390-91\n(majority opinion). I read Rompilla for the unremarkable\nproposition that counsel must take the steps a reasonable law-\nyer would take in preparing for a hearing, not that counsel are\nalways ineffective for failing to uncover childhood mitigating\nevidence.\n\n   I would therefore find (as an alternative ground for rever-\nsal) that petitioner’s counsel weren’t deficient, because they\nmade a rational decision to pursue what was essentially a\n“pity” mitigation case, rather than try to make out a case of\nmental defect. Counsel faced a difficult situation: During the\nguilt phase, petitioner portrayed himself as a career criminal\nand boasted that he had committed hundreds of robberies\nusing a gun. And petitioner admitted to breaking into Kumar’s\nhouse on the night of the murders. The jury had ample oppor-\ntunity to evaluate petitioner’s demeanor. Counsel may well\nhave felt that petitioner’s articulate and coherent testimony\nportrayed him as a clever liar, not as someone who is mentally\ndeficient. This conclusion would have been bolstered by Dr.\nStalberg, who evaluated petitioner’s mental state and found\nhim essentially normal. While Dr. Stalberg has since flipped\na couple of times in his conclusions, petitioner doesn’t rely on\nhim now, so we can’t say that Dr. Stalberg would ultimately\nhave come up with a helpful diagnosis, had petitioner’s law-\nyers only given him more facts. Petitioner’s new lawyers did\neventually manage to find psychiatrists willing to say he is\nmentally impaired, but trial counsel had no reason to believe\nthat they could swiftly find another doctor who would dis-\nagree with their own expert’s diagnosis.\n\n   Under these circumstances, it was reasonable for them to\neschew a mental defect defense and pursue another mitigation\nstrategy. Ultimately, they focused on petitioner’s mother, who\ntestified about his head injuries, his disruptive behavior in\nschool, a psychologist’s recommendation that she commit him\nto a mental hospital, his frequent stays at juvenile hall and his\nepilepsy. The dissent chastises trial counsel for making “no\n\f4782                  PINHOLSTER v. AYERS\ninvestigation into Pinholster’s background at all,” dissent at\n4790, but I don’t see why talking to a defendant’s mother\ndoesn’t count as an investigation into his background. The\ninvestigation may not have been as thorough as our dissenting\ncolleague would have preferred, but surely it’s wrong to say\nthat defense counsel conducted no investigation at all.\n\n   Petitioner’s mother was not the perfect mitigation witness,\nbut it’s not clear that petitioner had a perfect mitigation wit-\nness. Nor is perfection the standard; the question is whether,\napplying the broad deference due to counsel under Strickland\nv. Washington, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 690-91 (1984), and the even\nbroader deference due to the California Supreme Court under\nAEDPA, 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d), we can say that counsel’s deci-\nsion is wholly unreasonable. This was not a case like Rom-\npilla or Williams v. Taylor, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145122\"><a href=\"/opinion/145122/williams-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">362</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 395 (2000), where\nreview of a single file would have yielded a treasure trove of\nmitigating evidence; finding all the evidence that petitioner’s\ncurrent lawyers have amassed after years of effort and expert-\nshopping was simply beyond the time and resources available\nto counsel at the time of trial.\n\n   Justice O’Connor’s concurrence in Rompilla reaffirmed the\n“longstanding case-by-case approach to determining whether\nan attorney’s performance was unconstitutionally deficient.”\nRompilla, 545 U.S. at 394 (O’Connor, J., concurring). Rom-\npilla involved a particular hearing regarding petitioner’s prior\nconviction, and because counsel failed to adequately prepare\nfor that hearing by obtaining petitioner’s prior conviction file,\ncounsel were unable to adequately rebut the prior conviction\nevidence. See id. at 394-96. This was a discrete, precisely\nidentifiable strategy—“a sure bet,” id. at 389 (majority\nopinion)—that no competent counsel could overlook or\nbypass. It is quite different from counsel’s debatable judg-\nment call here as to how best to present their mitigation case\n—after petitioner portrayed himself as a career criminal at the\nguilt phase and their mental expert found no basis for mitiga-\ntion.

AYERS                  4783\nJ., concurring), I can’t say that counsel’s decision to focus\nsolely on petitioner’s mother was unreasonable in these diffi-\ncult circumstances. Nor was the state court unreasonable in\nfinding that petitioner’s constitutional rights were not vio-\nlated.\n\n\n\nFISHER, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\n   I respectfully dissent. This case is controlled by a trio of\nrecent Supreme Court decisions holding that petitioners’ Sixth\nAmendment rights were violated when their lawyers failed to\npresent available mitigating evidence during the penalty\nphases of their capital trials. See Rompilla v. Beard, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799980\"><a href=\"/opinion/799980/rompilla-v-beard/\"><span class=\"volume\">545</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">374</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2005); Wiggins v.

The majority’s attempts to\ndistinguish these cases are not persuasive. Pinholster’s coun-\nsel performed at least as deficiently as the lawyers in the\nCourt’s recent decisions; and Pinholster was prejudiced as a\nresult since the mitigating evidence that could have been\nintroduced on his behalf was at least as strong as that in Wil-\nliams, Wiggins and Rompilla, and the aggravating evidence\nagainst him was if anything weaker than that in Williams and\nRompilla. Binding Supreme Court precedent therefore com-\npels the conclusion that the state court’s summary denial of\nPinholster’s penalty phase ineffective assistance of counsel\n(IAC) claim was objectively unreasonable. I would therefore\nremand for the district court to issue a writ vacating Pinhol-\nster’s sentence, unless within a reasonable time set by the\ncourt the State conducts a new penalty phase trial or imposes\na lesser sentence consistent with law.\n\n                              I.\n\n  Before addressing the majority’s penalty phase analysis, I\npause to note my partial disagreement with its resolution of\nPinholster’s guilt phase IAC claim. I agree that the district\n\f4784                      PINHOLSTER v. AYERS\ncourt did not err in denying Pinholster’s request for an eviden-\ntiary hearing on that claim, but I would base that conclusion\nsolely on Pinholster’s failure to present a colorable claim of\nprejudice. I cannot agree with the majority’s conclusion that\ncounsel’s decision to advise Pinholster to testify was a reason-\nable tactical choice rather than deficient performance.1\n\n   Pinholster’s counsel advised him to testify to a defense that\nwas not only implausible and nonsensical, but also demon-\nstrably false. There was compelling evidence disproving\nalmost every facet of the defense’s case. First, contrary to Pin-\nholster’s claim that he was a gun-toting robber and not a\nknife-wielding burglar, several witnesses testified at trial that\nthey saw Pinholster carrying a large buck knife immediately\nbefore and after the murders. Pinholster himself admitted to\ncarrying a knife on the night of the murders, and a knife\nsheath was found in his pocket when he was arrested. Pinhol-\nster also testified, contrary to his claim that he was not a bur-\nglar, that he had burglarized Kumar’s home just hours before\nthe murders took place. In contrast, Corona testified that he\nand Pinholster went to Kumar’s house on the night of the\nmurders intending to rob Kumar, and that the intended rob-\nbery turned into a burglary only when they found Kumar’s\nhome unoccupied. Corona — the State’s lead witness — thus\ngave testimony that was more consistent with Pinholster’s\n   1\n     I also disagree with the majority’s conclusion that the California\nSupreme Court reasonably concluded that Pinholster’s counsel was effec-\ntive in failing to object to highly prejudicial evidence suggesting that Pin-\nholster murdered two other individuals in Sun Valley. That court’s\nconclusion was based entirely on the assumption that the evidence would\nassist Pinholster’s defense. However, Pinholster’s defense was irrational\nand should have never been put forth. The California Supreme Court also\nfailed to consider whether Pinholster could have received the same benefit\nin terms of “candor,” People v. Pinholster, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1203248\"><a href=\"/opinion/1203248/people-v-pinholster/\"><span class=\"volume\">824</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">571</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 604 (Cal. 1992),\nby requesting redaction of the prior murder evidence from the Corona tape\nand allowing the remainder to be played. Finally, as the prosecution never\nproduced evidence that two Latino men were killed in a shootout in Sun\nValley, it appears that Corona’s prior murder comments were simply\nuntrue.\n\f                          PINHOLSTER v. AYERS                          4785\ndefense than even Pinholster’s own testimony. The second\npart of Pinholster’s alibi — that he was at Kumar’s residence\nbefore and not after his visit to Tapar’s house — was also dis-\nproved at trial. Contrary to Pinholster’s statement that he went\nto Tapar’s residence by himself in order to tell her about Shot-\ngun’s death, Tapar testified that she did not know Shotgun\nand that Pinholster arrived in Corona’s car and appeared\nintent on robbing Kumar. Even more damaging was Klemet-\nti’s testimony that he was at Kumar’s house at 9 p.m. and\nfound no signs of the burglary that Pinholster claimed to have\ncommitted at 8 p.m.\n\n   On its own, counsel’s chosen defense was misguided. But\nin light of counsel’s additional failure to investigate important\nphysical evidence, including the palm print and the boot print,\nit amounted to deficient performance.2 Although a defendant’s\nright to testify is his own and may not be overridden by coun-\nsel, counsel nonetheless has the responsibility to indepen-\ndently investigate and challenge a defendant’s implausible\nstory. See Phillips v. Woodford, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"775182\"><a href=\"/opinion/775182/richard-louis-arnold-phillips-v-jeanne-s-woodford/\"><span class=\"volume\">267</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">966</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 978-79 (9th\nCir. 2001) (stating that an attorney has an obligation to inves-\ntigate defendant’s “ ‘incredibly lame’ ” alibi and “ ‘confront\nthe petitioner with the difficulties of his story’ ” (quoting\nJohnson v. Baldwin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"741133\"><a href=\"/opinion/741133/97-cal-daily-op-serv-3871-97-daily-journal-dar-6573-albert-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">835</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 838, 840 (9th Cir. 1997)).\n  2\n    The majority suggests that Pinholster suffered less prejudice from his\ncounsels’ failure to investigate the palm print, because counsel “merely\nstated that he probably” would have advised Pinholster not to testify had\nhe known of evidence that the palm print found at the crime scene did not\nmatch Pinholster’s palm. See Maj. Op. at 4753 & n.13. The question is not\nwhat Pinholster’s ineffective counsel would have done but rather what\neffective counsel would have done. Competent counsel would have cer-\ntainly advised Pinholster not to testify. Nor do I agree that the existence\nof only a “battle of the experts” with regard to the palm print evidence\nsomehow reduces the prejudice from counsel’s failure to investigate. See\nid. at 4754-55. Evidence that creates a “battle of the experts” is precisely\nthe type of evidence that gives rise to reasonable doubt, and thus will typi-\ncally support a finding of prejudice. In this case it is only because other\nevidence overwhelmingly shows Pinholster’s guilt that the new palm print\nevidence does not amount to prejudice.\n\f4786                     PINHOLSTER v. AYERS\nHere, an investigation would have revealed that Pinholster’s\nalibi was highly suspect, giving rise to counsel’s obligation to\nadvise Pinholster against testifying, because the jury would\nlikely conclude he was lying.3 See also id. at 979 (“ ‘The prej-\nudice from failing to investigate the alibi and confer more\nfully with petitioner is not avoided by the fact the petitioner\nmisinformed his attorney.’ ”) (quoting Johnson, 114 F.3d at\n840). At the very least, counsel’s shortcoming in this regard\nmakes out a colorable claim of deficient performance for pur-\nposes of obtaining an evidentiary hearing. See id. (noting that\nthe “colorable claim” standard is “far less onerous” than the\nstandard for granting the writ); see also Earp v. Ornoski, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">431</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1158</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1170 (9th Cir. 2005) (describing the “colorable\nclaim” standard as “a low bar”).\n\n   Nonetheless, I agree that Pinholster has failed to present a\ncolorable claim of prejudice. There was overwhelming evi-\ndence of Pinholster’s guilt, including: Art Corona’s eyewit-\nness testimony of the murders; Casey Corona’s testimony that\nshe saw Pinholster washing blood off his knife soon after the\nmurders while stating “[i]t had to be done the way it was\ndone”; Kempf’s testimony that Pinholster stated — while\nclutching his buck knife — that he wanted to rob Kumar “one\nway or the other”; Tapar’s testimony that Pinholster appeared\nat her door with a knife just before the murders and that she\nhad the impression that Pinholster intended to steal from\nKumar; and evidence that one Gian Norelli had heard Pinhol-\nster brag about stabbing two people in Tarzana, where Kumar\nlived. In light of this evidence, it is difficult to conceive of\nany reasonable juror not voting to convict absent a convincing\ndefense theory. Pinholster has failed to articulate such a\n  3\n   The majority’s insistence that Pinholster’s counsel were not ineffective\nbecause Pinholster was “eager to take the stand” is not illuminating. Maj.\nOp. at 4753. Counsels’ deficient failure to investigate Pinholster’s alibi\ndefense, which in turn rendered them unable to provide competent advice\nabout whether he should testify, made it impossible for Pinholster to make\nan informed decision as to whether he should exercise his constitutional\nright to do so.\n\f                      PINHOLSTER v. AYERS                   4787\ndefense theory. Cf. Phillips, 267 F.3d at 980-81 (gauging\nwhether there was a colorable claim of prejudice by compar-\ning the deficient defense presented at trial to a proposed alter-\nnative defense). For this reason alone, I would hold that the\ndistrict court appropriately denied Pinholster an evidentiary\nhearing on guilt phase ineffective assistance and, necessarily,\nthat the district court properly denied habeas relief with\nregard to guilt.\n\n   Notwithstanding that counsel’s deficiencies were not preju-\ndicial at the guilt phase, I would hold that they added consid-\nerably to the prejudice Pinholster suffered at the penalty\nphase. Counsel’s deficient performance at the guilt phase\nresulted in the jury hearing Pinholster boast about committing\nhundreds of robberies as well as other damaging evidence\nsuggesting that Pinholster murdered two men. The majority\nitself makes evident that counsel’s failure to advise Pinholster\nagainst taking the stand during the guilt phase was prejudicial\nat the penalty phase, because it repeatedly invokes the “dam-\nage Pinholster did to himself when he took the stand in the\nguilt phase and testified to an unrepentant life of violent\ncrime.” See Maj. Op. at 4767; see also id. at 4772 (“[N]o\nnewly-minted expert theory to explain his behavior would\nhave made a difference in the face of what Pinholster said and\ndid.”); id. at 4774 (noting that any mitigating evidence would\nhave been offset when Pinholster “proudly boasted to the\njury” about his life of crime). The same jury that decided Pin-\nholster’s guilt went on to decide his penalty, so the harmful\nguilt phase evidence undoubtedly added to the other prejudi-\ncial errors Pinholster’s counsel committed at the penalty\nphase, to which I now turn.\n\n                               II.\n\n  The majority holds that the California Supreme Court’s\nsummary denial of Pinholster’s penalty phase IAC claim was\nnot objectively unreasonable. I disagree. In my view, the\nSupreme Court’s recent decisions in Williams, Wiggins and\n\f4788                  PINHOLSTER v. AYERS\nRompilla compel the conclusion that Pinholster’s counsel per-\nformed deficiently and that Pinholster was prejudiced as a\nresult. The state court’s ruling to the contrary was indeed an\n“unreasonable application of[ ] clearly established Federal\nlaw, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United\nStates.” 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1).\n\n                              A.\n\n   The majority proceeds straight to the prejudice prong of the\nIAC inquiry and does not contend that Pinholster’s trial coun-\nsel performed competently. See Maj. Op. at 4765. This is a\nwise decision, because counsel manifestly failed to satisfy the\nprofessional standards for penalty phase representation. The\nSupreme Court has held that “trial counsel [must] conduct a\nthorough investigation of the defendant’s background.” Wil-\nliams, 529 U.S. at 396 (citing the applicable American Bar\nAssociation standards); see also Rompilla, 545 U.S. at 387 &\nn.7; Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 524 (“[I]nvestigations into mitigat-\ning evidence should comprise efforts to discover all reason-\nably available mitigating evidence . . . .”) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Employing this approach, the Court found\ndeficient performance — despite AEDPA’s deferential stan-\ndard of review — in Williams, Wiggins, and Rompilla. In Wil-\nliams, counsel began to prepare for the penalty phase less than\na week before trial, presented only four witnesses and “failed\nto conduct an investigation that would have uncovered exten-\nsive records graphically describing Williams’ nightmarish\nchildhood.” 529 U.S. at 369, 395. In Wiggins, counsel pre-\nsented no evidence of the petitioner’s life history or family\nbackground, and failed to consult documentary evidence\nbeyond the petitioner’s presentence investigation (PSI) report\nand Department of Social Services (DSS) records. See 539\nU.S. at 516, 524-29. And in Rompilla, counsel presented five\nwitnesses during the penalty phase and reviewed the reports\nof three mental health experts, but failed to examine the peti-\ntioner’s prior conviction file even though the prosecution had\n\f                      PINHOLSTER v. AYERS                    4789\ndeclared its intention to introduce that file’s contents at trial.\nSee 545 U.S. at 381-86.\n\n   Pinholster’s attorneys plainly performed even more defi-\nciently than the lawyers in Williams, Wiggins and Rompilla.\nAccording to billing records, they spent only 6.5 hours pre-\nparing for the penalty phase of Pinholster’s trial. One week\nbefore the penalty phase began, counsel admitted that they\n“had not prepared any evidence by way of mitigation,” and\nthen declined to request a continuance so that they could con-\nduct a proper investigation, telling the court that they did not\nthink more time “would make a great deal of difference.”\nThey obtained no medical or psychological records, law\nenforcement records or school reports for Pinholster or his\nsiblings, even though all of this documentary evidence was\nreadily available. They failed to provide the psychiatrist they\nretained, Dr. Stalberg, with any of the materials he needed to\nevaluate Pinholster properly. They interviewed and presented\njust one witness, Pinholster’s mother, whose testimony at trial\nwas highly misleading and self-serving. They waived their\nopening statement in the penalty phase. If the lawyers in Wil-\nliams and Rompilla performed deficiently even though they\ninterviewed and presented multiple witnesses, and if counsel’s\nperformance in Wiggins was deficient despite the examination\nof the petitioner’s PSI report and DSS records, then Pinhol-\nster’s attorneys cannot have satisfied the professional stan-\ndards for penalty phase representation. It is not reasonable for\na lawyer to interview and present just one witness, to fail to\nuncover abundant readily available mitigating evidence and to\nspend less than a day preparing for a proceeding at which the\njury will decide whether the lawyer’s client should live or die.\n\n   Chief Judge Kozinski, concurring, suggests that this perfor-\nmance was not deficient because counsel “made a rational\ndecision to pursue what was essentially a ‘pity’ mitigation\ncase, rather than trying to make out a case of mental defect.”\nConcurring Op. at 4781. Relying almost exclusively on Jus-\ntice O’Connor’s nonbinding concurrence in Rompilla, he\n\f4790                  PINHOLSTER v. AYERS\nargues that Rompilla stands only for the “unremarkable prop-\nosition” that counsel must take reasonable steps to prepare for\na hearing, not “that counsel are always ineffective for failing\nto uncover childhood mitigating evidence.” Id. Even if he\nwere correct that Rompilla’s holding is so limited, however,\nthe same cannot be said for Williams, where the Court noted\nthat it was “barely disputed” that counsel were ineffective\nwhere, as here, they “did not begin to prepare for [the penalty]\nphase of the proceeding until a week before the trial” and\n“failed to conduct an investigation that would have uncovered\nextensive records graphically describing Williams’ nightmar-\nish childhood, not because of any strategic calculation but\nbecause they incorrectly thought that state law barred access\nto such records.” 529 U.S. at 395 (emphasis added).\n\n  In this case, counsel failed to conduct an investigation into\nPinholster’s background — not through any mistake of law,\nbut through apathy or negligence. This hardly seems to be a\nmore defensible strategic choice. Although in certain cases\ncounsel may have “sound reason to think it would have been\npointless to spend time and money on . . . additional investi-\ngation,” and hence counsel’s failure to uncover additional\nmitigating evidence would not be unreasonable, here there\nwas no investigation into Pinholster’s background at all,\nbeyond interviewing his mother. Rompilla, 545 U.S. at 383.\nWhere no meaningful investigation is even attempted, counsel\ncould hardly have developed any “sound reason” to think that\n“additional investigation” would be fruitless. Id. (emphasis\nadded); see also id. at 389 (explaining that conducting further\ninvestigation may not be necessary “when a lawyer truly has\nreason to doubt” that further useful mitigating information\nwill be found) (emphasis added). Here counsel not only con-\nducted the very barest kind of investigation, they failed to\nconduct any follow-up investigation into the limited mitigat-\ning evidence that they did learn from Pinholster’s mother,\nsuch as evidence that Pinholster suffered from epilepsy. Thus\neven where counsel developed “sound reason” to believe that\n\f                      PINHOLSTER v. AYERS                  4791\nfurther investigation would yield fruitful evidence, counsel\nutterly neglected that duty. Id.\n\n   Lastly, contrary to Chief Judge Kozinski’s suggestion,\ncounsel could not have made a “rational decision” to pursue\na mitigation strategy that relied solely on Pinholster’s moth-\ner’s inaccurate testimony, when counsel failed to explore\nmeaningfully any other options. See Concurring Op. at 4781.\nAs the Court has explained, the question is “not whether\ncounsel should have presented a mitigation case,” but\n“whether the investigation supporting counsel’s decision not\nto introduce mitigating evidence of [the defendant’s] back-\nground was itself reasonable.” See Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 523.\nEven if one could hypothesize a world in which relying on\nPinholster’s mother’s testimony and eschewing a mental\ndefect defense was a reasonable defense strategy, Pinholster’s\ncounsel could not have made such a strategic decision where\nthey “abandoned their investigation of petitioner’s back-\nground after having acquired only rudimentary knowledge of\nhis history from a narrow set of sources.” Id. at 524. Coun-\nsel’s failure to investigate here was even more flagrant than\nin Williams, Wiggins or Rompilla, and so was manifestly\nunreasonable under clearly established Supreme Court law.\n\n                              B.\n\n                               1.\n\n   The majority holds that even if the performance of Pinhol-\nster’s counsel was deficient, it was not objectively unreason-\nable for the state court to rule that Pinholster was not thereby\nprejudiced. In reaching this conclusion, the majority mini-\nmizes or ignores much of the mitigating evidence that Pinhol-\nster could have presented, overstates the value of what little\nmitigating evidence was actually put before the jury, and\nexaggerates the aggravating evidence that was introduced\nagainst him. The majority thus imposes a much more stringent\ntest for prejudice than is required by Strickland v. Washing-\n\f4792                  PINHOLSTER v. AYERS\nton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1984), and its progeny. While it is true that\nPinholster must demonstrate that there is a “reasonable proba-\nbility that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result\nof the proceeding would have been different,” the Court has\nemphasized that a reasonable probability is less than the pre-\nponderance more-likely-than-not standard. See Strickland,\n466 U.S. at 693-94; see also Rompilla, 545 U.S. at 393\n(“[A]lthough we suppose it is possible that [the sentencer]\ncould have heard it all and still decided on the death penalty,\nthat is not the test.”). The gap between the evidence that was\npresented and what could have been presented is more than\nsufficient to “undermine confidence in the outcome” of the\nproceeding. See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694.\n\n   Beginning with the available mitigating evidence, the\nmajority ignores or downplays much of the probative infor-\nmation that Pinholster could have presented at trial. First, the\n“years of significant neglect and physical and emotional\nabuse” that Pinholster experienced as a child were not, as the\nmajority implies, limited to the beatings by his stepfather and\ngrandmother. Maj. Op. at 4767-68. His birth father, Garland\nPinholster, abandoned the family when Pinholster was an\ninfant. Pinholster’s family was extremely poor, to the point\nthat the children would sometimes mix flour and water when\nthey were hungry. Neither Pinholster’s stepfather nor his\nmother evinced any concern for Pinholster and his siblings.\nIndeed, Pinholster’s mother often laughed when her children\nbehaved inappropriately, encouraged them to steal from\nnearby rail cars and dressed the children in rags while buying\nmink coats for herself.\n\n   Second, the lives of Pinholster’s siblings were worse than\nthe majority indicates. Pinholster’s half-sister, Tammy Brash-\near, was convicted of prostitution and forcible sexual battery,\nand became a ward of the juvenile court when she was 16.\nPinholster’s brother, Alvin Pinholster, was arrested for rob-\nbery, rape, sodomy and other offenses, suffered from severe\ndepression and schizophrenia and eventually committed sui-\n\f                     PINHOLSTER v. AYERS                  4793\ncide. Pinholster’s other brother, Terry Pinholster, suffered\nfrom depression and became a user of PCP. And Pinholster’s\nhalf-brother, Guy Pinholster, suffered from depression as well\nas bipolar mood disorder, and was frequently beaten by his\nfather.\n\n   Third, Pinholster’s own medical history is more problem-\natic than the majority acknowledges. He suffered his first\nhead injury at age two when he was run over by his mother’s\ncar, resulting in a two-week hospital stay. He suffered a sec-\nond severe head injury a year later, during a car accident in\nwhich Pinholster’s head hit the front windshield hard enough\nto shatter the glass. According to Dr. Woods, these injuries at\nthe very least supported a post-traumatic diagnosis, and may\nhave accounted for the abnormal EEG that Pinholster\nrecorded as a child. Similarly, Dr. Olson and Dr. Vinogradov\nstated that the injuries damaged Pinholster’s brain and caused\nhim to become more aggressive, while Dr. Stalberg described\nthe injuries as potentially “devastating” and linked them to\nPinholster’s epilepsy. That epilepsy was severe enough that\nPinholster was prescribed medication from age nine onward\nand repeatedly suffered complex partial and grand mal sei-\nzures. Different doctors also diagnosed Pinholster with bipo-\nlar mood disorder (Dr. Woods) and personality change due to\nchildhood head trauma (Dr. Olson and Dr. Vinogradov),\nwhile agreeing that he was epileptic. At age 11, Pinholster\nspent more than four months in a mental institution.\n\n   Fourth, the majority does not even acknowledge that Pin-\nholster had severe learning disabilities in school and was\nsocially isolated and maladjusted as a child. According to his\nelementary school teacher, Lois Rainwater, Pinholster “had\nno friends at all,” “seemed incapable of relating either to his\npeers or to adults,” “seemed like a child who got no attention\nor structure at home” and “fell through the cracks emotionally\nand every other way.” Lastly, Pinholster had a history of\nabusing alcohol, nicotine, marijuana, and heroin. He started\ndrinking alcohol, smoking, sniffing glue and paint and using\n\f4794                  PINHOLSTER v. AYERS\nmarijuana between the ages of 10 and 12; using Seconal and\ndowners between the ages of 13 and 14; and using heroin and\ncocaine between the ages of 14 and 16. On the night of the\nevents in question, Pinholster was heavily intoxicated with\nboth alcohol and drugs.\n\n   Instead of discussing this substantial available mitigating\nevidence that was not put before the jury, the majority instead\ndwells on an interview Pinholster gave to a social worker in\n1991, where he downplayed the extent of the abuse he suf-\nfered as a child. See Maj. Op. at 4767-69. Although the\nmajority acknowledges that Pinholster’s stepfather “fre-\nquently beat Pinholster with his fists, a belt, or anything else\navailable, including a two-by-four board,” the majority none-\ntheless focuses on Pinholster’s — the abused child’s — inter-\npretation of these events as nothing but “discipline” that\n“benefitted” him and his brothers. Id. at 4767-68. Further,\nwhile the majority goes on at length about the positive rela-\ntionship Pinholster may have with his maternal grandfather,\nPinholster’s uncle and aunt testified that it was Pinholster’s\ngrandmother who would frequently “beat the hell out of” Pin-\nholster from the time when he was a toddler. Every medical\nprofessional who evaluated Pinholster concluded that he suf-\nfered severe abuse and neglect in his childhood. Further, mul-\ntiple doctors who evaluated Pinholster noted his tendency to\nportray his own history inaccurately or minimize the serious-\nness of his childhood trauma so as to maintain a facade of per-\nsonal control. The majority’s emphasis on Pinholster’s\nrationalization of his mother’s neglect therefore seems rather\nmyopic if not disingenuous.\n\n   The majority also attempts to minimize the evidence of\nPinholster’s substantial neurological and emotional disorders\nby emphasizing disagreements among the experts as to some\ndiagnoses, and stating that “the only constant with regards to\nthe evolving defense expert testimony has been Dr. Stalberg’s\ndiagnosis of Antisocial Personality Disorder and the experts’\nagreement that it is reasonably probable that Pinholster suf-\n\f                     PINHOLSTER v. AYERS                  4795\nfered from epilepsy.” Maj. Op. at 4772. It is unclear why the\nmajority dismisses the importance of these diagnoses, which\nare clearly sufficient of themselves to indicate an organic\nbasis for some of Pinholster’s behavior. Further, Dr. Woods\nconcluded that Pinholster suffered from bipolar mood disor-\nder and Dr. Olson and Dr. Vinogradov concluded that Pinhol-\nster suffered from brain damage attributable to childhood\ntrauma, which may have explained in part his aggressive\nbehavior. Even if not all experts concurred on the exact set of\ndiagnoses, numerous doctors agreed that Pinholster suffered\nfrom psychological disorders that may have influenced his\ncriminal acts. Further, this medical testimony might have also\naffected the jury’s interpretation of Pinholster’s guilt phase\ntestimony, again by suggesting an organic basis for his ten-\ndency to exaggerate his past. Yet none of this medical evi-\ndence or testimony was put before the jury to evaluate, and\nthe majority acknowledges that it has no reason to doubt the\ncredibility of these medical professionals.\n\n   The majority also gives too much credit to the penalty\nphase testimony of Pinholster’s mother, Burnice Brashear.\nWhile Brashear’s testimony did include some “mitigating evi-\ndence,” see id. at 4769 — as was inevitable given Pinholster’s\nhorrific childhood — the overall impression she conveyed of\nPinholster’s upbringing was not just incomplete but actually\nuntrue. Contrary to her statements in court, Pinholster’s sib-\nlings were not “[b]asically very good children,” and they got\ninto much more than “small trouble” with drugs, alcohol and\nthe law. The beatings that Pinholster endured at the hands of\nhis stepfather were quite certainly child abuse, not mere “dis-\ncipline” or “arguments and hassles,” as Brashear also charac-\nterized them. Pinholster and his siblings did not have\n“everything normally materialwise that most people have,”\n“decent clothes” and “a nice house,” but instead suffered from\nmalnutrition, lack of clothing and neglect. Pinholster’s epi-\nlepsy was first diagnosed at age nine, not after he was beaten\nat age 18. And Pinholster did not do “much better” at school\nafter being diagnosed with “perceptive vision” and moved to\n\f4796                  PINHOLSTER v. AYERS\na different classroom; rather, his academic performance con-\ntinued to decline, and by his teenage years he was being shuf-\nfled from one institutional setting to another. Instead of\nminimizing the damage done by Brashear’s testimony, I\nwould simply adhere to the conclusions of Dr. Stalberg and\nthe district court. Dr. Stalberg described Brashear’s state-\nments as “profoundly misleading,” while the district court\nopined that “[t]he available evidence ‘was far different from\nthe unfocused snapshot’ presented by Pinholster’s attorneys at\ntrial.” Hence the majority attributes false weight to the jury’s\nsupposedly “obvious rejection of such mitigating circum-\nstances.” Id. at 4769. The jury was not presented with an\naccurate picture of the mitigating circumstances, so it hardly\ncould have rejected them.\n\n   Finally, the majority not only overvalues Brashear’s testi-\nmony, but also ignores the way in which its deficiencies were\nturned against Pinholster by the prosecution. During the pen-\nalty phase closing arguments, the State was able to claim, on\nthe basis of Brashear’s inaccurate statements, that Pinholster\nhad resorted to crime and violence even though he “came\nfrom a good home,” “was not a deprived child” and “had\nmany things going for him, probably more than many chil-\ndren.” The State also was able to discount Brashear’s testi-\nmony about Pinholster’s epilepsy — and indeed to accuse her\nof lying about it — by pointing to the complete lack of cor-\nroborating evidence as well as her own ignorance about the\ncondition. On cross-examination, Brashear stated that she did\nnot know what type of epilepsy Pinholster had, that she was\nunsure when she found out about the condition and that on\none occasion she had taken Pinholster to a doctor and, as the\nprosecutor put it, “lo and behold, just like that the doctor told\nthem he had epilepsy.” Brashear’s flawed testimony, in com-\nbination with Pinholster’s counsel’s failure to present any\nother evidence in mitigation, thus made possible the State’s\ndevastating conclusion: “What did the defendant proffer in\nthis particular case as to ask you to come back with anything\nless than death? . . . Not one person except his mother.” Cf.\n\f                     PINHOLSTER v. AYERS                  4797\nKaris v.

Op. at 4766, 4773. This evidence\nmust not be understated, and Pinholster is obviously not a\nsympathetic person, but deeming the aggravating evidence\n“overwhelming” does not make it so. First, the murders them-\nselves were not as heinous as many of the other terrible\ncrimes that we have considered in capital cases. Pinholster did\nnot intend to kill anyone when he went to Kumar’s house, and\nindeed was surprised when the housesitters, Johnson and\nBeckett, arrived at the scene. Thus to the extent there was any\npremeditation, it formed immediately before the instant\noffenses took place, when a drunk, high and emotionally dis-\ntraught Pinholster and his two codefendants, Corona and\nBrown, suddenly discovered that they were not alone in\nKumar’s house. Moreover, Brown stabbed Johnson as well\nand said that he had “ ‘buried his knife to the hilt’ ” in him,\nmeaning that it is uncertain whether Pinholster was responsi-\nble for Johnson’s fatal wounds. See Pinholster, 824 P.2d at\n582-84.\n\n   We have previously described a very similar crime as “in\nessence a robbery gone wrong.” Belmontes v.

Although Pinhol-\nster’s crime was surely vicious, the facts of the crime were\nunfortunately far from extreme in either their depravity or\ncruelty. See, e.g., Hovey v. Ayers, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"795328\"><a href=\"/opinion/795328/richard-adams-hovey-v-robert-l-ayers-jr-acting-warden-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">892</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 898 (9th Cir.\n2006) (defendant abducted a young girl as she was walking\nhome from school, sexually molested her and abandoned her\non the side of the road with six skull fractures and 14 lacera-\ntion wounds); Fields v.

As the majority notes, Pinholster denied murder-\ning Johnson and Beckett, referred to himself as a\n“professional robber,” testified that he often scratched peo-\nple’s property, was convicted of kidnaping and received sev-\neral disciplinary infractions while arrested and incarcerated.\nSee Maj. Op. at 4774-77 & n.29. As presented to the jury,\nhowever, Pinholster’s criminal record was not very extensive,\nas it did not include any convictions other than the kidnaping\ncount. Moreover, although the majority believes this aggra-\nvating evidence was of overwhelming importance, the prose-\ncutor did not actually refer to Pinholster’s denial of his\ninvolvement in the murders, his prior robberies or his pen-\nchant for scratching property at any point during the penalty\nphase. Considering analogous aggravating evidence in Bel-\nmontes, we concluded that it was “not strong,” but was “mini-\nmal” and “weak[ ].” 414 F.3d at 1106, 1139-40. The relevant\nfacts in that case consisted of Belmontes’ “previous[ ] incarc-\n\f                      PINHOLSTER v. AYERS                    4799\nerat[ation] in the youth facility for being an accessory after\nthe fact to voluntary manslaughter, one domestic violence\nincident, and two occurrences relating to possession, or possi-\nble possession, of a gun.” Id. at 1139. Similarly, we noted that\nthe prosecution presented “considerable” aggravating evi-\ndence in Boyde v. Brown, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"789957\"><a href=\"/opinion/789957/richard-boyde-v-jill-brown-warden-of-california-state-prison-at-san/\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1159</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1179 (9th Cir.\n2005). The incidents introduced in that case included the peti-\ntioner’s assaults on former classmates, his throwing bricks at\na van, his theft of his stepfather’s gun, his prior robberies, his\ndrug use while incarcerated and his plot to escape from\nprison. See id.\n\n   The majority dismisses the relevance of any comparisons\nbetween Pinholster’s murders and other crimes, noting that\nunder California law, the jury reviews only the facts in front\nof it and does not conduct a proportionality review by com-\nparing the crime to others. See Maj. Op. at 4775-76 n.30. All\njurors, however, consider a case against a background of\nsocial understandings and shared experiences about crime and\ncriminals, which in turn influences their decision as to\nwhether someone has committed an offense so heinous as to\nwarrant the ultimate penalty. Indeed, the majority’s emphasis\non the lack of proportionality analysis in California law\nunderscores the prejudice that resulted from counsels’ failure\nto put forth the reams of the readily available mitigating evi-\ndence in Pinholster’s case. Because the jurors could weigh\nonly the aggravating and mitigating evidence presented to\nthem, the omissions of and outright misrepresentations about\nmitigating evidence on Pinholster’s side of the scale plainly\nleft the jury with little to tip the balance toward life imprison-\nment over execution.\n\n   Finally, as discussed above, some of the aggravating evi-\ndence that the majority cites would never have been intro-\nduced had Pinholster’s counsel not performed deficiently\nduring the guilt phase of the trial. In particular, Pinholster’s\nreferences to his own past robberies — probably the most\ndamning testimony the jury heard, next to the details of the\n\f4800                  PINHOLSTER v. AYERS\nactual murders — and his statements about the swastikas and\nsignatures he frequently scratched into other people’s prop-\nerty would never have been admitted. See Maj. Op. at 4776-\n77. Competent representation during the trial’s first stage\nwould thus have further weakened the prosecution’s argument\nduring the penalty phase that Pinholster deserved the ultimate\npenalty.\n\n                               3.\n\n   The mitigating evidence that Pinholster could have intro-\nduced was therefore substantially more compelling than the\nmajority acknowledges, whereas the aggravating evidence\nwas somewhat weaker. If the evidence on both sides of the\nledger is fairly characterized, and evaluated in light of the\nSupreme Court’s recent decisions in Williams, Wiggins and\nRompilla, it is clear that the California Supreme Court’s\ndenial of Pinholster’s penalty phase IAC claim was objec-\ntively unreasonable.\n\n   The available mitigating evidence in Williams was that the\npetitioner had been beaten by his father, that his parents had\nbeen imprisoned for criminal neglect, that he had been placed\nunder the custody of the social services bureau for two years,\nthat he was borderline mentally retarded, that he had helped\ncrack a prison drug ring and that he had been a peaceful pris-\noner. See 529 U.S. at 395-96. The aggravating evidence, on\nthe other hand, was that the petitioner had been convicted of\narmed robbery, burglary and grand larceny prior to the murder\nfor which he was sentenced to death, and that after the murder\nhe perpetrated two auto thefts and two separate assaults on\nelderly victims. The jury also learned that he was convicted\nfor setting a fire while in jail. See id. at 368-69. In Wiggins,\nthe available mitigating evidence was that the petitioner expe-\nrienced severe privation and abuse while in his mother’s cus-\ntody, that he was abused, sexually molested and raped while\nin foster care, that he was homeless for a period and that his\nmental capacity was diminished. See 539 U.S. at 535. The\n\f                      PINHOLSTER v. AYERS                  4801\nonly aggravating evidence was that the petitioner had\ndrowned his elderly victim and ransacked her apartment; he\nhad no record of violent conduct before or after the murder.\nSee id. at 514, 537. Finally, the available mitigating evidence\nin Rompilla was that the petitioner grew up in a slum, that he\nwas abused by his father, that his parents were alcoholics, that\nhe consumed too much alcohol, that he was mentally retarded\nand that he suffered from organic brain damage. See 545 U.S.\nat 390-93. The aggravating evidence consisted of the petition-\ner’s prior convictions for rape, burglary and theft, as well as\nhis use of torture in committing the murder for which he was\nsentenced to death. See id. at 378; Rompilla v. Horn, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"784773\"><a href=\"/opinion/784773/ronald-rompilla-v-martin-horn-commissioner-pennsylvania-department-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">355</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">233</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 237 (3d Cir. 2004), overruled by </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799980\"><a href=\"/opinion/799980/rompilla-v-beard/\"><span class=\"volume\">545</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">374</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2005).\n\n   Although the majority asserts that Pinholster’s available\nmitigating evidence “falls short when compared to the miti-\ngating evidence available in Williams, Wiggins, and Rompil-\nla,” that evidence cannot be meaningfully distinguished from\nthese cases. Maj. Op. at 4773. Pinholster, Williams, Wiggins\nand Rompilla were all badly beaten by their parents. All four\nmen grew up in extreme poverty with little to no parental\nattention. All four spent time in foster homes and other insti-\ntutional settings as children. Pinholster and Rompilla suffered\nfrom organic brain damage, while Williams and Wiggins\nwere mentally retarded or close to it. And both Pinholster and\nRompilla were addicted to alcohol.\n\n  Rather than heed these obvious similarities, the majority\nemphasizes the differences that inevitably exist between one\nperson’s life and another’s. For instance, Williams, unlike\nPinholster, behaved well while in prison and Wiggins, also\nunlike Pinholster, was sexually molested and spent time\nhomeless. Maj. Op. at 4773. These minor factual contrasts\ncannot be legally dispositive, particularly given that several\naspects of Pinholster’s available mitigating evidence have no\nparallel in Williams, Wiggins and Rompilla. Pinholster’s\nmother, for example, did not just neglect him but rather\nactively encouraged his illegal activities. His siblings had\n\f4802                  PINHOLSTER v. AYERS\nserious problems with alcohol, drugs, mental health and the\nlaw. Pinholster himself is a lifelong epileptic prone to severe\nseizures. He was socially isolated and maladjusted as a child.\nHis substance abuse issues began at an early age and involved\nan array of illegal drugs. And Pinholster’s counsel did not just\npresent incomplete information about him in mitigation, but\nrather allowed his mother to give inaccurate testimony that\nwas then used against him by the prosecution. I do not neces-\nsarily contend that these differences make Pinholster’s avail-\nable mitigating evidence more powerful than that in Williams,\nWiggins and Rompilla. They do, however, more than offset\nthe supposedly meaningful contrasts that the majority identi-\nfies.\n\n   On the aggravating evidence side, I agree with the majority\nthat Wiggins can be distinguished because the petitioner in\nthat case, unlike Pinholster, “[did] not have a record of violent\nconduct that could have been introduced by the State to offset\nth[e] powerful mitigating narrative.” 539 U.S. at 537; see\nMaj. Op. at 4773-74. However, the aggravating evidence\nagainst Pinholster was not dispositively stronger than that in\nWilliams and Rompilla. It is true, as the majority asserts, that\nPinholster admitted to committing many past robberies — in\nguilt phase testimony that would never have taken place had\nhe been competently represented, and that the prosecutor\nnever mentioned during the penalty phase — and that he was\nan unusually problematic inmate. See Maj. Op. at 4774-76 &\nn.29. But Williams also committed theft-related offenses both\nbefore and after his homicide, and, unlike Pinholster, he was\nactually convicted of some of those crimes (namely his 1976\narmed robbery and his 1982 burglary and grand larceny).\nThere is also no analogue in Pinholster’s criminal history to\nWilliams’ “two separate violent assaults on elderly victims\nperpetrated after the [relevant] murder,” his proclivity for\nstarting fires or the testimony by two expert witnesses that he\nwould “pose a serious continuing threat to society.” 529 U.S.\nat 368-69. Rompilla, similarly, was actually convicted of bur-\nglary and theft. He was also convicted of rape — a more seri-\n\f                      PINHOLSTER v. AYERS                  4803\nous crime than any Pinholster committed before the instant\nmurders — and tortured his homicide victim before finally\nputting him out of his misery. See 545 U.S. at 378; 355 F.3d\nat 237. Again, I do not necessarily argue that these differences\nmake the aggravating evidence against Pinholster weaker than\nthat in Williams and Rompilla. But I cannot accept the majori-\nty’s conclusion that the aggravating evidence against Pinhol-\nster was dispositively worse.\n\n   Though the majority does not address them, it is also clear\nthat none of the Supreme Court decisions that have upheld\nstate court denials of petitioners’ penalty phase IAC claims\nare as relevant here as Williams, Wiggins and Rompilla. In\nStrickland, “[t]he evidence that respondent says his trial coun-\nsel should have offered at the sentencing hearing would\nbarely have altered the sentencing profile presented to the\nsentencing judge,” and the aggravating factors were “over-\nwhelming.” 466 U.S. at 699-700. The balance between avail-\nable mitigating evidence and aggravating evidence was thus\nstarkly different from Williams, Wiggins, Rompilla and the\ncase before us. In Burger v. Kemp, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111957\"><a href=\"/opinion/111957/burger-v-kemp/\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">776</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1987), and\nBell v.

See Bell, 535 U.S. at 699; Burger,\n483 U.S. at 789-94. Woodford v. Visciotti, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"122243\"><a href=\"/opinion/122243/woodford-v-visciotti/\"><span class=\"volume\">537</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(2002), is inapposite for the same reason: The aggravating\nevidence, which included the knifing of one man and the stab-\nbing of a pregnant woman, was “devastating” while the avail-\nable mitigating evidence was not particularly potent. Id. at 26.\nSchriro v. Landrigan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145734\"><a href=\"/opinion/145734/schriro-v-landrigan/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1933</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2007), finally, dealt\nprimarily with the extraneous issue of a petitioner instructing\nhis lawyer not to mount a case in mitigation. The Court also\nexplicitly labeled the available mitigating evidence in that\ncase as “weak,” and noted the petitioner’s “exceedingly vio-\nlent past” of murders, kidnapings and prison escapes. Id. at\n\f4804                  PINHOLSTER v. AYERS\n1944. Accordingly, nothing in the Supreme Court’s other pen-\nalty phase IAC decisions undermines my conclusion that we\nare bound here by Williams, Wiggins and Rompilla — and\nthat those cases require us to hold that the California Supreme\nCourt’s denial of Pinholster’s penalty phase IAC claim was\nobjectively unreasonable.\n\n                              III.\n\n   The California Supreme Court’s summary denial of Pinhol-\nster’s penalty phase IAC claim was an objectively unreason-\nable application of Strickland. The performance of\nPinholster’s counsel at the penalty phase was plainly defi-\ncient; and the available mitigating evidence in his favor and\nthe aggravating evidence against him — when they are fairly\ncharacterized — render this case materially indistinguishable\nfor purposes of prejudice from Williams and Rompilla. I\ntherefore dissent. I would remand for the district court to issue\na writ vacating Pinholster’s sentence, unless within a reason-\nable time set by the court the State conducts a new penalty\nphase trial or imposes a lesser sentence consistent with law.\n\f</pre>",
