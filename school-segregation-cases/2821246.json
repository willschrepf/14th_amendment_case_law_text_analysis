(\"Coastal\")  was\r<br>\r<br>          formed in  1989  as a  wholly-owned subsidiary  of Coastal  Fuels\r<br>\r<br>          Marketing,   Inc.  (\"CFMI\"),  a  company  that  ran  marine  fuel\r<br>\r<br>          operations in  numerous ports  using a staff  of sales  agents in\r<br>\r<br>          Miami,  Florida.  Caribbean  Petroleum Corp. (\"CAPECO\")  owns and\r<br>\r<br>          operates a  refinery in  Bayam n, Puerto  Rico, which  produces a\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          number of fuel products, as  well as residual fuel.   A principal\r<br>\r<br>          use of residual fuel is in the production of \"bunker fuel,\" which\r<br>\r<br>          is  used by cruise ships  and other ocean-going vessels outfitted\r<br>\r<br>          with internal combustion or steam engines.\r<br>\r<br>                    At trial,  Coastal  introduced  testimony  and  letters\r<br>\r<br>          showing that CAPECO  had committed to supply Coastal  on the same\r<br>\r<br>          terms and conditions as other resellers in San Juan, Puerto Rico,\r<br>\r<br>          in 1990, but Coastal deferred the start of its operations because\r<br>\r<br>          of uncertainty  due to the  Gulf War.  Eventually,  Coastal began\r<br>\r<br>          business operations in Puerto Rico in October 1991, buying bunker\r<br>\r<br>          fuel in San Juan and reselling it to ocean-going  liners at berth\r<br>\r<br>          in San Juan  Harbor.  Based on CFMI's  experience and reputation,\r<br>\r<br>          Coastal produced a business plan  which shows that it expected to\r<br>\r<br>          reach a  sales volume of  100,000 barrels a  month, approximately\r<br>\r<br>          25-30% of the  sales volume in  San Juan Harbor.   The plan  also\r<br>\r<br>          shows that  Coastal  assumed it  could  obtain an  average  gross\r<br>\r<br>          margin (sales revenues less product costs) of $1.65 a barrel.\r<br>\r<br>                    In  September  1991, CAPECO  agreed  to  charge Coastal\r<br>\r<br>          prices  based on a formula involving the previous Thursday/Friday\r<br>\r<br>          New York market postings, minus discounts that varied  by volume.\r<br>\r<br>          These prices were to cover the six month period from October 1991\r<br>\r<br>          to   March  1992.     Unknown  to  Coastal,   CAPECO  was  almost\r<br>\r<br>          simultaneously  offering Coastal's  two competitors  in San  Juan\r<br>\r<br>          Harbor, Caribbean Fuel Oil Trading, Inc. (\"Caribbean\") and Harbor\r<br>\r<br>          Fuel Services, Inc. (\"Harbor\"), new contracts that gave Caribbean\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          and Harbor bigger  discounts from the formula  price than Coastal\r<br>\r<br>          received.1   Trial  evidence introduced  by  CAPECO's own  expert\r<br>\r<br>          witness quantified  the total  price discrimination  in favor  of\r<br>\r<br>          Caribbean and Harbor as $682,451.78  for the period from  October\r<br>\r<br>          1991 to April 1992.\r<br>\r<br>                    Coastal filed this suit in  May of 1992 when it learned\r<br>\r<br>          of CAPECO's price discrimination against it.  This court affirmed\r<br>\r<br>          the district court's denial of a preliminary injunction requiring\r<br>\r<br>          that CAPECO end  its price discrimination.  See  Coastal Fuels of\r                                                      ___  ________________\r<br>\r<br>          Puerto Rico, Inc.  v. Caribbean Petroleum Corp., 990  F.2d 25, 26\r          _________________     _________________________\r<br>\r<br>          (1st Cir. 1993).  After Coastal filed suit, CAPECO proposed a new\r<br>\r<br>          price  formula  to   Coastal.    According  to   trial  testimony\r<br>\r<br>          introduced by Coastal, CAPECO basically  made a \"take it or leave\r<br>\r<br>          it\" offer,  which Coastal took.  Expert testimony Coastal offered\r<br>\r<br>          at   trial   contended  that   competitively   significant  price\r<br>\r<br>          discrimination  continued until Spring  of 1993, when  CAPECO cut\r<br>\r<br>          Coastal off entirely.\r<br>\r<br>                    Additionally,  Coastal presented  evidence that,  while\r<br>\r<br>          throughout  this period  CAPECO would  from time  to time  inform\r<br>\r<br>          Coastal  that it  had  no  fuel available,  in  fact, CAPECO  had\r<br>\r<br>          available  fuel.   Coastal also  presented evidence  that  it was\r<br>                              \r          ____________________\r<br>\r<br>          1  CAPECO  tried to argue below  and again argues here,  that the\r<br>          contracts   it   executed   with  Caribbean   and   Harbor   were\r<br>          qualitatively different  in their non-price  terms and conditions\r<br>          from CAPECO's arrangement with Coastal, justifying the discounts.\r<br>          Coastal  responds  that  it  was  never  offered  the  terms  and\r<br>          conditions that Caribbean  and Harbor received.  In  light of the\r<br>          jury's verdict  for Coastal  on the  price discrimination  claim,\r<br>          from conflicting evidence such as  this, we draw the (reasonable)\r<br>          conclusion in Coastal's favor.\r<br>\r<br>                                         -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          discriminated against  in terms  of the quality  of fuel  that it\r<br>\r<br>          received  from  CAPECO.    Finally,  on  March  31, 1993,  CAPECO\r<br>\r<br>          informed  Coastal in  writing that  it  would not  sell any  more\r<br>\r<br>          product to Coastal, and shortly  thereafter, Coastal went out  of\r<br>\r<br>          business.\r<br>\r<br>                    The case was tried to a jury on claims (1) that  CAPECO\r<br>\r<br>          discriminated  in  price in  violation  of  Section  2(a) of  the\r<br>\r<br>          Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 730 (1914) (current version  at 15 U.S.C.  \r<br>\r<br>          13(a)), as  amended by  the  Robinson-Patman Act,  49 Stat.  1526\r<br>\r<br>          (1936), and  in violation of  Section 263(a)  of Title 10  of the\r<br>\r<br>          Laws  of  Puerto  Rico;  (2)  that  CAPECO  monopolized trade  or\r<br>\r<br>          commerce in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act and Section\r<br>\r<br>          260 of  Title 10  of the  Laws of  Puerto Rico;  (3) that  CAPECO\r<br>\r<br>          violated Section  5141 of Title 31 of  the Puerto Rico Civil Code\r<br>\r<br>          by engaging in  tortious conduct  that injured  Coastal; and  (4)\r<br>\r<br>          that  CAPECO  committed a  breach  of  contract  in violation  of\r<br>\r<br>          Sections 3371 et  seq. of Title 31 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code.\r                        __  ____\r<br>\r<br>          As   reflected   in   the   jury's   answers   to   the   Special\r<br>\r<br>          Interrogatories, the jury found for Coastal on the first three of\r<br>\r<br>          these  claims, but  found for  CAPECO on  the breach  of contract\r<br>\r<br>          claim.

In  the instant\r<br>\r<br>          case, the price discrimination claims flow out of the same set of\r<br>\r<br>          facts and  require the same  evidence as the Sherman  Act claims.\r<br>\r<br>          Because  we uphold  the district  court's  jurisdiction over  the\r<br>\r<br>          Sherman Act  claims, see 15  U.S.C.   4 (1994)  (investing \"[t]he\r                               ___\r<br>\r<br>          several  district  courts  of  the  United  States  .  .  .  with\r<br>\r<br>          jurisdiction to  prevent and  restrain violations  of [Title  15]\r<br>\r<br>          sections 1 to 7[,]\" which includes the Sherman Act), we also must\r<br>\r<br>          conclude that the district court properly exercised supplementary\r<br>\r<br>          jurisdiction over the price discrimination claims.\r<br>\r<br>                    Thus,  we conclude  that the  district  court erred  in\r<br>\r<br>          applying section 2(a) of the Clayton Act to the conduct at issue,\r<br>\r<br>          and accordingly  reverse that part  of its opinion.   However, we\r<br>\r<br>          find applicable section 263 of the Puerto Rico Anti-Monopoly Act,\r<br>\r<br>          10 L.P.R.A.   263.  Because  section 263 was patterned after  and\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -13-\r                                         -13-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          is  almost identical  to  section  2(a) of  the  Clayton Act,  as\r<br>\r<br>          amended by the Robinson-Patman Act, we look to  the jurisprudence\r<br>\r<br>          interpreting federal  law as  a guide  in applying the  statute.6\r<br>\r<br>          Given that the one key  difference between the federal and Puerto\r<br>\r<br>          Rico statutes is the lack of an  \"in commerce\" requirement in the\r<br>\r<br>          Puerto  Rico analogue,  we  conclude  that  we  should  interpret\r<br>\r<br>          section 263 as intended to  extend the provisions of section 2(a)\r<br>\r<br>          of the  Clayton Act to  price discrimination within  Puerto Rico,\r<br>\r<br>          the situation which we  confront in the instant case.   Given the\r<br>\r<br>          relative lack  of applicable section  263 case law and  the well-\r<br>\r<br>          developed jurisprudence concerning  Clayton Act section 2(a),  we\r<br>\r<br>          will focus on  the latter in  assessing the price  discrimination\r<br>\r<br>          claims.\r<br>\r<br>                              2.

Coastal apparently had the\r<br>\r<br>          capacity to import the residual oil and diesel into San Juan from\r<br>\r<br>          Aruba.   Coastal also  had storage capacity.   CAPECO  feared, so\r<br>\r<br>          Coastal's theory  went, that  this would  allow  the refinery  in\r<br>\r<br>          Aruba to compete  with CAPECO  and threaten  CAPECO's ability  to\r<br>\r<br>          sell  its targeted  10,000 barrels  of  residual oil  per day  to\r<br>\r<br>          dealers.    Coastal's  argument  is  that  CAPECO,  fearing  that\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -28-\r                                         -28-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          Coastal's  affiliate posed a competitive threat, decided to drive\r<br>\r<br>          Coastal  out  by  (1) engaging  in  price  discrimination against\r<br>\r<br>          Coastal, (2) discriminating in the provision of residual oil, (3)\r<br>\r<br>          discriminating in the quality of the residual  oil available, and\r<br>\r<br>          (4) threatening to  cut off plaintiff entirely,  eventually doing\r<br>\r<br>          so.\r<br>\r<br>                    Coastal  successfully  argued  to  the  jury  that  the\r<br>\r<br>          relevant geographic market was San  Juan Harbor, since neither it\r<br>\r<br>          nor  its competitors,  Caribbean  and  Harbor, could  practicably\r<br>\r<br>          obtain supplies in San Juan Harbor from anyone other than CAPECO.\r<br>\r<br>          Coastal produced  evidence that CAPECO  made 90% of the  sales of\r<br>\r<br>          bunker  fuel to  resellers in the  San Juan Harbor  market -- and\r<br>\r<br>          CAPECO does not dispute this figure on appeal.\r<br>\r<br>                    CAPECO's main argument regarding monopoly power is that\r<br>\r<br>          the  choice  of  San  Juan  Harbor as  the  relevant  market  was\r<br>\r<br>          incorrect.  Instead, it maintains that because the broader market\r<br>\r<br>          for bunker fuel  among cruise ships and other  vessels plying the\r<br>\r<br>          waters  of the  Caribbean  and  the  southeastern  United  States\r<br>\r<br>          constrains the  prices CAPECO  can charge  resellers in  San Juan\r<br>\r<br>          Harbor, the proper geographic market should have been  defined to\r<br>\r<br>          include a much  wider area.  A larger geographic  market would of\r<br>\r<br>          course lead to a lower figure for the percentage of sales  in the\r<br>\r<br>          market made  by CAPECO, likely defeating the monopoly power prong\r<br>\r<br>          of the monopolization offense.\r<br>\r<br>                    In  assessing CAPECO's argument,  we must bear  in mind\r<br>\r<br>          that \"market definition is a  question of fact\" and \"we therefore\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -29-\r                                         -29-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          must affirm the jury's conclusion  unless the record is devoid of\r<br>\r<br>          evidence   upon  which  the   jury  might  reasonably   base  its\r<br>\r<br>          conclusion.\"  Weiss v.

Coastal presented  evidence that\r<br>\r<br>          resellers in San  Juan (Harbor, Caribbean and  Coastal) purchased\r<br>\r<br>          90% of their  supplies for bunker  fuel from CAPECO.   CAPECO, in\r<br>\r<br>          contrast,  has  argued  that  the  relevant  market  is  broader,\r<br>\r<br>          consisting of all  sales of residual oil  for bunker fuel in  the\r<br>\r<br>          Caribbean  and  Southeastern United  States.   Our review  of the\r<br>\r<br>          issue leads us to  conclude that it would  be unreasonable for  a\r<br>\r<br>          juror  to infer  from the  evidence presented  that the  sales of\r<br>\r<br>          residual  oil for  bunker  fuel  outside of  San  Juan should  be\r<br>\r<br>          excluded from the relevant market.\r<br>\r<br>                    The  residual oil CAPECO  sells is blended  with diesel\r<br>\r<br>          into bunker fuel  and sold by resellers like  Coastal, Harbor and\r<br>\r<br>          Caribbean  to large ocean-going  vessels.  Residual  oil refiners\r<br>\r<br>          and  bunker fuel  resellers exist  throughout  the Caribbean  and\r<br>\r<br>          Southeastern United States.   The parties  agree that the  ocean-\r<br>\r<br>          going vessels can choose to  refuel from whatever supplier in the\r<br>\r<br>          Caribbean and Southeastern United States offers the best terms as\r<br>\r<br>          to price, quality and dependability.   The market for bunker fuel\r<br>\r<br>          is  therefore extremely  fluid and  competitive,  as the  parties\r<br>\r<br>          agree.\r<br>\r<br>                    Coastal  argues  that,  because  of  this  competition,\r<br>\r<br>          margins  for  resellers  are  razor  thin  and  it  is  virtually\r<br>\r<br>          impossible for  a reseller in  San Juan, like Coastal,  to obtain\r<br>\r<br>          residual  oil  from  anyone  other  than  CAPECO.    Transporting\r<br>\r<br>          supplies from other  refineries, such as the refinery  Coastal is\r<br>\r<br>          affiliated with in  Aruba, would increase the cost of the fuel to\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -33-\r                                         -33-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          such an extent (transportation costs, import taxes, risk of price\r<br>\r<br>          changes, and storage costs) that it is not an economically viable\r<br>\r<br>          alternative.  (Of course, this is, it might be observed, somewhat\r<br>\r<br>          inconsistent with  the theory  that CAPECO was  so afraid  of the\r<br>\r<br>          'threat' from  Coastal and  its Aruba  affiliate,  that it  drove\r<br>\r<br>          Coastal  out   of  business.)     Consequently,  Coastal  argues,\r<br>\r<br>          resellers of bunker  fuel must purchase from CAPECO  when they do\r<br>\r<br>          business in San Juan.  In Coastal's view, the San Juan resellers'\r<br>\r<br>          inability to purchase  from suppliers outside  of San Juan  makes\r<br>\r<br>          San Juan the relevant market.\r<br>\r<br>                    We  do not agree.  The  touchstone of market definition\r<br>\r<br>          is whether  a hypothetical  monopolist could  raise prices.   See\r                                                                        ___\r<br>\r<br>          Rebel Oil Co., 51 F.3d at 1434.  Although a reseller based in San\r          _____________\r<br>\r<br>          Juan  may have nowhere else to turn  to in San Juan for its fuel,\r<br>\r<br>          Coastal  did  not  produce sufficient  evidence  that  this meant\r<br>\r<br>          CAPECO has the ability to restrict supply and raise prices in San\r<br>\r<br>          Juan to supracompetitive levels.   Indeed, the evidence points in\r<br>\r<br>          the other  direction.   CAPECO cannot sell  its residual  oil for\r<br>\r<br>          bunker fuel  unless it does so at a  price at which the resellers\r<br>\r<br>          will  be able  to sell  the fuel to  its ultimate  consumers, the\r<br>\r<br>          ocean-going vessels.   Those ocean-going vessels can  go anywhere\r<br>\r<br>          in the  Caribbean  and Southeastern  United States  to get  their\r<br>\r<br>          bunker  fuel.   If  CAPECO  were  to  raise  its  prices  to  the\r<br>\r<br>          resellers, the resellers  could not offer the bunker  fuel to the\r<br>\r<br>          ocean-going  vessels  at competitive  prices and  the ocean-going\r<br>\r<br>          vessels would simply get their fuel at another port.\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -34-\r                                         -34-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                    Given these facts, the immobility of the resellers does\r<br>\r<br>          not mean  that CAPECO could  maximize profits  by raising  prices\r<br>\r<br>          significantly above the competitive level.  Raising prices in San\r<br>\r<br>          Juan  would repel the  ultimate consumers,  who would  seek other\r<br>\r<br>          suppliers.  The  resellers would either stop  purchasing residual\r<br>\r<br>          fuel or  cease business,  or both.   CAPECO would  then lose  its\r<br>\r<br>          ability  to sell its residual oil for  bunker fuel and this would\r<br>\r<br>          redound to the benefit of CAPECO's competitors.  While under most\r<br>\r<br>          circumstances  the  immobility  of  the  resellers  would  be  of\r<br>\r<br>          considerable  importance  in  defining the  market,  it  does not\r<br>\r<br>          control  here  where  the  mobility  of  the  ultimate  consumers\r<br>\r<br>          protects  the immobile resellers.

For example,  it could have charged the jury  with\r<br>\r<br>          tortious interference  with contractual  relations, since  CAPECO\r<br>\r<br>          may well have intentionally complicated, via its refusal to deal,\r<br>\r<br>          Coastal's efforts to meet its obligations to deliver bunker fuel.\r<br>\r<br>          See General Office Products Corp. v.

As  we have noted above,  Coastal may\r          _______\r<br>\r<br>          have had a  legitimate Article 1802 claim apart  from any overlap\r<br>\r<br>          with antitrust law.  Had CAPECO chosen to object to  the district\r<br>\r<br>          court's  instructions, the district court may have corrected this\r<br>\r<br>          problem.  Accordingly,  giving the district court the  benefit of\r<br>\r<br>          the doubt, had  it responded to a timely  objection by CAPECO and\r<br>\r<br>          given  an  Article 1802  instruction  that did  not  overlap with\r<br>\r<br>          antitrust  claims,  the  jury's  damages  verdicts  on  tort  and\r<br>\r<br>          antitrust  claims could  have been  consistent.   Even  assuming,\r<br>\r<br>          arguendo,   that  CAPECO  correctly  asserts  that  such  overlap\r          ________\r<br>\r<br>          occurred,  to grant  CAPECO  a new  trial  now  on the  basis  of\r<br>\r<br>          duplicative recovery  would allow it  to avoid the result  of its\r<br>\r<br>          own failure to object to the Article 1802 instruction.\r<br>\r<br>                                 B.

The  district court's  June  22, 1993\r<br>\r<br>          Scheduling Order  stated that  \"[t]he parties  will announce  the\r<br>\r<br>          names and  qualifications of their  experts by October  1, 1993.\"\r<br>\r<br>          This  date was  modified subsequently  to December  1, 1993.   In\r<br>\r<br>          compliance  with   this  order,  CAPECO   named  C sar   Figueroa\r<br>\r<br>          (\"Figueroa\")    and    Rafael    Mart nez-Margarida   (\"Mart nez-\r<br>\r<br>          Margarida\").   On March  1, 1994,  pursuant to  a  motion by  new\r<br>\r<br>          counsel for Caribbean,  the district court modified  the previous\r<br>\r<br>          order and issued a revised  scheduling order stating \"all experts\r<br>\r<br>          are to be announced by March 30,\" and also specifying that expert\r<br>\r<br>          reports to be used \"during each party's case-in-chief\" were to be\r<br>\r<br>          exchanged on June 3, 1994,  and that expert rebuttal reports were\r<br>\r<br>          to be exchanged  on July 1, 1994.   Upon CAPECO's June  1 motion,\r<br>\r<br>          the date for reports to be exchanged was extended  by an \"Omnibus\r<br>\r<br>          Order\" to  ten days after service of that order, dated August 15,\r<br>\r<br>          1994.   On August  29, 1994, Coastal  delivered to  CAPECO expert\r<br>\r<br>          reports  prepared by  Dr. Sherwin  and  Dr. Zalacain, and  CAPECO\r<br>\r<br>          provided  Coastal with  an expert  report  prepared by  Figueroa.\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -45-\r                                         -45-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          These  experts were deposed between September 9 and September 14,\r<br>\r<br>          and  thereafter  CAPECO  retained  experts  Dr.  Freyre  and  Dr.\r<br>\r<br>          Guti rrez ostensibly as  rebuttal witnesses under Fed. R. Civ. P.\r<br>\r<br>          26(a)(2)(C).  CAPECO informed Coastal on September 20, 1994, that\r<br>\r<br>          it had retained  Dr. Freyre as a rebuttal  witness, and similarly\r<br>\r<br>          informed Coastal  of Dr. Guti rrez  on or about October  4, 1994.\r<br>\r<br>          CAPECO informed  the  district court  about  Dr. Freyre  and  Dr.\r<br>\r<br>          Guti rrez on October 5, 1995.\r<br>\r<br>                    The  district  court   instructed  CAPECO  to   produce\r<br>\r<br>          Dr. Freyre  and Dr.  Guti rrez  and to  make  them available  for\r<br>\r<br>          depositions.  On  October 5 and October 6,  Coastal filed motions\r<br>\r<br>          in limine to  exclude Dr. Freyre and Dr. Guti rrez, respectively,\r<br>\r<br>          on   the  theory   that  neither   witness   could  properly   be\r<br>\r<br>          characterized as  a \"rebuttal\" witness within the meaning of Rule\r<br>\r<br>          26(a)(2)(C), and thus both should have been disclosed previously.\r<br>\r<br>          After  oral argument, the district court granted Coastal's motion\r<br>\r<br>          and excluded the testimony of  Dr. Freyre and Dr. Guti rrez.  The\r<br>\r<br>          district court, upon  CAPECO's admission that  it planned to  use\r<br>\r<br>          Dr. Freyre  and Dr. Guti rrez  in its  case-in-chief, noted  that\r<br>\r<br>          \"you got a problem  with my orders because you  have not complied\r<br>\r<br>          with my orders  insofar as Freyre and Guti rrez [are] concerned,\"\r<br>\r<br>          apparently referring  to the  previous scheduling order  deadline\r<br>\r<br>          for experts in the case-in-chief to be disclosed.\r<br>\r<br>                    CAPECO  argues (1) that  because the Omnibus  Order did\r<br>\r<br>          not  provide  a deadline  for  the  exchange  of rebuttal  expert\r<br>\r<br>          reports,   no  scheduling  order   applied,  and   therefore  the\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -46-\r                                         -46-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          disclosure of Dr. Freyre and Dr. Guti rrez was controlled by Rule\r<br>\r<br>          26(a)(2)(C);17  and (2) that the district court misconstrued Rule\r<br>\r<br>          26(a)(2)(C) to signify that a defendant cannot offer testimony to\r<br>\r<br>          \"contradict  or  rebut\"  under  Rule 26(a)(2)(C).    We  need not\r<br>\r<br>          consider whether  the district  court in  fact misconstrued  Rule\r<br>\r<br>          26(a)(2)(C),  because,  for three  reasons, we  find no  abuse of\r<br>\r<br>          discretion  in its  exclusion  of  these  witnesses  as  rebuttal\r<br>\r<br>          witnesses.  First, at no time  did CAPECO ever seek leave of  the\r<br>\r<br>          court  to  announce  the  names  of  experts  not  disclosed   by\r<br>\r<br>          December 1, 1993, as  originally required, or by  March 30, 1994,\r<br>\r<br>          as  permitted by  the  trial court.   CAPECO's  motion of  June 1\r<br>\r<br>          sought extension  principally  due to  alleged noncooperation  by\r<br>\r<br>          Coastal  in discovery, making CAPECO's experts' task difficult to\r<br>\r<br>          complete by the deadline then in effect.  We cannot  conclude, as\r<br>\r<br>          CAPECO  does, that  the Omnibus  Order's  extension rendered  all\r<br>\r<br>          other  orders unbinding.   Because  CAPECO  did not  ask for  its\r<br>\r<br>          extension on the grounds it  now argues, the district court could\r<br>\r<br>          not  have  had  such an  effect  in  mind, nor  was  it  given an\r<br>\r<br>          opportunity to consider such effect.   A trial court may \"readily\r<br>\r<br>          exclude a  witness or exhibit  if some previous  order had set  a\r<br>\r<br>          deadline  for  identification and  the  proponent [has],  without\r<br>\r<br>          adequate excuse, failed  to list the witness or  exhibit.\"  Fusco\r                                                                      _____\r<br>\r<br>                              \r          ____________________\r<br>\r<br>          17    Rule  26's   schedule  concerning  the  duty   to  disclose\r<br>          information concerning expert witnesses and their opinions may be\r<br>          altered by  the court.

The  proximity in time  between\r<br>\r<br>          CAPECO's attempts  to bring in  Dr. Freyre and Dr.  Guti rrez and\r<br>\r<br>          actual trial casts doubt on  any argument that CAPECO was somehow\r<br>\r<br>          misled  into thinking  that previous  Scheduling  Orders did  not\r<br>\r<br>          apply.   Finally, even assuming  that CAPECO is correct  that the\r<br>\r<br>          Scheduling Order's  provisions regarding  rebuttal witnesses  had\r<br>\r<br>          been superceded and  thus Rule 26(a)(2)(B) applied,  the district\r<br>\r<br>          court  might still have enforced its previous deadlines regarding\r<br>\r<br>          experts in the case-in-chief.  For  better or for worse, at  oral\r<br>\r<br>          argument  on October  21, 1994  (three days  before trial  was to\r<br>\r<br>          start),   counsel  for  CAPECO  identified  Dr.  Freyre  and  Dr.\r<br>\r<br>          Guti rrez as witnesses in its case-in-chief.18\r<br>\r<br>                    Given  the circumstances, we  cannot conclude  that the\r<br>\r<br>          exclusion of the testimony of Dr. Freyre and Dr. Guti rrez was an\r<br>\r<br>          abuse of discretion warranting a new trial.\r<br>\r<br>                       C.

Therefore, we do not find abuse of discretion in\r<br>\r<br>          the district court's denial of a  new trial based on its  refusal\r<br>\r<br>          to issue a jury instruction on the meeting competition defense.\r<br>\r<br>                    D.  CAPECO's Puerto Rico Law Tort Counterclaim\r                    D.  CAPECO's Puerto Rico Law Tort Counterclaim\r<br>\r<br>                    CAPECO  contends  that  the  district  court  erred  in\r<br>\r<br>          dismissing its counterclaim grounded in Article 1802, 31 L.P.R.A.\r<br>\r<br>            5141.  According  to CAPECO, it  was a compulsory  counterclaim\r<br>\r<br>          and was thus  not barred by the one year  statute of limitations,\r<br>\r<br>          at least to the extent of defeating the main claim.\r<br>\r<br>                    We reject CAPECO's argument for two reasons.  First, in\r<br>\r<br>          opposition  to Coastal's  motion  for  summary  judgment  on  the\r<br>\r<br>          counterclaim,  it failed  to  inform the  district  court of  the\r<br>\r<br>          theory  it  now  advances,  that  it is  entitled  to  recoupment\r<br>\r<br>          notwithstanding the  statute of  limitations.   Additionally, the\r<br>\r<br>          gist of CAPECO's counterclaim argument  was that the threat posed\r<br>\r<br>          by Coastal and CFMI allegedly working in concert forced CAPECO to\r<br>\r<br>          give Harbor  and  Caribbean discounts,  costing CAPECO  potential\r<br>\r<br>          profits.  Given that we  uphold the district court's finding that\r<br>\r<br>          these  discounts were illegal price discrimination, it appears at\r<br>\r<br>          least doubtful under Puerto Rico  law that CAPECO can collect for\r<br>\r<br>          any lost profits thereby incurred.

CAPECO's failure  to\r<br>\r<br>          make the points below that it now argues on appeal hamstrung  its\r<br>\r<br>          attempt to obtain  reversal of the price discrimination  and tort\r<br>\r<br>          claims.  But  the definition of relevant  market Coastal espoused\r<br>\r<br>          could  not  be  reasonably  adopted  by  the  jury,  since   this\r<br>\r<br>          definition  was legally insufficient in neglecting to account for\r<br>\r<br>          downstream constraints on  the proposed monopoly, and  in failing\r<br>\r<br>          to draw on  sufficient evidence regarding those constraints.\r<br>\r<br>                    For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district\r<br>\r<br>          court is affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.\r                   ________________  ________________      ________\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -51-\r                                         -51-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br></pre>\n\n</div>",

(\"CFMI\"),  a  company  that  ran  marine  fuel\r<br>\r<br>          operations in  numerous ports  using a staff  of sales  agents in\r<br>\r<br>          Miami,  Florida.  Caribbean  Petroleum Corp. (\"CAPECO\")  owns and\r<br>\r<br>          operates a  refinery in  Bayam n, Puerto  Rico, which  produces a\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          number of fuel products, as  well as residual fuel.   A principal\r<br>\r<br>          use of residual fuel is in the production of \"bunker fuel,\" which\r<br>\r<br>          is  used by cruise ships  and other ocean-going vessels outfitted\r<br>\r<br>          with internal combustion or steam engines.\r<br>\r<br>                    At trial,  Coastal  introduced  testimony  and  letters\r<br>\r<br>          showing that CAPECO  had committed to supply Coastal  on the same\r<br>\r<br>          terms and conditions as other resellers in San Juan, Puerto Rico,\r<br>\r<br>          in 1990, but Coastal deferred the start of its operations because\r<br>\r<br>          of uncertainty  due to the  Gulf War.  Eventually,  Coastal began\r<br>\r<br>          business operations in Puerto Rico in October 1991, buying bunker\r<br>\r<br>          fuel in San Juan and reselling it to ocean-going  liners at berth\r<br>\r<br>          in San Juan  Harbor.  Based on CFMI's  experience and reputation,\r<br>\r<br>          Coastal produced a business plan  which shows that it expected to\r<br>\r<br>          reach a  sales volume of  100,000 barrels a  month, approximately\r<br>\r<br>          25-30% of the  sales volume in  San Juan Harbor.   The plan  also\r<br>\r<br>          shows that  Coastal  assumed it  could  obtain an  average  gross\r<br>\r<br>          margin (sales revenues less product costs) of $1.65 a barrel.\r<br>\r<br>                    In  September  1991, CAPECO  agreed  to  charge Coastal\r<br>\r<br>          prices  based on a formula involving the previous Thursday/Friday\r<br>\r<br>          New York market postings, minus discounts that varied  by volume.\r<br>\r<br>          These prices were to cover the six month period from October 1991\r<br>\r<br>          to   March  1992.     Unknown  to  Coastal,   CAPECO  was  almost\r<br>\r<br>          simultaneously  offering Coastal's  two competitors  in San  Juan\r<br>\r<br>          Harbor, Caribbean Fuel Oil Trading, Inc.

This court affirmed\r<br>\r<br>          the district court's denial of a preliminary injunction requiring\r<br>\r<br>          that CAPECO end  its price discrimination.

After Coastal filed suit, CAPECO proposed a new\r<br>\r<br>          price  formula  to   Coastal.    According  to   trial  testimony\r<br>\r<br>          introduced by Coastal, CAPECO basically  made a \"take it or leave\r<br>\r<br>          it\" offer,  which Coastal took.  Expert testimony Coastal offered\r<br>\r<br>          at   trial   contended  that   competitively   significant  price\r<br>\r<br>          discrimination  continued until Spring  of 1993, when  CAPECO cut\r<br>\r<br>          Coastal off entirely.\r<br>\r<br>                    Additionally,  Coastal presented  evidence that,  while\r<br>\r<br>          throughout  this period  CAPECO would  from time  to time  inform\r<br>\r<br>          Coastal  that it  had  no  fuel available,  in  fact, CAPECO  had\r<br>\r<br>          available  fuel.

And if CAPECO did intend  to express this\r<br>\r<br>          argument, it  neither advised  the district  court judge  of this\r<br>\r<br>          problem in  a manner that  would allow him to  make a correction,\r<br>\r<br>          nor informed  him what a satisfactory  cure would be.

Given the\r<br>\r<br>          relative lack  of applicable section  263 case law and  the well-\r<br>\r<br>          developed jurisprudence concerning  Clayton Act section 2(a),  we\r<br>\r<br>          will focus on  the latter in  assessing the price  discrimination\r<br>\r<br>          claims.\r<br>\r<br>                              2.

Coastal apparently had the\r<br>\r<br>          capacity to import the residual oil and diesel into San Juan from\r<br>\r<br>          Aruba.   Coastal also  had storage capacity.   CAPECO  feared, so\r<br>\r<br>          Coastal's theory  went, that  this would  allow  the refinery  in\r<br>\r<br>          Aruba to compete  with CAPECO  and threaten  CAPECO's ability  to\r<br>\r<br>          sell  its targeted  10,000 barrels  of  residual oil  per day  to\r<br>\r<br>          dealers.

Instead, it maintains that because the broader market\r<br>\r<br>          for bunker fuel  among cruise ships and other  vessels plying the\r<br>\r<br>          waters  of the  Caribbean  and  the  southeastern  United  States\r<br>\r<br>          constrains the  prices CAPECO  can charge  resellers in  San Juan\r<br>\r<br>          Harbor, the proper geographic market should have been  defined to\r<br>\r<br>          include a much  wider area.  A larger geographic  market would of\r<br>\r<br>          course lead to a lower figure for the percentage of sales  in the\r<br>\r<br>          market made  by CAPECO, likely defeating the monopoly power prong\r<br>\r<br>          of the monopolization offense.\r<br>\r<br>                    In  assessing CAPECO's argument,  we must bear  in mind\r<br>\r<br>          that \"market definition is a  question of fact\" and \"we therefore\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -29-\r                                         -29-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          must affirm the jury's conclusion  unless the record is devoid of\r<br>\r<br>          evidence   upon  which  the   jury  might  reasonably   base  its\r<br>\r<br>          conclusion.\"  Weiss v.

CAPECO, in\r<br>\r<br>          contrast,  has  argued  that  the  relevant  market  is  broader,\r<br>\r<br>          consisting of all  sales of residual oil  for bunker fuel in  the\r<br>\r<br>          Caribbean  and  Southeastern United  States.   Our review  of the\r<br>\r<br>          issue leads us to  conclude that it would  be unreasonable for  a\r<br>\r<br>          juror  to infer  from the  evidence presented  that the  sales of\r<br>\r<br>          residual  oil for  bunker  fuel  outside of  San  Juan should  be\r<br>\r<br>          excluded from the relevant market.\r<br>\r<br>                    The  residual oil CAPECO  sells is blended  with diesel\r<br>\r<br>          into bunker fuel  and sold by resellers like  Coastal, Harbor and\r<br>\r<br>          Caribbean  to large ocean-going  vessels.  Residual  oil refiners\r<br>\r<br>          and  bunker fuel  resellers exist  throughout  the Caribbean  and\r<br>\r<br>          Southeastern United States.   The parties  agree that the  ocean-\r<br>\r<br>          going vessels can choose to  refuel from whatever supplier in the\r<br>\r<br>          Caribbean and Southeastern United States offers the best terms as\r<br>\r<br>          to price, quality and dependability.   The market for bunker fuel\r<br>\r<br>          is  therefore extremely  fluid and  competitive,  as the  parties\r<br>\r<br>          agree.\r<br>\r<br>                    Coastal  argues  that,  because  of  this  competition,\r<br>\r<br>          margins  for  resellers  are  razor  thin  and  it  is  virtually\r<br>\r<br>          impossible for  a reseller in  San Juan, like Coastal,  to obtain\r<br>\r<br>          residual  oil  from  anyone  other  than  CAPECO.    Transporting\r<br>\r<br>          supplies from other  refineries, such as the refinery  Coastal is\r<br>\r<br>          affiliated with in  Aruba, would increase the cost of the fuel to\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -33-\r                                         -33-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          such an extent (transportation costs, import taxes, risk of price\r<br>\r<br>          changes, and storage costs) that it is not an economically viable\r<br>\r<br>          alternative.  (Of course, this is, it might be observed, somewhat\r<br>\r<br>          inconsistent with  the theory  that CAPECO was  so afraid  of the\r<br>\r<br>          'threat' from  Coastal and  its Aruba  affiliate,  that it  drove\r<br>\r<br>          Coastal  out   of  business.)     Consequently,  Coastal  argues,\r<br>\r<br>          resellers of bunker  fuel must purchase from CAPECO  when they do\r<br>\r<br>          business in San Juan.  In Coastal's view, the San Juan resellers'\r<br>\r<br>          inability to purchase  from suppliers outside  of San Juan  makes\r<br>\r<br>          San Juan the relevant market.\r<br>\r<br>                    We  do not agree.  The  touchstone of market definition\r<br>\r<br>          is whether  a hypothetical  monopolist could  raise prices.   See\r                                                                        ___\r<br>\r<br>          Rebel Oil Co., 51 F.3d at 1434.  Although a reseller based in San\r          _____________\r<br>\r<br>          Juan  may have nowhere else to turn  to in San Juan for its fuel,\r<br>\r<br>          Coastal  did  not  produce sufficient  evidence  that  this meant\r<br>\r<br>          CAPECO has the ability to restrict supply and raise prices in San\r<br>\r<br>          Juan to supracompetitive levels.   Indeed, the evidence points in\r<br>\r<br>          the other  direction.   CAPECO cannot sell  its residual  oil for\r<br>\r<br>          bunker fuel  unless it does so at a  price at which the resellers\r<br>\r<br>          will  be able  to sell  the fuel to  its ultimate  consumers, the\r<br>\r<br>          ocean-going vessels.   Those ocean-going vessels can  go anywhere\r<br>\r<br>          in the  Caribbean  and Southeastern  United States  to get  their\r<br>\r<br>          bunker  fuel.   If  CAPECO  were  to  raise  its  prices  to  the\r<br>\r<br>          resellers, the resellers  could not offer the bunker  fuel to the\r<br>\r<br>          ocean-going  vessels  at competitive  prices and  the ocean-going\r<br>\r<br>          vessels would simply get their fuel at another port.\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -34-\r                                         -34-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                    Given these facts, the immobility of the resellers does\r<br>\r<br>          not mean  that CAPECO could  maximize profits  by raising  prices\r<br>\r<br>          significantly above the competitive level.  Raising prices in San\r<br>\r<br>          Juan  would repel the  ultimate consumers,  who would  seek other\r<br>\r<br>          suppliers.  The  resellers would either stop  purchasing residual\r<br>\r<br>          fuel or  cease business,  or both.   CAPECO would  then lose  its\r<br>\r<br>          ability  to sell its residual oil for  bunker fuel and this would\r<br>\r<br>          redound to the benefit of CAPECO's competitors.  While under most\r<br>\r<br>          circumstances  the  immobility  of  the  resellers  would  be  of\r<br>\r<br>          considerable  importance  in  defining the  market,  it  does not\r<br>\r<br>          control  here  where  the  mobility  of  the  ultimate  consumers\r<br>\r<br>          protects  the immobile resellers.

Accordingly,  giving the district court the  benefit of\r<br>\r<br>          the doubt, had  it responded to a timely  objection by CAPECO and\r<br>\r<br>          given  an  Article 1802  instruction  that did  not  overlap with\r<br>\r<br>          antitrust  claims,  the  jury's  damages  verdicts  on  tort  and\r<br>\r<br>          antitrust  claims could  have been  consistent.   Even  assuming,\r<br>\r<br>          arguendo,   that  CAPECO  correctly  asserts  that  such  overlap\r          ________\r<br>\r<br>          occurred,  to grant  CAPECO  a new  trial  now  on the  basis  of\r<br>\r<br>          duplicative recovery  would allow it  to avoid the result  of its\r<br>\r<br>          own failure to object to the Article 1802 instruction.\r<br>\r<br>                                 B.  CAPECO's Experts\r                                 B.  CAPECO's Experts\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -44-\r                                         -44-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                    Additionally, CAPECO  argues that the  district court's\r<br>\r<br>          refusal to allow its two experts, Dr. Jorge Freyre (\"Dr. Freyre\")\r<br>\r<br>          and  Dr. El as Guti rrez (\"Dr.  Guti rrez\"), to testify was based\r<br>\r<br>          on a fundamental error of law and was an abuse of discretion that\r<br>\r<br>          requires  that we  reverse the  district  court and  order a  new\r<br>\r<br>          trial.\r<br>\r<br>                    In  order  to evaluate  CAPECO's  contentions, we  must\r<br>\r<br>          review the district court's orders leading up to the exclusion of\r<br>\r<br>          the  relevant  testimony.   The  district court's  June  22, 1993\r<br>\r<br>          Scheduling Order  stated that  \"[t]he parties  will announce  the\r<br>\r<br>          names and  qualifications of their  experts by October  1, 1993.\"\r<br>\r<br>          This  date was  modified subsequently  to December  1, 1993.   In\r<br>\r<br>          compliance  with   this  order,  CAPECO   named  C sar   Figueroa\r<br>\r<br>          (\"Figueroa\")    and    Rafael    Mart nez-Margarida   (\"Mart nez-\r<br>\r<br>          Margarida\").   On March  1, 1994,  pursuant to  a  motion by  new\r<br>\r<br>          counsel for Caribbean,  the district court modified  the previous\r<br>\r<br>          order and issued a revised  scheduling order stating \"all experts\r<br>\r<br>          are to be announced by March 30,\" and also specifying that expert\r<br>\r<br>          reports to be used \"during each party's case-in-chief\" were to be\r<br>\r<br>          exchanged on June 3, 1994,  and that expert rebuttal reports were\r<br>\r<br>          to be exchanged  on July 1, 1994.   Upon CAPECO's June  1 motion,\r<br>\r<br>          the date for reports to be exchanged was extended  by an \"Omnibus\r<br>\r<br>          Order\" to  ten days after service of that order, dated August 15,\r<br>\r<br>          1994.   On August  29, 1994, Coastal  delivered to  CAPECO expert\r<br>\r<br>          reports  prepared by  Dr. Sherwin  and  Dr. Zalacain, and  CAPECO\r<br>\r<br>          provided  Coastal with  an expert  report  prepared by  Figueroa.\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -45-\r                                         -45-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          These  experts were deposed between September 9 and September 14,\r<br>\r<br>          and  thereafter  CAPECO  retained  experts  Dr.  Freyre  and  Dr.\r<br>\r<br>          Guti rrez ostensibly as  rebuttal witnesses under Fed. R. Civ. P.\r<br>\r<br>          26(a)(2)(C).  CAPECO informed Coastal on September 20, 1994, that\r<br>\r<br>          it had retained  Dr. Freyre as a rebuttal  witness, and similarly\r<br>\r<br>          informed Coastal  of Dr. Guti rrez  on or about October  4, 1994.\r<br>\r<br>          CAPECO informed  the  district court  about  Dr. Freyre  and  Dr.\r<br>\r<br>          Guti rrez on October 5, 1995.\r<br>\r<br>                    The  district  court   instructed  CAPECO  to   produce\r<br>\r<br>          Dr. Freyre  and Dr.  Guti rrez  and to  make  them available  for\r<br>\r<br>          depositions.  On  October 5 and October 6,  Coastal filed motions\r<br>\r<br>          in limine to  exclude Dr. Freyre and Dr. Guti rrez, respectively,\r<br>\r<br>          on   the  theory   that  neither   witness   could  properly   be\r<br>\r<br>          characterized as  a \"rebuttal\" witness within the meaning of Rule\r<br>\r<br>          26(a)(2)(C), and thus both should have been disclosed previously.\r<br>\r<br>          After  oral argument, the district court granted Coastal's motion\r<br>\r<br>          and excluded the testimony of  Dr. Freyre and Dr. Guti rrez.  The\r<br>\r<br>          district court, upon  CAPECO's admission that  it planned to  use\r<br>\r<br>          Dr. Freyre  and Dr. Guti rrez  in its  case-in-chief, noted  that\r<br>\r<br>          \"you got a problem  with my orders because you  have not complied\r<br>\r<br>          with my orders  insofar as Freyre and Guti rrez [are] concerned,\"\r<br>\r<br>          apparently referring  to the  previous scheduling order  deadline\r<br>\r<br>          for experts in the case-in-chief to be disclosed.\r<br>\r<br>                    CAPECO  argues (1) that  because the Omnibus  Order did\r<br>\r<br>          not  provide  a deadline  for  the  exchange  of rebuttal  expert\r<br>\r<br>          reports,   no  scheduling  order   applied,  and   therefore  the\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -46-\r                                         -46-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          disclosure of Dr. Freyre and Dr. Guti rrez was controlled by Rule\r<br>\r<br>          26(a)(2)(C);17  and (2) that the district court misconstrued Rule\r<br>\r<br>          26(a)(2)(C) to signify that a defendant cannot offer testimony to\r<br>\r<br>          \"contradict  or  rebut\"  under  Rule 26(a)(2)(C).    We  need not\r<br>\r<br>          consider whether  the district  court in  fact misconstrued  Rule\r<br>\r<br>          26(a)(2)(C),  because,  for three  reasons, we  find no  abuse of\r<br>\r<br>          discretion  in its  exclusion  of  these  witnesses  as  rebuttal\r<br>\r<br>          witnesses.  First, at no time  did CAPECO ever seek leave of  the\r<br>\r<br>          court  to  announce  the  names  of  experts  not  disclosed   by\r<br>\r<br>          December 1, 1993, as  originally required, or by  March 30, 1994,\r<br>\r<br>          as  permitted by  the  trial court.   CAPECO's  motion of  June 1\r<br>\r<br>          sought extension  principally  due to  alleged noncooperation  by\r<br>\r<br>          Coastal  in discovery, making CAPECO's experts' task difficult to\r<br>\r<br>          complete by the deadline then in effect.  We cannot  conclude, as\r<br>\r<br>          CAPECO  does, that  the Omnibus  Order's  extension rendered  all\r<br>\r<br>          other  orders unbinding.   Because  CAPECO  did not  ask for  its\r<br>\r<br>          extension on the grounds it  now argues, the district court could\r<br>\r<br>          not  have  had  such an  effect  in  mind, nor  was  it  given an\r<br>\r<br>          opportunity to consider such effect.   A trial court may \"readily\r<br>\r<br>          exclude a  witness or exhibit  if some previous  order had set  a\r<br>\r<br>          deadline  for  identification and  the  proponent [has],  without\r<br>\r<br>          adequate excuse, failed  to list the witness or  exhibit.\"  Fusco\r                                                                      _____\r<br>\r<br>                              \r          ____________________\r<br>\r<br>          17    Rule  26's   schedule  concerning  the  duty   to  disclose\r<br>          information concerning expert witnesses and their opinions may be\r<br>          altered by  the court.

The  proximity in time  between\r<br>\r<br>          CAPECO's attempts  to bring in  Dr. Freyre and Dr.  Guti rrez and\r<br>\r<br>          actual trial casts doubt on  any argument that CAPECO was somehow\r<br>\r<br>          misled  into thinking  that previous  Scheduling  Orders did  not\r<br>\r<br>          apply.   Finally, even assuming  that CAPECO is correct  that the\r<br>\r<br>          Scheduling Order's  provisions regarding  rebuttal witnesses  had\r<br>\r<br>          been superceded and  thus Rule 26(a)(2)(B) applied,  the district\r<br>\r<br>          court  might still have enforced its previous deadlines regarding\r<br>\r<br>          experts in the case-in-chief.  For  better or for worse, at  oral\r<br>\r<br>          argument  on October  21, 1994  (three days  before trial  was to\r<br>\r<br>          start),   counsel  for  CAPECO  identified  Dr.  Freyre  and  Dr.\r<br>\r<br>          Guti rrez as witnesses in its case-in-chief.18\r<br>\r<br>                    Given  the circumstances, we  cannot conclude  that the\r<br>\r<br>          exclusion of the testimony of Dr. Freyre and Dr. Guti rrez was an\r<br>\r<br>          abuse of discretion warranting a new trial.\r<br>\r<br>                       C.

Section  2(b) of  Clayton Act,  as amended  by the\r<br>\r<br>          Robinson-Patman Act, permits a defendant  to rebut a prima  facie\r                                                               _____  _____\r<br>\r<br>          case of violation  by showing that its  lower price \"was made  in\r<br>\r<br>          good faith to  meet an equally  low price of  a competitor.\"   15\r<br>\r<br>          U.S.C.    13(b).

CAPECO's Puerto Rico Law Tort Counterclaim\r                    D.  CAPECO's Puerto Rico Law Tort Counterclaim\r<br>\r<br>                    CAPECO  contends  that  the  district  court  erred  in\r<br>\r<br>          dismissing its counterclaim grounded in Article 1802, 31 L.P.R.A.\r<br>\r<br>            5141.  According  to CAPECO, it  was a compulsory  counterclaim\r<br>\r<br>          and was thus  not barred by the one year  statute of limitations,\r<br>\r<br>          at least to the extent of defeating the main claim.\r<br>\r<br>                    We reject CAPECO's argument for two reasons.  First, in\r<br>\r<br>          opposition  to Coastal's  motion  for  summary  judgment  on  the\r<br>\r<br>          counterclaim,  it failed  to  inform the  district  court of  the\r<br>\r<br>          theory  it  now  advances,  that  it is  entitled  to  recoupment\r<br>\r<br>          notwithstanding the  statute of  limitations.   Additionally, the\r<br>\r<br>          gist of CAPECO's counterclaim argument  was that the threat posed\r<br>\r<br>          by Coastal and CFMI allegedly working in concert forced CAPECO to\r<br>\r<br>          give Harbor  and  Caribbean discounts,  costing CAPECO  potential\r<br>\r<br>          profits.  Given that we  uphold the district court's finding that\r<br>\r<br>          these  discounts were illegal price discrimination, it appears at\r<br>\r<br>          least doubtful under Puerto Rico  law that CAPECO can collect for\r<br>\r<br>          any lost profits thereby incurred.  See, e.g., Rubio-Sacarello v.\r                                              ___  ____  _______________\r<br>\r<br>          Roig,  84 D.P.R.  344, 351  (P.R. 1962)  (stating, in  a contract\r          ____\r<br>\r<br>          context, that  one who  is guilty of  illegality cannot  bring an\r<br>\r<br>          action).  As a result, we fail to find abuse of discretion by the\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -50-\r                                         -50-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          district court  in its decision not to grant  a new trial on this\r<br>\r<br>          basis.\r<br>\r<br>                                      CONCLUSION\r                                      CONCLUSION\r                                      __________\r<br>\r<br>                    Coastal   succeeded  below   on  three   claims:  price\r<br>\r<br>          discrimination, monopolization  and  tort.   CAPECO's failure  to\r<br>\r<br>          make the points below that it now argues on appeal hamstrung  its\r<br>\r<br>          attempt to obtain  reversal of the price discrimination  and tort\r<br>\r<br>          claims.  But  the definition of relevant  market Coastal espoused\r<br>\r<br>          could  not  be  reasonably  adopted  by  the  jury,  since   this\r<br>\r<br>          definition  was legally insufficient in neglecting to account for\r<br>\r<br>          downstream constraints on  the proposed monopoly, and  in failing\r<br>\r<br>          to draw on  sufficient evidence regarding those constraints.\r<br>\r<br>                    For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district\r<br>\r<br>          court is affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.\r                   ________________  ________________      ________\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         -51-\r                                         -51-\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br></pre>\n\n</div>",
