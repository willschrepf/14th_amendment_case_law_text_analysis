Debevoise, Senior United\nStates District Judge for the District of New Jersey, sitting by\ndesignation.\n\n                               2\n\f                 OPINION OF THE COURT\n\n\nDebevoise, Senior District Judge\n\n        Petitioner, Lorraine Fiadjoe, petitions for review of\norders of the Board of Immigration Appeals (“BIA”) denying\nher application for asylum, withholding of removal and relief\nunder the Convention Against Torture and denying her\nmotion for reconsideration. With the exception of an eleven\nyear interval, from 1978, when Ms. Fiadjoe was seven years\nof age, until her flight from her native Ghana to the United\nStates in March 2000, Ms. Fiadjoe was held as a slave of her\nfather, a priest of the Trokosi sect, who, in accordance with\nthe tenets of the sect, forced his daughter to work for him and\nabused her physically and sexually. Ms. Fiadjoe sought\nasylum and other relief on the ground that if she were\nreturned to Ghana she, as one of the women subject to the\npractices of the Trokosi sect, would likely once again become\nsubject to her father’s bondage and abuse, a consequence that\nGhanian government authorities were unable or unwilling to\nprevent.\n        Both the Immigration Judge (“IJ”) and the BIA found\nthat Ms. Fiadjoe’s testimony was not credible, and the BIA\nfound that Ms. Fiadjoe failed to establish that the government\nof Ghana was either unwilling or unable to control her\nfather’s sexual abuse. We conclude that these findings are not\nsupported by reasonable, substantial and probative evidence\non the record considered as a whole. We will grant the\npetition and remand the case for a new hearing and\ndevelopment of the record before a different IJ.\n\n                 I. Procedural Background\n\n\n                              3\n\f       On March 11, 2000, using a passport bearing the name\nof another person, petitioner, Lorraine Fiadjoe, entered the\nUnited States. She is a member of the Ewe tribe and a native\nand citizen of Ghana. She was detained as an arriving alien\nand interviewed. Upon her refusal to be sent back to Ghana,\nthe immigration authorities transferred her to the York County\n[Pennsylvania] Prison.\n       On March 30 Asylum Officer James L. Reaves\nconducted an Asylum Pre-Screening Interview of Ms.\nFiadjoe, after which he found that she had established a\nsignificant possibility of a claim for asylum based on her\nmembership in a particular social group (unmarried women\nover 25 in Ghana). He also found that Ms. Fiadjoe had\nestablished a credible fear of persecution or torture.\n       On the same day the Immigration and Naturalization\nService (“INS”)1 charged Ms. Fiadjoe with removeability\nunder §§212(a)(6)(C)(i) and 212 (a)(7)(A)(i)(I) of the INA, 8\nU.S.C. §§1182(a)(6)(C)(i), (a)(7)(A)(i)(I) (2003) and issued a\nnotice to appear. At a June 1, 2000 hearing before an IJ Ms.\nFiadjoe conceded that she was removable under\n§212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I) of the INA for being an intending\nimmigrant not in possession of a valid visa or other entry\ndocument.\n       Ms. Fiadjoe filed applications for asylum, withholding\nof removal, and protection under the Convention Against\nTorture, Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture and\nOther Forms of Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or\nPunishment, G.A. Res. 39/46, Annex 39 U.N. GAOR Supp.\nNo. 51, at 197, U.N. Doc. A/39/51 (1984) (“CAT”). The IJ,\nDonald Vincent Ferlise, held an evidentiary hearing on April\n\n\n       1\n           The enforcement functions of the INS have since been\ntransferred to the Department of Homeland Security, pursuant to §441\nof the Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-296, 116 Stat.\n2135 (Nov. 25, 2002).\n\n                                 4\n\f30, 2002, after which he denied Ms. Fiadjoe’s application for\nrelief and ordered her removed to Ghana.\n        Ms. Fiadjoe filed a timely appeal with the BIA. On\nJune 6, 2003 the BIA dismissed the appeal. Ms. Fiadjoe filed\na timely petition for review of the BIA’s decision in this court\nand subsequently filed a motion with the BIA seeking\nreconsideration of the BIA’s June 6 order. On February 18,\n2004 the BIA denied the motion to reconsider. Ms. Fiadjoe\nfiled a petition for review of the BIA’s February 18 decision.\nThat petition has been consolidated with the first petition.\n\n                  II. Petitioner’s Evidence\n\n        Ms. Fiadjoe’s claims for relief stem from her assertion\nthat from age seven until she fled from Ghana, with an eleven\nyear interval from 1978 until 1989, her father held her as a\nslave, subject to physical beatings and frequent rape, pursuant\nto the tenets of the Trokosi religion, of which her father was a\npriest.\n        The nature and existence of the Trokosi practices are\ndescribed in a number of documents that are in the record.\nThe United States Department of State Country Report on\nHuman Rights Practices in Ghana released in February 2001\n(the “State Department Report” or the “Report”) is one\nexample. In a summary statement the Report states,\n“Violence against women is a serious problem. Traditional\npractices, including a localized form of ritual servitude\n(Trokosi) practiced in some rural areas, still result in\nconsiderable abuse and discrimination against women and\nchildren.” The Report further noted that “[v]iolence against\nwomen, including rape and domestic violence, remains a\nsignificant problem. A 1998 study revealed that particularly\nin low-income, high-density sections of greater Accra, at least\n54 percent of women have been assaulted in recent years,”\nand that “[w]omen, especially in rural areas, remain subject to\nburdensome labor conditions and traditional male\n\n                               5\n\fdominance.”\n      The State Department Report described in some detail\nTrokosi practices:\n              Although the Constitution prohibits slavery, it\n              exists on a limited scale. Trokosi, a traditional\n              practice found among the Ewe ethnic group and\n              in part of the Volta Region, is an especially\n              severe human rights abuse and an extremely\n              serious violation of children’s and women’s\n              rights. It is a system in which a young girl,\n              sometimes under the age of 10, is made a slave\n              to a fetish shrine for offenses allegedly\n              committed by a member of the girl’s family. In\n              rare instances, boys are offered. The belief is\n              that, if someone in that family has committed a\n              crime, such as stealing, members of the family\n              may begin to die in large numbers unless a\n              young girl is given to the local fetish shrine to\n              atone for the offense. The girl becomes the\n              property of the fetish priest, must work on the\n              priest’s farm, and perform other labors for him.\n              Because they are the sexual property of the\n              priests, most Trokosi slaves have children by\n              the priests. Although the girls’ families must\n              provide for their needs such as food, most are\n              unable to do so. There are at least 2,200 girls\n              and women bound to various shrines in the\n              Trokosi system, a figure that does not include\n              the slaves’ children. Even when freed by her\n              fetish priest from the more onerous aspects of\n              her bondage, whether voluntarily or as a result\n              of intervention by activists, a Trokosi women\n              generally has few marketable skills and little\n              hope of marriage and typically remains bound to\n              the shrine for life by psychological and social\n              pressure arising from a traditional belief that\n\n                               6\n\f              misfortune may befall a Trokosi woman’s\n              family or village if she abandons her obligations\n              to the shrine. When a fetish slave dies, her\n              family is expected to replace her with another\n              young girl, thus perpetuating the bondage to the\n              fetish shrine from generation to generation.\n\n        In 1998 Ghana’s Parliament passed legislation that,\namong other provisions designed to protect women, banned\nthe practice of “customary servitude” (known as Trokosi).\nAfter passage of this legislation, the Report states, “[t]he\nCHRAJ and International Needs have had some success in\napproaching village authorities and fetish priests at over 316\nof the major and minor shrines, winning the release of 2,800\nTrokosi slaves to date and retraining them for new\nprofessions.” However, as of the time of the report (2000),\n“[t]here are at least 2,200 girls and women bound to various\nshrines in the Trokosi system, a figure that does not include\nthe slaves’ children.”\n        Despite the 1998 legislation, as of the year 2000, “[t]he\nGovernment has not prosecuted any practitioners of Trokosi,\nand in August 1999, a presidential aide criticized anti-Trokosi\nactivists for being insensitive to indigenous cultural and\n‘religious’ practices.” The Statement Department Report\nrecites at great length the terrible abuses committed by\nGhana’s police, noting that “[i]n recent years, the police\nservice in particular has come under severe criticism\nfollowing incidents of police brutality, corruption, and\nnegligence.” With respect to the police and their reaction to\nviolence against women, the Report recites “[v]iolence\nagainst women, including rape and domestic violence,\nremains a significant problem . . . a total of 95 percent of the\nvictims of domestic violence are women, according to data\ngathered by the FIDA. These abuses generally go unreported\nand seldom come before the courts. The police tend not to\nintervene in domestic disputes.”\n\n                                7\n\f        It is against this well-documented background that Ms.\nFiadjoe’s account of her own experiences unfolds. These\nevents are described in her affidavit in support of her asylum\napplication (Form I-589) and in her April 30, 2002 hearing\ntestimony. They are described in the report of the\npsychologist who treated her for the trauma these events\ncaused.\n        Ms. Fiadjoe was born a member of the Ewe tribe on\nMarch 17, 1971 in Accra, Ghana. When she was a young\nchild her parents separated. She was too young at that time to\nremember her parents living together. Her mother remarried\nand remained in Accra. Her father, a farmer, also remarried\nand lived in a village called Veku outside of Anloga, a remote\narea of rural Ghana. Ms. Fiadjoe was sent to live with her\nfather.\n        The father was a Trokosi priest, maintaining a shrine in\nhis home where he and other members of the Trokosi cult\nconducted Trokosi rituals. In 1978 when Ms. Fiadjoe was\nseven years of age, her father, pursuant to Trokosi practices,\nsought to make her his slave, working for him and the shrine\nand submitting to him sexually. During an approximately\nthree months period the father sexually abused Ms. Fiadjoe as\npart of the Trokosi tenets. Fortunately for Ms. Fiadjoe, her\nfather’s sister, Aunt Dela, objected to this abuse and took Ms.\nFiadjoe to live with her family in Accra. There Ms. Fiadjoe\nno longer saw her father and was able to attend school and\nlive the life of an independent young woman. She was a\nChristian, of the Baptist persuasion.\n        Sadly, in 1989 Aunt Dela was killed in an automobile\naccident. Her husband remarried and directed Ms. Fiadjoe to\nleave his house. She had nowhere else to go except to return\nto her father in Veku. There she once again became her\nfather’s slave subject to beatings and rape. Approximately a\nyear after her return she described to her grandmother the\ntorments to which she was being subjected. The grandmother\nreported the beatings to the police but did not mention the\n\n                               8\n\frapes because of the disgrace that such a revelation would\nbring upon the family. The police refused to intervene on the\nground that only a domestic dispute was involved.\n        Ms. Fiadjoe attempted to escape from these conditions.\nShe went to work selling fish in order to accumulate some\nmoney. When she had saved enough she moved out of her\nfather’s house and rented a room of her own. However, after\nreturning to her room one evening her landlord returned her\nrent and told her she could not stay. He had been threatened\nby her father. Ms. Fiadjoe sought to escape through marriage\nand dated two men of her village, first Titi and then Agol,\neach of whom wanted to marry her. Her father would not\nallow a marriage and scared off each of these men.\n        In 1996 Ms. Fiadjoe met a Muslim man, Ahmed\nKublano who lived with his parents in Anloga. His brother\nRasheed lived nearby. Ms. Fiadjoe and Ahmed fell in love\nand wanted to marry. In order to persuade the father to\nconsent Ahmed brought him gifts, but he could not bring his\nfamily because they were Muslims and opposed the marriage.\nMs. Fiadjoe had informed Ahmed about the beatings but had\nnot told him that her father periodically raped her. Ahmed\npersuaded her to leave her home and go with him to stay with\nhis cousin in Nigeria.\n        The two fled to Nigeria and stayed with the cousin.\nThey stayed there a week, but the cousin started to approach\nMs. Fiadjoe sexually and they had to leave. Having no money\nit was necessary that they return to Ghana. Ms. Fiadjoe had\nno place to go other than her father’s house. As she explained\nat her asylum hearing, she had to go back “because we [she\nand Ahmed] are not married and in Ghana before you can be\nfree from your father, your father have to accept your\nmarriage.”\n        The father resumed beating Ms. Fiadjoe and poured\nboiling water over her because she had disobeyed him. The\nsexual abuse continued. She and Ahmed continued to see\neach other and still wanted to marry. It was a star-crossed\n\n                              9\n\frelationship. As Ms. Fiadjoe stated in her affidavit: “My\nfather hated Ahmed because he did not want me to be with\nanyone but him, and because Ahmed was a Muslim. My\nfather was opposed to the marriage and he said that I can’t\nmarry Ahmed because I am a Christian. Ahmed’s family did\nnot approve of me and did not want us to marry because I am\na Christian.”\n        Ms. Fiadjoe became pregnant by Ahmed and hoped\nthat this would persuade her father to agree to her marriage.\nWhen she told her father of her pregnancy he beat her until\nshe miscarried. Ahmed continued to visit Ms. Fiadjoe. He\ndid so on March 5, 2000, waiting in her bedroom before they\nwent out together. Ms. Fiadjoe testified that at that point “I\nwent to the shower to take a bath and then, when I came back,\nwhen I was coming out, I saw my father coming out of my\nroom, but I knew Ahmed was in the room, so when I went\nthere Ahmed was lying in blood . . . I hold [his] hand and he\ndidn’t talk to me, he was just lying in the blood and he didn’t\ndo anything, so to me I was thinking he’s dead.”\n        Ms. Fiadjoe started shouting and her father told her\nthat if she didn’t shut up he would kill her. She took the\nmoney she had saved and left the house. She proceeded to\nAhmed’s brother, Rasheed, to tell him what had happened.\nShe then went to the roadside and took a car to Accra. There\nshe went to her mother’s house and told her what had\nhappened. The mother did not want Ms. Fiadjoe to stay with\nher because she knew the father was dangerous. Ms. Fiadjoe\nthen sought refuge with her Aunt Dela’s husband, who did not\neven want her to sit down, or enter the house because he was\nafraid of the father.\n        Next Ms. Fiadjoe went to a person she had known for\nmany years named Alfred who, for fear that the father would\nsuspect that Ms. Fiadjoe was with him, took her to his\ngirlfriend’s house. As Ms. Fiadjoe testified: “When he took\nme to his girlfriend’s house, he told me you can’t stay here\nwith this problem, you can’t stay here, so, he took me to town,\n\n                              10\n\ftook passport size picture and then he gave me some clothes, I\nstayed there for about five days, I stayed with them for about\nfive days, he gave me passport to just leave . . . The passport\nhe gave to me, I’m going to Canada, if I go to Canada, I will\nmeet somebody at the airport, they will be holding my name.”\n        Ms. Fiadjoe gave five hundred thousand Ghanian cedis\nto Alfred and received from him $130 U.S. dollars and the\npassport which bore her photograph and the name Mercy\nAppiah-Kubi. Alfred drove her to the airport on March 10,\n2000. She flew to JFK Airport in New York City, arriving on\nMarch 11. There she was taken into custody by INS officials.\n        INS officials questioned Ms. Fiadjoe that day and\ncompleted a handwritten Record of Sworn Statement in\nProceeding under Section 235(b)(1) of the Act. Her answers\nmade very little sense. In response to the question “Why did\nyou leave your home country or country of last residence?”,\nshe responded, “I want to look after my mother.” In response\nto the question “Do you have any fear or concern about being\nreturned to your home country or being removed from the\nUnited States?” she replied, “Yes. I cannot look after my\nsisters and brothers.” In response to the question “Would you\nbe harmed if you are returned to your home country or\ncountry of last residence?”, she responded “Yes . . . I can’t\nstand the responsibilities.”\n        After the INS transferred Ms. Fiadjoe to York County\nPrison, Officer Reaves administered an Asylum Pre-Screening\nInterview on March 30. Contrary to the facts as she later\nrecounted them, Ms. Fiadjoe informed Officer Reaves that her\nfather’s beatings began three years ago, that her father tried to\nhave sex with her but that she never allowed it.\n        In due course Ms. Fiadjoe was released from detention\nand took up residence at International Friendship House. She\nhad great difficulty adjusting to her environment and\nneighborhood. Her then attorney referred her to Kathleen M.\nJansen, M.S., C.T.S., a psychologist and adult therapist\nassociated with the Victim Assistance Center of York,\n\n                               11\n\fPennsylvania, who first saw Ms. Fiadjoe on May 5, 2000. At\nthe outset Ms. Jansen found that Ms. Fiadjoe was withdrawn\nand highly anxious, made almost no eye contact, kept her\nhead down, spoke very softly and frequently dissociated 2 .\n        Ms. Jansen’s recital of the events of Ms. Fiadjoe’s\nprior life coincided virtually identically with events as later\ndescribed in Ms. Fiadjoe’s asylum affidavit, which she\nexecuted on July 5, 2001, and her April 2, 2002 testimony. In\nthree respects Ms. Jansen’s report became a basis of the IJ’s\nand the BIA’s credibility determinations. First, it is apparent\nthat she had no understanding of the Trokosi sect and its\nrelationship to the torments to which Ms. Fiadjoe was\nsubjected. In this regard Ms. Jansen wrote, “Ms. Fiadjoe\ndescribes her father as having a religious ‘fetish’ which I have\ncome to believe refers to what we would call an addiction.”\nSecond, referring to Ahmed, Ms. Jansen wrote, “[h]e was\naware of the sexual assaults by her father, but was powerless\nto stop them.” Third, she described the death of Ahmed as if\nhe had been shot, writing: “On the night before she left her\nfather’s home for the last time, she reports being in the\n‘shower room’ when she heard noises. When she emerged,\nshe found her boyfriend lying shot on the floor. He was still\nalive when she reached him, and died in her arms.” (emphasis\nadded).\n        Ms. Jansen described Ms. Fiadjoe’s emotional status:\n               Work with Ms. Fiadjoe has been complicated by\n               the long history of multiple traumas and the\n               underlying fear of being returned home. As\n\n        2\n          In psychology “dissociation” is “a defense mechanism in\nwhich a group of mental processes are segregated from the rest of a\nperson’s mental activity in order to avoid emotional distress, as in the\ndissociative disorder (q.v.), or in which an idea or object is segregated\nfrom its emotional significance, in the first sense it is roughly\nequivalent to splitting, in the second, to isolation.” Borland’s Medical\nDictionary, 27th Edition (1988).\n\n                                   12\n\f              with many incest survivors, she has learned to\n              endure trauma by dissociating, emotionally\n              removing herself from her surroundings until\n              the pain has subsided.\n\n                               …\n\n              Each time I met with Ms. Fiadjoe, I see\n              dramatic improvements. She has established\n              eating and sleeping habits that are within\n              normal limits. Her communication abilities\n              have improved, although she continues to\n              occasionally dissociate when discussing\n              emotionally painful events. She is able to\n              maintain reasonable eye contact and has a\n              significantly greater range of affect. She is able\n              to discuss many more difficult subjects without\n              dissociating or breaking down. She remains\n              extremely fearful of her father finding out\n              where she is and of being sent back to Ghana\n              and forced to return to his home.\n\n       Ms. Jansen’s report thus described Ms. Fiadjoe’s\n\nsomewhat fragile emotional state as she proceeded towards\n\nher asylum hearing continuing “to occasionally dissociate\n\nwhen discussing emotionally painful events.”\n\n   III. April 30, 2002 Hearing and Initial Oral Decision\n\n       Ms. Fiadjoe’s asylum hearing on April 30, 2002 posed\n\na challenge to her ability to discuss the difficult subjects of\n\n\n                                13\n\frape and incest without dissociating or breaking down. Her\n\nattorney, Mr. Piver, commenced by questioning her about her\n\nearly years, her religion, Trokosi practices and the start of her\n\nfather’s sexual abuse when she was seven.\n\n       While Ms. Fiadjoe testified about the initial sexual\n\nabuse at age seven, the cessation of the abuse while she was\n\nin Accra with her Aunt Dela and its resumption eleven years\n\nlater, the IJ, Donald V. Ferlise, appeared unable to\n\ncomprehend this sequence of events and the following\n\ninterchange between him and the witness took place:\n\n              Q:      Well, how long, how long did this go on,\n                      that you were being raped and beaten?\n\nJUDGE TO MR. PYVER (sic)\n\n              Q:      What?\n\n              A:      We’re getting to that?\n\n              Q:      Well, I’m getting to it now.\n\nJUDGE TO MS. FIADJOE\n\n              Q:      How did this go on?\n\n              A:      It, when I left to Accra it stopped, but\n\n                               14\n\f     when I came back to my father again\n     then, at the age of 18 it continued from\n     there.\n\nQ:   All right, (indiscernible) at age seven, did\n     your father beat or rape you at age\n     seven?\n\nA:   Yes.\n\nQ:   For how long of period of time did that\n\n     go on?\n\nA:   For, til I was seven, I know my father\n\n     was raping me.\n\nQ:   Ma’am, you’re not making any - -\n\nA:   - - For it went - -\n\nQ:   - - Ma’am, you, you can cry, that’s fine,\n     but your not making any sense, and the\n     tears do not do away with the fact that\n     your not making any sense to me. Now,\n     rather than crying, just answer the\n     question. You said, your father raped\n     you at age seven and he would beat you,\n     correct?\n\nA:   Yes, but I didn’t tell anybody.\n\nQ:   I don’t care if you did or not. At age\n     seven, how long did this go on that he\n     was raping you and beating you?\n\n               15\n\f              A:     In fact, he was doing that to me when I\n                     cried to my auntie, I want to - -\n\n              Q:     - - Ma’am, I don’t like it when someone\n                     beats around the bush, okay, when they\n                     don’t answer me. Another thing I don’t\n                     like is when somebody makes sounds as\n                     if their crying and their eyes stay dry, all\n                     right. It’s a form of histrionics, stage\n                     (indiscernible), I don’t like that. I want\n                     straight answers and I want straight\n                     answers right now. You said, your father\n                     beat you and raped you at age seven, how\n                     long did that go on while you were age\n                     seven?\n\n              A:     In fact, it went until age seven and I left.\n\n        Although it had been established that Ms. Fiadjoe had\nbeen born in 1971, that her father’s sexual molestation began\nwhen she was seven in 1978, that she left for Aunt Dela’s\nhome that year and returned to her father eleven years later\nwhen Aunt Dela died, the IJ hounded Ms. Fiadjoe because\nafter the IJ’s previous brow beating she could not testify as to\nthe year when she returned to her father. This exchange\nensued:\nMR. PYVER (sic) TO MS FIADJOE\n                Q:    Okay, did you, when you went back to\n                      live with your father, had you, did, strike\n                      that - -, when you went back to live with\n                      your father, how was your treatment at\n                      that time?\n\n              A.     He tried to beat me and rape me again.\n\n              Q:     Okay, how long did that start after you\n\n                               16\n\f                returned to his home?\n\n           A:   After a year.\n\n           Q:   After a year.\n\nJUDGE TO MS. FIADJOE\n\n           Q:   All right, when did you return to your\n                father, what year?\n\n           A:   (No audible response).\n           Q:   Madam, please answer my question?\n\n           A:   I don’t remember the year, but I knew I\n                was 18 years, I don’t remember the year.\n\n           Q:   You don’t know what year it occurred\n                in?\n\nMR. PYVER (sic) TO MS. FIADJOE\n\n           Q:   No, how, what year were you in - -\n\n           A:   - - Wait a minute, please\n\nJUDGE TO MS. FIADJOE\n\n           Q:   Do you know what year it, it occurred in?\n\n           A:   (Indiscernible).\n\n           Q:   You know the question, please don’t do\n                this, don’t beat around the bush, it’s\n                aggravating, you know the question,\n                what year did you return to your father?\n\n                         17\n\f              A:     (No audible response).\n\nJUDGE FOR THE RECORD\n\n       All right, I find the respondent is non responsive to the\nquestion.\n\n       The IJ challenged Ms. Fiadjoe’s testimony that her\n\nfather maintained a room in his house which contained idols:\n\nJUDGE TO MS. FIADJOE\n\n              Q:     Did you ever go into the room?\n\n              A:     No.\n\n              Q:     How do you know what was inside the\n                     room if you were never in there?\n\n\n              A:     Because I go there once a month.\n\n              Q:     Well, how do you know - -\n\n              A:     - - To perform, in there performing, I see\n                     them performing rituals.\n\n              Q:     Were you in the room or not?\n\n              A:     No.\n\n              Q:     Well then how did you know what was in\n                     the room if you were never in there?\n\n              A:     There’s (indiscernible), I don’t know, I\n\n                               18\n\f                     know there is idols.\n\n              Q:     How do you know that if you never went\n                     in?\n\n              A:     Because they have some of them outside,\n                     outside, they have some of them outside.\n\n              Q:     How can you tell me what’s in the room\n                     if you were never there, explain that to\n                     me?\n\n              A:     I’m not allowed there because, I’m not\n                     part of them and I see some of the idols\n                     inside and outside the room, so that it is\n                     why I’m saying their idols. And they\n                     (indiscernible) in there particular days\n                     and they (indiscernible), they go there to\n                     perform rituals.\n\n              Q:     So, it’s because there’s idols outside the\n                     room, you think there’s idols inside the\n                     room, although you’ve never seen them?\n\n              A:     Yes, because they prepare food and a lot\n                     of them outside, they take into the room.\n\n       The IJ pursued with extreme insensitivity a subject that\n\nmust have been particularly painful to Ms. Fiadjoe - the\n\nmurder of Ahmed:\n\nJUDGE TO MS. FIADJOE:\n\n              Q:     You told me, that you never told Ahmed,\n\n                              19\n\f     that your father had sexually assaulted\n     you, but apparently, you told Ms. Jansen,\n     that you told Ahmed about the sexual\n     assaults, why is that?\n\nA:   In fact, I told, Ms. Jansen, that I let\n     Ahmed know that abuse, but I didn’t\n     clarify it today.\nQ:   Well, she’s stating here, that Ahmed was\n     aware of the sexual assaults by your\n     father, that’s pretty clear to me.\n\nA:   But, I did not tell her about the assault,\n     the beatings and all, I didn’t clarify it to,\n     Ms. Jansen.\n\nQ:   Well, is she, she a fortune teller, she can\n     read your mind without you telling her,\n     it’s clear here, she says that Ahmed was\n     aware of the sexual assaults by your\n     father, so, you must have told her. That’s\n     not what you told me today though, why\n     is that, why is there a difference between\n     what, Ms. Jansen, writes in her letter and\n     what you’ve told me?\n\nA:   Because, Ms. Jansen, is the one who let\n     me know it’s okay to tell, but I did not\n     explain that, I did not tell this part and\n     this part, I just say, abuse and say\n     (indiscernible), I did explain, clarify that\n     to her, but she let me know that it’s okay\n     to tell somebody so that you can, I can\n     feel okay, I can be healed (indiscernible).\n\nQ:   Yes, but your double talking me, it says\n\n               20\n\f                    that, just answer my question, the letter\n                    from Ms. Jansen says, that Ahmed knew\n                    about the sexual assaults by your father,\n                    you told me that Ahmed did not know, so\n                    tell me why Ms. Jansen’s telling me one\n                    thing, and why you’re telling me\n                    something else?\n\n             A:     (No audible response).\n\n             Q:     I’m waiting for your answer.\n\n             A:     Please, I don’t know, I don’t have answer\n                    for that.\n\n        The concluding portions of the hearing further\ndemonstrated the IJ’s continuing hostility towards the\nobviously distraught Ms. Fiadjoe and his abusive treatment of\nher throughout the hearing. He had succeeded in returning\nher to the condition which Ms. Jansen had enabled her to\novercome after repeated therapy sessions, breaking down and\ndissociating. As reflected in the transcript:\nJUDGE FOR THE RECORD\n        All right, let me go off the record and we’l (sic)\ndecision.\n                       (OFF THE RECORD)\n                        (ON THE RECORD)\n             JUDGE RENDERS ORAL DECISION\nJUDGE TO MS. FIADJOE\n               Q:       Ms. Fiadjoe, you’ve heard my decision,\n                        you’ve heard what I’ve just said?\n\n             A:     (No audible response).\n\n             Q:     Oh, you were sleeping there, you fell\n                    asleep didn’t you?\n\n                              21\n\f          A:     (No audible response).\n          Q:     You fell asleep during my decision?\n          A:     No, I’m feeling headache.\n          Q:     Did you hear what I said or were you\n                 asleep?\n          A:     I wasn’t asleep.\n          Q:     Did you hear what I said?\n          A:     I thought that you (indiscernible), so I\n          didn’t.\n          Q:      Okay, all right, well, what I said was,\n                  that first of all, I don’t believe your\n                  testimony, I think that you were making\n                  up your testimony as you were going\n                  along. Your testimony is contradicted\n                  by, much of it is contradicted by your\n                  own witness, Ms. Jansen, her, her the\n                  letter that she wrote, your testimony\n                  generally doesn’t make any sense. I\n                  further found, and I denied it, basically\n                  because of that, I further found that if I\n                  had found that you were credible, that\n                  you were telling me the truth, I do not\n                  find that - -\n\n                (OFF THE RECORD)\n                 (ON THE RECORD)\n\nJUDGE TO MS. FIADJOE\n\n          Q:     I don’t find that you have been\n                 persecuted and on one of the five\n                 statutory grounds. I don’t find, first of\n                 all, there are relatively few women\n                 involved in this movement, all right,\n                 sexual slaves. They number by 2,200,\n                 now you described it as, as a sexual\n\n                           22\n\f                     slave, I read from the State Department it\n                     seems there’s, there’s some sexual\n                     slavery involved with it, but it has a lot to\n                     do with idiolatry and voodoo and fears\n                     and just a lot of nonsense. I don’t find\n                     that a group of 2,200 plus or minus\n                     women would be particular social group,\n                     it’s small group and it’s only in a certain\n                     section of, of Ghana, around the\n                     (indiscernible) region. Even if I found\n                     that it was a particular social group, the\n                     government is not persecuting anyone,\n                     all right, and the government is not\n                     allowing this to continue, they passed a\n                     law in 1998 and they had, there trying to\n                     abolish Trokosi and apparently according\n                     to the State Department, they think that it\n                     will be abolished in the, in the near\n                     future. So, even if it were a particular\n                     social group, that’s these women, a small\n                     group of women, I don’t find that they’ve\n                     been persecuted pursuant to definition of\n                     persecution. And for that reason, I’ve\n                     denied your application, do you\n                     understand, now?\n\n              A:     Yes.\n\n              Q:     Okay, the answer is yes.\n\n              IV. The Sanitized Oral Decision\n\n       On the hearing date the IJ also delivered a sanitized\n\nversion of his original crude (and cruel) Oral Decision. It will\n\n\n                               23\n\fbe referred to as the “IJ Decision”.\n\n        Having found that Ms. Fiadjoe was “inadmissible for\n\npresenting a bogus passport to the Immigration authorities”\n\nand also under Section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) (fraud on an\n\nimmigration official), the IJ set forth general legal principles\n\napplicable to applications for asylum and for restriction on\n\nremoval.\n\n        Turning to the circumstances about which Ms. Fiadjoe\n\ntestified, the IJ rejected the evidence that Trokosi was a form\n\nof religion, finding that “it does not appear to the Court that\n\nthis is a religion, it is rather a cult.”\n\n        The bulk of the opinion was devoted to the reasons\n\nwhy the IJ found Ms. Fiadjoe totally incredible. As he stated\n\nin his original oral decision “I don’t believe your testimony. I\n\nthink that you were making up your testimony as you went\n\nalong.” The first reason for this finding was Ms. Fiadjoe’s\n\ninability to specify the year in which she returned to her father\n\nafter spending eleven years with Aunt Dela. The IJ wrote:\n\n\n                                   24\n\f             The respondent was asked when she returned to\n             her father and she was unable to tell the Court\n             when it occurred. If indeed this had transpired\n             in the respondent’s life and if indeed she was\n             living safely with her aunt for 11 years, it is\n             abundantly clear to the court that the respondent\n             would be able to tell me when she returned\n             home to that situation that she feared so much.\n\n        The second reason that the IJ gave for rejecting Ms.\nFiadjoe’s testimony was the inconsistency he perceived\nbetween her testimony that she had never been in the room in\nwhich her father and other participants performed rituals and\nher testimony that there were idols in that room:\n\n             The respondent’s father told her that he wanted\n             her to be a Trokosi slave, she stated that the\n             father had a room inside his house in which she\n             was not permitted to enter, in which there were\n             idols. The Court asked the respondent if she\n             had never entered that room, how she knew\n             there was idols inside; and her answer was that\n             she presumed they were idols inside the room\n             that she had never entered since they were idols\n             outside the room. This line of thought on the\n             respondent’s part is not particularly persuasive.\n\n        The IJ found reason to doubt Ms. Fiadjoe’s testimony\nin the fact that she returned to her father’s house after\nreturning with Ahmed from Nigeria:\n\n             Ahmed and the respondent in April of 1997,\n             traveled to Nigeria by bus to live with Ahmed’s\n             cousin. The cousin of Ahmed apparently made\n             sexual advances to the respondent, so that after\n             three weeks, she and Ahmed returned to Ghana\n\n                             25\n\f              and the respondent returned to her father’s\n              home. The respondent was asked why, if she\n              had been beaten and raped at her father’s home,\n              did she return there. She states that she returned\n              there since she did not want her father to be\n              angered by the fact that she was with Ahmed.\n              This absolutely is totally implausible and totally\n              nonsensical to the Court, insofar as the\n              respondent was returning to a situation where\n              she knew she was going to be raped and beaten.\n              And I don’t believe that she would have any\n              fear that her father would be angered and if she\n              did have a fear, that fear would be a lesser fear\n              than the rape and the beatings that she knew\n              awaited her. As it turned out, when the\n              respondent did return, her father not only beat\n              her but poured hot water on her as a form of\n              punishment.\n\n       The IJ relied upon perceived inconsistencies between\nMs. Fiadjoe’s testimony and her statements to Ms. Jansen as\nreflected in Ms. Jansen’s report. He found that Ms. Jansen’s\nreport cast doubt upon Ms. Fiadjoe’s testimony that her\nabusive father was part of the Trokosi sect or that she was a\nTrokosi slave:\n              The respondent submitted to the Court a\n              letter/report from Social Worker Kathleen\n              Jansen, which is found at Exhibit 6, tab 2. A\n              careful examination of Ms. Jansen’s letter\n              reflects nothing to the effect that the\n              respondent’s father was a member of the\n              Trokosi cult, nor that the respondent herself was\n              a Trokosi slave. The respondent was not able to\n              explain why what she told the Court, was not\n              told to the social worker.\n\n\n                              26\n\f        The IJ found that Ms. Fiadjoe’s testimony that she only\ntold her grandmother about her father’s sexual abuse is\ncontradicted by Ms. Jansen’s report which recites that Ms.\nFiadjoe also told her mother about the sexual abuse. The IJ\nfound contradiction of Ms. Fiadjoe’s testimony that she never\ntold Ahmed about the sexual nature of her father’s abuse in\nthe statement in Ms. Jansen’s letter that Ahmed “was aware of\nthe sexual assaults by her father, but was powerless to stop\nthem.” Further, the IJ notes an inconsistency between Ms.\nFiadjoe’s statement that she does not know how her father\nkilled Ahmed and the statement in Ms. Jansen’s report that\n“[w]hen she emerged [from the shower], she found her\nboyfriend lying shot on the floor.”\n        The IJ also based his credibility evaluation on\nstatements that Ms. Fiadjoe made to immigration officials\nwhen she was initially processed after her detention. At the\nairport she did not disclose her reason for fleeing Ghana and\n“told the Immigration Officer a rather benign reason for\ncoming here, the fact that she was not able to financially\nprovide for her siblings.” The IJ referred to the asylum pre-\nscreening interview document:\n               That document reflects on page 4, that the\n               respondent told the Immigration Officer that her\n               father started beating her three years ago. That\n               is three years ago prior to March 30 th of 2000,\n               consequently that would be March of 1997;\n               however, the respondent told the Court that she\n               was 7 years of age when the beatings began.\n               Thus, again we have a diametric difference\n               between what the respondent told this Court and\n               what the respondent told the Immigration\n               Officer during the asylum pre-screening\n               interview.\n\n              Even more interesting is the fact that, again\n              according to this interview, the respondent told\n\n                              27\n\f              the Immigration Officer that her father never\n              had sex with her. This totally undermines the\n              entire case in chief, since her entire case in chief\n              is based on her father using her as a sex slave.\n              Whenever the Court sees such a diametric\n              difference between the testimony that the\n              respondent has given to the Court and the\n              testimony that the respondent has given another\n              member of the Immigration Service, the\n              credibility of the respondent and the case in\n              chief gravely suffer.\n\n       The IJ emphasized that “[t]he credibility of the\nrespondent is of extreme importance in assessing the\nrespondent’s claim . . .. The Court concludes that the\nrespondent is making up her testimony as she is going along,\nshe’s making up these scenarios and she is fabricating her\ntestimony to the Court. . . . the Court again states for the\nrecord that this was a frivolous application and that the\nrespondent intentionally lied to this Court.”\n       The IJ provided alternative grounds for denying Ms.\nFiadjoe’s applications for relief. He quoted the State\nDepartment Report describing the Trokosi cult, including the\npractice of its priests of maintaining sex slaves at Trokosi\nshrines. The IJ then held:\n               The Court finds that being a Trokosi slave or a\n               member of the cult, is being a member of a\n               relatively small group. According to the State\n               Department, it numbers approximately 2,200\n               people in a small area, in the southeast portion\n               of Ghana. The Court will not find that a\n               Trokosi slave constitutes a particular social\n               group, insofar as it is rather a minuscule part of\n               the general population of Ghana.\n\n       Had he found Trokosi slaves to be a particular social\n\n                               28\n\fgroup, the IJ held that he “would not find that the respondent\nis being persecuted as being a member of that social group\nand does not qualify for asylum, insofar as I find that this\npractice is being stamped out by the government, according to\nthe State Department reports; and that it can be eradicated by\nthe government within a short period of time, with the\npassage of a law which occurred in 1998.”\n        A rather confusing observation followed in support of\nthe IJ’s finding that Ms. Fiadjoe had not established a well-\nfounded fear of persecution. The IJ appeared to believe that\nMs. Fiadjoe was alleging that she was being persecuted\nbecause she was a member of the Trokosi sect, when in fact\nshe was asserting that with the acquiescence of governmental\nofficials, the Trokosi sect was persecuting her, forcing her\ninto practices totally contrary to her Christian faith. The IJ\nobserved:\n               The government does not condone this slavery.\n               It is perpetuated by a rather small number of\n               people following an ideology, some type of\n               voodoo religion or voodoo following, and the\n               Court does not find that it constitutes a\n               persecution of this group of women, even if\n               these women should be classified as a particular\n               social group. The Court considers the Trokosi\n               as an isolated aberration of the small segment of\n               the society in Ghana, but I do not find that it is a\n               ground for asylum. I do not find that members\n               of that group are being persecuted for one of the\n               five statutory grounds for a grant of such relief.\n\n              Consequently, for all of these reasons, the Court\n              finds that the respondent has not established\n              well-founded fear of persecution as defined, if\n              she were returned to Ghana. Accordingly her\n              application for asylum will be denied.\n\n\n                                29\n\f       Based on the foregoing, the IJ determined i) it was\nunnecessary to consider whether Ms. Fiadjoe merited relief as\na matter of discretion; ii) because Ms. Fiadjoe failed to\nestablish eligibility for asylum, she failed to meet the higher\nstandard of proof necessary for restriction on removal to\nGhana; and iii) Ms. Fiadjoe does not qualify for relief under\nthe CAT because she did not establish that she is more likely\nthan not to be tortured if she returns to Ghana.\n       The IJ entered orders denying Ms. Fiadjoe’s request\nfor asylum, for restriction on removal to Ghana and for\nwithholding removal under the CAT. He ordered that she be\nremoved from the United States to Ghana.\n\n               V. Proceeding before the BIA\n\n        On appeal from the IJ’s decision the BIA relied heavily\nupon the IJ’s credibility determination: “In denying the\nrespondent’s applications for relief, the Immigration Judge\nfound that the respondent was not credible (IJ at 11-12). We\nagree.” The BIA advanced two grounds for its credibility\ndetermination - i) perceived inconsistences in her testimony at\nthe hearing before the IJ and ii) inconsistencies in her\nstatement at her Asylum Pre-Screening Interview.\n        With respect to Ms. Fiadjoe’s testimony, the BIA noted\nthat Ms. Fiadjoe made conflicting claims as to the age when\nher Trokosi ritual sexual abuse by her father began, referring\nto the following inconsistencies or supposed inconsistencies:\ni) in her asylum application and during her testimony Ms.\nFiadjoe claimed that her father began to abuse her sexually\nand attempted to rape her when she was seven years old; ii) in\nfurther testimony she asserted that her father had in fact raped\nher when she was seven; iii) in her statement given at her\nAsylum Pre-Screening Interview she stated that the abuse\nbegan approximately three years prior to her March 2000\ninterviews and claimed that she did not allow her father to\nhave sex with her, in contrast to later claims of on-going rape.\n\n                              30\n\fThe BIA concluded that “[b]ecause we have found that the\nrespondent’s testimony cannot be accepted as credible, it\nfollows that the respondent has failed to satisfy her burden of\nproof and persuasion.”\n        Further, the BIA held that Ms. Fiadjoe’s claims must\nbe denied for failure to establish that the government of\nGhana was either unwilling or unable to control her father’s\nritual abuse. In support of this conclusion the BIA noted i)\nMs. Fiadjoe did not seek help of the Ghanian authorities; ii)\nthe grandmother when reporting the father’s abuse to the\npolice did not mention the sexual aspect of the abuse; iii) the\ngovernment outlawed Trokosi practices and ritual bondage in\n1998 and a non-governmental organization had success in\nliberating, counseling, and rehabilitating past victims of such\nbondage.\n        The BIA found that Ms. Fiadjoe implicitly admitted\nthat she could escape her father’s abuse by moving to an\nurban area, citing as support; i) Ms. Fiadjoe’s escape when\nshe fled to Nigeria; ii) her move into an apartment; and iii) her\nunconvincing testimony about being impelled to return to the\nfather’s home after the abortive flight to Nigeria. The BIA\nconcluded “the respondent’s failure to pursue internal\nrelocation would likely be a negative discretionary factor even\nif we had found that she had suffered past persecution on\naccount of a protected ground.”\n        Because the BIA had found that Ms. Fiadjoe had not\ntestified credibly and that she had failed to demonstrate that\nthe government of Ghana would be unwilling or unable to\nprotect her, it did not reach the issue of whether bondage as a\nTrokosi slave would meet the definition of persecution on\naccount of membership in a particular social group or the\nissue whether Ms. Fiadjoe, even if credible, had established\nthat she was, in fact, a Trokosi slave.\n        Finding that Ms. Fiadjoe had failed to establish the\nlower burden of proof required for asylum, the BIA held that\nshe had failed to meet the higher standard for withholding of\n\n                               31\n\fremoval and that she had failed to establish that it was more\nlikely than not that she would be tortured upon her return to\nGhana, thus requiring that her request for relief under the\nCAT be denied.\n        With one member, Juan P. Osuna, dissenting, the BIA\ndismissed the appeal on June 6, 2003. Ms. Fiadjoe filed in\nthis court a timely petition for review of the BIA’s decision.\nMs. Fiadjoe also moved for reconsideration of the BIA’s\ndecision. One of the grounds for the motion to reconsider\nwas the failure of the BIA to consider certain evidence which\nwas not before the IJ but which Ms. Fiadjoe submitted in\nsupport of her appeal. In particular she submitted an October\n31, 2002 letter of Ms. Jansen which explained why certain of\nthe statements made in her earlier letter on which the IJ relied\nto find that Ms. Fiadjoe lacked credibility constituted Ms.\nJansen’s mistakes or misunderstanding. Ms. Jansen’s October\n31, 2002 letter also spelled out in considerable detail the\nnature and consequence of the stress from which Ms. Fiadjoe\nsuffered from her father’s abuse and the effect this stress had\nwith respect to Ms. Fiadjoe’s responses to questions\nconcerning sexual abuse matters. The following are a few of\nMs. Jansen’s observations concerning Ms. Fiadjoe’s\nemotional state:\n               It is my professional opinion that Posttraumatic\n               Stress Disorder, Ms. Fiadjoe’s own mannerisms,\n               and the Immigration Judge’s lack of awareness\n               of Ghanian culture contributed to Ms. Fiadjoe’s\n               responses to questioning by opposing counsel\n               and, in particular, to the Judge. It is\n               extraordinarily difficult for sexual abuse victims\n               to discuss specifics of their abuse experiences.\n               Given the extreme shame that surrounds these\n               issues in general they are difficult for both men\n               and women to discuss. With the addition of the\n               cultural factors surrounding Ms. Fiadjoe’s\n               experiences in particular, it should be of no\n\n                               32\n\fsurprise at all that she would be reluctant to\ndiscuss these issues with anyone, most\nspecifically with a male or in the presence of\nseveral males. It is very typical of victims of\nsexual abuse to not be able to accurately recall\ndates, ages, number of abuse occurrences and\ntime lines in general. In addition, I believe\ncultural factors played a role. In many cultures\nthe specifics of dates, time, and ages are not\nvalued as significantly as they are in western,\nindustrialized cultures. The combination of\ncultural factors and traumatic stress reactions\nwould be expected to impede one’s memory of\ndates, times and ages.\n\n                …\n\nI believe I also communicated in my initial letter\nthat because of her history of severe abuse,\nunder situations of duress she tends to\ndissociate. This means that if she feels\nthreatened or endangered - physically or\nemotionally - she will withdraw from the\nsituation, become confused, frightened, hesitant,\nand may appear to have a blank look on her\nface. This is a natural consequence of the\nPosttraumatic Stress Disorder from which she\nsuffers.\n\n                …\n\nThe Immigration Judge believed that Ms.\nFiadjoe was fabricating her account of rape by\nher father because he found inconsistencies.\nThese inconsistencies are not evidence of\n\n\n                33\n\fdishonesty in Ms. Fiadjoe’s case - they are\nevidence of severe Posttraumatic Stress\nDisorder. It is also noteworthy that at the time\nof this hearing, Ms. Fiadjoe was approximately\nseven months postpartum and, by history,\nsuffered a significant bout of Postpartum\nDepression for approximately nine months after\nthe birth of her daughter. This condition would,\nas well, affect both her memory and her\ncommunication style. Similarly it does not at all\nsurprise me that upon initial questioning by INS\nagents Ms. Fiadjoe would reference her father\nattempting sexual abuse but deny that he had\nhad intercourse with her. Fear and shame\nwould more than explain that circumstance.\nPlease note that she did disclose the sexual\nassaults to her grandmother who immediately\ntold her it was shameful for her to discuss those\nmatters. Although the grandmother was willing\nto report the physical abuse to the police, she\nrefused to report or permit Ms. Fiadjoe to report\nthe sexual violence. I can vehemently affirm\nthat once a sense of safety and a tentative\nworking relationship was established with Ms.\nFiadjoe she consistently and clearly disclosed\nmultiple incidents of violent rape by her father\nduring our counseling sessions. It is also\nimportant to note that Ms. Fiadjoe’s recounting\nof her experiences in her father’s custody never\nwavered during our work together. As an\nexpert in assessing traumatic stress, and an\nexperienced provider of services to victims of\nsexual violence I never saw any indication that\nMs. Fiadjoe was less than truthful with me or\nthat she was fabricating any of her experiences.\n\n\n                34\n\f       In addition to describing Ms. Fiadjoe’s emotional state,\nMs. Jansen took responsibility for creating what appeared to\nbe inconsistencies between statements contained in her\noriginal letter, which was in evidence before the IJ, and Ms.\nFiadjoe’s testimony. Ms. Jansen explained her failure to use\nthe term Trokosi in her report, limiting her description of the\nfather’s behavior as being a “fetish”:\n                One of the shortcomings of my work with Ms.\n                Fiadjoe falls to my lack of understanding at that\n                time about the Trokosi religion and the\n                definition of a fetish priest. She spoke often of\n                her father’s fetish practices and interpreting her\n                words and their meaning was very difficult.\n                She did state on many occasions that her father\n                would be intoxicated just prior to him raping\n                her, and based on my own cultural background I\n                connected the term “fetish” to her father’s abuse\n                of alcohol. I did not at that time investigate the\n                religious practices of fetish priests and was\n                unaware of the specifics of the Trokosi religion.\n                Since that time, I have learned more about that\n                religion and its practices and it fits precisely\n                with the experiences she was relating to me.\n                Again, my focus was on her immediate physical\n                and psychological well being and I failed to\n                investigate the cultural implications fully.\n\n       Addressing the statement in her original letter that Ms.\nFiadjoe had informed Ahmed of the father’s sexual abuse,\nMs. Jansen wrote:\n              There was some controversy over whether Ms.\n              Fiadjoe discussed these matters with her fiancé,\n              Ahmed. In reviewing my notes, I make\n              reference to the fact that Ahmed was “aware of\n              the abuse by her father”. When consulting my\n              notes to prepare the initial letter, I interpreted\n\n                               35\n\f              them to mean both the physical and sexual\n              abuse. I cannot now independently recall\n              whether I specifically referred to the physical\n              and sexual abuse when discussing this matter\n              with Ms. Fiadjoe. It would not at all surprise\n              me that she would have told him about the\n              physical abuse but not the sexual abuse. Indeed,\n              noting the cultural taboos and shame involved,\n              it is very likely that she would not tell Ahmed of\n              the multiple violent rapes she endured at the\n              hands of her father.\n\n       Addressing the subject of the manner of Ahmed’s\ndeath, Ms. Jansen explains that she merely inferred that he\nhad been shot and does not recall that Ms. Fiadjoe informed\nher that he had been shot:\n              There appeared to be additional controversy\n              over Ms. Fiadjoe’s knowledge of the manner of\n              Ahmed’s death. Again, in reviewing my notes,\n              I documented that while in the “shower room”\n              Ms. Fiadjoe heard a “loud noise” and upon\n              entering her bedroom, found Ahmed dying on\n              the floor. I believe that it was my interpretation\n              of events that Ahmed had been shot. I\n              apologize for the confusion that interpretation\n              caused. I have no independent recollection of\n              Ms. Fiadjoe specifically stating the manner of\n              death. Recall, please, that the purpose of my\n              services was not an investigative one. When I\n              began seeing Ms. Fiadjoe she was not able to\n              eat properly, was not sleeping consistently, was\n              experiencing severe flashbacks and distressing\n              nightmares, and was attempting to adjust to an\n              extremely foreign environment. It was my\n              purpose to alleviate the immediate\n              psychological pain and suffering and to assist\n\n                               36\n\f              her in adjusting to her new environment. The\n              exact manner of her fiancé’s murder was\n              inconsequential to the critical task at hand.\n\n        Apart from the failure of the BIA to consider this\nadditional evidence, Ms. Fiadjoe advanced four other grounds\nfor reconsideration; i) the BIA’s reliance upon Ms. Fiadjoe’s\nstatements to an INS officer upon arrival as a basis for a\nnegative credibility finding; ii) its finding that Ms. Fiadjoe\nhad failed to carry her burden that the government of Ghana\nwas unable or unwilling to assist her; iii) its finding that Ms.\nFiadjoe could have relocated to another part of Ghana; and iv)\nthe BIA’s failure to consider Ms. Fiadjoe’s persecution on\naccount of her religion as a Christian opposed to Trokosi and\nher feminist political opinion that women should be educated\nand not subjugated to men.\n        The BIA denied the motion for reconsideration stating\nthat Ms. Fiadjoe had not identified any change of law, new\nlegal argument or error in the BIA’s previous analysis that\nwould move it to reconsider its decision. It noted that the\ninconsistent statements to an immigration officer upon which\nit relied to support its credibility finding were not made at the\nairport immediately after landing but were made some weeks\nlater during a fair and thoughtful interview, thus rendering\nMs. Fiadjoe’s reliance upon the cases cited in support of the\nmotion misplaced.\n        Ms. Fiadjoe filed in this Court a petition for review of\nthe denial of the motion for reconsideration. That petition has\nbeen consolidated with the original petition for review.\n                           VI. Discussion\n        A. Jurisdiction and Standard of Review: We have\njurisdiction to review final orders of the BIA under §242(a)(1)\nof the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §1252(a)(1)\n(1999).\n        Both the IJ and the BIA made an adverse credibility\ndetermination. The final order that we review is the decision\n\n                               37\n\fof the BIA, and normally we review the decision of the BIA,\nnot the IJ, Gao v. Ashcroft, 299 F.3d 266, 271 (3d Cir. 2002);\nAbdulai v. Ashcroft, 239 F. 3d 542 545 (3d Cir. 2001). There\nare exceptions to this rule. If, for instance, the BIA affirms\nthe IJ’s decision for the reasons set forth in that decision, the\nIJ’s opinion effectively becomes the BIA’s, and, accordingly,\na court must review the IJ’s decision. Korytnyuk v. Ashcroft,\n396 F.3d 272, 286 (3d Cir. 2005).\n        In the present case the BIA stated at the outset that it\nagreed with the IJ’s finding that Ms. Fiadjoe was not credible.\nIt then set forth a single paragraph devoted to the credibility\nissue, listing two of the inconsistencies upon which the IJ had\nrelied. Thus, as in Xie v. Ashcroft, 359 F.3d 239 (3d Cir.\n2004), we address the circumstance in which “the BIA both\nadopted the IJ’s adverse credibility determination and\ndiscussed some, but not all, of the underlying bases for the\nIJ’s adverse credibility determination.” Id., at 242. In the\npresent case, in light of its expression of agreement with the\nIJ’s credibility finding and its own sketchy credibility\nanalysis, the BIA must have relied upon the adverse\ncredibility finding of the IJ. We thus have jurisdiction to\nreview both the BIA’s and IJ’s opinions. Id., at 242; see also,\nMiah v. Ashcroft, 346 F.3d 434 (3d Cir. 2003); Senathirajah\nv. INS, 157 F.3d 210 (3d Cir. 1998). There is an additional\nreason to review the INS decision and the hearing from which\nthe decision derived. Any adverse credibility determinations\nbased on the testimony must be viewed with great caution in\nview of the abusive nature of the hearing.\n        Adverse credibility determinations are reviewed under\nthe substantial evidence standard. Under this standard, the\nBIA’s adverse credibility determination must be upheld on\nreview unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled\nto conclude to the contrary. Minor inconsistencies do not\nprovide an adequate basis for an adverse credibility finding.\nXie, 359 F. 3d at 243.\n        Apart from its adverse credibility determination, the\n\n                               38\n\fBIA found that Ms. Fiadjoe failed to establish that the\ngovernment of Ghana was either unable or unwilling to\ncontrol her father’s ritual sexual abuse 3 . We must uphold this\nfactual finding if it is “supported by reasonable, substantial,\nand probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.”\nINS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 481 (1992). We should\nfind substantial evidence lacking only where the evidence\n“was so compelling that no reasonable fact finder could fail to\nfind the requisite fear of persecution.” Id. at 483-84; see also\n8 U.S.C. §1252(b)(4)(B); Abdille v. Ashcroft, 242 F. 3d 477,\n483-84 (3d Cir. 2001).\n        B. The IJ Hearing and Credibility Finding 4 : Prior to\nthe commencement of testimony before the IJ on April 30,\n2002 the IJ identified the record in his possession. It included\nMs. Fiadjoe’s July 5, 2001 asylum affidavit (Form I-589)\nwhich recited in full detail the circumstances that led to her\nflight - the commencement of her father’s sexual abuse at age\nseven, the resumption of her life as a Trokosi slave at age\neighteen and the continuing beatings and periodic rape\ncommitted by her father. It recited her attempts to escape\nfrom her father’s house, her flight to Nigeria, her return, her\nfather’s murder of the man whom she loved and hoped to\nmarry, and her second flight and inability to find someone in\nAccra who would take her in.\n        Also in the record which the IJ possessed was Ms.\n\n\n        3\n           The BIA did not reach the issues of i) whether bondage as\na Trokosi slave would meet the definition of persecution on account\nof membership in a particular social group; ii) whether if Ms.\nFiadjoe’s testimony were credible she had “established that she was,\nin fact, a Trokosi slave;” and iii) whether Ms. Fiadjoe could escape\npersecution by locating elsewhere in Ghana.\n       4\n           Significantly, on this appeal the government made no\nattempt to defend the credibility determinations of either the IJ or the\nBIA.\n\n                                  39\n\fJansen’s June 22, 2000 letter describing her therapy sessions\nwith Ms. Fiadjoe and Ms. Fiadjoe’s emotional state. Ms.\nJansen recounted how Ms. Fiadjoe’s emotional condition\nimproved markedly after sessions of counseling and that\nalthough “[h]er communication abilities have improved,” she\nnevertheless “continues to occasionally dissociate when\ndiscussing emotionally painful events.” It was, of course,\nnecessary to testify about emotionally painful events at the\nApril 30, 2002 hearing.\n       The INS Guidelines entitled “Consideration for\nAsylum Officers Adjudicating Asylum Claims from Women”\ndescribe in general terms the phenomena that Ms. Jansen\nobserved in Ms. Fiadjoe. The Guidelines are as applicable to\nan IJ credibility determination as they are to an Asylum\nOfficer’s credibility determination, e.g.,:\n               Women who have been raped or otherwise\n               sexually abused may be seriously stigmatized\n               and ostracized in their societies. They may also\n               be subject to additional violence, abuse or\n               discrimination because they are viewed as\n               having brought shame and dishonor on\n               themselves, their families, and their\n               communities.\n\n                              …\n\n              Women who have been subject to domestic or\n              sexual abuse may be psychologically\n              traumatized. Trauma can be suffered by any\n              applicant, regardless, of gender, and may have a\n              significant impact on the ability to present\n              testimony.\n\n              The demeanor of traumatized applicants can\n              vary. They may appear numb or show\n\n\n                              40\n\f             emotional passivity when recounting past events\n             of mistreatment. Some applicants may give\n             matter-of-fact recitations of serious instances of\n             mistreatment. Trauma may also cause memory\n             loss or distortion, and may cause other\n             applicants to block certain experiences from\n             their minds in order not to relive their horror by\n             the retelling.\n\n             In Anglo-American cultures, people who avert\n             their gaze when answering a question, or seem\n             nervous, are perceived as untruthful. In other\n             cultures, however, body language does not\n             convey the same message. In certain Asian\n             cultures, for example, people will avert their\n             eyes when speaking to an authority figure as a\n             sign of respect. This is a product of culture, not\n             necessarily of credibility.\n\n             It bears reiteration that the foregoing\n             considerations of demeanor can be the products\n             of trauma or culture, not credibility. Poor\n             interview techniques/cross-cultural skills may\n             cause faulty negative credibility findings.\n\n        From the outset of the April 30, 2002 hearing the IJ\ntook over much of the questioning of Ms. Fiadjoe, both on\ndirect and on cross-examination by the government. His tone\nwas hostile and at times became extraordinarily abusive. If\nnot by design, in effect, he produced the very atmosphere that\nMs. Jansen and the INS Guidelines anticipated would cause\nmemory loss, blocking, dissociating and breakdown.\n        Examining Ms. Fiadjoe concerning the highly sensitive\nsubject of her father’s sexual abuse at age seven, the IJ’s\nquestioning reduced her to tears (see transcript excerpt at.\npp.14-16, supra).\n\n                              41\n\f        At that point in the proceedings Ms. Fiadjoe began\nhaving difficulty responding to the IJ. She had been born in\n1971. In response to her attorney’s questions she testified that\nshe went to live with her Aunt Dela in Accra when she was\nseven, i.e., in 1978, thus bringing the sexual abuse to a\ntemporary halt. She further testified that she remained with\nAunt Dela eleven years and was 18 years of age when she\nreturned to her father’s home upon the death of Aunt Dela. A\nrather simple calculation would have placed this in the year\n1989, but under the IJ’s harsh questioning Ms. Fiadjoe was\nunable to recall the year and was reduced to an inability to\nrespond (see transcript excerpt at pp 16-17, supra).\n        The bullying nature of the IJ’s questioning was further\nevident in his interrogation of Ms. Fiadjoe about her\nknowledge that her father kept idols in the room in which he\nworshiped when she testified that she had never been in the\nroom. Ignoring the obvious point that Ms. Fiadjoe made, that\nshe could see into the room without entering it, the IJ\ncontinued to badger her (see transcript excerpt at p. 17-18\nsupra).\n        Dealing with a subject that can only have been\nextremely painful to Ms. Fiadjoe, her father’s murder of her\nfiancé Ahmed, the IJ pursued an apparent inconsistency\nbetween Ms. Fiadjoe’s testimony and Ms. Jansen’s report\nconcerning whether Ms. Fiadjoe had told Ahmed about the\nsexual aspect of the abuse she had suffered. The IJ reduced\nMs. Fiadjoe to an inability to respond to his questions (see\ntranscript excerpt at pp 18-19 supra).\n        These are examples of the manner in which the IJ\ntreated Ms. Fiadjoe throughout the hearing. An examination\nof the entire transcript discloses other instances of his extreme\ninsensitivity towards the witness and his failure to take into\naccount the abuses to which she had been subjected in Ghana.\nThe IJ’s own concluding questions and remarks demonstrate\nthat he had reduced her to the emotional state against which\nMs. Jansen and the INS Guidelines had warned:\n\n                               42\n\fJUDGE TO MS. FIADJOE\n\n          Q:   Ms. Fiadjoe, you’ve heard my decision,\n               you’ve heard what I’ve just said?\n\n          A:   (No audible response).\n\n          Q:   Oh, you were sleeping there, you fell\n               asleep didn’t you?\n\n          A:   (No audible response).\n\n          Q:   You fell asleep during my decision?\n\n          A:   No, I’m feeling headache.\n\n          Q:   Did you hear what I said or were you\n               asleep?\n\n          A:   I wasn’t asleep.\n\n          Q:   Did you hear what I said?\n\n          A:   I thought that you (indiscernible), so I\n               didn’t.\n\n          Q:   Okay, all right, well, what I said was,\n               that first of all, I don’t believe your\n               testimony, I think that you were making\n               up your testimony as you were going\n               along. Your testimony is contradicted\n               by, much of it is contradicted by your\n               own witness, Ms. Jansen, her, her, the\n               letter that she wrote, your testimony\n               generally doesn’t make sense. I further\n               found, and I denied it, basically because\n\n                        43\n\f                      of that, I further found that if I had found\n                      that you were credible, that you were\n                      telling me the truth, I do not find that - -\n\n                     (OFF THE RECORD)\n\n        As the INS Guidelines stated, “[p]oor interview\ntechniques/cross-cultural skills may cause faulty negative\ncredibility findings”. They most certainly did so in this case.\n        The conduct of the IJ by itself would require a\nrejection of his credibility finding. Apart from that\nconsideration, the formal reasons he gave for finding “that the\nrespondent is making up her testimony as she is going along,\nshe’s making up these scenarios and she is fabricating her\ntestimony to the Court” do not withstand examination.\n        First, the IJ relied upon Ms. Fiadjoe’s inability to state\nthe year when she returned from Aunt Dela to her father’s\nhouse. It is true that Ms. Fiadjoe, after being subjected to the\nIJ’s brow beating, could not recall the year of her return.\nHowever, she testified that she was born in 1971, left for Aunt\nDela’s home when she was seven (1978) and returned after\neleven years when she was eighteen years of age. The\ninability to recall during the stress of the hearing that the year\nof return was 1989 does not affect credibility.\n        The IJ found that Ms. Fiadjoe’s testimony that her\nfather kept idols in the shrine room in his home was\ninconsistent with her testimony that she never entered the\nroom. In spite of the badgering nature of the IJ’s questioning,\nMs. Fiadjoe fully explained that without entering she could\nsee into the room, that idols were also kept outside the room,\nand that she observed other Trokosi adherents enter the room\nto bring food to the idols and later leave. There was no\ninconsistency in her testimony.\n        Referring to Ms. Fiadjoe’s testimony about her return\nto her father’s home after her and Ahmed’s abortive attempt\nto establish a residence in Nigeria, the IJ attributes to Ms.\n\n                               44\n\fFiadjoe the statement that “she returned there since she did\nnot want her father to be angered by the fact that she was with\nAhmed.” The IJ found that “[t]his absolutely is totally\nimplausible and totally nonsensical to the Court, insofar as the\nrespondent was returning to a situation where she knew she\nwas going to be raped and beaten.” The IJ’s subsequent\nobservations make no sense: “And I don’t believe that she\nwould have any fear that her father would be angered and if\nshe did have a fear, that fear would be a lesser fear than the\nrape and the beatings that she knew awaited her. As it turned\nout, when the respondent did return, her father not only beat\nher but poured hot water on her as a form of punishment.” In\nthe first place the IJ does not give an accurate recital of Ms.\nFiadjoe’s testimony. She did not want her father to attack\nAhmed but the reason she gave for returning to her father was\nthat “I don’t, my father, I don’t have anybody to go to,” a fact\nthat, as will be discussed in connection with the BIA’s\ncredibility finding, is fully supported by the record.\n        Next, the IJ found Ms. Fiadjoe lacked credibility\nbecause “Ms. Jansen’s letter reflects nothing to the effect that\nrespondent’s father was a member of the Trokosi cult, nor that\nthe respondent herself was a Trokosi slave. The respondent\nwas not able to explain why what she told the Court, was not\ntold to the social worker.” The IJ’s premise that Ms. Fiadjoe\ndid not tell Ms. Jansen about the Trokosi sect is totally wrong,\neven if reference is made only to the letter in evidence before\nthe IJ. Repeatedly throughout the asylum proceedings Ms.\nFiadjoe referred to her father’s Trokosi practices as his\n“fetish.” In her June 22, 2000 letter Ms. Jansen writes, “Ms.\nFiadjoe describes her father as having a religious “fetish.”\nMs. Jansen at that time did not understand what Ms. Fiadjoe\nwas telling her, a misunderstanding which she later overcame,\nas explained in her October 31, 2002 letter, which will be\ndiscussed further in connection with the BIA’s credibility\ndetermination. In any event, the IJ was simply in error when\nhe stated that Ms. Jansen’s letter reflects nothing to the effect\n\n                               45\n\fthat Ms. Fiadjoe’s father was a member of the Trokosi cult.\n        The IJ perceived two other inconsistencies between\nMs. Fiadjoe’s testimony and what appeared in Ms. Jansen’s\nJune 22, 2000 letter. He assumed Ms. Fiadjoe told Ms.\nJansen what was stated in the letter. First, Ms. Fiadjoe\ntestified that she never told Ahmed about the sexual assaults\nupon her, whereas the letter states Ahmed “was aware of the\nsexual assaults by her father, but was powerless to stop them.”\nSecond, Ms. Fiadjoe testified that, not having seen her father\nkill Ahmed, she did not know how he was killed, whereas the\nletter states “[w]hen she emerged, she found her boyfriend\nlying shot on the floor.” (emphasis added). As disclosed in\nMs. Jansen’s October 21, 2002 letter (which was not before\nthe IJ), these inconsistencies resulted from Ms. Jansen’s\nerroneous assumptions, not from misstatements of Ms.\nFiadjoe. Even if there were such inconsistencies (which there\nwere not), they were minor in nature. In the entire flow of\nevents that afflicted Ms. Fiadjoe from age seven until she fled\nfrom Ghana, it was immaterial whether Ahmed knew of the\nsexual abuse as well as the other forms of abuse perpetrated\nby the father and whether the father shot or stabbed Ahmed,\nthe only likely other means of killing him.\n        The IJ relied upon statements that Ms. Fiadjoe made to\nImmigration officers upon her arrival in the United States and\nupon the occasion of her Asylum Pre-screening Interview on\nMarch 30, 2000, which are inconsistent with her asylum\naffidavit, the information she provided Ms. Jansen and her\ntestimony. For reasons that will be set forth in the discussion\nof the BIA’s credibility determination, these statements do not\nconstitute substantial evidence that would permit a finding\nthat Ms. Fiadjoe lacked credibility.\n        As the IJ expressed it, “[t]he credibility of the\nrespondent is of extreme importance in assessing respondent’s\nclaim.” No adverse credibility assessment derived from a\nhearing conducted under the circumstances and in the manner\nthat the IJ conducted the April 30, 2002 hearing could survive\n\n                              46\n\freview. Further, even if the hearing were conducted in an\neven-handed, fair manner, the reasons that the IJ gave for his\nfinding of lack of credibility are not supported by substantial\nevidence.\n        C. The BIA’s Credibility Finding: Of necessity the\nBIA had before it the transcript of the IJ hearing and the\ndocumentary record. Ms. Fiadjoe’s asylum application, her\nrecital of events during her counseling with Ms. Jansen and\nher testimony at the hearing were consistent in their detailed\ndescription of the extended series of horrifying events that\noccurred in her life from age seven until her flight from\nGhana after the murder of Ahmed. Despite the IJ’s\nconclusion that “[she was] making up her testimony as [she\nwas] going along,” it is highly improbable that anyone could\nconsistently recount these events in detail on each of these\nthree occasions.\n        The BIA, apart from its general agreement with the IJ’s\nadverse credibility determination, relied upon two grounds for\nits own adverse credibility determination: i) a purported\ninconsistency in Ms. Fiadjoe’s testimony concerning the\nnature of the sexual abuse that her father perpetrated upon her\nat age seven, and ii) the inconsistencies in her sworn\nstatement before an Asylum Officer given approximately\nnineteen days after she was taken into custody at the airport.\nDespite the critical nature of the issue and the extensiveness\nof the record, the BIA devoted a mere twelve lines of its\nopinion to set forth the reasons for its credibility finding.\n        As to the sexual abuse at age 7, the BIA decision\nstated:\n               She claimed in her written asylum application\n               and during her testimony in immigration court\n               that her father began to abuse her sexually and\n               attempted to rape her when she was 7 years old\n               (Exh. 6-2 at 2; Tr. at 25). Shortly thereafter, she\n               modified her testimony somewhat and claimed\n               that her father had in fact raped her when she\n\n                               47\n\f              was 7 (Tr. at 32).\n\n        In her asylum application (Exh. 6-2 at 2) Ms. Fiadjoe\nstated, “[a]fter my parent’s [sic] separation, I lived with my\nfather and he began to sexually abuse me. This started when I\nwas 7 years old.” At her hearing (Tr. at 25) Ms. Fiadjoe\ntestified, “[a]t the age of seven, he’s tried to rape me and\nabuse me and beat me up and want me to be part of Trokosi,\nTrokosi.” At the point in the hearing when the IJ had reduced\nMs. Fiadjoe to tears and berated her for crying and “beating\naround bush” he asked her how long her father beat or raped\nher (Tr. at 32), to which she responded before dissolving into\ntears “[f]or, till I was seven, I know my father was raping\nme.” There is no necessary inconsistency in these statements.\nSexual abuse during a three months’ period could plausibly\ninclude both attempted rape and rape. Moreover, it is\nunreasonable to expect a person to remember whether the\nrepeated sexual abuse she suffered at age seven constituted\nattempted rape or actual rape. In the present case, in light of\nwhat followed in the ensuing years, any imprecision in this\nregard cannot rationally be a basis for an adverse credibility\nfinding.\n        As to the inconsistencies in the statement before the\nAsylum Officer, the BIA decision stated:\n                However, the respondent stated in a sworn\n                statement before an asylum officer with the\n                Immigration and Naturalization Service (now\n                the Department of Homeland Security, DHS)\n                that the abuse began approximately 3 years prior\n                to her interview in 2000 (Exh. 6-9 at 4), when\n                she would have been 26 or 27. In fact, she\n                claimed in that interview that she never allowed\n                her father to have sex with her (id.), in stark\n                contrast to her later claims of on-going rape (Tr.\n                at 27-28, 76, 78-79).\n\n\n                               48\n\f        On March 30, 2000 Asylum Officer James L. Reaves\nconducted an Asylum Pre-Screening Interview. There can be\nno criticism of the manner in which he conducted the\ninterview. He ensured that Ms. Fiadjoe had an interpreter in\nthe Twi language. His questions were concise. There is every\nreason to believe that he, unlike the IJ, followed the INS\nMemorandum on Considerations for Asylum Officers\nAdjudicating Asylum Claims from Women, dated May 6,\n1995.\n        With one exception, the answers Ms. Fiadjoe gave to\nhim were fully consistent with her subsequent asylum\napplication, her statements to Ms. Jansen and her hearing\ntestimony. They included information about her family, her\nfather’s beatings, her flight from home, the murder of her\nfiancé, and her inability thereafter to find refuge with Aunt\nDela’s husband, her mother and stepfather and the friend in\nAccra. Ms. Fiadjoe’s statement before Officer Reaves\ndeparted from her asylum application, the information she\ngave to Ms. Jansen and her hearing testimony in the following\nrespect:\n               Q:     Have you ever been harmed in your\n                      country by anyone?\n               A:     Yes, by my father.\n               Q:     What did your father do to you?\n               A:     He abused me by beating me.\n               Q:     When did this happen?\n               A:     He started doing this about 3 years ago.\n               Q:     Did you live with him at that time?\n               A:     Yes, I was staying at home.\n               Q:     How long did this continue?\n               A:     This continued for 3 years, sometimes he\n                      tried to have sex with me.\n               Q:     Did you ever have sex with your father?\n               A:     No, I never allowed it.\n               Q:     When did this happen?\n               A:     It happened many times during the three\n\n                             49\n\f                     years. When someone came to the house\n                     to marry me he would reject them.\n\n              Q:     When did this end?\n\n              A:     It never ended until I ran away from\n                     home. He wanted me to marry an old\n                     man, I told him no. A friend came over\n                     to my house. I went to take a shower and\n                     when I returned the friend was dead. I\n                     think my father killed my boyfriend. He\n                     was 33 years old.\n\n              Q:     Did your father kill this young man?\n\n              A:     I was in the shower, when I came out my\n                     father was coming out of my room. I\n                     don’t know what he used to kill him.\n\n        To determine whether this discrepancy constitutes\nsubstantial evidence to support the IJ’s and the BIA’s adverse\ncredibility determinations, it is necessary to examine the\ncircumstances in which the statement was given. Only\nnineteen days previously, March 11, 2000, Ms. Fiadjoe had\narrived in this country traumatized by years of sexual\noppression, the March 5 murder of her fiancé and a desperate\nbut futile effort to find refuge from her father in Accra. On\nher arrival at the airport she was questioned by an INS Officer\nand gave nonsensical answers. For example, when asked why\nshe left her home country she responded “I want to look after\nmy mother.”\n        It is established in this Circuit that inconsistencies\nbetween an airport statement and an asylum seeker’s\ntestimony before an IJ is not sufficient, standing alone, to\nsupport a BIA finding that the petitioner was not credible.\nBalasubramanrim v. INS, 143 F.3d 157, 164 (3d Cir. 1998).\n\n                              50\n\fSuch an interview is likely to be hurried; language difficulties\narise; the results may be inaccurately recorded, and an\narriving alien who has suffered abuse in his home country\nmay be reluctant to reveal full information in his or her first\nmeeting with the government. Id., at 162-3. As we stated in\nSenathirajah v. INS, 157 F.3d 210, 218:\n               By placing too much reliance on an airport\n               interview under the circumstances here, and\n               ignoring more detailed accounts in Form 1-589\n               as well as testimony at an asylum hearing, the\n               INS seriously undermined the reliability of the\n               administrative process.\n\n        The Asylum Officer’s interview of Ms. Fiadjoe was\nnot conducted at the airport shortly after her arrival; it was\nconducted on March 30, 2002, approximately nineteen days\nlater, at the York County Prison. Yet conditions similar to,\nand in many ways worse than, those at an airport interview\nprevailed. Ms. Fiadjoe was still in a state of shock resulting\nfrom the devastating experiences prior to March 11. Ms.\nJansen described Ms. Fiadjoe’s emotional state which existed\nat the time of the Asylum Officer’s interview and thereafter\nuntil she had undergone counseling with Ms. Jansen:\n               In the aftermath of her fiancee’s murder, Ms.\n               Fiadjoe was in a state of shock. She reports\n               symptoms that are textbook acute psychological\n               trauma. Without significant training in trauma\n               psychology, she would be very unlikely to\n               falsely report those symptoms much less\n               describe them in the details as she and I have\n               discussed them.\n\n        Finding herself in a strange place before a male officer\nit is not surprising that Ms. Fiadjoe would be unable to\ndiscuss the shameful and taboo incidents of incestuous rape.\nIn both her letters Ms. Jansen described Ms. Fiadjoe’s\n\n                               51\n\femotional state when she first saw her and recounted that it\nwas not until Ms. Fiadjoe had engaged in a number of therapy\nsessions that she was able to discuss fully, even with her,\nsexual abuses which her father had committed. Completely\nconsistent with the INS Memorandum concerning\nconsiderations for adjudicating claims of women, Ms. Jansen\nwrote in her October 31, 2002 letter:\n               It is extraordinarily difficult for sexual abuse\n               victims to discuss specifics of their abuse\n               experiences. Given the extreme shame that\n               surrounds these issues in general they are\n               difficult for both men and women to discuss.\n               With the addition of the cultural factors\n               surrounding Ms. Fiadjoe’s experiences in\n               particular, it should be of no surprise at all that\n               she would be reluctant to discuss these issues\n               with anyone, most specifically with a male or in\n               the presence of several males.\n\n        Asked on cross examination why she had not informed\nthe INS Officer about what had happened, Ms. Fiadjoe\nresponded, “About sexual aspects, my father sleeping with\nme, I don’t feel comfortable telling people . . ..” The BIA\nconsidered none of these factors when rendering its decision.\n        As discussed above, the inconsistency in Ms. Fiadjoe’s\nstatement to the Asylum Officer is all that is left that reflects\non Ms. Fiadjoe’s credibility. None of the other reasons given\nby either the IJ or the BIA support an adverse credibility\ndetermination. By placing reliance on this interview under\nthe circumstances in which it was taken and “ignoring more\ndetailed accounts in Form 1-589 as well as testimony at an\nasylum hearing, the INS seriously undermined the reliability\nof the administrative process.” Senathirajah, 157 F.3d at 218.\nNeither the IJ’s nor the BIA’s adverse credibility\ndetermination is supported by substantial evidence.\n        D. Government Protection: Under 8 U.S.C.\n\n                                52\n\f§1158(b)(1), the Attorney General may grant asylum to an\nalien who is a “refugee” within the meaning of 8 U.S.C.\n§1101(a)(42). Generally speaking, an applicant must show\nthat he or she:\n               is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable\n               or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the\n               protection of [the country of such person’s\n               nationality or in which such a person last\n               habitually resided], because of persecution or a\n               well-founded fear of persecution on account of\n               race, religion, nationality, membership in a\n               particular social group, or political opinion . . .\n\n8 U.S.C. §1101(a)(42)(A). A showing of past persecution\ngives rise to a rebuttable presumption of a well-founded fear\nof future persecution. 8 C.F.R. §1208. 13(b)(1).\n        To establish persecution, an alien must show past or\npotential harm rising to the level of persecution on account of\na statutorily enumerated ground that is committed by the\ngovernment or by forces the government is unable or\nunwilling to control. See Gao v. Ashcroft, 299 F.3d 266, 272\n(3d Cir. 2002).\n        The BIA found that Ms. Fiadjoe’s claim for asylum\nmust be denied for failure to establish that the government of\nGhana was either unable or unwilling to control her father’s\nritual sexual abuse. The BIA’s evidential support for this\nfinding is set forth in its entirety in a bare six lines of its\ndecision:\n               The respondent never sought the help of the\n               authorities in Ghana (Tr. at 66). The respondent\n               claimed that her grandmother told the police of\n               the respondent’s being beaten but that she\n               declined to tell the authorities about the ritual\n               sex abuse due to shame (Tr. at 29. The\n               respondent submitted evidence that the\n               government of Ghana outlawed Trokosi practice\n\n                                53\n\f               and ritual bondage in 1998 and that a non-\n               governmental organization has had success in\n               liberating, counseling, and rehabilitating past\n               victims of such bondage. (Exh. 6-5).\n\n       In the context of the record viewed in its entirety, these\ntwo snippets of information, both of them inadequately stated,\ndo not constitute substantial evidence to support the BIA’s\nfinding that Ms. Fiadjoe has failed to establish that the\ngovernment of Ghana was either unable or unwilling to\ncontrol her father’s ritual sexual abuse. The BIA totally\nignored the evidence in the record that establishes the deep\nhold that the Trokosi religion has upon substantial elements of\nthe Ghanian people. For example:\n               Appalled by the practice, some Ghanians have\n               broken the fearful silence which surrounds\n               Trokosi. But their calls for it to be banned have\n               had little impact on the centuries old tradition\n               which has the blessing of some of Ghana’s most\n               powerful man. Jerry Rawlings, the country’s\n               charismatic if not exactly democratic, president\n               - himself an Ewe - has spoken of Trokosi as an\n               important part of Ghana’s cultural heritage.\n\nBooker, Slave of the Fetish, the Independent - London (June\n\n16, 1996) (R. 363)5 .\n\n       5\n          The dissenting opinion concludes that we have failed to\naccord proper deference to the BIA’s finding on the issue of\ngovernment protection in Ghana. The lengthy quotation from the\nState Department’s 2000 Country Report on Human Rights Practices\nin Ghana to which the dissent refers does in fact set forth efforts of\nthe government and human rights organizations to end the Trokosi\npractice, but the concluding portion of the quotation recites how\nineffective the government efforts have been despite limited success\n\n                                 54\n\f        Nor is it easy to escape from Trokosi slavery.\nSpeaking of his slaves, one Trokosi priest stated, “Their\nfamilies wouldn’t take them back. They’re too afraid of\nangering the fetish.”\n        The BIA was incorrect when it stated that “[t]he\nrespondent never sought the help of the authorities in Ghana.”\nMs. Fiadjoe did seek such help through her grandmother who\ntwice sought assistance from the police. It is true, as the BIA\nstates, that the grandmother was too ashamed to mention the\nsexual aspect of the abuse, but the record is replete with\nevidence that the police would have done nothing even if they\n\n\n\n\nby NGOs:\n\n                     The Government has not prosecuted any\n                     practitioners of Trokosi and in August 1999,\n                     a presidential aide criticized anti-Trokosi\n                     activists for being insensitive to indigenous\n                     cultural and “religious” beliefs and practices.\n                     A local group, calling itself the “Troxovi\n                     Institutional Council” (Troxovi is an alternate\n                     spelling for Trokosi) declared that Trokosi, as\n                     defined by CHRAJ and other human rights\n                     groups to be a form of ritual servitude, does\n                     not exist in the country. The group claimed\n                     that the practice of “Troxovi” does exist but\n                     neither enslaves nor exploits anyone. The\n                     Council also listed 23 ‘genuine Troxovi\n                     shrines’ in Ghana, describing them as\n                     educational institutions and as part of the\n                     “Afrikania religion.” The claims were widely\n                     refuted by chiefs, the press, and NGOs.\n\nAR:343-44 (emphasis added)\n\n\n                               55\n\fhad been informed of that aspect of the abuse 6 .\n       The most recent State Department Report covering\nGhana shows how futile resort to the police would have been.\nMultiple pages are devoted to the brutality and corruption of\nthe police and their refusal to prosecute sensitive crime, as\nTrokosi sexual practices certainly were, particularly in a\nvillage inhabited by believers in the sect. The Report notes\nthat “[v]iolence against women, including rape and domestic\nviolence remains a significant problem. A 1998 study\nrevealed that particularly in low-income, high-density sections\nof greater Accra, at least 54 percent of women have been\nassaulted in recent years. A total of 95 percent of the victims\nof domestic violence are women according to data gathered\nby the FIDA. These abuses generally go unreported and\nseldom come before the courts. The police tend not to\nintervene in domestic disputes.”\n       Ms. Fiadjoe’s own experiences demonstrate that where\na Trokosi slave is involved the police will not intervene. She\nhad to flee to another country to escape from her father,\nwhere, unfortunately she was unable to stay. When she\nobtained her own room from a landlord in her neighborhood,\nher father so terrorized the landlord that he turned her out.\nSurely if the landlord had thought he could have obtained\nappropriate protection for himself and his tenant he would\nhave turned to the public authorities. Similarly, when Ms.\nFiadjoe fled to Accra after Ahmed’s murder, her own mother\ndid not dare to take her in, nor did her Aunt Dela’s husband,\n\n       6\n            The dissent finds Fiadjoe’s hearing testimony vague\nconcerning what her grandmother told the police. When evaluating\nMs. Fiadjoe’s testimony it should be kept in mind that it was given\nduring a hearing at which the IJ treated Ms. Fiadjoe with total\ninsensitivity throughout, causing her to break down, become confused\nand ultimately to become reduced to silence. The BIA majority took\nno account of this factor.\n\n\n                                56\n\fnor did an old friend. The old friend was so frightened that\nthe father would suspect that Ms. Fiadjoe had come to him\nthat he removed her to a girlfriend’s house, of which the\nfather was presumably unaware, and assisted her in obtaining\na false passport for flight out of the country. If the authorities\nwere willing or able to protect this Trokosi slave none of this\nflight and fear would have been necessary7 .\n        The BIA selected two facts set forth in the State\nDepartment Report: i) “the government of Ghana outlawed\nTrokosi practice and ritual bondage in 1998\" and ii) “a non-\ngovernmental organization has had success in liberating,\ncounseling, and rehabilitating past victims of such bondage.”\n(emphasis added). This selective use of the State Department\nReport is misleading and does not constitute substantial\nevidence.\n        In the first place, the BIA ignored other evidence in the\nrecord demonstrating continuation of Trokosi slavery and the\ngovernment’s unwillingness and inability to end it. The State\nDepartment Report itself confirms this continuation despite\nthe 1998 legislation that banned “‘customary servitude’\n(known as Trokosi)”.\n        The Ghanian Constitution had for a long time\nprohibited such practices. “Every person has a right to\npersonal liberty.” Art. 14. “No person shall be held in\nslavery and servitude or be required to perform forced labor.”\nArt. 16. These provisions had had no effect on the Trokosi\ncult. Similarly the 1998 legislation outlawing Trokosi has not\nsucceeded in eliminating Trokosi slavery. While it is true that\n\n\n\n       7\n         These facts, along with much other evidence, totally negate\nthe BIA’s statement that “respondent implicitly admitted that she\ncould escape her father’s abuse by moving to an urban area.” It is\nunnecessary to rule at this time that this finding also is not supported\nby substantial evidence because the BIA only advanced it in a\nhypothetical context.\n\n                                  57\n\fcertain organizations have succeeded in liberating and\nretraining approximately 2,800 Trokosi slaves, the 2001 State\nDepartment Report confirms that the practice remains very\nmuch alive:\n              Trokosi, a traditional practice found among the\n              Ewe ethnic group and in part of the Volta\n              Region, is an especially severe human rights\n              abuse and an extremely serious violation of\n              children’s and women’s rights. It is a system in\n              which a young girl, sometimes under the age of\n              10, is made a slave to a fetish shrine for\n              offenses allegedly committed by a member of\n              the girl’s family. In rare instances, boys are\n              offered. The belief is that, if someone in that\n              family has committed a crime, such as stealing,\n              members of the family may begin to die in large\n              numbers unless a young girl is given to the local\n              fetish shrine to atone for the offense. The girl\n              becomes the property of the fetish priest, must\n              work on the priest’s farm, and perform other\n              labors for him. Because they are the sexual\n              property of the priests, most Trokosi slaves have\n              children by the priests. Although the girls’\n              families must provide for their needs such as\n              food, most are unable to do so. There are at\n              least 2,200 girls and women bound to various\n              shrines in the Trokosi system, a figure that does\n              not include the slaves’ children. Even when\n              freed by her fetish priest from the more onerous\n              aspects of her bondage, whether voluntarily or\n              as a result of intervention by activists, a Trokosi\n              woman generally has few marketable skills and\n              little hope of marriage and typically remains\n              bound to the shrine for life by psychological and\n              social pressure arising from a traditional belief\n              that misfortune may befall a Trokosi woman’s\n\n                               58\n\f               family or village if she abandons her obligations\n               to the shrine. When a fetish slave dies, her\n               family is expected to replace her with another\n               young girl, thus perpetuating the bondage to the\n               fetish shrine from generation to generation.\n\n        Human rights organization are hopeful that ultimately\nTrokosi practices can be stamped out, but they persist, and\nMs. Fiadjoe has to live in the present, not in a more hopeful\nfuture. Pertinent to the fact that she can expect no help from\nthe government authorities is the following observation\ncontained in the State Department Report but not addressed\nby the BIA: “The Government has not prosecuted any\npractitioners of Trokosi, and in August 1999, a presidential\naide criticized anti-Trokosi activists for being insensitive to\nindigenous cultural and ‘religious’ beliefs and practices.”\n        In light of Ms. Fiadjoe’s own experiences and the\ndocumentary evidence in the record, we conclude that the\nBIA’s finding that Ms. Fiadjoe failed to establish that the\ngovernment of Ghana was either unwilling or unable to\ncontrol her father’s sexual abuse is not supported by\nsubstantial evidence8 .\n                         IV. Conclusion\n        The adverse credibility determinations of the IJ and of\nthe BIA are not supported by substantial evidence, nor is the\nBIA’s finding that Ms. Fiadjoe failed to establish that the\ngovernment of Ghana was either unwilling or unable to\ncontrol her father’s sexual abuse supported by substantial\nevidence.\n        We will grant the petition for review and remand the\ncase to the BIA for further remand to a different IJ for a new\n\n\n       8\n         In light of the disposition of the case it is unnecessary to\nconsider Ms. Fiadjoe’s petition seeking review of the BIA’s order\ndenying her motion to reconsider its June 6, 2003 opinion.\n\n                                 59\n\fhearing at which there may be received in evidence the\ndocuments that accompanied Ms. Fiadjoe’s motion before the\nBIA for reconsideration of its June 6, 2003 decision and\nevidence, if available, of continuing Trokosi practices and\ngovernmental attempts to eradicate them and to protect\nTrokosi victims.\n\n\n\n\n                            60\n\fFiadjoe v. Ashcroft, Nos. 03-1971, 04-1544\n\nSMITH, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\n       While I would like to conclude otherwise, the majority’s\napproach to its review of the BIA’s findings concerning\ngovernment protection in Ghana is, in my view, inconsistent\nwith the deferential approach we are required to take in these\ncases. Accordingly, I must dissent.\n\n        Ms. Fiajdoe’s is a tragic story. She does not present the\ntypical claim for asylum, in which a refugee seeks protection\nfrom her native government or from forces acting on the\ngovernment’s behalf. Instead, she recounts a history of physical\nand sexual abuse suffered at the hands of her father, allegedly in\nconnection with her father’s activities as a traditional “Trokosi”\npriest. Though the grant of asylum has traditionally been used\nto protect immigrants fleeing government persecution, our laws\nare sensitive to the plight of individuals such as Ms. Fiadjoe. As\nthe majority explains, a private incident that rises to the level of\npersecution can create eligibility for asylum when it is\ncommitted “by forces the government is either unable or\nunwilling to control.” Gao v. Ashcroft, 299 F.3d 266, 272 (3d\nCir. 2002). My difficulty with this case is that, try as I might, I\ncannot say - as the law requires us to say if we are to reverse the\n\n                                61\n\fBIA - that “any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to\nconclude” that the Ghanaian government is unable or unwilling\nto control her father. I cannot say that here because there is\nwhat I consider to be ample evidence in the record to support the\nBIA’s conclusion that, if the government had been informed of\nwhat Fiadjoe claims her father did, it would have been willing\nand able to control him. The majority sidesteps this evidence in\nfavor of other information that may cast doubt on the efficacy of\nGhana’s anti-Trokosi efforts, and holds that the presence of such\nevidence compels an opposite conclusion than that reached by\nthe BIA. It is simply not our charge to do that.9\n\n       To establish eligibility for asylum on the basis of past\npersecution, an applicant must show: “(1) an incident, or\nincidents, that rise to the level of persecution; (2) that is ‘on\naccount of’ one of the statutorily protected grounds; and (3) is\ncommitted by the government or forces the government is either\n‘unable or unwilling’ to control.” Gao v. Ashcroft, 299 F.3d\n266, 272 (3d Cir. 2002) (emphasis added). Whether an\n\n\n       9\n         Shortly before oral argument the government filed a motion\nindicating that Fiadjoe had left the United States and gone to Canada,\nand requested that her appeal be dismissed on the basis of the fugitive\ndisentitlement doctrine. See Arana v. INS, 673 F.2d 75, 77 (3d Cir.\n1982) (per curiam). Letter briefs filed after oral argument indicate\nthat, while Fiadjoe apparently remains in Canada, she informed DHS\nthrough counsel that she has “self-deported,” and in response to this\ninformation the government withdrew its motion to dismiss the\nappeal.\n\n                                  62\n\fapplicant has demonstrated past persecution or a well-founded\nfear of future persecution is a factual determination reviewed\nunder the substantial evidence standard. See id. Where an\napplicant seeks asylum based on private violence, whether the\napplicant’s native government is willing and able to control the\nalleged persecutors is a component of the broader persecution\ninquiry. Thus, we must review the BIA’s finding that Fiadjoe\nfailed to show that the government of Ghana was unable or\nunwilling to control her father’s abuse in order to determine if\nthat finding is supported by substantial evidence.\n\n       In Dia v. Ashcroft, 353 F.3d 228 (3d Cir. 2003) (en\nbanc), we elaborated on the nature of substantial evidence\nreview of an asylum claim:\n\n       Thus, the question whether an agency\n       determination is supported by substantial\n       evidence is the same as the question whether a\n       reasonable fact finder could make such a\n       determination based upon the administrative\n       record. If a reasonable fact finder could make a\n       particular finding on the administrative record,\n       then the finding is supported by substantial\n       evidence. Conversely, if no reasonable fact finder\n       could make that finding on the administrative\n       record, the finding is not supported by substantial\n       evidence.\n\n\n\n\n                               63\n\fDia, 353 F.3d at 249. We emphasized that our deference to the\nagency’s findings is conditioned upon support in the record, and\nwe indicated that if the agency’s conclusion “is not based on a\nspecific, cogent reason, but instead, is based on speculation,\nconjecture, or an otherwise unsupported personal opinion, we\nwill not uphold it because it will not have been supported by\nsuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind would find\nadequate. In other words, it will not have been supported by\nsubstantial evidence.” Id. at 249-50.\n\n       The law requires applicants such as Ms. Fiadjoe to bear\nthe burden of proof of establishing her eligibility for asylum.\nSee Gao, 299 F.3d at 272; Abdille v. Ashcroft, 242 F.3d 477, 482\n(3d Cir. 2001). The BIA found that Ms. Fiadjoe failed to carry\nthis burden with respect to a critical element of her claim,\nnamely, that she had experienced persecution by forces the\ngovernment of Ghana was either unwilling or unable to control.\n\n        Our task in reviewing the BIA’s finding is not to\ndetermine whether we would have reached the same conclusion\nin the first instance. To the contrary, “the substantial evidence\nstandard of review is extremely deferential, setting a ‘high\nhurdle by permitting the reversal of factual findings only when\nthe record evidence would ‘compel’ a reasonable factfinder to\nmake a contrary determination.’” Chen v. Ashcroft, 376 F.3d\n215, 223 (3d Cir. 2004). We have further explained that for a\npetitioner to prevail on a challenge to the BIA’s factual findings\nunder the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”), “the\n\n                               64\n\fevidence [on the issue in question] must be so strong in [the\npetitioner’s] favor that in a civil trial [the petitioner] would be\nentitled to judgment on the . . . issue as a matter of law.” See\nChen, 376 F.3d at 222 (citing INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S.\n478, 481 n.1 (1992)).\n\n       Under this standard, I believe that the majority has failed\nto accord proper deference to the BIA’s findings on the issue of\ngovernment protection in Ghana. In concluding that Fiadjoe had\nnot met her burden of proof, the BIA stated:\n\n       The respondent never sought the help of the\n       authorities in Ghana. The respondent claimed\n       that her grandmother told the police of the\n       respondent’s being beaten but that she declined to\n       tell the authorities about the ritual sexual abuse\n       due to shame. The respondent submitted evidence\n       that the government of Ghana outlawed Trokosi\n       practice and ritual bondage in 1998 and that a\n       non-governmental organization has had success in\n       liberating, counseling, and rehabilitating past\n       victims of such bondage.           Therefore, the\n       respondent has not shown that the government of\n       Ghana would be unwilling or unable to protect\n       her.\n\n\n\n\nAR 74. The majority disagrees with the BIA’s conclusions, but\n\n\n                                65\n\fin so doing it fails adequately to address the record evidence\nsupporting the BIA’s findings and places disproportionate\nemphasis on anecdotal statements culled from various portions\nof the record.\n\n        The majority quotes the description of Trokosi practices\ncontained in the State Department’s 2000 Country Report on\nHuman Rights Practices in Ghana, which was also part of the\nrecord before the BIA. The paragraph immediately following\nthe excerpt quoted by the majority details Ghana’s anti-Trokosi\nefforts:\n\n       In 1998 Parliament passed legislation that banned\n       the practice of Trokosi in comprehensive\n       legislation to protect women and children’s rights.\n       Human rights activists believe that the goal of\n       eradicating the Trokosi practice is achievable with\n       the new law. NGO’s such as International Needs,\n       and government agencies like the CHRAJ, have\n       been campaigning against Trokosi for several\n       years and are familiar with the locations of the\n       fetish shrines and the numbers of women and\n       children enslaved. Activists know the community\n       leaders and fetish priests and, thus, know with\n       whom to negotiate.           The CHRAJ and\n       International Needs have had some success in\n       approaching village authorities and fetish priests\n       at over 316 of the major and minor shrines,\n       winning the release of 2,800 Trokosi slaves to\n\n\n                               66\n\f       date and retraining them for new professions. The\n       organizations continue to work for additional\n       releases. The Government has not prosecuted any\n       practitioners of Trokosi and in August 1999, a\n       presidential aide criticized anti-Trokosi activists\n       for being insensitive to indigenous cultural and\n       “religious” beliefs and practices. A local group,\n       calling itself the “Troxovi Institutional Council”\n       (Troxovi is an alternate spelling for Trokosi)\n       declared that Trokosi, as defined by CHRAJ and\n       other human rights groups to be a form of ritual\n       servitude, does not exist in the country. The\n       group claimed that the practice of “Troxovi” does\n       exist but neither enslaves nor exploits anyone.\n       The Council also listed 23 ‘genuine Troxovi\n       shrines’ in Ghana, describing them as educational\n       institutions and as part of the “Afrikania religion.”\n       These claims were widely refuted by chiefs, the\n       press, and NGOs.\n\nAR:343-44.\n\n        In light of this discussion, it is unclear to me how the\nmajority can hold that no reasonable factfinder could conclude\nthat the government of Ghana would be willing and able to help\nFiadjoe. The fact that the Parliament passed comprehensive\nlegislation to protect women and children’s rights, and that the\npractice of Trokosi was banned pursuant to this legislation,\ncertainly provides evidence that the Ghanaian authorities\nrecognized the existence and nature of Trokosi and were willing\n\n                                67\n\fto take steps to combat it. The report’s statement that “human\nrights organizations believe that the goal of eradicating Trokosi\nis achievable with the new law” also provides support for the\nBIA’s conclusion that invoking the aid of Ghanaian authorities\nwould not have been futile. There is no basis in the record to\nbelieve that these human rights organizations were offering\nanything less than an honest assessment of the situation, and if\nas of 2000 they reasonably believed Trokosi could be eradicated,\nthen it is not for this Court to suggest that the BIA acted\nunreasonably in giving weight to their views.\n\n        The State Department report also recounts empirical\nevidence in support of the view that the Ghanaian government’s\nanti-Trokosi efforts were having significant success.\nSpecifically, Ghana’s Commission for Human Rights and\nAdministrative Justice (“CHRAJ”), working with an NGO, had\nsecured the release of approximately 2,800 Trokosi slaves and\nretrained them for new professions. According to the State\nDepartment report, the CHRAJ is an autonomous government\ncommission established pursuant to the Ghanaian constitution.\nThus, contrary to the implications of the majority opinion, the\nState Department report indicates that Ghana’s anti-Trokosi\nefforts were being implemented by a government agency acting\nin partnership with various NGOs. According to that report, this\ncollaborative effort relied heavily upon negotiation rather than\ndirect confrontation as a means of aiding the victims of Trokosi\npractices. By ignoring the CHRAJ initiative, the majority\ndismisses the BIA’s findings concerning Ghana’s anti-Trokosi\n\n                               68\n\fefforts, and wrongly equates the absence of criminal prosecution\nwith an absence of effective aid for women threatened by\nTrokosi practices.\n\n        The majority also challenges the significance of the State\nDepartment’s description of Ghana’s anti-Trokosi efforts by\nquoting a portion of the report that addresses in a more general\nsense the problem of violence against women in Ghana.\nHowever, the concluding sentences of the paragraph quoted by\nthe majority provide further support for the BIA’s conclusion\nthat Fiadjoe had not shown that the government of Ghana was\nunwilling or unable to protect her. The report states that 1998\nlegislation doubled the mandatory sentence for rape, and that in\nlate 1998\n\n       the police administration established a ‘women\n       and juvenile unit’ to handle cases involving\n       domestic violence, child abuse, and juvenile\n       offenses. Located in Accra and Kumasi, the unit\n       works closely with the Department of Social\n       Welfare, FIDA, and the Legal Aid Board. During\n       the year, the Accra Branch of this unit recorded\n       over 530 cases, including 181 defilement cases,\n       35 rapes, 6 cases of incest, 17 indecent assualts,\n       86 instances of assault and wife battery, 6\n       abductions, and 200 neglect cases.\n\n\n\n\n                               69\n\fAR:341-42. The majority does not recite this evidence,\nalthough it was part of the record before the BIA. It reinforces\nmy view that under the deferential substantial evidence standard,\nthe record as a whole contains adequate support for the BIA’s\nfindings concerning the issue of government protection in\nGhana.10\n\n        The majority also argues that Fiadjoe’s own testimony\nshows that the government of Ghana would have been unwilling\nor unable to help Fiadjoe. I do not believe Fiadjoe’s testimony\nconcerning her grandmother can bear the weight the majority\nplaces upon it. Fiadjoe’s affidavit and testimony are vague\nconcerning what Fiadjoe’s grandmother told the police, and the\ndetails that were allegedly provided could have left the police\nbelieving that Fiadjoe’s situation involved a family dispute\nconcerning excessive corporal punishment.\n\n       Fiajdoe’s hearing testimony regarding this issue consists\n\n\n       10\n          In assessing the BIA’s findings, the majority chastises the\nBIA for failing to address a June 1996 London newspaper article\nentitled “Slave of the Fetish.” This article was submitted by Fiadjoe’s\ncounsel during the proceedings below, and was part of the\nadministrative record before the BIA. However, this article predates\nby several years Ghana’s anti-Trokosi efforts described in the 2000\nState Department report discussed above, and it consists primarily of\nambiguous statements that shed little light on whether Fiadjoe had\nmet her burden of showing that the Ghanaian authorities were\nunwilling or unable to protect her.\n\n                                  70\n\fof the following exchange:\n\n      Q.     Okay, did you ever try to go to the police yourself\n             to tell them what was happening to you?\n\n      A.     No.\n\n      Q.     Why not?\n\n      A.     Because of how          they   were    telling   my\n             grandmother.\n\n      Judge to Ms. Fiadjoe\n\n      Q.     Because of what, ma’am?\n\n      A.     Because they always tell my grandmother that\n             he’s discipline and my grandmother, I full of\n             shame to tell anybody my father is sleeping with\n             me.\n\nAR:251. Fiadjoe’s affidavit submitted in support of her asylum\napplication contains slightly more detail:\n\n      14.    My grandmother told the police about these\n             beatings. My grandmother told me the police\n             only said that ‘your father is just trying to\n             discipline you.’\n\n      15.    In 1997 my grandmother went to the police after\n             my father had poured boiling water on me when\n             I refused to take his abuse. Again, the police said\n             this was a father’s right to discipline his children.\n\n\n                              71\n\f       16.    My [grand]mother did not tell the police that my\n              father was sexually abusing me. It would shame\n              our family and she could not do that.\n\nAR:317-18.\n\n        In my view, particularly in light of the record evidence of\nGhana’s anti-Trokosi efforts, the limited information contained\nin Fiadjoe’s affidavit and hearing testimony cannot reasonably\nbe relied upon as determinative of what the Ghanaian authorities\nwould have done had they been informed of Fiadjoe’s father’s\nTrokosi-related abuse. The majority acknowledges that the\nGhanaian authorities were never informed of “the sexual aspect\nof the abuse,” but fails to acknowledge the significance of this\nfact. The most that can be extracted from Fiadjoe’s affidavit\nand testimony is that the local police failed to investigate when\nher grandmother twice told them that Fiadjoe was being\nphysically abused by her father. However, Fiadjoe has not\nsought asylum simply because she was a victim of child abuse.\nFiadjoe’s brief, consistent with the requirements of the INA,\nargues that she was persecuted “on account of” her membership\nin a particular social group, which she defines as “Ghanaian\nwomen from the Ewe tribe in the Volta Region who have been\nsubjected to or face being subjected to the practice of Trokosi\nand who oppose this practice.” See 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A).\nThus, it is specifically the sexual aspect of her father’s abuse,\ncombined with its ostensibly “religious” motivation, that has\npermitted Fiadjoe to seek asylum as one who has suffered\npersecution “on account of” a protected ground. It seems\nanomalous to hold, as the majority does, that Fiadjoe’s native\ngovernment would not protect her from persecution inflicted “on\naccount of” her social group, when the Ghanaian government\nwas not informed of Fiadjoe’s membership in this social group\n\n                                72\n\for of the nature and extent of the abuse that has given rise to her\nclaim for asylum.11\n\n       Notwithstanding any shortcomings in Fiadjoe’s\ntestimony, I am willing to assume arguendo that a reasonable\nfactfinder could rely on this testimony to conclude that Ms.\nFiadjoe had shown that the government of Ghana was unwilling\nor unable to protect her. The majority, however, holds that a\nreasonable factfinder would be compelled to take this approach.\nBased on all of the record evidence discussed above, I simply\ncannot agree, and thus I believe it is inappropriate to invoke\nFiadjoe’s testimony as the basis for displacing the BIA’s\njudgment with our own.12\n\n       Ms. Fiadjoe’s account rightfully evokes our sympathies,\n\n\n       11\n         I share the majority’s concern with what appears from the\ntranscript to have been the unnecessarily hostile demeanor of the IJ\nduring Ms. Fiadjoe’s hearing. However, the record as a whole\nsupports the BIA’s decision to accord limited weight to Fiadjoe’s\naccount concerning the interaction between her grandmother and the\nGhanaian police. Ms. Fiadjoe’s affidavit, prepared in advance of the\nhearing with the assistance of counsel, contains little detail\nconcerning the specific information given by her grandmother to the\nGhanaian police, and the affidavit acknowledges that the police were\nnever informed of the alleged ritual sexual abuse that is the basis of\nFiadjoe’s claim for asylum.\n       12\n         The majority also recounts Fiadjoe’s testimony concerning\nher unsuccessful efforts to relocate away from her father, and asserts\nthat “Ms. Fiadjoe’s own experiences demonstrate that where a\nTrokosi slave is involved the police will not intervene.” Maj. Op. 52.\nThis statement on its face seems to me inconsistent with the\nmajority’s own acknowledgment that the Ghanaian authorities were\nnever informed that Fiadjoe was a “Trokosi slave.”\n\n                                 73\n\fand I would be less concerned with the majority’s approach if\nwe had the luxury of deciding each case based solely on our own\nassessment of the facts underlying a petitioner’s claim.\nHowever, that is not an approach we are permitted to take as an\nappellate court reviewing agency action, and I am concerned by\nthe implications of the majority’s approach for future\nimmigration appeals. Our Court has little precedential authority\nevaluating asylum claims based upon alleged private persecution\nthat a foreign government is purportedly unwilling or unable to\ncontrol. I fear the majority’s approach sets us down the wrong\npath for reviewing these difficult issues. By emphasizing only\nwhat it finds in the record to cast doubt on the effectiveness of\nGhana’s anti-Trokosi efforts, the majority overlooks or\ndiscounts the record evidence to the contrary. This approach\nrisks a deluge of claims from applicants who have faced private\nviolence and who can argue that a lack of resources constrains\nthe effectiveness of law enforcement efforts in their native\ncountries. It also raises the troubling specter of frequent judicial\npronouncements condemning the law enforcement practices of\nforeign governments, an outcome our highly deferential standard\nof review is designed to avoid.\n\n       In my view, the majority’s approach is effectively one of\nde novo review. The law forbids us from substituting our\njudgment for that of the BIA, and it provides no exception for\ncases where the BIA has had to address whether a foreign\ngovernment would be willing and able to protect one of its own\ncitizens.\n\n       I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                                 74\n\f75\n\f",

With the exception of an eleven\nyear interval, from 1978, when Ms. Fiadjoe was seven years\nof age, until her flight from her native Ghana to the United\nStates in March 2000, Ms. Fiadjoe was held as a slave of her\nfather, a priest of the Trokosi sect, who, in accordance with\nthe tenets of the sect, forced his daughter to work for him and\nabused her physically and sexually. Ms. Fiadjoe sought\nasylum and other relief on the ground that if she were\nreturned to Ghana she, as one of the women subject to the\npractices of the Trokosi sect, would likely once again become\nsubject to her father’s bondage and abuse, a consequence that\nGhanian government authorities were unable or unwilling to\nprevent.\n        Both the Immigration Judge (“IJ”) and the BIA found\nthat Ms. Fiadjoe’s testimony was not credible, and the BIA\nfound that Ms. Fiadjoe failed to establish that the government\nof Ghana was either unwilling or unable to control her\nfather’s sexual abuse. We conclude that these findings are not\nsupported by reasonable, substantial and probative evidence\non the record considered as a whole. We will grant the\npetition and remand the case for a new hearing and\ndevelopment of the record before a different IJ.\n\n                 I. Procedural Background\n\n\n                              3\n\f       On March 11, 2000, using a passport bearing the name\nof another person, petitioner, Lorraine Fiadjoe, entered the\nUnited States. She is a member of the Ewe tribe and a native\nand citizen of Ghana. She was detained as an arriving alien\nand interviewed. Upon her refusal to be sent back to Ghana,\nthe immigration authorities transferred her to the York County\n[Pennsylvania] Prison.\n       On March 30 Asylum Officer James L. Reaves\nconducted an Asylum Pre-Screening Interview of Ms.\nFiadjoe, after which he found that she had established a\nsignificant possibility of a claim for asylum based on her\nmembership in a particular social group (unmarried women\nover 25 in Ghana). He also found that Ms. Fiadjoe had\nestablished a credible fear of persecution or torture.\n       On the same day the Immigration and Naturalization\nService (“INS”)1 charged Ms. Fiadjoe with removeability\nunder §§212(a)(6)(C)(i) and 212 (a)(7)(A)(i)(I) of the INA, 8\nU.S.C. §§1182(a)(6)(C)(i), (a)(7)(A)(i)(I) (2003) and issued a\nnotice to appear. At a June 1, 2000 hearing before an IJ Ms.\nFiadjoe conceded that she was removable under\n§212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I) of the INA for being an intending\nimmigrant not in possession of a valid visa or other entry\ndocument.\n       Ms. Fiadjoe filed applications for asylum, withholding\nof removal, and protection under the Convention Against\nTorture, Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture and\nOther Forms of Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or\nPunishment, G.A. Res. 39/46, Annex 39 U.N. GAOR Supp.\nNo. 51, at 197, U.N. Doc. A/39/51 (1984) (“CAT”). The IJ,\nDonald Vincent Ferlise, held an evidentiary hearing on April\n\n\n       1\n           The enforcement functions of the INS have since been\ntransferred to the Department of Homeland Security, pursuant to §441\nof the Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-296, 116 Stat.\n2135 (Nov. 25, 2002).\n\n                                 4\n\f30, 2002, after which he denied Ms. Fiadjoe’s application for\nrelief and ordered her removed to Ghana.\n        Ms. Fiadjoe filed a timely appeal with the BIA. On\nJune 6, 2003 the BIA dismissed the appeal. Ms. Fiadjoe filed\na timely petition for review of the BIA’s decision in this court\nand subsequently filed a motion with the BIA seeking\nreconsideration of the BIA’s June 6 order. On February 18,\n2004 the BIA denied the motion to reconsider. Ms. Fiadjoe\nfiled a petition for review of the BIA’s February 18 decision.\nThat petition has been consolidated with the first petition.\n\n                  II. Petitioner’s Evidence\n\n        Ms. Fiadjoe’s claims for relief stem from her assertion\nthat from age seven until she fled from Ghana, with an eleven\nyear interval from 1978 until 1989, her father held her as a\nslave, subject to physical beatings and frequent rape, pursuant\nto the tenets of the Trokosi religion, of which her father was a\npriest.\n        The nature and existence of the Trokosi practices are\ndescribed in a number of documents that are in the record.\nThe United States Department of State Country Report on\nHuman Rights Practices in Ghana released in February 2001\n(the “State Department Report” or the “Report”) is one\nexample. In a summary statement the Report states,\n“Violence against women is a serious problem. Traditional\npractices, including a localized form of ritual servitude\n(Trokosi) practiced in some rural areas, still result in\nconsiderable abuse and discrimination against women and\nchildren.” The Report further noted that “[v]iolence against\nwomen, including rape and domestic violence, remains a\nsignificant problem. A 1998 study revealed that particularly\nin low-income, high-density sections of greater Accra, at least\n54 percent of women have been assaulted in recent years,”\nand that “[w]omen, especially in rural areas, remain subject to\nburdensome labor conditions and traditional male\n\n                               5\n\fdominance.”\n      The State Department Report described in some detail\nTrokosi practices:\n              Although the Constitution prohibits slavery, it\n              exists on a limited scale. Trokosi, a traditional\n              practice found among the Ewe ethnic group and\n              in part of the Volta Region, is an especially\n              severe human rights abuse and an extremely\n              serious violation of children’s and women’s\n              rights. It is a system in which a young girl,\n              sometimes under the age of 10, is made a slave\n              to a fetish shrine for offenses allegedly\n              committed by a member of the girl’s family. In\n              rare instances, boys are offered. The belief is\n              that, if someone in that family has committed a\n              crime, such as stealing, members of the family\n              may begin to die in large numbers unless a\n              young girl is given to the local fetish shrine to\n              atone for the offense. The girl becomes the\n              property of the fetish priest, must work on the\n              priest’s farm, and perform other labors for him.\n              Because they are the sexual property of the\n              priests, most Trokosi slaves have children by\n              the priests. Although the girls’ families must\n              provide for their needs such as food, most are\n              unable to do so. There are at least 2,200 girls\n              and women bound to various shrines in the\n              Trokosi system, a figure that does not include\n              the slaves’ children. Even when freed by her\n              fetish priest from the more onerous aspects of\n              her bondage, whether voluntarily or as a result\n              of intervention by activists, a Trokosi women\n              generally has few marketable skills and little\n              hope of marriage and typically remains bound to\n              the shrine for life by psychological and social\n              pressure arising from a traditional belief that\n\n                               6\n\f              misfortune may befall a Trokosi woman’s\n              family or village if she abandons her obligations\n              to the shrine. When a fetish slave dies, her\n              family is expected to replace her with another\n              young girl, thus perpetuating the bondage to the\n              fetish shrine from generation to generation.\n\n        In 1998 Ghana’s Parliament passed legislation that,\namong other provisions designed to protect women, banned\nthe practice of “customary servitude” (known as Trokosi).\nAfter passage of this legislation, the Report states, “[t]he\nCHRAJ and International Needs have had some success in\napproaching village authorities and fetish priests at over 316\nof the major and minor shrines, winning the release of 2,800\nTrokosi slaves to date and retraining them for new\nprofessions.” However, as of the time of the report (2000),\n“[t]here are at least 2,200 girls and women bound to various\nshrines in the Trokosi system, a figure that does not include\nthe slaves’ children.”\n        Despite the 1998 legislation, as of the year 2000, “[t]he\nGovernment has not prosecuted any practitioners of Trokosi,\nand in August 1999, a presidential aide criticized anti-Trokosi\nactivists for being insensitive to indigenous cultural and\n‘religious’ practices.” The Statement Department Report\nrecites at great length the terrible abuses committed by\nGhana’s police, noting that “[i]n recent years, the police\nservice in particular has come under severe criticism\nfollowing incidents of police brutality, corruption, and\nnegligence.” With respect to the police and their reaction to\nviolence against women, the Report recites “[v]iolence\nagainst women, including rape and domestic violence,\nremains a significant problem . . . a total of 95 percent of the\nvictims of domestic violence are women, according to data\ngathered by the FIDA. These abuses generally go unreported\nand seldom come before the courts. The police tend not to\nintervene in domestic disputes.”\n\n                                7\n\f        It is against this well-documented background that Ms.\nFiadjoe’s account of her own experiences unfolds. These\nevents are described in her affidavit in support of her asylum\napplication (Form I-589) and in her April 30, 2002 hearing\ntestimony. They are described in the report of the\npsychologist who treated her for the trauma these events\ncaused.\n        Ms. Fiadjoe was born a member of the Ewe tribe on\nMarch 17, 1971 in Accra, Ghana. When she was a young\nchild her parents separated. She was too young at that time to\nremember her parents living together. Her mother remarried\nand remained in Accra. Her father, a farmer, also remarried\nand lived in a village called Veku outside of Anloga, a remote\narea of rural Ghana. Ms. Fiadjoe was sent to live with her\nfather.\n        The father was a Trokosi priest, maintaining a shrine in\nhis home where he and other members of the Trokosi cult\nconducted Trokosi rituals. In 1978 when Ms. Fiadjoe was\nseven years of age, her father, pursuant to Trokosi practices,\nsought to make her his slave, working for him and the shrine\nand submitting to him sexually. During an approximately\nthree months period the father sexually abused Ms. Fiadjoe as\npart of the Trokosi tenets. Fortunately for Ms. Fiadjoe, her\nfather’s sister, Aunt Dela, objected to this abuse and took Ms.\nFiadjoe to live with her family in Accra. There Ms. Fiadjoe\nno longer saw her father and was able to attend school and\nlive the life of an independent young woman. She was a\nChristian, of the Baptist persuasion.\n        Sadly, in 1989 Aunt Dela was killed in an automobile\naccident. Her husband remarried and directed Ms. Fiadjoe to\nleave his house. She had nowhere else to go except to return\nto her father in Veku. There she once again became her\nfather’s slave subject to beatings and rape. Approximately a\nyear after her return she described to her grandmother the\ntorments to which she was being subjected. The grandmother\nreported the beatings to the police but did not mention the\n\n                               8\n\frapes because of the disgrace that such a revelation would\nbring upon the family. The police refused to intervene on the\nground that only a domestic dispute was involved.\n        Ms. Fiadjoe attempted to escape from these conditions.\nShe went to work selling fish in order to accumulate some\nmoney. When she had saved enough she moved out of her\nfather’s house and rented a room of her own. However, after\nreturning to her room one evening her landlord returned her\nrent and told her she could not stay. He had been threatened\nby her father. Ms. Fiadjoe sought to escape through marriage\nand dated two men of her village, first Titi and then Agol,\neach of whom wanted to marry her. Her father would not\nallow a marriage and scared off each of these men.\n        In 1996 Ms. Fiadjoe met a Muslim man, Ahmed\nKublano who lived with his parents in Anloga. His brother\nRasheed lived nearby. Ms. Fiadjoe and Ahmed fell in love\nand wanted to marry. In order to persuade the father to\nconsent Ahmed brought him gifts, but he could not bring his\nfamily because they were Muslims and opposed the marriage.\nMs. Fiadjoe had informed Ahmed about the beatings but had\nnot told him that her father periodically raped her. Ahmed\npersuaded her to leave her home and go with him to stay with\nhis cousin in Nigeria.\n        The two fled to Nigeria and stayed with the cousin.\nThey stayed there a week, but the cousin started to approach\nMs. Fiadjoe sexually and they had to leave. Having no money\nit was necessary that they return to Ghana. Ms. Fiadjoe had\nno place to go other than her father’s house. As she explained\nat her asylum hearing, she had to go back “because we [she\nand Ahmed] are not married and in Ghana before you can be\nfree from your father, your father have to accept your\nmarriage.”\n        The father resumed beating Ms. Fiadjoe and poured\nboiling water over her because she had disobeyed him. The\nsexual abuse continued. She and Ahmed continued to see\neach other and still wanted to marry. It was a star-crossed\n\n                              9\n\frelationship. As Ms. Fiadjoe stated in her affidavit: “My\nfather hated Ahmed because he did not want me to be with\nanyone but him, and because Ahmed was a Muslim. My\nfather was opposed to the marriage and he said that I can’t\nmarry Ahmed because I am a Christian. Ahmed’s family did\nnot approve of me and did not want us to marry because I am\na Christian.”\n        Ms. Fiadjoe became pregnant by Ahmed and hoped\nthat this would persuade her father to agree to her marriage.\nWhen she told her father of her pregnancy he beat her until\nshe miscarried. Ahmed continued to visit Ms. Fiadjoe. He\ndid so on March 5, 2000, waiting in her bedroom before they\nwent out together. Ms. Fiadjoe testified that at that point “I\nwent to the shower to take a bath and then, when I came back,\nwhen I was coming out, I saw my father coming out of my\nroom, but I knew Ahmed was in the room, so when I went\nthere Ahmed was lying in blood . . . I hold [his] hand and he\ndidn’t talk to me, he was just lying in the blood and he didn’t\ndo anything, so to me I was thinking he’s dead.”\n        Ms. Fiadjoe started shouting and her father told her\nthat if she didn’t shut up he would kill her. She took the\nmoney she had saved and left the house. She proceeded to\nAhmed’s brother, Rasheed, to tell him what had happened.\nShe then went to the roadside and took a car to Accra. There\nshe went to her mother’s house and told her what had\nhappened. The mother did not want Ms. Fiadjoe to stay with\nher because she knew the father was dangerous. Ms. Fiadjoe\nthen sought refuge with her Aunt Dela’s husband, who did not\neven want her to sit down, or enter the house because he was\nafraid of the father.\n        Next Ms. Fiadjoe went to a person she had known for\nmany years named Alfred who, for fear that the father would\nsuspect that Ms. Fiadjoe was with him, took her to his\ngirlfriend’s house. As Ms. Fiadjoe testified: “When he took\nme to his girlfriend’s house, he told me you can’t stay here\nwith this problem, you can’t stay here, so, he took me to town,\n\n                              10\n\ftook passport size picture and then he gave me some clothes, I\nstayed there for about five days, I stayed with them for about\nfive days, he gave me passport to just leave . . . The passport\nhe gave to me, I’m going to Canada, if I go to Canada, I will\nmeet somebody at the airport, they will be holding my name.”\n        Ms. Fiadjoe gave five hundred thousand Ghanian cedis\nto Alfred and received from him $130 U.S. dollars and the\npassport which bore her photograph and the name Mercy\nAppiah-Kubi. Alfred drove her to the airport on March 10,\n2000. She flew to JFK Airport in New York City, arriving on\nMarch 11. There she was taken into custody by INS officials.\n        INS officials questioned Ms. Fiadjoe that day and\ncompleted a handwritten Record of Sworn Statement in\nProceeding under Section 235(b)(1) of the Act. Her answers\nmade very little sense. In response to the question “Why did\nyou leave your home country or country of last residence?”,\nshe responded, “I want to look after my mother.” In response\nto the question “Do you have any fear or concern about being\nreturned to your home country or being removed from the\nUnited States?” she replied, “Yes. I cannot look after my\nsisters and brothers.” In response to the question “Would you\nbe harmed if you are returned to your home country or\ncountry of last residence?”, she responded “Yes . . . I can’t\nstand the responsibilities.”\n        After the INS transferred Ms. Fiadjoe to York County\nPrison, Officer Reaves administered an Asylum Pre-Screening\nInterview on March 30. Contrary to the facts as she later\nrecounted them, Ms. Fiadjoe informed Officer Reaves that her\nfather’s beatings began three years ago, that her father tried to\nhave sex with her but that she never allowed it.\n        In due course Ms. Fiadjoe was released from detention\nand took up residence at International Friendship House. She\nhad great difficulty adjusting to her environment and\nneighborhood. Her then attorney referred her to Kathleen M.\nJansen, M.S., C.T.S., a psychologist and adult therapist\nassociated with the Victim Assistance Center of York,\n\n                               11\n\fPennsylvania, who first saw Ms. Fiadjoe on May 5, 2000. At\nthe outset Ms. Jansen found that Ms. Fiadjoe was withdrawn\nand highly anxious, made almost no eye contact, kept her\nhead down, spoke very softly and frequently dissociated 2 .\n        Ms. Jansen’s recital of the events of Ms. Fiadjoe’s\nprior life coincided virtually identically with events as later\ndescribed in Ms. Fiadjoe’s asylum affidavit, which she\nexecuted on July 5, 2001, and her April 2, 2002 testimony. In\nthree respects Ms. Jansen’s report became a basis of the IJ’s\nand the BIA’s credibility determinations. First, it is apparent\nthat she had no understanding of the Trokosi sect and its\nrelationship to the torments to which Ms. Fiadjoe was\nsubjected. In this regard Ms. Jansen wrote, “Ms. Fiadjoe\ndescribes her father as having a religious ‘fetish’ which I have\ncome to believe refers to what we would call an addiction.”\nSecond, referring to Ahmed, Ms. Jansen wrote, “[h]e was\naware of the sexual assaults by her father, but was powerless\nto stop them.” Third, she described the death of Ahmed as if\nhe had been shot, writing: “On the night before she left her\nfather’s home for the last time, she reports being in the\n‘shower room’ when she heard noises. When she emerged,\nshe found her boyfriend lying shot on the floor. He was still\nalive when she reached him, and died in her arms.” (emphasis\nadded).\n        Ms. Jansen described Ms. Fiadjoe’s emotional status:\n               Work with Ms. Fiadjoe has been complicated by\n               the long history of multiple traumas and the\n               underlying fear of being returned home. As\n\n        2\n          In psychology “dissociation” is “a defense mechanism in\nwhich a group of mental processes are segregated from the rest of a\nperson’s mental activity in order to avoid emotional distress, as in the\ndissociative disorder (q.v.), or in which an idea or object is segregated\nfrom its emotional significance, in the first sense it is roughly\nequivalent to splitting, in the second, to isolation.” Borland’s Medical\nDictionary, 27th Edition (1988).\n\n                                   12\n\f              with many incest survivors, she has learned to\n              endure trauma by dissociating, emotionally\n              removing herself from her surroundings until\n              the pain has subsided.\n\n                               …\n\n              Each time I met with Ms. Fiadjoe, I see\n              dramatic improvements. She has established\n              eating and sleeping habits that are within\n              normal limits. Her communication abilities\n              have improved, although she continues to\n              occasionally dissociate when discussing\n              emotionally painful events. She is able to\n              maintain reasonable eye contact and has a\n              significantly greater range of affect. She is able\n              to discuss many more difficult subjects without\n              dissociating or breaking down. She remains\n              extremely fearful of her father finding out\n              where she is and of being sent back to Ghana\n              and forced to return to his home.\n\n       Ms. Jansen’s report thus described Ms. Fiadjoe’s\n\nsomewhat fragile emotional state as she proceeded towards\n\nher asylum hearing continuing “to occasionally dissociate\n\nwhen discussing emotionally painful events.”\n\n   III. April 30, 2002 Hearing and Initial Oral Decision\n\n       Ms. Fiadjoe’s asylum hearing on April 30, 2002 posed\n\na challenge to her ability to discuss the difficult subjects of\n\n\n                                13\n\frape and incest without dissociating or breaking down. Her\n\nattorney, Mr. Piver, commenced by questioning her about her\n\nearly years, her religion, Trokosi practices and the start of her\n\nfather’s sexual abuse when she was seven.\n\n       While Ms. Fiadjoe testified about the initial sexual\n\nabuse at age seven, the cessation of the abuse while she was\n\nin Accra with her Aunt Dela and its resumption eleven years\n\nlater, the IJ, Donald V. Ferlise, appeared unable to\n\ncomprehend this sequence of events and the following\n\ninterchange between him and the witness took place:\n\n              Q:      Well, how long, how long did this go on,\n                      that you were being raped and beaten?\n\nJUDGE TO MR. PYVER (sic)\n\n              Q:      What?\n\n              A:      We’re getting to that?\n\n              Q:      Well, I’m getting to it now.\n\nJUDGE TO MS. FIADJOE\n\n              Q:      How did this go on?\n\n              A:      It, when I left to Accra it stopped, but\n\n                               14\n\f     when I came back to my father again\n     then, at the age of 18 it continued from\n     there.\n\nQ:   All right, (indiscernible) at age seven, did\n     your father beat or rape you at age\n     seven?\n\nA:   Yes.\n\nQ:   For how long of period of time did that\n\n     go on?\n\nA:   For, til I was seven, I know my father\n\n     was raping me.\n\nQ:   Ma’am, you’re not making any - -\n\nA:   - - For it went - -\n\nQ:   - - Ma’am, you, you can cry, that’s fine,\n     but your not making any sense, and the\n     tears do not do away with the fact that\n     your not making any sense to me. Now,\n     rather than crying, just answer the\n     question. You said, your father raped\n     you at age seven and he would beat you,\n     correct?\n\nA:   Yes, but I didn’t tell anybody.\n\nQ:   I don’t care if you did or not. At age\n     seven, how long did this go on that he\n     was raping you and beating you?\n\n               15\n\f              A:     In fact, he was doing that to me when I\n                     cried to my auntie, I want to - -\n\n              Q:     - - Ma’am, I don’t like it when someone\n                     beats around the bush, okay, when they\n                     don’t answer me. Another thing I don’t\n                     like is when somebody makes sounds as\n                     if their crying and their eyes stay dry, all\n                     right. It’s a form of histrionics, stage\n                     (indiscernible), I don’t like that. I want\n                     straight answers and I want straight\n                     answers right now. You said, your father\n                     beat you and raped you at age seven, how\n                     long did that go on while you were age\n                     seven?\n\n              A:     In fact, it went until age seven and I left.\n\n        Although it had been established that Ms. Fiadjoe had\nbeen born in 1971, that her father’s sexual molestation began\nwhen she was seven in 1978, that she left for Aunt Dela’s\nhome that year and returned to her father eleven years later\nwhen Aunt Dela died, the IJ hounded Ms. Fiadjoe because\nafter the IJ’s previous brow beating she could not testify as to\nthe year when she returned to her father.

And they\n                     (indiscernible) in there particular days\n                     and they (indiscernible), they go there to\n                     perform rituals.\n\n              Q:     So, it’s because there’s idols outside the\n                     room, you think there’s idols inside the\n                     room, although you’ve never seen them?\n\n              A:     Yes, because they prepare food and a lot\n                     of them outside, they take into the room.\n\n       The IJ pursued with extreme insensitivity a subject that\n\nmust have been particularly painful to Ms. Fiadjoe - the\n\nmurder of Ahmed:\n\nJUDGE TO MS. FIADJOE:\n\n              Q:     You told me, that you never told Ahmed,\n\n                              19\n\f     that your father had sexually assaulted\n     you, but apparently, you told Ms. Jansen,\n     that you told Ahmed about the sexual\n     assaults, why is that?\n\nA:   In fact, I told, Ms. Jansen, that I let\n     Ahmed know that abuse, but I didn’t\n     clarify it today.\nQ:   Well, she’s stating here, that Ahmed was\n     aware of the sexual assaults by your\n     father, that’s pretty clear to me.\n\nA:   But, I did not tell her about the assault,\n     the beatings and all, I didn’t clarify it to,\n     Ms. Jansen.\n\nQ:   Well, is she, she a fortune teller, she can\n     read your mind without you telling her,\n     it’s clear here, she says that Ahmed was\n     aware of the sexual assaults by your\n     father, so, you must have told her. That’s\n     not what you told me today though, why\n     is that, why is there a difference between\n     what, Ms. Jansen, writes in her letter and\n     what you’ve told me?\n\nA:   Because, Ms. Jansen, is the one who let\n     me know it’s okay to tell, but I did not\n     explain that, I did not tell this part and\n     this part, I just say, abuse and say\n     (indiscernible), I did explain, clarify that\n     to her, but she let me know that it’s okay\n     to tell somebody so that you can, I can\n     feel okay, I can be healed (indiscernible).\n\nQ:   Yes, but your double talking me, it says\n\n               20\n\f                    that, just answer my question, the letter\n                    from Ms. Jansen says, that Ahmed knew\n                    about the sexual assaults by your father,\n                    you told me that Ahmed did not know, so\n                    tell me why Ms. Jansen’s telling me one\n                    thing, and why you’re telling me\n                    something else?\n\n             A:     (No audible response).\n\n             Q:     I’m waiting for your answer.\n\n             A:     Please, I don’t know, I don’t have answer\n                    for that.\n\n        The concluding portions of the hearing further\ndemonstrated the IJ’s continuing hostility towards the\nobviously distraught Ms. Fiadjoe and his abusive treatment of\nher throughout the hearing. He had succeeded in returning\nher to the condition which Ms. Jansen had enabled her to\novercome after repeated therapy sessions, breaking down and\ndissociating.

Your testimony is contradicted\n                  by, much of it is contradicted by your\n                  own witness, Ms. Jansen, her, her the\n                  letter that she wrote, your testimony\n                  generally doesn’t make any sense. I\n                  further found, and I denied it, basically\n                  because of that, I further found that if I\n                  had found that you were credible, that\n                  you were telling me the truth, I do not\n                  find that - -\n\n                (OFF THE RECORD)\n                 (ON THE RECORD)\n\nJUDGE TO MS. FIADJOE\n\n          Q:     I don’t find that you have been\n                 persecuted and on one of the five\n                 statutory grounds. I don’t find, first of\n                 all, there are relatively few women\n                 involved in this movement, all right,\n                 sexual slaves. They number by 2,200,\n                 now you described it as, as a sexual\n\n                           22\n\f                     slave, I read from the State Department it\n                     seems there’s, there’s some sexual\n                     slavery involved with it, but it has a lot to\n                     do with idiolatry and voodoo and fears\n                     and just a lot of nonsense. I don’t find\n                     that a group of 2,200 plus or minus\n                     women would be particular social group,\n                     it’s small group and it’s only in a certain\n                     section of, of Ghana, around the\n                     (indiscernible) region. Even if I found\n                     that it was a particular social group, the\n                     government is not persecuting anyone,\n                     all right, and the government is not\n                     allowing this to continue, they passed a\n                     law in 1998 and they had, there trying to\n                     abolish Trokosi and apparently according\n                     to the State Department, they think that it\n                     will be abolished in the, in the near\n                     future. So, even if it were a particular\n                     social group, that’s these women, a small\n                     group of women, I don’t find that they’ve\n                     been persecuted pursuant to definition of\n                     persecution. And for that reason, I’ve\n                     denied your application, do you\n                     understand, now?\n\n              A:     Yes.\n\n              Q:     Okay, the answer is yes.\n\n              IV. The Sanitized Oral Decision\n\n       On the hearing date the IJ also delivered a sanitized\n\nversion of his original crude (and cruel) Oral Decision. It will\n\n\n                               23\n\fbe referred to as the “IJ Decision”.\n\n        Having found that Ms. Fiadjoe was “inadmissible for\n\npresenting a bogus passport to the Immigration authorities”\n\nand also under Section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) (fraud on an\n\nimmigration official), the IJ set forth general legal principles\n\napplicable to applications for asylum and for restriction on\n\nremoval.\n\n        Turning to the circumstances about which Ms. Fiadjoe\n\ntestified, the IJ rejected the evidence that Trokosi was a form\n\nof religion, finding that “it does not appear to the Court that\n\nthis is a religion, it is rather a cult.”\n\n        The bulk of the opinion was devoted to the reasons\n\nwhy the IJ found Ms. Fiadjoe totally incredible. As he stated\n\nin his original oral decision “I don’t believe your testimony. I\n\nthink that you were making up your testimony as you went\n\nalong.” The first reason for this finding was Ms. Fiadjoe’s\n\ninability to specify the year in which she returned to her father\n\nafter spending eleven years with Aunt Dela. The IJ wrote:\n\n\n                                   24\n\f             The respondent was asked when she returned to\n             her father and she was unable to tell the Court\n             when it occurred. If indeed this had transpired\n             in the respondent’s life and if indeed she was\n             living safely with her aunt for 11 years, it is\n             abundantly clear to the court that the respondent\n             would be able to tell me when she returned\n             home to that situation that she feared so much.\n\n        The second reason that the IJ gave for rejecting Ms.\nFiadjoe’s testimony was the inconsistency he perceived\nbetween her testimony that she had never been in the room in\nwhich her father and other participants performed rituals and\nher testimony that there were idols in that room:\n\n             The respondent’s father told her that he wanted\n             her to be a Trokosi slave, she stated that the\n             father had a room inside his house in which she\n             was not permitted to enter, in which there were\n             idols. The Court asked the respondent if she\n             had never entered that room, how she knew\n             there was idols inside; and her answer was that\n             she presumed they were idols inside the room\n             that she had never entered since they were idols\n             outside the room. This line of thought on the\n             respondent’s part is not particularly persuasive.\n\n        The IJ found reason to doubt Ms. Fiadjoe’s testimony\nin the fact that she returned to her father’s house after\nreturning with Ahmed from Nigeria:\n\n             Ahmed and the respondent in April of 1997,\n             traveled to Nigeria by bus to live with Ahmed’s\n             cousin. The cousin of Ahmed apparently made\n             sexual advances to the respondent, so that after\n             three weeks, she and Ahmed returned to Ghana\n\n                             25\n\f              and the respondent returned to her father’s\n              home. The respondent was asked why, if she\n              had been beaten and raped at her father’s home,\n              did she return there. She states that she returned\n              there since she did not want her father to be\n              angered by the fact that she was with Ahmed.\n              This absolutely is totally implausible and totally\n              nonsensical to the Court, insofar as the\n              respondent was returning to a situation where\n              she knew she was going to be raped and beaten.\n              And I don’t believe that she would have any\n              fear that her father would be angered and if she\n              did have a fear, that fear would be a lesser fear\n              than the rape and the beatings that she knew\n              awaited her. As it turned out, when the\n              respondent did return, her father not only beat\n              her but poured hot water on her as a form of\n              punishment.\n\n       The IJ relied upon perceived inconsistencies between\nMs. Fiadjoe’s testimony and her statements to Ms. Jansen as\nreflected in Ms. Jansen’s report. He found that Ms. Jansen’s\nreport cast doubt upon Ms. Fiadjoe’s testimony that her\nabusive father was part of the Trokosi sect or that she was a\nTrokosi slave:\n              The respondent submitted to the Court a\n              letter/report from Social Worker Kathleen\n              Jansen, which is found at Exhibit 6, tab 2. A\n              careful examination of Ms. Jansen’s letter\n              reflects nothing to the effect that the\n              respondent’s father was a member of the\n              Trokosi cult, nor that the respondent herself was\n              a Trokosi slave. The respondent was not able to\n              explain why what she told the Court, was not\n              told to the social worker.\n\n\n                              26\n\f        The IJ found that Ms. Fiadjoe’s testimony that she only\ntold her grandmother about her father’s sexual abuse is\ncontradicted by Ms. Jansen’s report which recites that Ms.\nFiadjoe also told her mother about the sexual abuse. The IJ\nfound contradiction of Ms. Fiadjoe’s testimony that she never\ntold Ahmed about the sexual nature of her father’s abuse in\nthe statement in Ms. Jansen’s letter that Ahmed “was aware of\nthe sexual assaults by her father, but was powerless to stop\nthem.” Further, the IJ notes an inconsistency between Ms.\nFiadjoe’s statement that she does not know how her father\nkilled Ahmed and the statement in Ms. Jansen’s report that\n“[w]hen she emerged [from the shower], she found her\nboyfriend lying shot on the floor.”\n        The IJ also based his credibility evaluation on\nstatements that Ms. Fiadjoe made to immigration officials\nwhen she was initially processed after her detention. At the\nairport she did not disclose her reason for fleeing Ghana and\n“told the Immigration Officer a rather benign reason for\ncoming here, the fact that she was not able to financially\nprovide for her siblings.” The IJ referred to the asylum pre-\nscreening interview document:\n               That document reflects on page 4, that the\n               respondent told the Immigration Officer that her\n               father started beating her three years ago. That\n               is three years ago prior to March 30 th of 2000,\n               consequently that would be March of 1997;\n               however, the respondent told the Court that she\n               was 7 years of age when the beatings began.\n               Thus, again we have a diametric difference\n               between what the respondent told this Court and\n               what the respondent told the Immigration\n               Officer during the asylum pre-screening\n               interview.\n\n              Even more interesting is the fact that, again\n              according to this interview, the respondent told\n\n                              27\n\f              the Immigration Officer that her father never\n              had sex with her. This totally undermines the\n              entire case in chief, since her entire case in chief\n              is based on her father using her as a sex slave.\n              Whenever the Court sees such a diametric\n              difference between the testimony that the\n              respondent has given to the Court and the\n              testimony that the respondent has given another\n              member of the Immigration Service, the\n              credibility of the respondent and the case in\n              chief gravely suffer.\n\n       The IJ emphasized that “[t]he credibility of the\nrespondent is of extreme importance in assessing the\nrespondent’s claim . . .. The Court concludes that the\nrespondent is making up her testimony as she is going along,\nshe’s making up these scenarios and she is fabricating her\ntestimony to the Court. . . . the Court again states for the\nrecord that this was a frivolous application and that the\nrespondent intentionally lied to this Court.”\n       The IJ provided alternative grounds for denying Ms.\nFiadjoe’s applications for relief. He quoted the State\nDepartment Report describing the Trokosi cult, including the\npractice of its priests of maintaining sex slaves at Trokosi\nshrines. The IJ then held:\n               The Court finds that being a Trokosi slave or a\n               member of the cult, is being a member of a\n               relatively small group. According to the State\n               Department, it numbers approximately 2,200\n               people in a small area, in the southeast portion\n               of Ghana. The Court will not find that a\n               Trokosi slave constitutes a particular social\n               group, insofar as it is rather a minuscule part of\n               the general population of Ghana.\n\n       Had he found Trokosi slaves to be a particular social\n\n                               28\n\fgroup, the IJ held that he “would not find that the respondent\nis being persecuted as being a member of that social group\nand does not qualify for asylum, insofar as I find that this\npractice is being stamped out by the government, according to\nthe State Department reports; and that it can be eradicated by\nthe government within a short period of time, with the\npassage of a law which occurred in 1998.”\n        A rather confusing observation followed in support of\nthe IJ’s finding that Ms. Fiadjoe had not established a well-\nfounded fear of persecution. The IJ appeared to believe that\nMs. Fiadjoe was alleging that she was being persecuted\nbecause she was a member of the Trokosi sect, when in fact\nshe was asserting that with the acquiescence of governmental\nofficials, the Trokosi sect was persecuting her, forcing her\ninto practices totally contrary to her Christian faith. The IJ\nobserved:\n               The government does not condone this slavery.\n               It is perpetuated by a rather small number of\n               people following an ideology, some type of\n               voodoo religion or voodoo following, and the\n               Court does not find that it constitutes a\n               persecution of this group of women, even if\n               these women should be classified as a particular\n               social group. The Court considers the Trokosi\n               as an isolated aberration of the small segment of\n               the society in Ghana, but I do not find that it is a\n               ground for asylum. I do not find that members\n               of that group are being persecuted for one of the\n               five statutory grounds for a grant of such relief.\n\n              Consequently, for all of these reasons, the Court\n              finds that the respondent has not established\n              well-founded fear of persecution as defined, if\n              she were returned to Ghana. Accordingly her\n              application for asylum will be denied.\n\n\n                                29\n\f       Based on the foregoing, the IJ determined i) it was\nunnecessary to consider whether Ms. Fiadjoe merited relief as\na matter of discretion; ii) because Ms. Fiadjoe failed to\nestablish eligibility for asylum, she failed to meet the higher\nstandard of proof necessary for restriction on removal to\nGhana; and iii) Ms. Fiadjoe does not qualify for relief under\nthe CAT because she did not establish that she is more likely\nthan not to be tortured if she returns to Ghana.\n       The IJ entered orders denying Ms. Fiadjoe’s request\nfor asylum, for restriction on removal to Ghana and for\nwithholding removal under the CAT. He ordered that she be\nremoved from the United States to Ghana.\n\n               V. Proceeding before the BIA\n\n        On appeal from the IJ’s decision the BIA relied heavily\nupon the IJ’s credibility determination: “In denying the\nrespondent’s applications for relief, the Immigration Judge\nfound that the respondent was not credible (IJ at 11-12). We\nagree.” The BIA advanced two grounds for its credibility\ndetermination - i) perceived inconsistences in her testimony at\nthe hearing before the IJ and ii) inconsistencies in her\nstatement at her Asylum Pre-Screening Interview.\n        With respect to Ms. Fiadjoe’s testimony, the BIA noted\nthat Ms. Fiadjoe made conflicting claims as to the age when\nher Trokosi ritual sexual abuse by her father began, referring\nto the following inconsistencies or supposed inconsistencies:\ni) in her asylum application and during her testimony Ms.\nFiadjoe claimed that her father began to abuse her sexually\nand attempted to rape her when she was seven years old; ii) in\nfurther testimony she asserted that her father had in fact raped\nher when she was seven; iii) in her statement given at her\nAsylum Pre-Screening Interview she stated that the abuse\nbegan approximately three years prior to her March 2000\ninterviews and claimed that she did not allow her father to\nhave sex with her, in contrast to later claims of on-going rape.\n\n                              30\n\fThe BIA concluded that “[b]ecause we have found that the\nrespondent’s testimony cannot be accepted as credible, it\nfollows that the respondent has failed to satisfy her burden of\nproof and persuasion.”\n        Further, the BIA held that Ms. Fiadjoe’s claims must\nbe denied for failure to establish that the government of\nGhana was either unwilling or unable to control her father’s\nritual abuse. In support of this conclusion the BIA noted i)\nMs. Fiadjoe did not seek help of the Ghanian authorities; ii)\nthe grandmother when reporting the father’s abuse to the\npolice did not mention the sexual aspect of the abuse; iii) the\ngovernment outlawed Trokosi practices and ritual bondage in\n1998 and a non-governmental organization had success in\nliberating, counseling, and rehabilitating past victims of such\nbondage.\n        The BIA found that Ms. Fiadjoe implicitly admitted\nthat she could escape her father’s abuse by moving to an\nurban area, citing as support; i) Ms. Fiadjoe’s escape when\nshe fled to Nigeria; ii) her move into an apartment; and iii) her\nunconvincing testimony about being impelled to return to the\nfather’s home after the abortive flight to Nigeria. The BIA\nconcluded “the respondent’s failure to pursue internal\nrelocation would likely be a negative discretionary factor even\nif we had found that she had suffered past persecution on\naccount of a protected ground.”\n        Because the BIA had found that Ms. Fiadjoe had not\ntestified credibly and that she had failed to demonstrate that\nthe government of Ghana would be unwilling or unable to\nprotect her, it did not reach the issue of whether bondage as a\nTrokosi slave would meet the definition of persecution on\naccount of membership in a particular social group or the\nissue whether Ms. Fiadjoe, even if credible, had established\nthat she was, in fact, a Trokosi slave.\n        Finding that Ms. Fiadjoe had failed to establish the\nlower burden of proof required for asylum, the BIA held that\nshe had failed to meet the higher standard for withholding of\n\n                               31\n\fremoval and that she had failed to establish that it was more\nlikely than not that she would be tortured upon her return to\nGhana, thus requiring that her request for relief under the\nCAT be denied.\n        With one member, Juan P. Osuna, dissenting, the BIA\ndismissed the appeal on June 6, 2003. Ms. Fiadjoe filed in\nthis court a timely petition for review of the BIA’s decision.\nMs. Fiadjoe also moved for reconsideration of the BIA’s\ndecision. One of the grounds for the motion to reconsider\nwas the failure of the BIA to consider certain evidence which\nwas not before the IJ but which Ms. Fiadjoe submitted in\nsupport of her appeal. In particular she submitted an October\n31, 2002 letter of Ms. Jansen which explained why certain of\nthe statements made in her earlier letter on which the IJ relied\nto find that Ms. Fiadjoe lacked credibility constituted Ms.\nJansen’s mistakes or misunderstanding. Ms. Jansen’s October\n31, 2002 letter also spelled out in considerable detail the\nnature and consequence of the stress from which Ms. Fiadjoe\nsuffered from her father’s abuse and the effect this stress had\nwith respect to Ms. Fiadjoe’s responses to questions\nconcerning sexual abuse matters. The following are a few of\nMs. Jansen’s observations concerning Ms. Fiadjoe’s\nemotional state:\n               It is my professional opinion that Posttraumatic\n               Stress Disorder, Ms. Fiadjoe’s own mannerisms,\n               and the Immigration Judge’s lack of awareness\n               of Ghanian culture contributed to Ms. Fiadjoe’s\n               responses to questioning by opposing counsel\n               and, in particular, to the Judge. It is\n               extraordinarily difficult for sexual abuse victims\n               to discuss specifics of their abuse experiences.\n               Given the extreme shame that surrounds these\n               issues in general they are difficult for both men\n               and women to discuss. With the addition of the\n               cultural factors surrounding Ms. Fiadjoe’s\n               experiences in particular, it should be of no\n\n                               32\n\fsurprise at all that she would be reluctant to\ndiscuss these issues with anyone, most\nspecifically with a male or in the presence of\nseveral males. It is very typical of victims of\nsexual abuse to not be able to accurately recall\ndates, ages, number of abuse occurrences and\ntime lines in general. In addition, I believe\ncultural factors played a role. In many cultures\nthe specifics of dates, time, and ages are not\nvalued as significantly as they are in western,\nindustrialized cultures. The combination of\ncultural factors and traumatic stress reactions\nwould be expected to impede one’s memory of\ndates, times and ages.\n\n                …\n\nI believe I also communicated in my initial letter\nthat because of her history of severe abuse,\nunder situations of duress she tends to\ndissociate. This means that if she feels\nthreatened or endangered - physically or\nemotionally - she will withdraw from the\nsituation, become confused, frightened, hesitant,\nand may appear to have a blank look on her\nface. This is a natural consequence of the\nPosttraumatic Stress Disorder from which she\nsuffers.\n\n                …\n\nThe Immigration Judge believed that Ms.\nFiadjoe was fabricating her account of rape by\nher father because he found inconsistencies.\nThese inconsistencies are not evidence of\n\n\n                33\n\fdishonesty in Ms. Fiadjoe’s case - they are\nevidence of severe Posttraumatic Stress\nDisorder. It is also noteworthy that at the time\nof this hearing, Ms. Fiadjoe was approximately\nseven months postpartum and, by history,\nsuffered a significant bout of Postpartum\nDepression for approximately nine months after\nthe birth of her daughter. This condition would,\nas well, affect both her memory and her\ncommunication style. Similarly it does not at all\nsurprise me that upon initial questioning by INS\nagents Ms. Fiadjoe would reference her father\nattempting sexual abuse but deny that he had\nhad intercourse with her. Fear and shame\nwould more than explain that circumstance.\nPlease note that she did disclose the sexual\nassaults to her grandmother who immediately\ntold her it was shameful for her to discuss those\nmatters. Although the grandmother was willing\nto report the physical abuse to the police, she\nrefused to report or permit Ms. Fiadjoe to report\nthe sexual violence. I can vehemently affirm\nthat once a sense of safety and a tentative\nworking relationship was established with Ms.\nFiadjoe she consistently and clearly disclosed\nmultiple incidents of violent rape by her father\nduring our counseling sessions. It is also\nimportant to note that Ms. Fiadjoe’s recounting\nof her experiences in her father’s custody never\nwavered during our work together. As an\nexpert in assessing traumatic stress, and an\nexperienced provider of services to victims of\nsexual violence I never saw any indication that\nMs. Fiadjoe was less than truthful with me or\nthat she was fabricating any of her experiences.\n\n\n                34\n\f       In addition to describing Ms. Fiadjoe’s emotional state,\nMs. Jansen took responsibility for creating what appeared to\nbe inconsistencies between statements contained in her\noriginal letter, which was in evidence before the IJ, and Ms.\nFiadjoe’s testimony. Ms. Jansen explained her failure to use\nthe term Trokosi in her report, limiting her description of the\nfather’s behavior as being a “fetish”:\n                One of the shortcomings of my work with Ms.\n                Fiadjoe falls to my lack of understanding at that\n                time about the Trokosi religion and the\n                definition of a fetish priest. She spoke often of\n                her father’s fetish practices and interpreting her\n                words and their meaning was very difficult.\n                She did state on many occasions that her father\n                would be intoxicated just prior to him raping\n                her, and based on my own cultural background I\n                connected the term “fetish” to her father’s abuse\n                of alcohol. I did not at that time investigate the\n                religious practices of fetish priests and was\n                unaware of the specifics of the Trokosi religion.\n                Since that time, I have learned more about that\n                religion and its practices and it fits precisely\n                with the experiences she was relating to me.\n                Again, my focus was on her immediate physical\n                and psychological well being and I failed to\n                investigate the cultural implications fully.\n\n       Addressing the statement in her original letter that Ms.\nFiadjoe had informed Ahmed of the father’s sexual abuse,\nMs. Jansen wrote:\n              There was some controversy over whether Ms.\n              Fiadjoe discussed these matters with her fiancé,\n              Ahmed. In reviewing my notes, I make\n              reference to the fact that Ahmed was “aware of\n              the abuse by her father”. When consulting my\n              notes to prepare the initial letter, I interpreted\n\n                               35\n\f              them to mean both the physical and sexual\n              abuse. I cannot now independently recall\n              whether I specifically referred to the physical\n              and sexual abuse when discussing this matter\n              with Ms. Fiadjoe. It would not at all surprise\n              me that she would have told him about the\n              physical abuse but not the sexual abuse. Indeed,\n              noting the cultural taboos and shame involved,\n              it is very likely that she would not tell Ahmed of\n              the multiple violent rapes she endured at the\n              hands of her father.\n\n       Addressing the subject of the manner of Ahmed’s\ndeath, Ms. Jansen explains that she merely inferred that he\nhad been shot and does not recall that Ms. Fiadjoe informed\nher that he had been shot:\n              There appeared to be additional controversy\n              over Ms. Fiadjoe’s knowledge of the manner of\n              Ahmed’s death. Again, in reviewing my notes,\n              I documented that while in the “shower room”\n              Ms. Fiadjoe heard a “loud noise” and upon\n              entering her bedroom, found Ahmed dying on\n              the floor. I believe that it was my interpretation\n              of events that Ahmed had been shot. I\n              apologize for the confusion that interpretation\n              caused. I have no independent recollection of\n              Ms. Fiadjoe specifically stating the manner of\n              death. Recall, please, that the purpose of my\n              services was not an investigative one. When I\n              began seeing Ms. Fiadjoe she was not able to\n              eat properly, was not sleeping consistently, was\n              experiencing severe flashbacks and distressing\n              nightmares, and was attempting to adjust to an\n              extremely foreign environment. It was my\n              purpose to alleviate the immediate\n              psychological pain and suffering and to assist\n\n                               36\n\f              her in adjusting to her new environment. The\n              exact manner of her fiancé’s murder was\n              inconsequential to the critical task at hand.\n\n        Apart from the failure of the BIA to consider this\nadditional evidence, Ms. Fiadjoe advanced four other grounds\nfor reconsideration; i) the BIA’s reliance upon Ms. Fiadjoe’s\nstatements to an INS officer upon arrival as a basis for a\nnegative credibility finding; ii) its finding that Ms. Fiadjoe\nhad failed to carry her burden that the government of Ghana\nwas unable or unwilling to assist her; iii) its finding that Ms.\nFiadjoe could have relocated to another part of Ghana; and iv)\nthe BIA’s failure to consider Ms. Fiadjoe’s persecution on\naccount of her religion as a Christian opposed to Trokosi and\nher feminist political opinion that women should be educated\nand not subjugated to men.\n        The BIA denied the motion for reconsideration stating\nthat Ms. Fiadjoe had not identified any change of law, new\nlegal argument or error in the BIA’s previous analysis that\nwould move it to reconsider its decision. It noted that the\ninconsistent statements to an immigration officer upon which\nit relied to support its credibility finding were not made at the\nairport immediately after landing but were made some weeks\nlater during a fair and thoughtful interview, thus rendering\nMs. Fiadjoe’s reliance upon the cases cited in support of the\nmotion misplaced.\n        Ms. Fiadjoe filed in this Court a petition for review of\nthe denial of the motion for reconsideration. That petition has\nbeen consolidated with the original petition for review.\n                           VI. Discussion\n        A. Jurisdiction and Standard of Review: We have\njurisdiction to review final orders of the BIA under §242(a)(1)\nof the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §1252(a)(1)\n(1999).\n        Both the IJ and the BIA made an adverse credibility\ndetermination. The final order that we review is the decision\n\n                               37\n\fof the BIA, and normally we review the decision of the BIA,\nnot the IJ, Gao v.

There\nare exceptions to this rule.

Thus, as in Xie v. Ashcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"785204\"><a href=\"/opinion/785204/xin-jie-xie-v-john-ashcroft-attorney-general-of-the-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">359</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">239</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir.\n2004), we address the circumstance in which “the BIA both\nadopted the IJ’s adverse credibility determination and\ndiscussed some, but not all, of the underlying bases for the\nIJ’s adverse credibility determination.” Id., at 242. In the\npresent case, in light of its expression of agreement with the\nIJ’s credibility finding and its own sketchy credibility\nanalysis, the BIA must have relied upon the adverse\ncredibility finding of the IJ. We thus have jurisdiction to\nreview both the BIA’s and IJ’s opinions. Id., at 242; see also,\nMiah v.

There is an additional\nreason to review the INS decision and the hearing from which\nthe decision derived. Any adverse credibility determinations\nbased on the testimony must be viewed with great caution in\nview of the abusive nature of the hearing.\n        Adverse credibility determinations are reviewed under\nthe substantial evidence standard. Under this standard, the\nBIA’s adverse credibility determination must be upheld on\nreview unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled\nto conclude to the contrary.

The IJ Hearing and Credibility Finding 4 : Prior to\nthe commencement of testimony before the IJ on April 30,\n2002 the IJ identified the record in his possession. It included\nMs. Fiadjoe’s July 5, 2001 asylum affidavit (Form I-589)\nwhich recited in full detail the circumstances that led to her\nflight - the commencement of her father’s sexual abuse at age\nseven, the resumption of her life as a Trokosi slave at age\neighteen and the continuing beatings and periodic rape\ncommitted by her father. It recited her attempts to escape\nfrom her father’s house, her flight to Nigeria, her return, her\nfather’s murder of the man whom she loved and hoped to\nmarry, and her second flight and inability to find someone in\nAccra who would take her in.\n        Also in the record which the IJ possessed was Ms.\n\n\n        3\n           The BIA did not reach the issues of i) whether bondage as\na Trokosi slave would meet the definition of persecution on account\nof membership in a particular social group; ii) whether if Ms.\nFiadjoe’s testimony were credible she had “established that she was,\nin fact, a Trokosi slave;” and iii) whether Ms. Fiadjoe could escape\npersecution by locating elsewhere in Ghana.\n       4\n           Significantly, on this appeal the government made no\nattempt to defend the credibility determinations of either the IJ or the\nBIA.\n\n                                  39\n\fJansen’s June 22, 2000 letter describing her therapy sessions\nwith Ms. Fiadjoe and Ms. Fiadjoe’s emotional state. Ms.\nJansen recounted how Ms. Fiadjoe’s emotional condition\nimproved markedly after sessions of counseling and that\nalthough “[h]er communication abilities have improved,” she\nnevertheless “continues to occasionally dissociate when\ndiscussing emotionally painful events.” It was, of course,\nnecessary to testify about emotionally painful events at the\nApril 30, 2002 hearing.\n       The INS Guidelines entitled “Consideration for\nAsylum Officers Adjudicating Asylum Claims from Women”\ndescribe in general terms the phenomena that Ms. Jansen\nobserved in Ms. Fiadjoe. The Guidelines are as applicable to\nan IJ credibility determination as they are to an Asylum\nOfficer’s credibility determination, e.g.,:\n               Women who have been raped or otherwise\n               sexually abused may be seriously stigmatized\n               and ostracized in their societies. They may also\n               be subject to additional violence, abuse or\n               discrimination because they are viewed as\n               having brought shame and dishonor on\n               themselves, their families, and their\n               communities.\n\n                              …\n\n              Women who have been subject to domestic or\n              sexual abuse may be psychologically\n              traumatized. Trauma can be suffered by any\n              applicant, regardless, of gender, and may have a\n              significant impact on the ability to present\n              testimony.\n\n              The demeanor of traumatized applicants can\n              vary. They may appear numb or show\n\n\n                              40\n\f             emotional passivity when recounting past events\n             of mistreatment. Some applicants may give\n             matter-of-fact recitations of serious instances of\n             mistreatment. Trauma may also cause memory\n             loss or distortion, and may cause other\n             applicants to block certain experiences from\n             their minds in order not to relive their horror by\n             the retelling.\n\n             In Anglo-American cultures, people who avert\n             their gaze when answering a question, or seem\n             nervous, are perceived as untruthful. In other\n             cultures, however, body language does not\n             convey the same message. In certain Asian\n             cultures, for example, people will avert their\n             eyes when speaking to an authority figure as a\n             sign of respect. This is a product of culture, not\n             necessarily of credibility.\n\n             It bears reiteration that the foregoing\n             considerations of demeanor can be the products\n             of trauma or culture, not credibility. Poor\n             interview techniques/cross-cultural skills may\n             cause faulty negative credibility findings.\n\n        From the outset of the April 30, 2002 hearing the IJ\ntook over much of the questioning of Ms. Fiadjoe, both on\ndirect and on cross-examination by the government. His tone\nwas hostile and at times became extraordinarily abusive. If\nnot by design, in effect, he produced the very atmosphere that\nMs. Jansen and the INS Guidelines anticipated would cause\nmemory loss, blocking, dissociating and breakdown.\n        Examining Ms. Fiadjoe concerning the highly sensitive\nsubject of her father’s sexual abuse at age seven, the IJ’s\nquestioning reduced her to tears (see transcript excerpt at.\npp.14-16, supra).\n\n                              41\n\f        At that point in the proceedings Ms. Fiadjoe began\nhaving difficulty responding to the IJ. She had been born in\n1971. In response to her attorney’s questions she testified that\nshe went to live with her Aunt Dela in Accra when she was\nseven, i.e., in 1978, thus bringing the sexual abuse to a\ntemporary halt. She further testified that she remained with\nAunt Dela eleven years and was 18 years of age when she\nreturned to her father’s home upon the death of Aunt Dela. A\nrather simple calculation would have placed this in the year\n1989, but under the IJ’s harsh questioning Ms. Fiadjoe was\nunable to recall the year and was reduced to an inability to\nrespond (see transcript excerpt at pp 16-17, supra).\n        The bullying nature of the IJ’s questioning was further\nevident in his interrogation of Ms. Fiadjoe about her\nknowledge that her father kept idols in the room in which he\nworshiped when she testified that she had never been in the\nroom. Ignoring the obvious point that Ms. Fiadjoe made, that\nshe could see into the room without entering it, the IJ\ncontinued to badger her (see transcript excerpt at p. 17-18\nsupra).\n        Dealing with a subject that can only have been\nextremely painful to Ms. Fiadjoe, her father’s murder of her\nfiancé Ahmed, the IJ pursued an apparent inconsistency\nbetween Ms. Fiadjoe’s testimony and Ms. Jansen’s report\nconcerning whether Ms. Fiadjoe had told Ahmed about the\nsexual aspect of the abuse she had suffered. The IJ reduced\nMs. Fiadjoe to an inability to respond to his questions (see\ntranscript excerpt at pp 18-19 supra).\n        These are examples of the manner in which the IJ\ntreated Ms. Fiadjoe throughout the hearing. An examination\nof the entire transcript discloses other instances of his extreme\ninsensitivity towards the witness and his failure to take into\naccount the abuses to which she had been subjected in Ghana.\nThe IJ’s own concluding questions and remarks demonstrate\nthat he had reduced her to the emotional state against which\nMs. Jansen and the INS Guidelines had warned:\n\n                               42\n\fJUDGE TO MS. FIADJOE\n\n          Q:   Ms. Fiadjoe, you’ve heard my decision,\n               you’ve heard what I’ve just said?\n\n          A:   (No audible response).\n\n          Q:   Oh, you were sleeping there, you fell\n               asleep didn’t you?\n\n          A:   (No audible response).\n\n          Q:   You fell asleep during my decision?\n\n          A:   No, I’m feeling headache.\n\n          Q:   Did you hear what I said or were you\n               asleep?\n\n          A:   I wasn’t asleep.\n\n          Q:   Did you hear what I said?\n\n          A:   I thought that you (indiscernible), so I\n               didn’t.\n\n          Q:   Okay, all right, well, what I said was,\n               that first of all, I don’t believe your\n               testimony, I think that you were making\n               up your testimony as you were going\n               along. Your testimony is contradicted\n               by, much of it is contradicted by your\n               own witness, Ms. Jansen, her, her, the\n               letter that she wrote, your testimony\n               generally doesn’t make sense. I further\n               found, and I denied it, basically because\n\n                        43\n\f                      of that, I further found that if I had found\n                      that you were credible, that you were\n                      telling me the truth, I do not find that - -\n\n                     (OFF THE RECORD)\n\n        As the INS Guidelines stated, “[p]oor interview\ntechniques/cross-cultural skills may cause faulty negative\ncredibility findings”. They most certainly did so in this case.\n        The conduct of the IJ by itself would require a\nrejection of his credibility finding. Apart from that\nconsideration, the formal reasons he gave for finding “that the\nrespondent is making up her testimony as she is going along,\nshe’s making up these scenarios and she is fabricating her\ntestimony to the Court” do not withstand examination.\n        First, the IJ relied upon Ms. Fiadjoe’s inability to state\nthe year when she returned from Aunt Dela to her father’s\nhouse. It is true that Ms. Fiadjoe, after being subjected to the\nIJ’s brow beating, could not recall the year of her return.\nHowever, she testified that she was born in 1971, left for Aunt\nDela’s home when she was seven (1978) and returned after\neleven years when she was eighteen years of age. The\ninability to recall during the stress of the hearing that the year\nof return was 1989 does not affect credibility.\n        The IJ found that Ms. Fiadjoe’s testimony that her\nfather kept idols in the shrine room in his home was\ninconsistent with her testimony that she never entered the\nroom. In spite of the badgering nature of the IJ’s questioning,\nMs. Fiadjoe fully explained that without entering she could\nsee into the room, that idols were also kept outside the room,\nand that she observed other Trokosi adherents enter the room\nto bring food to the idols and later leave. There was no\ninconsistency in her testimony.\n        Referring to Ms. Fiadjoe’s testimony about her return\nto her father’s home after her and Ahmed’s abortive attempt\nto establish a residence in Nigeria, the IJ attributes to Ms.\n\n                               44\n\fFiadjoe the statement that “she returned there since she did\nnot want her father to be angered by the fact that she was with\nAhmed.” The IJ found that “[t]his absolutely is totally\nimplausible and totally nonsensical to the Court, insofar as the\nrespondent was returning to a situation where she knew she\nwas going to be raped and beaten.” The IJ’s subsequent\nobservations make no sense: “And I don’t believe that she\nwould have any fear that her father would be angered and if\nshe did have a fear, that fear would be a lesser fear than the\nrape and the beatings that she knew awaited her. As it turned\nout, when the respondent did return, her father not only beat\nher but poured hot water on her as a form of punishment.” In\nthe first place the IJ does not give an accurate recital of Ms.\nFiadjoe’s testimony. She did not want her father to attack\nAhmed but the reason she gave for returning to her father was\nthat “I don’t, my father, I don’t have anybody to go to,” a fact\nthat, as will be discussed in connection with the BIA’s\ncredibility finding, is fully supported by the record.\n        Next, the IJ found Ms. Fiadjoe lacked credibility\nbecause “Ms. Jansen’s letter reflects nothing to the effect that\nrespondent’s father was a member of the Trokosi cult, nor that\nthe respondent herself was a Trokosi slave. The respondent\nwas not able to explain why what she told the Court, was not\ntold to the social worker.” The IJ’s premise that Ms. Fiadjoe\ndid not tell Ms. Jansen about the Trokosi sect is totally wrong,\neven if reference is made only to the letter in evidence before\nthe IJ. Repeatedly throughout the asylum proceedings Ms.\nFiadjoe referred to her father’s Trokosi practices as his\n“fetish.” In her June 22, 2000 letter Ms. Jansen writes, “Ms.\nFiadjoe describes her father as having a religious “fetish.”\nMs. Jansen at that time did not understand what Ms. Fiadjoe\nwas telling her, a misunderstanding which she later overcame,\nas explained in her October 31, 2002 letter, which will be\ndiscussed further in connection with the BIA’s credibility\ndetermination. In any event, the IJ was simply in error when\nhe stated that Ms. Jansen’s letter reflects nothing to the effect\n\n                               45\n\fthat Ms. Fiadjoe’s father was a member of the Trokosi cult.\n        The IJ perceived two other inconsistencies between\nMs. Fiadjoe’s testimony and what appeared in Ms. Jansen’s\nJune 22, 2000 letter. He assumed Ms. Fiadjoe told Ms.\nJansen what was stated in the letter. First, Ms. Fiadjoe\ntestified that she never told Ahmed about the sexual assaults\nupon her, whereas the letter states Ahmed “was aware of the\nsexual assaults by her father, but was powerless to stop them.”\nSecond, Ms. Fiadjoe testified that, not having seen her father\nkill Ahmed, she did not know how he was killed, whereas the\nletter states “[w]hen she emerged, she found her boyfriend\nlying shot on the floor.” (emphasis added). As disclosed in\nMs. Jansen’s October 21, 2002 letter (which was not before\nthe IJ), these inconsistencies resulted from Ms. Jansen’s\nerroneous assumptions, not from misstatements of Ms.\nFiadjoe. Even if there were such inconsistencies (which there\nwere not), they were minor in nature. In the entire flow of\nevents that afflicted Ms. Fiadjoe from age seven until she fled\nfrom Ghana, it was immaterial whether Ahmed knew of the\nsexual abuse as well as the other forms of abuse perpetrated\nby the father and whether the father shot or stabbed Ahmed,\nthe only likely other means of killing him.\n        The IJ relied upon statements that Ms. Fiadjoe made to\nImmigration officers upon her arrival in the United States and\nupon the occasion of her Asylum Pre-screening Interview on\nMarch 30, 2000, which are inconsistent with her asylum\naffidavit, the information she provided Ms. Jansen and her\ntestimony. For reasons that will be set forth in the discussion\nof the BIA’s credibility determination, these statements do not\nconstitute substantial evidence that would permit a finding\nthat Ms. Fiadjoe lacked credibility.\n        As the IJ expressed it, “[t]he credibility of the\nrespondent is of extreme importance in assessing respondent’s\nclaim.” No adverse credibility assessment derived from a\nhearing conducted under the circumstances and in the manner\nthat the IJ conducted the April 30, 2002 hearing could survive\n\n                              46\n\freview. Further, even if the hearing were conducted in an\neven-handed, fair manner, the reasons that the IJ gave for his\nfinding of lack of credibility are not supported by substantial\nevidence.\n        C. The BIA’s Credibility Finding: Of necessity the\nBIA had before it the transcript of the IJ hearing and the\ndocumentary record. Ms. Fiadjoe’s asylum application, her\nrecital of events during her counseling with Ms. Jansen and\nher testimony at the hearing were consistent in their detailed\ndescription of the extended series of horrifying events that\noccurred in her life from age seven until her flight from\nGhana after the murder of Ahmed. Despite the IJ’s\nconclusion that “[she was] making up her testimony as [she\nwas] going along,” it is highly improbable that anyone could\nconsistently recount these events in detail on each of these\nthree occasions.\n        The BIA, apart from its general agreement with the IJ’s\nadverse credibility determination, relied upon two grounds for\nits own adverse credibility determination: i) a purported\ninconsistency in Ms. Fiadjoe’s testimony concerning the\nnature of the sexual abuse that her father perpetrated upon her\nat age seven, and ii) the inconsistencies in her sworn\nstatement before an Asylum Officer given approximately\nnineteen days after she was taken into custody at the airport.\nDespite the critical nature of the issue and the extensiveness\nof the record, the BIA devoted a mere twelve lines of its\nopinion to set forth the reasons for its credibility finding.\n        As to the sexual abuse at age 7, the BIA decision\nstated:\n               She claimed in her written asylum application\n               and during her testimony in immigration court\n               that her father began to abuse her sexually and\n               attempted to rape her when she was 7 years old\n               (Exh. 6-2 at 2; Tr. at 25). Shortly thereafter, she\n               modified her testimony somewhat and claimed\n               that her father had in fact raped her when she\n\n                               47\n\f              was 7 (Tr. at 32).\n\n        In her asylum application (Exh. 6-2 at 2) Ms. Fiadjoe\nstated, “[a]fter my parent’s [sic] separation, I lived with my\nfather and he began to sexually abuse me. This started when I\nwas 7 years old.” At her hearing (Tr. at 25) Ms. Fiadjoe\ntestified, “[a]t the age of seven, he’s tried to rape me and\nabuse me and beat me up and want me to be part of Trokosi,\nTrokosi.” At the point in the hearing when the IJ had reduced\nMs. Fiadjoe to tears and berated her for crying and “beating\naround bush” he asked her how long her father beat or raped\nher (Tr. at 32), to which she responded before dissolving into\ntears “[f]or, till I was seven, I know my father was raping\nme.” There is no necessary inconsistency in these statements.\nSexual abuse during a three months’ period could plausibly\ninclude both attempted rape and rape. Moreover, it is\nunreasonable to expect a person to remember whether the\nrepeated sexual abuse she suffered at age seven constituted\nattempted rape or actual rape. In the present case, in light of\nwhat followed in the ensuing years, any imprecision in this\nregard cannot rationally be a basis for an adverse credibility\nfinding.\n        As to the inconsistencies in the statement before the\nAsylum Officer, the BIA decision stated:\n                However, the respondent stated in a sworn\n                statement before an asylum officer with the\n                Immigration and Naturalization Service (now\n                the Department of Homeland Security, DHS)\n                that the abuse began approximately 3 years prior\n                to her interview in 2000 (Exh. 6-9 at 4), when\n                she would have been 26 or 27. In fact, she\n                claimed in that interview that she never allowed\n                her father to have sex with her (id.), in stark\n                contrast to her later claims of on-going rape (Tr.\n                at 27-28, 76, 78-79).\n\n\n                               48\n\f        On March 30, 2000 Asylum Officer James L. Reaves\nconducted an Asylum Pre-Screening Interview. There can be\nno criticism of the manner in which he conducted the\ninterview. He ensured that Ms. Fiadjoe had an interpreter in\nthe Twi language. His questions were concise. There is every\nreason to believe that he, unlike the IJ, followed the INS\nMemorandum on Considerations for Asylum Officers\nAdjudicating Asylum Claims from Women, dated May 6,\n1995.\n        With one exception, the answers Ms. Fiadjoe gave to\nhim were fully consistent with her subsequent asylum\napplication, her statements to Ms. Jansen and her hearing\ntestimony. They included information about her family, her\nfather’s beatings, her flight from home, the murder of her\nfiancé, and her inability thereafter to find refuge with Aunt\nDela’s husband, her mother and stepfather and the friend in\nAccra. Ms. Fiadjoe’s statement before Officer Reaves\ndeparted from her asylum application, the information she\ngave to Ms. Jansen and her hearing testimony in the following\nrespect:\n               Q:     Have you ever been harmed in your\n                      country by anyone?\n               A:     Yes, by my father.\n               Q:     What did your father do to you?\n               A:     He abused me by beating me.\n               Q:     When did this happen?\n               A:     He started doing this about 3 years ago.\n               Q:     Did you live with him at that time?\n               A:     Yes, I was staying at home.\n               Q:     How long did this continue?\n               A:     This continued for 3 years, sometimes he\n                      tried to have sex with me.\n               Q:     Did you ever have sex with your father?\n               A:     No, I never allowed it.\n               Q:     When did this happen?\n               A:     It happened many times during the three\n\n                             49\n\f                     years. When someone came to the house\n                     to marry me he would reject them.\n\n              Q:     When did this end?\n\n              A:     It never ended until I ran away from\n                     home. He wanted me to marry an old\n                     man, I told him no. A friend came over\n                     to my house. I went to take a shower and\n                     when I returned the friend was dead. I\n                     think my father killed my boyfriend. He\n                     was 33 years old.\n\n              Q:     Did your father kill this young man?\n\n              A:     I was in the shower, when I came out my\n                     father was coming out of my room. I\n                     don’t know what he used to kill him.\n\n        To determine whether this discrepancy constitutes\nsubstantial evidence to support the IJ’s and the BIA’s adverse\ncredibility determinations, it is necessary to examine the\ncircumstances in which the statement was given. Only\nnineteen days previously, March 11, 2000, Ms. Fiadjoe had\narrived in this country traumatized by years of sexual\noppression, the March 5 murder of her fiancé and a desperate\nbut futile effort to find refuge from her father in Accra. On\nher arrival at the airport she was questioned by an INS Officer\nand gave nonsensical answers. For example, when asked why\nshe left her home country she responded “I want to look after\nmy mother.”\n        It is established in this Circuit that inconsistencies\nbetween an airport statement and an asylum seeker’s\ntestimony before an IJ is not sufficient, standing alone, to\nsupport a BIA finding that the petitioner was not credible.\nBalasubramanrim v.

Yet conditions similar to,\nand in many ways worse than, those at an airport interview\nprevailed. Ms. Fiadjoe was still in a state of shock resulting\nfrom the devastating experiences prior to March 11. Ms.\nJansen described Ms. Fiadjoe’s emotional state which existed\nat the time of the Asylum Officer’s interview and thereafter\nuntil she had undergone counseling with Ms. Jansen:\n               In the aftermath of her fiancee’s murder, Ms.\n               Fiadjoe was in a state of shock. She reports\n               symptoms that are textbook acute psychological\n               trauma. Without significant training in trauma\n               psychology, she would be very unlikely to\n               falsely report those symptoms much less\n               describe them in the details as she and I have\n               discussed them.\n\n        Finding herself in a strange place before a male officer\nit is not surprising that Ms. Fiadjoe would be unable to\ndiscuss the shameful and taboo incidents of incestuous rape.\nIn both her letters Ms. Jansen described Ms. Fiadjoe’s\n\n                               51\n\femotional state when she first saw her and recounted that it\nwas not until Ms. Fiadjoe had engaged in a number of therapy\nsessions that she was able to discuss fully, even with her,\nsexual abuses which her father had committed. Completely\nconsistent with the INS Memorandum concerning\nconsiderations for adjudicating claims of women, Ms. Jansen\nwrote in her October 31, 2002 letter:\n               It is extraordinarily difficult for sexual abuse\n               victims to discuss specifics of their abuse\n               experiences. Given the extreme shame that\n               surrounds these issues in general they are\n               difficult for both men and women to discuss.\n               With the addition of the cultural factors\n               surrounding Ms. Fiadjoe’s experiences in\n               particular, it should be of no surprise at all that\n               she would be reluctant to discuss these issues\n               with anyone, most specifically with a male or in\n               the presence of several males.\n\n        Asked on cross examination why she had not informed\nthe INS Officer about what had happened, Ms. Fiadjoe\nresponded, “About sexual aspects, my father sleeping with\nme, I don’t feel comfortable telling people . . ..” The BIA\nconsidered none of these factors when rendering its decision.\n        As discussed above, the inconsistency in Ms. Fiadjoe’s\nstatement to the Asylum Officer is all that is left that reflects\non Ms. Fiadjoe’s credibility. None of the other reasons given\nby either the IJ or the BIA support an adverse credibility\ndetermination. By placing reliance on this interview under\nthe circumstances in which it was taken and “ignoring more\ndetailed accounts in Form 1-589 as well as testimony at an\nasylum hearing, the INS seriously undermined the reliability\nof the administrative process.” Senathirajah, 157 F.3d at 218.\nNeither the IJ’s nor the BIA’s adverse credibility\ndetermination is supported by substantial evidence.\n        D.

The BIA’s evidential support for this\nfinding is set forth in its entirety in a bare six lines of its\ndecision:\n               The respondent never sought the help of the\n               authorities in Ghana (Tr. at 66). The respondent\n               claimed that her grandmother told the police of\n               the respondent’s being beaten but that she\n               declined to tell the authorities about the ritual\n               sex abuse due to shame (Tr. at 29. The\n               respondent submitted evidence that the\n               government of Ghana outlawed Trokosi practice\n\n                                53\n\f               and ritual bondage in 1998 and that a non-\n               governmental organization has had success in\n               liberating, counseling, and rehabilitating past\n               victims of such bondage. (Exh. 6-5).\n\n       In the context of the record viewed in its entirety, these\ntwo snippets of information, both of them inadequately stated,\ndo not constitute substantial evidence to support the BIA’s\nfinding that Ms. Fiadjoe has failed to establish that the\ngovernment of Ghana was either unable or unwilling to\ncontrol her father’s ritual sexual abuse. The BIA totally\nignored the evidence in the record that establishes the deep\nhold that the Trokosi religion has upon substantial elements of\nthe Ghanian people. For example:\n               Appalled by the practice, some Ghanians have\n               broken the fearful silence which surrounds\n               Trokosi. But their calls for it to be banned have\n               had little impact on the centuries old tradition\n               which has the blessing of some of Ghana’s most\n               powerful man. Jerry Rawlings, the country’s\n               charismatic if not exactly democratic, president\n               - himself an Ewe - has spoken of Trokosi as an\n               important part of Ghana’s cultural heritage.\n\nBooker, Slave of the Fetish, the Independent - London (June\n\n16, 1996) (R. 363)5 .\n\n       5\n          The dissenting opinion concludes that we have failed to\naccord proper deference to the BIA’s finding on the issue of\ngovernment protection in Ghana. The lengthy quotation from the\nState Department’s 2000 Country Report on Human Rights Practices\nin Ghana to which the dissent refers does in fact set forth efforts of\nthe government and human rights organizations to end the Trokosi\npractice, but the concluding portion of the quotation recites how\nineffective the government efforts have been despite limited success\n\n                                 54\n\f        Nor is it easy to escape from Trokosi slavery.\nSpeaking of his slaves, one Trokosi priest stated, “Their\nfamilies wouldn’t take them back. They’re too afraid of\nangering the fetish.”\n        The BIA was incorrect when it stated that “[t]he\nrespondent never sought the help of the authorities in Ghana.”\nMs. Fiadjoe did seek such help through her grandmother who\ntwice sought assistance from the police. It is true, as the BIA\nstates, that the grandmother was too ashamed to mention the\nsexual aspect of the abuse, but the record is replete with\nevidence that the police would have done nothing even if they\n\n\n\n\nby NGOs:\n\n                     The Government has not prosecuted any\n                     practitioners of Trokosi and in August 1999,\n                     a presidential aide criticized anti-Trokosi\n                     activists for being insensitive to indigenous\n                     cultural and “religious” beliefs and practices.\n                     A local group, calling itself the “Troxovi\n                     Institutional Council” (Troxovi is an alternate\n                     spelling for Trokosi) declared that Trokosi, as\n                     defined by CHRAJ and other human rights\n                     groups to be a form of ritual servitude, does\n                     not exist in the country. The group claimed\n                     that the practice of “Troxovi” does exist but\n                     neither enslaves nor exploits anyone. The\n                     Council also listed 23 ‘genuine Troxovi\n                     shrines’ in Ghana, describing them as\n                     educational institutions and as part of the\n                     “Afrikania religion.” The claims were widely\n                     refuted by chiefs, the press, and NGOs.\n\nAR:343-44 (emphasis added)\n\n\n                               55\n\fhad been informed of that aspect of the abuse 6 .\n       The most recent State Department Report covering\nGhana shows how futile resort to the police would have been.\nMultiple pages are devoted to the brutality and corruption of\nthe police and their refusal to prosecute sensitive crime, as\nTrokosi sexual practices certainly were, particularly in a\nvillage inhabited by believers in the sect. The Report notes\nthat “[v]iolence against women, including rape and domestic\nviolence remains a significant problem. A 1998 study\nrevealed that particularly in low-income, high-density sections\nof greater Accra, at least 54 percent of women have been\nassaulted in recent years. A total of 95 percent of the victims\nof domestic violence are women according to data gathered\nby the FIDA. These abuses generally go unreported and\nseldom come before the courts. The police tend not to\nintervene in domestic disputes.”\n       Ms. Fiadjoe’s own experiences demonstrate that where\na Trokosi slave is involved the police will not intervene. She\nhad to flee to another country to escape from her father,\nwhere, unfortunately she was unable to stay. When she\nobtained her own room from a landlord in her neighborhood,\nher father so terrorized the landlord that he turned her out.\nSurely if the landlord had thought he could have obtained\nappropriate protection for himself and his tenant he would\nhave turned to the public authorities. Similarly, when Ms.\nFiadjoe fled to Accra after Ahmed’s murder, her own mother\ndid not dare to take her in, nor did her Aunt Dela’s husband,\n\n       6\n            The dissent finds Fiadjoe’s hearing testimony vague\nconcerning what her grandmother told the police. When evaluating\nMs. Fiadjoe’s testimony it should be kept in mind that it was given\nduring a hearing at which the IJ treated Ms. Fiadjoe with total\ninsensitivity throughout, causing her to break down, become confused\nand ultimately to become reduced to silence. The BIA majority took\nno account of this factor.\n\n\n                                56\n\fnor did an old friend. The old friend was so frightened that\nthe father would suspect that Ms. Fiadjoe had come to him\nthat he removed her to a girlfriend’s house, of which the\nfather was presumably unaware, and assisted her in obtaining\na false passport for flight out of the country. If the authorities\nwere willing or able to protect this Trokosi slave none of this\nflight and fear would have been necessary7 .\n        The BIA selected two facts set forth in the State\nDepartment Report: i) “the government of Ghana outlawed\nTrokosi practice and ritual bondage in 1998\" and ii) “a non-\ngovernmental organization has had success in liberating,\ncounseling, and rehabilitating past victims of such bondage.”\n(emphasis added). This selective use of the State Department\nReport is misleading and does not constitute substantial\nevidence.\n        In the first place, the BIA ignored other evidence in the\nrecord demonstrating continuation of Trokosi slavery and the\ngovernment’s unwillingness and inability to end it. The State\nDepartment Report itself confirms this continuation despite\nthe 1998 legislation that banned “‘customary servitude’\n(known as Trokosi)”.\n        The Ghanian Constitution had for a long time\nprohibited such practices. “Every person has a right to\npersonal liberty.” Art. 14. “No person shall be held in\nslavery and servitude or be required to perform forced labor.”\nArt. 16. These provisions had had no effect on the Trokosi\ncult. Similarly the 1998 legislation outlawing Trokosi has not\nsucceeded in eliminating Trokosi slavery. While it is true that\n\n\n\n       7\n         These facts, along with much other evidence, totally negate\nthe BIA’s statement that “respondent implicitly admitted that she\ncould escape her father’s abuse by moving to an urban area.” It is\nunnecessary to rule at this time that this finding also is not supported\nby substantial evidence because the BIA only advanced it in a\nhypothetical context.\n\n                                  57\n\fcertain organizations have succeeded in liberating and\nretraining approximately 2,800 Trokosi slaves, the 2001 State\nDepartment Report confirms that the practice remains very\nmuch alive:\n              Trokosi, a traditional practice found among the\n              Ewe ethnic group and in part of the Volta\n              Region, is an especially severe human rights\n              abuse and an extremely serious violation of\n              children’s and women’s rights. It is a system in\n              which a young girl, sometimes under the age of\n              10, is made a slave to a fetish shrine for\n              offenses allegedly committed by a member of\n              the girl’s family. In rare instances, boys are\n              offered. The belief is that, if someone in that\n              family has committed a crime, such as stealing,\n              members of the family may begin to die in large\n              numbers unless a young girl is given to the local\n              fetish shrine to atone for the offense. The girl\n              becomes the property of the fetish priest, must\n              work on the priest’s farm, and perform other\n              labors for him. Because they are the sexual\n              property of the priests, most Trokosi slaves have\n              children by the priests. Although the girls’\n              families must provide for their needs such as\n              food, most are unable to do so. There are at\n              least 2,200 girls and women bound to various\n              shrines in the Trokosi system, a figure that does\n              not include the slaves’ children. Even when\n              freed by her fetish priest from the more onerous\n              aspects of her bondage, whether voluntarily or\n              as a result of intervention by activists, a Trokosi\n              woman generally has few marketable skills and\n              little hope of marriage and typically remains\n              bound to the shrine for life by psychological and\n              social pressure arising from a traditional belief\n              that misfortune may befall a Trokosi woman’s\n\n                               58\n\f               family or village if she abandons her obligations\n               to the shrine. When a fetish slave dies, her\n               family is expected to replace her with another\n               young girl, thus perpetuating the bondage to the\n               fetish shrine from generation to generation.\n\n        Human rights organization are hopeful that ultimately\nTrokosi practices can be stamped out, but they persist, and\nMs. Fiadjoe has to live in the present, not in a more hopeful\nfuture. Pertinent to the fact that she can expect no help from\nthe government authorities is the following observation\ncontained in the State Department Report but not addressed\nby the BIA: “The Government has not prosecuted any\npractitioners of Trokosi, and in August 1999, a presidential\naide criticized anti-Trokosi activists for being insensitive to\nindigenous cultural and ‘religious’ beliefs and practices.”\n        In light of Ms. Fiadjoe’s own experiences and the\ndocumentary evidence in the record, we conclude that the\nBIA’s finding that Ms. Fiadjoe failed to establish that the\ngovernment of Ghana was either unwilling or unable to\ncontrol her father’s sexual abuse is not supported by\nsubstantial evidence8 .\n                         IV. Conclusion\n        The adverse credibility determinations of the IJ and of\nthe BIA are not supported by substantial evidence, nor is the\nBIA’s finding that Ms. Fiadjoe failed to establish that the\ngovernment of Ghana was either unwilling or unable to\ncontrol her father’s sexual abuse supported by substantial\nevidence.\n        We will grant the petition for review and remand the\ncase to the BIA for further remand to a different IJ for a new\n\n\n       8\n         In light of the disposition of the case it is unnecessary to\nconsider Ms. Fiadjoe’s petition seeking review of the BIA’s order\ndenying her motion to reconsider its June 6, 2003 opinion.\n\n                                 59\n\fhearing at which there may be received in evidence the\ndocuments that accompanied Ms. Fiadjoe’s motion before the\nBIA for reconsideration of its June 6, 2003 decision and\nevidence, if available, of continuing Trokosi practices and\ngovernmental attempts to eradicate them and to protect\nTrokosi victims.\n\n\n\n\n                            60\n\fFiadjoe v. Ashcroft, Nos. 03-1971, 04-1544\n\nSMITH, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\n       While I would like to conclude otherwise, the majority’s\napproach to its review of the BIA’s findings concerning\ngovernment protection in Ghana is, in my view, inconsistent\nwith the deferential approach we are required to take in these\ncases. Accordingly, I must dissent.\n\n        Ms. Fiajdoe’s is a tragic story. She does not present the\ntypical claim for asylum, in which a refugee seeks protection\nfrom her native government or from forces acting on the\ngovernment’s behalf. Instead, she recounts a history of physical\nand sexual abuse suffered at the hands of her father, allegedly in\nconnection with her father’s activities as a traditional “Trokosi”\npriest. Though the grant of asylum has traditionally been used\nto protect immigrants fleeing government persecution, our laws\nare sensitive to the plight of individuals such as Ms. Fiadjoe. As\nthe majority explains, a private incident that rises to the level of\npersecution can create eligibility for asylum when it is\ncommitted “by forces the government is either unable or\nunwilling to control.” Gao v. Ashcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"778653\"><a href=\"/opinion/778653/chen-yun-gao-v-john-ashcroft-attorney-general-of-the-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">299</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">266</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 272 (3d\nCir. 2002). My difficulty with this case is that, try as I might, I\ncannot say - as the law requires us to say if we are to reverse the\n\n                                61\n\fBIA - that “any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to\nconclude” that the Ghanaian government is unable or unwilling\nto control her father. I cannot say that here because there is\nwhat I consider to be ample evidence in the record to support the\nBIA’s conclusion that, if the government had been informed of\nwhat Fiadjoe claims her father did, it would have been willing\nand able to control him. The majority sidesteps this evidence in\nfavor of other information that may cast doubt on the efficacy of\nGhana’s anti-Trokosi efforts, and holds that the presence of such\nevidence compels an opposite conclusion than that reached by\nthe BIA. It is simply not our charge to do that.9\n\n       To establish eligibility for asylum on the basis of past\npersecution, an applicant must show: “(1) an incident, or\nincidents, that rise to the level of persecution; (2) that is ‘on\naccount of’ one of the statutorily protected grounds; and (3) is\ncommitted by the government or forces the government is either\n‘unable or unwilling’ to control.” Gao v.

Thus, we must review the BIA’s finding that Fiadjoe\nfailed to show that the government of Ghana was unable or\nunwilling to control her father’s abuse in order to determine if\nthat finding is supported by substantial evidence.\n\n       In Dia v. Ashcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"784554\"><a href=\"/opinion/784554/saidou-dia-v-john-ashcroft-attorney-general-of-the-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">353</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">228</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir. 2003) (en\nbanc), we elaborated on the nature of substantial evidence\nreview of an asylum claim:\n\n       Thus, the question whether an agency\n       determination is supported by substantial\n       evidence is the same as the question whether a\n       reasonable fact finder could make such a\n       determination based upon the administrative\n       record. If a reasonable fact finder could make a\n       particular finding on the administrative record,\n       then the finding is supported by substantial\n       evidence. Conversely, if no reasonable fact finder\n       could make that finding on the administrative\n       record, the finding is not supported by substantial\n       evidence.\n\n\n\n\n                               63\n\fDia, 353 F.3d at 249. We emphasized that our deference to the\nagency’s findings is conditioned upon support in the record, and\nwe indicated that if the agency’s conclusion “is not based on a\nspecific, cogent reason, but instead, is based on speculation,\nconjecture, or an otherwise unsupported personal opinion, we\nwill not uphold it because it will not have been supported by\nsuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind would find\nadequate. In other words, it will not have been supported by\nsubstantial evidence.” Id. at 249-50.\n\n       The law requires applicants such as Ms. Fiadjoe to bear\nthe burden of proof of establishing her eligibility for asylum.\nSee Gao, 299 F.3d at 272; Abdille v. Ashcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772352\"><a href=\"/opinion/772352/mohamed-abdille-v-john-ashcroft-attorney-general-of-the-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">242</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">477</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 482\n(3d Cir. 2001). The BIA found that Ms. Fiadjoe failed to carry\nthis burden with respect to a critical element of her claim,\nnamely, that she had experienced persecution by forces the\ngovernment of Ghana was either unwilling or unable to control.\n\n        Our task in reviewing the BIA’s finding is not to\ndetermine whether we would have reached the same conclusion\nin the first instance. To the contrary, “the substantial evidence\nstandard of review is extremely deferential, setting a ‘high\nhurdle by permitting the reversal of factual findings only when\nthe record evidence would ‘compel’ a reasonable factfinder to\nmake a contrary determination.’” Chen v. Ashcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"787002\"><a href=\"/opinion/787002/he-chun-chen-aka-he-zhong-chen-v-john-ashcroft-attorney-general-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">376</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">215</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 223 (3d Cir. 2004). We have further explained that for a\npetitioner to prevail on a challenge to the BIA’s factual findings\nunder the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”), “the\n\n                               64\n\fevidence [on the issue in question] must be so strong in [the\npetitioner’s] favor that in a civil trial [the petitioner] would be\nentitled to judgment on the . . . issue as a matter of law.” See\nChen, 376 F.3d at 222 (citing INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112682\"><a href=\"/opinion/112682/ins-v-elias-zacarias/\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">478</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 481 n.1 (1992)).\n\n       Under this standard, I believe that the majority has failed\nto accord proper deference to the BIA’s findings on the issue of\ngovernment protection in Ghana. In concluding that Fiadjoe had\nnot met her burden of proof, the BIA stated:\n\n       The respondent never sought the help of the\n       authorities in Ghana. The respondent claimed\n       that her grandmother told the police of the\n       respondent’s being beaten but that she declined to\n       tell the authorities about the ritual sexual abuse\n       due to shame. The respondent submitted evidence\n       that the government of Ghana outlawed Trokosi\n       practice and ritual bondage in 1998 and that a\n       non-governmental organization has had success in\n       liberating, counseling, and rehabilitating past\n       victims of such bondage.           Therefore, the\n       respondent has not shown that the government of\n       Ghana would be unwilling or unable to protect\n       her.\n\n\n\n\nAR 74. The majority disagrees with the BIA’s conclusions, but\n\n\n                                65\n\fin so doing it fails adequately to address the record evidence\nsupporting the BIA’s findings and places disproportionate\nemphasis on anecdotal statements culled from various portions\nof the record.\n\n        The majority quotes the description of Trokosi practices\ncontained in the State Department’s 2000 Country Report on\nHuman Rights Practices in Ghana, which was also part of the\nrecord before the BIA. The paragraph immediately following\nthe excerpt quoted by the majority details Ghana’s anti-Trokosi\nefforts:\n\n       In 1998 Parliament passed legislation that banned\n       the practice of Trokosi in comprehensive\n       legislation to protect women and children’s rights.\n       Human rights activists believe that the goal of\n       eradicating the Trokosi practice is achievable with\n       the new law. NGO’s such as International Needs,\n       and government agencies like the CHRAJ, have\n       been campaigning against Trokosi for several\n       years and are familiar with the locations of the\n       fetish shrines and the numbers of women and\n       children enslaved. Activists know the community\n       leaders and fetish priests and, thus, know with\n       whom to negotiate.           The CHRAJ and\n       International Needs have had some success in\n       approaching village authorities and fetish priests\n       at over 316 of the major and minor shrines,\n       winning the release of 2,800 Trokosi slaves to\n\n\n                               66\n\f       date and retraining them for new professions. The\n       organizations continue to work for additional\n       releases. The Government has not prosecuted any\n       practitioners of Trokosi and in August 1999, a\n       presidential aide criticized anti-Trokosi activists\n       for being insensitive to indigenous cultural and\n       “religious” beliefs and practices. A local group,\n       calling itself the “Troxovi Institutional Council”\n       (Troxovi is an alternate spelling for Trokosi)\n       declared that Trokosi, as defined by CHRAJ and\n       other human rights groups to be a form of ritual\n       servitude, does not exist in the country. The\n       group claimed that the practice of “Troxovi” does\n       exist but neither enslaves nor exploits anyone.\n       The Council also listed 23 ‘genuine Troxovi\n       shrines’ in Ghana, describing them as educational\n       institutions and as part of the “Afrikania religion.”\n       These claims were widely refuted by chiefs, the\n       press, and NGOs.\n\nAR:343-44.\n\n        In light of this discussion, it is unclear to me how the\nmajority can hold that no reasonable factfinder could conclude\nthat the government of Ghana would be willing and able to help\nFiadjoe. The fact that the Parliament passed comprehensive\nlegislation to protect women and children’s rights, and that the\npractice of Trokosi was banned pursuant to this legislation,\ncertainly provides evidence that the Ghanaian authorities\nrecognized the existence and nature of Trokosi and were willing\n\n                                67\n\fto take steps to combat it. The report’s statement that “human\nrights organizations believe that the goal of eradicating Trokosi\nis achievable with the new law” also provides support for the\nBIA’s conclusion that invoking the aid of Ghanaian authorities\nwould not have been futile. There is no basis in the record to\nbelieve that these human rights organizations were offering\nanything less than an honest assessment of the situation, and if\nas of 2000 they reasonably believed Trokosi could be eradicated,\nthen it is not for this Court to suggest that the BIA acted\nunreasonably in giving weight to their views.\n\n        The State Department report also recounts empirical\nevidence in support of the view that the Ghanaian government’s\nanti-Trokosi efforts were having significant success.\nSpecifically, Ghana’s Commission for Human Rights and\nAdministrative Justice (“CHRAJ”), working with an NGO, had\nsecured the release of approximately 2,800 Trokosi slaves and\nretrained them for new professions. According to the State\nDepartment report, the CHRAJ is an autonomous government\ncommission established pursuant to the Ghanaian constitution.\nThus, contrary to the implications of the majority opinion, the\nState Department report indicates that Ghana’s anti-Trokosi\nefforts were being implemented by a government agency acting\nin partnership with various NGOs. According to that report, this\ncollaborative effort relied heavily upon negotiation rather than\ndirect confrontation as a means of aiding the victims of Trokosi\npractices. By ignoring the CHRAJ initiative, the majority\ndismisses the BIA’s findings concerning Ghana’s anti-Trokosi\n\n                               68\n\fefforts, and wrongly equates the absence of criminal prosecution\nwith an absence of effective aid for women threatened by\nTrokosi practices.\n\n        The majority also challenges the significance of the State\nDepartment’s description of Ghana’s anti-Trokosi efforts by\nquoting a portion of the report that addresses in a more general\nsense the problem of violence against women in Ghana.\nHowever, the concluding sentences of the paragraph quoted by\nthe majority provide further support for the BIA’s conclusion\nthat Fiadjoe had not shown that the government of Ghana was\nunwilling or unable to protect her. The report states that 1998\nlegislation doubled the mandatory sentence for rape, and that in\nlate 1998\n\n       the police administration established a ‘women\n       and juvenile unit’ to handle cases involving\n       domestic violence, child abuse, and juvenile\n       offenses. Located in Accra and Kumasi, the unit\n       works closely with the Department of Social\n       Welfare, FIDA, and the Legal Aid Board. During\n       the year, the Accra Branch of this unit recorded\n       over 530 cases, including 181 defilement cases,\n       35 rapes, 6 cases of incest, 17 indecent assualts,\n       86 instances of assault and wife battery, 6\n       abductions, and 200 neglect cases.\n\n\n\n\n                               69\n\fAR:341-42. The majority does not recite this evidence,\nalthough it was part of the record before the BIA. It reinforces\nmy view that under the deferential substantial evidence standard,\nthe record as a whole contains adequate support for the BIA’s\nfindings concerning the issue of government protection in\nGhana.10\n\n        The majority also argues that Fiadjoe’s own testimony\nshows that the government of Ghana would have been unwilling\nor unable to help Fiadjoe. I do not believe Fiadjoe’s testimony\nconcerning her grandmother can bear the weight the majority\nplaces upon it. Fiadjoe’s affidavit and testimony are vague\nconcerning what Fiadjoe’s grandmother told the police, and the\ndetails that were allegedly provided could have left the police\nbelieving that Fiadjoe’s situation involved a family dispute\nconcerning excessive corporal punishment.\n\n       Fiajdoe’s hearing testimony regarding this issue consists\n\n\n       10\n          In assessing the BIA’s findings, the majority chastises the\nBIA for failing to address a June 1996 London newspaper article\nentitled “Slave of the Fetish.” This article was submitted by Fiadjoe’s\ncounsel during the proceedings below, and was part of the\nadministrative record before the BIA. However, this article predates\nby several years Ghana’s anti-Trokosi efforts described in the 2000\nState Department report discussed above, and it consists primarily of\nambiguous statements that shed little light on whether Fiadjoe had\nmet her burden of showing that the Ghanaian authorities were\nunwilling or unable to protect her.\n\n                                  70\n\fof the following exchange:\n\n      Q.     Okay, did you ever try to go to the police yourself\n             to tell them what was happening to you?\n\n      A.     No.\n\n      Q.     Why not?\n\n      A.     Because of how          they   were    telling   my\n             grandmother.\n\n      Judge to Ms. Fiadjoe\n\n      Q.     Because of what, ma’am?\n\n      A.     Because they always tell my grandmother that\n             he’s discipline and my grandmother, I full of\n             shame to tell anybody my father is sleeping with\n             me.\n\nAR:251. Fiadjoe’s affidavit submitted in support of her asylum\napplication contains slightly more detail:\n\n      14.    My grandmother told the police about these\n             beatings. My grandmother told me the police\n             only said that ‘your father is just trying to\n             discipline you.’\n\n      15.    In 1997 my grandmother went to the police after\n             my father had poured boiling water on me when\n             I refused to take his abuse. Again, the police said\n             this was a father’s right to discipline his children.\n\n\n                              71\n\f       16.    My [grand]mother did not tell the police that my\n              father was sexually abusing me. It would shame\n              our family and she could not do that.\n\nAR:317-18.\n\n        In my view, particularly in light of the record evidence of\nGhana’s anti-Trokosi efforts, the limited information contained\nin Fiadjoe’s affidavit and hearing testimony cannot reasonably\nbe relied upon as determinative of what the Ghanaian authorities\nwould have done had they been informed of Fiadjoe’s father’s\nTrokosi-related abuse. The majority acknowledges that the\nGhanaian authorities were never informed of “the sexual aspect\nof the abuse,” but fails to acknowledge the significance of this\nfact. The most that can be extracted from Fiadjoe’s affidavit\nand testimony is that the local police failed to investigate when\nher grandmother twice told them that Fiadjoe was being\nphysically abused by her father. However, Fiadjoe has not\nsought asylum simply because she was a victim of child abuse.\nFiadjoe’s brief, consistent with the requirements of the INA,\nargues that she was persecuted “on account of” her membership\nin a particular social group, which she defines as “Ghanaian\nwomen from the Ewe tribe in the Volta Region who have been\nsubjected to or face being subjected to the practice of Trokosi\nand who oppose this practice.” See 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A).\nThus, it is specifically the sexual aspect of her father’s abuse,\ncombined with its ostensibly “religious” motivation, that has\npermitted Fiadjoe to seek asylum as one who has suffered\npersecution “on account of” a protected ground. It seems\nanomalous to hold, as the majority does, that Fiadjoe’s native\ngovernment would not protect her from persecution inflicted “on\naccount of” her social group, when the Ghanaian government\nwas not informed of Fiadjoe’s membership in this social group\n\n                                72\n\for of the nature and extent of the abuse that has given rise to her\nclaim for asylum.11\n\n       Notwithstanding any shortcomings in Fiadjoe’s\ntestimony, I am willing to assume arguendo that a reasonable\nfactfinder could rely on this testimony to conclude that Ms.\nFiadjoe had shown that the government of Ghana was unwilling\nor unable to protect her. The majority, however, holds that a\nreasonable factfinder would be compelled to take this approach.\nBased on all of the record evidence discussed above, I simply\ncannot agree, and thus I believe it is inappropriate to invoke\nFiadjoe’s testimony as the basis for displacing the BIA’s\njudgment with our own.12\n\n       Ms. Fiadjoe’s account rightfully evokes our sympathies,\n\n\n       11\n         I share the majority’s concern with what appears from the\ntranscript to have been the unnecessarily hostile demeanor of the IJ\nduring Ms. Fiadjoe’s hearing. However, the record as a whole\nsupports the BIA’s decision to accord limited weight to Fiadjoe’s\naccount concerning the interaction between her grandmother and the\nGhanaian police. Ms. Fiadjoe’s affidavit, prepared in advance of the\nhearing with the assistance of counsel, contains little detail\nconcerning the specific information given by her grandmother to the\nGhanaian police, and the affidavit acknowledges that the police were\nnever informed of the alleged ritual sexual abuse that is the basis of\nFiadjoe’s claim for asylum.\n       12\n         The majority also recounts Fiadjoe’s testimony concerning\nher unsuccessful efforts to relocate away from her father, and asserts\nthat “Ms. Fiadjoe’s own experiences demonstrate that where a\nTrokosi slave is involved the police will not intervene.” Maj. Op. 52.\nThis statement on its face seems to me inconsistent with the\nmajority’s own acknowledgment that the Ghanaian authorities were\nnever informed that Fiadjoe was a “Trokosi slave.”\n\n                                 73\n\fand I would be less concerned with the majority’s approach if\nwe had the luxury of deciding each case based solely on our own\nassessment of the facts underlying a petitioner’s claim.\nHowever, that is not an approach we are permitted to take as an\nappellate court reviewing agency action, and I am concerned by\nthe implications of the majority’s approach for future\nimmigration appeals. Our Court has little precedential authority\nevaluating asylum claims based upon alleged private persecution\nthat a foreign government is purportedly unwilling or unable to\ncontrol. I fear the majority’s approach sets us down the wrong\npath for reviewing these difficult issues. By emphasizing only\nwhat it finds in the record to cast doubt on the effectiveness of\nGhana’s anti-Trokosi efforts, the majority overlooks or\ndiscounts the record evidence to the contrary. This approach\nrisks a deluge of claims from applicants who have faced private\nviolence and who can argue that a lack of resources constrains\nthe effectiveness of law enforcement efforts in their native\ncountries. It also raises the troubling specter of frequent judicial\npronouncements condemning the law enforcement practices of\nforeign governments, an outcome our highly deferential standard\nof review is designed to avoid.\n\n       In my view, the majority’s approach is effectively one of\nde novo review. The law forbids us from substituting our\njudgment for that of the BIA, and it provides no exception for\ncases where the BIA has had to address whether a foreign\ngovernment would be willing and able to protect one of its own\ncitizens.\n\n       I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                                 74\n\f75\n\f</pre>",
