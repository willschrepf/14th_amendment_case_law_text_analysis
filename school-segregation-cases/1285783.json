        In 1996, the United States (the “Government”) sued the New York City Board of\n\n20   Education and related parties (the “City Defendants”) claiming a violation of Title VII’s\n\n21   prohibition of disparate impact selection measures. The suit alleged that the City had, in hiring\n\n22   Custodians and Custodian Engineers (“CEs”) for its schools, (1) used, on three separate\n\n23   occasions, civil service examinations which discriminated against blacks and Hispanics, and (2)\n\n24   used recruiting practices which discriminated against blacks, Hispanics, Asians, and women.\n\n25   The parties entered into a settlement agreement in 1999 and asked the district court to enter it as\n\n26   a consent decree. The magistrate judge (Levy, M.J.)—who had jurisdiction by consent—\n\n27   approved the entire agreement, despite objections that primarily came from incumbent\n\n28   employees who were denied leave to intervene in the suit. The incumbent employees were\n\n29   unaffected by many of the agreement’s provisions, but they objected to four paragraphs that\n\n30   provided permanent appointments and retroactive competitive seniority to 63 black, Hispanic,\n\n                                                                     5\n\f 1   Asian, or female individuals, the “Offerees.”2 The City Defendants implemented the disputed\n\n 2   parts of the settlement while the incumbent employees’ appeal from their exclusion was pending.\n\n 3   In 2001, this Court vacated and remanded, holding that the district court should have permitted\n\n 4   the incumbent employees to intervene.\n\n 5            After the remand, the incumbent employees asked the district court to have the case sent\n\n 6   to a district judge rather than the magistrate judge; this request was granted. They then brought\n\n 7   two reverse-discrimination lawsuits against the City under § 703(a) of Title VII and the Equal\n\n 8   Protection Clause (via 42 U.S.C. § 1983); these cases were consolidated with the original 1996\n\n 9   Government lawsuit. The new lawsuits sought equitable relief and damages. The incumbent\n\n10   employees also requested class certification. Meanwhile, the Government decided that it would\n\n11   defend the settlement agreement only in part. This prompted two groups of beneficiaries of the\n\n12   settlement to intervene to defend the retroactive seniority that the settlement had granted them.\n\n13   One group, the Arroyo Intervenors, consisted of ten Offerees who had taken and failed a\n\n14   challenged exam; the other group, the Caldero Intervenors, consisted of twenty-two Offerees\n\n15   who had not taken any challenged exam.\n\n16            After years of contentious litigation, extensive discovery, and a set of three opinions\n\n17   spanning a total of approximately 150 pages, the district court (Block, J.) entered a final\n\n18   judgment. It held that some of the retroactive seniority provided by the settlement agreement\n\n19   violated Title VII, and that some of the retroactive seniority that did not violate Title VII violated\n\n20   the Equal Protection Clause. But, the court concluded that a significant remainder of the\n\n21   retroactive seniority was lawful. In particular, the court held (1) that the retroactive seniority of\n\n\n     2\n         As discussed below, the number of Offerees later decreased slightly.\n\n                                                       6\n\f 1   the test-failer Offerees3 did not violate Title VII or the Equal Protection Clause, except insofar as\n\n 2   layoff seniority4 was granted to individuals who were not actual victims of discrimination; (2)\n\n 3   that some of the test-failers were actual victims and others were not; (3) that the female non-test-\n\n 4   failer Offerees’ retroactive seniority did not violate Title VII or the Equal Protection Clause,\n\n 5   except that their layoff seniority violated both Title VII and the Equal Protection Clause since—\n\n 6   because there was no prima facie case of recruiting discrimination with respect to them—none of\n\n 7   them were actual victims of such discrimination; and (4) that the minority male non-test-failers’\n\n 8   retroactive seniority did not violate Title VII, but did violate the Equal Protection Clause. As a\n\n 9   remedy the court entered a declaratory judgment, accompanied by schedules specifying the\n\n10   extent to which each individual’s retroactive seniority was lawful. The class of incumbent\n\n11   employees was also certified, but their damage claims were rejected. Finally, the district court\n\n12   declined to enter any part of the disputed paragraphs of the settlement agreement into a consent\n\n13   decree.\n\n14             On appeal, the district court’s refusal to enter a consent decree is not challenged. The\n\n15   only disputes before us are the incumbent employees’ lawsuits, which claim that the City\n\n16   Defendants’ (voluntary) implementation of the settlement agreement violated § 703(a) of Title\n\n17   VII and 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The Title VII claim requires us to decide the applicability of Ricci v.\n\n18   DeStefano, 129 S. Ct. 2658 (2009), which was decided after the district court issued its decision\n\n19   in this case.\n\n\n     3\n       Although only some of the Offerees who failed a test intervened in the case (the Arroyo\n     Intervenors), the district court’s holding applies to all Offerees who took a test, without regard to\n     whether they intervened.\n     4\n       The City Defendants use a traditional “last hired, first fired” layoff seniority system for\n     Custodians and CEs.\n\n                                                        7\n\f 1           The district court’s Title VII analysis was based on the “affirmative action” framework of\n\n 2   Johnson v. Transp. Agency, Santa Clara County, 480 U.S. 616 (1987), and United Steel Workers\n\n 3   of Am. v. Weber, 443 U.S. 193 (1979). We hold that, contrary to the pre-Ricci law in this\n\n 4   Circuit, Johnson and Weber do not apply to all race- or gender-conscious employer actions. In\n\n 5   light of Ricci, the “manifest imbalance” and “no unnecessary trammeling” analysis of those\n\n 6   cases extends, at most, to circumstances in which an employer has undertaken a race- or gender-\n\n 7   conscious affirmative action plan designed to benefit all members of a racial or gender class in a\n\n 8   forward-looking manner only. Where, as here, the employer instead provides individualized\n\n 9   race- or gender-conscious benefits as a remedy for previous disparate impact, the employer must\n\n10   satisfy the requirements of Ricci, not Johnson and Weber, in order to avoid disparate-treatment\n\n11   liability. Under Ricci, the employer must show a strong basis in evidence that, at the time the\n\n12   race- or gender-conscious action was taken, the employer was faced with disparate-impact\n\n13   liability and that the race- or gender-conscious action was necessary to avoid or remedy that\n\n14   liability.\n\n15           In addition to our central holding, we address several other issues. We discuss a few\n\n16   matters related to the identification of those individuals who, the City Defendants had a strong\n\n17   basis in evidence to believe, were victims of disparate impact and, therefore, as to whom the\n\n18   retroactive-seniority provided in the settlement agreement was a proper remedy. We also discuss\n\n19   what remedies the district court might properly consider, and we advise the district court that\n\n20   while it may be appropriate to strip certain settlement beneficiaries of the retroactive seniority\n\n21   they received from the settlement agreement, it is not correct to strip them of seniority stemming\n\n22   from their permanent appointments. Because it is possible that the case can be resolved on Title\n\n\n                                                       8\n\f 1   VII grounds, we decline at this time to address the important and difficult Equal Protection\n\n 2   Clause questions that attach to the case. Finally, we affirm the district court’s grant of class\n\n 3   certification because, in so certifying, the district court did not abuse its discretion.\n\n 4           Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court’s judgment in part, VACATE it in part, and\n\n 5   REMAND the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n 6                                  Factual and Procedural Background\n\n 7   I.      The Parties\n\n 8           This appeal stems from three lawsuits involving five parties or groups of parties, who,\n\n 9   from different directions, attack just about every aspect of the district court’s judgment. The\n\n10   incumbent employees (the “Brennan Plaintiffs”)5 have appealed, and the Caldero Intervenors and\n\n11   the Government have cross-appealed. Since the City Defendants have withdrawn their cross-\n\n12   appeal and have not submitted briefs, the four parties before us are:\n\n13                  The Brennan Plaintiffs, who seek to invalidate as much of the four challenged\n\n14                   paragraphs of the settlement as possible.\n\n15                  The Arroyo Intervenors, who seek to defend the settlement for Offerees who\n\n16                   failed a challenged exam.\n\n17                  The Caldero Intervenors, who seek to defend the settlement for Offerees who did\n\n18                   not take any challenged exam.\n\n\n\n\n     5\n       The district court referred to the incumbent employees as the “Brennan Intervenors” because\n     they intervened in the original 1996 case brought by the United States. Because it is the two\n     subsequent cases brought by the Brennan Plaintiffs, and not the 1996 case, that are the focus of\n     this appeal, we refer to this group of individuals by the role they play in those cases.\n\n                                                        9\n\f 1                  The Government, which wishes to defend some portions of the settlement, but not\n\n 2                   others.\n\n 3   II.    General Factual Background\n\n 4          The focus of the Government’s 1996 lawsuit was the allegedly discriminatory hiring of\n\n 5   Custodians and Custodian Engineers by the City Defendants.\n\n 6          A.       Custodians and Custodian Engineers\n\n7           The Board of Education6 (the “Board”) employs Custodians and Custodian Engineers7 to\n\n8    take care of the approximately 1200 buildings in the City’s school system. Custodian and CE\n\n 9   positions are desirable supervisory jobs with good pay8 and civil-service protections. Each\n\n10   Custodian or CE is assigned to a school, and he or she supervises all the handymen and cleaners\n\n11   at that school. The Custodian or CE also has the responsibility for the upkeep, cleanliness, and\n\n12   safety of the assigned school. The main difference between Custodians and CEs is that CEs have\n\n13   more experience and a difficult-to-obtain stationary engineer’s license. During the times at issue\n\n14   in this case, the Board employed over 900 Custodians and CEs.\n\n15          Custodians and CEs are paid through a century-old, arcane, and idiosyncratic system\n\n16   known as the “indirect system.” See generally Beck v. Bd. of Educ. of City of New York, 268\n\n17   A.D. 644, 646-47 (N.Y.A.D. 2d Dep’t 1945). Under this system, the Custodian or CE is both a\n\n\n     6\n       The New York City Board of Education has been replaced by the Department of Education, but\n     we will continue to use the original party’s name, as do the parties to this litigation.\n     7\n       In 2000, these two job titles were changed to Custodian Engineer Level I and Custodian\n     Engineer Level II, respectively. At the same time, “broadbanding” occurred, which meant that it\n     became possible to be promoted from one position to the other without taking a new civil service\n     exam. The parties use the old job titles, and so will we.\n     8\n       The pay is lower for the first five years of a Custodian’s or CE’s employment. When a\n     Custodian or CE is first hired, the pay is 70% of what it would be for someone with five or more\n     years on the job. It is phased up to 100% over that period. Thus, newly hired Custodians or CEs\n\n                                                     10\n\f 1   civil servant and an independent contractor. The Board allots each Custodian a lump sum of\n\n 2   money based on the size and other characteristics of the assigned school. The Custodian uses\n\n 3   some of this money to hire cleaners and helpers and to pay for supplies, and, up to a specified\n\n 4   limit, he retains the rest for himself. The Board does not tell Custodians how to clean and\n\n 5   maintain things or whom to hire; it only tells them whether the school is being cleaned and\n\n 6   maintained satisfactorily. Custodians and CEs thus, purportedly, have an incentive to maintain\n\n 7   their schools adequately but in a cost-effective manner. Id.\n\n 8           B.      The Importance of Seniority\n\n 9           The seniority of a Custodian or CE is important in several ways, only three of which are\n\n10   relevant to the appeal before us: seniority improves a Custodian or CE’s ability (1) to get\n\n11   transfers to more desirable schools; (2) to get Temporary Care Assignments (“TCAs”)9; and (3)\n\n12   to avoid being laid off. At least for transfers and layoffs, the effect of seniority is specified in a\n\n13   collective bargaining agreement between the Board and the union representing Custodians and\n\n14   CEs, Local 891 of the International Union of Operating Engineers (“Local 891”). Before\n\n15   discussing those matters, it is worth noting one way in which seniority is not at issue in this\n\n16   appeal: some seniority (which is termed “non-competitive” seniority) concerns a Custodian or\n\n17   CE’s relationship with the Board in ways that do not affect the holder of that seniority’s\n\n18   relationship to other Custodians or CEs. For example, the seniority that affects the amount of\n\n19   pay a Custodian or CE receives is, in this sense, “non-competitive.” See supra note 8.\n\n20                   1.      Transfers\n\n21           Because Custodians and CEs earn higher salaries when they work in larger schools, it is\n\n\n\n     sometimes earn less money than their longer-serving subordinates.\n\n                                                       11\n\f 1   desirable, when the opportunity arises, for them to transfer to larger schools. When there is a\n\n 2   vacancy at a school, seniority plays a crucial role in determining who gets the transfer.10\n\n 3   Pursuant to the “rating and transfer plan” in the collective bargaining agreement for Custodians\n\n 4   and CEs, each school in the system is assigned to a particular “seniority bracket” based on its\n\n 5   square footage.11 CE brackets are associated with larger schools than the brackets for\n\n 6   Custodians who have the same level of experience. In addition, some schools are available only\n\n 7   to CEs, while some other schools are available to Custodians only if the Custodians have a\n\n 8   refrigeration license.12\n\n 9           Every few months or so, as needed, the Board issues a Vacancy List to Custodians and\n\n10   CEs. The Vacancy List sets out the schools with a Custodian or CE vacancy, and any Custodian\n\n11   or CE who is eligible to transfer may bid for open schools and specify his or her order of\n\n12   preference.13 Custodians and CEs may bid for a school above their seniority bracket, so long as\n\n13   the bidder is not a Custodian bidding for a CE-only school, or a Custodian without a\n\n14   refrigeration license bidding for a school that requires such a license. Then the Board looks at\n\n15   who has applied for each vacant school. If only one eligible person bids for a school, then that\n\n16   person gets the school. The vast majority of vacant schools do not result in competition; either\n\n\n     9\n       The significance of TCAs is discussed in section 2, infra.\n     10\n        For transfer purposes, seniority is based on the number of years in which an employee has\n     received a satisfactory rating in his or her current job title. A Custodian Engineer who\n     previously earned satisfactory ratings as a Custodian is not allowed to count his or her years of\n     Custodian experience for transfer seniority.\n     11\n        The three seniority brackets for Custodians are 1-5 years, 5-10 years, and 10 or more years.\n     The four seniority brackets for Custodian Engineers are 1-5 years, 5-10 years, 10-15 years, and\n     15 or more years.\n     12\n        A refrigeration license is a certificate of qualification for refrigerating machine operator.\n     13\n        Certain Custodians and CEs, such as those with pending disciplinary matters and those who\n     have transferred within the last two years, are not eligible to transfer.\n\n                                                     12\n\f 1   nobody or only one person bids for them. The most desirable vacancies, however, receive\n\n 2   multiple bids. In such cases, if at least one bidder is in or above the school’s seniority bracket,\n\n 3   then any Custodian or CE who is below that seniority bracket will not get the school. In other\n\n 4   words, a Custodian or CE can never get a school above his or her seniority bracket unless\n\n 5   nobody in or above the required seniority bracket applies for the vacancy. If two or more\n\n 6   candidates are in or above the required seniority bracket, then the transfer generally goes to the\n\n 7   applicant with the highest performance rating from his or her current school’s principal.\n\n 8   However, if any other candidate’s performance rating is within .25 points of the top candidate’s\n\n 9   performance rating, then seniority is used as a tie-breaker between them. The vacant school’s\n\n10   principal can veto a Custodian or CE, but this does not appear to be a frequent occurrence.\n\n11   Indeed, nothing in the record indicates that it has ever happened. Once an applicant is\n\n12   determined by the Board to be the top applicant for a vacant school, the applicant cannot\n\n13   withdraw his or her bid; transfer to that school is mandatory. About 1% of the schools in the\n\n14   entire system get a new Custodian or CE each time the transfer process occurs.\n\n15                  2.      Temporary Care Assignments\n\n16          Seniority also affects Temporary Care Assignments—though only slightly. When a\n\n17   temporary school vacancy results from illness, vacation, or leave, the Board fills the vacancy\n\n18   through the TCA process. Unlike the transfer process, the TCA process is not found in the\n\n19   collective bargaining agreement. The record conflicts as to whether the TCA process is\n\n20   governed by any contract negotiated with Local 891.14 A Custodian or CE who receives a TCA\n\n\n     14\n       James Lonergan, Director of Plant Operations for the Board, declared that “[t]he guidelines for\n     temporary care assignments are not negotiated [with Local 891] and are modified in terms of the\n     need of the Board of Education.” But Salvatore Calderone, also of the Board, testified at\n\n                                                      13\n\f1    will, for the duration of the TCA—usually two months—look after the TCA school in addition to\n\n2    his or her regularly assigned school. During that time, the salary of the Custodian or CE will be\n\n3    increased by 75%—or 100% in the unlikely event that the TCA lasts more than six months—\n\n4    even though he or she is not required to put in any additional time on the job. A Custodian or\n\n5    CE can reasonably expect to get a TCA once every two years.\n\n6            The process for assigning TCAs is somewhat different from the transfer process, but\n\n7    seniority still plays a role. The record is, however, unclear as to how significant that role is.\n\n8    Once a Custodian or CE has at least one year of experience, he or she is added to the TCA\n\n9    waitlist for the district in which his or her regularly assigned school is located, or for adjacent\n\n10   districts.15 As TCAs arise, they are assigned to the Custodian or CE at the top of the list, so long\n\n11   as the TCA school does not require a license or special skill that the top person does not have.\n\n12   Upon finishing the TCA, the Custodian or CE is returned to the bottom of the list.\n\n13           Because of the rotation system, seniority seems to play only a relatively minor role in the\n\n14   awarding of TCAs. The district court does, however, suggest a way in which seniority might\n\n15   make a difference. According to that court, there are three separate TCA lists in each district:\n\n16   one for CEs, one for Custodians with at least 15 years’ seniority, and one for other Custodians.\n\n17   United States v. N.Y. City Bd. of Educ., 448 F. Supp. 2d 397, 411-12 (E.D.N.Y. 2006)\n\n18   [hereinafter NYC Board III]. None of the parties’ briefs mentions three lists, nor do these briefs\n\n19   cite any part of the record supporting this proposition. But, if the district court’s statement is\n\n\n\n     deposition that “[t]here are temporary care guidelines that were negotiated between the\n     Department of Education and Local 891,” and that, although they are not found in the collective\n     bargaining agreement, they are contained in “[l]ike a side letter kind of thing.”\n     15\n        The record does not indicate whether the Custodian or CE would be added to separate lists for\n     his or her district and for each adjacent district, or instead added only to his or her district’s list,\n\n                                                        14\n\f 1   correct, then increasing a Custodian’s seniority might increase the size of the 15-year TCA list\n\n 2   and thereby work to the detriment of other Custodians on that list. This would correspondingly\n\n 3   benefit other Custodians who are on the fewer-than-15-years TCA list by decreasing that list’s\n\n 4   length. Similarly, it is to the advantage of any particular Custodian or CE for there to be as few\n\n 5   as possible other Custodians or CEs with at least one year of seniority in the same or adjacent\n\n 6   districts. For then it would not take as long to get back to the top of the list after a TCA\n\n 7   assignment.\n\n 8                    3.    Layoffs\n\n 9          Seniority directly determines the order in which Custodians or CEs will be laid off under\n\n10   N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law § 80(1). The statute and the CBA provide for a typical “last hired, first\n\n11   fired” system.\n\n12          C.        The Hiring Process\n\n13          During the disputed period, the hiring process included four steps for Custodians and\n\n14   three steps for CEs. First, because a Custodian or CE is a civil servant within the “competitive\n\n15   class” as defined under New York law, an applicant wishing to become a Custodian or CE had to\n\n16   pass a civil service examination.16 The City Defendants administered three disputed exams: (1)\n\n17   Exam 5040, which was given in 1985 for the Custodian position; (2) Exam 8206, which was\n\n\n\n\n     but would somehow become eligible for TCAs in adjacent districts too.\n     16\n        See N.Y. Const. art. V, § 6 (“Appointments and promotions in the civil service of the state and\n     all of the civil divisions thereof, including cities and villages, shall be made according to merit\n     and fitness to be ascertained, as far as practicable, by examination which, as far as practicable,\n     shall be competitive . . . .”); N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law § 44 (defining the “competitive class” for\n     which examinations are required); Conlin v. Aiello, 64 A.D.2d 921, 921 (N.Y.A.D. 2d Dep’t\n     1978) (“[T]he position[s] of school custodian and/or school custodian-engineer . . . are in the\n     competitive class of the classified civil service.”).\n\n                                                      15\n\f 1   given in 1989 for the CE position;17 and (3) Exam 1074, which was given in 1993 for the\n\n 2   Custodian position.\n\n 3          Second, an applicant had to submit “experience papers” explaining how the applicant\n\n 4   satisfied the minimum qualifications for the position. The minimum qualifications—a few years\n\n 5   of relevant experience for a Custodian, and a few more years plus the coveted high-pressure\n\n 6   boiler license (also known as a “stationary engineer license”) for a CE—were stated in the notice\n\n 7   for each of the aforementioned, disputed, exams. Once the exam was administered, the City\n\n 8   Defendants reviewed the experience papers for passing applicants. A finding of insufficient\n\n 9   experience could be administratively appealed. The exact proportion of appeals that overturned\n\n10   the City Defendants’ original findings is unclear and disputed, but the proportion of successful\n\n11   appeals clearly was not insignificant.18\n\n12          Third, for Exams 5040 and 1074 (the Custodian exams), but not for Exam 8206 (the CE\n\n13   exam), a practical test was required. The Exam 5040 practical was oral and it was given only to\n\n14   those applicants who had both passed the civil service exam and had had their experience papers\n\n15   accepted. Applicants were taken to the boiler room in a school in Brooklyn and asked questions\n\n16   about what they would do under various circumstances. For Exam 1074, this practical test was\n\n\n     17\n        Simultaneously with Exam 8206, the City Defendants administered Exam 8609, which was\n     identical. The only difference was that Exam 8206 was taken by members of the general public,\n     while Exam 8609 was taken by Custodians who wished to become CEs. NYC Board III, 448 F.\n     Supp. 2d at 406 n.12.\n     18\n        For example, on Exam 8206, the Government asserts that 23 out of 56, or about 41%, of the\n     individuals who passed the exam but initially had their experience papers rejected prevailed on\n     administrative appeal. And the District Court so found. NYC Board III, 448 F. Supp. 2d at 418\n     n.29. The Brennan Plaintiffs, however, suggest that the Government’s numbers for that exam\n     may also include individuals who challenged their test scores rather than their experience status.\n      For Exam 5040, the record indicates that 28 out of 132, or about 21%, of individuals initially\n     deemed unqualified won on administrative appeal.\n\n                                                     16\n\f 1   changed to a written format, so that the City Defendants could make sure that each applicant was\n\n 2   asked the same questions. Also, unlike the Exam 5040 practical, the practical for Exam 1074\n\n 3   was administered—and individuals who failed it were eliminated—before the experience papers\n\n 4   were reviewed. A small but non-trivial percentage of applicants failed the practical test.19\n\n 5          After these steps were completed, applicants who had passed the written exam, the\n\n 6   “experience papers” stage, and the practical exam (if applicable), were placed on an “eligible\n\n 7   list,” starting with the highest scorers on the written exam and ending with the lowest passing\n\n 8   scorers. When the Board needed a Custodian or CE, it would follow the “Rule of Three.” Under\n\n 9   this rule, it would call the top few people (usually three, but sometimes more if there were more\n\n10   than one vacancy) on the eligibility list for interviews. See N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law § 61(1). The\n\n11   vacancy or vacancies would then be filled by whichever ones of the interviewees were selected\n\n12   by the interviewers. Applicants who were interviewed three times without being hired would be\n\n13   removed from the eligibility list. The Board hired Custodians from the Exam 5040 eligibility list\n\n14   from Spring 1987 through Fall 1990. The Exam 8206 eligibility list was used to hire CEs from\n\n15   Spring 1991 through early 1994, and the Exam 1074 eligibility list was used for Custodians from\n\n16   early 1997 through early 2000.\n\n17          D.      Provisional Employees\n\n18          In addition to the permanent Custodians and CEs, who had to go through the above\n\n19   described process and who had competitive seniority and civil-service protections, the City\n\n20   Defendants hired “provisional” Custodians and CEs. Provisional Custodians and CEs can be\n\n\n     19\n       For Exam 5040, 678 applicants passed the practical oral exam out of 754 who took it. For\n     Exam 1074, the record does not state the exact passing rate, but a data sheet indicates that a large\n     majority of applicants who took the practical exam passed it.\n\n                                                     17\n\f 1   fired at any time, do not accrue competitive or non-competitive seniority, cannot bid for transfers\n\n 2   to other schools, cannot obtain TCAs, and have to work wherever the Board puts them. It is\n\n 3   therefore much better to be a permanent Custodian or CE than to be a provisional one. But\n\n 4   provisional Custodians and CEs have the same responsibilities at the schools to which they are\n\n 5   assigned as their permanent counterparts. And they are supposed to have the same experience\n\n 6   and, in the case of provisional CEs, the boiler license as well. Provisional Custodians and CEs\n\n 7   are hired when the Board needs Custodians and CEs but there is no appropriate eligibility list\n\n 8   from which to hire permanent employees. See N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law § 65.\n\n 9   III.   The Government’s Investigation and Lawsuit\n\n10          The U.S. Department of Justice began to investigate possible discrimination in the hiring\n\n11   of permanent Custodians and CEs in the early 1990s. A 1993 demographic survey revealed that\n\n12   more than 99% of the permanent Custodian and CE workforce was male, and 92% was white. In\n\n13   contrast, blacks constituted about 20% of the qualified labor pool for these positions, Hispanics\n\n14   made up about 19% and women about 8% of the pool. A 1996 demographic survey showed\n\n15   similar results. It also appeared (as was later confirmed by the investigation) that racial\n\n16   minorities and women were much more likely to be hired as provisional Custodians or CEs than\n\n17   as permanent Custodians or CEs, even though the qualifications for both were the same.20 These\n\n18   data aroused the Government’s suspicion that something in the permanent hiring process was\n\n19   discriminatory.\n\n20          Based on a statistical analysis of the results of the investigation, the Government sued the\n\n\n     20\n      As of 1997, 91% of permanent custodians and CEs were white males, about 8% were minority\n     males, and less than 1% were women. By contrast, 72% of provisional custodians and CEs were\n     white males, 16% were minority males, and more than 12% were women.\n\n                                                      18\n\f 1   City Defendants on January 30, 1996. The Government originally made both pattern-and-\n\n 2   practice claims (which require proof of intentional discrimination) and disparate-impact claims.\n\n 3   But it ultimately pursued only the disparate-impact claims. Two sets of these were asserted.\n\n 4          In the first, the Government alleged that some of the tests employed brought about\n\n 5   discriminatory results. Specifically, the claim was that Exams 5040, 8206 and 1074 had a\n\n 6   disparate impact on blacks and Hispanics. This allegation was based on a report from two\n\n 7   statisticians, who concluded that the statistical significance of the disparities in passage rates\n\n 8   between white, black, and Hispanic takers of those three exams21 was overwhelming—it ranged\n\n 9   from 2 to nearly 14 standard deviations. See NYC Board III, 448 F. Supp. 2d at 407.\n\n10          The second set of claims, the recruiting claims, alleged that the City Defendants’\n\n11   recruiting practices had a disparate impact on blacks, Hispanics, Asians, and women. In support\n\n12   of these claims, the Government produced a report by Dr. Orley Ashenfelter, a labor economist.\n\n13   The report said that the number of blacks, Hispanics, Asians, and women who took each of the\n\n14   three disputed exams was lower than the number that would be expected based on the\n\n15   representation of qualified individuals in the overall labor pool. Dr. Ashenfelter found that the\n\n16   differences were statistically significant at the 5% level, and for some groups the probability that\n\n17   the differences were the result of chance was much lower. Although Dr. Ashenfelter did not\n\n18   offer any opinion as to the cause for these disparities, the Government asserted that they resulted\n\n19   from limited advertising and word-of-mouth referrals that had a disparate impact on women and\n\n\n     21\n       No conclusion about Exam 8609, the exam for permanent Custodians who were applying to\n     become Custodian Engineers, was drawn, because the sample sizes were too small. Only 6\n     blacks and 3 Hispanics took that exam. Exam 8609 was, however, considered in the settlement\n     agreement that is discussed below, presumably because it was identical to Exam 8206. See\n     supra note 17.\n\n                                                       19\n\f 1   minorities.\n\n 2   IV.    The Settlement\n\n 3          By 1999, extensive discovery had been conducted, but the Government had not moved\n\n 4   for summary judgment and the case had not gone to trial. Before the Government had attempted\n\n 5   to prove its case in court, the Government and the City Defendants entered into settlement\n\n 6   negotiations, which concluded with the signing of a settlement agreement. Although much of\n\n 7   the agreement did not give rise to any objections from third parties, four paragraphs, numbered\n\n 8   13-16, came under attack. Only those four paragraphs, and the consequences of their\n\n 9   implementation, are at issue on this appeal.\n\n10          A.        Settlement Terms\n\n11          Paragraph 13 provided that all “Offerees” who were serving as provisional Custodians or\n\n12   CEs as of the date the court approved the settlement agreement would be granted equivalent\n\n13   permanent positions. “Offeree” was defined earlier in the agreement to include two groups: (a)\n\n14   all black, Hispanic, Asian, or female individuals who were employed as permanent or\n\n15   provisional Custodians or CEs as of the date of approval of the agreement; and (b) all black,\n\n16   Hispanic, Asian, or female individuals who had taken one of the challenged exams and had been\n\n17   hired as provisional Custodians or CEs after the date of the agreement but before court approval\n\n18   of the agreement. The list of the 54 people falling into group (a) was attached as Appendix A to\n\n19   the agreement.\n\n20          Paragraphs 14-16 gave the Offerees retroactive seniority in accordance with the\n\n21   following terms:\n\n\n\n\n                                                    20\n\f 1           For any Offeree listed in Appendix A of the agreement who had not taken a challenged\n\n 2            exam, the retroactive seniority date was the date of his or her provisional hiring.\n\n 3           For any Offeree listed in Appendix A of the agreement who had taken a challenged\n\n 4            Custodian exam, the retroactive seniority date was the earlier of (i) his or her provisional\n\n 5            hiring date, or (ii) the “Median Date”22 for the challenged exam that he or she took,\n\n 6            provided that if he or she had taken more than one exam then the earlier median date\n\n 7            applied.\n\n 8           For Offerees not listed in Appendix A of the agreement—those Custodian Offerees in\n\n 9            group (b), i.e., those hired as provisionals after the agreement but before court approval\n\n10            of it—the retroactive seniority date was the earliest provisional hire date for that\n\n11            Offeree’s job title, as listed in an earlier stipulation regarding provisional hires. Thus, if\n\n12            the Offeree was a provisional Custodian, he or she would get the earliest provisional hire\n\n13            date for Custodians, which was February 28, 1992. If the Offeree was a provisional CE,\n\n14            he or she would get the earliest provisional hire date for CEs, which was April 13, 1990.\n\n15            The agreement provided that the retroactive seniority dates would “apply for all purposes\n\n16   for which seniority is applied except any applicable probation requirement.” Accordingly, in\n\n17   addition to the TCA, transfer, and layoff benefits that are in dispute, the seniority dates provided\n\n18   various non-competitive benefits, which are not at issue here.\n\n19            B.     Court Approval\n\n20            After the Government and the City Defendants agreed to the settlement, it went to\n\n\n     22\n       The “Median Date” for each exam was the midpoint of the hiring period for that exam. The\n     median dates were: January 23, 1989 for Exam 5040; October 8, 1992 for Exam 8206; February\n     14, 1992 for Exam 8609; and October 27, 1997 for Exam 1074.\n\n                                                        21\n\f 1   Magistrate Judge Levy—to whose jurisdiction, as mentioned earlier, the parties had consented\n\n 2   pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(c)—for a fairness hearing, because the parties sought to have the\n\n 3   agreement entered as a consent decree. See United States v. N.Y. City Bd. of Educ., 85 F. Supp.\n\n 4   2d 130, 135 (E.D.N.Y. 2000) [hereinafter NYC Board I], vacated and remanded, Brennan v.\n\n 5   N.Y.C. Bd. of Educ., 260 F.3d 123 (2d Cir. 2001) [hereinafter NYC Board II]. The district court\n\n 6   gave notice and opportunity to object. Cf. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(n) (preventing subsequent\n\n 7   challenges to employment practices implementing a consent judgment if notice and opportunity\n\n 8   to object have been given). There were over 300 objections, about half of which were form\n\n 9   letters. NYC Board I, 85 F. Supp. 2d at 134 & n.3. Three objectors, who were white male\n\n10   incumbent permanent Custodians or CEs, moved to intervene: John Brennan, James G. Ahearn,\n\n11   and Kurt Brunkhorst. Id. at 134-35.\n\n12          The Magistrate Judge determined that the Government had made out a prima facie case\n\n13   of disparate impact for both the testing and recruiting claims. Id. at 141-45. Next, he\n\n14   determined that the settlement was fair and reasonable. He rejected the objections of Brennan et\n\n15   al., along with other objections not relevant here. In particular, he noted that the settlement\n\n16   “avoided the need for a complex, expensive, and lengthy trial,” and that extensive discovery had\n\n17   already taken place. Id. at 146. He also said that the settlement was consistent with the\n\n18   objectives of Title VII; and that, although it was the Board and not Brennan, Ahearn, and\n\n19   Brunkhorst who bore the responsibility for the past discrimination the suit and agreement sought\n\n20   to correct, the effect of the Offerees’ retroactive seniority on existing permanent Custodians and\n\n21   CEs was minimal. Id. at 146-51. Finally, the Magistrate Judge rejected the argument of\n\n22   Brennan et al. that they were entitled to intervene as of right pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil\n\n\n                                                      22\n\f 1   Procedure 24(a)(2). The court concluded that they did not have a protected interest in their\n\n 2   seniority because (1) the remedies afforded the Offerees were “designed only to return\n\n 3   employees to the positions they would have been in but for the alleged discrimination,” NYC\n\n 4   Board I, 85 F. Supp. 2d at 155, and (2) the possibility that the Offerees’ retroactive seniority\n\n 5   would affect the would-be intervenors was too “remote and speculative” to constitute a\n\n6    cognizable interest, id. at 156. Accordingly, the Magistrate Judge approved the settlement and\n\n 7   denied the motion to intervene. Id. at 157.\n\n 8   V.     The Settlement Is Implemented\n\n 9          Shortly after the Magistrate Judge’s approval of the settlement, the City Defendants\n\n10   began implementing the agreement. They notified 63 Offerees—the 54 individuals listed in\n\n11   Appendix A to the agreement, plus nine other individuals—that they were entitled to relief under\n\n12   the agreement, if they agreed to release all discrimination claims against the City Defendants. 59\n\n13   Offerees took the settlement, three resigned, and one declined the settlement. These 59 Offerees\n\n14   received permanent status, retroactive seniority, or both.\n\n15          For transfer and layoff purposes, the retroactive seniority operated as one would expect.\n\n16   The Offerees’ retroactive seniority was effective for both the seniority-bracket stage and the tie-\n\n17   breaker stage of the transfer process. And if layoffs were ever to occur, Offerees would be\n\n18   treated for purposes of the last-hired, first-fired rule as having been hired on their retroactive\n\n19   seniority dates. For TCA purposes, however, it is unclear what happened to Offerees who got\n\n20   retroactive seniority. As the district court pointed out, the record is contradictory as to (1)\n\n21   whether Offerees who were already permanent employees immediately went to the top of the list\n\n22   or stayed where they were, and (2) whether Offerees who were not permanent employees, or\n\n\n\n                                                       23\n\f 1   who had been permanent employees for less than one year at the time they accepted the\n\n 2   settlement, were put at the top or the bottom of the list upon completing their probationary\n\n 3   periods. See NYC Board III, 448 F. Supp. 2d at 412 & n.22. It is, however, clear that, as\n\n 4   provided in the settlement agreement, the Offerees had to wait out a one-year probationary\n\n 5   period before they were added to the TCA lists.\n\n 6   VI.    The Second Circuit Vacates and Remands\n\n 7          Brennan, Ahearn and Brunkhorst appealed the Magistrate Judge’s decision to this Court.\n\n 8   In August 2001, we vacated and remanded with instructions for the district court to permit the\n\n 9   Brennan Plaintiffs to intervene. NYC Board II, 260 F.3d at 133. We held that the Magistrate\n\n10   Judge had misapplied Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a)(2). First, we rejected the Magistrate\n\n11   Judge’s argument that the Brennan Plaintiffs’ seniority rights were presumptively the result of\n\n12   illegal discrimination, because it “put the cart before the horse.” Id. at 129. Second, we held\n\n13   that an employment civil rights plaintiff or intervenor does not have to show a property interest\n\n14   in his job or its attributes in order to intervene; rather, “where a proposed intervenor’s interests\n\n15   are otherwise unrepresented in an action, the standard for intervention is no more burdensome\n\n16   than the standing requirement.” Id. at 131. Third, we held that “because the exercise of\n\n17   seniority rights has a domino effect,” a Brennan Intervenor’s “loss of a desirable transfer need\n\n18   not be directly to an Offeree . . . for the loss to be the result of the [settlement] Agreement.” Id.\n\n19   at 132. Therefore, since the Board did not adequately represent the Brennan Plaintiffs’ interests,\n\n20   the district court should have allowed them to intervene. Id. at 132-33. We declined, however,\n\n21   to address the merits of the case:\n\n22          Appellants also ask us to exercise discretionary jurisdiction and rule on the merits of\n23          the Agreement, rather than remand the case to the district court. . . . We think such a\n\n                                                       24\n\f 1            course would be ill-advised. Appellants have argued convincingly that they were\n 2            denied the opportunity to develop a record that would have permitted a full and\n 3            appropriate ruling on the fairness and constitutionality of the Agreement. Given the\n 4            heavily factual nature of these issues, we believe that the best course is to remand the\n 5            case to allow for a full development of the record.\n 6\n 7   Id. at 133 (citation omitted).\n\n 8   VII.     Proceedings on Remand\n\n 9            After remand, this case lingered in the district court for about eight years, in the course of\n\n10   which several significant things happened: (1) the Brennan Plaintiffs filed two cases that were\n\n11   consolidated with the main case; (2) the Government began to attack parts of the settlement\n\n12   agreement; (3) the Caldero and Arroyo Intervenors entered the case in response to the\n\n13   Government’ change of position; (4) additional discovery and hearings took place; and (5) the\n\n14   district court issued a set of decisions upholding most, but not all, of the settlement against the\n\n15   reverse-discrimination attacks brought by the Brennan Plaintiffs, but declining to approve the\n\n16   settlement as a consent decree.\n\n17            A.      The Brennan Plaintiffs Intervene and File a Related Complaint\n\n18            In October 2001, on remand, the Brennan Plaintiffs,23 having been permitted to intervene,\n\n19   filed a Complaint in Intervention alleging primarily that the retroactive grants of seniority in\n\n20   paragraphs 13-16 of the settlement agreement violated Title VII and the Equal Protection Clause.\n\n21   The Government moved to dismiss these claims in November 2001. On February 28, 2002,\n\n22   before that motion was fully briefed, Magistrate Judge Levy approved the undisputed portions of\n\n23   the settlement agreement, with consent of the parties.\n\n24            Because of certain arguments raised in the Government’s motion to dismiss, and because\n\n\n     23\n          Around this time two new Brennan Plaintiffs (Scott Spring and Dennis Mortensen) were added\n\n                                                        25\n\f 1   the Brennan Plaintiffs wanted to add two new individuals with damage claims (John Mitchell\n\n 2   and Eric Schauer), the Brennan Plaintiffs, not satisfied simply to intervene, filed an action on\n\n 3   January 11, 2002 (“Brennan”). In this suit, Mitchell and Schauer claimed that, in violation of\n\n 4   Title VII and 42 U.S.C. § 1983, they had each lost a transfer to an Offeree because of the City\n\n 5   Defendants’ implementation of the settlement agreement. In addition to the damage claims, all\n\n 6   the Brennan Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief against the City Defendants, DOJ,\n\n 7   and the Attorney General. The Brennan case was eventually consolidated with the\n\n 8   Government’s case in November 2003.\n\n 9          B.      The Government Changes Its Position; Offeree Interventions Result\n\n10          On April 8, 2002, the Government filed a memorandum in response to the Brennan\n\n11   Plaintiffs’ February 2002 motion for a preliminary injunction. In this memorandum, the\n\n12   Government only partially opposed the motion. The Government opposed a preliminary\n\n13   injunction against the settlement as to Offerees who had taken a challenged exam, but not as to\n\n14   Offerees who had not. Two days later, the Government withdrew its previous counsel and\n\n15   substituted new counsel.\n\n16          Next, the City Defendants moved for approval of the remaining paragraphs of the\n\n17   settlement agreement, and the Government opposed this motion as “premature.” In July 2002, a\n\n18   recruiting-claim beneficiary, Janet Caldero, learned that the Government was no longer\n\n19   defending the settlement as to Offerees such as she. She and others in her situation, having\n\n20   obtained counsel, moved to intervene in October 2002. The parties agreed to the 22 Caldero\n\n21   Intervenors’ intervention in February 2003. Around this time, the Brennan Plaintiffs also\n\n\n\n     and one (Kurt Brunkhorst) dropped out.\n\n                                                     26\n\f 1   invoked their rights as parties to object to the magistrate judge’s 28 U.S.C. § 636(c) jurisdiction\n\n 2   to render a final decision, and, as a result, the case was returned to Judge Block.\n\n 3          Then, in September 2003, the Government changed its position again, triggering yet\n\n 4   another intervention. In response to some interrogatories during discovery, the Government\n\n 5   provided a chart detailing its current thinking about which Offerees were entitled to retroactive\n\n 6   competitive seniority. This chart indicated for the first time that, in addition to the 32 Offerees\n\n 7   who had not taken an exam, as to most of whom the Government had already indicated that it\n\n 8   would not be defending the settlement, the Government would now also not be defending the\n\n 9   settlement as to some (but not all) Offerees who had taken a challenged exam. Although the\n\n10   Government did not say that this latter group of Offerees was not entitled to any retroactive\n\n11   seniority, it did say that, for competitive seniority purposes, these individuals were entitled only\n\n12   to retroactive seniority dates later—usually by about two years—than those provided for by the\n\n13   settlement agreement. The chart also denominated the Offerees who had not taken an exam as\n\n14   “recruiting claimants,” and the others as “testing claimants.” That is, the Government separated\n\n15   the Offerees into two groups, based on the stage of the hiring process at which they allegedly\n\n16   suffered discrimination. Having learned of this document, some of the affected Offerees (the\n\n17   Arroyo Intervenors) moved to intervene. Their motion was granted in July 2004.24 See NYC\n\n\n     24\n       The Government said then, and continues to maintain now, that the changes indicated in the\n     chart were the result of new information the Government learned about individual Offerees in\n     post-remand discovery. See Gov’t Br. at 14. The Arroyo Intervenors say that the Government\n     changed its mind on the law, and not because of any new facts. We are puzzled by the\n     Government’s claim. It may well be that the Government learned information suggesting that\n     some Offerees were not victims of discrimination. And such information would explain the\n     Government’s refusal to defend the settlement as to those Offerees. But there do not appear to\n     be any new facts in the record explaining why the Arroyo Intervenors and other Offerees who\n     the Government thinks are victims of discrimination would be entitled to retroactive seniority\n\n                                                      27\n\f 1   Board III, 448 F. Supp. 2d at 417.\n\n 2   VIII. The District Court’s Opinions\n\n 3          After further discovery, the Brennan Plaintiffs and the Arroyo and Caldero Intervenors\n\n 4   cross-moved for partial summary judgment. Additionally, the City Defendants moved to enter\n\n 5   the settlement agreement as a consent decree, and the Brennan Plaintiffs moved for class\n\n 6   certification. The district court issued its first of three opinions on September 11, 2006. See\n\n 7   NYC Board III, 448 F. Supp. 2d 397. Some issues of fact remained, however. After a hearing on\n\n 8   those facts, the district court issued its second opinion on April 20, 2007. See United States v.\n\n 9   N.Y. City Bd. of Educ., 487 F. Supp. 2d 220 (E.D.N.Y. 2007) [hereinafter NYC Board IV]. After\n\n10   another hearing dealing with still remaining fact questions, the district court issued its third\n\n11   opinion on May 28, 2008. See United States v. N.Y. City Bd. of Educ., 556 F. Supp. 2d 202\n\n12   (E.D.N.Y. 2008) [hereinafter NYC Board V]. Final judgment was, at long last, entered on\n\n13   August 18, 2008.\n\n14          A.      The September 11, 2006 Opinion\n\n15          In its 2006 opinion, the district court considered first whether the settlement awards\n\n16   violated Title VII, and then whether they violated the Equal Protection Clause. The court\n\n17   concluded:\n\n\n\n     based on the median dates of the examinations they failed, but not to retroactive seniority based\n     on their provisional appointment dates (where such dates are earlier). The only basis for such a\n     determination would have to be that the retroactive seniority was based on the theory that the\n     examinations were not job-related, and not on the theory that the provisional appointment\n     process was a less discriminatory alternative to the examinations. That is, the Government\n     modified its legal theory and was not responding to a change in the facts. But, contrary to the\n     Arroyo Intervenors’ view, there is nothing improper in that. The Government is entitled to\n     change its position on the law, even in the absence of new facts. Yet, for some reason, the\n     Government goes to great lengths to deny that it has ever undertaken what appears to have been\n\n                                                      28\n\f 1                 As to the 28 black or Hispanic Offerees before the district court in 2006 who had\n\n 2                  taken and failed a challenged exam:\n\n 3                      o The lawfulness of one Offeree’s retroactive seniority could not be\n\n 4                          determined because there was a genuine issue of material fact as to\n\n 5                          whether Exam 8206 had a disparate impact on Hispanics; a hearing was\n\n 6                          required on that issue.\n\n 7                      o Seven Offerees were actual victims of discrimination and their entire\n\n 8                          retroactive seniority was lawful.\n\n 9                      o There were factual disputes as to whether the remaining twenty Offerees\n\n10                          were actual victims of discrimination, but their retroactive seniority for\n\n11                          TCAs and transfers was lawful regardless of whether they were actual\n\n12                          victims. Their retroactive layoff seniority, however, was lawful only if\n\n13                          they were actual victims.25\n\n14                 As to the 31 black, Hispanic, Asian, or female Offerees before the district court in\n\n15                  2006 who had not taken a challenged exam and/or were not among the groups on\n\n16                  which those exams allegedly had a disparate impact:\n\n17                      o One Offeree was really a white male. His retroactive seniority was\n\n18                          unlawful.\n\n19                      o The retroactive seniority of the other 11 male non-test-taker Offerees was\n\n20                          unlawful unless they could show that they were actual victims of\n\n\n     a legitimate change in legal position. See Gov’t Reply Br. at 4-7.\n     25\n        No party appeals the district court’s ruling that layoff seniority was properly limited to actual\n     victims of discrimination, but some parties do challenge the determination of whether particular\n\n                                                      29\n\f 1                          discrimination. According to the district court, giving them relief without\n\n 2                          such a showing would violate the Equal Protection Clause.\n\n 3                      o The 19 female non-test-taker Offerees could lawfully receive full\n\n 4                          retroactive seniority for transfer and TCA purposes, but not for layoffs.26\n\n 5   NYC Board III, 448 F. Supp. 2d at 446-47.\n\n 6          The court’s reasoning was as follows. First, it addressed a preliminary issue: whether the\n\n 7   Brennan Plaintiffs were correct in their assertion that five supposedly Hispanic Offerees were\n\n 8   not entitled to any relief because they were not in fact Hispanic. Relying on the EEOC’s\n\n 9   definition of “national-origin discrimination” in 29 C.F.R. § 1606.1, the district court held that\n\n10   “an ancestral place of origin is sufficient to establish membership in a protected class.” NYC\n\n11   Board III, 448 F. Supp. 2d at 422. Applying that definition, the district court held that one\n\n12   recruiting claimant, Ciro Dellaporte, was not Hispanic. Id. The other four—Kevin LaFaye,\n\n13   Steven Lopez, and the brothers Nicholas Pantelides and Anthony Pantelides, were Hispanic\n\n14   “because LaFaye’s father and the Pantelides’ mother were born in Puerto Rico, and Lopez’s\n\n15   grandfather was born in Mexico.” Id.\n\n16          Next, the district court sought to determine whether the retroactive seniority awards\n\n17   violated the Brennan Plaintiffs’ rights under Title VII. The district court relied heavily on the\n\n18   “affirmative action” framework of Johnson, 480 U.S. 616, and Weber, 443 U.S. 193, consistent\n\n19   with which an employer defending an affirmative-action plan against a Title VII reverse-\n\n20   discrimination challenge needs to show only that (1) there is a “manifest imbalance” in a\n\n\n\n     Offerees were victims.\n     26\n        The Caldero Intervenors do not appeal the holding that layoff seniority was limited to actual\n     victims of discrimination, nor does the United States challenge it.\n\n                                                      30\n\f 1   traditionally segregated job category and (2) the plan does not “unnecessarily trammel” the\n\n 2   interests of adversely affected third parties. NYC Board III, 448 F. Supp. 2d at 423-24. The\n\n 3   district court rejected the Brennan Plaintiffs’ argument that the Weber/Johnson framework did\n\n 4   not apply. Id. at 428-31. According to the district court, “there is nothing in Title VII that\n\n 5   vitiates an affirmative-action plan granting preferential seniority to non-victims of\n\n 6   discrimination.” Id. at 429.\n\n 7          Applying the “affirmative action” framework, the district court found a manifest\n\n 8   imbalance for both non-test-taker and test-failer Offerees. For the Offerees who had failed a test,\n\n 9   the district court said that the Government had satisfied the “manifest imbalance” requirement by\n\n10   showing statistical evidence sufficient to make out a prima facie case of testing discrimination,\n\n11   id. at 425-26, except as to Hispanics who took Exam 8206; as to them a hearing was required, id.\n\n12   at 427. For Offerees who had not taken a test (and who therefore, the court reasoned, could only\n\n13   be victims of recruiting discrimination, if they were victims at all), the district court relied on Dr.\n\n14   Ashenfelter’s analysis that found a statistical imbalance between the expected and actual\n\n15   numbers of black, Hispanic, Asian, and female takers of the three challenged exams. Id. at 427-\n\n16   28.\n\n17          Having found manifest imbalances, the district court proceeded to the “unnecessary\n\n18   trammeling” stage of the inquiry. The district court found that the transfer and TCA effects of\n\n19   the Offerees’ retroactive seniority did not unnecessarily trammel the rights of the Brennan\n\n20   Plaintiffs, because race, national origin, or gender would rarely be the deciding factor in whether\n\n21   a Brennan Plaintiff got a transfer, and even when one of these was the deciding factor the\n\n22   Brennan Plaintiff remained eligible for future transfers. Id. at 431. But the district court held\n\n\n                                                       31\n\f 1   that layoff seniority for non-victims of discrimination would unnecessarily trammel the Brennan\n\n 2   Plaintiffs’ rights. Id. at 431-34.\n\n 3           After resolving those Title VII issues, the district court examined the Equal Protection\n\n 4   Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, since the Brennan Plaintiffs had also attacked the\n\n 5   settlement under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. For the minority male Offerees the district court applied\n\n 6   strict scrutiny to the settlement grants of retroactive seniority. NYC Board III, 448 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n 7   434-35. This meant the City Defendants had to show (1) a compelling interest for adopting the\n\n 8   retroactive seniority, and (2) that the retroactive seniority was narrowly tailored to meet that\n\n 9   interest. The district court said that, in this particular case, such a showing required the City\n\n10   Defendants to demonstrate a strong basis in evidence that the Board’s own tests and/or recruiting\n\n11   practices were discriminatory. The court then held that the required showing was satisfied for\n\n12   Black and Hispanic Offerees who failed a test, because the Board had created the exams and the\n\n13   tests were adequately shown to be discriminatory against those racial groups. It was not,\n\n14   however, satisfied for non-test-taking male Offerees because although there was a significant\n\n15   disparity between the number of white test-takers and the number of black, Hispanic, or Asian\n\n16   test-takers, there was no sufficient evidence that this disparity was caused by the Board’s own\n\n17   recruiting practices. Id. at 434-35. The district court rejected the Brennan Plaintiffs’ claim that a\n\n18   compelling interest always requires a showing of intentional disparate treatment by the\n\n19   governmental entity asserting the interest, for such a requirement was, in the district court’s\n\n20   judgment, inconsistent with Supreme Court precedent and the policy of encouraging settlement\n\n21   of Title VII cases. Id. at 436-38. The court also found that the transfer and TCA seniority\n\n22   remedy for the test-failer Offerees was narrowly tailored under the factors listed in United States\n\n\n                                                      32\n\f1    v. Paradise, 480 U.S. 149, 171 (1987). Id. at 438-40. Layoff seniority even for these Offerees,\n\n 2   however, was not narrowly tailored. Id. at 440-41.\n\n 3          For female Offerees, the analysis was different. The district court, applying intermediate\n\n 4   scrutiny, did not require any showing of governmental (Board) involvement in the discrimination\n\n 5   the Board sought to remedy, so the City Defendants’ interest in remedying gender discrimination\n\n 6   could survive intermediate scrutiny even where their interest in remedying race discrimination\n\n 7   might not survive strict scrutiny. Id. at 441-43. Having found that transfer and TCA seniority\n\n 8   met the “narrowly tailored” standard during its strict scrutiny analysis, the district court easily\n\n 9   determined that transfer and TCA seniority were “substantially related” for intermediate scrutiny\n\n10   purposes as well.27 Id. at 442-43.\n\n11          The district court concluded its first opinion by addressing two other matters. First, the\n\n12   court refused to enter, as a consent judgment, the parts of the settlement agreement that had\n\n13   survived the Brennan Plaintiffs’ Title VII and Equal Protection Clause attacks. Id. at 443-44.\n\n14   Second, the Brennan Plaintiffs had sought class certification with respect to their claims for\n\n15   declaratory and injunctive relief. Even though none of the other parties in either action had\n\n16   submitted responsive papers, the district court approved the class under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23. Id. at\n\n17   444-46. The certified class consisted of “all custodial employees whose layoff-protection rights\n\n18   have been adversely affected by the grant of seniority benefits to beneficiaries who are non-\n\n19   victims of discrimination.” Id. at 446.\n\n20          The district court then listed the factual issues that still required a hearing:\n\n\n     27\n        The district court also held that layoff seniority for female Offerees was “substantially related”\n     to the goal of remedying gender discrimination. Id. at 442-43. (The district court made clear it\n     was aware that reaching this constitutional question was unnecessary in light of the court’s Title\n\n                                                       33\n\f 1          (a) which, if any, of the beneficiaries, in addition to Lloyd Bailey, Joseph Christie,\n 2          Belfield Lashley, Gilbert Rivera, Peter Robertin, Felix Torres and Mayra Zephrini\n 3          (Cintron), are actual victims of discrimination and received the relief to which they\n 4          were entitled; (b) whether the results of Exam 8206 in respect to Luis Torres satisfy\n 5          the evidentiary standards for establishing discrimination under Title VII and the\n 6          Fourteenth Amendment; and (c) whether John Mitchell and Eric Schauer[, the\n 7          plaintiffs seeking damages in the second consolidated action,] were denied transfers\n 8          in favor of particular individuals who impermissibly received retroactivity [sic]\n 9          seniority.\n10\n11   Id. at 447-48.\n12\n13          B.        The April 20, 2007 Opinion\n\n14          After holding hearings on the remaining factual issues, the district court issued a second\n\n15   opinion. See NYC Board IV, 487 F. Supp. 2d 220. This opinion discussed the results of those\n\n16   hearings and responded to several motions for reconsideration. In it the court held that:\n\n17                   Exam 8206 had been adequately shown to have had a disparate impact on\n\n18                    Hispanics. Id. at 224-32.\n\n19                   There was an issue of fact requiring a hearing as to whether the parties to the\n\n20                    1999 settlement agreement intended to distinguish between “testing claimants”\n\n21                    and “recruiting claimants,” or whether instead “the intent of the Agreement was\n\n22                    to give relief to blacks and Hispanics regardless of whether they failed a\n\n23                    challenged exam.” Id. at 232-33.\n\n24                       o If the former were true, then the district court would not hold a hearing as\n\n25                           to whether any recruiting-claim Offerees were actual victims of\n\n26                           discrimination, because at summary judgment there was insufficient\n\n\n\n\n     VII holding, but the court said that it wanted “to obviate any need for remand.” Id. at 443 n.53.)\n\n                                                       34\n\f 1                          evidence to warrant a hearing on any claim that they were actual victims.\n\n 2                          Id. at 224 n.3, 233-34.\n\n 3                      o If the latter were true, the district court said, it would be necessary to\n\n 4                          reconsider the Equal Protection Clause “narrow tailoring” analysis for the\n\n 5                          male recruiting claimants. Id.\n\n 6                  As a clarification, the Equal Protection Clause prohibited not only contested\n\n 7                   retroactive seniority for the minority male recruiting claimants, but also seniority\n\n 8                   benefits based, under the settlement agreement, on these claimants’ permanent\n\n 9                   appointment dates. Id. at 234-35.\n\n10                  The Brennan Plaintiffs’ class was expanded to include “all custodial employees\n\n11                   whose seniority for purposes of transfers, TCAs and layoff protection has been\n\n12                   adversely affected by the grant of seniority benefits to the Offerees.” Id. at 236.\n\n13                   In other words, the class was no longer limited to individuals affected by the grant\n\n14                   of seniority benefits to non-victims of discrimination, nor was it limited to\n\n15                   individuals who lost layoff protection rather than transfers or TCAs.\n\n16          C.       The May 28, 2008 Opinion\n\n17          The third opinion was issued in May 2008 after a hearing on the intent of the parties to\n\n18   the 1999 settlement agreement. See NYC Board V, 556 F. Supp. 2d 202. The court addressed\n\n19   two issues: first, whether the parties in 1999 intended to categorize Offerees into “testing-claim\n\n20   beneficiaries” and “recruiting-claim beneficiaries”; second, who among the testing-claim\n\n21   beneficiaries was an actual victim of testing discrimination.\n\n22          At the hearing, the district court heard the testimony of (1) Norma Cote, who had\n\n\n                                                      35\n\f 1   negotiated the settlement for the City Defendants, and (2) Katherine Baldwin, a Government\n\n 2   lawyer who was not directly involved in the settlement negotiations but who reviewed and\n\n 3   approved the agreement for DOJ policy compliance. Id. at 205-06. Cote testified that the\n\n 4   Government had never separated the claimants into recruiting and testing beneficiaries, nor had\n\n 5   it told the City Defendants that “the United States[] intended the settlement agreement to provide\n\n 6   make-whole relief calibrated to each [O]fferee’s individual injury.” Id. at 205. Indeed, she\n\n 7   testified that she did not recall the Government “ever explain[ing] to [her] why they wanted\n\n 8   these individuals to get retroactive seniority.” Id. at 205-06. Baldwin testified that DOJ’s policy\n\n 9   was “only [to] seek relief for identified victims of discrimination, [m]ake whole relief for\n\n10   identified victims of discrimination.” Id. at 206. Baldwin said that she and DOJ would not have\n\n11   approved the agreement if it had violated that policy. Id.\n\n12          Based on this testimony, the district court “conclude[d] that had the [City Defendants]\n\n13   and the United States operated under the assumption—now embodied in the Court’s holdings—\n\n14   that there was a sufficient evidentiary basis only for testing discrimination, blacks and Hispanics\n\n15   who had not taken one of the challenged exams would not have been included in the list of\n\n16   Offerees.” Id. at 207. The district court noted that the parties must have been aware in 1999 that\n\n17   (1) some recruiting claimants were being given retroactive seniority, because Asians and non-\n\n18   Hispanic, non-black women received that relief, and (2) “some blacks and Hispanics had not\n\n19   taken one of the challenged exams because that factor was relevant in determining whether relief\n\n20   would be based on the median hire date for a challenged exam or provisional hire date.” Id. at\n\n21   206-07. But the district court said that Baldwin’s testimony was “[m]ost compelling,” and that\n\n22   “[a]lthough the Court credits Cote’s testimony that the policy was not communicated to the\n\n\n                                                     36\n\f 1   Board, . . . the United States simply would not have condoned any agreement that went beyond\n\n 2   [make-whole] relief [to actual victims].” Id. at 207. The court also suggested that it was relying\n\n 3   on “the general principle of contract law that ‘reformation may be available where the parties\n\n 4   were under no mistake as to the words of the writing, but they supposed that the legal outcome\n\n 5   would be different.’” Id. at 207 n.4 (quoting 27 Williston on Contracts (4th ed. 2003) § 70:128).\n\n 6   For these reasons, the district court decided not to reconsider its holding that retroactive\n\n 7   seniority for male recruiting claimants would not be “narrowly tailored” for Equal Protection\n\n 8   Clause purposes. Id. at 207.\n\n 9          The court then made determinations as to who among the 27 testing claimants were\n\n10   actual victims.28 The court said that, for each of these claimants, the question was “whether the\n\n11   retroactive seniority they received approximately corresponds to the seniority they would have\n\n12   received but for the discriminatory exams.” Id. at 209. Additionally, “the parties to the\n\n13   Agreement—i.e., the United States and the Board—bear the burden of proof.” Id. The court’s\n\n14   determinations were as follows:\n\n15                 Seven—Lloyd Bailey, Joseph Christie, Belfield Lashley, Gilbert Rivera, Peter\n\n16                  Robertin, Felix Torres, and Mayla Zephrini (Citron)—were victims of\n\n17                  discrimination who received appropriate make-whole relief, because the Brennan\n\n18                  Plaintiffs had (supposedly) acknowledged this.29 Id. at 208 & n.6.\n\n\n\n     28\n        The district court did this because it had, in its 2006 opinion, held that among the testing\n     claimants only actual victims were entitled to layoff seniority, although all the testing\n     claimants—whether victims or not—were entitled to transfer and TCA seniority.\n     29\n        As explained in Discussion Part V.C, infra, the Brennan Plaintiffs now say they never made\n     any such acknowledgement and that there was no basis in the record for the district court to say\n     otherwise.\n\n                                                      37\n\f 1                 Ten—the Arroyo Intervenors—did not require a determination as to actual victim\n\n 2                  status because they had stipulated to layoff seniority dates.30 Id. at 208 & n.7.\n\n 3                 Two, Ronald Johnson and Fidel Seara, did not require a determination because\n\n 4                  the former had retired and the latter had died. Id. at 208.\n\n 5                 For the remaining eight, the parties had stipulated to facts but were unable to\n\n 6                  agree on their legal effect, so the court had to decide whether they were actual\n\n 7                  victims who had received make-whole relief.\n\n 8                      o Ricardo Cordero was an actual victim and received appropriate make-\n\n 9                          whole relief. He had failed Exam 5040, and his retroactive seniority date\n\n10                          was appropriately the median hire date for that exam. Id. at 209.\n\n11                      o Vernon Marshall was an actual victim, but his retroactive seniority date\n\n12                          required adjustment because, “for reasons that are not clear,” it was over\n\n13                          two years earlier than the median date for the exam he failed. Id. at 209-\n\n14                          10.\n\n15                      o Sean Rivera was not an actual victim. The settlement agreement had\n\n16                          given him a retroactive seniority date of November 7, 1995. He scored an\n\n17                          80 on Exam 1074, which had a median hire date of October 27, 1997.\n\n18                          This barely-passing score put Rivera close to the bottom of the Eligibility\n\n19                          List for the exam, so that he had not been hired at the time of the 1999\n\n20                          settlement agreement and it was unlikely that he ever would be. Against\n\n\n     30\n        This stipulation provides that if we or the Supreme Court hold that actual victim status of the\n     Arroyo Intervenors matters for any purpose other than retroactive layoff seniority, then the\n     stipulation will no longer apply on any further remand.\n\n                                                     38\n\f 1                          the odds, he was hired from the list after all on February 4, 2000. The\n\n 2                          district court said that the Government’ view that Rivera would have\n\n 3                          scored higher on a non-discriminatory exam, and would therefore have\n\n 4                          been hired earlier, was “purely speculative.” Id. at 210.\n\n 5                      o The other five testing Offerees—Thomas Fields, Carla Lambert, Angel\n\n 6                          Pagan, Anthony Pantelides, and Luis Torres—were not actual victims\n\n 7                          either. The Brennan Plaintiffs, relying on a post hoc review of applicant\n\n 8                          qualifications performed by the City Defendants while they were still\n\n 9                          litigating against the Government, argued that these five would have failed\n\n10                          the “experience papers” requirement even if they had passed the exams\n\n11                          they took. The court said that although, in this post hoc review, unlike the\n\n12                          actual hiring process, there was no opportunity for an administrative\n\n13                          appeal of an “experience papers” rejection, the Government had failed, at\n\n14                          the summary judgment stage, to meet its burden of providing “concrete\n\n15                          evidence that the post hoc review was incorrect as to any of the five whose\n\n16                          qualifications are challenged.” Id. at 210-11.\n\n17   IX.    The Miranda Lawsuit\n\n18          In 2006, Ruben Miranda, a Hispanic male incumbent Custodian aligned with the Brennan\n\n19   Plaintiffs, filed yet another lawsuit alleging violations of Title VII and § 1983 by the City\n\n20   Defendants. Miranda alleged that he was denied two transfers in 2005, and that he would have\n\n21   gotten the transfers but for the retroactive seniority given to Offerees Janet Caldero and Marcia\n\n22   Jarrett, who got the transfers instead. He sought injunctive and declaratory relief, as well as\n\n\n\n                                                      39\n\f 1   damages. That case (“Miranda”) was consolidated below, was dealt with in the district court’s\n\n 2   final judgment, and is part of this appeal.31\n\n 3   X.     The Stay Applications\n\n 4          After numerous appeals and cross-appeals were filed, three parties sought stays or\n\n 5   injunctions pending appeal. The Caldero Intervenors asked for a stay only as to the portion of\n\n 6   the district court’s declaratory judgment that stripped minority male recruiting-claim Offerees of\n\n 7   seniority stemming from their permanent appointment dates. See United States v. N.Y. City Bd.\n\n 8   of Educ., 620 F. Supp. 2d 413, 415 (E.D.N.Y. 2009) [hereinafter NYC Board VI]. The Brennan\n\n 9   Intervenors sought to have the City Defendants enjoined from “providing any competitive\n\n10   seniority benefits to any beneficiary of the Settlement Agreement executed on February 11, 1999\n\n11   (‘the Agreement’) to the extent that (1) the competitive seniority benefit resulted from the\n\n12   Agreement, (2) [the district court] found that those benefits were not a form of make-whole relief\n\n13   to actual victims of discrimination, and (3) [the district court] nonetheless found that the\n\n14   provision of those benefits did not violate the law.” Id. at 416 (modification omitted). The City\n\n15   Defendants sought a complete stay of the judgment. Id. The district court denied all three\n\n16   motions, stating that “neither the threat of irreparable harm nor the likelihood of success on\n\n17   appeal is sufficiently one-sided to justify disturbing what the Court believes to be the legally\n\n18   correct result.” Id. at 417.\n\n\n19                                                   Discussion\n\n20   I.     Title VII Background\n\n\n     31\n       John Brennan also appears to have brought another case in 2008 alleging a lost transfer, but\n     that case is not part of this appeal.\n\n                                                        40\n\f 1             Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq., prohibits two\n\n 2   types of employment discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national\n\n 3   origin.\n\n 4             Disparate-treatment discrimination is prohibited by § 703(a) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. §\n\n 5   2000e-2(a). Such claims require that a plaintiff “establish that the defendant had a\n\n 6   discriminatory intent or motive for taking a job-related action.” Ricci, 129 S. Ct. at 2672; see\n\n 7   also 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a) (“It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer . .\n\n 8   . to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against\n\n 9   any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of\n\n10   employment, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin . . . .”).\n\n11             Disparate-impact discrimination is also barred by Title VII. Disparate-impact claims\n\n12   do not require a showing of discriminatory intent. Disparate impact occurs when an employer\n\n13   uses an employment practice that has a disproportionately adverse effect on protected groups.\n\n14   Ricci, 129 S. Ct. at 2672-73. An employer can rebut a prima facie showing of disparate\n\n15   impact by demonstrating that the employment practice is job-related, and the plaintiff, in turn,\n\n16   can rebut that showing by demonstrating that there is a less discriminatory alternative to the\n\n17   challenged practice. Id.\n\n18             The Supreme Court, in Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424 (1971), first\n\n19   interpreted § 703(a)(2) of the 1964 Act to prohibit disparate-impact discrimination. In\n\n20   response to some pro-defendant interpretations of disparate-impact doctrine made by the\n\n21   Supreme Court in Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio, 490 U.S. 642 (1989), Congress enacted\n\n\n\n\n                                                       41\n\f 1   the Civil Rights Act of 1991, Pub. L. No. 102-166, 105 Stat. 1071.32 The 1991 Act added a\n\n 2   new section codifying the disparate-impact prohibition. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k).\n\n 3          A separate section of Title VII, § 706(g), 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(g), addresses the\n\n 4   equitable remedies a court may order after liability is proven. The statute provides courts\n\n 5   with broad equitable powers:\n\n 6          If the court finds that the respondent has intentionally engaged in or is intentionally\n 7          engaging in an unlawful employment practice charged in the complaint, the court\n 8          may enjoin the respondent from engaging in such unlawful employment practice, and\n 9          order such affirmative action as may be appropriate, which may include, but is not\n10          limited to, reinstatement or hiring of employees, with or without back pay (payable\n11          by the employer, employment agency, or labor organization, as the case may be,\n12          responsible for the unlawful employment practice), or any other equitable relief as\n13          the court deems appropriate. . . .\n14\n15   Id. § 2000e-5(g)(1). But some types of individualized remedies are limited to actual victims\n\n16   of discrimination—that is, those individuals who would not have suffered the employer’s\n\n17   adverse employment action in a nondiscriminatory world:\n\n18          No order of the court shall require the admission or reinstatement of an individual as\n19          a member of a union, or the hiring, reinstatement, or promotion of an individual as an\n20          employee, or the payment to him of any back pay, if such individual was refused\n21          admission, suspended, or expelled, or was refused employment or advancement or\n22          was suspended or discharged for any reason other than discrimination on account of\n23          race, color, religion, sex, or national origin . . . .\n24\n\n\n\n     32\n        See id. § 3, 105 Stat. at 1071 (“The purposes of this Act are—(1) to provide appropriate\n     remedies for intentional discrimination and unlawful harassment in the workplace; (2) to codify\n     the concepts of ‘business necessity’ and ‘job related’ enunciated by the Supreme Court in Griggs\n     v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424 (1971), and in the other Supreme Court decisions prior to\n     Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio, 490 U.S. 642 (1989); (3) to confirm statutory authority and\n     provide statutory guidelines for the adjudication of disparate impact suits under title VII of the\n     Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e et seq.); and (4) to respond to recent decisions of the\n     Supreme Court by expanding the scope of relevant civil rights statutes in order to provide\n     adequate protection to victims of discrimination.”).\n\n                                                      42\n\f 1   Id. § 2000e-5(g)(2)(A); see also Int’l Broth. of Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324, 367\n\n 2   (1977).\n\n 3             As the Supreme Court and this Court have said, the § 703(a) “liability” phase and the\n\n 4   § 706(g) “remedial” phase of a Title VII case are separate and must not be confused with one\n\n 5   another. See id. at 360-61 (distinguishing “the initial, ‘liability’ stage” from “the second,\n\n 6   ‘remedial’ stage”); Cates v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 561 F.2d 1064, 1070, 1072 (2d Cir.\n\n 7   1977). Section 706(g), being a remedial provision and not a liability provision, does not\n\n 8   speak to the actions of private parties; only a court is limited by it. Local No. 93, Int’l Ass’n\n\n 9   of Firefighters, AFL-CIO C.L.C. v. City of Cleveland, 478 U.S. 501, 521 (1986). Private\n\n10   conduct is, instead, governed by the liability provisions of § 703.\n\n11   II.       Procedural Posture and Standard of Review\n\n12             Before we discuss the numerous legal issues presented by this case, we pause to\n\n13   consider its procedural posture. The district court declined to enter the settlement agreement\n\n14   as a consent decree, and no party has appealed that decision. Accordingly, there is nothing\n\n15   left for us to decide with respect to the original 1996 NYC Board case brought by the\n\n16   Government. Indeed, the issue of settlement approval is now moot, for, as the district court\n\n17   explained, the settlement agreement expired by its terms on February 11, 2003:\n\n18             The Court cannot enter those parts of Paragraphs 13-16 that have survived the\n19             Brennan intervenors’ challenges as a consent judgment. In the first place, the\n20             Agreement was executed on February 11, 1999, and under Paragraph 11 was to\n21             “remain in force for a period of four years.” Also, the Agreement provided in\n22             Paragraph 47 that although the Court shall retain jurisdiction to ensure compliance,\n23             its jurisdiction “shall automatically terminate at the expiration of [the Agreement] as\n24             set forth in paragraph 11.” Magistrate Judge Levy, with the consent of all parties,\n25             entered all of its provisions save the challenged Paragraphs 13-16 as a consent\n26             judgment on February 28, 2002—well within that four year period—and the Court\n27             had jurisdiction to enforce it until February 11, 2003. The same enforcement\n\n                                                         43\n\f 1          limitation would have attached to Paragraphs 13-16 if they had also been reduced to\n 2          judgment prior to the expiration period. In short, even if all of the provisions of\n 3          Paragraphs 13-16 were deemed valid, the Court would nonetheless decline to reduce\n 4          them to a judgment which it would be powerless to enforce.\n 5\n 6   NYC Board III, 448 F. Supp. 2d at 443 (citation omitted).\n\n 7          Before us now is a pair of subsequent lawsuits brought by the Brennan Plaintiffs\n\n 8   (Brennan and Miranda) which had been consolidated with the original case below. Those\n\n 9   lawsuits allege that the City Defendants’ voluntary implementation, which took place around\n\n10   the year 2000, of the settlement agreement violated two statutes as to the Brennan Plaintiffs.\n\n11   The first is § 703(a) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a). The second is 42 U.S.C. § 1983, by\n\n12   virtue of an alleged violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n13   As remedies for these alleged violations, the Brennan Plaintiffs seek declaratory and\n\n14   injunctive relief, and damages in an amount to be determined at trial.\n\n15          The parties’ briefs and the opinions below indicate confusion over the procedural\n\n16   posture of this case. We therefore emphasize here, as we will throughout our opinion, that\n\n17   this case is about whether the City Defendants are liable to the Brennan Plaintiffs for\n\n18   violations of § 703(a) or the Equal Protection Clause. We are not deciding what remedy the\n\n19   district court could have ordered if, instead of agreeing to settle the case, the Government had\n\n20   proven a disparate-impact violation by the City Defendants in NYC Board. We are also not\n\n21   deciding whether the district court’s long ago decision not to approve the disputed portions of\n\n22   the settlement agreement and enter them as a consent decree was proper, in whole or in part.\n\n23   And we are not deciding whether, if the Government had directly attacked the seniority\n\n24   system itself as discriminatory, such an attack would have succeeded despite § 703(h) of Title\n\n25   VII, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(h). None of those questions are before us.\n\n                                                     44\n\f 1          The district court disposed of the vast majority of the relevant issues in Brennan and\n\n 2   Miranda upon cross-motions for summary judgment. But, in what appears to be a confusion\n\n 3   about the case’s procedural posture, there were a few issues resolved by what the district court\n\n 4   and the parties describe as “evidentiary hearings.” At these hearings, the district court heard\n\n 5   testimony and took evidence. The court subsequently made findings of fact. It is not\n\n 6   immediately clear to us why the district court held these hearings rather than a trial, and at\n\n 7   oral argument the Government admitted that it didn’t know either. Since the district court’s\n\n 8   2006 opinion had already declined to enter the settlement agreement as a consent decree, the\n\n 9   Brennan Plaintiffs’ Title VII § 703(a) and 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claims were what remained. No\n\n10   party to these suits appears to have requested a jury trial, although the Brennan Plaintiffs’\n\n11   damage claims for intentional discrimination in violation of Title VII would certainly have\n\n12   given rise to the right to one, see 42 U.S.C. § 1981a(c). Ordinarily, under these\n\n13   circumstances, a district court would have held a trial to decide any factual issues not resolved\n\n14   at the summary judgment stage. Given what occurred at the evidentiary hearings, and given\n\n15   that the Brennan Plaintiffs do not appear to have objected to the lack of a jury trial, we think it\n\n16   best to treat the hearings as separate bench trials on separate issues. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(b)\n\n17   (“For convenience, to avoid prejudice, or to expedite and economize, the court may order a\n\n18   separate trial of one or more separate issues . . . .”). And we review them as such.\n\n19          This means that in this opinion, “[w]e review de novo the district court’s partial grant\n\n20   of summary judgment, construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving\n\n21   party.” Weintraub v. Bd. of Educ. of City Sch. Dist. of City of N.Y., 593 F.3d 196, 200 (2d Cir.\n\n22   2010). And on this “appeal taken from a judgment entered following a bench trial, we review\n\n\n                                                      45\n\f 1   the district court’s findings of fact for clear error, but we review de novo its conclusions of\n\n 2   law and its resolution of mixed questions of fact and law.” APL Co. PTE Ltd. v. Blue Water\n\n 3   Shipping U.S. Inc., 592 F.3d 108, 110 (2d Cir. 2010).\n\n 4   III.   Prima Facie Case and Defenses\n\n 5          We consider the Brennan Plaintiffs’ Title VII claim first, leaving their constitutional\n\n 6   claims to be considered later and only as necessary. See Ricci, 129 S. Ct. at 2672. In order to\n\n 7   address the Brennan Plaintiffs’ § 703(a) disparate-treatment claim in its present procedural\n\n 8   posture, we must first determine which overall framework applies. Generally, § 703(a) claims\n\n 9   are analyzed under the burden-shifting rules of McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S.\n\n10   792, 802-04 (1973). Under McDonnell Douglas, a plaintiff must first make out a prima facie\n\n11   case, i.e., she “must demonstrate the following: (1) she was within the protected class; (2) she\n\n12   was qualified for the position; (3) she was subject to an adverse employment action; and (4)\n\n13   the adverse action occurred under circumstances giving rise to an inference of\n\n14   discrimination.” Leibowitz v. Cornell Univ., 584 F.3d 487, 498 (2d Cir. 2009); accord\n\n15   Vivenzio v. City of Syracuse, 611 F.3d 98, 106 (2d Cir. 2010); Aulicino v. N.Y. City Dep’t of\n\n16   Homeless Servs., 580 F.3d 73, 80 (2d Cir. 2009). Once the prima facie case has been shown,\n\n17   “the burden then must shift to the employer to articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory\n\n18   reason” for the adverse employment action. McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802; accord\n\n19   Vivenzio, 611 F.3d at 106; Leibowitz, 584 F.3d at 498-99. The burden then shifts back to the\n\n20   plaintiff “to show that [the defendant’s] stated reason for [the adverse employment action]\n\n21   was in fact pretext.” McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 804; accord Vivenzio, 611 F.3d at 106;\n\n22   Leibowitz, 584 F.3d at 499.\n\n\n\n                                                      46\n\f 1             Because the Supreme Court’s majority opinion in Ricci33 does not explicitly cite\n\n 2   McDonnell Douglas or any other case in that line, one might reasonably ask whether some\n\n 3   other framework ought to apply in reverse-discrimination cases of this sort. In our view,\n\n 4   however, Ricci fits well within the McDonnell Douglas framework. As the Ricci Court\n\n 5   explained, New Haven “rejected the test results solely because the higher scoring candidates\n\n 6   were white. The question is . . . whether the City had a lawful justification for its race-based\n\n 7   action.” Ricci, 129 S. Ct. at 2674. In other words, because the City’s decision to reject the\n\n 8   test results was explicitly based on a statistical racial disparity, it was beyond dispute that the\n\n 9   plaintiffs had made out a prima facie case, so the burden shifted to the defendants to give a\n\n10   legitimate justification for the adverse employment action. The Court then held that, on\n\n11   summary judgment, the defendants had failed to provide a legitimate justification, id. at 2681;\n\n12   and so the “pretext” step of the inquiry was not reached. But if the Court had found a\n\n13   legitimate justification, it appears that a majority of the Justices would have proceeded to that\n\n14   step. Justice Alito’s concurring opinion, joined by two other Justices, argued principally that\n\n15   “a jury could find that [New Haven]’s asserted justification was pretextual.” See id. at 2689\n\n16   (Alito, J., concurring); see also id. at 2683-84 (noting that “[i]f an employer offers a facially\n\n17   legitimate reason for its decision but it turns out that this explanation was just a pretext for\n\n18   discrimination, the employer is again liable,” and citing St. Mary’s Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509\n\n19   U.S. 502, 506-07 (1993), a case applying McDonnell Douglas). The four dissenting Justices\n\n20   disagreed with Justice Alito on whether a jury could find a pretext, but they did not seem to\n\n21   disagree that the burden would shift back to the plaintiffs to show pretext. See id. at 2709\n\n\n     33\n          The Ricci opinion is discussed in detail in Part IV.B.1, infra.\n\n                                                        47\n\f 1   (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (suggesting that New Haven might have been liable, even on the\n\n 2   dissent’s view of the law, if the city had been “seeking to exclude white firefighters from\n\n 3   promotion”). We, therefore, conclude that Ricci does not impose a new § 703(a) summary-\n\n 4   judgment burden-shifting framework, but instead constitutes, in this respect, a straightforward\n\n 5   application of the first two steps of McDonnell Douglas.\n\n 6          The earlier Supreme Court cases dealing with § 703(a) challenges to affirmative action\n\n 7   plans further support the view that McDonnell Douglas is the appropriate framework for this\n\n 8   case. Like Ricci, these cases reconcile the disparate-treatment provisions of Title VII with the\n\n 9   statute’s other goals by recognizing a defense which employers may raise when they are sued\n\n10   for disparate treatment. The Supreme Court has explicitly stated that the “affirmative action”\n\n11   defense, too, is properly raised at the second step of the McDonnell Douglas framework. See\n\n12   Johnson v. Transp. Agency, Santa Clara County, 480 U.S. 616, 626 (1987) (“This case also\n\n13   fits readily within the analytical framework set forth in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green.\n\n14   Once a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case that race or sex has been taken into account in\n\n15   an employer’s employment decision, the burden shifts to the employer to articulate a\n\n16   nondiscriminatory rationale for its decision. The existence of an affirmative action plan\n\n17   provides such a rationale.” (citation omitted)).\n\n18          We therefore apply McDonnell Douglas to the Brennan Plaintiffs’ § 703(a) claim.\n\n19   And the first question we must address is whether the Brennan Plaintiffs have satisfied the\n\n20   requirements for a prima facie case under McDonnell Douglas.34 We easily conclude that the\n\n\n     34\n       The district court considered whether the Brennan Plaintiffs’ claims were ripe, since they had\n     not been laid off and some of them had arguably not been denied transfers or TCAs. See NYC\n     Board III, 448 F. Supp. 2d at 421 n.33. We agree with the district court that the Brennan\n\n                                                        48\n\f1   Brennan Plaintiffs have made out a prima facie case. All but one of the individual plaintiffs\n\n2   (not counting unnamed members of the class certified by the district court) are white males.35\n\n3   There is no dispute as to their qualifications. The City Defendants gave the Offerees\n\n4   retroactive seniority at the expense of the Brennan Plaintiffs.36 And the 1999 settlement\n\n\n\n    Plaintiffs’ claims are ripe. Some of them have lost transfers directly to Offerees, while others\n    may have lost them indirectly as a result of the “domino effect” we described in NYC Board II,\n    260 F.3d at 132. The Brennan Plaintiffs also claim that they have received TCAs less often than\n    they would have, but for the City Defendants’ implementation of the settlement agreement. And\n    although there have not been any layoffs, we think that the Brennan Plaintiffs’ layoff claims, in\n    the context of this case, are ripe for adjudication. In some cases where the manner in which\n    layoffs are set to occur is challenged before there actually are any layoffs, it is best for a court to\n    wait for a challenge by individual employees to actual layoffs, because the specific application\n    of the layoff procedures may better inform the court than a consideration of those procedures in\n    the abstract. See Am. Fed’n of Gov’t Employees, AFL-CIO v. Office of Personnel Mgmt., 821\n    F.2d 761, 767-68 (D.C. Cir. 1987). Here, however, upon consideration of “the fitness of the\n    issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration,”\n    Abbott Labs. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 149 (1967), overruled on other grounds, Califano v.\n    Sanders, 430 U.S. 99 (1977), there appears to be little justification for awaiting an actual layoff.\n    Such a delay would not provide the court with any useful new information, and most of the legal\n    questions at issue in the layoff claim must also be decided to resolve the transfer and TCA\n    claims.\n    35\n       One might question whether Ruben Miranda, the plaintiff in Miranda, is in the protected class.\n     He is a Hispanic male incumbent Custodian. One could say that, unlike the plaintiffs in\n    Brennan, he suffered an adverse employment action not because he is a Hispanic male—of\n    whom there were several among the Offerees—but rather because he was an incumbent\n    Custodian. Similar arguments could be made about the other individuals in the plaintiff class\n    who are black, Hispanic, Asian, or female. But, because no party has raised such arguments in\n    its briefs, we deem them forfeited. See, e.g., United States v. Yousef, 327 F.3d 56, 115-16 (2d\n    Cir. 2003).\n    36\n       It is unclear whether the Brennan Plaintiffs suffered an adverse employment action if only\n    TCAs were considered. As the district court stated, the record is not lucid with respect to how\n    the City Defendants implemented the TCA provisions of the settlement agreement. The Offerees\n    may have been put at the top of the TCA lists at the end of the one-year probationary periods\n    following their permanent appointments (or immediately, in the case of those Offerees who were\n    already permanent employees when the settlement agreement was implemented), or they may\n    have been put at the bottom. See NYC Board III, 448 F. Supp. 2d at 412 n.22. In any event, the\n    Brennan Plaintiffs’ loss of transfer and layoff seniority is enough to show a “materially adverse\n    change in the terms and conditions of employment.” Mathirampuzha v. Potter, 548 F.3d 70, 78\n    (2d Cir. 2008) (quoting Sanders v. N.Y. City Human Res. Admin., 361 F.3d 749, 755 (2d Cir.\n\n                                                      49\n\f 1   agreement was explicitly race- and sex-based, thereby giving rise to the required inference of\n\n 2   discrimination. Cf. Ricci, 129 S. Ct. at 2674 (“Whatever the City’s ultimate aim—however\n\n 3   well intentioned or benevolent it might have seemed—the City made its employment decision\n\n 4   because of race.”).\n\n 5             In sum, because the City Defendants’ actions were explicitly race- and sex-based—\n\n 6   i.e., the grants of retroactive seniority were made because the three disputed exams and the\n\n 7   recruiting process had resulted in racial and gender disparities among test-takers and test-\n\n 8   passers—“[o]ur analysis begins with this premise: The [City Defendants’] actions would\n\n 9   violate the disparate-treatment prohibition of Title VII absent some valid defense. . . . Without\n\n10   some other justification, this express, race-[ and gender-]based decisionmaking violates Title\n\n11   VII’s command that employers cannot take adverse employment actions because of an\n\n12   individual’s race [or sex].” Ricci, 129 S. Ct. at 2673.37\n\n\n\n     2004)).\n\n               To be materially adverse, a change in working conditions must be more disruptive\n               than a mere inconvenience or an alteration of job responsibilities. Examples of such a\n               change include termination of employment, a demotion evidenced by a decrease in\n               wage or salary, a less distinguished title, a material loss of benefits, significantly\n               diminished material responsibilities, or other indices unique to a particular situation.\n               Only in limited circumstances does a single, acute incident of abuse qualify as an\n               adverse employment action.\n\n     Mathirampuzha, 548 F.3d at 78-79 (citation and quotation marks omitted). Under this standard,\n     genuine issues of material fact, to be addressed by the district court, remain as to the TCAs as\n     well: did the Brennan Plaintiffs suffer significant delays in obtaining TCAs as a result of the City\n     Defendants’ actions, and if so, were they sufficiently significant as to constitute an adverse\n     employment action?\n     37\n        Ricci itself only involved race discrimination, not gender discrimination. And it draws on\n     Equal Protection Clause cases that employed the strict scrutiny standard applicable to race\n     discrimination. See 129 S. Ct. at 2675. But, because Ricci’s holding is an interpretation of\n     conflicting Title VII provisions that apply to both race and gender discrimination, see id. at 2676\n\n                                                         50\n\f 1          Taken together, the briefs of the Caldero and Arroyo Intervenors and the Government\n\n 2   raise two defenses on behalf of the City Defendants. The first defense, raised only on behalf\n\n 3   of the Caldero and Arroyo Intervenors, is that the City Defendants’ voluntary implementation\n\n 4   of the settlement agreement was a valid affirmative action plan. The second, raised or\n\n 5   suggested in somewhat different ways as to various specific Offerees by all three of these\n\n 6   parties, is the “strong basis in evidence” defense recognized in Ricci. There is no dispute that\n\n 7   to the extent that the City Defendants’ actions are not justified by one of these defenses, the\n\n 8   City Defendants violated the Brennan Plaintiffs’ § 703(a) rights to be free from disparate\n\n 9   treatment. We will consider each defense in turn.\n\n10   IV.    Affirmative Action\n\n11          The Caldero and Arroyo Intervenors argue that the retroactive seniority awards were\n\n12   justified as part of an affirmative action plan, valid under Supreme Court precedent. They\n\n13   contend that, even if non-remedial, the seniority awards therefore do not violate § 703(a).\n\n14   Thus, according to these intervenors, even if, at the time the City Defendants implemented the\n\n15   settlement agreement, there was no reason to think that the individual recipients of retroactive\n\n16   seniority were victims of discrimination, such seniority would still be valid. The district court\n\n17   agreed in part, and held that, except for the retroactive awards of layoff seniority, the\n\n18   retroactive seniority awards constituted permissible affirmative action. We, instead, hold that\n\n19   the City Defendants’ implementation of the settlement agreement was not affirmative action\n\n\n\n     (“[W]e adopt the strong-basis-in-evidence standard as a matter of statutory construction to\n     resolve any conflict between the disparate-treatment and disparate-impact provisions of Title\n     VII.”); see also 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a) (prohibiting employment discrimination on the basis of\n     “race, color, religion, sex, or national origin”), we see no reason to limit Ricci to race\n     discrimination.\n\n                                                      51\n\f 1   at all, let alone permissible affirmative action; and that it was, therefore, error for the district\n\n 2   court to apply such an “affirmative action” defense to the Brennan Plaintiffs’ claims.\n\n 3           A.      Legal Background\n\n 4           The Supreme Court first recognized that a valid affirmative action plan constituted a\n\n 5   defense to a § 703(a) reverse-discrimination lawsuit in United Steelworkers of America v.\n\n 6   Weber, 443 U.S. 193 (1979). In Weber, a union and an employer collectively bargained for\n\n 7   an affirmative action plan under which 50% of the openings in an in-plant craft training\n\n 8   program would be reserved for black employees, until the percentage of black craft workers in\n\n 9   the plant reached a level commensurate with the percentage of blacks in the local labor force.\n\n10   A white production worker, who had not been selected for the training program, brought suit\n\n11   under § 703(a) of Title VII, arguing that he had been denied entry into the training program\n\n12   because of his race. The Supreme Court held that “Title VII’s prohibition in §[] 703(a) . . .\n\n13   against racial discrimination does not condemn all private, voluntary, race-conscious\n\n14   affirmative action plans.” Id. at 208. The Court did not “define in detail the line of\n\n15   demarcation between permissible and impermissible affirmative action plans.” Id. But the\n\n16   Court noted that the plan was “structured to open employment opportunities for Negroes in\n\n17   occupations which have been traditionally closed to them,” and that it did not “unnecessarily\n\n18   trammel the interests of the white employees” because it was “a temporary measure” that did\n\n19   not “require the discharge of white workers and their replacement with new black hirees” or\n\n20   “create an absolute bar to the advancement of white employees.” Id. The Court therefore\n\n21   held that the affirmative action plan in Weber “f[ell] within the area of discretion left by Title\n\n\n\n\n                                                        52\n\f 1   VII to the private sector voluntarily to adopt affirmative action plans designed to eliminate\n\n 2   conspicuous racial imbalance in traditionally segregated job categories.” Id. at 209.\n\n 3          The Court reaffirmed its Weber holding, and elaborated upon the requirements for a\n\n 4   valid affirmative action plan, in Johnson v. Transportation Agency, Santa Clara County, 480\n\n 5   U.S. 616 (1987). In Johnson the defendant employer voluntarily adopted an affirmative\n\n 6   action plan for promotions of employees, and pursuant to this plan it promoted a female\n\n 7   employee over the male plaintiff. The plan took sex into account as one of several factors,\n\n 8   including the qualifications of applicants for promotions. The Supreme Court upheld this plan\n\n 9   against the male plaintiff’s § 703(a) attack because it satisfied two requirements. First, the\n\n10   plan was prompted by a “manifest imbalance that reflected underrepresentation of women in\n\n11   traditionally segregated job categories.” Id. at 631 (quotations omitted). “A manifest\n\n12   imbalance need not be such that it would support a prima facie case against the employer,” id.\n\n13   at 632, although just how far below the prima facie level a “manifest imbalance” could go\n\n14   was left unclear. In any event, there was a “manifest imbalance” in Johnson, because, among\n\n15   the positions at issue, “none of the 238 positions was occupied by a woman,” and this fact was\n\n16   properly viewed as an imbalance even though “in some job categories women were not\n\n17   qualified in numbers comparable to their representation in the labor force.” Id. at 636.\n\n18   Second, the plan did not “unnecessarily trammel[] the rights of male employees or create[] an\n\n19   absolute bar to their advancement.” Id. at 637-38. This was so because the plan imposed\n\n20   “goals” but not “quotas,” the male plaintiff “had no absolute entitlement to the . . . position”\n\n21   and retained his current position and title along with the ability to apply for future promotions,\n\n\n\n\n                                                      53\n\f1    and “the [defendant]’s Plan was intended to attain a balanced work force, not to maintain\n\n2    one.” Id. at 637-40.\n\n3           B.      Application of Johnson and Weber to the Settlement Agreement\n\n4           In the instant case, the district court held, and the Caldero and Arroyo Intervenors\n\n 5   urge, that, except for purposes of layoff seniority,38 the implementation of the settlement\n\n 6   agreement satisfied Johnson and Weber because, they say, it was spurred by a manifest\n\n 7   imbalance and it did not unnecessarily trammel the rights of the Brennan Plaintiffs. See NYC\n\n 8   Board III, 448 F. Supp. 2d at 423-34. In light of Ricci, we agree with the Brennan Plaintiffs\n\n 9   that the district court’s holding skipped a threshold step in the analysis. That is, to determine\n\n10   whether a voluntary, private, race- and sex-conscious employer action is eligible for the\n\n11   Johnson/Weber defense, courts must now ask whether the race- and sex-conscious action\n\n12   constitutes an affirmative action plan at all. In this case, we answer that question in the\n\n13   negative.39\n\n14                  1.      Ricci\n\n15          The Supreme Court’s recent decision in Ricci indicates that not all voluntary race- or\n\n16   gender-conscious employer action is properly analyzed under Weber and Johnson. In Ricci,\n\n17   the City of New Haven administered a promotional examination for its firefighters. The\n\n18   results yielded a significant racial disparity: according to the promotion rules and by virtue of\n\n19   the test scores, all ten individuals eligible for the then-existing lieutenant vacancies were\n\n\n     38\n        The Caldero and Arroyo Intervenors do not appeal the district court’s determination that the\n     grants of layoff seniority were not valid affirmative action.\n     39\n        In light of our holding, we need not address the Brennan Plaintiffs’ alternative contention that\n     § 703(a) always prohibits employers from voluntarily making race- or sex-conscious non-\n     remedial alterations to a facially non-discriminatory seniority system.\n\n                                                      54\n\f 1   white; and of the nine individuals eligible for the then-existing captain vacancies, two were\n\n 2   Hispanic and seven were white. See 129 S. Ct. at 2666. Because of this racial disparity and,\n\n 3   allegedly, because of fear of a disparate-impact lawsuit from black firefighters, the New\n\n 4   Haven Civil Service Board did not certify the test results. Id. at 2667-71. A group of white\n\n 5   firefighters then sued under § 703(a) for disparate treatment.\n\n 6          The Supreme Court, correctly, described New Haven’s decision as a “race-based\n\n 7   action.” Id. at 2674. But, even though the Court was addressing a § 703(a) reverse-\n\n 8   discrimination suit attacking a voluntary, private “race-based action,” the majority opinion did\n\n 9   not cite Weber or Johnson. Nor did the Court apply the “manifest imbalance” and\n\n10   “unnecessary trammeling” factors. Instead, the Court adopted a “strong basis in evidence”\n\n11   standard: “under Title VII, before an employer can engage in intentional discrimination for\n\n12   the asserted purpose of avoiding or remedying an unintentional disparate impact, the\n\n13   employer must have a strong basis in evidence to believe it will be subject to disparate-impact\n\n14   liability if it fails to take the race-conscious, discriminatory action.” Id. at 2677. Ricci thus\n\n15   makes clear that at least some race- or sex-conscious voluntary employer actions are not\n\n16   subject to the “affirmative action” analysis of Weber and Johnson.40 See id. at 2700\n\n17   (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (“This litigation does not involve affirmative action.”).\n\n\n     40\n       In their supplemental brief concerning Ricci, the Brennan Plaintiffs ask us to go further. They\n     argue that it would be “anomalous” if “an employer could provide race-conscious or sex-\n     conscious benefits under Title VII more readily than it could cancel the results of its chosen\n     selection device.” In essence, they ask us to hold that Ricci overrules Johnson and Weber in their\n     entirety, so that the strong-basis-in-evidence test applies in affirmative-action cases, and the\n     “manifest imbalance” and “unnecessary trammeling” test of those older cases is no more. We\n     need not and do not address this argument. Because we hold that the City Defendants’ action,\n     not being affirmative action, is not subject to the more employer-favorable test of Johnson and\n     Weber, we do not reach the question of whether Johnson and Weber would apply in a § 703(a)\n\n                                                       55\n\f 1          Before Ricci, this Court had held, relying on Weber, that “a showing of a prima facie\n\n 2   case of employment discrimination through a statistical demonstration of disproportionate\n\n 3   racial impact constitutes a sufficiently serious claim of discrimination to serve as a predicate\n\n 4   for employer-initiated, voluntary race-conscious remedies.” Bushey v. N.Y. State Civil Serv.\n\n 5   Comm’n, 733 F.2d 220, 228 (2d Cir. 1984) (footnote omitted). Based on that reasoning, we\n\n 6   upheld, against a § 703 reverse-discrimination challenge, a public employer’s adjustment of\n\n 7   promotional examination scores for prison employees, in order to avoid a disparate impact on\n\n 8   minority officers. Id. at 227-28. After Ricci, however, the position taken in Bushey is no\n\n 9   longer tenable. A prima facie case of disparate impact is not, post-Ricci, an adequate factual\n\n10   predicate for all types of race- or gender-conscious employer actions. At least some race- or\n\n11   gender-conscious actions, such as the rejection of test scores because of their racial\n\n12   distribution, are not affirmative action and therefore cannot be supported by a mere “manifest\n\n13   imbalance,” or even by a prima facie case of disparate impact.\n\n14                  2.      Is the Implementation of the Settlement Agreement an Affirmative\n15                          Action Plan?\n16\n17          Since, after Ricci, not all race- or sex-conscious voluntary employer actions constitute\n\n18   “affirmative action” that might be properly analyzed under Johnson and Weber, we must\n\n19   decide what is an affirmative action plan and what is not. We agree with the Brennan\n\n\n\n     reverse-discrimination challenge to an employer action that actually is based on an affirmative-\n     action plan. See Humphries v. Pulaski County Special Sch. Dist., 580 F.3d 688, 694-97 (8th Cir.\n     2009) (applying Johnson and Weber to an affirmative action plan post-Ricci). In any event, “if a\n     precedent of [the Supreme] Court has direct application in a case, yet appears to rest on reasons\n     rejected in some other line of decisions, the Court of Appeals should follow the case which\n     directly controls, leaving to [the Supreme] Court the prerogative of overruling its own\n     decisions.” Agostini v. Felton, 521 U.S. 203, 237 (1997) (quotation marks and modification\n     omitted); Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/Am. Exp., Inc., 490 U.S. 477, 484 (1989); United\n\n                                                      56\n\f 1   Plaintiffs that in order to be an affirmative action plan, an employer action must benefit all\n\n 2   members of a protected class. Although the plan may call for individualized determinations,\n\n 3   the plan itself cannot be individualized. Under this definition, the City Defendants’ voluntary\n\n 4   implementation of the settlement agreement is not an affirmative action plan. The City\n\n 5   Defendants, and the intervenors who support them, therefore cannot rely on their affirmative\n\n 6   action defense.\n\n\n 7                          a.      What Is an Affirmative Action Plan?\n 8\n 9          The Supreme Court has never said what, for purposes of the Weber/Johnson defense to\n\n10   § 703(a), is an affirmative action plan. But the Court has differentiated affirmative action\n\n11   from other forms of relief a court might order under § 706(g) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-\n\n12   5(g). We think that distinction is applicable here.\n\n13          Before delving into those cases, we pause to note that, in adopting for § 703(a) the\n\n14   definition of affirmative action found in the Supreme Court’s § 706(g) cases, we do not mean\n\n15   to suggest that the authority of a court to order an employer to do something (as limited by §\n\n16   706(g)) is coterminous with an employer’s power to do that same thing voluntarily without\n\n17   violating § 703(a). The Supreme Court has expressly rejected that proposition, for the\n\n18   “suggestion that employers should be able to do no more voluntarily than courts can order as\n\n19   remedies ignores the fundamental difference between volitional private behavior and the\n\n20   exercise of coercion by the State.” Johnson, 480 U.S. at 630 n.8 (citation omitted). We rely\n\n21   on the § 706(g) cases only for their definition of what affirmative action is, and not for their\n\n22   discussion of when affirmative action is permissible.\n\n\n     States v. Gomez, 580 F.3d 94, 104 (2d Cir. 2009).\n                                                   57\n\f 1          Firefighters Local Union No. 1784 v. Stotts, 467 U.S. 561 (1984) is the earliest §\n\n 2   706(g) case relevant to a definition of affirmative action. In Stotts, black firefighters in\n\n 3   Memphis, Tennessee, brought a § 703(a) pattern-or-practice racial discrimination claim\n\n 4   against the Memphis Fire Department. After settlement negotiations, a consent decree was\n\n 5   entered and approved by the district court. Among other things, the consent decree provided a\n\n 6   hiring goal for black firefighters. The next year, because of budget difficulties, Memphis\n\n 7   decided to lay some employees off. Under a contract between the city and the Firefighters’\n\n 8   Union, layoffs were to follow a “last hired, first fired” rule. The result of following that rule\n\n 9   would have been to lay off a significant proportion of black firefighters, thereby undoing\n\n10   much of what the hiring goal had accomplished. Upon the black firefighters’ request, the\n\n11   district court issued an injunction to prevent the black firefighters from being laid off. The\n\n12   Court of Appeals affirmed. In order to comply with this injunction, the city laid off or\n\n13   demoted several white firefighters instead, even though they had more seniority than the black\n\n14   firefighters protected by the injunction.\n\n15          Of the several arguments made in favor of the Stotts district court’s injunction, one in\n\n16   particular is relevant here. The Court of Appeals in Stotts reasoned that (1) if the black\n\n17   firefighters had shown a Title VII violation, the district court could, under § 706(g), have\n\n18   ordered the city not to lay off black firefighters, and (2) anything that a district court can order\n\n19   under § 706(g) when a Title VII violation has been proven, the court can also order to\n\n20   effectuate the purpose of a Title VII consent decree. Id. at 578. The Supreme Court disagreed\n\n21   with the first of these premises, and held that “the Court of Appeals imposed on the parties as\n\n22   an adjunct of settlement something that could not have been ordered had the case gone to trial\n\n\n                                                       58\n\f1   and the plaintiffs proved that a pattern or practice of discrimination existed.” Id. at 579. A\n\n2   court could not have ordered such relief, the Court explained, because “a court can award\n\n3   competitive seniority only when the beneficiary of the award has actually been a victim of\n\n4   illegal discrimination.” Id. But there had been “no finding that any of the blacks protected\n\n5   from layoff had been a victim of discrimination and no award of competitive seniority to any\n\n6   of them” at the time of the consent decree. Id. Stotts did, however, expressly avoid deciding\n\n7   “[w]hether the City, a public employer, could have taken this course without violating the\n\n8   law,” if Memphis had acted “unilaterally,” that is, voluntarily and not under court order. Id. at\n\n9   583.41\n\n\n    41\n       The Arroyo Intervenors assert that the Supreme Court answered this question in Local No. 93,\n    Int’l Ass’n of Firefighters, AFL-CIO C.L.C. v. City of Cleveland, 478 U.S. 501 (1986). Like so\n    many of the parties’ arguments in this case, however, this argument misconceives the case’s\n    procedural posture. Local 93 addressed whether § 706(g) prohibits a consent decree from\n    imposing certain types of relief. The Supreme Court held that § 706(g) does not apply to consent\n    decrees, or to voluntary employer action, at all. Id. at 521. But ours is a § 703(a) case, not a §\n    706(g) case; the Brennan Plaintiffs do not argue—and, in light of Local 93, could not argue—\n    that the City Defendants’ implementation of the settlement agreement violates § 706(g). And in\n    Local 93 the High Court emphasized in several places that it was not speaking to whether the\n    consent decree in that case was consistent with § 703(a). See id. at 517 n.8 (“Nor need we\n    decide what limits § 703 places on an employer’s ability to agree to race-conscious relief in a\n    voluntary settlement that is not embodied in a consent decree, or what showing the employer\n    would be required to make concerning possible prior discrimination on its part against minorities\n    in order to defeat a challenge by nonminority employees based on § 703.”); id. at 521 n.11\n    (“[W]e do not suggest that voluntary action by employers or unions is outside the ambit of Title\n    VII regardless of its effect on nonminorities . . . . The rights of nonminorities with respect to\n    action by their employers are delineated in § 703 of Title VII . . . .”); id. at 526 (“As noted\n    above, the fact that the parties have consented to the relief contained in a decree does not render\n    their action immune from attack on the ground that it violates § 703 of Title VII . . . .”); id. at\n    530 (“[T]he consent decree does not purport to resolve any claims the Union might have . . .\n    under § 703 of Title VII . . . . Indeed, despite the efforts of the District Judge to persuade it to do\n    so, the Union failed to raise any substantive claims.”); see also id. at 530-31 (O’Connor, J.,\n    concurring) (“As the Court explains, non-minority employees . . . remain free to challenge the\n    race-conscious measures contemplated by a proposed consent decree as violative of their rights\n    under § 703 . . . . It is clear . . . that the Court’s opinion does not hold or otherwise suggest that\n\n                                                      59\n\f 1          The next significant case is Local 28, Sheet Metal Workers’ Int’l Ass’n v. EEOC, 478\n\n 2   U.S. 421 (1986). In Local 28, the Government successfully sued a union with a long and\n\n 3   egregious history of discriminating against blacks and Hispanics. The union was found to\n\n 4   have engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination in recruitment, selection, training, and\n\n 5   admission to the union. At the § 706(g) remedy stage, the district court established a 29%\n\n 6   nonwhite membership goal, ordered the union to adopt an affirmative action plan for reaching\n\n 7   this goal, and appointed an administrator to oversee the plan. The plan required the union\n\n 8          to offer annual, nondiscriminatory journeyman and apprentice examinations, select\n 9          members according to a white-non-white ratio to be negotiated by the parties,\n10          conduct extensive recruitment and publicity campaigns aimed at minorities, secure\n11          the administrator’s consent before issuing temporary work permits, and maintain\n12          detailed membership records, including separate records for whites and non-whites.\n13\n14   Id. at 432-33. After two appeals to our court, which resulted in only two changes to the\n\n15   plan—a minor modification to the white-nonwhite ratio, and an extra year for the union to\n\n16   meet the goal—the union had only reached 10.8% nonwhite membership. Id. at 434. State\n\n17   and local authorities moved in the district court to hold the union in contempt.\n\n18          The district court held the union in contempt, not simply because the union had not\n\n19   met the goal, but also because the union had failed to comply with the requirements of the\n\n20   underlying affirmative action plan, and had withheld information from the administrator and\n\n21   the court, thereby making monitoring the union’s compliance difficult. Id. at 434-35. The\n\n22   district court issued another contempt order after another year of noncompliance. Id. at 435-\n\n\n\n     there is no necessary predicate for race-conscious practices favoring one race over another, when\n     those practices are embodied in a voluntary settlement or in a consent decree rather than ordered\n     by the court over the objection of an employer or union.” (quotations and citation omitted)).\n     Accordingly, it seems to us clear that Local 93 does not stand for the proposition for which the\n     Arroyo Intervenors cite it.\n\n                                                     60\n\f 1   36. The court at that time established a slightly different minority membership goal, and\n\n 2   abolished the apprenticeship examination, which had been a vehicle for noncompliance. (The\n\n 3   examination was replaced with selection by a three-member board, which would select white\n\n 4   and minority apprentices at a one-to-one ratio.) A divided panel of our court affirmed in all\n\n 5   respects relevant here, citing “the union’s foot-dragging egregious noncompliance” with the\n\n 6   plan. Id. at 438 (citing EEOC v. Local 638, Local 28 of Sheet Metal Workers’ Int’l Ass’n, 753\n\n 7   F.2d 1172, 1183 (2d Cir. 1985)).\n\n 8          At the Supreme Court, a four-Justice plurality upheld the affirmative action plan\n\n 9   against the union’s claim that § 706(g) permits a district court to award preferential relief only\n\n10   to the actual victims of unlawful discrimination. The plurality held that “§ 706(g) does not\n\n11   prohibit a court from ordering, in appropriate circumstances, affirmative race-conscious relief\n\n12   as a remedy for past discrimination. . . . [S]uch relief may be appropriate where an employer\n\n13   or a labor union has engaged in persistent or egregious discrimination, or where necessary to\n\n14   dissipate the lingering effects of pervasive discrimination.” Id. at 445 (plurality opinion).\n\n15   The plurality distinguished Stotts thus:\n\n16          Stotts discussed the “policy” behind § 706(g) in order to supplement the holding that\n17          the District Court could not have interfered with the city's seniority system in\n18          fashioning a Title VII remedy. This “policy” was read to prohibit a court from\n19          awarding make-whole relief, such as competitive seniority, backpay, or promotion,\n20          to individuals who were denied employment opportunities for reasons unrelated to\n21          discrimination. The District Court's injunction was considered to be inconsistent\n22          with this “policy” because it was tantamount to an award of make-whole relief (in\n23          the form of competitive seniority) to individual black firefighters who had not shown\n24          that the proposed layoffs were motivated by racial discrimination. However, this\n25          limitation on individual make-whole relief does not affect a court’s authority to order\n26          race-conscious affirmative action. The purpose of affirmative action is not to make\n27          identified victims whole, but rather to dismantle prior patterns of employment\n28          discrimination and to prevent discrimination in the future. Such relief is provided to\n29          the class as a whole rather than to individual members; no individual is entitled to\n\n                                                      61\n\f 1          relief, and beneficiaries need not show that they were themselves victims of\n 2          discrimination. In this case, neither the membership goal nor the Fund order required\n 3          petitioners to indenture or train particular individuals, and neither required them to\n 4          admit to membership individuals who were refused admission for reasons unrelated\n 5          to discrimination.\n 6\n 7   Id. at 474 (citation and footnotes omitted).42\n\n 8          The Local 28 distinction between affirmative action and make-whole relief, we think,\n\n 9   makes equal sense in the § 703(a) context, for it harmonizes Ricci with Johnson and Weber. In\n\n10   Ricci, a § 703(a) case, the employer action that was challenged was the discarding of the\n\n11   results of a test that had already been administered. This action was individualized, for what\n\n12   it did, in essence, was to give promotion—or at least another chance at promotion—to the\n\n13   individual black firefighters who had taken the test, at the expense of those firefighters who\n\n14   would have been eligible for promotion if the test results had been certified. As the Supreme\n\n15   Court explained:\n\n16          [W]e [do not] question an employer’s affirmative efforts to ensure that all groups\n17          have a fair opportunity to apply for promotions and to participate in the process by\n18          which promotions will be made. But once that process has been established and\n19          employers have made clear their selection criteria, they may not then invalidate the\n20          test results, thus upsetting an employee’s legitimate expectation not to be judged on\n21          the basis of race. Doing so, absent a strong basis in evidence of an impermissible\n22          disparate impact, . . . is antithetical to the notion of a workplace where individuals\n23          are guaranteed equal opportunity regardless of race.\n24\n25   129 S. Ct. at 2677. In other words, when an employer, acting ex ante, although in the light of\n\n26   past discrimination, establishes hiring or promotion procedures designed to promote equal\n\n\n     42\n       The fifth vote to uphold the affirmative action remedy in Local 28 came from Justice Powell,\n     who did not join the cited portion of the plurality opinion. His concurrence said very little about\n     Title VII. Of Stotts, Justice Powell said only that “[t]here, the question whether Title VII might\n     ever authorize a remedy that benefits those who were not victims of discrimination was not\n     before us, although there is language in the opinion suggesting an answer to that question.” 478\n     U.S. at 484 (Powell, J., concurring).\n\n                                                      62\n\f1    opportunity and eradicate future discrimination, that may constitute an affirmative action plan.\n\n2    But where an employer, already having established its procedures in a certain way—such as\n\n3    through a seniority system—throws out the results of those procedures ex post because of the\n\n4    racial or gender composition of those results, that constitutes an individualized grant of\n\n5    employment benefits which must be individually justified, and not affirmative action.\n\n6           The affirmative action plans in Johnson and Weber were quite different from such\n\n7    make-whole relief. The plan in Weber set out to achieve a better future racial balance among\n\n 8   skilled craftworkers at Kaiser Steel’s Gramercy plant, by requiring that 50% of production\n\n 9   workers chosen for the skilled craftworker training program be black. See 443 U.S. at 199.\n\n10   This plan was adopted pursuant to an affirmative-action provision in the collective bargaining\n\n11   agreement recently negotiated between the United Steelworkers and Kaiser. Id. at 197-98.\n\n12   The plaintiff, Brian Weber, argued that the plan violated § 703(a) and (d) because he was\n\n13   denied entry into the training program, in favor of less senior black workers. But the Supreme\n\n14   Court treated the plan in Weber as affirmative action. That result is readily explained by the\n\n15   Local 28 distinction. Instead of, say, granting retroactive seniority to specific individual black\n\n16   production workers, or throwing out the results of previous selection processes, the plan\n\n17   benefited all members of the racially defined class in a forward-looking manner. And it was\n\n18   adopted in a newly negotiated collective bargaining agreement rather than unilaterally by the\n\n19   employer in derogation of an earlier agreement.\n\n20          The plan in Johnson, likewise, did not grant individualized employment benefits to\n\n21   any specific women or racial minorities. The employer in Johnson, noting the\n\n22   underrepresentation of women in certain job classifications, decided to authorize the\n\n\n                                                      63\n\f 1   consideration of sex as one of several factors in deciding which of several qualified applicants\n\n 2   to promote. 480 U.S. at 620-21. Although this plan ultimately resulted in the promotion of a\n\n 3   woman over a man who was otherwise slightly better qualified, see id. at 623-24, the wheels\n\n 4   were set in motion ex ante. The employer decided on a plan that benefited the entire class of\n\n 5   women, and then it simply applied that plan in a particular instance. By way of contrast, the\n\n 6   employer had not previously adopted a different, gender-neutral method of selecting\n\n 7   employees for promotion and then opted to throw it out when confronted with the reality that\n\n 8   a particular woman would not be promoted under that method.\n\n 9          The Arroyo and Caldero Intervenors contend, however, that the line between\n\n10   “affirmative action” governed by Weber and Johnson on the one hand, and race- or gender-\n\n11   conscious action taken “for the asserted purpose of avoiding or remedying an unintentional\n\n12   disparate impact,” Ricci, 129 S. Ct. at 2677, on the other, must be drawn quite differently. We\n\n13   find their attempts to circumscribe Ricci to be without merit.\n\n14          The Arroyo Intervenors first suggest that Ricci essentially be limited to its facts. They\n\n15   say that Ricci applies only where an employer is motivated by “[f]ear of litigation alone,” id.\n\n16   at 2681, and that “Ricci’s new legal standard has no application to a case like this one\n\n17   involving an employer’s well-informed decision, after years of defending against employment\n\n18   discrimination claims, to enter into a settlement to redress ongoing and pervasive racial\n\n19   exclusion in a particular class of jobs.” Arroyo Reply Br. at 5. That argument confuses the\n\n20   Ricci strong-basis-in-evidence standard with the threshold question of whether Ricci applies.\n\n21   In Ricci, the Supreme Court said that an employer motivated by “fear of litigation alone” does\n\n22   not have an adequate strong basis in evidence. The Court did not suggest that the strong-\n\n\n                                                     64\n\f 1   basis-in-evidence standard applies only when an employer is motivated by “fear of litigation\n\n 2   alone.” Indeed, it would make no sense to require a strong basis in evidence of only those\n\n 3   employers who take race- or gender-conscious actions that are not “well-informed.”\n\n 4          Second, both the Arroyo and Caldero Intervenors assert that Ricci is limited to\n\n 5   situations in which an employer, acting to avoid a disparate-impact Title VII violation that has\n\n 6   not yet occurred, discards the results of a promotional exam that would otherwise result in the\n\n 7   awarding of particular promotions to particular candidates. Arroyo Reply Br. at 9-12; Caldero\n\n 8   Reply Br. at 64-66. That is, they seek to place at least three limitations on the scope of Ricci:\n\n 9   (1) Ricci applies only when the employer seeks to avoid a current disparate-impact violation,\n\n10   while remedies for previous violations are subject to Weber and Johnson; (2) Ricci applies\n\n11   only when the employment benefit denied to the plaintiffs is hiring or promotion; and (3)\n\n12   Ricci applies only when, in the absence of the employer’s race- or gender-conscious action,\n\n13   specific plaintiffs would have been entitled to specific positions. None of these narrow\n\n14   readings of Ricci seems to us valid.\n\n15          Ricci is not limited to cases where the employer seeks to avoid a current violation. As\n\n16   the Ricci Court itself stated, its core holding applies whenever an employer takes race-\n\n17   conscious action “for the asserted purpose of avoiding or remedying an unintentional\n\n18   disparate impact.” 129 S. Ct. at 2677 (emphasis added). And limiting Ricci to the avoidance\n\n19   of current violations would make very little sense. It would be strange to make an employer\n\n20   be subject to Ricci when it promises a set of employment benefits to test-passers but then\n\n21   unilaterally decides not to give the benefits out, while at the same time allowing that employer\n\n22   to avail itself of the more easily satisfied Johnson/Weber standard when it gives out another\n\n\n                                                      65\n\f 1   set of benefits, such as the seniority rights that will lead to the aforementioned benefits. Ricci\n\n 2   also is not solely about hiring or promotion. Nothing in the case suggests that when other past\n\n 3   established employment benefits are involved employers can take individualized race- or\n\n 4   gender-conscious action to remedy an asserted disparate impact without meeting the “strong\n\n 5   basis in evidence” test. See id. at 2676 (“[W]e adopt the strong-basis-in-evidence standard as\n\n 6   a matter of statutory construction to resolve any conflict between the disparate-treatment and\n\n 7   disparate-impact provisions of Title VII.” (emphasis added)). For similar reasons, Ricci does\n\n 8   not require that specific individuals be entitled to specific positions. When an employer lacks\n\n 9   a strong basis in evidence that it would otherwise be liable for disparate impact, the employer\n\n10   should not “upset[] an employee’s legitimate expectation not to be judged on the basis of\n\n11   race.” Id. at 2677. That expectation is upset by the race-conscious discarding of conditional\n\n12   entitlements to employment or employment benefits, just as much as it is when the entitlement\n\n13   is absolute.\n\n14          We therefore hold that § 703(a), like § 706(g), draws a distinction between affirmative\n\n15   action plans, which are intended to provide ex ante benefits to all members of a racial or\n\n16   gender class, and make-whole relief, which is intended to provide ex post benefits to specified\n\n17   individuals who have suffered discrimination. And where this latter form of benefits is at\n\n18   issue, the employer may not invoke the “affirmative action” defense of Johnson and Weber.\n\n\n19                          b.      The Employer Action in This Case\n20\n21          Having held that the Johnson/Weber framework does not apply to make-whole relief,\n\n22   we now apply this rule to the City Defendants’ voluntary implementation of the disputed\n\n23   portions of the settlement agreement. In our view, the City Defendants’ voluntary\n\n                                                      66\n\f 1   implementation of the settlement agreement falls on the Stotts side of the Local 28 distinction\n\n 2   between affirmative action and make-whole relief. The City Defendants’ implementation of\n\n 3   the disputed portions of the settlement agreement granted competitive seniority to the\n\n 4   Offerees. Competitive seniority is one of the forms of make-whole relief specifically\n\n 5   enumerated in Local 28. Moreover, it was competitive seniority that was, in effect, at issue in\n\n 6   Stotts, for when Memphis laid off white firefighters instead of black firefighters with less\n\n 7   seniority, the city was treating the white firefighters as if they were the less senior employees.\n\n 8          And, perhaps even more importantly, the reason why grants of competitive seniority\n\n 9   are generally not affirmative action, and therefore are generally limited to make-whole relief,\n\n10   is that retroactive seniority is by its nature individualized. The Offerees were a group of\n\n11   individuals defined by the settlement agreement to include provisional Custodians and CEs\n\n12   who were women or members of certain racial minority groups. Most of them were identified\n\n13   by name in an appendix to the agreement. It cannot be said that the City Defendants\n\n14   “provided [employment benefits] to the class as a whole rather than to individual members.”\n\n15   Local 28, 478 U.S. at 474. Instead, what the City Defendants did was “tantamount to an\n\n16   award of make-whole relief,” id., to individual provisional Custodians and CEs, arguably\n\n17   without adequate regard to whether there was any reason to think they might have been actual\n\n18   victims of discrimination, or to whether there was a strong basis in evidence that a disparate\n\n19   impact suit by them would succeed.\n\n20          The Caldero Intervenors urge that the retroactive seniority awards in this case are\n\n21   affirmative action even though “they do not look like the most typical kind.” They say the\n\n22   awards are a reasonable, narrower substitute for a general race or gender preference for school\n\n\n                                                      67\n\f 1   transfers. Their view seems to be that if a broad, non-individualized racial preference is\n\n 2   permissible provided that there is a manifest imbalance and the plan is narrowly tailored, then\n\n 3   race- or gender-conscious relief for only some of the individuals who would have benefited\n\n 4   from such a policy, had it been there in the past, must also be permissible. We do not agree.\n\n 5   Just as, in the § 706(g) context, courts have the power to order general racial preferences (as\n\n 6   in Local 28), but not individualized non-remedial relief (as in Stotts), so, employers also\n\n 7   cannot undertake individualized non-remedial relief and validate it by calling it “affirmative\n\n 8   action.”\n\n 9          The cases cited by the Caldero Intervenors are not to the contrary. In Jana-Rock\n\n10   Constr., Inc. v. N.Y. State Dep’t of Econ. Dev., 438 F.3d 195 (2d Cir. 2006), an equal\n\n11   protection case, a construction company owned by an individual of Spanish descent claimed\n\n12   that New York’s definition of “Hispanic,” which was used for purposes of selecting minority-\n\n13   owned businesses to benefit from affirmative action, violated the Equal Protection Clause\n\n14   because it included individuals of Latin American descent while excluding Spaniards. We\n\n15   rejected this challenge, holding that the Equal Protection Clause does not require a state using\n\n16   an affirmative action plan to “expand[]” the preferred class “to include other racial and ethnic\n\n17   groups that may have been discriminated against.” Id. at 207. Assuming arguendo that this\n\n18   equal protection reasoning applies in the § 703(a) context, Jana-Rock is distinguishable\n\n19   because it deals with the definition of a racial or ethnic beneficiary class. In our case, nobody\n\n20   is saying that the numerous other minority or female individuals who may have applied for\n\n21   Custodian or CE positions—or, for that matter, the minority or female incumbent Custodians\n\n22   and CEs like Miranda plaintiff Ruben Miranda—are not black, Hispanic, Asian, or female.\n\n\n                                                      68\n\f 1   They were excluded from the settlement agreement’s benefits, not because they were deemed\n\n 2   to be the “wrong” gender or race, but rather because they were not among the individuals\n\n 3   selected for individualized relief. That there may be some flexibility in how a racial or gender\n\n 4   class is defined does not undermine the requirement that affirmative action plans provide, on a\n\n 5   prospective basis, equal benefits to all members of that beneficiary class.\n\n 6          The Caldero Intervenors also rely on Stuart v. Roache, 951 F.2d 446 (1st Cir. 1991)\n\n 7   (Breyer, J.), in which the First Circuit upheld under the Equal Protection Clause a race-\n\n 8   conscious promotion plan for Boston police officers. The promotion goals for black officers\n\n 9   fell short of the projected number of such officers eligible for promotion: they amounted to\n\n10   15.5% of all sergeants, while the eligible pool contained about 20% black officers. Id. at 454.\n\n11   But, like a differently defined racial or gender class, a smaller promotion goal does not turn\n\n12   affirmative action into individualized relief. A 15.5% goal and a 20% goal are both “provided\n\n13   to the class as a whole rather than to individual members.” Local 28, 478 U.S. at 474. The\n\n14   retroactive seniority awards at issue in our case are, instead, expressly “provided . . . to\n\n15   individual members.”\n\n16          It is noteworthy, as well, that the Government claims it never intended a Stotts-like\n\n17   result when it entered the settlement agreement. The district court held a hearing to determine\n\n18   the intent of the settlement agreement, and at that hearing Norma Cote, the lawyer who had\n\n19   negotiated the agreement for the City Defendants, testified that she did not recall the\n\n20   Government “ever explain[ing] to [her] why they wanted these individuals to get retroactive\n\n21   seniority.” NYC Board V, 556 F. Supp. 2d at 205-06. Katherine Baldwin, a DOJ supervisor\n\n22   who was not directly involved in the settlement negotiations but who approved the settlement\n\n\n                                                       69\n\f 1   after it was negotiated, testified that it was DOJ policy to seek only make-whole relief for\n\n 2   actual victims, and that she would not have approved the settlement if it had contravened that\n\n 3   policy. Id. at 206. The district court found, on the basis of this testimony, that the settlement\n\n 4   agreement was intended to be limited to make-whole relief. Although the awards may have\n\n 5   gone beyond make-whole relief, we are skeptical as to whether an employer can adopt an\n\n 6   affirmative-action plan by accident. When an employer adopts an affirmative-action plan, it\n\n 7   generally does so consciously, with the purpose “not to make identified victims whole, but\n\n 8   rather to dismantle prior patterns of employment discrimination and to prevent discrimination\n\n 9   in the future,” Local 28, 478 U.S. at 474. When applying strict or heightened scrutiny to race-\n\n10   or gender-based classifications in the Equal Protection Clause context, the Supreme Court has\n\n11   cautioned that “[t]he [actor’s] justification must be genuine, not hypothesized or invented post\n\n12   hoc in response to litigation.” United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996)\n\n13   (heightened scrutiny); accord Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U.S. 899, 908 n.4 (1996) (strict scrutiny).\n\n14   The same, we believe, is true when an employer raises the Weber/Johnson “affirmative\n\n15   action” defense to a reverse-discrimination suit under § 703(a).\n\n16          The Caldero Intervenors, relying on the testimony recited in footnote 43, infra, and the\n\n17   text of the settlement agreement itself, assert that, notwithstanding the district court’s finding\n\n18   to the contrary, the parties to the settlement agreement clearly intended to create an\n\n19   affirmative action plan in 1999. According to these Intervenors, it was manifest in 1999 that\n\n20   the settlement agreement would provide retroactive seniority to the specified Offerees without\n\n21   regard to whether there was any evidence that they were actual victims. Therefore, they say,\n\n\n\n\n                                                      70\n\f 1   the Government and the City Defendants must have intended to create an affirmative action\n\n 2   plan. The Caldero Intervenors’ premise is correct, but their conclusion does not follow.\n\n 3          The Caldero Intervenors correctly point out that the settlement agreement contained a\n\n 4   specific definition of “Offeree,” and that this definition was not limited to actual victims.\n\n 5   They also correctly point out that the Cote testimony, which the district court credited,\n\n 6   indicates that the Government and the City Defendants did not perform any individualized\n\n 7   investigation of the Offerees to determine the likelihood that they were victims of\n\n 8   discrimination. Once it was determined that an individual satisfied the definition of “Offeree”\n\n 9   in the settlement agreement, that individual was offered retroactive seniority.43 Yet all that\n\n10   this shows is that the Government and the City Defendants may have been less careful than\n\n11   they should have been. Although it was clear from the four corners of the settlement\n\n12   agreement and from the testimony that nobody was checking to make sure that the Offerees\n\n13   were actual victims or even likely victims, it was equally clear that the retroactive seniority\n\n14   awards would be individualized, and therefore, in light of Stotts, not affirmative action. Not\n\n\n     43\n       Cote testified:\n     Q: Did you undertake any individualized inquiry to determine whether they’d been victims of\n     recruiting discrimination or testing discrimination?\n     A: No.\n     ...\n     The Court: You never discussed with anybody who was an actual victim at that time.\n     The Witness: No, we never discussed it with each other.\n     The Court: You never discussed it with each other. Okay.\n     The Witness: And I never discussed it with any potential offeree.\n     The Court: Okay.\n     Q: Did the . . . United States . . . in this process ever jointly pursue any individualized inquiry to\n     determine whether each offeree was, in fact, a victim?\n     A: No.\n\n\n\n                                                       71\n\f 1   every race- or gender-conscious employment benefit that goes beyond make-whole relief is\n\n 2   affirmative action; some such benefits, like those at issue here, fall into the impermissible\n\n 3   Stotts category instead.\n\n 4          Finally, the City Defendants’ race- and gender-conscious actions are a poor fit for the\n\n 5   wrongs they seek to redress. True affirmative action, like that undertaken voluntarily by the\n\n 6   employers in Johnson and Weber and ordered by the court in Local 28, has the power to break\n\n 7   down old patterns of discrimination and prevent future discrimination against minorities and\n\n 8   women. But affirmative action also has its costs. Most significantly, it is race- or gender-\n\n 9   conscious, and it puts non-minority and male individuals at a disadvantage. See Ass’n Against\n\n10   Discrimination in Employment, Inc. v. City of Bridgeport, 647 F.2d 256, 280-81 (2d Cir.\n\n11   1981) (“Balanced against the broad equitable power to remedy Title VII violations is a\n\n12   recognition that ‘the use of racial goals means, in practice, that certain nonminority persons\n\n13   will be kept out solely on account of their race or ethnic background’ and that this impinges\n\n14   on the basic principle ‘that individuals are to be judged as individuals, not as members of\n\n15   particular racial groups.’” (quoting EEOC v. Local 638, Local 28 of Sheet Metal Workers Int’l\n\n16   Ass’n, 532 F.2d 821, 827 (2d Cir. 1976)) (modifications omitted)). Make-whole relief,\n\n17   likewise, is a powerful remedy for past wrongs. By putting the victims of discrimination\n\n18   where they would have been, but for the discrimination, make-whole relief not only undoes\n\n19   much of the harm caused to the victims themselves, but also provides examples so that others\n\n20   know that they, too, can overcome this country’s history of discrimination in the workplace.\n\n21   See Franks v. Bowman Transp. Co., 424 U.S. 747, 763-68 & n.28 (1976). But make-whole\n\n\n\n\n                                                      72\n\f 1   relief is not free either. Someone has to pay for it—most often the non-minority and male\n\n 2   employees, as well as the employer.\n\n 3          Because of the costs inherent in both affirmative action and make-whole relief, anyone\n\n 4   attempting to provide either of these forms of relief—whether it be a court imposing a remedy\n\n 5   under § 706(g) after a Title VII violation has been found, or the Government proposing a\n\n 6   settlement to an employer, or an employer acting voluntarily—must be exceptionally careful\n\n 7   to ensure that the employer’s proposed action is properly tailored to achieve whichever of\n\n 8   these two types of remedies for discrimination is sought. That is not to say that one cannot\n\n 9   use affirmative action and make-whole relief at the same time; of course one can. See, e.g.,\n\n10   Local 28, 478 U.S. at 473 n.44 (noting that, along with imposing the affirmative action plan,\n\n11   the district court also gave backpay to specified individual victims of discrimination); cf.\n\n12   Ass’n Against Discrimination in Employment, 647 F.2d at 278 (noting that these “two\n\n13   categories [of relief] may overlap to some extent, although their intended functions differ”).\n\n14   But a court or employer planning to give out a race- or gender-conscious employment benefit,\n\n15   or a Title VII remedy, should always ask first: What is the purpose of what I am doing? (1)\n\n16   Am I trying to give make-whole relief to individual people who I think are victims of past\n\n17   discrimination, (2) am I trying to implement a non-individualized, class-wide affirmative\n\n18   action plan to dismantle prior patterns of discrimination and prevent future discrimination, or\n\n19   (3) am I trying to do both? Only after these questions have been answered can an\n\n20   appropriately tailored plan or plans be put in place. The Government and the City Defendants\n\n21   should have considered these questions before taking action. Instead, according to the\n\n\n\n\n                                                      73\n\f 1   testimony that the district court credited, the Government never explained why it wanted the\n\n 2   Offerees to get retroactive seniority, and the City Defendants never asked.44\n\n 3          The necessity of avoiding Stotts-like “remedies,”—that is, non-remedial,\n\n 4   individualized, race- or sex-conscious employment benefits—is not merely an abstract,\n\n 5   doctrinal matter. It affects real people in tangible ways. In the instant case, Ruben Miranda,\n\n 6   the plaintiff in Miranda, may be the clearest example of how the City Defendants’ remedy\n\n 7   does not fit. He is a Hispanic male. He studied for, took, and passed Exam 5040, which\n\n 8   allegedly discriminated against Hispanics. As a reward for overcoming this hurdle, he was\n\n 9   hired as a Custodian—only to be told, some years later, that other, newly appointed\n\n10   Custodians, a specified group of women, blacks, Hispanics, and Asians, would be put ahead\n\n11   of him in seniority. As a result, he could be laid off before these newcomers would be, and he\n\n12   would—and, as it turns out, did—lose school transfers to them. Thus, a Hispanic Custodian\n\n13   was hampered in attaining his career goals, including a transfer to a larger and higher-paying\n\n14   school, because of a settlement agreement that the Caldero and Arroyo Intervenors insist is an\n\n15   affirmative action plan for, among others, Hispanics.45\n\n\n     44\n        The problematic resemblances between the process that led to the settlement agreement in the\n     instant case and the process that led to the consent decree in Stotts are many. See Stotts, 467\n     U.S. at 588-89 (O’Connor, J., concurring) (“To be sure, in 1980, respondents could have gone to\n     trial and established illegal discrimination in the Department's past hiring practices, identified its\n     specific victims, and possibly obtained retroactive seniority for those individuals. Alternatively,\n     in 1980, in negotiating the consent decree, respondents could have sought the participation of the\n     union, negotiated the identities of the specific victims with the union and employer, and possibly\n     obtained limited forms of retroactive relief. But respondents did none of these things. They chose\n     to avoid the costs and hazards of litigating their claims. They negotiated with the employer\n     without inviting the union's participation. They entered into a consent decree without\n     establishing any specific victim’s identity.” (footnote omitted)).\n     45\n        This is not to say that the retroactive seniority of the Offerees to whom Miranda lost transfers\n     might not be lawful for some reason other than as part of an “affirmative action” plan. If the\n\n                                                      74\n\f 1           For all these reasons, while some or all of the retroactive seniority awards may be\n\n 2   defensible on some other ground, they are not defensible as part of an affirmative action plan.\n\n 3   The City Defendants therefore cannot use the Weber/Johnson defense to the Brennan\n\n 4   Plaintiffs’ § 703(a) prima facie case.\n\n 5   V.      Strong Basis in Evidence\n\n 6           The Brennan Plaintiffs have made out a prima facie case of disparate treatment under\n\n 7   § 703(a) of Title VII, and we have rejected the first defense relied on by the City Defendants,\n\n 8   that of “affirmative action” under Johnson and Weber. We next consider the City\n\n 9   Defendants’ second defense: that the retroactive seniority awards to the Offerees were\n\n10   intended as make-whole relief to victims of the City Defendants’ previous testing and\n\n11   recruiting practices that had a disparate racial and gender impact.\n\n12           We hold that this defense—remedying disparate impact—is governed by Ricci.\n\n13   “[B]efore an employer can engage in intentional discrimination for the asserted purpose of\n\n14   avoiding or remedying an unintentional disparate impact, the employer must have a strong\n\n15   basis in evidence to believe it will be subject to disparate-impact liability if it fails to take the\n\n16   race-conscious, discriminatory action.” 129 S. Ct. at 2677. The City Defendants’ action was\n\n\n\n\n     City Defendants had a strong basis in evidence that they would be liable to people like the\n     Caldero and Arroyo Intervenors in a disparate impact suit, and that in a world without that\n     disparate impact Miranda would likely have been hired after the Offerees and would have lost\n     the transfers to them, then the City Defendants’ actions would be justified as to him. Cf. Ass’n\n     Against Discrimination in Employment, 647 F.2d at 287 (approving, under § 706(g), make-whole\n     competitive seniority to minority firefighters who were discriminatorily denied employment,\n     while four incumbent minority firefighters did not receive retroactive seniority).\n\n                                                        75\n\f 1   race- and gender-conscious, and it was taken for the asserted purpose of remedying an\n\n 2   unintentional disparate impact. It is therefore subject to Ricci.46\n\n 3          Our reading of Ricci is that a strong basis in evidence that an employer will be subject\n\n 4   to disparate-impact liability requires that, at the time it takes the “race-conscious,\n\n 5   discriminatory action,” the employer be faced with both (1) a prima facie case of disparate\n\n 6   impact against itself (or perhaps a strong basis in evidence of a prima facie case), and (2) a\n\n 7   strong basis in evidence either (a) that the employment practice having the disparate impact\n\n 8   was neither job-related nor consistent with business necessity, or (b) that there was an equally\n\n 9   valid, less discriminatory alternative, that the employer had refused to adopt, that would have\n\n10   served the employer’s needs. As detailed in Part V.A, infra, we hold that, under Ricci, a\n\n11   “strong basis in evidence” of non-job-relatedness or of a less discriminatory alternative\n\n12   requires more than speculation, more than a few scattered statements in the record, and more\n\n13   than a mere fear of litigation, but less than the preponderance of the evidence that would be\n\n14   necessary for actual liability. This is what it means when courts say that the employer must\n\n15   have an objectively reasonable fear of disparate-impact liability.\n\n16          The case before us also presents an additional problem not at issue in Ricci. Even if an\n\n17   employer has a strong basis in evidence that it faces liability for disparate impact, it may be\n\n18   unclear to whom the employer might face liability, or, if the disparate-impact case were\n\n19   brought by the Government, who might be entitled to court-ordered relief under § 706(g) and\n\n20   to what extent such individuals would receive relief. In the instant case, it was unclear at the\n\n\n     46\n       We need not and do not decide what standard applies when an employer takes a race- or\n     gender-conscious action to avoid or remedy disparate-treatment liability. See, e.g., Carey v.\n     U.S. Postal Serv., 812 F.2d 621, 624-26 (10th Cir. 1987).\n\n                                                       76\n\f1    time of the City Defendants’ actions, and it remains unclear today, exactly who among the\n\n2    Offerees was a victim of any disparate-impact discrimination that might have occurred, and\n\n3    how much retroactive seniority was necessary to make such individuals whole. We hold that\n\n4    the strong-basis-in-evidence standard of Ricci applies to these questions too.\n\n5           Thus, the employer must have a strong basis in evidence not only that it will actually\n\n6    be found liable for disparate impact, but also that, at the remedial stage following such a\n\n7    finding of liability, a court might well impose (pursuant to § 706(g)) a make-whole remedy\n\n8    equivalent to or broader than what the employer has done voluntarily. Put differently, when\n\n9    an employer, instead of litigating and having a court impose an equitable remedy, undertakes\n\n10   unilaterally the “process of recreating the past,” Int’l Broth. of Teamsters v. United States, 431\n\n11   U.S. 324, 372 (1977), the employer must have a strong basis in evidence that its race- or\n\n12   gender-conscious action, “as nearly as possible, ‘recreate[s] the conditions and relationships\n\n13   that would have been had there been no’ unlawful discrimination,” id. (quoting Franks v.\n\n14   Bowman Transp. Co., Inc., 424 U.S. 747, 769 (1976)). As with the employer’s fear of\n\n15   disparate-impact liability, the employer’s reconstruction of the past must, that is, be\n\n16   objectively reasonable.\n\n17          A.      What Is a Strong Basis in Evidence?\n\n18          It is not immediately obvious from Ricci what constitutes a “strong basis in evidence”\n\n19   in the Title VII disparate-impact context. The standard is new in this context, and the\n\n20   Supreme Court has not yet had occasion to describe its operations in detail, for in Ricci the\n\n21   court held that the standard had manifestly not been satisfied. See 129 S. Ct. at 2681\n\n22   (“[T]here is no evidence—let alone the required strong basis in evidence—that the tests were\n\n\n\n                                                      77\n\f1    flawed because they were not job-related or because other, equally valid and less\n\n2    discriminatory tests were available to the City.”). Our task, therefore, is to provide, as best we\n\n 3   can, some guidance for the district court in applying the Ricci strong-basis-in-evidence test to\n\n 4   the facts of this case.\n\n 5                   1.        Strong Basis in Evidence of Liability\n\n 6           Some of the general contours of the strong-basis-in-evidence standard are evident\n\n 7   from Ricci. First, the standard is objective, not subjective, and it therefore focuses on the\n\n8    strength of the evidence of liability, not the strength of the employer’s fear of litigation. See\n\n9    id. at 2675 (stating that “[a] mere good-faith fear of disparate-impact liability” is inadequate);\n\n10   id. at 2677 (referring to “an objective, strong basis in evidence”); id. at 2681 (“Fear of\n\n11   litigation alone cannot justify an employer’s reliance on race . . . .”).\n\n12           Second, the strength of the evidence of disparate-impact liability is measured at the\n\n13   time the employer took the race- or gender-based action. In examining the evidence\n\n14   marshaled by New Haven, the Ricci Court considered only what the city knew at the time it\n\n15   made its decision, and not any further information that arose afterwards. See id. at 2678-81.\n\n16   Similarly, the Court generally referred to the absence of a strong basis in evidence in the past\n\n17   tense. E.g., id. at 2681 (“On the record before us, there is no genuine dispute that the City\n\n18   lacked a strong basis in evidence to believe it would face disparate-impact liability if it\n\n19   certified the examination results.”). The rationale underlying Ricci, moreover, confirms that\n\n20   the evidence is to be gauged at the time of the race- or sex-conscious employer action. The\n\n21   strong-basis-in-evidence standard is intended to “strike[] a . . . balance” between the Title VII\n\n\n\n\n                                                       78\n\f 1   provisions concerning disparate treatment and disparate impact, so that employers make the\n\n 2   right decisions in the first place. Id. at 2675.\n\n 3           Thus, Ricci seeks to avoid both creating a legal framework under which “employers\n\n 4   likely would hesitate before taking voluntary action for fear of later being proven wrong in the\n\n 5   course of litigation and then held to account for disparate treatment,” and one under which\n\n 6   employers would undertake “race- [or gender-]based action at the slightest hint of disparate\n\n 7   impact.” See id. at 2674-75. If evidence from after the employer’s race- or gender-based\n\n 8   decision were taken into account, there would be false negatives and false positives. Some\n\n 9   employers might take inappropriate race- or gender-based actions in the hope or expectation\n\n10   that a strong basis in evidence would later emerge; other employers who actually do have a\n\n11   strong basis in evidence might refuse to take voluntary action for fear that later evidence\n\n12   would undermine that basis. Moreover, still other employers would be held liable for\n\n13   disparate treatment or for disparate impact even though based on the evidence of disparate\n\n14   impact then before them, they acted correctly at the time they made their decisions. All such\n\n15   results are inimical to Ricci.47\n\n16           Third, either an actual prima facie case of disparate-impact liability is required, or a\n\n17   strong basis in evidence of a prima facie case is required. Ricci does not say which, as the\n\n18   City of New Haven was faced with an undisputed prima facie case of disparate impact. Id. at\n\n19   2677-78. Nevertheless, because Ricci explicitly rejects the proposition that “an employer in\n\n\n     47\n        It goes without saying, however, that an employer cannot, in order to obtain a desired result,\n     ignore, or intentionally avoid learning, evidence that bears on the likelihood of disparate-impact\n     liability. An employer who did that would be using the “strong basis in evidence” defense as a\n     pretext for intentional discrimination. See Ricci, 129 S. Ct. at 2687-88 (Alito, J., concurring);\n     see also id. at 2679 (majority opinion) (“The City . . . turned a blind eye to evidence that\n\n                                                        79\n\f 1   fact must be in violation of the disparate-impact provision before it can use compliance as a\n\n 2   defense in a disparate-treatment suit,” it seems likely that no more than a strong basis in\n\n 3   evidence that a prima facie case exists would suffice.48 Id. at 2674. If an actual prima facie\n\n 4   case were required, then an employer who used an employment practice that was obviously\n\n 5   not job-related and who was faced with a strong basis in evidence, but not an actual prima\n\n 6   facie case, of disparate impact, “likely would hesitate before taking voluntary action for fear\n\n 7   of later being proven wrong in the course of litigation and then held to account for disparate\n\n 8   treatment.” Id. But we decline to decide this issue here, leaving it to be determined by the\n\n 9   district court in the first instance, if it proves to be necessary to deciding the case.\n\n10           Fourth, because of the objective nature of the strong-basis-in-evidence test and its\n\n11   focus on the likelihood of actual liability, the test requires that the employer have a strong\n\n12   basis in evidence either (1) that its challenged employment procedures are not job-related, or\n\n13   (2) that there was a less discriminatory alternative procedure which the employer refused to\n\n14   adopt. These are, as the Ricci Court explained, the two conditions under which an employer\n\n15   can be liable for disparate impact after a plaintiff has shown a prima facie case of disparate\n\n16   impact. See Ricci, 129 S. Ct. at 2678.49\n\n\n\n     supported the exams’ validity.”).\n     48\n        Regardless of whether it is an actual prima facie case or a strong basis in evidence of a prima\n     facie case that is required, it is clear that this requirement is a necessary condition, and not a\n     sufficient condition, for the Ricci defense. “[A] prima facie case of disparate-impact liability—\n     essentially, a threshold showing of a significant statistical disparity, and nothing more—is far\n     from a strong basis in evidence that the City would have been liable under Title VII had it\n     certified the results.” Ricci, 129 S. Ct. at 2678 (citation omitted).\n     49\n        These theories were codified in Title VII in 1991, see 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)(1)(A), (C).\n     Previously, they had been adopted by the Supreme Court as interpretations of § 703(a)(2) of\n     Title VII. See Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405, 425 (1975) (“If an employer does\n     then meet the burden of proving that its tests are ‘job related,’ it remains open to the complaining\n\n                                                        80\n\f 1          A somewhat more difficult question is just how strong the evidence of non-job-\n\n 2   relatedness or a less discriminatory alternative must be. Two boundaries are clear from the\n\n 3   Ricci Court’s opinion. The evidence of liability certainly must be stronger than the evidence\n\n 4   New Haven presented in Ricci. Summary judgment against the city could not there be\n\n 5   avoided with what was described as “no evidence,” 129 S. Ct. at 2681, or, at most, “a few\n\n 6   stray (and contradictory) statements in the record,” id. at 2680. At the other end, a strong\n\n 7   basis in evidence that an employer will be liable for disparate impact must be less than what is\n\n 8   required to prove a disparate-impact violation (and hence than what is needed to prove non-\n\n 9   job-relatedness or the existence of a less discriminatory alternative). The strong-basis-in-\n\n10   evidence standard, Ricci says, “is not so restrictive that it allows employers to act only when\n\n11   there is a provable, actual violation.” Id. at 2676. The strong-basis-in-evidence test does not,\n\n12   therefore, require that there be a preponderance of the evidence of an actual disparate impact\n\n13   violation.\n\n14          We think Ricci suggests that a strong basis in evidence is a balanced standard that falls\n\n15   somewhere in the middle between these upper and lower extremes. In borrowing the strong-\n\n16   basis-in-evidence standard from a line of Equal Protection cases, the Ricci Court stated that\n\n17   those cases “recognized the tension between eliminating segregation and discrimination on\n\n18   the one hand and doing away with all governmentally imposed discrimination based on race\n\n\n\n     party to show that other tests or selection devices, without a similarly undesirable racial [or\n     gender] effect, would also serve the employer’s legitimate interest in ‘efficient and trustworthy\n     workmanship.’” (quoting McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802)); Griggs v. Duke Power Co.,\n     401 U.S. 424, 431 (1971) (“The Act proscribes not only overt discrimination but also practices\n     that are fair in form, but discriminatory in operation. The touchstone is business necessity. If an\n     employment practice which operates to exclude [minorities or women] cannot be shown to be\n     related to job performance, the practice is prohibited.”).\n\n                                                     81\n\f 1   on the other.” Id. at 2675. Balancing those two goals requires “evidentiary support for the\n\n 2   conclusion that remedial action is warranted,” id. (quoting Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Educ.,\n\n 3   476 U.S. 267, 277 (1986) (plurality opinion)) (modification omitted), and not just “an\n\n 4   amorphous claim that there has been past discrimination,” id. (quoting City of Richmond v.\n\n 5   J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 499 (1989)).\n\n 6          Nevertheless, and notably, a “strong basis in evidence” for purposes of Ricci and Title\n\n 7   VII is not necessarily the same as it is for Equal Protection Clause purposes. Id. at 2676.\n\n 8   While in the equal protection context a strong basis in evidence has been described as\n\n 9   “sufficient evidence to justify the conclusion that there has been prior discrimination,”\n\n10   Wygant, 476 U.S. at 277 (plurality opinion), Ricci, instead, explicitly does not require that an\n\n11   employer show that there has been a past disparate-impact violation of Title VII.\n\n12   Additionally, the Equal Protection Clause does not prohibit the government from taking\n\n13   actions which have an unintentional disparate impact, see Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229\n\n14   (1976), and the type of evidence that supports a disparate-impact claim is different from that\n\n15   which would support a disparate-treatment claim.50 Finally, unlike the Equal Protection\n\n\n     50\n        The Brennan Plaintiffs argue that Ricci requires a strong basis in evidence of intentional\n     discrimination, i.e., disparate treatment, when an employer claims that it is attempting to remedy\n     past discrimination rather than avoid a present or future violation. We agree with the\n     Government that the Brennan Plaintiffs’ argument cannot be squared with Ricci. Ricci says that\n     whenever an employer “engage[s] in intentional discrimination for the asserted purpose of\n     avoiding or remedying an unintentional disparate impact, the employer must have a strong basis\n     in evidence to believe it will be subject to disparate-impact liability if it fails to take the race-\n     conscious, discriminatory action.” 129 S. Ct. at 2677 (emphasis added). The Brennan Plaintiffs’\n     position would, instead, upset the Court’s careful balancing in Ricci by prohibiting an employer\n     from taking remedial action to avoid disparate-impact liability when the employer has a strong\n     basis in evidence of disparate impact (but not of disparate treatment). That would be so even if\n     the evidence of disparate impact was so overwhelming that it would only be a matter of time\n     before some plaintiff proved a violation against the employer. And, an employer in that situation\n\n                                                      82\n\f 1   Clause, Title VII has repeatedly been construed so as not to undermine employers’ ability to\n\n 2   undertake “voluntary compliance,” which is “the preferred means of achieving the objectives\n\n 3   of Title VII,” Ricci, 129 S. Ct. at 2674 (quoting Local No. 93, 478 U.S. at 515).\n\n 4           In sum, a strong basis in evidence of disparate-impact liability is an objectively\n\n 5   reasonable basis to fear such liability. It is evaluated at the time an employer takes a race-\n\n 6   conscious action. It relies on real evidence, not just subjective fear or speculation. Because it\n\n 7   focuses on liability rather than mere litigation, it requires both objectively strong evidence of\n\n 8   a prima facie case (or perhaps actual proof of a prima facie case) of disparate impact, and\n\n 9   objectively strong evidence of non-job-relatedness or a less discriminatory alternative.\n\n10                   2.      Strong Basis in Evidence of Necessity\n\n11           Even after an employer has shown a strong basis in evidence that it faces disparate-\n\n12   impact liability, the employer does not have carte blanche to take whatever race- or gender-\n\n13   conscious actions it pleases. Rather, “the employer must have a strong basis in evidence to\n\n14   believe it will be subject to disparate-impact liability if it fails to take the race-conscious [or\n\n15   gender-conscious], discriminatory action.” Id. at 2677 (emphasis added). That is to say,\n\n16   there must be a strong basis in evidence that the race- or gender-conscious action taken by the\n\n17   employer is necessary to avoid disparate-impact liability.\n\n18           This necessity issue was not squarely presented in Ricci, for two reasons. First, there\n\n19   was no strong basis in evidence that New Haven would have faced disparate-impact liability,\n\n20   so it was unnecessary to determine what New Haven was permitted to do to remedy the\n\n\n\n     would be unable to avoid some kind of Title VII liability, no matter what it did: if it remedied the\n     disparate impact, it would be liable for disparate treatment, but if it did nothing, it would be\n     liable for disparate impact. Such a result is directly contrary to Ricci’s whole rationale.\n\n                                                       83\n\f 1   disparate impact. Second, if New Haven had had a strong basis in evidence of disparate-\n\n 2   impact liability, then there would have been little question that refusal to certify the test\n\n 3   results was precisely what was necessary to avoid liability. There was, therefore, no need in\n\n 4   Ricci to undertake the difficult process of determining who might have been a victim of\n\n 5   discrimination and what sort of relief might have been required to make such individuals\n\n 6   whole. Cf. Teamsters, 431 U.S. at 371-72. It seems easier to say what would be necessary to\n\n 7   avoid a disparate-impact violation that is about to occur but has not yet happened, than it is to\n\n 8   say what is necessary to remedy such a violation years after it took place.\n\n 9          We think it makes good sense to require that an employer’s strong basis in evidence\n\n10   extend beyond the existence of disparate-impact liability, to the necessity of the employer’s\n\n11   chosen race- or sex- conscious remedy for that disparate impact. As with the requirement of a\n\n12   strong basis in evidence of liability, a strong basis in evidence of necessity “gives effect to\n\n13   both the disparate-treatment and disparate-impact provisions, allowing violations of one in the\n\n14   name of compliance with the other only in certain, narrow circumstances.” Ricci, 129 S. Ct.\n\n15   at 2676. In doing so, requiring a strong basis in evidence of necessity avoids extreme\n\n16   positions that would undermine the careful Ricci balancing of disparate treatment and\n\n17   disparate impact under Title VII. If a showing of actual necessity—i.e., a showing that the\n\n18   race- or sex-conscious action’s beneficiaries were actual victims who received make-whole\n\n19   relief—were mandated, employers would likely refuse to settle disparate-impact cases for fear\n\n20   of disparate-treatment liability. See Part V.B, infra; Ricci, 129 S. Ct. at 2674. But if anything\n\n21   less than a strong basis in evidence of necessity were required—for example, if “an\n\n22   employer’s good-faith belief that its actions were necessary to comply with Title VII’s\n\n\n                                                       84\n\f 1   disparate-impact provision” were “enough to justify race-conscious conduct,” then employers\n\n 2   might give out race-conscious benefits “even where there is little if any evidence of disparate-\n\n 3   impact discrimination” against the recipients of those benefits. See id. at 2674-75. We\n\n 4   therefore hold that the strong-basis-in-evidence standard of Ricci applies not only to the\n\n 5   question of disparate-impact liability, but also to the further question of whether the\n\n 6   employer’s race- or gender-conscious action is necessary to remedy that disparate impact.\n\n 7   Here too, the employer’s belief that its action is necessary to remedy disparate impact, i.e.,\n\n 8   that the beneficiaries of the action were victims of disparate impact and the action puts them\n\n 9   roughly where they would have been in the absence of discrimination, must be objectively\n\n10   reasonable in the above defined sense.\n\n11          B.      The Government’s “Actual Violation” Standard\n\n12          The Government and the Brennan Plaintiffs ask us to go beyond the explicit\n\n13   requirements of Ricci and hold—either in all cases or, alternatively, in those cases where an\n\n14   employer’s race- or gender-conscious action may implicate contractual seniority rights—that\n\n15   the employer can be liable even if its actions are supported by a strong basis in evidence that\n\n16   the actions are necessary to avoid or remedy a disparate-impact violation. According to them,\n\n17   a § 703(a) reverse-discrimination plaintiff can win by showing (a) that the employer’s\n\n18   employment practices were not actually job-related and that there was not actually a less\n\n19   discriminatory alternative, or (b) that some or all recipients of race- or gender-conscious relief\n\n20   were not actual victims who received no more than make-whole relief. If the plaintiffs make\n\n21   this showing, they say, then the employer is liable to them for reverse discrimination. We\n\n22   disagree. The positions advocated by the Government and the Brennan Plaintiffs are\n\n\n\n                                                      85\n\f 1   irreconcilable with Ricci and rest on a confusion about the procedural posture of this case.\n\n 2   Additionally, these parties’ focus on contractual seniority rights is inappropriate because the\n\n 3   remedy for an employer’s unilateral and non-court-sanctioned breach of a collective\n\n 4   bargaining agreement is to be sought (and obtained) by the union through the labor grievance\n\n 5   and arbitration process, and not by means of a § 703(a) action brought by individual union\n\n 6   members in federal court. As a result, the Ricci strong-basis-in-evidence standard is not\n\n 7   altered in cases where the plaintiffs allege a breach of contract.\n\n 8                  1.      Ricci Does Not Require a Showing of Actual Liability or Actual\n 9                          Victims\n10\n11          The first, and most significant, problem with the arguments of the Government and the\n\n12   Brennan Plaintiffs is that they ask us to do something that Ricci explicitly tells us not to do:\n\n13          Petitioners . . . suggest that an employer must be in violation of the disparate-impact\n14          provision before it can use compliance as a defense in a disparate-treatment suit. . . .\n15          [T]his is overly simplistic and too restrictive of Title VII’s purpose. The rule\n16          petitioners offer would run counter to what we have recognized as Congress’s intent\n17          that “voluntary compliance” be “the preferred means of achieving the objectives of\n18          Title VII.” Forbidding employers to act unless they know, with certainty, that a\n19          practice violates the disparate-impact provision would bring compliance efforts to a\n20          near standstill. Even in the limited situations when this restricted standard could be\n21          met, employers likely would hesitate before taking voluntary action for fear of later\n22          being proven wrong in the course of litigation and then held to account for disparate\n23          treatment.\n24\n25   Id. at 2674 (quoting Local No. 93, 478 U.S. at 515) (citations omitted). The Brennan\n\n26   Plaintiffs are asking us to give them the opportunity to prove, in the course of litigation, that\n\n27   the City Defendants were wrong when they deemed some Offerees likely victims of disparate-\n\n28   impact discrimination, and to hold the City Defendants liable for disparate treatment if any\n\n29   such error was made. But that is just what the Supreme Court has forbidden. The Brennan\n\n30   Plaintiffs are entitled to put those supporting the City Defendants to their proof that the City\n\n                                                      86\n\f 1   Defendants had a strong basis in evidence that the challenged testing and recruiting practices\n\n 2   were not job-related or that there was a less discriminatory alternative to those practices, and\n\n 3   that the City Defendants’ actions were necessary to avoid the resulting disparate-impact\n\n 4   liability as to particular Offerees—but that is all.51\n\n 5           True, the Brennan Plaintiffs and the Government would put the burden of proof on the\n\n 6   reverse-discrimination plaintiffs, and not on the employer, to show the absence of an actual\n\n 7   Title VII violation against actual victims. But that shift of the burden of proof does nothing to\n\n8    avoid the dangers on which Ricci focused. Employers, acting from an ex ante perspective,\n\n9    would still view themselves as “[f]orbidd[en] . . . to act unless they know, with certainty, that\n\n10   a practice violates the disparate-impact provision.” Id. In order for the strong-basis-in-\n\n11   evidence standard to work the way the Supreme Court seems to have intended it, an employer\n\n12   who does have a strong basis in evidence that a race- or gender-conscious action is necessary\n\n13   to avoid or remedy a disparate-impact violation must be able to rely on its strong basis in\n\n14   evidence when a reverse-discrimination challenge occurs. Otherwise, “employers likely\n\n15   would hesitate before taking voluntary action for fear of later being proven wrong in the\n\n\n     51\n       There are, of course, several avenues by which a disparate treatment plaintiff might defeat an\n     employer’s satisfaction of the strong-basis-in-evidence standard. In some circumstances, for\n     instance, the potential disparate impact challenge to the employer may be so patently meritless\n     that a court could reasonably conclude that the employer could not have had an objectively\n     reasonable fear of liability. In other circumstances, the plaintiff might demonstrate that the\n     employer’s concern about disparate impact liability was pretextual and that the real reason for its\n     discriminatory treatment was an “illegitimate” one, such as “to placate a politically important\n     racial constituency.” Ricci, 129 S. Ct. at 2684 (Alito, J., concurring). But when and how such\n     arguments might prevail under Ricci are issues that we need not address in this case. Here, the\n     Government and the Brennan Plaintiffs ask us to hold that they can rebut the Ricci defense\n     simply by disproving the existence of an actual disparate impact violation. And that position\n     does not square with Ricci, which makes clear that the absence of an actual violation is not,\n     without more, sufficient to defeat a strong-basis-in-evidence showing.\n\n                                                       87\n\f 1   course of litigation and then held to account for disparate treatment.” Id. If employers who\n\n 2   had the required strong basis in evidence that specific Offerees were past victims of disparate\n\n 3   impact could be found liable anyway when the plaintiff shows that there was no actual\n\n 4   disparate-impact violation or that the race- or gender-conscious action benefited people who\n\n 5   were not actual victims (or benefited actual victims beyond the extent of their victimhood), it\n\n 6   would be of little comfort to the employer that the burden of proof rested with the other side.\n\n 7          The Brennan Plaintiffs and the Government also assert, in the alternative, that their\n\n 8   “actual violation” approach applies only in those cases where the employer’s voluntary action\n\n 9   allegedly violates the contractual rights of those employees who are not the beneficiaries of\n\n10   the race- or gender-conscious action. But there is no basis for limiting Ricci in this way.\n\n11   Indeed, the Ricci Court stated, “we adopt the strong-basis-in-evidence standard as a matter of\n\n12   statutory construction to resolve any conflict between the disparate-treatment and disparate-\n\n13   impact provisions of Title VII.” Id. at 2676 (emphasis added). Ricci applies the strong-basis-\n\n14   in-evidence standard to all such conflicts, regardless of whether they involve contractual\n\n15   rights. Significantly, there were contractual rights in Ricci, and the Court never suggested that\n\n16   these would give rise to an exception to its careful balancing of disparate treatment and\n\n17   disparate impact. See id. at 2665 (describing the New Haven firefighters’ CBA and its\n\n18   requirements concerning the promotional examinations, including a specific percentage\n\n19   weighting of the written and oral examinations); id. at 2679 (reviewing the job-relatedness of\n\n20   the percentage weighting under the strong-basis-in-evidence standard, not an actual job-\n\n21   relatedness standard).\n\n22                  2.        The Consent-Decree, Settlement-Approval, and § 706(g) Cases Do Not\n23                            Apply in the § 703(a) Context\n\n                                                     88\n\f 1\n 2          The Government and the Brennan Plaintiffs cite, in support of their position, several\n\n 3   cases addressing the consequences of a court’s entering of a settlement agreement as a consent\n\n 4   decree, a court’s approval of a settlement, or a court’s ordering of a remedy under § 706(g) of\n\n 5   Title VII. If we were to import into § 703(a) the standards applicable in those cases, then the\n\n 6   City Defendants could, indeed, be liable for disparate treatment even if they had demonstrated\n\n 7   that they had the strong basis in evidence required by Ricci. But those cases, while they have\n\n 8   varying degrees of relevance, do not control the case before us. In the instant case, the City\n\n 9   Defendants unilaterally modified their employees’ seniority dates while the magistrate judge’s\n\n10   approval of the settlement was on appeal to this Court. No court had ordered the City\n\n11   Defendants to do this, nor had all appeals of the magistrate judge’s decision been exhausted.\n\n12   And the district court’s decision, subsequent to our appeal, not to enter as a consent decree the\n\n13   disputed paragraphs of the settlement agreement—which, by its terms, had by then expired—\n\n14   has not been appealed and would be moot in any event. See supra Part II. As a result,\n\n15   whatever standard applies in a case in which a court is ordering a remedy after a violation has\n\n16   been proven, or in which a court is deciding whether to approve a settlement or to enter it as a\n\n17   consent decree, is not germane to this case which does not present any of those situations.\n\n18   Here, the only question remaining before us is whether the employer’s unilateral race- and\n\n19   gender-conscious action taken for the purported purpose of remedying disparate impact\n\n20   violates § 703(a). And that question is governed by Ricci.52\n\n\n     52\n       The Government also argues that our mandate in NYC Board II requires a showing that the\n     Offerees were actual victims of discrimination. In NYC Board II, we ordered that the Brennan\n     Plaintiffs “be accorded discovery and other rights with regard to their claim that any impairment\n     by the Agreement of their interests . . . in their seniority rights as Custodians and Custodian\n\n                                                     89\n\f 1          The Government first relies on United States v. City of Hialeah, 140 F.3d 968 (11th\n\n 2   Cir. 1998), and Kirkland v. N.Y. State Dep’t of Correctional Servs., 711 F.2d 1117 (2d Cir.\n\n 3   1983). Both of these cases deal with court-approved employer action, not unilateral employer\n\n 4   action. In City of Hialeah, the Eleventh Circuit reviewed a district court’s decision not to\n\n 5   enter as a consent decree one part of a settlement agreement between the Government and the\n\n 6   City of Hialeah. The disputed part of the consent decree purported to abrogate the contractual\n\n 7   seniority rights of the city’s unionized incumbent police officers and firefighters. The unions\n\n 8   had not been invited to participate in the settlement discussions, and they did not give their\n\n 9   consent. The Eleventh Circuit held that “[a] district court may not enter parts of a proposed\n\n10   consent decree that operate to diminish the legal rights of a party who objects to the decree on\n\n11   that basis.” Id. at 984; see also United States v. City of Miami, 664 F.2d 435, 436 (5th Cir.\n\n12   1981) (en banc) (Rubin, J., concurring); id. at 448 (Gee, J., concurring in part and dissenting\n\n13   in part).53 In the case before us, the district court did not enter the disputed portions of the\n\n\n\n     Engineers would constitute impermissible discrimination rather than a proper restorative remedy\n     based on past discrimination against the Offerees.” 260 F.3d at 133. The Government says that\n     if we do not require a showing of actual victimhood, such discovery would have been “a\n     meaningless exercise.” This argument, too, is based on confusion about the case’s procedural\n     posture. At the time of NYC Board II, the settlement agreement had not yet expired, the Brennan\n     and Miranda § 703(a) suits had not yet been filed, and the question we expected the district court\n     to address on remand was whether to approve the settlement and enter it as a consent decree.\n     Now, the settlement agreement has expired and there is no longer any issue over whether the\n     disputed paragraphs should be entered as a consent decree. The purpose of the discovery\n     mentioned in NYC Board II was for the district court to make a fully informed decision on\n     whether to enter the consent decree. At the time, we were not anticipating a not-yet-filed §\n     703(a) suit and announcing a standard for it in advance. In any event, even if our reference to\n     discovery had been for the purpose of such an as yet non-existent § 703(a) suit, it would still not\n     be “meaningless,” because the evidence to be discovered under the strong-basis-in-evidence\n     standard and under the actual-liability-to-actual-victims standard would be largely the same.\n     53\n        In Grant v. Local 638, 373 F.3d 104, 110-111 (2d Cir. 2004), we disagreed with City of\n     Hialeah’s analysis of the appealability of a district court’s decision not to enter a consent decree.\n\n                                                       90\n\f 1   settlement as a consent decree. The principle that a consent decree cannot dispose of the\n\n 2   claims of a party that withholds its consent, therefore, has no application here.\n\n 3          Kirkland involved this Court’s review of a district court’s decision, in a Title VII\n\n 4   disparate-impact case brought by private plaintiffs, to enter a class action settlement pursuant\n\n 5   to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e). See Kirkland, 711 F.2d at 1121. The settlement agreement called for\n\n 6   adjustments to the eligibility lists derived from the allegedly discriminatory civil service\n\n 7   examination. We affirmed the district court’s judgment, and we distinguished the Fifth\n\n 8   Circuit’s decision in City of Miami on the ground that the non-minority intervenors in\n\n 9   Kirkland had no contractual rights that the settlement would alter. Id. at 1126-31. According\n\n10   to the Government, we must permit the Brennan Plaintiffs to show that the disputed tests and\n\n11   recruiting practices in the case before us are not job-related, because here, the Government\n\n12   says, the Brennan Plaintiffs’ contractual rights will be impaired.\n\n13          The problem with this contention and its reliance on City of Hialeah and Kirkland is\n\n14   that, unlike some consent decrees or court-approved class-action settlements, a court’s\n\n15   holding of no more than that a private settlement agreement or an employer’s unilateral action\n\n16   does not violate § 703(a) does nothing to impair the contractual rights of third parties.\n\n17   Consider a simple example: an employee is fired by her employer. She sues the employer on\n\n18   two theories: (1) the employer violated § 703(a) by firing her because she is female; and (2)\n\n19   the employer breached her employment contract. If a court rejects theory (1), the employee\n\n20   nevertheless remains free to pursue theory (2). Her contractual rights, and any other legal\n\n21   rights she may have against her employer, remain unimpaired. Moreover, it is well settled\n\n\n\n     The case before us does not present that issue, for the district court’s decision not to enter the\n\n                                                      91\n\f 1   that no voluntary settlement—whether entered as a consent decree, approved under Rule\n\n 2   23(e), or agreed to in private—can dispose of the claims of a non-consenting third party. See\n\n 3   Martin v. Wilks, 490 U.S. 755, 768 (1989), superseded by statute on other grounds, Civil\n\n 4   Rights Act of 1991, Pub. L. No. 102-166, 105 Stat. 1071 (“A voluntary settlement in the form\n\n 5   of a consent decree between one group of employees and their employer cannot possibly\n\n 6   “settle,” voluntarily or otherwise, the conflicting claims of another group of employees who\n\n 7   do not join in the agreement.”); Local No. 93, 478 U.S. at 529 (“Of course, parties who\n\n 8   choose to resolve litigation through settlement may not dispose of the claims of a third party,\n\n 9   and a fortiori may not impose duties or obligations on a third party, without that party’s\n\n10   agreement. A court’s approval of a consent decree between some of the parties therefore\n\n11   cannot dispose of the valid claims of nonconsenting intervenors; if properly raised, these\n\n12   claims remain and may be litigated by the intervenor.”). The City Defendants voluntarily\n\n13   contracted with the Offerees and with the Government to give the Offerees retroactive\n\n14   seniority, but that contract cannot and does not “purport to resolve any claims the Union\n\n15   might have . . . as a matter of contract,” id. at 530.\n\n16           The Government compounds its error at the victim-identification stage. In the\n\n17   Government’s view, the district court should have applied the burden-shifting framework of\n\n18   International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324, 362-76 (1977). In\n\n19   Teamsters, the Supreme Court held:\n\n20           The proof of the pattern or practice supports an inference that any particular\n21           employment decision, during the period in which the discriminatory policy was in\n22           force, was made in pursuit of that policy. The Government need only show that an\n23           alleged individual discriminatee unsuccessfully applied for a job and therefore was a\n\n     settlement agreement as a consent decree has not been appealed.\n\n                                                        92\n\f1           potential victim of the proved discrimination. . . . [T]he burden then rests on the\n2           employer to demonstrate that the individual applicant was denied an employment\n3           opportunity for lawful reasons.\n4\n5    Id. at 362 (footnote omitted). As for nonapplicants,\n\n 6          A nonapplicant must show that he was a potential victim of unlawful discrimination.\n 7          Because he is necessarily claiming that he was deterred from applying for the job by\n 8          the employer’s discriminatory practices, his is the not always easy burden of proving\n 9          that he would have applied for the job had it not been for those practices. When this\n10          burden is met, the nonapplicant is in a position analogous to that of an applicant and\n11          is entitled to the presumption discussed [above].\n12\n13   Id. at 367-68 (citation omitted).\n\n14          Once again, the Government misperceives the procedural posture of the instant case.\n\n15   Teamsters applies when a court is ordering a remedy under § 706(g) of Title VII. But “the\n\n16   question of individual relief [under § 706(g)] does not arise until it has been proved that the\n\n17   employer has followed an employment policy of unlawful discrimination.” Id. at 361. In\n\n18   Teamsters and other § 706(g) cases, a § 703(a) violation had been proven and the question\n\n19   was what remedy the court should order. The case before us in its present posture is not about\n\n20   judicially ordered remedies at all. It is about voluntary employer action and its relation to §\n\n21   703(a). The only question we face is whether the City Defendants have violated § 703(a) by\n\n22   engaging in intentional reverse discrimination against the Brennan Plaintiffs. A § 706(g) case\n\n23   like Teamsters does not speak to that question. That is especially so because the Supreme\n\n24   Court has held that employers acting voluntarily can do more than a court could order them to\n\n25   do under § 706(g). See Johnson, 480 U.S. at 630 n.8. But if we were to apply Teamsters\n\n26   here, we would be telling employers precisely that they cannot give individual relief to\n\n27   employees except under the circumstances in which a court could order such relief under §\n\n28   706(g). Significantly, Ricci itself underscores the crucial distinction between voluntary\n\n                                                      93\n\f 1   employer action and court orders under § 706(g). As Ricci states, § 703(a) “is not so\n\n 2   restrictive that it allows employers to act only when there is a provable, actual [disparate-\n\n 3   impact] violation,” 129 S. Ct. at 2676, while an actual violation does have to be proven before\n\n 4   a court can impose a remedy under § 706(g). See Teamsters, 431 U.S. at 361.\n\n5              In distinguishing Teamsters from the case before us, we do not mean to suggest that its\n\n 6   discussion of victims is not relevant to the issues before us; quite the contrary. Teamsters’s\n\n 7   analysis of how district courts applying § 706(g) should determine who is an actual victim has\n\n 8   to be instructive for employers who are attempting unilaterally to remedy their own alleged\n\n 9   disparate-impact violations. It inevitably informs what constitutes a strong basis in evidence\n\n10   that particular parties were actual victims. For, like a district court applying § 706(g), an\n\n11   employer “will have to make a substantial number of individual determinations in deciding\n\n12   which of the minority employees were actual victims of the company’s discriminatory\n\n13   practices. After the victims have been identified, the [employer] must, as nearly as possible,\n\n14   recreate the conditions and relationships that would have been had there been no unlawful\n\n15   discrimination.” Id. at 371-72 (quotation marks omitted); see Part VI.C, infra. The\n\n16   employer’s determinations of these matters must be supported by a strong basis in evidence\n\n17   under Ricci, or else the employer’s race- or gender-conscious remedies will give rise to\n\n18   liability under § 703(a). But that does not mean that § 703(a) should be confused with §\n\n19   706(g), or that the district court should use the Teamsters burden-shifting framework rather\n\n20   than Ricci to determine whether the employer is liable to the reverse-discrimination\n\n21   plaintiffs.54\n\n\n     54\n          For a discussion of the relevance of Teamsters for what remedy is appropriate, see Part IX,\n\n                                                       94\n\f 1                  3.     The Brennan Plaintiffs Have Another Remedy for Any Breach of\n 2                         Contract by the City Defendants\n 3\n 4          The Brennan Plaintiffs, joined by the Government, further assert that, if we do not\n\n 5   hold that the contractual seniority rights contained in the Collective Bargaining Agreement\n\n 6   trigger an actual-violation-against-actual-victims standard, then “even though a consent\n\n 7   decree cannot be entered, those whose contract rights are diminished have no remedy that can\n\n 8   either prevent the unapproved settlement contract from being implemented or provide\n\n 9   damages to those injured.” Brennan Br. at 54. If the Brennan Plaintiffs’ assertion were true,\n\n10   it might well give us pause. But the problem with this argument is that “those whose contract\n\n11   rights are diminished” do have another remedy for any breach of contract. That remedy is the\n\n12   CBA’s grievance and arbitration process. Instead of using that remedy, the Brennan Plaintiffs\n\n13   seek to bring a contract claim with the wrong plaintiffs in the wrong forum. Claims for the\n\n14   breach of a CBA should be brought by the union before an arbitrator as provided in the CBA,\n\n15   not by individual union members in federal court.\n\n16          Whatever the outcome of this § 703(a) case, it is clear under long-established Supreme\n\n17   Court precedent that the Brennan Plaintiffs, through Local 891, are not barred from attacking\n\n18   the City Defendants’ actions in a contract suit based on the collective bargaining agreement.\n\n19   In W.R. Grace & Co. v. Local Union 759, International Union of United Rubber, Cork,\n\n20   Linoleum & Plastic Workers of America, 461 U.S. 757 (1983), for example, the employer,\n\n21   W.R. Grace, was under investigation by the EEOC for alleged discrimination against blacks\n\n22   and women. W.R. Grace saw its collective bargaining agreement with its employees’ union\n\n\n\n     infra. See also Cates v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 561 F.2d 1064, 1072 (2d Cir. 1977) (“[The\n     Supreme Court’s] decisions sharply distinguish[] the issues whether there has been a violation of\n\n                                                    95\n\f 1   expire in 1974, and there was a strike. During the strike, W.R. Grace hired strike\n\n 2   replacements, including women who took jobs never previously held by women. When the\n\n 3   strike was settled by the signing of a new collective bargaining agreement, the new agreement\n\n 4   provided that the old employees would get their shift-preference seniority back. But W.R.\n\n 5   Grace kept the strike-replacement women in their positions, ahead of men with greater\n\n 6   seniority who were entitled to those positions under the new collective bargaining agreement.\n\n 7   The men filed grievances pursuant to the CBA’s procedures. While arbitration of those\n\n 8   claims was pending, W.R. Grace entered into a conciliation agreement with the EEOC, which\n\n 9   provided that the women in the bargaining unit would not only keep their jobs ahead of the\n\n10   male employees with more seniority; the company would also, in the event of a reduction in\n\n11   force, lay off male employees with more seniority if necessary to maintain the percentage of\n\n12   women in the bargaining unit.\n\n13          W.R. Grace, acting under § 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. §\n\n14   185, sought an injunction against the Union to bar the arbitration of any grievances that\n\n15   looked to relief in conflict with the terms of the conciliation agreement. The Union\n\n16   counterclaimed to compel arbitration, while the EEOC asked, among other things, for a\n\n17   declaratory judgment that the conciliation agreement prevailed over the CBA. While cross-\n\n18   motions for summary judgment were pending, W.R. Grace laid off some male employees in\n\n19   violation of their contractual seniority rights. The district court granted summary judgment to\n\n20   the EEOC and W.R. Grace, holding that the conciliation agreement was paramount. The\n\n21   Union appealed, and while that appeal was pending W.R. Grace laid off some more male\n\n\n\n     Title VII and what the appropriate remedy is for such a violation . . . .”).\n\n                                                      96\n\f 1   employees pursuant to the conciliation agreement. Then the Court of Appeals reversed the\n\n 2   district court’s decision, and held that W.R. Grace had to arbitrate the grievances. An\n\n 3   arbitrator then awarded backpay to some of the male employees, finding that the contract had\n\n 4   been breached and that backpay was the appropriate remedy. W.R. Grace again sued under §\n\n 5   301, this time hoping to have the arbitration award set aside.\n\n 6          When this § 301 suit reached the Supreme Court, W.R. Grace and the United States\n\n 7   argued that the arbitration award, and the collective bargaining agreement, could not be\n\n 8   enforced because they were contrary to public policy. The Court disagreed:\n\n 9          Given the Company’s desire to reduce its workforce, it is undeniable that the\n10          Company was faced with a dilemma: it could follow the conciliation agreement as\n11          mandated by the District Court and risk liability under the collective bargaining\n12          agreement, or it could follow the bargaining agreement and risk both a contempt\n13          citation and Title VII liability. The dilemma, however, was of the Company’s own\n14          making. The company committed itself voluntarily to two conflicting contractual\n15          obligations. When the Union attempted to enforce its contractual rights, the\n16          Company sought a judicial declaration of its respective obligations under the\n17          contracts. During the course of this litigation, before the legal rights were finally\n18          determined, the Company again laid off employees and dishonored its contract with\n19          the Union. For these acts, the Company incurred liability for breach of contract. In\n20          effect, [the arbitrator] interpreted the collective bargaining agreement to allocate to\n21          the Company the losses caused by the Company’s decision to follow the District\n22          Court order that proved to be erroneous.\n23\n24   Id. at 767 (footnotes omitted). Because it was the employer’s fault that it had previously\n\n25   discriminated against women and then entered into two conflicting contracts, it was the\n\n26   employer that should bear the loss.\n\n27          W.R. Grace also argued that enforcing the arbitration award was contrary to the policy\n\n28   of voluntary compliance with Title VII. Id. at 770-71 (citing Alexander v. Gardner-Denver\n\n29   Co., 415 U.S. 36, 44 (1974)). The Supreme Court expressly rejected that argument too:\n\n\n\n\n                                                      97\n\f 1          Enforcement of the [arbitration] award will not inappropriately affect this public\n 2          policy. In this case, although the Company and the Commisison agreed to nullify the\n 3          collective bargaining agreement’s seniority provisions, the conciliation process did\n 4          not include the Union. Absent a judicial determination, the Commission, not to\n 5          mention the Company, cannot alter the collective bargaining agreement without the\n 6          Union’s consent. Permitting such a result would undermine the federal labor policy\n 7          that parties to a collective bargaining agreement must have reasonable assurance that\n 8          their contract will be honored. Although the ability to abrogate unilaterally the\n 9          provisions of a collective bargaining agreement might encourage an employer to\n10          conciliate with the Commission, the employer’s added incentive to conciliate would\n11          be paid for with the union’s contractual rights.\n12\n13   Id. at 771 (citations omitted; emphasis added).\n\n14          The City Defendants’ voluntary implementation of the settlement agreement in our\n\n15   case, like the conciliation agreement in W.R. Grace, cannot preclude enforcement of existing\n\n16   contractual rights contained in a collective bargaining agreement. If any of the Brennan\n\n17   Plaintiffs were to file a grievance with Local 891, and if Local 891 were to pursue that claim\n\n18   to arbitration, a court could not disturb any arbitration award on public policy grounds or\n\n19   because of any conflict with the settlement agreement.\n\n20          Grievance and arbitration is not simply an alternate remedy for any breach of the\n\n21   collective bargaining agreement; it is the proper remedy. The Supreme Court has rejected\n\n22   constructions of Title VII provisions that “would run counter to the national labor policy.”\n\n23   Am. Tobacco Co. v. Patterson, 456 U.S. 63, 77 (1982). The Brennan Plaintiffs’ position\n\n24   entails precisely such a construction. If the Brennan Plaintiffs wish to defend their contractual\n\n25   rights, the appropriate way to do so is not through a § 703(a) reverse-discrimination suit, but\n\n26   instead through the union grievance and arbitration process.55\n\n\n     55\n       The national labor policy under the National Labor Relations Act requires an employee’s\n     claim that her employer has breached a collective bargaining agreement to proceed first through\n     the union, under the agreement’s grievance and arbitration procedures. See Republic Steel Corp.\n\n                                                       98\n\f 1          It is, we emphasize, well established that collective-bargaining remedies are separate\n\n 2   and independent from Title VII remedies. See Int’l Union of Elec., Radio & Mach. Workers,\n\n 3   Local 790 v. Robbins & Myers, Inc., 429 U.S. 229, 236-37 (1976). “[T]he contractual rights\n\n 4   under a collective-bargaining agreement and the statutory right provided by Congress under\n\n 5   Title VII have legally independent origins and are equally available to the aggrieved\n\n6    employee.” Id. at 236 (quotation marks omitted). When an employee believes that she has\n\n7    suffered discrimination, she may proceed under the grievance procedure, under Title VII, or\n\n8    both, but the fact that the employee has one of these independent types of rights does not\n\n 9   entitle her to anything with respect to the other. See id. (holding that the statutory period for\n\n10   filing a claim with the EEOC is not tolled by the pendency of grievance or arbitration\n\n11   procedures under a CBA). “The distinctly separate nature of these contractual and statutory\n\n12   rights is not vitiated merely because both were violated as a result of the same factual\n\n13   occurrence.” Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., 415 U.S. 36, 50 (1974).56\n\n\n\n\n     v. Maddox, 379 U.S. 650, 652-53 (1965) (“As a general rule in cases to which federal law\n     applies, federal labor policy requires that individual employees wishing to assert contract\n     grievances must attempt use of the contract grievance procedure agreed upon by employer and\n     union as the mode of redress. If the union refuses to press or only perfunctorily presses the\n     individual’s claim, differences may arise as to the forms of redress then available. But unless the\n     contract provides otherwise, there can be no doubt that the employee must afford the union the\n     opportunity to act on his behalf.” (footnotes and citations omitted)).\n     56\n        The Supreme Court criticized some aspects of Gardner-Denver in its recent decision in 14\n     Penn Plaza LLC v. Pyett, 129 S. Ct. 1456, 1469-72 (2009), but nothing in Pyett suggests any\n     wavering in the Court’s commitment to the traditional separation between contractual CBA\n     rights and statutory Title VII rights. The Court only criticized Gardner-Denver’s “broad dicta\n     that was highly critical of the use of arbitration for the vindication of statutory antidiscrimination\n     rights.” Id. at 1469. And, while arbitration may be an appropriate place for the vindication of\n     Title VII rights, federal court is not an appropriate place for the vindication of CBA rights that\n     are subject to a grievance and arbitration procedure.\n\n                                                      99\n\f 1          The Brennan Plaintiffs are, of course, public employees, and the NLRA therefore does\n\n 2   not apply to them. See Ford v. D.C. 37 Union Local 1549, 579 F.3d 187, 188 (2d Cir. 2009)\n\n 3   (per curiam). But the New York law governing the relationships between public employees\n\n 4   and their unions follows the same principles as the NLRA. See, e.g., Bd. of Educ., Commack\n\n 5   Union Free Sch. Dist. v. Ambach, 517 N.E.2d 509, 512-13 (N.Y. 1987) (quoting heavily from\n\n 6   the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Maddox, and holding that “[o]nly when a union has\n\n 7   failed to represent an employee fairly—effectively depriving the employee of full use of the\n\n 8   agreed procedures—does concern for employees’ rights require that they be allowed to pursue\n\n 9   grievances beyond the contractual mechanism”). Unless there is a breach of the duty of fair\n\n10   representation, “an individual union member normally lacks standing to enforce the terms of a\n\n11   collective bargaining agreement between the union and the employer.” Spano v. Kings Park\n\n12   Cent. Sch. Dist., 877 N.Y.S.2d 163, 167 (N.Y. App. Div. 2009). It would be inappropriate for\n\n13   us to permit “individual employees,” contrary to these state-law policies borrowed from\n\n14   federal law, “to circumvent the grievance procedure in favor of other remedies.” Ambach,\n\n15   517 N.E.2d at 512.57\n\n\n     57\n        In rejecting the Brennan Plaintiffs’ and the Government’s claim that the Brennan Plaintiffs’\n     contractual rights entitle them to replace the Ricci strong-basis-in-evidence standard with an\n     actual-liability-to-actual-victims standard, we do not mean to suggest that we look with favor on\n     Title VII settlements which do not include unions that represent incumbent employees who hold\n     contractual rights that might conflict with such settlements. A recurring problem in such Title\n     VII settlements is that the employer may readily agree to modify terms of employment, such as\n     competitive seniority, in ways that impose costs on incumbent employees. Not surprisingly, in\n     such situations, the employer and the Government often leave the incumbent employees’ unions\n     out of the settlement negotiations. See, e.g., W.R. Grace, 461 U.S. at 770 n.14 (“[I]f the\n     Company had done nothing at all, the economic loss from failing to reduce the workforce would\n     have fallen on the Company. By an independent and voluntary act, the Company shifted this\n     loss to its male employees and thereby caused the injury remedied by the [arbitration] award.”\n     (citation omitted)); Stotts, 467 U.S. at 588 & n.3 (O’Connor, J., concurring) (“[I]n negotiating\n\n                                                    100\n\f 1          To summarize, in the case before us, we are neither asked to pass upon the propriety of\n\n 2   entering the disputed portions of the 1999 settlement agreement into a consent decree, nor to\n\n 3   enforce an agreement involving the incumbent employees’ union. We are confronted only\n\n 4   with a § 703(a) suit attacking a voluntary settlement between the Government and an\n\n 5   employer. When the Government and an employer agree, in such a private settlement and\n\n 6   without the consent of the union representing incumbent employees, to take away those\n\n 7   employees’ contractual rights for the benefit of alleged victims of discrimination, § 703(a) is\n\n 8   not the correct way for the incumbent employees to seek vindication of their rights under the\n\n 9   contract. The proper way is through the union grievance and arbitration process. As a result,\n\n10   the Brennan Plaintiffs’ asserted contractual rights do not alter the generally applicable Ricci\n\n11   standard, and their § 703(a) claim is subject to the Ricci strong-basis-in-evidence defense just\n\n12   like any other such claim.58\n\n\n\n     the consent decree, respondents could have sought the participation of the union, negotiated the\n     identities of the specific victims with the union and employer, and possibly obtained limited\n     forms of retroactive relief. But respondents did none of these things. . . . They negotiated with\n     the employer without inviting the union’s participation.”). In the case before us, the Government\n     initially included Local 891 in the 1995 pre-lawsuit settlement negotiations, but then cut the\n     union out. When settlement negotiations resumed after the lawsuit had been filed, the union was\n     not represented. J.A. at 292-93. Instead of leaving the union out of the picture, it is better for\n     the employer and the Government to include the incumbent employees’ union in any\n     negotiations with respect to settlement provisions that may conflict with the union’s contractual\n     rights.\n              And there is every reason for the union to participate on behalf of its members. Not the\n     least of these is that, if the case goes to litigation, the union runs the risk that the Government\n     will prove a Title VII violation and then the court, acting pursuant to Teamsters and Franks,\n     could issue a § 706(g) remedial order which infringes on the CBA more, and compensates\n     incumbent employees less, than what the union could have achieved in a negotiated settlement.\n     Moreover, this is so regardless of whether there is any allegation that the union itself has violated\n     Title VII, for “an award of retroactive seniority is appropriate even if there is no finding that the\n     union has also illegally discriminated.” Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, 455 U.S. 385, 400 (1982).\n     58\n        That is not to say, of course, that the CBA cannot in any way affect the court’s analysis of the\n\n                                                     101\n\f 1   VI.    Application of the Strong-Basis-in-Evidence Standard\n\n 2          Under the strong-basis-in-evidence standard, the City Defendants need to show three\n\n 3   things in order to avail themselves of the defense the Supreme Court recognized in Ricci: (1)\n\n 4   that they were faced with a prima facie (or, potentially, a strong basis in evidence of a prima\n\n 5   facie case) of disparate impact;59 (2) a strong basis in evidence that either the challenged\n\n 6   employment practice was not job-related or there was a less discriminatory alternative to the\n\n 7   practice; and (3) a strong basis in evidence that each Offeree was a victim of the challenged\n\n 8   practice and received no more than make-whole relief. This showing needs to be made\n\n 9   separately for each of the challenged employment practices—testing and recruiting.60\n\n10          The district court—understandably, as it decided this case before Ricci—erred in its\n\n11   Title VII analysis in several respects. First, the district court applied the “affirmative action”\n\n12   framework of Johnson and Weber, and therefore required for Title VII purposes only a\n\n13   “manifest imbalance” instead of a prima facie case of disparate impact. Second, the district\n\n14   court failed to require of the City Defendants a strong basis in evidence—or, for that matter,\n\n15   any evidence at all—either of non-job-relatedness or a less discriminatory alternative. Third,\n\n16   the district court held that no showing concerning victimhood was required to justify the\n\n17   awards of transfer and TCA seniority, but that a showing of actual victimhood was required\n\n\n\n     Brennan Plaintiffs’ § 703(a) claims. The Brennan Plaintiffs might attempt to argue, for instance,\n     that the CBA helps to discredit the City Defendants’ professed objectively reasonable belief that\n     they faced likely liability for disparate impact. But to say that a CBA can inform a court’s\n     application of the strong-basis-in-evidence standard is not to say that a CBA triggers application\n     of an altogether different standard. And for the reasons stated above, we cannot accept this latter\n     claim.\n     59\n        As discussed earlier, we leave open the question of whether Ricci requires only a strong basis\n     in evidence of a prima facie case. See supra Part V.A.1.\n     60\n        There is, of course, no requirement of a strong basis in evidence that each Offeree was a\n\n                                                      102\n\f 1   for layoff seniority. For all of these aspects of competitive seniority, the court should, instead,\n\n 2   have required a strong basis in evidence of victimhood.\n\n 3           Accordingly, and as further described in the discussion below, we remand for the\n\n 4   district court to apply this correct standard in the first instance.\n\n 5           A.      Prima Facie Case\n\n 6                   1.      Testing Discrimination\n\n 7           Before the district court, it was undisputed that the City Defendants were faced with a\n\n 8   prima facie case of disparate-impact testing discrimination for all three of the challenged\n\n 9   exams, except that the Brennan Plaintiffs questioned whether there was a prima facie case that\n\n10   Exam 8206 had a disparate impact on Hispanics. See NYC Board III, 448 F. Supp. 2d at 425-\n\n11   27. After an “evidentiary hearing,” the district court found that such a prima facie case had\n\n12   been made out. See NYC Board IV, 487 F. Supp. 2d at 224-32. The Brennan Plaintiffs have\n\n13   not appealed that determination. Accordingly, there is no reason for the district court to\n\n14   revisit it on remand.\n\n15                   2.      Recruiting Discrimination\n\n16           The district court held that the City Defendants were not faced with a prima facie case\n\n17   of disparate-impact recruiting discrimination, reasoning that although the Government had\n\n18   shown a disparity between the expected and actual numbers of female and minority test-\n\n19   takers, there was no “evidence connecting the . . . disparity to the Board’s recruiting practices,\n\n20   a causal link not established by the statistical evidence presented in support of the recruiting\n\n21   claim.” NYC Board IV, 487 F. Supp. 2d at 234; see also NYC Board III, 448 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n\n\n     victim of both challenged practices.\n\n                                                       103\n\f 1   446 n.57. The question of whether the district court erred in this respect is complicated. The\n\n 2   Government, for example, wishes to argue to that court that it did. Because the court below\n\n 3   reached its decision on this issue before Ricci, and because Ricci raises a question regarding\n\n 4   the proper standard to apply, we think it appropriate to remand this issue for further\n\n5    consideration in the light of the still-to-be-determined Ricci standard. We note in particular\n\n 6   that even if there was not an actual prima facie case of disparate impact recruiting liability,\n\n 7   Ricci might—but does not necessarily—permit a showing that the City Defendants had a\n\n 8   strong basis in evidence of such a prima facie case. See supra Part V.A.1. Whether such a\n\n 9   strong basis in evidence would suffice remains an open question. But the district court need\n\n10   not reach or decide this question if it finds that the City Defendants lacked even a strong basis\n\n11   in evidence of a prima facie case of recruiting discrimination.\n\n12           At the same time, we reject the Brennan Plaintiffs’ contention that the City Defendants’\n\n13   allegedly discriminatory recruiting practices—word-of-mouth recruiting, and limited\n\n14   advertising—are not prohibited by Title VII even if they cause a disparate impact. Like the other\n\n15   courts that have addressed similar arguments, we are unpersuaded. As the Sixth Circuit has\n\n16   stated, the “assertion that disparate impact analysis is inapplicable to . . . recruiting practices is\n\n17   plainly incorrect. The very purpose of Title VII’s disparate impact theory is to eradicate barriers\n\n18   which discriminate on the basis of race, gender, religion, and other protected classifications.”\n\n19   United States v. City of Warren, 138 F.3d 1083, 1094 (6th Cir. 1998) (quotations, modifications,\n\n20   and footnote omitted); see also Thomas v. Wash. Cnty. Sch. Bd., 915 F.2d 922, 924-26 (4th Cir.\n\n21   1990) (a school board violated Title VII through a combination of nepotism, word-of-mouth\n\n22   recruiting, and “the general practice of posting notice of vacancies only in the schools,” where\n\n\n                                                       104\n\f 1   minorities were unlikely to see them); United States v. Ga. Power Co., 474 F.2d 906, 925 (5th\n\n 2   Cir. 1973) (“Word-of-mouth hiring and interviewing for recruitment only at particular scholastic\n\n 3   institutions are practices that are neutral on their face. However, under the facts of the instant\n\n 4   case, each operates as a ‘built-in-headwind’ to blacks . . . .”). In addition, this court, many years\n\n 5   ago, concluded that a prima facie case of disparate impact existed based on “subjective word-of-\n\n 6   mouth hiring methods.” See Grant v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., 635 F.2d 1007, 1016 (2d Cir.\n\n 7   1980).\n\n 8            The Brennan Plaintiffs do not deny that recruitment practices qualify as employment\n\n 9   practices. Their argument is, essentially, that § 703(a)(2), which makes it illegal for an employer\n\n10   “to limit, segregate, or classify his employees or applicants for employment in any way which\n\n11   would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities,” does not refer to\n\n12   recruiting, because people who don’t even apply for a job because of recruiting discrimination\n\n13   are not “applicants for employment.” But, as the Government says, the Supreme Court has all\n\n14   but held that “applicants” includes potential applicants in the § 703(a)(2) disparate-impact\n\n15   context. See Wards Cove, 490 U.S. at 651 & n.7 (suggesting that a prima facie case of disparate\n\n16   impact would be made out “if it were found that [a] dearth of qualified nonwhite applicants was\n\n17   due to practices on [an employer’s] part which—expressly or implicitly—deterred minority\n\n18   group members from applying for . . . positions.”); see also Dothard v. Rawlinson, 433 U.S. 321,\n\n19   330 (1977).61 Accordingly, we make explicit what may have only been implicit in our decision\n\n\n     61\n       Cases discussing remedies under § 706(g) of Title VII, while not directly on point, follow\n     similar reasoning. See Teamsters, 431 U.S. at 365 (“If an employer should announce his policy\n     of discrimination by a sign reading ‘Whites Only’ on the hiring-office door, his victims would\n     not be limited to the few who ignored the sign and subjected themselves to personal rebuffs. The\n     same message can be communicated to potential applicants more subtly but just as clearly by an\n\n                                                      105\n\f1    in Grant and hold that potential applicants for employment are “applicants for employment” for\n\n2    § 703(a)(2) purposes.62\n\n3           B.      Job-Related and Less Discriminatory Alternative\n\n 4          The next component of the Ricci strong-basis-in-evidence standard requires that the\n\n 5   employer show, for each disputed employment practice, a strong basis in evidence either that\n\n 6   the practice was not job-related or that there was a less discriminatory alternative to that\n\n 7   practice. See Ricci, 129 S. Ct. at 2678. The district court considered evidence concerning\n\n 8   job-relatedness and less discriminatory alternatives neither for the challenged exams, nor for\n\n 9   the recruiting practices. See NYC Board III, 448 F. Supp. 2d at 426 n.37. On remand, the\n\n10   district court should determine whether the City Defendants had a strong basis in evidence\n\n\n\n     employer's actual practices—by his consistent discriminatory treatment of actual applicants, by\n     the manner in which he publicizes vacancies, his recruitment techniques, his responses to casual\n     or tentative inquiries, and even by the racial or ethnic composition of that part of his work force\n     from which he has discriminatorily excluded members of minority groups.” (emphasis added));\n     Berkman v. City of New York, 705 F.2d 584, 594 (2d Cir. 1983) (“Those who have been deterred\n     by a discriminatory practice from applying for employment are as much victims of\n     discrimination as are actual applicants whom the practice has caused to be rejected.”).\n     62\n        The Brennan Plaintiffs also make several other arguments seeking to distinguish recruitment\n     from hiring discrimination. All these can be dismissed summarily. For example, they assert that\n     interpreting § 703(a)(2) to cover recruiting discrimination renders § 704(b) surplusage. This\n     argument, too, is meritless. Section 704(b) prohibits employers from publishing “any notice or\n     advertisement relating to employment by such an employer . . . indicating any preference,\n     limitation, specification, or discrimination, based on race, color, religion, sex, or national\n     origin.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(b). But, as the Government points out, § 704(b) deals with facially\n     discriminatory notices, while disparate impact is about facially neutral practices.\n        The Brennan Plaintiffs additionally contend that employers cannot be held liable for failure to\n     do something, as against doing something. This is another distinction without a difference.\n     Although better advertising, or additional word-of-mouth recruiting targeted at minorities and\n     women, might cure a racial and gender disparity among job applicants, the problematic\n     employment practice is really the combination of what the employer is doing (telling white\n     males about the job opportunity) and what the employer is not doing (not telling others).\n     Besides, any employment practice can be described in a positive or negative way. For example,\n     the high-school diploma requirement in Griggs could be described as “hiring only individuals\n\n                                                     106\n\f1   that each of the three challenged exams was not job-related or had a less discriminatory\n\n2   alternative.63 See supra Part V.A.1. Whether the district court needs to make such a\n\n\n\n    with high-school diplomas” or as “failing to consider applicants without high-school diplomas.”\n    63\n       We note that two of the three disputed exams—and, therefore, the limited advertising and\n    word-of-mouth recruiting for those two exams—occurred before the effective date of the Civil\n    Rights Act of 1991, Pub. L. No. 102-166, 106 Stat. 1071. The Supreme Court has held that an\n    unrelated section of that Act does not have retroactive effect, but the Court stated that “courts\n    should evaluate each provision of the Act in light of ordinary judicial principles concerning the\n    application of new rules to . . . preenactment conduct.” Landgraf v. USI Film Prods., 511 U.S.\n    244, 280 (1994). To the extent that the portion of Section 105 of the 1991 Act, which\n    superseded Wards Cove and reassigned the burden of persuasion on job-relatedness to the\n    defendant, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)(1)(A)(i), is not retroactive, the pre-1991 employment\n    practices may be subject to Wards Cove. Under Wards Cove, while “the employer carries the\n    burden of producing evidence of a business justification for his employment practice[,] [t]he\n    burden of persuasion . . . remains with the disparate-impact plaintiff.” 490 U.S. at 659. (At least\n    one of our sister Circuits has held that § 2000e-2(k)(1)(A) is not retroactive. See Davey v. City\n    of Omaha, 107 F.3d 587, 591-93 (8th Cir. 1997)). Similarly, if the same section of the 1991 Act\n    changed the substantive job-relatedness standard of Wards Cove, see Lanning v. Se. Pa. Transp.\n    Auth. (SEPTA), 181 F.3d 478, 485-94 (3d Cir. 1999) (holding that after the 1991 Act the\n    business necessity doctrine asks whether a requirement is “necessary to perform the job in\n    question,” not, as in Wards Cove, “whether a challenged practice serves, in a significant way, the\n    legitimate employment goals of the employer” (quoting Wards Cove, 490 U.S. at 659)), then the\n    job-relatedness standard applicable to the two pre-1991 exams also depends on whether that\n    section of the Act is retroactive. In addition, the form of the less-discriminatory-alternative\n    analysis for the two pre-1991 exams and the associated recruiting practices also turns on the\n    retroactivity of Section 105. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)(1)(C) (stating that a disparate-impact\n    plaintiff’s demonstration of a less discriminatory alternative “shall be in accordance with the law\n    as it existed on June 4, 1989”—the day before Wards Cove came down—“with respect to the\n    concept of ‘alternative employment practice’”).\n             Moreover, under Ricci, the district court might be required to consider the effect of any\n    legal, rather than factual, uncertainty with respect to the retroactive application of the 1991\n    amendments. If, that is, an employer takes a race- or sex-conscious action because of a strong\n    basis in evidence that it will be liable for disparate impact under an interpretation of the\n    disparate-impact provisions of Title VII that later is held to be erroneous, must the employer then\n    be liable for disparate treatment? If not, then how strongly supported must the erroneous legal\n    conclusion have been at the time of the employer’s race- or sex-conscious action, in order for the\n    employer to avoid liability? Cf. Jerman v. Carlisle, McNellie, Rini, Kramer & Ulrich LPA, 130\n    S. Ct. 1605, 1612 (2010) (“[W]hen Congress has intended to provide a mistake-of-law defense to\n    civil liability, it has often done so more explicitly than here.”). Because the district court may\n    well find that a strong basis in evidence of job-relatedness or of a less discriminatory alternative\n    exists (or does not exist) for the relevant practices regardless of whether the court uses the pre-\n\n                                                    107\n\f 1   determination with respect to the two challenged recruiting practices depends on whether the\n\n 2   recruiting defense survives the initial, prima facie case/strong-basis-in-evidence of prima\n\n 3   facie case, step of the Ricci inquiry.\n\n 4          C.      Necessity and Make-Whole Relief\n\n 5          Next, the district court must determine whether the City Defendants had a strong basis\n\n 6   in evidence that their race- and gender-conscious actions were necessary to avoid disparate-\n\n 7   impact liability. See Ricci, 129 S. Ct. at 2677; supra Part V.A.2. As we have explained, that\n\n 8   means the City Defendants must have had, at the time they took their race- and gender-\n\n 9   conscious actions, a strong basis in evidence that each Offeree was an actual victim of\n\n10   discrimination who received no more than make-whole relief, i.e., a strong basis in evidence\n\n11   that, in such a disparate impact suit, he or she would have been entitled to receive, by a court\n\n12   order pursuant to § 706(g) of Title VII, the race- or sex-conscious relief that he or she\n\n13   received from the City Defendants through the voluntary settlement agreement.\n\n14          The district court’s decision as to job-relatedness and less discriminatory alternatives\n\n15   will affect this step in several important ways. First, if there was no strong basis in evidence\n\n16   that any of the challenged testing and recruiting practices were either not job-related or that\n\n17   there was a less discriminatory alternative to them, then the district court need not make any\n\n18   determinations as to particular Offerees.64 The Brennan Plaintiffs would then have\n\n\n\n     1991 or post-1991 standard, we deem it inappropriate at this time to address further these\n     difficult retroactivity questions.\n     64\n        As we noted in the previous section, see supra Part VI.B, the district court would not need to\n     reach the issue of whether the City Defendants had a strong basis in evidence that the challenged\n     recruitment practices were not job-related or had less discriminatory alternatives, if it were to\n     conclude that the recruiting claims do not satisfy Ricci’s requirement of a prima facie case/strong\n     basis in evidence of a prima facie case. See supra Part V.A.1. Such a finding, of course, would\n\n                                                     108\n\f 1   successfully shown that implementation of the settlement agreement as a whole made the City\n\n 2   Defendants liable for reverse discrimination, under § 703(a) of Title VII. That is so because\n\n 3   an employer cannot have a strong basis in evidence that anyone is a victim of discrimination if\n\n 4   there is no strong basis in evidence that discrimination has occurred.\n\n 5          Second, and for the same reason, if the City Defendants can show a strong basis in\n\n 6   evidence of non-job-relatedness or of a less discriminatory alternative as to one or more of the\n\n 7   challenged employment practices, but not as to others, then the City Defendants have violated\n\n 8   § 703(a) to the extent they have given relief to Offerees for whom there was no strong basis in\n\n 9   evidence that such Offerees were victims of the practice or practices for which there was a\n\n10   strong basis in evidence of non-job-relatedness or of a less discriminatory alternative. For\n\n11   example, if the City Defendants had a strong basis in evidence that their tests were not job-\n\n12   related, but they lacked a strong basis in evidence that their recruiting practices were neither\n\n13   job-related nor that there existed a less discriminatory alternative to these recruiting practices\n\n14   (or could not make out a prima facie/strong-basis-in-evidence of a prima facie showing of\n\n15   recruiting discrimination), then the City Defendants would, for each Offeree, have to show a\n\n16   strong basis in evidence that that Offeree was a victim of testing discrimination. Essentially,\n\n17   the City Defendants would be required to show a strong basis in evidence that the Offeree\n\n18   took the test, or that the Offeree could successfully have “undertake[n] [his or her] difficult\n\n19   task of proving that [he or she] should be treated as [an] applicant[] and therefore [is]\n\n\n\n\n     also foreclose the need to conduct individualized “necessity” determinations with respect to the\n     alleged victims of recruiting discrimination.\n\n                                                      109\n\f 1   presumptively entitled to relief accordingly” under § 706(g). See Teamsters, 431 U.S. at\n\n 2   364.65\n\n 3            Third, if the district court does find a strong basis in evidence of disparate-impact\n\n 4   liability, the appropriate extent of relief the City Defendants could have given each Offeree\n\n 5   without violating § 703(a) turns on which theory—non-job-relatedness or a less\n\n 6   discriminatory alternative—supports the district court’s determination. If the Government\n\n 7   successfully shows on remand, as it hopes to, that there was a strong basis in evidence that the\n\n 8   provisional hiring process was a less discriminatory alternative to a particular hiring practice,\n\n 9   then it follows that any Offeree, as to whom there is a strong basis in evidence that the\n\n10   Offeree was a victim of that particular discriminatory practice, properly received retroactive\n\n11   seniority to his or her provisional hiring date. For if an Offeree was hired under the\n\n12   provisional hiring process and that process was a less discriminatory alternative, then there is\n\n13   a strong basis in evidence that that Offeree would have received a permanent appointment if\n\n14   the City Defendants had used the less discriminatory alternative instead.\n\n15            Alternatively, if there was a strong basis in evidence that an employment practice that\n\n16   had a disparate impact discriminated only because it was not job-related, it becomes much\n\n\n     65\n        As the Supreme Court has explained in the § 706(g) context: “A nonapplicant must show that\n     he was a potential victim of unlawful discrimination. Because he is necessarily claiming that he\n     was deterred from applying for the job by the employer’s discriminatory practices, his is the not\n     always easy burden of proving that he would have applied for the job had it not been for those\n     practices.” Teamsters, 431 U.S. at 367-68. For that reason, if there were a strong basis in\n     evidence of testing-discrimination liability but not of recruiting-discrimination liability, then the\n     City Defendants could show the required strong basis in evidence as to an individual who did not\n     take a challenged test if it proffered evidence that the individual would have taken the test if only\n     she had not been dissuaded by either (1) the racial or gender disparities in the results of previous\n     tests, or (2) a racial or gender imbalance in the underlying workforce that is the result of one or\n     more of the challenged tests.\n\n                                                      110\n\f 1   more difficult for the district court to determine how much retroactive seniority the City\n\n 2   Defendants could properly give each Offeree without violating § 703(a). Suppose, for\n\n 3   example, that the challenged tests were discriminatory; it is nigh-impossible to tell exactly\n\n 4   when (if at all) an Offeree would have been hired if the test had not been discriminatory. In\n\n 5   that hypothetical world, some Offerees might have passed with flying colors and would then\n\n 6   have been the first to be hired from the eligibility lists; others might have found themselves in\n\n 7   the middle of the eligibility lists; and still others might still have failed, or might have passed\n\n 8   with such a low score that they would have been placed near the bottom of the eligibility lists,\n\n 9   where they probably would never have been hired. And, those who passed a test might have\n\n10   been rejected at the interview stage (which is not here being challenged as discriminatory),\n\n11   once or twice, thus having their employment delayed; or three times, resulting in removal\n\n12   from the eligibility list. Finally, they might have failed the “experience papers” stage, and\n\n13   then they might or might not have succeeded in having that decision overturned on\n\n14   administrative appeal. To say the least, “[t]he task remaining for the District Court on remand\n\n15   will not be a simple one.” Teamsters, 431 U.S. at 371. “Th[e] process of recreating the past\n\n16   will necessarily involve a degree of approximation and imprecision.” Id. at 372.\n\n17          Recreating the past is difficult in the § 706(g) context addressed in Teamsters. It is\n\n18   even more difficult when an employer undertakes voluntary remedial action that is challenged\n\n19   under Ricci and § 703(a). In the § 706(g) context, a court necessarily has already found an\n\n20   actual violation of Title VII. See id. at 361-62. All the court has then to do is to determine\n\n21   who is an actual victim of that discrimination, and “‘recreate the conditions and relationships\n\n22   that would have been had there been no’ unlawful discrimination,” id. at 372 (quoting Franks,\n\n\n                                                      111\n\f 1   424 U.S. at 769). That process is not easy, because there may be more victims of\n\n 2   discrimination than there are vacancies that were discriminatorily refused to them, and their\n\n 3   interests must be balanced against “the legitimate expectations of other employees innocent of\n\n 4   any wrongdoing.” Id. But when an employer undertakes voluntary action to remedy an\n\n 5   unintentional disparate impact, the employer has not proven, and does not need to prove, that\n\n 6   it has actually violated Title VII. Ricci, 129 S. Ct. at 2674. Instead, the employer must have a\n\n 7   strong basis in evidence that it would be liable in a disparate-impact suit unless it took the\n\n 8   race- or gender-conscious action. See id. at 2675-76. Once an employer has a strong basis in\n\n 9   evidence that it faces disparate-impact liability, the employer must also undertake a recreation\n\n10   of the past that is supported by a strong basis in evidence. Where, as here, incumbent\n\n11   employees subsequently bring a § 703(a) challenge to the employer’s race- or gender-\n\n12   conscious action, the court must determine whether there really was a strong basis in evidence\n\n13   to support the employer’s recreation of the past.66 That is a very difficult project indeed. It is\n\n14   one that only a district court can undertake, and whose difficulty should serve to caution any\n\n15   appellate court attempting to review the district court’s conclusions.\n\n16                                                ****\n\n17          The district court, deciding this case before Ricci, asked whether each Offeree was an\n\n18   actual victim, instead of whether the City Defendants had a strong basis in evidence that each\n\n\n     66\n        Moreover, if the district court finds that the employer’s recreation of the past is not supported\n     by a strong basis in evidence, then the employer is liable to the incumbent employees under §\n     703(a), and the court must impose a remedy under § 706(g), i.e., it must perform yet another\n     recreation of the past, this time directly governed by Teamsters, in which the court must recreate\n     the conditions and relationships that would have existed if the employer had not violated §\n     703(a) against the incumbent employee plaintiffs. And in doing so the court must balance the\n     interests of those incumbent employee plaintiffs against those of the innocent beneficiaries of the\n\n                                                     112\n\f 1   Offeree was an actual victim. As a result, we must vacate the judgment and remand so that\n\n 2   the district court can apply the correct standard. In addition, several of the district court’s\n\n 3   findings require comment.\n\n 4           First, as discussed above, the district court did not make any individualized\n\n 5   determinations as to alleged victims of recruiting discrimination, because it concluded that\n\n 6   there was no prima facie case of recruiting discrimination. Because we have remanded on the\n\n 7   question of whether, under Ricci, there was a prima facie case/strong-basis-in-evidence of a\n\n 8   prima facie case of recruiting discrimination, individualized determinations pertaining to\n\n 9   recruiting-discrimination victimhood will be required to the extent that the district court finds\n\n10   (a) that the recruiting defense survives Ricci’s prima facie case/strong-basis-in-evidence of\n\n11   prima facie case requirement; and (b) that there was a strong basis in evidence that the\n\n12   challenged recruiting practices either were not job-related or had a less discriminatory\n\n13   alternative.\n\n14           Second, the district court twice said that the Brennan Plaintiffs “acknowledge that\n\n15   seven of the [Offerees] were victims of discrimination under the testing claims and received\n\n16   appropriate make-whole relief: Lloyd Bailey, Joseph Christie, Belfield Lashley, Gilbert\n\n17   Rivera, Peter Robertin, Felix Torres and Mayra Zephrini (Cintron).” NYC Board III, 448 F.\n\n18   Supp. 2d at 419; see also NYC Board V, 556 F. Supp. 2d at 208. The Brennan Plaintiffs state,\n\n19   and the Government agrees, that no such concession was made. The district court did not\n\n20   provide a citation to the record to support its assertion, either in 2006 or in 2008. On remand,\n\n\n\n\n     race-conscious action that was deemed unlawful under Ricci. See infra Part IX.\n\n                                                      113\n\f 1   the district court should either explain the basis for its assertion, deem the matter forfeited, or\n\n 2   make individualized strong-basis determinations for each of these individuals.67\n\n 3          Third, the district court did not address whether the ten Arroyo Intervenors were\n\n 4   victims of testing discrimination. The district court had held, as to them and other alleged\n\n 5   victims of testing discrimination, that retroactive seniority was limited to actual victims for\n\n 6   layoff purposes only. The parties then resolved the Arroyo Intervenors’ layoff seniority dates\n\n 7   by stipulation. That stipulation, however, provides that “[s]hould a higher court conclude that\n\n 8   ‘actual victim’ status is relevant to the lawfulness of any of the seniority benefits that these\n\n 9   beneficiaries received under the Agreement for the purpose of obtaining transfers or\n\n10   temporary care assignments, each shall have the right to a hearing on ‘actual victim’ status in\n\n11   [the district court] on remand.” Additionally, “[i]n the event of any remand by a higher court\n\n\n     67\n        It would have been better if the parties had pointed this issue out to the district court in one of\n     the several motions for reconsideration they filed after the district court first made the assertion\n     in its 2006 opinion in NYC Board III. If a district court appears unintentionally to have misstated\n     the record, there is no reason to wait until appeal to have the issue corrected. That is especially\n     so because the district court knows, far better than we, whether it had any basis in the record for\n     its assertion. The district court in this case understandably wanted to get to final judgment as\n     quickly as possible, but we remind the parties that any unintentional factual misstatements left\n     uncorrected may well result in more delay than would have occurred if the district court were\n     given an opportunity to correct itself in the first place. Indeed, the parties arguably forfeited any\n     appeal of the district court’s alleged factual misstatement by failing to raise a reconsideration\n     motion. See Smith ex rel. Smith v. Half Hollow Hills Cent. Sch. Dist., 298 F.3d 168, 173 n.3 (2d\n     Cir. 2002). Compare Conley v. Bd. of Trs. of Grenada Cnty. Hosp., 707 F.2d 175, 178-79 (5th\n     Cir. 1983) (“As a general principle of appellate review, we refuse to consider issues not raised\n     below. This refusal is particularly appropriate when, as here, a party requests the trial court to\n     reconsider the judgment but conspicuously omits a contention of procedural irregularity that the\n     court could have corrected immediately.” (citation omitted)), with Walker v. Abbott Labs., 340\n     F.3d 471, 475 (7th Cir. 2003) (“There is simply no rule or case law that requires litigants to\n     move for reconsideration of an interlocutory ruling in order to avoid waiving a challenge to that\n     ruling on appeal of a final decision.”). Nevertheless, since this kind of forfeiture is not\n     jurisdictional, see, e.g., Dean v. Blumenthal, 577 F.3d 60, 67 n.6 (2d Cir. 2009), and since\n     remand to the district court is required in any event, we leave the matter in its able hands.\n\n                                                      114\n\f 1   for a purpose that is related to the lawfulness of the seniority benefits received by the [Arroyo\n\n 2   Intervenors], these stipulated dates shall no longer apply.” Because we have concluded that\n\n 3   the retroactive transfer and TCA seniority given to the Arroyo Intervenors, like that given to\n\n 4   the other Offerees, violates § 703(a) of Title VII to the extent it is not supported by a strong\n\n 5   basis in evidence that each individual was an actual victim of discrimination, the stipulation\n\n 6   no longer applies on remand.68 As a result, subject of course to any possible new stipulation,\n\n 7   the district court, on remand, will have to address whether the City Defendants had a strong\n\n 8   basis in evidence that the Arroyo Intervenors were actual victims of discrimination who\n\n 9   received no more than make-whole relief when the City Defendants implemented the\n\n10   settlement agreement.\n\n11          Fourth, the district court did make actual-victim status determinations for the\n\n12   remaining eight Offerees: Ricardo Cordero, Thomas Fields, Carla Lambert, Vernon Marshall,\n\n13   Angel Pagan, Anthony Pantelides, Sean Rivera, and Luis Torres. The district court found that\n\n14   (1) Cordero and Marshall, each of whom failed an exam, were actual victims and the\n\n15   retroactive seniority they received was lawful, NYC Board V, 556 F. Supp. 2d at 209-10; (2)\n\n16   Sean Rivera, who was, against the odds, hired after years of delay because his barely passing\n\n17   score put him at the very bottom of the eligibility list where it was unlikely he would ever be\n\n18   hired, was not an actual victim because his “hypothetical performance [on a\n\n19   nondiscriminatory exam] is purely speculative,” as is “what such a score would have yielded\n\n20   in terms of his hire date,” id. at 210; and (3) the other five Offerees would not have been hired\n\n\n     68\n        The Brennan Plaintiffs argue that one Offeree, Andrew Clement, was inappropriately stricken\n     from this stipulation. Because the stipulation will no longer apply, we need not address that\n     contention.\n\n                                                      115\n\f 1   even under a nondiscriminatory exam because they were not qualified, id. at 210-11. We\n\n 2   vacate this portion of the judgment because the district court should have asked whether the\n\n 3   City Defendants had a strong basis in evidence that these individuals were victims, not\n\n 4   whether the individuals actually were victims.69\n\n 5          We note, moreover, that some of the district court’s findings in this portion of its\n\n 6   judgment are problematic in two other ways. There is a tension between the finding that\n\n 7   Rivera’s hypothetical performance on a nondiscriminatory exam was speculative, while\n\n 8   Cordero’s and Marshall’s were not. Anyone who received a lower score than he or she would\n\n 9   have received on a nondiscriminatory test is a likely victim of discrimination, whether the\n\n10   lower score resulted in outright failure or, instead, delay in being hired. See, e.g., Guardians\n\n11   Ass’n v. Civil Serv. Comm’n, 633 F.2d 232, 248 n.30 (2d Cir. 1980) (“There is no reason why\n\n12   the acceptance of a belated offer of employment should be deemed a waiver of the right to\n\n13   seek redress for a discriminatory delay.”).\n\n14          In addition, the district court erred in a somewhat more subtle way in allocating the\n\n15   burden of proof. The district court cited Johnson v. California, 543 U.S. 499, 505 (2005), an\n\n16   Equal Protection case, for the proposition that “the parties to the [Settlement] Agreement—\n\n17   i.e., the United States and the Board—bear the burden of proof” as to the actual-victim status\n\n18   of each Offeree. NYC Board V, 556 F. Supp. 2d at 209. Although under Ricci the § 703(a)\n\n\n     69\n        It is possible to imagine a scenario in which, at the time of the settlement’s implementation,\n     the City Defendants lacked a strong basis in evidence that a particular Offeree was a victim of\n     discrimination, but at present the Offeree is able to show that she was in fact a victim of\n     discrimination. In that situation, for the reasons discussed in Part V.A.1, supra, the City\n     Defendants would remain liable under § 703(a), as an employer’s satisfaction of the Ricci\n     strong-basis-in-evidence test is measured at the time of the employer’s race- or gender-conscious\n     action. But it would likely be inappropriate for a district court to impose a remedy stripping an\n\n                                                     116\n\f 1   reverse-discrimination defendant bears the burden at trial of showing a strong basis in\n\n 2   evidence that its race- or gender-conscious actions were necessary to avoid disparate-impact\n\n 3   liability, see 129 S. Ct. at 2664 (“[R]ace-based action like the City’s in this case is\n\n 4   impermissible under Title VII unless the employer can demonstrate a strong basis in evidence\n\n 5   that, had it not taken the action, it would have been liable under the disparate-impact\n\n 6   statute.”), it is also true, as the Government points out, that if the Government had pursued its\n\n 7   disparate-impact claims to judgment and the district court had imposed a remedy under §\n\n 8   706(g), then the case governing the burden of proof would have been Teamsters, not Johnson\n\n 9   v. California. Under Teamsters, as this Court has interpreted it,\n\n10          [e]ach class member must show that he or she was among those adversely affected\n11          by the challenged policy or practice. If this showing is made, the class member is\n12          entitled to individual relief unless the employer in turn can establish by a\n13          preponderance of the evidence that a legitimate non-discriminatory reason existed for\n14          the particular adverse action.\n15\n16   Robinson, 267 F.3d at 161-62.70 Viewing Teamsters through the strong-basis-in-evidence\n\n17   lens of Ricci, an employer, before it takes a race- or gender-conscious action to avoid or\n\n18   remedy a disparate-impact violation, must have a strong basis in evidence that (1) each\n\n19   beneficiary of the race- or gender-conscious action could “show that he or she was among\n\n20   those adversely affected” by the disparate-impact practice, and (2) the employer would be\n\n\n\n\n     actual-victim Offeree of retroactive seniority that, in fact, made him or her whole.\n     70\n        The Brennan Plaintiffs argue that Teamsters only applies to disparate treatment and not to\n     disparate impact. That position is contrary to our precedents. Teamsters itself was a disparate-\n     treatment case, but we have held that in disparate-impact cases cases “an inquiry similar to the\n     remedial stage of a pattern-or-practice disparate treatment claim,” i.e., a Teamsters inquiry, “is\n     generally required.” Robinson, 267 F.3d at 161.\n\n                                                      117\n\f 1   unable to “establish by preponderance of the evidence that a legitimate non-discriminatory\n\n 2   reason existed for the particular adverse action.”71\n\n 3          Fifth, the district court’s 2006 opinion addressed the Brennan Plaintiffs’ claim that\n\n 4   five Offerees “are not members of a protected class because each lacks the requisite cultural\n\n 5   or linguistic ties to qualify as Hispanic.” NYC Board III, 448 F. Supp. 2d at 422. The district\n\n 6   court, relying on the EEOC’s definition of national-origin discrimination, see 29 C.F.R. §\n\n 7   1606.1,72 held that one Offeree, Ciro Dellaporte, was not Hispanic because he was “plainly . .\n\n 8   . of Italian ancestry.” NYC Board III, 448 F. Supp. 2d at 422. (The City Defendants, who had\n\n 9   erroneously listed him as Hispanic in their records, did not thereafter defend his appointment.)\n\n10   The other four, the district court held, were Hispanic: Kevin LaFaye’s father and the mother\n\n11   of Nicholas and Anthony Pantelides were born in Puerto Rico, and Steven Lopez’s\n\n12   grandfather was born in Mexico. Id. The Brennan Plaintiffs appeal the district court’s\n\n13   decision, but only as to the Pantelides brothers. We agree with the district court that the City\n\n14   Defendants properly treated the Pantelides brothers as Hispanic, in light of their ancestors’\n\n\n     71\n        The Government and the Brennan Plaintiffs debate at length whether several Offerees would\n     have passed the “experience papers” portion of the hiring process. All the City Defendants (and\n     the Government or any intervenors who support them on this issue) need to show is that they had\n     a strong basis in evidence that each Offeree was qualified. The City Defendants’ post hoc\n     review of applicant qualifications, performed before the 1999 settlement for the intended purpose\n     of litigating against the Government, is not dispositive of this question, although it certainly is\n     evidence that must be taken into account. Even for an Offeree who was deemed unqualified by\n     the post hoc review, the City Defendants could use other evidence to demonstrate a strong basis\n     in evidence that the Offeree was qualified. For example, the City Defendants could show that\n     similarly experienced individuals, who went through the actual “experience papers” process and\n     were initially deemed unqualified, prevailed on administrative appeal.\n     72\n        “The Commission defines national origin discrimination broadly as including, but not limited\n     to, the denial of equal employment opportunity because of an individual's, or his or her\n     ancestor's, place of origin; or because an individual has the physical, cultural or linguistic\n     characteristics of a national origin group.” 29 C.F.R. § 1606.1. This definition applies to both\n\n                                                     118\n\f 1   national origin. See Espinoza v. Farah Mfg. Co., 414 U.S. 86, 88 (1973) (“The term ‘national\n\n 2   origin’ on its face refers to the country where a person was born, or, more broadly, the country\n\n 3   from which his or her ancestors came.”). The district court therefore need not revisit this\n\n 4   issue when it applies the strong-basis-in-evidence standard on remand.\n\n 5          With these considerations in mind, we remand for the district court to take up the\n\n 6   difficult task of determining whether the “hypothetical nondiscriminatory past” that the City\n\n 7   Defendants attempted to recreate, when they implemented the settlement agreement, was\n\n 8   supported by a strong basis in evidence.73\n\n 9   VII.   Equal Protection\n\n10          The parties also ask us to review the district court’s decisions under the Equal\n\n11   Protection Clause. We think, however, that the better course is to follow one “of the cardinal\n\n12   rules governing the federal courts: . . . never to anticipate a question of constitutional law in\n\n13   advance of the necessity of deciding it.” Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc., 472 U.S. 491, 501\n\n14   (1985) (quotation marks omitted). That is especially so here because the case presents\n\n15   difficult and far-reaching issues concerning the application of the Equal Protection Clause to\n\n16   remedies for past disparate impact. We decline to decide those issues in this case until the\n\n17   district court has addressed the Title VII issues under the proper standard—i.e., Ricci rather\n\n18   than Johnson and Weber. Only if this court, upon reviewing a district court decision that has\n\n19   applied the correct Title VII standard, determines that some part of the City Defendants’\n\n20   voluntary implementation of the disputed paragraphs of the settlement agreement did not\n\n\n\n     “disparate treatment and adverse impact.” Id.\n     73\n        As already noted, the district court need not perform that task if the Brennan Plaintiffs attain\n     victory at the job-relatedness and less-discriminatory alternative stage for all the challenged\n\n                                                      119\n\f 1   violate § 703(a) of Title VII, would it be necessary or prudent for us to address the\n\n 2   constitutional issues.\n\n 3          The Supreme Court has cautioned that, although “[a] fundamental and longstanding\n\n 4   principle of judicial restraint requires that courts avoid reaching constitutional questions in\n\n 5   advance of the necessity of deciding them,” in some cases it is “inadvisable to vacate and\n\n 6   remand” for the court below to address a statutory issue where “considerations of judicial\n\n 7   economy” strongly favor addressing the constitutional issue on the merits. Lyng v. Nw. Indian\n\n 8   Cemetery Protective Ass’n, 485 U.S. 439, 445-47 (1988). The principle of judicial restraint\n\n 9   would not be “vindicated by sending [a] case on what would almost certainly be a brief round\n\n10   trip to the court[] below.” Id. at 447. Here, however, the trip to the district court will likely\n\n11   be—perhaps to the able district judge’s chagrin—anything but brief. Because the district\n\n12   court did not permit the Brennan Plaintiffs to make any showing as to job-relatedness of, or a\n\n13   less discriminatory alternative to, the challenged employment practices, a factual record will\n\n14   have to be developed. Then the district court will have to decide whether that factual record\n\n15   shows that the City Defendants had a strong basis in evidence. To the extent that the district\n\n16   court finds a strong basis in evidence that the City Defendants faced disparate-impact liability,\n\n17   the court will have to determine whether the City Defendants also had a strong basis in\n\n18   evidence that giving each Offeree retroactive seniority was necessary to remedy any\n\n19   disparate-impact Title VII violation. And then, the district court will have to impose a remedy\n\n20   for whatever reverse-discrimination § 703(a) violations it finds. See Part IX, infra.\n\n\n\n\n     employment practices.\n\n                                                      120\n\f 1           Even more important, there is at least some possibility that the constitutional issues\n\n 2   will not come back to us.74 If the district court finds that the disputed portions of the\n\n 3   settlement agreement violated § 703(a) in their entirety, i.e., the City Defendants failed to\n\n 4   satisfy the strong-basis-in-evidence standard of Ricci with respect to any of their employment\n\n 5   practices, then neither we nor the district court will need to address whether the City\n\n 6   Defendants also violated the Equal Protection Clause. In cases like this one, where our\n\n 7   addressing a constitutional issue could dispose of the case, but there is at least one non-trivial\n\n 8   non-constitutional issue which could also dispose of the case after a remand to the district\n\n 9   court, the better practice is to remand for the district court to address the latter first. See, e.g.,\n\n10   Westchester Day Sch. v. Vill. of Mamaroneck, 386 F.3d 183, 191 (2d Cir. 2004) (“Prudence\n\n11   counsels against reaching out to establish a far-reaching constitutional rule when there are\n\n12   many other bases upon which this case may ultimately be decided.”).\n\n13           Moreover, the prudential principle of avoiding unnecessary constitutional adjudication\n\n14   “has been strictly followed where, as in the present case, difficult or far-reaching\n\n15   constitutional issues are raised.” Fed. Election Comm’n v. Cent. Long Island Tax Reform\n\n16   Immediately Comm., 616 F.2d 45, 52 (2d Cir. 1980) (en banc) (per curiam). There are at least\n\n17   two such issues in the case before us. First, the parties call upon us to decide a question the\n\n18   Supreme Court explicitly left open in Ricci: whether “meeting the [Title VII] strong-basis-in-\n\n19   evidence standard would satisfy the Equal Protection Clause in a future case.” 129 S. Ct. at\n\n20   2676. Second, the Brennan Plaintiffs argue here, as they did below, that no showing of\n\n\n     74\n       We emphasize that we do not intend to suggest that the district court ought to reach any\n     particular result on remand. Indeed, such a suggestion would clearly be premature in light of the\n     undeveloped factual record on the relevant issues.\n\n                                                        121\n\f 1   previous unintentional disparate impact can ever satisfy the Equal Protection Clause. Rather,\n\n2    they say, only remedying pervasive and egregious intentional disparate treatment is a\n\n3    “compelling interest” for purposes of strict scrutiny75 (or an “important interest” for purposes\n\n 4   of heightened scrutiny).76 See Ricci, 129 S. Ct. at 2682 (Scalia, J., concurring). These issues\n\n 5   are manifestly “difficult” and “far-reaching.” See Richard Primus, The Future of Disparate\n\n 6   Impact, 108 Mich. L. Rev. 1341 (2010); Richard Primus, Equal Protection and Disparate\n\n 7   Impact: Round Three, 117 Harv. L. Rev. 493 (2003).\n\n 8          We, therefore, decline at this time to address the parties’ contentions under the Equal\n\n 9   Protection Clause.\n\n10   VIII. Class Certification\n\n11          The Caldero Intervenors argue that the district court should not have certified the\n\n12   Brennan class. They contend that the district court abused its discretion in certifying, and\n\n13   violated due process, by failing to give any party other than the Brennan Plaintiffs an opportunity\n\n14   to brief the issue of class certification. We are not persuaded.\n\n15          We review class-certification decisions for abuse of discretion. E.g., Robinson, 267 F.3d\n\n16   at 162. Here, when the district court originally certified the class, it acknowledged that the\n\n17   Brennan Plaintiffs were the only party who had had a chance to submit a brief on the issue of\n\n\n     75\n        “It is well established that when the government distributes burdens or benefits on the basis of\n     individual racial classifications, that action is reviewed under strict scrutiny.” Parents Involved\n     in Cmty. Schs. v. Seattle Sch. Dist. No. 1, 551 U.S. 701, 720 (2007). Strict scrutiny requires that\n     the government show that its race-conscious actions are “‘narrowly tailored’ to achieve a\n     ‘compelling’ government interest.” Id.\n     76\n        Government “classifications that distinguish between males and females are subject to\n     heightened scrutiny.” Nev. Dep’t of Human Res. v. Hibbs, 538 U.S. 721, 728 (2003). “For a\n     gender-based classification to withstand such scrutiny, it must serve important governmental\n     objectives, and the discriminatory means employed must be substantially related to the\n\n                                                     122\n\f 1   class certification. NYC Board III, 448 F. Supp. 2d at 444. We agree that it might have been\n\n 2   better had the district court waited for full briefing of the issue instead of deciding it in 2006.\n\n 3   But the Caldero Intervenors failed to make any Rule 23 argument in their opening brief to us.\n\n 4   Their reply brief suggests some Rule 23 issues they would have raised below if they had had an\n\n 5   opportunity. To the extent these purport to be Rule 23 arguments against certification, they are\n\n 6   not in the opening brief and are therefore forfeited. See, e.g., Poupore v. Astrue, 566 F.3d 303,\n\n 7   306 (2d Cir. 2009).77 Although the opening brief does note that “a Title VII class action, like\n\n 8   any other class action, may only be certified if the trial court is satisfied, after a rigorous\n\n 9   analysis, that the prerequisites of Rule 23(a) have been satisfied,” Gen. Tel. Co. of Sw. v. Falcon,\n\n10   457 U.S. 147, 161 (1982), there is no argument that the actual analysis in the district court’s\n\n11   opinion was not rigorous. Nor can we say, in the absence of specific arguments, that the lack of\n\n12   briefs by the Caldero Intervenors rendered the court’s certification decision not “rigorous.”\n\n13           The Caldero Intervenors’ due process claim is also unavailing, for it is too conclusory to\n\n14   avoid forfeiture on appeal. Their opening brief states only that there was a due process violation\n\n15   and cites Nelson v. Adams USA, Inc., 529 U.S. 460, 465 (2000). That is not sufficient to raise\n\n16   the issue on appeal. See Norton v. Sam’s Club, 145 F.3d 114, 117 (2d Cir. 1998) (“[W]e have\n\n17   concluded that merely . . . stating an issue without advancing an argument . . . [does] not\n\n18   suffice.”).78\n\n\n\n     achievement of those objectives.” Id. (quotation marks omitted).\n     77\n        It is true that “although we normally will not consider issues raised only in reply briefs, we\n     will consider arguments raised in response to arguments made in [an] appellee’s brief.” United\n     States v. Bari, 599 F.3d 176, 180 n.6 (2d Cir. 2010) (per curiam) (citation omitted). But here, to\n     the extent that the Caldero Intervenors can be read to raise Rule 23 arguments, those arguments\n     do not respond to anything in the Brennan Plaintiffs’ brief.\n     78\n        Nothing in our mandate prohibits the district court from exercising on remand its authority to\n\n                                                       123\n\f 1   IX.      Remedies\n\n 2            If a violation of § 703(a) or the Equal Protection Clause is found, the district court will\n\n 3   have to decide upon a remedy. Here, the Brennan Plaintiffs attack the remedy imposed by the\n\n 4   court below as too narrow, while the Government and the Caldero Intervenors attack it as too\n\n 5   broad.\n\n 6            The district court, having found violations of both Title VII and the Equal Protection\n\n 7   Clause, did not award any damages to the Brennan Plaintiffs, nor did it issue an injunction.\n\n 8   Instead, the court issued the following declaratory judgment:\n\n 9               1. As a remedy for testing discrimination, the awards of retroactive seniority to black\n10                  and Hispanic Offerees for purposes of layoff protection violate[] Title VII and the\n11                  Fourteenth Amendment, except insofar as the awards provide make-whole relief\n12                  to actual victims of testing discrimination.\n13               2. As a remedy for recruiting discrimination, the awards of retroactive seniority to\n14                  female Offerees for purposes of layoff protection violate[] Title VII.\n15               3. As a remedy for recruiting discrimination, the awards of seniority—both\n16                  retroactive and based on permanent-appointment date—to black, Hispanic and\n17                  Asian male Offerrees [sic] for purposes of transfers, TCAs and layoff protection\n18                  violate[] the Fourteenth Amendment.\n19               4. Ciro Dellaporte is not a member of a protected class and, therefore, not entitled to\n20                  any relief.\n21               5. Except as stated above, the relief provided by the Agreement comports with Title\n22                  VII and the Fourteenth Amendment.\n23\n24   Attached to the judgment were two schedules listing the “proper” competitive seniority dates\n\n25   for the Offerees.\n\n26            We do not decide the proper scope of the remedy here. We review a Title VII\n\n27   remedial order issued under § 706(g) for abuse of discretion. “Our function is not to exercise\n\n28   our own discretion, but to determine, in light of the purposes of the Act, whether the district\n\n\n\n     modify or decertify the class, nor are the Caldero Intervenors or any other parties prohibited\n     from asking the district court to exercise that authority. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(1)(C); 7AA\n\n                                                       124\n\f 1   court judge has abused his.” Ass’n Against Discrimination in Employment, Inc. v. City of\n\n 2   Bridgeport, 647 F.2d 256, 279 (2d Cir. 1981). Similarly, “federal courts have leeway to\n\n 3   fashion appropriate relief, and appellate tribunals have accorded district courts broad\n\n 4   discretion to frame equitable remedies for constitutional violations so long as the relief\n\n 5   granted is commensurate with the constitutional infraction.” Cooper v. U.S. Postal Serv., 577\n\n 6   F.3d 479, 496 (2d Cir. 2009) (quotation marks and brackets omitted). And, since the scope of\n\n 7   the City Defendants’ liability is yet to be determined, it would be premature for us to say\n\n 8   exactly what the scope of the district court’s equitable discretion might be.79 As for the\n\n 9   Brennan Plaintiffs’ damage claims, those too depend on the district court’s determination of\n\n10   the scope of liability. The damage claims are premised on specific Brennan Plaintiffs’ having\n\n11   lost transfers to specific Offerees. That is why the district court dismissed those claims; it had\n\n12   held that “[t]he transfers at issue . . . comported with Title VII and the Fourteenth\n\n13   Amendment.” Before any damage award would be appropriate, the district court must first\n\n14   determine, under the standards we have set forth in this opinion, whether the City Defendants\n\n15   violated the law when they gave the transfers to those particular Offerees.80\n\n\n\n     Wright, Miller, & Kane, Federal Practice & Procedure § 1785.4 (3d ed. 2005).\n     79\n        As the Brennan Plaintiffs note, the question of an equitable remedy for reverse discrimination\n     relating to certain types of retroactive seniority given to certain Offerees may be moot. For\n     example, any Offeree who has been “broadbanded”—that is, elevated from Custodian to CE\n     without an exam under the relatively recent change in the City Defendants’ rules that permits\n     such promotions—appears to lose his or her transfer and TCA seniority upon promotion. There\n     would be no need to impose a remedy modifying such an Offeree’s transfer or TCA seniority\n     date. Additionally, as this litigation drags on, some individuals may cease to be employed by the\n     City Defendants, rendering any adjustments to their seniority dates moot as well. We do not\n     doubt that the district court, when it chooses a remedy, will first determine which retroactive\n     seniority awards still present a live controversy.\n     80\n        That having been said, we do think that the district court’s declaratory judgment overstepped\n     in one particular respect: the district court permanently stripped all layoff seniority—not just\n\n                                                     125\n\f 1          It will, of course, be impossible for the district court to fashion a remedy that makes\n\n 2   everyone happy, much less whole. To the extent that the City Defendants’ employment\n\n 3   practices were discriminatory, there were too many victims to count. A few, the Offerees, got\n\n 4   permanent appointments and retroactive seniority. Others, like Ruben Miranda, did not. And\n\n 5   there may well be an untold number of non-Offeree individuals who failed the challenged\n\n 6   tests or were prevented from learning of the Custodian and CE openings because of recruiting\n\n 7   discrimination. Had the Government successfully pursued its case to judgment instead of\n\n 8   settling, this would probably have been one of those cases which would have “require[d]\n\n 9   class-wide, rather than individualized, assessments of monetary relief,” because\n\n10   “identification of the individuals entitled to relief would drag the court into a quagmire of\n\n11   hypothetical judgments and result in mere guesswork.” Robinson, 267 F.3d at 161 n.6\n\n12   (quotation marks omitted). Instead, the Government and the City Defendants entered into a\n\n13   settlement that attempted to identify victims of discrimination anyway—without consulting\n\n14   Local 891. To the extent that this settlement violated Title VII or the Equal Protection\n\n15   Clause, the Brennan Plaintiffs were victims of reverse discrimination, as were the other\n\n16   members of the Brennan class, of whom there are hundreds.81 At this point, nobody can really\n\n\n\n     retroactive seniority—from those individuals as to whom the district court found (1) that they\n     were not victims of discrimination, and (2) that the benefits they received from the settlement\n     agreement violated Title VII and/or the Equal Protection Clause. In order to obviate the need for\n     a subsequent appeal, we deem it appropriate to advise the district court that such a remedy, if\n     reimposed on remand, would constitute an abuse of discretion. To the extent that the district\n     court, as an equitable remedy for reverse discrimination against the Brennan Plaintiffs, takes\n     away any Offeree’s seniority, that Offeree’s seniority date should remain his or her permanent\n     appointment date under the settlement agreement.\n     81\n        As the district court noted in finding that the numerosity requirement for class certification\n     was satisfied, at least 77 candidates hired from the Exam 5040 eligibility list, 23 candidates hired\n     from the Exam 8206 eligibility list, and 122 candidates hired from the Exam 1074 eligibility list\n\n                                                     126\n\f 1   know who would have been employed as a Custodian or CE, and at what level of seniority, in\n\n 2   a hypothetical world in which there had been no unlawful discrimination.\n\n 3          There can be no doubt that the Brennan Plaintiffs, and many of the members of the\n\n 4   certified Brennan class, were harmed by the permanent appointments of the Offerees and by\n\n 5   the seniority stemming from those appointments. And to the extent the settlement benefited\n\n 6   some Offerees unlawfully, redress, in the form of adjustments in seniority, appears justified.\n\n 7   But, once the district court has reduced each “unlawful” Offeree’s seniority to his or her\n\n 8   permanent-appointment date, the value of further modifications to seniority dates begins to\n\n 9   dissipate quickly. Such additional modifications place a heavy cost upon innocent Offerees,\n\n10   while conferring possibly speculative benefits upon diffuse victims of reverse\n\n11   discrimination.82\n\n12          In any event, we need not and do not decide exactly what remedy the district court\n\n13   should impose (or to what extent the district court should find the liability on which any\n\n14   remedy would necessarily be premised). It is for the district court to decide what, if any, is\n\n15   the scope of the City Defendants’ liability, and then to exercise appropriate equitable\n\n\n\n     were injured. NYC Board III, 448 F. Supp. 2d at 445. That was a conservative estimate. It was\n     based only on median-hiring-date seniority, not the even greater provisional-appointment-date\n     seniority some Offerees received. It was also based only on the grants of retroactive seniority to\n     Offerees who had taken a challenged exam; the district court later expanded the Brennan class to\n     include “all custodial employees whose seniority for purposes of transfers, TCAs and layoff\n     protection has been adversely affected by the grant of seniority benefits to the Offerees.” NYC\n     Board IV, 487 F. Supp. 2d at 235-36.\n     82\n        We note that the City Defendants, who—unlike the Offerees and the members of the Brennan\n     class—are alleged perpetrators of unlawful reverse discrimination, have borne very little of the\n     cost of that discrimination. It may behoove the district court to consider whether an additional\n     award of equitable monetary relief, as described in Robinson, is an appropriate way to achieve\n     the three important goals of shifting these costs away from the Brennan Plaintiffs, of shifting the\n     costs to the alleged discriminator rather than to innocent Offerees, and of bringing this litigation,\n\n                                                     127\n\f 1   discretion in imposing a remedy. In doing so, the district court should explain why it\n\n 2   exercised its discretion in the way that it did, so that a reviewing court can determine whether\n\n 3   that discretion has been abused.83\n\n 4   X.     Conclusion\n\n 5          Because the district court in its Title VII analysis reached results inconsistent with the\n\n 6   Supreme Court’s subsequent decision in Ricci, its judgment must be vacated and remanded—\n\n 7   with two exceptions. First, we affirm the district court’s grant of class certification. Second,\n\n 8   paragraph 4 of the district court’s declaratory judgment, which states, “Ciro Dellaporte is not\n\n 9   a member of a protected class and, therefore, not entitled to any relief,” has not been appealed\n\n10   and therefore must stand.84 The judgment of the district court is therefore AFFIRMED in part\n\n11   and VACATED in part, and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with\n\n12   this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n     at last, to a close.\n     83\n        For example, and without casting doubt on its choice, it would have been helpful to us if the\n     district court had explained why it chose a declaratory judgment rather than the injunction\n     requested by the Brennan Plaintiffs.\n     84\n        The Brennan Plaintiffs argue that other portions of the judgment also must stand because they\n     pertain to the seniority dates of individual Offerees who did not appeal and as to whom the\n     Government does not seek different seniority dates from those specified in the schedules\n     attached to the declaratory judgment. We decline to carve up the district court’s declaratory\n     judgment in such a manner. With the exception of paragraph 4 of the declaratory judgment\n     (which we have affirmed), each paragraph of that judgment refers to a category of individuals,\n     one or more of whom has appealed.\n\n                                                     128\n\fREENA RAGGI, Circuit Judge, concurring in the judgment:\n\n       I join the majority in concluding (1) that the district court judgment can be affirmed\n\ninsofar as it (a) granted class certification to the Brennan Intervenors, and (b) declared Ciro\n\nDellaporte not a member of a protected class entitled to relief under the challenged\n\nsettlement, but (2) that the judgment must be vacated in all other respects and remanded for\n\nfurther consideration in light of Ricci v. DeStefano, 129 S. Ct. 2658 (2009). In reaching this\n\nconclusion, I agree with the majority that Ricci is not limited, as the Caldero and Arroyo\n\nIntervenors urge, to its particular facts. I also agree that the challenged settlement cannot be\n\ncharacterized as an affirmative action plan, so that we need not consider these intervenors’\n\nargument that Ricci does not apply to such plans. With due respect, however, I cannot join\n\nin the majority opinion because I think its extended discussion of Title VII jurisprudence\n\ngenerally, and the scope of the Ricci rule in particular, is not required to our decision to\n\nremand and yields an abundance of dicta that could confuse future consideration of\n\njudgments actually based on Ricci. As the Supreme Court has cautioned, “however helpful\n\nit might be for us to adjudge every pertinent statutory and constitutional issue” that could\n\narise in the application of a law or decision, “we cannot properly reach out and decide\n\nmatters not before us.” Granfinanciera, S.A. v. Nordberg, 492 U.S. 33, 64 n.19 (1989); see\n\nUnited States v. Tomasi, 313 F.3d 653, 660 (2d Cir. 2002) (Sotomayor, J., concurring in the\n\njudgment) (“While clarity in the law is always to be desired, judges should not indulge\n\nthemselves by reaching out to decide issues not squarely before them in order to accomplish\n\nthis result.”); see also PDK Labs., Inc. v. United States D.E.A., 362 F.3d 786, 799 (D.C. Cir.\n\n                                               1\n\f2004) (Roberts, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment) (identifying as\n\n“cardinal principle of judicial restraint” that “if it is not necessary to decide more, it is\n\nnecessary not to decide more”).\n\n       A.     Ricci Requires No Gloss from This Court To Permit Application by the\n              District Court on Remand\n\n       In Ricci, a case originating in this circuit, the Supreme Court addressed the same\n\nquestion raised here: “whether the purpose to avoid disparate-impact liability excuses what\n\notherwise would be prohibited disparate-treatment discrimination.” Ricci v. DeStefano, 129\n\nS. Ct. at 2674. Acknowledging that “statutes and principles” seemed to “point in different\n\ndirections,” the Court set itself the “task . . . to provide guidance to employers and courts for\n\nsituations when these two prohibitions could be in conflict absent a rule to reconcile them.”\n\nId. Toward that end, the Court pronounced the following rule:\n\n       [B]efore an employer can engage in intentional discrimination for the asserted\n       purpose of avoiding or remedying an unintentional disparate impact, the\n       employer must have a strong basis in evidence to believe it will be subject to\n       disparate-impact liability if it fails to take the race-conscious, discriminatory\n       action.\n\nId. at 2677. The Court explained that the requisite strong basis had to be “objective,” id.,\n\nand could not be satisfied by “a few stray (and contradictory) statements in the record,” id.\n\nat 2680. Further, it applied the strong-basis-in-evidence requirement to all three prongs of\n\ndisparate-treatment analysis set forth in 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)(1)(A), see id. at 2677-79\n\n(concluding that (1) “City was faced with a prima facie case of disparate-impact liability,”\n\nbut (2) the evidence raised “no genuine dispute that the [discarded] examinations were job-\n\n\n                                               2\n\frelated,” and (3) respondents “lacked a strong basis in evidence of an equally valid, less\n\ndiscriminatory testing alternative that the City, by certifying the examination results, would\n\nnecessarily have refused to adopt”). The Supreme Court apparently did not think that\n\ndistrict courts required any further guidance to begin applying the stated rule: “Our holding\n\ntoday clarifies how Title VII applies to resolve competing expectations under the disparate-\n\ntreatment and disparate-impact provisions.” Id. at 2681. Thus, I would simply remand this\n\ncase for further consideration in light of Ricci without attempting to anticipate or resolve\n\nquestions that are not now before us and that may never arise in this case. Case-by-case\n\nreview of judgments actually based on Ricci will afford sufficient opportunity to discuss\n\napplication of the strong-basis-in-evidence rule in particular circumstances.\n\n       B.     Concerns Raised by The Majority’s Discussion\n\n       The majority’s efforts to define the parameters of the Ricci rule in advance of\n\napplication by the district court raise a number of concerns in my mind. The following are\n\nmerely illustrative.\n\n       First, in order to engage in a detailed discussion of Title VII law generally and Ricci\n\nin particular in light of the evidence in this case, the majority finds itself obliged at the\n\noutset to decide the standard applicable to review of the factual record. While on an appeal\n\nfrom an award of summary judgment, we usually review the facts in the light most favorable\n\nto the non-moving party, see, e.g., Wilson v. C.I.A., 586 F.3d 171, 183 (2d Cir. 2009), the\n\nmajority elects to employ the “clear error” standard applicable after trial, see, e .g., Skoros\n\nv. City of New York, 437 F.3d 1, 12 (2d Cir. 2006). This choice is grounded more in record\n\n                                              3\n\fconfusion, however, than in law. As the majority explains, while the district court disposed\n\nof “the vast majority of the relevant issues . . . upon cross-motions for summary judgment\n\n. . ., in what appears to be a confusion about the case’s procedural posture,” some issues\n\nwere resolved after “‘evidentiary hearings.’” Ante at [45]. Unable to discern “why the\n\ndistrict court held these hearings, rather than a trial,”1 the majority simply decides “it best\n\nto treat the hearings as separate bench trials on separate issues,” and to review the findings\n\nfor “clear error.” Id. at [45-46]. This course of action has consequences for the ensuing\n\ndiscussion as the difference between review in the light most favorable to the non-movant\n\nand clear error review can be significant: the former standard favors the loser; the latter\n\nfavors the winner. There is no need to resolve this review standard to reach a remand\n\ndecision in this case. Indeed, there is good reason not to do so. On remand, the factual\n\nrecord may change as the parties seek better to address Ricci’s requirements. Moreover, the\n\ndistrict court can then clarify what, if any, “factfinding” informs a new final judgment.\n\n       Second, the majority concludes that the Brennan Intervenors’ claim of disparate-\n\ntreatment discrimination is properly reviewed according to the three-step analytical\n\nframework outlined in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973). The\n\nextensive discussion of McDonnell Douglas that accompanies this determination is not only\n\nunnecessary to our decision to vacate and remand, but it also risks confusing the question\n\nof discriminatory intent with the question of whether even actions taken with such intent can\n\n\n       1\n         Motions for preliminary injunction as well as summary judgment were pending\nbefore the district court; it is not clear which prompted the hearings.\n\n                                              4\n\fbe excused by a purpose to avoid disparate-impact liability. McDonnell Douglas analysis\n\nwas devised to answer the first question but, as a number of the judges of this court have\n\nrecognized, it is not well-suited to answer the second. See Ricci v. DeStefano, 530 F.3d 88,\n\n99-100 (2d Cir. 2008) (Cabranes, J., with Jacobs, C.J., Raggi, Wesley, Hall, and Livingston,\n\nJJ.) (dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc) (suggesting that issue should be resolved\n\nby mixed-motive analysis); accord id. at 89 (Calabresi, J.) (concurring in denial of rehearing\n\nen banc) (agreeing that mixed-motive analysis should have been used but for parties’ failure\n\nto present argument to district court or original appellate panel).\n\n       Significantly, in Ricci, the Supreme Court neither mentioned nor used McDonnell\n\nDouglas analysis in holding that plaintiffs were entitled to summary judgment on their claim\n\nof discriminatory treatment. See Ricci v. DeStefano, 129 S. Ct. at 2681. Rather, after\n\nobserving that the City defended against the treatment claim by professing a purpose to\n\navoid disparate-impact liability, see id. at 2673, the Court proceeded to consider the three\n\nfactors relevant to a disparate-impact claim, see 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)(1)(A), and\n\nconcluded that defendants lacked a strong basis in evidence to think that they would have\n\nbeen subjected to such liability had they failed to take the challenged race-conscious,\n\ndiscriminatory actions. See Ricci v. DeStefano, 129 S. Ct. at 2677-81.\n\n       No different approach is needed in this case, where defendants do not dispute that\n\ntheir challenged settlement actions were animated by intentional considerations of race,\n\nethnicity, and gender. Their defense, as in Ricci, is that “the purpose to avoid disparate-\n\nimpact liability excuses what otherwise would be prohibited disparate-treatment\n\n                                              5\n\fdiscrimination.” Id. at 2674. A decision to remand for reconsideration in light of Ricci does\n\nnot require us to shoehorn this defense into the second step of McDonnell Douglas analysis.\n\nIndeed, the fit is awkward.      At that step, a defendant need only articulate a non-\n\ndiscriminatory purpose for his actions, not demonstrate that intentional discrimination is\n\nsupported by a valid defense with a strong basis in evidence, as Ricci requires. See\n\nHolcomb v. Iona Coll., 521 F.3d 130, 141 (2d Cir. 2008) (explaining that “[i]t is not our\n\ntask, at the second stage of the McDonnell Douglas framework, . . . to determine whether\n\nthe [defendant’s] explanation of its action is convincing” bur rather only to “ask whether\n\ndefendant has introduced evidence that, ‘taken as true, would permit the conclusion that\n\nthere was a nondiscriminatory reason’” (quoting St. Mary’s Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S.\n\n502, 509 (1993) (emphasis in Hicks)).\n\n       Nor does our decision to remand require us now to decide whether, despite a strong\n\nbasis in evidence, a defendant’s claimed purpose to avoid disparate-impact liability might\n\nbe attacked as pretextual. See Ricci v. DeStefano, 129 S. Ct. at 2683 (Alito, J., concurring).\n\nMuch less need we decide that such a pretext attack occurs at step two of McDonnell\n\nDouglas analysis, as the majority indicates.2\n\n\n       2\n         Under McDonnell Douglas analysis, a plaintiff claiming pretext must show not only\nthat the stated non-discriminatory explanation was false, but also that discrimination was the\nreal reason for the challenged action. See, e.g., St. Mary’s Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. at\n515-16. But where a party engages in undeniably race-conscious conduct, so as to be liable\nfor discriminatory treatment absent a valid defense, see Ricci v. DeStefano, 129 S. Ct. at\n2673 (quoted in next paragraph of text), a showing that defendant’s true purpose was not to\navoid disparate-impact liability may defeat the defense without any need for further inquiry\nas to discriminatory intent. In any event, there is no reason to explore these issues in advance\n\n                                                6\n\f       Because defendants’ challenged settlement conduct was plainly animated by race,\n\nethnicity, and gender considerations, here, as in Ricci, any “analysis begins,” not with\n\nMcDonnell Douglas, but “with this premise: [defendants’] actions would violate the\n\ndisparate-treatment prohibition of Title VII absent some valid defense.” Id. at 2673\n\n(emphasis added). Thus, in ordering remand, we can leave it to the able district judge to\n\ndecide in the first instance whether defendants have the strong basis in evidence necessary\n\nto pursue a defense of disparate-impact liability. See id. at 2677.3\n\n       Third, the majority engages in an extensive discussion of affirmative-action precedent\n\nand strongly suggests that such plans would continue to be judged by reference to standards\n\nderived from Johnson v. Transportation Agency, Santa Clara County, 480 U.S. 616 (1987),\n\nand United Steelworkers of America v. Weber, 443 U.S. 193 (1979), rather than Ricci. The\n\nmatter is by no means clear. As the majority recognizes, the Supreme Court in Ricci did not\n\nso condition its ruling, signaling that “its core holding applies whenever an employer takes\n\nrace conscious action ‘for the asserted purpose of avoiding or remedying an unintentional\n\ndisparate impact.’” Ante at [66] (quoting Ricci v. DeStefano, 129 S. Ct. at 2677 (emphasis\n\nadded by majority)). Because this case does not involve an affirmative-action plan, there is\n\n\n\nof an appeal in a case in which they were raised.\n       3\n          I do not predict whether a case might ever arise in which an employer both denies\nthat a certain action was animated by impermissible considerations and asserts that the action\nwas, in any event, excused by a purpose to avoid discriminatory-impact liability. When such\na case arises, courts can consider whether McDonnell Douglas analysis would properly apply\nto the question of intent, with Ricci analysis then applied to the discriminatory-impact-\nliability defense. That, however, is not this case.\n\n                                              7\n\fno need to “harmonize[]” Ricci with affirmative-action precedent to order remand, much less\n\nto do so in a way that could be construed to cabin Ricci to cases challenging make-whole\n\nindividualized relief. Id. at [62]. To be sure, the majority’s earlier statement that “[i]n light\n\nof Ricci,” Johnson/Weber analysis “extends, at most, to circumstances in which an employer\n\nhas undertaken a race- or gender-conscious affirmative action plan designed to benefit all\n\nmembers of a racial or gender class in a forward-looking manner only,” id. at [8] (emphasis\n\nin original), appears properly to leave for another day any controlling resolution of Ricci’s\n\napplication to affirmative-action challenges. But that is all the more reason for this panel to\n\nexercise restraint and to order remand without anticipating cases not now before us.\n\n        Fourth, the majority attempts to provide the district court with detailed guidance as\n\nto how to apply the Ricci strong-basis-in-evidence test to the record facts. This too is\n\nunnecessary to our decision to remand and puts the cart before the horse. However\n\nappropriate it may be for an appellate panel to provide instruction when a district court has\n\nmisapplied Supreme Court precedent, such instruction is premature when a remand is ordered\n\nfor application of a new Supreme Court decision. That is particularly so here, where, as I\n\nnoted earlier, the Supreme Court signaled in Ricci that its own opinion was intended to\n\nprovide the necessary “guidance” by “clarif[ying] how Title VII applies to resolve competing\n\nexpectations under the disparate-treatment and disparate-impact provisions” of Title VII.\n\nRicci v. DeStefano, 129 S. Ct. at 2674, 2681. In these circumstances, we should let Ricci\n\nspeak for itself on remand without added gloss from this panel.\n\n       In particular, I question the majority’s attempt to “hold” in the absence of any\n\n                                               8\n\fjudgment applying Ricci, what is and is not sufficient to satisfy the strong-basis-in-evidence\n\nrequirement. Ante at [76-77]. Holdings consist of determinations necessary or pivotal to a\n\ndecision; judicial statements that are unnecessary to the decision in the case are mere dicta.\n\nSee United States v. Rubin, 609 F.2d 51, 69 n.2 (2d Cir. 1979) (Friendly, J., concurring) (“A\n\njudge’s power to bind is limited to the issue that is before him; he cannot transmute dictum\n\ninto decision by waving a wand and uttering the word ‘hold.’”); see also Black’s Law\n\nDictionary 800 (defining “holding”), 1177 (defining “obiter dictum”) (9th ed. 2009). Our\n\ndecision to remand this case for application of Ricci’s strong-basis-in-evidence standard does\n\nnot require us now to pronounce principles of sufficiency for identifying when that standard\n\nis met.\n\n          I am, moreover, dubious of the majority’s pronouncement that, “under Ricci, a ‘strong\n\nbasis in evidence’” requires “less than the preponderance of the evidence that would be\n\nnecessary for actual liability.” Ante at [76-77]. To be sure, in Ricci, the Supreme Court\n\nstated that the strong-basis-in-evidence requirement is “not so restrictive that it allows\n\nemployers to act only when there is a provable, actual violation.” Ricci v. DeStefano, 129\n\nS. Ct. at 2674. But there is a difference between the preponderance finding of a violation\n\nmade by a jury after trial and a court’s identification of sufficient evidence to permit a\n\npreponderance finding at trial, a difference that I fear may be lost in the majority’s broad\n\n“holding.” A party who cannot produce sufficient record evidence to support a possible\n\npreponderance finding by a jury on an issue on which the party bears the burden is going to\n\nwind up with summary judgment awarded against him. At some point, this court may have\n\n                                                9\n\fto consider whether a “strong basis in evidence” must be sufficient to survive a summary\n\njudgment motion. After all, on such a motion, evidence is viewed in the light most favorable\n\nto the non-moving party, which means that even some weak cases can survive summary\n\njudgment. We need not decide that question, however, to order remand in this case.\n\nTherefore, we also need not “hold” that Ricci can be satisfied on less evidence than would\n\npermit a preponderance finding at trial. Indeed, on remand, the district court may find\n\nsupport for the disparate-impact liability defense so compelling or deficient as not to require\n\na precise definition of the standard of proof. That was, after all, the circumstance in Ricci.\n\n       Fifth, the majority also discusses in some detail various challenges that the Brennan\n\nIntervenors might raise to defendants’ disparate-impact-liability defense. Again, this\n\ndiscussion is unnecessary to our decision to remand. Further, it is premature now to rule that\n\ncertain challenges could not defeat the defense in this case, or to imply that certain evidence\n\nis inadmissible. These matters are best decided in the first instance by the district court.\n\nCertain challenges may be resolved on remand, whether as a matter of law or fact, in ways\n\nthat will narrow or even eliminate the need for further appellate review.\n\n       As indicated at the outset, these concerns are illustrative and not exhaustive.\n\nNevertheless, they suffice to explain why I join in the Court’s decision to affirm in part and\n\nto vacate and remand in part without also joining in the majority opinion. Rather, I would\n\nsimply conclude (1) that the district court judgment can be affirmed insofar as it (a) granted\n\nclass certification to the Brennan Intervenors, and (b) declared Ciro Dellaporte not a member\n\nof a protected class entitled to relief under the challenged settlement, but (2) that the\n\n                                              10\n\fjudgment must be vacated in all other respects and remanded for further consideration in\n\nlight of Ricci.\n\n\n\n\n                                          11\n\f",

        In 1996, the United States (the “Government”) sued the New York City Board of\n\n20   Education and related parties (the “City Defendants”) claiming a violation of Title VII’s\n\n21   prohibition of disparate impact selection measures. The suit alleged that the City had, in hiring\n\n22   Custodians and Custodian Engineers (“CEs”) for its schools, (1) used, on three separate\n\n23   occasions, civil service examinations which discriminated against blacks and Hispanics, and (2)\n\n24   used recruiting practices which discriminated against blacks, Hispanics, Asians, and women.\n\n25   The parties entered into a settlement agreement in 1999 and asked the district court to enter it as\n\n26   a consent decree. The magistrate judge (Levy, M.J.)—who had jurisdiction by consent—\n\n27   approved the entire agreement, despite objections that primarily came from incumbent\n\n28   employees who were denied leave to intervene in the suit. The incumbent employees were\n\n29   unaffected by many of the agreement’s provisions, but they objected to four paragraphs that\n\n30   provided permanent appointments and retroactive competitive seniority to 63 black, Hispanic,\n\n                                                                     5\n\f 1   Asian, or female individuals, the “Offerees.”2 The City Defendants implemented the disputed\n\n 2   parts of the settlement while the incumbent employees’ appeal from their exclusion was pending.\n\n 3   In 2001, this Court vacated and remanded, holding that the district court should have permitted\n\n 4   the incumbent employees to intervene.\n\n 5            After the remand, the incumbent employees asked the district court to have the case sent\n\n 6   to a district judge rather than the magistrate judge; this request was granted. They then brought\n\n 7   two reverse-discrimination lawsuits against the City under § 703(a) of Title VII and the Equal\n\n 8   Protection Clause (via 42 U.S.C. § 1983); these cases were consolidated with the original 1996\n\n 9   Government lawsuit. The new lawsuits sought equitable relief and damages. The incumbent\n\n10   employees also requested class certification. Meanwhile, the Government decided that it would\n\n11   defend the settlement agreement only in part. This prompted two groups of beneficiaries of the\n\n12   settlement to intervene to defend the retroactive seniority that the settlement had granted them.\n\n13   One group, the Arroyo Intervenors, consisted of ten Offerees who had taken and failed a\n\n14   challenged exam; the other group, the Caldero Intervenors, consisted of twenty-two Offerees\n\n15   who had not taken any challenged exam.\n\n16            After years of contentious litigation, extensive discovery, and a set of three opinions\n\n17   spanning a total of approximately 150 pages, the district court (Block, J.) entered a final\n\n18   judgment. It held that some of the retroactive seniority provided by the settlement agreement\n\n19   violated Title VII, and that some of the retroactive seniority that did not violate Title VII violated\n\n20   the Equal Protection Clause. But, the court concluded that a significant remainder of the\n\n21   retroactive seniority was lawful. In particular, the court held (1) that the retroactive seniority of\n\n\n     2\n         As discussed below, the number of Offerees later decreased slightly.\n\n                                                       6\n\f 1   the test-failer Offerees3 did not violate Title VII or the Equal Protection Clause, except insofar as\n\n 2   layoff seniority4 was granted to individuals who were not actual victims of discrimination; (2)\n\n 3   that some of the test-failers were actual victims and others were not; (3) that the female non-test-\n\n 4   failer Offerees’ retroactive seniority did not violate Title VII or the Equal Protection Clause,\n\n 5   except that their layoff seniority violated both Title VII and the Equal Protection Clause since—\n\n 6   because there was no prima facie case of recruiting discrimination with respect to them—none of\n\n 7   them were actual victims of such discrimination; and (4) that the minority male non-test-failers’\n\n 8   retroactive seniority did not violate Title VII, but did violate the Equal Protection Clause. As a\n\n 9   remedy the court entered a declaratory judgment, accompanied by schedules specifying the\n\n10   extent to which each individual’s retroactive seniority was lawful. The class of incumbent\n\n11   employees was also certified, but their damage claims were rejected. Finally, the district court\n\n12   declined to enter any part of the disputed paragraphs of the settlement agreement into a consent\n\n13   decree.\n\n14             On appeal, the district court’s refusal to enter a consent decree is not challenged. The\n\n15   only disputes before us are the incumbent employees’ lawsuits, which claim that the City\n\n16   Defendants’ (voluntary) implementation of the settlement agreement violated § 703(a) of Title\n\n17   VII and 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The Title VII claim requires us to decide the applicability of Ricci v.\n\n18   DeStefano, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145848\"><a href=\"/opinion/145848/ricci-v-destefano/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Transp. Agency, Santa Clara County, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111846\"><a href=\"/opinion/111846/johnson-v-transportation-agency-santa-clara-cty/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">616</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1987), and United Steel Workers\n\n 3   of Am. v.

We hold that, contrary to the pre-Ricci law in this\n\n 4   Circuit, Johnson and Weber do not apply to all race- or gender-conscious employer actions. In\n\n 5   light of Ricci, the “manifest imbalance” and “no unnecessary trammeling” analysis of those\n\n 6   cases extends, at most, to circumstances in which an employer has undertaken a race- or gender-\n\n 7   conscious affirmative action plan designed to benefit all members of a racial or gender class in a\n\n 8   forward-looking manner only. Where, as here, the employer instead provides individualized\n\n 9   race- or gender-conscious benefits as a remedy for previous disparate impact, the employer must\n\n10   satisfy the requirements of Ricci, not Johnson and Weber, in order to avoid disparate-treatment\n\n11   liability. Under Ricci, the employer must show a strong basis in evidence that, at the time the\n\n12   race- or gender-conscious action was taken, the employer was faced with disparate-impact\n\n13   liability and that the race- or gender-conscious action was necessary to avoid or remedy that\n\n14   liability.\n\n15           In addition to our central holding, we address several other issues. We discuss a few\n\n16   matters related to the identification of those individuals who, the City Defendants had a strong\n\n17   basis in evidence to believe, were victims of disparate impact and, therefore, as to whom the\n\n18   retroactive-seniority provided in the settlement agreement was a proper remedy. We also discuss\n\n19   what remedies the district court might properly consider, and we advise the district court that\n\n20   while it may be appropriate to strip certain settlement beneficiaries of the retroactive seniority\n\n21   they received from the settlement agreement, it is not correct to strip them of seniority stemming\n\n22   from their permanent appointments. Because it is possible that the case can be resolved on Title\n\n\n                                                       8\n\f 1   VII grounds, we decline at this time to address the important and difficult Equal Protection\n\n 2   Clause questions that attach to the case. Finally, we affirm the district court’s grant of class\n\n 3   certification because, in so certifying, the district court did not abuse its discretion.\n\n 4           Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court’s judgment in part, VACATE it in part, and\n\n 5   REMAND the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n 6                                  Factual and Procedural Background\n\n 7   I.      The Parties\n\n 8           This appeal stems from three lawsuits involving five parties or groups of parties, who,\n\n 9   from different directions, attack just about every aspect of the district court’s judgment. The\n\n10   incumbent employees (the “Brennan Plaintiffs”)5 have appealed, and the Caldero Intervenors and\n\n11   the Government have cross-appealed. Since the City Defendants have withdrawn their cross-\n\n12   appeal and have not submitted briefs, the four parties before us are:\n\n13                  The Brennan Plaintiffs, who seek to invalidate as much of the four challenged\n\n14                   paragraphs of the settlement as possible.\n\n15                  The Arroyo Intervenors, who seek to defend the settlement for Offerees who\n\n16                   failed a challenged exam.\n\n17                  The Caldero Intervenors, who seek to defend the settlement for Offerees who did\n\n18                   not take any challenged exam.\n\n\n\n\n     5\n       The district court referred to the incumbent employees as the “Brennan Intervenors” because\n     they intervened in the original 1996 case brought by the United States. Because it is the two\n     subsequent cases brought by the Brennan Plaintiffs, and not the 1996 case, that are the focus of\n     this appeal, we refer to this group of individuals by the role they play in those cases.\n\n                                                        9\n\f 1                  The Government, which wishes to defend some portions of the settlement, but not\n\n 2                   others.\n\n 3   II.    General Factual Background\n\n 4          The focus of the Government’s 1996 lawsuit was the allegedly discriminatory hiring of\n\n 5   Custodians and Custodian Engineers by the City Defendants.\n\n 6          A.       Custodians and Custodian Engineers\n\n7           The Board of Education6 (the “Board”) employs Custodians and Custodian Engineers7 to\n\n8    take care of the approximately 1200 buildings in the City’s school system. Custodian and CE\n\n 9   positions are desirable supervisory jobs with good pay8 and civil-service protections. Each\n\n10   Custodian or CE is assigned to a school, and he or she supervises all the handymen and cleaners\n\n11   at that school. The Custodian or CE also has the responsibility for the upkeep, cleanliness, and\n\n12   safety of the assigned school. The main difference between Custodians and CEs is that CEs have\n\n13   more experience and a difficult-to-obtain stationary engineer’s license. During the times at issue\n\n14   in this case, the Board employed over 900 Custodians and CEs.\n\n15          Custodians and CEs are paid through a century-old, arcane, and idiosyncratic system\n\n16   known as the “indirect system.” See generally Beck v. Bd. of Educ. of City of New York, 268\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span>   <span class=\"reporter\">A.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">644</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 646-47 (N.Y.A.D. 2d Dep’t 1945). Under this system, the Custodian or CE is both a\n\n\n     6\n       The New York City Board of Education has been replaced by the Department of Education, but\n     we will continue to use the original party’s name, as do the parties to this litigation.\n     7\n       In 2000, these two job titles were changed to Custodian Engineer Level I and Custodian\n     Engineer Level II, respectively. At the same time, “broadbanding” occurred, which meant that it\n     became possible to be promoted from one position to the other without taking a new civil service\n     exam. The parties use the old job titles, and so will we.\n     8\n       The pay is lower for the first five years of a Custodian’s or CE’s employment. When a\n     Custodian or CE is first hired, the pay is 70% of what it would be for someone with five or more\n     years on the job. It is phased up to 100% over that period. Thus, newly hired Custodians or CEs\n\n                                                     10\n\f 1   civil servant and an independent contractor. The Board allots each Custodian a lump sum of\n\n 2   money based on the size and other characteristics of the assigned school. The Custodian uses\n\n 3   some of this money to hire cleaners and helpers and to pay for supplies, and, up to a specified\n\n 4   limit, he retains the rest for himself. The Board does not tell Custodians how to clean and\n\n 5   maintain things or whom to hire; it only tells them whether the school is being cleaned and\n\n 6   maintained satisfactorily. Custodians and CEs thus, purportedly, have an incentive to maintain\n\n 7   their schools adequately but in a cost-effective manner. Id.\n\n 8           B.      The Importance of Seniority\n\n 9           The seniority of a Custodian or CE is important in several ways, only three of which are\n\n10   relevant to the appeal before us: seniority improves a Custodian or CE’s ability (1) to get\n\n11   transfers to more desirable schools; (2) to get Temporary Care Assignments (“TCAs”)9; and (3)\n\n12   to avoid being laid off. At least for transfers and layoffs, the effect of seniority is specified in a\n\n13   collective bargaining agreement between the Board and the union representing Custodians and\n\n14   CEs, Local 891 of the International Union of Operating Engineers (“Local 891”). Before\n\n15   discussing those matters, it is worth noting one way in which seniority is not at issue in this\n\n16   appeal: some seniority (which is termed “non-competitive” seniority) concerns a Custodian or\n\n17   CE’s relationship with the Board in ways that do not affect the holder of that seniority’s\n\n18   relationship to other Custodians or CEs. For example, the seniority that affects the amount of\n\n19   pay a Custodian or CE receives is, in this sense, “non-competitive.” See supra note 8.\n\n20                   1.      Transfers\n\n21           Because Custodians and CEs earn higher salaries when they work in larger schools, it is\n\n\n\n     sometimes earn less money than their longer-serving subordinates.\n\n                                                       11\n\f 1   desirable, when the opportunity arises, for them to transfer to larger schools. When there is a\n\n 2   vacancy at a school, seniority plays a crucial role in determining who gets the transfer.10\n\n 3   Pursuant to the “rating and transfer plan” in the collective bargaining agreement for Custodians\n\n 4   and CEs, each school in the system is assigned to a particular “seniority bracket” based on its\n\n 5   square footage.11 CE brackets are associated with larger schools than the brackets for\n\n 6   Custodians who have the same level of experience. In addition, some schools are available only\n\n 7   to CEs, while some other schools are available to Custodians only if the Custodians have a\n\n 8   refrigeration license.12\n\n 9           Every few months or so, as needed, the Board issues a Vacancy List to Custodians and\n\n10   CEs. The Vacancy List sets out the schools with a Custodian or CE vacancy, and any Custodian\n\n11   or CE who is eligible to transfer may bid for open schools and specify his or her order of\n\n12   preference.13 Custodians and CEs may bid for a school above their seniority bracket, so long as\n\n13   the bidder is not a Custodian bidding for a CE-only school, or a Custodian without a\n\n14   refrigeration license bidding for a school that requires such a license. Then the Board looks at\n\n15   who has applied for each vacant school. If only one eligible person bids for a school, then that\n\n16   person gets the school. The vast majority of vacant schools do not result in competition; either\n\n\n     9\n       The significance of TCAs is discussed in section 2, infra.\n     10\n        For transfer purposes, seniority is based on the number of years in which an employee has\n     received a satisfactory rating in his or her current job title. A Custodian Engineer who\n     previously earned satisfactory ratings as a Custodian is not allowed to count his or her years of\n     Custodian experience for transfer seniority.\n     11\n        The three seniority brackets for Custodians are 1-5 years, 5-10 years, and 10 or more years.\n     The four seniority brackets for Custodian Engineers are 1-5 years, 5-10 years, 10-15 years, and\n     15 or more years.\n     12\n        A refrigeration license is a certificate of qualification for refrigerating machine operator.\n     13\n        Certain Custodians and CEs, such as those with pending disciplinary matters and those who\n     have transferred within the last two years, are not eligible to transfer.\n\n                                                     12\n\f 1   nobody or only one person bids for them. The most desirable vacancies, however, receive\n\n 2   multiple bids. In such cases, if at least one bidder is in or above the school’s seniority bracket,\n\n 3   then any Custodian or CE who is below that seniority bracket will not get the school. In other\n\n 4   words, a Custodian or CE can never get a school above his or her seniority bracket unless\n\n 5   nobody in or above the required seniority bracket applies for the vacancy. If two or more\n\n 6   candidates are in or above the required seniority bracket, then the transfer generally goes to the\n\n 7   applicant with the highest performance rating from his or her current school’s principal.\n\n 8   However, if any other candidate’s performance rating is within .25 points of the top candidate’s\n\n 9   performance rating, then seniority is used as a tie-breaker between them. The vacant school’s\n\n10   principal can veto a Custodian or CE, but this does not appear to be a frequent occurrence.\n\n11   Indeed, nothing in the record indicates that it has ever happened. Once an applicant is\n\n12   determined by the Board to be the top applicant for a vacant school, the applicant cannot\n\n13   withdraw his or her bid; transfer to that school is mandatory. About 1% of the schools in the\n\n14   entire system get a new Custodian or CE each time the transfer process occurs.\n\n15                  2.      Temporary Care Assignments\n\n16          Seniority also affects Temporary Care Assignments—though only slightly. When a\n\n17   temporary school vacancy results from illness, vacation, or leave, the Board fills the vacancy\n\n18   through the TCA process. Unlike the transfer process, the TCA process is not found in the\n\n19   collective bargaining agreement. The record conflicts as to whether the TCA process is\n\n20   governed by any contract negotiated with Local 891.14 A Custodian or CE who receives a TCA\n\n\n     14\n       James Lonergan, Director of Plant Operations for the Board, declared that “[t]he guidelines for\n     temporary care assignments are not negotiated [with Local 891] and are modified in terms of the\n     need of the Board of Education.” But Salvatore Calderone, also of the Board, testified at\n\n                                                      13\n\f1    will, for the duration of the TCA—usually two months—look after the TCA school in addition to\n\n2    his or her regularly assigned school. During that time, the salary of the Custodian or CE will be\n\n3    increased by 75%—or 100% in the unlikely event that the TCA lasts more than six months—\n\n4    even though he or she is not required to put in any additional time on the job. A Custodian or\n\n5    CE can reasonably expect to get a TCA once every two years.\n\n6            The process for assigning TCAs is somewhat different from the transfer process, but\n\n7    seniority still plays a role. The record is, however, unclear as to how significant that role is.\n\n8    Once a Custodian or CE has at least one year of experience, he or she is added to the TCA\n\n9    waitlist for the district in which his or her regularly assigned school is located, or for adjacent\n\n10   districts.15 As TCAs arise, they are assigned to the Custodian or CE at the top of the list, so long\n\n11   as the TCA school does not require a license or special skill that the top person does not have.\n\n12   Upon finishing the TCA, the Custodian or CE is returned to the bottom of the list.\n\n13           Because of the rotation system, seniority seems to play only a relatively minor role in the\n\n14   awarding of TCAs. The district court does, however, suggest a way in which seniority might\n\n15   make a difference. According to that court, there are three separate TCA lists in each district:\n\n16   one for CEs, one for Custodians with at least 15 years’ seniority, and one for other Custodians.\n\n17   United States v.

None of the parties’ briefs mentions three lists, nor do these briefs\n\n19   cite any part of the record supporting this proposition. But, if the district court’s statement is\n\n\n\n     deposition that “[t]here are temporary care guidelines that were negotiated between the\n     Department of Education and Local 891,” and that, although they are not found in the collective\n     bargaining agreement, they are contained in “[l]ike a side letter kind of thing.”\n     15\n        The record does not indicate whether the Custodian or CE would be added to separate lists for\n     his or her district and for each adjacent district, or instead added only to his or her district’s list,\n\n                                                        14\n\f 1   correct, then increasing a Custodian’s seniority might increase the size of the 15-year TCA list\n\n 2   and thereby work to the detriment of other Custodians on that list. This would correspondingly\n\n 3   benefit other Custodians who are on the fewer-than-15-years TCA list by decreasing that list’s\n\n 4   length. Similarly, it is to the advantage of any particular Custodian or CE for there to be as few\n\n 5   as possible other Custodians or CEs with at least one year of seniority in the same or adjacent\n\n 6   districts. For then it would not take as long to get back to the top of the list after a TCA\n\n 7   assignment.\n\n 8                    3.

The Hiring Process\n\n13          During the disputed period, the hiring process included four steps for Custodians and\n\n14   three steps for CEs. First, because a Custodian or CE is a civil servant within the “competitive\n\n15   class” as defined under New York law, an applicant wishing to become a Custodian or CE had to\n\n16   pass a civil service examination.16 The City Defendants administered three disputed exams: (1)\n\n17   Exam 5040, which was given in 1985 for the Custodian position; (2) Exam 8206, which was\n\n\n\n\n     but would somehow become eligible for TCAs in adjacent districts too.\n     16\n        See N.Y. Const. art. V, § 6 (“Appointments and promotions in the civil service of the state and\n     all of the civil divisions thereof, including cities and villages, shall be made according to merit\n     and fitness to be ascertained, as far as practicable, by examination which, as far as practicable,\n     shall be competitive . . . .”); N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law § 44 (defining the “competitive class” for\n     which examinations are required); Conlin v. Aiello, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">64</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.D.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">921</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 921 (N.Y.A.D. 2d Dep’t\n     1978) (“[T]he position[s] of school custodian and/or school custodian-engineer . . . are in the\n     competitive class of the classified civil service.”).\n\n                                                      15\n\f 1   given in 1989 for the CE position;17 and (3) Exam 1074, which was given in 1993 for the\n\n 2   Custodian position.\n\n 3          Second, an applicant had to submit “experience papers” explaining how the applicant\n\n 4   satisfied the minimum qualifications for the position. The minimum qualifications—a few years\n\n 5   of relevant experience for a Custodian, and a few more years plus the coveted high-pressure\n\n 6   boiler license (also known as a “stationary engineer license”) for a CE—were stated in the notice\n\n 7   for each of the aforementioned, disputed, exams. Once the exam was administered, the City\n\n 8   Defendants reviewed the experience papers for passing applicants. A finding of insufficient\n\n 9   experience could be administratively appealed. The exact proportion of appeals that overturned\n\n10   the City Defendants’ original findings is unclear and disputed, but the proportion of successful\n\n11   appeals clearly was not insignificant.18\n\n12          Third, for Exams 5040 and 1074 (the Custodian exams), but not for Exam 8206 (the CE\n\n13   exam), a practical test was required. The Exam 5040 practical was oral and it was given only to\n\n14   those applicants who had both passed the civil service exam and had had their experience papers\n\n15   accepted. Applicants were taken to the boiler room in a school in Brooklyn and asked questions\n\n16   about what they would do under various circumstances. For Exam 1074, this practical test was\n\n\n     17\n        Simultaneously with Exam 8206, the City Defendants administered Exam 8609, which was\n     identical. The only difference was that Exam 8206 was taken by members of the general public,\n     while Exam 8609 was taken by Custodians who wished to become CEs. NYC Board III, 448 F.\n     Supp. 2d at 406 n.12.\n     18\n        For example, on Exam 8206, the Government asserts that 23 out of 56, or about 41%, of the\n     individuals who passed the exam but initially had their experience papers rejected prevailed on\n     administrative appeal. And the District Court so found. NYC Board III, 448 F. Supp. 2d at 418\n     n.29. The Brennan Plaintiffs, however, suggest that the Government’s numbers for that exam\n     may also include individuals who challenged their test scores rather than their experience status.\n      For Exam 5040, the record indicates that 28 out of 132, or about 21%, of individuals initially\n     deemed unqualified won on administrative appeal.\n\n                                                     16\n\f 1   changed to a written format, so that the City Defendants could make sure that each applicant was\n\n 2   asked the same questions. Also, unlike the Exam 5040 practical, the practical for Exam 1074\n\n 3   was administered—and individuals who failed it were eliminated—before the experience papers\n\n 4   were reviewed. A small but non-trivial percentage of applicants failed the practical test.19\n\n 5          After these steps were completed, applicants who had passed the written exam, the\n\n 6   “experience papers” stage, and the practical exam (if applicable), were placed on an “eligible\n\n 7   list,” starting with the highest scorers on the written exam and ending with the lowest passing\n\n 8   scorers. When the Board needed a Custodian or CE, it would follow the “Rule of Three.” Under\n\n 9   this rule, it would call the top few people (usually three, but sometimes more if there were more\n\n10   than one vacancy) on the eligibility list for interviews. See N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law § 61(1). The\n\n11   vacancy or vacancies would then be filled by whichever ones of the interviewees were selected\n\n12   by the interviewers. Applicants who were interviewed three times without being hired would be\n\n13   removed from the eligibility list. The Board hired Custodians from the Exam 5040 eligibility list\n\n14   from Spring 1987 through Fall 1990. The Exam 8206 eligibility list was used to hire CEs from\n\n15   Spring 1991 through early 1994, and the Exam 1074 eligibility list was used for Custodians from\n\n16   early 1997 through early 2000.\n\n17          D.      Provisional Employees\n\n18          In addition to the permanent Custodians and CEs, who had to go through the above\n\n19   described process and who had competitive seniority and civil-service protections, the City\n\n20   Defendants hired “provisional” Custodians and CEs. Provisional Custodians and CEs can be\n\n\n     19\n       For Exam 5040, 678 applicants passed the practical oral exam out of 754 who took it. For\n     Exam 1074, the record does not state the exact passing rate, but a data sheet indicates that a large\n     majority of applicants who took the practical exam passed it.\n\n                                                     17\n\f 1   fired at any time, do not accrue competitive or non-competitive seniority, cannot bid for transfers\n\n 2   to other schools, cannot obtain TCAs, and have to work wherever the Board puts them. It is\n\n 3   therefore much better to be a permanent Custodian or CE than to be a provisional one. But\n\n 4   provisional Custodians and CEs have the same responsibilities at the schools to which they are\n\n 5   assigned as their permanent counterparts. And they are supposed to have the same experience\n\n 6   and, in the case of provisional CEs, the boiler license as well. Provisional Custodians and CEs\n\n 7   are hired when the Board needs Custodians and CEs but there is no appropriate eligibility list\n\n 8   from which to hire permanent employees. See N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law § 65.\n\n 9   III.   The Government’s Investigation and Lawsuit\n\n10          The U.S. Department of Justice began to investigate possible discrimination in the hiring\n\n11   of permanent Custodians and CEs in the early 1990s. A 1993 demographic survey revealed that\n\n12   more than 99% of the permanent Custodian and CE workforce was male, and 92% was white. In\n\n13   contrast, blacks constituted about 20% of the qualified labor pool for these positions, Hispanics\n\n14   made up about 19% and women about 8% of the pool. A 1996 demographic survey showed\n\n15   similar results. It also appeared (as was later confirmed by the investigation) that racial\n\n16   minorities and women were much more likely to be hired as provisional Custodians or CEs than\n\n17   as permanent Custodians or CEs, even though the qualifications for both were the same.20 These\n\n18   data aroused the Government’s suspicion that something in the permanent hiring process was\n\n19   discriminatory.\n\n20          Based on a statistical analysis of the results of the investigation, the Government sued the\n\n\n     20\n      As of 1997, 91% of permanent custodians and CEs were white males, about 8% were minority\n     males, and less than 1% were women. By contrast, 72% of provisional custodians and CEs were\n     white males, 16% were minority males, and more than 12% were women.\n\n                                                      18\n\f 1   City Defendants on January 30, 1996. The Government originally made both pattern-and-\n\n 2   practice claims (which require proof of intentional discrimination) and disparate-impact claims.\n\n 3   But it ultimately pursued only the disparate-impact claims. Two sets of these were asserted.\n\n 4          In the first, the Government alleged that some of the tests employed brought about\n\n 5   discriminatory results. Specifically, the claim was that Exams 5040, 8206 and 1074 had a\n\n 6   disparate impact on blacks and Hispanics. This allegation was based on a report from two\n\n 7   statisticians, who concluded that the statistical significance of the disparities in passage rates\n\n 8   between white, black, and Hispanic takers of those three exams21 was overwhelming—it ranged\n\n 9   from 2 to nearly 14 standard deviations. See NYC Board III, 448 F. Supp. 2d at 407.\n\n10          The second set of claims, the recruiting claims, alleged that the City Defendants’\n\n11   recruiting practices had a disparate impact on blacks, Hispanics, Asians, and women. In support\n\n12   of these claims, the Government produced a report by Dr. Orley Ashenfelter, a labor economist.\n\n13   The report said that the number of blacks, Hispanics, Asians, and women who took each of the\n\n14   three disputed exams was lower than the number that would be expected based on the\n\n15   representation of qualified individuals in the overall labor pool. Dr. Ashenfelter found that the\n\n16   differences were statistically significant at the 5% level, and for some groups the probability that\n\n17   the differences were the result of chance was much lower. Although Dr. Ashenfelter did not\n\n18   offer any opinion as to the cause for these disparities, the Government asserted that they resulted\n\n19   from limited advertising and word-of-mouth referrals that had a disparate impact on women and\n\n\n     21\n       No conclusion about Exam 8609, the exam for permanent Custodians who were applying to\n     become Custodian Engineers, was drawn, because the sample sizes were too small. Only 6\n     blacks and 3 Hispanics took that exam. Exam 8609 was, however, considered in the settlement\n     agreement that is discussed below, presumably because it was identical to Exam 8206. See\n     supra note 17.\n\n                                                       19\n\f 1   minorities.\n\n 2   IV.    The Settlement\n\n 3          By 1999, extensive discovery had been conducted, but the Government had not moved\n\n 4   for summary judgment and the case had not gone to trial. Before the Government had attempted\n\n 5   to prove its case in court, the Government and the City Defendants entered into settlement\n\n 6   negotiations, which concluded with the signing of a settlement agreement. Although much of\n\n 7   the agreement did not give rise to any objections from third parties, four paragraphs, numbered\n\n 8   13-16, came under attack. Only those four paragraphs, and the consequences of their\n\n 9   implementation, are at issue on this appeal.\n\n10          A.        Settlement Terms\n\n11          Paragraph 13 provided that all “Offerees” who were serving as provisional Custodians or\n\n12   CEs as of the date the court approved the settlement agreement would be granted equivalent\n\n13   permanent positions. “Offeree” was defined earlier in the agreement to include two groups: (a)\n\n14   all black, Hispanic, Asian, or female individuals who were employed as permanent or\n\n15   provisional Custodians or CEs as of the date of approval of the agreement; and (b) all black,\n\n16   Hispanic, Asian, or female individuals who had taken one of the challenged exams and had been\n\n17   hired as provisional Custodians or CEs after the date of the agreement but before court approval\n\n18   of the agreement. The list of the 54 people falling into group (a) was attached as Appendix A to\n\n19   the agreement.\n\n20          Paragraphs 14-16 gave the Offerees retroactive seniority in accordance with the\n\n21   following terms:\n\n\n\n\n                                                    20\n\f 1           For any Offeree listed in Appendix A of the agreement who had not taken a challenged\n\n 2            exam, the retroactive seniority date was the date of his or her provisional hiring.\n\n 3           For any Offeree listed in Appendix A of the agreement who had taken a challenged\n\n 4            Custodian exam, the retroactive seniority date was the earlier of (i) his or her provisional\n\n 5            hiring date, or (ii) the “Median Date”22 for the challenged exam that he or she took,\n\n 6            provided that if he or she had taken more than one exam then the earlier median date\n\n 7            applied.\n\n 8           For Offerees not listed in Appendix A of the agreement—those Custodian Offerees in\n\n 9            group (b), i.e., those hired as provisionals after the agreement but before court approval\n\n10            of it—the retroactive seniority date was the earliest provisional hire date for that\n\n11            Offeree’s job title, as listed in an earlier stipulation regarding provisional hires. Thus, if\n\n12            the Offeree was a provisional Custodian, he or she would get the earliest provisional hire\n\n13            date for Custodians, which was February 28, 1992. If the Offeree was a provisional CE,\n\n14            he or she would get the earliest provisional hire date for CEs, which was April 13, 1990.\n\n15            The agreement provided that the retroactive seniority dates would “apply for all purposes\n\n16   for which seniority is applied except any applicable probation requirement.” Accordingly, in\n\n17   addition to the TCA, transfer, and layoff benefits that are in dispute, the seniority dates provided\n\n18   various non-competitive benefits, which are not at issue here.\n\n19            B.     Court Approval\n\n20            After the Government and the City Defendants agreed to the settlement, it went to\n\n\n     22\n       The “Median Date” for each exam was the midpoint of the hiring period for that exam. The\n     median dates were: January 23, 1989 for Exam 5040; October 8, 1992 for Exam 8206; February\n     14, 1992 for Exam 8609; and October 27, 1997 for Exam 1074.\n\n                                                        21\n\f 1   Magistrate Judge Levy—to whose jurisdiction, as mentioned earlier, the parties had consented\n\n 2   pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(c)—for a fairness hearing, because the parties sought to have the\n\n 3   agreement entered as a consent decree.

The district court\n\n 6   gave notice and opportunity to object. Cf. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(n) (preventing subsequent\n\n 7   challenges to employment practices implementing a consent judgment if notice and opportunity\n\n 8   to object have been given). There were over 300 objections, about half of which were form\n\n 9   letters. NYC Board I, 85 F. Supp. 2d at 134 & n.3. Three objectors, who were white male\n\n10   incumbent permanent Custodians or CEs, moved to intervene: John Brennan, James G. Ahearn,\n\n11   and Kurt Brunkhorst. Id. at 134-35.\n\n12          The Magistrate Judge determined that the Government had made out a prima facie case\n\n13   of disparate impact for both the testing and recruiting claims. Id. at 141-45. Next, he\n\n14   determined that the settlement was fair and reasonable. He rejected the objections of Brennan et\n\n15   al., along with other objections not relevant here. In particular, he noted that the settlement\n\n16   “avoided the need for a complex, expensive, and lengthy trial,” and that extensive discovery had\n\n17   already taken place. Id. at 146. He also said that the settlement was consistent with the\n\n18   objectives of Title VII; and that, although it was the Board and not Brennan, Ahearn, and\n\n19   Brunkhorst who bore the responsibility for the past discrimination the suit and agreement sought\n\n20   to correct, the effect of the Offerees’ retroactive seniority on existing permanent Custodians and\n\n21   CEs was minimal. Id. at 146-51. Finally, the Magistrate Judge rejected the argument of\n\n22   Brennan et al. that they were entitled to intervene as of right pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil\n\n\n                                                      22\n\f 1   Procedure 24(a)(2). The court concluded that they did not have a protected interest in their\n\n 2   seniority because (1) the remedies afforded the Offerees were “designed only to return\n\n 3   employees to the positions they would have been in but for the alleged discrimination,” NYC\n\n 4   Board I, 85 F. Supp. 2d at 155, and (2) the possibility that the Offerees’ retroactive seniority\n\n 5   would affect the would-be intervenors was too “remote and speculative” to constitute a\n\n6    cognizable interest, id. at 156. Accordingly, the Magistrate Judge approved the settlement and\n\n 7   denied the motion to intervene. Id. at 157.\n\n 8   V.     The Settlement Is Implemented\n\n 9          Shortly after the Magistrate Judge’s approval of the settlement, the City Defendants\n\n10   began implementing the agreement. They notified 63 Offerees—the 54 individuals listed in\n\n11   Appendix A to the agreement, plus nine other individuals—that they were entitled to relief under\n\n12   the agreement, if they agreed to release all discrimination claims against the City Defendants. 59\n\n13   Offerees took the settlement, three resigned, and one declined the settlement. These 59 Offerees\n\n14   received permanent status, retroactive seniority, or both.\n\n15          For transfer and layoff purposes, the retroactive seniority operated as one would expect.\n\n16   The Offerees’ retroactive seniority was effective for both the seniority-bracket stage and the tie-\n\n17   breaker stage of the transfer process. And if layoffs were ever to occur, Offerees would be\n\n18   treated for purposes of the last-hired, first-fired rule as having been hired on their retroactive\n\n19   seniority dates. For TCA purposes, however, it is unclear what happened to Offerees who got\n\n20   retroactive seniority. As the district court pointed out, the record is contradictory as to (1)\n\n21   whether Offerees who were already permanent employees immediately went to the top of the list\n\n22   or stayed where they were, and (2) whether Offerees who were not permanent employees, or\n\n\n\n                                                       23\n\f 1   who had been permanent employees for less than one year at the time they accepted the\n\n 2   settlement, were put at the top or the bottom of the list upon completing their probationary\n\n 3   periods. See NYC Board III, 448 F. Supp. 2d at 412 & n.22. It is, however, clear that, as\n\n 4   provided in the settlement agreement, the Offerees had to wait out a one-year probationary\n\n 5   period before they were added to the TCA lists.\n\n 6   VI.    The Second Circuit Vacates and Remands\n\n 7          Brennan, Ahearn and Brunkhorst appealed the Magistrate Judge’s decision to this Court.\n\n 8   In August 2001, we vacated and remanded with instructions for the district court to permit the\n\n 9   Brennan Plaintiffs to intervene. NYC Board II, 260 F.3d at 133. We held that the Magistrate\n\n10   Judge had misapplied Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a)(2). First, we rejected the Magistrate\n\n11   Judge’s argument that the Brennan Plaintiffs’ seniority rights were presumptively the result of\n\n12   illegal discrimination, because it “put the cart before the horse.” Id. at 129. Second, we held\n\n13   that an employment civil rights plaintiff or intervenor does not have to show a property interest\n\n14   in his job or its attributes in order to intervene; rather, “where a proposed intervenor’s interests\n\n15   are otherwise unrepresented in an action, the standard for intervention is no more burdensome\n\n16   than the standing requirement.” Id. at 131. Third, we held that “because the exercise of\n\n17   seniority rights has a domino effect,” a Brennan Intervenor’s “loss of a desirable transfer need\n\n18   not be directly to an Offeree . . . for the loss to be the result of the [settlement] Agreement.” Id.\n\n19   at 132. Therefore, since the Board did not adequately represent the Brennan Plaintiffs’ interests,\n\n20   the district court should have allowed them to intervene. Id. at 132-33. We declined, however,\n\n21   to address the merits of the case:\n\n22          Appellants also ask us to exercise discretionary jurisdiction and rule on the merits of\n23          the Agreement, rather than remand the case to the district court. . . . We think such a\n\n                                                       24\n\f 1            course would be ill-advised. Appellants have argued convincingly that they were\n 2            denied the opportunity to develop a record that would have permitted a full and\n 3            appropriate ruling on the fairness and constitutionality of the Agreement. Given the\n 4            heavily factual nature of these issues, we believe that the best course is to remand the\n 5            case to allow for a full development of the record.\n 6\n 7   Id. at 133 (citation omitted).\n\n 8   VII.     Proceedings on Remand\n\n 9            After remand, this case lingered in the district court for about eight years, in the course of\n\n10   which several significant things happened: (1) the Brennan Plaintiffs filed two cases that were\n\n11   consolidated with the main case; (2) the Government began to attack parts of the settlement\n\n12   agreement; (3) the Caldero and Arroyo Intervenors entered the case in response to the\n\n13   Government’ change of position; (4) additional discovery and hearings took place; and (5) the\n\n14   district court issued a set of decisions upholding most, but not all, of the settlement against the\n\n15   reverse-discrimination attacks brought by the Brennan Plaintiffs, but declining to approve the\n\n16   settlement as a consent decree.\n\n17            A.      The Brennan Plaintiffs Intervene and File a Related Complaint\n\n18            In October 2001, on remand, the Brennan Plaintiffs,23 having been permitted to intervene,\n\n19   filed a Complaint in Intervention alleging primarily that the retroactive grants of seniority in\n\n20   paragraphs 13-16 of the settlement agreement violated Title VII and the Equal Protection Clause.\n\n21   The Government moved to dismiss these claims in November 2001. On February 28, 2002,\n\n22   before that motion was fully briefed, Magistrate Judge Levy approved the undisputed portions of\n\n23   the settlement agreement, with consent of the parties.\n\n24            Because of certain arguments raised in the Government’s motion to dismiss, and because\n\n\n     23\n          Around this time two new Brennan Plaintiffs (Scott Spring and Dennis Mortensen) were added\n\n                                                        25\n\f 1   the Brennan Plaintiffs wanted to add two new individuals with damage claims (John Mitchell\n\n 2   and Eric Schauer), the Brennan Plaintiffs, not satisfied simply to intervene, filed an action on\n\n 3   January 11, 2002 (“Brennan”). In this suit, Mitchell and Schauer claimed that, in violation of\n\n 4   Title VII and 42 U.S.C. § 1983, they had each lost a transfer to an Offeree because of the City\n\n 5   Defendants’ implementation of the settlement agreement. In addition to the damage claims, all\n\n 6   the Brennan Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief against the City Defendants, DOJ,\n\n 7   and the Attorney General. The Brennan case was eventually consolidated with the\n\n 8   Government’s case in November 2003.\n\n 9          B.      The Government Changes Its Position; Offeree Interventions Result\n\n10          On April 8, 2002, the Government filed a memorandum in response to the Brennan\n\n11   Plaintiffs’ February 2002 motion for a preliminary injunction. In this memorandum, the\n\n12   Government only partially opposed the motion. The Government opposed a preliminary\n\n13   injunction against the settlement as to Offerees who had taken a challenged exam, but not as to\n\n14   Offerees who had not. Two days later, the Government withdrew its previous counsel and\n\n15   substituted new counsel.\n\n16          Next, the City Defendants moved for approval of the remaining paragraphs of the\n\n17   settlement agreement, and the Government opposed this motion as “premature.” In July 2002, a\n\n18   recruiting-claim beneficiary, Janet Caldero, learned that the Government was no longer\n\n19   defending the settlement as to Offerees such as she. She and others in her situation, having\n\n20   obtained counsel, moved to intervene in October 2002. The parties agreed to the 22 Caldero\n\n21   Intervenors’ intervention in February 2003. Around this time, the Brennan Plaintiffs also\n\n\n\n     and one (Kurt Brunkhorst) dropped out.\n\n                                                     26\n\f 1   invoked their rights as parties to object to the magistrate judge’s 28 U.S.C. § 636(c) jurisdiction\n\n 2   to render a final decision, and, as a result, the case was returned to Judge Block.\n\n 3          Then, in September 2003, the Government changed its position again, triggering yet\n\n 4   another intervention. In response to some interrogatories during discovery, the Government\n\n 5   provided a chart detailing its current thinking about which Offerees were entitled to retroactive\n\n 6   competitive seniority. This chart indicated for the first time that, in addition to the 32 Offerees\n\n 7   who had not taken an exam, as to most of whom the Government had already indicated that it\n\n 8   would not be defending the settlement, the Government would now also not be defending the\n\n 9   settlement as to some (but not all) Offerees who had taken a challenged exam. Although the\n\n10   Government did not say that this latter group of Offerees was not entitled to any retroactive\n\n11   seniority, it did say that, for competitive seniority purposes, these individuals were entitled only\n\n12   to retroactive seniority dates later—usually by about two years—than those provided for by the\n\n13   settlement agreement. The chart also denominated the Offerees who had not taken an exam as\n\n14   “recruiting claimants,” and the others as “testing claimants.” That is, the Government separated\n\n15   the Offerees into two groups, based on the stage of the hiring process at which they allegedly\n\n16   suffered discrimination. Having learned of this document, some of the affected Offerees (the\n\n17   Arroyo Intervenors) moved to intervene. Their motion was granted in July 2004.24 See NYC\n\n\n     24\n       The Government said then, and continues to maintain now, that the changes indicated in the\n     chart were the result of new information the Government learned about individual Offerees in\n     post-remand discovery. See Gov’t Br. at 14. The Arroyo Intervenors say that the Government\n     changed its mind on the law, and not because of any new facts. We are puzzled by the\n     Government’s claim. It may well be that the Government learned information suggesting that\n     some Offerees were not victims of discrimination. And such information would explain the\n     Government’s refusal to defend the settlement as to those Offerees. But there do not appear to\n     be any new facts in the record explaining why the Arroyo Intervenors and other Offerees who\n     the Government thinks are victims of discrimination would be entitled to retroactive seniority\n\n                                                      27\n\f 1   Board III, 448 F. Supp. 2d at 417.\n\n 2   VIII. The District Court’s Opinions\n\n 3          After further discovery, the Brennan Plaintiffs and the Arroyo and Caldero Intervenors\n\n 4   cross-moved for partial summary judgment. Additionally, the City Defendants moved to enter\n\n 5   the settlement agreement as a consent decree, and the Brennan Plaintiffs moved for class\n\n 6   certification. The district court issued its first of three opinions on September 11, 2006.

After a hearing on\n\n 8   those facts, the district court issued its second opinion on April 20, 2007. See United States v.\n\n 9   N.Y.

After\n\n10   another hearing dealing with still remaining fact questions, the district court issued its third\n\n11   opinion on May 28, 2008. See United States v. N.Y. City Bd. of Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2414438\"><a href=\"/opinion/2414438/united-states-v-new-york-city-bd-of-educ/\"><span class=\"volume\">556</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">202</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n12   (E.D.N.Y. 2008) [hereinafter NYC Board V]. Final judgment was, at long last, entered on\n\n13   August 18, 2008.\n\n14          A.      The September 11, 2006 Opinion\n\n15          In its 2006 opinion, the district court considered first whether the settlement awards\n\n16   violated Title VII, and then whether they violated the Equal Protection Clause. The court\n\n17   concluded:\n\n\n\n     based on the median dates of the examinations they failed, but not to retroactive seniority based\n     on their provisional appointment dates (where such dates are earlier). The only basis for such a\n     determination would have to be that the retroactive seniority was based on the theory that the\n     examinations were not job-related, and not on the theory that the provisional appointment\n     process was a less discriminatory alternative to the examinations. That is, the Government\n     modified its legal theory and was not responding to a change in the facts. But, contrary to the\n     Arroyo Intervenors’ view, there is nothing improper in that. The Government is entitled to\n     change its position on the law, even in the absence of new facts. Yet, for some reason, the\n     Government goes to great lengths to deny that it has ever undertaken what appears to have been\n\n                                                      28\n\f 1                 As to the 28 black or Hispanic Offerees before the district court in 2006 who had\n\n 2                  taken and failed a challenged exam:\n\n 3                      o The lawfulness of one Offeree’s retroactive seniority could not be\n\n 4                          determined because there was a genuine issue of material fact as to\n\n 5                          whether Exam 8206 had a disparate impact on Hispanics; a hearing was\n\n 6                          required on that issue.\n\n 7                      o Seven Offerees were actual victims of discrimination and their entire\n\n 8                          retroactive seniority was lawful.\n\n 9                      o There were factual disputes as to whether the remaining twenty Offerees\n\n10                          were actual victims of discrimination, but their retroactive seniority for\n\n11                          TCAs and transfers was lawful regardless of whether they were actual\n\n12                          victims. Their retroactive layoff seniority, however, was lawful only if\n\n13                          they were actual victims.25\n\n14                 As to the 31 black, Hispanic, Asian, or female Offerees before the district court in\n\n15                  2006 who had not taken a challenged exam and/or were not among the groups on\n\n16                  which those exams allegedly had a disparate impact:\n\n17                      o One Offeree was really a white male. His retroactive seniority was\n\n18                          unlawful.\n\n19                      o The retroactive seniority of the other 11 male non-test-taker Offerees was\n\n20                          unlawful unless they could show that they were actual victims of\n\n\n     a legitimate change in legal position. See Gov’t Reply Br. at 4-7.\n     25\n        No party appeals the district court’s ruling that layoff seniority was properly limited to actual\n     victims of discrimination, but some parties do challenge the determination of whether particular\n\n                                                      29\n\f 1                          discrimination. According to the district court, giving them relief without\n\n 2                          such a showing would violate the Equal Protection Clause.\n\n 3                      o The 19 female non-test-taker Offerees could lawfully receive full\n\n 4                          retroactive seniority for transfer and TCA purposes, but not for layoffs.26\n\n 5   NYC Board III, 448 F. Supp. 2d at 446-47.\n\n 6          The court’s reasoning was as follows. First, it addressed a preliminary issue: whether the\n\n 7   Brennan Plaintiffs were correct in their assertion that five supposedly Hispanic Offerees were\n\n 8   not entitled to any relief because they were not in fact Hispanic. Relying on the EEOC’s\n\n 9   definition of “national-origin discrimination” in 29 C.F.R. § 1606.1, the district court held that\n\n10   “an ancestral place of origin is sufficient to establish membership in a protected class.” NYC\n\n11   Board III, 448 F. Supp. 2d at 422. Applying that definition, the district court held that one\n\n12   recruiting claimant, Ciro Dellaporte, was not Hispanic. Id. The other four—Kevin LaFaye,\n\n13   Steven Lopez, and the brothers Nicholas Pantelides and Anthony Pantelides, were Hispanic\n\n14   “because LaFaye’s father and the Pantelides’ mother were born in Puerto Rico, and Lopez’s\n\n15   grandfather was born in Mexico.” Id.\n\n16          Next, the district court sought to determine whether the retroactive seniority awards\n\n17   violated the Brennan Plaintiffs’ rights under Title VII. The district court relied heavily on the\n\n18   “affirmative action” framework of Johnson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111846\"><a href=\"/opinion/111846/johnson-v-transportation-agency-santa-clara-cty/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">616</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, and Weber, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110135\"><a href=\"/opinion/110135/steelworkers-v-weber/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">193</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, consistent\n\n19   with which an employer defending an affirmative-action plan against a Title VII reverse-\n\n20   discrimination challenge needs to show only that (1) there is a “manifest imbalance” in a\n\n\n\n     Offerees were victims.\n     26\n        The Caldero Intervenors do not appeal the holding that layoff seniority was limited to actual\n     victims of discrimination, nor does the United States challenge it.\n\n                                                      30\n\f 1   traditionally segregated job category and (2) the plan does not “unnecessarily trammel” the\n\n 2   interests of adversely affected third parties. NYC Board III, 448 F. Supp. 2d at 423-24. The\n\n 3   district court rejected the Brennan Plaintiffs’ argument that the Weber/Johnson framework did\n\n 4   not apply. Id. at 428-31. According to the district court, “there is nothing in Title VII that\n\n 5   vitiates an affirmative-action plan granting preferential seniority to non-victims of\n\n 6   discrimination.” Id. at 429.\n\n 7          Applying the “affirmative action” framework, the district court found a manifest\n\n 8   imbalance for both non-test-taker and test-failer Offerees. For the Offerees who had failed a test,\n\n 9   the district court said that the Government had satisfied the “manifest imbalance” requirement by\n\n10   showing statistical evidence sufficient to make out a prima facie case of testing discrimination,\n\n11   id. at 425-26, except as to Hispanics who took Exam 8206; as to them a hearing was required, id.\n\n12   at 427. For Offerees who had not taken a test (and who therefore, the court reasoned, could only\n\n13   be victims of recruiting discrimination, if they were victims at all), the district court relied on Dr.\n\n14   Ashenfelter’s analysis that found a statistical imbalance between the expected and actual\n\n15   numbers of black, Hispanic, Asian, and female takers of the three challenged exams. Id. at 427-\n\n16   28.\n\n17          Having found manifest imbalances, the district court proceeded to the “unnecessary\n\n18   trammeling” stage of the inquiry. The district court found that the transfer and TCA effects of\n\n19   the Offerees’ retroactive seniority did not unnecessarily trammel the rights of the Brennan\n\n20   Plaintiffs, because race, national origin, or gender would rarely be the deciding factor in whether\n\n21   a Brennan Plaintiff got a transfer, and even when one of these was the deciding factor the\n\n22   Brennan Plaintiff remained eligible for future transfers. Id. at 431. But the district court held\n\n\n                                                       31\n\f 1   that layoff seniority for non-victims of discrimination would unnecessarily trammel the Brennan\n\n 2   Plaintiffs’ rights. Id. at 431-34.\n\n 3           After resolving those Title VII issues, the district court examined the Equal Protection\n\n 4   Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, since the Brennan Plaintiffs had also attacked the\n\n 5   settlement under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. For the minority male Offerees the district court applied\n\n 6   strict scrutiny to the settlement grants of retroactive seniority. NYC Board III, 448 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n 7   434-35. This meant the City Defendants had to show (1) a compelling interest for adopting the\n\n 8   retroactive seniority, and (2) that the retroactive seniority was narrowly tailored to meet that\n\n 9   interest. The district court said that, in this particular case, such a showing required the City\n\n10   Defendants to demonstrate a strong basis in evidence that the Board’s own tests and/or recruiting\n\n11   practices were discriminatory. The court then held that the required showing was satisfied for\n\n12   Black and Hispanic Offerees who failed a test, because the Board had created the exams and the\n\n13   tests were adequately shown to be discriminatory against those racial groups. It was not,\n\n14   however, satisfied for non-test-taking male Offerees because although there was a significant\n\n15   disparity between the number of white test-takers and the number of black, Hispanic, or Asian\n\n16   test-takers, there was no sufficient evidence that this disparity was caused by the Board’s own\n\n17   recruiting practices. Id. at 434-35. The district court rejected the Brennan Plaintiffs’ claim that a\n\n18   compelling interest always requires a showing of intentional disparate treatment by the\n\n19   governmental entity asserting the interest, for such a requirement was, in the district court’s\n\n20   judgment, inconsistent with Supreme Court precedent and the policy of encouraging settlement\n\n21   of Title VII cases. Id. at 436-38. The court also found that the transfer and TCA seniority\n\n22   remedy for the test-failer Offerees was narrowly tailored under the factors listed in United States\n\n\n                                                      32\n\f1    v. Paradise, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111827\"><a href=\"/opinion/111827/united-states-v-paradise/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">149</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 171 (1987). Id. at 438-40. Layoff seniority even for these Offerees,\n\n 2   however, was not narrowly tailored. Id. at 440-41.\n\n 3          For female Offerees, the analysis was different. The district court, applying intermediate\n\n 4   scrutiny, did not require any showing of governmental (Board) involvement in the discrimination\n\n 5   the Board sought to remedy, so the City Defendants’ interest in remedying gender discrimination\n\n 6   could survive intermediate scrutiny even where their interest in remedying race discrimination\n\n 7   might not survive strict scrutiny. Id. at 441-43. Having found that transfer and TCA seniority\n\n 8   met the “narrowly tailored” standard during its strict scrutiny analysis, the district court easily\n\n 9   determined that transfer and TCA seniority were “substantially related” for intermediate scrutiny\n\n10   purposes as well.27 Id. at 442-43.\n\n11          The district court concluded its first opinion by addressing two other matters. First, the\n\n12   court refused to enter, as a consent judgment, the parts of the settlement agreement that had\n\n13   survived the Brennan Plaintiffs’ Title VII and Equal Protection Clause attacks. Id. at 443-44.\n\n14   Second, the Brennan Plaintiffs had sought class certification with respect to their claims for\n\n15   declaratory and injunctive relief. Even though none of the other parties in either action had\n\n16   submitted responsive papers, the district court approved the class under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23. Id. at\n\n17   444-46. The certified class consisted of “all custodial employees whose layoff-protection rights\n\n18   have been adversely affected by the grant of seniority benefits to beneficiaries who are non-\n\n19   victims of discrimination.” Id. at 446.\n\n20          The district court then listed the factual issues that still required a hearing:\n\n\n     27\n        The district court also held that layoff seniority for female Offerees was “substantially related”\n     to the goal of remedying gender discrimination. Id. at 442-43. (The district court made clear it\n     was aware that reaching this constitutional question was unnecessary in light of the court’s Title\n\n                                                       33\n\f 1          (a) which, if any, of the beneficiaries, in addition to Lloyd Bailey, Joseph Christie,\n 2          Belfield Lashley, Gilbert Rivera, Peter Robertin, Felix Torres and Mayra Zephrini\n 3          (Cintron), are actual victims of discrimination and received the relief to which they\n 4          were entitled; (b) whether the results of Exam 8206 in respect to Luis Torres satisfy\n 5          the evidentiary standards for establishing discrimination under Title VII and the\n 6          Fourteenth Amendment; and (c) whether John Mitchell and Eric Schauer[, the\n 7          plaintiffs seeking damages in the second consolidated action,] were denied transfers\n 8          in favor of particular individuals who impermissibly received retroactivity [sic]\n 9          seniority.\n10\n11   Id. at 447-48.\n12\n13          B.        The April 20, 2007 Opinion\n\n14          After holding hearings on the remaining factual issues, the district court issued a second\n\n15   opinion. See NYC Board IV, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2313755\"><a href=\"/opinion/2313755/united-states-v-new-york-city-bd-of-educ/\"><span class=\"volume\">487</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. This opinion discussed the results of those\n\n16   hearings and responded to several motions for reconsideration. In it the court held that:\n\n17                   Exam 8206 had been adequately shown to have had a disparate impact on\n\n18                    Hispanics. Id. at 224-32.\n\n19                   There was an issue of fact requiring a hearing as to whether the parties to the\n\n20                    1999 settlement agreement intended to distinguish between “testing claimants”\n\n21                    and “recruiting claimants,” or whether instead “the intent of the Agreement was\n\n22                    to give relief to blacks and Hispanics regardless of whether they failed a\n\n23                    challenged exam.” Id. at 232-33.\n\n24                       o If the former were true, then the district court would not hold a hearing as\n\n25                           to whether any recruiting-claim Offerees were actual victims of\n\n26                           discrimination, because at summary judgment there was insufficient\n\n\n\n\n     VII holding, but the court said that it wanted “to obviate any need for remand.” Id. at 443 n.53.)\n\n                                                       34\n\f 1                          evidence to warrant a hearing on any claim that they were actual victims.\n\n 2                          Id. at 224 n.3, 233-34.\n\n 3                      o If the latter were true, the district court said, it would be necessary to\n\n 4                          reconsider the Equal Protection Clause “narrow tailoring” analysis for the\n\n 5                          male recruiting claimants. Id.\n\n 6                  As a clarification, the Equal Protection Clause prohibited not only contested\n\n 7                   retroactive seniority for the minority male recruiting claimants, but also seniority\n\n 8                   benefits based, under the settlement agreement, on these claimants’ permanent\n\n 9                   appointment dates. Id. at 234-35.\n\n10                  The Brennan Plaintiffs’ class was expanded to include “all custodial employees\n\n11                   whose seniority for purposes of transfers, TCAs and layoff protection has been\n\n12                   adversely affected by the grant of seniority benefits to the Offerees.” Id. at 236.\n\n13                   In other words, the class was no longer limited to individuals affected by the grant\n\n14                   of seniority benefits to non-victims of discrimination, nor was it limited to\n\n15                   individuals who lost layoff protection rather than transfers or TCAs.\n\n16          C.       The May 28, 2008 Opinion\n\n17          The third opinion was issued in May 2008 after a hearing on the intent of the parties to\n\n18   the 1999 settlement agreement. See NYC Board V, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2414438\"><a href=\"/opinion/2414438/united-states-v-new-york-city-bd-of-educ/\"><span class=\"volume\">556</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">202</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. The court addressed\n\n19   two issues: first, whether the parties in 1999 intended to categorize Offerees into “testing-claim\n\n20   beneficiaries” and “recruiting-claim beneficiaries”; second, who among the testing-claim\n\n21   beneficiaries was an actual victim of testing discrimination.\n\n22          At the hearing, the district court heard the testimony of (1) Norma Cote, who had\n\n\n                                                      35\n\f 1   negotiated the settlement for the City Defendants, and (2) Katherine Baldwin, a Government\n\n 2   lawyer who was not directly involved in the settlement negotiations but who reviewed and\n\n 3   approved the agreement for DOJ policy compliance. Id. at 205-06. Cote testified that the\n\n 4   Government had never separated the claimants into recruiting and testing beneficiaries, nor had\n\n 5   it told the City Defendants that “the United States[] intended the settlement agreement to provide\n\n 6   make-whole relief calibrated to each [O]fferee’s individual injury.” Id. at 205. Indeed, she\n\n 7   testified that she did not recall the Government “ever explain[ing] to [her] why they wanted\n\n 8   these individuals to get retroactive seniority.” Id. at 205-06. Baldwin testified that DOJ’s policy\n\n 9   was “only [to] seek relief for identified victims of discrimination, [m]ake whole relief for\n\n10   identified victims of discrimination.” Id. at 206. Baldwin said that she and DOJ would not have\n\n11   approved the agreement if it had violated that policy. Id.\n\n12          Based on this testimony, the district court “conclude[d] that had the [City Defendants]\n\n13   and the United States operated under the assumption—now embodied in the Court’s holdings—\n\n14   that there was a sufficient evidentiary basis only for testing discrimination, blacks and Hispanics\n\n15   who had not taken one of the challenged exams would not have been included in the list of\n\n16   Offerees.” Id. at 207. The district court noted that the parties must have been aware in 1999 that\n\n17   (1) some recruiting claimants were being given retroactive seniority, because Asians and non-\n\n18   Hispanic, non-black women received that relief, and (2) “some blacks and Hispanics had not\n\n19   taken one of the challenged exams because that factor was relevant in determining whether relief\n\n20   would be based on the median hire date for a challenged exam or provisional hire date.” Id. at\n\n21   206-07. But the district court said that Baldwin’s testimony was “[m]ost compelling,” and that\n\n22   “[a]lthough the Court credits Cote’s testimony that the policy was not communicated to the\n\n\n                                                     36\n\f 1   Board, . . . the United States simply would not have condoned any agreement that went beyond\n\n 2   [make-whole] relief [to actual victims].” Id. at 207. The court also suggested that it was relying\n\n 3   on “the general principle of contract law that ‘reformation may be available where the parties\n\n 4   were under no mistake as to the words of the writing, but they supposed that the legal outcome\n\n 5   would be different.’” Id. at 207 n.4 (quoting 27 Williston on Contracts (4th ed. 2003) § 70:128).\n\n 6   For these reasons, the district court decided not to reconsider its holding that retroactive\n\n 7   seniority for male recruiting claimants would not be “narrowly tailored” for Equal Protection\n\n 8   Clause purposes. Id. at 207.\n\n 9          The court then made determinations as to who among the 27 testing claimants were\n\n10   actual victims.28 The court said that, for each of these claimants, the question was “whether the\n\n11   retroactive seniority they received approximately corresponds to the seniority they would have\n\n12   received but for the discriminatory exams.” Id. at 209. Additionally, “the parties to the\n\n13   Agreement—i.e., the United States and the Board—bear the burden of proof.” Id. The court’s\n\n14   determinations were as follows:\n\n15                 Seven—Lloyd Bailey, Joseph Christie, Belfield Lashley, Gilbert Rivera, Peter\n\n16                  Robertin, Felix Torres, and Mayla Zephrini (Citron)—were victims of\n\n17                  discrimination who received appropriate make-whole relief, because the Brennan\n\n18                  Plaintiffs had (supposedly) acknowledged this.29 Id. at 208 & n.6.\n\n\n\n     28\n        The district court did this because it had, in its 2006 opinion, held that among the testing\n     claimants only actual victims were entitled to layoff seniority, although all the testing\n     claimants—whether victims or not—were entitled to transfer and TCA seniority.\n     29\n        As explained in Discussion Part V.C, infra, the Brennan Plaintiffs now say they never made\n     any such acknowledgement and that there was no basis in the record for the district court to say\n     otherwise.\n\n                                                      37\n\f 1                 Ten—the Arroyo Intervenors—did not require a determination as to actual victim\n\n 2                  status because they had stipulated to layoff seniority dates.30 Id. at 208 & n.7.\n\n 3                 Two, Ronald Johnson and Fidel Seara, did not require a determination because\n\n 4                  the former had retired and the latter had died. Id. at 208.\n\n 5                 For the remaining eight, the parties had stipulated to facts but were unable to\n\n 6                  agree on their legal effect, so the court had to decide whether they were actual\n\n 7                  victims who had received make-whole relief.\n\n 8                      o Ricardo Cordero was an actual victim and received appropriate make-\n\n 9                          whole relief. He had failed Exam 5040, and his retroactive seniority date\n\n10                          was appropriately the median hire date for that exam. Id. at 209.\n\n11                      o Vernon Marshall was an actual victim, but his retroactive seniority date\n\n12                          required adjustment because, “for reasons that are not clear,” it was over\n\n13                          two years earlier than the median date for the exam he failed. Id. at 209-\n\n14                          10.\n\n15                      o Sean Rivera was not an actual victim. The settlement agreement had\n\n16                          given him a retroactive seniority date of November 7, 1995. He scored an\n\n17                          80 on Exam 1074, which had a median hire date of October 27, 1997.\n\n18                          This barely-passing score put Rivera close to the bottom of the Eligibility\n\n19                          List for the exam, so that he had not been hired at the time of the 1999\n\n20                          settlement agreement and it was unlikely that he ever would be. Against\n\n\n     30\n        This stipulation provides that if we or the Supreme Court hold that actual victim status of the\n     Arroyo Intervenors matters for any purpose other than retroactive layoff seniority, then the\n     stipulation will no longer apply on any further remand.\n\n                                                     38\n\f 1                          the odds, he was hired from the list after all on February 4, 2000. The\n\n 2                          district court said that the Government’ view that Rivera would have\n\n 3                          scored higher on a non-discriminatory exam, and would therefore have\n\n 4                          been hired earlier, was “purely speculative.” Id. at 210.\n\n 5                      o The other five testing Offerees—Thomas Fields, Carla Lambert, Angel\n\n 6                          Pagan, Anthony Pantelides, and Luis Torres—were not actual victims\n\n 7                          either. The Brennan Plaintiffs, relying on a post hoc review of applicant\n\n 8                          qualifications performed by the City Defendants while they were still\n\n 9                          litigating against the Government, argued that these five would have failed\n\n10                          the “experience papers” requirement even if they had passed the exams\n\n11                          they took. The court said that although, in this post hoc review, unlike the\n\n12                          actual hiring process, there was no opportunity for an administrative\n\n13                          appeal of an “experience papers” rejection, the Government had failed, at\n\n14                          the summary judgment stage, to meet its burden of providing “concrete\n\n15                          evidence that the post hoc review was incorrect as to any of the five whose\n\n16                          qualifications are challenged.” Id. at 210-11.\n\n17   IX.    The Miranda Lawsuit\n\n18          In 2006, Ruben Miranda, a Hispanic male incumbent Custodian aligned with the Brennan\n\n19   Plaintiffs, filed yet another lawsuit alleging violations of Title VII and § 1983 by the City\n\n20   Defendants. Miranda alleged that he was denied two transfers in 2005, and that he would have\n\n21   gotten the transfers but for the retroactive seniority given to Offerees Janet Caldero and Marcia\n\n22   Jarrett, who got the transfers instead.

Such claims require that a plaintiff “establish that the defendant had a\n\n 6   discriminatory intent or motive for taking a job-related action.” Ricci, 129 S. Ct. at 2672; see\n\n 7   also 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a) (“It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer . .\n\n 8   . to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against\n\n 9   any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of\n\n10   employment, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin . . . .”).\n\n11             Disparate-impact discrimination is also barred by Title VII.

Disparate impact occurs when an employer\n\n13   uses an employment practice that has a disproportionately adverse effect on protected groups.\n\n14   Ricci, 129 S. Ct. at 2672-73. An employer can rebut a prima facie showing of disparate\n\n15   impact by demonstrating that the employment practice is job-related, and the plaintiff, in turn,\n\n16   can rebut that showing by demonstrating that there is a less discriminatory alternative to the\n\n17   challenged practice.

Private\n\n10   conduct is, instead, governed by the liability provisions of § 703.\n\n11   II.       Procedural Posture and Standard of Review\n\n12             Before we discuss the numerous legal issues presented by this case, we pause to\n\n13   consider its procedural posture. The district court declined to enter the settlement agreement\n\n14   as a consent decree, and no party has appealed that decision. Accordingly, there is nothing\n\n15   left for us to decide with respect to the original 1996 NYC Board case brought by the\n\n16   Government. Indeed, the issue of settlement approval is now moot, for, as the district court\n\n17   explained, the settlement agreement expired by its terms on February 11, 2003:\n\n18             The Court cannot enter those parts of Paragraphs 13-16 that have survived the\n19             Brennan intervenors’ challenges as a consent judgment. In the first place, the\n20             Agreement was executed on February 11, 1999, and under Paragraph 11 was to\n21             “remain in force for a period of four years.” Also, the Agreement provided in\n22             Paragraph 47 that although the Court shall retain jurisdiction to ensure compliance,\n23             its jurisdiction “shall automatically terminate at the expiration of [the Agreement] as\n24             set forth in paragraph 11.” Magistrate Judge Levy, with the consent of all parties,\n25             entered all of its provisions save the challenged Paragraphs 13-16 as a consent\n26             judgment on February 28, 2002—well within that four year period—and the Court\n27             had jurisdiction to enforce it until February 11, 2003. The same enforcement\n\n                                                         43\n\f 1          limitation would have attached to Paragraphs 13-16 if they had also been reduced to\n 2          judgment prior to the expiration period. In short, even if all of the provisions of\n 3          Paragraphs 13-16 were deemed valid, the Court would nonetheless decline to reduce\n 4          them to a judgment which it would be powerless to enforce.\n 5\n 6   NYC Board III, 448 F. Supp. 2d at 443 (citation omitted).\n\n 7          Before us now is a pair of subsequent lawsuits brought by the Brennan Plaintiffs\n\n 8   (Brennan and Miranda) which had been consolidated with the original case below. Those\n\n 9   lawsuits allege that the City Defendants’ voluntary implementation, which took place around\n\n10   the year 2000, of the settlement agreement violated two statutes as to the Brennan Plaintiffs.\n\n11   The first is § 703(a) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a). The second is 42 U.S.C. § 1983, by\n\n12   virtue of an alleged violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n13   As remedies for these alleged violations, the Brennan Plaintiffs seek declaratory and\n\n14   injunctive relief, and damages in an amount to be determined at trial.\n\n15          The parties’ briefs and the opinions below indicate confusion over the procedural\n\n16   posture of this case. We therefore emphasize here, as we will throughout our opinion, that\n\n17   this case is about whether the City Defendants are liable to the Brennan Plaintiffs for\n\n18   violations of § 703(a) or the Equal Protection Clause. We are not deciding what remedy the\n\n19   district court could have ordered if, instead of agreeing to settle the case, the Government had\n\n20   proven a disparate-impact violation by the City Defendants in NYC Board. We are also not\n\n21   deciding whether the district court’s long ago decision not to approve the disputed portions of\n\n22   the settlement agreement and enter them as a consent decree was proper, in whole or in part.\n\n23   And we are not deciding whether, if the Government had directly attacked the seniority\n\n24   system itself as discriminatory, such an attack would have succeeded despite § 703(h) of Title\n\n25   VII, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(h). None of those questions are before us.\n\n                                                     44\n\f 1          The district court disposed of the vast majority of the relevant issues in Brennan and\n\n 2   Miranda upon cross-motions for summary judgment. But, in what appears to be a confusion\n\n 3   about the case’s procedural posture, there were a few issues resolved by what the district court\n\n 4   and the parties describe as “evidentiary hearings.” At these hearings, the district court heard\n\n 5   testimony and took evidence. The court subsequently made findings of fact. It is not\n\n 6   immediately clear to us why the district court held these hearings rather than a trial, and at\n\n 7   oral argument the Government admitted that it didn’t know either. Since the district court’s\n\n 8   2006 opinion had already declined to enter the settlement agreement as a consent decree, the\n\n 9   Brennan Plaintiffs’ Title VII § 703(a) and 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claims were what remained. No\n\n10   party to these suits appears to have requested a jury trial, although the Brennan Plaintiffs’\n\n11   damage claims for intentional discrimination in violation of Title VII would certainly have\n\n12   given rise to the right to one, see 42 U.S.C. § 1981a(c). Ordinarily, under these\n\n13   circumstances, a district court would have held a trial to decide any factual issues not resolved\n\n14   at the summary judgment stage. Given what occurred at the evidentiary hearings, and given\n\n15   that the Brennan Plaintiffs do not appear to have objected to the lack of a jury trial, we think it\n\n16   best to treat the hearings as separate bench trials on separate issues. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(b)\n\n17   (“For convenience, to avoid prejudice, or to expedite and economize, the court may order a\n\n18   separate trial of one or more separate issues . . . .”). And we review them as such.\n\n19          This means that in this opinion, “[w]e review de novo the district court’s partial grant\n\n20   of summary judgment, construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving\n\n21   party.” Weintraub v.

Prima Facie Case and Defenses\n\n 5          We consider the Brennan Plaintiffs’ Title VII claim first, leaving their constitutional\n\n 6   claims to be considered later and only as necessary. See Ricci, 129 S. Ct. at 2672. In order to\n\n 7   address the Brennan Plaintiffs’ § 703(a) disparate-treatment claim in its present procedural\n\n 8   posture, we must first determine which overall framework applies. Generally, § 703(a) claims\n\n 9   are analyzed under the burden-shifting rules of McDonnell Douglas Corp. v.

Under McDonnell Douglas, a plaintiff must first make out a prima facie\n\n11   case, i.e., she “must demonstrate the following: (1) she was within the protected class; (2) she\n\n12   was qualified for the position; (3) she was subject to an adverse employment action; and (4)\n\n13   the adverse action occurred under circumstances giving rise to an inference of\n\n14   discrimination.” Leibowitz v.

Once the prima facie case has been shown,\n\n17   “the burden then must shift to the employer to articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory\n\n18   reason” for the adverse employment action. McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802; accord\n\n19   Vivenzio, 611 F.3d at 106; Leibowitz, 584 F.3d at 498-99. The burden then shifts back to the\n\n20   plaintiff “to show that [the defendant’s] stated reason for [the adverse employment action]\n\n21   was in fact pretext.” McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 804; accord Vivenzio, 611 F.3d at 106;\n\n22   Leibowitz, 584 F.3d at 499.\n\n\n\n                                                      46\n\f 1             Because the Supreme Court’s majority opinion in Ricci33 does not explicitly cite\n\n 2   McDonnell Douglas or any other case in that line, one might reasonably ask whether some\n\n 3   other framework ought to apply in reverse-discrimination cases of this sort. In our view,\n\n 4   however, Ricci fits well within the McDonnell Douglas framework. As the Ricci Court\n\n 5   explained, New Haven “rejected the test results solely because the higher scoring candidates\n\n 6   were white. The question is . . . whether the City had a lawful justification for its race-based\n\n 7   action.” Ricci, 129 S. Ct. at 2674. In other words, because the City’s decision to reject the\n\n 8   test results was explicitly based on a statistical racial disparity, it was beyond dispute that the\n\n 9   plaintiffs had made out a prima facie case, so the burden shifted to the defendants to give a\n\n10   legitimate justification for the adverse employment action. The Court then held that, on\n\n11   summary judgment, the defendants had failed to provide a legitimate justification, id. at 2681;\n\n12   and so the “pretext” step of the inquiry was not reached. But if the Court had found a\n\n13   legitimate justification, it appears that a majority of the Justices would have proceeded to that\n\n14   step. Justice Alito’s concurring opinion, joined by two other Justices, argued principally that\n\n15   “a jury could find that [New Haven]’s asserted justification was pretextual.” See id. at 2689\n\n16   (Alito, J., concurring); see also id. at 2683-84 (noting that “[i]f an employer offers a facially\n\n17   legitimate reason for its decision but it turns out that this explanation was just a pretext for\n\n18   discrimination, the employer is again liable,” and citing St. Mary’s Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span>   <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">502</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 506-07 (1993), a case applying McDonnell Douglas). The four dissenting Justices\n\n20   disagreed with Justice Alito on whether a jury could find a pretext, but they did not seem to\n\n21   disagree that the burden would shift back to the plaintiffs to show pretext. See id. at 2709\n\n\n     33\n          The Ricci opinion is discussed in detail in Part IV.B.1, infra.\n\n                                                        47\n\f 1   (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (suggesting that New Haven might have been liable, even on the\n\n 2   dissent’s view of the law, if the city had been “seeking to exclude white firefighters from\n\n 3   promotion”). We, therefore, conclude that Ricci does not impose a new § 703(a) summary-\n\n 4   judgment burden-shifting framework, but instead constitutes, in this respect, a straightforward\n\n 5   application of the first two steps of McDonnell Douglas.\n\n 6          The earlier Supreme Court cases dealing with § 703(a) challenges to affirmative action\n\n 7   plans further support the view that McDonnell Douglas is the appropriate framework for this\n\n 8   case. Like Ricci, these cases reconcile the disparate-treatment provisions of Title VII with the\n\n 9   statute’s other goals by recognizing a defense which employers may raise when they are sued\n\n10   for disparate treatment. The Supreme Court has explicitly stated that the “affirmative action”\n\n11   defense, too, is properly raised at the second step of the McDonnell Douglas framework. See\n\n12   Johnson v. Transp.

The existence of an affirmative action plan\n\n17   provides such a rationale.” (citation omitted)).\n\n18          We therefore apply McDonnell Douglas to the Brennan Plaintiffs’ § 703(a) claim.\n\n19   And the first question we must address is whether the Brennan Plaintiffs have satisfied the\n\n20   requirements for a prima facie case under McDonnell Douglas.34 We easily conclude that the\n\n\n     34\n       The district court considered whether the Brennan Plaintiffs’ claims were ripe, since they had\n     not been laid off and some of them had arguably not been denied transfers or TCAs. See NYC\n     Board III, 448 F. Supp. 2d at 421 n.33. We agree with the district court that the Brennan\n\n                                                        48\n\f1   Brennan Plaintiffs have made out a prima facie case. All but one of the individual plaintiffs\n\n2   (not counting unnamed members of the class certified by the district court) are white males.35\n\n3   There is no dispute as to their qualifications. The City Defendants gave the Offerees\n\n4   retroactive seniority at the expense of the Brennan Plaintiffs.36 And the 1999 settlement\n\n\n\n    Plaintiffs’ claims are ripe. Some of them have lost transfers directly to Offerees, while others\n    may have lost them indirectly as a result of the “domino effect” we described in NYC Board II,\n    260 F.3d at 132. The Brennan Plaintiffs also claim that they have received TCAs less often than\n    they would have, but for the City Defendants’ implementation of the settlement agreement. And\n    although there have not been any layoffs, we think that the Brennan Plaintiffs’ layoff claims, in\n    the context of this case, are ripe for adjudication. In some cases where the manner in which\n    layoffs are set to occur is challenged before there actually are any layoffs, it is best for a court to\n    wait for a challenge by individual employees to actual layoffs, because the specific application\n    of the layoff procedures may better inform the court than a consideration of those procedures in\n    the abstract.

Cf. Ricci, 129 S.

Ct. at 2673.37\n\n\n\n     2004)).\n\n               To be materially adverse, a change in working conditions must be more disruptive\n               than a mere inconvenience or an alteration of job responsibilities. Examples of such a\n               change include termination of employment, a demotion evidenced by a decrease in\n               wage or salary, a less distinguished title, a material loss of benefits, significantly\n               diminished material responsibilities, or other indices unique to a particular situation.\n               Only in limited circumstances does a single, acute incident of abuse qualify as an\n               adverse employment action.\n\n     Mathirampuzha, 548 F.3d at 78-79 (citation and quotation marks omitted). Under this standard,\n     genuine issues of material fact, to be addressed by the district court, remain as to the TCAs as\n     well: did the Brennan Plaintiffs suffer significant delays in obtaining TCAs as a result of the City\n     Defendants’ actions, and if so, were they sufficiently significant as to constitute an adverse\n     employment action?\n     37\n        Ricci itself only involved race discrimination, not gender discrimination. And it draws on\n     Equal Protection Clause cases that employed the strict scrutiny standard applicable to race\n     discrimination. See 129 S. Ct. at 2675. But, because Ricci’s holding is an interpretation of\n     conflicting Title VII provisions that apply to both race and gender discrimination, see id. at 2676\n\n                                                         50\n\f 1          Taken together, the briefs of the Caldero and Arroyo Intervenors and the Government\n\n 2   raise two defenses on behalf of the City Defendants. The first defense, raised only on behalf\n\n 3   of the Caldero and Arroyo Intervenors, is that the City Defendants’ voluntary implementation\n\n 4   of the settlement agreement was a valid affirmative action plan. The second, raised or\n\n 5   suggested in somewhat different ways as to various specific Offerees by all three of these\n\n 6   parties, is the “strong basis in evidence” defense recognized in Ricci. There is no dispute that\n\n 7   to the extent that the City Defendants’ actions are not justified by one of these defenses, the\n\n 8   City Defendants violated the Brennan Plaintiffs’ § 703(a) rights to be free from disparate\n\n 9   treatment. We will consider each defense in turn.\n\n10   IV.    Affirmative Action\n\n11          The Caldero and Arroyo Intervenors argue that the retroactive seniority awards were\n\n12   justified as part of an affirmative action plan, valid under Supreme Court precedent. They\n\n13   contend that, even if non-remedial, the seniority awards therefore do not violate § 703(a).\n\n14   Thus, according to these intervenors, even if, at the time the City Defendants implemented the\n\n15   settlement agreement, there was no reason to think that the individual recipients of retroactive\n\n16   seniority were victims of discrimination, such seniority would still be valid. The district court\n\n17   agreed in part, and held that, except for the retroactive awards of layoff seniority, the\n\n18   retroactive seniority awards constituted permissible affirmative action. We, instead, hold that\n\n19   the City Defendants’ implementation of the settlement agreement was not affirmative action\n\n\n\n     (“[W]e adopt the strong-basis-in-evidence standard as a matter of statutory construction to\n     resolve any conflict between the disparate-treatment and disparate-impact provisions of Title\n     VII.”); see also 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a) (prohibiting employment discrimination on the basis of\n     “race, color, religion, sex, or national origin”), we see no reason to limit Ricci to race\n     discrimination.\n\n                                                      51\n\f 1   at all, let alone permissible affirmative action; and that it was, therefore, error for the district\n\n 2   court to apply such an “affirmative action” defense to the Brennan Plaintiffs’ claims.\n\n 3           A.      Legal Background\n\n 4           The Supreme Court first recognized that a valid affirmative action plan constituted a\n\n 5   defense to a § 703(a) reverse-discrimination lawsuit in United Steelworkers of America v.\n\n 6   Weber, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110135\"><a href=\"/opinion/110135/steelworkers-v-weber/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">193</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1979). In Weber, a union and an employer collectively bargained for\n\n 7   an affirmative action plan under which 50% of the openings in an in-plant craft training\n\n 8   program would be reserved for black employees, until the percentage of black craft workers in\n\n 9   the plant reached a level commensurate with the percentage of blacks in the local labor force.\n\n10   A white production worker, who had not been selected for the training program, brought suit\n\n11   under § 703(a) of Title VII, arguing that he had been denied entry into the training program\n\n12   because of his race. The Supreme Court held that “Title VII’s prohibition in §[] 703(a) . . .\n\n13   against racial discrimination does not condemn all private, voluntary, race-conscious\n\n14   affirmative action plans.” Id. at 208. The Court did not “define in detail the line of\n\n15   demarcation between permissible and impermissible affirmative action plans.” Id. But the\n\n16   Court noted that the plan was “structured to open employment opportunities for Negroes in\n\n17   occupations which have been traditionally closed to them,” and that it did not “unnecessarily\n\n18   trammel the interests of the white employees” because it was “a temporary measure” that did\n\n19   not “require the discharge of white workers and their replacement with new black hirees” or\n\n20   “create an absolute bar to the advancement of white employees.” Id. The Court therefore\n\n21   held that the affirmative action plan in Weber “f[ell] within the area of discretion left by Title\n\n\n\n\n                                                        52\n\f 1   VII to the private sector voluntarily to adopt affirmative action plans designed to eliminate\n\n 2   conspicuous racial imbalance in traditionally segregated job categories.” Id. at 209.\n\n 3          The Court reaffirmed its Weber holding, and elaborated upon the requirements for a\n\n 4   valid affirmative action plan, in Johnson v. Transportation Agency, Santa Clara County, 480\n\n </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">5</span>   <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">616</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1987). In Johnson the defendant employer voluntarily adopted an affirmative\n\n 6   action plan for promotions of employees, and pursuant to this plan it promoted a female\n\n 7   employee over the male plaintiff. The plan took sex into account as one of several factors,\n\n 8   including the qualifications of applicants for promotions. The Supreme Court upheld this plan\n\n 9   against the male plaintiff’s § 703(a) attack because it satisfied two requirements. First, the\n\n10   plan was prompted by a “manifest imbalance that reflected underrepresentation of women in\n\n11   traditionally segregated job categories.” Id. at 631 (quotations omitted). “A manifest\n\n12   imbalance need not be such that it would support a prima facie case against the employer,” id.\n\n13   at 632, although just how far below the prima facie level a “manifest imbalance” could go\n\n14   was left unclear. In any event, there was a “manifest imbalance” in Johnson, because, among\n\n15   the positions at issue, “none of the 238 positions was occupied by a woman,” and this fact was\n\n16   properly viewed as an imbalance even though “in some job categories women were not\n\n17   qualified in numbers comparable to their representation in the labor force.” Id. at 636.\n\n18   Second, the plan did not “unnecessarily trammel[] the rights of male employees or create[] an\n\n19   absolute bar to their advancement.” Id. at 637-38. This was so because the plan imposed\n\n20   “goals” but not “quotas,” the male plaintiff “had no absolute entitlement to the . . . position”\n\n21   and retained his current position and title along with the ability to apply for future promotions,\n\n\n\n\n                                                      53\n\f1    and “the [defendant]’s Plan was intended to attain a balanced work force, not to maintain\n\n2    one.” Id. at 637-40.\n\n3           B.      Application of Johnson and Weber to the Settlement Agreement\n\n4           In the instant case, the district court held, and the Caldero and Arroyo Intervenors\n\n 5   urge, that, except for purposes of layoff seniority,38 the implementation of the settlement\n\n 6   agreement satisfied Johnson and Weber because, they say, it was spurred by a manifest\n\n 7   imbalance and it did not unnecessarily trammel the rights of the Brennan Plaintiffs. See NYC\n\n 8   Board III, 448 F. Supp. 2d at 423-34. In light of Ricci, we agree with the Brennan Plaintiffs\n\n 9   that the district court’s holding skipped a threshold step in the analysis. That is, to determine\n\n10   whether a voluntary, private, race- and sex-conscious employer action is eligible for the\n\n11   Johnson/Weber defense, courts must now ask whether the race- and sex-conscious action\n\n12   constitutes an affirmative action plan at all. In this case, we answer that question in the\n\n13   negative.39\n\n14                  1.      Ricci\n\n15          The Supreme Court’s recent decision in Ricci indicates that not all voluntary race- or\n\n16   gender-conscious employer action is properly analyzed under Weber and Johnson. In Ricci,\n\n17   the City of New Haven administered a promotional examination for its firefighters. The\n\n18   results yielded a significant racial disparity: according to the promotion rules and by virtue of\n\n19   the test scores, all ten individuals eligible for the then-existing lieutenant vacancies were\n\n\n     38\n        The Caldero and Arroyo Intervenors do not appeal the district court’s determination that the\n     grants of layoff seniority were not valid affirmative action.\n     39\n        In light of our holding, we need not address the Brennan Plaintiffs’ alternative contention that\n     § 703(a) always prohibits employers from voluntarily making race- or sex-conscious non-\n     remedial alterations to a facially non-discriminatory seniority system.\n\n                                                      54\n\f 1   white; and of the nine individuals eligible for the then-existing captain vacancies, two were\n\n 2   Hispanic and seven were white. See 129 S. Ct. at 2666. Because of this racial disparity and,\n\n 3   allegedly, because of fear of a disparate-impact lawsuit from black firefighters, the New\n\n 4   Haven Civil Service Board did not certify the test results. Id. at 2667-71. A group of white\n\n 5   firefighters then sued under § 703(a) for disparate treatment.\n\n 6          The Supreme Court, correctly, described New Haven’s decision as a “race-based\n\n 7   action.” Id. at 2674. But, even though the Court was addressing a § 703(a) reverse-\n\n 8   discrimination suit attacking a voluntary, private “race-based action,” the majority opinion did\n\n 9   not cite Weber or Johnson. Nor did the Court apply the “manifest imbalance” and\n\n10   “unnecessary trammeling” factors. Instead, the Court adopted a “strong basis in evidence”\n\n11   standard: “under Title VII, before an employer can engage in intentional discrimination for\n\n12   the asserted purpose of avoiding or remedying an unintentional disparate impact, the\n\n13   employer must have a strong basis in evidence to believe it will be subject to disparate-impact\n\n14   liability if it fails to take the race-conscious, discriminatory action.” Id. at 2677. Ricci thus\n\n15   makes clear that at least some race- or sex-conscious voluntary employer actions are not\n\n16   subject to the “affirmative action” analysis of Weber and Johnson.40 See id. at 2700\n\n17   (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (“This litigation does not involve affirmative action.”).\n\n\n     40\n       In their supplemental brief concerning Ricci, the Brennan Plaintiffs ask us to go further. They\n     argue that it would be “anomalous” if “an employer could provide race-conscious or sex-\n     conscious benefits under Title VII more readily than it could cancel the results of its chosen\n     selection device.” In essence, they ask us to hold that Ricci overrules Johnson and Weber in their\n     entirety, so that the strong-basis-in-evidence test applies in affirmative-action cases, and the\n     “manifest imbalance” and “unnecessary trammeling” test of those older cases is no more. We\n     need not and do not address this argument. Because we hold that the City Defendants’ action,\n     not being affirmative action, is not subject to the more employer-favorable test of Johnson and\n     Weber, we do not reach the question of whether Johnson and Weber would apply in a § 703(a)\n\n                                                       55\n\f 1          Before Ricci, this Court had held, relying on Weber, that “a showing of a prima facie\n\n 2   case of employment discrimination through a statistical demonstration of disproportionate\n\n 3   racial impact constitutes a sufficiently serious claim of discrimination to serve as a predicate\n\n 4   for employer-initiated, voluntary race-conscious remedies.” Bushey v.

Based on that reasoning, we\n\n 6   upheld, against a § 703 reverse-discrimination challenge, a public employer’s adjustment of\n\n 7   promotional examination scores for prison employees, in order to avoid a disparate impact on\n\n 8   minority officers. Id. at 227-28. After Ricci, however, the position taken in Bushey is no\n\n 9   longer tenable. A prima facie case of disparate impact is not, post-Ricci, an adequate factual\n\n10   predicate for all types of race- or gender-conscious employer actions. At least some race- or\n\n11   gender-conscious actions, such as the rejection of test scores because of their racial\n\n12   distribution, are not affirmative action and therefore cannot be supported by a mere “manifest\n\n13   imbalance,” or even by a prima facie case of disparate impact.\n\n14                  2.      Is the Implementation of the Settlement Agreement an Affirmative\n15                          Action Plan?\n16\n17          Since, after Ricci, not all race- or sex-conscious voluntary employer actions constitute\n\n18   “affirmative action” that might be properly analyzed under Johnson and Weber, we must\n\n19   decide what is an affirmative action plan and what is not.

Although the plan may call for individualized determinations,\n\n 3   the plan itself cannot be individualized. Under this definition, the City Defendants’ voluntary\n\n 4   implementation of the settlement agreement is not an affirmative action plan. The City\n\n 5   Defendants, and the intervenors who support them, therefore cannot rely on their affirmative\n\n 6   action defense.\n\n\n 7                          a.      What Is an Affirmative Action Plan?\n 8\n 9          The Supreme Court has never said what, for purposes of the Weber/Johnson defense to\n\n10   § 703(a), is an affirmative action plan. But the Court has differentiated affirmative action\n\n11   from other forms of relief a court might order under § 706(g) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-\n\n12   5(g). We think that distinction is applicable here.\n\n13          Before delving into those cases, we pause to note that, in adopting for § 703(a) the\n\n14   definition of affirmative action found in the Supreme Court’s § 706(g) cases, we do not mean\n\n15   to suggest that the authority of a court to order an employer to do something (as limited by §\n\n16   706(g)) is coterminous with an employer’s power to do that same thing voluntarily without\n\n17   violating § 703(a). The Supreme Court has expressly rejected that proposition, for the\n\n18   “suggestion that employers should be able to do no more voluntarily than courts can order as\n\n19   remedies ignores the fundamental difference between volitional private behavior and the\n\n20   exercise of coercion by the State.” Johnson, 480 U.S. at 630 n.8 (citation omitted). We rely\n\n21   on the § 706(g) cases only for their definition of what affirmative action is, and not for their\n\n22   discussion of when affirmative action is permissible.\n\n\n     States v.

Stotts, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111211\"><a href=\"/opinion/111211/firefighters-v-stotts/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">561</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1984) is the earliest §\n\n 2   706(g) case relevant to a definition of affirmative action. In Stotts, black firefighters in\n\n 3   Memphis, Tennessee, brought a § 703(a) pattern-or-practice racial discrimination claim\n\n 4   against the Memphis Fire Department. After settlement negotiations, a consent decree was\n\n 5   entered and approved by the district court. Among other things, the consent decree provided a\n\n 6   hiring goal for black firefighters. The next year, because of budget difficulties, Memphis\n\n 7   decided to lay some employees off. Under a contract between the city and the Firefighters’\n\n 8   Union, layoffs were to follow a “last hired, first fired” rule. The result of following that rule\n\n 9   would have been to lay off a significant proportion of black firefighters, thereby undoing\n\n10   much of what the hiring goal had accomplished. Upon the black firefighters’ request, the\n\n11   district court issued an injunction to prevent the black firefighters from being laid off. The\n\n12   Court of Appeals affirmed. In order to comply with this injunction, the city laid off or\n\n13   demoted several white firefighters instead, even though they had more seniority than the black\n\n14   firefighters protected by the injunction.\n\n15          Of the several arguments made in favor of the Stotts district court’s injunction, one in\n\n16   particular is relevant here. The Court of Appeals in Stotts reasoned that (1) if the black\n\n17   firefighters had shown a Title VII violation, the district court could, under § 706(g), have\n\n18   ordered the city not to lay off black firefighters, and (2) anything that a district court can order\n\n19   under § 706(g) when a Title VII violation has been proven, the court can also order to\n\n20   effectuate the purpose of a Title VII consent decree. Id. at 578. The Supreme Court disagreed\n\n21   with the first of these premises, and held that “the Court of Appeals imposed on the parties as\n\n22   an adjunct of settlement something that could not have been ordered had the case gone to trial\n\n\n                                                       58\n\f1   and the plaintiffs proved that a pattern or practice of discrimination existed.” Id. at 579. A\n\n2   court could not have ordered such relief, the Court explained, because “a court can award\n\n3   competitive seniority only when the beneficiary of the award has actually been a victim of\n\n4   illegal discrimination.” Id. But there had been “no finding that any of the blacks protected\n\n5   from layoff had been a victim of discrimination and no award of competitive seniority to any\n\n6   of them” at the time of the consent decree. Id. Stotts did, however, expressly avoid deciding\n\n7   “[w]hether the City, a public employer, could have taken this course without violating the\n\n8   law,” if Memphis had acted “unilaterally,” that is, voluntarily and not under court order. Id. at\n\n9   583.41\n\n\n    41\n       The Arroyo Intervenors assert that the Supreme Court answered this question in Local No. 93,\n    Int’l Ass’n of Firefighters, AFL-CIO C.L.C. v. City of Cleveland, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111748\"><a href=\"/opinion/111748/firefighters-v-cleveland/\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">501</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1986). Like so\n    many of the parties’ arguments in this case, however, this argument misconceives the case’s\n    procedural posture. Local 93 addressed whether § 706(g) prohibits a consent decree from\n    imposing certain types of relief. The Supreme Court held that § 706(g) does not apply to consent\n    decrees, or to voluntary employer action, at all. Id. at 521. But ours is a § 703(a) case, not a §\n    706(g) case; the Brennan Plaintiffs do not argue—and, in light of Local 93, could not argue—\n    that the City Defendants’ implementation of the settlement agreement violates § 706(g). And in\n    Local 93 the High Court emphasized in several places that it was not speaking to whether the\n    consent decree in that case was consistent with § 703(a). See id. at 517 n.8 (“Nor need we\n    decide what limits § 703 places on an employer’s ability to agree to race-conscious relief in a\n    voluntary settlement that is not embodied in a consent decree, or what showing the employer\n    would be required to make concerning possible prior discrimination on its part against minorities\n    in order to defeat a challenge by nonminority employees based on § 703.”); id. at 521 n.11\n    (“[W]e do not suggest that voluntary action by employers or unions is outside the ambit of Title\n    VII regardless of its effect on nonminorities . . . . The rights of nonminorities with respect to\n    action by their employers are delineated in § 703 of Title VII . . . .”); id. at 526 (“As noted\n    above, the fact that the parties have consented to the relief contained in a decree does not render\n    their action immune from attack on the ground that it violates § 703 of Title VII . . . .”); id. at\n    530 (“[T]he consent decree does not purport to resolve any claims the Union might have . . .\n    under § 703 of Title VII . . . . Indeed, despite the efforts of the District Judge to persuade it to do\n    so, the Union failed to raise any substantive claims.”); see also id. at 530-31 (O’Connor, J.,\n    concurring) (“As the Court explains, non-minority employees . . . remain free to challenge the\n    race-conscious measures contemplated by a proposed consent decree as violative of their rights\n    under § 703 . . . .

In Local 28, the Government successfully sued a union with a long and\n\n 3   egregious history of discriminating against blacks and Hispanics. The union was found to\n\n 4   have engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination in recruitment, selection, training, and\n\n 5   admission to the union. At the § 706(g) remedy stage, the district court established a 29%\n\n 6   nonwhite membership goal, ordered the union to adopt an affirmative action plan for reaching\n\n 7   this goal, and appointed an administrator to oversee the plan. The plan required the union\n\n 8          to offer annual, nondiscriminatory journeyman and apprentice examinations, select\n 9          members according to a white-non-white ratio to be negotiated by the parties,\n10          conduct extensive recruitment and publicity campaigns aimed at minorities, secure\n11          the administrator’s consent before issuing temporary work permits, and maintain\n12          detailed membership records, including separate records for whites and non-whites.\n13\n14   Id. at 432-33. After two appeals to our court, which resulted in only two changes to the\n\n15   plan—a minor modification to the white-nonwhite ratio, and an extra year for the union to\n\n16   meet the goal—the union had only reached 10.8% nonwhite membership. Id. at 434. State\n\n17   and local authorities moved in the district court to hold the union in contempt.\n\n18          The district court held the union in contempt, not simply because the union had not\n\n19   met the goal, but also because the union had failed to comply with the requirements of the\n\n20   underlying affirmative action plan, and had withheld information from the administrator and\n\n21   the court, thereby making monitoring the union’s compliance difficult. Id. at 434-35. The\n\n22   district court issued another contempt order after another year of noncompliance. Id. at 435-\n\n\n\n     there is no necessary predicate for race-conscious practices favoring one race over another, when\n     those practices are embodied in a voluntary settlement or in a consent decree rather than ordered\n     by the court over the objection of an employer or union.” (quotations and citation omitted)).\n     Accordingly, it seems to us clear that Local 93 does not stand for the proposition for which the\n     Arroyo Intervenors cite it.\n\n                                                     60\n\f 1   36. The court at that time established a slightly different minority membership goal, and\n\n 2   abolished the apprenticeship examination, which had been a vehicle for noncompliance. (The\n\n 3   examination was replaced with selection by a three-member board, which would select white\n\n 4   and minority apprentices at a one-to-one ratio.) A divided panel of our court affirmed in all\n\n 5   respects relevant here, citing “the union’s foot-dragging egregious noncompliance” with the\n\n 6   plan. Id. at 438 (citing EEOC v. Local 638, Local 28 of Sheet Metal Workers’ Int’l Ass’n, 753\n\n </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span>   <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1172</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1183 (2d Cir. 1985)).\n\n 8          At the Supreme Court, a four-Justice plurality upheld the affirmative action plan\n\n 9   against the union’s claim that § 706(g) permits a district court to award preferential relief only\n\n10   to the actual victims of unlawful discrimination. The plurality held that “§ 706(g) does not\n\n11   prohibit a court from ordering, in appropriate circumstances, affirmative race-conscious relief\n\n12   as a remedy for past discrimination. . . . [S]uch relief may be appropriate where an employer\n\n13   or a labor union has engaged in persistent or egregious discrimination, or where necessary to\n\n14   dissipate the lingering effects of pervasive discrimination.” Id. at 445 (plurality opinion).\n\n15   The plurality distinguished Stotts thus:\n\n16          Stotts discussed the “policy” behind § 706(g) in order to supplement the holding that\n17          the District Court could not have interfered with the city's seniority system in\n18          fashioning a Title VII remedy. This “policy” was read to prohibit a court from\n19          awarding make-whole relief, such as competitive seniority, backpay, or promotion,\n20          to individuals who were denied employment opportunities for reasons unrelated to\n21          discrimination. The District Court's injunction was considered to be inconsistent\n22          with this “policy” because it was tantamount to an award of make-whole relief (in\n23          the form of competitive seniority) to individual black firefighters who had not shown\n24          that the proposed layoffs were motivated by racial discrimination. However, this\n25          limitation on individual make-whole relief does not affect a court’s authority to order\n26          race-conscious affirmative action. The purpose of affirmative action is not to make\n27          identified victims whole, but rather to dismantle prior patterns of employment\n28          discrimination and to prevent discrimination in the future. Such relief is provided to\n29          the class as a whole rather than to individual members; no individual is entitled to\n\n                                                      61\n\f 1          relief, and beneficiaries need not show that they were themselves victims of\n 2          discrimination. In this case, neither the membership goal nor the Fund order required\n 3          petitioners to indenture or train particular individuals, and neither required them to\n 4          admit to membership individuals who were refused admission for reasons unrelated\n 5          to discrimination.\n 6\n 7   Id. at 474 (citation and footnotes omitted).42\n\n 8          The Local 28 distinction between affirmative action and make-whole relief, we think,\n\n 9   makes equal sense in the § 703(a) context, for it harmonizes Ricci with Johnson and Weber. In\n\n10   Ricci, a § 703(a) case, the employer action that was challenged was the discarding of the\n\n11   results of a test that had already been administered. This action was individualized, for what\n\n12   it did, in essence, was to give promotion—or at least another chance at promotion—to the\n\n13   individual black firefighters who had taken the test, at the expense of those firefighters who\n\n14   would have been eligible for promotion if the test results had been certified. As the Supreme\n\n15   Court explained:\n\n16          [W]e [do not] question an employer’s affirmative efforts to ensure that all groups\n17          have a fair opportunity to apply for promotions and to participate in the process by\n18          which promotions will be made. But once that process has been established and\n19          employers have made clear their selection criteria, they may not then invalidate the\n20          test results, thus upsetting an employee’s legitimate expectation not to be judged on\n21          the basis of race. Doing so, absent a strong basis in evidence of an impermissible\n22          disparate impact, . . . is antithetical to the notion of a workplace where individuals\n23          are guaranteed equal opportunity regardless of race.\n24\n25   129 S. Ct. at 2677. In other words, when an employer, acting ex ante, although in the light of\n\n26   past discrimination, establishes hiring or promotion procedures designed to promote equal\n\n\n     42\n       The fifth vote to uphold the affirmative action remedy in Local 28 came from Justice Powell,\n     who did not join the cited portion of the plurality opinion. His concurrence said very little about\n     Title VII. Of Stotts, Justice Powell said only that “[t]here, the question whether Title VII might\n     ever authorize a remedy that benefits those who were not victims of discrimination was not\n     before us, although there is language in the opinion suggesting an answer to that question.” 478\n     U.S. at 484 (Powell, J., concurring).\n\n                                                      62\n\f1    opportunity and eradicate future discrimination, that may constitute an affirmative action plan.\n\n2    But where an employer, already having established its procedures in a certain way—such as\n\n3    through a seniority system—throws out the results of those procedures ex post because of the\n\n4    racial or gender composition of those results, that constitutes an individualized grant of\n\n5    employment benefits which must be individually justified, and not affirmative action.\n\n6           The affirmative action plans in Johnson and Weber were quite different from such\n\n7    make-whole relief. The plan in Weber set out to achieve a better future racial balance among\n\n 8   skilled craftworkers at Kaiser Steel’s Gramercy plant, by requiring that 50% of production\n\n 9   workers chosen for the skilled craftworker training program be black. See 443 U.S. at 199.\n\n10   This plan was adopted pursuant to an affirmative-action provision in the collective bargaining\n\n11   agreement recently negotiated between the United Steelworkers and Kaiser. Id. at 197-98.\n\n12   The plaintiff, Brian Weber, argued that the plan violated § 703(a) and (d) because he was\n\n13   denied entry into the training program, in favor of less senior black workers. But the Supreme\n\n14   Court treated the plan in Weber as affirmative action. That result is readily explained by the\n\n15   Local 28 distinction. Instead of, say, granting retroactive seniority to specific individual black\n\n16   production workers, or throwing out the results of previous selection processes, the plan\n\n17   benefited all members of the racially defined class in a forward-looking manner. And it was\n\n18   adopted in a newly negotiated collective bargaining agreement rather than unilaterally by the\n\n19   employer in derogation of an earlier agreement.\n\n20          The plan in Johnson, likewise, did not grant individualized employment benefits to\n\n21   any specific women or racial minorities. The employer in Johnson, noting the\n\n22   underrepresentation of women in certain job classifications, decided to authorize the\n\n\n                                                      63\n\f 1   consideration of sex as one of several factors in deciding which of several qualified applicants\n\n 2   to promote. 480 U.S. at 620-21. Although this plan ultimately resulted in the promotion of a\n\n 3   woman over a man who was otherwise slightly better qualified, see id. at 623-24, the wheels\n\n 4   were set in motion ex ante. The employer decided on a plan that benefited the entire class of\n\n 5   women, and then it simply applied that plan in a particular instance. By way of contrast, the\n\n 6   employer had not previously adopted a different, gender-neutral method of selecting\n\n 7   employees for promotion and then opted to throw it out when confronted with the reality that\n\n 8   a particular woman would not be promoted under that method.\n\n 9          The Arroyo and Caldero Intervenors contend, however, that the line between\n\n10   “affirmative action” governed by Weber and Johnson on the one hand, and race- or gender-\n\n11   conscious action taken “for the asserted purpose of avoiding or remedying an unintentional\n\n12   disparate impact,” Ricci, 129 S. Ct. at 2677, on the other, must be drawn quite differently. We\n\n13   find their attempts to circumscribe Ricci to be without merit.\n\n14          The Arroyo Intervenors first suggest that Ricci essentially be limited to its facts. They\n\n15   say that Ricci applies only where an employer is motivated by “[f]ear of litigation alone,” id.\n\n16   at 2681, and that “Ricci’s new legal standard has no application to a case like this one\n\n17   involving an employer’s well-informed decision, after years of defending against employment\n\n18   discrimination claims, to enter into a settlement to redress ongoing and pervasive racial\n\n19   exclusion in a particular class of jobs.” Arroyo Reply Br. at 5. That argument confuses the\n\n20   Ricci strong-basis-in-evidence standard with the threshold question of whether Ricci applies.\n\n21   In Ricci, the Supreme Court said that an employer motivated by “fear of litigation alone” does\n\n22   not have an adequate strong basis in evidence. The Court did not suggest that the strong-\n\n\n                                                     64\n\f 1   basis-in-evidence standard applies only when an employer is motivated by “fear of litigation\n\n 2   alone.” Indeed, it would make no sense to require a strong basis in evidence of only those\n\n 3   employers who take race- or gender-conscious actions that are not “well-informed.”\n\n 4          Second, both the Arroyo and Caldero Intervenors assert that Ricci is limited to\n\n 5   situations in which an employer, acting to avoid a disparate-impact Title VII violation that has\n\n 6   not yet occurred, discards the results of a promotional exam that would otherwise result in the\n\n 7   awarding of particular promotions to particular candidates. Arroyo Reply Br. at 9-12; Caldero\n\n 8   Reply Br. at 64-66. That is, they seek to place at least three limitations on the scope of Ricci:\n\n 9   (1) Ricci applies only when the employer seeks to avoid a current disparate-impact violation,\n\n10   while remedies for previous violations are subject to Weber and Johnson; (2) Ricci applies\n\n11   only when the employment benefit denied to the plaintiffs is hiring or promotion; and (3)\n\n12   Ricci applies only when, in the absence of the employer’s race- or gender-conscious action,\n\n13   specific plaintiffs would have been entitled to specific positions. None of these narrow\n\n14   readings of Ricci seems to us valid.\n\n15          Ricci is not limited to cases where the employer seeks to avoid a current violation. As\n\n16   the Ricci Court itself stated, its core holding applies whenever an employer takes race-\n\n17   conscious action “for the asserted purpose of avoiding or remedying an unintentional\n\n18   disparate impact.” 129 S. Ct. at 2677 (emphasis added). And limiting Ricci to the avoidance\n\n19   of current violations would make very little sense. It would be strange to make an employer\n\n20   be subject to Ricci when it promises a set of employment benefits to test-passers but then\n\n21   unilaterally decides not to give the benefits out, while at the same time allowing that employer\n\n22   to avail itself of the more easily satisfied Johnson/Weber standard when it gives out another\n\n\n                                                      65\n\f 1   set of benefits, such as the seniority rights that will lead to the aforementioned benefits. Ricci\n\n 2   also is not solely about hiring or promotion. Nothing in the case suggests that when other past\n\n 3   established employment benefits are involved employers can take individualized race- or\n\n 4   gender-conscious action to remedy an asserted disparate impact without meeting the “strong\n\n 5   basis in evidence” test. See id. at 2676 (“[W]e adopt the strong-basis-in-evidence standard as\n\n 6   a matter of statutory construction to resolve any conflict between the disparate-treatment and\n\n 7   disparate-impact provisions of Title VII.” (emphasis added)). For similar reasons, Ricci does\n\n 8   not require that specific individuals be entitled to specific positions. When an employer lacks\n\n 9   a strong basis in evidence that it would otherwise be liable for disparate impact, the employer\n\n10   should not “upset[] an employee’s legitimate expectation not to be judged on the basis of\n\n11   race.” Id. at 2677. That expectation is upset by the race-conscious discarding of conditional\n\n12   entitlements to employment or employment benefits, just as much as it is when the entitlement\n\n13   is absolute.\n\n14          We therefore hold that § 703(a), like § 706(g), draws a distinction between affirmative\n\n15   action plans, which are intended to provide ex ante benefits to all members of a racial or\n\n16   gender class, and make-whole relief, which is intended to provide ex post benefits to specified\n\n17   individuals who have suffered discrimination. And where this latter form of benefits is at\n\n18   issue, the employer may not invoke the “affirmative action” defense of Johnson and Weber.\n\n\n19                          b.      The Employer Action in This Case\n20\n21          Having held that the Johnson/Weber framework does not apply to make-whole relief,\n\n22   we now apply this rule to the City Defendants’ voluntary implementation of the disputed\n\n23   portions of the settlement agreement. In our view, the City Defendants’ voluntary\n\n                                                      66\n\f 1   implementation of the settlement agreement falls on the Stotts side of the Local 28 distinction\n\n 2   between affirmative action and make-whole relief. The City Defendants’ implementation of\n\n 3   the disputed portions of the settlement agreement granted competitive seniority to the\n\n 4   Offerees. Competitive seniority is one of the forms of make-whole relief specifically\n\n 5   enumerated in Local 28. Moreover, it was competitive seniority that was, in effect, at issue in\n\n 6   Stotts, for when Memphis laid off white firefighters instead of black firefighters with less\n\n 7   seniority, the city was treating the white firefighters as if they were the less senior employees.\n\n 8          And, perhaps even more importantly, the reason why grants of competitive seniority\n\n 9   are generally not affirmative action, and therefore are generally limited to make-whole relief,\n\n10   is that retroactive seniority is by its nature individualized. The Offerees were a group of\n\n11   individuals defined by the settlement agreement to include provisional Custodians and CEs\n\n12   who were women or members of certain racial minority groups. Most of them were identified\n\n13   by name in an appendix to the agreement. It cannot be said that the City Defendants\n\n14   “provided [employment benefits] to the class as a whole rather than to individual members.”\n\n15   Local 28, 478 U.S. at 474. Instead, what the City Defendants did was “tantamount to an\n\n16   award of make-whole relief,” id., to individual provisional Custodians and CEs, arguably\n\n17   without adequate regard to whether there was any reason to think they might have been actual\n\n18   victims of discrimination, or to whether there was a strong basis in evidence that a disparate\n\n19   impact suit by them would succeed.\n\n20          The Caldero Intervenors urge that the retroactive seniority awards in this case are\n\n21   affirmative action even though “they do not look like the most typical kind.” They say the\n\n22   awards are a reasonable, narrower substitute for a general race or gender preference for school\n\n\n                                                      67\n\f 1   transfers. Their view seems to be that if a broad, non-individualized racial preference is\n\n 2   permissible provided that there is a manifest imbalance and the plan is narrowly tailored, then\n\n 3   race- or gender-conscious relief for only some of the individuals who would have benefited\n\n 4   from such a policy, had it been there in the past, must also be permissible. We do not agree.\n\n 5   Just as, in the § 706(g) context, courts have the power to order general racial preferences (as\n\n 6   in Local 28), but not individualized non-remedial relief (as in Stotts), so, employers also\n\n 7   cannot undertake individualized non-remedial relief and validate it by calling it “affirmative\n\n 8   action.”\n\n 9          The cases cited by the Caldero Intervenors are not to the contrary.

We\n\n15   rejected this challenge, holding that the Equal Protection Clause does not require a state using\n\n16   an affirmative action plan to “expand[]” the preferred class “to include other racial and ethnic\n\n17   groups that may have been discriminated against.” Id. at 207. Assuming arguendo that this\n\n18   equal protection reasoning applies in the § 703(a) context, Jana-Rock is distinguishable\n\n19   because it deals with the definition of a racial or ethnic beneficiary class. In our case, nobody\n\n20   is saying that the numerous other minority or female individuals who may have applied for\n\n21   Custodian or CE positions—or, for that matter, the minority or female incumbent Custodians\n\n22   and CEs like Miranda plaintiff Ruben Miranda—are not black, Hispanic, Asian, or female.\n\n\n                                                      68\n\f 1   They were excluded from the settlement agreement’s benefits, not because they were deemed\n\n 2   to be the “wrong” gender or race, but rather because they were not among the individuals\n\n 3   selected for individualized relief. That there may be some flexibility in how a racial or gender\n\n 4   class is defined does not undermine the requirement that affirmative action plans provide, on a\n\n 5   prospective basis, equal benefits to all members of that beneficiary class.\n\n 6          The Caldero Intervenors also rely on Stuart v.

The promotion goals for black officers\n\n 9   fell short of the projected number of such officers eligible for promotion: they amounted to\n\n10   15.5% of all sergeants, while the eligible pool contained about 20% black officers. Id. at 454.\n\n11   But, like a differently defined racial or gender class, a smaller promotion goal does not turn\n\n12   affirmative action into individualized relief. A 15.5% goal and a 20% goal are both “provided\n\n13   to the class as a whole rather than to individual members.” Local 28, 478 U.S. at 474. The\n\n14   retroactive seniority awards at issue in our case are, instead, expressly “provided . . . to\n\n15   individual members.”\n\n16          It is noteworthy, as well, that the Government claims it never intended a Stotts-like\n\n17   result when it entered the settlement agreement. The district court held a hearing to determine\n\n18   the intent of the settlement agreement, and at that hearing Norma Cote, the lawyer who had\n\n19   negotiated the agreement for the City Defendants, testified that she did not recall the\n\n20   Government “ever explain[ing] to [her] why they wanted these individuals to get retroactive\n\n21   seniority.” NYC Board V, 556 F.

According to these Intervenors, it was manifest in 1999 that\n\n20   the settlement agreement would provide retroactive seniority to the specified Offerees without\n\n21   regard to whether there was any evidence that they were actual victims. Therefore, they say,\n\n\n\n\n                                                      70\n\f 1   the Government and the City Defendants must have intended to create an affirmative action\n\n 2   plan. The Caldero Intervenors’ premise is correct, but their conclusion does not follow.\n\n 3          The Caldero Intervenors correctly point out that the settlement agreement contained a\n\n 4   specific definition of “Offeree,” and that this definition was not limited to actual victims.\n\n 5   They also correctly point out that the Cote testimony, which the district court credited,\n\n 6   indicates that the Government and the City Defendants did not perform any individualized\n\n 7   investigation of the Offerees to determine the likelihood that they were victims of\n\n 8   discrimination. Once it was determined that an individual satisfied the definition of “Offeree”\n\n 9   in the settlement agreement, that individual was offered retroactive seniority.43 Yet all that\n\n10   this shows is that the Government and the City Defendants may have been less careful than\n\n11   they should have been. Although it was clear from the four corners of the settlement\n\n12   agreement and from the testimony that nobody was checking to make sure that the Offerees\n\n13   were actual victims or even likely victims, it was equally clear that the retroactive seniority\n\n14   awards would be individualized, and therefore, in light of Stotts, not affirmative action. Not\n\n\n     43\n       Cote testified:\n     Q: Did you undertake any individualized inquiry to determine whether they’d been victims of\n     recruiting discrimination or testing discrimination?\n     A: No.\n     ...\n     The Court: You never discussed with anybody who was an actual victim at that time.\n     The Witness: No, we never discussed it with each other.\n     The Court: You never discussed it with each other. Okay.\n     The Witness: And I never discussed it with any potential offeree.\n     The Court: Okay.\n     Q: Did the . . . United States . . . in this process ever jointly pursue any individualized inquiry to\n     determine whether each offeree was, in fact, a victim?\n     A: No.\n\n\n\n                                                       71\n\f 1   every race- or gender-conscious employment benefit that goes beyond make-whole relief is\n\n 2   affirmative action; some such benefits, like those at issue here, fall into the impermissible\n\n 3   Stotts category instead.\n\n 4          Finally, the City Defendants’ race- and gender-conscious actions are a poor fit for the\n\n 5   wrongs they seek to redress. True affirmative action, like that undertaken voluntarily by the\n\n 6   employers in Johnson and Weber and ordered by the court in Local 28, has the power to break\n\n 7   down old patterns of discrimination and prevent future discrimination against minorities and\n\n 8   women. But affirmative action also has its costs. Most significantly, it is race- or gender-\n\n 9   conscious, and it puts non-minority and male individuals at a disadvantage.

Make-whole relief,\n\n17   likewise, is a powerful remedy for past wrongs.

But make-whole\n\n\n\n\n                                                      72\n\f 1   relief is not free either. Someone has to pay for it—most often the non-minority and male\n\n 2   employees, as well as the employer.\n\n 3          Because of the costs inherent in both affirmative action and make-whole relief, anyone\n\n 4   attempting to provide either of these forms of relief—whether it be a court imposing a remedy\n\n 5   under § 706(g) after a Title VII violation has been found, or the Government proposing a\n\n 6   settlement to an employer, or an employer acting voluntarily—must be exceptionally careful\n\n 7   to ensure that the employer’s proposed action is properly tailored to achieve whichever of\n\n 8   these two types of remedies for discrimination is sought. That is not to say that one cannot\n\n 9   use affirmative action and make-whole relief at the same time; of course one can. See, e.g.,\n\n10   Local 28, 478 U.S. at 473 n.44 (noting that, along with imposing the affirmative action plan,\n\n11   the district court also gave backpay to specified individual victims of discrimination); cf.\n\n12   Ass’n Against Discrimination in Employment, 647 F.2d at 278 (noting that these “two\n\n13   categories [of relief] may overlap to some extent, although their intended functions differ”).\n\n14   But a court or employer planning to give out a race- or gender-conscious employment benefit,\n\n15   or a Title VII remedy, should always ask first: What is the purpose of what I am doing? (1)\n\n16   Am I trying to give make-whole relief to individual people who I think are victims of past\n\n17   discrimination, (2) am I trying to implement a non-individualized, class-wide affirmative\n\n18   action plan to dismantle prior patterns of discrimination and prevent future discrimination, or\n\n19   (3) am I trying to do both? Only after these questions have been answered can an\n\n20   appropriately tailored plan or plans be put in place. The Government and the City Defendants\n\n21   should have considered these questions before taking action. Instead, according to the\n\n\n\n\n                                                      73\n\f 1   testimony that the district court credited, the Government never explained why it wanted the\n\n 2   Offerees to get retroactive seniority, and the City Defendants never asked.44\n\n 3          The necessity of avoiding Stotts-like “remedies,”—that is, non-remedial,\n\n 4   individualized, race- or sex-conscious employment benefits—is not merely an abstract,\n\n 5   doctrinal matter. It affects real people in tangible ways. In the instant case, Ruben Miranda,\n\n 6   the plaintiff in Miranda, may be the clearest example of how the City Defendants’ remedy\n\n 7   does not fit. He is a Hispanic male. He studied for, took, and passed Exam 5040, which\n\n 8   allegedly discriminated against Hispanics. As a reward for overcoming this hurdle, he was\n\n 9   hired as a Custodian—only to be told, some years later, that other, newly appointed\n\n10   Custodians, a specified group of women, blacks, Hispanics, and Asians, would be put ahead\n\n11   of him in seniority. As a result, he could be laid off before these newcomers would be, and he\n\n12   would—and, as it turns out, did—lose school transfers to them. Thus, a Hispanic Custodian\n\n13   was hampered in attaining his career goals, including a transfer to a larger and higher-paying\n\n14   school, because of a settlement agreement that the Caldero and Arroyo Intervenors insist is an\n\n15   affirmative action plan for, among others, Hispanics.45\n\n\n     44\n        The problematic resemblances between the process that led to the settlement agreement in the\n     instant case and the process that led to the consent decree in Stotts are many. See Stotts, 467\n     U.S. at 588-89 (O’Connor, J., concurring) (“To be sure, in 1980, respondents could have gone to\n     trial and established illegal discrimination in the Department's past hiring practices, identified its\n     specific victims, and possibly obtained retroactive seniority for those individuals. Alternatively,\n     in 1980, in negotiating the consent decree, respondents could have sought the participation of the\n     union, negotiated the identities of the specific victims with the union and employer, and possibly\n     obtained limited forms of retroactive relief. But respondents did none of these things. They chose\n     to avoid the costs and hazards of litigating their claims. They negotiated with the employer\n     without inviting the union's participation. They entered into a consent decree without\n     establishing any specific victim’s identity.” (footnote omitted)).\n     45\n        This is not to say that the retroactive seniority of the Offerees to whom Miranda lost transfers\n     might not be lawful for some reason other than as part of an “affirmative action” plan. If the\n\n                                                      74\n\f 1           For all these reasons, while some or all of the retroactive seniority awards may be\n\n 2   defensible on some other ground, they are not defensible as part of an affirmative action plan.\n\n 3   The City Defendants therefore cannot use the Weber/Johnson defense to the Brennan\n\n 4   Plaintiffs’ § 703(a) prima facie case.\n\n 5   V.      Strong Basis in Evidence\n\n 6           The Brennan Plaintiffs have made out a prima facie case of disparate treatment under\n\n 7   § 703(a) of Title VII, and we have rejected the first defense relied on by the City Defendants,\n\n 8   that of “affirmative action” under Johnson and Weber. We next consider the City\n\n 9   Defendants’ second defense: that the retroactive seniority awards to the Offerees were\n\n10   intended as make-whole relief to victims of the City Defendants’ previous testing and\n\n11   recruiting practices that had a disparate racial and gender impact.\n\n12           We hold that this defense—remedying disparate impact—is governed by Ricci.\n\n13   “[B]efore an employer can engage in intentional discrimination for the asserted purpose of\n\n14   avoiding or remedying an unintentional disparate impact, the employer must have a strong\n\n15   basis in evidence to believe it will be subject to disparate-impact liability if it fails to take the\n\n16   race-conscious, discriminatory action.” 129 S. Ct. at 2677. The City Defendants’ action was\n\n\n\n\n     City Defendants had a strong basis in evidence that they would be liable to people like the\n     Caldero and Arroyo Intervenors in a disparate impact suit, and that in a world without that\n     disparate impact Miranda would likely have been hired after the Offerees and would have lost\n     the transfers to them, then the City Defendants’ actions would be justified as to him. Cf. Ass’n\n     Against Discrimination in Employment, 647 F.2d at 287 (approving, under § 706(g), make-whole\n     competitive seniority to minority firefighters who were discriminatorily denied employment,\n     while four incumbent minority firefighters did not receive retroactive seniority).\n\n                                                        75\n\f 1   race- and gender-conscious, and it was taken for the asserted purpose of remedying an\n\n 2   unintentional disparate impact. It is therefore subject to Ricci.46\n\n 3          Our reading of Ricci is that a strong basis in evidence that an employer will be subject\n\n 4   to disparate-impact liability requires that, at the time it takes the “race-conscious,\n\n 5   discriminatory action,” the employer be faced with both (1) a prima facie case of disparate\n\n 6   impact against itself (or perhaps a strong basis in evidence of a prima facie case), and (2) a\n\n 7   strong basis in evidence either (a) that the employment practice having the disparate impact\n\n 8   was neither job-related nor consistent with business necessity, or (b) that there was an equally\n\n 9   valid, less discriminatory alternative, that the employer had refused to adopt, that would have\n\n10   served the employer’s needs. As detailed in Part V.A, infra, we hold that, under Ricci, a\n\n11   “strong basis in evidence” of non-job-relatedness or of a less discriminatory alternative\n\n12   requires more than speculation, more than a few scattered statements in the record, and more\n\n13   than a mere fear of litigation, but less than the preponderance of the evidence that would be\n\n14   necessary for actual liability. This is what it means when courts say that the employer must\n\n15   have an objectively reasonable fear of disparate-impact liability.\n\n16          The case before us also presents an additional problem not at issue in Ricci. Even if an\n\n17   employer has a strong basis in evidence that it faces liability for disparate impact, it may be\n\n18   unclear to whom the employer might face liability, or, if the disparate-impact case were\n\n19   brought by the Government, who might be entitled to court-ordered relief under § 706(g) and\n\n20   to what extent such individuals would receive relief. In the instant case, it was unclear at the\n\n\n     46\n       We need not and do not decide what standard applies when an employer takes a race- or\n     gender-conscious action to avoid or remedy disparate-treatment liability.

We hold that\n\n4    the strong-basis-in-evidence standard of Ricci applies to these questions too.\n\n5           Thus, the employer must have a strong basis in evidence not only that it will actually\n\n6    be found liable for disparate impact, but also that, at the remedial stage following such a\n\n7    finding of liability, a court might well impose (pursuant to § 706(g)) a make-whole remedy\n\n8    equivalent to or broader than what the employer has done voluntarily.

As with the employer’s fear of\n\n15   disparate-impact liability, the employer’s reconstruction of the past must, that is, be\n\n16   objectively reasonable.\n\n17          A.      What Is a Strong Basis in Evidence?\n\n18          It is not immediately obvious from Ricci what constitutes a “strong basis in evidence”\n\n19   in the Title VII disparate-impact context. The standard is new in this context, and the\n\n20   Supreme Court has not yet had occasion to describe its operations in detail, for in Ricci the\n\n21   court held that the standard had manifestly not been satisfied. See 129 S. Ct. at 2681\n\n22   (“[T]here is no evidence—let alone the required strong basis in evidence—that the tests were\n\n\n\n                                                      77\n\f1    flawed because they were not job-related or because other, equally valid and less\n\n2    discriminatory tests were available to the City.”). Our task, therefore, is to provide, as best we\n\n 3   can, some guidance for the district court in applying the Ricci strong-basis-in-evidence test to\n\n 4   the facts of this case.\n\n 5                   1.        Strong Basis in Evidence of Liability\n\n 6           Some of the general contours of the strong-basis-in-evidence standard are evident\n\n 7   from Ricci. First, the standard is objective, not subjective, and it therefore focuses on the\n\n8    strength of the evidence of liability, not the strength of the employer’s fear of litigation. See\n\n9    id. at 2675 (stating that “[a] mere good-faith fear of disparate-impact liability” is inadequate);\n\n10   id. at 2677 (referring to “an objective, strong basis in evidence”); id. at 2681 (“Fear of\n\n11   litigation alone cannot justify an employer’s reliance on race . . . .”).\n\n12           Second, the strength of the evidence of disparate-impact liability is measured at the\n\n13   time the employer took the race- or gender-based action. In examining the evidence\n\n14   marshaled by New Haven, the Ricci Court considered only what the city knew at the time it\n\n15   made its decision, and not any further information that arose afterwards. See id. at 2678-81.\n\n16   Similarly, the Court generally referred to the absence of a strong basis in evidence in the past\n\n17   tense. E.g., id. at 2681 (“On the record before us, there is no genuine dispute that the City\n\n18   lacked a strong basis in evidence to believe it would face disparate-impact liability if it\n\n19   certified the examination results.”). The rationale underlying Ricci, moreover, confirms that\n\n20   the evidence is to be gauged at the time of the race- or sex-conscious employer action. The\n\n21   strong-basis-in-evidence standard is intended to “strike[] a . . . balance” between the Title VII\n\n\n\n\n                                                       78\n\f 1   provisions concerning disparate treatment and disparate impact, so that employers make the\n\n 2   right decisions in the first place. Id. at 2675.\n\n 3           Thus, Ricci seeks to avoid both creating a legal framework under which “employers\n\n 4   likely would hesitate before taking voluntary action for fear of later being proven wrong in the\n\n 5   course of litigation and then held to account for disparate treatment,” and one under which\n\n 6   employers would undertake “race- [or gender-]based action at the slightest hint of disparate\n\n 7   impact.” See id. at 2674-75. If evidence from after the employer’s race- or gender-based\n\n 8   decision were taken into account, there would be false negatives and false positives. Some\n\n 9   employers might take inappropriate race- or gender-based actions in the hope or expectation\n\n10   that a strong basis in evidence would later emerge; other employers who actually do have a\n\n11   strong basis in evidence might refuse to take voluntary action for fear that later evidence\n\n12   would undermine that basis. Moreover, still other employers would be held liable for\n\n13   disparate treatment or for disparate impact even though based on the evidence of disparate\n\n14   impact then before them, they acted correctly at the time they made their decisions. All such\n\n15   results are inimical to Ricci.47\n\n16           Third, either an actual prima facie case of disparate-impact liability is required, or a\n\n17   strong basis in evidence of a prima facie case is required. Ricci does not say which, as the\n\n18   City of New Haven was faced with an undisputed prima facie case of disparate impact. Id. at\n\n19   2677-78. Nevertheless, because Ricci explicitly rejects the proposition that “an employer in\n\n\n     47\n        It goes without saying, however, that an employer cannot, in order to obtain a desired result,\n     ignore, or intentionally avoid learning, evidence that bears on the likelihood of disparate-impact\n     liability. An employer who did that would be using the “strong basis in evidence” defense as a\n     pretext for intentional discrimination. See Ricci, 129 S. Ct. at 2687-88 (Alito, J., concurring);\n     see also id. at 2679 (majority opinion) (“The City . . . turned a blind eye to evidence that\n\n                                                        79\n\f 1   fact must be in violation of the disparate-impact provision before it can use compliance as a\n\n 2   defense in a disparate-treatment suit,” it seems likely that no more than a strong basis in\n\n 3   evidence that a prima facie case exists would suffice.48 Id. at 2674. If an actual prima facie\n\n 4   case were required, then an employer who used an employment practice that was obviously\n\n 5   not job-related and who was faced with a strong basis in evidence, but not an actual prima\n\n 6   facie case, of disparate impact, “likely would hesitate before taking voluntary action for fear\n\n 7   of later being proven wrong in the course of litigation and then held to account for disparate\n\n 8   treatment.” Id. But we decline to decide this issue here, leaving it to be determined by the\n\n 9   district court in the first instance, if it proves to be necessary to deciding the case.\n\n10           Fourth, because of the objective nature of the strong-basis-in-evidence test and its\n\n11   focus on the likelihood of actual liability, the test requires that the employer have a strong\n\n12   basis in evidence either (1) that its challenged employment procedures are not job-related, or\n\n13   (2) that there was a less discriminatory alternative procedure which the employer refused to\n\n14   adopt. These are, as the Ricci Court explained, the two conditions under which an employer\n\n15   can be liable for disparate impact after a plaintiff has shown a prima facie case of disparate\n\n16   impact. See Ricci, 129 S. Ct. at 2678.49\n\n\n\n     supported the exams’ validity.”).\n     48\n        Regardless of whether it is an actual prima facie case or a strong basis in evidence of a prima\n     facie case that is required, it is clear that this requirement is a necessary condition, and not a\n     sufficient condition, for the Ricci defense. “[A] prima facie case of disparate-impact liability—\n     essentially, a threshold showing of a significant statistical disparity, and nothing more—is far\n     from a strong basis in evidence that the City would have been liable under Title VII had it\n     certified the results.” Ricci, 129 S. Ct. at 2678 (citation omitted).\n     49\n        These theories were codified in Title VII in 1991, see 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)(1)(A), (C).\n     Previously, they had been adopted by the Supreme Court as interpretations of § 703(a)(2) of\n     Title VII.

Two boundaries are clear from the\n\n 3   Ricci Court’s opinion. The evidence of liability certainly must be stronger than the evidence\n\n 4   New Haven presented in Ricci. Summary judgment against the city could not there be\n\n 5   avoided with what was described as “no evidence,” 129 S. Ct. at 2681, or, at most, “a few\n\n 6   stray (and contradictory) statements in the record,” id. at 2680. At the other end, a strong\n\n 7   basis in evidence that an employer will be liable for disparate impact must be less than what is\n\n 8   required to prove a disparate-impact violation (and hence than what is needed to prove non-\n\n 9   job-relatedness or the existence of a less discriminatory alternative).

Id. at 2676.\n\n 8   While in the equal protection context a strong basis in evidence has been described as\n\n 9   “sufficient evidence to justify the conclusion that there has been prior discrimination,”\n\n10   Wygant, 476 U.S. at 277 (plurality opinion), Ricci, instead, explicitly does not require that an\n\n11   employer show that there has been a past disparate-impact violation of Title VII.\n\n12   Additionally, the Equal Protection Clause does not prohibit the government from taking\n\n13   actions which have an unintentional disparate impact, see Washington v. Davis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109469\"><a href=\"/opinion/109469/washington-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">426</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">229</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n14   (1976), and the type of evidence that supports a disparate-impact claim is different from that\n\n15   which would support a disparate-treatment claim.50 Finally, unlike the Equal Protection\n\n\n     50\n        The Brennan Plaintiffs argue that Ricci requires a strong basis in evidence of intentional\n     discrimination, i.e., disparate treatment, when an employer claims that it is attempting to remedy\n     past discrimination rather than avoid a present or future violation. We agree with the\n     Government that the Brennan Plaintiffs’ argument cannot be squared with Ricci. Ricci says that\n     whenever an employer “engage[s] in intentional discrimination for the asserted purpose of\n     avoiding or remedying an unintentional disparate impact, the employer must have a strong basis\n     in evidence to believe it will be subject to disparate-impact liability if it fails to take the race-\n     conscious, discriminatory action.” 129 S. Ct. at 2677 (emphasis added). The Brennan Plaintiffs’\n     position would, instead, upset the Court’s careful balancing in Ricci by prohibiting an employer\n     from taking remedial action to avoid disparate-impact liability when the employer has a strong\n     basis in evidence of disparate impact (but not of disparate treatment). That would be so even if\n     the evidence of disparate impact was so overwhelming that it would only be a matter of time\n     before some plaintiff proved a violation against the employer. And, an employer in that situation\n\n                                                      82\n\f 1   Clause, Title VII has repeatedly been construed so as not to undermine employers’ ability to\n\n 2   undertake “voluntary compliance,” which is “the preferred means of achieving the objectives\n\n 3   of Title VII,” Ricci, 129 S. Ct. at 2674 (quoting Local No. 93, 478 U.S. at 515).\n\n 4           In sum, a strong basis in evidence of disparate-impact liability is an objectively\n\n 5   reasonable basis to fear such liability. It is evaluated at the time an employer takes a race-\n\n 6   conscious action. It relies on real evidence, not just subjective fear or speculation. Because it\n\n 7   focuses on liability rather than mere litigation, it requires both objectively strong evidence of\n\n 8   a prima facie case (or perhaps actual proof of a prima facie case) of disparate impact, and\n\n 9   objectively strong evidence of non-job-relatedness or a less discriminatory alternative.\n\n10                   2.      Strong Basis in Evidence of Necessity\n\n11           Even after an employer has shown a strong basis in evidence that it faces disparate-\n\n12   impact liability, the employer does not have carte blanche to take whatever race- or gender-\n\n13   conscious actions it pleases. Rather, “the employer must have a strong basis in evidence to\n\n14   believe it will be subject to disparate-impact liability if it fails to take the race-conscious [or\n\n15   gender-conscious], discriminatory action.” Id. at 2677 (emphasis added). That is to say,\n\n16   there must be a strong basis in evidence that the race- or gender-conscious action taken by the\n\n17   employer is necessary to avoid disparate-impact liability.\n\n18           This necessity issue was not squarely presented in Ricci, for two reasons. First, there\n\n19   was no strong basis in evidence that New Haven would have faced disparate-impact liability,\n\n20   so it was unnecessary to determine what New Haven was permitted to do to remedy the\n\n\n\n     would be unable to avoid some kind of Title VII liability, no matter what it did: if it remedied the\n     disparate impact, it would be liable for disparate treatment, but if it did nothing, it would be\n     liable for disparate impact. Such a result is directly contrary to Ricci’s whole rationale.\n\n                                                       83\n\f 1   disparate impact. Second, if New Haven had had a strong basis in evidence of disparate-\n\n 2   impact liability, then there would have been little question that refusal to certify the test\n\n 3   results was precisely what was necessary to avoid liability. There was, therefore, no need in\n\n 4   Ricci to undertake the difficult process of determining who might have been a victim of\n\n 5   discrimination and what sort of relief might have been required to make such individuals\n\n 6   whole. Cf. Teamsters, 431 U.S. at 371-72. It seems easier to say what would be necessary to\n\n 7   avoid a disparate-impact violation that is about to occur but has not yet happened, than it is to\n\n 8   say what is necessary to remedy such a violation years after it took place.\n\n 9          We think it makes good sense to require that an employer’s strong basis in evidence\n\n10   extend beyond the existence of disparate-impact liability, to the necessity of the employer’s\n\n11   chosen race- or sex- conscious remedy for that disparate impact. As with the requirement of a\n\n12   strong basis in evidence of liability, a strong basis in evidence of necessity “gives effect to\n\n13   both the disparate-treatment and disparate-impact provisions, allowing violations of one in the\n\n14   name of compliance with the other only in certain, narrow circumstances.” Ricci, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">15</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">   at 2676. In doing so, requiring a strong basis in evidence of necessity avoids extreme\n\n16   positions that would undermine the careful Ricci balancing of disparate treatment and\n\n17   disparate impact under Title VII. If a showing of actual necessity—i.e., a showing that the\n\n18   race- or sex-conscious action’s beneficiaries were actual victims who received make-whole\n\n19   relief—were mandated, employers would likely refuse to settle disparate-impact cases for fear\n\n20   of disparate-treatment liability. See Part V.B, infra; Ricci, 129 S. Ct. at 2674. But if anything\n\n21   less than a strong basis in evidence of necessity were required—for example, if “an\n\n22   employer’s good-faith belief that its actions were necessary to comply with Title VII’s\n\n\n                                                       84\n\f 1   disparate-impact provision” were “enough to justify race-conscious conduct,” then employers\n\n 2   might give out race-conscious benefits “even where there is little if any evidence of disparate-\n\n 3   impact discrimination” against the recipients of those benefits. See id. at 2674-75. We\n\n 4   therefore hold that the strong-basis-in-evidence standard of Ricci applies not only to the\n\n 5   question of disparate-impact liability, but also to the further question of whether the\n\n 6   employer’s race- or gender-conscious action is necessary to remedy that disparate impact.\n\n 7   Here too, the employer’s belief that its action is necessary to remedy disparate impact, i.e.,\n\n 8   that the beneficiaries of the action were victims of disparate impact and the action puts them\n\n 9   roughly where they would have been in the absence of discrimination, must be objectively\n\n10   reasonable in the above defined sense.\n\n11          B.      The Government’s “Actual Violation” Standard\n\n12          The Government and the Brennan Plaintiffs ask us to go beyond the explicit\n\n13   requirements of Ricci and hold—either in all cases or, alternatively, in those cases where an\n\n14   employer’s race- or gender-conscious action may implicate contractual seniority rights—that\n\n15   the employer can be liable even if its actions are supported by a strong basis in evidence that\n\n16   the actions are necessary to avoid or remedy a disparate-impact violation. According to them,\n\n17   a § 703(a) reverse-discrimination plaintiff can win by showing (a) that the employer’s\n\n18   employment practices were not actually job-related and that there was not actually a less\n\n19   discriminatory alternative, or (b) that some or all recipients of race- or gender-conscious relief\n\n20   were not actual victims who received no more than make-whole relief. If the plaintiffs make\n\n21   this showing, they say, then the employer is liable to them for reverse discrimination. We\n\n22   disagree. The positions advocated by the Government and the Brennan Plaintiffs are\n\n\n\n                                                      85\n\f 1   irreconcilable with Ricci and rest on a confusion about the procedural posture of this case.\n\n 2   Additionally, these parties’ focus on contractual seniority rights is inappropriate because the\n\n 3   remedy for an employer’s unilateral and non-court-sanctioned breach of a collective\n\n 4   bargaining agreement is to be sought (and obtained) by the union through the labor grievance\n\n 5   and arbitration process, and not by means of a § 703(a) action brought by individual union\n\n 6   members in federal court. As a result, the Ricci strong-basis-in-evidence standard is not\n\n 7   altered in cases where the plaintiffs allege a breach of contract.\n\n 8                  1.      Ricci Does Not Require a Showing of Actual Liability or Actual\n 9                          Victims\n10\n11          The first, and most significant, problem with the arguments of the Government and the\n\n12   Brennan Plaintiffs is that they ask us to do something that Ricci explicitly tells us not to do:\n\n13          Petitioners . . . suggest that an employer must be in violation of the disparate-impact\n14          provision before it can use compliance as a defense in a disparate-treatment suit. . . .\n15          [T]his is overly simplistic and too restrictive of Title VII’s purpose. The rule\n16          petitioners offer would run counter to what we have recognized as Congress’s intent\n17          that “voluntary compliance” be “the preferred means of achieving the objectives of\n18          Title VII.” Forbidding employers to act unless they know, with certainty, that a\n19          practice violates the disparate-impact provision would bring compliance efforts to a\n20          near standstill. Even in the limited situations when this restricted standard could be\n21          met, employers likely would hesitate before taking voluntary action for fear of later\n22          being proven wrong in the course of litigation and then held to account for disparate\n23          treatment.\n24\n25   Id. at 2674 (quoting Local No. 93, 478 U.S. at 515) (citations omitted). The Brennan\n\n26   Plaintiffs are asking us to give them the opportunity to prove, in the course of litigation, that\n\n27   the City Defendants were wrong when they deemed some Offerees likely victims of disparate-\n\n28   impact discrimination, and to hold the City Defendants liable for disparate treatment if any\n\n29   such error was made. But that is just what the Supreme Court has forbidden. The Brennan\n\n30   Plaintiffs are entitled to put those supporting the City Defendants to their proof that the City\n\n                                                      86\n\f 1   Defendants had a strong basis in evidence that the challenged testing and recruiting practices\n\n 2   were not job-related or that there was a less discriminatory alternative to those practices, and\n\n 3   that the City Defendants’ actions were necessary to avoid the resulting disparate-impact\n\n 4   liability as to particular Offerees—but that is all.51\n\n 5           True, the Brennan Plaintiffs and the Government would put the burden of proof on the\n\n 6   reverse-discrimination plaintiffs, and not on the employer, to show the absence of an actual\n\n 7   Title VII violation against actual victims. But that shift of the burden of proof does nothing to\n\n8    avoid the dangers on which Ricci focused. Employers, acting from an ex ante perspective,\n\n9    would still view themselves as “[f]orbidd[en] . . . to act unless they know, with certainty, that\n\n10   a practice violates the disparate-impact provision.” Id. In order for the strong-basis-in-\n\n11   evidence standard to work the way the Supreme Court seems to have intended it, an employer\n\n12   who does have a strong basis in evidence that a race- or gender-conscious action is necessary\n\n13   to avoid or remedy a disparate-impact violation must be able to rely on its strong basis in\n\n14   evidence when a reverse-discrimination challenge occurs. Otherwise, “employers likely\n\n15   would hesitate before taking voluntary action for fear of later being proven wrong in the\n\n\n     51\n       There are, of course, several avenues by which a disparate treatment plaintiff might defeat an\n     employer’s satisfaction of the strong-basis-in-evidence standard. In some circumstances, for\n     instance, the potential disparate impact challenge to the employer may be so patently meritless\n     that a court could reasonably conclude that the employer could not have had an objectively\n     reasonable fear of liability. In other circumstances, the plaintiff might demonstrate that the\n     employer’s concern about disparate impact liability was pretextual and that the real reason for its\n     discriminatory treatment was an “illegitimate” one, such as “to placate a politically important\n     racial constituency.” Ricci, 129 S. Ct. at 2684 (Alito, J., concurring). But when and how such\n     arguments might prevail under Ricci are issues that we need not address in this case. Here, the\n     Government and the Brennan Plaintiffs ask us to hold that they can rebut the Ricci defense\n     simply by disproving the existence of an actual disparate impact violation. And that position\n     does not square with Ricci, which makes clear that the absence of an actual violation is not,\n     without more, sufficient to defeat a strong-basis-in-evidence showing.\n\n                                                       87\n\f 1   course of litigation and then held to account for disparate treatment.” Id. If employers who\n\n 2   had the required strong basis in evidence that specific Offerees were past victims of disparate\n\n 3   impact could be found liable anyway when the plaintiff shows that there was no actual\n\n 4   disparate-impact violation or that the race- or gender-conscious action benefited people who\n\n 5   were not actual victims (or benefited actual victims beyond the extent of their victimhood), it\n\n 6   would be of little comfort to the employer that the burden of proof rested with the other side.\n\n 7          The Brennan Plaintiffs and the Government also assert, in the alternative, that their\n\n 8   “actual violation” approach applies only in those cases where the employer’s voluntary action\n\n 9   allegedly violates the contractual rights of those employees who are not the beneficiaries of\n\n10   the race- or gender-conscious action. But there is no basis for limiting Ricci in this way.\n\n11   Indeed, the Ricci Court stated, “we adopt the strong-basis-in-evidence standard as a matter of\n\n12   statutory construction to resolve any conflict between the disparate-treatment and disparate-\n\n13   impact provisions of Title VII.” Id. at 2676 (emphasis added). Ricci applies the strong-basis-\n\n14   in-evidence standard to all such conflicts, regardless of whether they involve contractual\n\n15   rights. Significantly, there were contractual rights in Ricci, and the Court never suggested that\n\n16   these would give rise to an exception to its careful balancing of disparate treatment and\n\n17   disparate impact. See id. at 2665 (describing the New Haven firefighters’ CBA and its\n\n18   requirements concerning the promotional examinations, including a specific percentage\n\n19   weighting of the written and oral examinations); id. at 2679 (reviewing the job-relatedness of\n\n20   the percentage weighting under the strong-basis-in-evidence standard, not an actual job-\n\n21   relatedness standard).\n\n22                  2.        The Consent-Decree, Settlement-Approval, and § 706(g) Cases Do Not\n23                            Apply in the § 703(a) Context\n\n                                                     88\n\f 1\n 2          The Government and the Brennan Plaintiffs cite, in support of their position, several\n\n 3   cases addressing the consequences of a court’s entering of a settlement agreement as a consent\n\n 4   decree, a court’s approval of a settlement, or a court’s ordering of a remedy under § 706(g) of\n\n 5   Title VII. If we were to import into § 703(a) the standards applicable in those cases, then the\n\n 6   City Defendants could, indeed, be liable for disparate treatment even if they had demonstrated\n\n 7   that they had the strong basis in evidence required by Ricci. But those cases, while they have\n\n 8   varying degrees of relevance, do not control the case before us. In the instant case, the City\n\n 9   Defendants unilaterally modified their employees’ seniority dates while the magistrate judge’s\n\n10   approval of the settlement was on appeal to this Court. No court had ordered the City\n\n11   Defendants to do this, nor had all appeals of the magistrate judge’s decision been exhausted.\n\n12   And the district court’s decision, subsequent to our appeal, not to enter as a consent decree the\n\n13   disputed paragraphs of the settlement agreement—which, by its terms, had by then expired—\n\n14   has not been appealed and would be moot in any event. See supra Part II. As a result,\n\n15   whatever standard applies in a case in which a court is ordering a remedy after a violation has\n\n16   been proven, or in which a court is deciding whether to approve a settlement or to enter it as a\n\n17   consent decree, is not germane to this case which does not present any of those situations.\n\n18   Here, the only question remaining before us is whether the employer’s unilateral race- and\n\n19   gender-conscious action taken for the purported purpose of remedying disparate impact\n\n20   violates § 703(a). And that question is governed by Ricci.52\n\n\n     52\n       The Government also argues that our mandate in NYC Board II requires a showing that the\n     Offerees were actual victims of discrimination. In NYC Board II, we ordered that the Brennan\n     Plaintiffs “be accorded discovery and other rights with regard to their claim that any impairment\n     by the Agreement of their interests . . . in their seniority rights as Custodians and Custodian\n\n                                                     89\n\f 1          The Government first relies on United States v.

The Government says that\n     if we do not require a showing of actual victimhood, such discovery would have been “a\n     meaningless exercise.” This argument, too, is based on confusion about the case’s procedural\n     posture. At the time of NYC Board II, the settlement agreement had not yet expired, the Brennan\n     and Miranda § 703(a) suits had not yet been filed, and the question we expected the district court\n     to address on remand was whether to approve the settlement and enter it as a consent decree.\n     Now, the settlement agreement has expired and there is no longer any issue over whether the\n     disputed paragraphs should be entered as a consent decree. The purpose of the discovery\n     mentioned in NYC Board II was for the district court to make a fully informed decision on\n     whether to enter the consent decree. At the time, we were not anticipating a not-yet-filed §\n     703(a) suit and announcing a standard for it in advance. In any event, even if our reference to\n     discovery had been for the purpose of such an as yet non-existent § 703(a) suit, it would still not\n     be “meaningless,” because the evidence to be discovered under the strong-basis-in-evidence\n     standard and under the actual-liability-to-actual-victims standard would be largely the same.\n     53\n        In Grant v.

The principle that a consent decree cannot dispose of the\n\n 2   claims of a party that withholds its consent, therefore, has no application here.\n\n 3          Kirkland involved this Court’s review of a district court’s decision, in a Title VII\n\n 4   disparate-impact case brought by private plaintiffs, to enter a class action settlement pursuant\n\n 5   to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e). See Kirkland, 711 F.2d at 1121. The settlement agreement called for\n\n 6   adjustments to the eligibility lists derived from the allegedly discriminatory civil service\n\n 7   examination. We affirmed the district court’s judgment, and we distinguished the Fifth\n\n 8   Circuit’s decision in City of Miami on the ground that the non-minority intervenors in\n\n 9   Kirkland had no contractual rights that the settlement would alter. Id. at 1126-31. According\n\n10   to the Government, we must permit the Brennan Plaintiffs to show that the disputed tests and\n\n11   recruiting practices in the case before us are not job-related, because here, the Government\n\n12   says, the Brennan Plaintiffs’ contractual rights will be impaired.\n\n13          The problem with this contention and its reliance on City of Hialeah and Kirkland is\n\n14   that, unlike some consent decrees or court-approved class-action settlements, a court’s\n\n15   holding of no more than that a private settlement agreement or an employer’s unilateral action\n\n16   does not violate § 703(a) does nothing to impair the contractual rights of third parties.\n\n17   Consider a simple example: an employee is fired by her employer. She sues the employer on\n\n18   two theories: (1) the employer violated § 703(a) by firing her because she is female; and (2)\n\n19   the employer breached her employment contract. If a court rejects theory (1), the employee\n\n20   nevertheless remains free to pursue theory (2). Her contractual rights, and any other legal\n\n21   rights she may have against her employer, remain unimpaired. Moreover, it is well settled\n\n\n\n     The case before us does not present that issue, for the district court’s decision not to enter the\n\n                                                      91\n\f 1   that no voluntary settlement—whether entered as a consent decree, approved under Rule\n\n 2   23(e), or agreed to in private—can dispose of the claims of a non-consenting third party.

United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109665\"><a href=\"/opinion/109665/teamsters-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">431</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">324</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 362-76 (1977). In\n\n19   Teamsters, the Supreme Court held:\n\n20           The proof of the pattern or practice supports an inference that any particular\n21           employment decision, during the period in which the discriminatory policy was in\n22           force, was made in pursuit of that policy. The Government need only show that an\n23           alleged individual discriminatee unsuccessfully applied for a job and therefore was a\n\n     settlement agreement as a consent decree has not been appealed.\n\n                                                        92\n\f1           potential victim of the proved discrimination. . . . [T]he burden then rests on the\n2           employer to demonstrate that the individual applicant was denied an employment\n3           opportunity for lawful reasons.\n4\n5    Id. at 362 (footnote omitted). As for nonapplicants,\n\n 6          A nonapplicant must show that he was a potential victim of unlawful discrimination.\n 7          Because he is necessarily claiming that he was deterred from applying for the job by\n 8          the employer’s discriminatory practices, his is the not always easy burden of proving\n 9          that he would have applied for the job had it not been for those practices. When this\n10          burden is met, the nonapplicant is in a position analogous to that of an applicant and\n11          is entitled to the presumption discussed [above].\n12\n13   Id. at 367-68 (citation omitted).\n\n14          Once again, the Government misperceives the procedural posture of the instant case.\n\n15   Teamsters applies when a court is ordering a remedy under § 706(g) of Title VII. But “the\n\n16   question of individual relief [under § 706(g)] does not arise until it has been proved that the\n\n17   employer has followed an employment policy of unlawful discrimination.” Id. at 361. In\n\n18   Teamsters and other § 706(g) cases, a § 703(a) violation had been proven and the question\n\n19   was what remedy the court should order. The case before us in its present posture is not about\n\n20   judicially ordered remedies at all. It is about voluntary employer action and its relation to §\n\n21   703(a). The only question we face is whether the City Defendants have violated § 703(a) by\n\n22   engaging in intentional reverse discrimination against the Brennan Plaintiffs. A § 706(g) case\n\n23   like Teamsters does not speak to that question. That is especially so because the Supreme\n\n24   Court has held that employers acting voluntarily can do more than a court could order them to\n\n25   do under § 706(g). See Johnson, 480 U.S. at 630 n.8. But if we were to apply Teamsters\n\n26   here, we would be telling employers precisely that they cannot give individual relief to\n\n27   employees except under the circumstances in which a court could order such relief under §\n\n28   706(g). Significantly, Ricci itself underscores the crucial distinction between voluntary\n\n                                                      93\n\f 1   employer action and court orders under § 706(g). As Ricci states, § 703(a) “is not so\n\n 2   restrictive that it allows employers to act only when there is a provable, actual [disparate-\n\n 3   impact] violation,” 129 S. Ct. at 2676, while an actual violation does have to be proven before\n\n 4   a court can impose a remedy under § 706(g). See Teamsters, 431 U.S. at 361.\n\n5              In distinguishing Teamsters from the case before us, we do not mean to suggest that its\n\n 6   discussion of victims is not relevant to the issues before us; quite the contrary. Teamsters’s\n\n 7   analysis of how district courts applying § 706(g) should determine who is an actual victim has\n\n 8   to be instructive for employers who are attempting unilaterally to remedy their own alleged\n\n 9   disparate-impact violations. It inevitably informs what constitutes a strong basis in evidence\n\n10   that particular parties were actual victims. For, like a district court applying § 706(g), an\n\n11   employer “will have to make a substantial number of individual determinations in deciding\n\n12   which of the minority employees were actual victims of the company’s discriminatory\n\n13   practices. After the victims have been identified, the [employer] must, as nearly as possible,\n\n14   recreate the conditions and relationships that would have been had there been no unlawful\n\n15   discrimination.” Id. at 371-72 (quotation marks omitted); see Part VI.C, infra. The\n\n16   employer’s determinations of these matters must be supported by a strong basis in evidence\n\n17   under Ricci, or else the employer’s race- or gender-conscious remedies will give rise to\n\n18   liability under § 703(a). But that does not mean that § 703(a) should be confused with §\n\n19   706(g), or that the district court should use the Teamsters burden-shifting framework rather\n\n20   than Ricci to determine whether the employer is liable to the reverse-discrimination\n\n21   plaintiffs.54\n\n\n     54\n          For a discussion of the relevance of Teamsters for what remedy is appropriate, see Part IX,\n\n                                                       94\n\f 1                  3.     The Brennan Plaintiffs Have Another Remedy for Any Breach of\n 2                         Contract by the City Defendants\n 3\n 4          The Brennan Plaintiffs, joined by the Government, further assert that, if we do not\n\n 5   hold that the contractual seniority rights contained in the Collective Bargaining Agreement\n\n 6   trigger an actual-violation-against-actual-victims standard, then “even though a consent\n\n 7   decree cannot be entered, those whose contract rights are diminished have no remedy that can\n\n 8   either prevent the unapproved settlement contract from being implemented or provide\n\n 9   damages to those injured.” Brennan Br. at 54. If the Brennan Plaintiffs’ assertion were true,\n\n10   it might well give us pause. But the problem with this argument is that “those whose contract\n\n11   rights are diminished” do have another remedy for any breach of contract. That remedy is the\n\n12   CBA’s grievance and arbitration process. Instead of using that remedy, the Brennan Plaintiffs\n\n13   seek to bring a contract claim with the wrong plaintiffs in the wrong forum. Claims for the\n\n14   breach of a CBA should be brought by the union before an arbitrator as provided in the CBA,\n\n15   not by individual union members in federal court.\n\n16          Whatever the outcome of this § 703(a) case, it is clear under long-established Supreme\n\n17   Court precedent that the Brennan Plaintiffs, through Local 891, are not barred from attacking\n\n18   the City Defendants’ actions in a contract suit based on the collective bargaining agreement.\n\n19   In W.R.

The Union\n\n16   counterclaimed to compel arbitration, while the EEOC asked, among other things, for a\n\n17   declaratory judgment that the conciliation agreement prevailed over the CBA. While cross-\n\n18   motions for summary judgment were pending, W.R. Grace laid off some male employees in\n\n19   violation of their contractual seniority rights. The district court granted summary judgment to\n\n20   the EEOC and W.R. Grace, holding that the conciliation agreement was paramount. The\n\n21   Union appealed, and while that appeal was pending W.R. Grace laid off some more male\n\n\n\n     Title VII and what the appropriate remedy is for such a violation . . . .”).\n\n                                                      96\n\f 1   employees pursuant to the conciliation agreement. Then the Court of Appeals reversed the\n\n 2   district court’s decision, and held that W.R. Grace had to arbitrate the grievances. An\n\n 3   arbitrator then awarded backpay to some of the male employees, finding that the contract had\n\n 4   been breached and that backpay was the appropriate remedy. W.R. Grace again sued under §\n\n 5   301, this time hoping to have the arbitration award set aside.\n\n 6          When this § 301 suit reached the Supreme Court, W.R. Grace and the United States\n\n 7   argued that the arbitration award, and the collective bargaining agreement, could not be\n\n 8   enforced because they were contrary to public policy. The Court disagreed:\n\n 9          Given the Company’s desire to reduce its workforce, it is undeniable that the\n10          Company was faced with a dilemma: it could follow the conciliation agreement as\n11          mandated by the District Court and risk liability under the collective bargaining\n12          agreement, or it could follow the bargaining agreement and risk both a contempt\n13          citation and Title VII liability. The dilemma, however, was of the Company’s own\n14          making. The company committed itself voluntarily to two conflicting contractual\n15          obligations. When the Union attempted to enforce its contractual rights, the\n16          Company sought a judicial declaration of its respective obligations under the\n17          contracts. During the course of this litigation, before the legal rights were finally\n18          determined, the Company again laid off employees and dishonored its contract with\n19          the Union. For these acts, the Company incurred liability for breach of contract. In\n20          effect, [the arbitrator] interpreted the collective bargaining agreement to allocate to\n21          the Company the losses caused by the Company’s decision to follow the District\n22          Court order that proved to be erroneous.\n23\n24   Id. at 767 (footnotes omitted). Because it was the employer’s fault that it had previously\n\n25   discriminated against women and then entered into two conflicting contracts, it was the\n\n26   employer that should bear the loss.\n\n27          W.R. Grace also argued that enforcing the arbitration award was contrary to the policy\n\n28   of voluntary compliance with Title VII. Id. at 770-71 (citing Alexander v.

In this case, although the Company and the Commisison agreed to nullify the\n 3          collective bargaining agreement’s seniority provisions, the conciliation process did\n 4          not include the Union. Absent a judicial determination, the Commission, not to\n 5          mention the Company, cannot alter the collective bargaining agreement without the\n 6          Union’s consent. Permitting such a result would undermine the federal labor policy\n 7          that parties to a collective bargaining agreement must have reasonable assurance that\n 8          their contract will be honored. Although the ability to abrogate unilaterally the\n 9          provisions of a collective bargaining agreement might encourage an employer to\n10          conciliate with the Commission, the employer’s added incentive to conciliate would\n11          be paid for with the union’s contractual rights.\n12\n13   Id. at 771 (citations omitted; emphasis added).\n\n14          The City Defendants’ voluntary implementation of the settlement agreement in our\n\n15   case, like the conciliation agreement in W.R. Grace, cannot preclude enforcement of existing\n\n16   contractual rights contained in a collective bargaining agreement. If any of the Brennan\n\n17   Plaintiffs were to file a grievance with Local 891, and if Local 891 were to pursue that claim\n\n18   to arbitration, a court could not disturb any arbitration award on public policy grounds or\n\n19   because of any conflict with the settlement agreement.\n\n20          Grievance and arbitration is not simply an alternate remedy for any breach of the\n\n21   collective bargaining agreement; it is the proper remedy. The Supreme Court has rejected\n\n22   constructions of Title VII provisions that “would run counter to the national labor policy.”\n\n23   Am. Tobacco Co. v.

The Brennan Plaintiffs’ position\n\n24   entails precisely such a construction.

It would be inappropriate for\n\n13   us to permit “individual employees,” contrary to these state-law policies borrowed from\n\n14   federal law, “to circumvent the grievance procedure in favor of other remedies.” Ambach,\n\n15   517 N.E.2d at 512.57\n\n\n     57\n        In rejecting the Brennan Plaintiffs’ and the Government’s claim that the Brennan Plaintiffs’\n     contractual rights entitle them to replace the Ricci strong-basis-in-evidence standard with an\n     actual-liability-to-actual-victims standard, we do not mean to suggest that we look with favor on\n     Title VII settlements which do not include unions that represent incumbent employees who hold\n     contractual rights that might conflict with such settlements. A recurring problem in such Title\n     VII settlements is that the employer may readily agree to modify terms of employment, such as\n     competitive seniority, in ways that impose costs on incumbent employees. Not surprisingly, in\n     such situations, the employer and the Government often leave the incumbent employees’ unions\n     out of the settlement negotiations. See, e.g., W.R. Grace, 461 U.S. at 770 n.14 (“[I]f the\n     Company had done nothing at all, the economic loss from failing to reduce the workforce would\n     have fallen on the Company. By an independent and voluntary act, the Company shifted this\n     loss to its male employees and thereby caused the injury remedied by the [arbitration] award.”\n     (citation omitted)); Stotts, 467 U.S. at 588 & n.3 (O’Connor, J., concurring) (“[I]n negotiating\n\n                                                    100\n\f 1          To summarize, in the case before us, we are neither asked to pass upon the propriety of\n\n 2   entering the disputed portions of the 1999 settlement agreement into a consent decree, nor to\n\n 3   enforce an agreement involving the incumbent employees’ union. We are confronted only\n\n 4   with a § 703(a) suit attacking a voluntary settlement between the Government and an\n\n 5   employer. When the Government and an employer agree, in such a private settlement and\n\n 6   without the consent of the union representing incumbent employees, to take away those\n\n 7   employees’ contractual rights for the benefit of alleged victims of discrimination, § 703(a) is\n\n 8   not the correct way for the incumbent employees to seek vindication of their rights under the\n\n 9   contract. The proper way is through the union grievance and arbitration process. As a result,\n\n10   the Brennan Plaintiffs’ asserted contractual rights do not alter the generally applicable Ricci\n\n11   standard, and their § 703(a) claim is subject to the Ricci strong-basis-in-evidence defense just\n\n12   like any other such claim.58\n\n\n\n     the consent decree, respondents could have sought the participation of the union, negotiated the\n     identities of the specific victims with the union and employer, and possibly obtained limited\n     forms of retroactive relief. But respondents did none of these things. . . . They negotiated with\n     the employer without inviting the union’s participation.”). In the case before us, the Government\n     initially included Local 891 in the 1995 pre-lawsuit settlement negotiations, but then cut the\n     union out. When settlement negotiations resumed after the lawsuit had been filed, the union was\n     not represented. J.A. at 292-93. Instead of leaving the union out of the picture, it is better for\n     the employer and the Government to include the incumbent employees’ union in any\n     negotiations with respect to settlement provisions that may conflict with the union’s contractual\n     rights.\n              And there is every reason for the union to participate on behalf of its members. Not the\n     least of these is that, if the case goes to litigation, the union runs the risk that the Government\n     will prove a Title VII violation and then the court, acting pursuant to Teamsters and Franks,\n     could issue a § 706(g) remedial order which infringes on the CBA more, and compensates\n     incumbent employees less, than what the union could have achieved in a negotiated settlement.\n     Moreover, this is so regardless of whether there is any allegation that the union itself has violated\n     Title VII, for “an award of retroactive seniority is appropriate even if there is no finding that the\n     union has also illegally discriminated.” Zipes v.

Application of the Strong-Basis-in-Evidence Standard\n\n 2          Under the strong-basis-in-evidence standard, the City Defendants need to show three\n\n 3   things in order to avail themselves of the defense the Supreme Court recognized in Ricci: (1)\n\n 4   that they were faced with a prima facie (or, potentially, a strong basis in evidence of a prima\n\n 5   facie case) of disparate impact;59 (2) a strong basis in evidence that either the challenged\n\n 6   employment practice was not job-related or there was a less discriminatory alternative to the\n\n 7   practice; and (3) a strong basis in evidence that each Offeree was a victim of the challenged\n\n 8   practice and received no more than make-whole relief. This showing needs to be made\n\n 9   separately for each of the challenged employment practices—testing and recruiting.60\n\n10          The district court—understandably, as it decided this case before Ricci—erred in its\n\n11   Title VII analysis in several respects. First, the district court applied the “affirmative action”\n\n12   framework of Johnson and Weber, and therefore required for Title VII purposes only a\n\n13   “manifest imbalance” instead of a prima facie case of disparate impact. Second, the district\n\n14   court failed to require of the City Defendants a strong basis in evidence—or, for that matter,\n\n15   any evidence at all—either of non-job-relatedness or a less discriminatory alternative. Third,\n\n16   the district court held that no showing concerning victimhood was required to justify the\n\n17   awards of transfer and TCA seniority, but that a showing of actual victimhood was required\n\n\n\n     Brennan Plaintiffs’ § 703(a) claims. The Brennan Plaintiffs might attempt to argue, for instance,\n     that the CBA helps to discredit the City Defendants’ professed objectively reasonable belief that\n     they faced likely liability for disparate impact. But to say that a CBA can inform a court’s\n     application of the strong-basis-in-evidence standard is not to say that a CBA triggers application\n     of an altogether different standard. And for the reasons stated above, we cannot accept this latter\n     claim.\n     59\n        As discussed earlier, we leave open the question of whether Ricci requires only a strong basis\n     in evidence of a prima facie case. See supra Part V.A.1.\n     60\n        There is, of course, no requirement of a strong basis in evidence that each Offeree was a\n\n                                                      102\n\f 1   for layoff seniority. For all of these aspects of competitive seniority, the court should, instead,\n\n 2   have required a strong basis in evidence of victimhood.\n\n 3           Accordingly, and as further described in the discussion below, we remand for the\n\n 4   district court to apply this correct standard in the first instance.\n\n 5           A.      Prima Facie Case\n\n 6                   1.      Testing Discrimination\n\n 7           Before the district court, it was undisputed that the City Defendants were faced with a\n\n 8   prima facie case of disparate-impact testing discrimination for all three of the challenged\n\n 9   exams, except that the Brennan Plaintiffs questioned whether there was a prima facie case that\n\n10   Exam 8206 had a disparate impact on Hispanics. See NYC Board III, 448 F. Supp. 2d at 425-\n\n11   27. After an “evidentiary hearing,” the district court found that such a prima facie case had\n\n12   been made out. See NYC Board IV, 487 F. Supp. 2d at 224-32. The Brennan Plaintiffs have\n\n13   not appealed that determination. Accordingly, there is no reason for the district court to\n\n14   revisit it on remand.\n\n15                   2.      Recruiting Discrimination\n\n16           The district court held that the City Defendants were not faced with a prima facie case\n\n17   of disparate-impact recruiting discrimination, reasoning that although the Government had\n\n18   shown a disparity between the expected and actual numbers of female and minority test-\n\n19   takers, there was no “evidence connecting the . . . disparity to the Board’s recruiting practices,\n\n20   a causal link not established by the statistical evidence presented in support of the recruiting\n\n21   claim.” NYC Board IV, 487 F. Supp. 2d at 234; see also NYC Board III, 448 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n\n\n     victim of both challenged practices.\n\n                                                       103\n\f 1   446 n.57. The question of whether the district court erred in this respect is complicated. The\n\n 2   Government, for example, wishes to argue to that court that it did. Because the court below\n\n 3   reached its decision on this issue before Ricci, and because Ricci raises a question regarding\n\n 4   the proper standard to apply, we think it appropriate to remand this issue for further\n\n5    consideration in the light of the still-to-be-determined Ricci standard. We note in particular\n\n 6   that even if there was not an actual prima facie case of disparate impact recruiting liability,\n\n 7   Ricci might—but does not necessarily—permit a showing that the City Defendants had a\n\n 8   strong basis in evidence of such a prima facie case. See supra Part V.A.1. Whether such a\n\n 9   strong basis in evidence would suffice remains an open question. But the district court need\n\n10   not reach or decide this question if it finds that the City Defendants lacked even a strong basis\n\n11   in evidence of a prima facie case of recruiting discrimination.\n\n12           At the same time, we reject the Brennan Plaintiffs’ contention that the City Defendants’\n\n13   allegedly discriminatory recruiting practices—word-of-mouth recruiting, and limited\n\n14   advertising—are not prohibited by Title VII even if they cause a disparate impact. Like the other\n\n15   courts that have addressed similar arguments, we are unpersuaded. As the Sixth Circuit has\n\n16   stated, the “assertion that disparate impact analysis is inapplicable to . . . recruiting practices is\n\n17   plainly incorrect. The very purpose of Title VII’s disparate impact theory is to eradicate barriers\n\n18   which discriminate on the basis of race, gender, religion, and other protected classifications.”\n\n19   United States v.

Their argument is, essentially, that § 703(a)(2), which makes it illegal for an employer\n\n10   “to limit, segregate, or classify his employees or applicants for employment in any way which\n\n11   would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities,” does not refer to\n\n12   recruiting, because people who don’t even apply for a job because of recruiting discrimination\n\n13   are not “applicants for employment.” But, as the Government says, the Supreme Court has all\n\n14   but held that “applicants” includes potential applicants in the § 703(a)(2) disparate-impact\n\n15   context. See Wards Cove, 490 U.S. at 651 & n.7 (suggesting that a prima facie case of disparate\n\n16   impact would be made out “if it were found that [a] dearth of qualified nonwhite applicants was\n\n17   due to practices on [an employer’s] part which—expressly or implicitly—deterred minority\n\n18   group members from applying for . . . positions.”); see also Dothard v.

Job-Related and Less Discriminatory Alternative\n\n 4          The next component of the Ricci strong-basis-in-evidence standard requires that the\n\n 5   employer show, for each disputed employment practice, a strong basis in evidence either that\n\n 6   the practice was not job-related or that there was a less discriminatory alternative to that\n\n 7   practice. See Ricci, 129 S. Ct. at 2678. The district court considered evidence concerning\n\n 8   job-relatedness and less discriminatory alternatives neither for the challenged exams, nor for\n\n 9   the recruiting practices. See NYC Board III, 448 F. Supp. 2d at 426 n.37. On remand, the\n\n10   district court should determine whether the City Defendants had a strong basis in evidence\n\n\n\n     employer's actual practices—by his consistent discriminatory treatment of actual applicants, by\n     the manner in which he publicizes vacancies, his recruitment techniques, his responses to casual\n     or tentative inquiries, and even by the racial or ethnic composition of that part of his work force\n     from which he has discriminatorily excluded members of minority groups.” (emphasis added));\n     Berkman v.

All these can be dismissed summarily. For example, they assert that\n     interpreting § 703(a)(2) to cover recruiting discrimination renders § 704(b) surplusage. This\n     argument, too, is meritless. Section 704(b) prohibits employers from publishing “any notice or\n     advertisement relating to employment by such an employer . . . indicating any preference,\n     limitation, specification, or discrimination, based on race, color, religion, sex, or national\n     origin.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(b). But, as the Government points out, § 704(b) deals with facially\n     discriminatory notices, while disparate impact is about facially neutral practices.\n        The Brennan Plaintiffs additionally contend that employers cannot be held liable for failure to\n     do something, as against doing something. This is another distinction without a difference.\n     Although better advertising, or additional word-of-mouth recruiting targeted at minorities and\n     women, might cure a racial and gender disparity among job applicants, the problematic\n     employment practice is really the combination of what the employer is doing (telling white\n     males about the job opportunity) and what the employer is not doing (not telling others).\n     Besides, any employment practice can be described in a positive or negative way. For example,\n     the high-school diploma requirement in Griggs could be described as “hiring only individuals\n\n                                                     106\n\f1   that each of the three challenged exams was not job-related or had a less discriminatory\n\n2   alternative.63 See supra Part V.A.1. Whether the district court needs to make such a\n\n\n\n    with high-school diplomas” or as “failing to consider applicants without high-school diplomas.”\n    63\n       We note that two of the three disputed exams—and, therefore, the limited advertising and\n    word-of-mouth recruiting for those two exams—occurred before the effective date of the Civil\n    Rights Act of 1991, Pub. L. No. 102-166, 106 Stat. 1071. The Supreme Court has held that an\n    unrelated section of that Act does not have retroactive effect, but the Court stated that “courts\n    should evaluate each provision of the Act in light of ordinary judicial principles concerning the\n    application of new rules to . . . preenactment conduct.” Landgraf v.

To the extent that the portion of Section 105 of the 1991 Act, which\n    superseded Wards Cove and reassigned the burden of persuasion on job-relatedness to the\n    defendant, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)(1)(A)(i), is not retroactive, the pre-1991 employment\n    practices may be subject to Wards Cove. Under Wards Cove, while “the employer carries the\n    burden of producing evidence of a business justification for his employment practice[,] [t]he\n    burden of persuasion . . . remains with the disparate-impact plaintiff.” 490 U.S. at 659.

In addition, the form of the less-discriminatory-alternative\n    analysis for the two pre-1991 exams and the associated recruiting practices also turns on the\n    retroactivity of Section 105. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)(1)(C) (stating that a disparate-impact\n    plaintiff’s demonstration of a less discriminatory alternative “shall be in accordance with the law\n    as it existed on June 4, 1989”—the day before Wards Cove came down—“with respect to the\n    concept of ‘alternative employment practice’”).\n             Moreover, under Ricci, the district court might be required to consider the effect of any\n    legal, rather than factual, uncertainty with respect to the retroactive application of the 1991\n    amendments. If, that is, an employer takes a race- or sex-conscious action because of a strong\n    basis in evidence that it will be liable for disparate impact under an interpretation of the\n    disparate-impact provisions of Title VII that later is held to be erroneous, must the employer then\n    be liable for disparate treatment? If not, then how strongly supported must the erroneous legal\n    conclusion have been at the time of the employer’s race- or sex-conscious action, in order for the\n    employer to avoid liability?

Because the district court may\n    well find that a strong basis in evidence of job-relatedness or of a less discriminatory alternative\n    exists (or does not exist) for the relevant practices regardless of whether the court uses the pre-\n\n                                                    107\n\f 1   determination with respect to the two challenged recruiting practices depends on whether the\n\n 2   recruiting defense survives the initial, prima facie case/strong-basis-in-evidence of prima\n\n 3   facie case, step of the Ricci inquiry.\n\n 4          C.      Necessity and Make-Whole Relief\n\n 5          Next, the district court must determine whether the City Defendants had a strong basis\n\n 6   in evidence that their race- and gender-conscious actions were necessary to avoid disparate-\n\n 7   impact liability. See Ricci, 129 S. Ct. at 2677; supra Part V.A.2. As we have explained, that\n\n 8   means the City Defendants must have had, at the time they took their race- and gender-\n\n 9   conscious actions, a strong basis in evidence that each Offeree was an actual victim of\n\n10   discrimination who received no more than make-whole relief, i.e., a strong basis in evidence\n\n11   that, in such a disparate impact suit, he or she would have been entitled to receive, by a court\n\n12   order pursuant to § 706(g) of Title VII, the race- or sex-conscious relief that he or she\n\n13   received from the City Defendants through the voluntary settlement agreement.\n\n14          The district court’s decision as to job-relatedness and less discriminatory alternatives\n\n15   will affect this step in several important ways. First, if there was no strong basis in evidence\n\n16   that any of the challenged testing and recruiting practices were either not job-related or that\n\n17   there was a less discriminatory alternative to them, then the district court need not make any\n\n18   determinations as to particular Offerees.64 The Brennan Plaintiffs would then have\n\n\n\n     1991 or post-1991 standard, we deem it inappropriate at this time to address further these\n     difficult retroactivity questions.\n     64\n        As we noted in the previous section, see supra Part VI.B, the district court would not need to\n     reach the issue of whether the City Defendants had a strong basis in evidence that the challenged\n     recruitment practices were not job-related or had less discriminatory alternatives, if it were to\n     conclude that the recruiting claims do not satisfy Ricci’s requirement of a prima facie case/strong\n     basis in evidence of a prima facie case. See supra Part V.A.1. Such a finding, of course, would\n\n                                                     108\n\f 1   successfully shown that implementation of the settlement agreement as a whole made the City\n\n 2   Defendants liable for reverse discrimination, under § 703(a) of Title VII. That is so because\n\n 3   an employer cannot have a strong basis in evidence that anyone is a victim of discrimination if\n\n 4   there is no strong basis in evidence that discrimination has occurred.\n\n 5          Second, and for the same reason, if the City Defendants can show a strong basis in\n\n 6   evidence of non-job-relatedness or of a less discriminatory alternative as to one or more of the\n\n 7   challenged employment practices, but not as to others, then the City Defendants have violated\n\n 8   § 703(a) to the extent they have given relief to Offerees for whom there was no strong basis in\n\n 9   evidence that such Offerees were victims of the practice or practices for which there was a\n\n10   strong basis in evidence of non-job-relatedness or of a less discriminatory alternative. For\n\n11   example, if the City Defendants had a strong basis in evidence that their tests were not job-\n\n12   related, but they lacked a strong basis in evidence that their recruiting practices were neither\n\n13   job-related nor that there existed a less discriminatory alternative to these recruiting practices\n\n14   (or could not make out a prima facie/strong-basis-in-evidence of a prima facie showing of\n\n15   recruiting discrimination), then the City Defendants would, for each Offeree, have to show a\n\n16   strong basis in evidence that that Offeree was a victim of testing discrimination. Essentially,\n\n17   the City Defendants would be required to show a strong basis in evidence that the Offeree\n\n18   took the test, or that the Offeree could successfully have “undertake[n] [his or her] difficult\n\n19   task of proving that [he or she] should be treated as [an] applicant[] and therefore [is]\n\n\n\n\n     also foreclose the need to conduct individualized “necessity” determinations with respect to the\n     alleged victims of recruiting discrimination.\n\n                                                      109\n\f 1   presumptively entitled to relief accordingly” under § 706(g). See Teamsters, 431 U.S. at\n\n 2   364.65\n\n 3            Third, if the district court does find a strong basis in evidence of disparate-impact\n\n 4   liability, the appropriate extent of relief the City Defendants could have given each Offeree\n\n 5   without violating § 703(a) turns on which theory—non-job-relatedness or a less\n\n 6   discriminatory alternative—supports the district court’s determination. If the Government\n\n 7   successfully shows on remand, as it hopes to, that there was a strong basis in evidence that the\n\n 8   provisional hiring process was a less discriminatory alternative to a particular hiring practice,\n\n 9   then it follows that any Offeree, as to whom there is a strong basis in evidence that the\n\n10   Offeree was a victim of that particular discriminatory practice, properly received retroactive\n\n11   seniority to his or her provisional hiring date. For if an Offeree was hired under the\n\n12   provisional hiring process and that process was a less discriminatory alternative, then there is\n\n13   a strong basis in evidence that that Offeree would have received a permanent appointment if\n\n14   the City Defendants had used the less discriminatory alternative instead.\n\n15            Alternatively, if there was a strong basis in evidence that an employment practice that\n\n16   had a disparate impact discriminated only because it was not job-related, it becomes much\n\n\n     65\n        As the Supreme Court has explained in the § 706(g) context: “A nonapplicant must show that\n     he was a potential victim of unlawful discrimination. Because he is necessarily claiming that he\n     was deterred from applying for the job by the employer’s discriminatory practices, his is the not\n     always easy burden of proving that he would have applied for the job had it not been for those\n     practices.” Teamsters, 431 U.S. at 367-68. For that reason, if there were a strong basis in\n     evidence of testing-discrimination liability but not of recruiting-discrimination liability, then the\n     City Defendants could show the required strong basis in evidence as to an individual who did not\n     take a challenged test if it proffered evidence that the individual would have taken the test if only\n     she had not been dissuaded by either (1) the racial or gender disparities in the results of previous\n     tests, or (2) a racial or gender imbalance in the underlying workforce that is the result of one or\n     more of the challenged tests.\n\n                                                      110\n\f 1   more difficult for the district court to determine how much retroactive seniority the City\n\n 2   Defendants could properly give each Offeree without violating § 703(a). Suppose, for\n\n 3   example, that the challenged tests were discriminatory; it is nigh-impossible to tell exactly\n\n 4   when (if at all) an Offeree would have been hired if the test had not been discriminatory. In\n\n 5   that hypothetical world, some Offerees might have passed with flying colors and would then\n\n 6   have been the first to be hired from the eligibility lists; others might have found themselves in\n\n 7   the middle of the eligibility lists; and still others might still have failed, or might have passed\n\n 8   with such a low score that they would have been placed near the bottom of the eligibility lists,\n\n 9   where they probably would never have been hired. And, those who passed a test might have\n\n10   been rejected at the interview stage (which is not here being challenged as discriminatory),\n\n11   once or twice, thus having their employment delayed; or three times, resulting in removal\n\n12   from the eligibility list. Finally, they might have failed the “experience papers” stage, and\n\n13   then they might or might not have succeeded in having that decision overturned on\n\n14   administrative appeal. To say the least, “[t]he task remaining for the District Court on remand\n\n15   will not be a simple one.” Teamsters, 431 U.S. at 371. “Th[e] process of recreating the past\n\n16   will necessarily involve a degree of approximation and imprecision.” Id. at 372.\n\n17          Recreating the past is difficult in the § 706(g) context addressed in Teamsters. It is\n\n18   even more difficult when an employer undertakes voluntary remedial action that is challenged\n\n19   under Ricci and § 703(a). In the § 706(g) context, a court necessarily has already found an\n\n20   actual violation of Title VII. See id. at 361-62. All the court has then to do is to determine\n\n21   who is an actual victim of that discrimination, and “‘recreate the conditions and relationships\n\n22   that would have been had there been no’ unlawful discrimination,” id. at 372 (quoting Franks,\n\n\n                                                      111\n\f 1   424 U.S. at 769). That process is not easy, because there may be more victims of\n\n 2   discrimination than there are vacancies that were discriminatorily refused to them, and their\n\n 3   interests must be balanced against “the legitimate expectations of other employees innocent of\n\n 4   any wrongdoing.” Id. But when an employer undertakes voluntary action to remedy an\n\n 5   unintentional disparate impact, the employer has not proven, and does not need to prove, that\n\n 6   it has actually violated Title VII. Ricci, 129 S. Ct. at 2674. Instead, the employer must have a\n\n 7   strong basis in evidence that it would be liable in a disparate-impact suit unless it took the\n\n 8   race- or gender-conscious action. See id. at 2675-76. Once an employer has a strong basis in\n\n 9   evidence that it faces disparate-impact liability, the employer must also undertake a recreation\n\n10   of the past that is supported by a strong basis in evidence. Where, as here, incumbent\n\n11   employees subsequently bring a § 703(a) challenge to the employer’s race- or gender-\n\n12   conscious action, the court must determine whether there really was a strong basis in evidence\n\n13   to support the employer’s recreation of the past.66 That is a very difficult project indeed. It is\n\n14   one that only a district court can undertake, and whose difficulty should serve to caution any\n\n15   appellate court attempting to review the district court’s conclusions.\n\n16                                                ****\n\n17          The district court, deciding this case before Ricci, asked whether each Offeree was an\n\n18   actual victim, instead of whether the City Defendants had a strong basis in evidence that each\n\n\n     66\n        Moreover, if the district court finds that the employer’s recreation of the past is not supported\n     by a strong basis in evidence, then the employer is liable to the incumbent employees under §\n     703(a), and the court must impose a remedy under § 706(g), i.e., it must perform yet another\n     recreation of the past, this time directly governed by Teamsters, in which the court must recreate\n     the conditions and relationships that would have existed if the employer had not violated §\n     703(a) against the incumbent employee plaintiffs. And in doing so the court must balance the\n     interests of those incumbent employee plaintiffs against those of the innocent beneficiaries of the\n\n                                                     112\n\f 1   Offeree was an actual victim. As a result, we must vacate the judgment and remand so that\n\n 2   the district court can apply the correct standard. In addition, several of the district court’s\n\n 3   findings require comment.\n\n 4           First, as discussed above, the district court did not make any individualized\n\n 5   determinations as to alleged victims of recruiting discrimination, because it concluded that\n\n 6   there was no prima facie case of recruiting discrimination. Because we have remanded on the\n\n 7   question of whether, under Ricci, there was a prima facie case/strong-basis-in-evidence of a\n\n 8   prima facie case of recruiting discrimination, individualized determinations pertaining to\n\n 9   recruiting-discrimination victimhood will be required to the extent that the district court finds\n\n10   (a) that the recruiting defense survives Ricci’s prima facie case/strong-basis-in-evidence of\n\n11   prima facie case requirement; and (b) that there was a strong basis in evidence that the\n\n12   challenged recruiting practices either were not job-related or had a less discriminatory\n\n13   alternative.\n\n14           Second, the district court twice said that the Brennan Plaintiffs “acknowledge that\n\n15   seven of the [Offerees] were victims of discrimination under the testing claims and received\n\n16   appropriate make-whole relief: Lloyd Bailey, Joseph Christie, Belfield Lashley, Gilbert\n\n17   Rivera, Peter Robertin, Felix Torres and Mayra Zephrini (Cintron).” NYC Board III, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">448</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">18</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">   Supp. 2d at 419; see also NYC Board V, 556 F.

See infra Part IX.\n\n                                                      113\n\f 1   the district court should either explain the basis for its assertion, deem the matter forfeited, or\n\n 2   make individualized strong-basis determinations for each of these individuals.67\n\n 3          Third, the district court did not address whether the ten Arroyo Intervenors were\n\n 4   victims of testing discrimination. The district court had held, as to them and other alleged\n\n 5   victims of testing discrimination, that retroactive seniority was limited to actual victims for\n\n 6   layoff purposes only. The parties then resolved the Arroyo Intervenors’ layoff seniority dates\n\n 7   by stipulation. That stipulation, however, provides that “[s]hould a higher court conclude that\n\n 8   ‘actual victim’ status is relevant to the lawfulness of any of the seniority benefits that these\n\n 9   beneficiaries received under the Agreement for the purpose of obtaining transfers or\n\n10   temporary care assignments, each shall have the right to a hearing on ‘actual victim’ status in\n\n11   [the district court] on remand.” Additionally, “[i]n the event of any remand by a higher court\n\n\n     67\n        It would have been better if the parties had pointed this issue out to the district court in one of\n     the several motions for reconsideration they filed after the district court first made the assertion\n     in its 2006 opinion in NYC Board III. If a district court appears unintentionally to have misstated\n     the record, there is no reason to wait until appeal to have the issue corrected. That is especially\n     so because the district court knows, far better than we, whether it had any basis in the record for\n     its assertion. The district court in this case understandably wanted to get to final judgment as\n     quickly as possible, but we remind the parties that any unintentional factual misstatements left\n     uncorrected may well result in more delay than would have occurred if the district court were\n     given an opportunity to correct itself in the first place. Indeed, the parties arguably forfeited any\n     appeal of the district court’s alleged factual misstatement by failing to raise a reconsideration\n     motion. See Smith ex rel. Smith v.

The district court found that\n\n14   (1) Cordero and Marshall, each of whom failed an exam, were actual victims and the\n\n15   retroactive seniority they received was lawful, NYC Board V, 556 F. Supp. 2d at 209-10; (2)\n\n16   Sean Rivera, who was, against the odds, hired after years of delay because his barely passing\n\n17   score put him at the very bottom of the eligibility list where it was unlikely he would ever be\n\n18   hired, was not an actual victim because his “hypothetical performance [on a\n\n19   nondiscriminatory exam] is purely speculative,” as is “what such a score would have yielded\n\n20   in terms of his hire date,” id. at 210; and (3) the other five Offerees would not have been hired\n\n\n     68\n        The Brennan Plaintiffs argue that one Offeree, Andrew Clement, was inappropriately stricken\n     from this stipulation. Because the stipulation will no longer apply, we need not address that\n     contention.\n\n                                                      115\n\f 1   even under a nondiscriminatory exam because they were not qualified, id. at 210-11. We\n\n 2   vacate this portion of the judgment because the district court should have asked whether the\n\n 3   City Defendants had a strong basis in evidence that these individuals were victims, not\n\n 4   whether the individuals actually were victims.69\n\n 5          We note, moreover, that some of the district court’s findings in this portion of its\n\n 6   judgment are problematic in two other ways. There is a tension between the finding that\n\n 7   Rivera’s hypothetical performance on a nondiscriminatory exam was speculative, while\n\n 8   Cordero’s and Marshall’s were not. Anyone who received a lower score than he or she would\n\n 9   have received on a nondiscriminatory test is a likely victim of discrimination, whether the\n\n10   lower score resulted in outright failure or, instead, delay in being hired.

NYC Board V, 556 F. Supp. 2d at 209. Although under Ricci the § 703(a)\n\n\n     69\n        It is possible to imagine a scenario in which, at the time of the settlement’s implementation,\n     the City Defendants lacked a strong basis in evidence that a particular Offeree was a victim of\n     discrimination, but at present the Offeree is able to show that she was in fact a victim of\n     discrimination. In that situation, for the reasons discussed in Part V.A.1, supra, the City\n     Defendants would remain liable under § 703(a), as an employer’s satisfaction of the Ricci\n     strong-basis-in-evidence test is measured at the time of the employer’s race- or gender-conscious\n     action. But it would likely be inappropriate for a district court to impose a remedy stripping an\n\n                                                     116\n\f 1   reverse-discrimination defendant bears the burden at trial of showing a strong basis in\n\n 2   evidence that its race- or gender-conscious actions were necessary to avoid disparate-impact\n\n 3   liability, see 129 S.

California. Under Teamsters, as this Court has interpreted it,\n\n10          [e]ach class member must show that he or she was among those adversely affected\n11          by the challenged policy or practice. If this showing is made, the class member is\n12          entitled to individual relief unless the employer in turn can establish by a\n13          preponderance of the evidence that a legitimate non-discriminatory reason existed for\n14          the particular adverse action.\n15\n16   Robinson, 267 F.3d at 161-62.70 Viewing Teamsters through the strong-basis-in-evidence\n\n17   lens of Ricci, an employer, before it takes a race- or gender-conscious action to avoid or\n\n18   remedy a disparate-impact violation, must have a strong basis in evidence that (1) each\n\n19   beneficiary of the race- or gender-conscious action could “show that he or she was among\n\n20   those adversely affected” by the disparate-impact practice, and (2) the employer would be\n\n\n\n\n     actual-victim Offeree of retroactive seniority that, in fact, made him or her whole.\n     70\n        The Brennan Plaintiffs argue that Teamsters only applies to disparate treatment and not to\n     disparate impact. That position is contrary to our precedents. Teamsters itself was a disparate-\n     treatment case, but we have held that in disparate-impact cases cases “an inquiry similar to the\n     remedial stage of a pattern-or-practice disparate treatment claim,” i.e., a Teamsters inquiry, “is\n     generally required.” Robinson, 267 F.3d at 161.\n\n                                                      117\n\f 1   unable to “establish by preponderance of the evidence that a legitimate non-discriminatory\n\n 2   reason existed for the particular adverse action.”71\n\n 3          Fifth, the district court’s 2006 opinion addressed the Brennan Plaintiffs’ claim that\n\n 4   five Offerees “are not members of a protected class because each lacks the requisite cultural\n\n 5   or linguistic ties to qualify as Hispanic.” NYC Board III, 448 F. Supp. 2d at 422. The district\n\n 6   court, relying on the EEOC’s definition of national-origin discrimination, see 29 C.F.R. §\n\n 7   1606.1,72 held that one Offeree, Ciro Dellaporte, was not Hispanic because he was “plainly . .\n\n 8   . of Italian ancestry.” NYC Board III, 448 F. Supp. 2d at 422. (The City Defendants, who had\n\n 9   erroneously listed him as Hispanic in their records, did not thereafter defend his appointment.)\n\n10   The other four, the district court held, were Hispanic: Kevin LaFaye’s father and the mother\n\n11   of Nicholas and Anthony Pantelides were born in Puerto Rico, and Steven Lopez’s\n\n12   grandfather was born in Mexico. Id. The Brennan Plaintiffs appeal the district court’s\n\n13   decision, but only as to the Pantelides brothers. We agree with the district court that the City\n\n14   Defendants properly treated the Pantelides brothers as Hispanic, in light of their ancestors’\n\n\n     71\n        The Government and the Brennan Plaintiffs debate at length whether several Offerees would\n     have passed the “experience papers” portion of the hiring process. All the City Defendants (and\n     the Government or any intervenors who support them on this issue) need to show is that they had\n     a strong basis in evidence that each Offeree was qualified. The City Defendants’ post hoc\n     review of applicant qualifications, performed before the 1999 settlement for the intended purpose\n     of litigating against the Government, is not dispositive of this question, although it certainly is\n     evidence that must be taken into account. Even for an Offeree who was deemed unqualified by\n     the post hoc review, the City Defendants could use other evidence to demonstrate a strong basis\n     in evidence that the Offeree was qualified. For example, the City Defendants could show that\n     similarly experienced individuals, who went through the actual “experience papers” process and\n     were initially deemed unqualified, prevailed on administrative appeal.\n     72\n        “The Commission defines national origin discrimination broadly as including, but not limited\n     to, the denial of equal employment opportunity because of an individual's, or his or her\n     ancestor's, place of origin; or because an individual has the physical, cultural or linguistic\n     characteristics of a national origin group.” 29 C.F.R. § 1606.1. This definition applies to both\n\n                                                     118\n\f 1   national origin. See Espinoza v. Farah Mfg.

The district court therefore need not revisit this\n\n 4   issue when it applies the strong-basis-in-evidence standard on remand.\n\n 5          With these considerations in mind, we remand for the district court to take up the\n\n 6   difficult task of determining whether the “hypothetical nondiscriminatory past” that the City\n\n 7   Defendants attempted to recreate, when they implemented the settlement agreement, was\n\n 8   supported by a strong basis in evidence.73\n\n 9   VII.   Equal Protection\n\n10          The parties also ask us to review the district court’s decisions under the Equal\n\n11   Protection Clause. We think, however, that the better course is to follow one “of the cardinal\n\n12   rules governing the federal courts: . . . never to anticipate a question of constitutional law in\n\n13   advance of the necessity of deciding it.” Brockett v.

That is especially so here because the case presents\n\n15   difficult and far-reaching issues concerning the application of the Equal Protection Clause to\n\n16   remedies for past disparate impact. We decline to decide those issues in this case until the\n\n17   district court has addressed the Title VII issues under the proper standard—i.e., Ricci rather\n\n18   than Johnson and Weber. Only if this court, upon reviewing a district court decision that has\n\n19   applied the correct Title VII standard, determines that some part of the City Defendants’\n\n20   voluntary implementation of the disputed paragraphs of the settlement agreement did not\n\n\n\n     “disparate treatment and adverse impact.” Id.\n     73\n        As already noted, the district court need not perform that task if the Brennan Plaintiffs attain\n     victory at the job-relatedness and less-discriminatory alternative stage for all the challenged\n\n                                                      119\n\f 1   violate § 703(a) of Title VII, would it be necessary or prudent for us to address the\n\n 2   constitutional issues.\n\n 3          The Supreme Court has cautioned that, although “[a] fundamental and longstanding\n\n 4   principle of judicial restraint requires that courts avoid reaching constitutional questions in\n\n 5   advance of the necessity of deciding them,” in some cases it is “inadvisable to vacate and\n\n 6   remand” for the court below to address a statutory issue where “considerations of judicial\n\n 7   economy” strongly favor addressing the constitutional issue on the merits. Lyng v. Nw. Indian\n\n 8   Cemetery Protective Ass’n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112037\"><a href=\"/opinion/112037/lyng-v-northwest-indian-cemetery-protective-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">485</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">439</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 445-47 (1988). The principle of judicial restraint\n\n 9   would not be “vindicated by sending [a] case on what would almost certainly be a brief round\n\n10   trip to the court[] below.” Id. at 447. Here, however, the trip to the district court will likely\n\n11   be—perhaps to the able district judge’s chagrin—anything but brief. Because the district\n\n12   court did not permit the Brennan Plaintiffs to make any showing as to job-relatedness of, or a\n\n13   less discriminatory alternative to, the challenged employment practices, a factual record will\n\n14   have to be developed. Then the district court will have to decide whether that factual record\n\n15   shows that the City Defendants had a strong basis in evidence. To the extent that the district\n\n16   court finds a strong basis in evidence that the City Defendants faced disparate-impact liability,\n\n17   the court will have to determine whether the City Defendants also had a strong basis in\n\n18   evidence that giving each Offeree retroactive seniority was necessary to remedy any\n\n19   disparate-impact Title VII violation. And then, the district court will have to impose a remedy\n\n20   for whatever reverse-discrimination § 703(a) violations it finds. See Part IX, infra.\n\n\n\n\n     employment practices.\n\n                                                      120\n\f 1           Even more important, there is at least some possibility that the constitutional issues\n\n 2   will not come back to us.74 If the district court finds that the disputed portions of the\n\n 3   settlement agreement violated § 703(a) in their entirety, i.e., the City Defendants failed to\n\n 4   satisfy the strong-basis-in-evidence standard of Ricci with respect to any of their employment\n\n 5   practices, then neither we nor the district court will need to address whether the City\n\n 6   Defendants also violated the Equal Protection Clause. In cases like this one, where our\n\n 7   addressing a constitutional issue could dispose of the case, but there is at least one non-trivial\n\n 8   non-constitutional issue which could also dispose of the case after a remand to the district\n\n 9   court, the better practice is to remand for the district court to address the latter first.

There are at least\n\n17   two such issues in the case before us. First, the parties call upon us to decide a question the\n\n18   Supreme Court explicitly left open in Ricci: whether “meeting the [Title VII] strong-basis-in-\n\n19   evidence standard would satisfy the Equal Protection Clause in a future case.” 129 S.

Second, the Brennan Plaintiffs argue here, as they did below, that no showing of\n\n\n     74\n       We emphasize that we do not intend to suggest that the district court ought to reach any\n     particular result on remand.

Rather,\n\n2    they say, only remedying pervasive and egregious intentional disparate treatment is a\n\n3    “compelling interest” for purposes of strict scrutiny75 (or an “important interest” for purposes\n\n 4   of heightened scrutiny).76 See Ricci, 129 S.

Class Certification\n\n11          The Caldero Intervenors argue that the district court should not have certified the\n\n12   Brennan class. They contend that the district court abused its discretion in certifying, and\n\n13   violated due process, by failing to give any party other than the Brennan Plaintiffs an opportunity\n\n14   to brief the issue of class certification.

Remedies\n\n 2            If a violation of § 703(a) or the Equal Protection Clause is found, the district court will\n\n 3   have to decide upon a remedy.

As a remedy for recruiting discrimination, the awards of retroactive seniority to\n14                  female Offerees for purposes of layoff protection violate[] Title VII.\n15               3. As a remedy for recruiting discrimination, the awards of seniority—both\n16                  retroactive and based on permanent-appointment date—to black, Hispanic and\n17                  Asian male Offerrees [sic] for purposes of transfers, TCAs and layoff protection\n18                  violate[] the Fourteenth Amendment.\n19               4. Ciro Dellaporte is not a member of a protected class and, therefore, not entitled to\n20                  any relief.\n21               5. Except as stated above, the relief provided by the Agreement comports with Title\n22                  VII and the Fourteenth Amendment.\n23\n24   Attached to the judgment were two schedules listing the “proper” competitive seniority dates\n\n25   for the Offerees.\n\n26            We do not decide the proper scope of the remedy here. We review a Title VII\n\n27   remedial order issued under § 706(g) for abuse of discretion. “Our function is not to exercise\n\n28   our own discretion, but to determine, in light of the purposes of the Act, whether the district\n\n\n\n     modify or decertify the class, nor are the Caldero Intervenors or any other parties prohibited\n     from asking the district court to exercise that authority.

And, since the scope of\n\n 7   the City Defendants’ liability is yet to be determined, it would be premature for us to say\n\n 8   exactly what the scope of the district court’s equitable discretion might be.79 As for the\n\n 9   Brennan Plaintiffs’ damage claims, those too depend on the district court’s determination of\n\n10   the scope of liability. The damage claims are premised on specific Brennan Plaintiffs’ having\n\n11   lost transfers to specific Offerees. That is why the district court dismissed those claims; it had\n\n12   held that “[t]he transfers at issue . . . comported with Title VII and the Fourteenth\n\n13   Amendment.” Before any damage award would be appropriate, the district court must first\n\n14   determine, under the standards we have set forth in this opinion, whether the City Defendants\n\n15   violated the law when they gave the transfers to those particular Offerees.80\n\n\n\n     Wright, Miller, & Kane, Federal Practice & Procedure § 1785.4 (3d ed. 2005).\n     79\n        As the Brennan Plaintiffs note, the question of an equitable remedy for reverse discrimination\n     relating to certain types of retroactive seniority given to certain Offerees may be moot. For\n     example, any Offeree who has been “broadbanded”—that is, elevated from Custodian to CE\n     without an exam under the relatively recent change in the City Defendants’ rules that permits\n     such promotions—appears to lose his or her transfer and TCA seniority upon promotion. There\n     would be no need to impose a remedy modifying such an Offeree’s transfer or TCA seniority\n     date. Additionally, as this litigation drags on, some individuals may cease to be employed by the\n     City Defendants, rendering any adjustments to their seniority dates moot as well. We do not\n     doubt that the district court, when it chooses a remedy, will first determine which retroactive\n     seniority awards still present a live controversy.\n     80\n        That having been said, we do think that the district court’s declaratory judgment overstepped\n     in one particular respect: the district court permanently stripped all layoff seniority—not just\n\n                                                     125\n\f 1          It will, of course, be impossible for the district court to fashion a remedy that makes\n\n 2   everyone happy, much less whole. To the extent that the City Defendants’ employment\n\n 3   practices were discriminatory, there were too many victims to count. A few, the Offerees, got\n\n 4   permanent appointments and retroactive seniority. Others, like Ruben Miranda, did not. And\n\n 5   there may well be an untold number of non-Offeree individuals who failed the challenged\n\n 6   tests or were prevented from learning of the Custodian and CE openings because of recruiting\n\n 7   discrimination. Had the Government successfully pursued its case to judgment instead of\n\n 8   settling, this would probably have been one of those cases which would have “require[d]\n\n 9   class-wide, rather than individualized, assessments of monetary relief,” because\n\n10   “identification of the individuals entitled to relief would drag the court into a quagmire of\n\n11   hypothetical judgments and result in mere guesswork.” Robinson, 267 F.3d at 161 n.6\n\n12   (quotation marks omitted). Instead, the Government and the City Defendants entered into a\n\n13   settlement that attempted to identify victims of discrimination anyway—without consulting\n\n14   Local 891. To the extent that this settlement violated Title VII or the Equal Protection\n\n15   Clause, the Brennan Plaintiffs were victims of reverse discrimination, as were the other\n\n16   members of the Brennan class, of whom there are hundreds.81 At this point, nobody can really\n\n\n\n     retroactive seniority—from those individuals as to whom the district court found (1) that they\n     were not victims of discrimination, and (2) that the benefits they received from the settlement\n     agreement violated Title VII and/or the Equal Protection Clause. In order to obviate the need for\n     a subsequent appeal, we deem it appropriate to advise the district court that such a remedy, if\n     reimposed on remand, would constitute an abuse of discretion. To the extent that the district\n     court, as an equitable remedy for reverse discrimination against the Brennan Plaintiffs, takes\n     away any Offeree’s seniority, that Offeree’s seniority date should remain his or her permanent\n     appointment date under the settlement agreement.\n     81\n        As the district court noted in finding that the numerosity requirement for class certification\n     was satisfied, at least 77 candidates hired from the Exam 5040 eligibility list, 23 candidates hired\n     from the Exam 8206 eligibility list, and 122 candidates hired from the Exam 1074 eligibility list\n\n                                                     126\n\f 1   know who would have been employed as a Custodian or CE, and at what level of seniority, in\n\n 2   a hypothetical world in which there had been no unlawful discrimination.\n\n 3          There can be no doubt that the Brennan Plaintiffs, and many of the members of the\n\n 4   certified Brennan class, were harmed by the permanent appointments of the Offerees and by\n\n 5   the seniority stemming from those appointments. And to the extent the settlement benefited\n\n 6   some Offerees unlawfully, redress, in the form of adjustments in seniority, appears justified.\n\n 7   But, once the district court has reduced each “unlawful” Offeree’s seniority to his or her\n\n 8   permanent-appointment date, the value of further modifications to seniority dates begins to\n\n 9   dissipate quickly. Such additional modifications place a heavy cost upon innocent Offerees,\n\n10   while conferring possibly speculative benefits upon diffuse victims of reverse\n\n11   discrimination.82\n\n12          In any event, we need not and do not decide exactly what remedy the district court\n\n13   should impose (or to what extent the district court should find the liability on which any\n\n14   remedy would necessarily be premised). It is for the district court to decide what, if any, is\n\n15   the scope of the City Defendants’ liability, and then to exercise appropriate equitable\n\n\n\n     were injured. NYC Board III, 448 F. Supp. 2d at 445. That was a conservative estimate. It was\n     based only on median-hiring-date seniority, not the even greater provisional-appointment-date\n     seniority some Offerees received. It was also based only on the grants of retroactive seniority to\n     Offerees who had taken a challenged exam; the district court later expanded the Brennan class to\n     include “all custodial employees whose seniority for purposes of transfers, TCAs and layoff\n     protection has been adversely affected by the grant of seniority benefits to the Offerees.” NYC\n     Board IV, 487 F. Supp. 2d at 235-36.\n     82\n        We note that the City Defendants, who—unlike the Offerees and the members of the Brennan\n     class—are alleged perpetrators of unlawful reverse discrimination, have borne very little of the\n     cost of that discrimination. It may behoove the district court to consider whether an additional\n     award of equitable monetary relief, as described in Robinson, is an appropriate way to achieve\n     the three important goals of shifting these costs away from the Brennan Plaintiffs, of shifting the\n     costs to the alleged discriminator rather than to innocent Offerees, and of bringing this litigation,\n\n                                                     127\n\f 1   discretion in imposing a remedy. In doing so, the district court should explain why it\n\n 2   exercised its discretion in the way that it did, so that a reviewing court can determine whether\n\n 3   that discretion has been abused.83\n\n 4   X.     Conclusion\n\n 5          Because the district court in its Title VII analysis reached results inconsistent with the\n\n 6   Supreme Court’s subsequent decision in Ricci, its judgment must be vacated and remanded—\n\n 7   with two exceptions. First, we affirm the district court’s grant of class certification. Second,\n\n 8   paragraph 4 of the district court’s declaratory judgment, which states, “Ciro Dellaporte is not\n\n 9   a member of a protected class and, therefore, not entitled to any relief,” has not been appealed\n\n10   and therefore must stand.84 The judgment of the district court is therefore AFFIRMED in part\n\n11   and VACATED in part, and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with\n\n12   this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n     at last, to a close.\n     83\n        For example, and without casting doubt on its choice, it would have been helpful to us if the\n     district court had explained why it chose a declaratory judgment rather than the injunction\n     requested by the Brennan Plaintiffs.\n     84\n        The Brennan Plaintiffs argue that other portions of the judgment also must stand because they\n     pertain to the seniority dates of individual Offerees who did not appeal and as to whom the\n     Government does not seek different seniority dates from those specified in the schedules\n     attached to the declaratory judgment. We decline to carve up the district court’s declaratory\n     judgment in such a manner. With the exception of paragraph 4 of the declaratory judgment\n     (which we have affirmed), each paragraph of that judgment refers to a category of individuals,\n     one or more of whom has appealed.\n\n                                                     128\n\fREENA RAGGI, Circuit Judge, concurring in the judgment:\n\n       I join the majority in concluding (1) that the district court judgment can be affirmed\n\ninsofar as it (a) granted class certification to the Brennan Intervenors, and (b) declared Ciro\n\nDellaporte not a member of a protected class entitled to relief under the challenged\n\nsettlement, but (2) that the judgment must be vacated in all other respects and remanded for\n\nfurther consideration in light of Ricci v.

In reaching this\n\nconclusion, I agree with the majority that Ricci is not limited, as the Caldero and Arroyo\n\nIntervenors urge, to its particular facts.

With due respect, however, I cannot join\n\nin the majority opinion because I think its extended discussion of Title VII jurisprudence\n\ngenerally, and the scope of the Ricci rule in particular, is not required to our decision to\n\nremand and yields an abundance of dicta that could confuse future consideration of\n\njudgments actually based on Ricci.

Ricci Requires No Gloss from This Court To Permit Application by the\n              District Court on Remand\n\n       In Ricci, a case originating in this circuit, the Supreme Court addressed the same\n\nquestion raised here: “whether the purpose to avoid disparate-impact liability excuses what\n\notherwise would be prohibited disparate-treatment discrimination.” Ricci v. DeStefano, 129\n\nS. Ct. at 2674. Acknowledging that “statutes and principles” seemed to “point in different\n\ndirections,” the Court set itself the “task . . . to provide guidance to employers and courts for\n\nsituations when these two prohibitions could be in conflict absent a rule to reconcile them.”\n\nId. Toward that end, the Court pronounced the following rule:\n\n       [B]efore an employer can engage in intentional discrimination for the asserted\n       purpose of avoiding or remedying an unintentional disparate impact, the\n       employer must have a strong basis in evidence to believe it will be subject to\n       disparate-impact liability if it fails to take the race-conscious, discriminatory\n       action.\n\nId. at 2677. The Court explained that the requisite strong basis had to be “objective,” id.,\n\nand could not be satisfied by “a few stray (and contradictory) statements in the record,” id.\n\nat 2680. Further, it applied the strong-basis-in-evidence requirement to all three prongs of\n\ndisparate-treatment analysis set forth in 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)(1)(A), see id. at 2677-79\n\n(concluding that (1) “City was faced with a prima facie case of disparate-impact liability,”\n\nbut (2) the evidence raised “no genuine dispute that the [discarded] examinations were job-\n\n\n                                               2\n\frelated,” and (3) respondents “lacked a strong basis in evidence of an equally valid, less\n\ndiscriminatory testing alternative that the City, by certifying the examination results, would\n\nnecessarily have refused to adopt”). The Supreme Court apparently did not think that\n\ndistrict courts required any further guidance to begin applying the stated rule: “Our holding\n\ntoday clarifies how Title VII applies to resolve competing expectations under the disparate-\n\ntreatment and disparate-impact provisions.” Id. at 2681. Thus, I would simply remand this\n\ncase for further consideration in light of Ricci without attempting to anticipate or resolve\n\nquestions that are not now before us and that may never arise in this case. Case-by-case\n\nreview of judgments actually based on Ricci will afford sufficient opportunity to discuss\n\napplication of the strong-basis-in-evidence rule in particular circumstances.\n\n       B.     Concerns Raised by The Majority’s Discussion\n\n       The majority’s efforts to define the parameters of the Ricci rule in advance of\n\napplication by the district court raise a number of concerns in my mind. The following are\n\nmerely illustrative.\n\n       First, in order to engage in a detailed discussion of Title VII law generally and Ricci\n\nin particular in light of the evidence in this case, the majority finds itself obliged at the\n\noutset to decide the standard applicable to review of the factual record. While on an appeal\n\nfrom an award of summary judgment, we usually review the facts in the light most favorable\n\nto the non-moving party, see, e.g., Wilson v. C.I.A., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2448\"><a href=\"/opinion/2448/wilson-v-cia/\"><span class=\"volume\">586</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">171</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 183 (2d Cir. 2009), the\n\nmajority elects to employ the “clear error” standard applicable after trial, see, e .g., Skoros\n\nv. City of New York, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"793244\"><a href=\"/opinion/793244/andrea-skoros-individually-and-next-friend-of-nicholas-tine-a-minor-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">437</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 12 (2d Cir. 2006). This choice is grounded more in record\n\n                                              3\n\fconfusion, however, than in law. As the majority explains, while the district court disposed\n\nof “the vast majority of the relevant issues . . . upon cross-motions for summary judgment\n\n. . ., in what appears to be a confusion about the case’s procedural posture,” some issues\n\nwere resolved after “‘evidentiary hearings.’” Ante at [45]. Unable to discern “why the\n\ndistrict court held these hearings, rather than a trial,”1 the majority simply decides “it best\n\nto treat the hearings as separate bench trials on separate issues,” and to review the findings\n\nfor “clear error.” Id. at [45-46]. This course of action has consequences for the ensuing\n\ndiscussion as the difference between review in the light most favorable to the non-movant\n\nand clear error review can be significant: the former standard favors the loser; the latter\n\nfavors the winner. There is no need to resolve this review standard to reach a remand\n\ndecision in this case. Indeed, there is good reason not to do so. On remand, the factual\n\nrecord may change as the parties seek better to address Ricci’s requirements. Moreover, the\n\ndistrict court can then clarify what, if any, “factfinding” informs a new final judgment.\n\n       Second, the majority concludes that the Brennan Intervenors’ claim of disparate-\n\ntreatment discrimination is properly reviewed according to the three-step analytical\n\nframework outlined in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">792</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1973). The\n\nextensive discussion of McDonnell Douglas that accompanies this determination is not only\n\nunnecessary to our decision to vacate and remand, but it also risks confusing the question\n\nof discriminatory intent with the question of whether even actions taken with such intent can\n\n\n       1\n         Motions for preliminary injunction as well as summary judgment were pending\nbefore the district court; it is not clear which prompted the hearings.\n\n                                              4\n\fbe excused by a purpose to avoid disparate-impact liability. McDonnell Douglas analysis\n\nwas devised to answer the first question but, as a number of the judges of this court have\n\nrecognized, it is not well-suited to answer the second. See Ricci v. DeStefano, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1189835\"><a href=\"/opinion/1189835/ricci-v-destefano/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">88</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n99-100 (2d Cir. 2008) (Cabranes, J., with Jacobs, C.J., Raggi, Wesley, Hall, and Livingston,\n\nJJ.) (dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc) (suggesting that issue should be resolved\n\nby mixed-motive analysis); accord id. at 89 (Calabresi, J.) (concurring in denial of rehearing\n\nen banc) (agreeing that mixed-motive analysis should have been used but for parties’ failure\n\nto present argument to district court or original appellate panel).\n\n       Significantly, in Ricci, the Supreme Court neither mentioned nor used McDonnell\n\nDouglas analysis in holding that plaintiffs were entitled to summary judgment on their claim\n\nof discriminatory treatment. See Ricci v. DeStefano, 129 S. Ct. at 2681. Rather, after\n\nobserving that the City defended against the treatment claim by professing a purpose to\n\navoid disparate-impact liability, see id. at 2673, the Court proceeded to consider the three\n\nfactors relevant to a disparate-impact claim, see 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)(1)(A), and\n\nconcluded that defendants lacked a strong basis in evidence to think that they would have\n\nbeen subjected to such liability had they failed to take the challenged race-conscious,\n\ndiscriminatory actions. See Ricci v. DeStefano, 129 S. Ct. at 2677-81.\n\n       No different approach is needed in this case, where defendants do not dispute that\n\ntheir challenged settlement actions were animated by intentional considerations of race,\n\nethnicity, and gender. Their defense, as in Ricci, is that “the purpose to avoid disparate-\n\nimpact liability excuses what otherwise would be prohibited disparate-treatment\n\n                                              5\n\fdiscrimination.” Id. at 2674. A decision to remand for reconsideration in light of Ricci does\n\nnot require us to shoehorn this defense into the second step of McDonnell Douglas analysis.\n\nIndeed, the fit is awkward.      At that step, a defendant need only articulate a non-\n\ndiscriminatory purpose for his actions, not demonstrate that intentional discrimination is\n\nsupported by a valid defense with a strong basis in evidence, as Ricci requires. See\n\nHolcomb v. Iona Coll., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1302107\"><a href=\"/opinion/1302107/holcomb-v-iona-college/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">130</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 141 (2d Cir. 2008) (explaining that “[i]t is not our\n\ntask, at the second stage of the McDonnell Douglas framework, . . . to determine whether\n\nthe [defendant’s] explanation of its action is convincing” bur rather only to “ask whether\n\ndefendant has introduced evidence that, ‘taken as true, would permit the conclusion that\n\nthere was a nondiscriminatory reason’” (quoting St. Mary’s Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112901\"><a href=\"/opinion/112901/st-marys-honor-center-v-hicks/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">502</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 509 (1993) (emphasis in Hicks)).\n\n       Nor does our decision to remand require us now to decide whether, despite a strong\n\nbasis in evidence, a defendant’s claimed purpose to avoid disparate-impact liability might\n\nbe attacked as pretextual. See Ricci v. DeStefano, 129 S. Ct. at 2683 (Alito, J., concurring).\n\nMuch less need we decide that such a pretext attack occurs at step two of McDonnell\n\nDouglas analysis, as the majority indicates.2\n\n\n       2\n         Under McDonnell Douglas analysis, a plaintiff claiming pretext must show not only\nthat the stated non-discriminatory explanation was false, but also that discrimination was the\nreal reason for the challenged action. See, e.g., St. Mary’s Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. at\n515-16. But where a party engages in undeniably race-conscious conduct, so as to be liable\nfor discriminatory treatment absent a valid defense, see Ricci v. DeStefano, 129 S. Ct. at\n2673 (quoted in next paragraph of text), a showing that defendant’s true purpose was not to\navoid disparate-impact liability may defeat the defense without any need for further inquiry\nas to discriminatory intent. In any event, there is no reason to explore these issues in advance\n\n                                                6\n\f       Because defendants’ challenged settlement conduct was plainly animated by race,\n\nethnicity, and gender considerations, here, as in Ricci, any “analysis begins,” not with\n\nMcDonnell Douglas, but “with this premise: [defendants’] actions would violate the\n\ndisparate-treatment prohibition of Title VII absent some valid defense.” Id. at 2673\n\n(emphasis added). Thus, in ordering remand, we can leave it to the able district judge to\n\ndecide in the first instance whether defendants have the strong basis in evidence necessary\n\nto pursue a defense of disparate-impact liability. See id. at 2677.3\n\n       Third, the majority engages in an extensive discussion of affirmative-action precedent\n\nand strongly suggests that such plans would continue to be judged by reference to standards\n\nderived from Johnson v. Transportation Agency, Santa Clara County, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111846\"><a href=\"/opinion/111846/johnson-v-transportation-agency-santa-clara-cty/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">616</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1987),\n\nand United Steelworkers of America v. Weber, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110135\"><a href=\"/opinion/110135/steelworkers-v-weber/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">193</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1979), rather than Ricci. The\n\nmatter is by no means clear. As the majority recognizes, the Supreme Court in Ricci did not\n\nso condition its ruling, signaling that “its core holding applies whenever an employer takes\n\nrace conscious action ‘for the asserted purpose of avoiding or remedying an unintentional\n\ndisparate impact.’” Ante at [66] (quoting Ricci v. DeStefano, 129 S. Ct. at 2677 (emphasis\n\nadded by majority)). Because this case does not involve an affirmative-action plan, there is\n\n\n\nof an appeal in a case in which they were raised.\n       3\n          I do not predict whether a case might ever arise in which an employer both denies\nthat a certain action was animated by impermissible considerations and asserts that the action\nwas, in any event, excused by a purpose to avoid discriminatory-impact liability. When such\na case arises, courts can consider whether McDonnell Douglas analysis would properly apply\nto the question of intent, with Ricci analysis then applied to the discriminatory-impact-\nliability defense. That, however, is not this case.\n\n                                              7\n\fno need to “harmonize[]” Ricci with affirmative-action precedent to order remand, much less\n\nto do so in a way that could be construed to cabin Ricci to cases challenging make-whole\n\nindividualized relief. Id. at [62]. To be sure, the majority’s earlier statement that “[i]n light\n\nof Ricci,” Johnson/Weber analysis “extends, at most, to circumstances in which an employer\n\nhas undertaken a race- or gender-conscious affirmative action plan designed to benefit all\n\nmembers of a racial or gender class in a forward-looking manner only,” id. at [8] (emphasis\n\nin original), appears properly to leave for another day any controlling resolution of Ricci’s\n\napplication to affirmative-action challenges. But that is all the more reason for this panel to\n\nexercise restraint and to order remand without anticipating cases not now before us.\n\n        Fourth, the majority attempts to provide the district court with detailed guidance as\n\nto how to apply the Ricci strong-basis-in-evidence test to the record facts. This too is\n\nunnecessary to our decision to remand and puts the cart before the horse. However\n\nappropriate it may be for an appellate panel to provide instruction when a district court has\n\nmisapplied Supreme Court precedent, such instruction is premature when a remand is ordered\n\nfor application of a new Supreme Court decision. That is particularly so here, where, as I\n\nnoted earlier, the Supreme Court signaled in Ricci that its own opinion was intended to\n\nprovide the necessary “guidance” by “clarif[ying] how Title VII applies to resolve competing\n\nexpectations under the disparate-treatment and disparate-impact provisions” of Title VII.\n\nRicci v. DeStefano, 129 S. Ct. at 2674, 2681. In these circumstances, we should let Ricci\n\nspeak for itself on remand without added gloss from this panel.\n\n       In particular, I question the majority’s attempt to “hold” in the absence of any\n\n                                               8\n\fjudgment applying Ricci, what is and is not sufficient to satisfy the strong-basis-in-evidence\n\nrequirement. Ante at [76-77]. Holdings consist of determinations necessary or pivotal to a\n\ndecision; judicial statements that are unnecessary to the decision in the case are mere dicta.\n\nSee United States v. Rubin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"371378\"><a href=\"/opinion/371378/united-states-v-william-rubin/\"><span class=\"volume\">609</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">51</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 69 n.2 (2d Cir. 1979) (Friendly, J., concurring) (“A\n\njudge’s power to bind is limited to the issue that is before him; he cannot transmute dictum\n\ninto decision by waving a wand and uttering the word ‘hold.’”); see also Black’s Law\n\nDictionary 800 (defining “holding”), 1177 (defining “obiter dictum”) (9th ed. 2009). Our\n\ndecision to remand this case for application of Ricci’s strong-basis-in-evidence standard does\n\nnot require us now to pronounce principles of sufficiency for identifying when that standard\n\nis met.\n\n          I am, moreover, dubious of the majority’s pronouncement that, “under Ricci, a ‘strong\n\nbasis in evidence’” requires “less than the preponderance of the evidence that would be\n\nnecessary for actual liability.” Ante at [76-77]. To be sure, in Ricci, the Supreme Court\n\nstated that the strong-basis-in-evidence requirement is “not so restrictive that it allows\n\nemployers to act only when there is a provable, actual violation.” Ricci v. DeStefano, 129\n\nS. Ct. at 2674. But there is a difference between the preponderance finding of a violation\n\nmade by a jury after trial and a court’s identification of sufficient evidence to permit a\n\npreponderance finding at trial, a difference that I fear may be lost in the majority’s broad\n\n“holding.” A party who cannot produce sufficient record evidence to support a possible\n\npreponderance finding by a jury on an issue on which the party bears the burden is going to\n\nwind up with summary judgment awarded against him. At some point, this court may have\n\n                                                9\n\fto consider whether a “strong basis in evidence” must be sufficient to survive a summary\n\njudgment motion. After all, on such a motion, evidence is viewed in the light most favorable\n\nto the non-moving party, which means that even some weak cases can survive summary\n\njudgment. We need not decide that question, however, to order remand in this case.\n\nTherefore, we also need not “hold” that Ricci can be satisfied on less evidence than would\n\npermit a preponderance finding at trial. Indeed, on remand, the district court may find\n\nsupport for the disparate-impact liability defense so compelling or deficient as not to require\n\na precise definition of the standard of proof. That was, after all, the circumstance in Ricci.\n\n       Fifth, the majority also discusses in some detail various challenges that the Brennan\n\nIntervenors might raise to defendants’ disparate-impact-liability defense. Again, this\n\ndiscussion is unnecessary to our decision to remand. Further, it is premature now to rule that\n\ncertain challenges could not defeat the defense in this case, or to imply that certain evidence\n\nis inadmissible. These matters are best decided in the first instance by the district court.\n\nCertain challenges may be resolved on remand, whether as a matter of law or fact, in ways\n\nthat will narrow or even eliminate the need for further appellate review.\n\n       As indicated at the outset, these concerns are illustrative and not exhaustive.\n\nNevertheless, they suffice to explain why I join in the Court’s decision to affirm in part and\n\nto vacate and remand in part without also joining in the majority opinion. Rather, I would\n\nsimply conclude (1) that the district court judgment can be affirmed insofar as it (a) granted\n\nclass certification to the Brennan Intervenors, and (b) declared Ciro Dellaporte not a member\n\nof a protected class entitled to relief under the challenged settlement, but (2) that the\n\n                                              10\n\fjudgment must be vacated in all other respects and remanded for further consideration in\n\nlight of Ricci.\n\n\n\n\n                                          11\n\f</pre>",
