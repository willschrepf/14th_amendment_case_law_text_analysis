See ECF No. 21 (“Pl.’s Opp.”) at 1-2, 10. On September 16, 2015, Martínez\n\nsubmitted sixteen separate Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”) requests to various\n\nsubcomponents of seven federal agencies.1 See ECF No. 19-1 (“Defs.’ Mot.”) at 2; ECF No. 1\n\n(“Compl.”) ¶¶ 19-122. The requests sought information on specific people, organizations,\n\nevents, and publications related to the Chicano civil rights movement in Colorado from 1968 to\n\n1978. See Pl.’s Opp. at 10; ECF No. 21-1 (“Martínez Decl.”) at 4. The requests to each agency\n\nwere not identical, but many of them overlapped. See ECF No. 21-2 to 21-8 (Ex. 1A-1G); Pl.’s\n\nOpp. at 5-9.

Compl. ¶¶ 19-122.\n\n              On July 22, 2016, Martínez filed suit against the seven federal agencies, alleging that\n\nthey had improperly withheld records responsive to his FOIA requests and incorrectly denied his\n\n\n\n                                                            \n1\n  Defendants are: the (1) Department of Justice, (2) National Security Agency, (3) Department of\nHomeland Security, (4) Department of Defense, (5) Central Intelligence Agency, (6) Bureau of\nIndian Affairs, and (7) Office of the Director of National Intelligence.\n\n\n                                                                  1 \n \n\frequests for fee waivers. Id. ¶¶ 123-143. On August 3, 2017, Defendants filed a Motion to\n\nSever for Improper Joinder. Defs.’ Mot. On August 17, 2017, Martínez responded, filing his\n\nopposition and attaching a declaration and the FOIA requests at issue as exhibits. Pl.’s Opp. On\n\nAugust 31, 2017, Defendants filed their reply brief in support of their Motion. ECF No. 23. For\n\nthe reasons set forth below, Defendants’ Motion is DENIED.\n\nI.            Legal Standard\n\n              Under Rule 20(a)(2), a plaintiff may join defendants if he or she demonstrates that: (1)\n\n“any right to relief . . . asserted against them . . . aris[es] out of the same transaction, occurrence,\n\nor series of transactions or occurrences;” and (2) if “any question of law or fact common to all\n\ndefendants will arise in the action.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 20(a)(2).2 Both the “same-transaction” and\n\n“common-question-of-law-or-fact” prongs of the rule are meant to be “liberally construed” in\n\norder to promote the “just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of the action.” Davidson v.\n\nDistrict of Columbia, 736 F. Supp. 2d 115, 119 (D.D.C. 2010) (quoting Lane v. Tschetter, No.\n\n05-cv-1414, 2007 WL 2007493, at *7 (D.D.C. July 10, 2007)). “[U]nder the Rules, the impulse\n\nis toward entertaining the broadest possible scope of action consistent with fairness to the parties;\n\njoinder of claims, parties and remedies is strongly encouraged.” M.K. v. Tenet, 216 F.R.D. 133,\n\n143 (D.D.C. 2002) (quoting United Mine Workers of Am. v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715, 724 (1966)).\n\n              Although all joined claims must arise from the same transaction, the Supreme Court has\n\nrecognized that “‘[t]ransaction’ is a word of flexible meaning,” which is dependent “not so much\n\nupon the immediateness of [the claims’] connection as upon their logical relationship.” Feld\n\nEntm’t Inc. v. Am. Soc’y for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, 873 F. Supp. 2d 288, 305 (D.D.C.\n\n\n                                                            \n2\n  Rule 20(a)(1), which governs joinder of plaintiffs, uses language substantially similar to that in\nRule 20(a)(2). Thus, in this opinion, the Court relies on cases that apply this language under\neither subsection of Rule 20(a).\n                                                               2 \n \n\f2012) (quoting Moore v. N.Y. Cotton Exch., 270 U.S. 593, 610 (1926)). Thus, to meet Rule\n\n20(a)(2), the claims must be “logically related” to each other, Davidson, 736 F. Supp. 2d at 119,\n\nalthough “[a]bsolute identity of all events is unnecessary,” In re Vitamins Antitrust Litig., No.\n\nMISC 99-197 (TFH), 2000 WL 1475705, at *18 (D.D.C. May 9, 2000) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted); see Mosley v. Gen. Motors Corp., 497 F.2d 1330, 1333 (8th Cir. 1974). The “logical\n\nrelationship” test is “flexible,” Disparte v. Corp. Exec. Bd., 223 F.R.D. 7, 10 (D.D.C. 2004), and\n\nis to be “construed in a legal climate that favors joinder,” Alexander v. Edgewood Mgmt. Corp.,\n\n321 F.R.D. 460, 463 (D.D.C. 2017).\n\n       The second prong of Rule 20(a)(2) is also to be broadly interpreted, requiring only that\n\n“some common question of law or fact” connects the claims against defendants, but not that all\n\nlegal or factual questions are common to all parties involved. Disparte, 223 F.R.D. at 11 (citing\n\nMosley, 497 F.2d at 1334). Even if joinder is proper under Rule 20(a)(2), Rule 21 permits courts\n\nto sever claims “upon a sufficient showing of prejudice to the defendant, delay, or potential for\n\njury confusion.” Alexander, 321 F.R.D. at 464 (citing Montgomery v. STG Int’l, Inc., 532 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 29, 35 (D.D.C. 2008)).\n\nII.    Analysis\n\n       A.      Rule 20(a)(2) – “Same-Transaction” Prong\n\n       The Court concludes that Martínez’s FOIA requests involve the same transaction because\n\nthey are “logically related.” All of his requests seek records referring to or relating to specific\n\nindividuals, organizations, and events connected to the Chicano civil rights movement in\n\nColorado from 1968 to 1978. Pl.’s Opp., Ex. 1A-1G. That is sufficient to meet the legal\n\nstandard here. FOIA requests are “logically related” when they belong to “essentially identical\n\ncategories of records . . . regarding the same underlying subject matter.” Envir. Integrity Proj. v.\n\n\n\n                                                  3 \n \n\fSmall Bus. Admin., No. 1:13-cv-01962, 2014 WL 2768853, at *1-2 (D.D.C. June 16, 2014).\n\nAlthough each agency received a request for a different combination of individuals,\n\norganizations, and events, there is significant overlap among the requests—as demonstrated by\n\nthe charts provided by Martinez. See Pl.’s Opp. 5-9. The “same-transaction” prong does not\n\nrequire that all of these requests be identical. See Mosley, 497 F.2d at 1333; Alexander, 321\n\nF.R.D. at 463 (“That there are some material differences between the allegations against each\n\ndefendant ‘does not automatically bring such claims outside the same transaction or occurrence\n\nlanguage.’” (quoting Montgomery, 532 F. Supp. 2d at 36)). Indeed, Martínez could have\n\nsubmitted identical FOIA requests for records to each agency. Instead, as he explains, he\n\nrequested the records that each agency was most likely to have. Pl.’s Opp. at 10. To require\n\nMartínez to have submitted identical FOIA requests here would incentivize individuals in his\n\nposition to submit unnecessary requests to each agency in an effort to strengthen a case for\n\njoinder.\n\n       Furthermore, Martínez submitted all of the FOIA requests at issue to Defendants on the\n\nsame day. While that alone does not prove that the claims arise out of the same transaction,\n\ncombined with the fact that the records requested pertained to the same limited subject matter, it\n\nis further evidence of a “logical relationship” among the claims. See Envir. Integrity Proj., 2014\n\nWL 2768853, at *1 (noting that for “logically related” claims, plaintiff requested records on the\n\nsame day, but denying joinder of claims arising from requests filed two months later).\n\n       Defendants misapply the “logical relationship” test by requiring an “allegation of\n\nconcerted action between [joined] defendants.” Defs.’ Mot. at 5 (citing Spaeth v. Mich. State\n\nUniv. Coll. of Law, 845 F. Supp. 2d 48, 53 (D.D.C. 2012); U.S. ex rel. Grynberg v. Alaskan\n\nPipeline Co., No. 95-725, 1997 WL 33763820, at *1 (D.D.C. Mar. 27, 1997)). The cases they\n\n\n\n                                                 4 \n \n\fcite are easily distinguishable. In Spaeth and Grynberg, both courts required “concerted action”\n\nbecause defendants were independent corporate or non-profit defendants and were related only\n\nbecause they allegedly committed similar violations of federal law. See Spaeth, 845 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 50 (requiring “concerted action” where individual law schools each chose not to hire\n\nplaintiff);3 Grynberg, 1997 WL 33763820, at *2 (requiring “concerted action” where sixty\n\ndefendants were connected only by allegedly committing “similar actions at different times and\n\ndifferent places,” namely by submitting “distinct and separate false statements on different\n\ncontracts”).\n\n              In this case, Defendants are all federal agencies with law enforcement and intelligence-\n\ngathering functions that Martínez asserts monitored the Chicano civil rights movement in\n\nColorado during the time period in question.4 These agencies are not “totally independent\n\nactors” as the defendants were in Spaeth and Grynberg. Martínez asserts that several of the\n\nrelevant agencies coordinated certain operations relating to the Chicano civil rights movement,\n\nand identifies specific inter-agency memoranda that reflect such coordination. Pl.’s Opp. at 11.\n\nMoreover, Defendants are all components of the federal government and are subject to similar\n\npolicies. See Alexander, 321 F.R.D. at 463 (finding logical relatedness between housing\n\ndiscrimination cases where housing providers had “limited discretion as to whose applications\n\n\n                                                            \n3\n  Courts in this Circuit have developed specific factors for evaluating proper joinder in the\nemployment discrimination context. See Montgomery, 532 F. Supp. 2d at 36 (“In employment\ndiscrimination cases, courts often consider the circumstances surrounding the plaintiffs’ claims,\nincluding the people involved, the location, the time frame, and the defendant’s pattern of\nbehavior.”).\n4\n  Although the Bureau of Indian Affairs (“BIA”) would not ordinarily be considered an agency\ndealing with law enforcement or intelligence-gathering, Martínez noted in his request to the BIA\nthat a majority of the records requested would likely “be found in the archives of the police\nagencies that are part of the Bureau of Indian Affairs.” Pl.’s Opp., Ex. 1A at 2.\n\n                                                               5 \n \n\fthey [could] reject” since they were both subject to the same regulating authority). Perhaps for\n\nthat reason, courts in this Circuit generally do not require “concerted action” to justify joinder in\n\nFOIA cases. See, e.g., Envir. Integrity Proj., 2014 WL 2768853, at *1 (deciding to join agencies\n\nin a FOIA action without any reference to a “concerted action”).\n\n        For the reasons described above, and in light of the fact that the term “transaction” has a\n\n“flexible meaning,” the Court finds there is a sufficient “logical relationship” among Martínez’s\n\nclaims to satisfy this prong of Rule 20(a)(2). However, in order for joinder to be proper, the\n\nsecond prong of the statue must be met as well.\n\n        B.         Rule 20(a)(2) – “Common-Question-of-Law-or-Fact” Prong\n\n        The Court also concludes that Martínez’s claims arise under a common question of law or\n\nfact. Under Rule 20(a)(2), claims must be related by “some common question of law or fact . . .\n\nbut not all issues have to be common to all [claims].” Montgomery, 532 F. Supp. 2d at 35. An\n\nagency’s assertion of the same FOIA exemption to justify withholding documents covering the\n\nsame subject matter can present a common question of law. See Envir. Integrity Proj., 2014 WL\n\n2768853, at *1. For example, in Environmental Integrity Project, the court found that two\n\nagencies’ withholding of similar documents under Exemption 5 gave rise to a common question,\n\nbut declined to allow the plaintiff to join a third agency that had invoked a different exemption.\n\nSee id. at *1-2.\n\n        In this case, as in Environmental Integrity Project, it appears that certain common\n\nexemptions will be asserted by the agencies at summary judgment, giving rise to common\n\nquestions of law. Martínez has already indicated that he anticipates and may dispute the\n\ninvocation of certain exemptions, particularly Exemptions 1, 3, and 7. Pl.’s Opp. at 10-11. This\n\ndoes not mean that every claim will raise the same questions of law. As Defendants suggest, the\n\n\n\n                                                  6 \n \n\fanalysis of these exemptions may differ among the claims, depending on the specific facts.\n\nHowever, due to the overlapping nature of Martínez’s requests, it is likely that the Court will be\n\nasked to apply the same exceptions to documents and records that, if not identical, at least share\n\nthe same underlying subject matter. The Court is satisfied that, as the litigation now stands, there\n\nis likely to be some common question of law or fact between the claims. As the litigation\n\nproceeds, if it becomes clear that the claims against a particular agency involve no such common\n\nquestions, that Defendant may renew its motion to sever.\n\n       Additionally, as Martínez notes, the same question of fact regarding his fee status must be\n\naddressed with respect to all of the FOIA requests he has submitted. Although individual agency\n\npolicies determine who is eligible for fee waivers, Defs.’ Mot. at 7, the Court must make a\n\nfactual determination as to whether Martínez meets FOIA’s statutory definition of a\n\n“representative of the news media” for the purpose of qualifying for a fee reduction, see 5 U.S.C.\n\n§ 552(a)(4)(A)(i); cf. Alexander, 321 F.R.D. at 464 (“Here, the identity of the plaintiff also\n\nmight be considered a common question of fact . . . because the plaintiff’s identity, and how\n\ncertain elements of his personal history relate to federal regulations, is exactly what is at issue.”).\n\n       Although this case may involve differing legal and factual questions, the Court finds that\n\nMartínez has also shown that his claims against Defendants share at least some common\n\nquestions of law or fact, which is all that is required. See Montgomery, 532 F. Supp. 2d at 35.\n\nTherefore, the Court concludes that Defendants are properly joined under Rule 20(a)(2).\n\n       C.      Rule 21 – Prejudice to the Defendants\n\n       Despite the fact that Defendants are properly joined under Rule 20, Rule 21 permits\n\ncourts to sever claims “upon a sufficient showing of prejudice to the defendant, delay, or\n\npotential for jury confusion.” Alexander, 321 F.R.D. at 464 (citing Montgomery, 532 F. Supp.\n\n\n\n                                                   7 \n \n\f2d at 35). Defendants argue that they will be prejudiced by proceeding as joined. But they have\n\nnot sufficiently demonstrated such prejudice, and thus the Court declines to sever.\n\n       Defendants argue that they face potential prejudice in two ways. First, Defendants\n\ncontend that failing to sever these claims will significantly delay proceedings because “the\n\nlawsuit can only proceed to final judgment as quickly as can the slowest component agency,”\n\nthus “no decision in favor of any agency would be final until all claims in the case are resolved.”\n\nDefs.’ Mot. at 8-9. But that argument alone cannot justify severing the case, because there are\n\nother procedures better suited to avoiding such prejudice. Specifically, Rule 54(b) allows the\n\nCourt to enter final judgment for one or more joined parties “if the court expressly determines\n\nthat there is no just reason for delay.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b). Thus, the Court may finalize\n\nindividual claims against each agency to avoid prejudicing them.\n\n       Second, Defendants claim that joinder will prejudice the agencies because, “to the extent\n\nthat Plaintiff is successful on his FOIA claims as to one or more of the parties, and seeks to\n\nrecover attorney’s fees, it would be very difficult to segregate the fees between the unsuccessful\n\nand successful claims.” Defs.’ Mot. at 9. However, as Martínez emphasizes, the burden will be\n\non him, as Plaintiff, to justify fees for each agency at the conclusion of litigation if he prevails.\n\nPl.’s Opp. at 15. In addition, any disputes over the fees would be more easily resolved if the\n\nclaims remained consolidated in one case. The Court also notes that joinder has the potential to\n\nwork in the agencies’ favor on attorneys’ fees, because it may allow the parties to consolidate\n\nany motion practice and thereby reduce Martínez’s fees.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   8 \n \n\fIII.

Disparte, 223 F.R.D. at 11 (citing\n\nMosley, 497 F.2d at 1334). Even if joinder is proper under Rule 20(a)(2), Rule 21 permits courts\n\nto sever claims “upon a sufficient showing of prejudice to the defendant, delay, or potential for\n\njury confusion.” Alexander, 321 F.R.D. at 464 (citing Montgomery v. STG Int’l, Inc., 532 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 29, 35 (D.D.C. 2008)).\n\nII.    Analysis\n\n       A.      Rule 20(a)(2) – “Same-Transaction” Prong\n\n       The Court concludes that Martínez’s FOIA requests involve the same transaction because\n\nthey are “logically related.” All of his requests seek records referring to or relating to specific\n\nindividuals, organizations, and events connected to the Chicano civil rights movement in\n\nColorado from 1968 to 1978. Pl.’s Opp., Ex. 1A-1G. That is sufficient to meet the legal\n\nstandard here. FOIA requests are “logically related” when they belong to “essentially identical\n\ncategories of records . . . regarding the same underlying subject matter.” Envir. Integrity Proj. v.\n\n\n\n                                                  3 \n \n\fSmall Bus. Admin., No. 1:13-cv-01962, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2014</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2768853</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *1-2 (D.D.C. June 16, 2014).\n\nAlthough each agency received a request for a different combination of individuals,\n\norganizations, and events, there is significant overlap among the requests—as demonstrated by\n\nthe charts provided by Martinez. See Pl.’s Opp. 5-9. The “same-transaction” prong does not\n\nrequire that all of these requests be identical. See Mosley, 497 F.2d at 1333; Alexander, 321\n\nF.R.D. at 463 (“That there are some material differences between the allegations against each\n\ndefendant ‘does not automatically bring such claims outside the same transaction or occurrence\n\nlanguage.’” (quoting Montgomery, 532 F. Supp. 2d at 36)). Indeed, Martínez could have\n\nsubmitted identical FOIA requests for records to each agency. Instead, as he explains, he\n\nrequested the records that each agency was most likely to have. Pl.’s Opp. at 10. To require\n\nMartínez to have submitted identical FOIA requests here would incentivize individuals in his\n\nposition to submit unnecessary requests to each agency in an effort to strengthen a case for\n\njoinder.\n\n       Furthermore, Martínez submitted all of the FOIA requests at issue to Defendants on the\n\nsame day. While that alone does not prove that the claims arise out of the same transaction,\n\ncombined with the fact that the records requested pertained to the same limited subject matter, it\n\nis further evidence of a “logical relationship” among the claims. See Envir. Integrity Proj., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2014</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2768853</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *1 (noting that for “logically related” claims, plaintiff requested records on the\n\nsame day, but denying joinder of claims arising from requests filed two months later).\n\n       Defendants misapply the “logical relationship” test by requiring an “allegation of\n\nconcerted action between [joined] defendants.” Defs.’ Mot. at 5 (citing Spaeth v. Mich. State\n\nUniv. Coll. of Law, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">845</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

In Spaeth and Grynberg, both courts required “concerted action”\n\nbecause defendants were independent corporate or non-profit defendants and were related only\n\nbecause they allegedly committed similar violations of federal law. See Spaeth, 845 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 50 (requiring “concerted action” where individual law schools each chose not to hire\n\nplaintiff);3 Grynberg, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1997</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">33763820</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2 (requiring “concerted action” where sixty\n\ndefendants were connected only by allegedly committing “similar actions at different times and\n\ndifferent places,” namely by submitting “distinct and separate false statements on different\n\ncontracts”).\n\n              In this case, Defendants are all federal agencies with law enforcement and intelligence-\n\ngathering functions that Martínez asserts monitored the Chicano civil rights movement in\n\nColorado during the time period in question.4 These agencies are not “totally independent\n\nactors” as the defendants were in Spaeth and Grynberg. Martínez asserts that several of the\n\nrelevant agencies coordinated certain operations relating to the Chicano civil rights movement,\n\nand identifies specific inter-agency memoranda that reflect such coordination. Pl.’s Opp. at 11.\n\nMoreover, Defendants are all components of the federal government and are subject to similar\n\npolicies. See Alexander, 321 F.R.D. at 463 (finding logical relatedness between housing\n\ndiscrimination cases where housing providers had “limited discretion as to whose applications\n\n\n                                                            \n3\n  Courts in this Circuit have developed specific factors for evaluating proper joinder in the\nemployment discrimination context. See Montgomery, 532 F. Supp. 2d at 36 (“In employment\ndiscrimination cases, courts often consider the circumstances surrounding the plaintiffs’ claims,\nincluding the people involved, the location, the time frame, and the defendant’s pattern of\nbehavior.”).\n4\n  Although the Bureau of Indian Affairs (“BIA”) would not ordinarily be considered an agency\ndealing with law enforcement or intelligence-gathering, Martínez noted in his request to the BIA\nthat a majority of the records requested would likely “be found in the archives of the police\nagencies that are part of the Bureau of Indian Affairs.” Pl.’s Opp., Ex. 1A at 2.\n\n                                                               5 \n \n\fthey [could] reject” since they were both subject to the same regulating authority). Perhaps for\n\nthat reason, courts in this Circuit generally do not require “concerted action” to justify joinder in\n\nFOIA cases. See, e.g., Envir. Integrity Proj., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2014</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2768853</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *1 (deciding to join agencies\n\nin a FOIA action without any reference to a “concerted action”).\n\n        For the reasons described above, and in light of the fact that the term “transaction” has a\n\n“flexible meaning,” the Court finds there is a sufficient “logical relationship” among Martínez’s\n\nclaims to satisfy this prong of Rule 20(a)(2). However, in order for joinder to be proper, the\n\nsecond prong of the statue must be met as well.\n\n        B.         Rule 20(a)(2) – “Common-Question-of-Law-or-Fact” Prong\n\n        The Court also concludes that Martínez’s claims arise under a common question of law or\n\nfact. Under Rule 20(a)(2), claims must be related by “some common question of law or fact . . .\n\nbut not all issues have to be common to all [claims].” Montgomery, 532 F. Supp. 2d at 35. An\n\nagency’s assertion of the same FOIA exemption to justify withholding documents covering the\n\nsame subject matter can present a common question of law. See Envir. Integrity Proj., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2014</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">2768853</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *1. For example, in Environmental Integrity Project, the court found that two\n\nagencies’ withholding of similar documents under Exemption 5 gave rise to a common question,\n\nbut declined to allow the plaintiff to join a third agency that had invoked a different exemption.\n\nSee id. at *1-2.\n\n        In this case, as in Environmental Integrity Project, it appears that certain common\n\nexemptions will be asserted by the agencies at summary judgment, giving rise to common\n\nquestions of law. Martínez has already indicated that he anticipates and may dispute the\n\ninvocation of certain exemptions, particularly Exemptions 1, 3, and 7. Pl.’s Opp. at 10-11. This\n\ndoes not mean that every claim will raise the same questions of law. As Defendants suggest, the\n\n\n\n                                                  6 \n \n\fanalysis of these exemptions may differ among the claims, depending on the specific facts.\n\nHowever, due to the overlapping nature of Martínez’s requests, it is likely that the Court will be\n\nasked to apply the same exceptions to documents and records that, if not identical, at least share\n\nthe same underlying subject matter. The Court is satisfied that, as the litigation now stands, there\n\nis likely to be some common question of law or fact between the claims. As the litigation\n\nproceeds, if it becomes clear that the claims against a particular agency involve no such common\n\nquestions, that Defendant may renew its motion to sever.\n\n       Additionally, as Martínez notes, the same question of fact regarding his fee status must be\n\naddressed with respect to all of the FOIA requests he has submitted. Although individual agency\n\npolicies determine who is eligible for fee waivers, Defs.’ Mot. at 7, the Court must make a\n\nfactual determination as to whether Martínez meets FOIA’s statutory definition of a\n\n“representative of the news media” for the purpose of qualifying for a fee reduction, see 5 U.S.C.\n\n§ 552(a)(4)(A)(i); cf. Alexander, 321 F.R.D. at 464 (“Here, the identity of the plaintiff also\n\nmight be considered a common question of fact . . . because the plaintiff’s identity, and how\n\ncertain elements of his personal history relate to federal regulations, is exactly what is at issue.”).\n\n       Although this case may involve differing legal and factual questions, the Court finds that\n\nMartínez has also shown that his claims against Defendants share at least some common\n\nquestions of law or fact, which is all that is required. See Montgomery, 532 F. Supp. 2d at 35.\n\nTherefore, the Court concludes that Defendants are properly joined under Rule 20(a)(2).\n\n       C.      Rule 21 – Prejudice to the Defendants\n\n       Despite the fact that Defendants are properly joined under Rule 20, Rule 21 permits\n\ncourts to sever claims “upon a sufficient showing of prejudice to the defendant, delay, or\n\npotential for jury confusion.” Alexander, 321 F.R.D. at 464 (citing Montgomery, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">532</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span>\n\n\n\n                                                   <span class=\"page\">7</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> \n \n\f2d at 35). Defendants argue that they will be prejudiced by proceeding as joined. But they have\n\nnot sufficiently demonstrated such prejudice, and thus the Court declines to sever.\n\n       Defendants argue that they face potential prejudice in two ways. First, Defendants\n\ncontend that failing to sever these claims will significantly delay proceedings because “the\n\nlawsuit can only proceed to final judgment as quickly as can the slowest component agency,”\n\nthus “no decision in favor of any agency would be final until all claims in the case are resolved.”\n\nDefs.’ Mot. at 8-9. But that argument alone cannot justify severing the case, because there are\n\nother procedures better suited to avoiding such prejudice. Specifically, Rule 54(b) allows the\n\nCourt to enter final judgment for one or more joined parties “if the court expressly determines\n\nthat there is no just reason for delay.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b). Thus, the Court may finalize\n\nindividual claims against each agency to avoid prejudicing them.\n\n       Second, Defendants claim that joinder will prejudice the agencies because, “to the extent\n\nthat Plaintiff is successful on his FOIA claims as to one or more of the parties, and seeks to\n\nrecover attorney’s fees, it would be very difficult to segregate the fees between the unsuccessful\n\nand successful claims.” Defs.’ Mot. at 9. However, as Martínez emphasizes, the burden will be\n\non him, as Plaintiff, to justify fees for each agency at the conclusion of litigation if he prevails.\n\nPl.’s Opp. at 15. In addition, any disputes over the fees would be more easily resolved if the\n\nclaims remained consolidated in one case. The Court also notes that joinder has the potential to\n\nwork in the agencies’ favor on attorneys’ fees, because it may allow the parties to consolidate\n\nany motion practice and thereby reduce Martínez’s fees.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   8 \n \n\fIII.
