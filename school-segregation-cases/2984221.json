Keystone-\n\nTexas Property Holding Corp. owned the mall and the land underlying the hotel. HMC Hotel\n\nProperties II Limited Partnership leased the land underlying the hotel from Keystone pursuant to\n\na long-term ground lease.        HMC sued Keystone for breach of the lease.          Keystone filed\n\ncounterclaims against HMC for slander of title and tortious interference with an agreement\n\f                                                                                  04-10-00620-CV\n\n\nKeystone had with a third party to purchase the property. Keystone also asserted the same\n\nclaims against HMC’s parent corporation, Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. f/k/a Host Marriott\n\nCorporation and Host Hotels & Resorts, L.P. f/k/a Host Marriott, L.P. A jury rejected HMC’s\n\nbreach of contract claim, and instead found in favor of Keystone on both of its claims.\n\nHMC/Host appealed the resulting judgment raising numerous issues, and Keystone filed a cross-\n\nappeal.\n\n                                         BACKGROUND\n\n          In 1992, the Pennsylvania Public School Employees’ Retirement System (PSERS)\n\nacquired both the land underlying the Marriott Rivercenter Hotel, subject to HMC’s ground\n\nlease, and Rivercenter Mall. PSERS formed Keystone as a subsidiary to own the property. L&B\n\nRealty Advisors was retained to manage the property. In 2000, PSERS decided to sell its direct-\n\nowned real estate.\n\n          In October of 2003, Michael Grubic, the portfolio manager with PSERS responsible for\n\noverseeing L&B’s actions relating to the Rivercenter property, contacted John Gerdes, the\n\nexecutive vice-president with L&B in charge of the Rivercenter property, and urged him to\n\nconsider whether Keystone should sell the property. Grubic contacted Gerdes after learning that\n\na mall in Maine had sold for a very good price. Based on recommendations by Grubic’s\n\nsupervisor, on April 27, 2004, the PSERS board of directors authorized the property to be\n\nmarketed for sale. In June of 2004, Keystone retained a law firm to represent it in the marketing\n\nand potential sale of the property. In July of 2004, Holliday, Feloglio, and Fowler (“HFF”), an\n\ninvestment brokerage firm, was retained to market the property. HFF decided to use a marketing\n\nprice of $170-180 million and believed the property would sell for $155-165 million.\n\n\n\n\n                                              -2-\n\f                                                                                    04-10-00620-CV\n\n\n           An offering memorandum was prepared and sent to a list of potential investors.\n\nHost/HMC was not on the list. Based on the offers received, L&B recommended that PSERS\n\naccept an offer made by Ashkenazy Acquisition Corporation for $175 million. Ashkenazy had\n\nrecently sold other real property and needed to close on the sale by December 31, 2004, in order\n\nfor the capital tax on the prior sale to be deferred pursuant to a section 1031 exchange. After the\n\nrecommendation was made that the PSERS board approve the offer by Ashkenazy, Ashkenazy\n\nhad “buyer’s remorse” about the price. Although the PSERS board approved a reduction in price\n\nto $165 million, the sale was not closed because Ashkenazy pursued a different asset,\n\npresumably to ensure the timing of his section 1031 exchange. HFF extended the deadline for\n\noffers based on the prior memorandum. Ashkenazy was again recommended as the proposed\n\npurchaser for $166 million. In December of 2004, the parties exchanged drafts of a letter of\n\nintent, and L&B received a $1 million escrow deposit on December 31, 2004.\n\n           Also in December 2004, following communication between Gerdes and Grubic, Gerdes\n\ndetermined that notice was required to be sent to HMC under section 14.02 of the ground lease\n\nwhich was entitled “Tenant’s First Right of Negotiation.” 1 Gerdes based the notice letter on a\n\nsimilar letter sent to HMC in connection with PSERS’s purchase in 1992. Recognizing that\n\nHMC had requested an allocation of the purchase price between the mall property and the hotel\n\nproperty in 1992, Ashkenazy was asked to make an allocation of the $166 million purchase\n\nprice. Ashkenazy allocated $65 million to the hotel property.\n\n           On January 7, 2005, Keystone sent HMC a letter notifying it of the pending sale of the\n\nhotel land to Ashkenazy for $65 million. The letter stated the sale was expected to close in\n\nseventy-five days. The letter further stated that HMC had a period of thirty days to notify\n\n\n\n1\n    Section 14.02 is quoted, in pertinent part, on pages 5-6 of this opinion.\n\n                                                            -3-\n\f                                                                                   04-10-00620-CV\n\n\nKeystone of its intent to negotiate a purchase of the hotel land; however, Keystone requested that\n\nHMC sign a waiver of its rights to enable Keystone to proceed with the sale.\n\n       On February 1, 2005, Daniel Burke, the vice-president for asset management for Host,\n\nemailed Gerdes requesting more information about the specifics of the deal. After Gerdes and\n\nBurke spoke on February 8, 2005, Burke sent Gerdes an email dated February 11, 2005,\n\nexpressing a potential interest in negotiating, stating HMC was unprepared to waive its rights,\n\nand requesting additional information. Burke informed Gerdes that Host believed the value of\n\nthe hotel land was around $30 million. At that time, the sale of both the mall property and the\n\nhotel land was scheduled to close on March 28, 2005 (this date was important to Ashkenazy for\n\nanother section 1031 deadline). On February 23, 2005, Gerdes sent Burke an email asking Burke\n\nto confirm whether he had received the requested information. Burke acknowledged receiving\n\nthe information and informed Gerdes he would get back with him regarding a timeline.\n\n       In order to meet the section 1031 deadline, a decision was made to split the closing of the\n\nsale of the mall and the sale of the hotel land. The agreements contained a “clawback” provision\n\nthat would enable Keystone to reacquire the mall if Ashkenazy defaulted on his purchase of the\n\nhotel land. The mall sale closed on March 29, 2005, and the sale of the hotel land was scheduled\n\nto close on April 28, 2005.\n\n       On March 17, 2005, Burke sent Gerdes an email stating that the waiver was close to\n\nbeing signed and sent back. Burke stated that he would like to speak with Ashkenazy and\n\nrequested that Gerdes facilitate the contact. Burke stated that after he spoke with Ashkenazy, he\n\nwould send the waiver back promptly.\n\n       Gerdes promptly contacted Ashkenazy to facilitate a meeting. Burke and another Host\n\nexecutive, Andrew Bruce Lewis, met with Ashkenazy, and Ashkenazy entertained the thought of\n\n\n\n                                               -4-\n\f                                                                                   04-10-00620-CV\n\n\nflipping the hotel land to Host.     At a subsequent meeting between Ashkenazy and Lewis,\n\nhowever, Ashkenazy explained that the financing of the transaction would not permit him to flip\n\nthe land. Based on these meetings, HMC/Host developed the opinion that the allocation of the\n\npurchase price was a sham intended to get HMC/Host out of the way as an impediment to the\n\nsale. Although HMC/Host formulated this opinion and believed that Section 14.02 of the lease\n\nhad been violated, HMC/Host did not share this opinion with Keystone.\n\n       On April 15, 2005, HMC signed an estoppel certificate stating that the lease was not in\n\ndefault. Around this same time, Ashkenazy’s lender requested a different estoppel certificate\n\nform that contained language waiving the Section 14.02 first right of negotiation.          Gerdes\n\ncontinued to request updates from Burke and received one message in which Burke stated that\n\nHost’s acquisition people were supposed to contact Gerdes to discuss a purchase.\n\n       Finally, on April 18, 2005, Host sent a letter to Keystone stating that Keystone was in\n\ndefault under Section 14.02. Host demanded an additional 90-day period in which to negotiate\n\nthe purchase of the hotel land. The sale of the hotel land to Ashkenazy, which was scheduled to\n\noccur on April 28, 2005, did not close, and the underlying litigation ensued.\n\n                                  SECTION 14.02 OF THE LEASE\n\n       Section 14.02 of the ground lease to HMC (“Lease”) entitled “Tenant’s First Right of\n\nNegotiation” provides, in pertinent part:\n\n               If Landlord decides to sell the Leased Premises to a third party, Landlord\n       will give Tenant notice of such decision and afford Tenant a reasonable period of\n       time as specified in such notice, but in no event more than ninety (90) days, in\n       which to attempt to negotiate a mutually satisfactory agreement for purchase of\n       the Leased Premises. If after expiration of ninety (90) days following the date of\n       Landlord’s notice of its desire to sell the Leased Premises Landlord and Tenant\n       are not able or willing to enter into a mutually acceptable agreement for purchase\n       of the Leased Premises, Landlord shall be free to sell the Leased Premises to a\n       third party at a sales price and upon financing arrangements, if any, not more\n       favorable to such third party than Landlord was willing to sell the Leased\n\n                                               -5-\n\f                                                                                   04-10-00620-CV\n\n\n       Premises to Tenant and subject to the following further condition: Landlord shall\n       give Tenant notice of the proposed sale of the Leased Premises, which notice shall\n       disclose the identity of the proposed purchaser and all information regarding such\n       purchaser and all material information regarding the terms and conditions of such\n       sale.\n\n\nThe first question submitted to the jury asked whether Keystone failed to comply with Section\n\n14.02 of the Lease. The jury was instructed that Section 14.02 required that Keystone notify\n\nHMC sufficiently prior to selling the hotel land to permit a proper notice period for HMC to\n\nnegotiate. The jury answered “no.”\n\n       In its first issue, HMC/Host contends the jury’s answer to Question No. 1 was fatally\n\nflawed because the trial court’s construction of Section 14.02 was incorrect as a matter of law,\n\nand the evidence conclusively established that Keystone breached the Lease. Alternatively,\n\nHMC/Host asserts: (1) Section 14.02 is ambiguous requiring a new trial; or (2) the trial court’s\n\nerroneous instructions relating to Question No. 1 require a new trial.       In its cross-appeal,\n\nKeystone contends the trial court erred in failing to enter a declaratory judgment that Section\n\n14.02 is unenforceable as a matter of law.\n\nA.     Enforceability of Section 14.02\n\n       Whether a particular agreement is legally enforceable is a question of law reviewed de\n\nnovo. Martin v. Martin, 326 S.W.3d 741, 747 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2010, pet. denied);\n\nParker Drilling Co. v. Romfor Supply Co., 316 S.W.3d 68, 72 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.]\n\n2010, pet. denied). In general, an agreement is legally binding only if its terms are sufficiently\n\ndefinite to enable a court to understand the parties’ obligations. Fort Worth Ind. Sch. Dist. v.\n\nCity of Fort Worth, 22 S.W.3d 831, 846 (Tex. 2000). An agreement to make a future contract is\n\nlegally enforceable only if it does not leave material terms open for future negotiation. Id.;\n\nMartin, 326 S.W.3d at 749. Under Texas law, an agreement to negotiate in the future is\n\n                                               -6-\n\f                                                                                   04-10-00620-CV\n\n\nunenforceable, even if the agreement calls for a good faith effort in the negotiations. See\n\nRadford v. McNeny, 129 Tex. 568, 104 S.W.2d 472, 474-75 (1937); Martin, 326 S.W.3d at 750-\n\n51; John Wood Group USA, Inc. v. ICO, Inc., 26 S.W.3d 12, 21 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.]\n\n2000, pet. denied); Maranatha Temple, Inc. v. Enter. Prods. Co., 893 S.W.2d 92, 104 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1994, writ denied). Such an agreement to negotiate is unenforceable\n\nbecause “[t]here would be no way by which the court could determine what sort of a contract the\n\nnegotiations would result in, no rule by which the court could ascertain whether any, or, if so,\n\nwhat damages might follow a refusal to enter into such future contract.” Radford, 104 S.W.2d at\n\n474-75.\n\n       Generally, the cases are fairly clear in applying the law that an agreement to negotiate in\n\nthe future is unenforceable because the terms are insufficiently definite to enable a court to\n\nascertain damages. For example, in Radford, the court considered whether a commission was\n\nowed to a realtor where the contract provided for payment of the commission upon the making of\n\na lease “on such terms, or such others as I may accept.” 104 S.W.2d at 473. The court held that\n\nsince the contract between the lessor and the lessee was subject to the lessor negotiating and\n\nagreeing to the terms, the agreement was too indefinite to enforce where no actual lease was\n\nsigned. Id. at 474. Similarly, in Maranatha Temple, Inc., the oral agreement in question stated\n\nthat an individual was to meet with a company’s representatives in good faith to address a\n\nproblem. 893 S.W.2d at 104. The court held that the parties had agreed to do nothing more than\n\nenter into good faith negotiations in the future concerning what to do about the problem. Id.\n\n       Finally, and most similar to the facts of the instant case, in Martin, two shareholders\n\nreached a settlement agreement containing multiple provisions, including a provision stating that\n\nthey would negotiate a shareholder agreement in good faith for sixty days (later extended to\n\n\n\n                                               -7-\n\f                                                                                     04-10-00620-CV\n\n\nninety days) that would be applicable to all shareholders. 326 S.W.3d at 744, 747-48. Because\n\nthe shareholders never agreed on the content of a shareholder agreement, such an agreement was\n\nnever executed. Id. at 748. One of the two shareholders, Ruben, argued that the agreement\n\nrequired the shareholders to both negotiate and reach a shareholder agreement in order for the\n\nsettlement agreement to be enforceable. Id. at 749. The other shareholder, Scott, argued that the\n\nobligation was simply to negotiate, and the settlement agreement was still enforceable even\n\nthough no shareholder agreement was signed. Id. at 750. The court rejected Scott’s argument,\n\nconcluding:\n\n               Scott’s argument, though creative, does not conform to Texas law. The\n       shareholder agreement must be executed, not merely negotiated. The agreement\n       itself supports this conclusion. Paragraph one states that the brothers “will\n       negotiate a shareholder agreement” that “will be applicable to all shareholders.”\n       Since the goal of negotiation is agreement, if the parties are required to “negotiate\n       an agreement,” they must necessarily and ultimately conclude with a negotiated\n       agreement. Otherwise, the parties have only attempted to negotiate an agreement.\n       Additionally, paragraph one contains obligatory language which supports the\n       conclusion that its terms require the execution of a shareholder agreement. It\n       requires that (the shareholder agreement) “will provide,” “will contain,” and “will\n       require.” Imperative statements such as these envision the object to be\n       accomplished will, in fact, be accomplished. In failing to negotiate a shareholder\n       agreement, the parties fell short of accomplishing this goal. Thus, the completion\n       date--meaning completion “of all of the obligations under this Settlement\n       Agreement”--was not reached because the obligation of executing a shareholder\n       agreement was not completed. Without a completion date, Ruben contends the\n       agreement is merely an agreement to agree in the future, which is not legally\n       binding.\n\nId. at 751. The court agreed with Ruben’s argument. After concluding that the shareholder\n\nagreement was an essential provision of the overall agreement, the court concluded, “Because\n\nthe settlement agreement leaves this essential provision open for future agreement that never\n\noccurred, it is not binding and merely constitutes an agreement to agree in the future.” Id. at 754.\n\nAccordingly, the court held the settlement agreement was unenforceable as a matter of law. Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                                -8-\n\f                                                                                    04-10-00620-CV\n\n\n       Section 14.02 of the Lease is distinguishable from the settlement agreement in Martin in\n\none very important detail. Section 14.02 recognizes on its face that an actual agreement may not\n\nresult from the negotiations. The goal of the negotiations required by Section 14.02 is, therefore,\n\nnot an actual enforceable agreement. Instead, the goal of the negotiations is to establish the\n\nterms on which the HMC was willing to purchase the hotel land. The establishment of these\n\nterms is important in and of itself because those terms would establish a threshold below which\n\nKeystone could not go in selling the property to a third party. Under Section 14.02, Keystone\n\nwas free to sell to a third party only at a sales price not more favorable than the sales price\n\nestablished in the negotiations between HMC and Keystone. As a result, a court could readily\n\ndetermine whether Keystone breached Section 14.02 by selling to a third party on more\n\nfavorable terms. Because the terms of Section 14.02 are sufficiently definite to enable a court to\n\nunderstand the parties’ obligations thereunder, the trial court properly determined that Section\n\n14.02 was enforceable. Fort Worth Ind. Sch. Dist., 22 S.W.3d at 846.\n\nB.     Construction/Interpretation of Section 14.02\n\n       The interpretation or construction of an unambiguous contract is a question of law for the\n\ncourt, which is reviewed on appeal de novo. Willis v. Donnelly, 199 S.W.3d 262, 275 (Tex.\n\n2006); Alamo Cmty. College Dist. v. Browning Const. Co., 131 S.W.3d 146, 155 (Tex. App.—\n\nSan Antonio 2004, pet. denied). “In construing a written contract, the primary concern of the\n\ncourt is to ascertain the true intentions of the parties as expressed in the instrument.” Coker v.\n\nCoker, 650 S.W.2d 391, 393 (Tex. 1983). When discerning the contracting parties’ intent, courts\n\nmust examine the entire agreement in an effort to harmonize and give effect to each provision so\n\nthat none is rendered meaningless. Seagull Energy E & P, Inc. v. Eland Energy, Inc., 207\n\nS.W.3d 342, 345 (Tex. 2006). “No single provision taken alone will be given controlling effect;\n\n\n\n                                               -9-\n\f                                                                                    04-10-00620-CV\n\n\nrather, all the provisions must be considered with reference to the whole instrument.” Coker,\n\n650 S.W.2d at 393.\n\n       HMC/Host contends the agreement required Keystone to provide notice when it reached\n\na decision to market the property for sale. HMC/Host argues that notice was required to be\n\nprovided before Keystone hired consultants to market and solicit bids. HMC/Host strenuously\n\nargues that notice was required before Keystone targeted a potential buyer and agreed to\n\nnegotiate exclusively with that buyer.      Finally, HMC/Host asserts Section 14.02 required\n\nKeystone to negotiate with HMC before it negotiated with third parties.\n\n       On the other hand, Keystone contends that notice was not required until a decision was\n\nmade to sell to an identified third-party buyer. Keystone asserts Section 14.02 contains no\n\nlanguage requiring it to exclusively negotiate with HMC, and courts cannot “rewrite agreements\n\nto insert provisions parties could have included or to imply restraints for which they have not\n\nbargained.” Tenneco, Inc. v. Enter. Prods. Co., 925 S.W.2d 640, 646 (Tex. 1996).\n\n       Examining Section 14.02 in its entirety, we agree with the trial court’s and Keystone’s\n\ninterpretation of the provision. We are persuaded by the language following the effect of the\n\ninability or unwillingness of Keystone and HMC to enter into a mutually acceptable agreement.\n\nSection 14.02 provides that in such an event, “Landlord shall be free to sell the Leased Premises\n\nto a third party . . . .” (emphasis added). If Keystone was required to negotiate exclusively with\n\nHMC, this provision would have read, “Landlord shall be free to negotiate the sale of the Leased\n\nPremises to a third party . . . .” We are also persuaded by Keystone’s argument regarding an\n\nidentified third party. If the third party and the potential terms of a sale are unknown, how could\n\nthe Landlord “decide” to “sell” the hotel land to a third party? In the absence of a known\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 10 -\n\f                                                                                               04-10-00620-CV\n\n\npurchaser and price, the Landlord might have decided to negotiate the sale of the hotel land, but\n\ncertainly could not have decided to sell it.\n\n        Finally, HMC/Host’s interpretation would raise concerns with the following scenario: a\n\nthird-party purchaser unexpectedly approaches Keystone and offers to purchase the property for\n\n$1 billion.    Keystone could immediately “decide” to “sell” the hotel land to that person;\n\nhowever, there would have been no opportunity for prior notice and negotiation with HMC. As a\n\nresult, according to HMC/Host’s interpretation, Keystone would be in breach of Section 14.02.\n\nThis necessarily would be inconsistent with the true intentions of the parties.\n\nC.      Ambiguity\n\n        In an alternative argument, HMC/Host contends Section 14.02 is ambiguous; therefore, a\n\nnew trial is necessary. Deciding whether a contract is ambiguous is a question of law for the\n\ncourt. Dynegy Midstream Servs., Ltd. P’ship v. Apache Corp., 294 S.W.3d 164, 168 (Tex.\n\n2009); J.M. Davidson, Inc. v. Webster, 128 S.W.3d 223, 229 (Tex. 2003).                        A contract is\n\nunambiguous if it can be given a definite or certain legal meaning. J.M. Davidson, Inc., 128\n\nS.W.3d at 229. “A contract is ambiguous when its meaning is uncertain and doubtful or is\n\nreasonably susceptible to more than one interpretation.” Dynergy Midstream Servs., Ltd. P’ship,\n\n294 S.W.3d at 168. “A contract is not ambiguous simply because the parties disagree over its\n\nmeaning.” Id.\n\n        In this case, Section 14.02 can be given a definite or certain legal meaning and, for the\n\nreasons previously stated, HMC/Host’s interpretation of Section 14.02 is not reasonable\n\nconsidering the language as a whole. The contract is not ambiguous simply because the parties\n\ndisagree over its interpretation. See id. Accordingly, we hold Section 14.02 is not ambiguous. 2\n\n\n2\n Keystone contends HMC/Host waived the argument that Section 14.02 is ambiguous by not objecting to the jury\ncharge and requesting questions pertaining to its ambiguity. The Texas Supreme Court, however, has rejected such\n\n                                                     - 11 -\n\f                                                                                                   04-10-00620-CV\n\n\nD.      Jury Charge\n\n        In a second alternative argument, HMC/Host contends the trial court impermissibly\n\ncommented on the weight of the evidence in providing the instruction that accompanied\n\nQuestion No. 1 and in providing a supplemental instruction in response to a note from the jury.\n\n        A trial court is required to give “such instructions and definitions as shall be proper to\n\nenable the jury to render a verdict.” TEX. R. CIV. P. 277. “An instruction is proper if it (1) assists\n\nthe jury, (2) accurately states the law, and (3) finds support in the pleadings and evidence.”\n\nColumbia Rio Grande Healthcare, L.P. v. Hawley, 284 S.W.3d 851, 855-56 (Tex. 2009).\n\n“Determining necessary and proper jury instructions is a matter within the trial court’s discretion,\n\nand appellate review is for abuse of that discretion.” Id.\n\n        The instruction that accompanied Question No. 1 stated, “Section 14.02 required that\n\nKeystone notify HMC sufficiently prior to selling the Land to permit a proper notice period for\n\nHMC to negotiate.” The jury sent a note during deliberations stating, “We need clarification of\n\n‘prior to selling’ wording [sic] is it before it’s sold, or before they even market & find a buyer.”\n\nIn response, the trial court submitted the following instruction, “You are instructed that Section\n\n14.02 of the lease did not require Keystone to immediately notify HMC upon deciding to sell the\n\nland, upon marketing the property or upon finding a buyer.”\n\n        HMC/Host initially argues that the original instruction was erroneous because it went\n\nfurther than simply tracking the language of Section 14.02. HMC/Host appears to be arguing\n\nthat the instruction was required to mirror the contractual language.                        The case cited by\n\nHMC/Host in support of its contention, however, is readily distinguishable. See Sterling Trust\n\nCo. v. Adderley, 168 S.W.3d 835, 846-47 (Tex. 2005). In Sterling Trust Co., the trial court\n\na waiver argument. In responding to a dissenting opinion, the majority of the court in J.M. Davidson, Inc., asserted,\n“Justice Schneider implies that, because the parties do not contend the agreement is ambiguous, we may not hold\nthat it is. This is contrary to Texas law.” 128 S.W.3d at 231.\n\n                                                       - 12 -\n\f                                                                                     04-10-00620-CV\n\n\nsubmitted an instruction to the jury listing three actions that would constitute a breach of\n\nfiduciary duty; however, the instruction failed to take into consideration the parties’ contractual\n\nagreement which expressly modified the nature of the fiduciary duty that was owed. Id.\n\n       Keystone responds that the instruction simply informed the jury of the proper\n\ninterpretation of Section 14.02, which the trial court had determined as a matter of law. “If the\n\nconstruction of a contract provision is in dispute, and the trial court resolves the dispute by\n\ninterpreting the provision (i.e., rather than by finding it ambiguous), the court should include its\n\ninterpretation in submitting the question on whether the contract was breached.” Union Natural\n\nGas Co. v. Enron Gas Marketing, Inc., 14-98-00183-CV, 2000 WL 350546, at *5 (Tex. App.—\n\nHouston [14th Dist.] Apr. 6, 2000, no pet.) (not designated for publication) (citing comment to\n\nTexas Pattern Jury Charges). We agree with this reasoning. Because the trial court interpreted\n\nthe contract as a matter of law, the jury was required to follow that interpretation. Accordingly,\n\nthe instruction accurately stated the law and assisted the jury.\n\n       The supplemental instruction is also a correct statement of the law. HMC/Host cites\n\ncases concluding that sometimes the submission of correct statements of the law is nonetheless\n\nan erroneous comment on the weight of the evidence. In this case, however, allowing the jury to\n\nresolve the question posed would have erroneously permitted the jury to decide a question of\n\nlaw. As a matter of law, based on the trial court’s interpretation of Section 14.02, the activities\n\nraised in the question by the jury would not result in a breach of Section 14.02. Instructing the\n\njury on that basis was not a comment on the weight of the evidence; it was an instruction on the\n\napplicable law.\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 13 -\n\f                                                                                              04-10-00620-CV\n\n\n                                            SLANDER OF TITLE\n\n        HMC/Host challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support various elements of\n\nKeystone’s slander of title claim arguing that Keystone offered “no evidence” to support those\n\nelements. 3 To prove slander of title, Keystone was required to show that HMC/Host published\n\nfalse statements maliciously, and these statements caused special damage to Keystone’s estate or\n\ninterest in land. See Santa Fe Energy Operating Partners, L.P. v. Carrillo, 948 S.W.2d 780, 785\n\n(Tex. App.—San Antonio 1997, writ denied).\n\n        We review a legal sufficiency or “no evidence” challenge under the well-established\n\nprinciples set forth in City of Keller v. Wilson, 168 S.W.3d 802, 827 (Tex. 2005). Reviewing the\n\nevidence in the light most favorable to the finding and indulging every inference that would\n\nsupport it, we sustain a no-evidence challenge only if: (1) the record reveals a complete absence\n\nof evidence of a vital fact; (2) the court is barred by rules of law or of evidence from giving\n\nweight to the only evidence offered to prove a vital fact; (3) the evidence offered to prove a vital\n\nfact is no more than a mere scintilla; or (4) the evidence establishes conclusively the opposite of\n\nthe vital fact. Id. at 810, 822. The trier of fact is the sole judge of the credibility of the witnesses\n\nand the weight to be given to their testimony. Id. at 819.\n\nA.      Publication\n\n        As previously noted, one of the elements of slander of title is the “publication” of a false\n\nstatement. Id. Santa Fe Energy Operating Partners, L.P., 948 S.W.2d at 785. It is undisputed\n\nthat Keystone provided HMC’s April 18 letter to Ashkenazy and the title companies. HMC/Host\n\nprovided the letter only to Keystone.\n\n\n\n\n3\n  Although HMC/Host makes reference to factual insufficiency in the heading of this issue, HMC/Host only argues\nthat Keystone offered “no evidence.”\n\n                                                    - 14 -\n\f                                                                                      04-10-00620-CV\n\n\n       Both parties briefed the publication issue based on the law governing self-publication\n\nwhich several intermediate courts, including this court, have recognized through the adoption of\n\nComment M to section 577 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts. See, e.g., Austin v. Inet Tech.,\n\nInc., 118 S.W.3d 491, 499 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2003, no pet.); Gonzales v. Levi Strauss & Co.,\n\n70 S.W.3d 278, 283 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2002, no pet.); AccuBanc Mortg. Corp. v.\n\nDrummonds, 938 S.W.2d 135, 147-48 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 1996, writ denied); Doe v.\n\nSmithKline Beecham Corp., 855 S.W.2d 248, 259 (Tex. App.—Austin 1993), aff’d as modified\n\non other grounds, 903 S.W.2d 347 (Tex. 1995). The problem with this approach, however, is\n\nthat the trial court denied Keystone’s requested jury charge relating to self-publication.\n\n       The jury charge, as submitted, asked, “Did Host Marriott slander Keystone’s title to the\n\nLand.” The jury charge then listed the five elements that were required to be proven to show\n\nslander of title, including, “the defendant publishes its false statement with legal malice.” The\n\njury charge defined “publishing” as “intentionally or negligently communicating the matter to a\n\nperson other than Keystone who is capable of understanding its meaning.” Keystone requested\n\nthat the jury also be instructed as follows, “If the circumstances indicate that communication to a\n\nthird party is reasonably forseeable, then it is proper to find that a publication occurred.” At the\n\nformal charge conference, Keystone’s attorney objected to the jury charge’s failure “to include\n\nan instruction regarding communications that a maker can reasonably foresee will be\n\ndisseminated to a third party.”\n\n       Based on the law, it is clear that Keystone was requesting an instruction on self-\n\npublication. The record is unclear, however, regarding the reason the trial court denied the\n\nrequest. The trial court could have denied the request believing that self-publication requires\n\nboth that the dissemination to a third party was reasonably foreseeable, and that the defamed\n\n\n\n                                                - 15 -\n\f                                                                                  04-10-00620-CV\n\n\nperson’s communication of the defamatory statements to the third person was made without an\n\nawareness of their defamatory nature. See, e.g., Austin, 118 S.W.3d at 499; Gonzales, 70 S.W.3d\n\nat 283; AccuBanc Mortg. Corp., 938 S.W.2d at 147-48; Doe, 855 S.W.2d at 259; but see\n\nChasewood Const. Co. v. Rico, 696 S.W.2d 439, 445-46 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 1985, writ\n\nref’d n.r.e.). Regardless of the trial court’s reasoning, neither party has complained on appeal\n\nthat the jury charge was erroneous as submitted.\n\n        More importantly for purposes of our analysis, neither party objected or requested an\n\nadditional instruction regarding the definition of the term “negligently communicating” as that\n\nterm was used in defining “publishing.” In considering whether the evidence supports the jury’s\n\nfinding with regard to the publication element of the slander of title claim, however, this court\n\nmust consider whether the jury could have believed that Host Marriott negligently published the\n\nApril 18 letter.\n\n        Comment K to the Restatement (Second) of Torts explains that a party’s communication\n\nto a third party is negligent “[i]f a reasonable person would recognize that an act creates an\n\nunreasonable risk that the defamatory matter will be communicated to a third person.”\n\nRESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS § 577 cmt. k (1977); see also Wheeler v. Methodist Hosp., 95\n\nS.W.3d 628, 639-40 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2002, no pet.) (citing comment k); First\n\nState Bank of Corpus Christi v. Ake, 606 S.W.2d 696, 701 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 1980,\n\nwrit ref’d n.r.e.) (citing comment k). Negligent publication exists where the speaker makes a\n\nstatement “expecting that the statement would have to be repeated” to a third party. Chasewood\n\nConst. Co., 696 S.W.2d at 449 (Reeves, J., dissenting).           Under negligent publication,\n\ncommunication to the third party rises to the level of necessity, i.e., the speaker’s words are\n\n\n\n\n                                              - 16 -\n\f                                                                                    04-10-00620-CV\n\n\nrequired to be repeated because of some necessity. Id. This is a far more stringent test than the\n\nreasonable foreseeability required in relation to self-publication under Comment M.\n\n       Although neither party requested that the jury be expressly instructed regarding the\n\ndefinition of negligent publication, Keystone’s attorney referred to negligent publication in his\n\nclosing argument as follows:\n\n               Did they utter and publish a disparaging comment about the plaintiff’s title\n       to property? Well, what does publish mean? Intentionally or negligently\n       communicating to a person other than Keystone.\n               Well, I’ve already argued until I’m blue in the face about what they knew\n       was going to happen when they sent that letter. And they knew we were going to\n       give it to them. And they could have expected that and they sure would have\n       wanted to get it. We believe that is negligently publishing it so that it goes to\n       third parties.\n\n       Ashkenazy’s attorney, David Kriss, testified that he believed Keystone was required to\n\ndisclose the April 18 letter. Moreover, as noted by Keystone’s attorney during oral argument,\n\nsection 5.5 of the Agreement for Sale and Purchase required Keystone to deliver to Ashkenazy\n\nany correspondence pertaining to the Lease. One of Keystone’s attorneys, Laura Sims, testified\n\nthat Keystone was required to forward the letter to all material parties to the transaction. Sims\n\nstated that Keystone had an obligation to send the letter to the buyer and the title companies or\n\nrisk being accused of fraud by concealing a material fact. Therefore, the evidence supports the\n\njury’s finding based on negligent publication.\n\nB.     Malice\n\n       Actual malice is characterized by ill-will, spite, evil motive, or purposing the injuring of\n\nanother. Continental Coffee Prods. Co. v. Cazarez, 937 S.W.2d 444, 452 (Tex. 1996). Implied\n\nor legal malice, on the other hand, exists when wrongful conduct is intentional and without just\n\ncause or excuse. Id. Slander of title requires proof of “legal malice,” which this court has\n\n\n\n\n                                                 - 17 -\n\f                                                                                     04-10-00620-CV\n\n\ndefined as “making false statements regarding title in absence of color of title or a reasonable\n\nbelief that parties have title.” Santa Fe Energy Operating Partners, L.P., 948 S.W.2d at 785.\n\n         HMC/Host contends malice is negated by the fact that it relied on an attorney’s advice in\n\nsending the letter. In Humble Oil & Refining Co. v. Luckel, 171 S.W.2d 902, 906 (Tex. Civ.\n\nApp.—Galveston 1943, writ ref’d w.o.m.), the court stated, “It is also well settled that a claim of\n\ntitle does not constitute malice where such claim is made under color of title upon the advice of\n\nattorneys, or upon reasonable belief that a party has title to the property acquired.” In order for\n\nthe advice of an attorney to negate legal malice, however, the claim still must be made under\n\ncolor of title. HMC/Host argues that no evidence was presented showing that it acted with legal\n\nmalice because asserting HMC/Host’s “§ 14.02 rights [was] a reasonable course of conduct\n\nunder the circumstances.” We disagree.\n\n         HMC/Host’s letter is based on its erroneous belief about the rights it had under Section\n\n14.02.    As previously discussed in relation to HMC/Host’s issues regarding the breach of\n\ncontract claim, however, the contract is unambiguous and is not “reasonably” susceptible to\n\nmore than one interpretation. Section 14.02 did not provide HMC/Host with a contractual right\n\nto exclusively negotiate with Keystone before Keystone negotiated with a third party.\n\nAccordingly, HMC/Host was not acting under color of title in claiming that Section 14.02\n\nentitled them to such a right. Moreover, Keystone had provided notice to HMC/Host on January\n\n7, 2005; however, HMC/Host’s letter demanded an additional ninety day period to negotiate\n\ndespite the fact that ninety days had elapsed since HMC/Host received notice and never made a\n\npurchase offer during that ninety day period. Because Section 14.02 unambiguously did not\n\nprovide HMC/Host the rights demanded in the April 18 letter, the evidence supports the jury’s\n\nfinding that HMC/Host was not acting under a color of title, but sent the letter maliciously.\n\n\n\n                                               - 18 -\n\f                                                                                      04-10-00620-CV\n\n\nC.      False Statement\n\n        To establish slander of title, the evidence must show that a “false” statement was\n\npublished.    Santa Fe Energy Operating Partners, L.P., 948 S.W.2d at 785.             If only true\n\nstatements are published, no cause of action for slander of title lies. McCarty v. Montgomery,\n\n290 S.W.3d 525, 540 (Tex. App.—Eastland 2009, pet. denied).\n\n        The assertion by HMC/Host that no false statements were published is again based on its\n\ncontention that it properly construed the Lease. Because we have held that the Lease did not\n\nprovide HMC/Host with a right to an exclusive negotiating period, the statements in the April 18\n\nletter were false.\n\nD.      Damages\n\n        The plaintiff must demonstrate the loss of a specific sale in order to recover for slander of\n\ntitle. Marrs & Smith P’ship v. D.K. Boyd Oil & Gas Co., 223 S.W.3d 1, 20 (Tex. App.—El Paso\n\n2005, pet. denied). The jury charge instructed that the damages to be awarded for slander of title\n\nwere “[t]he difference, if any, between the price for which the Land would have been sold to\n\nAshkenazy and the market value of the Land today, less the costs, if any, that Keystone would\n\nhave incurred in completing the sale.”\n\n        HMC/Host contends the evidence is insufficient to support the damage award because\n\nKeystone relied on a year-old appraisal as proof of the fair market value of the hotel land at the\n\ntime of trial. In Finch v. Finch, 825 S.W.2d 218, 223 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1992, no\n\nwrit), the appellant argued that a trial court could not consider an appraisal of real estate made\n\none year before the date of divorce in dividing real estate on the date of divorce. The Houston\n\ncourt rejected this argument. Id. The court first noted that the appellant cited no authority in\n\nsupport of the contention. Id. Similarly, no authority is cited by HMC/Host. Furthermore, the\n\n\n\n                                                - 19 -\n\f                                                                                      04-10-00620-CV\n\n\ncourt asserted, “whether an appraisal is near enough in time to the date of divorce to be\n\nconsidered in determining the value of the land in question is left to the discretion of the trial\n\ncourt.” Id. That discretion in this case was left to the jury in evaluating the weight to be given to\n\nthe appraisal in question.\n\n                                            CAUSATION\n\n       In its second issue, HMC/Host challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to prove\n\ncausation with regard to Keystone’s tortious interference claim and its slander of title claim.\n\n       More than one act may be the proximate cause of the same injury. Lee Lewis Const., Inc.\n\nv. Harrison, 70 S.W.3d 778, 784 (Tex. 2001). Proximate cause has two elements: cause in fact\n\nand foreseeability. Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld, L.L.P. v. Nat’l Dev. & Research Corp.,\n\n299 S.W.3d 106, 122 (Tex. 2009); Lee Lewis Const., Inc., 70 S.W.3d at 784. Cause in fact must\n\nbe established by proof that (1) the act or omission was a substantial factor in bringing about the\n\nharm at issue; and (2) absent the act or omission (“but for” the act or omission), the harm would\n\nnot have occurred. Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld, L.L.P., 299 S.W.3d at 122; Lee Lewis\n\nConst., Inc., 70 S.W.3d at 784. Proof of causation does not require the exclusion of all other\n\npossible causes, but rather requires a showing that the greater probability is that the act or\n\nomission in question caused the harm. City of Gladewater v. Pike, 727 S.W.2d 514, 518 (Tex.\n\n1987); Farley v. M M Cattle Co., 529 S.W.2d 751, 755-56 (Tex. 1975). A greater probability is\n\nshown when in the absence of other reasonable causal explanations it becomes more likely than\n\nnot that the injury was a result of the act or omission in question. Parker v. Employers Mut.\n\nLiability Ins. Co., 440 S.W.2d 43, 47 (Tex. 1969); Bradley v. Rogers, 879 S.W.2d 947, 954 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1994, writ denied).\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 20 -\n\f                                                                                                     04-10-00620-CV\n\n\n         The question presented in this sufficiency challenge is whether the letter sent by\n\nHMC/Host on April 18 caused the hotel property sale not to close or whether Keystone’s failure\n\nto meet the conditions of closing, i.e., delivery of an SNDA, 4 estoppel certificate, and waiver,\n\ncaused the transaction not to close.\n\n         Ashkenazy’s attorney, David Kriss, sent letters prior to the April 28th closing date\n\ninsisting on compliance with all of the required deliveries. Kriss testified, however, that the\n\nSNDA could have been waived, and the previously delivered estoppel certificate would have\n\nbeen acceptable if the title company had insured around the Section 14.02 issue. Kriss informed\n\nKeystone’s attorney that there was a difference between HMC/Host sitting back (suggesting the\n\n90 day argument would work) and sending the letter stating Keystone was in default. Kriss\n\ntestified that when he read the April 18 letter, he knew the deal was in trouble and that the letter\n\nwould impact the closing. Kriss also testified he could not say whether the deal failed to close\n\nbased on the letter or the lease provision. Kriss further testified that he was unsure if the letter\n\nmaterially impacted closing.           He was sure it had an impact, but could not speak for the\n\nunderwriter.\n\n         Ashkenazy did not recall seeing the April 18 letter, but agreed with Kriss on whether the\n\ndeal would close if the title companies insured over the Section 14.02 issue.\n\n         Barry Brown with HFF testified that the April 18 letter was intended to either delay the\n\ndeal or blow it up. When he saw the letter, he knew the deal was going south and that the title\n\ncompany would object. The letter was a major concern and a surprise given that the estoppel\n\ncertificate had been signed and returned. Brown compared the letter to a bomb.\n\n\n\n4\n  SNDA is an acronym for subordination, attornment, and non-disturbance agreement in which a tenant agrees to\nsubordinate its rights to the lender while the lender agrees not to terminate a lease upon foreclosure unless the lease\nis in default.\n\n                                                        - 21 -\n\f                                                                                     04-10-00620-CV\n\n\n          Gerdes testified that the April 18 letter was devastating and prevented the deal from\n\nclosing.\n\n          Keystone’s attorney, Laura Sims, acknowledged that the title company had listed a\n\nwaiver as a requirement in its original title commitment and that Kriss’s letters regarding the\n\nfailure to close listed the failure to deliver all of the required documents. Sims described the\n\nApril 18 letter as a “sucker punch” that ratcheted up the risk to the title company by making the\n\nrisk “live” and making it more difficult to write around. The letter caused the issue to go from\n\nbeing potential to actual. Sims testified that the title company would have insured around the\n\nSection 14.02 issue but for the letter.\n\n          Jennifer Flynn Maxwell, the closing agent for Land America, testified that the waiver\n\nwas always a requirement, and she did not believe the policy would issue without the waiver.\n\nMaxwell believed the April 18 letter changed things and was a substantial contributing factor in\n\nthe title company’s decisions. Maxwell testified that the discussions at Land America revolved\n\naround the April 18 letter.\n\n          Samuel Edward Smith, the commercial account manager for Fidelity, testified that\n\nFidelity was looking for a waiver because the title commitment was issued listing it as a\n\nrequirement on Schedule C. Smith also testified that the April 18 letter was a substantial\n\ncontributing factor in Fidelity’s decision not to insure; however, he later stated that Fidelity was\n\ngoing to have the issue regardless, and the waiver was needed both before and after the April 18\n\nletter.\n\n          As previously noted, we must defer to the jury’s role in judging the credibility of the\n\nwitnesses and the weight of the testimony and determine whether the evidence at trial enabled\n\nreasonable and fair-minded people to find that the April 18 letter proximately caused the sale to\n\n\n\n                                               - 22 -\n\f                                                                                       04-10-00620-CV\n\n\nAshkenazy not to close. See City of Keller v. Wilson, 168 S.W.3d at 827. Having reviewed the\n\nrecord as a whole, including the testimony summarized above, we hold that the evidence is\n\nsufficient to support the jury’s causation finding.\n\n                                 ABSOLUTE JUDICIAL PRIVILEGE\n\n       HMC/Host next contends the April 18 letter was protected by an absolute judicial\n\nprivilege. “Communications in the due course of a judicial proceeding will not serve as the basis\n\nof a civil action for libel or slander, regardless of the negligence or malice with which they are\n\nmade.” James v. Brown, 637 S.W.2d 914, 916 (Tex. 1982). “This privilege extends to any\n\nstatement made by the judge, jurors, counsel, parties or witnesses, and attaches to all aspects of\n\nthe proceedings, including statements made in open court, pre-trial hearings, depositions,\n\naffidavits and any of the pleadings or other papers in the case.” Id. at 916-17.\n\n       In Russell v. Clark, 620 S.W.2d 865, 868 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1981, writ ref’d n.r.e.), the\n\nDallas court noted, “Although Texas has not yet extended the doctrine of absolute privilege to\n\nout-of-court communications made by attorneys preliminary to a judicial proceeding, or in\n\nconnection therewith, we think the doctrine should be so extended. Public policy demands that\n\nattorneys be granted the utmost freedom in their efforts to represent their clients.” Persuaded by\n\nsection 586 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, which extended the privilege to attorneys with\n\nregard to communications preliminary to a proposed judicial proceeding, the Dallas court held\n\nthat such a privilege should be adopted. Id. at 869-70. Following Russell, several courts,\n\nincluding this court, have extended the privilege to out-of-court communications by an attorney\n\nif the statement has some relationship to a contemplated proceeding.               See, e.g., Daystar\n\nResidential, Inc. v. Collmer, 176 S.W.3d 24, 27-29 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2004, pet.\n\ndenied) (attorney’s statements to newspaper in reference to proposed lawsuit); Krishnan v. Law\n\n\n\n                                                - 23 -\n\f                                                                                     04-10-00620-CV\n\n\nOffices of Preston Henrichson, P.C., 83 S.W.3d 295, 302-03 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 2002,\n\npet. denied) (letter from attorney to doctor alleging he committed negligence; Bell v. Lee, 49\n\nS.W.3d 8, 10-12 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2001, no pet.) (letter from attorney to police officer\n\nwith copies to police department and city attorney threatening lawsuit for slanderous comments\n\nofficer made to a bank).\n\n       Unlike other courts, this court has held, “the privilege attaches if the statement has some\n\nrelationship to a contemplated proceeding, regardless of whether it in fact furthers the\n\nrepresentation.” Bell, 49 S.W.3d at 11; see also Daystar Residential, Inc., 176 S.W.3d at 27-28\n\n(requiring that the communication further the attorney’s representation, but noting Bell holds to\n\nthe contrary). This court has also recognized the following comments to section 586 of the\n\nRestatement (Second) of Torts:\n\n       As to communications preliminary to a proposed judicial proceeding the rule\n       stated in this Section applies only when the communication has some relation to a\n       proceeding that is contemplated in good faith and under serious consideration.\n       The bare possibility that the proceeding might be instituted is not to be used as a\n       cloak to provide immunity for defamation when the possibility is not seriously\n       considered.\n\nBell, 49 S.W.3d at 11 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts § 586 cmt. 3, at 248 (1977)); see\n\nalso DeLeon v. Eilers, No. 04-96-00497-CV, 1997 WL 81650, at *2 (Tex. App.—San Antonio\n\nFeb. 26, 1997, no writ) (not designated for publication) (quoting last sentence of comment).\n\n       Whether an alleged defamatory communication is related to a proposed judicial\n\nproceeding is a question of law. Daystar Residential, Inc., 176 S.W.3d at 28; Bell, 49 S.W.3d at\n\n10. All doubt is resolved in favor of the communication’s relation to the proceeding. Daystar\n\nResidential, Inc., 176 S.W.3d at 28; Bell, 49 S.W.3d at 10-11.\n\n       Keystone argues that the letter sent by HMC/Host does not qualify for the absolute\n\nprivilege because: (1) it was not sent by an attorney; and (2) it does not refer to litigation. With\n\n                                               - 24 -\n\f                                                                                      04-10-00620-CV\n\n\nregard to the first argument, HMC/Host cites cases in which the communication was not sent by\n\nan attorney. However, in Bird v. W.C.W., 868 S.W.2d 767, 768 (Tex. 1994), the affidavit was a\n\ndocument submitted directly to the court in a judicial proceeding; therefore, it was not an out-of-\n\ncourt communication. Similarly, in 5-State Helicopters, Inc. v. Cox, 146 S.W.3d 254, 258-59\n\n(Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2004, pet. denied), the letter was submitted directly to the FAA in a\n\nquasi-judicial proceeding relating to an on-going investigation and, thus, was not an out-of-court\n\ncommunication. Because the extension of the privilege to out-of-court communications is based\n\non the adoption of section 586 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts (which only pertains to\n\ncommunications by attorneys) and because the reason for the adoption of section 586 was a\n\npublic policy rationale in favor of attorneys as officers of the court, we disagree that the privilege\n\nextends to out-of-court communications by non-attorneys.\n\n       Moreover, the letter in question is written by HMC/Host regarding alleged violations of\n\nthe Lease as HMC/Host interpreted it. Although the letter demands that Keystone comply with\n\nthe Lease by taking certain actions, the letter never refers to a judicial proceeding. In Eilers,\n\n1997 WL 81650, at *1, this court considered whether the privilege extended to a letter written by\n\nan attorney to a chief of police. The attorney was retained by Julie Esparza, who claimed to be\n\nthe common-law wife of Valentine DeLeon and with whom she had purchased a truck prior to\n\nhis death. Id. The truck was being driven by a second woman also claiming to be the decedent’s\n\nwife. Id. The company that loaned Esparza the money to purchase the truck told her she would\n\nnot be relieved of liability under the purchase contract unless she reported the truck stolen. Id.\n\nEsparza hired an attorney who wrote a letter to the chief of police setting forth the facts and\n\nasserting the woman in possession of the truck did not have a valid claim to the truck and that the\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 25 -\n\f                                                                                      04-10-00620-CV\n\n\ntruck should be reported as stolen. Id. This court held that the letter was not privileged because\n\nit did not “refer to a judicial proceeding.” Id. at *2.\n\n        In addition to not referring to a judicial proceeding, the letter in this case does not\n\nsufficiently suggest that a judicial proceeding is under consideration. Although the letter might\n\nbe read to suggest that a judicial proceeding might be a possibility if the demands are not met,\n\nthis bare possibility is not sufficient to satisfy the applicable standard. See Bell, 49 S.W.3d at 11;\n\nEilers, 1997 WL 81650, at *2.\n\n                                           JUSTIFICATION\n\n        HMC/Host further asserts that Keystone’s tort claims fail as a matter of law because\n\nHMC/Host’s actions were justified in the exercise of its contractual rights.           Alternatively,\n\nHMC/Host contends it was exercising a colorable legal right in good faith as a matter of law.\n\n        The justification defense is based on either the exercise of: (1) one’s own legal rights; or\n\n(2) a good-faith claim to a colorable legal right, even though that claim ultimately proves to be\n\nmistaken. Tex. Beef Cattle Co. v. Green, 921 S.W.2d 203, 211 (Tex. 1996). If a trial court finds\n\nthat a defendant had a legal right to interfere with a contract, then the defendant has conclusively\n\nestablished the justification defense. Id. If the defendant cannot establish such a legal right as a\n\nmatter of law, the defendant may prevail on a justification defense if: (1) the trial court\n\ndetermines that the defendant interfered while exercising a colorable right; and (2) the jury finds\n\nthat, although mistaken, the defendant exercised that colorable legal right in good faith. Id.\n\nWhether the communication is the exercise of a colorable right, therefore, is a question of law for\n\nthe court. Prudential Ins. Co. of America v. Fin. Review Servs., Inc., 29 S.W.3d 74, 80 (Tex.\n\n2000). A right is colorable if it appears on its face to be genuine, truthful, valid, or existing.\n\nBennett v. Computer Assocs. Int’l, Inc., 932 S.W.2d 197, 202 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 1996, writ\n\n\n\n                                                 - 26 -\n\f                                                                                     04-10-00620-CV\n\n\ndenied). Good faith means having an objectively well-grounded and justifiable belief of a right.\n\nId. at 203.\n\n        As previously discussed in analyzing the sufficiency of the evidence to support the jury’s\n\nmalice finding in relation to the slander of title claim, the Lease is unambiguous and does not\n\nrequire the exclusive negotiation period as asserted by HMC/Host in the April 18 letter.\n\nAccordingly, HMC/Host’s letter was not an exercise of HMC/Host’s legal rights because the\n\nrights asserted did not exist. As a result, justification was not established as a matter of law. We\n\nfurther question the trial court’s submission of the justification defense to the jury because, as\n\npreviously discussed, HMC/Host was not exercising a colorable right.\n\n        Even if we consider the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury’s finding that\n\nHMC/Host was not acting in “good faith,” a party attempting to overcome an adverse fact\n\nfinding as a matter of law must surmount two hurdles. Hartmann v. Solbrig, 12 S.W.3d 587,\n\n595-96 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2000, pet. denied) (quoting Victoria Bank & Trust Co. v.\n\nBrady, 811 S.W.2d 931, 939 (Tex. 1991)). First, the record must be examined for evidence that\n\nsupports the fact finder’s finding, while ignoring evidence to the contrary. Id. Second, if there is\n\nno evidence to support the fact finder’s answer, then, the entire record must be examined to see if\n\nthe contrary proposition is established as a matter of law. Id.\n\n        In this case, the evidence was conflicting as to the intent of HMC and Host in sending the\n\nletter. The witnesses associated with HMC/Host testified that the letter was intended to protect\n\nits rights under the Lease. The witnesses associated with Keystone testified that the letter was a\n\n“sucker punch” sent in an effort to delay or blow up the deal. This later testimony is supported\n\nby Host’s delay in asserting its position and waiting until either on or after the 90th day from the\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 27 -\n\f                                                                                                  04-10-00620-CV\n\n\ndate it received Keystone’s notice to send the letter. 5 Furthermore, Burke’s testimony that he\n\nhad a problem with any allocation that was anything higher than HMC/Host’s determination of\n\nthe fair market value must be considered. Since we must first ignore evidence contrary to the\n\njury’s finding of no good faith, we must accept the jury’s decision to believe the witnesses\n\nassociated with Keystone.           Based on their testimony, the jury could have believed that\n\nHMC/Host was not acting in “good faith.”\n\n                                              ATTORNEYS’ FEES\n\n        In its final issue, HMC/Host challenges the award of attorney’s fees to Keystone\n\nasserting: (1) Keystone’s tort claims did not arise out of or concern the Lease; and (2) Keystone\n\nwas required to segregate its fees between claims for which such fees were recoverable (arose\n\nout of or concerned the Lease and on which Keystone prevailed) from fees that were not\n\nrecoverable (did not arise out of or concern the Lease or on which Keystone did not prevail).\n\nA.      Arise Out of or Concern Lease\n\n        Section 14.20 of the Lease authorizes the recovery of attorney’s fees by the prevailing\n\nparty in any legal action “arising out of or concerning the Lease or the rights of any party\n\nhereto.” See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 38.001 (West 2008) (authorizing recovery of\n\nattorney’s fees for contractual claims). Initially, we note that Keystone prevailed on HMC’s\n\nclaim that it breached the Lease. Moreover, Keystone’s tort claims arose out of or concerned\n\nHMC/Host’s allegation that the Lease provided it with certain rights. Although recovery was\n\nbased on the finding that HMC/Host did not have the rights it alleged, the litigation arose out of\n\nits contention that such rights existed under the Lease. Accordingly, Keystone was entitled to\n\nrecovery of attorney’s fees for its tort claims.\n\n5\n  Evidence was presented that in a subsequent letter from Gerdes, he made a reference to January 18 being the start\ndate for the 90-day period. Gerdes testified that the January 18 date was a typographical error and was intended to\nrefer to the January 7th date of Keystone’s notice letter to HMC.\n\n                                                      - 28 -\n\f                                                                                    04-10-00620-CV\n\n\nB.     Segregation\n\n       “[I]f any attorney’s fees relate solely to a claim for which such fees are unrecoverable, a\n\nclaimant must segregate recoverable from unrecoverable fees.” Tony Gullo Motors I, L.P. v.\n\nChapa, 212 S.W.3d 299, 313 (Tex. 2006). Because we hold that Keystone’s tortious interference\n\nand slander of title claims arise out of or concern the Lease, Keystone was not required to\n\nsegregate its fees because it did not assert a claim for which fees were unrecoverable.\n\n                                       PUNITIVE DAMAGES\n\n       In its cross-appeal, Keystone contends the trial court erred in granting HMC/Host’s\n\nmotion to disregard jury findings and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict as to the jury’s\n\nmalice finding. Keystone also challenges the trial court’s granting of HMC/Host’s motion as to\n\nthe jury’s finding that HMC authorized or ratified Host’s malice.\n\n       HMC/Host’s motion asserted several grounds challenging the sufficiency of the evidence\n\nto support the jury’s findings that: (1) HMC/Host was liable for slander of title; and (2)\n\nHMC/Host did not have a good faith belief that it had the right to send the April 18 letter which\n\nwas the question pertaining to HMC/Host’s justification defense. Because we have previously\n\nrejected those sufficiency challenges on appeal, the trial court could not have properly granted\n\nHMC/Host’s motion on those grounds. HMC/Host’s motion also asserted that: (1) the evidence\n\nwas legally insufficient to support the jury’s findings that the harm to Keystone resulted from\n\nmalice and that HMC authorized or ratified Host’s malice; and (2) the trial court improperly\n\ninstructed the jury during its deliberations. Keystone contends that because neither of those\n\ngrounds would support the trial court’s granting of HMC/Host’s motion, the motion was\n\nimproperly granted.\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 29 -\n\f                                                                                 04-10-00620-CV\n\n\nA.     Legal Sufficiency – Malice Finding\n\n       Question 16 asked the jury whether it found by clear and convincing evidence that the\n\nharm to Keystone found in Question 14 (the actual damages caused by the slander of title)\n\nresulted from malice. The jury was instructed that “clear and convincing evidence” meant “the\n\nmeasure or degree of proof that produces a firm belief or conviction of the truth of the\n\nallegations sought to be established.” The jury also was instructed that “malice” meant “a\n\nspecific intent by Host Marriott to cause substantial injury or harm to Keystone.” “Specific\n\nintent means that the actor desires to cause the consequences of his act, or he believes the\n\nconsequences are substantially certain to result from it.” In re Estate of Russell, 311 S.W.3d\n\n528, 535 (Tex. App.—El Paso 2009, no pet.); see also Rodriguez v. Naylor Indus., Inc., 763\n\nS.W.2d 411, 412 (Tex. 1998) (applying same definition to term intent). “[T]he term ‘substantial’\n\nhas two basic components: real vs. merely perceived, and significant vs. trivial.” Bennett v.\n\nReynolds, 315 S.W.3d 867, 872 (Tex. 2010).\n\n       To recover exemplary damages, Keystone had to present clear and convincing evidence\n\nthat (as defined in the court’s charge) Host Marriott’s conduct when viewed objectively from the\n\nstandpoint of Host Marriott at the time of its occurrence involved an extreme degree of risk,\n\nconsidering the probability and magnitude of the potential harm to others.          Qwest Int’l\n\nCommc’ns, Inc. v. AT&T Corp., 167 S.W.3d 324, 326 (Tex. 2005).              Because clear and\n\nconvincing evidence was required, “we review all the evidence in the light most favorable to the\n\njury’s finding, taking into account contrary undisputed facts, to determine whether reasonable\n\njurors could have formed a firm belief or conviction regarding malice.” Id. Circumstantial\n\nevidence can be sufficient to prove malice. Nast v. State Farm Fire & Cas. Co., 82 S.W.3d 114,\n\n125 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2002, no pet.).\n\n\n\n                                             - 30 -\n\f                                                                                     04-10-00620-CV\n\n\n       HMC/Host argues that the trial court properly disregarded the jury’s malice finding\n\nbecause it was merely exercising its contractual rights.         This argument is similar to its\n\njustification defense. HMC/Host argues there was “an honest difference of opinion as to the\n\ninterpretation or legal effect of” the Lease, and “the sincere pursuance of a claimed legal right\n\nunder [a] contract by one of the parties cannot form the basis of an award of punitive damages.”\n\nExxon Corp. v. Bell, 695 S.W.2d 788, 790-91 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 1985, no writ). Keystone\n\ncounters that the contractual rights were clear, and the jury could imply malice because\n\nHMC/Host knew or should have known it did not have a contractual right to require the type of\n\nnotice of the sale that it demanded. First Interstate Bank of Ariz., N.A. v. Interfund Corp., 924\n\nF.2d 588, 596 (5th Cir. 1991).\n\n       We initially note that in the case HMC/Host cites in support of its argument, the court\n\nheld that the contract in question was ambiguous before addressing the malice finding. Exxon\n\nCorp., 695 S.W.2d at 790. The court concluded that a term that was in dispute was reasonably\n\nsusceptible to both parties’ interpretation. Id. In this case, however, we previously held that the\n\nLease is not ambiguous because it is not reasonably susceptible to more than one interpretation.\n\nMoreover, as indicated above in addressing the sufficiency points, the evidence regarding\n\nHMC/Host’s intent was conflicting. Given the language of the Lease, the language of the April\n\n18 letter, the timing of the April 18 letter, and the testimony, we hold the evidence was sufficient\n\nfor the jury to have formed a firm belief or conviction that Host Marriott had a specific intent to\n\ncause substantial injury or harm to Keystone. Accordingly, the trial court would have erred in\n\ngranting HMC/Host’s motion on this basis.\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 31 -\n\f                                                                                      04-10-00620-CV\n\n\nB.     Jury Communication\n\n       Keystone also contends that the trial court could not have granted a judgment\n\nnotwithstanding the verdict on the basis of improper communication with the jury. The record\n\nestablishes that when the bailiff initially brought the jury’s verdict to the trial judge, the trial\n\njudge looked the verdict over and instructed the bailiff to take it back to the jury. When the jury\n\nwas being brought into the courtroom after it reached its verdict, the trial judge informed the\n\nattorneys that the jury had not answered a couple of the questions and that the trial judge had\n\nasked them to answer the questions. HMC/Host argued that the returning of the verdict was\n\nimproper under Rule 295 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure which provides that if the jury’s\n\nverdict is incomplete, “the court shall in writing instruct the jury in open court of the nature of\n\nthe incompleteness . . . , provide the jury such additional instructions as may be proper, and retire\n\nthe jury for further deliberations.” TEX. R. CIV. P. 295.\n\n       Rule 301 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure permits a trial court to render a judgment\n\nnotwithstanding the verdict “if a directed verdict would have been proper.” TEX. R. CIV. P. 301.\n\nFurthermore, Rule 301 permits a trial court to “disregard any jury’s finding on a question that\n\nhas no support in the evidence.” Id.\n\n       On appeal, Keystone argues that HMC/Host’s complaint about the trial judge returning\n\nthe jury’s verdict cannot be made in a motion to disregard. HMC/Host responds that a judgment\n\nnotwithstanding the verdict can be granted if a legal principle bars recovery. One of the cases\n\ncited by HMC/Host to support its contention is McIntyre v. Comm’n for Lawyer Discipline, 247\n\nS.W.3d 434 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2008, pet. denied). In that case, the court does state, “A motion\n\nfor jnov should be granted when (1) the evidence is conclusive and one party is entitled to\n\nrecover as a matter of law or (2) a legal principle precludes recovery.” Id. at 441. The court\n\n\n\n                                                - 32 -\n\f                                                                                  04-10-00620-CV\n\n\nprefaces this statement, however, by stating, “A jnov is proper when a directed verdict would\n\nhave been proper.” Id.; see also Fort Bend Drainage Dist. v. Sbrusch, 818 S.W.2d 392, 394\n\n(Tex. 1991) (“A court may render a judgment n.o.v. if a directed verdict would have been\n\nproper.”). Reading the statements in context, a judgment notwithstanding the verdict is proper if\n\na directed verdict would have been proper because a legal principle bars recovery. See AMS\n\nConst. Co. v. K.H.K. Scaffolding Houston, Inc., No. 01-09-00360-CV, 2011 WL 1598745, at 8\n\n(Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] Apr. 28, 2011, pet. abated); see also Schindley v. Northeast Tex.\n\nCmty. Coll., 13 S.W.3d 62, 65 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2000, pet. denied) (noting judgment\n\nnotwithstanding the verdict is appropriate when “as a matter of law, the claim or defense\n\npresented is not viable and should never have been presented to the jury”).\n\n       HMC/Host’s reliance on the propriety of a directed verdict on the issue of improper jury\n\ncommunication is erroneous for several reasons. First, a motion for directed verdict “is a\n\nprocedural device to ask the court to render judgment without submitting the charge to the jury\n\nbecause there is nothing for the jury to decide.”       Michael O’Connor & Byron P. Davis,\n\nO’Connor’s Texas Rules – Civil Trials 659 (2011). HMC/Host’s complaint in this instance is not\n\nthat the questions should not have been submitted to the jury. Rather, HMC/Host’s complaint is\n\nthat the trial judge’s communication with the jury after the questions were submitted was\n\nimproper.    Moreover, the complaint raised by HMC/Host pertaining to improper jury\n\ncommunication would not “bar” recovery such that the trial court could render judgment on that\n\nbasis. At most, improper jury communication could, if proven, entitle HMC/Host to a new trial.\n\nAccordingly, the trial court could not have properly granted a judgment notwithstanding the\n\nverdict and thereby rendered judgment in favor of HMC/Host on Keystone’s punitive damages\n\nclaim on the basis that the trial court improperly communicated with the jury.\n\n\n\n                                              - 33 -\n\f                                                                                    04-10-00620-CV\n\n\nC.     Liability of HMC\n\n       Keystone also argues that both Host and HMC should be held liable for the punitive\n\ndamages. Keystone contends the trial court improperly disregarded the jury’s finding that HMC\n\nauthorized or ratified the malice by Host.\n\n       A corporation is liable for punitive damages if it authorizes or ratifies an agent’s malice.\n\nMobil Oil Corp. v. Ellender, 968 S.W.2d 917, 921 (Tex. 1998). “In Texas for purposes of legal\n\nproceedings, subsidiary corporations and parent corporations are separate and distinct ‘persons’\n\nas a matter of law.” Valero South Tex. Processing Co. v. Starr County Appraisal Dist., 954\n\nS.W.2d 863, 866 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 1997, pet. denied).             Accordingly, a subsidiary\n\ncorporation could be an agent of its parent if the evidence supported such a finding.\n\n       The jury charge defined the term agent as “one who acts with the party’s authority or\n\napparent authority.” The jury was further instructed that the principal must agree that the agent\n\nact on its behalf and for its benefit, and if the agent is authorized, the agent may do whatever is\n\nproper, usual, and necessary to perform the act expressly authorized. Finally, the jury was\n\ninstructed that apparent authority exists if a party: (1) knowingly permits another to hold himself\n\nout as having authority; or (2) through lack of ordinary care, bestows on another such indications\n\nof authority that lead a reasonably prudent person to rely on the apparent existence of authority\n\nto his detriment. Only the acts of the party sought to be charged with responsibility for the\n\nconduct of another may be considered in determining whether apparent authority exists.\n\n       Daniel Burke testified that HMC is a wholly owned subsidiary of Host. HMC is the\n\ntenant under the ground lease; however, the April 18 letter was sent by Host. Burke testified that\n\nHost was making decisions for itself and for HMC regarding the transaction. Burke testified that\n\nHost was acting as an agent for HMC. Accordingly, this testimony was sufficient evidence to\n\n\n\n                                               - 34 -\n\f                                                                                    04-10-00620-CV\n\n\nsupport the jury’s finding that Host was acting as HMC’s agent and authorized or ratified Host’s\n\nmalice.\n\nD.        Conclusion\n\n          The record provided no proper basis for the trial court to grant HMC/Host’s motion for\n\njudgment notwithstanding the verdict.\n\n                                             CONCLUSION\n\n          The portion of the trial court’s judgment granting HMC/Host’s Motion to Disregard Jury\n\nFindings and for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict as to Question Nos. 16 and 17 is\n\nreversed, and judgment is rendered that Keystone shall have and recover $5,000,000 in punitive\n\ndamages against Host Marriot and $2,500,000 in punitive damages against HMC. The remainder\n\nof the trial court’s judgment is affirmed.\n\n                                                   Catherine Stone, Chief Justice\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 35 -\n\f",

Keystone-\n\nTexas Property Holding Corp. owned the mall and the land underlying the hotel. HMC Hotel\n\nProperties II Limited Partnership leased the land underlying the hotel from Keystone pursuant to\n\na long-term ground lease.        HMC sued Keystone for breach of the lease.          Keystone filed\n\ncounterclaims against HMC for slander of title and tortious interference with an agreement\n\f                                                                                  04-10-00620-CV\n\n\nKeystone had with a third party to purchase the property. Keystone also asserted the same\n\nclaims against HMC’s parent corporation, Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. f/k/a Host Marriott\n\nCorporation and Host Hotels & Resorts, L.P. f/k/a Host Marriott, L.P. A jury rejected HMC’s\n\nbreach of contract claim, and instead found in favor of Keystone on both of its claims.\n\nHMC/Host appealed the resulting judgment raising numerous issues, and Keystone filed a cross-\n\nappeal.\n\n                                         BACKGROUND\n\n          In 1992, the Pennsylvania Public School Employees’ Retirement System (PSERS)\n\nacquired both the land underlying the Marriott Rivercenter Hotel, subject to HMC’s ground\n\nlease, and Rivercenter Mall. PSERS formed Keystone as a subsidiary to own the property. L&B\n\nRealty Advisors was retained to manage the property. In 2000, PSERS decided to sell its direct-\n\nowned real estate.\n\n          In October of 2003, Michael Grubic, the portfolio manager with PSERS responsible for\n\noverseeing L&B’s actions relating to the Rivercenter property, contacted John Gerdes, the\n\nexecutive vice-president with L&B in charge of the Rivercenter property, and urged him to\n\nconsider whether Keystone should sell the property. Grubic contacted Gerdes after learning that\n\na mall in Maine had sold for a very good price. Based on recommendations by Grubic’s\n\nsupervisor, on April 27, 2004, the PSERS board of directors authorized the property to be\n\nmarketed for sale. In June of 2004, Keystone retained a law firm to represent it in the marketing\n\nand potential sale of the property. In July of 2004, Holliday, Feloglio, and Fowler (“HFF”), an\n\ninvestment brokerage firm, was retained to market the property. HFF decided to use a marketing\n\nprice of $170-180 million and believed the property would sell for $155-165 million.\n\n\n\n\n                                              -2-\n\f                                                                                    04-10-00620-CV\n\n\n           An offering memorandum was prepared and sent to a list of potential investors.\n\nHost/HMC was not on the list. Based on the offers received, L&B recommended that PSERS\n\naccept an offer made by Ashkenazy Acquisition Corporation for $175 million. Ashkenazy had\n\nrecently sold other real property and needed to close on the sale by December 31, 2004, in order\n\nfor the capital tax on the prior sale to be deferred pursuant to a section 1031 exchange. After the\n\nrecommendation was made that the PSERS board approve the offer by Ashkenazy, Ashkenazy\n\nhad “buyer’s remorse” about the price. Although the PSERS board approved a reduction in price\n\nto $165 million, the sale was not closed because Ashkenazy pursued a different asset,\n\npresumably to ensure the timing of his section 1031 exchange. HFF extended the deadline for\n\noffers based on the prior memorandum. Ashkenazy was again recommended as the proposed\n\npurchaser for $166 million. In December of 2004, the parties exchanged drafts of a letter of\n\nintent, and L&B received a $1 million escrow deposit on December 31, 2004.\n\n           Also in December 2004, following communication between Gerdes and Grubic, Gerdes\n\ndetermined that notice was required to be sent to HMC under section 14.02 of the ground lease\n\nwhich was entitled “Tenant’s First Right of Negotiation.” 1 Gerdes based the notice letter on a\n\nsimilar letter sent to HMC in connection with PSERS’s purchase in 1992. Recognizing that\n\nHMC had requested an allocation of the purchase price between the mall property and the hotel\n\nproperty in 1992, Ashkenazy was asked to make an allocation of the $166 million purchase\n\nprice. Ashkenazy allocated $65 million to the hotel property.\n\n           On January 7, 2005, Keystone sent HMC a letter notifying it of the pending sale of the\n\nhotel land to Ashkenazy for $65 million. The letter stated the sale was expected to close in\n\nseventy-five days. The letter further stated that HMC had a period of thirty days to notify\n\n\n\n1\n    Section 14.02 is quoted, in pertinent part, on pages 5-6 of this opinion.\n\n                                                            -3-\n\f                                                                                   04-10-00620-CV\n\n\nKeystone of its intent to negotiate a purchase of the hotel land; however, Keystone requested that\n\nHMC sign a waiver of its rights to enable Keystone to proceed with the sale.\n\n       On February 1, 2005, Daniel Burke, the vice-president for asset management for Host,\n\nemailed Gerdes requesting more information about the specifics of the deal. After Gerdes and\n\nBurke spoke on February 8, 2005, Burke sent Gerdes an email dated February 11, 2005,\n\nexpressing a potential interest in negotiating, stating HMC was unprepared to waive its rights,\n\nand requesting additional information. Burke informed Gerdes that Host believed the value of\n\nthe hotel land was around $30 million. At that time, the sale of both the mall property and the\n\nhotel land was scheduled to close on March 28, 2005 (this date was important to Ashkenazy for\n\nanother section 1031 deadline). On February 23, 2005, Gerdes sent Burke an email asking Burke\n\nto confirm whether he had received the requested information. Burke acknowledged receiving\n\nthe information and informed Gerdes he would get back with him regarding a timeline.\n\n       In order to meet the section 1031 deadline, a decision was made to split the closing of the\n\nsale of the mall and the sale of the hotel land. The agreements contained a “clawback” provision\n\nthat would enable Keystone to reacquire the mall if Ashkenazy defaulted on his purchase of the\n\nhotel land. The mall sale closed on March 29, 2005, and the sale of the hotel land was scheduled\n\nto close on April 28, 2005.\n\n       On March 17, 2005, Burke sent Gerdes an email stating that the waiver was close to\n\nbeing signed and sent back. Burke stated that he would like to speak with Ashkenazy and\n\nrequested that Gerdes facilitate the contact. Burke stated that after he spoke with Ashkenazy, he\n\nwould send the waiver back promptly.\n\n       Gerdes promptly contacted Ashkenazy to facilitate a meeting. Burke and another Host\n\nexecutive, Andrew Bruce Lewis, met with Ashkenazy, and Ashkenazy entertained the thought of\n\n\n\n                                               -4-\n\f                                                                                   04-10-00620-CV\n\n\nflipping the hotel land to Host.     At a subsequent meeting between Ashkenazy and Lewis,\n\nhowever, Ashkenazy explained that the financing of the transaction would not permit him to flip\n\nthe land. Based on these meetings, HMC/Host developed the opinion that the allocation of the\n\npurchase price was a sham intended to get HMC/Host out of the way as an impediment to the\n\nsale. Although HMC/Host formulated this opinion and believed that Section 14.02 of the lease\n\nhad been violated, HMC/Host did not share this opinion with Keystone.\n\n       On April 15, 2005, HMC signed an estoppel certificate stating that the lease was not in\n\ndefault. Around this same time, Ashkenazy’s lender requested a different estoppel certificate\n\nform that contained language waiving the Section 14.02 first right of negotiation.          Gerdes\n\ncontinued to request updates from Burke and received one message in which Burke stated that\n\nHost’s acquisition people were supposed to contact Gerdes to discuss a purchase.\n\n       Finally, on April 18, 2005, Host sent a letter to Keystone stating that Keystone was in\n\ndefault under Section 14.02. Host demanded an additional 90-day period in which to negotiate\n\nthe purchase of the hotel land. The sale of the hotel land to Ashkenazy, which was scheduled to\n\noccur on April 28, 2005, did not close, and the underlying litigation ensued.\n\n                                  SECTION 14.02 OF THE LEASE\n\n       Section 14.02 of the ground lease to HMC (“Lease”) entitled “Tenant’s First Right of\n\nNegotiation” provides, in pertinent part:\n\n               If Landlord decides to sell the Leased Premises to a third party, Landlord\n       will give Tenant notice of such decision and afford Tenant a reasonable period of\n       time as specified in such notice, but in no event more than ninety (90) days, in\n       which to attempt to negotiate a mutually satisfactory agreement for purchase of\n       the Leased Premises. If after expiration of ninety (90) days following the date of\n       Landlord’s notice of its desire to sell the Leased Premises Landlord and Tenant\n       are not able or willing to enter into a mutually acceptable agreement for purchase\n       of the Leased Premises, Landlord shall be free to sell the Leased Premises to a\n       third party at a sales price and upon financing arrangements, if any, not more\n       favorable to such third party than Landlord was willing to sell the Leased\n\n                                               -5-\n\f                                                                                   04-10-00620-CV\n\n\n       Premises to Tenant and subject to the following further condition: Landlord shall\n       give Tenant notice of the proposed sale of the Leased Premises, which notice shall\n       disclose the identity of the proposed purchaser and all information regarding such\n       purchaser and all material information regarding the terms and conditions of such\n       sale.\n\n\nThe first question submitted to the jury asked whether Keystone failed to comply with Section\n\n14.02 of the Lease. The jury was instructed that Section 14.02 required that Keystone notify\n\nHMC sufficiently prior to selling the hotel land to permit a proper notice period for HMC to\n\nnegotiate. The jury answered “no.”\n\n       In its first issue, HMC/Host contends the jury’s answer to Question No. 1 was fatally\n\nflawed because the trial court’s construction of Section 14.02 was incorrect as a matter of law,\n\nand the evidence conclusively established that Keystone breached the Lease. Alternatively,\n\nHMC/Host asserts: (1) Section 14.02 is ambiguous requiring a new trial; or (2) the trial court’s\n\nerroneous instructions relating to Question No. 1 require a new trial.       In its cross-appeal,\n\nKeystone contends the trial court erred in failing to enter a declaratory judgment that Section\n\n14.02 is unenforceable as a matter of law.\n\nA.     Enforceability of Section 14.02\n\n       Whether a particular agreement is legally enforceable is a question of law reviewed de\n\nnovo. Martin v.

Such an agreement to negotiate is unenforceable\n\nbecause “[t]here would be no way by which the court could determine what sort of a contract the\n\nnegotiations would result in, no rule by which the court could ascertain whether any, or, if so,\n\nwhat damages might follow a refusal to enter into such future contract.” Radford, 104 S.W.2d at\n\n474-75.\n\n       Generally, the cases are fairly clear in applying the law that an agreement to negotiate in\n\nthe future is unenforceable because the terms are insufficiently definite to enable a court to\n\nascertain damages. For example, in Radford, the court considered whether a commission was\n\nowed to a realtor where the contract provided for payment of the commission upon the making of\n\na lease “on such terms, or such others as I may accept.” 104 S.W.2d at 473. The court held that\n\nsince the contract between the lessor and the lessee was subject to the lessor negotiating and\n\nagreeing to the terms, the agreement was too indefinite to enforce where no actual lease was\n\nsigned. Id. at 474. Similarly, in Maranatha Temple, Inc., the oral agreement in question stated\n\nthat an individual was to meet with a company’s representatives in good faith to address a\n\nproblem. 893 S.W.2d at 104. The court held that the parties had agreed to do nothing more than\n\nenter into good faith negotiations in the future concerning what to do about the problem. Id.\n\n       Finally, and most similar to the facts of the instant case, in Martin, two shareholders\n\nreached a settlement agreement containing multiple provisions, including a provision stating that\n\nthey would negotiate a shareholder agreement in good faith for sixty days (later extended to\n\n\n\n                                               -7-\n\f                                                                                     04-10-00620-CV\n\n\nninety days) that would be applicable to all shareholders. 326 S.W.3d at 744, 747-48. Because\n\nthe shareholders never agreed on the content of a shareholder agreement, such an agreement was\n\nnever executed. Id. at 748. One of the two shareholders, Ruben, argued that the agreement\n\nrequired the shareholders to both negotiate and reach a shareholder agreement in order for the\n\nsettlement agreement to be enforceable. Id. at 749. The other shareholder, Scott, argued that the\n\nobligation was simply to negotiate, and the settlement agreement was still enforceable even\n\nthough no shareholder agreement was signed. Id. at 750. The court rejected Scott’s argument,\n\nconcluding:\n\n               Scott’s argument, though creative, does not conform to Texas law. The\n       shareholder agreement must be executed, not merely negotiated. The agreement\n       itself supports this conclusion. Paragraph one states that the brothers “will\n       negotiate a shareholder agreement” that “will be applicable to all shareholders.”\n       Since the goal of negotiation is agreement, if the parties are required to “negotiate\n       an agreement,” they must necessarily and ultimately conclude with a negotiated\n       agreement. Otherwise, the parties have only attempted to negotiate an agreement.\n       Additionally, paragraph one contains obligatory language which supports the\n       conclusion that its terms require the execution of a shareholder agreement. It\n       requires that (the shareholder agreement) “will provide,” “will contain,” and “will\n       require.” Imperative statements such as these envision the object to be\n       accomplished will, in fact, be accomplished. In failing to negotiate a shareholder\n       agreement, the parties fell short of accomplishing this goal. Thus, the completion\n       date--meaning completion “of all of the obligations under this Settlement\n       Agreement”--was not reached because the obligation of executing a shareholder\n       agreement was not completed. Without a completion date, Ruben contends the\n       agreement is merely an agreement to agree in the future, which is not legally\n       binding.\n\nId. at 751. The court agreed with Ruben’s argument. After concluding that the shareholder\n\nagreement was an essential provision of the overall agreement, the court concluded, “Because\n\nthe settlement agreement leaves this essential provision open for future agreement that never\n\noccurred, it is not binding and merely constitutes an agreement to agree in the future.” Id. at 754.\n\nAccordingly, the court held the settlement agreement was unenforceable as a matter of law. Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                                -8-\n\f                                                                                    04-10-00620-CV\n\n\n       Section 14.02 of the Lease is distinguishable from the settlement agreement in Martin in\n\none very important detail. Section 14.02 recognizes on its face that an actual agreement may not\n\nresult from the negotiations. The goal of the negotiations required by Section 14.02 is, therefore,\n\nnot an actual enforceable agreement. Instead, the goal of the negotiations is to establish the\n\nterms on which the HMC was willing to purchase the hotel land. The establishment of these\n\nterms is important in and of itself because those terms would establish a threshold below which\n\nKeystone could not go in selling the property to a third party. Under Section 14.02, Keystone\n\nwas free to sell to a third party only at a sales price not more favorable than the sales price\n\nestablished in the negotiations between HMC and Keystone. As a result, a court could readily\n\ndetermine whether Keystone breached Section 14.02 by selling to a third party on more\n\nfavorable terms. Because the terms of Section 14.02 are sufficiently definite to enable a court to\n\nunderstand the parties’ obligations thereunder, the trial court properly determined that Section\n\n14.02 was enforceable.

HMC/Host argues that notice was required to be\n\nprovided before Keystone hired consultants to market and solicit bids. HMC/Host strenuously\n\nargues that notice was required before Keystone targeted a potential buyer and agreed to\n\nnegotiate exclusively with that buyer.      Finally, HMC/Host asserts Section 14.02 required\n\nKeystone to negotiate with HMC before it negotiated with third parties.\n\n       On the other hand, Keystone contends that notice was not required until a decision was\n\nmade to sell to an identified third-party buyer. Keystone asserts Section 14.02 contains no\n\nlanguage requiring it to exclusively negotiate with HMC, and courts cannot “rewrite agreements\n\nto insert provisions parties could have included or to imply restraints for which they have not\n\nbargained.” Tenneco, Inc. v.

We are persuaded by the language following the effect of the\n\ninability or unwillingness of Keystone and HMC to enter into a mutually acceptable agreement.\n\nSection 14.02 provides that in such an event, “Landlord shall be free to sell the Leased Premises\n\nto a third party . . . .” (emphasis added). If Keystone was required to negotiate exclusively with\n\nHMC, this provision would have read, “Landlord shall be free to negotiate the sale of the Leased\n\nPremises to a third party . . . .” We are also persuaded by Keystone’s argument regarding an\n\nidentified third party. If the third party and the potential terms of a sale are unknown, how could\n\nthe Landlord “decide” to “sell” the hotel land to a third party? In the absence of a known\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 10 -\n\f                                                                                               04-10-00620-CV\n\n\npurchaser and price, the Landlord might have decided to negotiate the sale of the hotel land, but\n\ncertainly could not have decided to sell it.\n\n        Finally, HMC/Host’s interpretation would raise concerns with the following scenario: a\n\nthird-party purchaser unexpectedly approaches Keystone and offers to purchase the property for\n\n$1 billion.    Keystone could immediately “decide” to “sell” the hotel land to that person;\n\nhowever, there would have been no opportunity for prior notice and negotiation with HMC. As a\n\nresult, according to HMC/Host’s interpretation, Keystone would be in breach of Section 14.02.\n\nThis necessarily would be inconsistent with the true intentions of the parties.\n\nC.      Ambiguity\n\n        In an alternative argument, HMC/Host contends Section 14.02 is ambiguous; therefore, a\n\nnew trial is necessary.

HMC/Host appears to be arguing\n\nthat the instruction was required to mirror the contractual language.                        The case cited by\n\nHMC/Host in support of its contention, however, is readily distinguishable. See Sterling Trust\n\nCo. v.

Id.\n\n       Keystone responds that the instruction simply informed the jury of the proper\n\ninterpretation of Section 14.02, which the trial court had determined as a matter of law. “If the\n\nconstruction of a contract provision is in dispute, and the trial court resolves the dispute by\n\ninterpreting the provision (i.e., rather than by finding it ambiguous), the court should include its\n\ninterpretation in submitting the question on whether the contract was breached.” Union Natural\n\nGas Co. v.

HMC/Host cites\n\ncases concluding that sometimes the submission of correct statements of the law is nonetheless\n\nan erroneous comment on the weight of the evidence. In this case, however, allowing the jury to\n\nresolve the question posed would have erroneously permitted the jury to decide a question of\n\nlaw. As a matter of law, based on the trial court’s interpretation of Section 14.02, the activities\n\nraised in the question by the jury would not result in a breach of Section 14.02. Instructing the\n\njury on that basis was not a comment on the weight of the evidence; it was an instruction on the\n\napplicable law.\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 13 -\n\f                                                                                              04-10-00620-CV\n\n\n                                            SLANDER OF TITLE\n\n        HMC/Host challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support various elements of\n\nKeystone’s slander of title claim arguing that Keystone offered “no evidence” to support those\n\nelements. 3 To prove slander of title, Keystone was required to show that HMC/Host published\n\nfalse statements maliciously, and these statements caused special damage to Keystone’s estate or\n\ninterest in land.

The problem with this approach, however, is\n\nthat the trial court denied Keystone’s requested jury charge relating to self-publication.\n\n       The jury charge, as submitted, asked, “Did Host Marriott slander Keystone’s title to the\n\nLand.” The jury charge then listed the five elements that were required to be proven to show\n\nslander of title, including, “the defendant publishes its false statement with legal malice.” The\n\njury charge defined “publishing” as “intentionally or negligently communicating the matter to a\n\nperson other than Keystone who is capable of understanding its meaning.” Keystone requested\n\nthat the jury also be instructed as follows, “If the circumstances indicate that communication to a\n\nthird party is reasonably forseeable, then it is proper to find that a publication occurred.” At the\n\nformal charge conference, Keystone’s attorney objected to the jury charge’s failure “to include\n\nan instruction regarding communications that a maker can reasonably foresee will be\n\ndisseminated to a third party.”\n\n       Based on the law, it is clear that Keystone was requesting an instruction on self-\n\npublication. The record is unclear, however, regarding the reason the trial court denied the\n\nrequest. The trial court could have denied the request believing that self-publication requires\n\nboth that the dissemination to a third party was reasonably foreseeable, and that the defamed\n\n\n\n                                                - 15 -\n\f                                                                                  04-10-00620-CV\n\n\nperson’s communication of the defamatory statements to the third person was made without an\n\nawareness of their defamatory nature.

Co., 696 S.W.2d at 449 (Reeves, J., dissenting).

Id. This is a far more stringent test than the\n\nreasonable foreseeability required in relation to self-publication under Comment M.\n\n       Although neither party requested that the jury be expressly instructed regarding the\n\ndefinition of negligent publication, Keystone’s attorney referred to negligent publication in his\n\nclosing argument as follows:\n\n               Did they utter and publish a disparaging comment about the plaintiff’s title\n       to property? Well, what does publish mean? Intentionally or negligently\n       communicating to a person other than Keystone.\n               Well, I’ve already argued until I’m blue in the face about what they knew\n       was going to happen when they sent that letter. And they knew we were going to\n       give it to them. And they could have expected that and they sure would have\n       wanted to get it. We believe that is negligently publishing it so that it goes to\n       third parties.\n\n       Ashkenazy’s attorney, David Kriss, testified that he believed Keystone was required to\n\ndisclose the April 18 letter. Moreover, as noted by Keystone’s attorney during oral argument,\n\nsection 5.5 of the Agreement for Sale and Purchase required Keystone to deliver to Ashkenazy\n\nany correspondence pertaining to the Lease. One of Keystone’s attorneys, Laura Sims, testified\n\nthat Keystone was required to forward the letter to all material parties to the transaction. Sims\n\nstated that Keystone had an obligation to send the letter to the buyer and the title companies or\n\nrisk being accused of fraud by concealing a material fact. Therefore, the evidence supports the\n\njury’s finding based on negligent publication.\n\nB.     Malice\n\n       Actual malice is characterized by ill-will, spite, evil motive, or purposing the injuring of\n\nanother. Continental Coffee Prods. Co. v.

Implied\n\nor legal malice, on the other hand, exists when wrongful conduct is intentional and without just\n\ncause or excuse. Id. Slander of title requires proof of “legal malice,” which this court has\n\n\n\n\n                                                 - 17 -\n\f                                                                                     04-10-00620-CV\n\n\ndefined as “making false statements regarding title in absence of color of title or a reasonable\n\nbelief that parties have title.” Santa Fe Energy Operating Partners, L.P., 948 S.W.2d at 785.\n\n         HMC/Host contends malice is negated by the fact that it relied on an attorney’s advice in\n\nsending the letter. In Humble Oil & Refining Co. v. Luckel, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">171</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">902</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 906 (Tex. Civ.\n\nApp.—Galveston 1943, writ ref’d w.o.m.), the court stated, “It is also well settled that a claim of\n\ntitle does not constitute malice where such claim is made under color of title upon the advice of\n\nattorneys, or upon reasonable belief that a party has title to the property acquired.” In order for\n\nthe advice of an attorney to negate legal malice, however, the claim still must be made under\n\ncolor of title. HMC/Host argues that no evidence was presented showing that it acted with legal\n\nmalice because asserting HMC/Host’s “§ 14.02 rights [was] a reasonable course of conduct\n\nunder the circumstances.” We disagree.\n\n         HMC/Host’s letter is based on its erroneous belief about the rights it had under Section\n\n14.02.    As previously discussed in relation to HMC/Host’s issues regarding the breach of\n\ncontract claim, however, the contract is unambiguous and is not “reasonably” susceptible to\n\nmore than one interpretation. Section 14.02 did not provide HMC/Host with a contractual right\n\nto exclusively negotiate with Keystone before Keystone negotiated with a third party.\n\nAccordingly, HMC/Host was not acting under color of title in claiming that Section 14.02\n\nentitled them to such a right. Moreover, Keystone had provided notice to HMC/Host on January\n\n7, 2005; however, HMC/Host’s letter demanded an additional ninety day period to negotiate\n\ndespite the fact that ninety days had elapsed since HMC/Host received notice and never made a\n\npurchase offer during that ninety day period. Because Section 14.02 unambiguously did not\n\nprovide HMC/Host the rights demanded in the April 18 letter, the evidence supports the jury’s\n\nfinding that HMC/Host was not acting under a color of title, but sent the letter maliciously.\n\n\n\n                                               - 18 -\n\f                                                                                      04-10-00620-CV\n\n\nC.      False Statement\n\n        To establish slander of title, the evidence must show that a “false” statement was\n\npublished.    Santa Fe Energy Operating Partners, L.P., 948 S.W.2d at 785.

App.—Eastland 2009, pet. denied).\n\n        The assertion by HMC/Host that no false statements were published is again based on its\n\ncontention that it properly construed the Lease. Because we have held that the Lease did not\n\nprovide HMC/Host with a right to an exclusive negotiating period, the statements in the April 18\n\nletter were false.\n\nD.

Kriss testified, however, that the\n\nSNDA could have been waived, and the previously delivered estoppel certificate would have\n\nbeen acceptable if the title company had insured around the Section 14.02 issue. Kriss informed\n\nKeystone’s attorney that there was a difference between HMC/Host sitting back (suggesting the\n\n90 day argument would work) and sending the letter stating Keystone was in default. Kriss\n\ntestified that when he read the April 18 letter, he knew the deal was in trouble and that the letter\n\nwould impact the closing. Kriss also testified he could not say whether the deal failed to close\n\nbased on the letter or the lease provision. Kriss further testified that he was unsure if the letter\n\nmaterially impacted closing.           He was sure it had an impact, but could not speak for the\n\nunderwriter.\n\n         Ashkenazy did not recall seeing the April 18 letter, but agreed with Kriss on whether the\n\ndeal would close if the title companies insured over the Section 14.02 issue.\n\n         Barry Brown with HFF testified that the April 18 letter was intended to either delay the\n\ndeal or blow it up. When he saw the letter, he knew the deal was going south and that the title\n\ncompany would object. The letter was a major concern and a surprise given that the estoppel\n\ncertificate had been signed and returned. Brown compared the letter to a bomb.\n\n\n\n4\n  SNDA is an acronym for subordination, attornment, and non-disturbance agreement in which a tenant agrees to\nsubordinate its rights to the lender while the lender agrees not to terminate a lease upon foreclosure unless the lease\nis in default.\n\n                                                        - 21 -\n\f                                                                                     04-10-00620-CV\n\n\n          Gerdes testified that the April 18 letter was devastating and prevented the deal from\n\nclosing.\n\n          Keystone’s attorney, Laura Sims, acknowledged that the title company had listed a\n\nwaiver as a requirement in its original title commitment and that Kriss’s letters regarding the\n\nfailure to close listed the failure to deliver all of the required documents. Sims described the\n\nApril 18 letter as a “sucker punch” that ratcheted up the risk to the title company by making the\n\nrisk “live” and making it more difficult to write around. The letter caused the issue to go from\n\nbeing potential to actual. Sims testified that the title company would have insured around the\n\nSection 14.02 issue but for the letter.\n\n          Jennifer Flynn Maxwell, the closing agent for Land America, testified that the waiver\n\nwas always a requirement, and she did not believe the policy would issue without the waiver.\n\nMaxwell believed the April 18 letter changed things and was a substantial contributing factor in\n\nthe title company’s decisions. Maxwell testified that the discussions at Land America revolved\n\naround the April 18 letter.\n\n          Samuel Edward Smith, the commercial account manager for Fidelity, testified that\n\nFidelity was looking for a waiver because the title commitment was issued listing it as a\n\nrequirement on Schedule C. Smith also testified that the April 18 letter was a substantial\n\ncontributing factor in Fidelity’s decision not to insure; however, he later stated that Fidelity was\n\ngoing to have the issue regardless, and the waiver was needed both before and after the April 18\n\nletter.\n\n          As previously noted, we must defer to the jury’s role in judging the credibility of the\n\nwitnesses and the weight of the testimony and determine whether the evidence at trial enabled\n\nreasonable and fair-minded people to find that the April 18 letter proximately caused the sale to\n\n\n\n                                               - 22 -\n\f                                                                                       04-10-00620-CV\n\n\nAshkenazy not to close. See City of Keller v. Wilson, 168 S.W.3d at 827.

Because the extension of the privilege to out-of-court communications is based\n\non the adoption of section 586 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts (which only pertains to\n\ncommunications by attorneys) and because the reason for the adoption of section 586 was a\n\npublic policy rationale in favor of attorneys as officers of the court, we disagree that the privilege\n\nextends to out-of-court communications by non-attorneys.\n\n       Moreover, the letter in question is written by HMC/Host regarding alleged violations of\n\nthe Lease as HMC/Host interpreted it. Although the letter demands that Keystone comply with\n\nthe Lease by taking certain actions, the letter never refers to a judicial proceeding.

Alternatively,\n\nHMC/Host contends it was exercising a colorable legal right in good faith as a matter of law.\n\n        The justification defense is based on either the exercise of: (1) one’s own legal rights; or\n\n(2) a good-faith claim to a colorable legal right, even though that claim ultimately proves to be\n\nmistaken.

As a result, justification was not established as a matter of law. We\n\nfurther question the trial court’s submission of the justification defense to the jury because, as\n\npreviously discussed, HMC/Host was not exercising a colorable right.\n\n        Even if we consider the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury’s finding that\n\nHMC/Host was not acting in “good faith,” a party attempting to overcome an adverse fact\n\nfinding as a matter of law must surmount two hurdles.

The witnesses associated with HMC/Host testified that the letter was intended to protect\n\nits rights under the Lease. The witnesses associated with Keystone testified that the letter was a\n\n“sucker punch” sent in an effort to delay or blow up the deal. This later testimony is supported\n\nby Host’s delay in asserting its position and waiting until either on or after the 90th day from the\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 27 -\n\f                                                                                                  04-10-00620-CV\n\n\ndate it received Keystone’s notice to send the letter. 5 Furthermore, Burke’s testimony that he\n\nhad a problem with any allocation that was anything higher than HMC/Host’s determination of\n\nthe fair market value must be considered. Since we must first ignore evidence contrary to the\n\njury’s finding of no good faith, we must accept the jury’s decision to believe the witnesses\n\nassociated with Keystone.           Based on their testimony, the jury could have believed that\n\nHMC/Host was not acting in “good faith.”\n\n                                              ATTORNEYS’ FEES\n\n        In its final issue, HMC/Host challenges the award of attorney’s fees to Keystone\n\nasserting: (1) Keystone’s tort claims did not arise out of or concern the Lease; and (2) Keystone\n\nwas required to segregate its fees between claims for which such fees were recoverable (arose\n\nout of or concerned the Lease and on which Keystone prevailed) from fees that were not\n\nrecoverable (did not arise out of or concern the Lease or on which Keystone did not prevail).\n\nA.      Arise Out of or Concern Lease\n\n        Section 14.20 of the Lease authorizes the recovery of attorney’s fees by the prevailing\n\nparty in any legal action “arising out of or concerning the Lease or the rights of any party\n\nhereto.” See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 38.001 (West 2008) (authorizing recovery of\n\nattorney’s fees for contractual claims). Initially, we note that Keystone prevailed on HMC’s\n\nclaim that it breached the Lease. Moreover, Keystone’s tort claims arose out of or concerned\n\nHMC/Host’s allegation that the Lease provided it with certain rights. Although recovery was\n\nbased on the finding that HMC/Host did not have the rights it alleged, the litigation arose out of\n\nits contention that such rights existed under the Lease. Accordingly, Keystone was entitled to\n\nrecovery of attorney’s fees for its tort claims.\n\n5\n  Evidence was presented that in a subsequent letter from Gerdes, he made a reference to January 18 being the start\ndate for the 90-day period. Gerdes testified that the January 18 date was a typographical error and was intended to\nrefer to the January 7th date of Keystone’s notice letter to HMC.\n\n                                                      - 28 -\n\f                                                                                    04-10-00620-CV\n\n\nB.

Because we hold that Keystone’s tortious interference\n\nand slander of title claims arise out of or concern the Lease, Keystone was not required to\n\nsegregate its fees because it did not assert a claim for which fees were unrecoverable.\n\n                                       PUNITIVE DAMAGES\n\n       In its cross-appeal, Keystone contends the trial court erred in granting HMC/Host’s\n\nmotion to disregard jury findings and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict as to the jury’s\n\nmalice finding. Keystone also challenges the trial court’s granting of HMC/Host’s motion as to\n\nthe jury’s finding that HMC authorized or ratified Host’s malice.\n\n       HMC/Host’s motion asserted several grounds challenging the sufficiency of the evidence\n\nto support the jury’s findings that: (1) HMC/Host was liable for slander of title; and (2)\n\nHMC/Host did not have a good faith belief that it had the right to send the April 18 letter which\n\nwas the question pertaining to HMC/Host’s justification defense. Because we have previously\n\nrejected those sufficiency challenges on appeal, the trial court could not have properly granted\n\nHMC/Host’s motion on those grounds. HMC/Host’s motion also asserted that: (1) the evidence\n\nwas legally insufficient to support the jury’s findings that the harm to Keystone resulted from\n\nmalice and that HMC authorized or ratified Host’s malice; and (2) the trial court improperly\n\ninstructed the jury during its deliberations.

The jury was instructed that “clear and convincing evidence” meant “the\n\nmeasure or degree of proof that produces a firm belief or conviction of the truth of the\n\nallegations sought to be established.” The jury also was instructed that “malice” meant “a\n\nspecific intent by Host Marriott to cause substantial injury or harm to Keystone.” “Specific\n\nintent means that the actor desires to cause the consequences of his act, or he believes the\n\nconsequences are substantially certain to result from it.” In re Estate of Russell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2106657\"><a href=\"/opinion/2106657/in-re-estate-of-russell/\"><span class=\"volume\">311</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">528</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 535 (Tex.

This argument is similar to its\n\njustification defense. HMC/Host argues there was “an honest difference of opinion as to the\n\ninterpretation or legal effect of” the Lease, and “the sincere pursuance of a claimed legal right\n\nunder [a] contract by one of the parties cannot form the basis of an award of punitive damages.”\n\nExxon Corp. v.

App.—Texarkana 1985, no writ). Keystone\n\ncounters that the contractual rights were clear, and the jury could imply malice because\n\nHMC/Host knew or should have known it did not have a contractual right to require the type of\n\nnotice of the sale that it demanded. First Interstate Bank of Ariz., N.A. v. Interfund Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">924</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">588</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 596 (5th Cir. 1991).\n\n       We initially note that in the case HMC/Host cites in support of its argument, the court\n\nheld that the contract in question was ambiguous before addressing the malice finding. Exxon\n\nCorp., 695 S.W.2d at 790. The court concluded that a term that was in dispute was reasonably\n\nsusceptible to both parties’ interpretation. Id. In this case, however, we previously held that the\n\nLease is not ambiguous because it is not reasonably susceptible to more than one interpretation.\n\nMoreover, as indicated above in addressing the sufficiency points, the evidence regarding\n\nHMC/Host’s intent was conflicting. Given the language of the Lease, the language of the April\n\n18 letter, the timing of the April 18 letter, and the testimony, we hold the evidence was sufficient\n\nfor the jury to have formed a firm belief or conviction that Host Marriott had a specific intent to\n\ncause substantial injury or harm to Keystone. Accordingly, the trial court would have erred in\n\ngranting HMC/Host’s motion on this basis.\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 31 -\n\f                                                                                      04-10-00620-CV\n\n\nB.     Jury Communication\n\n       Keystone also contends that the trial court could not have granted a judgment\n\nnotwithstanding the verdict on the basis of improper communication with the jury. The record\n\nestablishes that when the bailiff initially brought the jury’s verdict to the trial judge, the trial\n\njudge looked the verdict over and instructed the bailiff to take it back to the jury. When the jury\n\nwas being brought into the courtroom after it reached its verdict, the trial judge informed the\n\nattorneys that the jury had not answered a couple of the questions and that the trial judge had\n\nasked them to answer the questions. HMC/Host argued that the returning of the verdict was\n\nimproper under Rule 295 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure which provides that if the jury’s\n\nverdict is incomplete, “the court shall in writing instruct the jury in open court of the nature of\n\nthe incompleteness . . . , provide the jury such additional instructions as may be proper, and retire\n\nthe jury for further deliberations.” TEX. R. CIV. P. 295.\n\n       Rule 301 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure permits a trial court to render a judgment\n\nnotwithstanding the verdict “if a directed verdict would have been proper.” TEX. R. CIV. P. 301.\n\nFurthermore, Rule 301 permits a trial court to “disregard any jury’s finding on a question that\n\nhas no support in the evidence.” Id.\n\n       On appeal, Keystone argues that HMC/Host’s complaint about the trial judge returning\n\nthe jury’s verdict cannot be made in a motion to disregard. HMC/Host responds that a judgment\n\nnotwithstanding the verdict can be granted if a legal principle bars recovery. One of the cases\n\ncited by HMC/Host to support its contention is McIntyre v. Comm’n for Lawyer Discipline, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1876938\"><a href=\"/opinion/1876938/mcintyre-v-commn-for-lawyer-discipline/\"><span class=\"volume\">247</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">434</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. App.—Dallas 2008, pet. denied). In that case, the court does state, “A motion\n\nfor jnov should be granted when (1) the evidence is conclusive and one party is entitled to\n\nrecover as a matter of law or (2) a legal principle precludes recovery.” Id. at 441. The court\n\n\n\n                                                - 32 -\n\f                                                                                  04-10-00620-CV\n\n\nprefaces this statement, however, by stating, “A jnov is proper when a directed verdict would\n\nhave been proper.” Id.; see also Fort Bend Drainage Dist. v.

App.—Texarkana 2000, pet. denied) (noting judgment\n\nnotwithstanding the verdict is appropriate when “as a matter of law, the claim or defense\n\npresented is not viable and should never have been presented to the jury”).\n\n       HMC/Host’s reliance on the propriety of a directed verdict on the issue of improper jury\n\ncommunication is erroneous for several reasons. First, a motion for directed verdict “is a\n\nprocedural device to ask the court to render judgment without submitting the charge to the jury\n\nbecause there is nothing for the jury to decide.”       Michael O’Connor & Byron P. Davis,\n\nO’Connor’s Texas Rules – Civil Trials 659 (2011). HMC/Host’s complaint in this instance is not\n\nthat the questions should not have been submitted to the jury. Rather, HMC/Host’s complaint is\n\nthat the trial judge’s communication with the jury after the questions were submitted was\n\nimproper.    Moreover, the complaint raised by HMC/Host pertaining to improper jury\n\ncommunication would not “bar” recovery such that the trial court could render judgment on that\n\nbasis. At most, improper jury communication could, if proven, entitle HMC/Host to a new trial.\n\nAccordingly, the trial court could not have properly granted a judgment notwithstanding the\n\nverdict and thereby rendered judgment in favor of HMC/Host on Keystone’s punitive damages\n\nclaim on the basis that the trial court improperly communicated with the jury.\n\n\n\n                                              - 33 -\n\f                                                                                    04-10-00620-CV\n\n\nC.     Liability of HMC\n\n       Keystone also argues that both Host and HMC should be held liable for the punitive\n\ndamages. Keystone contends the trial court improperly disregarded the jury’s finding that HMC\n\nauthorized or ratified the malice by Host.\n\n       A corporation is liable for punitive damages if it authorizes or ratifies an agent’s malice.\n\nMobil Oil Corp. v.

Accordingly, a subsidiary\n\ncorporation could be an agent of its parent if the evidence supported such a finding.\n\n       The jury charge defined the term agent as “one who acts with the party’s authority or\n\napparent authority.” The jury was further instructed that the principal must agree that the agent\n\nact on its behalf and for its benefit, and if the agent is authorized, the agent may do whatever is\n\nproper, usual, and necessary to perform the act expressly authorized. Finally, the jury was\n\ninstructed that apparent authority exists if a party: (1) knowingly permits another to hold himself\n\nout as having authority; or (2) through lack of ordinary care, bestows on another such indications\n\nof authority that lead a reasonably prudent person to rely on the apparent existence of authority\n\nto his detriment.

HMC is the\n\ntenant under the ground lease; however, the April 18 letter was sent by Host. Burke testified that\n\nHost was making decisions for itself and for HMC regarding the transaction.
