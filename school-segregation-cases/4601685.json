In the statute under con-\nsideration, the Legislature of the State of Texas has undertaken not only\nto declare what the law shall be, which is clearly its prerogative, but\nhas also undertaken to clothe a portion of the membership of the Legis-\nlature, the Joint Legislative Advisory Committee, with the authority\nto execute and administer the law passed by the Legislature. Under\nArticle 2, Section 1, of the Constit,utionof the State of Texas, the\nLegislature is powerless to clothe itself, or a portion of it5 members,\nwith executive authority.\n\n          The following language, quoted from the case of People v. Tre-\nmaine, (New York) 168 N. E. 822, has application to the situation under\nconsideration:\n\n          \"The Legislature has not -de only a law -- i.e., an\n     appropriation -- but has made two of its members ex officio\n     its executive agents to carry out the law; i.e., to act on\n     the segregation of the appropriation. This is a clear and\n     conspicuous instance of an attempt by the Legislature to\n     confer administrative power upon two of its own members.\n     It may not engraft executive duties upon a legislative of-\n     fice and thus usurp the executive power by indirection.\n     Springer v. Phillipine Islands, 277 U. S. 189, 48 SUP. Ct.\n     480, 72 L. Rd. 845.\n\fHonorable George G. Roane, page 9 (0-4609)\n\n\n\n         \"Should the question arise whether the appointments\n    under consideration are legislative or admini5trative, a\n    dilema presents itself either side of which is fatalto\n    the contention of the reepondent. If they are legisla-\n    tive in character, the appointment amounts to a delega-\n    tion of the legislative power over appropriations. The\n    Legislature cannot secure relief from its duties or re-\n    sponsibilitieB by a general delegation of legislative\n    power to someone else. People v. C. Krinck Packing Com-\n    pany, 214 N. Y. 121, 108 N. E. 278, Anno. Cas. 1916B,\n    1051. The power to itemize legislative appropriations\n    is the legislative power which it may exercise if it sees\n    fit as long as the matter is in its hands. If the power\n    to approve the segregation of lump Bum appropriations may\n    be delegated to anyone, even to one or two members of the\n    Legislature, it necessarily follow6 that the power to seg-\n    regate such appropriations may also be conferred upon such\n    delegates. The conclusion would then inevitably be that\n    the Legislature could make lump sum appropriations and\n    delegate the power to two of its members to segregate the\n    same, not only within a department but among departments.\n    To visualize an extreme cazle,one lump Bum appropriation\n    might be made to be segregated by the committee chairmen.\n    Such a delegation of legislative power would be abhorent\n    to all our notiona   of legislation on the matter of ap-\n    propriations. It would amount to a casting on others of\n    a great measure of legislative reBponsibility assumed by\n    the members themselves by their oath faithfully to dis-\n    charge the duties of their office. If, on the other hand,\n    the power is administrative, it has no real relation to\n    legislative power. The head of the department does not\n    legislate when he segregates a lump sum appropriation.\n    The legislation is complete when the appropriation is made.\n    The Legislature might make the segregation itself, but it\n    may not confer administrative powers upon its members with-\n    out giving them, unconstitutionally, civil appointments to\n    administrative offices. It might by general law confer the\n    power of segregation or approval of segregation upon any\n    one but its own members subject to the provisions of the\n    Constitution (Article~5), hereinafter discussed, if appli-\n    cable, but the Constitution (Article 3, Section 7, supra)\n    makes its own members ineligible to such an appointment.~\n\n         \"It follows that so much of the appropriation bills\n    in question as confers powers on the legislative chairman\n    to approve segregations is unconstitutional and void.\"\n\n         See also the caBe of Stockman v.

This is 50 because the Legislature anticipated that the attempt\nto confer such authority upon the Joint Legislative Advisory Committee\nwould probably violate the Constitution of the State of Texas, and, in\nrecognition of that, provided in Article XII of the Act that should the\nduties, powers and function5 of the Joint Legislative Advisory Committee\nbecome inactive or unenforceable, then and in that event, \"such duties\nas are herein imposed on said Joint Legislative Advisory Committee shall\nbe performed by the State Board of Education the same as if said Commit-\ntee had not been created or authorized.\"\n\n          It follows, therefore, from what has been said above, that\nthe duties, powers, and functions of the Joint Legislative Advisory Com-\nmittee, save and except the duty imposed upon it to study the school\nlaws of this State in order that said laws may be recodified, devolve\nupon and are to be executed by the State Board of Education the same\nas if the Joint Legislative Advisory Committee had not been created or\nauthorized by the Act.\n\n            We trust that the foregoing sufficiently answers your inquiry.\n\n                                                  Your5 very truly\n\nAPPROVED JDR 12, 1942                        ATTORNEY GENERAL OFTEXAS\n\nId   Gerald C.

Cas. 1916B,\n    1051. The power to itemize legislative appropriations\n    is the legislative power which it may exercise if it sees\n    fit as long as the matter is in its hands. If the power\n    to approve the segregation of lump Bum appropriations may\n    be delegated to anyone, even to one or two members of the\n    Legislature, it necessarily follow6 that the power to seg-\n    regate such appropriations may also be conferred upon such\n    delegates. The conclusion would then inevitably be that\n    the Legislature could make lump sum appropriations and\n    delegate the power to two of its members to segregate the\n    same, not only within a department but among departments.\n    To visualize an extreme cazle,one lump Bum appropriation\n    might be made to be segregated by the committee chairmen.\n    Such a delegation of legislative power would be abhorent\n    to all our notiona   of legislation on the matter of ap-\n    propriations. It would amount to a casting on others of\n    a great measure of legislative reBponsibility assumed by\n    the members themselves by their oath faithfully to dis-\n    charge the duties of their office. If, on the other hand,\n    the power is administrative, it has no real relation to\n    legislative power. The head of the department does not\n    legislate when he segregates a lump sum appropriation.\n    The legislation is complete when the appropriation is made.\n    The Legislature might make the segregation itself, but it\n    may not confer administrative powers upon its members with-\n    out giving them, unconstitutionally, civil appointments to\n    administrative offices. It might by general law confer the\n    power of segregation or approval of segregation upon any\n    one but its own members subject to the provisions of the\n    Constitution (Article~5), hereinafter discussed, if appli-\n    cable, but the Constitution (Article 3, Section 7, supra)\n    makes its own members ineligible to such an appointment.~\n\n         \"It follows that so much of the appropriation bills\n    in question as confers powers on the legislative chairman\n    to approve segregations is unconstitutional and void.\"\n\n         See also the caBe of Stockman v.

Roane, page 10 (0-4609)\n\n\n\n          Though 50 much of the Act as purport5 to confer upon the Joint\nLegislative Advisory Committee power to execute and administer the pro-\nvisions of the Act is unconstitutional, nevertheleee those duties, powers,\nand function5 of the Joint Legislative Advisory Committee do not wholly\nfail. This is 50 because the Legislature anticipated that the attempt\nto confer such authority upon the Joint Legislative Advisory Committee\nwould probably violate the Constitution of the State of Texas, and, in\nrecognition of that, provided in Article XII of the Act that should the\nduties, powers and function5 of the Joint Legislative Advisory Committee\nbecome inactive or unenforceable, then and in that event, \"such duties\nas are herein imposed on said Joint Legislative Advisory Committee shall\nbe performed by the State Board of Education the same as if said Commit-\ntee had not been created or authorized.\"\n\n          It follows, therefore, from what has been said above, that\nthe duties, powers, and functions of the Joint Legislative Advisory Com-\nmittee, save and except the duty imposed upon it to study the school\nlaws of this State in order that said laws may be recodified, devolve\nupon and are to be executed by the State Board of Education the same\nas if the Joint Legislative Advisory Committee had not been created or\nauthorized by the Act.\n\n            We trust that the foregoing sufficiently answers your inquiry.\n\n                                                  Your5 very truly\n\nAPPROVED JDR 12, 1942                        ATTORNEY GENERAL OFTEXAS\n\nId   Gerald C.
