INTRODUCTION\n         Hyatt Corporation is the manager of a resort hotel on\nSt. John in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Hyatt's management powers\narise from agreements executed in March 1990 among Hyatt, Great\nCruz Bay Development Co., Inc. (\"Great Cruz\"), the owner of the\nhotel, and Great Cruz's lender, Saastopankkien Keskus-Osake-\nPankki (\"Skopbank\"). After Skopbank foreclosed on the property\nin 1991, 35 Acres Associates purchased the hotel pursuant to a\njudicial sale. Immediately thereafter, 35 Acres purported to\nterminate Hyatt's management of the hotel, propelling the parties\ninto this acrimonious litigation. The district court, on cross-\nmotions for summary judgment, entered an order granting 35 Acres'\nmotion for partial summary judgment on April 10, 1996, thus\nterminating Hyatt's presence at the hotel, and ordering the\nparties to \"work together to effect a smooth transition in the\nmanagement and operation of the Hotel.\" The court certified its\norder as a final judgment pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b) on\nMay 3, 1996.\n         Hyatt now appeals from the district court's grant of\npartial summary judgment to 35 Acres. The parties agree that\n\fthis appeal focuses only on issues concerning 35 Acres' power to\nterminate Hyatt's agency and 35 Acres' right of possession of the\nhotel and related property together with issues relating to the\ntransition of the management of the hotel. The district court\nhad subject matter jurisdiction under either 28 U.S.C. ยง\n1332(a)(2) (action between citizens of a state and citizens or\nsubjects of a foreign state) or 28 U.S.C. ยง 1332(a)(3) (action\nbetween citizens of different states in which citizens or\nsubjects of a foreign state are additional parties). The amount\nin controversy exceeds $50,000, exclusive of interest and costs.\nWe have jurisdiction over the appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1291\nand exercise plenary review over the grant of partial summary\njudgment and abuse of discretion review over the court's\ntransition order.\n\n         II.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n                      A. Factual Background\n         In view of the procedural posture of the case we\npresent the facts in a light most favorable to Hyatt. From June\n1988 through March 1990 Skopbank, a Finnish corporation, loaned\nGreat Cruz and St. John Virgin Grand Villas Associates\napproximately $120 million for the construction and operation of\nthe property which became known as the \"Hyatt Regency St. John at\nthe Virgin Grand Resort.\" In 1989 representatives of Great Cruz\napproached Hyatt to enlist its assistance in addressing\noperational and financial problems of the resort. Great Cruz\nsought a professional, experienced, and financially able hotel\ncompany with a strong global brand identity and a proven ability\nin the Caribbean to attract business, so that the resort's value\nand profitability could be maximized.\n         Specifically, Great Cruz proposed that the resort bear\nthe \"Hyatt\" and \"Hyatt Regency\" registered trademarks and trade\nnames; that the resort join the \"Hyatt\" chain and participate in\nHyatt's comprehensive and proprietary chain-wide programs and\nservices (including, without limitation, Hyatt's global\nreservations system; worldwide marketing, public relations, and\nadvertising services; employee training programs; and home office\nand regional sales office convention, business, and promotion\nservices); and that Hyatt manage the resort. Great Cruz\nparticularly sought the use of the prestigious \"Hyatt\" name and\nHyatt's commitment to use its expertise to ensure the success of\nthe resort. With the encouragement of Skopbank, Great Cruz was\nlooking for a company to maximize the economic potential of the\nresort.\n         Hyatt was reticent to commit the \"Hyatt\" and \"Hyatt\nRegency\" names to the resort because of the resort's historically\npoor performance, its financial structure, and the fact that the\nquality and consistency of service, facilities, and amenities\nprovided by Great Cruz fell far below Hyatt's quality standards.\nThus, Hyatt believed that there was substantial economic and\nreputational risk in allowing the resort to be known as a \"Hyatt\nRegency.\"\n         During the negotiations leading to the execution of the\nagreements, Hyatt informed Great Cruz that the \"Hyatt\" and \"Hyatt\n\fRegency\" trademarks, service marks, and trade names were worth\nbillions of dollars to Hyatt's owners and represented decades of\ntime, effort, and financial risk. Hyatt's reputation as a\npremier resort manager was nowhere higher than in the Caribbean,\nwhere it had established itself as the predominant chain.\nMoreover, Hyatt informed Great Cruz that, even with Hyatt's\nspecial knowledge of resort-building and its established\nrelationships with customers and vendors, it would take three to\nfive years from the opening of the resort under the Hyatt name to\nstabilize its operations and to begin to realize the full\npotential of the location so that Hyatt could derive the level of\nfinancial benefits justifying its participation. Hyatt informed\nGreat Cruz that it only would consider establishing the resort as\na \"Hyatt Regency\" if Great Cruz agreed to conditions that would\nensure Hyatt both the power to control the resort's business and\nan adequate share in the resort's long-term profits that Hyatt\nbelieved its contributions could generate.\n         Hyatt informed Great Cruz during these negotiations\nthat it would not permit the hotel to be known as a \"Hyatt\" or\n\"Hyatt Regency\" or agree to the inclusion of the resort in its\nworldwide chain unless it also was given powers to protect its\ncontributions to the resort. Hyatt decided that it was\nabsolutely necessary for it to have the power to control the\nquality of the resort facility as well as the quality of services\nprovided by the hotel by assuming managerial and operational\nresponsibilities for the resort. Hyatt, Great Cruz, and Skopbank\ntherefore agreed to structure their contracts deliberately and\ncarefully to accomplish those objectives to protect Hyatt.\n         During the negotiations among Hyatt, Great Cruz, and\nSkopbank, Hyatt analyzed the resort's highly-leveraged financial\nstructure and other issues associated with the resort's financial\nsituation. With such considerations in mind, Hyatt informed\nGreat Cruz that it was willing to consider a financial structure\nwhereby Hyatt invested time and effort and not seek a substantial\nportion of its normal management fees in exchange for an interest\nin the enterprise affording it a return on its investment, to be\ntaken in the form of a long-term profit participation. Thus,\nHyatt explains that, in order \"to protect the investments and\nproperty it would contribute as part of its undertaking to build\nthe business of the Resort, [it] required an interest in the\nprofits of the `Hyatt Regency St. John.'\" Br. at 15.\nAccordingly, Hyatt demanded and Great Cruz consented to a formula\nunder which Hyatt potentially would receive a significant return\non its investment. Although, in Hyatt's assessment, the formula\ncontained a low front-end fixed management fee, it also included\na substantial back-end share of profits that the parties\nspecifically designed to reflect Hyatt's \"capital investment in\nthe property,\" id., which included Hyatt's contribution of the\ndifference between its typical market rate front-end fees and the\nfees applicable in this case.\n         Further, to protect its interests, Hyatt negotiated for\nand obtained a 30-year term for the management agreement between\nit and Great Cruz which the parties agreed could not be\nterminated except in strict compliance with its express\n\ftermination provisions. Hyatt explains that, given its\nsubstantial \"capital investments\" in the hotel and the time\nrequired to reap a return on its investments, it was not willing\nto assume the risk that Great Cruz (or a subsequent owner) could\nrevoke and terminate the agreement for reasons, or on grounds,\nother than those set forth in the contracts. Id. Hyatt informed\nGreat Cruz that it deemed its participation in the enterprise as\nthe clear equivalent of a cash equity investment, and Great Cruz\nassented to Hyatt's approach to, and view of, the transaction.\n         In order to protect the proprietary nature of its\nmanagement methods and to avoid confusion with respect to its\ntrademarks and trade names, Hyatt also insisted on the power to\nrestrict the owner's right to transfer the management agreement\nto successors or assigns. Thus, to secure the performance of\nduties owed to Hyatt, section 15.2 of the management agreement\ngave it the right and power to block the owner's assignment to\nany assignee \"`engaged in the management or operation . . . of a\nchain (that is, five [5] or more locations) of hotels or\nresorts.'\" Br. at 18. Further, Hyatt agreed to add the resort\nto its worldwide hotel chain and agreed to provide its\ncomprehensive and proprietary chain services to the resort. Many\nof the services that Hyatt thus committed to contribute involved\nconfidential, proprietary, and trade secret information.\n         The parties eventually reached an understanding and on\nMarch 9, 1990, Great Cruz, Skopbank, and Hyatt executed a series\nof agreements that allow Hyatt to manage and operate the hotel.\nThe documents included a management agreement signed by Hyatt and\nGreat Cruz giving Hyatt complete control over the operation of\nthe hotel for a term of 30 years, essentially limiting the\nowner's right to terminate the agreement to poor performance by\nHyatt. (Management Agreement at ยงยง 2, 4.5; app. 1809, 1836). In\nreturn for managing the hotel, Hyatt would receive a base fee of\n1.5 percent of gross revenue, as well as an incentive fee\nstructured on positive cash flow. Id. at 1829. A letter\nagreement signed by Great Cruz and Hyatt directed Hyatt to pay\nSkopbank any sums due to Great Cruz under the management\nagreement. Id. at 113.\n         Hyatt sets forth in its brief that in order \"to secure\nits property interests and investments in the business it was to\ncreate as well as to secure the performance of certain duties\nowed to [it],\" br. at 21-22, Great Cruz warranted and guaranteed\nHyatt's continuous right to manage the resort for the duration of\nthe term of the management agreement. Specifically, Hyatt notes\nthat section 7.5 of the agreement provides that \"this Agreement\nshall not be subject to forfeiture or termination except in\naccordance with the provisions hereof,\" id. at 22; see app. at\n1795, and that \"Hyatt shall be entitled to operate the Hotel for\nthe Term, and Owner shall, at no expense to Hyatt, undertake and\nprosecute all appropriate actions, judicial or otherwise,\nrequired to assure such right of operation to Hyatt.\" Br. at 22;\nsee app. at 1860-61.\n         In addition, a subordination, non-disturbance, and\nattornment agreement set forth the rights of the parties should\nSkopbank foreclose its mortgage to Great Cruz. This agreement\n\fincluded a warrant by Skopbank that the management agreement\nwould remain undisturbed by any foreclosure or default and would\ncontinue in full force and effect as long as Hyatt was not in\ndefault.   (Subordination Agreement at ยงยง 2, 3; app. at 548).\n         In 1991, Skopbank filed a foreclosure action in the\nDistrict Court of the Virgin Islands (Civ. No. 91-355) as a\nresult of Great Cruz's default on the mortgages. In 1992, during\nthe pendency of the foreclosure suit, the Government Guarantee\nFund of the Republic of Finland (\"GGF\") obtained a controlling\ninterest in Skopbank as part of the Finnish government's bailout\nof the bank.\n         On February 21, 1995, the district court entered a\nconsent judgment and put the hotel up for judicial sale. On\nMarch 20, 1995, 35 Acres Associates, a Virgin Islands general\npartnership consisting of two Finnish corporations, purchased the\nhotel. On March 21, 1995, counsel for 35 Acres wrote to Hyatt,\nstating that \"GGF, Skopbank and 35 Acres Associates consider the\nManagement Agreement between Hyatt Corporation ('Hyatt') and\nGreat Cruz Bay Development Company, Inc. as void, terminated\nand/or expired.\" Br. at 23; app. at 1401-02. On June 8, 1995,\n35 Acres wrote again, advising Hyatt that it was in wrongful\npossession, and demanding that it surrender possession of the\nhotel:\n              The Hotel belongs to 35 Acres, not\n         Hyatt. Hyatt is trespassing on the property.\n         35 Acres again demands that Hyatt immediately\n         surrender possession of the Hotel and all\n         associated real and personal property and\n         accounts and cooperate in an orderly transfer\n         to 35 Acres. We will have a transition team\n         available on short notice.\nApp. at 1407. Hyatt, however, did not surrender possession of\nthe hotel.\n                     B. Procedural History\n         GGF and Skopbank filed suit against Hyatt (Civil No.\n1995-49) on March 16, 1995, seeking a declaratory judgment\nfinding Hyatt in breach of the management agreements and alleging\nvarious claims in tort and contract. GGF and Skopbank, of\ncourse, sought, inter alia, a judgment declaring the management\nagreement terminated and thus giving it possession of the hotel.\nOn November 8, 1995, GGF and Skopbank filed an amended complaint\nadding additional entities as plaintiffs, including 35 Acres. On\nApril 25, 1995, Hyatt sued 35 Acres (Civil No. 1995-68), and\nthereafter filed two amended complaints. The second amended\ncomplaint, dated June 21, 1995, sought a judgment declaring the\nrights of the various parties under the management agreements,\nrecovery for civil conspiracy, and punitive, compensatory, and\nconsequential damages. On June 21, 1995, the district court\nconsolidated the two cases for trial.\n         At a hearing on November 17, 1995, the court took under\nadvisement 35 Acres' motion to dismiss the second amended\ncomplaint in the Hyatt suit (Civil No. 1995-68) and denied\nwithout prejudice Hyatt's motion to strike and dismiss the GGF\nparties' first amended complaint in the GGF suit (Civil No.\n\f1995-49). See Government Guarantee Fund v. Hyatt Corp., 166\nF.R.D. 321, 323 (D.V.I. 1996). Hyatt renewed its motion to\nstrike and dismiss on December 22, 1995.\n         On January 8, 1996, the district court granted 35\nAcres' motion to dismiss the second amended complaint in the\nHyatt suit. See Government Guarantee Fund v. Hyatt Corp., 1996\nWL 165008, at *6 (D.V.I. Jan. 8, 1996). On January 3, 1996, 35\nAcres moved for partial summary judgment against Hyatt in the GGF\nsuit, arguing that it was entitled to possession of the hotel as\na matter of law. On January 23, 1996, Hyatt moved to amend the\ncourt's order of January 8, 1996, to permit the filing of a third\namended complaint in its suit.\n         On March 6, 1996, the district court held a hearing on\nthe consolidated cases. Ruling from the bench, the court granted\n35 Acres' motion for partial summary judgment, in effect granting\nit possession of the hotel. The court directed the parties to\nwork together on transferring management of the hotel. App. at\n2157. The court denied without prejudice Hyatt's motion to\ndismiss the first amended complaint in the GGF suit (Civil No.\n1995-49). In the Hyatt suit (Civil No. 1995-68) the court denied\nHyatt's motion to amend the court's order of January 8, 1996, and\nits motion to be permitted to file a third amended complaint.\nThe court issued a written order implementing its March 6, 1996\nrulings on April 10, 1996. The order stated that \"[b]oth parties\nshall work together to effect a smooth transition in the\nmanagement and operation of the Hotel,\" app. at 2199, and allowed\nHyatt 10 days from the entry of the order to answer the first\namended complaint in the GGF suit (Civil No. 1995-49) and assert\nany defenses and compulsory counterclaims thereto. Id. at 2199-\n2200. The court further ordered the Hyatt case (Civil No. 1995-\n68) closed and that all other pleadings filed thereafter should\ncontain only the caption of the GGF suit (Civil No. 1995-49).\nId. at 2200.\n         The court issued an opinion and order on April 10,\n1996, explaining its rulings from the bench on March 6, 1996.\nSee Government Guarantee Fund v. Hyatt Corp., 166 F.R.D. 321. In\nthe opinion the district court noted first that \"35 Acres seeks a\ndetermination that its agency relationship with Hyatt has been\nterminated as a matter of law, and Hyatt must leave the\npremises,\" id., at 326, and then concluded that:\n              Applying the controlling law to the\n         undisputed facts of this case establishes\n         that the Management Agreement created a\n         revocable agency that ended once 35 Acres\n         gave notice of its termination. As\n         terminated agent, Hyatt must leave the\n         premises and surrender control of the Hotel\n         to 35 Acres, its rightful owner.\nId., at 327. Hyatt's challenge to this conclusion is at the\nheart of its appeal.\n         On April 12, 1996, 35 Acres filed a motion for entry of\nan order seeking the transition of management provided for in the\ndistrict court's grant of partial summary judgment. On May 3,\n1996, the district court entered such an order and certified the\n\forder of April 10, 1996, and the order of May 3, 1996,\neffectuating the order of April 10, 1996, as final judgments\npursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b). On May 6, 1996, Hyatt filed a\nnotice of appeal from the district court's May 3, 1996 Rule 54(b)\norder which included an appeal from the April 10, 1996 order.\nHyatt also filed an emergency motion in the district court to\nstay enforcement of the judgment without bond or, in the\nalternative, for a hearing to set the amount of the supersedeas\nbond pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 62.\n         Following oral argument on May 9, 1996, the district\ncourt denied Hyatt's emergency motion for a stay. See Government\nGuarantee Fund v. Hyatt Corp., 1996 WL 308865, at *1 (D.V.I. May\n15, 1996). The court thereafter entered a written order denying\nthe motion and providing that Hyatt must comply with the order of\nMay 3, 1996, by May 14, 1996.\n         On May 13, 1996, Hyatt filed an emergency motion in\nthis court to stay enforcement of the district court's judgment\npending appeal. A single judge of this court granted the motion\non a temporary basis until a panel could consider the matter. On\nMay 20, 1996, we granted Hyatt's motion to stay enforcement of\nthe judgment pending appeal and accelerated the parties' briefing\nschedule. We also directed that following completion of the\nbriefing the case be listed before the earliest available panel.\nFinally, we remanded the case to the district court to fix the\namount of the supersedeas bond pursuant to Fed. R. App. P. 8(a),\nwhile retaining jurisdiction over the appeal.\n         On May 29, 1996, the district court held a hearing on\nthe remand and required Hyatt to post two bonds, one in the\namount of $2 million (to be posted by June 4, 1996), and the\nother in the amount of $11 million (to be posted by July 30,\n1996), for a total bond obligation of $13 million. The district\ncourt also held that this court's stay \"should not allow Hyatt to\nreopen the Hotel over the objections of 35 Acres Associates.\"\n         On June 3, 1996, Hyatt filed a motion in this court to\nset aside or modify the district court's order setting the amount\nof the supersedeas bonds. On July 3, 1996, we granted Hyatt's\nmotion, but only \"to the extent\" that we vacated \"so much of the\norder of May 31, 1996, which precluded Hyatt from reopening the\nhotel over the objection of 35 Acres Associates.\" We denied the\nmotion to modify the order with respect to the bonds. We\nunderstand that Hyatt has posted the bonds. We, however, are\nuncertain as to whether the hotel is open.\n         The parties agree that this appeal focuses only on 35\nAcres' power to terminate the agency and its right to possession\nof the hotel and related property, as well as transition matters,\nirrespective of the ultimate result of the remaining litigation.\nThus, we do not consider whether 35 Acres wrongfully terminated\nHyatt's management rights. We now address the merits of Hyatt's\nappeal.\n\n                        III. DISCUSSION\n                      A. Burdens of Proof\n         We dispose of Hyatt's first argument summarily. Hyatt\nargues that 35 Acres had the burden of proving the revocability\n\fof Hyatt's agency as a matter of law in the district court, as\nwell as the burden of proving that Hyatt did not have the right\nto occupy or possess the resort. Hyatt asserts that the only\nevidence 35 Acres offered with respect to these two issues\nconsisted of the following four allegations:\n         (1) 35 Acres is the owner of a hotel known as\n         the Virgin Grand Hotel on the island of St.\n         John, U.S. Virgin Islands; (2) Hyatt\n         Corporation purports to claim a right to act\n         as the managing agent of 35 Acres pursuant to\n         a Management Agreement dated March 9, 1990,\n         between Hyatt and Great Cruz Bay Development\n         Company, Inc.; (3) Skopbank, GGF, and 35\n         Acres sent a letter to Hyatt dated March 21,\n         1995, in which they stated that they\n         `consider' the Management Agreement `as void,\n         terminated and/or expired'; and (4) Hyatt\n         refuses to vacate the premises.\nBr. at 28-29 (some internal quotations omitted).\n         Hyatt argues that 35 Acres' motion for partial summary\njudgment thus attempted to \"off-load its burden of proof upon\nHyatt.\" Br. at 29. Hyatt asserts that 35 Acres failed to meet\nits burden of proving as a matter of law the following necessary\nelements of its claim for relief: (1) the revocability of Hyatt's\nagency; (2) the valid termination of that agency; and (3) the\nabsence of any right of Hyatt to manage or occupy the resort.\n         We decline to treat this case as involving merely the\nburdens placed upon parties seeking summary judgment, and\ntherefore will address fully the merits of the appeal considering\nthe facts presented on the motion for partial summary judgment in\nthe district court. After all, the parties submitted extensive\nmaterials in the district court and we see no reason why we\nshould not consider the record as developed.\n\n                       B. Prima Facie Case\n         Hyatt's second argument, that 35 Acres failed to\nestablish a prima facie entitlement to relief, likewise lacks\nsubstance. Hyatt first notes that in ruling upon 35 Acres'\nmotion for partial summary judgment, the district court applied\nVirgin Islands law, which provides that the \"rules of the common\nlaw, as expressed in the restatements of the law . . . shall be\nthe rules of decision in the courts of the Virgin Islands . . .\nin the absence of local laws to the contrary.\" V.I. Code Ann.\ntit. 1, ยง 4 (1967). Thus, the district court held that, \"The\nRestatement (Second) of Agency (1958) is the governing law in\nthis area.\" Government Guarantee Fund v. Hyatt Corp., 166 F.R.D.\nat 327.\n         Hyatt points out that the Restatement recognizes that\nthere are two separate and distinct types of agencies:\n         The first type, often called `revocable'\n         agencies, may be revoked by the principal at\n         any time and for any reason. See Restatement\n         (Second) of Agency, ยง 118 and Comment b. The\n         second type, often called `irrevocable'\n\f         agencies, agency powers `given as security,'\n         or agencies `coupled with an interest,' may\n         not be terminated at the whim of the\n         principal, but may be terminated only `in\n         accordance with the agreement by which the\n         power was created.' See Restatement (Second)\n         of Agency, ยง 139 and Comment a.\nBr. at 31. Hyatt therefore argues that mere proof of the\nexistence of a power in the form of an agency does not establish\nthe absolute and unqualified right of the grantor to terminate\nthe power. Consequently mere evidence that there is an agency\nneither establishes the revocability of that agency nor disproves\nits irrevocability. Id. Hyatt thus claims that there was a\n\"fundamental flaw in 35 Acres' motion for partial summary\njudgment\" in the district court. Id. at 32.\n         Further, Hyatt asserts that 35 Acres did not negate\nconclusively the continued existence of a principal-agent\nrelationship with Hyatt. Hyatt argues that a claim that an\nagency is irrevocable or is coupled with an interest is not an\naffirmative defense in an action to terminate an agency. Thus,\nit contends that 35 Acres did not fulfill its burden on its\nmotion for summary judgment seeking to terminate the agency\nmerely by proving the existence of the agency. Hyatt asserts\nthat 35 Acres was required to demonstrate that Hyatt's agency was\nrevocable, and thereby preclude the possibility that Hyatt's\nagency was irrevocable.\n         Along the same lines, Hyatt argues that 35 Acres failed\nto demonstrate as a matter of law that it terminated Hyatt's\nagency, as Hyatt claims that the letter of March 21, 1995 \"does\nnot clearly purport to constitute an act of revocation or\ntermination, but suggests that the termination had already\noccurred and that the letter was merely memorializing that\nalleged historic fact.\" Br. at 33. Hyatt claims that the proof\nof 35 Acres' alleged termination of Hyatt's agency is, at best,\nambiguous and inconclusive, and that courts frequently hold that\nthe intent and effect of purported termination notices raise\ngenuine issues of material fact precluding summary judgment.\nFinally, Hyatt attacks the prima facie case presented by 35 Acres\nas devoid of conclusive proof of a present right in 35 Acres to\nexclusive possession of the resort.\n         We find this line of argument meritless, and are\nsatisfied that 35 Acres met its burden in its motion for partial\nsummary judgment of presenting a prima facie case that it was\nentitled to possession of the hotel as a matter of law. SeeMatsushita\nElec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574,\n585, n.10, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 1355, n.10 (1986). On the motion 35\nAcres presented the management agreement which on its face merely\ncreated an agency. We see no reason for 35 Acres to have proven\nat that point in the litigation that the agency itself was not\nirrevocable. As to Hyatt's claim that the March 21, 1995 letter\n\"[did] not clearly purport to constitute an act of revocation or\ntermination,\" the district court noted in its January 8, 1996\nmemorandum that:\n         Hyatt concedes that 35 Acres sent it letters\n\f         that 35 Acres 'considered Hyatt's management\n         agreement \"void, terminated and/or expired\"'\n         and demanding Hyatt `immediately surrender\n         possession' of the Hotel. (Second Amended\n         Complaint at 2.) Indisputably, such letters\n         manifested 35 Acres' dissent to the\n         continuance of the agency relationship with\n         Hyatt -- all that is required for an agency\n         to be terminated under the Restatement.\n         Restatement (Second) of Agency, ยง 118.\nGovernment Guarantee Fund v. Hyatt Corp., 1996 WL 165008 at *3.\nSurely, Hyatt cannot argue reasonably that it did not realize the\nMarch 21, 1995 letter constituted notice of termination, when it\nhas referred to the letter as such in its own pleadings.\nFurthermore, on June 9, 1995, Hyatt filed an amended complaint\nreferring to 35 Acres' June 8, 1995 letter to Hyatt that we\nquoted in part above which set forth continued written demands\nthat Hyatt quit the property, provide an accounting, and cease\nacting as agent for 35 Acres because its agency had been\nterminated. App. at 1170, 1180, 1034. In addition, on June 21,\n1995, Hyatt filed a Second Amended Complaint that referenced a\nJune 19, 1996 letter (app. at 1186, 1195) demanding that Hyatt\ncease acting as agent for 35 Acres. App. at 1043.\n         Finally, Hyatt's argument that the prima facie case\npresented by 35 Acres was devoid of conclusive proof of 35 Acres'\npresent right to exclusive possession of the resort is also\nmeritless. Hyatt has admitted that 35 Acres owns the hotel.\nApp. at 390. This argument deserves no further comment. We\nproceed now to Hyatt's more substantial arguments.\n                   C. The Agency Relationship\n         Hyatt's main argument is that the district court erred\nin granting judgment in favor of 35 Acres because Hyatt raised\ngenuine issues of material fact precluding summary judgment.\nFirst we will discuss the law applicable to the termination of\nagency agreements, and then we will consider Hyatt's specific\narguments.\n                      1. The Applicable Law\n         As the district court correctly noted, agency\nprinciples as expressed in the Restatements govern this case.\nSection 118 of the Restatement (Second) of Agency (1958) states\nthat an agent's \"[a]uthority terminates if the principal or the\nagent manifests to the other dissent to its continuance.\"\nComment (b) explains:\n         The principal has power to revoke . . .\n         although doing so is in violation of a\n         contract between the parties and although the\n         authority is expressed to be irrevocable. A\n         statement in a contract that the authority\n         cannot be terminated by either party is\n         effective only to create liability for its\n         wrongful termination.\n         The only exception to the rule that principals may\nterminate an agency relationship at any time is when the\nauthority granted to the agent is a \"power given as security.\"\n\fId. ยงยง 138, 139. Section 138 of the Restatement states:\n         A power given as security is a power to\n         affect the legal relations of another,\n         created in the form of an agency authority,\n         but held for the benefit of the power holder\n         or a third person and given to secure the\n         performance of a duty or to protect a title,\n         either legal or equitable, such power being\n         given when the duty or title is created or\n         given for consideration.\n         Comment (b) to section 138 of the Restatement explains\nthat \"[a] power given as security is one held for the benefit of\na person other than the power giver [i.e. principal].\" A\nprincipal can terminate an agency power given as security \"only\nin accordance with the agreement by which the power was created.\"\nId. ยง 139 cmt. a. On the other hand, the power giver can revoke\nthe power if it was created only for the benefit of the power\ngiver, i.e., when there is a simple agency relationship. If the\nagent has an interest in the exercise of the power only because\nof the compensation to which it is entitled upon its exercise,\nthen the power is not given as security and is revocable.\n         A principal may grant an irrevocable agency power for\nthe purpose either of furnishing a security to protect a debt or\nother duty, or facilitating the performance, effectuating the\nobjects, or securing the benefits of a contract. See id. ยง 138\ncmt. c. For example, a power given as security arises when a\nperson manifests consent that the one to whom it is given\nproperly can act to protect a title already in the power holder.\nId. cmt. a. Moreover, if an agent has an interest in the subject\nmatter of the agency, as where it engages in a joint enterprise\nor invests in a business in which another supplies the subject\nmatter, a power given it by the other to protect such interest is\na power given as a security. See id. cmt. b.; see also Bowling\nv. National Convoy & Trucking Co., 135 So. 541, 543-44 (Fla.\n1931); Haft v. Haft, 671 A.2d 413, 422-23 (Del. Ch. 1995). In\nany of these circumstances, a power given as a security cannot be\nterminated at the whim of the power giver. See Restatement\n(Second) of Agency ยง 14H cmt. a.\n         The Restatement provides illustrations of a power given\nto protect the property interest of the power holder (i.e., the\nagent) in the subject matter of the agency, as well as a power\ngiven to secure a duty or obligation owed to the agent. While\nthe illustrations focus on the protected interest as held by the\nagent or power holder, it is clear that the agency is also\nirrevocable if made for the benefit of a third person, although\nthe agency can be terminated with the consent of the third-party\nbeneficiary. Moreover, agency powers granted both for the\nbenefit of the principal and the agent are irrevocable. SeeRestatement\n(Second) of Agency ยง 138 cmt. d (\"A person authorized\nto act as agent may also hold a power for his own benefit.\").\n         An indispensable feature of a power given as security\nis that the agent have a proprietary interest in the res or\nsubject matter of the agency independent of the agency\nrelationship itself. As the district court noted, Professor\n\fWilliston's comments on this subject are instructive:\n              In order that a power may be irrevocable\n         because it is coupled with an interest, it is\n         necessary that the interest be in the subject\n         matter of the power and not in the proceeds\n         which will arise from the exercise of the\n         power . . . .\n\n         . . . [T]he person clothed with the authority\n         must derive a present or future interest in\n         the subject itself on which the power is to\n         be exercised . . . . In short, the test is:\n\n              Does the agent have an interest or\n         estate in the subject matter of the agency\n         independent of the power conferred, or does\n         the interest or estate accrue by or after the\n         exercise of the power conferred?\n\n              If the former, it is an agency coupled\n         with an interest . . . if the latter, it is\n         not.\nGovernment Guarantee Fund v. Hyatt Corp., 166 F.R.D. at 327-28,\n(quoting 2 Samuel Williston, A Treatise on the Law of Contracts ยง\n280, at 300-02 (3d ed. 1959)). Thus, in the words of the\ndistrict court, \"the agency relationship itself does not create\nthe interest; the agency merely serves to protect the separately\ngranted or created interest when the two are coupled.\" Id. at\n328.\n               2. The District Court's Disposition\n         In its memorandum of January 8, 1996, granting 35\nAcres' motion to dismiss Hyatt's complaint in Civil No. 1995-68,\nthe district court indicated that, \"[f]or Hyatt to claim that its\nagency authority is . . . a power given as security, it must have\nalleged that the agreements were entered into for [its] benefit .\n. . either to protect a property interest of Hyatt's in the hotel\nor to secure the performance of some duty or obligation owed to\nHyatt.\" Government Guarantee Fund v. Hyatt Corp., 1996 WL\n165008, at *3. Because Hyatt failed to allege such an interest,\nthe district court dismissed count one of Hyatt's second amended\ncomplaint at that time. Id. The court thereafter held that any\nagency under the management agreement was revocable and had been\nterminated. Id.\n         In its January 8, 1996 memorandum the district court\nfirst noted that Hyatt's own pleadings established that 35 Acres\nhad terminated the agency:\n         Hyatt concedes that 35 Acres sent it letters\n         that 35 Acres 'considered Hyatt's management\n         agreement \"void, terminated and/or expired\"'\n         and demanding Hyatt `immediately surrender\n         possession' of the Hotel. (Second Amended\n         Complaint at 2.) Indisputably, such letters\n         manifested 35 Acres' dissent to the\n         continuance of the agency relationship with\n\f            Hyatt -- all that is required for an agency\n            to be terminated under the Restatement.\n            Restatement (Second) of Agency, ยง 118.\nId..     The court held that Hyatt could not continue to manage the\nhotel:\n           Thus, assuming all the facts alleged in the\n           complaint are true, the relationship between\n           Hyatt and 35 Acres is a simple agency; and\n           Hyatt has not demonstrated any legal basis\n           for a declaration that the agency has not\n           been terminated or that Hyatt may continue as\n           manager of the hotel.\nId..\n         The district court noted that it had considered Hyatt's\ncontentions that the management agreement created an irrevocable\nagency coupled with an interest: \"Hyatt wants to argue that the\nmanagement agreements constitute an agency coupled with an\ninterest which cannot be summarily revoked.\" Id. The court\nheld, however, that Hyatt failed to present any basis for such a\nconclusion:\n         In its second amended complaint, Hyatt has\n         alleged no property interest in the hotel;\n         nor has Hyatt alleged that the authority was\n         granted to secure the performance of any duty\n         owed to it. Hyatt's only asserted interest\n         is in the compensation due it as manager of\n         the hotel, the benefit to its reputation, and\n         an enhanced presence in the Caribbean. Such\n         interests are ordinary incidents of an agency\n         relationship and standing alone do not\n         support an inference that the agreements were\n         entered into for the benefit of Hyatt as\n         opposed to the benefit of the owner. In sum,\n         Hyatt simply does not allege any interest in\n         the hotel aside from its interest in reaping\n         the benefits from acting as 35 Acres' agent.\nId.\n         Moreover, the district court noted that the management\nagreement did not even recite that it created an agency coupled\nwith an interest. Id. at *3 n.7. The court concluded that:\n\"Whether or not Hyatt breached the agreements does not change the\nreality that under the facts alleged by Hyatt, the agency\nrelationship has terminated and Hyatt cannot continue acting as\nmanager of the Hotel.\" Id. at *4.\n         Later, at the hearing on March 6, 1996, the district\ncourt addressed 35 Acres' motion for partial summary judgment,\nthe grant of which led to this appeal. At the conclusion of that\nhearing the court stated as follows:\n         I do not see any basis for changing the\n         Court's previous ruling. I haven't heard\n         anything and I don't, haven't seen anything\n         in Hyatt's proposed amended complaint that\n         when it's read together with the management\n         agreement and the other facts that are\n\f         undisputed in this case -- and those are\n         basically as 35 Acres has stated, that they\n         own the property, that Hyatt has no title\n         ownership, no right of possession as a result\n         of any ownership. It is an agent of 35 Acres\n         only. The management agreement was the only\n         instrument which gives them the right to be\n         there and I don't see any reason to go\n         outside the four corners of the management\n         agreement. It's whatever the negotiations,\n         whatever the intentions were, whatever the\n         desires were, whoever came up first to me is\n         not, does not help to explain anything in the\n         management agreement.\n\n         . . . .\n\n         So, I will, say, reduce that to a written\n         order as soon as possible. I would suggest\n         that counsel get together and you work out\n         whatever is necessary to be able to have\n         Hyatt leave the premises in terms of any\n         items that Mr. Cole mentioned, so that order\n         won't be imposed on Hyatt; it will simply be\n         an agreed-upon to the extent they can agree\n         upon it and maybe if you can get together\n         with Judge Barnard. And if you can't resolve\n         it, I'll resolve it.\n\n         . . . And it should be done within good --\n         from Hyatt. If you don't want to do that,\n         then you will have to do it the hard way.\n         But I certainly think it would be in your\n         interest to do it cooperatively. So, that is\n         the Court's ruling.\nApp. at 2155-57.\n         In its April 10, 1996 opinion the district court issued\na written confirmation of its March 6, 1996 rulings. The court\nreferenced decisions that have held as a matter of law that chain\nhotel management contracts create a typical revocable agency, not\nan irrevocable agency coupled with an interest.

Further, the\ncourt addressed Hyatt's argument that the management agreement\ncreated some sort of \"joint enterprise\" between itself and the\nprior owner of the hotel:\n         Hyatt's claim of some sort of joint\n         ventureship or enterprise is foreclosed by\n         the unambiguous language of that document.\n         Section 3.8 of the Management Agreement\n         provides:\n\f              Nothing in this Agreement contained\n              shall constitute, or be construed\n              to create, a partnership, joint\n              venture or lease between Owner and\n              Hyatt with respect to the Hotel.\n166 F.R.D. at 328.\n         The court noted that the management agreement could not\nbe construed as creating a new business entity because, even if\nHyatt's management fee was construed as a share of the profits,\nHyatt never undertook to share in the losses of any such\nenterprise: \"In fact, the Management Agreement was structured so\nthat Hyatt would receive a management fee even when the Hotel\nsuffered a loss.\" Id.\n         The court also considered Hyatt's argument that the\nmanagement agreement created a power given as security to protect\nits intellectual property, which was to be used by Hyatt in\ncarrying out its duties on behalf of the owner. The court held\nthat Hyatt's contentions regarding protecting its reputation and\nits trade name did not warrant a result any different from that\nin prior cases concerning chain hotel management contracts that\ncreated revocable agencies. Id. at 329 & n.21 (citing Pacific\nLandmark Hotel, 23 Cal. Rptr. 2d 555; Woolley v. Embassy Suites,\n278 Cal. Rptr. 719). Thus, the court held that:\n              The plain language of the Management\n         Agreement shows, and the undisputed facts of\n         this case definitively establish, that the\n         agency was created for the benefit of the\n         owner, not Hyatt, and that Hyatt's sole\n         interest in the Management Agreement is its\n         right to compensation. As such, the\n         Management Agreement was a personal services\n         contract which cannot be specifically\n         enforced. Restatement of the Law (Second)\n         Contracts, ยง 367(1) (1981).\n166 F.R.D. at 329.\n         In explaining why it would be inappropriate to order\nspecific performance of the management agreement, the district\ncourt found the rationale stated in Woolley v. Embassy Suitesconvincing:\n              There are a variety of reasons why\n         courts are loathe to order specific\n         performance of personal services contracts.\n         Such an order would impose upon the court the\n         prodigious if not impossible task of passing\n         judgment on the quality of performance. It\n         would also run contrary to the Thirteenth\n         Amendment's prohibition against involuntary\n         servitude. Courts wish to avoid the friction\n         and social costs which result when the\n         parties are reunited in a relationship that\n         has already failed, especially where the\n         services involve mutual confidence and the\n         exercise of discretionary authority.\n         Finally, it is impractical to require\n         judicial oversight of a contract which calls\n\f         for special knowledge, skill, or ability.\nId. at 329-30 (quoting Woolley v. Embassy Suites, 278 Cal. Rptr.\nat 727).\n                 3. Hyatt's Arguments on Appeal\n         For the most part, Hyatt's arguments on appeal are the\nsame as those it made in the district court. As we agree both\nwith that court's decision and its reasoning, we only need\ndiscuss the specifics of arguments not addressed by the district\ncourt.\n         Hyatt argues that it presented competent evidence to\nthe district court that demonstrated the irrevocability of its\nagency agreement with Great Cruz. Specifically, Hyatt asserts\nthat its agency \"exceeds the mere management of physical property\nand extends to the operation of a comprehensive and complex\nbusiness\" that is reflected in the scope of its rights under the\nmanagement agreement. Br. at 36. Thus, the subject matter of\nHyatt's agency is \"not limited to the real and personal property\nof the Resort, but includes the operation of the business of the\nResort.\" Id. at 37.\n         Hyatt relies on decisions of courts that have held that\nan irrevocable agency is created where \"an agent makes a\nsubstantial contribution to or capital investment in a business\nenterprise while assuming significant managerial responsibilities\nover that business.\" Br. at 38 (citing Bowling v. National\nConvoy & Trucking Co., 135 So. at 543; Haft v. Haft, 671 A.2d at\n423); Montgomery v. Foreman, 410 So.2d 1160, 1167-68 (La. Ct.\nApp. 1982); MacDonald v. Rosenfeld, 188 P.2d 519, 521, 528 (Cal.\nCt. App. 1948); Jones v. Williams, 39 S.W. 486, 493-94 (Mo.\n1897)). Hyatt claims that it submitted overwhelming evidence in\nthe district court of its agreement with Great Cruz to use the\nreal property and improvements thereon to create a new business\nenterprise, the \"Hyatt Regency St. John.\" Hyatt claims that it\nwas the catalyst in establishing that business, and that:\n         Its capital contributions and investments to\n         the business included lending the use of its\n         registered trademarks and service marks;\n         providing proprietary and confidential\n         information, programs, and systems with\n         respect to sales, marketing, and operations;\n         and making the resort an integral member of\n         the `Hyatt' worldwide chain of hotels and\n         resorts.\nBr. at 38. Hyatt also claims that \"to protect and secure its\neconomic interests in the new business, Hyatt assumed control of\nthe management of that business as well as the day-to-day\noperations, and thereby was invested with certain powers of\nagency.\" Id. at 39. According to Hyatt, those powers were\ngranted for its benefit and, thus, are irrevocable.\n         Like the district court, we decline to accept Hyatt's\ntheory that it has \"proven the creation of a resort business and\nits contributions to and investments in that business, its\nprofits interests therein, and its insistence upon and receipt of\nmanagerial powers to protect those contributions, investments,\nand interests,\" br. at 38 n.9, in the face of the clear language\n\fin the management agreement that:\n              Nothing in this Agreement contained\n         shall constitute, or be construed to be or to\n         create, a partnership, joint venture or lease\n         between Owner and Hyatt with respect to the\n         Hotel.\nManagement agreement, ยง 3.8; app. at 1828. Moreover, none of the\ncases Hyatt cites to support its argument are aligned factually\nwith this case. See, e.g., MacDonald v. Rosenfeld, 188 P.2d at\n528 (\"The evidence supports the view that defendant was granted\n`a power coupled with an interest' in that he was given the\nmanagement of the business as security for the loans he had\nmade.\"); Jones v. Williams, 39 S.W. at 493 (\"Under the contract,\nplaintiff purchased 1,667 shares of stock in the corporation, for\nwhich he paid $80,000; and, in consideration thereof, he was to\nhave the `control and management' of the Post Dispatch for five\nyears, at an annual salary of $10,000.\"); Bowling v. National\nConvoy & Trucking Co., 135 So. at 543 (affirming holding that\nagency was coupled with interest in business founded by agent);\nMontgomery v. Foreman, 410 So.2d at 1167 (\"Thus it was\ncontemplated that [the agent] would recoup the monies he spent in\nimproving the property[.]\"); Haft v. Haft, 671 A.2d at 423\n(irrevocable stock voting proxy given as security for note and\nother interests retained in corporation as well as security for\npayment of purchase price of transfer of stock at issue). Thus,\nwe reject as a matter of law Hyatt's argument that it possessed\nan irrevocable agency due to its part in the creation of a new\nbusiness enterprise. Hyatt has raised no genuine issue of\nmaterial fact that alters our conclusion.\n         Hyatt next argues that its contribution of its\ntrademarks and trade names, chain services, and management\nexpertise was and is \"an integral and valuable part of the\nbusiness known as the `Hyatt Regency St. John.'\" Br. at 41.\nHyatt claims that the combination of those contributions created\nand continue to add value to the goodwill of the business, and\nthat the goodwill in turn is a major factor in the ability and\ncapacity of the hotel to generate profits. Hyatt claims that to\nsecure and protect those investments, it negotiated and acquired\nrights to manage the business. Therefore, Hyatt asserts that the\nrelationship created by the agreements among the parties was an\nirrevocable agency which 35 Acres could not terminate except in\naccordance with the express termination provisions set forth in\nthe parties' agreements.\n         As a matter of law, we agree with the district court\nthat Hyatt's contribution of its trademarks and trade names,\nchain services, and management expertise to the hotel was merely\na normal incident of an agency relationship, and did not create\nan irrevocable agency. Again, Hyatt has raised no genuine issue\nof material fact to alter our conclusion.\n         Hyatt next attempts to distinguish the two decisions of\nthe California Court of Appeals on which the district court\nrelied in ruling that Hyatt's agency is revocable. First, Hyatt\nexplains that, in Woolley v. Embassy Suites, \"Embassy Suites had\na license agreement which was separate from and independent of\n\fits management agreement and, therefore, it could not\nsuccessfully argue that the managerial powers were given to it in\norder to protect and secure its intellectual property, which was\nthe subject of the separate license agreement.\" Br. at 42. SeeWoolley,\n278 Cal. Rptr. at 726 (\"Embassy says that this agency is\ndifferent because the hotels are franchised with the Embassy name\nand that it therefore has its own interest in their success. But\nthe franchise agreements are severable and independent from the\nmanagement contracts[.]\").\n         Next, Hyatt attempts to distinguish Pacific Landmark\nHotel by stating that in that case an irrevocable agency would\nhave existed had there been a legal identity between the Marriott\nentity that managed the hotel and the Marriott entity that held\nan interest in the hotel business. Since that was not the case,\nHyatt states that the legal separateness between the two was the\nsole factor in the court's refusal to find an irrevocable agency.\nBr. at 42; see Pacific Landmark Hotel, 23 Cal. Rptr. 2d at 563\n(\"[T]he trial court was disregarding the separate corporate\nentities . . . when it found MHI had an interest in the subject\nof the agency. . . . [T]he trial court erred in failing to treat\nMHI as separate from its parent corporation Marriott.\").\n         Hyatt argues that the facts in this case are materially\ndifferent from those in Woolley v. Embassy Suites and in Pacific\nLandmark Hotel. Hyatt asserts that it permitted its intellectual\nproperty (including its registered trademarks and trade names) to\nbe used in connection with the hotel only because it insisted\nupon and received agency powers to manage the resort. Moreover,\nthe entity that owns the \"Hyatt\" and \"Hyatt Regency\" trademarks\nand trade names and that holds an interest in the resort business\nknown as the \"Hyatt Regency St. John\" is the same entity that\nobtained for its benefit the right to manage the resort --\nnamely, Hyatt Corporation. Hyatt thus claims that the two\nCalifornia cases are distinguishable.\n         We do not agree with Hyatt's reading of the two\nCalifornia cases. While it is true that the specific facts of\nthe cases differ from the case before us, their legal holdings\nare instructive here. In Pacific Landmark Hotel even though a\nMarriott affiliate had invested loans of $15 million and $8\nmillion in capital contributions, pursuant to which the affiliate\nreceived a five percent ownership interest in the limited\npartnerships that owned the real estate and 95-99% of the tax\nbenefits of those partnerships, the court held as a matter of law\nthat the management agreements did not create an agency with an\ninterest in favor of Marriott Hotels, Inc., which was the\nmanager. 23 Cal. Rptr. 2d at 557, 560-63.\n         Moreover, even though Marriott's management contracts\nprovided for Marriott Hotels, Inc. to receive 30% of available\ncash flow for 60 years as part of its management fee and\npresumably Marriott, like Hyatt, contracted to use its trade name\nand trademarks in providing its management services, the court\nheld as a matter of law that the relationship was not an\nirrevocable agency. 23 Cal. Rptr. 2d at 557, 562-63. Given\nprovisions that unambiguously provided that the agreements were\nbetween principal and agent and did not create a lease,\n\fpartnership or joint venture, as a matter of law the agency could\nbe terminated. Id. at 560-63. The court held that the absence\nof a specific present property interest was dispositive.\n         In addition, the dispute in Woolley v. Embassy Suitesinvolved\ntermination of Embassy Suites' management of nine hotels\nthat were under management contract, not termination of a\nfranchise or license agreement. 278 Cal. Rptr. at 721 & n.1.\nLike Hyatt, Embassy Suites argued that the court should ignore\nthe express contractual provisions negating any partnership or\njoint venture, but the court found those provisions dispositive.\nId. at 724-26. Embassy Suites, like Hyatt, argued that the use\nof its trade name turned the management agreements into an agency\nwith an interest, and the court rejected those contentions for\nthe lack of any specific present property interest. Id. at 726.\nThe district court accurately analyzed the effect of the case:\n         Like Hyatt, the defendant in Woolley v.\n         Embassy Suites, Inc., 278 Cal. Rptr. 719\n         (Cal. App. 1991), argued that its interest in\n         the success and prestige of its trade name\n         was sufficient to create an irrevocable\n         agency. The Court squarely rejected that\n         claim, noting that `the \"interest\" Embassy\n         has in seeing the hotels succeed so as to\n         enhance its reputation and prestige is not\n         the type of . . . interest necessary to\n         constitute an agency coupled with an\n         interest.' Id. at 726. Hyatt attempts to\n         distinguish Woolley by pointing to the fact\n         that the use of the Embassy Suites trade name\n         in that case was secured by a separate\n         franchise agreement. In our view, this fact\n         militates against the presence of an\n         irrevocable agency here. If the use of\n         Hyatt's intellectual property were protected\n         by a franchise agreement then the Owner\n         potentially could use Hyatt's trademarks and\n         trade names even after the agency ended.\n         Arguably, a separate clause linking the\n         franchise agreement to the agency\n         relationship might be needed to protect the\n         agent's interest. Here, termination of the\n         Management Agreement cancels the owner's\n         right to use Hyatt's intellectual property.\nGovernment Guarantee Fund v. Hyatt Corp., 166 F.R.D. at 329 n.21.\n         In short, we agree with the district court that the two\nCalifornia cases are instructive in this case and that, as a\nmatter of law, Hyatt's interest in protecting its trademarks and\nservice specialties is not sufficient to form an irrevocable\nagency. Hyatt has raised no genuine issue of material fact to\nalter our decision.\n         Hyatt next claims that it has raised genuine issues of\ndisputed fact with regard to the \"effectiveness of 35 Acres'\npurported termination letter of March 21, 1995.\" Br. at 43. As\nwe already have indicated the district court noted that:\n\f         Hyatt concedes that 35 Acres sent it letters\n         that 35 Acres `considered Hyatt's management\n         agreement \"void, terminated and/or expired\"'\n         and demanding Hyatt `immediately surrender\n         possession' of the Hotel. (Second Amended\n         Complaint at 2.) Indisputably, such letters\n         manifested 35 Acres' dissent to the\n         continuance of the agency relationship with\n         Hyatt -- all that is required for an agency\n         to be terminated under the Restatement.\n         Restatement (Second) of Agency, ยง 118.\nGovernment Guarantee Fund v. Hyatt Corp., 1996 WL 165008, at *3.\nWe find here no genuine issue of material fact to alter our\ndecision.\n         Hyatt finally claims that 35 Acres materially breached\nand wrongfully repudiated the management agreement by purporting\nto terminate Hyatt. \"The only proof in the summary judgment\nrecord showed that Hyatt complied fully with its obligations.\"\nBr. at 45. Hyatt claims that it therefore has submitted\ncompetent evidence supporting affirmative defenses. In light of\nour decision that Hyatt's agency was revocable, we find this\nargument meritless.\n         One final issue with respect to termination of Hyatt's\nmanagement agreement deserves our attention. It is true that a\nsubordination, non-disturbance, and attornment agreement set\nforth the rights of the parties should Skopbank foreclose its\nmortgage from Great Cruz, including a warrant by Skopbank that\nthe management agreement would remain undisturbed by any\nforeclosure or default and would continue in full force and\neffect as long as Hyatt was not in default.   (Subordination\nAgreement at ยงยง 2, 3; app. at 548). Hyatt's seeking of this\nsubordination agreement indicates impressive foresight on its\npart; indeed, the subordination agreement even could be construed\nto indicate intent among the parties that the management\nagreement itself be irrevocable.\n         However, as noted by the district court, \"management\nagreements between the owner of a hotel and a managing\ncorporation do not create an agency coupled with an interest,\neven if the agreements state that they do.\" Government Guarantee\nFund v. Hyatt Corp., 1996 WL 165008 at *3 n.7 (citing Woolley v.\nEmbassy Suites, 278 Cal. Rptr. 719; Pacific Landmark Hotel, 23\nCal. Rptr. 2d 555. Surely, if agreements that by their terms are\nirrevocable, thus manifesting the parties' intent that they be\nso, are not necessarily irrevocable, intent manifested by the\nseparate creation of a subordination agreement does not create a\npower coupled with an interest. Thus, while the subordination\nagreement may be very significant in a determination of whether\n35 Acres wrongfully terminated Hyatt's management agreement, it\ndoes not affect our result here. Whether or not an agency\nagreement is revocable is a matter of law. See Pacific Landmark\nHotel, 23 Cal. Rptr. 2d at 561 (\"[E]ven if the parties intended\nto create an irrevocable agency, one coupled with an interest,\nunless they do so and such an interest does in fact exist, the\nstatutory power to revoke may be exercised. If the exercise of\n\fthe statutory revocation power is contractually unjustified,\ndamages may be in order.\"); Woolley v. Embassy Suites, 278 Cal.\nRptr. at 725 (\"Even if the contract did attempt to restrict the\npower of the owner to terminate the manager, such provision would\nbe ineffective. The principal's power of revocation is absolute\nand applies even if doing so is a violation of the contract or\nthe agency is characterized as `irrevocable.'\") (citing\nRestatement (Second) of Agency ยง 118 cmt. b).\n         Accordingly, we will affirm the district court's grant\nof 35 Acres' motion for partial summary judgment, since Hyatt has\nraised no genuine issue of material fact and 35 Acres is entitled\nto judgment as a matter of law on the issue of the management\nagreement's revocability.\n            D. Remedies Granted by the District Court\n         Hyatt's next argument is that the district court erred\nin granting 35 Acres relief and imposing obligations on Hyatt\nthat neither were requested by 35 Acres nor supported in the\nsummary judgment record. We review issues regarding the relief\nfashioned by the district court for abuse of discretion only.\nSee United States v. Triple A Mach. Shop, Inc., 857 F.2d 579, 583\n(9th Cir. 1988) (affirming district court's grant of partial\nsummary judgment and permanent injunction enjoining former\nlessees from remaining on property); see generally McLendon v.\nContinental Can Co., 908 F.2d 1171, 1177 (3d Cir. 1990).\n         Hyatt notes that paragraph 3 of the district court's\norder of May 3, 1996, requires it, among other things, to turn\nover to 35 Acres: keys, alarm access codes, key cards, other\nmeans of access and egress thereto, books, records,\ncorrespondence, documents, computer and electronically-maintained\nrecords, reservations information, furniture, fixtures,\nequipment, vehicles, documents of title and receipts, cash,\ncoupons, instruments for the payment of money, certificates of\ndeposit, accounts receivable, contract rights, intangible\npersonal property, and all other personal property relating to\nthe operation of the resort. Br. at 45. Hyatt argues that 35\nAcres did not satisfy the burden imposed upon parties seeking\nmandatory injunctive relief, and that this portion of the\ndistrict court's judgment should be reversed.\n         Further, Hyatt notes that in paragraph 5 of the May 3,\n1996 order, the district court ordered that:\n         Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 70, 35 Acres\n         Associates shall be entitled to All Writs\n         which may be necessary to effectuate the\n         foregoing, whether by Ejectment, Abatement,\n         Assistance, Sequestration, Execution,\n         Garnishment, or otherwise, and the Clerk\n         shall issue the same, as necessary, without\n         further order of this Court.\nHyatt argues that Rule 70 does not authorize the plethora of\nextraordinary personal property remedies that the district court\ngranted to 35 Acres, and that we therefore should reverse this\nportion of the judgment.\n         Finally, Hyatt notes that paragraph 3(h) of the May\n3, 1996 order provides that \"Hyatt Corporation may not remove any\n\fpersonal property from the Hotel Property other than items of\npersonal property belonging to individual employees of Hyatt\nCorporation.\" Br. at 46 (citing app. at 2340). Noting that, in\nparagraph 4, the district court did permit Hyatt to segregate,\nseal, and/or designate its privileged documents, proprietary\ncommercial materials, and personal property located on the resort\npremises, but effectively prohibited Hyatt from removing its\nproperty except \"in accordance with further Order of this Court,\"\napp. at 2341-42, Hyatt argues that nothing in the summary\njudgment record justifies a court order interfering with or\ndepriving Hyatt of its rights of use, enjoyment, and possession\nof its own property. Hyatt therefore argues that this portion of\nthe district court's judgment should be reversed.\n         After a thorough review of the record, we see nothing\nin the relief fashioned by the district court that we could term\nan abuse of that court's discretion. Obviously the termination\nof Hyatt's presence in the hotel raised fairly complex practical\nproblems, and we will not fault the district court for\neffectuating the transition in a common sense way. Therefore, we\nwill affirm in its entirety the judgment of the district court.\n                       E. Attorney's Fees\n         Hyatt's final issue is a challenge to the district\ncourt's statement in the memorandum accompanying its May 3, 1996\norder, that, because of \"Hyatt's stubborn refusal to vacate the\npremises,\" Hyatt would \"bear any costs and attorney's fees\nincurred by 35 Acres related to its efforts in securing [the May\n3, 1996 order].\" Government Guarantee Fund v. Hyatt Corp., No.\n1995-49, slip op. at 3 (D.V.I. May 3, 1996). Hyatt argues that\nthe district court imposed these \"sanctions\" for the first time\nin its memorandum without any notice or hearing, implicating\nfundamental notions of due process. Moreover, Hyatt argues that\nbecause the district court did not identify the rule or statute\nunder which it imposed these \"sanctions,\" it is impossible for an\nappellate court to determine if the court applied the correct\nstandard. Accordingly, Hyatt argues that we should reverse the\ndistrict court's award of \"sanctions\" against Hyatt.\n         The law is clear that awards of costs and attorneys'\nfees are not appealable until the court determines their amount.\nSee, e.g., Apex Fountain Sales, Inc. v. Kleinfeld, 27 F.3d 931,\n935 (3d Cir. 1994); Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. Flaherty, 983\nF.2d 1267, 1276-77 (3d Cir. 1993). Consequently inasmuch as the\ndistrict court has not quantified the fees and costs there is no\norder with respect to them that is final for the purpose of\nappellate review. Therefore, Hyatt's challenge to the district\ncourt's statement in its memorandum regarding the bearing of\ncosts and attorneys' fees is premature. Accordingly, we will\ndismiss this part of the appeal for lack of appellate\njurisdiction.\n                        IV. CONCLUSION\n         For all the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the\ndistrict court's order of April 10, 1996, granting 35 Acres'\nmotion for partial summary judgment in its entirety and the order\nof May 3, 1996, providing for the transition of management and\nwill dismiss for lack of appellate jurisdiction the part of\n\fHyatt's appeal relating to attorneys' fees and costs. We vacate\nthe stay in our order of May 20, 1996. Finally, we will remand\nthe case to the district court for further proceedings on the\nremaing aspect of the case.\n\f",

INTRODUCTION\n         Hyatt Corporation is the manager of a resort hotel on\nSt. John in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Hyatt's management powers\narise from agreements executed in March 1990 among Hyatt, Great\nCruz Bay Development Co., Inc. (\"Great Cruz\"), the owner of the\nhotel, and Great Cruz's lender, Saastopankkien Keskus-Osake-\nPankki (\"Skopbank\"). After Skopbank foreclosed on the property\nin 1991, 35 Acres Associates purchased the hotel pursuant to a\njudicial sale. Immediately thereafter, 35 Acres purported to\nterminate Hyatt's management of the hotel, propelling the parties\ninto this acrimonious litigation. The district court, on cross-\nmotions for summary judgment, entered an order granting 35 Acres'\nmotion for partial summary judgment on April 10, 1996, thus\nterminating Hyatt's presence at the hotel, and ordering the\nparties to \"work together to effect a smooth transition in the\nmanagement and operation of the Hotel.\" The court certified its\norder as a final judgment pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b) on\nMay 3, 1996.\n         Hyatt now appeals from the district court's grant of\npartial summary judgment to 35 Acres. The parties agree that\n\fthis appeal focuses only on issues concerning 35 Acres' power to\nterminate Hyatt's agency and 35 Acres' right of possession of the\nhotel and related property together with issues relating to the\ntransition of the management of the hotel. The district court\nhad subject matter jurisdiction under either 28 U.S.C. ยง\n1332(a)(2) (action between citizens of a state and citizens or\nsubjects of a foreign state) or 28 U.S.C. ยง 1332(a)(3) (action\nbetween citizens of different states in which citizens or\nsubjects of a foreign state are additional parties). The amount\nin controversy exceeds $50,000, exclusive of interest and costs.\nWe have jurisdiction over the appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1291\nand exercise plenary review over the grant of partial summary\njudgment and abuse of discretion review over the court's\ntransition order.\n\n         II.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n                      A. Factual Background\n         In view of the procedural posture of the case we\npresent the facts in a light most favorable to Hyatt. From June\n1988 through March 1990 Skopbank, a Finnish corporation, loaned\nGreat Cruz and St. John Virgin Grand Villas Associates\napproximately $120 million for the construction and operation of\nthe property which became known as the \"Hyatt Regency St. John at\nthe Virgin Grand Resort.\" In 1989 representatives of Great Cruz\napproached Hyatt to enlist its assistance in addressing\noperational and financial problems of the resort. Great Cruz\nsought a professional, experienced, and financially able hotel\ncompany with a strong global brand identity and a proven ability\nin the Caribbean to attract business, so that the resort's value\nand profitability could be maximized.\n         Specifically, Great Cruz proposed that the resort bear\nthe \"Hyatt\" and \"Hyatt Regency\" registered trademarks and trade\nnames; that the resort join the \"Hyatt\" chain and participate in\nHyatt's comprehensive and proprietary chain-wide programs and\nservices (including, without limitation, Hyatt's global\nreservations system; worldwide marketing, public relations, and\nadvertising services; employee training programs; and home office\nand regional sales office convention, business, and promotion\nservices); and that Hyatt manage the resort. Great Cruz\nparticularly sought the use of the prestigious \"Hyatt\" name and\nHyatt's commitment to use its expertise to ensure the success of\nthe resort. With the encouragement of Skopbank, Great Cruz was\nlooking for a company to maximize the economic potential of the\nresort.\n         Hyatt was reticent to commit the \"Hyatt\" and \"Hyatt\nRegency\" names to the resort because of the resort's historically\npoor performance, its financial structure, and the fact that the\nquality and consistency of service, facilities, and amenities\nprovided by Great Cruz fell far below Hyatt's quality standards.\nThus, Hyatt believed that there was substantial economic and\nreputational risk in allowing the resort to be known as a \"Hyatt\nRegency.\"\n         During the negotiations leading to the execution of the\nagreements, Hyatt informed Great Cruz that the \"Hyatt\" and \"Hyatt\n\fRegency\" trademarks, service marks, and trade names were worth\nbillions of dollars to Hyatt's owners and represented decades of\ntime, effort, and financial risk. Hyatt's reputation as a\npremier resort manager was nowhere higher than in the Caribbean,\nwhere it had established itself as the predominant chain.\nMoreover, Hyatt informed Great Cruz that, even with Hyatt's\nspecial knowledge of resort-building and its established\nrelationships with customers and vendors, it would take three to\nfive years from the opening of the resort under the Hyatt name to\nstabilize its operations and to begin to realize the full\npotential of the location so that Hyatt could derive the level of\nfinancial benefits justifying its participation. Hyatt informed\nGreat Cruz that it only would consider establishing the resort as\na \"Hyatt Regency\" if Great Cruz agreed to conditions that would\nensure Hyatt both the power to control the resort's business and\nan adequate share in the resort's long-term profits that Hyatt\nbelieved its contributions could generate.\n         Hyatt informed Great Cruz during these negotiations\nthat it would not permit the hotel to be known as a \"Hyatt\" or\n\"Hyatt Regency\" or agree to the inclusion of the resort in its\nworldwide chain unless it also was given powers to protect its\ncontributions to the resort. Hyatt decided that it was\nabsolutely necessary for it to have the power to control the\nquality of the resort facility as well as the quality of services\nprovided by the hotel by assuming managerial and operational\nresponsibilities for the resort. Hyatt, Great Cruz, and Skopbank\ntherefore agreed to structure their contracts deliberately and\ncarefully to accomplish those objectives to protect Hyatt.\n         During the negotiations among Hyatt, Great Cruz, and\nSkopbank, Hyatt analyzed the resort's highly-leveraged financial\nstructure and other issues associated with the resort's financial\nsituation. With such considerations in mind, Hyatt informed\nGreat Cruz that it was willing to consider a financial structure\nwhereby Hyatt invested time and effort and not seek a substantial\nportion of its normal management fees in exchange for an interest\nin the enterprise affording it a return on its investment, to be\ntaken in the form of a long-term profit participation. Thus,\nHyatt explains that, in order \"to protect the investments and\nproperty it would contribute as part of its undertaking to build\nthe business of the Resort, [it] required an interest in the\nprofits of the `Hyatt Regency St. John.'\" Br. at 15.\nAccordingly, Hyatt demanded and Great Cruz consented to a formula\nunder which Hyatt potentially would receive a significant return\non its investment. Although, in Hyatt's assessment, the formula\ncontained a low front-end fixed management fee, it also included\na substantial back-end share of profits that the parties\nspecifically designed to reflect Hyatt's \"capital investment in\nthe property,\" id., which included Hyatt's contribution of the\ndifference between its typical market rate front-end fees and the\nfees applicable in this case.\n         Further, to protect its interests, Hyatt negotiated for\nand obtained a 30-year term for the management agreement between\nit and Great Cruz which the parties agreed could not be\nterminated except in strict compliance with its express\n\ftermination provisions. Hyatt explains that, given its\nsubstantial \"capital investments\" in the hotel and the time\nrequired to reap a return on its investments, it was not willing\nto assume the risk that Great Cruz (or a subsequent owner) could\nrevoke and terminate the agreement for reasons, or on grounds,\nother than those set forth in the contracts. Id. Hyatt informed\nGreat Cruz that it deemed its participation in the enterprise as\nthe clear equivalent of a cash equity investment, and Great Cruz\nassented to Hyatt's approach to, and view of, the transaction.\n         In order to protect the proprietary nature of its\nmanagement methods and to avoid confusion with respect to its\ntrademarks and trade names, Hyatt also insisted on the power to\nrestrict the owner's right to transfer the management agreement\nto successors or assigns. Thus, to secure the performance of\nduties owed to Hyatt, section 15.2 of the management agreement\ngave it the right and power to block the owner's assignment to\nany assignee \"`engaged in the management or operation . . . of a\nchain (that is, five [5] or more locations) of hotels or\nresorts.'\" Br. at 18. Further, Hyatt agreed to add the resort\nto its worldwide hotel chain and agreed to provide its\ncomprehensive and proprietary chain services to the resort. Many\nof the services that Hyatt thus committed to contribute involved\nconfidential, proprietary, and trade secret information.\n         The parties eventually reached an understanding and on\nMarch 9, 1990, Great Cruz, Skopbank, and Hyatt executed a series\nof agreements that allow Hyatt to manage and operate the hotel.\nThe documents included a management agreement signed by Hyatt and\nGreat Cruz giving Hyatt complete control over the operation of\nthe hotel for a term of 30 years, essentially limiting the\nowner's right to terminate the agreement to poor performance by\nHyatt. (Management Agreement at ยงยง 2, 4.5; app. 1809, 1836). In\nreturn for managing the hotel, Hyatt would receive a base fee of\n1.5 percent of gross revenue, as well as an incentive fee\nstructured on positive cash flow. Id. at 1829. A letter\nagreement signed by Great Cruz and Hyatt directed Hyatt to pay\nSkopbank any sums due to Great Cruz under the management\nagreement. Id. at 113.\n         Hyatt sets forth in its brief that in order \"to secure\nits property interests and investments in the business it was to\ncreate as well as to secure the performance of certain duties\nowed to [it],\" br. at 21-22, Great Cruz warranted and guaranteed\nHyatt's continuous right to manage the resort for the duration of\nthe term of the management agreement. Specifically, Hyatt notes\nthat section 7.5 of the agreement provides that \"this Agreement\nshall not be subject to forfeiture or termination except in\naccordance with the provisions hereof,\" id. at 22; see app. at\n1795, and that \"Hyatt shall be entitled to operate the Hotel for\nthe Term, and Owner shall, at no expense to Hyatt, undertake and\nprosecute all appropriate actions, judicial or otherwise,\nrequired to assure such right of operation to Hyatt.\" Br. at 22;\nsee app. at 1860-61.\n         In addition, a subordination, non-disturbance, and\nattornment agreement set forth the rights of the parties should\nSkopbank foreclose its mortgage to Great Cruz. This agreement\n\fincluded a warrant by Skopbank that the management agreement\nwould remain undisturbed by any foreclosure or default and would\ncontinue in full force and effect as long as Hyatt was not in\ndefault.   (Subordination Agreement at ยงยง 2, 3; app. at 548).\n         In 1991, Skopbank filed a foreclosure action in the\nDistrict Court of the Virgin Islands (Civ. No. 91-355) as a\nresult of Great Cruz's default on the mortgages. In 1992, during\nthe pendency of the foreclosure suit, the Government Guarantee\nFund of the Republic of Finland (\"GGF\") obtained a controlling\ninterest in Skopbank as part of the Finnish government's bailout\nof the bank.\n         On February 21, 1995, the district court entered a\nconsent judgment and put the hotel up for judicial sale. On\nMarch 20, 1995, 35 Acres Associates, a Virgin Islands general\npartnership consisting of two Finnish corporations, purchased the\nhotel. On March 21, 1995, counsel for 35 Acres wrote to Hyatt,\nstating that \"GGF, Skopbank and 35 Acres Associates consider the\nManagement Agreement between Hyatt Corporation ('Hyatt') and\nGreat Cruz Bay Development Company, Inc. as void, terminated\nand/or expired.\" Br. at 23; app. at 1401-02. On June 8, 1995,\n35 Acres wrote again, advising Hyatt that it was in wrongful\npossession, and demanding that it surrender possession of the\nhotel:\n              The Hotel belongs to 35 Acres, not\n         Hyatt. Hyatt is trespassing on the property.\n         35 Acres again demands that Hyatt immediately\n         surrender possession of the Hotel and all\n         associated real and personal property and\n         accounts and cooperate in an orderly transfer\n         to 35 Acres. We will have a transition team\n         available on short notice.\nApp. at 1407. Hyatt, however, did not surrender possession of\nthe hotel.\n                     B. Procedural History\n         GGF and Skopbank filed suit against Hyatt (Civil No.\n1995-49) on March 16, 1995, seeking a declaratory judgment\nfinding Hyatt in breach of the management agreements and alleging\nvarious claims in tort and contract. GGF and Skopbank, of\ncourse, sought, inter alia, a judgment declaring the management\nagreement terminated and thus giving it possession of the hotel.\nOn November 8, 1995, GGF and Skopbank filed an amended complaint\nadding additional entities as plaintiffs, including 35 Acres. On\nApril 25, 1995, Hyatt sued 35 Acres (Civil No. 1995-68), and\nthereafter filed two amended complaints. The second amended\ncomplaint, dated June 21, 1995, sought a judgment declaring the\nrights of the various parties under the management agreements,\nrecovery for civil conspiracy, and punitive, compensatory, and\nconsequential damages. On June 21, 1995, the district court\nconsolidated the two cases for trial.\n         At a hearing on November 17, 1995, the court took under\nadvisement 35 Acres' motion to dismiss the second amended\ncomplaint in the Hyatt suit (Civil No. 1995-68) and denied\nwithout prejudice Hyatt's motion to strike and dismiss the GGF\nparties' first amended complaint in the GGF suit (Civil No.\n\f1995-49).

Hyatt Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">166</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">321</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 323 (D.V.I. 1996). Hyatt renewed its motion to\nstrike and dismiss on December 22, 1995.\n         On January 8, 1996, the district court granted 35\nAcres' motion to dismiss the second amended complaint in the\nHyatt suit. See Government Guarantee Fund v. Hyatt Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1996</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">165008</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *6 (D.V.I. Jan. 8, 1996). On January 3, 1996, 35\nAcres moved for partial summary judgment against Hyatt in the GGF\nsuit, arguing that it was entitled to possession of the hotel as\na matter of law. On January 23, 1996, Hyatt moved to amend the\ncourt's order of January 8, 1996, to permit the filing of a third\namended complaint in its suit.\n         On March 6, 1996, the district court held a hearing on\nthe consolidated cases. Ruling from the bench, the court granted\n35 Acres' motion for partial summary judgment, in effect granting\nit possession of the hotel. The court directed the parties to\nwork together on transferring management of the hotel. App. at\n2157. The court denied without prejudice Hyatt's motion to\ndismiss the first amended complaint in the GGF suit (Civil No.\n1995-49). In the Hyatt suit (Civil No. 1995-68) the court denied\nHyatt's motion to amend the court's order of January 8, 1996, and\nits motion to be permitted to file a third amended complaint.\nThe court issued a written order implementing its March 6, 1996\nrulings on April 10, 1996. The order stated that \"[b]oth parties\nshall work together to effect a smooth transition in the\nmanagement and operation of the Hotel,\" app. at 2199, and allowed\nHyatt 10 days from the entry of the order to answer the first\namended complaint in the GGF suit (Civil No. 1995-49) and assert\nany defenses and compulsory counterclaims thereto. Id. at 2199-\n2200. The court further ordered the Hyatt case (Civil No. 1995-\n68) closed and that all other pleadings filed thereafter should\ncontain only the caption of the GGF suit (Civil No. 1995-49).\nId. at 2200.\n         The court issued an opinion and order on April 10,\n1996, explaining its rulings from the bench on March 6, 1996.\nSee Government Guarantee Fund v. Hyatt Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">166</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">321</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. In\nthe opinion the district court noted first that \"35 Acres seeks a\ndetermination that its agency relationship with Hyatt has been\nterminated as a matter of law, and Hyatt must leave the\npremises,\" id., at 326, and then concluded that:\n              Applying the controlling law to the\n         undisputed facts of this case establishes\n         that the Management Agreement created a\n         revocable agency that ended once 35 Acres\n         gave notice of its termination. As\n         terminated agent, Hyatt must leave the\n         premises and surrender control of the Hotel\n         to 35 Acres, its rightful owner.\nId., at 327. Hyatt's challenge to this conclusion is at the\nheart of its appeal.\n         On April 12, 1996, 35 Acres filed a motion for entry of\nan order seeking the transition of management provided for in the\ndistrict court's grant of partial summary judgment. On May 3,\n1996, the district court entered such an order and certified the\n\forder of April 10, 1996, and the order of May 3, 1996,\neffectuating the order of April 10, 1996, as final judgments\npursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b). On May 6, 1996, Hyatt filed a\nnotice of appeal from the district court's May 3, 1996 Rule 54(b)\norder which included an appeal from the April 10, 1996 order.\nHyatt also filed an emergency motion in the district court to\nstay enforcement of the judgment without bond or, in the\nalternative, for a hearing to set the amount of the supersedeas\nbond pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 62.\n         Following oral argument on May 9, 1996, the district\ncourt denied Hyatt's emergency motion for a stay. See Government\nGuarantee Fund v.

The court thereafter entered a written order denying\nthe motion and providing that Hyatt must comply with the order of\nMay 3, 1996, by May 14, 1996.\n         On May 13, 1996, Hyatt filed an emergency motion in\nthis court to stay enforcement of the district court's judgment\npending appeal. A single judge of this court granted the motion\non a temporary basis until a panel could consider the matter. On\nMay 20, 1996, we granted Hyatt's motion to stay enforcement of\nthe judgment pending appeal and accelerated the parties' briefing\nschedule. We also directed that following completion of the\nbriefing the case be listed before the earliest available panel.\nFinally, we remanded the case to the district court to fix the\namount of the supersedeas bond pursuant to Fed. R. App. P. 8(a),\nwhile retaining jurisdiction over the appeal.\n         On May 29, 1996, the district court held a hearing on\nthe remand and required Hyatt to post two bonds, one in the\namount of $2 million (to be posted by June 4, 1996), and the\nother in the amount of $11 million (to be posted by July 30,\n1996), for a total bond obligation of $13 million. The district\ncourt also held that this court's stay \"should not allow Hyatt to\nreopen the Hotel over the objections of 35 Acres Associates.\"\n         On June 3, 1996, Hyatt filed a motion in this court to\nset aside or modify the district court's order setting the amount\nof the supersedeas bonds. On July 3, 1996, we granted Hyatt's\nmotion, but only \"to the extent\" that we vacated \"so much of the\norder of May 31, 1996, which precluded Hyatt from reopening the\nhotel over the objection of 35 Acres Associates.\" We denied the\nmotion to modify the order with respect to the bonds. We\nunderstand that Hyatt has posted the bonds. We, however, are\nuncertain as to whether the hotel is open.\n         The parties agree that this appeal focuses only on 35\nAcres' power to terminate the agency and its right to possession\nof the hotel and related property, as well as transition matters,\nirrespective of the ultimate result of the remaining litigation.\nThus, we do not consider whether 35 Acres wrongfully terminated\nHyatt's management rights. We now address the merits of Hyatt's\nappeal.\n\n                        III. DISCUSSION\n                      A. Burdens of Proof\n         We dispose of Hyatt's first argument summarily. Hyatt\nargues that 35 Acres had the burden of proving the revocability\n\fof Hyatt's agency as a matter of law in the district court, as\nwell as the burden of proving that Hyatt did not have the right\nto occupy or possess the resort. Hyatt asserts that the only\nevidence 35 Acres offered with respect to these two issues\nconsisted of the following four allegations:\n         (1) 35 Acres is the owner of a hotel known as\n         the Virgin Grand Hotel on the island of St.\n         John, U.S. Virgin Islands; (2) Hyatt\n         Corporation purports to claim a right to act\n         as the managing agent of 35 Acres pursuant to\n         a Management Agreement dated March 9, 1990,\n         between Hyatt and Great Cruz Bay Development\n         Company, Inc.; (3) Skopbank, GGF, and 35\n         Acres sent a letter to Hyatt dated March 21,\n         1995, in which they stated that they\n         `consider' the Management Agreement `as void,\n         terminated and/or expired'; and (4) Hyatt\n         refuses to vacate the premises.\nBr. at 28-29 (some internal quotations omitted).\n         Hyatt argues that 35 Acres' motion for partial summary\njudgment thus attempted to \"off-load its burden of proof upon\nHyatt.\" Br. at 29. Hyatt asserts that 35 Acres failed to meet\nits burden of proving as a matter of law the following necessary\nelements of its claim for relief: (1) the revocability of Hyatt's\nagency; (2) the valid termination of that agency; and (3) the\nabsence of any right of Hyatt to manage or occupy the resort.\n         We decline to treat this case as involving merely the\nburdens placed upon parties seeking summary judgment, and\ntherefore will address fully the merits of the appeal considering\nthe facts presented on the motion for partial summary judgment in\nthe district court. After all, the parties submitted extensive\nmaterials in the district court and we see no reason why we\nshould not consider the record as developed.\n\n                       B. Prima Facie Case\n         Hyatt's second argument, that 35 Acres failed to\nestablish a prima facie entitlement to relief, likewise lacks\nsubstance. Hyatt first notes that in ruling upon 35 Acres'\nmotion for partial summary judgment, the district court applied\nVirgin Islands law, which provides that the \"rules of the common\nlaw, as expressed in the restatements of the law . . . shall be\nthe rules of decision in the courts of the Virgin Islands . . .\nin the absence of local laws to the contrary.\" V.I. Code Ann.\ntit. 1, ยง 4 (1967). Thus, the district court held that, \"The\nRestatement (Second) of Agency (1958) is the governing law in\nthis area.\" Government Guarantee Fund v. Hyatt Corp., 166 F.R.D.\nat 327.\n         Hyatt points out that the Restatement recognizes that\nthere are two separate and distinct types of agencies:\n         The first type, often called `revocable'\n         agencies, may be revoked by the principal at\n         any time and for any reason. See Restatement\n         (Second) of Agency, ยง 118 and Comment b. The\n         second type, often called `irrevocable'\n\f         agencies, agency powers `given as security,'\n         or agencies `coupled with an interest,' may\n         not be terminated at the whim of the\n         principal, but may be terminated only `in\n         accordance with the agreement by which the\n         power was created.' See Restatement (Second)\n         of Agency, ยง 139 and Comment a.\nBr. at 31. Hyatt therefore argues that mere proof of the\nexistence of a power in the form of an agency does not establish\nthe absolute and unqualified right of the grantor to terminate\nthe power. Consequently mere evidence that there is an agency\nneither establishes the revocability of that agency nor disproves\nits irrevocability. Id. Hyatt thus claims that there was a\n\"fundamental flaw in 35 Acres' motion for partial summary\njudgment\" in the district court. Id. at 32.\n         Further, Hyatt asserts that 35 Acres did not negate\nconclusively the continued existence of a principal-agent\nrelationship with Hyatt. Hyatt argues that a claim that an\nagency is irrevocable or is coupled with an interest is not an\naffirmative defense in an action to terminate an agency. Thus,\nit contends that 35 Acres did not fulfill its burden on its\nmotion for summary judgment seeking to terminate the agency\nmerely by proving the existence of the agency. Hyatt asserts\nthat 35 Acres was required to demonstrate that Hyatt's agency was\nrevocable, and thereby preclude the possibility that Hyatt's\nagency was irrevocable.\n         Along the same lines, Hyatt argues that 35 Acres failed\nto demonstrate as a matter of law that it terminated Hyatt's\nagency, as Hyatt claims that the letter of March 21, 1995 \"does\nnot clearly purport to constitute an act of revocation or\ntermination, but suggests that the termination had already\noccurred and that the letter was merely memorializing that\nalleged historic fact.\" Br. at 33. Hyatt claims that the proof\nof 35 Acres' alleged termination of Hyatt's agency is, at best,\nambiguous and inconclusive, and that courts frequently hold that\nthe intent and effect of purported termination notices raise\ngenuine issues of material fact precluding summary judgment.\nFinally, Hyatt attacks the prima facie case presented by 35 Acres\nas devoid of conclusive proof of a present right in 35 Acres to\nexclusive possession of the resort.\n         We find this line of argument meritless, and are\nsatisfied that 35 Acres met its burden in its motion for partial\nsummary judgment of presenting a prima facie case that it was\nentitled to possession of the hotel as a matter of law.

Zenith Radio Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111620\"><a href=\"/opinion/111620/matsushita-electric-industrial-co-ltd-v-zenith-radio-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">574</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n585, n.10, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111620\"><a href=\"/opinion/111620/matsushita-electric-industrial-co-ltd-v-zenith-radio-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

On the motion 35\nAcres presented the management agreement which on its face merely\ncreated an agency. We see no reason for 35 Acres to have proven\nat that point in the litigation that the agency itself was not\nirrevocable. As to Hyatt's claim that the March 21, 1995 letter\n\"[did] not clearly purport to constitute an act of revocation or\ntermination,\" the district court noted in its January 8, 1996\nmemorandum that:\n         Hyatt concedes that 35 Acres sent it letters\n\f         that 35 Acres 'considered Hyatt's management\n         agreement \"void, terminated and/or expired\"'\n         and demanding Hyatt `immediately surrender\n         possession' of the Hotel. (Second Amended\n         Complaint at 2.) Indisputably, such letters\n         manifested 35 Acres' dissent to the\n         continuance of the agency relationship with\n         Hyatt -- all that is required for an agency\n         to be terminated under the Restatement.\n         Restatement (Second) of Agency, ยง 118.\nGovernment Guarantee Fund v. Hyatt Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">165008</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at *3.\nSurely, Hyatt cannot argue reasonably that it did not realize the\nMarch 21, 1995 letter constituted notice of termination, when it\nhas referred to the letter as such in its own pleadings.\nFurthermore, on June 9, 1995, Hyatt filed an amended complaint\nreferring to 35 Acres' June 8, 1995 letter to Hyatt that we\nquoted in part above which set forth continued written demands\nthat Hyatt quit the property, provide an accounting, and cease\nacting as agent for 35 Acres because its agency had been\nterminated. App. at 1170, 1180, 1034. In addition, on June 21,\n1995, Hyatt filed a Second Amended Complaint that referenced a\nJune 19, 1996 letter (app. at 1186, 1195) demanding that Hyatt\ncease acting as agent for 35 Acres. App. at 1043.\n         Finally, Hyatt's argument that the prima facie case\npresented by 35 Acres was devoid of conclusive proof of 35 Acres'\npresent right to exclusive possession of the resort is also\nmeritless. Hyatt has admitted that 35 Acres owns the hotel.\nApp. at 390. This argument deserves no further comment. We\nproceed now to Hyatt's more substantial arguments.\n                   C. The Agency Relationship\n         Hyatt's main argument is that the district court erred\nin granting judgment in favor of 35 Acres because Hyatt raised\ngenuine issues of material fact precluding summary judgment.\nFirst we will discuss the law applicable to the termination of\nagency agreements, and then we will consider Hyatt's specific\narguments.\n                      1. The Applicable Law\n         As the district court correctly noted, agency\nprinciples as expressed in the Restatements govern this case.\nSection 118 of the Restatement (Second) of Agency (1958) states\nthat an agent's \"[a]uthority terminates if the principal or the\nagent manifests to the other dissent to its continuance.\"\nComment (b) explains:\n         The principal has power to revoke . . .\n         although doing so is in violation of a\n         contract between the parties and although the\n         authority is expressed to be irrevocable. A\n         statement in a contract that the authority\n         cannot be terminated by either party is\n         effective only to create liability for its\n         wrongful termination.\n         The only exception to the rule that principals may\nterminate an agency relationship at any time is when the\nauthority granted to the agent is a \"power given as security.\"\n\fId. ยงยง 138, 139. Section 138 of the Restatement states:\n         A power given as security is a power to\n         affect the legal relations of another,\n         created in the form of an agency authority,\n         but held for the benefit of the power holder\n         or a third person and given to secure the\n         performance of a duty or to protect a title,\n         either legal or equitable, such power being\n         given when the duty or title is created or\n         given for consideration.\n         Comment (b) to section 138 of the Restatement explains\nthat \"[a] power given as security is one held for the benefit of\na person other than the power giver [i.e. principal].\" A\nprincipal can terminate an agency power given as security \"only\nin accordance with the agreement by which the power was created.\"\nId. ยง 139 cmt. a. On the other hand, the power giver can revoke\nthe power if it was created only for the benefit of the power\ngiver, i.e., when there is a simple agency relationship. If the\nagent has an interest in the exercise of the power only because\nof the compensation to which it is entitled upon its exercise,\nthen the power is not given as security and is revocable.\n         A principal may grant an irrevocable agency power for\nthe purpose either of furnishing a security to protect a debt or\nother duty, or facilitating the performance, effectuating the\nobjects, or securing the benefits of a contract. See id. ยง 138\ncmt. c. For example, a power given as security arises when a\nperson manifests consent that the one to whom it is given\nproperly can act to protect a title already in the power holder.\nId. cmt. a. Moreover, if an agent has an interest in the subject\nmatter of the agency, as where it engages in a joint enterprise\nor invests in a business in which another supplies the subject\nmatter, a power given it by the other to protect such interest is\na power given as a security. See id. cmt. b.; see also Bowling\nv. National Convoy & Trucking Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3383745\"><a href=\"/opinion/3391427/bowling-v-national-convoy-trucking-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So.</span> <span class=\"page\">541</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 543-44 (Fla.\n1931); Haft v.

Ch. 1995). In\nany of these circumstances, a power given as a security cannot be\nterminated at the whim of the power giver. See Restatement\n(Second) of Agency ยง 14H cmt. a.\n         The Restatement provides illustrations of a power given\nto protect the property interest of the power holder (i.e., the\nagent) in the subject matter of the agency, as well as a power\ngiven to secure a duty or obligation owed to the agent. While\nthe illustrations focus on the protected interest as held by the\nagent or power holder, it is clear that the agency is also\nirrevocable if made for the benefit of a third person, although\nthe agency can be terminated with the consent of the third-party\nbeneficiary. Moreover, agency powers granted both for the\nbenefit of the principal and the agent are irrevocable. SeeRestatement\n(Second) of Agency ยง 138 cmt. d (\"A person authorized\nto act as agent may also hold a power for his own benefit.\").\n         An indispensable feature of a power given as security\nis that the agent have a proprietary interest in the res or\nsubject matter of the agency independent of the agency\nrelationship itself. As the district court noted, Professor\n\fWilliston's comments on this subject are instructive:\n              In order that a power may be irrevocable\n         because it is coupled with an interest, it is\n         necessary that the interest be in the subject\n         matter of the power and not in the proceeds\n         which will arise from the exercise of the\n         power . . . .\n\n         . . . [T]he person clothed with the authority\n         must derive a present or future interest in\n         the subject itself on which the power is to\n         be exercised . . . . In short, the test is:\n\n              Does the agent have an interest or\n         estate in the subject matter of the agency\n         independent of the power conferred, or does\n         the interest or estate accrue by or after the\n         exercise of the power conferred?\n\n              If the former, it is an agency coupled\n         with an interest . . . if the latter, it is\n         not.\nGovernment Guarantee Fund v. Hyatt Corp., 166 F.R.D. at 327-28,\n(quoting 2 Samuel Williston, A Treatise on the Law of Contracts ยง\n280, at 300-02 (3d ed. 1959)). Thus, in the words of the\ndistrict court, \"the agency relationship itself does not create\nthe interest; the agency merely serves to protect the separately\ngranted or created interest when the two are coupled.\" Id. at\n328.\n               2. The District Court's Disposition\n         In its memorandum of January 8, 1996, granting 35\nAcres' motion to dismiss Hyatt's complaint in Civil No. 1995-68,\nthe district court indicated that, \"[f]or Hyatt to claim that its\nagency authority is . . . a power given as security, it must have\nalleged that the agreements were entered into for [its] benefit .\n. . either to protect a property interest of Hyatt's in the hotel\nor to secure the performance of some duty or obligation owed to\nHyatt.\" Government Guarantee Fund v. Hyatt Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">165008</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *3. Because Hyatt failed to allege such an interest,\nthe district court dismissed count one of Hyatt's second amended\ncomplaint at that time. Id. The court thereafter held that any\nagency under the management agreement was revocable and had been\nterminated. Id.\n         In its January 8, 1996 memorandum the district court\nfirst noted that Hyatt's own pleadings established that 35 Acres\nhad terminated the agency:\n         Hyatt concedes that 35 Acres sent it letters\n         that 35 Acres 'considered Hyatt's management\n         agreement \"void, terminated and/or expired\"'\n         and demanding Hyatt `immediately surrender\n         possession' of the Hotel. (Second Amended\n         Complaint at 2.) Indisputably, such letters\n         manifested 35 Acres' dissent to the\n         continuance of the agency relationship with\n\f            Hyatt -- all that is required for an agency\n            to be terminated under the Restatement.\n            Restatement (Second) of Agency, ยง 118.\nId..     The court held that Hyatt could not continue to manage the\nhotel:\n           Thus, assuming all the facts alleged in the\n           complaint are true, the relationship between\n           Hyatt and 35 Acres is a simple agency; and\n           Hyatt has not demonstrated any legal basis\n           for a declaration that the agency has not\n           been terminated or that Hyatt may continue as\n           manager of the hotel.\nId..\n         The district court noted that it had considered Hyatt's\ncontentions that the management agreement created an irrevocable\nagency coupled with an interest: \"Hyatt wants to argue that the\nmanagement agreements constitute an agency coupled with an\ninterest which cannot be summarily revoked.\" Id. The court\nheld, however, that Hyatt failed to present any basis for such a\nconclusion:\n         In its second amended complaint, Hyatt has\n         alleged no property interest in the hotel;\n         nor has Hyatt alleged that the authority was\n         granted to secure the performance of any duty\n         owed to it. Hyatt's only asserted interest\n         is in the compensation due it as manager of\n         the hotel, the benefit to its reputation, and\n         an enhanced presence in the Caribbean. Such\n         interests are ordinary incidents of an agency\n         relationship and standing alone do not\n         support an inference that the agreements were\n         entered into for the benefit of Hyatt as\n         opposed to the benefit of the owner. In sum,\n         Hyatt simply does not allege any interest in\n         the hotel aside from its interest in reaping\n         the benefits from acting as 35 Acres' agent.\nId.\n         Moreover, the district court noted that the management\nagreement did not even recite that it created an agency coupled\nwith an interest. Id. at *3 n.7. The court concluded that:\n\"Whether or not Hyatt breached the agreements does not change the\nreality that under the facts alleged by Hyatt, the agency\nrelationship has terminated and Hyatt cannot continue acting as\nmanager of the Hotel.\" Id. at *4.\n         Later, at the hearing on March 6, 1996, the district\ncourt addressed 35 Acres' motion for partial summary judgment,\nthe grant of which led to this appeal. At the conclusion of that\nhearing the court stated as follows:\n         I do not see any basis for changing the\n         Court's previous ruling. I haven't heard\n         anything and I don't, haven't seen anything\n         in Hyatt's proposed amended complaint that\n         when it's read together with the management\n         agreement and the other facts that are\n\f         undisputed in this case -- and those are\n         basically as 35 Acres has stated, that they\n         own the property, that Hyatt has no title\n         ownership, no right of possession as a result\n         of any ownership. It is an agent of 35 Acres\n         only. The management agreement was the only\n         instrument which gives them the right to be\n         there and I don't see any reason to go\n         outside the four corners of the management\n         agreement. It's whatever the negotiations,\n         whatever the intentions were, whatever the\n         desires were, whoever came up first to me is\n         not, does not help to explain anything in the\n         management agreement.\n\n         . . . .\n\n         So, I will, say, reduce that to a written\n         order as soon as possible. I would suggest\n         that counsel get together and you work out\n         whatever is necessary to be able to have\n         Hyatt leave the premises in terms of any\n         items that Mr. Cole mentioned, so that order\n         won't be imposed on Hyatt; it will simply be\n         an agreed-upon to the extent they can agree\n         upon it and maybe if you can get together\n         with Judge Barnard. And if you can't resolve\n         it, I'll resolve it.\n\n         . . . And it should be done within good --\n         from Hyatt. If you don't want to do that,\n         then you will have to do it the hard way.\n         But I certainly think it would be in your\n         interest to do it cooperatively. So, that is\n         the Court's ruling.\nApp. at 2155-57.\n         In its April 10, 1996 opinion the district court issued\na written confirmation of its March 6, 1996 rulings. The court\nreferenced decisions that have held as a matter of law that chain\nhotel management contracts create a typical revocable agency, not\nan irrevocable agency coupled with an interest.

Further, the\ncourt addressed Hyatt's argument that the management agreement\ncreated some sort of \"joint enterprise\" between itself and the\nprior owner of the hotel:\n         Hyatt's claim of some sort of joint\n         ventureship or enterprise is foreclosed by\n         the unambiguous language of that document.\n         Section 3.8 of the Management Agreement\n         provides:\n\f              Nothing in this Agreement contained\n              shall constitute, or be construed\n              to create, a partnership, joint\n              venture or lease between Owner and\n              Hyatt with respect to the Hotel.\n166 F.R.D. at 328.\n         The court noted that the management agreement could not\nbe construed as creating a new business entity because, even if\nHyatt's management fee was construed as a share of the profits,\nHyatt never undertook to share in the losses of any such\nenterprise: \"In fact, the Management Agreement was structured so\nthat Hyatt would receive a management fee even when the Hotel\nsuffered a loss.\" Id.\n         The court also considered Hyatt's argument that the\nmanagement agreement created a power given as security to protect\nits intellectual property, which was to be used by Hyatt in\ncarrying out its duties on behalf of the owner. The court held\nthat Hyatt's contentions regarding protecting its reputation and\nits trade name did not warrant a result any different from that\nin prior cases concerning chain hotel management contracts that\ncreated revocable agencies. Id. at 329 & n.21 (citing Pacific\nLandmark Hotel, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2270367\"><a href=\"/opinion/2270367/pacific-landmark-hotel-ltd-v-marriott-hotels-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Thus, the court held that:\n              The plain language of the Management\n         Agreement shows, and the undisputed facts of\n         this case definitively establish, that the\n         agency was created for the benefit of the\n         owner, not Hyatt, and that Hyatt's sole\n         interest in the Management Agreement is its\n         right to compensation. As such, the\n         Management Agreement was a personal services\n         contract which cannot be specifically\n         enforced. Restatement of the Law (Second)\n         Contracts, ยง 367(1) (1981).\n166 F.R.D. at 329.\n         In explaining why it would be inappropriate to order\nspecific performance of the management agreement, the district\ncourt found the rationale stated in Woolley v. Embassy Suitesconvincing:\n              There are a variety of reasons why\n         courts are loathe to order specific\n         performance of personal services contracts.\n         Such an order would impose upon the court the\n         prodigious if not impossible task of passing\n         judgment on the quality of performance. It\n         would also run contrary to the Thirteenth\n         Amendment's prohibition against involuntary\n         servitude. Courts wish to avoid the friction\n         and social costs which result when the\n         parties are reunited in a relationship that\n         has already failed, especially where the\n         services involve mutual confidence and the\n         exercise of discretionary authority.\n         Finally, it is impractical to require\n         judicial oversight of a contract which calls\n\f         for special knowledge, skill, or ability.\nId. at 329-30 (quoting Woolley v. Embassy Suites, 278 Cal. Rptr.\nat 727).\n                 3. Hyatt's Arguments on Appeal\n         For the most part, Hyatt's arguments on appeal are the\nsame as those it made in the district court. As we agree both\nwith that court's decision and its reasoning, we only need\ndiscuss the specifics of arguments not addressed by the district\ncourt.\n         Hyatt argues that it presented competent evidence to\nthe district court that demonstrated the irrevocability of its\nagency agreement with Great Cruz. Specifically, Hyatt asserts\nthat its agency \"exceeds the mere management of physical property\nand extends to the operation of a comprehensive and complex\nbusiness\" that is reflected in the scope of its rights under the\nmanagement agreement. Br. at 36. Thus, the subject matter of\nHyatt's agency is \"not limited to the real and personal property\nof the Resort, but includes the operation of the business of the\nResort.\" Id. at 37.\n         Hyatt relies on decisions of courts that have held that\nan irrevocable agency is created where \"an agent makes a\nsubstantial contribution to or capital investment in a business\nenterprise while assuming significant managerial responsibilities\nover that business.\" Br. at 38 (citing Bowling v. National\nConvoy & Trucking Co., 135 So. at 543; Haft v. Haft, 671 A.2d at\n423); Montgomery v.

Hyatt claims that it submitted overwhelming evidence in\nthe district court of its agreement with Great Cruz to use the\nreal property and improvements thereon to create a new business\nenterprise, the \"Hyatt Regency St. John.\" Hyatt claims that it\nwas the catalyst in establishing that business, and that:\n         Its capital contributions and investments to\n         the business included lending the use of its\n         registered trademarks and service marks;\n         providing proprietary and confidential\n         information, programs, and systems with\n         respect to sales, marketing, and operations;\n         and making the resort an integral member of\n         the `Hyatt' worldwide chain of hotels and\n         resorts.\nBr. at 38. Hyatt also claims that \"to protect and secure its\neconomic interests in the new business, Hyatt assumed control of\nthe management of that business as well as the day-to-day\noperations, and thereby was invested with certain powers of\nagency.\" Id. at 39. According to Hyatt, those powers were\ngranted for its benefit and, thus, are irrevocable.\n         Like the district court, we decline to accept Hyatt's\ntheory that it has \"proven the creation of a resort business and\nits contributions to and investments in that business, its\nprofits interests therein, and its insistence upon and receipt of\nmanagerial powers to protect those contributions, investments,\nand interests,\" br. at 38 n.9, in the face of the clear language\n\fin the management agreement that:\n              Nothing in this Agreement contained\n         shall constitute, or be construed to be or to\n         create, a partnership, joint venture or lease\n         between Owner and Hyatt with respect to the\n         Hotel.\nManagement agreement, ยง 3.8; app. at 1828. Moreover, none of the\ncases Hyatt cites to support its argument are aligned factually\nwith this case. See, e.g., MacDonald v. Rosenfeld, 188 P.2d at\n528 (\"The evidence supports the view that defendant was granted\n`a power coupled with an interest' in that he was given the\nmanagement of the business as security for the loans he had\nmade.\"); Jones v. Williams, 39 S.W. at 493 (\"Under the contract,\nplaintiff purchased 1,667 shares of stock in the corporation, for\nwhich he paid $80,000; and, in consideration thereof, he was to\nhave the `control and management' of the Post Dispatch for five\nyears, at an annual salary of $10,000.\"); Bowling v. National\nConvoy & Trucking Co., 135 So. at 543 (affirming holding that\nagency was coupled with interest in business founded by agent);\nMontgomery v. Foreman, 410 So.2d at 1167 (\"Thus it was\ncontemplated that [the agent] would recoup the monies he spent in\nimproving the property[.]\"); Haft v. Haft, 671 A.2d at 423\n(irrevocable stock voting proxy given as security for note and\nother interests retained in corporation as well as security for\npayment of purchase price of transfer of stock at issue). Thus,\nwe reject as a matter of law Hyatt's argument that it possessed\nan irrevocable agency due to its part in the creation of a new\nbusiness enterprise. Hyatt has raised no genuine issue of\nmaterial fact that alters our conclusion.\n         Hyatt next argues that its contribution of its\ntrademarks and trade names, chain services, and management\nexpertise was and is \"an integral and valuable part of the\nbusiness known as the `Hyatt Regency St. John.'\" Br. at 41.\nHyatt claims that the combination of those contributions created\nand continue to add value to the goodwill of the business, and\nthat the goodwill in turn is a major factor in the ability and\ncapacity of the hotel to generate profits. Hyatt claims that to\nsecure and protect those investments, it negotiated and acquired\nrights to manage the business. Therefore, Hyatt asserts that the\nrelationship created by the agreements among the parties was an\nirrevocable agency which 35 Acres could not terminate except in\naccordance with the express termination provisions set forth in\nthe parties' agreements.\n         As a matter of law, we agree with the district court\nthat Hyatt's contribution of its trademarks and trade names,\nchain services, and management expertise to the hotel was merely\na normal incident of an agency relationship, and did not create\nan irrevocable agency. Again, Hyatt has raised no genuine issue\nof material fact to alter our conclusion.\n         Hyatt next attempts to distinguish the two decisions of\nthe California Court of Appeals on which the district court\nrelied in ruling that Hyatt's agency is revocable. First, Hyatt\nexplains that, in Woolley v. Embassy Suites, \"Embassy Suites had\na license agreement which was separate from and independent of\n\fits management agreement and, therefore, it could not\nsuccessfully argue that the managerial powers were given to it in\norder to protect and secure its intellectual property, which was\nthe subject of the separate license agreement.\" Br. at 42. SeeWoolley,\n278 Cal. Rptr. at 726 (\"Embassy says that this agency is\ndifferent because the hotels are franchised with the Embassy name\nand that it therefore has its own interest in their success. But\nthe franchise agreements are severable and independent from the\nmanagement contracts[.]\").\n         Next, Hyatt attempts to distinguish Pacific Landmark\nHotel by stating that in that case an irrevocable agency would\nhave existed had there been a legal identity between the Marriott\nentity that managed the hotel and the Marriott entity that held\nan interest in the hotel business. Since that was not the case,\nHyatt states that the legal separateness between the two was the\nsole factor in the court's refusal to find an irrevocable agency.\nBr. at 42; see Pacific Landmark Hotel, 23 Cal. Rptr. 2d at 563\n(\"[T]he trial court was disregarding the separate corporate\nentities . . . when it found MHI had an interest in the subject\nof the agency. . . . [T]he trial court erred in failing to treat\nMHI as separate from its parent corporation Marriott.\").\n         Hyatt argues that the facts in this case are materially\ndifferent from those in Woolley v. Embassy Suites and in Pacific\nLandmark Hotel. Hyatt asserts that it permitted its intellectual\nproperty (including its registered trademarks and trade names) to\nbe used in connection with the hotel only because it insisted\nupon and received agency powers to manage the resort. Moreover,\nthe entity that owns the \"Hyatt\" and \"Hyatt Regency\" trademarks\nand trade names and that holds an interest in the resort business\nknown as the \"Hyatt Regency St. John\" is the same entity that\nobtained for its benefit the right to manage the resort --\nnamely, Hyatt Corporation. Hyatt thus claims that the two\nCalifornia cases are distinguishable.\n         We do not agree with Hyatt's reading of the two\nCalifornia cases. While it is true that the specific facts of\nthe cases differ from the case before us, their legal holdings\nare instructive here. In Pacific Landmark Hotel even though a\nMarriott affiliate had invested loans of $15 million and $8\nmillion in capital contributions, pursuant to which the affiliate\nreceived a five percent ownership interest in the limited\npartnerships that owned the real estate and 95-99% of the tax\nbenefits of those partnerships, the court held as a matter of law\nthat the management agreements did not create an agency with an\ninterest in favor of Marriott Hotels, Inc., which was the\nmanager. 23 Cal. Rptr. 2d at 557, 560-63.\n         Moreover, even though Marriott's management contracts\nprovided for Marriott Hotels, Inc. to receive 30% of available\ncash flow for 60 years as part of its management fee and\npresumably Marriott, like Hyatt, contracted to use its trade name\nand trademarks in providing its management services, the court\nheld as a matter of law that the relationship was not an\nirrevocable agency. 23 Cal. Rptr. 2d at 557, 562-63. Given\nprovisions that unambiguously provided that the agreements were\nbetween principal and agent and did not create a lease,\n\fpartnership or joint venture, as a matter of law the agency could\nbe terminated. Id. at 560-63. The court held that the absence\nof a specific present property interest was dispositive.\n         In addition, the dispute in Woolley v. Embassy Suitesinvolved\ntermination of Embassy Suites' management of nine hotels\nthat were under management contract, not termination of a\nfranchise or license agreement. 278 Cal. Rptr. at 721 & n.1.\nLike Hyatt, Embassy Suites argued that the court should ignore\nthe express contractual provisions negating any partnership or\njoint venture, but the court found those provisions dispositive.\nId. at 724-26. Embassy Suites, like Hyatt, argued that the use\nof its trade name turned the management agreements into an agency\nwith an interest, and the court rejected those contentions for\nthe lack of any specific present property interest. Id. at 726.\nThe district court accurately analyzed the effect of the case:\n         Like Hyatt, the defendant in Woolley v.\n         Embassy Suites, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2142292\"><a href=\"/opinion/2142292/woolley-v-embassy-suites-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">278</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr.</span> <span class=\"page\">719</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n         (Cal. App. 1991), argued that its interest in\n         the success and prestige of its trade name\n         was sufficient to create an irrevocable\n         agency. The Court squarely rejected that\n         claim, noting that `the \"interest\" Embassy\n         has in seeing the hotels succeed so as to\n         enhance its reputation and prestige is not\n         the type of . . . interest necessary to\n         constitute an agency coupled with an\n         interest.' Id. at 726. Hyatt attempts to\n         distinguish Woolley by pointing to the fact\n         that the use of the Embassy Suites trade name\n         in that case was secured by a separate\n         franchise agreement. In our view, this fact\n         militates against the presence of an\n         irrevocable agency here. If the use of\n         Hyatt's intellectual property were protected\n         by a franchise agreement then the Owner\n         potentially could use Hyatt's trademarks and\n         trade names even after the agency ended.\n         Arguably, a separate clause linking the\n         franchise agreement to the agency\n         relationship might be needed to protect the\n         agent's interest. Here, termination of the\n         Management Agreement cancels the owner's\n         right to use Hyatt's intellectual property.\nGovernment Guarantee Fund v. Hyatt Corp., 166 F.R.D. at 329 n.21.\n         In short, we agree with the district court that the two\nCalifornia cases are instructive in this case and that, as a\nmatter of law, Hyatt's interest in protecting its trademarks and\nservice specialties is not sufficient to form an irrevocable\nagency. Hyatt has raised no genuine issue of material fact to\nalter our decision.\n         Hyatt next claims that it has raised genuine issues of\ndisputed fact with regard to the \"effectiveness of 35 Acres'\npurported termination letter of March 21, 1995.\" Br. at 43. As\nwe already have indicated the district court noted that:\n\f         Hyatt concedes that 35 Acres sent it letters\n         that 35 Acres `considered Hyatt's management\n         agreement \"void, terminated and/or expired\"'\n         and demanding Hyatt `immediately surrender\n         possession' of the Hotel. (Second Amended\n         Complaint at 2.) Indisputably, such letters\n         manifested 35 Acres' dissent to the\n         continuance of the agency relationship with\n         Hyatt -- all that is required for an agency\n         to be terminated under the Restatement.\n         Restatement (Second) of Agency, ยง 118.\nGovernment Guarantee Fund v. Hyatt Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">165008</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *3.\nWe find here no genuine issue of material fact to alter our\ndecision.\n         Hyatt finally claims that 35 Acres materially breached\nand wrongfully repudiated the management agreement by purporting\nto terminate Hyatt. \"The only proof in the summary judgment\nrecord showed that Hyatt complied fully with its obligations.\"\nBr. at 45. Hyatt claims that it therefore has submitted\ncompetent evidence supporting affirmative defenses. In light of\nour decision that Hyatt's agency was revocable, we find this\nargument meritless.\n         One final issue with respect to termination of Hyatt's\nmanagement agreement deserves our attention. It is true that a\nsubordination, non-disturbance, and attornment agreement set\nforth the rights of the parties should Skopbank foreclose its\nmortgage from Great Cruz, including a warrant by Skopbank that\nthe management agreement would remain undisturbed by any\nforeclosure or default and would continue in full force and\neffect as long as Hyatt was not in default.   (Subordination\nAgreement at ยงยง 2, 3; app. at 548). Hyatt's seeking of this\nsubordination agreement indicates impressive foresight on its\npart; indeed, the subordination agreement even could be construed\nto indicate intent among the parties that the management\nagreement itself be irrevocable.\n         However, as noted by the district court, \"management\nagreements between the owner of a hotel and a managing\ncorporation do not create an agency coupled with an interest,\neven if the agreements state that they do.\" Government Guarantee\nFund v. Hyatt Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">165008</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at *3 n.7 (citing Woolley v.\nEmbassy Suites, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2142292\"><a href=\"/opinion/2142292/woolley-v-embassy-suites-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">278</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Surely, if agreements that by their terms are\nirrevocable, thus manifesting the parties' intent that they be\nso, are not necessarily irrevocable, intent manifested by the\nseparate creation of a subordination agreement does not create a\npower coupled with an interest. Thus, while the subordination\nagreement may be very significant in a determination of whether\n35 Acres wrongfully terminated Hyatt's management agreement, it\ndoes not affect our result here. Whether or not an agency\nagreement is revocable is a matter of law. See Pacific Landmark\nHotel, 23 Cal. Rptr. 2d at 561 (\"[E]ven if the parties intended\nto create an irrevocable agency, one coupled with an interest,\nunless they do so and such an interest does in fact exist, the\nstatutory power to revoke may be exercised. If the exercise of\n\fthe statutory revocation power is contractually unjustified,\ndamages may be in order.\"); Woolley v. Embassy Suites, 278 Cal.\nRptr. at 725 (\"Even if the contract did attempt to restrict the\npower of the owner to terminate the manager, such provision would\nbe ineffective. The principal's power of revocation is absolute\nand applies even if doing so is a violation of the contract or\nthe agency is characterized as `irrevocable.'\") (citing\nRestatement (Second) of Agency ยง 118 cmt. b).\n         Accordingly, we will affirm the district court's grant\nof 35 Acres' motion for partial summary judgment, since Hyatt has\nraised no genuine issue of material fact and 35 Acres is entitled\nto judgment as a matter of law on the issue of the management\nagreement's revocability.\n            D. Remedies Granted by the District Court\n         Hyatt's next argument is that the district court erred\nin granting 35 Acres relief and imposing obligations on Hyatt\nthat neither were requested by 35 Acres nor supported in the\nsummary judgment record. We review issues regarding the relief\nfashioned by the district court for abuse of discretion only.\nSee United States v. Triple A Mach.

Br. at 45. Hyatt argues that 35\nAcres did not satisfy the burden imposed upon parties seeking\nmandatory injunctive relief, and that this portion of the\ndistrict court's judgment should be reversed.\n         Further, Hyatt notes that in paragraph 5 of the May 3,\n1996 order, the district court ordered that:\n         Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 70, 35 Acres\n         Associates shall be entitled to All Writs\n         which may be necessary to effectuate the\n         foregoing, whether by Ejectment, Abatement,\n         Assistance, Sequestration, Execution,\n         Garnishment, or otherwise, and the Clerk\n         shall issue the same, as necessary, without\n         further order of this Court.\nHyatt argues that Rule 70 does not authorize the plethora of\nextraordinary personal property remedies that the district court\ngranted to 35 Acres, and that we therefore should reverse this\nportion of the judgment.\n         Finally, Hyatt notes that paragraph 3(h) of the May\n3, 1996 order provides that \"Hyatt Corporation may not remove any\n\fpersonal property from the Hotel Property other than items of\npersonal property belonging to individual employees of Hyatt\nCorporation.\" Br. at 46 (citing app. at 2340). Noting that, in\nparagraph 4, the district court did permit Hyatt to segregate,\nseal, and/or designate its privileged documents, proprietary\ncommercial materials, and personal property located on the resort\npremises, but effectively prohibited Hyatt from removing its\nproperty except \"in accordance with further Order of this Court,\"\napp. at 2341-42, Hyatt argues that nothing in the summary\njudgment record justifies a court order interfering with or\ndepriving Hyatt of its rights of use, enjoyment, and possession\nof its own property. Hyatt therefore argues that this portion of\nthe district court's judgment should be reversed.\n         After a thorough review of the record, we see nothing\nin the relief fashioned by the district court that we could term\nan abuse of that court's discretion. Obviously the termination\nof Hyatt's presence in the hotel raised fairly complex practical\nproblems, and we will not fault the district court for\neffectuating the transition in a common sense way. Therefore, we\nwill affirm in its entirety the judgment of the district court.\n                       E. Attorney's Fees\n         Hyatt's final issue is a challenge to the district\ncourt's statement in the memorandum accompanying its May 3, 1996\norder, that, because of \"Hyatt's stubborn refusal to vacate the\npremises,\" Hyatt would \"bear any costs and attorney's fees\nincurred by 35 Acres related to its efforts in securing [the May\n3, 1996 order].\" Government Guarantee Fund v. Hyatt Corp., No.\n1995-49, slip op. at 3 (D.V.I. May 3, 1996). Hyatt argues that\nthe district court imposed these \"sanctions\" for the first time\nin its memorandum without any notice or hearing, implicating\nfundamental notions of due process. Moreover, Hyatt argues that\nbecause the district court did not identify the rule or statute\nunder which it imposed these \"sanctions,\" it is impossible for an\nappellate court to determine if the court applied the correct\nstandard. Accordingly, Hyatt argues that we should reverse the\ndistrict court's award of \"sanctions\" against Hyatt.\n         The law is clear that awards of costs and attorneys'\nfees are not appealable until the court determines their amount.\nSee, e.g., Apex Fountain Sales, Inc. v. Kleinfeld, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"672871\"><a href=\"/opinion/672871/apex-fountain-sales-inc-v-ernie-kleinfeld-flo-aire-inc-ralph-kearney/\"><span class=\"volume\">27</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">931</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n935 (3d Cir. 1994); Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. Flaherty, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"598981\"><a href=\"/opinion/598981/commonwealth-of-pennsylvania-and-guardians-of-greater-pittsburgh-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">983</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1267</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1276-77 (3d Cir. 1993). Consequently inasmuch as the\ndistrict court has not quantified the fees and costs there is no\norder with respect to them that is final for the purpose of\nappellate review. Therefore, Hyatt's challenge to the district\ncourt's statement in its memorandum regarding the bearing of\ncosts and attorneys' fees is premature. Accordingly, we will\ndismiss this part of the appeal for lack of appellate\njurisdiction.\n                        IV. CONCLUSION\n         For all the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the\ndistrict court's order of April 10, 1996, granting 35 Acres'\nmotion for partial summary judgment in its entirety and the order\nof May 3, 1996, providing for the transition of management and\nwill dismiss for lack of appellate jurisdiction the part of\n\fHyatt's appeal relating to attorneys' fees and costs. We vacate\nthe stay in our order of May 20, 1996. Finally, we will remand\nthe case to the district court for further proceedings on the\nremaing aspect of the case.\n\f</pre>",
