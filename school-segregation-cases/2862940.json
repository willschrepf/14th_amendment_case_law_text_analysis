HIGGINBOTHAM, Circuit Judge:\n      Seventeen-year-old Ryan Cole was severely injured in an armed\nencounter with police. Ryan and his parents, Karen and Randy Cole (“the\nColes”), brought suit against Officers Michael Hunter and Martin Cassidy,\nalleging that they violated Ryan’s Fourth Amendment right not to be\nsubjected to excessive force. They also sued Officer Carl Carson, alleging\nCarson violated Ryan’s rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments\nby lying and concealing evidence in order to protect Hunter and Cassidy; that\nhe caused Ryan to be wrongfully charged with aggravated assault of a public\nservant. The district court denied Carson’s motion to dismiss and Hunter and\nCassidy’s motion for summary judgment, rejecting the officers’ immunity\ndefense at the motion stage of the case.\n       We dismiss defendants’ appeal of the district court’s order refusing to\ngrant summary judgment on the excessive force claim, and we affirm the\ndistrict court’s refusal to dismiss the due process claim relating to fabrication\nof evidence. However, we conclude that the district court erred in allowing all\nother claims to proceed.\n                                            I\n       Seventeen-year-old Ryan Cole was a junior at Sachse High School. 1\nRyan suffered from obsessive-compulsive disorder. The night before the\nshooting, he quarreled with his parents, and later took guns and ammunition\nfrom their gun safe. He visited his friend Eric Reed Jr. late that night\n\n\n\n      1 One of the cases before us comes from a denial of summary judgment, and one from\na denial of a motion to dismiss. They involve distinct standards of review and universes of\nrelevant facts. For purposes of this summary, we describe the facts in broad strokes,\nturning to their detail as we address specific issues.\n                                            2\n\f    Case: 14-10228    Document: 00513212484    Page: 3   Date Filed: 09/29/2015\n\n\n\n                       No. 14-10228 c/w No. 15-10045\n\n\ncarrying weapons. The next morning, October 25, 2010, Ryan visited Eric\nagain carrying two handguns: a revolver and a Springfield 9mm semi-\nautomatic. At around 10:45 in the morning Ryan allowed Eric to take the\nrevolver, and used Eric’s cellphone to ask his grandparents to pick him up at\na nearby CVS.\n      During the course of the morning, police were informed that Ryan was\ncarrying at least one gun and acting aggressively, and they began looking for\nhim. After Ryan left Eric’s house with his remaining handgun, he was seen\nby several officers and ordered to stop. He continued to walk away from the\nofficers and placed the gun against his own head. He walked towards a set of\ntrain tracks separated by a narrow wooded area and grassy strip from\nHighway 78, a major road. The CVS where he was to meet his grandparents\nwas located on the other side of the wooded area, across Highway 78.\n      Three police officers—Hunter, Cassidy, and Carson—were attempting\nto locate Ryan on the other side of the wooded area, near Highway 78 and the\nCVS. Ryan crossed the wooded area and backed out of the woods near Officer\nHunter, who was some distance from Officers Cassidy and Carson. The\nofficers believed Ryan was unaware of them when he backed out, and\nremained quiet so as not to alert him. Then Ryan made some turning motion\nto his left. The officers say that he turned to face Officer Hunter and pointed\nhis gun at him, while the Coles argue that he merely began to turn toward\nthe CVS, still with his gun pointed at his own head. Whether any warning\nwas given is disputed, but Officers Hunter and Cassidy opened fire, hitting\nRyan twice. In addition, Ryan’s gun discharged, hitting his own head, and\nleaving stippling—gunpowder residue around the wound due to the gun being\nfired from less than thirty inches away.\n\n\n                                      3\n\f     Case: 14-10228       Document: 00513212484         Page: 4    Date Filed: 09/29/2015\n\n\n\n                            No. 14-10228 c/w No. 15-10045\n\n\n       Ryan fell, and the officers ceased firing. He was picked up by an\nambulance and taken for treatment of his severe injuries. Over time, Ryan\nhas made a significant recovery, but lives with profound disabilities. He has\nincurred extensive medical bills and continues to require care. After the\nshooting, the three officers had an opportunity to confer before making their\nstatements to police investigators—statements which conveyed that Ryan\nwas given a warning and that he pointed his gun at Officer Hunter prior to\nbeing shot. The Coles argue that these statements are lies contradicted by\nrecordings and physical evidence.\n       The officers’ statements resulted in Ryan being charged with\naggravated assault on a public servant—a felony. As a result of the assault\ncharge, Ryan was placed under house arrest. The assault charge was\ndismissed by the District Attorney on May 8, 2012, and Ryan received\ndeferred adjudication for an unlawful carrying charge. The Coles incurred\nsubstantial legal fees in order to confront the aggravated assault charge,\nwhich they allege was concocted by the officers to justify the shooting.\n                                             II\n       The Coles brought suit in the Eastern District of Texas. The appellant\nofficers 2 moved to transfer; answered, asserting absolute and qualified\nimmunity defenses; and moved to dismiss or alternatively for the court to\norder a reply to their immunity defenses under Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 7(a). 3 After transfer to the Northern District of Texas, the district\ncourt ordered the Coles to notify it whether they would file additional\n\n\n\n       2Along with other defendants.\n       3 A procedure for employing Rule 7(a) to require a reply when a qualified immunity\ndefense is pleaded with specificity was described in Schultea v. Wood, 47 F.3d 1427 (5th Cir.\n1995).\n                                             4\n\f    Case: 14-10228    Document: 00513212484      Page: 5   Date Filed: 09/29/2015\n\n\n\n                           No. 14-10228 c/w No. 15-10045\n\n\ndocuments in the form of a Rule 7(a) Reply or an amended Complaint.\n      The Coles filed their First Amended Complaint which, as relevant here,\nincludes § 1983 claims against Officers Cassidy and Hunter for excessive\nforce and against all three officers for manufacturing and concealing evidence\nin order to get Ryan falsely charged with assault. The defendants moved to\ndismiss, with the appellant officers asserting absolute and qualified\nimmunity defenses. The court then issued a Memorandum Opinion and\nOrder denying the Motion to Dismiss with respect to the § 1983 claims based\non both excessive force and conspiracy to conceal and manufacture evidence\nto bring a false charge. Officer Carson appealed that order with regard to the\nlatter claim; Officers Cassidy and Hunter did not. The district court stayed\nthe false charge claim as to Cassidy and Hunter pending the result of\nCarson’s appeal. We heard argument on that appeal.\n      Meanwhile, the district court allowed limited discovery focused on\nOfficers Cassidy and Hunter’s qualified immunity defense to the excessive\nforce charge. Those two officers then moved for summary judgment on that\ncharge, which the district court denied. Officers Cassidy and Hunter\nappealed, and we consolidated their appeal with Carson’s.\n                                        III\n      Following the chronology of the underlying events, we turn first to the\nexcessive force claim. The district court denied Officers Cassidy and Hunter’s\nmotion for summary judgment, finding they were not entitled to qualified\nimmunity because, under the plaintiffs’ evidence, their use of force violated\nclearly established law.\n      a. Qualified immunity inquiry at summary judgment\n      The officers are protected “from liability for civil damages” by qualified\nimmunity “insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established\n                                        5\n\f     Case: 14-10228       Document: 00513212484         Page: 6     Date Filed: 09/29/2015\n\n\n\n                            No. 14-10228 c/w No. 15-10045\n\n\nstatutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have\nknown.” 4 Qualified immunity is an immunity from suit and thus should be\nresolved as early as possible. 5 At summary judgment, it is the plaintiff’s\nburden to rebut a claim of qualified immunity once the defendant has\nproperly raised it in good faith. 6\n       “District court orders denying summary judgment on the basis of\nqualified immunity are immediately appealable . . . when based on a\nconclusion of law.” 7 We may not review the district court’s determination that\na genuine fact dispute exists, 8 but we are called to determine whether,\nresolving all fact disputes in the plaintiffs’ favor, the defendants are\nnonetheless entitled to qualified immunity as a matter of law. 9 Within the\nlimited scope of our inquiry, review is de novo. 10 We must:\n       engage in a two-pronged inquiry. The first asks whether the\n       facts, “[t]aken in the light most favorable to the party asserting\n       the injury . . . show the officer’s conduct violated a [federal] right .\n       . . .” The second prong . . . asks whether the right in question was\n       “clearly established” at the time of the violation. 11\n\nWe may address either prong first. 12\n       b. Fourth Amendment violation\n\n\n\n\n       4 Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 231 (2009) (citation omitted).\n       5 Id. at 231-32.\n       6 Salas v.

Swanson, 659 F.3d 359, 371 (5th Cir. 2011) (en banc) (citing Pearson,\n\n555 U.S. at 236).\n                                              6\n\f     Case: 14-10228       Document: 00513212484         Page: 7     Date Filed: 09/29/2015\n\n\n\n                            No. 14-10228 c/w No. 15-10045\n\n\n       To show a violation of the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition against\nexcessive force, the Coles must prove that “the force used was objectively\nunreasonable.” 13 In assessing the reasonableness of the force, we examine:\n       the facts and circumstances of the particular case—the need for\n       force determines how much force is constitutionally permissible.\n       The court should consider “the severity of the crime at issue,\n       whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of\n       the officers or others, and whether he is actively resisting arrest\n       or attempting to evade arrest by flight.” 14\n\nIn deadly force cases, “the severity and immediacy of the threat of harm to\nofficers or others are paramount to the reasonableness analysis.” 15\nAdditionally, we bear in mind both that “[t]he intrusiveness of a seizure by\nmeans of deadly force is unmatched,” 16 and that the use of force “must be\njudged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than\nwith the 20/20 vision of hindsight.” 17\n       Accepting the Coles’ best version of the evidence, as they must, Officers\nCassidy and Hunter argue that shooting Ryan was not objectively\nunreasonable—that he presented an immediate threat of serious harm when\nthey fired. 18 Accordingly, we recount the version of events most favorable to\nthe Coles.\n\n\n       13 Luna v. Mullenix, 773 F.3d 712, 719 (5th Cir. 2014) (citing Goodson v. City of\nCorpus Christi, 202 F.3d 730, 740 (5th Cir. 2000)).

Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 396-97 (1989) (“The calculus of reasonableness\n\nmust embody allowance for the fact that police officers are often forced to make split-second\njudgments—in circumstances that are tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving—about the\namount of force that is necessary in a particular situation.”).\n       18 Both the officers and the Coles focus on the reasonableness of the shooting as a\n\nwhole, without any serious attempt to separate the analysis as to each officer.\n                                              7\n\f    Case: 14-10228   Document: 00513212484     Page: 8   Date Filed: 09/29/2015\n\n\n\n                       No. 14-10228 c/w No. 15-10045\n\n\n      Just before the shooting, Officer Hunter was in an exposed position\nbetween Highway 78 and the narrow wooded area separating it from the\ntrain tracks. He was looking for Ryan, expecting him to be nearby because of\nhis own observations and a radio report that Ryan was on the railroad tracks\nnear his position. Officer Cassidy was also between Highway 78 and the\nwooded area with Officer Carson, but was some distance away. Officer\nHunter heard rustling in the woods near him, and signaled to the other\nofficers that Ryan was there. Ryan then backed out of the woods with his gun\nto his own head, and his back to Officer Hunter. Both Officers Cassidy and\nHunter believed Ryan was initially unaware of their presence, and stayed\nquiet so that he would not become aware of them. Ryan turned somewhat to\nhis left, possibly in order to approach the CVS where his grandparents were\nwaiting, and the officers opened fire without warning. Ryan turned further\naround as the officers continued firing, and his own gun, still pointed at his\nhead and with his finger on the trigger, discharged involuntarily as a result\nof his being shot.\n      At the time they fired, the officers were aware that Ryan had been\nwalking around the neighborhood holding a gun to his head, and that he had\nnot surrendered to other officers who came in contact with him. Ryan looked\nlike a teenager, and Officer Cassidy was aware that he had recently broken\nup with his girlfriend, a student at Sachse High. Officer Hunter believed\nRyan might be suicidal or might simply be using the threat to himself to\nevade officers. Both officers were aware that Ryan had brought guns to Eric\nReed Jr.’s house, and Officer Cassidy knew that there had been a disturbance\nat the Cole house the night before. The officers were aware that Ryan had\ntold Eric not to try to take his remaining gun, and that he did not “wanna use\nit on” him. This was the only threatening or aggressive action or speech\n                                      8\n\f     Case: 14-10228       Document: 00513212484          Page: 9     Date Filed: 09/29/2015\n\n\n\n                            No. 14-10228 c/w No. 15-10045\n\n\nOfficer Hunter was aware of Ryan making. The officers knew that they were\nfiring in the vicinity of a busy road, across from shops and other populated\nbuildings. They knew there were schools within walking distance, and that\nmeasures were taken to secure them and to protect Ryan’s ex-girlfriend.\n       First, the relevant principles. It is clear that the “use of deadly force,\nabsent a sufficiently substantial and immediate threat, violate[s] the Fourth\nAmendment.” 19 The threat must be “immediate”; 20 we consider the totality of\nthe circumstances, 21 including relevant information known to the officers.\n       The fact that a person has a gun and is behaving in a dangerous\nmanner does not necessarily constitute an immediate and serious threat\njustifying use of deadly force. In unpublished but persuasive decisions, we\nhave denied qualified immunity where a person, though undisputedly holding\na gun to his own head, was complying with officers’ orders, 22 and where a\nperson, reportedly armed and a suspect in a double-homicide, had ceased\nrunning and had his arms at his sides. 23 When we have found officers\njustified for shooting suicidal people who were armed with guns, we have\n\n       19 Luna, 773 F.3d at 725.

Instead, they focus on the fact that\nRyan, whose back was initially towards Officer Hunter, turned to his left\nimmediately before they shot. They argue that if they had waited, Ryan could\nhave continued turning until he was facing Officer Hunter, and shot him\nbefore they could react. According to the officers, if Ryan had been allowed to\nturn around and face Officer Hunter without being fired on, he would have\n“posed an immediate deadly threat.”\n       The officers invoke cases in which we have found that a use of deadly\nforce was justified expressly because the person, ignoring police warnings,\nmade some threatening motion towards officers, or moved in a way\nreasonably interpretable as drawing an immediately dangerous weapon. 34\n\n\n       32 The facts here contrast instructively with those in Ballard v. Burton, where we\nfound that shooting was justified even if the suicidal victim did not point his gun directly at\nlaw enforcement officers just before he was shot because “during the course of the night’s\nevents [he] refused to put down his rifle, discharged the rifle into the air several times\nwhile near officers, and pointed it in the general direction of law enforcement officers.” 444\nF.3d 391, 402-03 (5th Cir. 2006).\n       33 Indeed, only Officer Hunter was reported by the officers as being in immediate\n\ndanger. Of course, officers may use deadly force to protect their own lives, but the relative\nopenness and lack of immediate bystanders or chaotic conditions informs our\nunderstanding of the circumstances.\n       34 See, e.g., Rice, 770 F.3d at 1134-35 (finding no constitutional violation where police\n\nwarned and then shot a suicidal man who “was undisputedly approaching the officers with\na loaded weapon which he had recently fired and which he refused to surrender”); Clayton\nv.

Clearly established law\n       Under the second prong of the qualified immunity analysis, we ask\nwhether it was clearly established in October 2010 that using deadly force\nagainst a person in circumstances like those here was objectively\nunreasonable: 41\n       A right is clearly established only if “the right’s contours were\n       sufficiently definite that any reasonable official in the defendant’s\n       shoes would have understood that he was violating it.” A case\n       directly on point is not required; rather, “[t]he central concept is\n       that of ‘fair warning’: The law can be clearly established despite\n       notable factual distinctions between the precedents relied on and\n       the cases then before the Court, so long as the prior decisions\n       gave reasonable warning that the conduct then at issue violated\n       constitutional rights.” 42\n\n       In 2009, we held that “[i]t has long been clearly established that,\nabsent any other justification for the use of force, it is unreasonable for a\npolice officer to use deadly force against a fleeing felon who does not pose a\nsufficient threat of harm to the officer or others.” 43 In Luna v. Mullenix we\nextended that holding, finding that by March 2010, it was clearly established\nthat shooting at a fleeing car whose driver had threatened to shoot pursuing\n\n\n       41 See Saucier v.

First, walking away on foot is less\ninherently dangerous than fleeing in a car. Second, though in Ryan’s case\nofficers could see that he was pointing a gun at his own head, he never\nthreatened officers with it; in Luna, the victim not only claimed to have a gun\nin the fleeing car, but explicitly threatened to shoot police officers. 46 In Luna,\nwe emphasized that the shooting officer decided to shoot the car before it\ncame into view—that he was not forced to make a “split-second judgment.” 47\nIn this case, though the officers may not have decided to shoot ahead of time,\nthey were expecting to encounter exactly what they found: Ryan walking\nwith a gun to his head.\n       By October 2010, we had also repeatedly analyzed the sufficiency of\nManis acts to justify deadly force when the underlying circumstances might\nnot otherwise justify it. 48 In short, by October 2010, reasonable officers were\non notice that they could not lawfully use deadly force to stop a fleeing person\nwho did not pose a severe and immediate risk to the officers or others, and\nthey had many examples of the sorts of threatening actions which could\n\n\n\n\n       44 773 F.3d at 725.\n       45 Id.\n       46 Id. at 722.

As a result, the fact disputes\nidentified by the district court—including the central issue of whether Ryan\npointed his gun at Officer Hunter—are material, and we dismiss the appeal\nfor lack of jurisdiction.\n                                              IV\n       We now turn to the claim that Officer Carson lied and concealed\nevidence in order to protect Officers Hunter and Cassidy after the shooting.\nThe district court refused to dismiss the Coles’ claim that Officer Carson\nagreed and acted with others “to deprive Ryan Cole of various constitutional\nrights including, but not limited to, his right to remain free from malicious\nprosecution, wrongful conviction, and unlawful confinement.” The court\nlocated     the   source    of   the    rights     in   the   “Fourth     and     Fourteenth\nAmendment[s].” Officer Carson appeals, asserting qualified and absolute\nimmunity defenses as he did below.\n\n\n\n\n       49  The out-of-circuit cases cited by the officers do not lead to a different conclusion.\nThey involve situations where the victim had been warned repeatedly yet moved a gun\n“very quickly” and pointed it at officers shortly before being shot, see Thomson v. Salt Lake\nCty., 584 F.3d 1304, 1311 (10th Cir. 2009); where it was difficult for officers to see, and the\nvictim ignored commands at the scene of the shooting and instead escalated matters by\nraising a gun to his head, see Garczynski v. Bradshaw, 573 F.3d 1158, 1162-63, (11th Cir.\n2009); where the victim fired a gun in a chaotic, crowded environment and then ignored an\nofficer’s orders to stop, see Montoute v. Carr, 114 F.3d 181, 185 (11th Cir. 1997); and where\nthe victim ignored the shooting officers’ commands and moved either his gun hand or his\nother hand in the vicinity of his gun just prior to being shot, see Thurman v. Hawkins, CIV.\n13-50-GFVT 2014, WL 4384387, at *1, 4 (E.D. Ky. Sept. 3, 2014). These cases are\ndistinguishable from the facts before us, and in any event do not undermine this circuit’s\nclearly established law.\n                                              15\n\f    Case: 14-10228       Document: 00513212484          Page: 16     Date Filed: 09/29/2015\n\n\n\n                            No. 14-10228 c/w No. 15-10045\n\n\n       The denial of a motion to dismiss based on qualified immunity or a\nsubstantial claim of absolute immunity is immediately appealable to the\nextent it turns on legal questions. 50 We review de novo, 51 accepting “all well-\npleaded facts as true and draw[ing] all reasonable inferences in favor of the\nnonmoving party.” 52 To avoid dismissal based on qualified immunity, the\nColes had to allege (1) “a violation of a constitutional right” which (2) was\n“‘clearly established’ at the time of [Carson’s] alleged misconduct.” 53 The\nColes had the burden of pleading “specific conduct and actions giving rise to a\nconstitutional violation” to meet the defense. 54\n       a. Allegations that Officer Carson fabricated evidence\n       The Coles pled the following relevant facts in their First Amended\nComplaint (FAC) and the expert affidavits they attached to it. 55 First, Ryan\nwas seen by several officers walking in public openly carrying a handgun,\nand at least one witness called police to report that he had a gun. The FAC\nalleges that when Ryan emerged from the wooded area, he was facing away\nfrom Officer Hunter, with the gun held to his own head. Without warning\nRyan or identifying themselves, Officers Hunter and Cassidy opened fire.\nAfter the shooting, Officers Carson, Cassidy, and Hunter were “permitted to\nleave the scene for a considerable period of time without any supervision,”\n\n\n       50  Mitchell v.

The Coles allege that the officers “formed\nand carried out an agreement . . . to hide and cover up . . . the true events” in\norder to justify the use of force and avoid consequences for killing Ryan, who\nthey believed was likely to die. Their alleged aim was to “prosecute and\narrest Ryan Cole for . . . an offense that each of them knew he did not\ncommit.”\n      The Coles allege that Officer Carson made false statements to\ninvestigators that Ryan aimed his gun at Officer Hunter and that Hunter\nwarned him before shooting. The Coles allege that physical evidence,\nrecordings, and expert opinions show these statements cannot be true. They\nallege that the false statements led “Garland police officers [to] file[] a case\nwith the District Attorney’s office in Dallas County charging Ryan Cole with\nthe felony offense of aggravated assault on a public servant.” Ryan was\nsubsequently indicted by a grand jury for that offense, based again on the\nofficers’ statements. “As a result of the fictitious charges . . . Ryan Cole was\nconfined indefinitely under house arrest.” We are also told that “[o]n or about\nMay 8, 2012, the Dallas County District Attorney’s office dismissed” the\nassault charge. “At or near the same time,” Ryan “pleaded no contest” and\n“received deferred adjudication for the charge of unlawfully carrying a\nweapon.” The Coles incurred substantial legal fees in order to confront the\naggravated assault charge.\n      We address the alleged constitutional violations in turn.\n      b.

We have\nsaid that the Fourth Amendment is not implicated by an arrest by an officer with probable\ncause, even when the offense is a misdemeanor occurring outside the officer’s presence.\nFields v. City of S. Houston, 922 F.2d 1183, 1189 (5th Cir. 1991). However, this analysis\n                                               18\n\f    Case: 14-10228     Document: 00513212484       Page: 19    Date Filed: 09/29/2015\n\n\n\n                         No. 14-10228 c/w No. 15-10045\n\n\nissues now, however, because the Coles’ First Amended Complaint fails to set\nout “specific conduct and actions” concerning Ryan’s seizure which can\nsurvive qualified immunity.\n      In Texas, unlawful carrying consists of “intentionally, knowingly, or\nrecklessly carr[ying] on or about [one’s] person a handgun” or other weapon\nwhen one is not on his own property or inside of or directly en route to his\nmotor vehicle. 61 Based on the Coles’ pleadings, it appears that, during the\nentire period Ryan was under house arrest, there was known probable cause\nto arrest him for unlawful carrying of a weapon. Both the unlawful carry and\naggravated assault charges were disposed of “at or near the same time,” after\nwhich Ryan was apparently no longer subject to house arrest.\n      To the extent that the Coles seek to argue that the existence of known\nprobable cause to arrest Ryan for unlawful carrying is not fatal to their\nFourth Amendment claim, they have failed to allege specific conduct to meet\nOfficer Carson’s qualified immunity defense. We are told only that Ryan was\nplaced under house arrest “[a]s a result of [the] fictitious charges.”\n      Given that the face of the FAC reveals the known existence of probable\ncause to arrest for unlawful carrying, and given the Coles’ failure to plead\nfacts supporting a theory of Fourth Amendment violation despite that\nprobable cause, the Coles have not pled a violation of clearly established law,\nand Officer Carson is entitled to qualified immunity. Put another way, the\nColes have alleged that Ryan was placed under house arrest with probable\ncause. That is not a clearly established Fourth Amendment violation without\n\n\n\nmay be affected if Ryan was at home when he was placed under house arrest.

Brady violation\n      The Coles argue that Officer Carson also violated Ryan’s Fourteenth\nAmendment due process rights, due both to a Brady 62 violation, and more\ngenerally to his role in the filing of false charges. The Coles allege that\nOfficer Carson committed a Brady violation in two ways: by lying to conceal\nhis own knowledge that Ryan Cole never assaulted an officer, and by\nconspiring with other officers to conceal physical evidence also tending to\nexculpate Ryan. But prior to 2010, we had held that Brady is not implicated\nwhen there is no trial. 63 Ryan Cole was not tried for aggravated assault, nor\ndid he plead guilty; the charge was dismissed. There is no suggestion that the\naggravated assault charge was used as leverage to secure a plea on the\nunlawful carrying charge. It follows that Officer Carson was not on notice\nthat withholding evidence in these circumstances could violate Brady, and he\nis entitled to qualified immunity for the alleged Brady violations.\n       d. Due process violation – fabrication of evidence\n       We turn now to the Coles’ claim that Officer Carson violated Ryan’s\nclearly established due process rights when he allegedly lied to investigators\nto secure a false charge of aggravated assault.\n       We begin by recognizing that there is no “substantive right under the\nDue Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to be free from criminal\n\n\n\n       62 Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87 (1963) (holding that “suppression by the\nprosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the\nevidence is material either to guilt or to punishment”).\n       63 United States v. Santa Cruz, 297 F. App’x 300, 301 (5th Cir. 2008); see also\n\nMatthew v. Johnson, 201 F.3d 353, 361-62 (5th Cir. 2000) (applying rule in Teague v. Lane,\n489 U.S. 288 (1989), to bar Brady attack on state court conviction).\n                                            20\n\f    Case: 14-10228       Document: 00513212484         Page: 21     Date Filed: 09/29/2015\n\n\n\n                            No. 14-10228 c/w No. 15-10045\n\n\nprosecution except upon probable cause.” 64 That much is clear from the\nSupreme Court’s fractured decision in Albright v. Oliver. In Albright, a\nplaintiff was wrongfully charged with selling a cocaine look-alike substance, a\ncharge later dismissed. 65 The Court rejected his claim that the prosecution\nviolated due process. We have held that Albright’s reach is limited; the case\n“did not speak to the Fourteenth Amendment beyond eschewing reliance\nupon substantive due process to create a requirement of probable cause to\ninitiate a prosecution. . . .” 66 Moreover, “that portion of Albright that suggests\nthat the Fourth Amendment applies to pretrial deprivations of liberty did not\nreceive the support of a majority of the Justices.” 67\n       Albright also differs in two important ways from the case at hand.\nFirst, although the defendant detective in Albright accepted the story of an\nunreliable informant and may have given “misleading” testimony, 68 there\nwas no suggestion that he deliberately fabricated evidence. In contrast, the\nColes allege that Officer Carson deliberately lied in order to get Ryan charged\nto cover an unlawful use of force. Several of our sister circuits have found this\ndistinction pivotal in determining whether a due process violation is\ncommitted by the fabrication of evidence. 69\n       Second, a majority of the Justices in Albright depended upon the\npotential availability of a Fourth Amendment recourse the plaintiff had\n\n\n       64 Albright v.

Yet setting aside his time\nseized under house arrest, Ryan still was framed and charged with a felony,\nand subjected to attendant monetary and reputational injuries flowing from\nsuch a serious charge. Unlike Albright, who chose to invoke substantive due\nprocess rather than the Fourth Amendment, Ryan Cole has no other option.\n                                               1.\n       We built upon the uncertain foundation of Albright in our en banc\ndecision in Castellano v. Fragozo. 72 Castellano held that the elements of a\nstate malicious prosecution claim were neither sufficient nor independently\nnecessary to state a claim under § 1983 where a state actor allegedly\nfabricated evidence to procure an arrest and conviction. 73 Rather, the\nparticular constitutional violation alleged had to be identified with clarity: 74\n       [C]ausing charges to be filed without probable cause will not\n       without more violate the Constitution. . . . It is equally apparent\n       that additional government acts that may attend the initiation of\n       a criminal charge could give rise to claims of constitutional\n       deprivation.\n             The initiation of criminal charges without probable cause\n\n\n       70 Albright, 510 U.S. at 271 (plurality); Id. at 277 (opinion of Ginsburg, J.)

Driver that officials’ perjured testimony and\ntampering with video evidence constituted a due process violation even where\nthe plaintiff was acquitted. 79 Thus even when a trial functions properly to\nvindicate a person’s innocence, the “manufacturing of evidence and knowing\nuse of that evidence along with perjured testimony to obtain a wrongful\nconviction deprives a defendant of his long recognized right to a fair trial\nsecured by the Due Process Clause.” 80\n       We returned once more to Albright and Castellano in Cuadra v.\nHouston Independent School District. 81 There we considered a claim against a\nschool district for manipulating evidence which led to charges against the\n\n\n       75 Id. at 953.\n       76 Id. at 953-55, 960.

Cuadra focused on a failure\nof certain school officials to turn over a key document; 84 and in Bosarge, we\ndid not credit conclusory allegations that the misidentification was\nintentional. 85 Neither case answers the question of whether deliberate\nfabrication by law enforcement officers to justify a police shooting violates\ndue process.\n      In sum, we have held that a victim of intentional fabrication of\nevidence by officials is denied due process when he is either convicted or\nacquitted. We have never decided whether false charges must survive to the\ntrial stage in order to implicate due process rights.\n                                            2.\n      Our sister circuits have taken varying approaches to fabrication of\nevidence and “malicious prosecution” claims in the wake of Albright. 86 That\nsaid, they largely either have held that charges based on fabricated evidence\nsupport a due process claim, or have not yet answered the question.

Abbey that “there is a clearly\nestablished constitutional due process right not to be subjected to criminal\ncharges on the basis of false evidence that was deliberately fabricated by the\ngovernment,” 87 a formulation we quoted approvingly in Good v. Curtis. 88 In\nDevereaux, the plaintiff alleged that investigators charged him with rape and\nmolestation on the basis of statements they should have known were false. 89\nThough the charges were dropped in exchange for a guilty plea to two\nmisdemeanors, 90 the Ninth Circuit reasoned that:\n      Under Pyle v. Kansas, 317 U.S. 213, 216 (1942), the knowing use\n      by the prosecution of perjured testimony in order to secure a\n      criminal conviction violates the Constitution. While Pyle does not\n      deal specifically with the bringing of criminal charges, as opposed\n      to the securing of a conviction, we find that the wrongfulness of\n      charging someone on the basis of deliberately fabricated evidence\n      is sufficiently obvious, and Pyle is sufficiently analogous, that the\n      right to be free from such charges is a constitutional right. 91\n\n      In Ricciuti v. N.Y.C. Transit Authority, the police arrested a plaintiff\nwith probable cause, but then allegedly fabricated a confession resulting in\nadditional charges. 92 The Second Circuit denied qualified immunity for the\nfabrication despite the fact that the charges were dismissed without trial. 93\nThe court held that “[w]hen a police officer creates false information likely to\ninfluence a jury’s decision and forwards that information to prosecutors, he\n\n\n      87 263 F.3d 1070, 1074-75 (9th Cir. 2001) (en banc).\n      88 601 F.3d at 398-99.\n      89 263 F.3d at 1073.\n      90 Id.\n      91 Id. at 1075 (citation shortened).\n      92 124 F.3d 123, 126-27, 129 (2d Cir. 1997).\n      93 Id. at 129-30 (citing due process cases and principles).\n\n                                             25\n\f    Case: 14-10228       Document: 00513212484        Page: 26     Date Filed: 09/29/2015\n\n\n\n                           No. 14-10228 c/w No. 15-10045\n\n\nviolates the accused’s constitutional right to a fair trial, and the harm\noccasioned by such an unconscionable action is redressable in an action for\ndamages under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.” 94 The Second Circuit has since recognized\nthat the fabrication in Ricciuti deprived the plaintiffs of liberty in part\nbecause it “caused [them] to be charged with a more serious crime.” 95\n       In Pierce v. Gilchrist, a plaintiff was arrested and convicted on the\nbasis of falsified evidence created by an investigator. 96 Though not always\ndistinguishing clearly between the plaintiff’s Fourth and Fourteenth\nAmendment claims, 97 the Tenth Circuit upheld the district court’s refusal to\ndismiss on qualified immunity grounds based on the use of false evidence to\n“induce prosecutors to initiate an unwarranted prosecution.” 98 The court\nexplained that it saw no “reason to distinguish between falsifying evidence to\nfacilitate a wrongful arrest and engaging in the same conduct several days\nlater to induce prosecutors to initiate an unwarranted prosecution.” 99 Thus\nthe fact that there was probable cause for the arrest was immaterial.

In Klen v. City\nof Loveland, the court reversed a grant of summary judgment against a claim\nthat various defendants fabricated evidence “thus facilitating” prosecution of\na plaintiff who eventually pleaded no-contest. 102 There the court noted that\n“[u]se of an indictment based on perjured testimony to bring charges, for\nexample, itself represents a denial of due process” despite the lack of a\ntrial; 103 the “use of a perjured affidavit to defeat a defendant’s attempt to\ndismiss an indictment on grounds of selective prosecution” could also support\na due process claim. 104\n      The Eighth Circuit likewise found that a due process claim is stated\nwhere a police officer claimed that, though he was innocent of using excessive\nforce against a victim, he was “set up,” prosecuted (and acquitted), and\nadministratively charged “for patently arbitrary reasons.” 105 In Moran v.\nClarke, the en banc court held that the substantive due process claim should\nnot have been denied in a judgment as a matter of law because the officer\npresented evidence that he was intentionally set up, and there was damage to\nhis professional reputation and evidence of improper consideration of his\nrace. 106 Such actions could violate fundamental rights and “shock the\nconscience.” 107 The Eighth Circuit has since found that a substantive due\nprocess violation survived summary judgment in the absence of a trial where\n\n\n      101  Becker, 494 F.3d at 924. The Tenth Circuit has also emphasized the importance of\nintentional fabrications. See Kennedy, 552 F.

The Seventh\nCircuit’s decisions appear to point the other way. The court has held that “a\npolice officer does not violate an acquitted defendant’s due process rights\nwhen he fabricates evidence.” 110 Acquittal forecloses the claim. 111 In the\nSeventh Circuit’s view, the only liberty interest damaged in such cases\n“stems from [plaintiff’s] initial arrest” 112 and should be addressed under the\nFourth Amendment; 113 being forced to defend oneself at trial is no\ndeprivation of liberty. 114 The Seventh Circuit’s no-due process violation\ndecisions have occurred in cases that either did not address the availability of\na Fourth Amendment claim 115 or found that the claim had been purposefully\nabandoned, 116 and it has suggested a willingness to consider deprivations\nshort of conviction and imprisonment if properly raised. 117\n      The remaining circuits do not appear to have answered the question\nbefore us.

This is one such: if any concept is\n       fundamental to our American system of justice, it is that those\n       charged with upholding the law are prohibited from deliberately\n       fabricating evidence and framing individuals for crimes they did\n       not commit. Actions taken in contravention of this prohibition\n       necessarily violate due process (indeed, we are unsure what due\n       process entails if not protection against deliberate framing under\n       color of official sanction). 121\n\nClear enough, but the circuit does not appear to have explicitly addressed\nwhether false charges in the absence of a conviction or immediate\npunishment state a denial of due process.\n       The Third Circuit considered a § 1983 claim that police fabricated\nevidence leading to charges and a wrongful conviction. 122 Though the court\nexpressly did not answer “whether pre-trial detentions can implicate\nconstitutional rights beyond the Fourth Amendment,” 123 it did state that\n“[w]hen falsified evidence is used as a basis to initiate the prosecution of a\ndefendant, or is used to convict him, the defendant has been injured.” 124 The\nSixth Circuit “recognize[s] a . . . claim of malicious prosecution under the\nFourth Amendment, which encompasses wrongful investigation, prosecution,\nconviction, and incarceration,” 125 but it remains unclear whether a\n\n\n       120  See Drumgold, 707 F.3d at 61-62 & n.27.\n       121  Limone, 372 F.3d at 44-45 (citation to Devereaux, 263 F.3d at 1074-75, omitted);\nsee also Halsey v.

Circuit does not appear to have addressed the issue of\nwhether a due process claim could lie when police fabricate evidence, though\nit has noted its view that Albright “held that malicious prosecution does not\nviolate ‘substantive’ due process rights.” 128 The Eleventh Circuit has done\nlikewise, 129 though noting the possibility that a procedural due process claim\nmight lie. 130 The circuit recently recognized a due process claim where a\nplaintiff alleged that police officers shot, tasered, and beat him, and then\nfabricated a cover-up which resulted in two years of jail and an eventual\nacquittal on charges of aggravated assault on a law enforcement officer. 131\n                                             3.\n\n\n       126 444 F.3d 725, 750 (6th Cir. 2006).\n       127  Id. at 748 n.10.

It\n       has been described as conduct that ‘violates the decencies of\n       civilized conduct’; conduct that is ‘so brutal and offensive that it\n       [does] not comport with traditional ideas of fair play and\n       decency’; conduct that ‘interferes with rights implicit in the\n       concept of ordered liberty’; and conduct that ‘is so egregious, so\n       outrageous, that it may fairly be said to shock the contemporary\n       conscience.’ 134\n\nDeliberate framing of a person by the state offends the most strongly held\nvalues of our nation. We echo again the apt words of the First Circuit that, “if\nany concept is fundamental to our American system of justice, it is that those\ncharged with upholding the law are prohibited from deliberately fabricating\nevidence and framing individuals.” 135 As the Third Circuit has stated, “no\nsensible concept of ordered liberty is consistent with law enforcement cooking\n\n\n\n\n       132 Boyd, 579 F.3d at 514.\n       133 Doe ex rel.

The rule of law, which we have cherished\nsince our founding, cannot abide such conduct.\n       We agree with the Second Circuit that official framing of a person in\nthese circumstances undermines the right to a fair trial. 137 Being framed and\nfalsely charged brings inevitable damage to the person’s reputation,\nespecially where, as here, the crime is a felony involving the threat of\nviolence. 138 Alongside the reputational damage, 139 it requires the person\nframed to mount a defense, 140 and places him in the power of a court of law,\nwhere he may be required to appear. 141 Though these wrongs may be\naddressed through a Fourth Amendment challenge in many cases, 142 they do\nnot disappear where there is no violation of that amendment. Instead, where\nthere is no more specific constitutional protection available, the Fourteenth\nAmendment may offer protection. 143 It does so here, where the conduct is\n\n\n       136  Halsey, 750 F.3d at 292-93.\n       137  Ricciuti, 124 F.3d at 130; see also Boyd, 579 F.3d at 515 (noting that the right to a\nfair trial is undermined by state fabrication of evidence even when defendant is acquitted).\n        138 See Albright, 510 U.S. at 278 (opinion of Ginsburg, J.)

As the Supreme Court has explained, “the right to due process of law is\nquite clearly established by the Due Process Clause, and thus there is a sense\nin which any action that violates that Clause (no matter how unclear it may\nbe that the particular action is a violation) violates a clearly established\nright.” 146 That is not the test, as it would “convert the rule of qualified\nimmunity that our cases plainly establish into a rule of virtually unqualified\nliability.” 147 On the other hand, officials may be on notice that their conduct\nis unlawful even in “novel factual circumstances,” 148 though the courts have\n\n\n\n‘that Amendment, not the more generalized notion of “substantive due process,” must be\nthe guide for analyzing these claims.’”) (quoting Graham v.

The Coles clearly allege that Officer Carson conspired with others and\nintentionally lied in order to cover for his colleagues, among other things\ntelling investigators that Ryan turned and pointed his gun at the police. The\nColes further allege that Officer Carson and other officers’ lies led directly to\nthe decision to charge Ryan with aggravated assault. As we have explained,\nthat is enough for us to determine that they have pled a clearly established\nconstitutional violation.\n                                             V\n      Officer Carson claims absolute immunity for all of his alleged conduct\nunder Rehburg v. Paulk, 157 where the Supreme Court found that all grand\njury witnesses have:\n      absolute immunity from any § 1983 claim based on the witness’\n      testimony. In addition . . . this rule may not be circumvented by\n      claiming that a grand jury witness conspired to present false\n      testimony or by using evidence of the witness’ testimony to\n      support any other § 1983 claim concerning the initiation or\n      maintenance of a prosecution . . . In the vast majority of cases\n      involving a claim against a grand jury witness, the witness and\n      the prosecutor conducting the investigation engage in\n      preparatory activity, such as a preliminary discussion in which\n      the witness relates the substance of his intended testimony. We\n      decline to endorse a rule of absolute immunity that is so easily\n      frustrated. 158\n\nThe Court recognized that absolute immunity does not “extend[] to all\nactivity that a witness conducts outside of the grand jury room.

He\nargues that all of his alleged conduct falls into those categories, but the First\nAmended Complaint goes further. The Coles allege that Officer Carson made\nfalse statements in the course of the initial investigation into the shooting,\nbefore a decision had been made by prosecutors to charge Ryan with\naggravated assault. The FAC indicates that Carson intended these\nstatements to influence the decision to bring charges against Ryan in the first\nplace.\n         An officer who lies to investigating officers in order to try to get\nsomeone charged with a crime—before the decision to charge has been\nmade—is not entitled to absolute testimonial immunity. The Supreme Court\nhas held that a prosecutor is not entitled to absolute immunity when she\nfalsifies an affidavit supporting an arrest warrant. 160 Neither is a police\nofficer who submits an affidavit for a warrant, leading to an arrest without\nprobable cause. 161 Nor are prosecutors absolutely immune when they act\nalongside police officers to “solve” an unsolved crime by shopping for an\nunscrupulous expert. 162 Rehberg confirmed that these holdings are still good\nlaw. 163 We have likewise held that “non-testimonial pretrial actions, such as\nthe fabrication of evidence, are not within the scope of absolute immunity\n\n\n\n         159Id. at 1507 n.1 (citations omitted).\n         160Kalina v.

The Supreme Court\nand this court have emphasized that absolute immunity for prosecutors,\nwitnesses, and others is based on a need to protect central judicial\nproceedings. 165 Thus conduct that occurs during investigation to discover\nprobable cause and before the decision to charge has been made is not\ngenerally entitled to absolute immunity. 166 Some of the false statements in\nthis case are alleged to have been this investigation-stage type of conduct.\n       In these circumstances, lying to investigating officers is similar to\n\n\n       164    Castellano, 352 F.3d at 958 & n.107 (citing Buckley, 509 U.S. at 275-76, and\nSpurlock v.

Rather it was based on [defendant’s] conduct that laid the\ngroundwork for [the] indictment.” 169 So here; the fact that some of Officer\nCarson’s statements may have been presented to the grand jury can be\nexcised from the complaint and the Coles still make out a case that Carson\nlied in order to ensure charges would be brought in the first place.\n       A final wrinkle must be addressed. While we have said that plaintiffs\nmust plead with specificity when absolute immunity is asserted, just as with\nqualified immunity, 170 the Supreme Court has held that “the official seeking\nabsolute immunity bears the burden of showing that such immunity is\njustified for the function in question.” 171 Officials bear the “burden of\n\n\n\n       167 Coggins v.

HIGGINBOTHAM, Circuit Judge:\n      Seventeen-year-old Ryan Cole was severely injured in an armed\nencounter with police. Ryan and his parents, Karen and Randy Cole (“the\nColes”), brought suit against Officers Michael Hunter and Martin Cassidy,\nalleging that they violated Ryan’s Fourth Amendment right not to be\nsubjected to excessive force. They also sued Officer Carl Carson, alleging\nCarson violated Ryan’s rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments\nby lying and concealing evidence in order to protect Hunter and Cassidy; that\nhe caused Ryan to be wrongfully charged with aggravated assault of a public\nservant. The district court denied Carson’s motion to dismiss and Hunter and\nCassidy’s motion for summary judgment, rejecting the officers’ immunity\ndefense at the motion stage of the case.\n       We dismiss defendants’ appeal of the district court’s order refusing to\ngrant summary judgment on the excessive force claim, and we affirm the\ndistrict court’s refusal to dismiss the due process claim relating to fabrication\nof evidence. However, we conclude that the district court erred in allowing all\nother claims to proceed.\n                                            I\n       Seventeen-year-old Ryan Cole was a junior at Sachse High School. 1\nRyan suffered from obsessive-compulsive disorder. The night before the\nshooting, he quarreled with his parents, and later took guns and ammunition\nfrom their gun safe. He visited his friend Eric Reed Jr. late that night\n\n\n\n      1 One of the cases before us comes from a denial of summary judgment, and one from\na denial of a motion to dismiss. They involve distinct standards of review and universes of\nrelevant facts. For purposes of this summary, we describe the facts in broad strokes,\nturning to their detail as we address specific issues.\n                                            2\n\f    Case: 14-10228    Document: 00513212484    Page: 3   Date Filed: 09/29/2015\n\n\n\n                       No. 14-10228 c/w No. 15-10045\n\n\ncarrying weapons. The next morning, October 25, 2010, Ryan visited Eric\nagain carrying two handguns: a revolver and a Springfield 9mm semi-\nautomatic. At around 10:45 in the morning Ryan allowed Eric to take the\nrevolver, and used Eric’s cellphone to ask his grandparents to pick him up at\na nearby CVS.\n      During the course of the morning, police were informed that Ryan was\ncarrying at least one gun and acting aggressively, and they began looking for\nhim. After Ryan left Eric’s house with his remaining handgun, he was seen\nby several officers and ordered to stop. He continued to walk away from the\nofficers and placed the gun against his own head. He walked towards a set of\ntrain tracks separated by a narrow wooded area and grassy strip from\nHighway 78, a major road. The CVS where he was to meet his grandparents\nwas located on the other side of the wooded area, across Highway 78.\n      Three police officers—Hunter, Cassidy, and Carson—were attempting\nto locate Ryan on the other side of the wooded area, near Highway 78 and the\nCVS. Ryan crossed the wooded area and backed out of the woods near Officer\nHunter, who was some distance from Officers Cassidy and Carson. The\nofficers believed Ryan was unaware of them when he backed out, and\nremained quiet so as not to alert him. Then Ryan made some turning motion\nto his left. The officers say that he turned to face Officer Hunter and pointed\nhis gun at him, while the Coles argue that he merely began to turn toward\nthe CVS, still with his gun pointed at his own head. Whether any warning\nwas given is disputed, but Officers Hunter and Cassidy opened fire, hitting\nRyan twice. In addition, Ryan’s gun discharged, hitting his own head, and\nleaving stippling—gunpowder residue around the wound due to the gun being\nfired from less than thirty inches away.\n\n\n                                      3\n\f     Case: 14-10228       Document: 00513212484         Page: 4    Date Filed: 09/29/2015\n\n\n\n                            No. 14-10228 c/w No. 15-10045\n\n\n       Ryan fell, and the officers ceased firing. He was picked up by an\nambulance and taken for treatment of his severe injuries. Over time, Ryan\nhas made a significant recovery, but lives with profound disabilities. He has\nincurred extensive medical bills and continues to require care. After the\nshooting, the three officers had an opportunity to confer before making their\nstatements to police investigators—statements which conveyed that Ryan\nwas given a warning and that he pointed his gun at Officer Hunter prior to\nbeing shot. The Coles argue that these statements are lies contradicted by\nrecordings and physical evidence.\n       The officers’ statements resulted in Ryan being charged with\naggravated assault on a public servant—a felony. As a result of the assault\ncharge, Ryan was placed under house arrest. The assault charge was\ndismissed by the District Attorney on May 8, 2012, and Ryan received\ndeferred adjudication for an unlawful carrying charge. The Coles incurred\nsubstantial legal fees in order to confront the aggravated assault charge,\nwhich they allege was concocted by the officers to justify the shooting.\n                                             II\n       The Coles brought suit in the Eastern District of Texas. The appellant\nofficers 2 moved to transfer; answered, asserting absolute and qualified\nimmunity defenses; and moved to dismiss or alternatively for the court to\norder a reply to their immunity defenses under Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 7(a). 3 After transfer to the Northern District of Texas, the district\ncourt ordered the Coles to notify it whether they would file additional\n\n\n\n       2Along with other defendants.\n       3 A procedure for employing Rule 7(a) to require a reply when a qualified immunity\ndefense is pleaded with specificity was described in Schultea v.

The defendants moved to\ndismiss, with the appellant officers asserting absolute and qualified\nimmunity defenses. The court then issued a Memorandum Opinion and\nOrder denying the Motion to Dismiss with respect to the § 1983 claims based\non both excessive force and conspiracy to conceal and manufacture evidence\nto bring a false charge. Officer Carson appealed that order with regard to the\nlatter claim; Officers Cassidy and Hunter did not. The district court stayed\nthe false charge claim as to Cassidy and Hunter pending the result of\nCarson’s appeal. We heard argument on that appeal.\n      Meanwhile, the district court allowed limited discovery focused on\nOfficers Cassidy and Hunter’s qualified immunity defense to the excessive\nforce charge. Those two officers then moved for summary judgment on that\ncharge, which the district court denied. Officers Cassidy and Hunter\nappealed, and we consolidated their appeal with Carson’s.\n                                        III\n      Following the chronology of the underlying events, we turn first to the\nexcessive force claim. The district court denied Officers Cassidy and Hunter’s\nmotion for summary judgment, finding they were not entitled to qualified\nimmunity because, under the plaintiffs’ evidence, their use of force violated\nclearly established law.\n      a. Qualified immunity inquiry at summary judgment\n      The officers are protected “from liability for civil damages” by qualified\nimmunity “insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established\n                                        5\n\f     Case: 14-10228       Document: 00513212484         Page: 6     Date Filed: 09/29/2015\n\n\n\n                            No. 14-10228 c/w No. 15-10045\n\n\nstatutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have\nknown.” 4 Qualified immunity is an immunity from suit and thus should be\nresolved as early as possible. 5 At summary judgment, it is the plaintiff’s\nburden to rebut a claim of qualified immunity once the defendant has\nproperly raised it in good faith. 6\n       “District court orders denying summary judgment on the basis of\nqualified immunity are immediately appealable . . . when based on a\nconclusion of law.” 7 We may not review the district court’s determination that\na genuine fact dispute exists, 8 but we are called to determine whether,\nresolving all fact disputes in the plaintiffs’ favor, the defendants are\nnonetheless entitled to qualified immunity as a matter of law. 9 Within the\nlimited scope of our inquiry, review is de novo. 10 We must:\n       engage in a two-pronged inquiry. The first asks whether the\n       facts, “[t]aken in the light most favorable to the party asserting\n       the injury . . . show the officer’s conduct violated a [federal] right .\n       . . .” The second prong . . . asks whether the right in question was\n       “clearly established” at the time of the violation. 11\n\nWe may address either prong first. 12\n       b.

He was looking for Ryan, expecting him to be nearby because of\nhis own observations and a radio report that Ryan was on the railroad tracks\nnear his position. Officer Cassidy was also between Highway 78 and the\nwooded area with Officer Carson, but was some distance away. Officer\nHunter heard rustling in the woods near him, and signaled to the other\nofficers that Ryan was there. Ryan then backed out of the woods with his gun\nto his own head, and his back to Officer Hunter. Both Officers Cassidy and\nHunter believed Ryan was initially unaware of their presence, and stayed\nquiet so that he would not become aware of them. Ryan turned somewhat to\nhis left, possibly in order to approach the CVS where his grandparents were\nwaiting, and the officers opened fire without warning. Ryan turned further\naround as the officers continued firing, and his own gun, still pointed at his\nhead and with his finger on the trigger, discharged involuntarily as a result\nof his being shot.\n      At the time they fired, the officers were aware that Ryan had been\nwalking around the neighborhood holding a gun to his head, and that he had\nnot surrendered to other officers who came in contact with him. Ryan looked\nlike a teenager, and Officer Cassidy was aware that he had recently broken\nup with his girlfriend, a student at Sachse High. Officer Hunter believed\nRyan might be suicidal or might simply be using the threat to himself to\nevade officers. Both officers were aware that Ryan had brought guns to Eric\nReed Jr.’s house, and Officer Cassidy knew that there had been a disturbance\nat the Cole house the night before. The officers were aware that Ryan had\ntold Eric not to try to take his remaining gun, and that he did not “wanna use\nit on” him. This was the only threatening or aggressive action or speech\n                                      8\n\f     Case: 14-10228       Document: 00513212484          Page: 9     Date Filed: 09/29/2015\n\n\n\n                            No. 14-10228 c/w No. 15-10045\n\n\nOfficer Hunter was aware of Ryan making.

They knew there were schools within walking distance, and that\nmeasures were taken to secure them and to protect Ryan’s ex-girlfriend.\n       First, the relevant principles. It is clear that the “use of deadly force,\nabsent a sufficiently substantial and immediate threat, violate[s] the Fourth\nAmendment.” 19 The threat must be “immediate”; 20 we consider the totality of\nthe circumstances, 21 including relevant information known to the officers.\n       The fact that a person has a gun and is behaving in a dangerous\nmanner does not necessarily constitute an immediate and serious threat\njustifying use of deadly force. In unpublished but persuasive decisions, we\nhave denied qualified immunity where a person, though undisputedly holding\na gun to his own head, was complying with officers’ orders, 22 and where a\nperson, reportedly armed and a suspect in a double-homicide, had ceased\nrunning and had his arms at his sides. 23 When we have found officers\njustified for shooting suicidal people who were armed with guns, we have\n\n       19 Luna, 773 F.3d at 725.

Instead, they focus on the fact that\nRyan, whose back was initially towards Officer Hunter, turned to his left\nimmediately before they shot. They argue that if they had waited, Ryan could\nhave continued turning until he was facing Officer Hunter, and shot him\nbefore they could react. According to the officers, if Ryan had been allowed to\nturn around and face Officer Hunter without being fired on, he would have\n“posed an immediate deadly threat.”\n       The officers invoke cases in which we have found that a use of deadly\nforce was justified expressly because the person, ignoring police warnings,\nmade some threatening motion towards officers, or moved in a way\nreasonably interpretable as drawing an immediately dangerous weapon. 34\n\n\n       32 The facts here contrast instructively with those in Ballard v. Burton, where we\nfound that shooting was justified even if the suicidal victim did not point his gun directly at\nlaw enforcement officers just before he was shot because “during the course of the night’s\nevents [he] refused to put down his rifle, discharged the rifle into the air several times\nwhile near officers, and pointed it in the general direction of law enforcement officers.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">444</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">391</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 402-03 (5th Cir. 2006).\n       33 Indeed, only Officer Hunter was reported by the officers as being in immediate\n\ndanger. Of course, officers may use deadly force to protect their own lives, but the relative\nopenness and lack of immediate bystanders or chaotic conditions informs our\nunderstanding of the circumstances.\n       34 See, e.g., Rice, 770 F.3d at 1134-35 (finding no constitutional violation where police\n\nwarned and then shot a suicidal man who “was undisputedly approaching the officers with\na loaded weapon which he had recently fired and which he refused to surrender”); Clayton\nv.

Clearly established law\n       Under the second prong of the qualified immunity analysis, we ask\nwhether it was clearly established in October 2010 that using deadly force\nagainst a person in circumstances like those here was objectively\nunreasonable: 41\n       A right is clearly established only if “the right’s contours were\n       sufficiently definite that any reasonable official in the defendant’s\n       shoes would have understood that he was violating it.” A case\n       directly on point is not required; rather, “[t]he central concept is\n       that of ‘fair warning’: The law can be clearly established despite\n       notable factual distinctions between the precedents relied on and\n       the cases then before the Court, so long as the prior decisions\n       gave reasonable warning that the conduct then at issue violated\n       constitutional rights.” 42\n\n       In 2009, we held that “[i]t has long been clearly established that,\nabsent any other justification for the use of force, it is unreasonable for a\npolice officer to use deadly force against a fleeing felon who does not pose a\nsufficient threat of harm to the officer or others.” 43 In Luna v.

First, walking away on foot is less\ninherently dangerous than fleeing in a car. Second, though in Ryan’s case\nofficers could see that he was pointing a gun at his own head, he never\nthreatened officers with it; in Luna, the victim not only claimed to have a gun\nin the fleeing car, but explicitly threatened to shoot police officers. 46 In Luna,\nwe emphasized that the shooting officer decided to shoot the car before it\ncame into view—that he was not forced to make a “split-second judgment.” 47\nIn this case, though the officers may not have decided to shoot ahead of time,\nthey were expecting to encounter exactly what they found: Ryan walking\nwith a gun to his head.\n       By October 2010, we had also repeatedly analyzed the sufficiency of\nManis acts to justify deadly force when the underlying circumstances might\nnot otherwise justify it. 48 In short, by October 2010, reasonable officers were\non notice that they could not lawfully use deadly force to stop a fleeing person\nwho did not pose a severe and immediate risk to the officers or others, and\nthey had many examples of the sorts of threatening actions which could\n\n\n\n\n       44 773 F.3d at 725.\n       45 Id.\n       46 Id. at 722.

Their alleged aim was to “prosecute and\narrest Ryan Cole for . . . an offense that each of them knew he did not\ncommit.”\n      The Coles allege that Officer Carson made false statements to\ninvestigators that Ryan aimed his gun at Officer Hunter and that Hunter\nwarned him before shooting. The Coles allege that physical evidence,\nrecordings, and expert opinions show these statements cannot be true. They\nallege that the false statements led “Garland police officers [to] file[] a case\nwith the District Attorney’s office in Dallas County charging Ryan Cole with\nthe felony offense of aggravated assault on a public servant.” Ryan was\nsubsequently indicted by a grand jury for that offense, based again on the\nofficers’ statements. “As a result of the fictitious charges . . . Ryan Cole was\nconfined indefinitely under house arrest.” We are also told that “[o]n or about\nMay 8, 2012, the Dallas County District Attorney’s office dismissed” the\nassault charge. “At or near the same time,” Ryan “pleaded no contest” and\n“received deferred adjudication for the charge of unlawfully carrying a\nweapon.” The Coles incurred substantial legal fees in order to confront the\naggravated assault charge.\n      We address the alleged constitutional violations in turn.\n      b.

Both the unlawful carry and\naggravated assault charges were disposed of “at or near the same time,” after\nwhich Ryan was apparently no longer subject to house arrest.\n      To the extent that the Coles seek to argue that the existence of known\nprobable cause to arrest Ryan for unlawful carrying is not fatal to their\nFourth Amendment claim, they have failed to allege specific conduct to meet\nOfficer Carson’s qualified immunity defense. We are told only that Ryan was\nplaced under house arrest “[a]s a result of [the] fictitious charges.”\n      Given that the face of the FAC reveals the known existence of probable\ncause to arrest for unlawful carrying, and given the Coles’ failure to plead\nfacts supporting a theory of Fourth Amendment violation despite that\nprobable cause, the Coles have not pled a violation of clearly established law,\nand Officer Carson is entitled to qualified immunity. Put another way, the\nColes have alleged that Ryan was placed under house arrest with probable\ncause. That is not a clearly established Fourth Amendment violation without\n\n\n\nmay be affected if Ryan was at home when he was placed under house arrest.

Brady violation\n      The Coles argue that Officer Carson also violated Ryan’s Fourteenth\nAmendment due process rights, due both to a Brady 62 violation, and more\ngenerally to his role in the filing of false charges. The Coles allege that\nOfficer Carson committed a Brady violation in two ways: by lying to conceal\nhis own knowledge that Ryan Cole never assaulted an officer, and by\nconspiring with other officers to conceal physical evidence also tending to\nexculpate Ryan. But prior to 2010, we had held that Brady is not implicated\nwhen there is no trial. 63 Ryan Cole was not tried for aggravated assault, nor\ndid he plead guilty; the charge was dismissed. There is no suggestion that the\naggravated assault charge was used as leverage to secure a plea on the\nunlawful carrying charge. It follows that Officer Carson was not on notice\nthat withholding evidence in these circumstances could violate Brady, and he\nis entitled to qualified immunity for the alleged Brady violations.\n       d. Due process violation – fabrication of evidence\n       We turn now to the Coles’ claim that Officer Carson violated Ryan’s\nclearly established due process rights when he allegedly lied to investigators\nto secure a false charge of aggravated assault.\n       We begin by recognizing that there is no “substantive right under the\nDue Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to be free from criminal\n\n\n\n       62 Brady v.

In Albright, a\nplaintiff was wrongfully charged with selling a cocaine look-alike substance, a\ncharge later dismissed. 65 The Court rejected his claim that the prosecution\nviolated due process. We have held that Albright’s reach is limited; the case\n“did not speak to the Fourteenth Amendment beyond eschewing reliance\nupon substantive due process to create a requirement of probable cause to\ninitiate a prosecution. . . .” 66 Moreover, “that portion of Albright that suggests\nthat the Fourth Amendment applies to pretrial deprivations of liberty did not\nreceive the support of a majority of the Justices.” 67\n       Albright also differs in two important ways from the case at hand.\nFirst, although the defendant detective in Albright accepted the story of an\nunreliable informant and may have given “misleading” testimony, 68 there\nwas no suggestion that he deliberately fabricated evidence. In contrast, the\nColes allege that Officer Carson deliberately lied in order to get Ryan charged\nto cover an unlawful use of force. Several of our sister circuits have found this\ndistinction pivotal in determining whether a due process violation is\ncommitted by the fabrication of evidence. 69\n       Second, a majority of the Justices in Albright depended upon the\npotential availability of a Fourth Amendment recourse the plaintiff had\n\n\n       64 Albright v.

In Klen v. City\nof Loveland, the court reversed a grant of summary judgment against a claim\nthat various defendants fabricated evidence “thus facilitating” prosecution of\na plaintiff who eventually pleaded no-contest. 102 There the court noted that\n“[u]se of an indictment based on perjured testimony to bring charges, for\nexample, itself represents a denial of due process” despite the lack of a\ntrial; 103 the “use of a perjured affidavit to defeat a defendant’s attempt to\ndismiss an indictment on grounds of selective prosecution” could also support\na due process claim. 104\n      The Eighth Circuit likewise found that a due process claim is stated\nwhere a police officer claimed that, though he was innocent of using excessive\nforce against a victim, he was “set up,” prosecuted (and acquitted), and\nadministratively charged “for patently arbitrary reasons.” 105 In Moran v.\nClarke, the en banc court held that the substantive due process claim should\nnot have been denied in a judgment as a matter of law because the officer\npresented evidence that he was intentionally set up, and there was damage to\nhis professional reputation and evidence of improper consideration of his\nrace. 106 Such actions could violate fundamental rights and “shock the\nconscience.” 107 The Eighth Circuit has since found that a substantive due\nprocess violation survived summary judgment in the absence of a trial where\n\n\n      101  Becker, 494 F.3d at 924.

The Seventh\nCircuit’s decisions appear to point the other way. The court has held that “a\npolice officer does not violate an acquitted defendant’s due process rights\nwhen he fabricates evidence.” 110 Acquittal forecloses the claim. 111 In the\nSeventh Circuit’s view, the only liberty interest damaged in such cases\n“stems from [plaintiff’s] initial arrest” 112 and should be addressed under the\nFourth Amendment; 113 being forced to defend oneself at trial is no\ndeprivation of liberty. 114 The Seventh Circuit’s no-due process violation\ndecisions have occurred in cases that either did not address the availability of\na Fourth Amendment claim 115 or found that the claim had been purposefully\nabandoned, 116 and it has suggested a willingness to consider deprivations\nshort of conviction and imprisonment if properly raised. 117\n      The remaining circuits do not appear to have answered the question\nbefore us.

It\n       has been described as conduct that ‘violates the decencies of\n       civilized conduct’; conduct that is ‘so brutal and offensive that it\n       [does] not comport with traditional ideas of fair play and\n       decency’; conduct that ‘interferes with rights implicit in the\n       concept of ordered liberty’; and conduct that ‘is so egregious, so\n       outrageous, that it may fairly be said to shock the contemporary\n       conscience.’ 134\n\nDeliberate framing of a person by the state offends the most strongly held\nvalues of our nation. We echo again the apt words of the First Circuit that, “if\nany concept is fundamental to our American system of justice, it is that those\ncharged with upholding the law are prohibited from deliberately fabricating\nevidence and framing individuals.” 135 As the Third Circuit has stated, “no\nsensible concept of ordered liberty is consistent with law enforcement cooking\n\n\n\n\n       132 Boyd, 579 F.3d at 514.\n       133 Doe ex rel.

The Coles clearly allege that Officer Carson conspired with others and\nintentionally lied in order to cover for his colleagues, among other things\ntelling investigators that Ryan turned and pointed his gun at the police. The\nColes further allege that Officer Carson and other officers’ lies led directly to\nthe decision to charge Ryan with aggravated assault.

In addition . . . this rule may not be circumvented by\n      claiming that a grand jury witness conspired to present false\n      testimony or by using evidence of the witness’ testimony to\n      support any other § 1983 claim concerning the initiation or\n      maintenance of a prosecution . . . In the vast majority of cases\n      involving a claim against a grand jury witness, the witness and\n      the prosecutor conducting the investigation engage in\n      preparatory activity, such as a preliminary discussion in which\n      the witness relates the substance of his intended testimony. We\n      decline to endorse a rule of absolute immunity that is so easily\n      frustrated. 158\n\nThe Court recognized that absolute immunity does not “extend[] to all\nactivity that a witness conducts outside of the grand jury room.

He\nargues that all of his alleged conduct falls into those categories, but the First\nAmended Complaint goes further. The Coles allege that Officer Carson made\nfalse statements in the course of the initial investigation into the shooting,\nbefore a decision had been made by prosecutors to charge Ryan with\naggravated assault. The FAC indicates that Carson intended these\nstatements to influence the decision to bring charges against Ryan in the first\nplace.\n         An officer who lies to investigating officers in order to try to get\nsomeone charged with a crime—before the decision to charge has been\nmade—is not entitled to absolute testimonial immunity. The Supreme Court\nhas held that a prosecutor is not entitled to absolute immunity when she\nfalsifies an affidavit supporting an arrest warrant. 160 Neither is a police\nofficer who submits an affidavit for a warrant, leading to an arrest without\nprobable cause. 161 Nor are prosecutors absolutely immune when they act\nalongside police officers to “solve” an unsolved crime by shopping for an\nunscrupulous expert. 162 Rehberg confirmed that these holdings are still good\nlaw. 163 We have likewise held that “non-testimonial pretrial actions, such as\nthe fabrication of evidence, are not within the scope of absolute immunity\n\n\n\n         159Id. at 1507 n.1 (citations omitted).\n         160Kalina v.

The Supreme Court\nand this court have emphasized that absolute immunity for prosecutors,\nwitnesses, and others is based on a need to protect central judicial\nproceedings. 165 Thus conduct that occurs during investigation to discover\nprobable cause and before the decision to charge has been made is not\ngenerally entitled to absolute immunity. 166 Some of the false statements in\nthis case are alleged to have been this investigation-stage type of conduct.\n       In these circumstances, lying to investigating officers is similar to\n\n\n       164    Castellano, 352 F.3d at 958 & n.107 (citing Buckley, 509 U.S. at 275-76, and\nSpurlock v.
