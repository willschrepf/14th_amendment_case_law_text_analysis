D0cket N0. 5:09-cv-00261-RS\nJEFFREY GLENN HUTCHINSON,\nversus\nSTATE OF FLORIDA,\nPetiti0ner - Appellant,\nResp0ndent - Appe1lee.\nAppeal from the United States District C0urt\nfor the N0rthern District of F10rida\nBef0re EDMONDSON,\nCARNES, Circuit Judge\n(April 19, 2012)\nCARNES, and BARKETT, Circuit Judges.\n\nThis is another federal habeas statute of limitations case, involving another\nequitable tolling issue. See generally 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d); Holland v. Florida,\nU.S. _, 130 S.Ct. 2549 (2010). Jeffrey G. Hutchinson was convicted of four\ncounts of first degree murder for shotgunning to death his girlfriend, Renee\nFlaherty, and her three children: nine-year-old Geoffrey, seven-year-old Amanda,\nand four-year-old Logan. Hutchinson v. State, 882 So. 2d 943, 948-49 (F1a. 2004)\nabrogated by Deparvine v. State, 995 So. 2d 351 (Fla. 2008). He was sentenced to\nlife imprisonment for the murder of Renee Flaherty and to death for the murder of\neach child. I_d. at 949. His convictions and sentences were affirmed on direct\nappeal. id at 96l. After an evidentiary hearing state collateral relief was~denied,\nand that denial was affirmed by the Florida Supreme Court. Hutchinson v. State,\n17 So. 3d 696, 702-04 (F1a. 2009).\n'1`he district court dismissed Hutchinson’s 28 U.S.C. § 2254 petition for\nfederal habeas relief because it was not filed until July 24, 2009, which was three\nyears, nine months, and twenty-four days (or 1,3 93 days) after the one-year statute\nof limitations contained in § 2244(d) had run on September 30, 2005 . Hutchinson\nv. Florida, No. 5:O9-CV-261-RS, 2010 WL 383392l (N.D. Fla. Sept. 28, 2010).\nThis is Hutchinson’s appeal from that dismissa1.\n2\n\nUnder § 2244(d)(1)(A) the one-year period for filing a federal habeas\npetition starts rtmning on the date \"on which the [state court] judgment became\nfinal by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking\nsuch review.\" But § 2244(d)(2) provides that \"[t]he time during which a properly\nfiled application for State post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to\nthe pertinent judgment or claim is pending shall not be counted.\" In order for that\n§ 2244(d)(2) statutory tolling to apply, the petitioner must file his state collateral\npetition before the one-year period for filing his federal habeas petition has run.\nMcCloud v. Hooks, 560 F.3d l223, 1227 (l 1th Cir. 2009); Alexander v. Sec’y,\nDep’t of Corr., 523 F.3d 1291, 1294 (1 1th Cir. 2008) abrogated on other grounds\nby Wall v. Kholi, U.S. g, 131 S.Ct. 1278 (201l); see also Hunter v. Ferrell,\n587 F.3d 1304, 1308 n.3 (l lth Cir. 2009). Hutchinson’s state collateral petition\nwas not filed until October 20, 2005, which was twenty days after the entire one-\nyear period for filing the federal petition had run on September 30, 2005, and as a\nresult none of the limitations period for filing his federal petition was left to be\ntolled. From that point on Hutchinson’s hopes for relief were riding all or nothing\non his state collateral petition, and the result came up nothing when the Florida\nSupreme Court affirmed the denial of collateral relief §§ Hutchinson, 17 So. 3d\nat 702-04.\n3\n\nHutchinson recognizes both that his federal habeas petition should have\nbeen filed by September 30, 2005, and that because his state collateral petition was\nnot filed until October 20, 2005, he cannot claim statutory tolling under §\n2244(d)(2) for any of the time that his state collateral proceeding was ongoing.\nHis sole contention is that he is entitled to equitable tolling. See generally\n , 130 S.Ct. 2549. Equitable tolling is, Well, equitable in nature, and\ndecisions regarding it must be made-\"on a case-by-case basis\" in light of \"specific\ncircumstances, often hard to predict in advance,\" although we \"can and do draw\nupon decisions made in other similar cases for guidance.\" I_d. at 2563 (quotation\nmarks omitted). We tum now to the specific facts and circumstances of this case\nas well as to the decisions in similar cases for guidance.\nThe parties agree that the problem in this case arose because the attorneys\nwho filed Hutchinson’s state collateral petition misunderstood the date on which\nthe limitations period began to run at the end of the direct appeal process and, as a\nresult, they miscalculated the filing deadline. Because no petition for writ of\ncertiorari was filed in the United States Supreme Court as part of the direct appeal,\nthe time for filing the federal habeas petition started running upon \"the expiration\nof the time for seeking such review.\" 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(1)(A). Hutchinson’s\nattorneys understood that, but they misunderstood when the time for seeking\n4\n\ncertiorari review of a state court’s judgment expired. They thought that the time\nfor doing so expired ninety days after the Florida Supreme Court issued its\nmandate on July 22, 2004. gee App. A 11 2. Instead, the time actually expired\nninety days after the issuance of the Florida Supreme Court’s judgment (the\nopinion was the judgment), which had happened twenty-one days earlier on July 1,\n2004. § Sup. Ct. R. l3.3 (\"The time to file a petition for a writ of certiorari runs\nfrom the date of entry of the judgment or order sought to be reviewed, and not\nfrom the issuance date of the mandate (or its equivalent under local practice).\").\nAs a result of that misunderstanding Hutchinson’s attorneys miscalculated\nthe deadline by which they were required to file either Hutchinson’s federal\nhabeas petition or file his state collateral petition in time to statutorily toll the\nfederal limitations period. They believed that they had until October 20, 2005,\ninstead of September 30, 2005, which was the actual deadline.' Because they filed\nHutchinson’s state collateral petition on October 20, 2005, the § 2244(d)(2) tolling\nprovision did not kick in and when Hutchinson finally filed his federal habeas\npetition on July 24, 2009, it was three-and-three-quarters years too late.\n'By our calculations, the actual deadline should have been September 29, 2005, because\nthat is one year after September 29, 2004, the date on which the judgment of the state court\nbecame final under § 2244(d)(1)(A). For some reason, the district court said and the parties say\nthat the deadline was September 30, 2005, Because the difference makes no difference we will\nuse the September 30, 2005 date, too.\n5\n\nA petitioner has the burden of establishing his right_if \"right\" is not too\nstrong a word in the area of equity_to equitable tolling. He must plead or proffer\nenough facts that, if true, would justify an evidentiary hearing on the issue.\nChavez v. Sec’y, Fla. Dep’t of Corr., 647 F.3d l057, 1060 (11th Cir. 2011). And\nthe allegations supporting equitable tolling must be specific and not conclusory.\nI_d. at 106l. The Supreme Cotu't did say in id that although equitable relief\nis flexible and all the facts and circLunstances must be considered, we should\n\"draw upon decisions made in other similar cases for guidance.\"  , 130\nS.Ct. at 25 63. We take that statement to mean this is not an area free of rules of\nlaw, govemed entirely by the chancellor’s foot, but we are instead bound by\nprecedent to the extent that there is precedent.2\n2And it is a good thing that rules of precedent apply here. Even Blackstone, who was\nsomething of a fan of equity, warned that:\n[T]he liberty of considering all cases in an equitable light, must not be indulged too far;\nlest thereby we destroy all law, and leave the decision of every question entirely in the\nbreast of the judge. And law, without equity, though hard and disagreeable, is much more\ndesirable for the public good, than equity without law: which would make every judge a\nlegislator, and introduce most infinite confusion; as there would then be almost as many\ndifferent rules of action laid down in our courts, as there are differences of capacity and\nsentiment in the human mind.\n1 William Blackstone, Commentaries *62; see also 1 Joseph Story, Commentaries on Eguity\nJurisprudence § 19, at 16 (l3th ed. 1886) (\"If indeed, a Court of Equity in England did possess\nthe unbounded jurisdiction which has been thus generally ascribed to it . . . it would be the most\ngigantic in its sway, and the most formidable instrument of arbitrary poWer, that could well be\ndevised.\").\n6\n\nBinding precedent has laid down two requirements that a federal habeas\npetitioner must meet before a court can grant him equitable tolling of the §\n2244(d) statute of limitations. In the Supreme Court’s words: \"[A] petitioner is\nentitled to equitable tolling only if he shows (l) that he has been pursuing his\nrights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way.\"\n , 130 S.Ct. at 2562 (quotation marks omitted); Lawrence v. Florida, 549\nU.S. 327, 336, 127 S.Ct. 1079, 1085 (2007); Well, 647 F.3d at l066,\nl068. The Supreme Court has also instructed us that \"a garden variety claim of\nexcusable neglect such as a simple miscalculation that leads a lawyer to miss a\nfiling deadline does not warrant equitable tolling.\"  , 130 S.Ct. at 2564\n(citation and quotation marks omitted); Lawrence, 549 U.S. at 336-37, 127 S.Ct.\nat 1085 (\"Attorney miscalculation is simply not sufficient to warrant equitable\ntolling, particularly in the postconviction context where prisoners have no\nconstitutional right to counsel.\"); g:llso Qa\\@, 647 F.3d at l066.\nThis case involves, in _1-lc_)1lLd’s language, \"a garden variety claim of\nexcusable neglect,\" arising from \"a simple miscalculation that leads a lawyer to\nmiss a filing deadline.\" §  , 130 S.Ct. at 2564 (quotation marks omitted).\nThe attorneys who filed the state collateral petition for Hutchinson misunderstood\n7\n\nwhat § 2244(d)(1)(A)’s \"expiration of the time for seeking such review\" meant\nwhen read against Supreme Court Rule 13.3. The fact that they ought to have\nknown better does notjustify equitable tolling.3 The attorneys who miscalculated\nthe deadline for filing in the Lawrence case did so because they were not aware of\nwell-settled law that should have prevented any confusion on their part. §\nLawrence, 549 U.S. at 336-37, 127 S.Ct. at 1085. Yet, the Supreme Court still\nheld that equitable tolling was not justified in that case because \"[a]ttomey\nmiscalculation is simply not sufficient to warrant equitable tolling.\" Lr.L at 336,\n127 S.Ct. at 1085. If attomey miscalculation, error, or negligence were enough for\nequitable tolling, the § 2244(d) statute of limitations would be tolled to the brink\nof extinction because in practically every case where there is a failure to meet the\n3Any implicit criticism by us of Hutchinson’s attorneys for their mistake is tempered by\nawareness that a panel of this Court made exactly the same mistake a year-and-a-half before\nthose two attomeys did. The opinion in Diaz v. Secretary for the Department of Corrections, 362\nF.3d 698 (1 1th Cir. 2004), states that \"[t]he 90-day period in which Diaz could have filed a\npetition in the United States Supreme Co1n't expired on June 19, l997, at which time the clock\nbegan to run on the one-year limitation for the filing of habeas petitions.\" § at 699. The\nopinion in that case shows, however, that June l9, 1997 was 90 days after the state appellate\ncourt’s mandate had issued and not 90 days after its opinion had issued, which was 16 days\nearlier. § § We do not know if the 1 opinion confused Hutchinson’s counsel or if they\nwere even aware of it. What we do know is that no one is perfect; we all make mistakes\n8\n\nfiling deadline an attorney is at fault. § Chavez, 647 F.3d at 1071 (\"In virtually\nevery case where the issue of equitable tolling comes up one or more attorneys\nshould have acted with more dispatch, but more than that is required.\").\nHutchinson argues that more is involved here than simple attomey error or\nmiscalculation, The \"more\" that he contends is involved is set out in the affidavit\nthat he filed in the district court in response to the motion to dismiss his federal\nhabeas petition as untimely. (That affidavit is reproduced in full as Appendix A to\nthis opinion.) In his affidavit, Hutchinson states that he repeatedly expressed to\nthe two attorneys who were representing him his concern about the statute of\nlimitations, and on September 22, 2005 he told them \"point blank and in no\nuncertain terms to ‘either file my rule 3.85l motion immediately or 1 will\ndischarge you and file it myself.\"’ App. A 11 15. On that occasion, Hutchinson\nrecounts, both attomeys promised him that they \"would file the motion on or §\nbefore September 28, 2005, though they went on to say that we had 90 days after\nthe mandate was issued by the Florida Supreme Court, so the rule 3.85l motion\nwas not actually due until ‘October 20th.\"’ id According to Hutchinson, he again\ntold his two attorneys that if they did not file the Rule 3.85l motion \"immediately\"\nhe would file it himself because he knew that was \"the only way [he] could\nprevent the one-year limitations period from expiring on [his] 2254 petition.\" I_cl.\n9\n\nThe attorneys \"guaranteed\" him that they would file the state court motion \"no\nlater than September 28, 2005.\" I_d. But they did not do that. Instead, they filed\nthe state court motion on October 20, 2005.\"\nHutchinson alleges that but for his attomeys’ promise to file by September\n28, 2005 he \"would have discharged them and filed a pro se rule 3.85l motion to\nprevent 28 U.S.C. § 225 5(d)(l)’s [sic] one-year limitations period from expiring.\"\nApp. A 11 16. He attached to his affidavit \"facsimiles of the Notice of Pro Se\nStatus and Rule 3.85l Motion that [he] would have filed on September 23, 2005,\nbut for [the attomeys’] promise.\" Ld. Those two facsimiles are each dated\nSeptember 23, 2005 and signed by Hutchinson, indicating that he was ready,\nwilling, and able to file his motion to proceed go § and his Rule 3.85l motion\non or soon after that date and would have done so but for his attorneys’ promises,\n4In his affidavit Hutchinson states that before the statute of limitations ran he met with\nattomey Brody three times, App. A 1111 7, 10, l2, with attomey Hazen four times, i_d_. 1111 6, 8, 11,\n13, and with both of them on two other occasions, ic_l_. 1111 l4, l5. He states that dining one of his\nmeetings with Brody alone, more than five months before the limitations period ran, Brody was\n\"visibly disoriented and smelled strongly of alcohol,\" § 11 l2, and during another meeting two-\nand-a-half months before the limitations period ran Brody was \"sweating profusely and smelled\nof alcohol,\" § 11 l4. Hutchinson also says that on that later occasion Hazen told him that Brody\nwas \"just having a lot of personal problems.\" § But there is no allegation that Brody’s\nimpairrnent, if any, caused the error in miscalculating the due date. § Chavez, 647 F.3d at\n1071 (holding that equitable tolling was not appropriate where \"[t]here are . . . no allegations at\nall that [state post-conviction counsel’s] health had affected his ability to handle the case up to\nthe time he withdrew or that it had prevented him from filing the motion for state post-conviction\nrelief sooner\"). Nor has Hutchinson alleged that attomey Hazen, who actually signed and filed\nthe Rule 3.85l motion in state coLu't on October 20, 2005, was ever impaired in any way.\n10\n\nwhich were not kept.5\nHutchinson knew, at least by October l9, 2005, that his attorneys had not\nfiled his state Rule 3.85l motion by the September 30, 2005 deadline (or the\nSeptember 28, 2005 deadline, as he had calculated it). We know that Hutchinson\nknew that because October l9, 2005 is the date Hutchinson signed, under penalty\nof perjury, the verification on the Rule 3.85l motion (which one of the attorneys\nfiled in state court the next day).° Just twenty-seven days earlier he had told his\ntwo attorneys that filing the Rule 3.85l motion in state court by September 28,\n2005 was necessary to prevent the federal filing deadline from expiring. §§ App.\n5Hutchinson’s affidavit also states that on three occasions, the last of which was July 14,\n2005, he asked his attorneys to file a \"shell-brief\" in state court in order to prevent the time from\nrtu1ning while they investigated his case and prepared the real motion for state collateral relief\nApp. A 1111 ll, l3, l4. But attomey Hazen told him then that a state court \"shell brief didn’t\nprovide the protection that it used to.\" Ld. 11 ll. lt appears that Hazen was correct about that.\nThe respondent’s brief in this case informs us that in 2001 Florida’s Rule 3.85 1 was amended to\nprohibit the filing of shell motions, g Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.851(e)(1)(D), Gonzalez v. State, 990\nSo. 2d l0l7, 1034 & n.9 (Fla. 2008), and that shell motions are stricken by the Florida co1u'ts and\nno longer can be used to meet filing deadlines. In his reply brief, Hutchinson does not take issue\nwith any of that information.\n°Although Hutchinson’s affidavit and the date of his signature on the federal habeas\npetition establish beyond dispute that he knew his attorneys had missed the deadline for filing his\nstate petition, our separately writing colleague asserts that Hutchinson had no reason to file his\nfederal habeas petition until nearly four years later because he relied on his attomeys’ assurances\nthat they were doing what was necessary to protect his federal habeas rights. § Concurring Op.\nat 25-26. That assertion is belied by Hutchinson’s own sworn statements, which establish that\nhe knew his attomeys had missed the deadline, yet for years after realizing that he still made no\nattempt to file in federal co1u't the collateral petition he had already drafted. However judges may\nfeel about the law applicable to this or any other area, we have no license to rewrite the facts of a\ncase.\nll\n\nA 1[ 15. And Hutchinson had already drafted, dated, and had ready to file a\ncomplete petition setting out all of the claims that he wanted to raise. I_c1_. 111\n15-l6. By simply changing the name of the court in which that petition was to be\nfiled, Hutchinson himself could have filed his federal habeas petition on or soon\nafter October 20, 2005, which would have been just twenty days after the\nexpiration of the one-year limitations period.7\nYet Hutchinson did nothing of the sort for nearly four years. He did not file\nhis jig § habeas petition in federal court until July 24, 2009, which was long after\nthe state trial court had denied his Rule 3.85l motion on January 3, 2008, and was\nalso after the Florida Supreme Court had affirmed that denial on July 9, 2009.\n7Had Hutchinson done so, the federal district court could have held his federal habeas\npetition in abeyance until his efforts to secure state collateral relief were completed. § Rhines\nv. Weber, 544 U.S. 269, 278-79, 125 S.Ct. l528, 1535 (2005). Our colleague’s suggestion that a\ndistrict court might dismiss such a petition without abusing its discretion is contradicted by the\nonly authority she cites for that proposition, which is the Rhines decision. § Concurring Op. at\n26 n.2l. The Supreme Court stated in Rhines that:\n[I]t likely would be an abuse of discretion for a district court to deny a stay and to\ndismiss a mixed petition if the petitioner had good cause for his failure to exhaust,\nhis unexhausted claims are potentially meritorious, and there is no indication that\nthe petitioner engaged in intentionally dilatory litigation tactics. ln such\ncircumstances, the district co1u't should stay, rather than dismiss, the mixed\npetition § Ltmdy, 455 U.S., at 522, 102 S.Ct. 1198 (the total exhaustion\nrequirement was not intended to \"unreasonably impair the prisoner’s right to\nrelief’). ln such a case, the petitioner’s interest in obtaining federal review of his\nclaims outweighs the competing interests in finality and speedy resolution of\nfederal petitions.\nRhines, 544 U.S. at 278, 125 S.Ct. at l535.\n12\n\nMore to the point, Hutchinson waited to file his federal petition for three years,\nnine months and five days-a total of l,3 74 days_after he learned on October l9,\n2005 that his attomeys had missed the deadline for a filing in state court that\nwould have tolled the federal limitations period. There is nothing in Hutchinson’s\naffidavit or in his briefs to explain his delay of nearly four years. Nothing.\nWe need not decide whether Hutchinson has established that an\nextraordinary circumstance stood in the way of his meeting the § 2244(d) filing\ndeadline, because he has not carried his burden of showing that he pursued his\nrights diligently. §  , 130 S.Ct. at 2562; Lawrence, 549 U.S. at 336, 127\nS.Ct. at 1085; se_ealL 1 647 F.3d at l066, l068. Although Hutchinson’s\naffidavit may show that he diligently attempted to have his state collateral motion\nfiled in time to give him the benefit of § 2244(d) statutory tolling, it does not show\nthat once that opportunity was missed he pursued his federal rights diligently.\nInstead, his affidavit and the other materials he has submitted show that he had in\nhand a petition that he could have re-labeled and filed ry § in federal court\nwithin three weeks after the one-year limitations period ran, but he waited three-\nand-three-quarter years before he filed a § § federal habeas petition. That is not\nreasonable diligence\nHutchinson’s lengthy delay in filing his go se federal habeas petition stands\n13\n\nin stark contrast to the petitioner’s diligence in the §§ case, The Supreme\nCourt stressed that \"the very day that Holland discovered that his AEDPA clock\nhad expired due to [his attomey’s] failings, Holland prepared his own habeas\npetition § § and promptly filed it with the District Court.\"  , 130 S.Ct. at\n2565 (emphasis in original). Holland’s filing of his federal habeas petition the day\nafter he leamed that \"his AEDPA clock had'expired due to [his attorney’s]\nfailings\" may be \"maximum feasible diligence,\" §, which is not required.\nBut Hutchinson’s failure to do anything to get his federal habeas petition filed for\nnearly four years after he learned that the AEDPA clock had run out due to his\nattomeys’ miscalculation is not even \"reasonable diligence,\" which is required, §\nThe district court did not err in concluding that Hutchinson was not entitled\nto equitable tolling of l,393 days.\nAFFIRMED.\nl 4\n\nBARKETT, Circuit Judge, concurring in the result only:\nInitially, 1 disagree with the majority’s holding that Hutchinson was not\nreasonably diligent in pursuing his claims. He did everything any reasonable\nclient would do to assure that his lawyers protected his interests, including\nimploring his lawyers to file his post-conviction pleadings in a timely marmer.\nThe majority’s suggestion that Hutchinson should have filed a placeholder pro se\nhabeas petition is simply not logical when Hutchinson was represented by lawyers\nwho were assuring him that his claims were being pursued.\nHowever, no matter how diligent Hutchinson was or could have been, as the\nlaw stands today, this Court still could not grant Hutchinson the relief of equitable\ntolling because the Supreme Court has held that, notwithstanding his diligence, a\ndefendant is responsible for and must bear the consequences of his lawyer’s\nnegligence.' §ge Lawrence, 549 U.S. at 336-37; Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S.\n722, 753-54 (l991); see also Martinez v. Ryan, 566 U.S. 1 , 1 (20l2) (slip\nop., at 7); Holland, 130 S. Ct. at 2563.\nThe holdings of Lawrence and Coleman are premised on the continued\n' In order to merit equitable tolling, a petitioner must establish \"(1) that he has been\npursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way.\"\nHolland v. Florida, 560 U.S. § _,130 S. Ct. 2549, 2562 (2010) (intemal quotation marks\nomitted). A lawyer’s negligence does not constitute an \"extraordinary circLunstance.\" See id. at\n2564 (citing Lawrence v. Florida, 549 U.S. 327, 336 (2007)). Here, where Hutchinson’s lawyers\nnegligently filed his state post-conviction petition too late to statutorily toll the federal habeas\nfiling deadline, their negligence does not constitute an \"extraordinary circi.unstance.\"\n\napplication to death row imnates of the agency theory of the lawyer-client\nrelationship. See, e.g,, Maples v. Thomas, 565 U.S. _, __, 132 S. Ct. 912, 922\n(2012) (explaining that Coleman’s holding was based on \"well-settled principles\nof agency law\" that \"the principal bears the risk of negligent conduct on the part of\nhis agent.\"). However, as amplified below, none of the key assumptions\nunderlying the application of an agency relationship to a death-sentenced client\nand his lawyer are valid in the post-conviction context.2 When the law already\nrecognizes equitable exceptions to holding a client responsible for his lawyer’s\nactions under circumstances with less drastic consequences, an exception should\nalso be made for death row imnates so that their lawyer’s negligence does not\npreclude federal review of constitutional claims.\nI. Agency Principles and Death Row Inmates\nAn agency relationship exists to permit one person to act on behalf of\nanother.3 Generally the principal chooses an agent to act on his behalf for a\n2 § Adam Liptak, Foreword, Agency and Equity: Why do we blame clients for their\nlaLryers’ mistakes?, 110 Mich. L. R. 875, 875 (2012) (stating that \"clients and lawyers fit the\nagency model imperfectly. Agency law is built on the concepts of free choice, consent, and\nloyalty, and it is not unusual to find lawyer-client relationships in which some or all of these\nelements are missing.\").\n3 § 1 Floyd R. Mechem Treatise on the Law of Agency § 80 (2d ed. 1914) (\"It is the\ngeneral rule that an agency may be created for the performance of any lawful act, and that\nwhatever a person may lawfully do, if acting in his own right and in his own behalf, he may\nlawfully delegate to an agent.\"). ~\n16\n\nspecific purpose,4 and in a traditional lawyer-client relationship, a client hires a\nlawyer to represent him in a discrete legal matter. The legitimacy of transferring\nresponsibility for the lawyer’s negligence from the lawyer to the client is based on\nseveral assumptions that underpin the agency relationship. First, it is assumed that\nthe client voluntarily chooses his lawyer for competence, diligence, and loyalty.5\n~\nSecond, it is assumed that the client has the ability to direct the actions of the\nlawyer° or, at the very least, that constant and adequate opportunities exist for\ncommunication between the client and his lawyer.7 1\nBut these assumptions do not apply to inmates on death row, almost all of\nwhom do not choose their lawyers. Instead they must depend on appointed or pro\nbono volunteer counsel who too often lack expertise in post-conviction death\npenalty representation. See, e.g., @pl_es, 132 S. Ct. at 918.

In Alabama, death row inmates’ phone calls are limited to twenty-five\nminutes, with prison officials determining the schedule and frequency of phone\nconversations.'2 According to Georgia’s inmate orientation handbook, phone calls\nin Georgia prisons are limited to fifteen minutes.’3\nMoreover, if a death row inmate is held in a super-maximum security prison\nor a segregation housing unit (\"SHU\"), which most are, these barriers may be even\nmore difficult to overcome. First, access to basic reading and writing materials\nmay be entirely restricted, depending on how much of a security threat the inmate\nis deemed to be. See, egg Beard v. Banks, 548 U.S. 521 (2006) (upholding prison\nregulation that denies access to written material to violent imnates).

A prisoner does not have a right to file pro se\npleadings while represented by counsel. See United States v. Gwiazdzinski, 141\nF.3d 784, 787 (7th Cir. l998). Courts routinely decline to consider pro se\npleadings when an inmate is represented by counsel. See Downs v.

An inmate’s inability to supervise and control the\nactions of his lawyer makes this relationship far more akin to the paradigm of an\nindependent contractor than a traditional agency relationship.‘9 The negligent acts\nof an independent contractor, unlike those of an agent, are not imputed to the\nemployer for the very reason that the employer lacks the power to meaningfully\nsupervise the contractor.\nThe reality of the quality of post-conviction death penalty representation\navailable to indigent inmates on death row does not meet the Supreme Court’s\nrecognition that Congress intended these imnates to have access to \"quality legal\nrepresentation\" when it mandated the statutory right to counsel. McFarland 512\nU.S. at 856, 859 (\"[F]ederal habeas corpus has a particularly important role to play\nin promoting fundamental fairness in the imposition of the death penalty.\"); g\na_ls.o 18 U.S.C. § 3599(a)(2), (d) (2006) (recodification of 21 U.S.C. §§ 848(q)(4)-\n(10) (l988)).

Page Keeton et al., Prosser and Keeton on Torts § 71 (5th ed. l984).\n24\n\nfederal habeas petition, McFarland, 512 U.S. at 855.\nThe circumstances surrounding Hutchinson’s lawyers’ negligent filing of\nhis state post-conviction motion in this case illustrate the difficulties faced by a\ndeath row inmate who attempts to work diligently with his lawyers. While on\ndeath row, Hutchinson maintained communication_to the best of his\nability_with his lawyers and repeatedly asked them to timely file his state post-\nconviction motion so as to toll the filing deadline for his federal habeas petition.2°\nEven the majority recognizes that Hutchinson was reasonably diligent up to the\ntime that his lawyers filed his motion for state post-conviction relief What other\nsteps could Hutchinson reasonably have taken? Should he not have trusted his\nlawyers when they assured him they were aware of and would comply with all\nfiling deadlines? There is certainly no expectation that a civil client will shadow\nhis lawyer’s every move to ensure that all deadlines are met and all filings are in\norder. On the contrary, a represented client has every right to assume that his\nlawyer will competently discharge his duties.\nNonetheless, the majority concludes that Hutchinson was not reasonably\n2° The fact that Hutchinson signed the Rule 3.85l motion on October l9, 2005 does not\nestablish beyond dispute that he knew that his attorneys had missed the deadline for filing his\nstate petition. Although Hutchinson kept asking his lawyers to file his state petition, there is\nnothing to indicate that he knew the precise deadline. lt is equally consistent with the facts to\nbelieve that he simply wanted his state petition filed and later accepted his attorneys’ advice that\nthe deadline was October 20, 2005.\n25\n\ndiligent because he should have filed a pro se federal habeas petition and asked to\nhave it held in abeyance until his efforts to secure state collateral relief were\ncompleted. This course of action surely cannot be required of a client when he has\nlegal representation.2' A reasonable prisoner would have no cause to file\nhis own pleadings for the simple reason that it is assumed that it is his lawyer’s job\nto do so. Especially here, where Hutchinson’s lawyers repeatedly assured him that\nthey would file on time, Hutchinson had no reason to pursue an altemative avenue\nof relief. Reasonably relying on his lawyers’ assurances that they were doing what\nwas necessary to protect his federal habeas rights, Hutchinson did not file a pro se\nfederal habeas petition until it was too late.\n2' Indeed, there is no guarantee that such a placeholder petition would be accepted by the\nfederal district court § Rhines v. Weber, 544 U.S. 269, 277 (2005) (\"[S]tay and abeyance\nshould be available only in limited circumstances . . . and is only appropriate when the district\ncourt determines there was good cause for the petitioner’s failure to present his claims first to the\nstate courts.\"). In a concurring opinion with the judgment in Rhines, Justice Stevens, with whom\nJustices Ginsburg and Breyer joined, observed that conditioning the stay-and-abeyance procedure\non \"good cause\" instead of simply on a lack of \"intentionally dilatory litigation tactics\" left open\nthe door for \"[t]he trickiness of some exhaustion requirements to infect issues of good cause . . .\n.\" §§ at 279. Moreover, Rhines concemed an issue distinct from the case at hand in which some\nhabeas corpus claims had been exhausted in state court and others had not. The stay-and-\nabeyance procedure was endorsed in limited circrunstances in order to preserve the petitioner’s\ninterest in obtaining review of his claims. § at 278, In contrast, the good cause inquiry in this\ncase would have involved issues of attomey negligence. In addition, Hutchinson’s ability to\nattempt to prevail upon the stay-and-abeyance procedure turned on both his access to information\nabout the procedure, and a presumption that he did not believe his attomeys’ advice that the\nfiling deadline for his application for state post-conviction relief in order to preserve his federal\nhabeas corpus right was on October 20, 2005. Under these circtunstances, it is far from certain\nthat Hutchinson would have been granted stay-and-abeyance by a district court applying the good\ncause standard and unlikely that a panel of this Court would have reversed a district court denial\nthereof on an abuse of discretion review.\n26\n\nII. Exceptions to Client Responsibility for Lawyer’s Conduct\nDeath row inmates should not be precluded from having their federal claims\nreviewed because of their lawyer’s negligence Exceptions to the principle that all\nclients are responsible for the negligence of their lawyers exist elsewhere in the\nlaw. For example, when more important countervailing values are at stake,\nvarious rules of civil procedure provide courts with discretion to excuse\nprocedural defaults in cases of lawyer negligence. See, egg Dove v. CODESCO,\n569 F.2d 807, 810 (4th Cir. 1978) (\"[T]he sanctions for attorney neglect should be\nborne if at all possible by the attomey himself rather than by his client.\"); Jackson\nv. Washington Monthly Co., 569 F.2d ll9, 123, n.23 (D.C. Cir. 1977) (\"[A] sound\ndiscretion hardly comprehends a pointless exaction of retribution. Dismissals for\nmisconduct attributable to lawyers, and in no [way] to their clients, invariably\npenalize the innocent and may let the guilty off scot-f`ree.\").\nRule 60(b)(1), for example, provides relief from a final judgment for\nexcusable neglect, which can \"encompass situations in which the failure to comply\nwith a filing deadline is attributable to negligence.\" United States v. Davenport,\n668 F.3d 1316, 1324 (11th Cir. 20l2). Similarly, Rule 55(c) has been applied to\ngive a client relief from the entry of a default that was caused by the negligence of\nan attomey under the \"good cause standard.\" Shepard Claims Serv., Inc. v.\n27\n\nWilliam Darrah & Assocs., 796 F.2d l90, 195 (6th Cir. l986). Exceptions such as\nthose available under Rules 55(c) and 60(b) exist because, unlike a pure\nprincipal-agent relationship, most clients are not able to exercise perfect control\nover their lawyers. §\nLikewise, under Rule 1 1, the agency principle is put aside in order for\ncourts to direct sanctions toward lawyers_and not their clients_when clients are\nnot implicated in or aware of the offending attorney error, bad faith, or negligence\nthat fall within a lawyer’s professional zone of control, Under Rule 1 1,\n\"[s]anctionable conduct by a party’s counsel does not necessarily parlay into\nsanctionable conduct by a party.\" Byrne v. Nezhat, 261 F.3d 1_075, 1123 (l 1th\nCir. 2001) (citation omitted). .\nAnd under Rule 37, a district court has broad discretion to apportion\nsanctions for discovery abuses between lawyers and their clients. Devany v.\nCont’l Am. Ins. Co., 989 F.2d ll54, 1162 (11th Cir. l993). For example, Rule 37\nis not construed to authorize the sanction of dismissal \"because of petitioner’s\nnoncompliance with a pretrial production order when it has been established that\nfailure to comply has been due to inability, and not to willfi1lness, bad faith, or any\nfault of petitioner.\" Societe Intemationale pour Participations Industrielles et\nCommerciales, S.A. v. Rogers, 357 U.S. 197, 212 (1958). This Court has held that\n28\n\n\"[a] party’s simple negligence or other action grounded in a misunderstanding of a\ncourt order does not warrant dismissal.\" Equal Employment Opportunity\nComm’n, 693 F.2d l353, 1357 (l1th Cir. 1982). See also Malautea v. Suzuki\n987 F.2d 1536, 1542 (1 uh Cir. 1993) (stating that “[v]i<»1arr0n of\nMotor Co Ltd\na discovery order caused by simple negligence, misunderstanding, or inability to\ncomply will not justify a Rule 37 default judgment or dismissal.\").\nMaking death row imnates wholly responsible for a lawyer’s negligence\ndoes not ensure that lawyers will timely assert their clients’ claims, Death row\nclients have little ability to hold their lawyers accountable for their negligence.\nAnd a policy of punishing death row imnates for such mistakes does not improve\nthe timeliness of lawyers’ actions. While civil litigants can seek relief for a\nlawyer’s mistake through a malpractice lawsuit, there is no remedy for a death row\ninmate. When a lawyer’s negligence forecloses consideration of the entirety of the\ndeath row imnate’s federal claims, the result is the imposition of the death penalty\nwithout federal review.\nThese cases and examples illustrate that countervailing values forge\nexceptions in the law. The countervailing value here is the protection of the right\nto federal review of a death row inmate’s federal habeas petition, which is\npremised, in part, on \"equitable principles [which] have traditionally governed the\n29\n\nsubstantive law of habeas corpus.\"  ~ 130 S. Ct. at 2560 (quotation marks\nomitted) (holding that the one-year statutory filing deadline for federal habeas\npetitions is subject to equitable tolling). Thus, in  , which presented the\nsame question as is presented here, the Supreme Court framed the inquiry as one\nof how equity applies while still acknowledging the federal statutory filing\ndeadline, SLezi_<L at 2563. The Court noted that the countervailing value of\nfederalism weighs more heavily in the case of failing to comply with a 13\nprocedural rules than it does for equitable tolling of the 111 habeas filing\ndeadline which is concerned only \"with mg timing rules.\" I_d. With these\nconsiderations in mind, the Court rejected a 13re_rs_e approach to the previously\nunqualified rule that \"a petitioner must bear the risk of attomey error\" in the n\ncontext of _I  case, I_d.22\nMore recently in WB§, 132 S. Ct. at 924, the Court held that a lawyer’s\nconduct that constitutes abandonment of his death row imnate client will also\nprovide the necessary basis for equitable tolling of the federal habeas filing\ndeadline. The Court reached this conclusion, in part, because even agency\n22 The crucial importance of the broader availability of equitable tolling is highlighted by\nthe subsequent developments in Holland’s case. Upon eventual remand to the district court,\nwhich granted Holland equitable tolling and then considered the merits of the constitutional\nclaims raised in Holland’s federal habeas petition, the coLu't granted him habeas relief on his\nFaretta v. Califomia, 422 U.S. 806 (l975) claim. Hollarrd v. Tucker, No. 06-civ-20182 (S.D. Fla\nMarch 30, 2012) (order granting in part petition for habeas corpus).\n30\n\nprinciples acknowledge an exception to the assumption that a client must bear the\nrisk of the acts or omissions of his lawyer in the case of abandomnent. I_cl.\nHowever, to grant equitable tolling only in cases of complete lawyer\nabandonment or something akin to gross negligence does not go far enough. §\nHolland, 130 S. Ct. at 2567 (Alito, J., concurring in the judgment) (\"Allowing\nequitable tolling in cases involving gross rather than ordinary attorney negligence\nwould not only fail to make sense in light of our prior cases; it would also be\nimpractical in the extreme. . . . [I]t has been aptly said that gross negligence is\nordinary negligence with a vituperative epithet added.\"). Where is the equity in\ndenying the same relief to one inmate just because the acts or omissions of his -\nlawyer were slightly less egregious than another imnate’s lawyer? Instead, the\nreality is that death row inmates’ access to competent, post-conviction legal\nrepresentation is at best inconsistent and at worst non-existent and their ability to\ncommunicate freely and actively participate in their litigation is seriously\ncompromised. Under this reality, 1 question whether strict adherence to the\nprinciple that a death row inmate must bear the consequences of his lawyer’s\nnegligence is fair or just.\n31\n\nCase 5:09-cv-O0261-RS Document 36-1 Fi|ed 06/15/10 Page 1 of 82\nlN THE UNlTED STATES DlSTRlCT COURT\nFOR THE NORTl'lERN DlSTRlCT OF FLORlDA\nPENSACOLA DlVISlON\nJEFFREY GLENN HUTCHlNSON,\nPetitioner.\nCase No.:  \" ¢\\I‘  ` \nv.

This made me so happy that l began to cry.\nlt was tire first time that l had a lawyer that l thought would stand up for me. l truly\nbelieved Mr. Brody would help to exonerate me.\n8. On October 20, 2004, l had another meeting with Mr. Hazen, and during that\nmeeting l asked him if he or Mr. Brody had contacted any of the witnesses that would\nneed to be present at the evidentiary hearing He told me, “No,\" but not to worry about\nthat because “we'll have plenty of time for that later on. (His words as l recall them.)\n9. On November 4, 2004, 1 talked to Mr. Brody during a prearranged phone call,\nand during that conversation l expressed my ooncems regarding the running of 28\nU.S.C. § 2244 (d)(1)’s one-year limitations period and the fact that they had not\n2\n\nCase 5:09-cv-OO261-RS Document 36-1 Filed O6l15/10 Page 3 of 82 -\ncontacted any of the witnesses that would need to be present at the evidentiary hearing.\nin resp0nse, Mr. Brody told me, “Don’t worry the time, we have almost a year to tile the\n3.850.\" (His words as l recall them.)\n10. 0n December10, 2004, l had another meeting with Mr. Brody, during which\nl again expressed my ooncems about the running of the one-year period of limitations\nand the fact that they still had not contacted any of the witnesses that would need to be\npresent at the evidentiary hearing.\n11. On March 23, 2005, l had another meeting with Mr. Hazen, during which l\nasked him to file a \"shell-brief\" to ensure that the one-year limitations period for filing my\n2254 petition would not expire. since they still had not contacted any of the witnesses\nthat would need to be present at the evidentiary hearing. At that point Mr. Hazen\nclaimed that “a shell-brief doesn't provide the protection that it used to\", but he assured\nme that “we still have plenty of time to get everything done.\" (His words as l recall\nthem.) _\n12. On April 14, 2005, l had another meeting with Harry Brody, during which l\nasked him pointedly about whether or not they (Mr. Brody and Mr. Hazen) could tile my\nrule 3.851 motion in time to prevent the one-year limitations period from expiring on my\n2254 petition. Mr. Brody seemed visibly disoriented and smelled strongly of alcoho|,\ndespite the fact that he was eating \"Altoids\" breath mints. l asked him if he had been\npartying the night before and he changed the subject saying, “Don't worry about it; we\nstill have pienty of time to tile the 3.850.\" (His words as l recall them.)\n13. 0n May 12, 2005, l had another meeting with Mr. Hazen, during which l\nagain voiced my ooncems about nothing being done regarding the witnesses, and again\n' 3\n\nCase 5:09-cv-00261-RS Document 36-1 Filed O6l15/10 Page 4 of 82\nl asked about filing a “shell-briet\" to prevent the one-year limitations period from expiring\non my 2254 petition, since the rule 3.851 motion was still not ready to file. Mr. Hazen\nassured me that there was still \"plenty of time\" to tile the rule 3.851 motion, and that it\n\"was not due for several months.\" (His words as l recall them.)\n14, On July 14, 2005, l had a meeting with both Mr. Brody and Mr. Hazen,\nduring which l asked them directly about filing the rule 3.851 motion (which was gt not\ntinished) and why they had still not filed a \"she|l-briel\" to not only allow enough time to\ninvestigate all of the evidence and to contact all of the witnesses that would need to\ntestify at the evidentiary hearing. but also to prevent the one-year limitations period from\nexpiring on my 2254 petition. Mr. Brody, who was sweating profusely and smelled of\nalcohol, became very angry and suddenly got up and left the meeting room. l asked Mr.\nHaz‘en,\"‘What was that all about?\", and Mr. Hazen replied, \"He's just having a lot of\npersonal problems.\" (His words asi recall them.)\n15. 0n September 22, 2005, l had another meeting with both Mr. Brody and Mr.\nHazen, during which l told them point blank and in no uncertain tem1s to “either file my\nrule 3.851 motion immediately or l will discharge you and tile it myself.\" At that point Mr.\nBrody and Mr. Hazen both assured - promised - guaranteed me that they would tile the\nmotion on or before September 28, 2005, though they went on to say that we had 90\ndays after the mandate was issued by the Florida Supreme Court, so the rule 3.851\nmotion was not actually due until “0ctober 20\"‘.\" (1' heir words as l recall them.)

Florida,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 2549, 177 L.Ed.2d 130 (2010). Jeffrey G. Hutchinson was convicted of four counts of first degree murder for shotgunning to death his girlfriend, Renee Flaherty, and her three children: nine-year-old Geoffrey, seven-year-old Amanda, and four-year-old Logan. <i>Hutchinson v. State,</i> 882 So.2d 943, 948-49 (Fla.2004) <i>abrogated by </i><i>Deparvine v. State,</i> 995 So.2d 351 (Fla.2008). He was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of Renee Flaherty and to death for the murder of each child. <i>Id.</i> at 949. His convictions and sentences were affirmed on direct appeal. <i>Id.</i> at 961. After an evidentiary hearing state collateral relief was denied, and that denial was affirmed by the Florida Supreme Court. <i>Hutchinson v. State,</i> 17 So.3d 696, 702-04 (Fla. 2009).</p>\n<p>The district court dismissed Hutchinson's 28 U.S.C. § 2254 petition for federal habeas relief because it was not filed until July 24, 2009, which was three years, nine months, and twenty-four days (or 1,393 days) after the one-year statute of limitations contained in § 2244(d) had run on September 30, 2005. <i>Hutchinson v. Florida,</i> No. 5:09-CV-261-RS, 2010 WL 3833921 (N.D.Fla. Sept. 28, 2010). This is Hutchinson's appeal from that dismissal.</p>\n<p>Under § 2244(d)(1)(A) the one-year period for filing a federal habeas petition starts running on the date \"on which the [state court] judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.\" But § 2244(d)(2) provides that \"[t]he time during which a properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending shall not be counted.\" In order for that § 2244(d)(2) statutory tolling to apply, the petitioner must file his state collateral petition before the one-year period for filing his federal habeas petition has run. <i>McCloud v. Hooks,</i> 560 F.3d 1223, 1227 (11th Cir.2009); <i>Alexander v. Sec'y, Dep't of Corr.,</i> 523 F.3d 1291, 1294 (11th Cir.2008) <i>abrogated on other grounds by </i><i>Wall v. Kholi,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 131 S.Ct. 1278, 179 L.Ed.2d 252 (2011); <i>see also </i><i>Hunter v. Ferrell,</i> 587 F.3d 1304, 1308 n. 3 (11th Cir.2009). Hutchinson's state collateral petition was not filed until October 20, 2005, which was twenty days after the entire one-year period for filing the federal petition had run on September 30, 2005, and as a result none of the limitations period for filing his federal petition was left to be tolled. From that point on Hutchinson's hopes for relief were riding all or nothing on his state collateral petition, and the result came up nothing when the Florida Supreme Court affirmed the denial of collateral relief. <i>See </i><i>Hutchinson,</i> 17 So.3d at 702-04.</p>\n<p>Hutchinson recognizes both that his federal habeas petition should have been filed by September 30, 2005, and that because his state collateral petition was not filed until October 20, 2005, he cannot claim statutory tolling under § 2244(d)(2) for any of the time that his state collateral proceeding was ongoing. His sole contention is that he is entitled to equitable tolling. <i>See generally </i><i>Holland,</i> 130 S.Ct. 2549. Equitable tolling is, well, equitable in nature, and decisions regarding it must be made \"on a case-by-case basis\" in light of \"specific circumstances, often hard to predict in advance,\" although we \"can and do draw upon decisions made in other similar cases for guidance.\" <i>Id.</i> at 2563 (quotation marks omitted). We turn now to the specific facts and circumstances of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1099</span> this case as well as to the decisions in similar cases for guidance.</p>\n<p>The parties agree that the problem in this case arose because the attorneys who filed Hutchinson's state collateral petition misunderstood the date on which the limitations period began to run at the end of the direct appeal process and, as a result, they miscalculated the filing deadline. Because no petition for writ of certiorari was filed in the United States Supreme Court as part of the direct appeal, the time for filing the federal habeas petition started running upon \"the expiration of the time for seeking such review.\" 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(1)(A). Hutchinson's attorneys understood that, but they misunderstood when the time for seeking certiorari review of a state court's judgment expired. They thought that the time for doing so expired ninety days after the Florida Supreme Court issued its mandate on July 22, 2004. <i>See</i> App. A ¶ 2. Instead, the time actually expired ninety days after the issuance of the Florida Supreme Court's judgment (the opinion was the judgment), which had happened twenty-one days earlier on July 1, 2004. <i>See</i> Sup.Ct. R. 13.3 (\"The time to file a petition for a writ of certiorari runs from the date of entry of the judgment or order sought to be reviewed, and not from the issuance date of the mandate (or its equivalent under local practice).\").</p>\n<p>As a result of that misunderstanding, Hutchinson's attorneys miscalculated the deadline by which they were required to file either Hutchinson's federal habeas petition or file his state collateral petition in time to statutorily toll the federal limitations period. They believed that they had until October 20, 2005, instead of September 30, 2005, which was the actual deadline.<sup>[1]</sup> Because they filed Hutchinson's state collateral petition on October 20, 2005, the § 2244(d)(2) tolling provision did not kick in and when Hutchinson finally filed his federal habeas petition on July 24, 2009, it was three-and-three-quarters years too late.</p>\n<p>A petitioner has the burden of establishing his rightif \"right\" is not too strong a word in the area of equityto equitable tolling. He must plead or proffer enough facts that, if true, would justify an evidentiary hearing on the issue. <i>Chavez v. Sec'y, Fla. Dep't of Corr.,</i> 647 F.3d 1057, 1060 (11th Cir.2011). And the allegations supporting equitable tolling must be specific and not conclusory. <i>Id.</i> at 1061. The Supreme Court did say in <i>Holland</i> that although equitable relief is flexible and all the facts and circumstances must be considered, we should \"draw upon decisions made in other similar cases for guidance.\" <i>Holland,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 2563. We take that statement to mean this is not an area free of rules of law, governed entirely by the chancellor's foot, but we are instead bound by precedent to the extent that there is precedent.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1100</span> Binding precedent has laid down two requirements that a federal habeas petitioner must meet before a court can grant him equitable tolling of the § 2244(d) statute of limitations. In the Supreme Court's words: \"[A] petitioner is entitled to equitable tolling only if he shows (1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way.\" <i>Holland,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 2562 (quotation marks omitted); <i>Lawrence v. Florida,</i> 549 U.S. 327, 336, 127 S.Ct. 1079, 1085, 166 L.Ed.2d 924 (2007); <i>see also </i><i>Chavez,</i> 647 F.3d at 1066, 1068. The Supreme Court has also instructed us that \"a garden variety claim of excusable neglect such as a simple miscalculation that leads a lawyer to miss a filing deadline does not warrant equitable tolling.\" <i>Holland,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 2564 (citation and quotation marks omitted); <i>Lawrence,</i> 549 U.S. at 336-37, 127 S.Ct. at 1085 (\"Attorney miscalculation is simply not sufficient to warrant equitable tolling, particularly in the postconviction context where prisoners have no constitutional right to counsel.\"); <i>see also </i><i>Chavez,</i> 647 F.3d at 1066.</p>\n<p>This case involves, in <i>Holland</i>'s language, \"a garden variety claim of excusable neglect,\" arising from \"a simple miscalculation that leads a lawyer to miss a filing deadline.\" <i>See </i><i>Holland,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 2564 (quotation marks omitted). The attorneys who filed the state collateral petition for Hutchinson misunderstood what § 2244(d)(1)(A)'s \"expiration of the time for seeking such review\" meant when read against Supreme Court Rule 13.3. The fact that they ought to have known better does not justify equitable tolling.<sup>[3]</sup> The attorneys who miscalculated the deadline for filing in the <i>Lawrence</i> case did so because they were not aware of well-settled law that should have prevented any confusion on their part. <i>See </i><i>Lawrence,</i> 549 U.S. at 336-37, 127 S.Ct. at 1085. Yet, the Supreme Court still held that equitable tolling was not justified in that case because \"[a]ttorney miscalculation is simply not sufficient to warrant equitable tolling.\" <i>Id.</i> at 336, 127 S.Ct. at 1085. If attorney miscalculation, error, or negligence were enough for equitable tolling, the § 2244(d) statute of limitations would be tolled to the brink of extinction because in practically every case where there is a failure to meet the filing deadline an attorney is at fault. <i>See </i><i>Chavez,</i> 647 F.3d at 1071 (\"In virtually every case where the issue of equitable tolling comes up one or more attorneys should have acted with more dispatch, but more than that is required.\").</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1101</span> Hutchinson argues that more is involved here than simple attorney error or miscalculation. The \"more\" that he contends is involved is set out in the affidavit that he filed in the district court in response to the motion to dismiss his federal habeas petition as untimely. (That affidavit is reproduced in full as Appendix A to this opinion.) In his affidavit, Hutchinson states that he repeatedly expressed to the two attorneys who were representing him his concern about the statute of limitations, and on September 22, 2005 he told them \"point blank and in no uncertain terms to `either file my rule 3.851 motion immediately or I will discharge you and file it myself.'\" App. A ¶ 15. On that occasion, Hutchinson recounts, both attorneys promised him that they \"would file the motion on or before September 28, 2005, though they went on to say that we had 90 days after the mandate was issued by the Florida Supreme Court, so the rule 3.851 motion was not actually due until `October 20th.'\" <i>Id.</i> According to Hutchinson, he again told his two attorneys that if they did not file the Rule 3.851 motion \"<i>immediately</i>\" he would file it himself because he knew that was \"the only way [he] could prevent the one-year limitations period from expiring on [his] 2254 petition.\" <i>Id.</i> The attorneys \"guaranteed\" him that they would file the state court motion \"no later than September 28, 2005.\" <i>Id.</i> But they did not do that. Instead, they filed the state court motion on October 20, 2005.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>Hutchinson alleges that but for his attorneys' promise to file by September 28, 2005 he \"would have discharged them and filed a pro se rule 3.851 motion to prevent 28 U.S.C. § 2255(d)(1)'s [sic] one-year limitations period from expiring.\" App. A ¶ 16. He attached to his affidavit \"facsimiles of the Notice of Pro Se Status and Rule 3.851 Motion that [he] would have filed on September 23, 2005, but for [the attorneys'] promise.\" <i>Id.</i> Those two facsimiles are each dated September 23, 2005 and signed by Hutchinson, indicating that he was ready, willing, and able to file his motion to proceed <i>pro se</i> and his Rule 3.851 motion on or soon after that date and would have done so but for his attorneys' promises, which were not kept.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1102</span> Hutchinson knew, at least by October 19, 2005, that his attorneys had not filed his state Rule 3.851 motion by the September 30, 2005 deadline (or the September 28, 2005 deadline, as he had calculated it). We know that Hutchinson knew that because October 19, 2005 is the date Hutchinson signed, under penalty of perjury, the verification on the Rule 3.851 motion (which one of the attorneys filed in state court the next day).<sup>[6]</sup> Just twenty-seven days earlier he had told his two attorneys that filing the Rule 3.851 motion in state court by September 28, 2005 was necessary to prevent the federal filing deadline from expiring. <i>See</i> App. A ¶ 15. And Hutchinson had already drafted, dated, and had ready to file a complete petition setting out all of the claims that he wanted to raise. <i>Id.</i> ¶¶ 15-16. By simply changing the name of the court in which that petition was to be filed, Hutchinson himself could have filed his federal habeas petition on or soon after October 20, 2005, which would have been just twenty days after the expiration of the one-year limitations period.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>Yet Hutchinson did nothing of the sort for nearly four years. He did not file his <i>pro se</i> habeas petition in federal court until July 24, 2009, which was long after the state trial court had denied his Rule 3.851 motion on January 3, 2008, and was also after the Florida Supreme Court had affirmed that denial on July 9, 2009. More to the point, Hutchinson waited to file his federal petition for three years, nine months and five daysa total of 1,374 daysafter he learned on October 19, 2005 that his attorneys had missed the deadline for a filing in state court that would have <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1103</span> tolled the federal limitations period. There is nothing in Hutchinson's affidavit or in his briefs to explain his delay of nearly four years. Nothing.</p>\n<p>We need not decide whether Hutchinson has established that an extraordinary circumstance stood in the way of his meeting the § 2244(d) filing deadline, because he has not carried his burden of showing that he pursued his rights diligently. <i>See </i><i>Holland,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 2562; <i>Lawrence,</i> 549 U.S. at 336, 127 S.Ct. at 1085; <i>see also </i><i>Chavez,</i> 647 F.3d at 1066, 1068. Although Hutchinson's affidavit may show that he diligently attempted to have his state collateral motion filed in time to give him the benefit of § 2244(d) statutory tolling, it does not show that once that opportunity was missed he pursued his federal rights diligently. Instead, his affidavit and the other materials he has submitted show that he had in hand a petition that he could have re-labeled and filed <i>pro se</i> in federal court within three weeks after the one-year limitations period ran, but he waited three-and-three-quarter years before he filed a <i>pro se</i> federal habeas petition. That is not reasonable diligence.</p>\n<p>Hutchinson's lengthy delay in filing his <i>pro se</i> federal habeas petition stands in stark contrast to the petitioner's diligence in the <i>Holland</i> case. The Supreme Court stressed that \"the <i>very day</i> that Holland discovered that his AEDPA clock had expired due to [his attorney's] failings, Holland prepared his own habeas petition <i>pro se</i> and promptly filed it with the District Court.\" <i>Holland,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 2565 (emphasis in original). Holland's filing of his federal habeas petition the day after he learned that \"his AEDPA clock had expired due to [his attorney's] failings\" may be \"maximum feasible diligence,\" <i>id.,</i> which is not required. But Hutchinson's failure to do anything to get his federal habeas petition filed for nearly four years after he learned that the AEDPA clock had run out due to his attorneys' miscalculation is not even \"reasonable diligence,\" which is required, <i>id.</i></p>\n<p>The district court did not err in concluding that Hutchinson was not entitled to equitable tolling of 1,393 days.</p>\n<p>AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p>BARKETT, Circuit Judge, concurring in the result only:</p>\n<p>Initially, I disagree with the majority's holding that Hutchinson was not reasonably diligent in pursuing his claims. He did everything any reasonable client would do to assure that his lawyers protected his interests, including imploring his lawyers to file his post-conviction pleadings in a timely manner. The majority's suggestion that Hutchinson should have filed a placeholder pro se habeas petition is simply not logical when Hutchinson was represented by lawyers who were assuring him that his claims were being pursued.</p>\n<p>However, no matter how diligent Hutchinson was or could have been, as the law stands today, this Court still could not grant Hutchinson the relief of equitable tolling because the Supreme Court has held that, notwithstanding his diligence, a defendant is responsible for and must bear the consequences of his lawyer's negligence.<sup>[1]</sup><i>See </i><i>Lawrence,</i> 549 U.S. at 336-37, 127 S.Ct. 1079; <i>Coleman v. Thompson,</i> 501 U.S. 722, 753-54, 111 S.Ct. 2546, 115 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1104</span> L.Ed.2d 640 (1991); <i>see also </i><i>Martinez v. Ryan,</i> 566 U.S. ___, (2012) (slip op., at 7); <i>Holland,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 2563.</p>\n<p>The holdings of <i>Lawrence</i> and <i>Coleman</i> are premised on the continued application to death row inmates of the agency theory of the lawyer-client relationship. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Maples v. Thomas,</i> 565 U.S. ___, 132 S.Ct. 912, 922, 181 L.Ed.2d 807 (2012) (explaining that <i>Coleman's</i> holding was based on \"well-settled principles of agency law\" that \"the principal bears the risk of negligent conduct on the part of his agent.\"). However, as amplified below, none of the key assumptions underlying the application of an agency relationship to a death-sentenced client and his lawyer are valid in the post-conviction context.<sup>[2]</sup> When the law already recognizes equitable exceptions to holding a client responsible for his lawyer's actions under circumstances with less drastic consequences, an exception should also be made for death row inmates so that their lawyer's negligence does not preclude federal review of constitutional claims.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>Agency Principles and Death Row Inmates</i>\n</h2>\n<p>An agency relationship exists to permit one person to act on behalf of another.<sup>[3]</sup> Generally the principal chooses an agent to act on his behalf for a specific purpose,<sup>[4]</sup> and in a traditional lawyer-client relationship, a client hires a lawyer to represent him in a discrete legal matter. The legitimacy of transferring responsibility for the lawyer's negligence from the lawyer to the client is based on several assumptions that underpin the agency relationship. First, it is assumed that the client voluntarily chooses his lawyer for competence, diligence, and loyalty.<sup>[5]</sup> Second, it is assumed that the client has the ability to direct the actions of the lawyer<sup>[6]</sup> or, at the very least, that constant and adequate opportunities exist for communication between the client and his lawyer.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>But these assumptions do not apply to inmates on death row, almost all of whom do not choose their lawyers. Instead they must depend on appointed or pro bono volunteer counsel who too often lack expertise in post-conviction death penalty representation. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Maples,</i> 132 S.Ct. at 918. Consequently, the representation provided in state and federal post-conviction proceedings is too often inadequate.<sup>[8]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1105</span> For example, former Florida Supreme Court Justice Raul Cantero stated that \"some of the [appointed] counsel have little or no experience in death penalty cases. They have not raised the right issues . . . [and] [s]ometimes they raise too many issues and still haven't raised the right ones.\"<sup>[9]</sup> Florida Supreme Court Justice Barbara Pariente has also stated that \"[a]s for [appointed] counsel, we have observed deficiencies and we would definitely endorse the need for increased standards for [appointed] counsel, as well as a continuing system of screening and monitoring to ensure minimum levels of competence.\"<sup>[10]</sup> Likewise, Alabama's death row representation suffers from the same problems. The Supreme Court noted that not only does Alabama set \"low eligibility requirements for lawyers appointed to represent indigent capital defendants at trial,\" <i>Maples,</i> 132 S.Ct. at 917, it is \"[n]early alone\" in not \"guarantee[ing] representation to indigent capital defendants in post-conviction proceedings,\" <i>id.</i> at 918. Instead, Alabama primarily relies on the efforts of out-of-state volunteer lawyers to handle post-conviction representation. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The agency analogy also breaks down because death row inmates have a limited ability to communicate with their lawyers.<sup>[11]</sup> Prisons are often located in far-flung places that are difficult for lawyers to reach and often the lawyers are not even located within the same state as their death row clients. Additionally, inmates have restricted access to phones, the internet, and law libraries. In <i>Lawrence</i> and <i>Holland,</i> it was the lack of access to word processing systems and a law library that hampered the petitioners' ability to communicate <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1106</span> with their attorneys. <i>See</i> Brief for Petitioners at 11 n. 25, <i>Lawrence,</i> 549 U.S. 327, 127 S.Ct. 1079 (No. 05-8820); Petitioner's Brief on the Merits at 2 n. 1., <i>Holland,</i> 130 S.Ct. 2549 (No. 09-5327). In Alabama, death row inmates' phone calls are limited to twenty-five minutes, with prison officials determining the schedule and frequency of phone conversations.<sup>[12]</sup> According to Georgia's inmate orientation handbook, phone calls in Georgia prisons are limited to fifteen minutes.<sup>[13]</sup></p>\n<p>Moreover, if a death row inmate is held in a super-maximum security prison or a segregation housing unit (\"SHU\"), which most are, these barriers may be even more difficult to overcome. First, access to basic reading and writing materials may be entirely restricted, depending on how much of a security threat the inmate is deemed to be. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Beard v. Banks,</i> 548 U.S. 521, 126 S.Ct. 2572, 165 L.Ed.2d 697 (2006) (upholding prison regulation that denies access to written material to violent inmates). Second, communication with the outside world becomes even more challenging and more restricted. \"In virtually every state, death-row inmates are `locked down' in their cell for most of the day, have little or no access to educational or other prison programs, and experience great isolation and loss of relationships.\"<sup>[14]</sup> As Justice Kennedy has observed, \"incarceration at [a super-maximum security prison] is synonymous with extreme isolation.\" <i>Wilkinson v. Austin,</i> 545 U.S. 209, 214, 125 S.Ct. 2384, 162 L.Ed.2d 174 (2005). Finally, the psychological effects of spending extended periods in solitary confinementcommonly known as SHU syndromemay impair an inmate's mental capabilities to the extent that his active participation in litigation becomes impossible.<sup>[15]</sup></p>\n<p>Finally, even if death row inmates were given the ability to access their attorneys without these formidable obstacles, most death row inmates lack the skills and intellect to supervise, direct or police the activities of their lawyers in the way that the agency paradigm assumes. \"Capital inmates almost uniformly are indigent, and often illiterate and uneducated.\"<sup>[16]</sup> The dangers of these shortcomings are all the more pronounced in the context of federal habeas proceedings, \"the unique and complex nature\" of which the Supreme Court has long recognized. <i>See </i><i>McFarland v. Scott,</i> 512 U.S. 849, 855, 114 S.Ct. 2568, 129 L.Ed.2d 666 (1994). \"[T]he complexity of our jurisprudence in this area makes it unlikely that capital defendants will be able to file successful petitions for collateral relief without the assistance of persons learned in the law.\" <i>Id.</i> at 855-56, 114 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1107</span> S.Ct. 2568 (internal alterations omitted); <i>quoting </i><i>Murray v. Giarratano,</i> 492 U.S. 1, 28, 109 S.Ct. 2765, 106 L.Ed.2d 1 (1989) (Kennedy, J., joined by O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment); <i>see also id.,</i> at 28, 109 S.Ct. 2765 (Stevens, J., joined by Brennan, Marshall, and Blackmun, JJ., dissenting) (\"[T]his Court's death penalty jurisprudence unquestionably is difficult even for a trained lawyer to master.\"). Given its acknowledgment of the challenges habeas proceedings present to lawyers, it is not surprising that the Supreme Court recently noted in <i>Martinez, supra</i><i>,</i> at ___ (slip op., at 9), that \"[t]he prisoner, unlearned in the law, may not comply with the State's procedural rules or may misapprehend the substantive details of federal constitutional law.\" Although <i>Martinez</i> dealt specifically with the ability of a prisoner to pursue a post-conviction petition in state court, there can be no doubt that the same limitations are present in the federal post-conviction context as well.<sup>[17]</sup></p>\n<p>Moreover, a habeas petitioner is not permitted to interfere with his lawyer's determinations regarding which claims to raise. <i>See </i><i>Jones v. Barnes,</i> 463 U.S. 745, 751, 103 S.Ct. 3308, 77 L.Ed.2d 987 (1983). Even if a client wanted to correct his lawyer's mistakes, he would not be entitled to do so. A prisoner does not have a right to file pro se pleadings while represented by counsel. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Gwiazdzinski,</i> 141 F.3d 784, 787 (7th Cir.1998). Courts routinely decline to consider pro se pleadings when an inmate is represented by counsel. <i>See </i><i>Downs v. McNeil,</i> 520 F.3d 1311, 1324 (11th Cir.2008) (\"[E]ven a savvy petitioner, who may see the clock running out on his habeas time, can only cajole [or] plead with his counsel to file the petition timely.\") (citations omitted); <i>see also</i> 11th Cir. R. 25-1 (\"When a party is represented by counsel, the clerk may not accept filings from the party.\").<sup>[18]</sup></p>\n<p>These many obstacles render the principal-agent relationship inapplicable in the post-conviction context. An inmate's inability to supervise and control the actions of his lawyer makes this relationship far more akin to the paradigm of an independent contractor than a traditional agency relationship.<sup>[19]</sup> The negligent acts of an independent contractor, unlike those of an agent, are not imputed to the employer for the very reason that the employer lacks the power to meaningfully supervise the contractor.</p>\n<p>The reality of the quality of post-conviction death penalty representation available to indigent inmates on death row does not meet the Supreme Court's recognition that Congress intended these inmates to have access to \"quality legal representation\" when it mandated the statutory right to counsel. <i>McFarland</i> 512 U.S. at 856, 859, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1108</span> 114 S.Ct. 2568 (\"[F]ederal habeas corpus has a particularly important role to play in promoting fundamental fairness in the imposition of the death penalty.\"); <i>see also</i> 18 U.S.C. § 3599(a)(2), (d) (2006) (recodification of 21 U.S.C. § 848(q)(4)-(10) (1988)). Congress provided for a statutory right to qualified counsel in federal habeas proceedings in light of the \"seriousness of the possible penalty . . . and the unique and complex nature of the litigation.\" 18 U.S.C. § 3599(d). Indeed, the Supreme Court, recognizing the complexity of federal habeas proceedings, held that the statutory right to counsel must begin even prior to the filing of a federal habeas petition. <i>McFarland,</i> 512 U.S. at 855, 114 S.Ct. 2568.</p>\n<p>The circumstances surrounding Hutchinson's lawyers' negligent filing of his state post-conviction motion in this case illustrate the difficulties faced by a death row inmate who attempts to work diligently with his lawyers. While on death row, Hutchinson maintained communicationto the best of his abilitywith his lawyers and repeatedly asked them to timely file his state post-conviction motion so as to toll the filing deadline for his federal habeas petition.<sup>[20]</sup> Even the majority recognizes that Hutchinson was reasonably diligent up to the time that his lawyers filed his motion for state post-conviction relief. What other steps could Hutchinson reasonably have taken? Should he not have trusted his lawyers when they assured him they were aware of and would comply with all filing deadlines? There is certainly no expectation that a civil client will shadow his lawyer's every move to ensure that all deadlines are met and all filings are in order. On the contrary, a represented client has every right to assume that his lawyer will competently discharge his duties.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, the majority concludes that Hutchinson was not reasonably diligent because he should have filed a pro se federal habeas petition and asked to have it held in abeyance until his efforts to secure state collateral relief were completed. This course of action surely cannot be required of a client when he has legal representation.<sup>[21]</sup> A reasonable prisoner would have <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1109</span> no cause to file his own pleadings for the simple reason that it is assumed that it is his lawyer's job to do so. Especially here, where Hutchinson's lawyers repeatedly assured him that they would file on time, Hutchinson had no reason to pursue an alternative avenue of relief. Reasonably relying on his lawyers' assurances that they were doing what was necessary to protect his federal habeas rights, Hutchinson did not file a pro se federal habeas petition until it was too late.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Exceptions to Client Responsibility for Lawyer's Conduct</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Death row inmates should not be precluded from having their federal claims reviewed because of their lawyer's negligence. Exceptions to the principle that all clients are responsible for the negligence of their lawyers exist elsewhere in the law. For example, when more important countervailing values are at stake, various rules of civil procedure provide courts with discretion to excuse procedural defaults in cases of lawyer negligence. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Dove v. CODESCO,</i> 569 F.2d 807, 810 (4th Cir. 1978) (\"[T]he sanctions for attorney neglect should be borne if at all possible by the attorney himself rather than by his client.\"); <i>Jackson v. Washington Monthly Co.,</i> 569 F.2d 119, 123, n. 23 (D.C.Cir.1977) (\"[A] sound discretion hardly comprehends a pointless exaction of retribution. Dismissals for misconduct attributable to lawyers, and in no [way] to their clients, invariably penalize the innocent and may let the guilty off scot-free.\").</p>\n<p>Rule 60(b)(1), for example, provides relief from a final judgment for excusable neglect, which can \"encompass situations in which the failure to comply with a filing deadline is attributable to negligence.\" <i>United States v. Davenport,</i> 668 F.3d 1316, 1324 (11th Cir.2012). Similarly, Rule 55(c) has been applied to give a client relief from the entry of a default that was caused by the negligence of an attorney under the \"good cause standard.\" <i>Shepard Claims Serv., Inc. v. William Darrah &amp; Assocs.,</i> 796 F.2d 190, 195 (6th Cir.1986). Exceptions such as those available under Rules 55(c) and 60(b) exist because, unlike a pure principal-agent relationship, most clients are not able to exercise perfect control over their lawyers.</p>\n<p>Likewise, under Rule 11, the agency principle is put aside in order for courts to direct sanctions toward lawyersand not their clientswhen clients are not implicated in or aware of the offending attorney error, bad faith, or negligence that fall within a lawyer's professional zone of control. Under Rule 11, \"[s]anctionable conduct by a party's counsel does not necessarily parlay into sanctionable conduct by a party.\" <i>Byrne v. Nezhat,</i> 261 F.3d 1075, 1123 (11th Cir.2001) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p>And under Rule 37, a district court has broad discretion to apportion sanctions for discovery abuses between lawyers and their clients. <i>Devaney v. Cont'l Am. Ins. Co.,</i> 989 F.2d 1154, 1162 (11th Cir.1993). For example, Rule 37 is not construed to authorize the sanction of dismissal \"because of petitioner's noncompliance with a pretrial production order when it has been established that failure to comply has been due to inability, and not to willfulness, bad faith, or any fault of petitioner.\" <i>Societe Internationale Pour Participations Industrielles</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1110</span> <i>et Commerciales, S.A. v. Rogers,</i> 357 U.S. 197, 212, 78 S.Ct. 1087, 2 L.Ed.2d 1255 (1958). This Court has held that \"[a] party's simple negligence or other action grounded in a misunderstanding of a court order does not warrant dismissal.\" <i>Equal Employment Opportunity Comm'n, v. Troy State University,</i> 693 F.2d 1353, 1357 (11th Cir.1982). <i>See also </i><i>Malautea v. Suzuki Motor Co., Ltd.,</i> 987 F.2d 1536, 1542 (11th Cir.1993) (stating that \"[violation of a discovery order caused by simple negligence, misunderstanding, or inability to comply will not justify a Rule 37 default judgment or dismissal.\").</p>\n<p>Making death row inmates wholly responsible for a lawyer's negligence does not ensure that lawyers will timely assert their clients' claims. Death row clients have little ability to hold their lawyers accountable for their negligence. And a policy of punishing death row inmates for such mistakes does not improve the timeliness of lawyers' actions. While civil litigants can seek relief for a lawyer's mistake through a malpractice lawsuit, there is no remedy for a death row inmate. When a lawyer's negligence forecloses consideration of the entirety of the death row inmate's federal claims, the result is the imposition of the death penalty without federal review.</p>\n<p>These cases and examples illustrate that countervailing values forge exceptions in the law. The countervailing value here is the protection of the right to federal review of a death row inmate's federal habeas petition, which is premised, in part, on \"equitable principles [which] have traditionally governed the substantive law of habeas corpus.\" <i>Holland,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 2560 (quotation marks omitted) (holding that the one-year statutory filing deadline for federal habeas petitions is subject to equitable tolling). Thus, in <i>Holland,</i> which presented the same question as is presented here, the Supreme Court framed the inquiry as one of how equity applies while still acknowledging the federal statutory filing deadline. <i>See id.</i> at 2563. The Court noted that the countervailing value of federalism weighs more heavily in the case of failing to comply with a <i>state's</i> procedural rules than it does for equitable tolling of the <i>federal</i> habeas filing deadline which is concerned only \"with <i>federal</i> timing rules.\" <i>Id.</i> With these considerations in mind, the Court rejected a <i>per se</i> approach to the previously unqualified rule that \"a petitioner must bear the risk of attorney error\" in the context of <i>Holland</i>'s case. <i>Id.</i><sup>[22]</sup></p>\n<p>More recently in <i>Maples,</i> 132 S.Ct. at 924, the Court held that a lawyer's conduct that constitutes abandonment of his death row inmate client will also provide the necessary basis for equitable tolling of the federal habeas filing deadline. The Court reached this conclusion, in part, because even agency principles acknowledge an exception to the assumption that a client must bear the risk of the acts or omissions of his lawyer in the case of abandonment. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>However, to grant equitable tolling only in cases of complete lawyer abandonment or something akin to gross negligence does not go far enough. <i>See </i><i>Holland,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 2567 (Alito, J., concurring in the judgment) <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1111</span> (\"Allowing equitable tolling in cases involving gross rather than ordinary attorney negligence would not only fail to make sense in light of our prior cases; it would also be impractical in the extreme. . . . [I]t has been aptly said that gross negligence is ordinary negligence with a vituperative epithet added.\"). Where is the equity in denying the same relief to one inmate just because the acts or omissions of his lawyer were slightly less egregious than another inmate's lawyer? Instead, the reality is that death row inmates' access to competent, post-conviction legal representation is at best inconsistent and at worst non-existent and their ability to communicate freely and actively participate in their litigation is seriously compromised. Under this reality, I question whether strict adherence to the principle that a death row inmate must bear the consequences of his lawyer's negligence is fair or just.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>APPENDIX A</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA PENSACOLA DIVISION</h2>\nJEFFREY GLENN HUTCHINSON, Petitioner,\nv.\nWALTER A.

I make this affidavit in support of my claim that I am entitled to equitable tolling.</p>\n<p>2. On July 1, 2004, the Florida Supreme Court affirmed by convictions and sentences, and on July 22, 2004, the mandate was issued.</p>\n<p>3. In August 2004, Harry Brody and Jeff Hazen, registry lawyers, were appointed to assist me with my postconviction remedies.</p>\n<p>4. On August 10, 2004, I received my first letter from Mr. Brody and Mr. Hazen, and the very next day, I sent them a letter thanking them for taking my case.</p>\n<p>5. On August 18, 2004, I received confirmation that Harry Brody and Jeff Hazen were appointed as my new lawyers, I was excited to hear from them and wrote back the very next day, thanking them for acknowledging my letters; since my previous lawyers had not answered or acknowledged any of my letters.</p>\n<p>6. On September 21, 2004, I had my first meeting with Mr. Hazen, and during that meeting he explained the postconviction process and how he and Mr. Brody planned to get me a new trial and, through that, released from prison.</p>\n<p>7. On October 8, 2004, I had my first meeting with Harry Brody, and during that meeting, Mr. Brody told me, \"Look, we know you're innocent and we're going to get you out of here.\" (His words as I recall them.) This made me so happy that I began to cry. It was the first time that I had a lawyer that I thought would stand up for me. I truly believed Mr. Brody would help to exonerate me.</p>\n<p>8. On October 20, 2004, I had another meeting with Mr. Hazen, and during that meeting, I asked him if he or Mr. Brody had contacted any of the witnesses that would need to be present at the evidentiary <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1112</span> hearing. He told me, \"No,\" but not to worry about that because \"we'll have plenty of time for that later on.\" (His words as I recall them.)</p>\n<p>9. On November 4, 2004, I talked to Mr. Brody during a prearranged phone call, and during that conversation I expressed my concerns regarding the running of 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(1)'s one-year limitations period and the fact that they had not contacted any of the witnesses' that would need to be present at the evidentiary hearing. In response, Mr. Brady told me, \"Don't worry the time, we have almost a year to file the 3.850.\" (His words as I recall them.)</p>\n<p>10. On December 10, 2004, I had another meeting with Mr. Brody, during which I again expressed my concerns about the running of the one-year period of limitations and the fact that they still had not contacted any of the witnesses that would need to be present at the evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p>11. On March 23, 2005, I had another meeting with Mr. Hazen, during which I asked him to file a \"shell-brief to ensure that the one-year limitations period for filing my 2254 petition would not expire, since they still had not contacted any of the witnesses that would need to be present at the evidentiary hearing. At that point Mr. Hazen claimed that \"a shell-brief doesn't provide the protection that it used to\", but he assured me that \"we still have plenty of time to get everything done.\" (His words as I recall them.)</p>\n<p>12. On April 14, 2005, I had another meeting with Harry Brody, during which I asked him pointedly about whether or not they (Mr. Brody and Mr. Hazen) could file my rule 3.651 motion in time to prevent the one-year limitations period from expiring on my 2254 petition. Mr. Brody seemed visibly disoriented and smelled strongly of alcohol, despite the fact that he was eating \"Altoids\" breath mints. I asked him if he had been partying the night before and he changed the subject saying, \"Don't worry about it; we still have plenty of time to file the 3.850.\" (His words as I recall them.)</p>\n<p>13. On May 12, 2005, I had another meeting with Mr. Hazen, during which I again voiced my concerns about nothing being done regarding the witnesses, and again I asked about filing a \"shell-brief to prevent the one-year limitations period from expiring on my 2254 petition, since the rule 3.851 motion was still not ready to file. Mr. Hazen assured me that there was still \"plenty of time\" to file the rule 3.851 motion, and that it \"was not due for several months.\" (His words as I recall them.)</p>\n<p>14. On July 14, 2005, I had a meeting with both Mr. Brody and Mr. Hazen, during which I asked them directly about fifing the rule 3.851 motion (which was <i>still</i> not finished) and why they had still not filed a \"shell-brief to not only allow enough time to investigate all of the evidence and to contact all of the witnesses that would need to testify at the evidentiary hearing, but also to prevent the one-year limitations period from expiring on my 2254 petition. Mr. Brody, who was sweating profusely and smelted of alcohol, became very angry and suddenly got up and left the meeting room. I asked Mr. Hazen, \"What was that all about?\", and Mr. Hazen replied, \"He's just having a lot of personal problems.\" (His words as 1 recall them.)</p>\n<p>15. On September 22, 2005, I had another meeting with both Mr. Brody and Mr. Hazen, during which I told them point blank and in no uncertain terms to \"either file my rule 3.851 motion immediately or I will discharge you and file It myself.\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1113</span> At that point Mr. Brody and Mr. Hazen both assuredpromisedguaranteed me that they would file the motion on or before September 28, 2005, though they went on to say that we had 90 days after the mandate was issued by the Florida Supreme Court, so the rule 3.851 motion was not actually due until \"October 20th.\" (Their words as I recall them.) Once again I told them that if they did not file the rule 3.651 motion <i>immediately,</i> I would file it myself, because that was the only way I could prevent the one-year limitations period from expiring on my 2254 petition. And again both Mr. Brody and Mr. Hazen \"guaranteed\" me that they would file the rule 3.851 motion no later than September 28, 2005.</p>\n<p>16. Had it not been for that premise from Mr. Brody and Mr. Hazen, I would have discharged them and filed a pro se rule 3.851 motion to prevent 26 U.S.C. § 2255(d)(1)'s one-year limitations period from expiring. See exhibits 1 and 2, respectively, facsimiles of the Notice of Pro Se Status and Rule 3.851 Motion that I would have filed on September 23, 2005, but for that promise.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>17. Despite their promise, Mr. Brody end Mr. Hazen did not file my rule 3.851 motion until October 20, 2005 28 days after they promised me that they would do so and 21 days after my one-year period of limitations had expired.</p>\n<p>18. In sum, if Mr. Brody and Mr. Hazen had not lied to me I would have discharged them and personally filed my initial rule 3.851 motion on September 23, 2005, a data which would have tolled the one-year limitations period with six days remainingmaking my initial 2254 petition timely.</p>\n<p>Wherefore, I ask that the relief requested in the petition be granted, or for such other relief as the Court may deem just and proper.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>VERIFICATION OF DOCUMENT</i></h2>\n<p><i>I</i> hereby declare under penalty of perjury that I have read this Affidavit and that the facts and matters stated in it are true and correct.</p>\nExecuted on:\n<i>June 15,</i> 2010.\n            Respectfully submitted,\n            Jeffrey Glenn Hutchinson\n            # 124849-P2214S\n            Union Correctional Institution\n            7819 NW 228th Street\n            Raiford, FL XXXXX-XXXX\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  By our calculations, the actual deadline should have been September 29, 2005, because that is one year after September 29, 2004, the date on which the judgment of the state court became final under § 2244(d)(1)(A). For some reason, the district court said and the parties say that the deadline was September 30, 2005. Because the difference makes no difference we will use the September 30, 2005 date, too.</p>\n<p>[2]  And it is a good thing that rules of precedent apply here. Even Blackstone, who was something of a fan of equity, warned that:\n</p>\n<p>[T]he liberty of considering all cases in an equitable light, must not be indulged too far; lest thereby we destroy all law, and leave the decision of every question entirely in the breast of the judge. And law, without equity, though hard and disagreeable, is much more desirable for the public good, than equity without law: which would make every judge a legislator, and introduce most infinite confusion; as there would then be almost as many different rules of action laid down in our courts, as there are differences of capacity and sentiment in the human mind.</p>\n<p>1 William Blackstone, <i>Commentaries</i> *62; <i>see also</i> 1 Joseph Story, <i>Commentaries on Equity Jurisprudence</i> § 19, at 16 (13th ed. 1886) (\"If indeed, a Court of Equity in England did possess the unbounded jurisdiction which has been thus generally ascribed to it ... it would be the most gigantic in its sway, and the most formidable instrument of arbitrary power, that could well be devised.\").</p>\n<p>[3]  Any implicit criticism by us of Hutchinson's attorneys for their mistake is tempered by awareness that a panel of this Court made exactly the same mistake a year-and-a-half before those two attorneys did. The opinion in <i>Diaz v. Secretary for the Department of Corrections,</i> 362 F.3d 698 (11th Cir.2004), states that \"[t]he 90-day period in which Diaz could have filed a petition in the United States Supreme Court expired on June 19, 1997, at which time the clock began to run on the one-year limitation for the filing of habeas petitions.\" <i>Id.</i> at 699. The opinion in that case shows, however, that June 19, 1997 was 90 days after the state appellate court's mandate had issued and not 90 days after its opinion had issued, which was 16 days earlier. <i>See id.</i> We do not know if the <i>Diaz</i> opinion confused Hutchinson's counsel or if they were even aware of it. What we do know is that no one is perfect; we all make mistakes.</p>\n<p>[4]  In his affidavit Hutchinson states that before the statute of limitations ran he met with attorney Brody three times, App. A ¶¶ 7, 10, 12, with attorney Hazen four times, <i>id.</i> ¶¶ 6, 8, 11, 13, and with both of them on two other occasions, <i>id.</i> ¶ 14, 15. He states that during one of his meetings with Brody alone, more than five months before the limitations period ran, Brody was \"visibly disoriented and smelled strongly of alcohol,\" <i>id.</i> ¶ 12, and during another meeting two-and-a-half months before the limitations period ran Brody was \"sweating profusely and smelled of alcohol,\" <i>id.</i> ¶ 14. Hutchinson also says that on that later occasion Hazen told him that Brody was \"just having a lot of personal problems.\" <i>Id.</i> But there is no allegation that Brody's impairment, if any, caused the error in miscalculating the due date. <i>See </i><i>Chavez,</i> 647 F.3d at 1071 (holding that equitable tolling was not appropriate where \"[t]here are . . . no allegations at all that [state post-conviction counsel's] health had affected his ability to handle the case up to the time he withdrew or that it had prevented him from filing the motion for state post-conviction relief sooner\"). Nor has Hutchinson alleged that attorney Hazen, who actually signed and filed the Rule 3.851 motion in state court on October 20, 2005, was ever impaired in any way.</p>\n<p>[5]  Hutchinson's affidavit also states that on three occasions, the last of which was July 14, 2005, he asked his attorneys to file a \"shell-brief\" in state court in order to prevent the time from running while they investigated his case and prepared the real motion for state collateral relief. App. A ¶¶ 11, 13, 14. But attorney Hazen told him then that a state court \"shell brief didn't provide the protection that it used to.\" <i>Id.</i> ¶ 11. It appears that Hazen was correct about that. The respondent's brief in this case informs us that in 2001 Florida's Rule 3.851 was amended to prohibit the filing of shell motions, <i>see</i> Fla. R.Crim. P. 3.851(e)(1)(D); <i>Gonzalez v. State,</i> 990 So.2d 1017, 1034 &amp; n. 9 (Fla.2008), and that shell motions are stricken by the Florida courts and no longer can be used to meet filing deadlines. In his reply brief, Hutchinson does not take issue with any of that information.</p>\n<p>[6]  Although Hutchinson's affidavit and the date of his signature on the federal habeas petition establish beyond dispute that he knew his attorneys had missed the deadline for filing his state petition, our separately writing colleague asserts that Hutchinson had no reason to file his federal habeas petition until nearly four years later because he relied on his attorneys' assurances that they were doing what was necessary to protect his federal habeas rights. <i>See</i> Concurring Op. at 1108-09. That assertion is belied by Hutchinson's own sworn statements, which establish that he knew his attorneys had missed the deadline, yet for years after realizing that he still made no attempt to file in federal court the collateral petition he had already drafted. However judges may feel about the law applicable to this or any other area, we have no license to rewrite the facts of a case.</p>\n<p>[7]  Had Hutchinson done so, the federal district court could have held his federal habeas petition in abeyance until his efforts to secure state collateral relief were completed. <i>See </i><i>Rhines v. Weber,</i> 544 U.S. 269, 278-79, 125 S.Ct. 1528, 1535, 161 L.Ed.2d 440 (2005). Our colleague's suggestion that a district court might dismiss such a petition without abusing its discretion is contradicted by the only authority she cites for that proposition, which is the <i>Rhines</i> decision. <i>See</i> Concurring Op. at 1108-09 n. 21. The Supreme Court stated in <i>Rhines</i> that:\n</p>\n<p>[I]t likely would be an abuse of discretion for a district court to deny a stay and to dismiss a mixed petition if the petitioner had good cause for his failure to exhaust, his unexhausted claims are potentially meritorious, and there is no indication that the petitioner engaged in intentionally dilatory litigation tactics. In such circumstances, the district court should stay, rather than dismiss, the mixed petition. <i>See </i><i>Rose v. Lundy,</i> 455 U.S. 509, at 522, 102 S.Ct. 1198, 71 L.Ed.2d 379 (1982) (the total exhaustion requirement was not intended to \"unreasonably impair the prisoner's right to relief\"). In such a case, the petitioner's interest in obtaining federal review of his claims outweighs the competing interests in finality and speedy resolution of federal petitions.</p>\n<p><i>Rhines,</i> 544 U.S. at 278, 125 S.Ct. at 1535.</p>\n<p>[1]  In order to merit equitable tolling, a petitioner must establish \"(1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way.\" <i>Holland v.

Although Hutchinson kept asking his lawyers to file his state petition, there is nothing to indicate that he knew the precise deadline. It is equally consistent with the facts to believe that he simply wanted his state petition filed and later accepted his attorneys' advice that the deadline was October 20, 2005.</p>\n<p>[21]  Indeed, there is no guarantee that such a placeholder petition would be accepted by the federal district court. <i>See </i><i>Rhines v. Weber,</i> 544 U.S. 269, 277, 125 S.Ct. 1528, 161 L.Ed.2d 440 (2005) (\"[S]tay and abeyance should be available only in limited circumstances. . . and is only appropriate when the district court determines there was good cause for the petitioner's failure to present his claims first to the state courts.\"). In a concurring opinion with the judgment in <i>Rhines,</i> Justice Stevens, with whom Justices Ginsburg and Breyer joined, observed that conditioning the stay-and-abeyance procedure on \"good cause\" instead of simply on a lack of \"intentionally dilatory litigation tactics\" left open the door for \"[t]he trickiness of some exhaustion requirements to infect issues of good cause. . . .\" <i>Id.</i> at 279, 125 S.Ct. 1528. Moreover, <i>Rhines</i> concerned an issue distinct from the case at hand in which some habeas corpus claims had been exhausted in state court and others had not. The stay-and-abeyance procedure was endorsed in limited circumstances in order to preserve the petitioner's interest in obtaining review of his claims. <i>Id.</i> at 278, 125 S.Ct. 1528. In contrast, the good cause inquiry in this case would have involved issues of attorney negligence. In addition, Hutchinson's ability to attempt to prevail upon the stay-and-abeyance procedure turned on both his access to information about the procedure, and a presumption that he did not believe his attorneys' advice that the filing deadline for his application for state post-conviction relief in order to preserve his federal habeas corpus right was on October 20, 2005. Under these circumstances, it is far from certain that Hutchinson would have been granted stay-and-abeyance by a district court applying the good cause standard and unlikely that a panel of this Court would have reversed a district court denial thereof on an abuse of discretion review.</p>\n<p>[22]  The crucial importance of the broader availability of equitable tolling is highlighted by the subsequent developments in Holland's case. Upon eventual remand to the district court, which granted Holland equitable tolling and then considered the merits of the constitutional claims raised in Holland's federal habeas petition, the court granted him habeas relief on his <i>Faretta v. California,</i> 422 U.S. 806, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1975) claim. <i>Holland v. Tucker,</i> No. 06-civ-20182 (S.D.Fla.

Hutchinson's state collateral petition was not filed until October 20, 2005, which was twenty days after the entire one-year period for filing the federal petition had run on September 30, 2005, and as a result none of the limitations period for filing his federal petition was left to be tolled. From that point on Hutchinson's hopes for relief were riding all or nothing on his state collateral petition, and the result came up nothing when the Florida Supreme Court affirmed the denial of collateral relief. <i>See </i><i>Hutchinson,</i> 17 So.3d at 702-04.</p>\n<p>Hutchinson recognizes both that his federal habeas petition should have been filed by September 30, 2005, and that because his state collateral petition was not filed until October 20, 2005, he cannot claim statutory tolling under § 2244(d)(2) for any of the time that his state collateral proceeding was ongoing. His sole contention is that he is entitled to equitable tolling. <i>See generally </i><i>Holland,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"148483\"><a href=\"/opinion/148483/holland-v-florida/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2549</span></a></span>. Equitable tolling is, well, equitable in nature, and decisions regarding it must be made \"on a case-by-case basis\" in light of \"specific circumstances, often hard to predict in advance,\" although we \"can and do draw upon decisions made in other similar cases for guidance.\" <i>Id.</i> at 2563 (quotation marks omitted). We turn now to the specific facts and circumstances of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1099</span> this case as well as to the decisions in similar cases for guidance.</p>\n<p>The parties agree that the problem in this case arose because the attorneys who filed Hutchinson's state collateral petition misunderstood the date on which the limitations period began to run at the end of the direct appeal process and, as a result, they miscalculated the filing deadline. Because no petition for writ of certiorari was filed in the United States Supreme Court as part of the direct appeal, the time for filing the federal habeas petition started running upon \"the expiration of the time for seeking such review.\" 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(1)(A). Hutchinson's attorneys understood that, but they misunderstood when the time for seeking certiorari review of a state court's judgment expired. They thought that the time for doing so expired ninety days after the Florida Supreme Court issued its mandate on July 22, 2004. <i>See</i> App. A ¶ 2. Instead, the time actually expired ninety days after the issuance of the Florida Supreme Court's judgment (the opinion was the judgment), which had happened twenty-one days earlier on July 1, 2004. <i>See</i> Sup.Ct. R. 13.3 (\"The time to file a petition for a writ of certiorari runs from the date of entry of the judgment or order sought to be reviewed, and not from the issuance date of the mandate (or its equivalent under local practice).\").</p>\n<p>As a result of that misunderstanding, Hutchinson's attorneys miscalculated the deadline by which they were required to file either Hutchinson's federal habeas petition or file his state collateral petition in time to statutorily toll the federal limitations period. They believed that they had until October 20, 2005, instead of September 30, 2005, which was the actual deadline.<sup>[1]</sup> Because they filed Hutchinson's state collateral petition on October 20, 2005, the § 2244(d)(2) tolling provision did not kick in and when Hutchinson finally filed his federal habeas petition on July 24, 2009, it was three-and-three-quarters years too late.</p>\n<p>A petitioner has the burden of establishing his rightif \"right\" is not too strong a word in the area of equityto equitable tolling. He must plead or proffer enough facts that, if true, would justify an evidentiary hearing on the issue. <i>Chavez v. Sec'y, Fla. Dep't of Corr.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"221826\"><a href=\"/opinion/221826/chavez-v-secretary-florida-dept-of-corrections/\"><span class=\"volume\">647</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1057</span></a></span>, 1060 (11th Cir.2011). And the allegations supporting equitable tolling must be specific and not conclusory. <i>Id.</i> at 1061. The Supreme Court did say in <i>Holland</i> that although equitable relief is flexible and all the facts and circumstances must be considered, we should \"draw upon decisions made in other similar cases for guidance.\" <i>Holland,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 2563. We take that statement to mean this is not an area free of rules of law, governed entirely by the chancellor's foot, but we are instead bound by precedent to the extent that there is precedent.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1100</span> Binding precedent has laid down two requirements that a federal habeas petitioner must meet before a court can grant him equitable tolling of the § 2244(d) statute of limitations.

The attorneys who filed the state collateral petition for Hutchinson misunderstood what § 2244(d)(1)(A)'s \"expiration of the time for seeking such review\" meant when read against Supreme Court Rule 13.3. The fact that they ought to have known better does not justify equitable tolling.<sup>[3]</sup> The attorneys who miscalculated the deadline for filing in the <i>Lawrence</i> case did so because they were not aware of well-settled law that should have prevented any confusion on their part. <i>See </i><i>Lawrence,</i> 549 U.S. at 336-37, 127 S.Ct. at 1085. Yet, the Supreme Court still held that equitable tolling was not justified in that case because \"[a]ttorney miscalculation is simply not sufficient to warrant equitable tolling.\" <i>Id.</i> at 336, 127 S.Ct. at 1085. If attorney miscalculation, error, or negligence were enough for equitable tolling, the § 2244(d) statute of limitations would be tolled to the brink of extinction because in practically every case where there is a failure to meet the filing deadline an attorney is at fault. <i>See </i><i>Chavez,</i> 647 F.3d at 1071 (\"In virtually every case where the issue of equitable tolling comes up one or more attorneys should have acted with more dispatch, but more than that is required.\").</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1101</span> Hutchinson argues that more is involved here than simple attorney error or miscalculation. The \"more\" that he contends is involved is set out in the affidavit that he filed in the district court in response to the motion to dismiss his federal habeas petition as untimely. (That affidavit is reproduced in full as Appendix A to this opinion.) In his affidavit, Hutchinson states that he repeatedly expressed to the two attorneys who were representing him his concern about the statute of limitations, and on September 22, 2005 he told them \"point blank and in no uncertain terms to `either file my rule 3.851 motion immediately or I will discharge you and file it myself.'\" App. A ¶ 15. On that occasion, Hutchinson recounts, both attorneys promised him that they \"would file the motion on or before September 28, 2005, though they went on to say that we had 90 days after the mandate was issued by the Florida Supreme Court, so the rule 3.851 motion was not actually due until `October 20th.'\" <i>Id.</i> According to Hutchinson, he again told his two attorneys that if they did not file the Rule 3.851 motion \"<i>immediately</i>\" he would file it himself because he knew that was \"the only way [he] could prevent the one-year limitations period from expiring on [his] 2254 petition.\" <i>Id.</i> The attorneys \"guaranteed\" him that they would file the state court motion \"no later than September 28, 2005.\" <i>Id.</i> But they did not do that. Instead, they filed the state court motion on October 20, 2005.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>Hutchinson alleges that but for his attorneys' promise to file by September 28, 2005 he \"would have discharged them and filed a pro se rule 3.851 motion to prevent 28 U.S.C. § 2255(d)(1)'s [sic] one-year limitations period from expiring.\" App. A ¶ 16. He attached to his affidavit \"facsimiles of the Notice of Pro Se Status and Rule 3.851 Motion that [he] would have filed on September 23, 2005, but for [the attorneys'] promise.\" <i>Id.</i> Those two facsimiles are each dated September 23, 2005 and signed by Hutchinson, indicating that he was ready, willing, and able to file his motion to proceed <i>pro se</i> and his Rule 3.851 motion on or soon after that date and would have done so but for his attorneys' promises, which were not kept.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1102</span> Hutchinson knew, at least by October 19, 2005, that his attorneys had not filed his state Rule 3.851 motion by the September 30, 2005 deadline (or the September 28, 2005 deadline, as he had calculated it). We know that Hutchinson knew that because October 19, 2005 is the date Hutchinson signed, under penalty of perjury, the verification on the Rule 3.851 motion (which one of the attorneys filed in state court the next day).<sup>[6]</sup> Just twenty-seven days earlier he had told his two attorneys that filing the Rule 3.851 motion in state court by September 28, 2005 was necessary to prevent the federal filing deadline from expiring. <i>See</i> App. A ¶ 15. And Hutchinson had already drafted, dated, and had ready to file a complete petition setting out all of the claims that he wanted to raise. <i>Id.</i> ¶¶ 15-16. By simply changing the name of the court in which that petition was to be filed, Hutchinson himself could have filed his federal habeas petition on or soon after October 20, 2005, which would have been just twenty days after the expiration of the one-year limitations period.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>Yet Hutchinson did nothing of the sort for nearly four years. He did not file his <i>pro se</i> habeas petition in federal court until July 24, 2009, which was long after the state trial court had denied his Rule 3.851 motion on January 3, 2008, and was also after the Florida Supreme Court had affirmed that denial on July 9, 2009. More to the point, Hutchinson waited to file his federal petition for three years, nine months and five daysa total of 1,374 daysafter he learned on October 19, 2005 that his attorneys had missed the deadline for a filing in state court that would have <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1103</span> tolled the federal limitations period. There is nothing in Hutchinson's affidavit or in his briefs to explain his delay of nearly four years. Nothing.</p>\n<p>We need not decide whether Hutchinson has established that an extraordinary circumstance stood in the way of his meeting the § 2244(d) filing deadline, because he has not carried his burden of showing that he pursued his rights diligently. <i>See </i><i>Holland,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 2562; <i>Lawrence,</i> 549 U.S. at 336, 127 S.Ct. at 1085; <i>see also </i><i>Chavez,</i> 647 F.3d at 1066, 1068. Although Hutchinson's affidavit may show that he diligently attempted to have his state collateral motion filed in time to give him the benefit of § 2244(d) statutory tolling, it does not show that once that opportunity was missed he pursued his federal rights diligently. Instead, his affidavit and the other materials he has submitted show that he had in hand a petition that he could have re-labeled and filed <i>pro se</i> in federal court within three weeks after the one-year limitations period ran, but he waited three-and-three-quarter years before he filed a <i>pro se</i> federal habeas petition. That is not reasonable diligence.</p>\n<p>Hutchinson's lengthy delay in filing his <i>pro se</i> federal habeas petition stands in stark contrast to the petitioner's diligence in the <i>Holland</i> case. The Supreme Court stressed that \"the <i>very day</i> that Holland discovered that his AEDPA clock had expired due to [his attorney's] failings, Holland prepared his own habeas petition <i>pro se</i> and promptly filed it with the District Court.\" <i>Holland,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 2565 (emphasis in original). Holland's filing of his federal habeas petition the day after he learned that \"his AEDPA clock had expired due to [his attorney's] failings\" may be \"maximum feasible diligence,\" <i>id.,</i> which is not required. But Hutchinson's failure to do anything to get his federal habeas petition filed for nearly four years after he learned that the AEDPA clock had run out due to his attorneys' miscalculation is not even \"reasonable diligence,\" which is required, <i>id.</i></p>\n<p>The district court did not err in concluding that Hutchinson was not entitled to equitable tolling of 1,393 days.</p>\n<p>AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p>BARKETT, Circuit Judge, concurring in the result only:</p>\n<p>Initially, I disagree with the majority's holding that Hutchinson was not reasonably diligent in pursuing his claims. He did everything any reasonable client would do to assure that his lawyers protected his interests, including imploring his lawyers to file his post-conviction pleadings in a timely manner. The majority's suggestion that Hutchinson should have filed a placeholder pro se habeas petition is simply not logical when Hutchinson was represented by lawyers who were assuring him that his claims were being pursued.</p>\n<p>However, no matter how diligent Hutchinson was or could have been, as the law stands today, this Court still could not grant Hutchinson the relief of equitable tolling because the Supreme Court has held that, notwithstanding his diligence, a defendant is responsible for and must bear the consequences of his lawyer's negligence.<sup>[1]</sup><i>See </i><i>Lawrence,</i> 549 U.S. at 336-37, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145759\"><a href=\"/opinion/145759/lawrence-v-florida/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

However, as amplified below, none of the key assumptions underlying the application of an agency relationship to a death-sentenced client and his lawyer are valid in the post-conviction context.<sup>[2]</sup> When the law already recognizes equitable exceptions to holding a client responsible for his lawyer's actions under circumstances with less drastic consequences, an exception should also be made for death row inmates so that their lawyer's negligence does not preclude federal review of constitutional claims.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>Agency Principles and Death Row Inmates</i>\n</h2>\n<p>An agency relationship exists to permit one person to act on behalf of another.<sup>[3]</sup> Generally the principal chooses an agent to act on his behalf for a specific purpose,<sup>[4]</sup> and in a traditional lawyer-client relationship, a client hires a lawyer to represent him in a discrete legal matter. The legitimacy of transferring responsibility for the lawyer's negligence from the lawyer to the client is based on several assumptions that underpin the agency relationship. First, it is assumed that the client voluntarily chooses his lawyer for competence, diligence, and loyalty.<sup>[5]</sup> Second, it is assumed that the client has the ability to direct the actions of the lawyer<sup>[6]</sup> or, at the very least, that constant and adequate opportunities exist for communication between the client and his lawyer.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>But these assumptions do not apply to inmates on death row, almost all of whom do not choose their lawyers. Instead they must depend on appointed or pro bono volunteer counsel who too often lack expertise in post-conviction death penalty representation. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Maples,</i> 132 S.Ct. at 918. Consequently, the representation provided in state and federal post-conviction proceedings is too often inadequate.<sup>[8]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1105</span> For example, former Florida Supreme Court Justice Raul Cantero stated that \"some of the [appointed] counsel have little or no experience in death penalty cases. They have not raised the right issues . . . [and] [s]ometimes they raise too many issues and still haven't raised the right ones.\"<sup>[9]</sup> Florida Supreme Court Justice Barbara Pariente has also stated that \"[a]s for [appointed] counsel, we have observed deficiencies and we would definitely endorse the need for increased standards for [appointed] counsel, as well as a continuing system of screening and monitoring to ensure minimum levels of competence.\"<sup>[10]</sup> Likewise, Alabama's death row representation suffers from the same problems. The Supreme Court noted that not only does Alabama set \"low eligibility requirements for lawyers appointed to represent indigent capital defendants at trial,\" <i>Maples,</i> 132 S.Ct. at 917, it is \"[n]early alone\" in not \"guarantee[ing] representation to indigent capital defendants in post-conviction proceedings,\" <i>id.</i> at 918. Instead, Alabama primarily relies on the efforts of out-of-state volunteer lawyers to handle post-conviction representation. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The agency analogy also breaks down because death row inmates have a limited ability to communicate with their lawyers.<sup>[11]</sup> Prisons are often located in far-flung places that are difficult for lawyers to reach and often the lawyers are not even located within the same state as their death row clients. Additionally, inmates have restricted access to phones, the internet, and law libraries. In <i>Lawrence</i> and <i>Holland,</i> it was the lack of access to word processing systems and a law library that hampered the petitioners' ability to communicate <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1106</span> with their attorneys. <i>See</i> Brief for Petitioners at 11 n. 25, <i>Lawrence,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145759\"><a href=\"/opinion/145759/lawrence-v-florida/\"><span class=\"volume\">549</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">327</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145759\"><a href=\"/opinion/145759/lawrence-v-florida/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In Alabama, death row inmates' phone calls are limited to twenty-five minutes, with prison officials determining the schedule and frequency of phone conversations.<sup>[12]</sup> According to Georgia's inmate orientation handbook, phone calls in Georgia prisons are limited to fifteen minutes.<sup>[13]</sup></p>\n<p>Moreover, if a death row inmate is held in a super-maximum security prison or a segregation housing unit (\"SHU\"), which most are, these barriers may be even more difficult to overcome. First, access to basic reading and writing materials may be entirely restricted, depending on how much of a security threat the inmate is deemed to be. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Beard v. Banks,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145626\"><a href=\"/opinion/145626/beard-v-banks/\"><span class=\"volume\">548</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">521</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145626\"><a href=\"/opinion/145626/beard-v-banks/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">697</span></a></span> (2006) (upholding prison regulation that denies access to written material to violent inmates). Second, communication with the outside world becomes even more challenging and more restricted. \"In virtually every state, death-row inmates are `locked down' in their cell for most of the day, have little or no access to educational or other prison programs, and experience great isolation and loss of relationships.\"<sup>[14]</sup> As Justice Kennedy has observed, \"incarceration at [a super-maximum security prison] is synonymous with extreme isolation.\" <i>Wilkinson v. Austin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799975\"><a href=\"/opinion/799975/wilkinson-v-austin/\"><span class=\"volume\">545</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">209</span></a></span>, 214, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799975\"><a href=\"/opinion/799975/wilkinson-v-austin/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Finally, the psychological effects of spending extended periods in solitary confinementcommonly known as SHU syndromemay impair an inmate's mental capabilities to the extent that his active participation in litigation becomes impossible.<sup>[15]</sup></p>\n<p>Finally, even if death row inmates were given the ability to access their attorneys without these formidable obstacles, most death row inmates lack the skills and intellect to supervise, direct or police the activities of their lawyers in the way that the agency paradigm assumes. \"Capital inmates almost uniformly are indigent, and often illiterate and uneducated.\"<sup>[16]</sup> The dangers of these shortcomings are all the more pronounced in the context of federal habeas proceedings, \"the unique and complex nature\" of which the Supreme Court has long recognized. <i>See </i><i>McFarland v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">987</span></a></span> (1983). Even if a client wanted to correct his lawyer's mistakes, he would not be entitled to do so. A prisoner does not have a right to file pro se pleadings while represented by counsel. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Gwiazdzinski,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"753036\"><a href=\"/opinion/753036/united-states-v-raymond-gwiazdzinski-united-states-of-america-v-steven/\"><span class=\"volume\">141</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">784</span></a></span>, 787 (7th Cir.1998). Courts routinely decline to consider pro se pleadings when an inmate is represented by counsel. <i>See </i><i>Downs v. McNeil,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"77952\"><a href=\"/opinion/77952/downs-v-mcneil/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1311</span></a></span>, 1324 (11th Cir.2008) (\"[E]ven a savvy petitioner, who may see the clock running out on his habeas time, can only cajole [or] plead with his counsel to file the petition timely.\") (citations omitted); <i>see also</i> 11th Cir. R. 25-1 (\"When a party is represented by counsel, the clerk may not accept filings from the party.\").<sup>[18]</sup></p>\n<p>These many obstacles render the principal-agent relationship inapplicable in the post-conviction context. An inmate's inability to supervise and control the actions of his lawyer makes this relationship far more akin to the paradigm of an independent contractor than a traditional agency relationship.<sup>[19]</sup> The negligent acts of an independent contractor, unlike those of an agent, are not imputed to the employer for the very reason that the employer lacks the power to meaningfully supervise the contractor.</p>\n<p>The reality of the quality of post-conviction death penalty representation available to indigent inmates on death row does not meet the Supreme Court's recognition that Congress intended these inmates to have access to \"quality legal representation\" when it mandated the statutory right to counsel. <i>McFarland</i> 512 U.S. at 856, 859, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1108</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117873\"><a href=\"/opinion/117873/mcfarland-v-scott/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Congress provided for a statutory right to qualified counsel in federal habeas proceedings in light of the \"seriousness of the possible penalty . . . and the unique and complex nature of the litigation.\" 18 U.S.C. § 3599(d). Indeed, the Supreme Court, recognizing the complexity of federal habeas proceedings, held that the statutory right to counsel must begin even prior to the filing of a federal habeas petition. <i>McFarland,</i> 512 U.S. at 855, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117873\"><a href=\"/opinion/117873/mcfarland-v-scott/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2568</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>The circumstances surrounding Hutchinson's lawyers' negligent filing of his state post-conviction motion in this case illustrate the difficulties faced by a death row inmate who attempts to work diligently with his lawyers. While on death row, Hutchinson maintained communicationto the best of his abilitywith his lawyers and repeatedly asked them to timely file his state post-conviction motion so as to toll the filing deadline for his federal habeas petition.<sup>[20]</sup> Even the majority recognizes that Hutchinson was reasonably diligent up to the time that his lawyers filed his motion for state post-conviction relief. What other steps could Hutchinson reasonably have taken? Should he not have trusted his lawyers when they assured him they were aware of and would comply with all filing deadlines? There is certainly no expectation that a civil client will shadow his lawyer's every move to ensure that all deadlines are met and all filings are in order. On the contrary, a represented client has every right to assume that his lawyer will competently discharge his duties.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, the majority concludes that Hutchinson was not reasonably diligent because he should have filed a pro se federal habeas petition and asked to have it held in abeyance until his efforts to secure state collateral relief were completed. This course of action surely cannot be required of a client when he has legal representation.<sup>[21]</sup> A reasonable prisoner would have <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1109</span> no cause to file his own pleadings for the simple reason that it is assumed that it is his lawyer's job to do so. Especially here, where Hutchinson's lawyers repeatedly assured him that they would file on time, Hutchinson had no reason to pursue an alternative avenue of relief. Reasonably relying on his lawyers' assurances that they were doing what was necessary to protect his federal habeas rights, Hutchinson did not file a pro se federal habeas petition until it was too late.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Exceptions to Client Responsibility for Lawyer's Conduct</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Death row inmates should not be precluded from having their federal claims reviewed because of their lawyer's negligence. Exceptions to the principle that all clients are responsible for the negligence of their lawyers exist elsewhere in the law. For example, when more important countervailing values are at stake, various rules of civil procedure provide courts with discretion to excuse procedural defaults in cases of lawyer negligence. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Dove v.

Death row clients have little ability to hold their lawyers accountable for their negligence. And a policy of punishing death row inmates for such mistakes does not improve the timeliness of lawyers' actions. While civil litigants can seek relief for a lawyer's mistake through a malpractice lawsuit, there is no remedy for a death row inmate. When a lawyer's negligence forecloses consideration of the entirety of the death row inmate's federal claims, the result is the imposition of the death penalty without federal review.</p>\n<p>These cases and examples illustrate that countervailing values forge exceptions in the law. The countervailing value here is the protection of the right to federal review of a death row inmate's federal habeas petition, which is premised, in part, on \"equitable principles [which] have traditionally governed the substantive law of habeas corpus.\" <i>Holland,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 2560 (quotation marks omitted) (holding that the one-year statutory filing deadline for federal habeas petitions is subject to equitable tolling). Thus, in <i>Holland,</i> which presented the same question as is presented here, the Supreme Court framed the inquiry as one of how equity applies while still acknowledging the federal statutory filing deadline. <i>See id.</i> at 2563. The Court noted that the countervailing value of federalism weighs more heavily in the case of failing to comply with a <i>state's</i> procedural rules than it does for equitable tolling of the <i>federal</i> habeas filing deadline which is concerned only \"with <i>federal</i> timing rules.\" <i>Id.</i> With these considerations in mind, the Court rejected a <i>per se</i> approach to the previously unqualified rule that \"a petitioner must bear the risk of attorney error\" in the context of <i>Holland</i>'s case. <i>Id.</i><sup>[22]</sup></p>\n<p>More recently in <i>Maples,</i> 132 S.Ct. at 924, the Court held that a lawyer's conduct that constitutes abandonment of his death row inmate client will also provide the necessary basis for equitable tolling of the federal habeas filing deadline. The Court reached this conclusion, in part, because even agency principles acknowledge an exception to the assumption that a client must bear the risk of the acts or omissions of his lawyer in the case of abandonment. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>However, to grant equitable tolling only in cases of complete lawyer abandonment or something akin to gross negligence does not go far enough. <i>See </i><i>Holland,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 2567 (Alito, J., concurring in the judgment) <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1111</span> (\"Allowing equitable tolling in cases involving gross rather than ordinary attorney negligence would not only fail to make sense in light of our prior cases; it would also be impractical in the extreme. . . . [I]t has been aptly said that gross negligence is ordinary negligence with a vituperative epithet added.\"). Where is the equity in denying the same relief to one inmate just because the acts or omissions of his lawyer were slightly less egregious than another inmate's lawyer? Instead, the reality is that death row inmates' access to competent, post-conviction legal representation is at best inconsistent and at worst non-existent and their ability to communicate freely and actively participate in their litigation is seriously compromised. Under this reality, I question whether strict adherence to the principle that a death row inmate must bear the consequences of his lawyer's negligence is fair or just.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>APPENDIX A</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA PENSACOLA DIVISION</h2>\nJEFFREY GLENN HUTCHINSON, Petitioner,\nv.\nWALTER A.

McCOLLUM, as the Attorney\nGeneral of Florida, Respondents.\n       Case No. 5:09-cv-261-RS\n            Capital Case\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>AFFIDAVIT OF JEFFREY GLENN HUTCHINSON</i></h2>\n<p>I, Jeffrey Glenn Hutchinson, am the Petitioner in the above-styled cause, and hereby affirm that</p>\n<p>1. I make this affidavit in support of my claim that I am entitled to equitable tolling.</p>\n<p>2. On July 1, 2004, the Florida Supreme Court affirmed by convictions and sentences, and on July 22, 2004, the mandate was issued.</p>\n<p>3. In August 2004, Harry Brody and Jeff Hazen, registry lawyers, were appointed to assist me with my postconviction remedies.</p>\n<p>4. On August 10, 2004, I received my first letter from Mr. Brody and Mr. Hazen, and the very next day, I sent them a letter thanking them for taking my case.</p>\n<p>5. On August 18, 2004, I received confirmation that Harry Brody and Jeff Hazen were appointed as my new lawyers, I was excited to hear from them and wrote back the very next day, thanking them for acknowledging my letters; since my previous lawyers had not answered or acknowledged any of my letters.</p>\n<p>6. On September 21, 2004, I had my first meeting with Mr. Hazen, and during that meeting he explained the postconviction process and how he and Mr. Brody planned to get me a new trial and, through that, released from prison.</p>\n<p>7. On October 8, 2004, I had my first meeting with Harry Brody, and during that meeting, Mr. Brody told me, \"Look, we know you're innocent and we're going to get you out of here.\" (His words as I recall them.) This made me so happy that I began to cry. It was the first time that I had a lawyer that I thought would stand up for me. I truly believed Mr. Brody would help to exonerate me.</p>\n<p>8. On October 20, 2004, I had another meeting with Mr. Hazen, and during that meeting, I asked him if he or Mr. Brody had contacted any of the witnesses that would need to be present at the evidentiary <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1112</span> hearing. He told me, \"No,\" but not to worry about that because \"we'll have plenty of time for that later on.\" (His words as I recall them.)</p>\n<p>9. On November 4, 2004, I talked to Mr. Brody during a prearranged phone call, and during that conversation I expressed my concerns regarding the running of 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(1)'s one-year limitations period and the fact that they had not contacted any of the witnesses' that would need to be present at the evidentiary hearing. In response, Mr. Brady told me, \"Don't worry the time, we have almost a year to file the 3.850.\" (His words as I recall them.)</p>\n<p>10. On December 10, 2004, I had another meeting with Mr. Brody, during which I again expressed my concerns about the running of the one-year period of limitations and the fact that they still had not contacted any of the witnesses that would need to be present at the evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p>11. On March 23, 2005, I had another meeting with Mr. Hazen, during which I asked him to file a \"shell-brief to ensure that the one-year limitations period for filing my 2254 petition would not expire, since they still had not contacted any of the witnesses that would need to be present at the evidentiary hearing. At that point Mr. Hazen claimed that \"a shell-brief doesn't provide the protection that it used to\", but he assured me that \"we still have plenty of time to get everything done.\" (His words as I recall them.)</p>\n<p>12. On April 14, 2005, I had another meeting with Harry Brody, during which I asked him pointedly about whether or not they (Mr. Brody and Mr. Hazen) could file my rule 3.651 motion in time to prevent the one-year limitations period from expiring on my 2254 petition. Mr. Brody seemed visibly disoriented and smelled strongly of alcohol, despite the fact that he was eating \"Altoids\" breath mints. I asked him if he had been partying the night before and he changed the subject saying, \"Don't worry about it; we still have plenty of time to file the 3.850.\" (His words as I recall them.)</p>\n<p>13. On May 12, 2005, I had another meeting with Mr. Hazen, during which I again voiced my concerns about nothing being done regarding the witnesses, and again I asked about filing a \"shell-brief to prevent the one-year limitations period from expiring on my 2254 petition, since the rule 3.851 motion was still not ready to file. Mr. Hazen assured me that there was still \"plenty of time\" to file the rule 3.851 motion, and that it \"was not due for several months.\" (His words as I recall them.)</p>\n<p>14. On July 14, 2005, I had a meeting with both Mr. Brody and Mr. Hazen, during which I asked them directly about fifing the rule 3.851 motion (which was <i>still</i> not finished) and why they had still not filed a \"shell-brief to not only allow enough time to investigate all of the evidence and to contact all of the witnesses that would need to testify at the evidentiary hearing, but also to prevent the one-year limitations period from expiring on my 2254 petition. Mr. Brody, who was sweating profusely and smelted of alcohol, became very angry and suddenly got up and left the meeting room. I asked Mr. Hazen, \"What was that all about?\", and Mr. Hazen replied, \"He's just having a lot of personal problems.\" (His words as 1 recall them.)</p>\n<p>15. On September 22, 2005, I had another meeting with both Mr. Brody and Mr. Hazen, during which I told them point blank and in no uncertain terms to \"either file my rule 3.851 motion immediately or I will discharge you and file It myself.\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1113</span> At that point Mr. Brody and Mr. Hazen both assuredpromisedguaranteed me that they would file the motion on or before September 28, 2005, though they went on to say that we had 90 days after the mandate was issued by the Florida Supreme Court, so the rule 3.851 motion was not actually due until \"October 20th.\" (Their words as I recall them.) Once again I told them that if they did not file the rule 3.651 motion <i>immediately,</i> I would file it myself, because that was the only way I could prevent the one-year limitations period from expiring on my 2254 petition. And again both Mr. Brody and Mr. Hazen \"guaranteed\" me that they would file the rule 3.851 motion no later than September 28, 2005.</p>\n<p>16. Had it not been for that premise from Mr. Brody and Mr. Hazen, I would have discharged them and filed a pro se rule 3.851 motion to prevent 26 U.S.C. § 2255(d)(1)'s one-year limitations period from expiring. See exhibits 1 and 2, respectively, facsimiles of the Notice of Pro Se Status and Rule 3.851 Motion that I would have filed on September 23, 2005, but for that promise.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>17. Despite their promise, Mr. Brody end Mr. Hazen did not file my rule 3.851 motion until October 20, 2005 28 days after they promised me that they would do so and 21 days after my one-year period of limitations had expired.</p>\n<p>18. In sum, if Mr. Brody and Mr. Hazen had not lied to me I would have discharged them and personally filed my initial rule 3.851 motion on September 23, 2005, a data which would have tolled the one-year limitations period with six days remainingmaking my initial 2254 petition timely.</p>\n<p>Wherefore, I ask that the relief requested in the petition be granted, or for such other relief as the Court may deem just and proper.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>VERIFICATION OF DOCUMENT</i></h2>\n<p><i>I</i> hereby declare under penalty of perjury that I have read this Affidavit and that the facts and matters stated in it are true and correct.</p>\nExecuted on:\n<i>June 15,</i> 2010.\n            Respectfully submitted,\n            Jeffrey Glenn Hutchinson\n            # 124849-P2214S\n            Union Correctional Institution\n            <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">7819</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">228th</span></span> Street\n            Raiford, FL XXXXX-XXXX\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  By our calculations, the actual deadline should have been September 29, 2005, because that is one year after September 29, 2004, the date on which the judgment of the state court became final under § 2244(d)(1)(A). For some reason, the district court said and the parties say that the deadline was September 30, 2005. Because the difference makes no difference we will use the September 30, 2005 date, too.</p>\n<p>[2]  And it is a good thing that rules of precedent apply here. Even Blackstone, who was something of a fan of equity, warned that:\n</p>\n<p>[T]he liberty of considering all cases in an equitable light, must not be indulged too far; lest thereby we destroy all law, and leave the decision of every question entirely in the breast of the judge. And law, without equity, though hard and disagreeable, is much more desirable for the public good, than equity without law: which would make every judge a legislator, and introduce most infinite confusion; as there would then be almost as many different rules of action laid down in our courts, as there are differences of capacity and sentiment in the human mind.</p>\n<p>1 William Blackstone, <i>Commentaries</i> *62; <i>see also</i> 1 Joseph Story, <i>Commentaries on Equity Jurisprudence</i> § 19, at 16 (13th ed. 1886) (\"If indeed, a Court of Equity in England did possess the unbounded jurisdiction which has been thus generally ascribed to it ... it would be the most gigantic in its sway, and the most formidable instrument of arbitrary power, that could well be devised.\").</p>\n<p>[3]  Any implicit criticism by us of Hutchinson's attorneys for their mistake is tempered by awareness that a panel of this Court made exactly the same mistake a year-and-a-half before those two attorneys did. The opinion in <i>Diaz v. Secretary for the Department of Corrections,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"76526\"><a href=\"/opinion/76526/lazaro-diaz-v-sec-for-the-dept-of-corr/\"><span class=\"volume\">362</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">698</span></a></span> (11th Cir.2004), states that \"[t]he 90-day period in which Diaz could have filed a petition in the United States Supreme Court expired on June 19, 1997, at which time the clock began to run on the one-year limitation for the filing of habeas petitions.\" <i>Id.</i> at 699. The opinion in that case shows, however, that June 19, 1997 was 90 days after the state appellate court's mandate had issued and not 90 days after its opinion had issued, which was 16 days earlier. <i>See id.</i> We do not know if the <i>Diaz</i> opinion confused Hutchinson's counsel or if they were even aware of it. What we do know is that no one is perfect; we all make mistakes.</p>\n<p>[4]  In his affidavit Hutchinson states that before the statute of limitations ran he met with attorney Brody three times, App. A ¶¶ 7, 10, 12, with attorney Hazen four times, <i>id.</i> ¶¶ 6, 8, 11, 13, and with both of them on two other occasions, <i>id.</i> ¶ 14, 15. He states that during one of his meetings with Brody alone, more than five months before the limitations period ran, Brody was \"visibly disoriented and smelled strongly of alcohol,\" <i>id.</i> ¶ 12, and during another meeting two-and-a-half months before the limitations period ran Brody was \"sweating profusely and smelled of alcohol,\" <i>id.</i> ¶ 14. Hutchinson also says that on that later occasion Hazen told him that Brody was \"just having a lot of personal problems.\" <i>Id.</i> But there is no allegation that Brody's impairment, if any, caused the error in miscalculating the due date. <i>See </i><i>Chavez,</i> 647 F.3d at 1071 (holding that equitable tolling was not appropriate where \"[t]here are . . . no allegations at all that [state post-conviction counsel's] health had affected his ability to handle the case up to the time he withdrew or that it had prevented him from filing the motion for state post-conviction relief sooner\"). Nor has Hutchinson alleged that attorney Hazen, who actually signed and filed the Rule 3.851 motion in state court on October 20, 2005, was ever impaired in any way.</p>\n<p>[5]  Hutchinson's affidavit also states that on three occasions, the last of which was July 14, 2005, he asked his attorneys to file a \"shell-brief\" in state court in order to prevent the time from running while they investigated his case and prepared the real motion for state collateral relief. App. A ¶¶ 11, 13, 14. But attorney Hazen told him then that a state court \"shell brief didn't provide the protection that it used to.\" <i>Id.</i> ¶ 11. It appears that Hazen was correct about that. The respondent's brief in this case informs us that in 2001 Florida's Rule 3.851 was amended to prohibit the filing of shell motions, <i>see</i> Fla. R.Crim. P. 3.851(e)(1)(D); <i>Gonzalez v. State,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1705778\"><a href=\"/opinion/1705778/gonzalez-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">990</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1017</span></a></span>, 1034 &amp; n. 9 (Fla.2008), and that shell motions are stricken by the Florida courts and no longer can be used to meet filing deadlines. In his reply brief, Hutchinson does not take issue with any of that information.</p>\n<p>[6]  Although Hutchinson's affidavit and the date of his signature on the federal habeas petition establish beyond dispute that he knew his attorneys had missed the deadline for filing his state petition, our separately writing colleague asserts that Hutchinson had no reason to file his federal habeas petition until nearly four years later because he relied on his attorneys' assurances that they were doing what was necessary to protect his federal habeas rights. <i>See</i> Concurring Op. at 1108-09. That assertion is belied by Hutchinson's own sworn statements, which establish that he knew his attorneys had missed the deadline, yet for years after realizing that he still made no attempt to file in federal court the collateral petition he had already drafted. However judges may feel about the law applicable to this or any other area, we have no license to rewrite the facts of a case.</p>\n<p>[7]  Had Hutchinson done so, the federal district court could have held his federal habeas petition in abeyance until his efforts to secure state collateral relief were completed. <i>See </i><i>Rhines v. Weber,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142884\"><a href=\"/opinion/142884/rhines-v-weber/\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">269</span></a></span>, 278-79, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142884\"><a href=\"/opinion/142884/rhines-v-weber/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">440</span></a></span> (2005). Our colleague's suggestion that a district court might dismiss such a petition without abusing its discretion is contradicted by the only authority she cites for that proposition, which is the <i>Rhines</i> decision. <i>See</i> Concurring Op. at 1108-09 n. 21. The Supreme Court stated in <i>Rhines</i> that:\n</p>\n<p>[I]t likely would be an abuse of discretion for a district court to deny a stay and to dismiss a mixed petition if the petitioner had good cause for his failure to exhaust, his unexhausted claims are potentially meritorious, and there is no indication that the petitioner engaged in intentionally dilatory litigation tactics. In such circumstances, the district court should stay, rather than dismiss, the mixed petition. <i>See </i><i>Rose v. Lundy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110662\"><a href=\"/opinion/110662/rose-v-lundy/\"><span class=\"volume\">455</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">509</span></a></span>, at 522, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110662\"><a href=\"/opinion/110662/rose-v-lundy/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Although Hutchinson kept asking his lawyers to file his state petition, there is nothing to indicate that he knew the precise deadline. It is equally consistent with the facts to believe that he simply wanted his state petition filed and later accepted his attorneys' advice that the deadline was October 20, 2005.</p>\n<p>[21]  Indeed, there is no guarantee that such a placeholder petition would be accepted by the federal district court. <i>See </i><i>Rhines v. Weber,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142884\"><a href=\"/opinion/142884/rhines-v-weber/\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">269</span></a></span>, 277, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142884\"><a href=\"/opinion/142884/rhines-v-weber/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">440</span></a></span> (2005) (\"[S]tay and abeyance should be available only in limited circumstances. . . and is only appropriate when the district court determines there was good cause for the petitioner's failure to present his claims first to the state courts.\"). In a concurring opinion with the judgment in <i>Rhines,</i> Justice Stevens, with whom Justices Ginsburg and Breyer joined, observed that conditioning the stay-and-abeyance procedure on \"good cause\" instead of simply on a lack of \"intentionally dilatory litigation tactics\" left open the door for \"[t]he trickiness of some exhaustion requirements to infect issues of good cause. . . .\" <i>Id.</i> at 279, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142884\"><a href=\"/opinion/142884/rhines-v-weber/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1528</span></a></span>. Moreover, <i>Rhines</i> concerned an issue distinct from the case at hand in which some habeas corpus claims had been exhausted in state court and others had not. The stay-and-abeyance procedure was endorsed in limited circumstances in order to preserve the petitioner's interest in obtaining review of his claims. <i>Id.</i> at 278, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142884\"><a href=\"/opinion/142884/rhines-v-weber/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1528</span></a></span>. In contrast, the good cause inquiry in this case would have involved issues of attorney negligence. In addition, Hutchinson's ability to attempt to prevail upon the stay-and-abeyance procedure turned on both his access to information about the procedure, and a presumption that he did not believe his attorneys' advice that the filing deadline for his application for state post-conviction relief in order to preserve his federal habeas corpus right was on October 20, 2005. Under these circumstances, it is far from certain that Hutchinson would have been granted stay-and-abeyance by a district court applying the good cause standard and unlikely that a panel of this Court would have reversed a district court denial thereof on an abuse of discretion review.</p>\n<p>[22]  The crucial importance of the broader availability of equitable tolling is highlighted by the subsequent developments in Holland's case. Upon eventual remand to the district court, which granted Holland equitable tolling and then considered the merits of the constitutional claims raised in Holland's federal habeas petition, the court granted him habeas relief on his <i>Faretta v.
