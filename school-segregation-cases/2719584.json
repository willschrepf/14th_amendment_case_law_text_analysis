CAMPBELL, JR., JUDGE PRESIDING</center>\r\n</strong>\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong><hr size=\"3\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</strong>\tThe question presented is whether county park rules that ban children's access to\r\na clothing-optional park violate the United States and Texas Constitutions.  <em>See </em>U.S. Const.\r\namend. I, XIV; Tex. Const. art. I, §§ 3, 8, 19, 27.  Central Texas Nudists, Robert A. Morton,\r\nJr., and Christine A. Morton, individually and as next friend of Robert A. Morton, III, Rebecca\r\nE. Morton, and Charles G. Morton, minor children (collectively, \"appellants\") filed suit against\r\nTravis County and the Lower Colorado River Authority, seeking a declaratory judgment and\r\npermanent injunctive relief.  This appeal arises from a judgment denying appellants' motion for\r\nsummary judgment and granting the motions for summary judgment of Travis County and the\r\nLower Colorado River Authority.  We affirm the district court's judgment. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p><strong><center>FACTS</center>\r\n</strong>\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tMcGregor Park<sup>(1)</sup> is a public park owned by the Lower Colorado River Authority\r\nand situated on Lake Travis in Travis County.  The county has managed McGregor Park since the\r\n1980s when it leased the park from the Lower Colorado River Authority.  In 1995, Travis County\r\npromulgated two park rules for McGregor Park, which were adopted by the Commissioners Court\r\nof Travis County.  Recognizing that nude sunbathing occurs in the park, the Commissioners (1)\r\nrestricted access to the park to persons over the age of eighteen and (2) directed:\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p>Any authorization or consent to the nude display of children and the nude display\r\nof adults with children present under the age of eighteen in this park will be treated\r\nas a violation of the law and park rules.  Violators and parties to such violations\r\nwill be investigated and prosecuted if possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p>Because appellants are \"naturists\" who believe that engaging in nude social activities with their\r\nchildren instills values of body acceptance and other naturist values, they contend that these new\r\nrules infringe on their constitutional rights of, <em>inter alia</em>, freedom of expression and privacy, by\r\nprohibiting their children from accompanying them to the park.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tAfter considering each party's motion for summary judgment, the district court\r\ngranted the motions filed by Travis County and the Lower Colorado River Authority and denied\r\nappellants' motion.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong><center>STANDARD OF REVIEW</center>\r\n</strong>\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong><em>\t</em></strong>Because the propriety of a ruling on a motion for summary judgment and the\r\nconstitutionality of a rule raise questions of law, we review these matters <em>de novo</em>.<strong>  <em></em></strong>Texas Med.\r\nLiab. Trust v. Zurich Ins. Co., 945 S.W.2d 839, 842 (Tex. App.--Austin 1997, writ denied);\r\n<em>Armbrister v. Morales</em>, 943 S.W.2d 202, 205 (Tex. App.--Austin 1997, no writ) (citing <em>Barber\r\nv. Colorado Indep. Sch. Dist.</em>, 901 S.W.2d 447, 450 (Tex. 1995)).  The proper inquiry on appeal\r\nis whether the defendant, in seeking summary judgment, fulfilled its initial burden of establishing\r\nthat no genuine issue of material fact exists and that judgment should be granted as a matter of\r\nlaw. <em> City of Houston v. Clear Creek Basin Auth.</em>, 589 S.W.2d 671, 675-79 (Tex. 1979). \r\nEvidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the non-movant.<strong><em>  </em></strong>Nixon v. Mr. Prop. Mgmt. <em>Co.</em>,\r\n690 S.W.2d 546, 548-49 (Tex. 1985)<em>.<strong>  </strong></em>Similarly, all reasonable inferences are indulged and any\r\ndoubts resolved in favor of the non-movant.  <em>Id.</em> at 549.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tWhen each party has filed a motion for summary judgment and the district court\r\nhas granted one motion while denying another, we review the summary judgment proof presented\r\nby each party, determine all questions presented, and \"render such judgment as the trial court\r\nshould have rendered.\" <em> Commissioners Court v. Agan</em>, 940 S.W.2d 77, 80 (Tex. 1997).  \"[W]hen\r\nthere are multiple grounds for summary judgment and the order does not specify the ground on\r\nwhich the summary judgment was granted, the appealing party must negate all grounds on appeal.\" \r\n<em>State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. S.S.</em> <em>&amp; G.W.</em>, 858 S.W.2d 374, 381 (Tex. 1993); <em>accord Carr v.\r\nBrasher</em>, 776 S.W.2d 567, 569 (Tex. 1989).  If the appellant fails to negate each ground on which\r\nthe judgment may have been rendered, we must uphold the summary judgment. <em> See Carr</em>, 776\r\nS.W.2d at 569.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tIn this case, each party filed a motion for summary judgment and the district court\r\ngranted appellees' motions.  Because the trial court did not specify the grounds on which it\r\nrendered judgment, we must affirm the judgment if any of the grounds advanced in the motions\r\nare meritorious. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p></p><center><strong>DISCUSSION</strong><em></em></center>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\tIn their first issue, appellants challenge the constitutionality of the two Travis\r\nCounty park rules, contending that they are facially invalid.  <em>See </em>U.S. Const. amend. I, XIV; Tex.\r\nConst. art. I, §§ 3, 8, 19, 27.<sup>(2)</sup>  Constitutional claims must be examined by looking at the rights\r\nof the class of people who are being excluded from a particular activity.  <em>City of Cleburne v.\r\nCleburne Living Ctr.</em>, 473 U.S. 432, 439 (1985).  Here, both rules exclude individuals under\r\neighteen years of age from entering McGregor Park.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tAppellants assert that the park rules violate naturist families' right to equal\r\nprotection under the United States Constitution. <em> </em>U.S. Const. amend. XIV.  Appellants argue that\r\nby prohibiting minor children from entering the park, even when accompanied by their parents,\r\nthe rules distinguish between classes of individuals on the basis of whether minor children\r\naccompany them to McGregor Park.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tThe Equal Protection Clause requires that all similarly situated persons be treated\r\nalike.  <em>Id.</em>  Courts perform an equal protection inquiry \"if the challenged government action\r\nclassifies or distinguishes between two or more relevant groups.\"  <em>Qutb v. Strauss</em>, 11 F.3d 488,\r\n492 (5th Cir. 1993).  Because the rules treat two groups of individuals differently, we must subject\r\nboth rules to an equal protection inquiry.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tThe first step of this inquiry requires us to determine what burden of justification\r\nmust be satisfied by looking at the interests affected. <em> Zablocki</em> <em>v. Redhail</em>, 434 U.S. 374, 383\r\n(1978).  When a law affects individuals in a suspect classification differently or implicates a\r\nfundamental right, the law must be examined under a strict scrutiny analysis. <em> Plyler v. Doe</em>, 457\r\nU.S. 202, 216-17 (1982); <em>San Antonio Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Rodriguez</em>, 411 U.S. 1, 40 (1973). \r\nAppellants do not argue that these rules treat persons in a suspect classification differently.  For\r\nthe strict scrutiny test to apply here, we must conclude that these rules implicate a fundamental\r\nright.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tAppellants first assert that the park rules interfere with their fundamental right to\r\ndirect the upbringing of their children.  <em>See Pierce v. Society of Sisters</em>, 268 U.S. 510 (1925);<em>\r\nMeyer v. Nebraska</em>, 262 U.S. 390 (1923).  Appellants characterize the rights at issue as involving\r\nan individual's personal choice in matters of family life.  <em>See Griswold v. Connecticut</em>, 381 U.S.\r\n479, 482-84 (1965).  Appellants further contend that a parent's right to raise a child free of state\r\ninterference is within the constitutional protection of privacy secured by the Fourteenth\r\nAmendment.  <em>See id.</em> at 484.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tAppellants also direct our attention to the Supreme Court's recent opinion in <em>Troxel\r\nv. Granville</em>, asserting that it supports their position. <em> Troxel v. Granville</em>, 530 U.S. 57, 120 S.\r\nCt. 2054 (2000).<strong>  </strong>In <em>Troxel</em>, the Court considered a state statute that permitted any person,\r\nincluding a grandparent, to petition for visitation rights at any time.  <em>Id.</em> at 2057.  The Court\r\naffirmed the state supreme court's holdings that \"'parents have a right to limit visitation of their\r\nchildren with third persons'\" and that \"between parents and judges, 'the parents should be the ones\r\nto choose whether to expose their children to certain people or ideas.'\"  <em>Id.</em> at 2059 (quoting <em>In re\r\nSmith</em>, 969 P.2d 21, 31 (Wash. 1998), <em>aff'd sub nom</em>, <em>Troxel v. Granville</em>, 530 U.S. 57, 120 S.\r\nCt. 2054 (2000)).  We read <em>Troxel</em> as affirming a parent's right to direct the upbringing of a child. \r\n<em>Id.</em> at 2059-60 (\"[T]he Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects the fundamental\r\nright of parents to make decisions concerning care, custody, and control of their children.\").\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tBut these parental rights are not absolute.  <em>See, e.g., Ingraham v. Wright</em>, 430 U.S.\r\n651 (1977) (no parental right to demand approval before corporal punishment is inflicted by public\r\nschool teachers and administrators); <em>Planned Parenthood v. Danforth</em>, 428 U.S. 52 (1976) (no\r\nparental right to veto a minor's decision to terminate a pregnancy);<em> Runyon v. McCrary</em>, 427 U.S.\r\n160 (1976) (no parental right to educate children in private segregated academies);<em> Kite v.\r\nMarshall</em>, 661 F.2d 1027 (5th Cir. 1981) (no parental right to send children to summer athletic\r\ncamps).  In <em>Kite v. Marshall</em>, the Fifth Circuit expressly acknowledged that \"parental authority\r\nfalls short of being constitutionally absolute.\"  <em>Kite</em>, 661 F.2d at 1029.  The court further opined\r\nthat<em> </em>these<em> </em>cases exemplify circumstances in which \"the Supreme Court refrained from clothing\r\nparental judgment with a constitutional mantle.\"  <em>Id.</em>\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tWhile we agree with appellants' contentions that the Fourteenth Amendment\r\nencompasses a general right to direct the upbringing of children, we do not agree that these park\r\nrules impede that right.  Neither rule prohibits appellants from raising their children according to\r\nthe naturist philosophy.  Rather, the rules impose a restriction on where the practice of this\r\nphilosophy may occur by establishing an age restriction for admittance to McGregor Park that\r\napplies to all families, whether naturist or not.  Consequently, we reject appellants' arguments\r\nbased on the rights to privacy and to substantive due process.  We now consider appellants'\r\narguments<strong> </strong>that the rules implicate a fundamental right under the First Amendment, namely, the\r\nrights to freedom of association and of expression.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tAppellants claim that both park rules infringe upon their right to associate with their\r\nchildren.  Appellants also assert that \"the associational rights of parents and children are among\r\nthose intimate relationships which are protected by the First Amendment.\"\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tWe recognize that appellants have a right to enter into and maintain certain intimate\r\nhuman relationships.  <em>See, e.g., Roberts v. United States Jaycees</em>, 468 U.S. 609, 617-18 (1984)\r\n(discussing two distinct lines of cases recognizing a right to associate, one related to certain\r\nintimate human relationships and another \"for the purpose of engaging in those activities protected\r\nby the First Amendment--speech, assembly, petition for the redress of grievances, and the exercise\r\nof religion\"); <em>Zablocki</em>, 434 U.S. at 383-86 (marriage); <em>Smith v. Organization of Foster Families</em>,\r\n431 U.S. 816, 844 (1977) (the raising and education of children); <em>Moore v. East Cleveland</em>, 431\r\nU.S. 494, 503-04 (1977) (cohabitation with one's relatives).  However, we fail to see how either\r\npark rule infringes on this right.  The rules do not affect the ability of the Mortons or other\r\nnaturist parents to associate with their children, but regulate only where such associations may\r\noccur.  These rules are analogous to the ordinance in <em>City of Dallas v. Stanglin</em> which barred\r\nminors from certain dance halls. <em> City of Dallas v. Stanglin</em>, 490 U.S. 19, 21 n.2 (1989).\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tAppellants further assert that the park rules violate their right to expressive\r\nassociation as recognized by the Supreme Court in <em>Roberts v. United States Jaycees</em>. <em> Roberts</em>, 468\r\nU.S. at 617-18.  In that case, the Court acknowledged a right to associate for the purpose of\r\nengaging in those activities protected by the First Amendment.  <em>Id.  </em>The issue, then, is whether\r\nthe First Amendment encompasses appellants' activities at McGregor Park.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tAppellants argue that their conduct at McGregor Park constitutes an expressive\r\nactivity and that the park rules violate their right to freedom of expression by impeding their\r\nability to engage in this conduct as a family.  Appellants characterize their nude recreational and\r\nsocial activities at McGregor Park as instilling values in their children in a safe public setting.  On\r\nthe record before us, we find that appellants' First Amendment right to expressive association does\r\nnot encompass their activities at the park.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tThe Supreme Court has acknowledged that nudity itself is not expressive conduct\r\nand is not constitutionally protected. <em> Erznoznick v. City of Jacksonville</em>, 422 U.S. 205, 211 n.7\r\n(1975) (\"Scenes of nudity in a movie, like pictures of nude persons in a book, must be considered\r\nas a part of the whole work.  In this respect, such nudity is distinguishable from the kind of public\r\nnudity traditionally subject to indecent exposure statutes.\" (internal citations omitted)); <em>Barnes v.\r\nGlen Theatre, Inc.</em>, 501 U.S. 560, 581 (1991) (Souter, J., concurring) (\"[Nudity <em>per se</em>] is a\r\ncondition, not an activity . . . .\").\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tAppellants maintain that their naturist conduct at McGregor Park is entitled to First\r\nAmendment protection because it constitutes more than \"mere nudity.\"  At oral argument,\r\nappellants directed our attention to the Supreme Court's recent opinion in<em> Boy Scouts of America\r\nv. Dale</em>. <em> Boy Scouts of Am. v. Dale</em>, __ U.S. __ , 120 S. Ct. 2446, 2452 (2000).  In <em>Dale</em>, the\r\nSupreme Court reviewed a decision by the New Jersey Supreme Court, which held that the state's\r\npublic accommodations law required the Boy Scouts to admit Dale, an avowed homosexual, as an\r\nadult member.  <em>Id. </em>at 2449.  The Court held that \"applying New Jersey's public accommodations\r\nlaw in this way violates the Boy Scouts' First Amendment right of expressive association.\"  <em>Id.</em>\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tAppellants sought to analogize their activities at McGregor Park to those engaged\r\nin by the Boy Scouts.  While appellants and the Boy Scouts may share a common goal to instill\r\nvalues in children, the manner in which these values are transmitted is distinguishable.  The Boy\r\nScouts, as an organization, seeks to transfer its values to its members by \"having its adult leaders \r\nspend time with the youth members, instructing and engaging them in activities like camping,\r\narchery, and fishing.\"  <em>Id.</em> at 2452.  In contrast, appellants seek to convey their values to their\r\nchildren by engaging in swimming, sunbathing, and other forms of recreation in the nude at\r\nMcGregor Park.  Of critical importance to appellants is not the activity itself, but rather, the\r\nmanner in which the activity is conducted--in the nude and in public.  We therefore find that this\r\ncase is distinguishable from <em>Boy Scouts of America v. Dale</em>.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tThe protected activity that appellants claim in this case is identical to the one\r\nasserted in <em>South Florida Free Beaches v. City of Miami</em>.  <em>South Fla. Free Beaches v. City of\r\nMiami</em>, 734 F.2d 608, 608 (11th Cir. 1984).<em> </em> In that case, the plaintiffs argued that nude\r\nsunbathing in a public area is the manner in which they advocate and communicate their\r\nphilosophy that the human body is wholesome and that nudity is not indecent to others. <em> Id. </em>at 609. \r\nThe Eleventh Circuit rejected that argument and held that nude sunbathing is not protected\r\nexpression.  <em>Id.</em> (\"Stripped of constitutional protection, nude sunbathing is subject to legitimate\r\ngovernmental proscriptions.  Thus, we hold that the [F]irst [A]mendment does not clothe these\r\nplaintiffs with a constitutional right to sunbathe in the nude.\"); <em>accord Williams v. Kleppe</em>, 539\r\nF.2d 803, 806 n.9 (1st Cir. 1976) (sanctioning a ban on nude sunbathing by stating, \"[N]o rights\r\nof free speech can be said to have been involved here\").  Likewise, in <em>Hang On, Inc. v. City of\r\nArlington</em>, the Fifth Circuit recognized, \"'[N]udity is protected as speech only when combined with\r\nsome mode of expression which itself is entitled to [F]irst [A]mendment protection.'\"  <em>Hang On,\r\nInc. v. City of Arlington</em>, 65 F.3d 1248, 1254 (5th Cir. 1995) (quoting <em>South Fla. Free Beaches</em>,\r\n734 F.2d at 610).\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tHere, as in <em>South Florida Free Beaches</em>, appellants also seek to garner First\r\nAmendment protection for their efforts to communicate their values that the human body is\r\nwholesome and that nudity is not indecent to others.  Because the facts of this case are\r\nindistinguishable from <em>South Florida Free Beaches</em>, we reach the same conclusion.  For the\r\nreasons stated in <em>South Florida Free Beaches </em>and<em> Hang On</em>, we decline<em> </em>to hold that<em> </em>nude\r\nsunbathing is protected expression.<em> </em> Accordingly, we reject appellants' First Amendment argument\r\nbased on the right to freedom of expression.  In doing so, we also reject appellants' argument that\r\nthe park rules impinge on their right to expressive association.  Consequently, we conclude that\r\nthe park rules do not implicate a fundamental right under the United States Constitution.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tHaving concluded that the strict scrutiny test does not apply here, we must now\r\nidentify whether an intermediate scrutiny or rational basis analysis is appropriate.  On its face, the\r\ngovernment action in this case distinguishes between individuals based solely on age.  Age\r\ndistinctions are subject to the rational relationship test.  <em>Gregory v. Ashcroft</em>, 501 U.S. 452, 470-71 (1991) (referencing <em>Vance v. Bradley</em>, 440 U.S. 93, 97 (1979); <em>Massachusetts Bd. of Ret. v.\r\nMurgia</em>, 427 U.S. 307, 314 (1976)).\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tAn analysis under the rational relationship test is deferential to the government. \r\n<em>Gregory</em>, 501 U.S. at 470-71 (\"In cases where a classification burdens neither a suspect group nor\r\na fundamental interest, 'courts are quite reluctant to overturn governmental action on the ground\r\nthat it denies equal protection of the laws.'\" (citation omitted)); <em>Kite</em>, 661 F.2d at 1030 (\"A state\r\naction viewed under the rational basis banner is presumed to be valid.\").  The government must\r\nprove only that the laws bear \"some rational relationship to a legitimate state purpose.\"  <em>Rodriguez</em>,\r\n411 U.S. at 44; <em>accord</em> <em>Gregory</em>, 501 U.S. at 471.  In examining a city ordinance imposing an age\r\nrestriction on admission to certain dance halls, the Supreme Court stated, \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p>[A] State does not violate the Equal Protection Clause merely because the\r\nclassifications made by its laws are imperfect. If the classification has some\r\n'reasonable basis,' it does not offend the Constitution simply because the\r\nclassification 'is not made with mathematical nicety or because in practice it results\r\nin some inequality.'\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p><em>Stanglin</em>, 490 U.S. at 26-27 (quoting<em> Dandridge v. Williams</em>, 397 U.S. 471, 485 (1970)) (citations\r\nomitted).  We must now determine whether the park rules are justified by a legitimate state\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tAppellants concede in their brief that they do not challenge Travis County's \"right\r\nto regulate the activities of minors and ban unaccompanied minors from [McGregor Park].\"<sup>(3)</sup> \r\nConsistent with their argument that the rules are subject to strict scrutiny, appellants charge instead\r\nthat \"the rules are not narrowly crafted to the least restrictive manner.\"  Appellants claim that the\r\ncurfew ordinance in <em>Qutb </em>was upheld because the law established defenses for infractions of the\r\nordinance, including one that exempted minors accompanied by a parent or guardian.  Unlike this\r\ncase, however, the court in <em>Qutb</em> applied a strict scrutiny analysis to the curfew ordinance after\r\nit \"assume[d] without deciding that the right to move about freely is a fundamental right.\"  <em>Qutb</em>,\r\n11 F.3d at 492.  We have already concluded that the park rules at issue are not subject to a strict\r\nscrutiny analysis; therefore, the government need not satisfy this requirement here.<sup>(4)</sup>  With no\r\ndispute that a legitimate state interest exists for an age restriction, we conclude that the rules do\r\nnot violate the Equal Protection Clause.  Accordingly, we overrule appellants' first issue. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p><strong><em>Exclusion of Summary Judgment Evidence</em></strong>\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tIn their second issue on appeal, appellants maintain that the district court erred\r\nwhen it excluded two items of evidence submitted in support of their motion, namely, a videotape\r\nentitled \"Natural Summer\" and incident reports from Pease Park compiled by the Austin Police\r\nDepartment (\"APD\").  Appellants assert that this evidence rebutted Travis County's contentions\r\nthat McGregor Park incident reports demonstrated an increased risk of sexual offenses against\r\nchildren and that these rules were enacted to achieve legitimate state interests--to protect minors\r\nfrom exposure to sexual offenses and victimization.  The county objected to the APD reports\r\nbecause they detailed incidents occurring at Pease Park, a city park, rather than a county park like\r\nMcGregor Park.  Because the videotape related to parks other than McGregor Park and nudist\r\npractices not at issue here, Travis County also objected to it on the grounds of relevance.  The\r\ndistrict court agreed with Travis County and excluded the APD reports and the videotape as not\r\nrelevant.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tWe apply an abuse of discretion standard to the question of whether a district court\r\nerred in excluding evidence.  <em>City of Brownsville v. Alvarado</em>, 897 S.W.2d 750, 753 (Tex. 1995). \r\nA district court may be reversed under this standard only when a reviewing court finds that \"the\r\ncourt acted in an unreasonable or arbitrary manner.\"  <em>Beaumont Bank, N.A. v. Buller</em>, 806 S.W.2d\r\n223, 226 (Tex. 1991); <em>Downer v. Aquamarine Operators, Inc.</em>, 701 S.W.2d 238, 241-42 (Tex.\r\n1985).  \"A [district] . . . court abuses its discretion when it rules 'without regard for any guiding\r\nrules or principles.'\" <em> Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. v. Malone</em>, 972 S.W.2d 35, 43 (Tex. 1998)\r\n(quoting <em>Alvarado</em>, 897 S.W.2d at 754). \r\n\r\n</p><p>\tWhen seeking to reverse a judgment based on an improper evidentiary ruling, a\r\ncomplaining party \"need not prove that but for the error a different judgment would necessarily\r\nhave been rendered, but only that the error probably resulted in an improper judgment.\" \r\n<em>Alvarado</em>, 897 S.W.2d at 753; <em>accord</em> <em>Malone</em>, 972 S.W.2d at 43.  To prevail, the party must\r\ndemonstrate that \"the judgment turns on the particular evidence excluded or admitted.\"  <em>Alvarado</em>,\r\n897 S.W.2d<em> </em>at 753-54.  We review the entire record to determine whether a party has met this\r\nburden.  <em>Id.</em> at 754.  If any legitimate basis exists to support a district court's evidentiary ruling,\r\nthen we must uphold the court's decision.  <em>Malone</em>, 972 S.W.2d at 43<em>; State Bar v.

The rules define relevant\r\nevidence as \"having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the\r\ndetermination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\" \r\nTex. R. Evid. 401.  In other words, evidence is relevant if it tends to prove or disprove any fact\r\nof consequence, thereby assisting the trier of fact.

I, XIV; Tex. Const. art. I, §§ 3, 8, 19, 27.  Central Texas Nudists, Robert A. Morton,\r\nJr., and Christine A. Morton, individually and as next friend of Robert A. Morton, III, Rebecca\r\nE. Morton, and Charles G. Morton, minor children (collectively, \"appellants\") filed suit against\r\nTravis County and the Lower Colorado River Authority, seeking a declaratory judgment and\r\npermanent injunctive relief.  This appeal arises from a judgment denying appellants' motion for\r\nsummary judgment and granting the motions for summary judgment of Travis County and the\r\nLower Colorado River Authority.  We affirm the district court's judgment. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p><strong><center>FACTS</center>\r\n</strong>\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tMcGregor Park<sup>(1)</sup> is a public park owned by the Lower Colorado River Authority\r\nand situated on Lake Travis in Travis County.  The county has managed McGregor Park since the\r\n1980s when it leased the park from the Lower Colorado River Authority.  In 1995, Travis County\r\npromulgated two park rules for McGregor Park, which were adopted by the Commissioners Court\r\nof Travis County.  Recognizing that nude sunbathing occurs in the park, the Commissioners (1)\r\nrestricted access to the park to persons over the age of eighteen and (2) directed:\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p>Any authorization or consent to the nude display of children and the nude display\r\nof adults with children present under the age of eighteen in this park will be treated\r\nas a violation of the law and park rules.  Violators and parties to such violations\r\nwill be investigated and prosecuted if possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p>Because appellants are \"naturists\" who believe that engaging in nude social activities with their\r\nchildren instills values of body acceptance and other naturist values, they contend that these new\r\nrules infringe on their constitutional rights of, <em>inter alia</em>, freedom of expression and privacy, by\r\nprohibiting their children from accompanying them to the park.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tAfter considering each party's motion for summary judgment, the district court\r\ngranted the motions filed by Travis County and the Lower Colorado River Authority and denied\r\nappellants' motion.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong><center>STANDARD OF REVIEW</center>\r\n</strong>\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong><em>\t</em></strong>Because the propriety of a ruling on a motion for summary judgment and the\r\nconstitutionality of a rule raise questions of law, we review these matters <em>de novo</em>.<strong>  <em></em></strong>Texas Med.\r\nLiab.

I, XIV; Tex.\r\nConst. art. I, §§ 3, 8, 19, 27.<sup>(2)</sup>  Constitutional claims must be examined by looking at the rights\r\nof the class of people who are being excluded from a particular activity.  <em>City of Cleburne v.\r\nCleburne Living Ctr.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111507\"><a href=\"/opinion/111507/cleburne-v-cleburne-living-center-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">432</span></a></span>, 439 (1985).  Here, both rules exclude individuals under\r\neighteen years of age from entering McGregor Park.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tAppellants assert that the park rules violate naturist families' right to equal\r\nprotection under the United States Constitution. <em> </em>U.S. Const. amend. XIV.  Appellants argue that\r\nby prohibiting minor children from entering the park, even when accompanied by their parents,\r\nthe rules distinguish between classes of individuals on the basis of whether minor children\r\naccompany them to McGregor Park.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tThe Equal Protection Clause requires that all similarly situated persons be treated\r\nalike.  <em>Id.</em>  Courts perform an equal protection inquiry \"if the challenged government action\r\nclassifies or distinguishes between two or more relevant groups.\"  <em>Qutb v. Strauss</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"6005\"><a href=\"/opinion/6005/qutb-v-strauss/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">488</span></a></span>,\r\n492 (5th Cir. 1993).  Because the rules treat two groups of individuals differently, we must subject\r\nboth rules to an equal protection inquiry.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tThe first step of this inquiry requires us to determine what burden of justification\r\nmust be satisfied by looking at the interests affected. <em> Zablocki</em> <em>v. Redhail</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109768\"><a href=\"/opinion/109768/zablocki-v-redhail/\"><span class=\"volume\">434</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">374</span></a></span>, 383\r\n(1978).  When a law affects individuals in a suspect classification differently or implicates a\r\nfundamental right, the law must be examined under a strict scrutiny analysis. <em> Plyler v. Doe</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110742\"><a href=\"/opinion/110742/plyler-v-doe/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">202</span></a></span>, 216-17 (1982); <em>San Antonio Indep.

For\r\nthe strict scrutiny test to apply here, we must conclude that these rules implicate a fundamental\r\nright.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tAppellants first assert that the park rules interfere with their fundamental right to\r\ndirect the upbringing of their children.  <em>See Pierce v.

The court further opined\r\nthat<em> </em>these<em> </em>cases exemplify circumstances in which \"the Supreme Court refrained from clothing\r\nparental judgment with a constitutional mantle.\"  <em>Id.</em>\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tWhile we agree with appellants' contentions that the Fourteenth Amendment\r\nencompasses a general right to direct the upbringing of children, we do not agree that these park\r\nrules impede that right.  Neither rule prohibits appellants from raising their children according to\r\nthe naturist philosophy.  Rather, the rules impose a restriction on where the practice of this\r\nphilosophy may occur by establishing an age restriction for admittance to McGregor Park that\r\napplies to all families, whether naturist or not.  Consequently, we reject appellants' arguments\r\nbased on the rights to privacy and to substantive due process.  We now consider appellants'\r\narguments<strong> </strong>that the rules implicate a fundamental right under the First Amendment, namely, the\r\nrights to freedom of association and of expression.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tAppellants claim that both park rules infringe upon their right to associate with their\r\nchildren.  Appellants also assert that \"the associational rights of parents and children are among\r\nthose intimate relationships which are protected by the First Amendment.\"\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tWe recognize that appellants have a right to enter into and maintain certain intimate\r\nhuman relationships.  <em>See, e.g., Roberts v.

However, we fail to see how either\r\npark rule infringes on this right.  The rules do not affect the ability of the Mortons or other\r\nnaturist parents to associate with their children, but regulate only where such associations may\r\noccur.  These rules are analogous to the ordinance in <em>City of Dallas v. Stanglin</em> which barred\r\nminors from certain dance halls. <em> City of Dallas v. Stanglin</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112240\"><a href=\"/opinion/112240/dallas-v-stanglin/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span>, 21 n.2 (1989).\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tAppellants further assert that the park rules violate their right to expressive\r\nassociation as recognized by the Supreme Court in <em>Roberts v. United States Jaycees</em>. <em> Roberts</em>, 468\r\nU.S. at 617-18.  In that case, the Court acknowledged a right to associate for the purpose of\r\nengaging in those activities protected by the First Amendment.  <em>Id.  </em>The issue, then, is whether\r\nthe First Amendment encompasses appellants' activities at McGregor Park.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tAppellants argue that their conduct at McGregor Park constitutes an expressive\r\nactivity and that the park rules violate their right to freedom of expression by impeding their\r\nability to engage in this conduct as a family.  Appellants characterize their nude recreational and\r\nsocial activities at McGregor Park as instilling values in their children in a safe public setting.  On\r\nthe record before us, we find that appellants' First Amendment right to expressive association does\r\nnot encompass their activities at the park.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tThe Supreme Court has acknowledged that nudity itself is not expressive conduct\r\nand is not constitutionally protected. <em> Erznoznick v.

Dale</em>. <em> Boy Scouts of Am. v.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2446</span></a></span>, 2452 (2000).  In <em>Dale</em>, the\r\nSupreme Court reviewed a decision by the New Jersey Supreme Court, which held that the state's\r\npublic accommodations law required the Boy Scouts to admit Dale, an avowed homosexual, as an\r\nadult member.  <em>Id. </em>at 2449.  The Court held that \"applying New Jersey's public accommodations\r\nlaw in this way violates the Boy Scouts' First Amendment right of expressive association.\"  <em>Id.</em>\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tAppellants sought to analogize their activities at McGregor Park to those engaged\r\nin by the Boy Scouts.  While appellants and the Boy Scouts may share a common goal to instill\r\nvalues in children, the manner in which these values are transmitted is distinguishable.  The Boy\r\nScouts, as an organization, seeks to transfer its values to its members by \"having its adult leaders \r\nspend time with the youth members, instructing and engaging them in activities like camping,\r\narchery, and fishing.\"  <em>Id.</em> at 2452.  In contrast, appellants seek to convey their values to their\r\nchildren by engaging in swimming, sunbathing, and other forms of recreation in the nude at\r\nMcGregor Park.  Of critical importance to appellants is not the activity itself, but rather, the\r\nmanner in which the activity is conducted--in the nude and in public.  We therefore find that this\r\ncase is distinguishable from <em>Boy Scouts of America v. Dale</em>.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tThe protected activity that appellants claim in this case is identical to the one\r\nasserted in <em>South Florida Free Beaches v. City of Miami</em>.  <em>South Fla. Free Beaches v. City of\r\nMiami</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"435881\"><a href=\"/opinion/435881/south-florida-free-beaches-inc-a-florida-non-profit-corp-and-gary/\"><span class=\"volume\">734</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">608</span></a></span>, 608 (11th Cir. 1984).<em> </em> In that case, the plaintiffs argued that nude\r\nsunbathing in a public area is the manner in which they advocate and communicate their\r\nphilosophy that the human body is wholesome and that nudity is not indecent to others. <em> Id. </em>at 609. \r\nThe Eleventh Circuit rejected that argument and held that nude sunbathing is not protected\r\nexpression.  <em>Id.</em> (\"Stripped of constitutional protection, nude sunbathing is subject to legitimate\r\ngovernmental proscriptions.  Thus, we hold that the [F]irst [A]mendment does not clothe these\r\nplaintiffs with a constitutional right to sunbathe in the nude.\"); <em>accord Williams v.

Likewise, in <em>Hang On, Inc. v. City of\r\nArlington</em>, the Fifth Circuit recognized, \"'[N]udity is protected as speech only when combined with\r\nsome mode of expression which itself is entitled to [F]irst [A]mendment protection.'\"  <em>Hang On,\r\nInc. v.

Because the facts of this case are\r\nindistinguishable from <em>South Florida Free Beaches</em>, we reach the same conclusion.  For the\r\nreasons stated in <em>South Florida Free Beaches </em>and<em> Hang On</em>, we decline<em> </em>to hold that<em> </em>nude\r\nsunbathing is protected expression.<em> </em> Accordingly, we reject appellants' First Amendment argument\r\nbased on the right to freedom of expression.  In doing so, we also reject appellants' argument that\r\nthe park rules impinge on their right to expressive association.  Consequently, we conclude that\r\nthe park rules do not implicate a fundamental right under the United States Constitution.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tHaving concluded that the strict scrutiny test does not apply here, we must now\r\nidentify whether an intermediate scrutiny or rational basis analysis is appropriate.  On its face, the\r\ngovernment action in this case distinguishes between individuals based solely on age.  Age\r\ndistinctions are subject to the rational relationship test.  <em>Gregory v.

We must now determine whether the park rules are justified by a legitimate state\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tAppellants concede in their brief that they do not challenge Travis County's \"right\r\nto regulate the activities of minors and ban unaccompanied minors from [McGregor Park].\"<sup>(3)</sup> \r\nConsistent with their argument that the rules are subject to strict scrutiny, appellants charge instead\r\nthat \"the rules are not narrowly crafted to the least restrictive manner.\"  Appellants claim that the\r\ncurfew ordinance in <em>Qutb </em>was upheld because the law established defenses for infractions of the\r\nordinance, including one that exempted minors accompanied by a parent or guardian.  Unlike this\r\ncase, however, the court in <em>Qutb</em> applied a strict scrutiny analysis to the curfew ordinance after\r\nit \"assume[d] without deciding that the right to move about freely is a fundamental right.\"  <em>Qutb</em>,\r\n11 F.3d at 492.  We have already concluded that the park rules at issue are not subject to a strict\r\nscrutiny analysis; therefore, the government need not satisfy this requirement here.<sup>(4)</sup>  With no\r\ndispute that a legitimate state interest exists for an age restriction, we conclude that the rules do\r\nnot violate the Equal Protection Clause.  Accordingly, we overrule appellants' first issue. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p><strong><em>Exclusion of Summary Judgment Evidence</em></strong>\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tIn their second issue on appeal, appellants maintain that the district court erred\r\nwhen it excluded two items of evidence submitted in support of their motion, namely, a videotape\r\nentitled \"Natural Summer\" and incident reports from Pease Park compiled by the Austin Police\r\nDepartment (\"APD\").  Appellants assert that this evidence rebutted Travis County's contentions\r\nthat McGregor Park incident reports demonstrated an increased risk of sexual offenses against\r\nchildren and that these rules were enacted to achieve legitimate state interests--to protect minors\r\nfrom exposure to sexual offenses and victimization.  The county objected to the APD reports\r\nbecause they detailed incidents occurring at Pease Park, a city park, rather than a county park like\r\nMcGregor Park.  Because the videotape related to parks other than McGregor Park and nudist\r\npractices not at issue here, Travis County also objected to it on the grounds of relevance.  The\r\ndistrict court agreed with Travis County and excluded the APD reports and the videotape as not\r\nrelevant.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tWe apply an abuse of discretion standard to the question of whether a district court\r\nerred in excluding evidence.  <em>City of Brownsville v.
