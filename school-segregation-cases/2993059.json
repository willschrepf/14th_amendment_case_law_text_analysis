THE BOARD OF\nEDUCATION, LINCOLN WAY COMMUNITY HIGH SCHOOL\nDISTRICT No. 210 et al. (The Illinois State Board of Education et\n                       al., Appellants).\n\n                  Opinion filed October 17, 2008.\n\n\n\n   JUSTICE GARMAN delivered the judgment of the court, with\nopinion.\n   Chief Justice Fitzgerald and Justices Thomas, Kilbride, Karmeier,\nand Burke concurred in the judgment and opinion.\n   Justice Freeman specially concurred, with opinion.\n\n\n\n                             OPINION\n\n    In 1998, the registered voters of a 320-acre parcel of land in Will\nCounty filed a petition to detach the parcel from Joliet Township\nHigh School District No. 204 and annex it to Lincoln Way\nCommunity High School District No. 210, pursuant to section 7–2b\nof the Illinois School Code (105 ILCS 5/7–2b (West 1998)). District\n204 objected to the petition and argued inter alia that section 7–2b\nviolates the Equal Educational Opportunities Act of 1974 (EEOA)\n(20 U.S.C. §1701 et seq. (2000)). The hearing officer for the Illinois\n\fState Board of Education (Board) found that the conditions of section\n7–2b were met and recommended that the petition be granted. District\n204’s EEOA claim was not considered when the hearing officer made\nthis recommendation, as the hearing officer found that the claim was\noutside the scope of the Board’s authority under section 7–2b. The\nBoard accepted the hearing officer’s findings and granted the petition\nfor detachment/annexation. The circuit court of Will County affirmed\nthe Board’s order and found that the order did not violate the\nconstitution or federal statute. On appeal, the appellate court found\nthat section 7–2b was preempted by the EEOA and was, therefore,\nunconstitutional. 373 Ill. App. 3d 563. The appellate court remanded\nthe cause to the Board to consider District 204’s EEOA claim. The\nBoard filed a petition for leave to appeal pursuant to Supreme Court\nRules 317 (210 Ill. 2d R. 317) and 315 (210 Ill. 2d R. 315). This court\ngranted the Board’s petition and for the following reasons, we reverse\nthe judgment of the appellate court and remand the cause to the\ncircuit court for consideration of District 204’s EEOA claim.\n\n                           BACKGROUND\n    In July of 1998, four individuals who made up all of the registered\nvoters of a contiguous 320-acre parcel of farm land in Will County\nfiled a petition with the Illinois State Board of Education (Board) to\ndetach their property from Joliet Township High School District No.\n204 (District 204) and attach it to Lincoln Way Community High\nSchool District No. 210, pursuant to section 7–2b of the Illinois\nSchool Code (105 ILCS 5/7–2b (West 1998)).\n    The parcel of land in question is situated in an area of the state\nwhere the grade schools and high schools are split into separate\nschool districts and the boundaries of these districts are not\ncoterminous. The children who reside on the disputed parcel of land\ncurrently attend grade school in the New Lenox Elementary School\nDistrict No. 122. The high school district that generally serves the\nNew Lenox Elementary School District is Lincoln Way Community\nHigh School District No. 210. However, the parcel of land in question\ndoes not fall within the boundaries of High School District 210, it\nfalls within the boundaries of Joliet High School District No. 204.\nThus the children who reside on the parcel will not attend the same\nhigh school as the majority of their former grade school classmates.\n\n                                 -2-\n\f    Section 7–2b allows for the detachment of land from one district\nand annexation to another where the affected land lies within\nelementary and high school districts with noncoterminous boundaries.\nSection 7–2b allows the land to be detached and annexed at either the\nelementary or high school level. Thus, it is the petitioner’s choice\nwhich district they leave and which they join. 105 ILCS 5/7–2b(a)\n(West 1998). A parcel of land is eligible for detachment and\nannexation only if (1) it represents 10% or less of the equalized\nassessed value of the district; (2) the parcel constitutes 10% or less of\nthe territory of the district;1 (3) two-thirds of the registered voters of\nthe parcel support the petition; and (4) the annexation will make the\nboundaries of the grade school and high school districts for the\naffected parcel identical. 105 ILCS 5/7–2b(a) (West 1998). Before\nthis court, neither party disputes that these four conditions are met.\n    Before the Board’s hearing officer, District 204 argued inter alia\nthat the detachment and annexation of the parcel increased\nsegregation in violation of the Equal Educational Opportunities Act\nof 1974. 20 U.S.C. §1701 et seq. (2000). The EEOA prohibits a state\nfrom denying “equal educational opportunity to an individual on\naccount of his or her race, color, sex, or national origin.” 20 U.S.C.\n§1703 (2000). The EEOA delineates a number of activities that\nconstitute discrimination. Among these are the assignment of a\nstudent to a school within the district in which he or she resides other\nthan the one closest to his or her residence “if the assignment results\nin a greater degree of segregation.” 20 U.S.C. §1703(c) (2000). The\nEEOA also prohibits the transfer of a student from one school to\nanother if “the purpose and effect of such transfer is to increase the\nsegregation of students.” 20 U.S.C. §1703(e) (2000).\n    District 204 claimed the detachment and annexation of the parcel\nincreases segregation because the four individuals who petitioned for\nannexation are white while the population of District 204, from which\n\n\n\n  1\n    Section 7–2b has subsequently been amended to reduce the percentage\nof both value and land mass that may be detached. Under the new law, the\nland to be detached may constitute no more than 5% of the assessed value\nand territory of the district. 105 ILCS 5/7–2b (West 2006). This change has\nno impact on this decision.\n\n                                   -3-\n\fthey seek to be detached, is “60% minority.”2 District 204 further\nasserted that allowing the “land to be detached *** from a largely\nminority school district (60%) and annexed to an almost completely\nwhite school district” would increase segregation based on race. On\nthis basis, District 204 described section 7–2b as a “mechanism for\n‘white flight’ ” and stated that it fostered “division among the races”\nin violation of the EEOA.\n    The hearing officer refused to hear District 204’s EEOA claim\nbecause section 7–2b contains a limiting clause that prohibits the\nBoard from hearing any evidence or considering any issue except\nthose necessary to determine if the four conditions of section 7–2b\nhave been met. See 105 ILCS 5/7–2b (West 1998) (“The [Board]\nshall have no authority or discretion to hear any evidence or consider\nany issues except those that may be necessary to determine whether\nthe limitations and conditions of this Section have been met”). The\nhearing officer expressly stated in his proposed findings of fact and\nconclusions of law that District 204’s EEOA claim was “beyond the\nscope of the [Board’s], and by extension the Hearing Officer’s\nauthority.”3 The Board accepted the hearing officer’s findings of fact\nand conclusions of law and granted the section 7–2b petition.\nThereafter, District 204 filed a complaint for administrative review\nwith the circuit court.\n    On administrative review, the circuit court confirmed the Board’s\ndecision to grant the petition, noting that there was “no Constitutional\nproblem with the actions of the [Board].” The circuit court also stated\nthat “mere suspicion” is not sufficient to establish racial motivation.\nDistrict 204 appealed this ruling.\n\n\n\n   2\n     Because of the procedural history of this case, District 204 has never\nhad the opportunity to establish the truth of these statements. While this\ncourt takes no position on the veracity of these assertions, we include them\nto illustrate the basis of District 204’s EEOA claim.\n   3\n    Public Act 91–46, which became effective on June 30, 1999, changed\nthe body responsible for reviewing a section 7–2b petition from the Illinois\nState Board of Education to the Regional Board of School Trustees. This\nmodification has no bearing on this opinion.\n\n                                    -4-\n\f     On appeal, the appellate court affirmed that the EEOA claim was\nbeyond the Board’s authority, but vacated the circuit court’s ruling on\nthe merits of the EEOA claim and remanded the cause to the hearing\nofficer to develop a record on the EEOA claim.\n     The appellate court agreed that the limiting clause of section 7–2b\nprohibited the Board from hearing or considering District 204’s\nEEOA claim. Specifically, the appellate court held that the Board\n“acted in accord with its mandate when it refused to determine\nwhether section 7–2b or the proposed detachment/annexation violated\nthe [EEOA].” 373 Ill. App. 3d at 568.\n     The appellate court went on to conclude that section 7–2b not\nonly stripped the Board of jurisdiction over the EEOA claim, but also\ndenied jurisdiction over the claim to the circuit court under\nadministrative review law. The appellate court noted that the circuit\ncourt’s power to review the decisions of administrative agencies is\nlimited in scope to the statutory powers provided by the General\nAssembly. 373 Ill. App. 3d at 569, quoting Ill. Const. 1970, art. VI,\n§9 (“Circuit Courts shall have such power to review administrative\naction as provided by law”). The Code of Civil Procedure provides\nthat a hearing for administrative review is limited to questions of law\nand fact that are presented to the court by the record. “No new or\nadditional evidence *** shall be heard by the court.” 735 ILCS\n5/3–110 (West 2006). The appellate court reasoned that because\nsection 7–2b limited the Board’s authority to reviewing only the\nprocedural requirements for a petition for detachment and annexation,\nthe circuit court’s authority on administrative review was similarly\n“limited to determining whether the Board erred in finding those\nrequirements met.” 373 Ill. App. 3d at 570. Accordingly, the appellate\ncourt vacated the circuit court’s determination that the Board’s\nactions did not violate federal law, reasoning that the Board itself “did\nnot have jurisdiction to even develop a record which the circuit court\ncould then rely upon in formulating any constitutional decision.” 373\nIll. App. 3d at 570. Thus, the “circuit court lacked both the\njurisdiction and the evidence to make such an independent finding.”\n373 Ill. App. 3d at 569.\n     Finally, the appellate court found that section 7–2b was\npreempted by the EEOA and remanded the cause to the Board to\nconduct a hearing on District 204’s EEOA claim. The appellate court\n\n                                  -5-\n\fnoted that “ ‘state law is nullified to the extent that it actually\nconflicts with federal law.’ ” 373 Ill. App. 3d at 572, quoting Fidelity\nFederal Savings & Loan Ass’n v. de la Cuesta, 458 U.S. 141, 153, 73\nL. Ed. 2d 664, 675, 102 S. Ct. 3014, 3022 (1982). The appellate court\nnoted that the right of a student to be assigned to a school on the basis\nof geography and not race, as provided in the EEOA, could not be\nnullified by state action. Thus, the court reasoned that section 7–2b’s\n“restricting the Board’s ability to hear claims of racial segregation,\n‘ “stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the\nfull purposes and objectives of [the EEOA.]” ’ ” 373 Ill. App. 3d at\n572, quoting Fidelity Federal Savings & Loan Ass’n, 458 U.S. at 153,\n73 L. Ed. 2d at 675, 102 S. Ct. at 3022, quoting Hines v. Davidowitz,\n312 U.S. 52, 67-68, 85 L. Ed. 581, 587, 61 S. Ct. 399, 404 (1941).\nTherefore, the appellate court found that section 7–2b’s limitation\nclause was preempted by the EEOA under the supremacy clause of\nthe United States Constitution and remanded the cause to the Board\nfor further consideration. 373 Ill. App. 3d at 573.\n    In its petition for leave to appeal to this court, the Board argues\nthat the appellate court erred in holding that section 7–2b was\npreempted by the EEOA. We granted the Board’s petition. For the\nfollowing reasons, we reverse the decision of the appellate court.\n\n                      QUESTION PRESENTED\n    Both parties agree that District 204’s EEOA claim must be heard\nand decided by a body of competent jurisdiction. The parties disagree\nover the proper means of effectuating this hearing.\n    The Board, as appellant, takes the position that the EEOA does\nnot require the Board to review EEOA claims and that these claims\nare better developed in and decided by the circuit court. Conversely,\nDistrict 204 argues that the EEOA mandates that an “educational\nagency,” in this case the Board, consider its EEOA claim. Therefore,\nDistrict 204 asserts that the appellate court was correct and that\nsection 7–2b must be preempted because it conflicts with the EEOA\nby prohibiting the Board from hearing the EEOA claim.\n    District 204 further argues that the Board’s position is infeasible,\nas the circuit court is prohibited from considering its EEOA claims\nbecause administrative review is the exclusive means of reviewing an\n\n                                  -6-\n\fadministrative decision and section 7–2b prevents the development\nof a record that is sufficient given the limited scope of administrative\nreview. Thus, District 204 argues that the current legislative\nframework is preempted because it is intentionally crafted to make it\n“impossible for a factual record regarding the effect of segregation to\nbe considered when determining whether to grant a petition for\ndetachment.” District 204 notes that “[s]tates have an affirmative duty\nto take measures to comply with the mandate set forth in the EEOA,”\nand that the current legislative framework represents the General\nAssembly’s “naked attempt to sidestep the federal mandate set forth\nin the EEOA.”\n     There are then two areas of dispute between the parties. First, the\nparties argue whether the EEOA requires that the Board consider the\nEEOA in granting a petition for detachment/annexation. Second, if\nthe Board does not have to consider the EEOA, the parties dispute\nwhether the circuit court can review an alleged violation outside of\nadministrative review.\n     The resolution of both arguments turns on the constitutional law\ndoctrine of preemption. However, in the first argument, preemption\nis only implicated if we agree with District 204’s interpretation of the\nEEOA. Therefore, the initial question presented for the first argument\nis a question of statutory interpretation, as this court must determine\nwhat the EEOA mandates of an “educational agency.”\n     The second argument presents a question of preemption, as this\ncourt must determine whether the current legislative framework\ncreates a situation where the state can avoid compliance with “the\nmandate set forth in the EEOA.”\n\n                     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n     Whether state law is preempted by a federal statute is a question\nof law, which is subject to de novo review. Kinkel v. Cingular\nWireless, LLC, 223 Ill. 2d 1, 15 (2006), citing Schultz v. Northeast\nIllinois Regional Commuter R.R. Corp., 201 Ill. 2d 260, 288 (2002).\nSimilarly, questions of statutory interpretation present questions of\nlaw and are therefore reviewed de novo. Harshman v. DePhillips, 218\nIll. 2d 482, 490 (2006).\n\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\f                               ANALYSIS\n    The underlying basis of both arguments is preemption. The\npreemption doctrine originates with the supremacy clause of article\nVI of the United States Constitution, which provides that the “Laws\nof the United States *** shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and\nJudges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the\nConstitution or laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.”\nU.S. Const., art. VI, cl. 2. Thus, when state law conflicts with a\nfederal statute, state law is preempted by the supremacy clause and its\napplication is unconstitutional. Crosby v. National Foreign Trade\nCouncil, 530 U.S. 363, 388, 147 L. Ed. 2d 352, 371, 120 S. Ct. 2288,\n2302 (2000); see also Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. Reilly, 533 U.S. 525,\n540, 150 L. Ed. 2d 532, 550, 121 S. Ct. 2404, 2414 (2001).\n    A state statute may be preempted in three situations. First, a\nstatute may be preempted through the express language of a\ncongressional enactment. Lorillard Tobacco Co., 533 U.S. at 540-41,\n150 L. Ed. 2d at 550, 121 S. Ct. at 2414, citing Cipollone v. Liggett\nGroup, Inc., 505 U.S. 504, 120 L. Ed. 2d 407, 112 S. Ct. 2608 (1992).\nA state statute may also be preempted where the “depth and breadth\nof a congressional scheme” implies that Congress “occupies the\nlegislative field.” Lorillard Tobacco Co., 533 U.S. at 541, 150 L. Ed.\n2d at 550, 121 S. Ct. at 2414; see also Fidelity Federal Savings &\nLoan Ass’n v. de la Cuesta, 458 U.S. 141, 73 L. Ed. 2d 664, 102 S.\nCt. 3014 (1982). Finally, a statute may be preempted where the state\nlaw presents a “conflict with a congressional enactment.” Lorillard\nTobacco Co., 533 U.S. at 541, 150 L. Ed. 2d at 550, 121 S. Ct. at\n2414; see also Geier v. American Honda Motor Co., 529 U.S. 861,\n146 L. Ed. 2d 914, 120 S. Ct. 1913 (2000).\n    In the present case, only the latter form of preemption, conflict\npreemption, is at issue. Conflict preemption occurs where “ ‘under\nthe circumstances of [a] particular case, [the challenged state law]\nstands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full\npurposes and objectives of Congress.’ ” Crosby, 530 U.S. at 373, 147\nL. Ed. 2d at 361, 120 S. Ct. at 2294, quoting Hines, 312 U.S. at 67,\n85 L. Ed. at 587, 61 S. Ct. at 404. An obstacle to a congressional\nobjective is sufficient to find preemption when a state law would\noperate in a way that a federal statute, when considered as a whole,\nwould be rendered ineffective and its purpose and intended effects\n\n                                 -8-\n\ffrustrated. Crosby, 530 U.S. at 373, 147 L. Ed. 2d at 361, 120 S. Ct.\nat 2294 (citing Savage v. Jones, 225 U.S. 501, 533, 56 L. Ed. 1182,\n1195, 32 S. Ct. 715, 726 (1912), and Hines, 312 U.S. at 67 n.20, 85\nL. Ed. at 587 n.20, 61 S. Ct. at 404 n.20).\n    In the present case, the Board asserts that the appellate court erred\nin finding preemption on two bases. First, that the EEOA does not\nrequire that the Board, as an “educational agency,” consider the\nsegregative effect that a section 7–2b petition would have on the\nparties. Second, that review of District 204’s EEOA claim can be had\noutside of administrative review under the circuit court’s original\njurisdiction. We will address each argument in turn.\n\n                                     I\n     The first argument presented by the Board that the appellate court\nerred in finding that the EEOA preempts section 7–2b is that “nothing\nin the EEOA specifically requires [EEOA] claims to be decided by\nthe [Board], rather than by a circuit court.” Under the Board’s view,\nthe two statutes do not directly conflict and, therefore, the limiting\nclause of section 7–2b is constitutional.\n     District 204, in reply, argues that the EEOA requires an\n“educational agency” to consider racial segregation in making school\nassignment decisions. Thus, District 204 argues that section 7–2b’s\nlimiting clause prevents the Board from considering the EEOA and\nis thus preempted.\n     Both parties agree that section 7–2b’s limiting clause prevents the\nBoard from considering the EEOA in making decisions on\ndetachment/annexation petitions. The limiting clause of section 7–2b\nstates that the Board “shall have no authority or discretion to hear any\nevidence or consider any issues except those that may be necessary to\ndetermine whether the limitations and conditions of this Section have\nbeen met.” 105 ILCS 5/7–2b (West 1998). As noted previously,\nsection 7–2b contains four provisions that must be met before a\npetition for detachment/annexation can be granted. EEOA compliance\nis not among these four factors. See 105 ILCS 5/7–2b (West 1998).\n     However, the parties disagree as to what the EEOA requires of\n“educational agencies.” District 204 cites to section 1703 of the\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\fEEOA to support its conclusion that educational agencies are required\nto enforce the EEOA. Section 1703 states:\n             “No State shall deny equal educational opportunity to an\n         individual on account of his or her race, color, sex, or national\n         origin, by–\n                 (a) the deliberate segregation by an educational\n             agency of students on the basis of race, color, or national\n             origin among or within schools;\n                  ***\n                  (c) the assignment by an educational agency of a\n             student to a school, other than the one closest to his or her\n             place of residence within the school district in which he\n             or she resides, if the assignment results in a greater degree\n             of segregation *** than would result if such students were\n             assigned to the school closest to his or her place of\n             residence ***.” (Emphases added.) 20 U.S.C. §1703\n             (2000).\nDistrict 204 reads section 1703 as a requirement that the Board, as an\neducational agency,4 not only refrain from engaging in discriminatory\nconduct, but affirmatively consider whether a proposed\ndetachment/annexation petition would violate the EEOA.\n    The resolution of this argument rests on statutory interpretation\ngrounds, as this court must decide whether Congress intended to\ncharge “educational agencies” with an affirmative duty to consider\nthe EEOA before making an administrative decision.\n    The goal of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and give effect\nto the intent of the legislative body. The simplest and surest means of\neffectuating this goal is to read the statutory language itself and give\nthe words their plain and ordinary meaning. Illinois Graphics Co. v.\nNickum, 159 Ill. 2d 469, 479 (1994). A statute must be read in its\nentirety, keeping in mind the subject it addresses and the legislature’s\napparent objective in enacting it. Gill v. Miller, 94 Ill. 2d 52, 56\n\n  4\n    The parties agree that the Board is an “educational agency” as defined\nby the EEOA and the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965.\nSee 20 U.S.C. §1720(a) (2000), and 20 U.S.C. §7801(26)(A), (26)(E)\n(Supp. 2005).\n\n                                  -10-\n\f(1983). Where the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous,\nit must be applied as written, without resort to other tools of statutory\nconstruction. Raintree Homes, Inc. v. Village of Long Grove, 209 Ill.\n2d 248, 255 (2004).\n     The EEOA is a remedial statute designed to “specify appropriate\nremedies for the orderly removal of the vestiges of the dual school\nsystem.” 20 U.S.C. §1701(b) (2000). A “dual school system” is one\n“in which students are assigned to schools solely on the basis of race,\ncolor, sex, or national origin.” 20 U.S.C. §1702(a)(1) (2000). The\nremedies specified by Congress as part of the EEOA are “not\nintended to modify or diminish the authority of the courts of the\nUnited States.” 20 U.S.C. §1702(b) (2000).\n     Section 1703 of the EEOA expressly forbids the states from\ndenying equal educational opportunity when it states that “[n]o State\nshall deny equal educational opportunity to an individual on account\nof his or her race, color, sex, or national origin.” 20 U.S.C. §1703\n(2000). The EEOA goes on to list a number of ways that a state can\ndeny equal educational opportunity. Each of these examples\nanticipates that an “educational agency” has undertaken the\ndiscriminatory action or failed to rectify previous discriminatory\nactions. (I.e., “the failure of an educational agency *** to take\naffirmative steps *** to remove the vestiges of a dual school system”\n(20 U.S.C. §1703(b) (2000)) and “discrimination by an educational\nagency *** in the employment, employment conditions, or\nassignment to schools of its faculty or staff” (20 U.S.C. §1703(d)\n(2000)).)\n     The EEOA views “educational agencies” as the political\nsubdivision of the state that is either engaging in discrimination or\nfailing to rectify past discrimination. The EEOA defines an\n“educational agency” as “a local educational agency or a ‘State\neducational agency’ as defined by section 801(k) of the Elementary\nand Secondary Education Act of 1965.” 20 U.S.C. §1720 (2000).5 A\n“local educational agency” is defined as:\n\n\n   5\n    The definitions of “local educational agency” and “State educational\nagency” have subsequently been recodified multiple times. The definitions\nare now available at 20 U.S.C. §7801 (Supp. 2005).\n\n                                  -11-\n\f             “[A] public board of education or other public authority\n        legally constituted within a State for either administrative\n        control or direction of, or to perform a service function for,\n        public elementary schools or secondary schools in a city,\n        county, township, school district, or other political\n        subdivision of a State, or of or for a combination of school\n        districts or counties that is recognized in a State as an\n        administrative agency for its public elementary schools or\n        secondary schools.” (Emphases added.) 20 U.S.C.\n        §7801(26)(A) (Supp. 2005).\nA “State educational agency” is similarly defined as “the State\neducational agency in a State in which the State educational agency\nis the sole educational agency for all public schools.” 20 U.S.C.\n§7801(26)(E) (Supp. 2005).\n    The combination of the EEOA’s prohibition on states denying\nindividuals access to equal educational opportunity and the definition\nof an “educational agency” as a political subdivision of the state\ndemonstrates that Congress intended that states and their “educational\nagencies” not engage in discriminatory conduct. This point is\nreinforced by District 204 when they cite Gomez v. Illinois State\nBoard of Education, 811 F.2d 1030 (7th Cir. 1987), to support its\ncontention that the Board is responsible for enforcement of the EEOA\nas well as the courts. Gomez, 811 F.2d at 1038 (“relief is to be\nobtained from the state and its agencies”). However, the quotation\nused by District 204, taken in context, shows that relief was “to be\nobtained from the state and its agencies” in court. The passage from\nGomez cited by District 204 went on to include the 7th Circuit’s\nholding, which was that “Congress intended to abrogate the states’\nEleventh Amendment immunity to the extent such immunity would\nforeclose recovery under that act.” Gomez, 811 F.2d at 1038. In other\nwords, Gomez stands for the proposition that the EEOA allows the\ncourts to hold the state and its agencies liable for past discriminatory\nactions. It does not stand for the idea that the Board must adjudicate\nor even consider the racially discriminatory impact of its actions.\n    The prohibition on acting in a discriminatory way is not the same\nas an affirmative mandate to take certain actions or to conduct formal\nproceedings to ensure that the actions taken are not discriminatory.\nThere is no language in the EEOA that prescribes that any state or\n\n                                 -12-\n\f“educational agency” take any affirmative step to consider the\nsegregative effects of their actions prior to taking them.\n    What the EEOA does provide is that if the state or an\n“educational agency” does take a discriminatory action or has taken\na discriminatory action in the past that these “agencies” may either\ntake voluntary steps to remedy the past discrimination (20 U.S.C.\n§1716 (2000)) or in the absence of action that these agencies are\nliable in court (20 U.S.C. §§1712, 1713, 1714, 1716, 1717, 1718\n(2000)).\n    Certainly, a state can choose to mandate that its “educational\nagency” consider the EEOA in granting a petition for\ndetachment/annexation. However, the EEOA does not require that\nstates mandate educational agencies to consider the EEOA or vest\nthem with the power to consider the segregative effect of\ndetachment/annexation petitions. Preemption requires an actual\nconflict such that “it is impossible *** to comply with both state and\nfederal law” and where the challenged law “stands as an obstacle to\nthe accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives\nof Congress.” Crosby, 530 U.S. at 372-73, 147 L. Ed. 2d at 361, 120\nS. Ct. at 2294. That is not the case here.\n    The EEOA uses the term “educational agencies” to describe\npotential discriminatory actors, but ultimately it is the discriminatory\nactions of the state and its agencies that are to be corrected by the\ncourt. It is the state that must provide relief for the discriminatory\nactions of its subdivisions. Under the supremacy clause, “state courts\nshare responsibility for the application and enforcement of federal\nlaw” (Howlett v. Rose, 496 U.S. 356, 372-73, 110 L. Ed. 2d 332, 351\n110 S. Ct. 2430, 2441 (1990)) and a state court cannot refuse to hear\na federal claim as long as they would entertain a similar claim under\nstate law. Howlett, 496 U.S. at 369-73, 110 L. Ed. 2d at 348-51, 110\nS. Ct. at 2439-41. Illinois recognizes numerous claims for both racial\ndiscrimination and the invalidation of agency actions. See, e.g., Board\nof Education v. Cady, 369 Ill. App. 3d 486 (2006), and Chicago\nSchool Reform Board of Trustees v. Illinois Educational Labor\nRelations Board, 315 Ill. App. 3d 522 (2000). Therefore, the courts\n\n\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\fof Illinois have an obligation to review and enforce the EEOA.6 It is\nthis obligation that we direct our attention to next.\n\n                                    II\n    The second argument presented by the Board to refute the\nappellate court’s finding of preemption is that administrative review\nis not the exclusive means of challenging the Board’s decision to\ngrant a petition for detachment/annexation. The Board argues that\nDistrict 204’s EEOA claim may be brought under the circuit court’s\noriginal jurisdiction.\n    District 204 counters that the EEOA requires states to take\naffirmative steps to “remove vestiges of a dual school system” and to\nnot “deny equal educational opportunity to an individual on account\nof his or her race, color, sex, or national origin.” 20 U.S.C. §1703\n(2000). District 204 asserts that administrative review is the exclusive\nmeans of reviewing the Board’s decision because the administrative\nreview law states that “[e]very action to review a final administrative\ndecision shall be commenced by the filing of a complaint and the\nissuance of summons.” 735 ILCS 5/3–103 (West 2006). In the present\ncase, District 204 seeks review of a final decision of an administrative\nagency. Further, District 204 notes that on administrative review, the\ncircuit court is limited to the record developed before the\nadministrative body (see 735 ILCS 5/3–110 (West 2006)) and section\n7–2b prohibits the Board from considering the EEOA. Thus, if\nadministrative review is the exclusive means of challenging the\nBoard’s decision, then section 7–2b, in conjunction with the scope of\nthe circuit court’s jurisdiction on administrative review, would\neffectively prohibit the state from stopping a potentially\ndiscriminatory action under the EEOA. Thus, the EEOA would\npreempt section 7–2b, as the EEOA mandates that the state must not\nallow discriminatory action.\n\n\n\n   6\n    This does not exclude the possibility that a federal claim is initially\nconsidered and decided by an administrative tribunal and comes before the\ncourt only under an exercise of the court’s statutory power for\nadministrative review.\n\n                                   -14-\n\f     Thus, District 204 asserts that either section 7–2b’s limiting\nclause or the administrative review statute must be invalidated and\nthereby allow for consideration of its EEOA claim. However, this\nproblem exists only if administrative review is the exclusive means\nof challenging the Board’s decision.\n     The Board asserts that the way to both obtain a hearing on the\nBoard’s decision and avoid declaring a statute unconstitutional is to\nallow District 204 to bring the EEOA claim as an independent cause\nof action under the circuit court’s original jurisdiction. This would\nallow District 204 to bring its EEOA claim in the circuit court and\ndevelop a factual record before the circuit court. Under the Board’s\nargument this action could either progress independently or be\nconsolidated with an action for administrative review. The Board\nnotes, and District 204 does not dispute, that under this approach\nthere is no preemption issue. In this way, District 204’s EEOA claim\ncan be fully litigated, and this court avoids invalidating a statute. For\nthe following reasons, we believe that this is the correct approach.\n     As a creation of statute, the Board may exercise only the authority\ngiven to it by statute. “Any power or authority it exercises must find\nits source within the law pursuant to which it was created.” Delgado\nv. Board of Election Commissioners, 224 Ill. 2d 481, 485 (2007). As\npreviously noted, section 7–2b’s limitation clause serves to severely\nlimit the evidence that a party may introduce into the record before\nthe Board. While the General Assembly could have vested the Board\nwith the power to hear District 204’s EEOA claim, it did not. So long\nas the right to equal educational opportunity can be vindicated,\nhowever, the wisdom of the General Assembly’s choice in this regard\nis not for this court to decide.\n     The Code of Civil Procedure states that on administrative review\nthe circuit court is limited to “questions of law and fact presented by\nthe entire record before the court. No new or additional evidence ***\nshall be heard by the court.” 735 ILCS 5/3–110 (West 2006).\nTherefore, to the extent that section 7–2b restricts the evidence that\nthe Board may place in the record, the circuit court is similarly\nrestricted in its administrative review. Thus, the circuit court on\nadministrative review is no better able to address District 204’s\nEEOA claims than the Board was in the first instance.\n\n\n                                  -15-\n\f    The Illinois Constitution of 1970 vests the circuit courts with\noriginal jurisdiction over “all justiciable matters except when the\nSupreme Court has original and exclusive jurisdiction.” Ill. Const.\n1970, art. VI, §9. As this court has noted,\n             “Our current constitution does not define the term\n        ‘justiciable matters,’ nor did our former constitution, in which\n        this term first appeared. See Ill. Const. 1970, art. VI, §9; Ill.\n        Const. 1870, art. VI, §9 (amended 1964). Generally, a\n        ‘justiciable matter’ is a controversy appropriate for review by\n        the court, in that it is definite and concrete, as opposed to\n        hypothetical or moot, touching upon the legal relations of\n        parties having adverse legal interests.” Belleville Toyota, Inc.\n        v. Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc., 199 Ill. 2d 325, 335\n        (2002).\n    In this case, there is a controversy between private citizens who\nwish to detach property from a government entity, the Board who\nwishes to defend the law, and a second government body that opposes\nthe proposed action. There is nothing abstract or moot about the\ncontroversy. It affects the legal relationship between the parties and\nthe parties have adverse legal interests. Therefore, the current case\nconstitutes a “justiciable matter” under the Illinois Constitution’s\ngrant of original jurisdiction to the circuit courts. In addition to the\ncase falling within the circuit court’s original jurisdiction, this case\nmay also be handled as an independent action because the traditional\nrules of forfeiture do not apply.\n    Ordinarily, any issue that is not raised before the administrative\nagency, even constitutional issues that the agency lacks the authority\nto decide, will be forfeited by the party failing to raise the issue. In\nCarpetland U.S.A., Inc. v. Illinois Department of Employment\nSecurity, this court refused to address a claim that the Department of\nEmployment Security had violated the due process clauses of both the\nUnited States Constitution and Illinois Constitution because the issue\nhad not been raised at the first opportunity, before the administrative\nagency. Carpetland U.S.A., Inc. v. Illinois Department of Employment\nSecurity, 201 Ill. 2d 351, 396-97 (2002) (“constitutional claim is\n[forfeited] for failure to raise it at the first opportunity”). This has led\nthis court to admonish litigants to “assert a constitutional challenge\non the record before the administrative tribunal, because\n\n                                   -16-\n\fadministrative review is confined to the proof offered before the\nagency.” Carpetland U.S.A., Inc., 201 Ill. 2d at 397. See also Texaco-\nCities Service Pipeline Co. v. McGaw, 182 Ill. 2d 262, 278 (1998).\n(“It is well-recognized that a litigant’s right to question the validity of\na statute is subject to [forfeiture] by act or omission”).\n     However, in this instance, the ordinary forfeiture rules do not\napply because section 7–2b prohibits the development of a record\nwith regard to the EEOA claim. The limiting clause of section 7–2b\ndenies District 204 all opportunity to develop a record with regard to\nan EEOA violation before the administrative agency. Thus, there can\nbe no forfeiture, because there was no opportunity to present the\nissue. In essence, there was no “first opportunity.”\n     Similarly, the exclusivity of the administrative review law does\nnot apply where, as described above, the issue being raised cannot be\nintroduced before the administrative agency. In the present case,\nsection 7–2b operates as a complete bar to the Board’s even receiving\nevidence on anything outside of section 7–2b’s requirements. Neither\nthe parties nor this court have found any similar limitation anywhere\nelse in the statutes of this state. As this court held in Chestnut v.\nLodge, “[t]he Administrative Review Act is a salutary act to provide\na simple single review from specified administrative decisions, but it\nwas not intended to be a trap for the unwary to establish a bar to\nrelief.” Chestnut v. Lodge, 34 Ill. 2d 567, 571 (1966). District 204’s\nEEOA claim is beyond the scope of the hearing officer, beyond the\nscope of the Board’s administrative decision, and therefore beyond\nthe scope of the administrative review law.\n     The Board points out that handling the EEOA claim as an\nindependent action under the circuit court’s original jurisdiction is not\nwithout precedent. In Board of Education of Rich Township High\nSchool District No. 227 v. Brown, the appellate court allowed a\nconstitutional challenge to section 7–2b to be brought as an\nindependent action in the circuit court. In doing so, the appellate court\nrejected an expansion of the Board’s power, holding that the limiting\nclause of section 7–2b expressly placed the issue outside of the\nBoard’s authority and outside the court’s statutory authority to review\nthe decisions of administrative agencies. Board of Education of Rich\nTownship High School District No. 227 v. Brown, 311 Ill. App. 3d\n478 (1999). However, the court noted that while the issue may be\n\n                                   -17-\n\foutside the scope of the administrative agency’s authority, and\noutside the scope of administrative review, it was not outside the\nscope of the circuit court’s original jurisdiction under the Illinois\nConstitution. Therefore, the court held that the circuit court could\ndevelop the record necessary to decide the constitutional challenge\nunder an exercise of the circuit court’s original jurisdiction. Rich\nTownship, 311 Ill. App. 3d at 491.7\n    District 204 contends that adopting this approach will allow\nschool district boundaries to be “redrawn without considering the\neffect of such a maneuver on educational segregation.” Neither party\ndisputes that District 204’s EEOA claim must be considered and\ndecided by a court of competent jurisdiction. Through the exercise of\nthe circuit court’s original jurisdiction, the circuit courts may conduct\nproceedings, receive evidence, and fully adjudicate District 204’s\nEEOA claim. Further, given the nature of this claim, there is no\nreason why a plaintiff could not seek an injunction pending resolution\nof this claim in the circuit court. See Ardt v. Illinois Department of\nProfessional Regulation, 154 Ill. 2d 138, 148 (1992) (“Circuit courts\nhave traditionally used mandamus, certiorari, injunction and other\nactions as a means of reviewing the decisions of administrative\nagencies”).\n\n                          CONCLUSION\n    Because District 204’s EEOA claim is subject to adjudication by\nthe circuit court as a matter of original jurisdiction, there is no\npreemption, as section 7–2b does not present an obstacle to the\n“accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives”\nof the EEOA. Accordingly, we reverse that portion of the appellate\n\n\n\n\n   7\n    In Rich Township, the circuit court did not ultimately have to develop\nthis record because the record had been adequately developed before the\nBoard, the limitations of section 7–2b not withstanding. However, this\nholding is not dicta because regardless of where the factual record was\ndeveloped, the circuit court still had to have jurisdiction to consider and\nenter judgment in the case.\n\n\n                                   -18-\n\fdecision that held section 7–2b was preempted by the EEOA. We\nremand the matter to the circuit court.\n\n                                              Reversed and remanded.\n\n     JUSTICE FREEMAN, specially concurring:\n     This court holds that the circuit court of Will County has original\njurisdiction to adjudicate the claim of Joliet Township High School\nDistrict 204 (District 204), brought pursuant to the Equal Educational\nOpportunities Act of 1974 (EEOA) (20 U.S.C. §1701 et seq. (2000)).\nConsequently, this court further holds that the EEOA does not\npreempt and render unconstitutional section 7–2b of the Illinois\nSchool Code (105 ILCS 5/7–2b (West 1998)). Slip op. at 18-19.\n     I fully agree with the court’s reasoning and result. I write\nseparately to urge the General Assembly to amend section 7–2b of the\nSchool Code to allow a school board to hear disputes regarding equal\neducational opportunity when determining section 7–2b petitions.\nSuch disputes should be heard initially by a school board and not a\ncourt. Also, I caution the circuit court in this case, on remand, to base\nits findings on sufficient evidence and not conjecture.\n\n                          I. BACKGROUND\n     Four individuals who were all of the registered voters of a\ncontiguous 320-acre parcel of farm land in Will County petitioned the\nIllinois State Board of Education (Board) to detach their property\nfrom District 204 and annex it to Lincoln Way Community High\nSchool District No. 210 (District 210), pursuant to section 7–2b of the\nSchool Code (105 ILCS 5/7–2b (West 1998)). Section 7–2b provides\nthat, under specific circumstances, land may be automatically\ndetached from one district and annexed to another district, at either\nthe elementary or high school level. See M. Guenther & B. Wright,\nCreation, Dissolution, and Boundary Changes, in 1 Illinois School\nLaw §1.11 (Ill. Inst. for Cont. Legal Educ. 2005). The Board held an\nadministrative hearing on the detachment and annexation petition.\nDistrict 204 claimed, inter alia, that granting the petition would\nviolate the EEOA, which prohibits the transfer of a student from one\nschool to another if the transfer results in increasing student racial\n\n                                  -19-\n\fsegregation. See 20 U.S.C. §1703 (2000). District 204 alleged that\npetitioners are white, the population of District 204 is “60%\nminority,” and District 210 is “almost completely white.” District 204\nargued that granting the petition would increase racial segregation in\nviolation of the EEOA. The hearing officer specifically found that\nDistrict 204’s EEOA claim was beyond its statutory and regulatory\nauthority. It is undisputed that petitioners met section 7–2b’s four\nspecific conditions. Accordingly, the Board granted the section 7–2b\npetition. Slip op. at 2-4.\n    On administrative review, the circuit court confirmed the Board’s\ndecision granting the petition. Additionally, the circuit court\nindependently found that the Board’s decision did not “create a\nConstitutional impediment,” or violate federal law. On appeal, the\nappellate court: vacated the circuit court’s ruling on the merits of\nDistrict 204’s EEOA claim; held that the EEOA preempted section\n7–2b of the School Code and rendered it unconstitutional; and\nremanded the cause to the Board to conduct a hearing on the EEOA\nclaim. Slip op. at 4-5.\n\n                            II. ANALYSIS\n    Before this court, District 204 essentially raises two issues:\n            “The current legislative framework developed by the\n        General Assembly is a naked attempt [A] to sidestep the\n        federal mandate set forth in the EEOA by stripping away an\n        agency’s ability to consider the effect of detachment on racial\n        segregation, and [B] then tie the hand of the circuit courts on\n        review through application of the Administrative Review\n        Act.”\nWhile future litigation will shed light on the first claim, this court\ncorrectly rejects the second contention.\n\n    A. De Jure Segregation and Equal Educational Opportunity\n    Section 7–2b of the School Code mandates an automatic\ndetachment and annexation procedure that expressly prohibits\nconsideration of surrounding circumstances. This unique automatic\nprocedure can potentially promote illegal student segregation. The\npotential for such a consequence flies in the face of constitutional\n\n                                 -20-\n\fprinciples that the United States Supreme Court first enunciated over\n50 years ago, and decisions that this court issued over a century ago,\nupholding the right of children to attend public schools free of de jure\nsegregation.\n\n         1. Authority to Change School District Boundaries\n    Within constitutional limitations, the legislature ultimately\ncontrols the creation, division, and abolishment of school districts.\nPeople v. Wood, 411 Ill. 514, 522 (1952). This court has repeatedly\nrecognized that any school district established under enabling\nlegislation is:\n        “ ‘entirely subject to the will of the legislature thereafter.\n        With or without the consent of the inhabitants of a school\n        district, over their protests, even without notice or hearing, the\n        State may take the school facilities in the district, without\n        giving compensation therefor, and vest them in other districts\n        or agencies. *** The area of the district may be contracted or\n        expanded, it may be divided, united in whole or in part with\n        another district, and the district may be abolished. All this at\n        the will of the legislature.’ ” Elementary School District 159\n        v. Schiller, 221 Ill. 2d 130, 155 (2006), quoting People ex rel.\n        Dixon v. Community Unit School District No. 3, 2 Ill. 2d 454,\n        465-66 (1954).\nThis court has further explained that a school district is a quasi-\nmunicipal corporation created by the state to act as its administrative\narm to implement the establishment of free schools. Wood, 411 Ill. at\n522. The legislature may delegate its power to change school district\nboundaries to school authorities, who exercise that power in their\ndiscretion, guided by statutory standards. School District No. 79 v.\nCounty Board of School Trustees, 4 Ill. 2d 533, 538-40 (1954).\nAlthough the residents of a school district may initiate a petition for\ndetachment and annexation because of personal desires or\nconvenience, the decision to change established school district\nboundaries rests within the discretion of the appropriate school\nagency. Oakdale Community Consolidated School District No. 1 v.\nCounty Board of School Trustees, 12 Ill. 2d 190, 193 (1957).\n\n\n\n                                  -21-\n\f    Of course, the legislature must exercise this significant power\nwithin constitutional limitations. School district lines are not\nsacrosanct and they must not conflict with the fourteenth amendment.\nSee Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U.S. 717, 744, 41 L. Ed. 2d 1069, 1091,\n94 S. Ct. 3112, 3127 (1974).\n\n                     2. Constitutional Principles\n    One scholar has identified Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S.\n483, 98 L. Ed. 873, 74 S. Ct. 686 (1954), “as having the most impact\non education law.” 4 J. Rapp, Education Law §10.01[1], at 10–3\n(2008). In Brown, the United States Supreme Court repudiated the\ndoctrine of “separate but equal,” which the Court first enunciated in\nPlessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537, 41 L. Ed. 256, 16 S. Ct. 1138\n(1896). The Court in Brown observed that de jure (state-imposed)\nracial segregation of students is in itself an evil that tends to frustrate\nthe affected students “in a way unlikely ever to be undone.” Brown,\n347 U.S. at 494, 98 L. Ed. at 880, 74 S. Ct. at 691. The Court held as\nfollows:\n            “We conclude that in the field of public education the\n        doctrine of ‘separate but equal’ has no place. Separate\n        educational facilities are inherently unequal. Therefore, we\n        hold that the plaintiffs and others similarly situated for whom\n        the actions have been brought are, by reason of the\n        segregation complained of, deprived of the equal protection\n        of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.”\n        Brown, 347 U.S. at 495, 98 L. Ed. at 881, 74 S. Ct. at 692.\nBrown is significant partly because the United States Supreme Court\nreversed years of constitutional history that permitted the segregation\nof students based on race or color. “It righted a legal and moral\nwrong. But as important–perhaps more important–is that Brown\nushered in a new era of broader educational opportunity.” 4 J. Rapp,\nEducation Law §10.01[1], at 10–3 (2008). Today, the idea that\nsegregation based on race or color is inherently unequal is “a\nstatement of clear constitutional principle and not a matter of\neducational conjecture.” 4 J. Rapp, Education Law §10.05[1], at\n10–75 (2008).\n\n\n\n                                   -22-\n\f     The decision in Brown invalidated only de jure segregation in\npublic schools, i.e., segregation resulting from intentional\ngovernmental action. In contrast, de facto segregation occurs without\nany governmental action that is intended to segregate. Unintentional\nde facto segregation, by itself, does not violate the fourteenth\namendment. Dayton Board of Education v. Brinkman, 433 U.S. 406,\n413, 53 L. Ed. 2d 851, 859, 97 S. Ct. 2766, 2772 (1977); see 3 R.\nRotunda & J. Nowak, Treatise on Constitutional Law §18.9(a)(ii)(1),\nat 488 (4th ed. 2008); 4 J. Rapp, Education Law §10.05[1], at 10–74\nthrough 10–75 (2008); 3 J. Cook & J. Sobieski, Civil Rights Actions\n¶16.02, at 16–5 (2008); E. Reutter, The Law of Public Education 794-\n95 (3d ed. 1985).\n     In Keyes v. School District No. 1, 413 U.S. 189, 37 L. Ed. 2d 548,\n93 S. Ct. 2686 (1973), the Court addressed for the first time the\nconstitutionality of racial imbalance in a school system that had\n“never been operated under a constitutional or statutory provision that\nmandated or permitted racial segregation in public education.” Keyes,\n413 U.S. at 191, 37 L. Ed. 2d at 553, 93 S. Ct. at 2688. Nevertheless,\nthe Court held that where “school authorities have carried out a\nsystematic program of segregation affecting a substantial portion of\nthe students, schools, teachers, and facilities within the school system,\nit is only common sense to conclude that there exists a predicate for\na finding of the existence of a dual school system.” Keyes, 413 U.S.\nat 201, 37 L. Ed. 2d at 559, 93 S. Ct. at 2694. “Correction of such\nactions comes within the direct mandate of Brown, for it is\nsegregation which has developed, not fortuitously, but by\ngovernmental action. Although often called de facto segregation, it is\nreally ‘covert de jure’ segregation.” E. Reutter, The Law of Public\nEducation 795 (3d ed. 1985). The Court emphasized that the crucial\ndifference between de jure and de facto segregation is the intent to\ndiscriminate. The Court endorsed a burden-shifting procedure\ndesigned to adduce the intent necessary to prove “covert de jure”\nsegregation where the law does not expressly authorize segregation.\nKeyes, 413 U.S. at 208, 37 L. Ed. 2d at 563, 93 S. Ct. at 2697; see\nBrinkman, 433 U.S. at 420, 53 L. Ed. 2d at 863, 97 S. Ct. at 2775; 3\nR. Rotunda & J. Nowak, Treatise on Constitutional Law\n§18.9(a)(ii)(1), at 490-92 (4th ed. 2008) 4 J. Rapp, Education Law\n§10.04[3], at 10-69 through 10–70, §10.05[3], at 10–86 through\n\n                                  -23-\n\f10–90 (2008); 3 J. Cook & J. Sobieski, Civil Rights Actions ¶16.02,\nat 16–8 through 16–12 (2008). Keyes exemplifies that “the Equal\nProtection Clause [is] aimed at all official actions, not just those of\nstate legislatures. *** Even actions of state agents that may be illegal\nunder state law are attributable to the State.” Columbus Board of\nEducation v. Penick, 443 U.S. 449, 457 n.5, 61 L. Ed. 2d 666, 676\nn.5, 99 S. Ct. 2941, 2946 n.5 (1979).\n\n           3. Equal Educational Opportunities Act of 1974\n     The EEOA is a multipurpose statute. The Act declares it to be a\npolicy of the United States that “all children enrolled in public\nschools are entitled to equal educational opportunity without regard\nto race, color, sex, or national origin.” 20 U.S.C. §1701(a)(1) (2000).8\nTo effectuate this policy, the EEOA prohibits in pertinent part:\n             “No State shall deny equal educational opportunity to an\n         individual on account of his or her race, color, sex, or national\n         origin, by–\n                                    ***\n                 (c) the assignment by an educational agency of a\n             student to a school, other than the one closest to his or her\n             place of residence within the school district in which he\n             or she resides, if the assignment results in a greater degree\n             of segregation of students on the basis of race, color, sex,\n             or national origin among the schools of such agency than\n             would result if such student were assigned to the school\n             closest to his or her place of residence within the school\n\n\n\n  8\n    The EEOA also declares it to be a policy of the United States that “the\nneighborhood is the appropriate basis for determining public school\nassignments.” 20 U.S.C. §1701(a)(2) (2000). It is generally recognized that\nCongress enacted the EEOA in reaction to court decisions upholding busing\nas a means of remedying de jure segregation. See 4 J. Rapp, Education Law\n§10.06[5], at 10-121 (2008); 3 J. Cook & J. Sobieski, Civil Rights Actions\n¶16.19, at 16–96 through 16–97 (2008). The Act directs federal courts not\nto use busing to remedy de jure segregation “unless the court first finds that\nall alternative remedies are inadequate.” 20 U.S.C. §1755 (2000).\n\n                                    -24-\n\f           district of such agency providing the appropriate grade\n           level and type of education for such student;\n               ***\n               (e) the transfer by an educational agency, whether\n           voluntary or otherwise, of a student from one school to\n           another if the purpose and effect of such transfer is to\n           increase segregation of students on the basis of race,\n           color, or national origin among the schools of such\n           agency.” 20 U.S.C. §1703 (2000).\nWith respect to racial desegregation, the EEOA is essentially a\nrestatement of preexisting case law, and its prohibitions are mostly\ncoextensive with the equal protection clause of the fourteenth\namendment. 4 J. Rapp, Education Law §10.02[3], at 10–19 (2008);\n3 J. Cook & J. Sobieski, Civil Rights Actions ¶16.19, at 16–99\n(2008).\n\n                  4. Segregation in Illinois Schools\n     De jure racial segregation existed in Illinois at the time of the\nratification of the fourteenth amendment. In 1825, the General\nAssembly provided for the establishment of public schools, which\nwere “open and free to every class of white citizens, between the ages\nof five and twenty-one years.” (Emphasis added.) 1833 Ill. Laws 556.\nThe 1857 School Code did not expressly exclude black children from\npublic schools but, rather, impliedly limited public schools to white\nchildren. 1857 Ill. Laws 260, §7 (requiring state superintendent to\nperiodically report to Governor on, inter alia, “the number of white\npersons in each county under twenty-one years of age”), 1857 Ill.\nLaws 263, §16 (requiring school commissioner to apportion state\nfunds among school districts in county based on, in part, “the number\nof white children, under twenty-one years of age”), 1857 Ill. Laws\n292, §80 (“In townships in which there shall be persons of color the\nboard of trustees shall allow such persons a portion of the school fund\nequal to the amount of taxes collected for school purposes from such\npersons of color in their respective townships”); see generally B.\nReams & P. Wilson, Segregation and The Fourteenth Amendment in\nthe States 138-54 (1975); D. Douglas, The Limits of Law in\n\n\n\n                                 -25-\n\fAccomplishing Racial Change: School Segregation in the Pre-Brown\nNorth, 44 UCLA L. Rev. 677, 695-96 (1997).\n    In 1867, the General Assembly ratified the fourteenth amendment.\nIn 1874, the legislature enacted legislation that expressly prohibited\nthe exclusion of any child from a public school based on race. Ill.\nRev. Stat. 1874, ch. 122, par. 100. In a series of decisions beginning\nin 1874, this court repeatedly ruled against racial segregation in\neducation in the face of local defiance. See, e.g., Chase v. Stephenson,\n71 Ill. 383 (1874); People ex rel. Longress v. Board of Education of\nthe City of Quincy, 101 Ill. 308 (1882); People ex rel. Peair v. Board\nof Education of Upper Alton School District, 127 Ill. 613 (1889);\nPeople ex rel. Bibb v. Mayor & Common Council, 193 Ill. 309 (1901).\nAgainst this backdrop, I turn to article 7 of the Illinois School Code.\n\n            5. Detachment and Annexation: Overall Benefit\n    “The most typical” school boundary changes are the result of the\ndetachment of a portion of school district territory and its annexation\nto another school district. See C. Russo & R. Mawdsley, Education\nLaw §1.04[3], at 1–19 through 1–20 (2008). In Illinois, school district\nboundaries may be changed by detachment, annexation, division,\ndissolution, or by any combination of those methods pursuant to\narticle 7 of the School Code. 105 ILCS 5/7–02 (West 2006). The\ngeneral method for detachment and annexation involves a petition\nprocess, administrative hearings, and the potential for judicial review\npursuant to the Administrative Review Law (735 ILCS 5/3–101 et\nseq. (West 2006)). See 105 ILCS 5/7–1, 7–2, 7–6, 7–7 (West 2006).\n    At the administrative hearing on a detachment and annexation\npetition, section 7-6 of the School Code mandates that the hearing\nofficer:\n             “shall hear evidence as to the school needs and conditions\n         of the territory in the area within and adjacent thereto and as\n         to the ability of the districts affected to meet the standards of\n         recognition as prescribed by the State Board of Education,\n         and shall take into consideration the division of funds and\n         assets which will result from the change of boundaries and\n         shall determine whether it is to the best interests of the\n         schools of the area and the educational welfare of the pupils\n\n                                  -26-\n\f        that such change in boundaries be granted ***.” 105 ILCS\n        5/7–6(i) (West 2006).\nBased on the language of section 7–6, a petition for detachment and\nannexation should be granted only where the overall benefit to the\nannexing district and the detachment area clearly outweighs the\nresulting detriment to the losing district and the surrounding\ncommunity as a whole. Carver v. Bond/Fayette/Effingham Regional\nBoard of School Trustees, 146 Ill. 2d 347, 356 (1992) (collecting\ncases).\n    In applying this benefit-detriment test, the hearing board, and the\ncourts reviewing the board’s decision, are to consider differences\nbetween school facilities and curricula, the distances from the\npetitioners’ homes to the respective schools, the effect detachment\nwould have on the ability of either district to meet state standards of\nrecognition, and the impact of the proposed boundary change on the\ntax revenues of both districts. Carver, 146 Ill. 2d at 356. The hearing\nboard may also consider the closely related “whole child” and\n“community of interest” factors. The “whole child” factor “recognizes\nthat extracurricular participation in social, religious and even\ncommercial activities is important in a child’s development as a\nbeneficial supplement to the child’s academic involvement.” Board\nof Education of Golf School District No. 67 v. Regional Board of\nSchool Trustees of Cook County, 89 Ill. 2d 392, 397 (1982). The\n“community of interest” factor ascertains whether the petitioning area\nis identified with the school district and the community to which\nannexation is requested. If a child attends school in his or her natural\ncommunity, it not only enhances the child’s educational opportunity\nbut encourages the child’s participation in social and other\nextracurricular activities that figure importantly in the “whole child”\nconcept. Golf, 89 Ill. 2d at 397-98. Further, consideration of the racial\nimpact of a school district boundary change is relevant to a\ndetachment and annexation proceeding “to ensure that a dual school\nsystem based upon race, national origin, or color does not result.” C.\nRusso & R. Mawdsley, Education Law §1.04[3], at 1–19, 1–20\n(2008). See, e.g., In re Petition for Authorization to Conduct a\nReferendum on the Withdrawal of North Haledon School District\nfrom the Passaic County Manchester Regional High School District\n, 181 N.J. 161, 181-82, 854 A.2d 327, 339 (2004); Union Title Co. v.\n\n                                  -27-\n\fState Board of Education, 51 Ohio St. 3d 189, 192 n.5, 555 N.E.2d\n931, 934 n.5 (1990).\n    Indeed, it is recognized that “Illinois is exceptionally active in\ndetachment proceedings. *** A review of Illinois detachment cases\nover the past two decades indicates that the judicial emphasis is\nconsistently focused on the concepts of the ‘whole child,’ the\n‘community of interests’ and ‘the educational welfare of the\nstudents.’ ” J. Menacker, Illinois Detachment Legislation: A Device\nfor Creating Manageable Urban School Districts, 81 Educ. L. Rep.\n411, 414-19 (1993). However, in enacting the automatic detachment\nprocedure in section 7–2b of the School Code, the legislature\npointedly rejected this well-settled holistic approach.\n\n                 6. Section 7–2b: Automatic Procedure\n     Section 7–2b of the School Code provides for the detachment and\nannexation of noncoterminous land from an elementary or high\nschool district. In contrast to the procedure for detachment and\nannexation generally, section 7–2b mandates that a detachment and\nannexation petition “shall” be granted if the affected land constitutes\n10% or less of the district’s equalized assessed value and of its\nterritory; two-thirds of the registered voters in affected area support\nthe petition; and the annexation will make the boundaries of the\nelementary school and high school districts for the affected land\nidentical. 105 ILCS 5/7–2b(a) (West 1998); slip op. at 3.\n     The legislature originally added this procedure to the School Code\nin 1991. Pub. Act 87–667, eff. September 20, 1991 (adding Ill. Rev.\nStat. 1991, ch. 122, par. 7–2b). Further, to ensure that this procedure\nis truly automatic, the legislature subsequently added a directive to\nsection 7–2b, which at the time of these proceedings read as follows:\n         “The regional board of school trustees shall have no authority\n         or discretion to hear any evidence or consider any issues\n         except those that may be necessary to determine whether the\n         limitations and conditions of this Section have been met.”\n         Pub. Act 87–1270, §2, eff. March 3, 1993 (amending Ill. Rev.\n         Stat. 1991, ch. 122, par. 7–2b).\nAmong the issues that the legislature expressly excludes from\nconsideration is whether granting a detachment and annexation\n\n                                 -28-\n\fpetition would deny public school children the equal educational\nopportunity guaranteed by the equal protection clause of the\nfourteenth amendment. Obviously, such a result is untenable.\n     School authorities have the primary responsibility for elucidating,\nassessing, and solving the problem of unconstitutional racial\ndiscrimination in public education. Brown v. Board of Education\n(Brown II), 349 U.S. 294, 299, 99 L. Ed. 1083, 1105, 75 S. Ct. 753,\n756 (1955). It is recognized that detachment and annexation of school\ndistrict territory can operate to perpetuate segregation. See C. Russo\n& R. Mawdsley, Education Law §1.04[3], at 1–19, 1–20 (2008).\nSurprisingly, the General Assembly expressly prohibits the Board\nfrom even considering this constitutional issue when presented with\na section 7–2b petition. In a case presenting a more blatant example\nof legislative obstructionism, the United States Supreme Court\ndeclared as follows:\n         “[T]he prohibitions of the Fourteenth Amendment extend to\n         all action of the State denying equal protection of the laws;\n         whatever the agency of the State taking the action [citations];\n         or whatever the guise in which it is taken [citations]. In short,\n         the constitutional rights of children not to be discriminated\n         against in school admission on grounds of race or color\n         declared by this Court in the Brown case can neither be\n         nullified openly and directly by state legislators or state\n         executive or judicial officers, nor nullified indirectly by them\n         through evasive schemes for segregation whether attempted\n         ‘ingeniously or ingenuously.’ [Citation.]” Cooper v. Aaron,\n         358 U.S. 1, 17, 3 L. Ed. 2d 5, 16, 78 S. Ct. 1401, 1409 (1958).\nNo state legislator, executive, or judicial officer can war against the\nConstitution without violating his or her oath to support it. Cooper,\n358 U.S. at 18, 3 L. Ed. 2d at 16-17, 78 S. Ct. at 1409-10.\n     To be sure, the general detachment and annexation procedure,\nwith its petition process, administrative hearings, and potential for\njudicial review, can be described as “cumbersome.” J. Menacker,\nIllinois Detachment Legislation: A Device for Creating Manageable\nUrban School Districts, 81 Educ. L. Rep. 411, 413 (1993). This court\nlong ago admitted that the applicable standards “are general rather\nthan specific in nature. However, it would be both impossible and\nundesirable for the legislature to draft rigid nondiscretionary\n\n                                  -29-\n\fstandards which would embrace each and every school district\nboundary change, for conditions surrounding the changes are seldom\nthe same.” District No. 79, 4 Ill. 2d at 537-38. Further: “ ‘The\njudiciary is ill equipped to act as a super school board in assaying the\ncomplex factors involved in determining the best interest of the\nschools and the pupils affected by a change in boundaries.’ ” Carver,\n146 Ill. 2d at 362, quoting School Directors of School District No. 82\nv. Wolever, 26 Ill. 2d 264, 267 (1962).\n    Disputes regarding equal educational opportunity obviously must\nbe heard in the first instance by some public body, and that body\nshould be the Board. I urge the General Assembly to amend section\n7–2b to lift this prohibition from the Board when determining section\n7–2b petitions.\n\n           B. Safeguarding Equal Educational Opportunity\n    Of course, this legislative oversight cannot prevent judicial\nintervention to safeguard the fundamental goal of equal educational\nopportunity. This court correctly holds that the circuit court of Will\nCounty has original jurisdiction to adjudicate District 204’s EEOA\nclaim. Slip op. at 13-14, 16-18. Indeed, the circuit court has\njurisdiction to hear not only the EEOA claim, but all claims brought\nunder the full panoply of federal and Illinois remedial legislation for\nthe vindication of equal educational opportunity. See Yellow Freight\nSystem, Inc. v. Donnelly, 494 U.S. 820, 823, 108 L. Ed. 2d 834, 839-\n40, 110 S. Ct. 1566, 1568-69 (1990) (holding that state courts have\ninherent authority to adjudicate federal claims and that Congress must\naffirmatively divest state courts of their concurrent jurisdiction).\n    On remand, the circuit court will have the obligation to hear any\nclaim that District 204 may bring, and to receive relevant evidence in\nsupport thereof. Surprisingly, the circuit court made the following\nindependent finding in confirming the Board’s grant of the section\n7–2b petition:\n            “While one may have suspicions as to why property\n        owners may want to detach their land from one district and\n        attach it to another, mere suspicions are not enough. There is\n        nothing in this record to establish any type of racial\n        motivation on the part of the parties seeking disconnection.\n        On the record before the Hearing Officer it appears that the\n\n                                 -30-\n\f         reason for the disconnection was to properly align elementary\n         and high school boundaries so that students who attend New\n         Lennox Grade School District 122 could attend [h]igh school\n         at Lincolnway with their friends.\n             Now, this court is not so naïve as to not understand that\n         there may well be an economic benefit to a developer going\n         from one school district to another. Clearly, this land in\n         question will be used for development purposes. However,\n         even if that is the motivation, which is unclear from the\n         record, that in and of itself does not create a Constitutional\n         impediment or a violation of Federal law. The Court finds no\n         Constitutional problem with the actions of the State Board of\n         Education.” (Emphasis added.)\nThe circuit court correctly observed that the record contained no\nevidence regarding District 204’s EEOA claim because section 7–2b\nof the School Code prohibited the Board from receiving such\nevidence.\n    “It is essential to the sufficiency of findings of a court that they be\nsustained by the evidence.” Hanaman v. Davis, 20 Ill. App. 2d 111,\n115 (1959). In this case, it was impossible for the circuit court to find\nno constitutional or statutory violation because section 7–2b\nprohibited the Board from receiving any evidence supporting District\n204’s claim. Such indiscriminate comments “do not aid in the\nadministration of justice but on the contrary are a distinct\nobstruction.” Lewis v. West Side Trust & Savings Bank of Chicago,\n288 Ill.

District\n204 objected to the petition and argued inter alia that section 7–2b\nviolates the Equal Educational Opportunities Act of 1974 (EEOA)\n(20 U.S.C. §1701 et seq. (2000)). The hearing officer for the Illinois\n\fState Board of Education (Board) found that the conditions of section\n7–2b were met and recommended that the petition be granted. District\n204’s EEOA claim was not considered when the hearing officer made\nthis recommendation, as the hearing officer found that the claim was\noutside the scope of the Board’s authority under section 7–2b. The\nBoard accepted the hearing officer’s findings and granted the petition\nfor detachment/annexation. The circuit court of Will County affirmed\nthe Board’s order and found that the order did not violate the\nconstitution or federal statute. On appeal, the appellate court found\nthat section 7–2b was preempted by the EEOA and was, therefore,\nunconstitutional. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">373</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">563</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. The appellate court remanded\nthe cause to the Board to consider District 204’s EEOA claim. The\nBoard filed a petition for leave to appeal pursuant to Supreme Court\nRules 317 (210 Ill. 2d R. 317) and 315 (210 Ill. 2d R. 315). This court\ngranted the Board’s petition and for the following reasons, we reverse\nthe judgment of the appellate court and remand the cause to the\ncircuit court for consideration of District 204’s EEOA claim.\n\n                           BACKGROUND\n    In July of 1998, four individuals who made up all of the registered\nvoters of a contiguous 320-acre parcel of farm land in Will County\nfiled a petition with the Illinois State Board of Education (Board) to\ndetach their property from Joliet Township High School District No.\n204 (District 204) and attach it to Lincoln Way Community High\nSchool District No. 210, pursuant to section 7–2b of the Illinois\nSchool Code (105 ILCS 5/7–2b (West 1998)).\n    The parcel of land in question is situated in an area of the state\nwhere the grade schools and high schools are split into separate\nschool districts and the boundaries of these districts are not\ncoterminous. The children who reside on the disputed parcel of land\ncurrently attend grade school in the New Lenox Elementary School\nDistrict No. 122. The high school district that generally serves the\nNew Lenox Elementary School District is Lincoln Way Community\nHigh School District No. 210. However, the parcel of land in question\ndoes not fall within the boundaries of High School District 210, it\nfalls within the boundaries of Joliet High School District No. 204.\nThus the children who reside on the parcel will not attend the same\nhigh school as the majority of their former grade school classmates.\n\n                                 -2-\n\f    Section 7–2b allows for the detachment of land from one district\nand annexation to another where the affected land lies within\nelementary and high school districts with noncoterminous boundaries.\nSection 7–2b allows the land to be detached and annexed at either the\nelementary or high school level. Thus, it is the petitioner’s choice\nwhich district they leave and which they join. 105 ILCS 5/7–2b(a)\n(West 1998). A parcel of land is eligible for detachment and\nannexation only if (1) it represents 10% or less of the equalized\nassessed value of the district; (2) the parcel constitutes 10% or less of\nthe territory of the district;1 (3) two-thirds of the registered voters of\nthe parcel support the petition; and (4) the annexation will make the\nboundaries of the grade school and high school districts for the\naffected parcel identical. 105 ILCS 5/7–2b(a) (West 1998). Before\nthis court, neither party disputes that these four conditions are met.\n    Before the Board’s hearing officer, District 204 argued inter alia\nthat the detachment and annexation of the parcel increased\nsegregation in violation of the Equal Educational Opportunities Act\nof 1974. 20 U.S.C. §1701 et seq. (2000). The EEOA prohibits a state\nfrom denying “equal educational opportunity to an individual on\naccount of his or her race, color, sex, or national origin.” 20 U.S.C.\n§1703 (2000). The EEOA delineates a number of activities that\nconstitute discrimination. Among these are the assignment of a\nstudent to a school within the district in which he or she resides other\nthan the one closest to his or her residence “if the assignment results\nin a greater degree of segregation.” 20 U.S.C. §1703(c) (2000). The\nEEOA also prohibits the transfer of a student from one school to\nanother if “the purpose and effect of such transfer is to increase the\nsegregation of students.” 20 U.S.C. §1703(e) (2000).\n    District 204 claimed the detachment and annexation of the parcel\nincreases segregation because the four individuals who petitioned for\nannexation are white while the population of District 204, from which\n\n\n\n  1\n    Section 7–2b has subsequently been amended to reduce the percentage\nof both value and land mass that may be detached. Under the new law, the\nland to be detached may constitute no more than 5% of the assessed value\nand territory of the district. 105 ILCS 5/7–2b (West 2006). This change has\nno impact on this decision.\n\n                                   -3-\n\fthey seek to be detached, is “60% minority.”2 District 204 further\nasserted that allowing the “land to be detached *** from a largely\nminority school district (60%) and annexed to an almost completely\nwhite school district” would increase segregation based on race. On\nthis basis, District 204 described section 7–2b as a “mechanism for\n‘white flight’ ” and stated that it fostered “division among the races”\nin violation of the EEOA.\n    The hearing officer refused to hear District 204’s EEOA claim\nbecause section 7–2b contains a limiting clause that prohibits the\nBoard from hearing any evidence or considering any issue except\nthose necessary to determine if the four conditions of section 7–2b\nhave been met. See 105 ILCS 5/7–2b (West 1998) (“The [Board]\nshall have no authority or discretion to hear any evidence or consider\nany issues except those that may be necessary to determine whether\nthe limitations and conditions of this Section have been met”). The\nhearing officer expressly stated in his proposed findings of fact and\nconclusions of law that District 204’s EEOA claim was “beyond the\nscope of the [Board’s], and by extension the Hearing Officer’s\nauthority.”3 The Board accepted the hearing officer’s findings of fact\nand conclusions of law and granted the section 7–2b petition.\nThereafter, District 204 filed a complaint for administrative review\nwith the circuit court.\n    On administrative review, the circuit court confirmed the Board’s\ndecision to grant the petition, noting that there was “no Constitutional\nproblem with the actions of the [Board].” The circuit court also stated\nthat “mere suspicion” is not sufficient to establish racial motivation.\nDistrict 204 appealed this ruling.\n\n\n\n   2\n     Because of the procedural history of this case, District 204 has never\nhad the opportunity to establish the truth of these statements. While this\ncourt takes no position on the veracity of these assertions, we include them\nto illustrate the basis of District 204’s EEOA claim.\n   3\n    Public Act 91–46, which became effective on June 30, 1999, changed\nthe body responsible for reviewing a section 7–2b petition from the Illinois\nState Board of Education to the Regional Board of School Trustees. This\nmodification has no bearing on this opinion.\n\n                                    -4-\n\f     On appeal, the appellate court affirmed that the EEOA claim was\nbeyond the Board’s authority, but vacated the circuit court’s ruling on\nthe merits of the EEOA claim and remanded the cause to the hearing\nofficer to develop a record on the EEOA claim.\n     The appellate court agreed that the limiting clause of section 7–2b\nprohibited the Board from hearing or considering District 204’s\nEEOA claim. Specifically, the appellate court held that the Board\n“acted in accord with its mandate when it refused to determine\nwhether section 7–2b or the proposed detachment/annexation violated\nthe [EEOA].” 373 Ill. App. 3d at 568.\n     The appellate court went on to conclude that section 7–2b not\nonly stripped the Board of jurisdiction over the EEOA claim, but also\ndenied jurisdiction over the claim to the circuit court under\nadministrative review law. The appellate court noted that the circuit\ncourt’s power to review the decisions of administrative agencies is\nlimited in scope to the statutory powers provided by the General\nAssembly. 373 Ill. App. 3d at 569, quoting Ill. Const. 1970, art. VI,\n§9 (“Circuit Courts shall have such power to review administrative\naction as provided by law”). The Code of Civil Procedure provides\nthat a hearing for administrative review is limited to questions of law\nand fact that are presented to the court by the record. “No new or\nadditional evidence *** shall be heard by the court.” 735 ILCS\n5/3–110 (West 2006). The appellate court reasoned that because\nsection 7–2b limited the Board’s authority to reviewing only the\nprocedural requirements for a petition for detachment and annexation,\nthe circuit court’s authority on administrative review was similarly\n“limited to determining whether the Board erred in finding those\nrequirements met.” 373 Ill. App. 3d at 570. Accordingly, the appellate\ncourt vacated the circuit court’s determination that the Board’s\nactions did not violate federal law, reasoning that the Board itself “did\nnot have jurisdiction to even develop a record which the circuit court\ncould then rely upon in formulating any constitutional decision.” 373\nIll. App. 3d at 570. Thus, the “circuit court lacked both the\njurisdiction and the evidence to make such an independent finding.”\n373 Ill. App. 3d at 569.\n     Finally, the appellate court found that section 7–2b was\npreempted by the EEOA and remanded the cause to the Board to\nconduct a hearing on District 204’s EEOA claim. The appellate court\n\n                                  -5-\n\fnoted that “ ‘state law is nullified to the extent that it actually\nconflicts with federal law.’ ” 373 Ill.

App. 3d at 573.\n    In its petition for leave to appeal to this court, the Board argues\nthat the appellate court erred in holding that section 7–2b was\npreempted by the EEOA. We granted the Board’s petition. For the\nfollowing reasons, we reverse the decision of the appellate court.\n\n                      QUESTION PRESENTED\n    Both parties agree that District 204’s EEOA claim must be heard\nand decided by a body of competent jurisdiction. The parties disagree\nover the proper means of effectuating this hearing.\n    The Board, as appellant, takes the position that the EEOA does\nnot require the Board to review EEOA claims and that these claims\nare better developed in and decided by the circuit court. Conversely,\nDistrict 204 argues that the EEOA mandates that an “educational\nagency,” in this case the Board, consider its EEOA claim. Therefore,\nDistrict 204 asserts that the appellate court was correct and that\nsection 7–2b must be preempted because it conflicts with the EEOA\nby prohibiting the Board from hearing the EEOA claim.\n    District 204 further argues that the Board’s position is infeasible,\nas the circuit court is prohibited from considering its EEOA claims\nbecause administrative review is the exclusive means of reviewing an\n\n                                  -6-\n\fadministrative decision and section 7–2b prevents the development\nof a record that is sufficient given the limited scope of administrative\nreview. Thus, District 204 argues that the current legislative\nframework is preempted because it is intentionally crafted to make it\n“impossible for a factual record regarding the effect of segregation to\nbe considered when determining whether to grant a petition for\ndetachment.” District 204 notes that “[s]tates have an affirmative duty\nto take measures to comply with the mandate set forth in the EEOA,”\nand that the current legislative framework represents the General\nAssembly’s “naked attempt to sidestep the federal mandate set forth\nin the EEOA.”\n     There are then two areas of dispute between the parties. First, the\nparties argue whether the EEOA requires that the Board consider the\nEEOA in granting a petition for detachment/annexation. Second, if\nthe Board does not have to consider the EEOA, the parties dispute\nwhether the circuit court can review an alleged violation outside of\nadministrative review.\n     The resolution of both arguments turns on the constitutional law\ndoctrine of preemption. However, in the first argument, preemption\nis only implicated if we agree with District 204’s interpretation of the\nEEOA. Therefore, the initial question presented for the first argument\nis a question of statutory interpretation, as this court must determine\nwhat the EEOA mandates of an “educational agency.”\n     The second argument presents a question of preemption, as this\ncourt must determine whether the current legislative framework\ncreates a situation where the state can avoid compliance with “the\nmandate set forth in the EEOA.”\n\n                     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n     Whether state law is preempted by a federal statute is a question\nof law, which is subject to de novo review.

The\npreemption doctrine originates with the supremacy clause of article\nVI of the United States Constitution, which provides that the “Laws\nof the United States *** shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and\nJudges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the\nConstitution or laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.”\nU.S. Const., art. VI, cl. 2. Thus, when state law conflicts with a\nfederal statute, state law is preempted by the supremacy clause and its\napplication is unconstitutional. Crosby v.

Ct. at 404 n.20).\n    In the present case, the Board asserts that the appellate court erred\nin finding preemption on two bases. First, that the EEOA does not\nrequire that the Board, as an “educational agency,” consider the\nsegregative effect that a section 7–2b petition would have on the\nparties. Second, that review of District 204’s EEOA claim can be had\noutside of administrative review under the circuit court’s original\njurisdiction. We will address each argument in turn.\n\n                                     I\n     The first argument presented by the Board that the appellate court\nerred in finding that the EEOA preempts section 7–2b is that “nothing\nin the EEOA specifically requires [EEOA] claims to be decided by\nthe [Board], rather than by a circuit court.” Under the Board’s view,\nthe two statutes do not directly conflict and, therefore, the limiting\nclause of section 7–2b is constitutional.\n     District 204, in reply, argues that the EEOA requires an\n“educational agency” to consider racial segregation in making school\nassignment decisions. Thus, District 204 argues that section 7–2b’s\nlimiting clause prevents the Board from considering the EEOA and\nis thus preempted.\n     Both parties agree that section 7–2b’s limiting clause prevents the\nBoard from considering the EEOA in making decisions on\ndetachment/annexation petitions. The limiting clause of section 7–2b\nstates that the Board “shall have no authority or discretion to hear any\nevidence or consider any issues except those that may be necessary to\ndetermine whether the limitations and conditions of this Section have\nbeen met.” 105 ILCS 5/7–2b (West 1998). As noted previously,\nsection 7–2b contains four provisions that must be met before a\npetition for detachment/annexation can be granted. EEOA compliance\nis not among these four factors. See 105 ILCS 5/7–2b (West 1998).\n     However, the parties disagree as to what the EEOA requires of\n“educational agencies.” District 204 cites to section 1703 of the\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\fEEOA to support its conclusion that educational agencies are required\nto enforce the EEOA. Section 1703 states:\n             “No State shall deny equal educational opportunity to an\n         individual on account of his or her race, color, sex, or national\n         origin, by–\n                 (a) the deliberate segregation by an educational\n             agency of students on the basis of race, color, or national\n             origin among or within schools;\n                  ***\n                  (c) the assignment by an educational agency of a\n             student to a school, other than the one closest to his or her\n             place of residence within the school district in which he\n             or she resides, if the assignment results in a greater degree\n             of segregation *** than would result if such students were\n             assigned to the school closest to his or her place of\n             residence ***.” (Emphases added.) 20 U.S.C. §1703\n             (2000).\nDistrict 204 reads section 1703 as a requirement that the Board, as an\neducational agency,4 not only refrain from engaging in discriminatory\nconduct, but affirmatively consider whether a proposed\ndetachment/annexation petition would violate the EEOA.\n    The resolution of this argument rests on statutory interpretation\ngrounds, as this court must decide whether Congress intended to\ncharge “educational agencies” with an affirmative duty to consider\nthe EEOA before making an administrative decision.\n    The goal of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and give effect\nto the intent of the legislative body. The simplest and surest means of\neffectuating this goal is to read the statutory language itself and give\nthe words their plain and ordinary meaning.

A “dual school system” is one\n“in which students are assigned to schools solely on the basis of race,\ncolor, sex, or national origin.” 20 U.S.C. §1702(a)(1) (2000). The\nremedies specified by Congress as part of the EEOA are “not\nintended to modify or diminish the authority of the courts of the\nUnited States.” 20 U.S.C. §1702(b) (2000).\n     Section 1703 of the EEOA expressly forbids the states from\ndenying equal educational opportunity when it states that “[n]o State\nshall deny equal educational opportunity to an individual on account\nof his or her race, color, sex, or national origin.” 20 U.S.C. §1703\n(2000). The EEOA goes on to list a number of ways that a state can\ndeny equal educational opportunity. Each of these examples\nanticipates that an “educational agency” has undertaken the\ndiscriminatory action or failed to rectify previous discriminatory\nactions. (I.e., “the failure of an educational agency *** to take\naffirmative steps *** to remove the vestiges of a dual school system”\n(20 U.S.C. §1703(b) (2000)) and “discrimination by an educational\nagency *** in the employment, employment conditions, or\nassignment to schools of its faculty or staff” (20 U.S.C. §1703(d)\n(2000)).)\n     The EEOA views “educational agencies” as the political\nsubdivision of the state that is either engaging in discrimination or\nfailing to rectify past discrimination. The EEOA defines an\n“educational agency” as “a local educational agency or a ‘State\neducational agency’ as defined by section 801(k) of the Elementary\nand Secondary Education Act of 1965.” 20 U.S.C. §1720 (2000).5 A\n“local educational agency” is defined as:\n\n\n   5\n    The definitions of “local educational agency” and “State educational\nagency” have subsequently been recodified multiple times. The definitions\nare now available at 20 U.S.C. §7801 (Supp. 2005).\n\n                                  -11-\n\f             “[A] public board of education or other public authority\n        legally constituted within a State for either administrative\n        control or direction of, or to perform a service function for,\n        public elementary schools or secondary schools in a city,\n        county, township, school district, or other political\n        subdivision of a State, or of or for a combination of school\n        districts or counties that is recognized in a State as an\n        administrative agency for its public elementary schools or\n        secondary schools.” (Emphases added.) 20 U.S.C.\n        §7801(26)(A) (Supp. 2005).\nA “State educational agency” is similarly defined as “the State\neducational agency in a State in which the State educational agency\nis the sole educational agency for all public schools.” 20 U.S.C.\n§7801(26)(E) (Supp. 2005).\n    The combination of the EEOA’s prohibition on states denying\nindividuals access to equal educational opportunity and the definition\nof an “educational agency” as a political subdivision of the state\ndemonstrates that Congress intended that states and their “educational\nagencies” not engage in discriminatory conduct. This point is\nreinforced by District 204 when they cite Gomez v. Illinois State\nBoard of Education, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"483297\"><a href=\"/opinion/483297/jorge-gomez-v-illinois-state-board-of-education-and-ted-sanders-in-his/\"><span class=\"volume\">811</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1030</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th Cir. 1987), to support its\ncontention that the Board is responsible for enforcement of the EEOA\nas well as the courts. Gomez, 811 F.2d at 1038 (“relief is to be\nobtained from the state and its agencies”). However, the quotation\nused by District 204, taken in context, shows that relief was “to be\nobtained from the state and its agencies” in court. The passage from\nGomez cited by District 204 went on to include the 7th Circuit’s\nholding, which was that “Congress intended to abrogate the states’\nEleventh Amendment immunity to the extent such immunity would\nforeclose recovery under that act.” Gomez, 811 F.2d at 1038. In other\nwords, Gomez stands for the proposition that the EEOA allows the\ncourts to hold the state and its agencies liable for past discriminatory\nactions. It does not stand for the idea that the Board must adjudicate\nor even consider the racially discriminatory impact of its actions.\n    The prohibition on acting in a discriminatory way is not the same\nas an affirmative mandate to take certain actions or to conduct formal\nproceedings to ensure that the actions taken are not discriminatory.\nThere is no language in the EEOA that prescribes that any state or\n\n                                 -12-\n\f“educational agency” take any affirmative step to consider the\nsegregative effects of their actions prior to taking them.\n    What the EEOA does provide is that if the state or an\n“educational agency” does take a discriminatory action or has taken\na discriminatory action in the past that these “agencies” may either\ntake voluntary steps to remedy the past discrimination (20 U.S.C.\n§1716 (2000)) or in the absence of action that these agencies are\nliable in court (20 U.S.C. §§1712, 1713, 1714, 1716, 1717, 1718\n(2000)).\n    Certainly, a state can choose to mandate that its “educational\nagency” consider the EEOA in granting a petition for\ndetachment/annexation. However, the EEOA does not require that\nstates mandate educational agencies to consider the EEOA or vest\nthem with the power to consider the segregative effect of\ndetachment/annexation petitions. Preemption requires an actual\nconflict such that “it is impossible *** to comply with both state and\nfederal law” and where the challenged law “stands as an obstacle to\nthe accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives\nof Congress.” Crosby, 530 U.S. at 372-73, 147 L. Ed. 2d at 361, 120\nS. Ct. at 2294. That is not the case here.\n    The EEOA uses the term “educational agencies” to describe\npotential discriminatory actors, but ultimately it is the discriminatory\nactions of the state and its agencies that are to be corrected by the\ncourt. It is the state that must provide relief for the discriminatory\nactions of its subdivisions. Under the supremacy clause, “state courts\nshare responsibility for the application and enforcement of federal\nlaw” (Howlett v.

Howlett, 496 U.S. at 369-73, 110 L. Ed. 2d at 348-51, 110\nS. Ct. at 2439-41. Illinois recognizes numerous claims for both racial\ndiscrimination and the invalidation of agency actions. See, e.g., Board\nof Education v. Cady, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">369</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill.

Therefore, the courts\n\n\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\fof Illinois have an obligation to review and enforce the EEOA.6 It is\nthis obligation that we direct our attention to next.\n\n                                    II\n    The second argument presented by the Board to refute the\nappellate court’s finding of preemption is that administrative review\nis not the exclusive means of challenging the Board’s decision to\ngrant a petition for detachment/annexation. The Board argues that\nDistrict 204’s EEOA claim may be brought under the circuit court’s\noriginal jurisdiction.\n    District 204 counters that the EEOA requires states to take\naffirmative steps to “remove vestiges of a dual school system” and to\nnot “deny equal educational opportunity to an individual on account\nof his or her race, color, sex, or national origin.” 20 U.S.C. §1703\n(2000). District 204 asserts that administrative review is the exclusive\nmeans of reviewing the Board’s decision because the administrative\nreview law states that “[e]very action to review a final administrative\ndecision shall be commenced by the filing of a complaint and the\nissuance of summons.” 735 ILCS 5/3–103 (West 2006). In the present\ncase, District 204 seeks review of a final decision of an administrative\nagency. Further, District 204 notes that on administrative review, the\ncircuit court is limited to the record developed before the\nadministrative body (see 735 ILCS 5/3–110 (West 2006)) and section\n7–2b prohibits the Board from considering the EEOA. Thus, if\nadministrative review is the exclusive means of challenging the\nBoard’s decision, then section 7–2b, in conjunction with the scope of\nthe circuit court’s jurisdiction on administrative review, would\neffectively prohibit the state from stopping a potentially\ndiscriminatory action under the EEOA. Thus, the EEOA would\npreempt section 7–2b, as the EEOA mandates that the state must not\nallow discriminatory action.\n\n\n\n   6\n    This does not exclude the possibility that a federal claim is initially\nconsidered and decided by an administrative tribunal and comes before the\ncourt only under an exercise of the court’s statutory power for\nadministrative review.\n\n                                   -14-\n\f     Thus, District 204 asserts that either section 7–2b’s limiting\nclause or the administrative review statute must be invalidated and\nthereby allow for consideration of its EEOA claim. However, this\nproblem exists only if administrative review is the exclusive means\nof challenging the Board’s decision.\n     The Board asserts that the way to both obtain a hearing on the\nBoard’s decision and avoid declaring a statute unconstitutional is to\nallow District 204 to bring the EEOA claim as an independent cause\nof action under the circuit court’s original jurisdiction. This would\nallow District 204 to bring its EEOA claim in the circuit court and\ndevelop a factual record before the circuit court. Under the Board’s\nargument this action could either progress independently or be\nconsolidated with an action for administrative review. The Board\nnotes, and District 204 does not dispute, that under this approach\nthere is no preemption issue. In this way, District 204’s EEOA claim\ncan be fully litigated, and this court avoids invalidating a statute. For\nthe following reasons, we believe that this is the correct approach.\n     As a creation of statute, the Board may exercise only the authority\ngiven to it by statute. “Any power or authority it exercises must find\nits source within the law pursuant to which it was created.” Delgado\nv. Board of Election Commissioners, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">224</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">481</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 485 (2007). As\npreviously noted, section 7–2b’s limitation clause serves to severely\nlimit the evidence that a party may introduce into the record before\nthe Board. While the General Assembly could have vested the Board\nwith the power to hear District 204’s EEOA claim, it did not. So long\nas the right to equal educational opportunity can be vindicated,\nhowever, the wisdom of the General Assembly’s choice in this regard\nis not for this court to decide.\n     The Code of Civil Procedure states that on administrative review\nthe circuit court is limited to “questions of law and fact presented by\nthe entire record before the court. No new or additional evidence ***\nshall be heard by the court.” 735 ILCS 5/3–110 (West 2006).\nTherefore, to the extent that section 7–2b restricts the evidence that\nthe Board may place in the record, the circuit court is similarly\nrestricted in its administrative review. Thus, the circuit court on\nadministrative review is no better able to address District 204’s\nEEOA claims than the Board was in the first instance.\n\n\n                                  -15-\n\f    The Illinois Constitution of 1970 vests the circuit courts with\noriginal jurisdiction over “all justiciable matters except when the\nSupreme Court has original and exclusive jurisdiction.” Ill. Const.\n1970, art. VI, §9. As this court has noted,\n             “Our current constitution does not define the term\n        ‘justiciable matters,’ nor did our former constitution, in which\n        this term first appeared. See Ill. Const. 1970, art. VI, §9; Ill.\n        Const. 1870, art. VI, §9 (amended 1964). Generally, a\n        ‘justiciable matter’ is a controversy appropriate for review by\n        the court, in that it is definite and concrete, as opposed to\n        hypothetical or moot, touching upon the legal relations of\n        parties having adverse legal interests.” Belleville Toyota, Inc.\n        v. Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2020509\"><a href=\"/opinion/2020509/belleville-toyota-v-toyota-motor-sales/\"><span class=\"volume\">199</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">325</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 335\n        (2002).\n    In this case, there is a controversy between private citizens who\nwish to detach property from a government entity, the Board who\nwishes to defend the law, and a second government body that opposes\nthe proposed action. There is nothing abstract or moot about the\ncontroversy. It affects the legal relationship between the parties and\nthe parties have adverse legal interests. Therefore, the current case\nconstitutes a “justiciable matter” under the Illinois Constitution’s\ngrant of original jurisdiction to the circuit courts. In addition to the\ncase falling within the circuit court’s original jurisdiction, this case\nmay also be handled as an independent action because the traditional\nrules of forfeiture do not apply.\n    Ordinarily, any issue that is not raised before the administrative\nagency, even constitutional issues that the agency lacks the authority\nto decide, will be forfeited by the party failing to raise the issue. In\nCarpetland U.S.A., Inc. v. Illinois Department of Employment\nSecurity, this court refused to address a claim that the Department of\nEmployment Security had violated the due process clauses of both the\nUnited States Constitution and Illinois Constitution because the issue\nhad not been raised at the first opportunity, before the administrative\nagency.

The limiting clause of section 7–2b\ndenies District 204 all opportunity to develop a record with regard to\nan EEOA violation before the administrative agency. Thus, there can\nbe no forfeiture, because there was no opportunity to present the\nissue. In essence, there was no “first opportunity.”\n     Similarly, the exclusivity of the administrative review law does\nnot apply where, as described above, the issue being raised cannot be\nintroduced before the administrative agency. In the present case,\nsection 7–2b operates as a complete bar to the Board’s even receiving\nevidence on anything outside of section 7–2b’s requirements. Neither\nthe parties nor this court have found any similar limitation anywhere\nelse in the statutes of this state. As this court held in Chestnut v.\nLodge, “[t]he Administrative Review Act is a salutary act to provide\na simple single review from specified administrative decisions, but it\nwas not intended to be a trap for the unwary to establish a bar to\nrelief.” Chestnut v.

District 204’s\nEEOA claim is beyond the scope of the hearing officer, beyond the\nscope of the Board’s administrative decision, and therefore beyond\nthe scope of the administrative review law.\n     The Board points out that handling the EEOA claim as an\nindependent action under the circuit court’s original jurisdiction is not\nwithout precedent. In Board of Education of Rich Township High\nSchool District No. 227 v. Brown, the appellate court allowed a\nconstitutional challenge to section 7–2b to be brought as an\nindependent action in the circuit court. In doing so, the appellate court\nrejected an expansion of the Board’s power, holding that the limiting\nclause of section 7–2b expressly placed the issue outside of the\nBoard’s authority and outside the court’s statutory authority to review\nthe decisions of administrative agencies. Board of Education of Rich\nTownship High School District No. 227 v. Brown, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">311</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill.

However, the court noted that while the issue may be\n\n                                   -17-\n\foutside the scope of the administrative agency’s authority, and\noutside the scope of administrative review, it was not outside the\nscope of the circuit court’s original jurisdiction under the Illinois\nConstitution. Therefore, the court held that the circuit court could\ndevelop the record necessary to decide the constitutional challenge\nunder an exercise of the circuit court’s original jurisdiction. Rich\nTownship, 311 Ill. App. 3d at 491.7\n    District 204 contends that adopting this approach will allow\nschool district boundaries to be “redrawn without considering the\neffect of such a maneuver on educational segregation.” Neither party\ndisputes that District 204’s EEOA claim must be considered and\ndecided by a court of competent jurisdiction. Through the exercise of\nthe circuit court’s original jurisdiction, the circuit courts may conduct\nproceedings, receive evidence, and fully adjudicate District 204’s\nEEOA claim. Further, given the nature of this claim, there is no\nreason why a plaintiff could not seek an injunction pending resolution\nof this claim in the circuit court. See Ardt v.

(2000)).\nConsequently, this court further holds that the EEOA does not\npreempt and render unconstitutional section 7–2b of the Illinois\nSchool Code (105 ILCS 5/7–2b (West 1998)). Slip op. at 18-19.\n     I fully agree with the court’s reasoning and result. I write\nseparately to urge the General Assembly to amend section 7–2b of the\nSchool Code to allow a school board to hear disputes regarding equal\neducational opportunity when determining section 7–2b petitions.\nSuch disputes should be heard initially by a school board and not a\ncourt. Also, I caution the circuit court in this case, on remand, to base\nits findings on sufficient evidence and not conjecture.\n\n                          I. BACKGROUND\n     Four individuals who were all of the registered voters of a\ncontiguous 320-acre parcel of farm land in Will County petitioned the\nIllinois State Board of Education (Board) to detach their property\nfrom District 204 and annex it to Lincoln Way Community High\nSchool District No. 210 (District 210), pursuant to section 7–2b of the\nSchool Code (105 ILCS 5/7–2b (West 1998)). Section 7–2b provides\nthat, under specific circumstances, land may be automatically\ndetached from one district and annexed to another district, at either\nthe elementary or high school level. See M. Guenther & B. Wright,\nCreation, Dissolution, and Boundary Changes, in 1 Illinois School\nLaw §1.11 (Ill. Inst. for Cont. Legal Educ. 2005). The Board held an\nadministrative hearing on the detachment and annexation petition.\nDistrict 204 claimed, inter alia, that granting the petition would\nviolate the EEOA, which prohibits the transfer of a student from one\nschool to another if the transfer results in increasing student racial\n\n                                  -19-\n\fsegregation. See 20 U.S.C. §1703 (2000). District 204 alleged that\npetitioners are white, the population of District 204 is “60%\nminority,” and District 210 is “almost completely white.” District 204\nargued that granting the petition would increase racial segregation in\nviolation of the EEOA. The hearing officer specifically found that\nDistrict 204’s EEOA claim was beyond its statutory and regulatory\nauthority. It is undisputed that petitioners met section 7–2b’s four\nspecific conditions. Accordingly, the Board granted the section 7–2b\npetition. Slip op. at 2-4.\n    On administrative review, the circuit court confirmed the Board’s\ndecision granting the petition. Additionally, the circuit court\nindependently found that the Board’s decision did not “create a\nConstitutional impediment,” or violate federal law. On appeal, the\nappellate court: vacated the circuit court’s ruling on the merits of\nDistrict 204’s EEOA claim; held that the EEOA preempted section\n7–2b of the School Code and rendered it unconstitutional; and\nremanded the cause to the Board to conduct a hearing on the EEOA\nclaim. Slip op. at 4-5.\n\n                            II. ANALYSIS\n    Before this court, District 204 essentially raises two issues:\n            “The current legislative framework developed by the\n        General Assembly is a naked attempt [A] to sidestep the\n        federal mandate set forth in the EEOA by stripping away an\n        agency’s ability to consider the effect of detachment on racial\n        segregation, and [B] then tie the hand of the circuit courts on\n        review through application of the Administrative Review\n        Act.”\nWhile future litigation will shed light on the first claim, this court\ncorrectly rejects the second contention.\n\n    A. De Jure Segregation and Equal Educational Opportunity\n    Section 7–2b of the School Code mandates an automatic\ndetachment and annexation procedure that expressly prohibits\nconsideration of surrounding circumstances. This unique automatic\nprocedure can potentially promote illegal student segregation. The\npotential for such a consequence flies in the face of constitutional\n\n                                 -20-\n\fprinciples that the United States Supreme Court first enunciated over\n50 years ago, and decisions that this court issued over a century ago,\nupholding the right of children to attend public schools free of de jure\nsegregation.\n\n         1.

The Court in Brown observed that de jure (state-imposed)\nracial segregation of students is in itself an evil that tends to frustrate\nthe affected students “in a way unlikely ever to be undone.” Brown,\n347 U.S. at 494, 98 L. Ed. at 880, 74 S. Ct. at 691. The Court held as\nfollows:\n            “We conclude that in the field of public education the\n        doctrine of ‘separate but equal’ has no place. Separate\n        educational facilities are inherently unequal. Therefore, we\n        hold that the plaintiffs and others similarly situated for whom\n        the actions have been brought are, by reason of the\n        segregation complained of, deprived of the equal protection\n        of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.”\n        Brown, 347 U.S. at 495, 98 L. Ed. at 881, 74 S. Ct. at 692.\nBrown is significant partly because the United States Supreme Court\nreversed years of constitutional history that permitted the segregation\nof students based on race or color. “It righted a legal and moral\nwrong. But as important–perhaps more important–is that Brown\nushered in a new era of broader educational opportunity.” 4 J. Rapp,\nEducation Law §10.01[1], at 10–3 (2008). Today, the idea that\nsegregation based on race or color is inherently unequal is “a\nstatement of clear constitutional principle and not a matter of\neducational conjecture.” 4 J. Rapp, Education Law §10.05[1], at\n10–75 (2008).\n\n\n\n                                   -22-\n\f     The decision in Brown invalidated only de jure segregation in\npublic schools, i.e., segregation resulting from intentional\ngovernmental action.

Although often called de facto segregation, it is\nreally ‘covert de jure’ segregation.” E. Reutter, The Law of Public\nEducation 795 (3d ed. 1985). The Court emphasized that the crucial\ndifference between de jure and de facto segregation is the intent to\ndiscriminate.

The Act declares it to be a\npolicy of the United States that “all children enrolled in public\nschools are entitled to equal educational opportunity without regard\nto race, color, sex, or national origin.” 20 U.S.C. §1701(a)(1) (2000).8\nTo effectuate this policy, the EEOA prohibits in pertinent part:\n             “No State shall deny equal educational opportunity to an\n         individual on account of his or her race, color, sex, or national\n         origin, by–\n                                    ***\n                 (c) the assignment by an educational agency of a\n             student to a school, other than the one closest to his or her\n             place of residence within the school district in which he\n             or she resides, if the assignment results in a greater degree\n             of segregation of students on the basis of race, color, sex,\n             or national origin among the schools of such agency than\n             would result if such student were assigned to the school\n             closest to his or her place of residence within the school\n\n\n\n  8\n    The EEOA also declares it to be a policy of the United States that “the\nneighborhood is the appropriate basis for determining public school\nassignments.” 20 U.S.C. §1701(a)(2) (2000). It is generally recognized that\nCongress enacted the EEOA in reaction to court decisions upholding busing\nas a means of remedying de jure segregation. See 4 J.

Segregation in Illinois Schools\n     De jure racial segregation existed in Illinois at the time of the\nratification of the fourteenth amendment. In 1825, the General\nAssembly provided for the establishment of public schools, which\nwere “open and free to every class of white citizens, between the ages\nof five and twenty-one years.” (Emphasis added.) 1833 Ill. Laws 556.\nThe 1857 School Code did not expressly exclude black children from\npublic schools but, rather, impliedly limited public schools to white\nchildren. 1857 Ill. Laws 260, §7 (requiring state superintendent to\nperiodically report to Governor on, inter alia, “the number of white\npersons in each county under twenty-one years of age”), 1857 Ill.\nLaws 263, §16 (requiring school commissioner to apportion state\nfunds among school districts in county based on, in part, “the number\nof white children, under twenty-one years of age”), 1857 Ill. Laws\n292, §80 (“In townships in which there shall be persons of color the\nboard of trustees shall allow such persons a portion of the school fund\nequal to the amount of taxes collected for school purposes from such\npersons of color in their respective townships”); see generally B.\nReams & P. Wilson, Segregation and The Fourteenth Amendment in\nthe States 138-54 (1975); D. Douglas, The Limits of Law in\n\n\n\n                                 -25-\n\fAccomplishing Racial Change: School Segregation in the Pre-Brown\nNorth, 44 UCLA L. Rev. 677, 695-96 (1997).\n    In 1867, the General Assembly ratified the fourteenth amendment.\nIn 1874, the legislature enacted legislation that expressly prohibited\nthe exclusion of any child from a public school based on race. Ill.\nRev. Stat. 1874, ch. 122, par. 100. In a series of decisions beginning\nin 1874, this court repeatedly ruled against racial segregation in\neducation in the face of local defiance.

Detachment and Annexation: Overall Benefit\n    “The most typical” school boundary changes are the result of the\ndetachment of a portion of school district territory and its annexation\nto another school district. See C. Russo & R. Mawdsley, Education\nLaw §1.04[3], at 1–19 through 1–20 (2008). In Illinois, school district\nboundaries may be changed by detachment, annexation, division,\ndissolution, or by any combination of those methods pursuant to\narticle 7 of the School Code. 105 ILCS 5/7–02 (West 2006). The\ngeneral method for detachment and annexation involves a petition\nprocess, administrative hearings, and the potential for judicial review\npursuant to the Administrative Review Law (735 ILCS 5/3–101 et\nseq. (West 2006)). See 105 ILCS 5/7–1, 7–2, 7–6, 7–7 (West 2006).\n    At the administrative hearing on a detachment and annexation\npetition, section 7-6 of the School Code mandates that the hearing\nofficer:\n             “shall hear evidence as to the school needs and conditions\n         of the territory in the area within and adjacent thereto and as\n         to the ability of the districts affected to meet the standards of\n         recognition as prescribed by the State Board of Education,\n         and shall take into consideration the division of funds and\n         assets which will result from the change of boundaries and\n         shall determine whether it is to the best interests of the\n         schools of the area and the educational welfare of the pupils\n\n                                  -26-\n\f        that such change in boundaries be granted ***.” 105 ILCS\n        5/7–6(i) (West 2006).\nBased on the language of section 7–6, a petition for detachment and\nannexation should be granted only where the overall benefit to the\nannexing district and the detachment area clearly outweighs the\nresulting detriment to the losing district and the surrounding\ncommunity as a whole. Carver v. Bond/Fayette/Effingham Regional\nBoard of School Trustees, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2249949\"><a href=\"/opinion/2249949/carver-v-bondfayetteeffingham-bd-of-sch-trustees/\"><span class=\"volume\">146</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">347</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 356 (1992) (collecting\ncases).\n    In applying this benefit-detriment test, the hearing board, and the\ncourts reviewing the board’s decision, are to consider differences\nbetween school facilities and curricula, the distances from the\npetitioners’ homes to the respective schools, the effect detachment\nwould have on the ability of either district to meet state standards of\nrecognition, and the impact of the proposed boundary change on the\ntax revenues of both districts. Carver, 146 Ill. 2d at 356. The hearing\nboard may also consider the closely related “whole child” and\n“community of interest” factors. The “whole child” factor “recognizes\nthat extracurricular participation in social, religious and even\ncommercial activities is important in a child’s development as a\nbeneficial supplement to the child’s academic involvement.” Board\nof Education of Golf School District No. 67 v. Regional Board of\nSchool Trustees of Cook County, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2236371\"><a href=\"/opinion/2236371/bd-of-educ-of-golf-school-dist-v-regional-bd-of-school-trustees/\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">392</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 397 (1982). The\n“community of interest” factor ascertains whether the petitioning area\nis identified with the school district and the community to which\nannexation is requested. If a child attends school in his or her natural\ncommunity, it not only enhances the child’s educational opportunity\nbut encourages the child’s participation in social and other\nextracurricular activities that figure importantly in the “whole child”\nconcept. Golf, 89 Ill. 2d at 397-98. Further, consideration of the racial\nimpact of a school district boundary change is relevant to a\ndetachment and annexation proceeding “to ensure that a dual school\nsystem based upon race, national origin, or color does not result.” C.\nRusso & R. Mawdsley, Education Law §1.04[3], at 1–19, 1–20\n(2008).

Menacker, Illinois Detachment Legislation: A Device\nfor Creating Manageable Urban School Districts, 81 Educ. L. Rep.\n411, 414-19 (1993). However, in enacting the automatic detachment\nprocedure in section 7–2b of the School Code, the legislature\npointedly rejected this well-settled holistic approach.\n\n                 6. Section 7–2b: Automatic Procedure\n     Section 7–2b of the School Code provides for the detachment and\nannexation of noncoterminous land from an elementary or high\nschool district. In contrast to the procedure for detachment and\nannexation generally, section 7–2b mandates that a detachment and\nannexation petition “shall” be granted if the affected land constitutes\n10% or less of the district’s equalized assessed value and of its\nterritory; two-thirds of the registered voters in affected area support\nthe petition; and the annexation will make the boundaries of the\nelementary school and high school districts for the affected land\nidentical. 105 ILCS 5/7–2b(a) (West 1998); slip op. at 3.\n     The legislature originally added this procedure to the School Code\nin 1991. Pub. Act 87–667, eff. September 20, 1991 (adding Ill. Rev.\nStat. 1991, ch. 122, par. 7–2b). Further, to ensure that this procedure\nis truly automatic, the legislature subsequently added a directive to\nsection 7–2b, which at the time of these proceedings read as follows:\n         “The regional board of school trustees shall have no authority\n         or discretion to hear any evidence or consider any issues\n         except those that may be necessary to determine whether the\n         limitations and conditions of this Section have been met.”\n         Pub. Act 87–1270, §2, eff. March 3, 1993 (amending Ill. Rev.\n         Stat. 1991, ch. 122, par. 7–2b).\nAmong the issues that the legislature expressly excludes from\nconsideration is whether granting a detachment and annexation\n\n                                 -28-\n\fpetition would deny public school children the equal educational\nopportunity guaranteed by the equal protection clause of the\nfourteenth amendment. Obviously, such a result is untenable.\n     School authorities have the primary responsibility for elucidating,\nassessing, and solving the problem of unconstitutional racial\ndiscrimination in public education.

Mawdsley, Education Law §1.04[3], at 1–19, 1–20 (2008).\nSurprisingly, the General Assembly expressly prohibits the Board\nfrom even considering this constitutional issue when presented with\na section 7–2b petition. In a case presenting a more blatant example\nof legislative obstructionism, the United States Supreme Court\ndeclared as follows:\n         “[T]he prohibitions of the Fourteenth Amendment extend to\n         all action of the State denying equal protection of the laws;\n         whatever the agency of the State taking the action [citations];\n         or whatever the guise in which it is taken [citations].

Surprisingly, the circuit court made the following\nindependent finding in confirming the Board’s grant of the section\n7–2b petition:\n            “While one may have suspicions as to why property\n        owners may want to detach their land from one district and\n        attach it to another, mere suspicions are not enough. There is\n        nothing in this record to establish any type of racial\n        motivation on the part of the parties seeking disconnection.\n        On the record before the Hearing Officer it appears that the\n\n                                 -30-\n\f         reason for the disconnection was to properly align elementary\n         and high school boundaries so that students who attend New\n         Lennox Grade School District 122 could attend [h]igh school\n         at Lincolnway with their friends.\n             Now, this court is not so naïve as to not understand that\n         there may well be an economic benefit to a developer going\n         from one school district to another.
