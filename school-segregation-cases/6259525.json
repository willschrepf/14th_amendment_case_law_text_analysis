See\n\nTex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. § 51.014(a)(8) (West Supp. 2017). We reverse\n\nthe trial court’s order and render judgment granting the University’s plea and\n\ndismissing the appellee’s claims against the University with prejudice.\n\n\n\n\n                                         1\n \n\f \n \n\n\n\n\n                                  BACKGROUND\n\n      In August 2014, the appellee, Dr. Steve Jenkins, sued the University for\n\nalleged retaliation in violation of section 21.055 of the Texas Commission on Human\n\nRights Act (TCHRA). See Tex. Labor Code Ann. § 21.055 (West 2015). In his\n\npetition, Jenkins alleged that the University had retaliated against him by denying\n\nhis application for promotion to the academic rank of Full Professor, with\n\naccompanying tenure status, because Jenkins had opposed the University’s use of\n\nthe Graduate Records Exam (GRE) as a criteria for admission into the University’s\n\nCollege of Education’s graduate program. According to Jenkins, he opposed the\n\nUniversity’s use of the GRE because it is an inherently racist test that the University\n\nused as a threshold discriminatory entry requirement to exclude or limit downstream\n\nemployment of minority professional educator administrators in Texas public\n\nschools. Jenkins maintained that the College Dean and the chairman of the\n\nDepartment of Educational Leadership opposed his application for promotion and\n\ntenure because Jenkins had opposed the use of the GRE for ethical reasons, and the\n\nUniversity’s President and Provost arbitrarily ratified the decision of the Dean, rather\n\nthan the larger body of the University’s tenured faculty who supported his\n\napplication.\n\n\n\n\n                                           2\n \n\f \n \n\n\n\n\n      The University filed a plea to the jurisdiction asserting that Jenkins’s\n\nretaliation claim under section 21.055 of the TCHRA is based on an admission\n\npractice to a graduate program and not on an unlawful discriminatory employment\n\npractice. According to the University, because Jenkins failed to allege a prima facie\n\nviolation under the TCHRA, there is no waiver of sovereign immunity, and the trial\n\ncourt should dismiss the suit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Jenkins filed a\n\nresponse to the University’s plea to the jurisdiction, arguing that the University’s\n\ndiscriminatory admissions practice was an unlawful employment practice because\n\nthe use of the GRE excluded racial minorities and women from being hired in the\n\ndoctoral program and from gaining teaching experience at the University. The trial\n\ncourt conducted a hearing on the University’s plea to the jurisdiction, during which\n\nJenkins’s counsel requested the opportunity to amend the pleadings to supplement\n\nthe factual allegations supporting Jenkins’s retaliation claim. The record shows that\n\nthe trial court granted the University’s plea to the jurisdiction and also granted\n\nJenkins leave to amend his petition.\n\n      Jenkins filed an amended petition alleging that the University had retaliated\n\nagainst him for opposing the College of Education’s discriminatory admission\n\npractice of using the GRE to deprive qualified female and minority instructors the\n\nopportunity to teach at the University. Jenkins also sought a declaratory judgment\n\n                                          3\n \n\f \n \n\n\n\n\nunder the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act (UDJA) declaring that the University\n\nhad violated Jenkins’s rights secured by the TCHRA, as well as his rights to free\n\nspeech and due course of law secured by the Texas Constitution. See Tex. Const. art.\n\nI, §§ 19; Tex. Labor Code Ann. § 21.055; Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. §§\n\n37.001-37.011 (West 2015).\n\n      The University argued that Jenkins’s amended petition failed to allege that\n\nJenkins had engaged in a protected activity because Jenkins’s retaliation claim was\n\nnot based on an unlawful employment practice under the TCHRA. The University\n\nfurther contended that Jenkins failed to plead a viable UDJA claim because Jenkins\n\nhad not challenged the constitutionality of a statute or ordinance, alleged that state\n\nofficials in their official capacities had violated his constitutional rights, or sought\n\nto compel the University to follow the law in the future. Concerning Jenkins’s\n\nconstitutional claims, the University asserted that Jenkins had failed to plead a viable\n\ndue-course-of-law claim because Jenkins did not have a protected liberty or property\n\ninterest in his continued employment or in obtaining tenure, and that there is no\n\nprivate cause of action for a free speech claim.\n\n      Jenkins filed a response to the University’s amended plea to the jurisdiction,\n\narguing that the University had failed to appeal the trial court’s October 2016 order,\n\nin which Jenkins claims that the trial court denied the University’s plea to the\n\n                                           4\n \n\f \n \n\n\n\n\njurisdiction, and that the University could not revive the right to an interlocutory\n\nappeal by filing a duplicate plea to Jenkins’s amended petition. Jenkins also argued\n\nthat the University’s plea to the jurisdiction is actually a time-barred Rule 91a\n\nmotion to dismiss, and that the University is attempting to characterize its pleading\n\nsufficiency challenge as a jurisdictional argument. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 91a.\n\nAccording to Jenkins, the TCHRA forbids retaliation against a person who opposes\n\na “discriminatory practice,” and discrimination in employment and discrimination\n\nto or in a training program are both discriminatory practices under the TCHRA.\n\nJenkins argued that his retaliation claim opposed a discriminatory employment\n\npractice because the doctoral program included the opportunity to teach at the\n\nUniversity. Jenkins further argued that he had opposed the University’s\n\ndiscrimination in admission to or participation in a training program on the basis of\n\nrace, national origin, and gender, which is also a protected activity under the\n\nTCHRA. See Tex. Labor Code Ann. § 21.054(a) (West 2015); Id. § 21.055. Jenkins\n\nalso maintained that the trial court had jurisdiction over his UDJA claims.\n\n      The University disputed Jenkins’s contention that the University’s doctoral\n\nprogram is a “training program” under the TCHRA. The University argued that the\n\ndoctoral program is a degree-earning educational program and not a job-related\n\ntraining program, and that the graduate students in the program are not provided an\n\n                                         5\n \n\f \n \n\n\n\n\nopportunity to teach at the University. According to the University, section 21.054\n\nof the TCHRA prohibits an employer or a labor organization from discriminating in\n\nthe admission to an apprenticeship, on-the-job training, or other training or retraining\n\nprogram, and that such training programs vastly differ in purpose and effect from\n\nthe University’s doctoral program. See id. § 21.054(a). The University argued that\n\nthe purpose of putting “training program” in the TCHRA was to prohibit\n\ndiscrimination in the skilled, labor-union trades, and unlike an individual in a skilled\n\ncraft apprenticeship or training program, a graduate of the doctoral program is not\n\nautomatically entitled to employment in his field. The University further argued that\n\nJenkins’s attempt to couch his retaliation claim as an employment practice is too\n\nattenuated, because admission into the doctoral program does not guarantee\n\nemployment as an instructor.\n\n      The trial court conducted a hearing on the University’s amended plea to the\n\njurisdiction, and after hearing the parties’ arguments, denied the University’s\n\namended plea without issuing findings of fact and conclusions of law. The\n\nUniversity filed this interlocutory appeal. We note that Jenkins contends that this\n\nCourt lacks jurisdiction over the University’s interlocutory appeal because the\n\nUniversity did not appeal from the trial court’s order granting Jenkins’s request to\n\nreplead and because the University’s amended plea to the jurisdiction did not assert\n\n                                           6\n \n\f \n \n\n\n\n\nany new grounds. We disagree with Jenkins’s contention, as the record fails to show\n\nthat the trial court denied the University’s original plea to the jurisdiction or that the\n\nUniversity’s amended plea to the jurisdiction was merely a motion to reconsider the\n\ndenial of its original plea. Cf. City of Houston v. Estate of Jones, 388 S.W.3d 663,\n\n667 (Tex. 2012). Our review of the record shows that the trial court granted the\n\nUniversity’s original plea to the jurisdiction, and the University’s amended plea\n\naddressed Jenkins’s UDJA claim, which Jenkins added in his first amended petition.\n\nWe also disagree with Jenkins’s contention that the University’s plea to the\n\njurisdiction improperly challenges Jenkins’s pleadings and is merely a time-barred\n\nRule 91a motion to dismiss. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 91a; Tex. Dep’t of Parks & Wildlife\n\nv. Miranda, 133 S.W.3d 217, 227 (Tex. 2004).\n\n              PLEAS TO THE JURISDICTION IN TCHRA CLAIMS\n\n      Governmental units, such as the University, are generally immune from suit.\n\nSee San Antonio Water Sys. v. Nicholas, 461 S.W.3d 131, 135 (Tex. 2015); see also\n\nPrairie View A&M Univ. v. Chatha, 381 S.W.3d 500, 510 (Tex. 2012). The\n\nLegislature has waived immunity for claims properly brought under the TCHRA.\n\nNicholas, 461 S.W.3d at 135. The waiver extends to “only . . . those suits where the\n\nplaintiff actually alleges a violation of the TCHRA by pleading facts that state a\n\nclaim thereunder.” Mission Consol. Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Garcia, 372 S.W.3d 629,\n\n                                            7\n \n\f \n \n\n\n\n\n636 (Tex. 2012). Absent a pleading that sets forth a prima facie case, the\n\ngovernmental unit’s immunity from suit has not been waived. Id. at 637.\n\n       A governmental unit may challenge the existence of a prima facie case\n\nthrough a plea to the jurisdiction. Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 226. We review de novo\n\na trial court’s disposition of a plea to the jurisdiction. Id. at 226, 228. First, we focus\n\non the plaintiff’s petition to determine whether the facts that were pleaded\n\naffirmatively demonstrate that subject matter jurisdiction exists. Id. at 226. We\n\nconstrue the pleadings liberally in favor of the plaintiff. Id. If the plaintiff has not\n\naffirmatively pleaded facts to support the trial court’s jurisdiction, the issue is one\n\nof pleading sufficiency, and the trial court should provide the plaintiff the\n\nopportunity to amend the pleading to cure any jurisdictional defects. Id. at 226-27.\n\nHowever, if the pleadings affirmatively negate the existence of jurisdiction, the trial\n\ncourt may grant the plea to the jurisdiction without allowing the plaintiff the\n\nopportunity to amend. Id. at 227.\n\n      If a plea to the jurisdiction challenges the existence of jurisdictional facts, the\n\ntrial court may consider relevant evidence and is required to do so when necessary\n\nto resolve the jurisdictional issues raised. Id. When evidence is submitted that\n\nimplicates the merits of the case, the trial court reviews the relevant evidence to\n\ndetermine whether a fact issue exists, and if the evidence creates a fact question\n\n                                            8\n \n\f \n \n\n\n\n\nregarding jurisdiction, the trial court cannot grant the plea to the jurisdiction. Id. at\n\n227-28. If the relevant evidence fails to raise a fact question, then the trial court can\n\nrule on the plea as a matter of law. Id. at 228. This standard of review generally\n\nmirrors the summary judgment standard under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure\n\n166a(c), as it places the burden on the governmental unit to present evidence to\n\ndemonstrate that the trial court lacks subject matter jurisdiction. Id.; see also Tex. R.\n\nCiv. P. 166a(c).\n\n      If the governmental unit meets its initial burden, the burden then shifts to the\n\nplaintiff to show that a disputed material fact exists regarding the jurisdictional issue.\n\nMiranda, 133 S.W.3d at 228. We take as true all evidence that is favorable to the\n\nplaintiff and indulge every reasonable inference and resolve any doubts in the\n\nplaintiff’s favor. Id. If the evidence creates a fact question regarding the\n\njurisdictional issue, the trial court cannot grant the plea because fact questions must\n\nbe resolved by the finder of fact. Id. at 228.\n\n                                      ANALYSIS\n\n      In issue one, the University argues that Jenkins failed to establish a waiver of\n\nsovereign immunity because Jenkins failed to plead a prima facie case of retaliation\n\nunder the TCHRA. According to the University, its use of the GRE as an admissions\n\nrequirement to the doctoral program is not an “unlawful employment practice” under\n\n                                            9\n \n\f \n \n\n\n\n\nthe TCHRA. See Tex. Labor Code Ann. §§ 21.051, 21.055 (West 2015). The\n\nUniversity further argues that its doctoral program is not a job-related training\n\nprogram under the TCHRA. See id. § 21.054.\n\n      The Texas Legislature enacted the TCHRA to address the specific evils of\n\ndiscrimination and retaliation in the workplace. Chatha, 381 S.W.3d at 504. Under\n\nthe TCHRA, an employer commits an unlawful employment practice if it retaliates\n\nor discriminates against a person who, pursuant to the TCHRA, (1) opposes a\n\ndiscriminatory practice, (2) makes or files a charge, (3) files a complaint, or (4)\n\ntestifies, assists, or participates in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or\n\nhearing. Tex. Lab. Code Ann. § 21.055. To make a prima facie showing of\n\nretaliation, a plaintiff must show that (1) he engaged in a protected activity, (2) an\n\nadverse employment action occurred, and (3) there was a causal link between the\n\nprotected activity and the adverse action. Pineda v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 360\n\nF.3d 483, 487 (5th Cir. 2004); Dias v. Goodman Mfg. Co., L.P., 214 S.W.3d 672,\n\n676 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2007, pet. denied). When analyzing a claim\n\nbrought under the TCHRA, we look to state and federal law because the Texas\n\nLegislature patterned the TCHRA after federal law to “provide for the execution of\n\nthe policies of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and its subsequent\n\n\n\n\n                                         10\n \n\f \n \n\n\n\n\namendments[.]” Tex. Labor Code Ann. § 21.001(1) (West 2015); Nicholas, 461\n\nS.W.3d at 136-37.\n\n      To establish that he opposed a discriminatory practice, Jenkins must\n\ndemonstrate a good faith, reasonable belief that the University engaged in activity\n\nmade unlawful by the TCHRA. See Cox &. Smith Inc. v. Cook, 974 S.W.2d 217, 224\n\n(Tex. App.—San Antonio 1998, pet. denied). A reasonable belief has both subjective\n\nand objective components. Id. at 225. The plaintiff must demonstrate that he\n\nsubjectively, in good faith, believed that his employer engaged in unlawful\n\nemployment practices, and that his belief was objectively reasonable in light of the\n\nfacts presented. Id. at 225-26. An employer commits an unlawful employment\n\npractice under the TCHRA if, because of race, color, disability, sex, national origin,\n\nor age, the employer:\n\n      (1) fails or refuses to hire an individual, discharges an individual, or\n      discriminates in any other manner against an individual in connection\n      with compensation or the terms, conditions, or privileges of\n      employment; or\n\n      (2) limits, segregates, or classifies an employee or applicant for\n      employment in a manner that would deprive or tend to deprive an\n      individual of any employment opportunity or adversely affect in any\n      other manner the status of an employee.\n\nTex. Labor Code Ann. § 21.051 (West 2015).\n\n\n\n\n                                         11\n \n\f \n \n\n\n\n\n      Jenkins maintains that he engaged in a protected activity by opposing an\n\nunlawful employment practice, which was the University’s allegedly discriminatory\n\nadmissions practice of using the GRE to exclude racial minorities and women from\n\nbeing hired to teach in the University’s doctoral program. Jenkins’s affidavit, in\n\nwhich Jenkins averred that some of the graduate students had the opportunity to\n\nbecome paid graduate assistants with the University, does not create a fact question\n\nregarding the jurisdictional issue, because a speculative opportunity for employment\n\nof a prospective graduate student does not demonstrate that the University engaged\n\nin an unlawful employment practice. See Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 227-28; see also\n\nTex. Labor Code Ann. § 21.051. Based on the facts presented, we hold that Jenkins\n\nhas failed to show that the University’s use of the GRE as an admissions criterion\n\nfor students to be admitted into its doctoral program would have given Jenkins a\n\ngood faith reasonable belief that the University engaged in an unlawful employment\n\npractice under the TCHRA. See Cook, 974 S.W.2d at 225-26. We also hold that\n\nJenkins has failed to show that the facts would have given him a good faith\n\nreasonable belief that the University’s doctoral program is an on-the-job training, or\n\nother training or retraining program under the THCRA, or that the University, while\n\nacting as an employer, committed an unlawful employment practice by\n\n\n\n\n                                         12\n \n\f \n \n\n\n\n\ndiscriminating against an individual because of race or sex in determining admission\n\nto such a training program. See id.; see also Tex. Labor Code Ann. § 21.054.\n\n      We conclude that Jenkins failed to plead a prima facie case of employment\n\nretaliation under the TCHRA, and that the TCHRA does not waive the University’s\n\nimmunity from suit. Because the trial court has already afforded Jenkins an\n\nopportunity to amend his pleadings to allege sufficient facts to establish a waiver of\n\nimmunity, Jenkins need not be afforded another opportunity to amend his pleadings.\n\nSee Tex. A&M Univ. Sys. v. Koseoglu, 233 S.W.3d 835, 839-40 (Tex. 2007);\n\nMiranda, 133 S.W.3d at 227. We sustain issue one.\n\n      In issue two, the University argues that Jenkins’s UDJA claims are barred by\n\nsovereign immunity. In his amended petition, Jenkins sought a declaratory judgment\n\nthat the University had violated Jenkins’s rights secured by the TCHRA and the\n\nTexas Constitution.\n\n      The UDJA permits “[a] person . . . whose rights, status, or other legal relations\n\nare affected by a statute, municipal ordinance, contract, or franchise [to] have\n\ndetermined any question of construction or validity arising under the instrument,\n\nstatute, ordinance, contract, or franchise and obtain a declaration of rights, status, or\n\nother legal relations thereunder.” Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. § 37.004(a)\n\n(West 2015). The UDJA does not enlarge a trial court’s jurisdiction; rather, it merely\n\n                                           13\n \n\f \n \n\n\n\n\nprovides a remedy when the trial court already has jurisdiction. City of El Paso v.\n\nHeinrich, 284 S.W.3d 366, 370 (Tex. 2009). Absent a legislative waiver, sovereign\n\nimmunity bars UDJA actions against the State and its governmental units. Tex. Dept.\n\nof Transp. v. Sefzik, 355 S.W.3d 618, 620 (Tex. 2011). While a governmental unit\n\nmay be a proper party to a UDJA action that challenges the validity of a statute,\n\nJenkins does not challenge the validity of the TCHRA; rather, Jenkins challenges\n\nthe University’s actions under the TCHRA. See id. at 622. Having already concluded\n\nthat the TCHRA does not waive the University’s immunity from suit because\n\nJenkins failed to plead a prima facie case of employment retaliation, Jenkins is not\n\nentitled to a judgment declaring that the University has violated Jenkins’s rights\n\nsecured by the TCHRA. See id.\n\n      Jenkins also sought a declaratory judgment declaring that the University\n\nviolated his rights to due course of law and free speech secured by the Texas\n\nConstitution. See Tex. Const. art. I, §§ 19. While sovereign immunity does not bar a\n\nsuit to vindicate constitutional rights, immunity from suit is not waived if the\n\nconstitutional claims are facially invalid. Klumb v. Houston Mun. Emps. Pension\n\nSys., 458 S.W.3d 1, 13 (Tex. 2015). Before any substantial or procedural due-process\n\nrights attach, a plaintiff must show that he has a protected property interest that is\n\nentitled to constitutional protection. Id. at 15. We hold that Jenkins’s due-course-of-\n\n                                          14\n \n\f \n \n\n\n\n\nlaw claim is facially invalid because he has failed to show that he has a protected\n\nproperty interest in continued employment with the University or in obtaining\n\ntenure. See Bd. of Regents of State Colls. v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 573 (1972); Staheli\n\nv. Univ. of Miss., 854 F.2d 121, 125 (5th Cir. 1988); Tarleton State Univ. v. Rosiere,\n\n867 S.W.2d 948, 951 (Tex. App.—Eastland 1993, writ dism’d by agr.).\n\n      We also hold that Jenkins failed to plead a facially valid free-speech claim.\n\nTo prevail on a constitutional free-speech claim, Jenkins was required to establish\n\nthat: (1) he suffered an adverse employment decision; (2) his speech involved a\n\nmatter of public concern; (3) his interest in commenting on matters of public concern\n\noutweighed the University’s interest in promoting efficiency; and (4) his speech\n\nmotivated the adverse employment decision. See Caleb v. Carranza, 518 S.W.3d\n\n537, 544 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2017, no pet.). As a public employee,\n\nJenkins was required to show that he spoke as a citizen, rather than as an employee\n\nof the University pursuant to his official duties. See id. The critical question is\n\nwhether the speech at issue is itself ordinarily within the scope of the employee’s\n\nduties. Id. Our review of the record shows that Jenkins’s pleadings establish that the\n\n“speech” at issue was made pursuant to his official duties as Chairman of the\n\nDepartment of Educational Leadership, and thus his speech falls outside the ambit\n\nof free-speech protection. See id. at 545. We conclude that the University’s\n\n                                         15\n \n\f \n \n\n\n\n\nimmunity from suit is not waived because Jenkins’s constitutional claims are facially\n\ninvalid. See Klumb, 458 S.W.3d at 13. We sustain issue two.\n\n      Having sustained the University’s issues on appeal and concluded that the\n\nUniversity’s immunity from suit is not waived as to any of Jenkins’s claims, we\n\nreverse the trial court’s order denying the University’s amended plea to the\n\njurisdiction and render judgment granting the plea and dismissing Jenkins’s claims\n\nagainst the University with prejudice.\n\n      REVERSED AND RENDERED.\n\n\n\n                                              ______________________________\n                                                     STEVE McKEITHEN\n                                                         Chief Justice\n\nSubmitted on November 22, 2017\nOpinion Delivered January 11, 2018\n\nBefore McKeithen, C.J., Kreger and Johnson, JJ.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n                                         16\n \n\f",

See\n\nTex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. § 51.014(a)(8) (West Supp. 2017). We reverse\n\nthe trial court’s order and render judgment granting the University’s plea and\n\ndismissing the appellee’s claims against the University with prejudice.\n\n\n\n\n                                         1\n \n\f \n \n\n\n\n\n                                  BACKGROUND\n\n      In August 2014, the appellee, Dr. Steve Jenkins, sued the University for\n\nalleged retaliation in violation of section 21.055 of the Texas Commission on Human\n\nRights Act (TCHRA). See Tex. Labor Code Ann. § 21.055 (West 2015). In his\n\npetition, Jenkins alleged that the University had retaliated against him by denying\n\nhis application for promotion to the academic rank of Full Professor, with\n\naccompanying tenure status, because Jenkins had opposed the University’s use of\n\nthe Graduate Records Exam (GRE) as a criteria for admission into the University’s\n\nCollege of Education’s graduate program. According to Jenkins, he opposed the\n\nUniversity’s use of the GRE because it is an inherently racist test that the University\n\nused as a threshold discriminatory entry requirement to exclude or limit downstream\n\nemployment of minority professional educator administrators in Texas public\n\nschools. Jenkins maintained that the College Dean and the chairman of the\n\nDepartment of Educational Leadership opposed his application for promotion and\n\ntenure because Jenkins had opposed the use of the GRE for ethical reasons, and the\n\nUniversity’s President and Provost arbitrarily ratified the decision of the Dean, rather\n\nthan the larger body of the University’s tenured faculty who supported his\n\napplication.\n\n\n\n\n                                           2\n \n\f \n \n\n\n\n\n      The University filed a plea to the jurisdiction asserting that Jenkins’s\n\nretaliation claim under section 21.055 of the TCHRA is based on an admission\n\npractice to a graduate program and not on an unlawful discriminatory employment\n\npractice. According to the University, because Jenkins failed to allege a prima facie\n\nviolation under the TCHRA, there is no waiver of sovereign immunity, and the trial\n\ncourt should dismiss the suit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Jenkins filed a\n\nresponse to the University’s plea to the jurisdiction, arguing that the University’s\n\ndiscriminatory admissions practice was an unlawful employment practice because\n\nthe use of the GRE excluded racial minorities and women from being hired in the\n\ndoctoral program and from gaining teaching experience at the University. The trial\n\ncourt conducted a hearing on the University’s plea to the jurisdiction, during which\n\nJenkins’s counsel requested the opportunity to amend the pleadings to supplement\n\nthe factual allegations supporting Jenkins’s retaliation claim. The record shows that\n\nthe trial court granted the University’s plea to the jurisdiction and also granted\n\nJenkins leave to amend his petition.\n\n      Jenkins filed an amended petition alleging that the University had retaliated\n\nagainst him for opposing the College of Education’s discriminatory admission\n\npractice of using the GRE to deprive qualified female and minority instructors the\n\nopportunity to teach at the University. Jenkins also sought a declaratory judgment\n\n                                          3\n \n\f \n \n\n\n\n\nunder the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act (UDJA) declaring that the University\n\nhad violated Jenkins’s rights secured by the TCHRA, as well as his rights to free\n\nspeech and due course of law secured by the Texas Constitution. See Tex. Const. art.\n\nI, §§ 19; Tex. Labor Code Ann. § 21.055; Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. §§\n\n37.001-37.011 (West 2015).\n\n      The University argued that Jenkins’s amended petition failed to allege that\n\nJenkins had engaged in a protected activity because Jenkins’s retaliation claim was\n\nnot based on an unlawful employment practice under the TCHRA. The University\n\nfurther contended that Jenkins failed to plead a viable UDJA claim because Jenkins\n\nhad not challenged the constitutionality of a statute or ordinance, alleged that state\n\nofficials in their official capacities had violated his constitutional rights, or sought\n\nto compel the University to follow the law in the future. Concerning Jenkins’s\n\nconstitutional claims, the University asserted that Jenkins had failed to plead a viable\n\ndue-course-of-law claim because Jenkins did not have a protected liberty or property\n\ninterest in his continued employment or in obtaining tenure, and that there is no\n\nprivate cause of action for a free speech claim.\n\n      Jenkins filed a response to the University’s amended plea to the jurisdiction,\n\narguing that the University had failed to appeal the trial court’s October 2016 order,\n\nin which Jenkins claims that the trial court denied the University’s plea to the\n\n                                           4\n \n\f \n \n\n\n\n\njurisdiction, and that the University could not revive the right to an interlocutory\n\nappeal by filing a duplicate plea to Jenkins’s amended petition. Jenkins also argued\n\nthat the University’s plea to the jurisdiction is actually a time-barred Rule 91a\n\nmotion to dismiss, and that the University is attempting to characterize its pleading\n\nsufficiency challenge as a jurisdictional argument. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 91a.\n\nAccording to Jenkins, the TCHRA forbids retaliation against a person who opposes\n\na “discriminatory practice,” and discrimination in employment and discrimination\n\nto or in a training program are both discriminatory practices under the TCHRA.\n\nJenkins argued that his retaliation claim opposed a discriminatory employment\n\npractice because the doctoral program included the opportunity to teach at the\n\nUniversity. Jenkins further argued that he had opposed the University’s\n\ndiscrimination in admission to or participation in a training program on the basis of\n\nrace, national origin, and gender, which is also a protected activity under the\n\nTCHRA. See Tex. Labor Code Ann. § 21.054(a) (West 2015); Id. § 21.055. Jenkins\n\nalso maintained that the trial court had jurisdiction over his UDJA claims.\n\n      The University disputed Jenkins’s contention that the University’s doctoral\n\nprogram is a “training program” under the TCHRA. The University argued that the\n\ndoctoral program is a degree-earning educational program and not a job-related\n\ntraining program, and that the graduate students in the program are not provided an\n\n                                         5\n \n\f \n \n\n\n\n\nopportunity to teach at the University. According to the University, section 21.054\n\nof the TCHRA prohibits an employer or a labor organization from discriminating in\n\nthe admission to an apprenticeship, on-the-job training, or other training or retraining\n\nprogram, and that such training programs vastly differ in purpose and effect from\n\nthe University’s doctoral program. See id. § 21.054(a). The University argued that\n\nthe purpose of putting “training program” in the TCHRA was to prohibit\n\ndiscrimination in the skilled, labor-union trades, and unlike an individual in a skilled\n\ncraft apprenticeship or training program, a graduate of the doctoral program is not\n\nautomatically entitled to employment in his field. The University further argued that\n\nJenkins’s attempt to couch his retaliation claim as an employment practice is too\n\nattenuated, because admission into the doctoral program does not guarantee\n\nemployment as an instructor.\n\n      The trial court conducted a hearing on the University’s amended plea to the\n\njurisdiction, and after hearing the parties’ arguments, denied the University’s\n\namended plea without issuing findings of fact and conclusions of law. The\n\nUniversity filed this interlocutory appeal. We note that Jenkins contends that this\n\nCourt lacks jurisdiction over the University’s interlocutory appeal because the\n\nUniversity did not appeal from the trial court’s order granting Jenkins’s request to\n\nreplead and because the University’s amended plea to the jurisdiction did not assert\n\n                                           6\n \n\f \n \n\n\n\n\nany new grounds. We disagree with Jenkins’s contention, as the record fails to show\n\nthat the trial court denied the University’s original plea to the jurisdiction or that the\n\nUniversity’s amended plea to the jurisdiction was merely a motion to reconsider the\n\ndenial of its original plea. Cf. City of Houston v. Estate of Jones, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">388</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">663</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n667 (Tex. 2012). Our review of the record shows that the trial court granted the\n\nUniversity’s original plea to the jurisdiction, and the University’s amended plea\n\naddressed Jenkins’s UDJA claim, which Jenkins added in his first amended petition.\n\nWe also disagree with Jenkins’s contention that the University’s plea to the\n\njurisdiction improperly challenges Jenkins’s pleadings and is merely a time-barred\n\nRule 91a motion to dismiss.

Absent a pleading that sets forth a prima facie case, the\n\ngovernmental unit’s immunity from suit has not been waived. Id. at 637.\n\n       A governmental unit may challenge the existence of a prima facie case\n\nthrough a plea to the jurisdiction. Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 226. We review de novo\n\na trial court’s disposition of a plea to the jurisdiction. Id. at 226, 228. First, we focus\n\non the plaintiff’s petition to determine whether the facts that were pleaded\n\naffirmatively demonstrate that subject matter jurisdiction exists. Id. at 226. We\n\nconstrue the pleadings liberally in favor of the plaintiff. Id. If the plaintiff has not\n\naffirmatively pleaded facts to support the trial court’s jurisdiction, the issue is one\n\nof pleading sufficiency, and the trial court should provide the plaintiff the\n\nopportunity to amend the pleading to cure any jurisdictional defects. Id. at 226-27.\n\nHowever, if the pleadings affirmatively negate the existence of jurisdiction, the trial\n\ncourt may grant the plea to the jurisdiction without allowing the plaintiff the\n\nopportunity to amend. Id. at 227.\n\n      If a plea to the jurisdiction challenges the existence of jurisdictional facts, the\n\ntrial court may consider relevant evidence and is required to do so when necessary\n\nto resolve the jurisdictional issues raised. Id. When evidence is submitted that\n\nimplicates the merits of the case, the trial court reviews the relevant evidence to\n\ndetermine whether a fact issue exists, and if the evidence creates a fact question\n\n                                            8\n \n\f \n \n\n\n\n\nregarding jurisdiction, the trial court cannot grant the plea to the jurisdiction. Id. at\n\n227-28. If the relevant evidence fails to raise a fact question, then the trial court can\n\nrule on the plea as a matter of law. Id. at 228. This standard of review generally\n\nmirrors the summary judgment standard under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure\n\n166a(c), as it places the burden on the governmental unit to present evidence to\n\ndemonstrate that the trial court lacks subject matter jurisdiction. Id.; see also Tex. R.\n\nCiv. P. 166a(c).\n\n      If the governmental unit meets its initial burden, the burden then shifts to the\n\nplaintiff to show that a disputed material fact exists regarding the jurisdictional issue.\n\nMiranda, 133 S.W.3d at 228. We take as true all evidence that is favorable to the\n\nplaintiff and indulge every reasonable inference and resolve any doubts in the\n\nplaintiff’s favor. Id. If the evidence creates a fact question regarding the\n\njurisdictional issue, the trial court cannot grant the plea because fact questions must\n\nbe resolved by the finder of fact. Id. at 228.\n\n                                      ANALYSIS\n\n      In issue one, the University argues that Jenkins failed to establish a waiver of\n\nsovereign immunity because Jenkins failed to plead a prima facie case of retaliation\n\nunder the TCHRA. According to the University, its use of the GRE as an admissions\n\nrequirement to the doctoral program is not an “unlawful employment practice” under\n\n                                            9\n \n\f \n \n\n\n\n\nthe TCHRA. See Tex. Labor Code Ann. §§ 21.051, 21.055 (West 2015). The\n\nUniversity further argues that its doctoral program is not a job-related training\n\nprogram under the TCHRA. See id. § 21.054.\n\n      The Texas Legislature enacted the TCHRA to address the specific evils of\n\ndiscrimination and retaliation in the workplace. Chatha, 381 S.W.3d at 504. Under\n\nthe TCHRA, an employer commits an unlawful employment practice if it retaliates\n\nor discriminates against a person who, pursuant to the TCHRA, (1) opposes a\n\ndiscriminatory practice, (2) makes or files a charge, (3) files a complaint, or (4)\n\ntestifies, assists, or participates in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or\n\nhearing. Tex. Lab. Code Ann. § 21.055. To make a prima facie showing of\n\nretaliation, a plaintiff must show that (1) he engaged in a protected activity, (2) an\n\nadverse employment action occurred, and (3) there was a causal link between the\n\nprotected activity and the adverse action.

App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2007, pet. denied). When analyzing a claim\n\nbrought under the TCHRA, we look to state and federal law because the Texas\n\nLegislature patterned the TCHRA after federal law to “provide for the execution of\n\nthe policies of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and its subsequent\n\n\n\n\n                                         10\n \n\f \n \n\n\n\n\namendments[.]” Tex. Labor Code Ann. § 21.001(1) (West 2015); Nicholas, 461\n\nS.W.3d at 136-37.\n\n      To establish that he opposed a discriminatory practice, Jenkins must\n\ndemonstrate a good faith, reasonable belief that the University engaged in activity\n\nmade unlawful by the TCHRA. See Cox &. Smith Inc. v. Cook, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2418667\"><a href=\"/opinion/2418667/cox-smith-inc-v-cook/\"><span class=\"volume\">974</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">217</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 224\n\n(Tex.

The plaintiff must demonstrate that he\n\nsubjectively, in good faith, believed that his employer engaged in unlawful\n\nemployment practices, and that his belief was objectively reasonable in light of the\n\nfacts presented. Id. at 225-26. An employer commits an unlawful employment\n\npractice under the TCHRA if, because of race, color, disability, sex, national origin,\n\nor age, the employer:\n\n      (1) fails or refuses to hire an individual, discharges an individual, or\n      discriminates in any other manner against an individual in connection\n      with compensation or the terms, conditions, or privileges of\n      employment; or\n\n      (2) limits, segregates, or classifies an employee or applicant for\n      employment in a manner that would deprive or tend to deprive an\n      individual of any employment opportunity or adversely affect in any\n      other manner the status of an employee.\n\nTex. Labor Code Ann. § 21.051 (West 2015).\n\n\n\n\n                                         11\n \n\f \n \n\n\n\n\n      Jenkins maintains that he engaged in a protected activity by opposing an\n\nunlawful employment practice, which was the University’s allegedly discriminatory\n\nadmissions practice of using the GRE to exclude racial minorities and women from\n\nbeing hired to teach in the University’s doctoral program. Jenkins’s affidavit, in\n\nwhich Jenkins averred that some of the graduate students had the opportunity to\n\nbecome paid graduate assistants with the University, does not create a fact question\n\nregarding the jurisdictional issue, because a speculative opportunity for employment\n\nof a prospective graduate student does not demonstrate that the University engaged\n\nin an unlawful employment practice. See Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 227-28; see also\n\nTex. Labor Code Ann. § 21.051. Based on the facts presented, we hold that Jenkins\n\nhas failed to show that the University’s use of the GRE as an admissions criterion\n\nfor students to be admitted into its doctoral program would have given Jenkins a\n\ngood faith reasonable belief that the University engaged in an unlawful employment\n\npractice under the TCHRA. See Cook, 974 S.W.2d at 225-26. We also hold that\n\nJenkins has failed to show that the facts would have given him a good faith\n\nreasonable belief that the University’s doctoral program is an on-the-job training, or\n\nother training or retraining program under the THCRA, or that the University, while\n\nacting as an employer, committed an unlawful employment practice by\n\n\n\n\n                                         12\n \n\f \n \n\n\n\n\ndiscriminating against an individual because of race or sex in determining admission\n\nto such a training program. See id.; see also Tex. Labor Code Ann. § 21.054.\n\n      We conclude that Jenkins failed to plead a prima facie case of employment\n\nretaliation under the TCHRA, and that the TCHRA does not waive the University’s\n\nimmunity from suit. Because the trial court has already afforded Jenkins an\n\nopportunity to amend his pleadings to allege sufficient facts to establish a waiver of\n\nimmunity, Jenkins need not be afforded another opportunity to amend his pleadings.\n\nSee Tex.

In his amended petition, Jenkins sought a declaratory judgment\n\nthat the University had violated Jenkins’s rights secured by the TCHRA and the\n\nTexas Constitution.\n\n      The UDJA permits “[a] person . . . whose rights, status, or other legal relations\n\nare affected by a statute, municipal ordinance, contract, or franchise [to] have\n\ndetermined any question of construction or validity arising under the instrument,\n\nstatute, ordinance, contract, or franchise and obtain a declaration of rights, status, or\n\nother legal relations thereunder.” Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. § 37.004(a)\n\n(West 2015). The UDJA does not enlarge a trial court’s jurisdiction; rather, it merely\n\n                                           13\n \n\f \n \n\n\n\n\nprovides a remedy when the trial court already has jurisdiction.

Absent a legislative waiver, sovereign\n\nimmunity bars UDJA actions against the State and its governmental units. Tex. Dept.\n\nof Transp. v. Sefzik, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">355</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">618</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 620 (Tex. 2011). While a governmental unit\n\nmay be a proper party to a UDJA action that challenges the validity of a statute,\n\nJenkins does not challenge the validity of the TCHRA; rather, Jenkins challenges\n\nthe University’s actions under the TCHRA. See id. at 622. Having already concluded\n\nthat the TCHRA does not waive the University’s immunity from suit because\n\nJenkins failed to plead a prima facie case of employment retaliation, Jenkins is not\n\nentitled to a judgment declaring that the University has violated Jenkins’s rights\n\nsecured by the TCHRA. See id.\n\n      Jenkins also sought a declaratory judgment declaring that the University\n\nviolated his rights to due course of law and free speech secured by the Texas\n\nConstitution. See Tex. Const. art. I, §§ 19. While sovereign immunity does not bar a\n\nsuit to vindicate constitutional rights, immunity from suit is not waived if the\n\nconstitutional claims are facially invalid.

Before any substantial or procedural due-process\n\nrights attach, a plaintiff must show that he has a protected property interest that is\n\nentitled to constitutional protection. Id. at 15. We hold that Jenkins’s due-course-of-\n\n                                          14\n \n\f \n \n\n\n\n\nlaw claim is facially invalid because he has failed to show that he has a protected\n\nproperty interest in continued employment with the University or in obtaining\n\ntenure.

App.—Eastland 1993, writ dism’d by agr.).\n\n      We also hold that Jenkins failed to plead a facially valid free-speech claim.\n\nTo prevail on a constitutional free-speech claim, Jenkins was required to establish\n\nthat: (1) he suffered an adverse employment decision; (2) his speech involved a\n\nmatter of public concern; (3) his interest in commenting on matters of public concern\n\noutweighed the University’s interest in promoting efficiency; and (4) his speech\n\nmotivated the adverse employment decision. See Caleb v. Carranza, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">537</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 544 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2017, no pet.). As a public employee,\n\nJenkins was required to show that he spoke as a citizen, rather than as an employee\n\nof the University pursuant to his official duties. See id. The critical question is\n\nwhether the speech at issue is itself ordinarily within the scope of the employee’s\n\nduties. Id. Our review of the record shows that Jenkins’s pleadings establish that the\n\n“speech” at issue was made pursuant to his official duties as Chairman of the\n\nDepartment of Educational Leadership, and thus his speech falls outside the ambit\n\nof free-speech protection. See id. at 545. We conclude that the University’s\n\n                                         15\n \n\f \n \n\n\n\n\nimmunity from suit is not waived because Jenkins’s constitutional claims are facially\n\ninvalid. See Klumb, 458 S.W.3d at 13. We sustain issue two.\n\n      Having sustained the University’s issues on appeal and concluded that the\n\nUniversity’s immunity from suit is not waived as to any of Jenkins’s claims, we\n\nreverse the trial court’s order denying the University’s amended plea to the\n\njurisdiction and render judgment granting the plea and dismissing Jenkins’s claims\n\nagainst the University with prejudice.\n\n      REVERSED AND RENDERED.\n\n\n\n                                              ______________________________\n                                                     STEVE McKEITHEN\n                                                         Chief Justice\n\nSubmitted on November 22, 2017\nOpinion Delivered January 11, 2018\n\nBefore McKeithen, C.J., Kreger and Johnson, JJ.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n                                         16\n \n\f</pre>",
