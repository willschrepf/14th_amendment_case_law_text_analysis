After\n\nreviewing the record, we conclude the district court properly dismissed the\n\ncomplaint for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted.\n\n\n\n\n      *\n         This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the\ndoctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. It may be cited,\nhowever, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th\nCir. R. 32.1.\n      **\n         After examining the briefs and the appellate record, this three-judge\npanel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not be of material\nassistance in the determination of this appeal. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a); 10th\nCir. R. 34.1(G). The cause is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.\n\f      Having jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291, we AFFIRM the district\n\ncourt’s decision.\n\n                                  I. Background\n\n      Grissom is currently incarcerated at the Larned Correctional Mental Health\n\nFacility (LCMHF) in Larned, Kansas. In his complaint, he alleged he received\n\npoor medical care from the Kansas Department of Corrections (KDOC), which\n\nrises to the level of cruel and unusual punishment, in violation of the Eighth\n\nAmendment. Grissom also asserted he was transferred in retaliation for filing\n\nmultiple administrative complaints and he was denied access to the prison law\n\nlibrary, both in violation of the First Amendment. Grissom named only Karen\n\nRohling, warden of LCMHF, as defendant.\n\n      The district court issued an order instructing Grissom to show cause why\n\nhis complaint should not be dismissed or, in the alternative, to submit an amended\n\ncomplaint. The court explained the initial complaint was inadequate for failure to\n\nallege facts establishing personal participation by the named defendant, Warden\n\nRohling, in the unconstitutional acts on which the complaint was based. It noted\n\nWarden Rohling “is not liable for the acts of all employees . . . based only upon\n\nher supervisory capacity at the facility.” R., Vol. I at 416 n.2.\n\n      The court observed that Grissom appeared to contemplate additional\n\ndefendants not listed in the caption, as he named other members of KDOC\n\nmedical staff in the body of his complaint. But the court declined to construe the\n\n                                         -2-\n\fcomplaint as naming these individuals as defendants, on the ground that the\n\nclaims against them were subject to dismissal for other deficiencies.\n\n      Grissom subsequently filed an interlocutory appeal, which was dismissed\n\nfor failure to prosecute. He then filed a response to the district court’s order to\n\nshow cause. But this response did not address the deficiencies the court\n\nidentified in the complaint; it merely supplied information supporting Grissom’s\n\nrequest for in forma pauperis status. The court therefore dismissed Grissom’s\n\ncomplaint for the reasons stated in the initial order, pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1915A(b).\n\n      In response, Grisson filed a notice of appeal. He sought the court’s leave\n\nto proceed in forma pauperis on appeal and appointment of counsel. Finding\n\nGrissom had presented no non-frivolous factual or legal ground for appeal, the\n\ncourt denied both requests.\n\n      Grissom here appeals the district court’s dismissal of his complaint and\n\nrenews his motion to continue in forma pauperis and for appointment of counsel.\n\nHe raises the following arguments on appeal: (1) defendant subjected him to\n\ncruel and unusual punishment by knowingly giving him a drug to which he was\n\nallergic, (2) denying him a flu shot that was given to other prisoners, (3) and\n\ngiving him medication that had not been prescribed to him, and (4) defendant\n\ntransferred him to another KDOC facility in retaliation for his administrative\n\ngrievances.\n\n                                          -3-\n\f      After lodging this appeal, Grissom filed a second notice of appeal with the\n\ndistrict court. Noting the appeal was already pending before the Tenth Circuit,\n\nthe district court nonetheless denied Grissom’s second request to proceed in\n\nforma pauperis and for appointment of counsel.\n\n      Grissom then appealed the denial of this order. This second appeal is\n\nduplicative of the first, again asking that we grant leave to proceed in forma\n\npauperis and appoint counsel.\n\n                                   II. Discussion\n\n      Section 1915A(b)(1), in pertinent part, permits the district court to dismiss\n\nan inmate’s complaint if it “fails to state a claim upon which relief may be\n\ngranted.” We review the district court’s dismissal for failure to state a claim\n\nunder § 1915A(b) de novo. Young v. Davis, 554 F.3d 1254, 1256 (10th Cir.\n\n2009). In conducting this review, “[w]e must accept all the well-pleaded\n\nallegations of the complaint as true and must construe them in the light most\n\nfavorable to the plaintiff.” Id. (quotation omitted). “We review the complaint for\n\nplausibility; that is, to determine whether the complaint includes enough facts to\n\nstate a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.” Id. (quotation omitted).\n\nBecause Grissom is a pro se litigant, we construe his pleadings and other papers\n\ngenerously. Van Deelen v. Johnson, 497 F.3d 1151, 1153 n.1 (10th Cir. 2007).\n\n      After careful review of the record, we conclude the district court did not\n\nabuse its discretion in dismissing Grissom’s complaint. As an initial matter, the\n\n                                          -4-\n\fdistrict court is correct that the complaint does not allege facts suggesting the\n\nnamed defendant, Warden Rohling, was personally involved in the violation of\n\nGrissom’s constitutional rights. And, although Grissom was advised of this\n\ndeficiency and given the opportunity to amend the complaint by making the\n\nnecessary allegations or adding additional defendants, he failed to do so.\n\n      We next consider the district court’s finding that, even if it did construe the\n\ncomplaint as including additional defendants, the complaint would be subject to\n\ndismissal for failure to state a claim.\n\n      A) Eighth Amendment Claim: Error in Drug Prescription\n\n      In Grissom’s first claim for cruel and unusual punishment, he alleges in\n\nApril of 2006, Dr. Danny Stanton gave him the drug “Bactrim.” Grissom claims\n\nthat he explained to Stanton he was allergic to the drug and that his medical\n\nrecords noted this fact. He asserts he was intimidated into taking the Bactrim.\n\nSoon after, Grissom had a strong allergic reaction that included “swelling of his\n\nglands to his throat, hands, legs, and scrotum.” R., Vol. I at 8. He was then\n\ngiven a different drug to which he was not allergic, and his allergy to “sulfa\n\ndrugs” was noted in his medical records.\n\n      But, as the district court observed, this claim is barred by the two-year\n\nstatute of limitations applicable to civil rights complaints. See Brown v. Unified\n\nSch. Dist. 501, 465 F.3d 1184, 1188 (10th Cir. 2006). Because Grissom did not\n\n\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\ffile his complaint until June of 2010, more than four years after the events\n\nallegedly took place, this claim is subject to dismissal for failure to state a claim.\n\n      B) Eighth Amendment Claim: Denial of H1N1 Flu Shot\n\n      Next, Grissom asserts he was denied an H1N1 flu shot while other\n\nprisoners in administrative segregation received the inoculation. He argues this\n\nomission amounts to cruel and unusual punishment.\n\n      “A prison official violates an inmate’s clearly established Eighth\n\nAmendment rights if he acts with deliberate indifference to an inmate’s serious\n\nmedical needs—if he knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health\n\nor safety.” Garrett v. Stratman, 254 F.3d 946, 949 (10th Cir. 2001) (internal\n\nquotations omitted). To prevail on a claim for denial of medical care, a plaintiff\n\nmust show that he suffered harm sufficiently serious to implicate the Cruel and\n\nUnusual Punishment Clause. Callahan v. Poppell, 471 F.3d 1155, 1159 (10th Cir.\n\n2006). But here, Grissom fails to allege that he suffered any harm from the\n\nomission.\n\n      We therefore affirm the district court’s dismissal of this claim.\n\n      C) Eighth Amendment Claim: Error in Drug Distribution\n\n      In his third claim on appeal, Grissom alleges a nurse mistakenly gave him a\n\ndrug that was actually prescribed for another inmate. While it is not clear from\n\nthe complaint, it appears that he is referring to a “Mrs. Young,” who, he asserts,\n\n\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\f“does not pay any attention [to] what medication she is giving out.” R., Vol. I at\n\n12.\n\n      Again, however, Grissom fails to allege he suffered any harm from the\n\ninadequate medical care. In fact, it seems likely, given his narrative of the event,\n\nthat Grissom discovered the error before taking the drug, and never suffered any\n\nharm at all.\n\n      This claim is also deficient because Grissom does not allege facts\n\nsuggesting Young acted with a culpable mental state. A prison official’s\n\n“negligent diagnosis or treatment of a medical condition does not constitute a\n\nmedical wrong under the Eighth Amendment, as medical malpractice does not\n\nbecome a constitutional violation merely because the victim is a prisoner.”\n\nDuffield v. Jackson, 545 F.3d 1234, 1238 (10th Cir. 2008) (internal quotations\n\nand alterations omitted). In order to make a claim, a prisoner must show\n\ndeliberate indifference, that is, that the official “knew he faced a substantial risk\n\nof harm and disregarded that risk, by failing to take reasonable measures to abate\n\nit.” Callahan, 471 F.3d at 1159. Although the district court noted this\n\nrequirement, Grissom failed to remedy the deficiency in an amended complaint.\n\nThe district court therefore properly dismissed this claim.\n\n      D) First Amendment Claim: Retaliation\n\n      Finally, Grissom contends he was transferred to the El Dorado Correctional\n\nFacility in retaliation for filing multiple administrative complaints regarding the\n\n                                          -7-\n\fBactrim incident. As the district court pointed out, this transfer occurred in May\n\nof 2006, more than four years before Grissom filed his complaint. Thus, this\n\nclaim is also subject to dismissal as barred by the two-year statute of limitations.\n\nSee Brown, 465 F.3d at 1188.\n\n                                  III. Conclusion\n\n      For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.\n\nWe also DENY Grissom’s request for leave to proceed in forma pauperis on\n\nappeal and for appointment of counsel. Appellant is directed to make immediate\n\npayment of the appellate filing fees to the district court.\n\n\n\n                                                ENTERED FOR THE COURT\n\n                                                Timothy M.

And, although Grissom was advised of this\n\ndeficiency and given the opportunity to amend the complaint by making the\n\nnecessary allegations or adding additional defendants, he failed to do so.\n\n      We next consider the district court’s finding that, even if it did construe the\n\ncomplaint as including additional defendants, the complaint would be subject to\n\ndismissal for failure to state a claim.\n\n      A) Eighth Amendment Claim: Error in Drug Prescription\n\n      In Grissom’s first claim for cruel and unusual punishment, he alleges in\n\nApril of 2006, Dr. Danny Stanton gave him the drug “Bactrim.” Grissom claims\n\nthat he explained to Stanton he was allergic to the drug and that his medical\n\nrecords noted this fact. He asserts he was intimidated into taking the Bactrim.\n\nSoon after, Grissom had a strong allergic reaction that included “swelling of his\n\nglands to his throat, hands, legs, and scrotum.” R., Vol. I at 8. He was then\n\ngiven a different drug to which he was not allergic, and his allergy to “sulfa\n\ndrugs” was noted in his medical records.\n\n      But, as the district court observed, this claim is barred by the two-year\n\nstatute of limitations applicable to civil rights complaints. See Brown v. Unified\n\nSch. Dist. 501, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1184</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1188 (10th Cir. 2006). Because Grissom did not\n\n\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\ffile his complaint until June of 2010, more than four years after the events\n\nallegedly took place, this claim is subject to dismissal for failure to state a claim.\n\n      B) Eighth Amendment Claim: Denial of H1N1 Flu Shot\n\n      Next, Grissom asserts he was denied an H1N1 flu shot while other\n\nprisoners in administrative segregation received the inoculation. He argues this\n\nomission amounts to cruel and unusual punishment.\n\n      “A prison official violates an inmate’s clearly established Eighth\n\nAmendment rights if he acts with deliberate indifference to an inmate’s serious\n\nmedical needs—if he knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health\n\nor safety.” Garrett v. Stratman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"161239\"><a href=\"/opinion/161239/garrett-v-stratman/\"><span class=\"volume\">254</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">946</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 949 (10th Cir. 2001) (internal\n\nquotations omitted). To prevail on a claim for denial of medical care, a plaintiff\n\nmust show that he suffered harm sufficiently serious to implicate the Cruel and\n\nUnusual Punishment Clause. Callahan v. Poppell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"168538\"><a href=\"/opinion/168538/callahan-v-poppell/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1155</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1159 (10th Cir.\n\n2006). But here, Grissom fails to allege that he suffered any harm from the\n\nomission.\n\n      We therefore affirm the district court’s dismissal of this claim.\n\n      C) Eighth Amendment Claim: Error in Drug Distribution\n\n      In his third claim on appeal, Grissom alleges a nurse mistakenly gave him a\n\ndrug that was actually prescribed for another inmate. While it is not clear from\n\nthe complaint, it appears that he is referring to a “Mrs. Young,” who, he asserts,\n\n\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\f“does not pay any attention [to] what medication she is giving out.” R., Vol. I at\n\n12.\n\n      Again, however, Grissom fails to allege he suffered any harm from the\n\ninadequate medical care. In fact, it seems likely, given his narrative of the event,\n\nthat Grissom discovered the error before taking the drug, and never suffered any\n\nharm at all.\n\n      This claim is also deficient because Grissom does not allege facts\n\nsuggesting Young acted with a culpable mental state. A prison official’s\n\n“negligent diagnosis or treatment of a medical condition does not constitute a\n\nmedical wrong under the Eighth Amendment, as medical malpractice does not\n\nbecome a constitutional violation merely because the victim is a prisoner.”\n\nDuffield v. Jackson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"171392\"><a href=\"/opinion/171392/duffield-v-jackson/\"><span class=\"volume\">545</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1234</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1238 (10th Cir. 2008) (internal quotations\n\nand alterations omitted). In order to make a claim, a prisoner must show\n\ndeliberate indifference, that is, that the official “knew he faced a substantial risk\n\nof harm and disregarded that risk, by failing to take reasonable measures to abate\n\nit.” Callahan, 471 F.3d at 1159. Although the district court noted this\n\nrequirement, Grissom failed to remedy the deficiency in an amended complaint.\n\nThe district court therefore properly dismissed this claim.\n\n      D) First Amendment Claim: Retaliation\n\n      Finally, Grissom contends he was transferred to the El Dorado Correctional\n\nFacility in retaliation for filing multiple administrative complaints regarding the\n\n                                          -7-\n\fBactrim incident. As the district court pointed out, this transfer occurred in May\n\nof 2006, more than four years before Grissom filed his complaint. Thus, this\n\nclaim is also subject to dismissal as barred by the two-year statute of limitations.\n\nSee Brown, 465 F.3d at 1188.\n\n                                  III. Conclusion\n\n      For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.\n\nWe also DENY Grissom’s request for leave to proceed in forma pauperis on\n\nappeal and for appointment of counsel. Appellant is directed to make immediate\n\npayment of the appellate filing fees to the district court.\n\n\n\n                                                ENTERED FOR THE COURT\n\n                                                Timothy M.
