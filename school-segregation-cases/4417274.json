Roger Vinson, United States District Judge for the Northern District of\nFlorida, sitting by designation.\n\f                Case: 14-12932       Date Filed: 08/29/2016       Page: 2 of 23\n\n\n       Brent Jacoby appeals the District Court’s grant of summary judgment to\n\n Sheriff Huey Mack in this 42 U.S.C. § 1983 suit. Mr. Jacoby was a pretrial\n\n detainee at the Baldwin County Corrections Center (“Baldwin jail”) in Bay\n\n Minette, Alabama. On August 12, 2012, Mr. Jacoby was placed in administrative\n\n segregation after testing positive for cocaine. He alleges that he was forced sleep\n\n on the floor next to a toilet while in administrative segregation and was exposed\n\n to human excrement as a result. Mr. Jacoby also alleges that the August 15, 2012,\n\n disciplinary hearing that stemmed from his failed drug test was procedurally\n\n inadequate. First, Mr. Jacoby complains that he was prevented from calling a key\n\n witness—Sergeant Griffith—who would have testified in his defense. Second,\n\n Mr. Jacoby argues that one of the disciplinary hearing board members, Officer\n\n Arnold, should not have been permitted to hear the case because he was involved\n\n in the underlying investigation that led to Mr. Jacoby’s arrest.\n\n       On appeal, Mr. Jacoby challenges the District Court’s ruling on two claims,\n\n citing violations of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment for\n\n both.1 Mr. Jacoby first argues that Sheriff Mack violated his substantive due\n\n\n       1\n         The two claims Mr. Jacoby appeals were against Baldwin County, Alabama, Sheriff\nHuey Mack, and former Assistant Chief Deputy of Corrections Dale Byrne in the District Court.\nMr. Jacoby has not appealed the denial of his motion to substitute Major Jimmy Milton, who\nreplaced Major Byrne after his death, as to his individual claims. Similarly, he has not appealed\nthe dismissal of his claims against Baldwin County or his official-capacity claims against the\nindividual defendants. Therefore, Mr. Jacoby’s only claims remaining on appeal are against\nSheriff Mack in his individual capacity for money damages and in his official capacity for\ninjunctive relief. However, since Mr. Jacoby is no longer an inmate at the Baldwin jail, his\n                                               2\n\f                Case: 14-12932           Date Filed: 08/29/2016   Page: 3 of 23\n\n\n process rights by confining him in an unsanitary and overcrowded cell. Mr.\n\n Jacoby also argues that Sheriff Mack violated his procedural due process rights at\n\n his August 15, 2012, disciplinary hearing. We affirm the District Court as to both\n\n claims.\n\n                                                     I.\n\n       We review de novo a district court’s decision on a motion for summary\n\njudgment, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. Terrell v.\n\nSmith, 668 F.3d 1244, 1249–50 (11th Cir. 2012). Summary judgment is proper\n\nwhen “there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and [] the moving party is\n\nentitled to a judgment as a matter of law.” Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317,\n\n322, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 2552 (1986) (quotation omitted); see also Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n56(a). “A party asserting that a fact . . . is genuinely disputed must support the\n\nassertion by . . . citing to particular parts of materials in the record.” Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP. 56(c)(l). Summary judgment is thus warranted “against a party who fails to\n\nmake a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that\n\nparty’s case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.”\n\nCelotex, 477 U.S. at 322, 106 S. Ct. at 2552.\n\n                                                 II.\n\n         Mr. Jacoby alleges that on August 12, 2012, he was placed in\n\n\nclaims for injunctive relief are moot.\n                                                 3\n\f                 Case: 14-12932       Date Filed: 08/29/2016       Page: 4 of 23\n\n\n administrative segregation in the Baldwin jail’s “F-Block” after a urine test\n\n administered by the jail came back positive for cocaine. According to Mr.\n\n Jacoby, he had to sleep on the floor next to a toilet while in administrative\n\n segregation because he was the third inmate in an 8-by-l0-foot cell meant for two.\n\n He also alleges that his cellmates “urinat[ed] and defecat[ed] over him” as he\n\n tried to sleep, and that other inmates in the segregation unit “thr[ew] feces and\n\n urine at him.” Mr. Jacoby alleges that he developed a foot rash due to these\n\n unsanitary conditions and the lack of hygiene products available to him. 2\n\n           On August 15, 2012, Mr. Jacoby had a disciplinary hearing about his failed\n\n drug test. Mr. Jacoby raises the issue of the propriety of one of the three officers\n\n (Officer Arnold) serving on the hearing board after having been present for the\n\n incident that resulted in Mr. Jacoby being disciplined. Mr. Jacoby also says that\n\n he wanted to call Sergeant Griffith as a witness to explain that Mr. Jacoby was\n\n\n       2\n          As we must on summary judgment, we view the facts in the light most favorable to Mr.\nJacoby. Terrell, 668 F.3d at 1250. However, “[a] party asserting that a fact . . . is genuinely\ndisputed must support the assertion by . . . citing to particular parts of materials in the record.”\nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(l). Mr. Jacoby has not pointed to any evidence, such as his own affidavit or\naffidavits from his cellmates, supporting his claim that other inmates threw human waste at him.\nWithout record support, we view Mr. Jacoby’s assertion as a conclusory allegation insufficient to\ncreate a genuine issue of material fact.\n\n        Mr. Jacoby likewise fails to create a triable issue of fact on the question of whether he\nwas deprived of hygiene products. Sheriff Mack submitted affidavit testimony by Major Milton\nsaying that inmates in the segregation unit are given thirty minutes of recreation time each day\nduring which they can shower. Major Milton’s affidavit also says that inmates are permitted to\norder “certain hygiene items” and are provided with “basic sanitary materials.” Again, Mr.\nJacoby fails to “cit[e] to particular parts of materials in the record” that would support his\ncontrary assertion that he was not allowed hygiene products. Id.\n                                                 4\n\f              Case: 14-12932      Date Filed: 08/29/2016     Page: 5 of 23\n\n\n working on drug busts with him, and that Mr. Jacoby was only using drugs as a\n\n cover. However, the hearing board refused to let him call Sergeant Griffith. Mr.\n\n Jacoby was found guilty of cocaine use and given 45 days of segregation. The\n\n next day, Mr. Jacoby was given 24 additional days of segregation after being\n\n found guilty in a separate disciplinary hearing of possessing a small piece of\n\n copper wire that could be used as a weapon.\n\n                                           III.\n\n      To proceed with his constitutional claims, Mr. Jacoby must clear the\n\nsignificant hurdle posed by Sheriff Mack’s qualified immunity defense. “Qualified\n\nimmunity protects government officials performing discretionary functions . . .\n\nfrom liability if their conduct violates no clearly established statutory or\n\nconstitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.” Foy v.\n\nHolston, 94 F.3d 1528, 1532 (11th Cir. 1996). “In this [C]ircuit, the law can be\n\n‘clearly established’ for qualified immunity purposes only by decisions of the U.S.\n\nSupreme Court, Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, or the highest court of the state\n\nwhere the case arose.” Jenkins v. Talladega City Bd. of Educ., 115 F.3d 821, 826\n\nn.4 (11th Cir. 1997). If a public official was acting within the scope of his\n\ndiscretionary authority, the burden falls to the plaintiff to show that qualified\n\nimmunity is inappropriate. Terrell, 668 F.3d at 1250. To do so, the plaintiff must:\n\n(1) “allege facts that establish that the officer violated [his] constitutional rights”;\n\n                                           5\n\f              Case: 14-12932      Date Filed: 08/29/2016    Page: 6 of 23\n\n\nand (2) “show that the right involved was clearly established at the time of the\n\nputative misconduct.” Id. (quotation omitted). We may consider these two prongs\n\nin either order, and a public official is entitled to qualified immunity if the plaintiff\n\nfails to establish either one. See Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 236, 129 S. Ct.\n\n808, 818 (2009).\n\n      Mr. Jacoby does not contest that Sheriff Mack was acting within his\n\ndiscretionary authority at all times relevant to this lawsuit. Instead, he claims that\n\nit was clearly established that both his conditions of confinement and the process\n\nprovided at his August 15 disciplinary hearing were constitutionally inadequate.\n\n“For a constitutional right to be clearly established, its contours must be\n\nsufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing\n\nviolates that right.” Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730, 739, 122 S. Ct. 2508, 2515\n\n(2002) (quotation omitted). The specific action in question need not have been\n\npreviously found unlawful, but “in the light of pre-existing law the unlawfulness\n\nmust be apparent.” Id. (quotation omitted). The central question is whether the\n\nstate of the law at the time of the violation gave the officials “fair warning” that\n\ntheir alleged actions were unconstitutional. Id. at 741, 122 S. Ct. at 2516.\n\n                                           IV.\n\n      We first consider whether it was clearly established that Mr. Jacoby’s\n\nconditions of confinement violated his constitutional rights. Again, Mr. Jacoby\n\n                                          6\n\f              Case: 14-12932      Date Filed: 08/29/2016    Page: 7 of 23\n\n\nalleges that he was forced to sleep “on the floor with no mattress and sheets” while\n\n“next to a toilet” during his first night in segregation. Mr. Jacoby continued to\n\nsleep on the floor next to the toilet even after the first night, saying it was his only\n\noption because he was the third occupant in a two-man cell. He alleges that he was\n\nexposed to human excrement and developed a foot rash as a result of these\n\nconditions.\n\n      While the conditions under which a convicted inmate are held are\n\nscrutinized under the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on cruel and unusual\n\npunishment, the conditions under which a pretrial detainee are held are reviewed\n\nunder the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. See Bell v. Wolfish,\n\n441 U.S. 520, 535 n.16, 99 S. Ct. 1861, 1872 n.16 (1979) (using the Fifth\n\nAmendment Due Process Clause). The Supreme Court established the standard for\n\nsubstantive due process claims raised by pretrial detainees in Bell. Bell teaches\n\nthat “a [pretrial] detainee may not be punished prior to an adjudication of guilt in\n\naccordance with due process of law.” Id. at 535, 99 S. Ct. at 1872; see also\n\nMcMillian v. Johnson, 88 F.3d 1554, 1564 (11th Cir.), amended on other grounds\n\non reh’g by 101 F.3d 1363 (11th Cir. 1996). However, the government “may\n\ndetain him to ensure his presence at trial and may subject him to the restrictions\n\nand conditions of the detention facility so long as those conditions and restrictions\n\ndo not amount to punishment, or otherwise violate the Constitution.” Bell, 441\n\n                                          7\n\f               Case: 14-12932       Date Filed: 08/29/2016       Page: 8 of 23\n\n\nU.S. at 536–37, 99 S. Ct. at 1873.\n\n\n\n       “[W]hether a condition of pretrial detention amounts to punishment turns on\n\nwhether the condition is imposed for the purpose of punishment or whether it is\n\nincident to some legitimate government purpose.” Magluta v. Samples, 375 F.3d\n\n1269, 1273 (11th Cir. 2004) (citing Bell, 441 U.S. at 538, 99 S. Ct. at 1873). “[A]n\n\nexpressed intent to punish on the part of detention facility officials” is sufficient,\n\nbut not necessary, to establish unconstitutional pretrial punishment. Bell, 441 U.S.\n\nat 538, 99 S. Ct. at 1873–74; see also McMillian, 88 F.3d at 1564. “[A] court\n\n[also] permissibly may infer that the purpose of the governmental action is\n\npunishment” if the “restriction or condition is not reasonably related to a legitimate\n\ngoal—if it is arbitrary or purposeless.” Bell, 441 U.S. at 539, 99 S. Ct. at 1874.\n\n       Bell effectively creates a two-part test. First, a court must ask whether any\n\n“legitimate goal” was served by the prison conditions. Second, it must ask whether\n\nthe conditions are “reasonably related” to that goal. And, to defeat Sheriff Mack’s\n\nclaim of qualified immunity, Mr. Jacoby must point to precedent that would give\n\nSheriff Mack “fair warning” that these requirements would not be met under the\n\nconditions of confinement Mr. Jacoby says he experienced.3 See Hope, 536 U.S.\n\n\n       3\n         In Hamm v. DeKalb County, 774 F.2d 1567 (11th Cir. 1985), this Court held that “in\nregard to providing pretrial detainees with such basic necessities as food, living space, and\nmedical care the minimum standard allowed by the due process clause is the same as that\n                                               8\n\f                Case: 14-12932       Date Filed: 08/29/2016       Page: 9 of 23\n\n\nat 741, 122 S. Ct. at 2516. We hold that Mr. Jacoby has failed to make this\n\nshowing. He has pointed to no caselaw clearly establishing that putting him in a\n\ncell with two other inmates was unconstitutional punishment in violation of Bell.\n\nTo the contrary, in Bell itself the Supreme Court held that “double-bunking”\n\n(placing two inmates in a cell intended for one) does not constitute punishment.\n\n441 U.S. at 541–42, 99 S. Ct. at 1875–76. Neither has Mr. Jacoby pointed to any\n\ncaselaw clearly establishing that having to sleep on a mattress on the floor violated\n\nhis constitutional rights. In fact, in Hamm, this Court held that “[t]he fact that [a\n\npretrial detainee] temporarily had to sleep upon a mattress on the floor or on a table\n\nis not necessarily a constitutional violation.” 774 F.2d at 1575.\n\n       Mr. Jacoby cites Chandler v. Baird, 926 F.2d 1057 (11th Cir. 1991), Jordan\n\nv. Doe, 38 F.3d 1559 (11th Cir. 1994), and Brooks v. Warden, 800 F.3d 1295 (11th\n\nCir. 2015), as caselaw clearly establishing the constitutional violations he alleges.\n\nIn Chandler, this Court ruled that a convicted inmate who alleged he was\n\n“confine[d] in a cold cell with no clothes except undershorts and with a plastic-\n\n\nallowed by the eighth amendment for convicted persons.” Id. at 1574. Relying on Hamm, the\nMagistrate Judge’s Report and Recommendation (which the District Court adopted) applied the\nEighth Amendment’s subjective deliberate indifference standard to Mr. Jacoby’s due process\nclaim. That is, the District Court found that Mr. Jacoby had not established: (1) an “objective[],\nsufficiently serious” risk of harm, and (2) “deliberate indifference” to that risk by prison\nofficials. Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 834, 114 S. Ct. 1970, 1977 (1994) (quotations\nomitted). We conclude that the outcome in this case is the same under either Hamm or Bell, and\nso apply the Supreme Court’s articulation of the standard for pretrial detainees from Bell on\nappeal. However, we need not decide Mr. Jacoby’s claim that the Eighth Amendment’s\nsubjective deliberate indifference standard conflicts with Bell’s objective “punishment” standard.\n\n                                              9\n\f               Case: 14-12932       Date Filed: 08/29/2016       Page: 10 of 23\n\n\ncovered mattress without bedding; filth on the cell’s floor and walls; deprivation of\n\ntoilet paper for three days; deprivation of running water for two days; lack of soap,\n\ntoothbrush, toothpaste, and linen; and the earlier occupancy of the cell by an\n\ninmate afflicted with an HIV virus” established a triable issue of fact. 926 F.2d at\n\n1063, 1065. Likewise, in Jordan we held that a pretrial detainee’s allegations that\n\nhe was held in “overcrowded, unsanitary local jails where the food was\n\ncontaminated and fire hazards existed” were sufficient for his claims to survive a\n\nmotion to dismiss (though we ultimately held that the government officials in that\n\ncase should have been granted qualified immunity). 38 F.3d at 1565, 1567. And\n\nfinally, in Brooks we reversed the dismissal of a convicted inmate’s claims that he\n\n“was forced to defecate into his jumpsuit and sit in his own feces for two days\n\nduring his three-day hospital stay.” 800 F.3d at 1303.\n\n       Taken in the light most favorable to him, Mr. Jacoby’s allegations establish\n\nthat he was temporarily forced to sleep on a mattress on the floor near the toilet. 4\n\nHis circumstances are not enough like those described in Chandler, Brooks, and\n\nJordan for those cases to clearly establish that his conditions of confinement were\n\nunconstitutional. We therefore affirm the District Court’s ruling on Mr. Jacoby’s\n\n\n       4\n         In his complaint, Mr. Jacoby also alleged that he was confined for 23.5 hours per day in\nan overcrowded cell. Sheriff Mack confirms that “[i]nmates are generally allowed thirty (30)\nminutes time recreation in segregation.” The number of hours Mr. Jacoby was confined each\nday gives us pause. However, Mr. Jacoby has not argued on appeal that this condition of his\nconfinement violated his substantive due process rights, so he has abandoned this argument. See\nHamilton v. Southland Christian Sch., Inc., 680 F.3d 1316, 1318 (11th Cir. 2012).\n                                               10\n\f             Case: 14-12932      Date Filed: 08/29/2016   Page: 11 of 23\n\n\nsubstantive due process claim.\n\n                                          V.\n\n      We next consider whether Sheriff Mack violated Mr. Jacoby’s clearly\n\nestablished procedural due process rights during the August 15, 2012, disciplinary\n\nhearing. Mr. Jacoby argues that his disciplinary hearing was constitutionally\n\ninadequate because: (1) he was not permitted to call Sergeant Griffith as a witness;\n\nand (2) Officer Arnold, who brought him to his drug test and then to the F-Block\n\nafterwards, was one of the three presiding officers.\n\n                                          A.\n\n      The Fourteenth Amendment due process safeguards that must be afforded to\n\nboth pretrial detainees and convicted inmates in prison disciplinary hearings are\n\ngoverned by Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 94 S. Ct. 2963 (1974). See Bell,\n\n441 U.S. at 545, 99 S. Ct. at 1877. But for an inmate to be entitled to those\n\nsafeguards, he must have an interest “sufficiently embraced within Fourteenth\n\nAmendment ‘liberty’ to entitle him to th[e] minimum procedures appropriate under\n\nthe circumstances and required by the Due Process Clause.” Wolff, 418 U.S. at\n\n557, 94 S. Ct. at 2975; see also Bass v. Perrin, 170 F.3d 1312, 1318 (11th Cir.\n\n1999) (“[W]e must determine whether the injury claimed by the plaintiff[] is\n\nwithin the scope of the Due Process Clause[, which] protects against deprivations\n\nof ‘life, liberty, or property without due process of law.’” (quoting U.S. Const.\n\n                                         11\n\f             Case: 14-12932     Date Filed: 08/29/2016    Page: 12 of 23\n\n\nAmend. XIV)).\n\n      Whether an inmate has a protected liberty interest that would entitle him to\n\ndue process protections “is often a difficult determination in the context of a\n\nprison, because prisoners have already been deprived of their liberty in the\n\nordinary sense of the term.” Bass, 170 F.3d at 1318. In Sandin v. Conner, 515\n\nU.S. 472, 115 S. Ct. 2293 (1995), the Supreme Court gave us the test for\n\ndetermining whether a convicted inmate has a protected liberty interest. This test\n\nexamines the hardship imposed on the inmate relative to the “basic conditions” of\n\nprison life. See id. at 485, 115 S. Ct. at 2301. Under this test, a convicted inmate\n\nis entitled to procedural due process in two circumstances. First, he is entitled to a\n\nmeasure of procedural due process when an increased restraint “exceed[s] [his]\n\nsentence in such an unexpected manner as to give rise to protection by the Due\n\nProcess Clause of its own force.” Id. at 484, 115 S. Ct. at 2300. Second, he is\n\nentitled to a measure of procedural due process when a change in his conditions of\n\nconfinement “imposes atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to\n\nthe ordinary incidents of prison life.” Id.\n\n      In Sandin, the Supreme Court held that placing a convicted inmate in\n\nsegregated confinement for thirty days as discipline was not “a dramatic departure\n\nfrom the basic conditions of [the inmate’s] indeterminate sentence” of thirty years\n\nto life in prison. Id. at 485, 115 S. Ct. at 2301. Therefore, that inmate was not\n\n                                         12\n\f               Case: 14-12932    Date Filed: 08/29/2016     Page: 13 of 23\n\n\nentitled “to the procedural protections set forth in Wolff” before being placed in\n\nsegregation. Id. at 487, 115 S. Ct. at 2302. Citing Sandin, the District Court here\n\nruled against Mr. Jacoby on his procedural due process claim because his\n\nconfinement in disciplinary segregation “simply do[es] not give rise to a\n\nconstitutionally protected liberty interest . . . so as to invoke [] due process\n\nprocedures.”\n\n      Before considering the District Court’s application of Sandin to Mr.\n\nJacoby’s case, it is important to understand the reasoning that supported its\n\nholding. The Supreme Court explained that a convicted inmate’s disciplinary\n\nsegregation did not give rise to a protected liberty interest because “[d]iscipline by\n\nprison officials in response to a wide range of misconduct falls within the expected\n\nperimeters of the sentence imposed by a court of law.” Sandin, 515 U.S. at 485,\n\n115 S. Ct. at 2301 (emphasis added). The Court also said the disciplinary\n\nsegregation at issue in Sandin was “within the range of confinement to be normally\n\nexpected for one serving an indeterminate term of 30 years to life.” Id. at 487, 115\n\nS. Ct. at 2302.\n\n      Sandin therefore held that disciplinary segregation did not “exceed[] the\n\n[inmate’s] sentence in such an unexpected manner as to give rise to protection by\n\nthe Due Process Clause” or “impose[] atypical and significant hardship on the\n\ninmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life” because he was already\n\n                                          13\n\f             Case: 14-12932     Date Filed: 08/29/2016   Page: 14 of 23\n\n\nsubject to restraint on account of his conviction and sentence. Id. at 484, 115 S. Ct.\n\nat 2300. Said another way, convicted inmates have no right to a due process\n\nhearing before being punished for disciplinary infractions unless the punishment is\n\ndemonstrably harsher than the ordinary conditions of prison life. This is because\n\nthese inmates are already subject to punishment on account of their convictions\n\nand sentences.\n\n      This rationale plainly does not apply to a pretrial detainee like Mr. Jacoby.\n\nAt the time he was detained at the Baldwin jail, Mr. Jacoby “ha[d] been charged\n\nwith a crime [ ] but ha[d] not yet been tried on the charge.” Bell, 441 U.S. at 523,\n\n99 S. Ct. at 1865. It necessarily follows that he had not been convicted or\n\nsentenced. Therefore, as the Supreme Court recognized in Bell, “under the Due\n\nProcess Clause, [he could] not be punished prior to an adjudication of guilt in\n\naccordance with due process of law.” Id. at 535, 99 S. Ct. at 1872. Sandin\n\nrecognized this distinction between convicted inmates, who can be punished\n\nwithout a due process hearing, and pretrial detainees, who cannot. As Sandin said:\n\n      The Court in Bell correctly noted that a detainee “may not be\n      punished prior to an adjudication of guilt in accordance with due\n      process of law.” The Court expressed concern that a State would\n      attempt to punish a detainee for the crime for which he was indicted\n      via preconviction holding conditions.        Such a course would\n      improperly extend the legitimate reasons for which such persons are\n      detained—to ensure their presence at trial.\n\n\n\n                                        14\n\f             Case: 14-12932     Date Filed: 08/29/2016    Page: 15 of 23\n\n\nId. at 484, 115 S. Ct. at 2300 (citations omitted) (quoting Bell, 441 U.S. at 535, 99\n\nS. Ct. at 1872).\n\n      Sandin leaves intact Bell’s holding that “a detainee may not be punished\n\nprior to an adjudication of guilt in accordance with due process of law.” Bell, 441\n\nU.S. at 535, 99 S. Ct. at 1872. It’s true that Mr. Jacoby’s procedural due process\n\nclaim is different than the substantive due process claims brought in Bell. He\n\nchallenges his being placed in segregation after what he views as an inadequate\n\nhearing. He does not challenge the general conditions of his incarceration with this\n\nclaim. And the jail imposed disciplinary segregation not as punishment for the\n\ncrime that led to Mr. Jacoby’s detention, but rather as punishment for his violation\n\nof jail rules. Still, Bell’s teachings apply here with equal force. A pretrial detainee\n\nlike Mr. Jacoby may not be punished for his misconduct while in prison unless he\n\nis given a due process hearing. See id.\n\n      A pretrial detainee need not meet the Sandin standard to establish his right to\n\na due process hearing before being placed in disciplinary segregation. Specifically,\n\na pretrial detainee is not required to prove that his conditions of confinement either\n\n“exceed[] the sentence in such an unexpected manner as to give rise to protection\n\nby the Due Process Clause of its own force” or “impose[] atypical and significant\n\nhardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life,” Sandin,\n\n515 U.S. at 484, 115 S. Ct. at 2300, to be entitled to the process governed by\n\n                                          15\n\f              Case: 14-12932       Date Filed: 08/29/2016     Page: 16 of 23\n\n\nWolff. Rather, a pretrial detainee is entitled to a due process hearing before being\n\nsubjected to “conditions [that] amount to punishment.” Bell, 441 U.S. at 535, 99\n\nS. Ct. at 1872.5\n\n       Of course this does not mean that Mr. Jacoby and his fellow pretrial\n\ndetainees are free to violate jail rules with impunity. Indeed, Bell recognizes the\n\nneed for “preserving internal order and discipline” among pretrial detainees and\n\nconvicted inmates alike. Id. at 546, 99 S. Ct. at 1878. What it does mean,\n\nhowever, is that before Mr. Jacoby, as a pretrial detainee, is punished for violating\n\na jail rule, there must be a due process hearing to determine what rule he violated.\n\nThis approach is consistent with both Bell and Sandin.\n\n       We recognize that, in Magluta, a panel of this Court applied the Sandin test\n\nto a pretrial detainee’s procedural due process claim. See 375 F.3d at 1282.\n\nHowever, Magluta does not categorically require the application of Sandin to\n\npretrial detainees’ procedural due process claims for a couple of reasons. First,\n\nMagluta’s analysis rested primarily on pre-Sandin caselaw because the detention at\n\nissue in that case ended two months before the Supreme Court decided Sandin.\n\nTherefore, Magluta first analyzed the plaintiff’s procedural due process claim\n\nunder the “mandatory language” analysis used by the Supreme Court in Hewitt v.\n\n       5\n         As with a substantive due process claim, “whether a condition of pretrial detention\namounts to punishment turns on whether the condition is imposed for the purpose of punishment\nor whether it is incident to some legitimate government purpose.” Magluta, 375 F.3d at 1273\n(citing Bell, 441 U.S. at 538, 99 S. Ct. at 1873).\n                                                16\n\f              Case: 14-12932    Date Filed: 08/29/2016    Page: 17 of 23\n\n\nHelms, 459 U.S. 460, 103 S. Ct. 864 (1983). See Magluta, 375 F.3d at 1280.\n\nUnder the (now discarded) Hewitt test, an inmate had a protected liberty interest if\n\nthe prison regulation under which he was punished included “mandatory” language\n\ncompelling certain procedures. See 459 U.S. at 472, 103 S. Ct. at 871. Applying\n\nthis test, the Magluta panel held that the regulation at issue contained “substantive\n\npredicates and extensive use of mandatory language . . . [that] create[d] a liberty\n\ninterest in remaining in the general prison population.” 375 F.3d at 1281. And\n\nMagluta looked to Hewitt to determine whether the liberty interest was clearly\n\nestablished for the purposes of the defendants’ qualified-immunity claim. See id.\n\nat 1283–84.\n\n      It was only after conducting an extensive analysis under Hewitt that the\n\nMagluta panel turned briefly to Sandin. See id. at 1281–82 & n.8 (acknowledging\n\nthat “after the challenged conduct took place, the Supreme Court expressly\n\nabandoned Hewitt’s methodology” in Sandin). And even then, the Court\n\nreferenced Sandin only to say that “Sandin does not operate to erode the existence\n\nof a liberty interest which was indicated by the state of the law as of the time of the\n\nconduct at issue.” Id. at 1282. In other words, the panel found that Sandin did not\n\ncall for a different conclusion than Hewitt because in Magluta the pretrial detainee\n\nalleged that he had been locked in a closet-sized space with minimal human\n\ncontact for 500 days, so he also met the stricter “atypical hardship” standard. Id.\n\n                                         17\n\f             Case: 14-12932      Date Filed: 08/29/2016    Page: 18 of 23\n\n\nMagluta’s conclusion that the plaintiff met both standards does not mandate the\n\napplication of Sandin to all claims by pretrial detainees. The Magluta panel was\n\nmerely confirming that Sandin did not upset its Hewitt-based holding, which\n\napplied based on the law existing at the time of Mr. Magluta’s detainment.\n\n      Second, the Magluta panel’s application of Sandin does not control here\n\nbecause that panel never actually considered whether Sandin governs claims by\n\npretrial detainees. Instead, Magluta summarily discussed Sandin after it had\n\nalready concluded that the pretrial detainee in question had a protected liberty\n\ninterest under Hewitt. See id. at 1281–82. The Magluta panel’s decision to\n\nproceed to Sandin without considering the antecedent question of whether Sandin\n\napplies to pretrial detainees is not binding on us. See United States v. Verdugo-\n\nUrquidez, 494 U.S. 259, 272, 110 S. Ct. 1056, 1064–65 (1990) (holding that\n\n“assum[ptions] . . . [about] the validity of antecedent propositions . . . are not\n\nbinding in future cases that directly raise the questions”).\n\n      Every other Circuit that has squarely considered this question has concluded\n\nthat Bell creates a due process right for pretrial detainees who are subject to\n\npunishment. See Surprenant v. Rivas, 424 F.3d 5, 17 (1st Cir. 2005) (“[T]he\n\nSandin Court’s rationale applies only to those convicted of crimes—not to pretrial\n\ndetainees. The courts of appeals that have addressed this question are consentient\n\non the point.”); Peoples v. CCA Det. Ctrs., 422 F.3d 1090, 1106 & n.12 (10th Cir.\n\n                                          18\n\f               Case: 14-12932       Date Filed: 08/29/2016      Page: 19 of 23\n\n\n2005), vacated in part on other grounds by 449 F.3d 1097 (10th Cir. 2006) (en\n\nbanc) (per curiam); Benjamin v. Fraser, 264 F.3d 175, 188–89 & n.11 (2d Cir.\n\n2001); Fuentes v. Wagner, 206 F.3d 335, 341–42 & n.9 (3d Cir. 2000); Rapier v.\n\nHarris, 172 F.3d 999, 1005 (7th Cir. 1999); Mitchell v. Dupnik, 75 F.3d 517, 524\n\n(9th Cir. 1996). Magluta’s cursory treatment of Sandin does not prevent us from\n\njoining our Sister Circuits. We hold that, consistent with Bell, Mr. Jacoby was\n\nentitled to the due process protections enshrined in Wolff before being placed in\n\ndisciplinary segregation.\n\n                                              B.\n\n       Because we find that Mr. Jacoby had a protected liberty interest, we must\n\ncontinue beyond where the District Court ended. The Baldwin jail provided Mr.\n\nJacoby with a hearing before placing him in disciplinary segregation, so the\n\nquestion before us is whether it was clearly established that the hearing violated\n\nWolff. 6 Where a constitutionally protected liberty interest exists, Wolff holds that\n\na prison must give an inmate: (1) advance written notice of the charges; (2) a\n\nwritten statement of the reasons for the disciplinary action taken; and (3) the\n\nopportunity to call witnesses and present evidence “when permitting him to do so\n\nwill not be unduly hazardous to institutional safety or correctional goals.” 418\n\n       6\n          Even if the jail had not given Mr. Jacoby a hearing, Sheriff Mack arguably would have\nbeen entitled to qualified immunity. Our caselaw had not, at the time, given fair notice that\npretrial detainees are entitled to a due process hearing before being punished for misconduct\nirrespective of the Sandin analysis.\n                                                 19\n\f               Case: 14-12932   Date Filed: 08/29/2016    Page: 20 of 23\n\n\nU.S. at 564–66, 94 S. Ct. at 2979. Wolff also holds that a prison hearing board\n\nmust be “sufficiently impartial to satisfy the Due Process Clause.” Id. at 571, 94 S.\n\nCt. at 2982.\n\n      Sheriff Mack is entitled to qualified immunity with respect to Mr. Jacoby’s\n\nprocedural due process claims. We start with Mr. Jacoby’s claim that the hearing\n\nboard’s refusal to call Sergeant Griffith as a witness violated his due process rights.\n\nMr. Jacoby suggests that Wolff established that Sheriff Mack had the burden of\n\nproving that calling Sergeant Griffith was “unduly hazardous to institutional safety\n\nor correctional goals.” However, Wolff explicitly rejected the idea that defendants\n\nmust state their reasons for not calling a witness:\n\n      Prison officials must have the necessary discretion to keep the hearing\n      within reasonable limits and to refuse to call witnesses that may create\n      a risk of reprisal or undermine authority, as well as to limit access to\n      other inmates to collect statements or to compile other documentary\n      evidence. Although we do not prescribe it, it would be useful for the\n      [hearing board] to state its reason for refusing to call a witness.\n\nId. at 566, 94 S. Ct. at 2980 (emphasis added).\n\n      “Absent specific allegations that the refusal of a disciplinary committee to\n\ncall witnesses on behalf of the inmate was arbitrary, capricious or an abuse of\n\ndiscretion, the courts are without authority to entertain the issue.” Thomas v.\n\n\n\n\n                                         20\n\f              Case: 14-12932       Date Filed: 08/29/2016      Page: 21 of 23\n\n\nEstelle, 603 F.2d 488, 490 (5th Cir. 1979) (per curiam). 7 Mr. Jacoby’s goal,\n\npresumably, was for Sergeant Griffith to testify that he was aware Mr. Jacoby was\n\ntaking Seroquel as part of their jointly conceived plan to identify inmates\n\nsmuggling drugs into the Baldwin jail. But Mr. Jacoby tested positive for cocaine,\n\nnot Seroquel. Even if Sergeant Griffith testified exactly as Mr. Jacoby claims he\n\nwould have, it’s unclear that testimony would have helped Mr. Jacoby. Mr. Jacoby\n\npoints to no caselaw that would give Sheriff Mack or others at the jail “fair\n\nwarning” that failing to call Sergeant Griffith in circumstances like these was a\n\nviolation of Mr. Jacoby’s due process rights.\n\n       Next, we consider Mr. Jacoby’s claim that he was denied an impartial\n\ntribunal because Officer Arnold sat on the hearing board. Mr. Jacoby emphasizes\n\nthat “Officer Arnold was directly involved in the underlying investigation that\n\nresulted in Mr. Jacoby being charged with a drug violation: he retrieved Mr.\n\nJacoby from his cell; he escorted him to the medical ward for a drug test; he\n\nremained present in the medical ward during Mr. Jacoby’s drug test; and, he put\n\nMr. Jacoby in segregation after the positive test results were returned.” As a\n\nthreshold issue, Sherriff Mack disputes that Officer Arnold was even involved in\n\nthe underlying investigation. Sherriff Mack notes that Officer Arnold was not\n\n\n       7\n         Decisions of the former Fifth Circuit issued before October 1, 1981, are binding\nprecedent on this Court. See Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir. 1981)\n(en banc).\n                                               21\n\f             Case: 14-12932     Date Filed: 08/29/2016    Page: 22 of 23\n\n\nlisted anywhere on the relevant activity report, did not serve as the arresting\n\nofficer, and did not make the decision to drug test Mr. Jacoby.\n\n      Even accepting Mr. Jacoby’s version of events, Officer Arnold’s presence\n\non the hearing board was not a clearly established constitutional violation. Mr.\n\nJacoby cites Redding v. Fairman, 717 F.2d 1105 (7th Cir. 1983), in support of his\n\nclaim. For starters, a Seventh Circuit case cannot clearly establish law in the\n\nEleventh Circuit. See Jenkins, 115 F.3d at 826 n.4. Leaving that issue aside for\n\nthe moment, Redding actually hurts Mr. Jacoby’s argument. In Redding, the\n\nSeventh Circuit rejected a per se rule that disciplinary committee members “should\n\nnot be defendants in pending lawsuits for damages instituted by the very persons\n\nover whom the committee sits in judgment.” Id. at 1113 (quotation omitted). The\n\nCourt said that the “disqualification issue should be decided on a case-by-case\n\nbasis” because “[i]f every named defendant in a prisoners’ rights lawsuit must be\n\ndisqualified from sitting on the [disciplinary board], . . . [it] would vest too much\n\ncontrol in a prisoner to determine the [board’s] make-up.” Id.\n\n      It’s true that Redding acknowledged that a prison official with “direct\n\npersonal or otherwise substantial involvement, such as major participation in a . . .\n\ndecision-making role” in the underlying investigation might be disqualified from a\n\ndisciplinary board. Id. (quotation omitted). We agree that it would have been\n\nfacially improper for an officer with a greater decisionmaking role, such as the\n\n                                         22\n\f             Case: 14-12932     Date Filed: 08/29/2016   Page: 23 of 23\n\n\narresting officer, to serve on the hearing board. However, under Mr. Jacoby’s\n\nversion of the facts, Officer Arnold had no decisionmaking role in his arrest.\n\nOfficer Arnold merely escorted Mr. Jacoby to the drug test, waited with him during\n\nthe test, then put him in disciplinary segregation. Mr. Jacoby has failed to\n\ndemonstrate that Officer Arnold’s presence on the hearing board was a clearly\n\nestablished constitutional violation. Because he has not made such a showing as to\n\neither of his two procedural complaints, we affirm the District Court’s grant of\n\nsummary judgment in favor of Sheriff Mack on this claim.\n\n                                   *      *      *\n\n      Because Mr. Jacoby is a pretrial detainee, his substantive and procedural due\n\nprocess claims fall within Bell’s ambit. We reiterate Bell’s holding that “a\n\n[pretrial] detainee may not be punished prior to an adjudication of guilt in\n\naccordance with due process of law.” 441 U.S. at 535, 99 S. Ct. at 1872. For this\n\nreason, we hold that Mr. Jacoby was entitled to the due process hearing he received\n\nbefore being punished for his misconduct while in jail. However, because Mr.\n\nJacoby has failed to overcome Sheriff Mack’s qualified immunity defense on either\n\nof his claims, we affirm the District Court’s grant of summary judgment.\n\n      AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                         23\n\f",

Roger Vinson, United States District Judge for the Northern District of\nFlorida, sitting by designation.\n\f                Case: 14-12932       Date Filed: 08/29/2016       Page: 2 of 23\n\n\n       Brent Jacoby appeals the District Court’s grant of summary judgment to\n\n Sheriff Huey Mack in this 42 U.S.C. § 1983 suit. Mr. Jacoby was a pretrial\n\n detainee at the Baldwin County Corrections Center (“Baldwin jail”) in Bay\n\n Minette, Alabama. On August 12, 2012, Mr. Jacoby was placed in administrative\n\n segregation after testing positive for cocaine. He alleges that he was forced sleep\n\n on the floor next to a toilet while in administrative segregation and was exposed\n\n to human excrement as a result. Mr. Jacoby also alleges that the August 15, 2012,\n\n disciplinary hearing that stemmed from his failed drug test was procedurally\n\n inadequate. First, Mr. Jacoby complains that he was prevented from calling a key\n\n witness—Sergeant Griffith—who would have testified in his defense. Second,\n\n Mr. Jacoby argues that one of the disciplinary hearing board members, Officer\n\n Arnold, should not have been permitted to hear the case because he was involved\n\n in the underlying investigation that led to Mr. Jacoby’s arrest.\n\n       On appeal, Mr. Jacoby challenges the District Court’s ruling on two claims,\n\n citing violations of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment for\n\n both.1 Mr. Jacoby first argues that Sheriff Mack violated his substantive due\n\n\n       1\n         The two claims Mr. Jacoby appeals were against Baldwin County, Alabama, Sheriff\nHuey Mack, and former Assistant Chief Deputy of Corrections Dale Byrne in the District Court.\nMr. Jacoby has not appealed the denial of his motion to substitute Major Jimmy Milton, who\nreplaced Major Byrne after his death, as to his individual claims. Similarly, he has not appealed\nthe dismissal of his claims against Baldwin County or his official-capacity claims against the\nindividual defendants. Therefore, Mr. Jacoby’s only claims remaining on appeal are against\nSheriff Mack in his individual capacity for money damages and in his official capacity for\ninjunctive relief. However, since Mr. Jacoby is no longer an inmate at the Baldwin jail, his\n                                               2\n\f                Case: 14-12932           Date Filed: 08/29/2016   Page: 3 of 23\n\n\n process rights by confining him in an unsanitary and overcrowded cell. Mr.\n\n Jacoby also argues that Sheriff Mack violated his procedural due process rights at\n\n his August 15, 2012, disciplinary hearing. We affirm the District Court as to both\n\n claims.\n\n                                                     I.\n\n       We review de novo a district court’s decision on a motion for summary\n\njudgment, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.

According to Mr.\n\n Jacoby, he had to sleep on the floor next to a toilet while in administrative\n\n segregation because he was the third inmate in an 8-by-l0-foot cell meant for two.\n\n He also alleges that his cellmates “urinat[ed] and defecat[ed] over him” as he\n\n tried to sleep, and that other inmates in the segregation unit “thr[ew] feces and\n\n urine at him.” Mr. Jacoby alleges that he developed a foot rash due to these\n\n unsanitary conditions and the lack of hygiene products available to him. 2\n\n           On August 15, 2012, Mr. Jacoby had a disciplinary hearing about his failed\n\n drug test. Mr. Jacoby raises the issue of the propriety of one of the three officers\n\n (Officer Arnold) serving on the hearing board after having been present for the\n\n incident that resulted in Mr. Jacoby being disciplined. Mr. Jacoby also says that\n\n he wanted to call Sergeant Griffith as a witness to explain that Mr. Jacoby was\n\n\n       2\n          As we must on summary judgment, we view the facts in the light most favorable to Mr.\nJacoby. Terrell, 668 F.3d at 1250. However, “[a] party asserting that a fact . . . is genuinely\ndisputed must support the assertion by . . . citing to particular parts of materials in the record.”\nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(l). Mr. Jacoby has not pointed to any evidence, such as his own affidavit or\naffidavits from his cellmates, supporting his claim that other inmates threw human waste at him.\nWithout record support, we view Mr. Jacoby’s assertion as a conclusory allegation insufficient to\ncreate a genuine issue of material fact.\n\n        Mr. Jacoby likewise fails to create a triable issue of fact on the question of whether he\nwas deprived of hygiene products. Sheriff Mack submitted affidavit testimony by Major Milton\nsaying that inmates in the segregation unit are given thirty minutes of recreation time each day\nduring which they can shower. Major Milton’s affidavit also says that inmates are permitted to\norder “certain hygiene items” and are provided with “basic sanitary materials.” Again, Mr.\nJacoby fails to “cit[e] to particular parts of materials in the record” that would support his\ncontrary assertion that he was not allowed hygiene products. Id.\n                                                 4\n\f              Case: 14-12932      Date Filed: 08/29/2016     Page: 5 of 23\n\n\n working on drug busts with him, and that Mr. Jacoby was only using drugs as a\n\n cover. However, the hearing board refused to let him call Sergeant Griffith. Mr.\n\n Jacoby was found guilty of cocaine use and given 45 days of segregation. The\n\n next day, Mr. Jacoby was given 24 additional days of segregation after being\n\n found guilty in a separate disciplinary hearing of possessing a small piece of\n\n copper wire that could be used as a weapon.\n\n                                           III.\n\n      To proceed with his constitutional claims, Mr. Jacoby must clear the\n\nsignificant hurdle posed by Sheriff Mack’s qualified immunity defense. “Qualified\n\nimmunity protects government officials performing discretionary functions . . .\n\nfrom liability if their conduct violates no clearly established statutory or\n\nconstitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.” Foy v.\n\nHolston, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"71250\"><a href=\"/opinion/71250/foy-v-holston/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1528</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1532 (11th Cir. 1996). “In this [C]ircuit, the law can be\n\n‘clearly established’ for qualified immunity purposes only by decisions of the U.S.\n\nSupreme Court, Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, or the highest court of the state\n\nwhere the case arose.” Jenkins v. Talladega City Bd. of Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"741842\"><a href=\"/opinion/741842/cassandra-jenkins-a-minor-by-her-mother-and-next-friend-sandra-hall/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">821</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 826\n\nn.4 (11th Cir. 1997). If a public official was acting within the scope of his\n\ndiscretionary authority, the burden falls to the plaintiff to show that qualified\n\nimmunity is inappropriate. Terrell, 668 F.3d at 1250. To do so, the plaintiff must:\n\n(1) “allege facts that establish that the officer violated [his] constitutional rights”;\n\n                                           5\n\f              Case: 14-12932      Date Filed: 08/29/2016    Page: 6 of 23\n\n\nand (2) “show that the right involved was clearly established at the time of the\n\nputative misconduct.” Id. (quotation omitted). We may consider these two prongs\n\nin either order, and a public official is entitled to qualified immunity if the plaintiff\n\nfails to establish either one. See Pearson v. Callahan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145918\"><a href=\"/opinion/145918/pearson-v-callahan/\"><span class=\"volume\">555</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">223</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 236, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145918\"><a href=\"/opinion/145918/pearson-v-callahan/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Instead, he claims that\n\nit was clearly established that both his conditions of confinement and the process\n\nprovided at his August 15 disciplinary hearing were constitutionally inadequate.\n\n“For a constitutional right to be clearly established, its contours must be\n\nsufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing\n\nviolates that right.” Hope v.

The specific action in question need not have been\n\npreviously found unlawful, but “in the light of pre-existing law the unlawfulness\n\nmust be apparent.” Id. (quotation omitted).

Mr. Jacoby continued to\n\nsleep on the floor next to the toilet even after the first night, saying it was his only\n\noption because he was the third occupant in a two-man cell. He alleges that he was\n\nexposed to human excrement and developed a foot rash as a result of these\n\nconditions.\n\n      While the conditions under which a convicted inmate are held are\n\nscrutinized under the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on cruel and unusual\n\npunishment, the conditions under which a pretrial detainee are held are reviewed\n\nunder the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Bell, 441 U.S.\n\nat 538, 99 S.

Second, it must ask whether\n\nthe conditions are “reasonably related” to that goal. And, to defeat Sheriff Mack’s\n\nclaim of qualified immunity, Mr. Jacoby must point to precedent that would give\n\nSheriff Mack “fair warning” that these requirements would not be met under the\n\nconditions of confinement Mr. Jacoby says he experienced.3 See Hope, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n\n       <span class=\"page\">3</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n         In Hamm v.

Likewise, in Jordan we held that a pretrial detainee’s allegations that\n\nhe was held in “overcrowded, unsanitary local jails where the food was\n\ncontaminated and fire hazards existed” were sufficient for his claims to survive a\n\nmotion to dismiss (though we ultimately held that the government officials in that\n\ncase should have been granted qualified immunity). 38 F.3d at 1565, 1567. And\n\nfinally, in Brooks we reversed the dismissal of a convicted inmate’s claims that he\n\n“was forced to defecate into his jumpsuit and sit in his own feces for two days\n\nduring his three-day hospital stay.” 800 F.3d at 1303.\n\n       Taken in the light most favorable to him, Mr. Jacoby’s allegations establish\n\nthat he was temporarily forced to sleep on a mattress on the floor near the toilet. 4\n\nHis circumstances are not enough like those described in Chandler, Brooks, and\n\nJordan for those cases to clearly establish that his conditions of confinement were\n\nunconstitutional. We therefore affirm the District Court’s ruling on Mr. Jacoby’s\n\n\n       4\n         In his complaint, Mr. Jacoby also alleged that he was confined for 23.5 hours per day in\nan overcrowded cell. Sheriff Mack confirms that “[i]nmates are generally allowed thirty (30)\nminutes time recreation in segregation.” The number of hours Mr. Jacoby was confined each\nday gives us pause. However, Mr. Jacoby has not argued on appeal that this condition of his\nconfinement violated his substantive due process rights, so he has abandoned this argument. See\nHamilton v.

This test\n\nexamines the hardship imposed on the inmate relative to the “basic conditions” of\n\nprison life. See id. at 485, 115 S. Ct. at 2301. Under this test, a convicted inmate\n\nis entitled to procedural due process in two circumstances. First, he is entitled to a\n\nmeasure of procedural due process when an increased restraint “exceed[s] [his]\n\nsentence in such an unexpected manner as to give rise to protection by the Due\n\nProcess Clause of its own force.” Id. at 484, 115 S. Ct. at 2300. Second, he is\n\nentitled to a measure of procedural due process when a change in his conditions of\n\nconfinement “imposes atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to\n\nthe ordinary incidents of prison life.” Id.\n\n      In Sandin, the Supreme Court held that placing a convicted inmate in\n\nsegregated confinement for thirty days as discipline was not “a dramatic departure\n\nfrom the basic conditions of [the inmate’s] indeterminate sentence” of thirty years\n\nto life in prison. Id. at 485, 115 S. Ct. at 2301. Therefore, that inmate was not\n\n                                         12\n\f               Case: 14-12932    Date Filed: 08/29/2016     Page: 13 of 23\n\n\nentitled “to the procedural protections set forth in Wolff” before being placed in\n\nsegregation. Id. at 487, 115 S. Ct. at 2302. Citing Sandin, the District Court here\n\nruled against Mr. Jacoby on his procedural due process claim because his\n\nconfinement in disciplinary segregation “simply do[es] not give rise to a\n\nconstitutionally protected liberty interest . . . so as to invoke [] due process\n\nprocedures.”\n\n      Before considering the District Court’s application of Sandin to Mr.\n\nJacoby’s case, it is important to understand the reasoning that supported its\n\nholding. The Supreme Court explained that a convicted inmate’s disciplinary\n\nsegregation did not give rise to a protected liberty interest because “[d]iscipline by\n\nprison officials in response to a wide range of misconduct falls within the expected\n\nperimeters of the sentence imposed by a court of law.” Sandin, 515 U.S. at 485,\n\n115 S. Ct. at 2301 (emphasis added). The Court also said the disciplinary\n\nsegregation at issue in Sandin was “within the range of confinement to be normally\n\nexpected for one serving an indeterminate term of 30 years to life.” Id. at 487, 115\n\nS. Ct. at 2302.\n\n      Sandin therefore held that disciplinary segregation did not “exceed[] the\n\n[inmate’s] sentence in such an unexpected manner as to give rise to protection by\n\nthe Due Process Clause” or “impose[] atypical and significant hardship on the\n\ninmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life” because he was already\n\n                                          13\n\f             Case: 14-12932     Date Filed: 08/29/2016   Page: 14 of 23\n\n\nsubject to restraint on account of his conviction and sentence. Id. at 484, 115 S. Ct.\n\nat 2300. Said another way, convicted inmates have no right to a due process\n\nhearing before being punished for disciplinary infractions unless the punishment is\n\ndemonstrably harsher than the ordinary conditions of prison life. This is because\n\nthese inmates are already subject to punishment on account of their convictions\n\nand sentences.\n\n      This rationale plainly does not apply to a pretrial detainee like Mr. Jacoby.\n\nAt the time he was detained at the Baldwin jail, Mr. Jacoby “ha[d] been charged\n\nwith a crime [ ] but ha[d] not yet been tried on the charge.” Bell, 441 U.S. at 523,\n\n99 S. Ct. at 1865. It necessarily follows that he had not been convicted or\n\nsentenced. Therefore, as the Supreme Court recognized in Bell, “under the Due\n\nProcess Clause, [he could] not be punished prior to an adjudication of guilt in\n\naccordance with due process of law.” Id. at 535, 99 S. Ct. at 1872. Sandin\n\nrecognized this distinction between convicted inmates, who can be punished\n\nwithout a due process hearing, and pretrial detainees, who cannot. As Sandin said:\n\n      The Court in Bell correctly noted that a detainee “may not be\n      punished prior to an adjudication of guilt in accordance with due\n      process of law.” The Court expressed concern that a State would\n      attempt to punish a detainee for the crime for which he was indicted\n      via preconviction holding conditions.        Such a course would\n      improperly extend the legitimate reasons for which such persons are\n      detained—to ensure their presence at trial.\n\n\n\n                                        14\n\f             Case: 14-12932     Date Filed: 08/29/2016    Page: 15 of 23\n\n\nId. at 484, 115 S. Ct. at 2300 (citations omitted) (quoting Bell, 441 U.S. at 535, 99\n\nS. Ct. at 1872).\n\n      Sandin leaves intact Bell’s holding that “a detainee may not be punished\n\nprior to an adjudication of guilt in accordance with due process of law.” Bell, 441\n\nU.S. at 535, 99 S. Ct. at 1872. It’s true that Mr. Jacoby’s procedural due process\n\nclaim is different than the substantive due process claims brought in Bell. He\n\nchallenges his being placed in segregation after what he views as an inadequate\n\nhearing. He does not challenge the general conditions of his incarceration with this\n\nclaim. And the jail imposed disciplinary segregation not as punishment for the\n\ncrime that led to Mr. Jacoby’s detention, but rather as punishment for his violation\n\nof jail rules. Still, Bell’s teachings apply here with equal force. A pretrial detainee\n\nlike Mr. Jacoby may not be punished for his misconduct while in prison unless he\n\nis given a due process hearing. See id.\n\n      A pretrial detainee need not meet the Sandin standard to establish his right to\n\na due process hearing before being placed in disciplinary segregation. Specifically,\n\na pretrial detainee is not required to prove that his conditions of confinement either\n\n“exceed[] the sentence in such an unexpected manner as to give rise to protection\n\nby the Due Process Clause of its own force” or “impose[] atypical and significant\n\nhardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life,” Sandin,\n\n515 U.S. at 484, 115 S. Ct. at 2300, to be entitled to the process governed by\n\n                                          15\n\f              Case: 14-12932       Date Filed: 08/29/2016     Page: 16 of 23\n\n\nWolff. Rather, a pretrial detainee is entitled to a due process hearing before being\n\nsubjected to “conditions [that] amount to punishment.” Bell, 441 U.S. at 535, 99\n\nS. Ct. at 1872.5\n\n       Of course this does not mean that Mr. Jacoby and his fellow pretrial\n\ndetainees are free to violate jail rules with impunity. Indeed, Bell recognizes the\n\nneed for “preserving internal order and discipline” among pretrial detainees and\n\nconvicted inmates alike. Id. at 546, 99 S. Ct. at 1878. What it does mean,\n\nhowever, is that before Mr. Jacoby, as a pretrial detainee, is punished for violating\n\na jail rule, there must be a due process hearing to determine what rule he violated.\n\nThis approach is consistent with both Bell and Sandin.\n\n       We recognize that, in Magluta, a panel of this Court applied the Sandin test\n\nto a pretrial detainee’s procedural due process claim. See 375 F.3d at 1282.\n\nHowever, Magluta does not categorically require the application of Sandin to\n\npretrial detainees’ procedural due process claims for a couple of reasons. First,\n\nMagluta’s analysis rested primarily on pre-Sandin caselaw because the detention at\n\nissue in that case ended two months before the Supreme Court decided Sandin.\n\nTherefore, Magluta first analyzed the plaintiff’s procedural due process claim\n\nunder the “mandatory language” analysis used by the Supreme Court in Hewitt v.\n\n       5\n         As with a substantive due process claim, “whether a condition of pretrial detention\namounts to punishment turns on whether the condition is imposed for the purpose of punishment\nor whether it is incident to some legitimate government purpose.” Magluta, 375 F.3d at 1273\n(citing Bell, 441 U.S. at 538, 99 S. Ct. at 1873).\n                                                16\n\f              Case: 14-12932    Date Filed: 08/29/2016    Page: 17 of 23\n\n\nHelms, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110829\"><a href=\"/opinion/110829/hewitt-v-helms/\"><span class=\"volume\">459</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">460</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110829\"><a href=\"/opinion/110829/hewitt-v-helms/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

See Magluta, 375 F.3d at 1280.\n\nUnder the (now discarded) Hewitt test, an inmate had a protected liberty interest if\n\nthe prison regulation under which he was punished included “mandatory” language\n\ncompelling certain procedures. See 459 U.S. at 472, 103 S. Ct. at 871. Applying\n\nthis test, the Magluta panel held that the regulation at issue contained “substantive\n\npredicates and extensive use of mandatory language . . . [that] create[d] a liberty\n\ninterest in remaining in the general prison population.” 375 F.3d at 1281. And\n\nMagluta looked to Hewitt to determine whether the liberty interest was clearly\n\nestablished for the purposes of the defendants’ qualified-immunity claim. See id.\n\nat 1283–84.\n\n      It was only after conducting an extensive analysis under Hewitt that the\n\nMagluta panel turned briefly to Sandin. See id. at 1281–82 & n.8 (acknowledging\n\nthat “after the challenged conduct took place, the Supreme Court expressly\n\nabandoned Hewitt’s methodology” in Sandin). And even then, the Court\n\nreferenced Sandin only to say that “Sandin does not operate to erode the existence\n\nof a liberty interest which was indicated by the state of the law as of the time of the\n\nconduct at issue.” Id. at 1282. In other words, the panel found that Sandin did not\n\ncall for a different conclusion than Hewitt because in Magluta the pretrial detainee\n\nalleged that he had been locked in a closet-sized space with minimal human\n\ncontact for 500 days, so he also met the stricter “atypical hardship” standard. Id.\n\n                                         17\n\f             Case: 14-12932      Date Filed: 08/29/2016    Page: 18 of 23\n\n\nMagluta’s conclusion that the plaintiff met both standards does not mandate the\n\napplication of Sandin to all claims by pretrial detainees. The Magluta panel was\n\nmerely confirming that Sandin did not upset its Hewitt-based holding, which\n\napplied based on the law existing at the time of Mr. Magluta’s detainment.\n\n      Second, the Magluta panel’s application of Sandin does not control here\n\nbecause that panel never actually considered whether Sandin governs claims by\n\npretrial detainees. Instead, Magluta summarily discussed Sandin after it had\n\nalready concluded that the pretrial detainee in question had a protected liberty\n\ninterest under Hewitt. See id. at 1281–82. The Magluta panel’s decision to\n\nproceed to Sandin without considering the antecedent question of whether Sandin\n\napplies to pretrial detainees is not binding on us. See United States v.

Magluta’s cursory treatment of Sandin does not prevent us from\n\njoining our Sister Circuits. We hold that, consistent with Bell, Mr. Jacoby was\n\nentitled to the due process protections enshrined in Wolff before being placed in\n\ndisciplinary segregation.\n\n                                              B.\n\n       Because we find that Mr. Jacoby had a protected liberty interest, we must\n\ncontinue beyond where the District Court ended. The Baldwin jail provided Mr.\n\nJacoby with a hearing before placing him in disciplinary segregation, so the\n\nquestion before us is whether it was clearly established that the hearing violated\n\nWolff. 6 Where a constitutionally protected liberty interest exists, Wolff holds that\n\na prison must give an inmate: (1) advance written notice of the charges; (2) a\n\nwritten statement of the reasons for the disciplinary action taken; and (3) the\n\nopportunity to call witnesses and present evidence “when permitting him to do so\n\nwill not be unduly hazardous to institutional safety or correctional goals.” 418\n\n       6\n          Even if the jail had not given Mr. Jacoby a hearing, Sheriff Mack arguably would have\nbeen entitled to qualified immunity. Our caselaw had not, at the time, given fair notice that\npretrial detainees are entitled to a due process hearing before being punished for misconduct\nirrespective of the Sandin analysis.\n                                                 19\n\f               Case: 14-12932   Date Filed: 08/29/2016    Page: 20 of 23\n\n\nU.S. at 564–66, 94 S. Ct. at 2979. Wolff also holds that a prison hearing board\n\nmust be “sufficiently impartial to satisfy the Due Process Clause.” Id. at 571, 94 S.\n\nCt. at 2982.\n\n      Sheriff Mack is entitled to qualified immunity with respect to Mr. Jacoby’s\n\nprocedural due process claims. We start with Mr. Jacoby’s claim that the hearing\n\nboard’s refusal to call Sergeant Griffith as a witness violated his due process rights.\n\nMr. Jacoby suggests that Wolff established that Sheriff Mack had the burden of\n\nproving that calling Sergeant Griffith was “unduly hazardous to institutional safety\n\nor correctional goals.” However, Wolff explicitly rejected the idea that defendants\n\nmust state their reasons for not calling a witness:\n\n      Prison officials must have the necessary discretion to keep the hearing\n      within reasonable limits and to refuse to call witnesses that may create\n      a risk of reprisal or undermine authority, as well as to limit access to\n      other inmates to collect statements or to compile other documentary\n      evidence. Although we do not prescribe it, it would be useful for the\n      [hearing board] to state its reason for refusing to call a witness.\n\nId. at 566, 94 S. Ct. at 2980 (emphasis added).\n\n      “Absent specific allegations that the refusal of a disciplinary committee to\n\ncall witnesses on behalf of the inmate was arbitrary, capricious or an abuse of\n\ndiscretion, the courts are without authority to entertain the issue.” Thomas v.\n\n\n\n\n                                         20\n\f              Case: 14-12932       Date Filed: 08/29/2016      Page: 21 of 23\n\n\nEstelle, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"368873\"><a href=\"/opinion/368873/earnest-lee-thomas-v-w-j-estelle-jr-director-texas-department-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">603</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">488</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 490 (5th Cir. 1979) (per curiam). 7 Mr. Jacoby’s goal,\n\npresumably, was for Sergeant Griffith to testify that he was aware Mr. Jacoby was\n\ntaking Seroquel as part of their jointly conceived plan to identify inmates\n\nsmuggling drugs into the Baldwin jail. But Mr. Jacoby tested positive for cocaine,\n\nnot Seroquel. Even if Sergeant Griffith testified exactly as Mr. Jacoby claims he\n\nwould have, it’s unclear that testimony would have helped Mr. Jacoby. Mr. Jacoby\n\npoints to no caselaw that would give Sheriff Mack or others at the jail “fair\n\nwarning” that failing to call Sergeant Griffith in circumstances like these was a\n\nviolation of Mr. Jacoby’s due process rights.\n\n       Next, we consider Mr. Jacoby’s claim that he was denied an impartial\n\ntribunal because Officer Arnold sat on the hearing board. Mr. Jacoby emphasizes\n\nthat “Officer Arnold was directly involved in the underlying investigation that\n\nresulted in Mr. Jacoby being charged with a drug violation: he retrieved Mr.\n\nJacoby from his cell; he escorted him to the medical ward for a drug test; he\n\nremained present in the medical ward during Mr. Jacoby’s drug test; and, he put\n\nMr. Jacoby in segregation after the positive test results were returned.” As a\n\nthreshold issue, Sherriff Mack disputes that Officer Arnold was even involved in\n\nthe underlying investigation. Sherriff Mack notes that Officer Arnold was not\n\n\n       7\n         Decisions of the former Fifth Circuit issued before October 1, 1981, are binding\nprecedent on this Court. See Bonner v. City of Prichard, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"396175\"><a href=\"/opinion/396175/larry-bonner-v-city-of-prichard-alabama/\"><span class=\"volume\">661</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1206</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1209 (11th Cir. 1981)\n(en banc).\n                                               21\n\f             Case: 14-12932     Date Filed: 08/29/2016    Page: 22 of 23\n\n\nlisted anywhere on the relevant activity report, did not serve as the arresting\n\nofficer, and did not make the decision to drug test Mr. Jacoby.\n\n      Even accepting Mr. Jacoby’s version of events, Officer Arnold’s presence\n\non the hearing board was not a clearly established constitutional violation. Mr.\n\nJacoby cites Redding v. Fairman, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">717</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1105</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th Cir. 1983), in support of his\n\nclaim. For starters, a Seventh Circuit case cannot clearly establish law in the\n\nEleventh Circuit. See Jenkins, 115 F.3d at 826 n.4. Leaving that issue aside for\n\nthe moment, Redding actually hurts Mr. Jacoby’s argument. In Redding, the\n\nSeventh Circuit rejected a per se rule that disciplinary committee members “should\n\nnot be defendants in pending lawsuits for damages instituted by the very persons\n\nover whom the committee sits in judgment.” Id. at 1113 (quotation omitted). The\n\nCourt said that the “disqualification issue should be decided on a case-by-case\n\nbasis” because “[i]f every named defendant in a prisoners’ rights lawsuit must be\n\ndisqualified from sitting on the [disciplinary board], . . . [it] would vest too much\n\ncontrol in a prisoner to determine the [board’s] make-up.” Id.\n\n      It’s true that Redding acknowledged that a prison official with “direct\n\npersonal or otherwise substantial involvement, such as major participation in a . . .\n\ndecision-making role” in the underlying investigation might be disqualified from a\n\ndisciplinary board. Id. (quotation omitted). We agree that it would have been\n\nfacially improper for an officer with a greater decisionmaking role, such as the\n\n                                         22\n\f             Case: 14-12932     Date Filed: 08/29/2016   Page: 23 of 23\n\n\narresting officer, to serve on the hearing board. However, under Mr. Jacoby’s\n\nversion of the facts, Officer Arnold had no decisionmaking role in his arrest.\n\nOfficer Arnold merely escorted Mr. Jacoby to the drug test, waited with him during\n\nthe test, then put him in disciplinary segregation. Mr. Jacoby has failed to\n\ndemonstrate that Officer Arnold’s presence on the hearing board was a clearly\n\nestablished constitutional violation. Because he has not made such a showing as to\n\neither of his two procedural complaints, we affirm the District Court’s grant of\n\nsummary judgment in favor of Sheriff Mack on this claim.\n\n                                   *      *      *\n\n      Because Mr. Jacoby is a pretrial detainee, his substantive and procedural due\n\nprocess claims fall within Bell’s ambit. We reiterate Bell’s holding that “a\n\n[pretrial] detainee may not be punished prior to an adjudication of guilt in\n\naccordance with due process of law.” 441 U.S. at 535, 99 S. Ct. at 1872. For this\n\nreason, we hold that Mr. Jacoby was entitled to the due process hearing he received\n\nbefore being punished for his misconduct while in jail. However, because Mr.\n\nJacoby has failed to overcome Sheriff Mack’s qualified immunity defense on either\n\nof his claims, we affirm the District Court’s grant of summary judgment.\n\n      AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                         23\n\f</pre>",
