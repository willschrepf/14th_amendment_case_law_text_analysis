INTRODUCTION\n\n       Plaintiffs R.C. and M.C. brought this action on behalf of themselves and their daughter\n\nQ.C-C. 1 under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, 20 U.S.C. §§ 1400 et seq. (the\n\n“IDEA”) against Defendant the District of Columbia (the “District”). Plaintiffs appeal from an\n\nadministrative decision that, in relevant part, found that the District of Columbia Public Schools\n\n(“DCPS”) denied Q.C-C. a free appropriate public education as required by the IDEA but\n\ndeclined to order the relief requested by Plaintiffs. Before the Court are the parties’ cross-\n\nmotions for summary judgment. See Pls.’ Mot. Summ. J., ECF No. 9; Def.’s Opp’n Pls.’ Mot.\n\nSumm. J. & Def.’s Cross-Mot. Summ. J., ECF No. 11. For the reasons provided below, the\n\nCourt will grant Plaintiffs’ motion and deny the District’s motion.\n\n\n\n\n1\n       The Court has permitted Plaintiffs to proceed anonymously in this action pursuant to\nRule 5.2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and Local Civil Rule 5.1(h). See Order, ECF\nNo. 3.\n\f                                       II. BACKGROUND\n\n       The Court begins by providing an overview of the framework of the IDEA before turning\n\nto the factual background and procedural history of this case.\n\n                                    A. Statutory Framework\n\n       Under the IDEA, “every child with a disability in this country is entitled to a ‘free\n\nappropriate public education,’ or FAPE.” Leggett v. District of Columbia, 793 F.3d 59, 62 (D.C.\n\nCir. 2015) (quoting 20 U.S.C. § 1400(d)(1)(A)). The “primary purpose” of the Act is “‘to ensure\n\nthat all children with disabilities have available to them a[n] . . . education that emphasizes\n\nspecial education and related services designed to . . . prepare them for further education,\n\nemployment, and independent living.’” Id. (quoting 20 U.S.C. § 1400(d)(1)(A)) (alteration in\n\noriginal). “A free appropriate public education entitles ‘each child with a disability’ to an\n\n‘individualized education program’ that is tailored to meet his or her unique needs.” Henry v.\n\nDistrict of Columbia, 750 F. Supp. 2d 94, 96 (D.D.C. 2010) (quoting 20 U.S.C. §§\n\n1414(d)(1)(A)–(2)(A)).\n\n       The individualized education program (the “IEP”) is the “primary vehicle” for\n\nimplementing the IDEA. Lesesne ex rel. B.F. v. District of Columbia, 447 F.3d 828, 830 (D.C.\n\nCir. 2006). The IEP is “[p]repared at meetings between a representative of the local school\n\ndistrict, the child’s teacher, the parents or guardians, and, whenever appropriate, the disabled\n\nchild.” Id. It “sets out the child’s present educational performance, establishes annual and short-\n\nterm objectives for improvements in that performance, and describes the specially designed\n\ninstruction and services that will enable the child to meet those objectives.” Id.\n\n       When the parents of a student with a disability are dissatisfied with a school district or\n\nagency’s “identification, evaluation, or educational placement of the child, or the provision of a\n\n\n\n\n                                                  2\n\ffree appropriate public education to such child,” 20 U.S.C. § 1415(b)(6), the IDEA entitles them\n\nto present their arguments in an “impartial due process hearing,” id. § 1415(f). Any party\n\naggrieved by the hearing officer’s determination may bring a civil action in state or federal court.\n\nSee id. § 1415(i)(2). The IDEA also contains a “stay put” provision, which provides that during\n\nthe pendency of any of these proceedings, the student must remain in his or her current\n\neducational placement unless otherwise agreed. See id. § 1415(j).\n\n                                     B. Factual Background\n\n       Q.C-C. is a minor living in the District of Columbia with her parents, who adopted her\n\nfrom Guatemala when she was an infant. See AR 379. Q.C-C. has been diagnosed with\n\nAttention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (“ADHD”), a phonological disorder, Mixed Receptive-\n\nExpressive Language Disorder, a reading disorder, and a disorder of written expression. See AR\n\n384; AR 750.\n\n       From kindergarten through the fourth grade, Q.C-C. attended Oyster-Adams Bilingual\n\nSchool (“Oyster-Adams”), a public school within the DCPS system. See AR 383; AR 750. In\n\nMarch and April 2010, while Q.C-C. was in the third grade at Oyster-Adams, DCPS conducted a\n\npsychological evaluation of Q.C-C. and determined that she was eligible for special education\n\nand related services pursuant to the IDEA as a student with a disability classification of “Other\n\nHealth Impairment.” See AR 262; AR 750–51. As a result, Q.C-C. received some limited\n\nadditional support during the remainder of the school year. See AR 751. Q.C-C.’s fourth grade\n\nyear at Oyster-Adams, the 2010–2011 school year, was “rough” for her both academically and\n\nsocially. AR 751. She struggled in all but one of her classes, was bullied, and lost friends and\n\nself-esteem. See id.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\f       Q.C-C.’s parents, concerned about her difficulties in fourth grade, engaged the services of\n\na special education consultant, Dr. Laura Solomon. See id.; Tr. Day 1 at 37:8–22, ECF No. 8-8;\n\nAR 261–75 (Diagnostic Educational Evaluation by Dr. Solomon dated Feb. 13, 2011). In\n\nFebruary 2011, Dr. Solomon observed Q.C-C. in classes at Oyster-Adams, reviewed her\n\neducational records, conducted tests, and interviewed her parents. See AR 263–74; AR 751. Dr.\n\nSolomon concluded that Q.C-C. “requires a more intensive program than she is currently\n\nreceiving.” AR 274; see also AR 751. Noting that Q.C-C. had ADHD, “significant dyslexia”\n\nand “multiple” other learning disabilities, Dr. Solomon opined that Q.C-C. needed, among other\n\nthings, classes with a smaller teacher-to-student ratio, counseling, and intervention from an\n\noccupational therapist and a speech language pathologist, along with systematic instruction in\n\nstrategies for attention and executive functioning. AR 274; see also AR 751. Dr. Solomon\n\nrecommended that Q.C-C.’s parents consider two schools for Q.C-C., one of which was The Lab\n\nSchool of Washington (“Lab”), a private full-time special education day school. See AR 274;\n\nAR 751.\n\n       Following Dr. Solomon’s recommendation, Q.C-C.’s parents unilaterally enrolled Q.C-C.\n\nat Lab for the 2011–2012 school year, Q.C-C.’s fifth grade year. See AR 751. In January 2012,\n\nQ.C-C.’s parents filed a due process complaint against DCPS alleging violations of the IDEA\n\nand, in June 2012, a hearing officer determined that DCPS denied Q.C-C. a FAPE by failing to\n\ninvite Q.C-C.’s parents to an IEP meeting in January 2012, by developing an IEP that was not\n\nindividually tailored to meet Q.C-C.’s needs, and by failing to provide an appropriate educational\n\nplacement for the second half of the 2011–2012 school year. See AR 39–74 (Hearing Officer\n\nDetermination dated June 28, 2012). Finding that Lab was “appropriate” under the IDEA, the\n\nhearing officer ordered DCPS to reimburse Q.C-C.’s parents for all costs of Q.C-C.’s attendance\n\n\n\n\n                                                 4\n\fat Lab from January 31, 2012 through August 31, 2012. 2 See AR 71. Q.C-C. has continued her\n\neducation at Lab since the 2011–2012 school year with DCPS continuing to fund her placement.\n\nSee AR 751.\n\n       In October 2013, during Q.C-C.’s seventh grade year at Lab, Q.C-C.’s parents filed\n\nanother due process complaint against DCPS, claiming that, despite DCPS’s continued funding\n\nof Q.C-C.’s placement at Lab, DCPS had failed to propose a program or placement for Q.C-C.\n\nSee AR 752. Q.C-C.’s parents and DCPS settled that complaint in December 2013. See id.; AR\n\n550–52 (settlement agreement signed Dec. 5, 2013). As part of the settlement, DCPS agreed to\n\ncontinue paying for Q.C-C.’s placement at Lab through June 19, 2014, evaluate Q.C-C., review\n\nand revise her IEP at a meeting before June 19, 2014, and determine a location of service\n\nfollowing the meeting. See AR 551. Q.C-C.’s parents agreed to visit the proposed location of\n\nservice and retained the right to challenge the proposed IEP and placement. See id.\n\n       Pursuant to the settlement, DCPS conducted several reviews and evaluations in April and\n\nMay of 2014. In April 2014, a DCPS school psychologist conducted an evaluation by reviewing\n\nQ.C-C.’s school records, observing Q.C-C. in class for 35 minutes, and interviewing one of Q.C-\n\nC.’s teachers and prepared a report which recommended that Q.C-C. continue to be considered\n\neligible for special education services under the “Other Health Impairment” designation. See AR\n\n554–60. A DCPS speech language pathologist, Judith Edgehill, also conducted an assessment by\n\nreviewing records, including test results and questionnaire responses by Q.C-C.’s teachers,\n\n\n\n2\n        The hearing officer declined Q.C-C.’s parents’ request for reimbursement for the entirety\nof the 2011–2012 school year, finding that they failed to prove that DCPS denied Q.C-C. a\nFAPE, or failed to make a FAPE available, during the fall of 2011. See AR 71. The Court also\nnotes that in the separate Hearing Officer Decision appealed here, the Hearing Officer incorrectly\nstated that the hearing officer in 2012 ordered DCPS to reimburse Q.C-C.’s parents “from\nJanuary 21, 2010 through the end of SY 2011–2012.” AR 751.\n\n\n                                                5\n\fobserving Q.C-C. in one class, and concluded that Q.C-C. did not have a distinct Speech and/or\n\nLanguage Impairment as a “primary disabling condition” but that DCPS should consider whether\n\nQ.C-C. was eligible to receive “oral communication related services.” AR 561–79 (emphasis\n\nomitted). A DCPS occupational therapist conducted an assessment by reviewing records,\n\nobserving Q.C-C. in class, and conducting interviews and concluded that Q.C-C.’s “decreased\n\nmuscle tone, endurance and postural stability . . . . combined with inattentiveness and ineffective\n\nsensory processing affect her ability to keep pace and fully engage in daily activities.” AR 580–\n\n88. A DCPS social worker also prepared a report based on records, a 35-minute classroom\n\nobservation, and interviews and concluded that Q.C-C. “is a vulnerable child who requires\n\nsignificant supports to be successful in accessing her academic program and maintaining\n\nemotional stability.” AR 589–96. Alexandra Lemus, Q.C-C.’s fourth-grade special education\n\nreading teacher from Oyster-Adams, also observed Q.C-C. for 30 minutes during one of her\n\nclasses at Lab. See AR 622; AR 753; Tr. Day 2 at 48:20–52:14, ECF No. 8-9.\n\n       On April 7, 2014, Lab held an annual meeting to discuss Q.C-C.’s progress and need for\n\nsupport and to revise the IEP for her continued education at Lab. See AR 327; AR 752–53.\n\nDCPS was invited to this meeting but did not attend. See AR 752. The 2014 Lab IEP called for\n\n31.25 hours of specialized instruction and 3.75 hours of related services per week, which\n\nincluded individual and group speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, and\n\npsychological treatment. See AR 327; AR 752–53.\n\n       On June 2, 2014, a DCPS team, which included Ms. Lemus, convened an IEP meeting at\n\nOyster-Adams with Q.C-C.’s parents and staff from Lab, and DCPS ultimately drafted a new\n\nproposed IEP. See AR 409; AR 421–39 (DCPS IEP dated June 2, 2014); AR 753. DCPS cited\n\nthe 2014 Lab IEP throughout its IEP, including, for example, the Lab IEP’s statement that Q.C-\n\n\n\n\n                                                 6\n\fC. “struggles to interact with her peers and has some social skills difficulties” and that “[t]his\n\nimpacts her overall self-esteem which in turn impacts her ability to function in the general\n\neducation curriculum,” AR 432, and the Lab staff agreed with the goals set forth in the DCPS\n\nIEP, see AR 754.\n\n       A sharp disagreement, however, emerged between DCPS and Q.C-C.’s parents and the\n\nLab staff regarding the amount of special education that Q.C-C. requires. See AR 753 (“There is\n\njust simply a disagreement between DCPS and [Lab] and the student’s parents about what it\n\ntakes to educate the student.”). In stark contrast with the Lab IEP, DCPS prescribed only five\n\nhours of specialized instruction per week with only one of those hours outside the general\n\neducation, as well as various related services in occupational therapy, behavioral support, and\n\nspeech and language pathology with some of those services taking place outside the general\n\neducation setting. See AR 436; AR 753. DCPS justified this proposal by determining that “the\n\nprevious DCPS IEP hours remained appropriate,” because Q.C-C. made adequate progress at\n\nOyster-Adams four years earlier. AR 641; see also AR 648–49 (“The IEP Team felt that [Q.C-\n\nC.] needs 5 hours of service, as she had on her IEP when she was last at Oyster-Adams Bilingual\n\nSchool because [Q.C-C.] made over two years of progress in Reading that year, and she is\n\nAverage on the Woodcock Johnson Tests of Achievement in Reading and Math. The lawyer for\n\nthe family disagreed and argued that [Q.C-C.] needs a full time placement. The IEP with 5 hours\n\nwas developed by the IEP Team at Oyster-Adams Bilingual School.”).\n\n       Three days after the DCPS IEP meeting, DCPS informed Q.C-C.’s parents by letter that\n\nDCPS had selected Alice Deal Middle School (“Deal”), a public school within the DCPS system,\n\nas the location of services for implementing the IEP. See AR 650–51. On June 12, 2014, Q.C-\n\nC.’s parents, through counsel, formally notified DCPS that they disagreed with and rejected\n\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n\fDCPS’s IEP, stating that Q.C-C. “requires significantly more special education services than\n\nproposed by the DCPS IEP team,” and stating their intention to maintain Q.C-C.’s placement at\n\nLab and seek “ongoing public funding for that placement.” AR 652. Pursuant to the December\n\n2013 settlement, Q.C-C.’s parents also visited Deal and met with the school’s assistant principal\n\nto discuss how Q.C-C.’s IEP would be implemented. See Tr. Day 1 at 183:7–184:7. Based on\n\ntheir observations and conversations with Deal’s assistant principal, Q.C-C.’s parents found Deal\n\nto be inappropriate for Q.C-C. for a variety of reasons, including the apparent lack of a special\n\neducation teacher outside math and reading, the large school size, and the lack of support for\n\nQ.C-C.’s difficulties with “executive functioning.” See id. at 184:1–16; id. at 189:3–190:13.\n\n          C. Administrative Proceeding and the Hearing Officer’s Determination\n\n       On August 25, 2014, Plaintiffs filed a due process complaint against DCPS, claiming that\n\nDCPS denied Q.C-C. a FAPE in two separate ways: first, by failing to propose an appropriate\n\nIEP, specifically by proposing an insufficient amount of specialized instruction; and second, by\n\nfailing to provide Q.C-C.’s parents with “meaningful participation in the IEP process” by\n\nunilaterally selecting Deal as the location of service. AR 4–11. Plaintiffs did not challenge the\n\ngoals contained in the IEP or any components of the IEP other than the prescribed amount of\n\nspecialized instruction outside general education. See AR 750 n.5. As a remedy, Plaintiffs\n\nsought, in part, an order requiring DCPS to continue to fund Q.C-C.’s placement at Lab. The\n\nHearing Officer ordered DCPS to continue to fund Q.C-C.’s placement at Lab during the\n\npendency of the complaint process pursuant to the “stay put” provision of the IDEA. See Order\n\non Motion for Stay Put Protections, AR 242– 48.\n\n       A hearing on the due process complaint was held on December 4 and December 5 of\n\n2014 before Hearing Officer Coles B. Ruff. See AR 747. At the hearing, Plaintiffs presented\n\n\n\n\n                                                 8\n\ftestimony from their educational consultant, Dr. Solomon, designated as an expert in “special\n\neducation programming and placement,” as well as one of Q.C-C.’s parents and three Deal staff\n\nmembers, all of whom were designated as experts in their respective fields of speech language\n\npathology, occupational therapy, and “special education programming and placement.” AR 768.\n\nDCPS presented testimony from an expert speech language pathologist, Ms. Lemus, and the\n\nassistant principal of Deal. See AR 768–69. The Hearing Officer issued his determination on\n\nDecember 25, 2014. See AR 747–70. 3\n\n       With respect to the first issue presented, the Hearing Officer concluded that DCPS denied\n\nQ.C-C. a FAPE by failing to propose an appropriate program or placement. See AR 760. In\n\nreaching this conclusion, he stated that “[t]he overwhelming evidence demonstrates, despite\n\nDCPS witnesses’ testimony to the contrary,” that Q.C-C. has a wide variety of health concerns\n\nthat “impact her significantly throughout all classes.” AR 762. He found that the Lab staff\n\n\n\n3\n         On December 26, 2014, the Hearing Officer issued a second version of his determination\nthat maintained the December 25, 2014 issuance date, informing the parties that the second\nversion contained “typographical corrections” and that “[n]o substantive changes ha[d] been\nmade.” AR 770; see AR 747–69 (corrected Hearing Officer Determination). The parties did not\nalert the Court to the two different versions of the determination in their briefs, and, though the\nDistrict cites the corrected version of the determination, Plaintiffs incorrectly cite the original,\nsuperseded version throughout their briefs. See, e.g., Mem. Supp. Pls.’ Mot. Summ J. at 2 n.1,\nECF No. 9 (citing AR 722–44). The Court also observes that despite the Hearing Officer’s\nstatement to the parties, the changes appear to have been more than simply “typographical.”\nMost notably, an entire paragraph of the Hearing Officer’s findings of fact was removed from the\ncorrected version. Compare AR 727 ¶ 14 with AR 752 ¶ 14. Though the Hearing Officer\nneither specifically informed the parties of this change nor provided an explanation for it, the\nCourt observes that, in the original version, the removed paragraph was repeated, but phrased\ndifferently, as a separate paragraph later in the opinion. Compare AR 727 ¶ 14 with AR 729 ¶\n20. In the corrected version, the latter paragraph was retained, though with a different paragraph\nnumber. See AR 753 ¶ 19. The removal of the paragraph (and the other changes) did not have a\nsubstantive impact on the Hearing Officer’s analysis, and none of the changes substantively\naffect the Court’s analysis here either. Nevertheless, when hearing officers make such changes\nto their decisions, it is appropriate for them to fully inform the parties on the record of the\nchanges to avoid creating unnecessary confusion for the parties and the courts.\n\n\n                                                 9\n\fmembers “credibly testified that [Q.C-C.] benefits from the level of intervention and low student\n\nto teacher ratio the student has at [Lab].” Id. As to DCPS’s IEP, he stated:\n\n               The Hearing Officer is incredulous that DCPS would base the\n               amount of specialized instruction in the student’s current IEP on the\n               amount of services that she received nearly four years prior rather\n               than taking into account that [sic] the student’s current instructional\n               performance and crafting an individualied [sic] education program\n               that meets the student’s needs where she is operating currently.\n\nAR 762. He further found that “there was credible testimony that the extensive goals that are in\n\nthe student’s DCPS IEP that [Lab] helped draft cannot be implemented in the scant number of\n\nhours of specialized instruction in the DCPS IEP as it was drafted on June 2, 2014.” AR 763.\n\n       Though the Hearing Officer found, based on “overwhelming evidence,” that Plaintiffs\n\nhad established that DCPS denied Q.C-C. a FAPE by providing an insufficient number of hours\n\nof specialized instruction in her IEP, he nonetheless declined to order the equitable remedy that\n\nPlaintiffs sought: prospective placement at Lab. See AR 762–64. Instead, he struck a middle\n\nground and chose to amend Q.C-C.’s IEP to prescribe “at least 25 hours of specailized [sic]\n\nisntruction [sic] outside general education per week.” AR 763. The Hearing Officer justified\n\nthis result by stating that he was “not convinced that [Q.C-C.] must be totally removed from her\n\nnon-disabled peers and that a separate school is the student’s least restrictive environment on the\n\ncontinuum of placements.” AR 763–64. He reached this determination by considering two\n\npieces of evidence: first, testimony concerning Q.C-C.’s physical education class at Lab; and\n\nsecond, Q.C-C.’s parent’s testimony concerning Q.C-C.’s interaction with non-disabled peers in\n\nextracurricular activities. See id.\n\n       The Hearing Officer ruled for DCPS on the second issue raised by Plaintiffs and\n\nconcluded that Plaintiffs did not prove by a preponderance of the evidence that DCPS also\n\n\n\n\n                                                 10\n\fdenied Q.C-C. a FAPE by failing to provide Q.C-C.’s parents with meaningful participation in\n\nthe IEP process. See AR 764.\n\n        Plaintiffs timely instituted this action pursuant to the IDEA, challenging the Hearing\n\nOfficer’s determination in part, in March 2015. 4 See Compl., ECF No. 5. The Complaint\n\nrequests as relief: (1) judgment for Plaintiffs and against the District; (2) a declaration that the\n\nDistrict violated Plaintiffs’ rights; (3) an order directing the District to reimburse Plaintiffs for\n\nthe tuition expenses and costs incurred in enrolling Q.C-C. at Lab during the 2014–2015 school\n\nyear; (4) an order directing the District to place and fund Q.C-C. at Lab; (5) an order directing\n\nthe District to pay Plaintiffs’ reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs; and (6) any other relief that the\n\nCourt deems just. See id. at 9–10.\n\n\n                                  III. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n        Following an administrative proceeding under the IDEA, any party that is “aggrieved by\n\nthe findings and decision” of the hearing officer may bring a civil action in federal court. 20\n\nU.S.C. § 1415(i)(2). The IDEA provides that the reviewing court “(i) shall receive the records of\n\nthe administrative proceedings; (ii) shall hear additional evidence at the request of a party; and\n\n(iii) basing its decision on the preponderance of the evidence, shall grant such relief as the court\n\ndetermines is appropriate.” Id. § 1415(i)(2)(C); see also 34 C.F.R. § 300.516(c). The IDEA\n\ngives courts “broad discretion” to fashion remedies for IDEA violations. Florence Cnty. Sch.\n\n\n\n4\n       Plaintiffs’ Complaint does not challenge the Hearing Officer’s determination on the\nsecond claim asserted in their original due process complaint. The Complaint delineates three\ncounts: Count I for failure to provide a FAPE, Count II for failure to develop an appropriate IEP,\nand Count III for failure of the Hearing Officer to render a proper decision. See Compl. at 8–9.\nThe parties, however, do not address these counts in their summary judgment motions, briefing,\nor proposed orders or otherwise suggest that these are brought as distinct causes of action. The\nCourt will likewise consider these counts collectively.\n\n\n                                                  11\n\fDist. Four v. Carter By & Through Carter, 510 U.S. 7, 16 (1993); accord Boose v. District of\n\nColumbia, 786 F.3d 1054, 1056 (D.C. Cir. 2015).\n\n       In a civil action challenging a hearing officer’s determination under the IDEA, “[a]\n\nmotion for summary judgment operates as a motion for judgment based on the evidence\n\ncomprising the record and any additional evidence the Court may receive.” D.R. ex rel.\n\nRobinson v. District of Columbia, 637 F. Supp. 2d 11, 16 (D.D.C. 2009). Where, as here, neither\n\nparty submits additional evidence for the court’s review, “the motion for summary judgment is\n\nsimply the procedural vehicle for asking the judge to decide the case on the basis of the\n\nadministrative record.” Heather S. v. Wisconsin, 125 F.3d 1045, 1052 (7th Cir. 1997); accord\n\nSavoy v. District of Columbia, 844 F. Supp. 2d 23, 30 (D.D.C. 2012); see also G.G. ex rel.\n\nGersten v. District of Columbia, 924 F. Supp. 2d 273, 277–78 (D.D.C. 2013) (“[R]ather than\n\napplying the typical standard applicable to a summary judgment motion . . . the court in an IDEA\n\ncase conducts a summary adjudication.”).\n\n       The D.C. Circuit has explained that, given the court’s power to hear new evidence and to\n\nbase its decision on a preponderance of the evidence standard, the “IDEA plainly suggests less\n\ndeference than is conventional in administrative proceedings.” Reid ex rel. Reid v. District of\n\nColumbia, 401 F.3d 516, 521 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (quoting Kerkam v. McKenzie, 862 F.2d 884, 887\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1989)) (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted); see also id. (“[J]udicial\n\nreview under [the] IDEA is more rigorous than in typical agency cases . . . .”). Courts must\n\nafford “due weight” to the state administrative proceedings and avoid “substitut[ing] their own\n\nnotions of sound educational policy for those of the school authorities they review.” Bd. of\n\nEduc. Hendrick Hudson Cent. Sch. Dist. v. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176, 206 (1982). And, “a court\n\n\n\n\n                                                 12\n\fupsetting the [hearing] officer’s decision must at least explain its basis for doing so.” Reid, 401\n\nF.3d at 521 (citation omitted).\n\n       At the same time, however, “a hearing decision ‘without reasoned and specific findings\n\ndeserves little deference.’” Id. (quoting Kerkam, 931 F.2d at 87); see also M.O. v. District of\n\nColumbia, 20 F. Supp. 3d 31, 40 (D.D.C. 2013) (“[W]hile a certain amount of deference should\n\nbe accorded to the knowledge and expertise of the hearing officer, courts will accord less\n\ndeference if the hearing officer’s determination lacks reasoned and specific findings.”).\n\nMoreover, “[a] court is obligated by the IDEA to ensure that [the] relief set forth in the\n\nadministrative award was appropriate” and the court “may not simply rely on the Hearing\n\nOfficer’s exercise of discretion.” Turner v. District of Columbia, 952 F. Supp. 2d 31, 36 (D.D.C.\n\n2013) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). The party challenging the hearing\n\nofficer’s decision “take[s] on the burden of persuading the court that the hearing officer was\n\nwrong.” Id. at 35 (internal quotation omitted). 5\n\n\n\n\n5\n        In their summary judgment briefing, the parties debate the meaning of two non-binding\ndecisions from outside this Circuit concerning the applicable standard of review. The first is\nDoyle v. Arlington County School Board, in which the Fourth Circuit afforded no weight to a\nreviewing state officer’s reasoning that was “so far from the accepted norm of a fact-finding\nprocess designed to discover truth” and stated that “findings of fact by the hearing officers . . .\nare entitled to be considered prima facie correct, akin to the traditional sense of permitting a\nresult to be based on such fact-finding, but not requiring it.” 953 F.2d 100, 104–05 (4th Cir.\n1991). The second case is Teague Independent School District v. Todd L., in which the Fifth\nCircuit acknowledged the need for courts to give “due weight” but “explicitly adopt[ed] the view\nthat the district court’s review of the hearing officer’s decision is virtually de novo[.]” 999 F.2d\n127, 130–31 (5th Cir. 1993). The Court need not offer an opinion here on these courts’\nformulations of the standard of review, because the law in this Circuit as to the proper standard\nof review is clear and well-established. The Court does not take a position as to whether Doyle\nor Teague conflict with the law in this Circuit.\n\n\n                                                    13\n\f                                        IV. ANALYSIS\n\n       The Court first clarifies the issues before it and the proper standard for consideration of\n\nwhether to award a prospective placement, before turning to its review of the Hearing Officer’s\n\ndetermination and analysis of the record.\n\n                               A. Issues Presented and Disputed\n\n       The Court begins by identifying the issues presented in this action.\n\n       Though Plaintiffs argue as a section heading in their motion for summary judgment that\n\n“The Court Must Make an Independent Determination of Whether DCPS Provided Q.C-C. With\n\na FAPE,” they simultaneously assert that the “sole issue here is the appropriateness of the\n\nHearing Officer’s award” and that the “Hearing Officer’s findings and conclusions as to the\n\ninappropriateness of Q.C-C.’s program and placement are not before this Court and therefore\n\nshould not be disturbed.” Mem. Supp. Pls.’ Mot. Summ J. (“Pls.’ Mem. Supp.”) at 8–10, ECF\n\nNo. 9. The District similarly makes clear (and, in the Court’s view, for good reason) that it does\n\nnot challenge the Hearing Officer’s conclusion that DCPS denied Q.C-C. a FAPE “when it\n\noffered an inadequate educational placement.” 6 Def.’s Mem. P. & A. Supp. Def.’s Opp’n Pls.’\n\nMot. Summ. J. & Def.’s Cross-Mot. Summ. J. (“Def.’s Mem. Supp.”) at 4, ECF No. 11. The\n\nCourt will therefore leave the Hearing Officer’s determination that DCPS denied Q.C-C. a FAPE\n\n\n\n\n6\n        The District’s description of the Hearing Officer’s conclusion is imprecise. Though the\nHearing Officer stated that Plaintiffs had proven that DCPS denied QCC a FAPE by “failing to\npropose an appropriate program or placement,” the remainder of the decision indicates that his\nfocus was on DCPS’s IEP, rather than the proposed placement at Deal, though even this is less\nthan clear as the Hearing Officer did not discuss the adequacy of Deal. See, e.g., AR 763\n(concluding that “the IEP DCPS developed was not reasonably calculated to provide the student\neducational benefit at the time it was developed and based upon the information available to the\nIEP team on June, 2014”); AR 764 (ordering DCPS to meet with Plaintiffs and “make a\ndetermination regarding the student’s educational placement and location of services”).\n\n\n                                                14\n\fintact and proceed on that basis, limiting its analysis in this case to the appropriateness of the\n\nHearing Officer’s equitable remedies for the now-uncontested violation of the IDEA.\n\n        Plaintiffs’ Complaint seeks an order requiring the District “to reimburse plaintiffs for the\n\ntuition expenses and costs incurred in enrolling Q.C-C. at The Lab School of Washington for the\n\n2014–2015 school year” and an order directing the District to “place and fund” Q.C-C. at Lab.\n\nCompl. at 10. The District argues that the claim for reimbursement is not before the Court\n\nbecause it was neither presented to the Hearing Officer nor addressed in the Hearing Officer’s\n\ndetermination and, even if it was presented or addressed, the issue is now moot.\n\n        “[A] party must pursue all administrative avenues of redress” under the IDEA before\n\nseeking judicial review. Cox v. Jenkins, 878 F.2d 414, 419 (D.C. Cir. 1989). “To excuse a\n\nfailure to exhaust the plaintiff must demonstrate the futility or inadequacy of the administrative\n\nprocess.” Douglas v. District of Columbia, 65 F. Supp. 3d 225, 228 (D.D.C. 2014) (citation\n\nomitted). Even if the claim has been first pursued through administrative channels, “the\n\nmootness doctrine prohibits [the Court] from deciding a case if ‘events have so transpired that\n\nthe decision will neither presently affect the parties’ rights nor have a more than speculative\n\nchance of affecting them in the future.’” District of Columbia v. Doe, 611 F.3d 888, 894 (D.C.\n\nCir. 2010) (quoting Clarke v. United States, 915 F.2d 699, 701 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (en banc)).\n\n        As a preliminary matter, the Court observes that Plaintiffs do not address the District’s\n\nadministrative exhaustion and mootness arguments in their joint reply and opposition brief and,\n\nin fact, do not even reference, let alone reiterate, their request for reimbursement in that brief. 7\n\nSee Pls.’ Opp’n Def.’s Cross-Mot. Summ. J. & Reply Def.’s Opp’n Pls.’ Mot. Summ. J. (“Pls.’\n\n\n7\n        Plaintiffs do, however, discuss the applicability of the standard for ordering\nreimbursement to the determination of whether to award a prospective placement. That separate\nissue is discussed, infra.\n\n\n                                                  15\n\fReply”), ECF No. 13. “It is well understood in this Circuit that when a plaintiff files an\n\nopposition to a motion to dismiss addressing only certain arguments raised by the defendant, a\n\ncourt may treat those arguments that the plaintiff failed to address as conceded.” Hopkins v.\n\nWomen’s Div., Gen. Bd. of Global Ministries, 238 F. Supp. 2d 174, 178 (D.D.C. 2002) (citing\n\nFDIC v. Bender, 127 F.3d 58, 67–68 (D.C. Cir. 1997); Stephenson v. Cox, 223 F. Supp. 2d 119,\n\n121 (D.D.C. 2002)).\n\n       Nevertheless, the District appears to be only partially correct. Plaintiffs’ claim and\n\nrequest at the administrative level for “funding” Q.C-C.’s placement at Lab, e.g., AR 9, can be\n\nconstrued as inclusive of a claim for reimbursement, and the Court therefore finds that Plaintiffs\n\ndid not fail to exhaust their administrative remedies with respect to reimbursement. See K.B. v.\n\nDistrict of Columbia, No. 13-0649, 2015 WL 5191330, at *8 (D.D.C. Sept. 4, 2015) (construing\n\nrequest for “fund[ing]” to include request for reimbursement despite absence of the phrase\n\n“tuition reimbursement”). The record is clear, however, that DCPS was ordered to continue\n\nfunding Q.C-C.’s placement at Lab during the pendency of the administrative proceeding, see\n\nAR 242– 48, and Plaintiffs do not contest the District’s statement that DCPS has continued to\n\nfund Q.C-C.’s placement at Lab during the pendency of this action. Therefore, the Court finds\n\nthat any claim for reimbursement is moot, and the Court considers only Plaintiffs’ request for\n\nprospective placement at Lab. 8\n\n\n\n\n8\n         In cursory fashion at the end of their joint opposition and opening summary judgment\nbrief, the District also argues that Plaintiffs’ request for prospective placement and funding is\nalso “an inappropriate attempt to get around administrative exhaustion remedies,” because “[t]he\ndistrict court does not have authority to address school years that have not first been addressed in\nan administrative hearing.” Def.’s Mem. Supp. at 11–12. The District offers no further\nreasoning or detail for this argument, apart from an unexplained citation to Pinto v. District of\nColumbia, 69 F. Supp. 3d 275 (D.D.C. 2014), and the District does not raise the argument again\nin their reply brief. “It is not enough merely to mention a possible argument in the most skeletal\n\n\n                                                16\n\f                     B. Standard for Considering Prospective Placement\n\n       Before reviewing the Hearing Officer’s determination to not award Plaintiffs’ requested\n\nrelief of placement at Lab and making its own assessment, it is necessary for the Court to first set\n\nforth the standard by which a court or hearing officer should determine whether to award a\n\nprospective placement. It is particularly important to do so here, in which Plaintiffs, the District,\n\nand the Hearing Officer have offered conflicting standards.\n\n       The IDEA requires the Court to “grant such relief as the court determines is appropriate,”\n\n20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(C)(iii), and “the court enjoys ‘broad discretion’” in fashioning equitable\n\nrelief under this provision, Florence, 510 U.S. at 16 (quoting Sch. Comm. of Burlington v. Dep’t\n\nof Ed. of Mass., 471 U.S. 359, 369 (1985)). This includes the discretion to order prospective\n\nrelief in the form of awarding placement at a private school “aimed at ensuring that the child\n\nreceives tomorrow the education required by the IDEA.” Branham v. Gov’t of the Dist. of\n\nColumbia, 427 F.3d 7, 11 (D.C. Cir. 2005). The Supreme Court has stated that, in fashioning\n\ndiscretionary equitable relief, courts “must consider all relevant factors.” Florence, 510 U.S. at\n\n16. In Branham, the D.C. Circuit identified a non-exclusive set of “relevant” factors for courts to\n\nconsider in determining whether to order a particular placement: (1) “the nature and severity of\n\nthe student’s disability”; (2) “the student’s specialized educational needs”; (3) the link between\n\nthose needs and the services offered by the private school”; (4) the cost of the placement; and (5)\n\n“the extent to which the placement represents the least restrictive educational environment.”\n\nBranham, 427 F.3d at 12 (citations omitted). The D.C. Circuit has also affirmed a prospective\n\nplacement award without reference to any particular factors in a case in which the district court\n\n\n\n\nway, leaving the court to do counsel’s work.” Schneider v. Kissinger, 412 F.3d 190, 200 n.1\n(D.C. Cir. 2005) (quoting United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990)).\n\n\n                                                 17\n\ffound that the placement was “the best . . . offered by either DCPS or the parents” and was,\n\ntherefore, “the only program supported by any evidence in the record.” McKenzie v. Smith, 771\n\nF.2d 1527, 1535 (D.C. Cir. 1985).\n\n       In their opening brief in support of their motion for summary judgment, Plaintiffs\n\nrecognized Branham as controlling and stated that “[t]his jurisdiction appears unique in its\n\ndistinction between reimbursement and placement.” Pls.’ Mem. Supp. at 13. In their joint reply\n\nand opposition brief, however, Plaintiffs take a different position, arguing that, following the\n\nD.C. Circuit’s decision in Leggett v. District of Columbia, 793 F.3d 59 (D.C. Cir. 2015), a “new\n\nand more specific standard” applies in which “placement and/or reimbursement at the unilateral\n\nplacement is the appropriate relief” when “no other placement is offered and the parental\n\nplacement meets the Rowley standard.” Pls.’ Reply at 1–3. Plaintiffs further argue that, pursuant\n\nto Leggett, it is not necessary consider the “least restrictive environment.” See id. at 6. The\n\nDistrict, on the other hand, argues that the standard for reimbursement is inapplicable and that\n\nthe least restrictive environment analysis is controlling. See Def.’s Mem. Supp. at 7–9. The\n\nDistrict does not cite Branham or otherwise reference any of its other factors. The District’s\n\nposition is in line with the approach of the Hearing Officer, who ignored Branham and its other\n\nfactors, focusing exclusively on the least restrictive environment factor. See, e.g., AR 763 (“At\n\n[Lab] the student has no interaction with students who do not have a disability. IDEA clearly\n\nmandates that to the greatest extent possible students shall be educated with their non-disabled\n\npeers.”).\n\n       Both sides have missed the mark here. Branham, which provides for consideration of the\n\nleast restrictive environment as a relevant factor, is and remains good law with respect to\n\nordering prospective placement as a discretionary equitable remedy. Plaintiffs misread the D.C.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 18\n\fCircuit’s decision in Leggett as somehow overturning Branham and its factors. Nothing in the\n\nLeggett opinion lends itself to such a dramatic interpretation, and the two cases, along with the\n\nD.C. Circuit’s earlier opinion in McKenzie, can be read harmoniously.\n\n       The D.C. Circuit defined the issue in Leggett as follows: “When a parent chooses,\n\nwithout school officials’ consent, to send her child to a private school, under what circumstances\n\nmust the school district reimburse the parent for the costs of attending that school?” Leggett, 793\n\nF.3d at 62. The Circuit held that, in determining whether to order reimbursement, courts should\n\napply the same standard for determining whether a school district’s IEP is “proper under the\n\nAct”: “a parent’s unilateral private placement is proper under the Act so long as it is ‘reasonably\n\ncalculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits.’” Id. at 71 (quoting Rowley, 458\n\nU.S. at 207). The Circuit held that the parents in that case were entitled to reimbursement\n\nbecause the placement they chose “was the only placement on the record that could have\n\nprovided [the child] with an education that met her identified needs.” Id. at 72.\n\n       The fact that, in Leggett, a case that did not involve prospective placement, the Circuit\n\ndid not reference the Branham factors for prospective placement is unsurprising and certainly\n\ndoes not mean that Branham is no longer good law. On the contrary, the Leggett court actually\n\ncited another portion of Branham in its opinion. See id. at 70 (citing Branham, 427 F.3d at 9).\n\nThe Circuit also cited McKenzie as precedent, which the Circuit also cited in Branham, further\n\nindicating that the three cases can be read together. See id. at 72 (citing McKenzie, 771 F.2d at\n\n1535); Branham, 427 F.3d at 12 (citing McKenzie, 771 F.2d at 1531). Had the Circuit intended\n\nto overrule the prospective placement portion of its opinion in Branham, it would have said so.\n\n       At the same time, the District’s apparent position that reimbursement cases such as\n\nLeggett are wholly irrelevant to the prospective placement analysis is also incorrect. In\n\n\n\n\n                                                19\n\fBranham, most of the cases cited by the D.C. Circuit as support for the prospective placement\n\nfactors concerned only reimbursement. See Branham, 427 F.3d at 12 (citing Carter, 510 U.S. at\n\n16; Holland v. District of Columbia, 71 F.3d 417, 425 (D.C. Cir. 1995); Walczak v. Fla. Union\n\nFree Sch. Dist., 142 F.3d 119, 132 (2d Cir. 1998)). And although Leggett involved only\n\nreimbursement, the D.C. Circuit likened its decision to its prior decision in McKenzie upholding\n\na district court’s order of private placement without drawing a relevant distinction. See Leggett,\n\n793 F.3d at 72 (citing McKenzie, 771 F.2d at 1535). Moreover, the Court notes that the case\n\nprincipally relied on by the District as “remarkably similar” involved only reimbursement.\n\nDef.’s Mem. Supp. at 10 (citing N.T. v. District of Columbia, 839 F. Supp. 2d 29, 35 (D.D.C.\n\n2012)); see N.T., 839 F. Supp. 2d at 30–31 (“The question is whether [DCPS] can provide N.T.\n\nwith a [FAPE] and, if not, to what extent it must reimburse N.T.’s parents for her private school\n\nplacement.”). Though the purposes of each form of relief are distinct, the considerations\n\ninvolved often overlap to some degree.\n\n        The parties, and the Hearing Officer, also misunderstand the proper role of the “least\n\nrestrictive environment” in the analysis. Plaintiffs’ assertion that whether the desired placement\n\nis the least restrictive is irrelevant in light of Leggett is, for the reasons explained, simply\n\nincorrect. The District, like the Hearing Officer, on the other hand, relies almost entirely on the\n\nleast restrictive environment factor to support its argument, and that, too, is incorrect.\n\n        The District cites the Fourth Circuit’s statement that “[m]ainstreaming of handicapped\n\nchildren into regular school programs where they might have opportunities to study and to go\n\nsocialize with nonhandicapped children is not only a laudable goal but is also a requirement of\n\nthe Act.” De Vries v. Fairfax Cty. Sch. Bd., 882 F.2d 876, 878 (4th Cir. 1989). The District fails\n\nto acknowledge, however, the Supreme Court stated in Rowley that “[d]espite this preference for\n\n\n\n\n                                                   20\n\f‘mainstreaming’ handicapped children—educating them with nonhandicapped children—\n\nCongress recognized that regular classrooms simply would not be a suitable setting for the\n\neducation of many handicapped children.” Rowley, 458 U.S. at 181 n.4. For that reason, the\n\nFourth Circuit has also recognized that “mainstreaming is a policy to be pursued so long as it is\n\nconsistent with the Act’s primary goal of providing disabled students with an appropriate\n\neducation” and that “[w]here necessary for educational reasons, mainstreaming assumes a\n\nsubordinate role in formulating an educational program.” Carter By & Through Carter v.\n\nFlorence Cty. Sch. Dist. Four, 950 F.2d 156, 160 (4th Cir. 1991) (citing Rowley, 458 U.S. at 181\n\n& n.4; Daniel R.R. v. State Bd. of Educ., 874 F.2d 1036, 1044–45 (5th Cir. 1989)), aff’d sub nom.\n\nFlorence, 510 U.S. 7. As the court stated in Roark, “‘the key consideration is whether the\n\nplacement is appropriate under the IDEA,’ not whether it is the least restrictive.” Roark ex rel.\n\nRoark v. District of Columbia, 460 F. Supp. 2d 32, 43 (D.D.C. 2006) (quoting Schoenbach v.\n\nDistrict of Columbia, Civ. No. 15-1591, 2006 WL 1663426, at *7 (D.D.C. June 12, 2006)).\n\n       Indeed, the very text of the IDEA clarifies that the least restrictive environment is\n\nrequired “[t]o the maximum extent appropriate” and that special classes and separate schooling\n\nare permitted when “the nature or severity of the disability of a child is such that education in\n\nregular classes with the use of supplementary aids and services cannot be achieved\n\nsatisfactorily.” 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(5)(A). Finally, the District and the Hearing Officer have\n\nfailed to recognize that “the Act’s preference for mainstreaming was aimed at preventing schools\n\nfrom segregating students from the general student body” and was “not meant to restrict parental\n\noptions when the public schools fail to comply with the requirements of the Act.” Carter, 950\n\nF.2d at 160.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 21\n\f       With these standards in mind, the Court reviews the Hearing Officer’s conclusions and\n\nthe administrative record.\n\n        C. Review of the Hearing Officer’s Conclusions and Analysis of the Record\n\n       Turning to the merits of this case, the Court begins by reviewing the Hearing Officer’s\n\ndetermination with respect to the ordered remedy and the reasoning he provided in support in\n\norder to determine how much weight, if any, is “due” with respect to his determination regarding\n\nthe appropriate remedy. Rowley, 458 U.S. at 206. The Court then reviews the record on its own\n\nin light of that determination.\n\n                  1. Deference Afforded to the Hearing Officer’s Determination\n\n       The Court begins with the Hearing Officer’s determination and finds that it is entitled to\n\nlittle, if any, deference on the issue presented, because it was premised on a misunderstanding of\n\nthe law, as discussed, supra, as well as a misunderstanding of the factual record and because it\n\ncontained insufficient reasoning.\n\n       As a preliminary matter, it is difficult to even discern what the Hearing Officer\n\nenvisioned for Q.C-C. when he ordered her IEP to be amended to “prescribe 25 hours per week\n\nof specialized instruction outside general education in addition to the current related services.”\n\nAR 764. In a footnote, the Hearing Officer stated that he arrived at the 25 hours per week figure\n\nby “excluding the number of related service hours prescribed in the student’s IEP from the total\n\nnumber of instructional hours per week that is typically in a DCPS IEP based upon 27.5 hours\n\nper week of instruction.” AR 763 n.18. As Plaintiffs observe (and the District does not address),\n\nthe Hearing Officer did not provide any citation to the record to support his assumption as to the\n\n“typical[]” IEP. See Pls.’ Mem. Supp. at 15 n.3. As Plaintiffs also observe, it is not clear which\n\nclasses Q.C-C. would attend in a mainstream environment under the Hearing Officer’s amended\n\n\n\n\n                                                 22\n\fIEP. See id. at 22 n.4. Plaintiffs assume that “based on his analysis of the PE class and the fact\n\nthat lunch is not typically included in the IEP . . . these are the classes for which she would be in\n\nthe mainstream without support.” Id. The Court agrees with this analysis, particularly in light of\n\nthe District’s failure to offer another interpretation or otherwise address this issue in its briefing.\n\nIn any case, the fact that the parties and the Court are forced to draw such an inference makes\n\nclear that the Hearing Officer did not provide sufficient detail or reasoning in making his\n\ndetermination, thereby entitling the determination to even less deference than under normal\n\ncircumstances.\n\n        The Hearing Officer failed to provide sufficient reasoning in other ways. Inexplicably,\n\nthe Hearing Officer’s determination contains two similar, yet alternate, versions of reasoning for\n\nhis decision to decline to order a prospective placement. See AR 463–64.\n\n        In the first version, the Hearing Officer stated that, although the Lab staff, Plaintiffs’\n\neducational consultant, and one of Q.C-C.’s parents testified that Q.C-C. would be\n\n“overwhelmed” in a general school setting, he “was not convinced by their testimony that the\n\nstudent must be totally removed from her nondisabled peers despite her need for and benefit\n\nfrom specialized instruction in all her classes.” AR 763. While he observed that, at Lab, Q.C-C.\n\n“has no interaction with students who do not have a disability,” he stated, without providing any\n\ncitation to the record or any specifics, that “[t]here is evidence that the student can and does have\n\nsocial interaction with non-disabled peers outside school and in those situations is coached by\n\nher parents on peer interaction and communication.” Id. He also stated that, at Lab, Q.C-C. “is\n\nsometimes in a class with as many as 23 students and it appears that not all the instruction\n\nprovided to [her] is provided by special educaiton [sic] teachers.” Id. He stated that he based his\n\nconclusion on this evidence. See id.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  23\n\f       Immediately following this explanation, the Hearing Officer provided an alternate\n\nversion, completely disconnected from the first version. See AR 763–64. In this second version,\n\nhe cited expert testimony, “among others,” “that [Q.C-C.] requires total removal from general\n\neducation” but stated that he did not find this testimony “convincing.” AR 763. He then stated,\n\nin contrast with the first version, that, at Lab, Q.C-C. “takes physical education with a group as\n\nlarge as 23 students and this instruction is not conducted by special education teacher [sic]” and\n\nnoted that the “IDEA defines special education to include instruction in physical education.” Id.\n\nThe Hearing Officer stated that his conclusion was “[b]ased upon these factors” and did not\n\nmention testimony concerning Q.C-C.’s extracurricular activities.\n\n       The Hearing Officer’s reasoning is not supported by his own findings of fact. His\n\ndiscussion of Q.C-C.’s classes at Lab, which seems to have been the primary justification for his\n\nconclusion, appears to have been referring to the following finding of fact: “At [Lab], the\n\nstudent receives specialized instruction and related services and her classes are instructed by\n\nspecial eudcation [sic] teachers. However, it is unclear whether the student’s drama and physical\n\neducation teachers are special education certified.” AR 757. This factual finding fits neither\n\nversion of his reasoning. In the first version, he stated that “it appears that not all the instruction\n\nprovided to [her] is provided by special educaiton [sic] teachers.” AR 763 (emphasis added).\n\nHis factual finding, however, was that all of Q.C-C.’s teachers were special education teachers,\n\nbut that it was “unclear” whether her physical education and drama teachers were certified in\n\nspecial education. AR 757. The second version, in which he went so far as to state that Q.C-C.’s\n\nphysical education class “is not conducted by special education teacher [sic]” is plainly incorrect.\n\nId. (emphasis added).\n\n\n\n\n                                                  24\n\f       Even if the Hearing Officer had correctly understood his own finding of fact, the actual\n\nfinding of fact does not support his ultimate conclusion. As Plaintiffs note, the IDEA does not\n\ndefine “special education” to include only education by certified special education teachers, but\n\nrather encompasses a broader range of instruction. See 20 U.S.C. § 1401(29) (defining “special\n\neducation” to mean “specially designed instruction . . . designed to meet the unique needs of a\n\nchild with a disability”); see also 34 C.F.R. § 300.39(b)(3) (defining “specially designed\n\ninstruction” without reference to certification); Leggett, 793 F.3d at 63 (quoting 20 U.S.C. §\n\n1401(29)).\n\n       Moreover, the two sources the Hearing Officer cited for his factual finding (without\n\nproviding any explanation) do not provide strong support for the finding or his conclusion. The\n\nHearing Officer cited a Certificate of Approval for Lab approving Lab as a “nonpublic special\n\neducation school program.” AR 496–97. He also cited generally, without any pincite or\n\nquotation, the testimony of Megan Van Dyke, the Associate Head of Lab’s junior high school.\n\nSee AR 757; AR 768. He appears to have relied on the following answer by Ms. Van Dyke\n\nwhen asked whether the physical education and drama classes were taught by “special education\n\ncertified instructors”: “I cannot speak to the PE instructor and the drama teacher, I’m not sure, I\n\ndon’t want to say either way.” Tr. Day 1 at 168:15–19. Ms. Van Dyke also testified, however,\n\nthat Q.C-C.’s physical education class was one in which “we see a lot of the anxiety and [Q.C-\n\nC.’s] struggle to apply strategies and navigate social dynamics which impact her ability to be\n\npresent for instruction.” See id. at 164:14–18. This is, at best, weak support for the Hearing\n\nOfficer’s finding of fact, and it did not warrant significant weight in the analysis.\n\n       The only other evidence relied upon by the Hearing Officer (and only in the first version\n\nof his reasoning)—Q.C-C.’s extracurricular activities—is similarly problematic for his\n\n\n\n\n                                                 25\n\fconclusions. Though the Hearing Officer did not cite any portion of the record in his reasoning,\n\nhe appears to have been referencing the following finding of fact: “The student currently has\n\nexposure to non-disabled students outside of school through the Washington Ethical Society and\n\nGirl Scouts. The student has to be coached on how to deal with her peer interactions and what to\n\nsay.” AR 759. The Hearing Officer did nothing more than paraphrase his finding of fact as his\n\nreasoning, offering no additional detail. The sole source for this finding of fact was the\n\ntestimony of one of Q.C-C.’s parents, who stated that Q.C-C. attends the Washington Ethical\n\nSociety meetings once per week and that there are ten or fewer girls in her Girl Scout troop. See\n\nTr. Day 1 at 185:2–11. Moreover, the Hearing Officer failed to acknowledge or address his own\n\nrelated finding of fact that, even in department stores, Q.C-C. “gets overstimulated” and that\n\n“when the student is having a tough time academically she leaves the classroom and skips class\n\nand this behavior may likely increase in a setting as large as [Deal].” AR 759. And the parent\n\nfurther testified that, not only did both parents need to coach Q.C-C. on her social interactions,\n\nbut that one of them also accompanies her on sleepovers with the Girl Scouts “because she does\n\nhave difficulty with sustained social interaction even in a small group like that.” Id. 185:20–\n\n186:3. The Hearing Officer did not address these issues, let alone explain how this testimony\n\ndemonstrated that, despite significant expert testimony to the contrary, Q.C-C. could handle a\n\ngeneral education setting without her parents.\n\n       For these reasons, the Court finds that the Hearing Officer’s decision is entitled to little\n\ndeference. See Reid, 401 F.3d at 521 (“[A] hearing decision ‘without reasoned and specific\n\nfindings deserves little deference.’” (quoting Kerkam, 931 F.2d at 87)); M.O., 20 F. Supp. 3d at\n\n40 (“[W]hile a certain amount of deference should be accorded to the knowledge and expertise\n\n\n\n\n                                                 26\n\fof the hearing officer, courts will accord less deference if the hearing officer’s determination\n\nlacks reasoned and specific findings.”).\n\n                 2. The Court’s Conclusion Based on the Administrative Record\n\n       The Court concludes, upon its consideration of the entirety of the administrative record\n\nand the parties’ arguments, that the preponderance of the evidence supports a finding that Q.C-C.\n\nrequires full-time specialized instruction throughout the school day and, given that Lab is the\n\nonly potential placement in the record that could satisfy Q.C-C.’s needs, an order directing the\n\nDistrict to fund Q.C-C.’s continued placement at Lab is warranted.\n\n       There is a wealth of evidence in support of Plaintiffs’ position, including substantial\n\nexpert testimony. For example, Ms. Van Dyke, a designated “expert in special education\n\nprogramming and placement,” administrator at Lab, and Q.C-C.’s former social studies teacher,\n\nAR 768, opined that Q.C-C. could not be appropriately educated in a less restrictive setting than\n\nat Lab. See Tr. Day 1 at 165:12–14. She further testified that Q.C-C. “has difficulty\n\ntransitioning into classes and in between tasks” and that she “needs a lot of structure and a lot of\n\nprocessing time.” Id. at 151:18–22. She also testified to the effect of Q.C-C.’s disabilities on her\n\nsocial interactions, stating that Q.C-C. is “socially and emotionally vulnerable.” Id. at 154:10–\n\n11; see also id. at 153:9–13 (stating that Q.C-C. “is often concerned about her peers and social\n\ninteraction” and “was more focused on what other students were doing”); AR 758 (Hearing\n\nOfficer accepting Ms. Van Dyke’s opinion on these issues as fact). As noted, supra, she also\n\ntestified that physical education—by far Q.C-C.’s largest class—presented particularly difficult\n\nissues for Q.C-C. See id. at 164:14–18.\n\n       Ms. Solomon, Plaintiffs’ retained expert in special education who has observed Q.C-C.\n\nevery year since she was in the fourth grade at Oyster-Adams, testified that “there are no areas of\n\n\n\n\n                                                 27\n\facademic skill development, social development, [or] executive and attentional development” in\n\nwhich Q.C-C. does not need specialized instruction and related services. Id. at 47:6–10. Perhaps\n\nmost significantly here, Ms. Solomon further testified that even lunch “is fraught with difficulty\n\nfor [Q.C-C.],” explaining that Q.C-C. “hoards food” and “doesn’t always eat when she’s\n\nsupposed to” and that she “has difficulty with social interactions.” Id. at 65:7–14. Ms. Solomon\n\ntestified that lunch poses a particular problem because it is “less structured.” Id. at 12–14. She\n\nalso testified to Q.C-C.’s need for support with respect to physical education. See id. at 66:21-\n\n67:14. Ms. Solomon also testified that Q.C-C. would have difficulty in a general education\n\nsetting between classes and as the building lets out at the end of the day, because “there’s too\n\nmuch moving around the building” and Q.C-C. has a tendency to “disappear.” See id. at 81:5–\n\n82:13.\n\n         Melissa Wood, Lab’s speech language pathologist, similarly testified to Q.C-C.’s\n\n“struggle[s] with peers in particular” and need for “a significant amount of teacher redirection\n\nand support.” Id. at 96:15–97:7. Judy Shincarick, Lab’s director of occupational therapy, also\n\ntestified to her concerns about Q.C-C. not receiving the necessary “redirection” in a general\n\neducation setting and Q.C-C.’s limited “ability to focus and attend in a large setting.” Id. at\n\n132:9–133:3.\n\n         There is further support provided in the documentary record. For example, an\n\nOccupational Therapy Progress Report dated March 2014 stated that Q.C-C.’s “best effort is\n\ngreatly impacted by her difficulty maintaining attention [to] academic tasks” and that Q.C-C.\n\n“tends to become distracted visually by small objects in her workspace as well as by\n\nconversations by peers around her.” AR 321. Even DCPS’s Psychological Triennial\n\nReevaluation dated April 2014 reported that Q.C-C. “struggles to interact freely and easily with\n\n\n\n\n                                                 28\n\fpeers and can isolate herself at times” and that “[t]hese weaknesses impact and compromise\n\nfunctioning in the general education curriculum” in a variety of ways. See AR 373–74.\n\nSimilarly, DCPS’s Social Work Assessment Report, also dated April 2014, noted Q.C-C.’s\n\n“history of hoarding,” AR 381, and stated that “[d]uring lunch, [Q.C-C.] generally sits alone or\n\nwith her teacher because she does not connect well with her peers,” AR 383. The report\n\nconcluded that Q.C-C. “is a vulnerable child who requires significant supports in place to be\n\nsuccessful in accessing her academic program and maintaining emotional stability.” AR 386.\n\nFinally, it is also notable that, in 2012, a Hearing Officer determined that Q.C-C. “needs full-\n\ntime, specialized instruction outside the general education setting to access the general education\n\ncurriculum.” AR 159.\n\n       The District offers the Court very little evidence in opposition, limiting its argument on\n\nthis issue to essentially one short paragraph of its brief and almost entirely relying on the same\n\nevidence that the Hearing Officer relied on in reaching his determination. See Def.’s Mem.\n\nSupp. at 9–10. The Court has already discussed the Hearing Officer’s flawed and insufficient\n\nconsideration of this evidence in his reasoning, and the District does not offer the Court any\n\nfurther analysis. The District does not, for example, explain how uncertainty regarding the\n\nphysical education teacher’s special education certification—in a school dedicated entirely to\n\nspecial education—shows that Q.C-C. can handle physical education in a general education\n\nsetting. Nor does it explain how Q.C-C.’s after-school participation in Girl Scouts and the\n\nWashington Ethical Society with significant parental support advances its position.\n\n       Instead, the District simply adds that Ms. Van Dyke and Ms. Wood testified that they had\n\nnot observed Q.C-C. in a setting outside of Lab. See id. at 10 (citing Tr. Day 1 at 109:2–4; Tr.\n\nDay 1 at 166:12–14); see also AR 757–58 (Hearing Officer noting the same in his findings of\n\n\n\n\n                                                 29\n\ffact). While this might be a plausible argument for discounting their expert testimony, the\n\nDistrict fails to address Plaintiffs’ other expert witnesses, including Dr. Solomon, who has\n\ncontinually observed Q.C-C. since her time at Oyster-Adams. More importantly, the District\n\ndoes not ask the Court to consider other expert testimony or documentary evidence in opposition\n\nto Plaintiffs’ experts. In fact, as discussed, several of the District’s own expert reports support\n\nPlaintiffs’ experts’ opinions. The District simply fails to offer the Court any real evidentiary\n\nbasis to toss aside the wealth of evidence and expert testimony that support Plaintiffs’ position.\n\n       The District also offers the Court two prior cases as precedent, but each of these cases is\n\nplainly distinguishable from this one, and the distinctions only serve to bolster the Court’s\n\nanalysis.\n\n       The District primarily relies upon Pinto v. District of Columbia, 69 F. Supp. 3d 275\n\n(D.D.C. 2014), in which Magistrate Judge Robinson, 9 in relevant part, upheld a Hearing\n\nOfficer’s decision to decline to award reimbursement to parents who enrolled their child at Lab.\n\nSee Pinto, 69 F. Supp. 3d at 284–86. Despite relying heavily on the case, the District does not\n\nactually offer any comparison of the facts and evidence in that case to this one. Instead, the\n\nDistrict simply states that the Magistrate Judge Robinson’s decision in Pinto to uphold the\n\nHearing Officer’s determination because the plaintiffs in that case “failed to identify an error by\n\nthe Hearing Officer” and the Hearing Officer “considered all of the evidence offered during the\n\nhearing, relied upon the applicable authorities, and clearly articulated his findings” is sufficient\n\nto “support[] affirming the hearing officer’s ruling” in this case. Def.’s Mem. Supp. at 10\n\n(quoting Pinto, 69 F. Supp. 3d at 286). In stark contrast, as the Court has already discussed, in\n\n\n\n9\n      The District erroneously states that the case was decided by Judge Friedman. See Def.’s\nMem. Supp. at 10.\n\n\n                                                 30\n\fthis case, the Hearing Officer committed several errors, including misunderstanding the legal\n\nprecedent concerning prospective placement and his own findings of fact, and he failed to\n\nconsider all of the evidence or adequately articulate his findings. Pinto, therefore, only serves to\n\ndemonstrate the failings of the Hearing Officer in this case.\n\n       The District also relies on N.T. v. District of Columbia, 839 F. Supp. 2d 29 (D.D.C.\n\n2012), in which Judge Collyer also upheld a Hearing Officer’s decision to decline to award\n\nreimbursement to parents who enrolled their child at Lab. In particular, the District quotes the\n\nfollowing statement:\n\n               Although the District must pay for private school placement “[i]f no\n               suitable public school is available[,] . . . if there is an appropriate\n               public school program available . . . the District need not consider\n               private placement, even though a private school might be more\n               appropriate and better able to serve the child.” Jenkins v.\n               Squillacote, 935 F.2d 303, 305 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (citations and\n               quotations omitted).\n\nN.T., 839 F. Supp. 2d at 34 (alterations in original). The District, however, offers the Court no\n\nexplanation as to how this rule, or Judge Collyer’s application of it in N.T., applies to the\n\nevidence in this case. In fact, the distinctions between N.T. and this case are striking. First, in\n\nN.T., Judge Collyer stated that “the parents have not even argued, let alone demonstrated” that\n\nthe selected DCPS public school could not provide their child with an appropriate education. Id.\n\nBy contrast, as the Court has detailed, Q.C-C.’s parents have provided a wealth of evidence in\n\nsupport of their claim that Q.C-C. requires full-time specialized instruction, while the District has\n\noffered virtually none to the Court and has not suggested any alternative public school that might\n\nbe appropriate. Second, in N.T., the parents’ “educational consultant admitted that with\n\nsubstantial intervention, [the child] was able to make educational progress in an inclusive\n\nsetting” and the “written reports at [the public school] confirm this.” Id. at 35. Here, of course,\n\nPlaintiffs’ educational consultant, along with several other expert witnesses, testified that Q.C-C.\n\n\n                                                 31\n\fneeds the full-time support of Lab, and their opinions are supported by documentary evidence.\n\nThird, and finally, in N.T., the parents focused on “extolling the virtues of The Lab School,”\n\nrather than whether their child could receive a FAPE at a public school. Id. Here, Plaintiffs’\n\nwitnesses and evidence focused not only on Q.C-C.’s progress at Lab, but also her inability to\n\nreceive a FAPE in a general education setting.\n\n       The Court next considers the Branham factors to determine whether prospective\n\nplacement at Lab is the appropriate remedy. The first through third factors, which concern the\n\n“nature and severity” of Q.C-C.’s disability, her “specialized educational needs,” and the “link\n\nbetween those needs and the services offered” by Lab, Branham, 427 F.3d at 12, counsel in favor\n\nof prospective placement. As the Court has detailed, the administrative record—as well as the\n\nHearing Officer’s own findings of fact—make clear that Q.C-C. suffers from significant\n\ndisabilities that affect all facets of her education. Even with the significant amount of specialized\n\ninstruction and related support ordered by the Hearing Officer, it appears that Q.C-C. would still\n\nbe required to have at least lunch and physical education in a large general education setting, and\n\nshe would undoubtedly be required to navigate hallways and have other non-structured\n\ninteractions with nondisabled peers. The evidence, including expert testimony, demonstrates that\n\nQ.C-C. would face potentially insurmountable difficulties if the Hearing Officer’s proposed IEP\n\nwere to be implemented. At Lab, on the other hand, Q.C-C. is able to make progress in a\n\ncontrolled environment that is sensitive to her unique needs. The District presents no argument\n\nwith respect to the fourth Branham factor, which concerns the cost of placement at Lab, nor did\n\nthey present one before the Hearing Officer. 10\n\n\n\n\n10\n        The Court also notes that the District has been funding QCC’s placement at Lab for\nseveral years and that the District has funded several other students at Lab. See Day 1 Tr. at\n\n\n                                                  32\n\f       The final Branham factor—the extent to which placement at Lab represents the least\n\nrestrictive environment—is obviously the strongest point of contention between the parties.\n\nFirst, as the Court discussed, supra, this factor is of less importance than the IDEA’s “primary\n\ngoal of providing disabled students with an appropriate education,” particularly where, as here, it\n\nis Q.C-C.’s parents who seek the more restrictive environment. Carter, 950 F.2d at 160. Most\n\nimportantly, however, the least restrictive environment factor focuses on the needs of the student,\n\nand “Congress recognized that regular classrooms simply would not be a suitable setting for the\n\neducation of many handicapped children.” Rowley, 458 U.S. at 181, n.4. Here, the Court has\n\nfound that the preponderance of the evidence supports the conclusion that Q.C-C. requires a full-\n\ntime special education, set apart from the general education population, in order to receive a\n\nFAPE. The least restrictive environment that is appropriate for Q.C-C. is Lab.\n\n       The Court thus finds that, upon consideration of the Branham factors and the entirety of\n\nthe administrative record, it is appropriate to order relief in the form of a prospective placement.\n\nLab is the only appropriate placement supported by the record, and, therefore, the Court will\n\norder the District to place and fund Q.C-C. at Lab for the remainder of the 2015–2016 school\n\nyear. See McKenzie, 771 F.2d at 1531.\n\n\n\n\n150:17–151:1 (testimony by Ms. Van Dyke that Lab has students placed and funded by DCPS);\nsee also AR 496 (Lab’s Certificate of Approval granted by the District).\n\n\n                                                 33\n\f                                    V.

INTRODUCTION\n\n       Plaintiffs R.C. and M.C. brought this action on behalf of themselves and their daughter\n\nQ.C-C. 1 under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, 20 U.S.C. §§ 1400 et seq. (the\n\n“IDEA”) against Defendant the District of Columbia (the “District”). Plaintiffs appeal from an\n\nadministrative decision that, in relevant part, found that the District of Columbia Public Schools\n\n(“DCPS”) denied Q.C-C. a free appropriate public education as required by the IDEA but\n\ndeclined to order the relief requested by Plaintiffs. Before the Court are the parties’ cross-\n\nmotions for summary judgment. See Pls.’ Mot. Summ. J., ECF No. 9; Def.’s Opp’n Pls.’ Mot.\n\nSumm. J. & Def.’s Cross-Mot. Summ. J., ECF No. 11. For the reasons provided below, the\n\nCourt will grant Plaintiffs’ motion and deny the District’s motion.\n\n\n\n\n1\n       The Court has permitted Plaintiffs to proceed anonymously in this action pursuant to\nRule 5.2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and Local Civil Rule 5.1(h). See Order, ECF\nNo. 3.\n\f                                       II. BACKGROUND\n\n       The Court begins by providing an overview of the framework of the IDEA before turning\n\nto the factual background and procedural history of this case.\n\n                                    A. Statutory Framework\n\n       Under the IDEA, “every child with a disability in this country is entitled to a ‘free\n\nappropriate public education,’ or FAPE.” Leggett v. District of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">793</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 62 (D.C.\n\nCir. 2015) (quoting 20 U.S.C. § 1400(d)(1)(A)). The “primary purpose” of the Act is “‘to ensure\n\nthat all children with disabilities have available to them a[n] . . . education that emphasizes\n\nspecial education and related services designed to . . . prepare them for further education,\n\nemployment, and independent living.’” Id. (quoting 20 U.S.C. § 1400(d)(1)(A)) (alteration in\n\noriginal). “A free appropriate public education entitles ‘each child with a disability’ to an\n\n‘individualized education program’ that is tailored to meet his or her unique needs.” Henry v.\n\nDistrict of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2469166\"><a href=\"/opinion/2469166/henry-v-district-of-columbia/\"><span class=\"volume\">750</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">94</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 96 (D.D.C. 2010) (quoting 20 U.S.C. §§\n\n1414(d)(1)(A)–(2)(A)).\n\n       The individualized education program (the “IEP”) is the “primary vehicle” for\n\nimplementing the IDEA. Lesesne ex rel. B.F. v. District of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186671\"><a href=\"/opinion/186671/lesesne-lakeisha-v-dc/\"><span class=\"volume\">447</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">828</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 830 (D.C.\n\nCir. 2006). The IEP is “[p]repared at meetings between a representative of the local school\n\ndistrict, the child’s teacher, the parents or guardians, and, whenever appropriate, the disabled\n\nchild.” Id. It “sets out the child’s present educational performance, establishes annual and short-\n\nterm objectives for improvements in that performance, and describes the specially designed\n\ninstruction and services that will enable the child to meet those objectives.” Id.\n\n       When the parents of a student with a disability are dissatisfied with a school district or\n\nagency’s “identification, evaluation, or educational placement of the child, or the provision of a\n\n\n\n\n                                                  2\n\ffree appropriate public education to such child,” 20 U.S.C. § 1415(b)(6), the IDEA entitles them\n\nto present their arguments in an “impartial due process hearing,” id. § 1415(f). Any party\n\naggrieved by the hearing officer’s determination may bring a civil action in state or federal court.\n\nSee id. § 1415(i)(2). The IDEA also contains a “stay put” provision, which provides that during\n\nthe pendency of any of these proceedings, the student must remain in his or her current\n\neducational placement unless otherwise agreed. See id. § 1415(j).\n\n                                     B. Factual Background\n\n       Q.C-C. is a minor living in the District of Columbia with her parents, who adopted her\n\nfrom Guatemala when she was an infant. See AR 379. Q.C-C. has been diagnosed with\n\nAttention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (“ADHD”), a phonological disorder, Mixed Receptive-\n\nExpressive Language Disorder, a reading disorder, and a disorder of written expression. See AR\n\n384; AR 750.\n\n       From kindergarten through the fourth grade, Q.C-C. attended Oyster-Adams Bilingual\n\nSchool (“Oyster-Adams”), a public school within the DCPS system. See AR 383; AR 750. In\n\nMarch and April 2010, while Q.C-C. was in the third grade at Oyster-Adams, DCPS conducted a\n\npsychological evaluation of Q.C-C. and determined that she was eligible for special education\n\nand related services pursuant to the IDEA as a student with a disability classification of “Other\n\nHealth Impairment.” See AR 262; AR 750–51. As a result, Q.C-C. received some limited\n\nadditional support during the remainder of the school year. See AR 751. Q.C-C.’s fourth grade\n\nyear at Oyster-Adams, the 2010–2011 school year, was “rough” for her both academically and\n\nsocially. AR 751. She struggled in all but one of her classes, was bullied, and lost friends and\n\nself-esteem. See id.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\f       Q.C-C.’s parents, concerned about her difficulties in fourth grade, engaged the services of\n\na special education consultant, Dr. Laura Solomon. See id.; Tr. Day 1 at 37:8–22, ECF No. 8-8;\n\nAR 261–75 (Diagnostic Educational Evaluation by Dr. Solomon dated Feb. 13, 2011). In\n\nFebruary 2011, Dr. Solomon observed Q.C-C. in classes at Oyster-Adams, reviewed her\n\neducational records, conducted tests, and interviewed her parents. See AR 263–74; AR 751. Dr.\n\nSolomon concluded that Q.C-C. “requires a more intensive program than she is currently\n\nreceiving.” AR 274; see also AR 751. Noting that Q.C-C. had ADHD, “significant dyslexia”\n\nand “multiple” other learning disabilities, Dr. Solomon opined that Q.C-C. needed, among other\n\nthings, classes with a smaller teacher-to-student ratio, counseling, and intervention from an\n\noccupational therapist and a speech language pathologist, along with systematic instruction in\n\nstrategies for attention and executive functioning. AR 274; see also AR 751. Dr. Solomon\n\nrecommended that Q.C-C.’s parents consider two schools for Q.C-C., one of which was The Lab\n\nSchool of Washington (“Lab”), a private full-time special education day school. See AR 274;\n\nAR 751.\n\n       Following Dr. Solomon’s recommendation, Q.C-C.’s parents unilaterally enrolled Q.C-C.\n\nat Lab for the 2011–2012 school year, Q.C-C.’s fifth grade year. See AR 751. In January 2012,\n\nQ.C-C.’s parents filed a due process complaint against DCPS alleging violations of the IDEA\n\nand, in June 2012, a hearing officer determined that DCPS denied Q.C-C. a FAPE by failing to\n\ninvite Q.C-C.’s parents to an IEP meeting in January 2012, by developing an IEP that was not\n\nindividually tailored to meet Q.C-C.’s needs, and by failing to provide an appropriate educational\n\nplacement for the second half of the 2011–2012 school year. See AR 39–74 (Hearing Officer\n\nDetermination dated June 28, 2012). Finding that Lab was “appropriate” under the IDEA, the\n\nhearing officer ordered DCPS to reimburse Q.C-C.’s parents for all costs of Q.C-C.’s attendance\n\n\n\n\n                                                 4\n\fat Lab from January 31, 2012 through August 31, 2012. 2 See AR 71. Q.C-C. has continued her\n\neducation at Lab since the 2011–2012 school year with DCPS continuing to fund her placement.\n\nSee AR 751.\n\n       In October 2013, during Q.C-C.’s seventh grade year at Lab, Q.C-C.’s parents filed\n\nanother due process complaint against DCPS, claiming that, despite DCPS’s continued funding\n\nof Q.C-C.’s placement at Lab, DCPS had failed to propose a program or placement for Q.C-C.\n\nSee AR 752. Q.C-C.’s parents and DCPS settled that complaint in December 2013. See id.; AR\n\n550–52 (settlement agreement signed Dec. 5, 2013). As part of the settlement, DCPS agreed to\n\ncontinue paying for Q.C-C.’s placement at Lab through June 19, 2014, evaluate Q.C-C., review\n\nand revise her IEP at a meeting before June 19, 2014, and determine a location of service\n\nfollowing the meeting. See AR 551. Q.C-C.’s parents agreed to visit the proposed location of\n\nservice and retained the right to challenge the proposed IEP and placement. See id.\n\n       Pursuant to the settlement, DCPS conducted several reviews and evaluations in April and\n\nMay of 2014. In April 2014, a DCPS school psychologist conducted an evaluation by reviewing\n\nQ.C-C.’s school records, observing Q.C-C. in class for 35 minutes, and interviewing one of Q.C-\n\nC.’s teachers and prepared a report which recommended that Q.C-C. continue to be considered\n\neligible for special education services under the “Other Health Impairment” designation. See AR\n\n554–60. A DCPS speech language pathologist, Judith Edgehill, also conducted an assessment by\n\nreviewing records, including test results and questionnaire responses by Q.C-C.’s teachers,\n\n\n\n2\n        The hearing officer declined Q.C-C.’s parents’ request for reimbursement for the entirety\nof the 2011–2012 school year, finding that they failed to prove that DCPS denied Q.C-C. a\nFAPE, or failed to make a FAPE available, during the fall of 2011. See AR 71. The Court also\nnotes that in the separate Hearing Officer Decision appealed here, the Hearing Officer incorrectly\nstated that the hearing officer in 2012 ordered DCPS to reimburse Q.C-C.’s parents “from\nJanuary 21, 2010 through the end of SY 2011–2012.” AR 751.\n\n\n                                                5\n\fobserving Q.C-C. in one class, and concluded that Q.C-C. did not have a distinct Speech and/or\n\nLanguage Impairment as a “primary disabling condition” but that DCPS should consider whether\n\nQ.C-C. was eligible to receive “oral communication related services.” AR 561–79 (emphasis\n\nomitted). A DCPS occupational therapist conducted an assessment by reviewing records,\n\nobserving Q.C-C. in class, and conducting interviews and concluded that Q.C-C.’s “decreased\n\nmuscle tone, endurance and postural stability . . . . combined with inattentiveness and ineffective\n\nsensory processing affect her ability to keep pace and fully engage in daily activities.” AR 580–\n\n88. A DCPS social worker also prepared a report based on records, a 35-minute classroom\n\nobservation, and interviews and concluded that Q.C-C. “is a vulnerable child who requires\n\nsignificant supports to be successful in accessing her academic program and maintaining\n\nemotional stability.” AR 589–96. Alexandra Lemus, Q.C-C.’s fourth-grade special education\n\nreading teacher from Oyster-Adams, also observed Q.C-C. for 30 minutes during one of her\n\nclasses at Lab. See AR 622; AR 753; Tr. Day 2 at 48:20–52:14, ECF No. 8-9.\n\n       On April 7, 2014, Lab held an annual meeting to discuss Q.C-C.’s progress and need for\n\nsupport and to revise the IEP for her continued education at Lab. See AR 327; AR 752–53.\n\nDCPS was invited to this meeting but did not attend. See AR 752. The 2014 Lab IEP called for\n\n31.25 hours of specialized instruction and 3.75 hours of related services per week, which\n\nincluded individual and group speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, and\n\npsychological treatment. See AR 327; AR 752–53.\n\n       On June 2, 2014, a DCPS team, which included Ms. Lemus, convened an IEP meeting at\n\nOyster-Adams with Q.C-C.’s parents and staff from Lab, and DCPS ultimately drafted a new\n\nproposed IEP. See AR 409; AR 421–39 (DCPS IEP dated June 2, 2014); AR 753. DCPS cited\n\nthe 2014 Lab IEP throughout its IEP, including, for example, the Lab IEP’s statement that Q.C-\n\n\n\n\n                                                 6\n\fC. “struggles to interact with her peers and has some social skills difficulties” and that “[t]his\n\nimpacts her overall self-esteem which in turn impacts her ability to function in the general\n\neducation curriculum,” AR 432, and the Lab staff agreed with the goals set forth in the DCPS\n\nIEP, see AR 754.\n\n       A sharp disagreement, however, emerged between DCPS and Q.C-C.’s parents and the\n\nLab staff regarding the amount of special education that Q.C-C. requires. See AR 753 (“There is\n\njust simply a disagreement between DCPS and [Lab] and the student’s parents about what it\n\ntakes to educate the student.”). In stark contrast with the Lab IEP, DCPS prescribed only five\n\nhours of specialized instruction per week with only one of those hours outside the general\n\neducation, as well as various related services in occupational therapy, behavioral support, and\n\nspeech and language pathology with some of those services taking place outside the general\n\neducation setting. See AR 436; AR 753. DCPS justified this proposal by determining that “the\n\nprevious DCPS IEP hours remained appropriate,” because Q.C-C. made adequate progress at\n\nOyster-Adams four years earlier. AR 641; see also AR 648–49 (“The IEP Team felt that [Q.C-\n\nC.] needs 5 hours of service, as she had on her IEP when she was last at Oyster-Adams Bilingual\n\nSchool because [Q.C-C.] made over two years of progress in Reading that year, and she is\n\nAverage on the Woodcock Johnson Tests of Achievement in Reading and Math. The lawyer for\n\nthe family disagreed and argued that [Q.C-C.] needs a full time placement. The IEP with 5 hours\n\nwas developed by the IEP Team at Oyster-Adams Bilingual School.”).\n\n       Three days after the DCPS IEP meeting, DCPS informed Q.C-C.’s parents by letter that\n\nDCPS had selected Alice Deal Middle School (“Deal”), a public school within the DCPS system,\n\nas the location of services for implementing the IEP. See AR 650–51. On June 12, 2014, Q.C-\n\nC.’s parents, through counsel, formally notified DCPS that they disagreed with and rejected\n\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n\fDCPS’s IEP, stating that Q.C-C. “requires significantly more special education services than\n\nproposed by the DCPS IEP team,” and stating their intention to maintain Q.C-C.’s placement at\n\nLab and seek “ongoing public funding for that placement.” AR 652. Pursuant to the December\n\n2013 settlement, Q.C-C.’s parents also visited Deal and met with the school’s assistant principal\n\nto discuss how Q.C-C.’s IEP would be implemented. See Tr. Day 1 at 183:7–184:7. Based on\n\ntheir observations and conversations with Deal’s assistant principal, Q.C-C.’s parents found Deal\n\nto be inappropriate for Q.C-C. for a variety of reasons, including the apparent lack of a special\n\neducation teacher outside math and reading, the large school size, and the lack of support for\n\nQ.C-C.’s difficulties with “executive functioning.” See id. at 184:1–16; id. at 189:3–190:13.\n\n          C. Administrative Proceeding and the Hearing Officer’s Determination\n\n       On August 25, 2014, Plaintiffs filed a due process complaint against DCPS, claiming that\n\nDCPS denied Q.C-C. a FAPE in two separate ways: first, by failing to propose an appropriate\n\nIEP, specifically by proposing an insufficient amount of specialized instruction; and second, by\n\nfailing to provide Q.C-C.’s parents with “meaningful participation in the IEP process” by\n\nunilaterally selecting Deal as the location of service. AR 4–11. Plaintiffs did not challenge the\n\ngoals contained in the IEP or any components of the IEP other than the prescribed amount of\n\nspecialized instruction outside general education. See AR 750 n.5. As a remedy, Plaintiffs\n\nsought, in part, an order requiring DCPS to continue to fund Q.C-C.’s placement at Lab. The\n\nHearing Officer ordered DCPS to continue to fund Q.C-C.’s placement at Lab during the\n\npendency of the complaint process pursuant to the “stay put” provision of the IDEA. See Order\n\non Motion for Stay Put Protections, AR 242– 48.\n\n       A hearing on the due process complaint was held on December 4 and December 5 of\n\n2014 before Hearing Officer Coles B. Ruff. See AR 747. At the hearing, Plaintiffs presented\n\n\n\n\n                                                 8\n\ftestimony from their educational consultant, Dr. Solomon, designated as an expert in “special\n\neducation programming and placement,” as well as one of Q.C-C.’s parents and three Deal staff\n\nmembers, all of whom were designated as experts in their respective fields of speech language\n\npathology, occupational therapy, and “special education programming and placement.” AR 768.\n\nDCPS presented testimony from an expert speech language pathologist, Ms. Lemus, and the\n\nassistant principal of Deal. See AR 768–69. The Hearing Officer issued his determination on\n\nDecember 25, 2014. See AR 747–70. 3\n\n       With respect to the first issue presented, the Hearing Officer concluded that DCPS denied\n\nQ.C-C. a FAPE by failing to propose an appropriate program or placement. See AR 760. In\n\nreaching this conclusion, he stated that “[t]he overwhelming evidence demonstrates, despite\n\nDCPS witnesses’ testimony to the contrary,” that Q.C-C. has a wide variety of health concerns\n\nthat “impact her significantly throughout all classes.” AR 762. He found that the Lab staff\n\n\n\n3\n         On December 26, 2014, the Hearing Officer issued a second version of his determination\nthat maintained the December 25, 2014 issuance date, informing the parties that the second\nversion contained “typographical corrections” and that “[n]o substantive changes ha[d] been\nmade.” AR 770; see AR 747–69 (corrected Hearing Officer Determination). The parties did not\nalert the Court to the two different versions of the determination in their briefs, and, though the\nDistrict cites the corrected version of the determination, Plaintiffs incorrectly cite the original,\nsuperseded version throughout their briefs. See, e.g., Mem. Supp. Pls.’ Mot. Summ J. at 2 n.1,\nECF No. 9 (citing AR 722–44). The Court also observes that despite the Hearing Officer’s\nstatement to the parties, the changes appear to have been more than simply “typographical.”\nMost notably, an entire paragraph of the Hearing Officer’s findings of fact was removed from the\ncorrected version. Compare AR 727 ¶ 14 with AR 752 ¶ 14. Though the Hearing Officer\nneither specifically informed the parties of this change nor provided an explanation for it, the\nCourt observes that, in the original version, the removed paragraph was repeated, but phrased\ndifferently, as a separate paragraph later in the opinion. Compare AR 727 ¶ 14 with AR 729 ¶\n20. In the corrected version, the latter paragraph was retained, though with a different paragraph\nnumber. See AR 753 ¶ 19. The removal of the paragraph (and the other changes) did not have a\nsubstantive impact on the Hearing Officer’s analysis, and none of the changes substantively\naffect the Court’s analysis here either. Nevertheless, when hearing officers make such changes\nto their decisions, it is appropriate for them to fully inform the parties on the record of the\nchanges to avoid creating unnecessary confusion for the parties and the courts.\n\n\n                                                 9\n\fmembers “credibly testified that [Q.C-C.] benefits from the level of intervention and low student\n\nto teacher ratio the student has at [Lab].” Id. As to DCPS’s IEP, he stated:\n\n               The Hearing Officer is incredulous that DCPS would base the\n               amount of specialized instruction in the student’s current IEP on the\n               amount of services that she received nearly four years prior rather\n               than taking into account that [sic] the student’s current instructional\n               performance and crafting an individualied [sic] education program\n               that meets the student’s needs where she is operating currently.\n\nAR 762. He further found that “there was credible testimony that the extensive goals that are in\n\nthe student’s DCPS IEP that [Lab] helped draft cannot be implemented in the scant number of\n\nhours of specialized instruction in the DCPS IEP as it was drafted on June 2, 2014.” AR 763.\n\n       Though the Hearing Officer found, based on “overwhelming evidence,” that Plaintiffs\n\nhad established that DCPS denied Q.C-C. a FAPE by providing an insufficient number of hours\n\nof specialized instruction in her IEP, he nonetheless declined to order the equitable remedy that\n\nPlaintiffs sought: prospective placement at Lab. See AR 762–64. Instead, he struck a middle\n\nground and chose to amend Q.C-C.’s IEP to prescribe “at least 25 hours of specailized [sic]\n\nisntruction [sic] outside general education per week.” AR 763. The Hearing Officer justified\n\nthis result by stating that he was “not convinced that [Q.C-C.] must be totally removed from her\n\nnon-disabled peers and that a separate school is the student’s least restrictive environment on the\n\ncontinuum of placements.” AR 763–64. He reached this determination by considering two\n\npieces of evidence: first, testimony concerning Q.C-C.’s physical education class at Lab; and\n\nsecond, Q.C-C.’s parent’s testimony concerning Q.C-C.’s interaction with non-disabled peers in\n\nextracurricular activities. See id.\n\n       The Hearing Officer ruled for DCPS on the second issue raised by Plaintiffs and\n\nconcluded that Plaintiffs did not prove by a preponderance of the evidence that DCPS also\n\n\n\n\n                                                 10\n\fdenied Q.C-C. a FAPE by failing to provide Q.C-C.’s parents with meaningful participation in\n\nthe IEP process. See AR 764.\n\n        Plaintiffs timely instituted this action pursuant to the IDEA, challenging the Hearing\n\nOfficer’s determination in part, in March 2015. 4 See Compl., ECF No. 5. The Complaint\n\nrequests as relief: (1) judgment for Plaintiffs and against the District; (2) a declaration that the\n\nDistrict violated Plaintiffs’ rights; (3) an order directing the District to reimburse Plaintiffs for\n\nthe tuition expenses and costs incurred in enrolling Q.C-C. at Lab during the 2014–2015 school\n\nyear; (4) an order directing the District to place and fund Q.C-C. at Lab; (5) an order directing\n\nthe District to pay Plaintiffs’ reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs; and (6) any other relief that the\n\nCourt deems just. See id. at 9–10.\n\n\n                                  III. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n        Following an administrative proceeding under the IDEA, any party that is “aggrieved by\n\nthe findings and decision” of the hearing officer may bring a civil action in federal court. 20\n\nU.S.C. § 1415(i)(2). The IDEA provides that the reviewing court “(i) shall receive the records of\n\nthe administrative proceedings; (ii) shall hear additional evidence at the request of a party; and\n\n(iii) basing its decision on the preponderance of the evidence, shall grant such relief as the court\n\ndetermines is appropriate.” Id. § 1415(i)(2)(C); see also 34 C.F.R. § 300.516(c). The IDEA\n\ngives courts “broad discretion” to fashion remedies for IDEA violations. Florence Cnty. Sch.\n\n\n\n4\n       Plaintiffs’ Complaint does not challenge the Hearing Officer’s determination on the\nsecond claim asserted in their original due process complaint. The Complaint delineates three\ncounts: Count I for failure to provide a FAPE, Count II for failure to develop an appropriate IEP,\nand Count III for failure of the Hearing Officer to render a proper decision. See Compl. at 8–9.\nThe parties, however, do not address these counts in their summary judgment motions, briefing,\nor proposed orders or otherwise suggest that these are brought as distinct causes of action. The\nCourt will likewise consider these counts collectively.\n\n\n                                                  11\n\fDist. Four v.

The Court need not offer an opinion here on these courts’\nformulations of the standard of review, because the law in this Circuit as to the proper standard\nof review is clear and well-established. The Court does not take a position as to whether Doyle\nor Teague conflict with the law in this Circuit.\n\n\n                                                    13\n\f                                        IV. ANALYSIS\n\n       The Court first clarifies the issues before it and the proper standard for consideration of\n\nwhether to award a prospective placement, before turning to its review of the Hearing Officer’s\n\ndetermination and analysis of the record.\n\n                               A. Issues Presented and Disputed\n\n       The Court begins by identifying the issues presented in this action.\n\n       Though Plaintiffs argue as a section heading in their motion for summary judgment that\n\n“The Court Must Make an Independent Determination of Whether DCPS Provided Q.C-C. With\n\na FAPE,” they simultaneously assert that the “sole issue here is the appropriateness of the\n\nHearing Officer’s award” and that the “Hearing Officer’s findings and conclusions as to the\n\ninappropriateness of Q.C-C.’s program and placement are not before this Court and therefore\n\nshould not be disturbed.” Mem. Supp. Pls.’ Mot. Summ J. (“Pls.’ Mem. Supp.”) at 8–10, ECF\n\nNo. 9. The District similarly makes clear (and, in the Court’s view, for good reason) that it does\n\nnot challenge the Hearing Officer’s conclusion that DCPS denied Q.C-C. a FAPE “when it\n\noffered an inadequate educational placement.” 6 Def.’s Mem. P. & A. Supp. Def.’s Opp’n Pls.’\n\nMot. Summ. J. & Def.’s Cross-Mot. Summ. J. (“Def.’s Mem. Supp.”) at 4, ECF No. 11. The\n\nCourt will therefore leave the Hearing Officer’s determination that DCPS denied Q.C-C. a FAPE\n\n\n\n\n6\n        The District’s description of the Hearing Officer’s conclusion is imprecise. Though the\nHearing Officer stated that Plaintiffs had proven that DCPS denied QCC a FAPE by “failing to\npropose an appropriate program or placement,” the remainder of the decision indicates that his\nfocus was on DCPS’s IEP, rather than the proposed placement at Deal, though even this is less\nthan clear as the Hearing Officer did not discuss the adequacy of Deal. See, e.g., AR 763\n(concluding that “the IEP DCPS developed was not reasonably calculated to provide the student\neducational benefit at the time it was developed and based upon the information available to the\nIEP team on June, 2014”); AR 764 (ordering DCPS to meet with Plaintiffs and “make a\ndetermination regarding the student’s educational placement and location of services”).\n\n\n                                                14\n\fintact and proceed on that basis, limiting its analysis in this case to the appropriateness of the\n\nHearing Officer’s equitable remedies for the now-uncontested violation of the IDEA.\n\n        Plaintiffs’ Complaint seeks an order requiring the District “to reimburse plaintiffs for the\n\ntuition expenses and costs incurred in enrolling Q.C-C. at The Lab School of Washington for the\n\n2014–2015 school year” and an order directing the District to “place and fund” Q.C-C. at Lab.\n\nCompl. at 10. The District argues that the claim for reimbursement is not before the Court\n\nbecause it was neither presented to the Hearing Officer nor addressed in the Hearing Officer’s\n\ndetermination and, even if it was presented or addressed, the issue is now moot.\n\n        “[A] party must pursue all administrative avenues of redress” under the IDEA before\n\nseeking judicial review.

Plaintiffs’ claim and\n\nrequest at the administrative level for “funding” Q.C-C.’s placement at Lab, e.g., AR 9, can be\n\nconstrued as inclusive of a claim for reimbursement, and the Court therefore finds that Plaintiffs\n\ndid not fail to exhaust their administrative remedies with respect to reimbursement. See K.B. v.\n\nDistrict of Columbia, No. 13-0649, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">5191330</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *8 (D.D.C. Sept. 4, 2015) (construing\n\nrequest for “fund[ing]” to include request for reimbursement despite absence of the phrase\n\n“tuition reimbursement”). The record is clear, however, that DCPS was ordered to continue\n\nfunding Q.C-C.’s placement at Lab during the pendency of the administrative proceeding, see\n\nAR 242– 48, and Plaintiffs do not contest the District’s statement that DCPS has continued to\n\nfund Q.C-C.’s placement at Lab during the pendency of this action. Therefore, the Court finds\n\nthat any claim for reimbursement is moot, and the Court considers only Plaintiffs’ request for\n\nprospective placement at Lab. 8\n\n\n\n\n8\n         In cursory fashion at the end of their joint opposition and opening summary judgment\nbrief, the District also argues that Plaintiffs’ request for prospective placement and funding is\nalso “an inappropriate attempt to get around administrative exhaustion remedies,” because “[t]he\ndistrict court does not have authority to address school years that have not first been addressed in\nan administrative hearing.” Def.’s Mem. Supp. at 11–12. The District offers no further\nreasoning or detail for this argument, apart from an unexplained citation to Pinto v.

Supp. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">275</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.D.C. 2014), and the District does not raise the argument again\nin their reply brief. “It is not enough merely to mention a possible argument in the most skeletal\n\n\n                                                16\n\f                     B. Standard for Considering Prospective Placement\n\n       Before reviewing the Hearing Officer’s determination to not award Plaintiffs’ requested\n\nrelief of placement at Lab and making its own assessment, it is necessary for the Court to first set\n\nforth the standard by which a court or hearing officer should determine whether to award a\n\nprospective placement. It is particularly important to do so here, in which Plaintiffs, the District,\n\nand the Hearing Officer have offered conflicting standards.\n\n       The IDEA requires the Court to “grant such relief as the court determines is appropriate,”\n\n20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(C)(iii), and “the court enjoys ‘broad discretion’” in fashioning equitable\n\nrelief under this provision, Florence, 510 U.S. at 16 (quoting Sch. Comm. of Burlington v.

Supp. at 13. In their joint reply\n\nand opposition brief, however, Plaintiffs take a different position, arguing that, following the\n\nD.C. Circuit’s decision in Leggett v. District of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">793</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.C. Cir. 2015), a “new\n\nand more specific standard” applies in which “placement and/or reimbursement at the unilateral\n\nplacement is the appropriate relief” when “no other placement is offered and the parental\n\nplacement meets the Rowley standard.” Pls.’ Reply at 1–3. Plaintiffs further argue that, pursuant\n\nto Leggett, it is not necessary consider the “least restrictive environment.” See id. at 6. The\n\nDistrict, on the other hand, argues that the standard for reimbursement is inapplicable and that\n\nthe least restrictive environment analysis is controlling. See Def.’s Mem. Supp. at 7–9. The\n\nDistrict does not cite Branham or otherwise reference any of its other factors. The District’s\n\nposition is in line with the approach of the Hearing Officer, who ignored Branham and its other\n\nfactors, focusing exclusively on the least restrictive environment factor. See, e.g., AR 763 (“At\n\n[Lab] the student has no interaction with students who do not have a disability. IDEA clearly\n\nmandates that to the greatest extent possible students shall be educated with their non-disabled\n\npeers.”).\n\n       Both sides have missed the mark here. Branham, which provides for consideration of the\n\nleast restrictive environment as a relevant factor, is and remains good law with respect to\n\nordering prospective placement as a discretionary equitable remedy. Plaintiffs misread the D.C.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 18\n\fCircuit’s decision in Leggett as somehow overturning Branham and its factors. Nothing in the\n\nLeggett opinion lends itself to such a dramatic interpretation, and the two cases, along with the\n\nD.C. Circuit’s earlier opinion in McKenzie, can be read harmoniously.\n\n       The D.C. Circuit defined the issue in Leggett as follows: “When a parent chooses,\n\nwithout school officials’ consent, to send her child to a private school, under what circumstances\n\nmust the school district reimburse the parent for the costs of attending that school?” Leggett, 793\n\nF.3d at 62. The Circuit held that, in determining whether to order reimbursement, courts should\n\napply the same standard for determining whether a school district’s IEP is “proper under the\n\nAct”: “a parent’s unilateral private placement is proper under the Act so long as it is ‘reasonably\n\ncalculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits.’” Id. at 71 (quoting Rowley, 458\n\nU.S. at 207). The Circuit held that the parents in that case were entitled to reimbursement\n\nbecause the placement they chose “was the only placement on the record that could have\n\nprovided [the child] with an education that met her identified needs.” Id. at 72.\n\n       The fact that, in Leggett, a case that did not involve prospective placement, the Circuit\n\ndid not reference the Branham factors for prospective placement is unsurprising and certainly\n\ndoes not mean that Branham is no longer good law. On the contrary, the Leggett court actually\n\ncited another portion of Branham in its opinion. See id. at 70 (citing Branham, 427 F.3d at 9).\n\nThe Circuit also cited McKenzie as precedent, which the Circuit also cited in Branham, further\n\nindicating that the three cases can be read together. See id. at 72 (citing McKenzie, 771 F.2d at\n\n1535); Branham, 427 F.3d at 12 (citing McKenzie, 771 F.2d at 1531). Had the Circuit intended\n\nto overrule the prospective placement portion of its opinion in Branham, it would have said so.\n\n       At the same time, the District’s apparent position that reimbursement cases such as\n\nLeggett are wholly irrelevant to the prospective placement analysis is also incorrect. In\n\n\n\n\n                                                19\n\fBranham, most of the cases cited by the D.C. Circuit as support for the prospective placement\n\nfactors concerned only reimbursement. See Branham, 427 F.3d at 12 (citing Carter, 510 U.S. at\n\n16; Holland v. District of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"709198\"><a href=\"/opinion/709198/siobhan-holland-v-district-of-columbia-and-franklin-l-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">417</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 425 (D.C.

And although Leggett involved only\n\nreimbursement, the D.C. Circuit likened its decision to its prior decision in McKenzie upholding\n\na district court’s order of private placement without drawing a relevant distinction. See Leggett,\n\n793 F.3d at 72 (citing McKenzie, 771 F.2d at 1535). Moreover, the Court notes that the case\n\nprincipally relied on by the District as “remarkably similar” involved only reimbursement.\n\nDef.’s Mem. Supp. at 10 (citing N.T. v. District of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">839</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 35 (D.D.C.\n\n2012)); see N.T., 839 F. Supp. 2d at 30–31 (“The question is whether [DCPS] can provide N.T.\n\nwith a [FAPE] and, if not, to what extent it must reimburse N.T.’s parents for her private school\n\nplacement.”). Though the purposes of each form of relief are distinct, the considerations\n\ninvolved often overlap to some degree.\n\n        The parties, and the Hearing Officer, also misunderstand the proper role of the “least\n\nrestrictive environment” in the analysis. Plaintiffs’ assertion that whether the desired placement\n\nis the least restrictive is irrelevant in light of Leggett is, for the reasons explained, simply\n\nincorrect. The District, like the Hearing Officer, on the other hand, relies almost entirely on the\n\nleast restrictive environment factor to support its argument, and that, too, is incorrect.\n\n        The District cites the Fourth Circuit’s statement that “[m]ainstreaming of handicapped\n\nchildren into regular school programs where they might have opportunities to study and to go\n\nsocialize with nonhandicapped children is not only a laudable goal but is also a requirement of\n\nthe Act.” De Vries v. Fairfax Cty. Sch.

The District fails\n\nto acknowledge, however, the Supreme Court stated in Rowley that “[d]espite this preference for\n\n\n\n\n                                                   20\n\f‘mainstreaming’ handicapped children—educating them with nonhandicapped children—\n\nCongress recognized that regular classrooms simply would not be a suitable setting for the\n\neducation of many handicapped children.” Rowley, 458 U.S. at 181 n.4. For that reason, the\n\nFourth Circuit has also recognized that “mainstreaming is a policy to be pursued so long as it is\n\nconsistent with the Act’s primary goal of providing disabled students with an appropriate\n\neducation” and that “[w]here necessary for educational reasons, mainstreaming assumes a\n\nsubordinate role in formulating an educational program.” Carter By & Through Carter v.\n\nFlorence Cty.

June 12, 2006)).\n\n       Indeed, the very text of the IDEA clarifies that the least restrictive environment is\n\nrequired “[t]o the maximum extent appropriate” and that special classes and separate schooling\n\nare permitted when “the nature or severity of the disability of a child is such that education in\n\nregular classes with the use of supplementary aids and services cannot be achieved\n\nsatisfactorily.” 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(5)(A). Finally, the District and the Hearing Officer have\n\nfailed to recognize that “the Act’s preference for mainstreaming was aimed at preventing schools\n\nfrom segregating students from the general student body” and was “not meant to restrict parental\n\noptions when the public schools fail to comply with the requirements of the Act.” Carter, 950\n\nF.2d at 160.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 21\n\f       With these standards in mind, the Court reviews the Hearing Officer’s conclusions and\n\nthe administrative record.\n\n        C. Review of the Hearing Officer’s Conclusions and Analysis of the Record\n\n       Turning to the merits of this case, the Court begins by reviewing the Hearing Officer’s\n\ndetermination with respect to the ordered remedy and the reasoning he provided in support in\n\norder to determine how much weight, if any, is “due” with respect to his determination regarding\n\nthe appropriate remedy. Rowley, 458 U.S. at 206. The Court then reviews the record on its own\n\nin light of that determination.\n\n                  1. Deference Afforded to the Hearing Officer’s Determination\n\n       The Court begins with the Hearing Officer’s determination and finds that it is entitled to\n\nlittle, if any, deference on the issue presented, because it was premised on a misunderstanding of\n\nthe law, as discussed, supra, as well as a misunderstanding of the factual record and because it\n\ncontained insufficient reasoning.\n\n       As a preliminary matter, it is difficult to even discern what the Hearing Officer\n\nenvisioned for Q.C-C. when he ordered her IEP to be amended to “prescribe 25 hours per week\n\nof specialized instruction outside general education in addition to the current related services.”\n\nAR 764. In a footnote, the Hearing Officer stated that he arrived at the 25 hours per week figure\n\nby “excluding the number of related service hours prescribed in the student’s IEP from the total\n\nnumber of instructional hours per week that is typically in a DCPS IEP based upon 27.5 hours\n\nper week of instruction.” AR 763 n.18. As Plaintiffs observe (and the District does not address),\n\nthe Hearing Officer did not provide any citation to the record to support his assumption as to the\n\n“typical[]” IEP. See Pls.’ Mem. Supp. at 15 n.3. As Plaintiffs also observe, it is not clear which\n\nclasses Q.C-C. would attend in a mainstream environment under the Hearing Officer’s amended\n\n\n\n\n                                                 22\n\fIEP. See id. at 22 n.4. Plaintiffs assume that “based on his analysis of the PE class and the fact\n\nthat lunch is not typically included in the IEP . . . these are the classes for which she would be in\n\nthe mainstream without support.” Id. The Court agrees with this analysis, particularly in light of\n\nthe District’s failure to offer another interpretation or otherwise address this issue in its briefing.\n\nIn any case, the fact that the parties and the Court are forced to draw such an inference makes\n\nclear that the Hearing Officer did not provide sufficient detail or reasoning in making his\n\ndetermination, thereby entitling the determination to even less deference than under normal\n\ncircumstances.\n\n        The Hearing Officer failed to provide sufficient reasoning in other ways. Inexplicably,\n\nthe Hearing Officer’s determination contains two similar, yet alternate, versions of reasoning for\n\nhis decision to decline to order a prospective placement. See AR 463–64.\n\n        In the first version, the Hearing Officer stated that, although the Lab staff, Plaintiffs’\n\neducational consultant, and one of Q.C-C.’s parents testified that Q.C-C. would be\n\n“overwhelmed” in a general school setting, he “was not convinced by their testimony that the\n\nstudent must be totally removed from her nondisabled peers despite her need for and benefit\n\nfrom specialized instruction in all her classes.” AR 763. While he observed that, at Lab, Q.C-C.\n\n“has no interaction with students who do not have a disability,” he stated, without providing any\n\ncitation to the record or any specifics, that “[t]here is evidence that the student can and does have\n\nsocial interaction with non-disabled peers outside school and in those situations is coached by\n\nher parents on peer interaction and communication.” Id. He also stated that, at Lab, Q.C-C. “is\n\nsometimes in a class with as many as 23 students and it appears that not all the instruction\n\nprovided to [her] is provided by special educaiton [sic] teachers.” Id. He stated that he based his\n\nconclusion on this evidence. See id.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  23\n\f       Immediately following this explanation, the Hearing Officer provided an alternate\n\nversion, completely disconnected from the first version. See AR 763–64. In this second version,\n\nhe cited expert testimony, “among others,” “that [Q.C-C.] requires total removal from general\n\neducation” but stated that he did not find this testimony “convincing.” AR 763. He then stated,\n\nin contrast with the first version, that, at Lab, Q.C-C. “takes physical education with a group as\n\nlarge as 23 students and this instruction is not conducted by special education teacher [sic]” and\n\nnoted that the “IDEA defines special education to include instruction in physical education.” Id.\n\nThe Hearing Officer stated that his conclusion was “[b]ased upon these factors” and did not\n\nmention testimony concerning Q.C-C.’s extracurricular activities.\n\n       The Hearing Officer’s reasoning is not supported by his own findings of fact. His\n\ndiscussion of Q.C-C.’s classes at Lab, which seems to have been the primary justification for his\n\nconclusion, appears to have been referring to the following finding of fact: “At [Lab], the\n\nstudent receives specialized instruction and related services and her classes are instructed by\n\nspecial eudcation [sic] teachers. However, it is unclear whether the student’s drama and physical\n\neducation teachers are special education certified.” AR 757. This factual finding fits neither\n\nversion of his reasoning. In the first version, he stated that “it appears that not all the instruction\n\nprovided to [her] is provided by special educaiton [sic] teachers.” AR 763 (emphasis added).\n\nHis factual finding, however, was that all of Q.C-C.’s teachers were special education teachers,\n\nbut that it was “unclear” whether her physical education and drama teachers were certified in\n\nspecial education. AR 757. The second version, in which he went so far as to state that Q.C-C.’s\n\nphysical education class “is not conducted by special education teacher [sic]” is plainly incorrect.\n\nId. (emphasis added).\n\n\n\n\n                                                  24\n\f       Even if the Hearing Officer had correctly understood his own finding of fact, the actual\n\nfinding of fact does not support his ultimate conclusion. As Plaintiffs note, the IDEA does not\n\ndefine “special education” to include only education by certified special education teachers, but\n\nrather encompasses a broader range of instruction. See 20 U.S.C. § 1401(29) (defining “special\n\neducation” to mean “specially designed instruction . . . designed to meet the unique needs of a\n\nchild with a disability”); see also 34 C.F.R. § 300.39(b)(3) (defining “specially designed\n\ninstruction” without reference to certification); Leggett, 793 F.3d at 63 (quoting 20 U.S.C. §\n\n1401(29)).\n\n       Moreover, the two sources the Hearing Officer cited for his factual finding (without\n\nproviding any explanation) do not provide strong support for the finding or his conclusion. The\n\nHearing Officer cited a Certificate of Approval for Lab approving Lab as a “nonpublic special\n\neducation school program.” AR 496–97. He also cited generally, without any pincite or\n\nquotation, the testimony of Megan Van Dyke, the Associate Head of Lab’s junior high school.\n\nSee AR 757; AR 768. He appears to have relied on the following answer by Ms. Van Dyke\n\nwhen asked whether the physical education and drama classes were taught by “special education\n\ncertified instructors”: “I cannot speak to the PE instructor and the drama teacher, I’m not sure, I\n\ndon’t want to say either way.” Tr. Day 1 at 168:15–19. Ms. Van Dyke also testified, however,\n\nthat Q.C-C.’s physical education class was one in which “we see a lot of the anxiety and [Q.C-\n\nC.’s] struggle to apply strategies and navigate social dynamics which impact her ability to be\n\npresent for instruction.” See id. at 164:14–18. This is, at best, weak support for the Hearing\n\nOfficer’s finding of fact, and it did not warrant significant weight in the analysis.\n\n       The only other evidence relied upon by the Hearing Officer (and only in the first version\n\nof his reasoning)—Q.C-C.’s extracurricular activities—is similarly problematic for his\n\n\n\n\n                                                 25\n\fconclusions. Though the Hearing Officer did not cite any portion of the record in his reasoning,\n\nhe appears to have been referencing the following finding of fact: “The student currently has\n\nexposure to non-disabled students outside of school through the Washington Ethical Society and\n\nGirl Scouts. The student has to be coached on how to deal with her peer interactions and what to\n\nsay.” AR 759. The Hearing Officer did nothing more than paraphrase his finding of fact as his\n\nreasoning, offering no additional detail. The sole source for this finding of fact was the\n\ntestimony of one of Q.C-C.’s parents, who stated that Q.C-C. attends the Washington Ethical\n\nSociety meetings once per week and that there are ten or fewer girls in her Girl Scout troop. See\n\nTr. Day 1 at 185:2–11. Moreover, the Hearing Officer failed to acknowledge or address his own\n\nrelated finding of fact that, even in department stores, Q.C-C. “gets overstimulated” and that\n\n“when the student is having a tough time academically she leaves the classroom and skips class\n\nand this behavior may likely increase in a setting as large as [Deal].” AR 759. And the parent\n\nfurther testified that, not only did both parents need to coach Q.C-C. on her social interactions,\n\nbut that one of them also accompanies her on sleepovers with the Girl Scouts “because she does\n\nhave difficulty with sustained social interaction even in a small group like that.” Id. 185:20–\n\n186:3. The Hearing Officer did not address these issues, let alone explain how this testimony\n\ndemonstrated that, despite significant expert testimony to the contrary, Q.C-C. could handle a\n\ngeneral education setting without her parents.\n\n       For these reasons, the Court finds that the Hearing Officer’s decision is entitled to little\n\ndeference. See Reid, 401 F.3d at 521 (“[A] hearing decision ‘without reasoned and specific\n\nfindings deserves little deference.’” (quoting Kerkam, 931 F.2d at 87)); M.O., 20 F. Supp. 3d at\n\n40 (“[W]hile a certain amount of deference should be accorded to the knowledge and expertise\n\n\n\n\n                                                 26\n\fof the hearing officer, courts will accord less deference if the hearing officer’s determination\n\nlacks reasoned and specific findings.”).\n\n                 2. The Court’s Conclusion Based on the Administrative Record\n\n       The Court concludes, upon its consideration of the entirety of the administrative record\n\nand the parties’ arguments, that the preponderance of the evidence supports a finding that Q.C-C.\n\nrequires full-time specialized instruction throughout the school day and, given that Lab is the\n\nonly potential placement in the record that could satisfy Q.C-C.’s needs, an order directing the\n\nDistrict to fund Q.C-C.’s continued placement at Lab is warranted.\n\n       There is a wealth of evidence in support of Plaintiffs’ position, including substantial\n\nexpert testimony. For example, Ms. Van Dyke, a designated “expert in special education\n\nprogramming and placement,” administrator at Lab, and Q.C-C.’s former social studies teacher,\n\nAR 768, opined that Q.C-C. could not be appropriately educated in a less restrictive setting than\n\nat Lab. See Tr. Day 1 at 165:12–14. She further testified that Q.C-C. “has difficulty\n\ntransitioning into classes and in between tasks” and that she “needs a lot of structure and a lot of\n\nprocessing time.” Id. at 151:18–22. She also testified to the effect of Q.C-C.’s disabilities on her\n\nsocial interactions, stating that Q.C-C. is “socially and emotionally vulnerable.” Id. at 154:10–\n\n11; see also id. at 153:9–13 (stating that Q.C-C. “is often concerned about her peers and social\n\ninteraction” and “was more focused on what other students were doing”); AR 758 (Hearing\n\nOfficer accepting Ms. Van Dyke’s opinion on these issues as fact). As noted, supra, she also\n\ntestified that physical education—by far Q.C-C.’s largest class—presented particularly difficult\n\nissues for Q.C-C. See id. at 164:14–18.\n\n       Ms. Solomon, Plaintiffs’ retained expert in special education who has observed Q.C-C.\n\nevery year since she was in the fourth grade at Oyster-Adams, testified that “there are no areas of\n\n\n\n\n                                                 27\n\facademic skill development, social development, [or] executive and attentional development” in\n\nwhich Q.C-C. does not need specialized instruction and related services. Id. at 47:6–10. Perhaps\n\nmost significantly here, Ms. Solomon further testified that even lunch “is fraught with difficulty\n\nfor [Q.C-C.],” explaining that Q.C-C. “hoards food” and “doesn’t always eat when she’s\n\nsupposed to” and that she “has difficulty with social interactions.” Id. at 65:7–14. Ms. Solomon\n\ntestified that lunch poses a particular problem because it is “less structured.” Id. at 12–14. She\n\nalso testified to Q.C-C.’s need for support with respect to physical education. See id. at 66:21-\n\n67:14. Ms. Solomon also testified that Q.C-C. would have difficulty in a general education\n\nsetting between classes and as the building lets out at the end of the day, because “there’s too\n\nmuch moving around the building” and Q.C-C. has a tendency to “disappear.” See id. at 81:5–\n\n82:13.\n\n         Melissa Wood, Lab’s speech language pathologist, similarly testified to Q.C-C.’s\n\n“struggle[s] with peers in particular” and need for “a significant amount of teacher redirection\n\nand support.” Id. at 96:15–97:7. Judy Shincarick, Lab’s director of occupational therapy, also\n\ntestified to her concerns about Q.C-C. not receiving the necessary “redirection” in a general\n\neducation setting and Q.C-C.’s limited “ability to focus and attend in a large setting.” Id. at\n\n132:9–133:3.\n\n         There is further support provided in the documentary record. For example, an\n\nOccupational Therapy Progress Report dated March 2014 stated that Q.C-C.’s “best effort is\n\ngreatly impacted by her difficulty maintaining attention [to] academic tasks” and that Q.C-C.\n\n“tends to become distracted visually by small objects in her workspace as well as by\n\nconversations by peers around her.” AR 321. Even DCPS’s Psychological Triennial\n\nReevaluation dated April 2014 reported that Q.C-C. “struggles to interact freely and easily with\n\n\n\n\n                                                 28\n\fpeers and can isolate herself at times” and that “[t]hese weaknesses impact and compromise\n\nfunctioning in the general education curriculum” in a variety of ways. See AR 373–74.\n\nSimilarly, DCPS’s Social Work Assessment Report, also dated April 2014, noted Q.C-C.’s\n\n“history of hoarding,” AR 381, and stated that “[d]uring lunch, [Q.C-C.] generally sits alone or\n\nwith her teacher because she does not connect well with her peers,” AR 383. The report\n\nconcluded that Q.C-C. “is a vulnerable child who requires significant supports in place to be\n\nsuccessful in accessing her academic program and maintaining emotional stability.” AR 386.\n\nFinally, it is also notable that, in 2012, a Hearing Officer determined that Q.C-C. “needs full-\n\ntime, specialized instruction outside the general education setting to access the general education\n\ncurriculum.” AR 159.\n\n       The District offers the Court very little evidence in opposition, limiting its argument on\n\nthis issue to essentially one short paragraph of its brief and almost entirely relying on the same\n\nevidence that the Hearing Officer relied on in reaching his determination. See Def.’s Mem.\n\nSupp. at 9–10. The Court has already discussed the Hearing Officer’s flawed and insufficient\n\nconsideration of this evidence in his reasoning, and the District does not offer the Court any\n\nfurther analysis. The District does not, for example, explain how uncertainty regarding the\n\nphysical education teacher’s special education certification—in a school dedicated entirely to\n\nspecial education—shows that Q.C-C. can handle physical education in a general education\n\nsetting. Nor does it explain how Q.C-C.’s after-school participation in Girl Scouts and the\n\nWashington Ethical Society with significant parental support advances its position.\n\n       Instead, the District simply adds that Ms. Van Dyke and Ms. Wood testified that they had\n\nnot observed Q.C-C. in a setting outside of Lab. See id. at 10 (citing Tr. Day 1 at 109:2–4; Tr.\n\nDay 1 at 166:12–14); see also AR 757–58 (Hearing Officer noting the same in his findings of\n\n\n\n\n                                                 29\n\ffact). While this might be a plausible argument for discounting their expert testimony, the\n\nDistrict fails to address Plaintiffs’ other expert witnesses, including Dr. Solomon, who has\n\ncontinually observed Q.C-C. since her time at Oyster-Adams. More importantly, the District\n\ndoes not ask the Court to consider other expert testimony or documentary evidence in opposition\n\nto Plaintiffs’ experts. In fact, as discussed, several of the District’s own expert reports support\n\nPlaintiffs’ experts’ opinions. The District simply fails to offer the Court any real evidentiary\n\nbasis to toss aside the wealth of evidence and expert testimony that support Plaintiffs’ position.\n\n       The District also offers the Court two prior cases as precedent, but each of these cases is\n\nplainly distinguishable from this one, and the distinctions only serve to bolster the Court’s\n\nanalysis.\n\n       The District primarily relies upon Pinto v. District of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">69</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">275</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(D.D.C. 2014), in which Magistrate Judge Robinson, 9 in relevant part, upheld a Hearing\n\nOfficer’s decision to decline to award reimbursement to parents who enrolled their child at Lab.\n\nSee Pinto, 69 F. Supp. 3d at 284–86. Despite relying heavily on the case, the District does not\n\nactually offer any comparison of the facts and evidence in that case to this one. Instead, the\n\nDistrict simply states that the Magistrate Judge Robinson’s decision in Pinto to uphold the\n\nHearing Officer’s determination because the plaintiffs in that case “failed to identify an error by\n\nthe Hearing Officer” and the Hearing Officer “considered all of the evidence offered during the\n\nhearing, relied upon the applicable authorities, and clearly articulated his findings” is sufficient\n\nto “support[] affirming the hearing officer’s ruling” in this case. Def.’s Mem. Supp. at 10\n\n(quoting Pinto, 69 F. Supp. 3d at 286). In stark contrast, as the Court has already discussed, in\n\n\n\n9\n      The District erroneously states that the case was decided by Judge Friedman. See Def.’s\nMem. Supp. at 10.\n\n\n                                                 30\n\fthis case, the Hearing Officer committed several errors, including misunderstanding the legal\n\nprecedent concerning prospective placement and his own findings of fact, and he failed to\n\nconsider all of the evidence or adequately articulate his findings. Pinto, therefore, only serves to\n\ndemonstrate the failings of the Hearing Officer in this case.\n\n       The District also relies on N.T. v. District of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">839</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.D.C.\n\n2012), in which Judge Collyer also upheld a Hearing Officer’s decision to decline to award\n\nreimbursement to parents who enrolled their child at Lab. In particular, the District quotes the\n\nfollowing statement:\n\n               Although the District must pay for private school placement “[i]f no\n               suitable public school is available[,] . . . if there is an appropriate\n               public school program available . . . the District need not consider\n               private placement, even though a private school might be more\n               appropriate and better able to serve the child.” Jenkins v.\n               Squillacote, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"562601\"><a href=\"/opinion/562601/andrew-jenkins-officially-superintendent-dc-public-schools-v-theresa/\"><span class=\"volume\">935</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">303</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 305 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (citations and\n               quotations omitted).\n\nN.T., 839 F. Supp. 2d at 34 (alterations in original). The District, however, offers the Court no\n\nexplanation as to how this rule, or Judge Collyer’s application of it in N.T., applies to the\n\nevidence in this case. In fact, the distinctions between N.T. and this case are striking. First, in\n\nN.T., Judge Collyer stated that “the parents have not even argued, let alone demonstrated” that\n\nthe selected DCPS public school could not provide their child with an appropriate education. Id.\n\nBy contrast, as the Court has detailed, Q.C-C.’s parents have provided a wealth of evidence in\n\nsupport of their claim that Q.C-C. requires full-time specialized instruction, while the District has\n\noffered virtually none to the Court and has not suggested any alternative public school that might\n\nbe appropriate. Second, in N.T., the parents’ “educational consultant admitted that with\n\nsubstantial intervention, [the child] was able to make educational progress in an inclusive\n\nsetting” and the “written reports at [the public school] confirm this.” Id. at 35. Here, of course,\n\nPlaintiffs’ educational consultant, along with several other expert witnesses, testified that Q.C-C.\n\n\n                                                 31\n\fneeds the full-time support of Lab, and their opinions are supported by documentary evidence.\n\nThird, and finally, in N.T., the parents focused on “extolling the virtues of The Lab School,”\n\nrather than whether their child could receive a FAPE at a public school. Id. Here, Plaintiffs’\n\nwitnesses and evidence focused not only on Q.C-C.’s progress at Lab, but also her inability to\n\nreceive a FAPE in a general education setting.\n\n       The Court next considers the Branham factors to determine whether prospective\n\nplacement at Lab is the appropriate remedy. The first through third factors, which concern the\n\n“nature and severity” of Q.C-C.’s disability, her “specialized educational needs,” and the “link\n\nbetween those needs and the services offered” by Lab, Branham, 427 F.3d at 12, counsel in favor\n\nof prospective placement. As the Court has detailed, the administrative record—as well as the\n\nHearing Officer’s own findings of fact—make clear that Q.C-C. suffers from significant\n\ndisabilities that affect all facets of her education. Even with the significant amount of specialized\n\ninstruction and related support ordered by the Hearing Officer, it appears that Q.C-C. would still\n\nbe required to have at least lunch and physical education in a large general education setting, and\n\nshe would undoubtedly be required to navigate hallways and have other non-structured\n\ninteractions with nondisabled peers. The evidence, including expert testimony, demonstrates that\n\nQ.C-C. would face potentially insurmountable difficulties if the Hearing Officer’s proposed IEP\n\nwere to be implemented. At Lab, on the other hand, Q.C-C. is able to make progress in a\n\ncontrolled environment that is sensitive to her unique needs. The District presents no argument\n\nwith respect to the fourth Branham factor, which concerns the cost of placement at Lab, nor did\n\nthey present one before the Hearing Officer. 10\n\n\n\n\n10\n        The Court also notes that the District has been funding QCC’s placement at Lab for\nseveral years and that the District has funded several other students at Lab. See Day 1 Tr. at\n\n\n                                                  32\n\f       The final Branham factor—the extent to which placement at Lab represents the least\n\nrestrictive environment—is obviously the strongest point of contention between the parties.\n\nFirst, as the Court discussed, supra, this factor is of less importance than the IDEA’s “primary\n\ngoal of providing disabled students with an appropriate education,” particularly where, as here, it\n\nis Q.C-C.’s parents who seek the more restrictive environment. Carter, 950 F.2d at 160. Most\n\nimportantly, however, the least restrictive environment factor focuses on the needs of the student,\n\nand “Congress recognized that regular classrooms simply would not be a suitable setting for the\n\neducation of many handicapped children.” Rowley, 458 U.S. at 181, n.4. Here, the Court has\n\nfound that the preponderance of the evidence supports the conclusion that Q.C-C. requires a full-\n\ntime special education, set apart from the general education population, in order to receive a\n\nFAPE. The least restrictive environment that is appropriate for Q.C-C. is Lab.\n\n       The Court thus finds that, upon consideration of the Branham factors and the entirety of\n\nthe administrative record, it is appropriate to order relief in the form of a prospective placement.\n\nLab is the only appropriate placement supported by the record, and, therefore, the Court will\n\norder the District to place and fund Q.C-C. at Lab for the remainder of the 2015–2016 school\n\nyear. See McKenzie, 771 F.2d at 1531.\n\n\n\n\n150:17–151:1 (testimony by Ms. Van Dyke that Lab has students placed and funded by DCPS);\nsee also AR 496 (Lab’s Certificate of Approval granted by the District).\n\n\n                                                 33\n\f                                    V. CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, the Court will GRANT Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary\n\nJudgment (ECF No. 9) and DENY Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 11).\n\nAn order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion is separately and contemporaneously issued.\n\n\nDated: February 16, 2016                                     RUDOLPH CONTRERAS\n                                                             United States District Judge\n\n\n\n\n                                            34\n\f</pre>",
