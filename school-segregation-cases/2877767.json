The Appellee filed a motion for summary action. Because no\n\nsubstantial question is presented, we will grant the Appellee’s motion. See L.A.R. 27.4.\n\f                                             I.\n\n       On July 25, 2005, Gilliam was charged with the high severity disciplinary\n\ninfraction “fighting.” Gilliam admitted to the charges at a hearing before a Disciplinary\n\nHearing Officer (“DHO”). The DHO sanctioned him with thirty days of disciplinary\n\nsegregation, forfeiture of twenty-seven days of future good-time credit, loss of sixty days\n\nof non-vested good-time credit, and the loss of telephone and visiting privileges. On\n\nNovember 14, Gilliam filed a habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. § 2241 claiming that the\n\nsanctions he received were racially motivated and excessive, prison officials improperly\n\nordered his transfer, and officials incorrectly processed the return of another inmate. The\n\nDistrict Court denied the petition. It concluded that only the claims relating to the denial\n\nof good-time credit were cognizable under § 2241 and that the sanctions imposed did not\n\nviolate due process.\n\n                                             II.\n\n       We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291, and because the issues in this\n\ncase are purely legal, we exercise plenary review. See Roussos v. Menifee, 122 F.3d 159,\n\n161 n.3 (3d Cir. 1997); Barden v. Keohane, 921 F.2d 476, 479 (3d Cir. 1990). Claims\n\nbrought under a § 2241 petition must challenge the fact or duration of a sentence or\n\nconfinement. See Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475, 500 (1973); Leamer v. Fauver, 288\n\nF.3d 532, 540-42 (3d Cir. 2002). Gilliam’s challenges to the loss of privileges, his\n\ntransfer, placement in the special housing unit, and the processing of other prisoners do\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\fnot implicate the fact or length of his sentence. Thus, the District Court properly declined\n\nto address these matters.\n\n       With respect to his loss of good-time credit, his claim can be construed to raise two\n\npoints. First, that the discipline was imposed in violation of due process, and second, that\n\nhis discipline was racially motivated, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause.\n\n       Federal inmates possess a liberty interest in good-time credit. See Wolff v.\n\nMcDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 555-57 (1974); Young v. Kann, 926 F.2d 1396, 1399 (3d Cir.\n\n1991). Wolff provides a set of minimum procedural protections that must apply to prison\n\ndisciplinary proceedings. Wolff, 418 U.S. at 556. In order to meet the minimum\n\nrequirements of procedural due process, the disciplinary findings must be supported by\n\n“some evidence” in the record. Superintendent, Mass. Corr. Inst., Walpole v. Hill, 472\n\nU.S. 445, 454 (1985). The prison and DHO afforded Gilliam all of the procedural\n\nprotections required by the Constitution, and Gilliam’s admission certainly satisfies the\n\n“some evidence” standard. Additionally, his discipline conforms with the sanctions\n\npermitted under 28 C.F.R. § 514.13, table 3, Code 201. His due process rights were not\n\nviolated.\n\n       The District Court did not address the possible equal protection claim, but we find\n\nno evidence of a violation. The Equal Protection Clause requires that all people similarly\n\nsituated be treated alike. See City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 439\n\n(1985). Gilliam’s single allegation that one Caucasian inmate received a lesser sanction\n\nfor the same disciplinary infraction does not amount to evidence of discriminatory\n\n                                             3\n\ftreatment. See McCleskey v. Kemp, 481 U.S. 279, 292 (1987) (holding that petitioner\n\nmust show purposeful discrimination which had a discriminatory effect on the petitioner).\n\nGilliam admitted to the offense and was sanctioned in conformity with the regulation. He\n\nfails to show that his sanction was motivated with a discriminatory purpose or that it had\n\na discriminatory effect.\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we grant the Appellee’s motion and will affirm the\n\norder of the District Court. Gilliam’s motion to adopt the District Court record is denied\n\nas moot.\n\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\f",
