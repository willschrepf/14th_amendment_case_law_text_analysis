MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T\n                               OPINION\n\nIKUTA, Circuit Judge:\n\n   Charles Byrd, a former pretrial detainee in the minimum-\nsecurity Durango Jail in Maricopa County, Arizona, brought\nthis action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against Maricopa County\nSheriff Joseph Arpaio in his personal and official capacities,\nKathleen O’Connell, a former cadet at the Maricopa County\nSheriff’s Office Training Academy, and Captain Austin Peter-\nson, O’Connell’s supervisor.1 Byrd contends that a search of\nhis housing unit, during which a partial strip search and pat\ndown of his groin area was conducted by a female training\ncadet despite the availability of male detention officers\nnearby, violated his constitutional rights. The district court\ndismissed Byrd’s equal protection claim and granted judg-\nment as a matter of law against Byrd on aspects of his Four-\nteenth and Fourth Amendment claims. After a jury resolved\ncertain factual disputes relating to the search, the district court\nentered judgment in favor of all defendants. Given the facts\nand procedural posture of this case, we affirm the judgment\nof the district court.\n\n                                     I\n\n                                    A\n\n   Byrd was a pretrial detainee at minimum-security Durango\nJail in Maricopa County, Arizona. In October 2004, there had\nbeen multiple fights in Byrd’s housing unit, and officials sus-\npected that contraband was circulating in the jail. In order to\n  1\n   We construe Byrd’s complaint against Arpaio in his official capacity\nas a suit against Maricopa County. See, e.g., Kentucky v. Graham, 473\nU.S. 159, 165-66 (1985); see also Ctr. for Bio-Ethical Reform v. Los\nAngeles County Sheriff Dept., 533 F.3d 780, 786 (9th Cir. 2008) (official\ncapacity suit against county sheriff was equivalent to suit against county).\nWe refer to individual defendants by name when appropriate, and other-\nwise refer to defendants collectively as “County.”\n\f            BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T                  5909\nconduct a coordinated search of Byrd’s entire housing unit,\njail supervisors requested assistance from the Maricopa\nCounty Sheriff’s Office Training Academy (Academy)\ncadets. On October 28, jail officers carrying taser and pepper\nguns entered Byrd’s cell and ordered him to remove all his\nclothing except his boxer shorts, which were made of thin\nmaterial. The officers ordered Byrd to walk into an open com-\nmon area known as the “day room,” where 25 to 30 Academy\ncadets and 10 to 15 uniformed detention officers were present.\nThe cadets wore jeans and white T-shirts with their last names\nprinted on the back in black lettering. Approximately one\nthird of both the cadets and officers in the room were female.\nAt least one person with a hand-held camera was present in\nthe day room.\n\n   Jail officials directed five or six inmates at a time to stand\nin front of a row of waiting cadets in order to be searched.\nWhen it was Byrd’s turn, the officers ordered Byrd to walk\nover to the cadets, stand facing away from them, raise his\narms above his head, and spread his legs. O’Connell\napproached Byrd from behind and conducted the search as\nfollows: She ran her hands across the waistband of Byrd’s\nboxer shorts and pulled the waistband out a few inches to\ncheck for anything hidden or taped inside; she did not look\ninto his boxer shorts. She lightly frisked over his boxer shorts\nand down the outside of his thigh, stopping at the bottom of\nthe shorts. Through the boxer shorts, O’Connell moved\nByrd’s scrotum and penis with the back of her hand in order\nto frisk his groin, applying light pressure to feel for contra-\nband. She then placed her hand at the bottom of his buttocks,\nran it upward over his boxers, and separated the cheeks to\nsearch for any contraband taped, placed, or hidden inside.2\n  2\n    Although the parties dispute whether this search constituted a “strip\nsearch,” we have referred to a search as a “pat down and partial strip\nsearch,” and simply as a “strip search,” when a suspect was stripped to her\nunderwear and officers felt the suspect’s groin area through the under-\nwear. United States v. Gonzalez-Rincon, 36 F.3d 859, 861 (9th Cir. 1994).\nBecause Byrd was not completely unclothed, but was in his boxer shorts\nand the search physically explored his genital region, we will refer to the\nsearch as a “pat down and partial strip search” or, for the sake of brevity\nand convenience, a “strip search.”\n\f5910         BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T\nThe record indicates the search of Byrd was brief. O’Connell\ndemonstrated the search to the jury and testified that it lasted\nbetween 10 and 20 seconds, while Byrd testified that it lasted\n60 seconds.\n\n   Under the County’s policies and customs, female officers\nand cadets are not permitted to observe or conduct cross-\ngender strip searches if all of an inmate’s clothing has been\nremoved. They are, however, permitted to observe and con-\nduct searches, whether visual or tactile, if an inmate is wear-\ning underwear, which at Maricopa County’s detention\nfacilities are standard-issue boxer shorts. Females are not per-\nmitted to look into a male inmate’s underwear when conduct-\ning a pat down and partial strip search.\n\n                                     B\n\n   After the search, Byrd filed an inmate grievance form with\nthe Maricopa County Sheriff’s office. He subsequently filed\nadditional grievances with the County, none of which resulted\nin remedial action. Byrd filed a pro se complaint in district\ncourt on November 26, 2004, and amended it June 14, 2005,\nalleging that the search violated: (1) his Fourth Amendment\nright to be free from unreasonable searches; (2) his substan-\ntive due process right to be free from punishment;3 and (3) his\nFourteenth Amendment right to equal protection of the laws.\n   3\n     Byrd’s pro se complaint alleged that his Eighth Amendment rights had\nbeen violated. Because at the time of the search Byrd was a pretrial\ndetainee, the district court correctly recharacterized this claim as one\nalleging that the County violated Byrd’s substantive due process rights\nunder the Fourteenth Amendment. See Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 537\nn.16 (1979) (“The Court of Appeals properly relied on the Due Process\nClause rather than the Eighth Amendment in considering the claims of\npretrial detainees. Due process requires that a pretrial detainee not be pun-\nished. A sentenced inmate, on the other hand, may be punished, although\nthat punishment may not be “cruel and unusual” under the Eighth Amend-\nment.”). We refer to this claim as a Fourteenth Amendment substantive\ndue process claim throughout.\n\f             BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T                   5911\nByrd alleged that his Fourth Amendment and substantive due\nprocess rights were violated because O’Connell caused “wan-\nton and unnecessary infliction of pain” when she “grabbed his\ngenitals twice, then ram[m]ed her index finger through the\ncrack of his butto[cks].” He also alleged that there was no\nneed for a female cadet to touch him because there were more\nthan ten male detention officers present who could have per-\nformed the search. In addition, he claimed that jail officials\nwere aware of, but deliberately indifferent to, the psychologi-\ncal pain that a cross-gender body search was likely to cause.\nByrd alleged that the search caused him “public humiliation”\nand “psychological trauma,” among other injuries.\n\n  The County moved for summary judgment, arguing that\n“Officer O’Connell conducted the frisk (body) search of\nPlaintiff in accordance with MCSO policy DH-3; in the pres-\nence of her supervisor, Captain Peterson; and in the process\ndemonstrated and instructed detention officers in the proper\nmanner in which to conduct such a search for contraband.”\n\n   The district court issued an order dismissing part of the\ncomplaint, and granting in part and denying in part the Coun-\nty’s motion for summary judgment. Under its obligation to\ndismiss sua sponte certain complaints brought by prisoners\nproceeding in forma pauperis, see 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B),\nand certain claims regarding conditions of confinement, see\n42 U.S.C. § 1997e(c), the district court dismissed Count II,\nwhich had alleged an equal protection violation, for failure to\nstate a claim.\n\n  The district court denied the County’s motion for summary\njudgment on Byrd’s Fourth Amendment and Fourteenth\nAmendment substantive due process claims.4 The court held\n  4\n    The district court also granted the County’s motion in part, holding that\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(e), Byrd could not recover for mental or emo-\ntional harm, but he could recover compensatory, nominal, and punitive\ndamages premised on a violation of his Fourth Amendment and substan-\ntive due process rights, to the extent they were actionable. This holding is\nnot at issue on appeal.\n\f5912       BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T\nthat the County was not entitled to summary judgment on\nByrd’s Fourth Amendment claim because it had not estab-\nlished that the search was “necessary to security or that it fur-\nthered a legitimate penological interest,” and was not entitled\nto summary judgment on Byrd’s substantive due process\nclaim because it had not briefed the issue.\n\n                               C\n\n   The district court appointed trial counsel for Byrd. While\nproceeding pro se, Byrd had made no discovery requests.\nWhen Byrd’s newly appointed counsel learned that a person\nwith a hand-held camera was present on the day in question,\nhe asked the County to produce footage that may have been\nshot. The County initially stated it was unaware of any video\nrecording of the search. Shortly before trial, however,\nO’Connell informed defense counsel that the Academy had\ngiven the cadets a Video Yearbook, which showed approxi-\nmately one minute of footage from the day of the search. The\nCounty stated that it did not have the rest of the videotape\nfootage, and that it assumed it had been destroyed pursuant to\nthe County’s retention policy. The Video Yearbook did not\ninclude any footage of Byrd or of O’Connell performing\nsearches.\n\n   Byrd asked the court to exclude all references to the Video\nYearbook on the grounds that the brief surviving footage did\nnot show Byrd or O’Connell, and that it would be misleading\nand prejudicial because it highlighted the cadets in a favorable\nlight. In the alternative, Byrd requested an adverse inference\njury instruction that would state the videotape established that\nthe search was done solely for training purposes, and that\nO’Connell groped Byrd’s private parts. The district court\nreserved its decisions on whether to exclude the Video Year-\nbook, and on whether to give the requested instruction, pend-\ning the evidence produced at trial.\n\n  At trial, Byrd’s counsel questioned Sheriff Arpaio about the\nvideo footage. The district court held that this opened the door\n\f              BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T                    5913\nto the introduction of the Video Yearbook. Both the County\nand Byrd subsequently showed the video to the jury.\n\n   At the conclusion of testimony, both parties moved for\njudgment as a matter of law under Rule 50 of the Federal\nRules of Civil Procedure.5 The district court granted judgment\nas a matter of law in favor of Captain Peterson (O’Connell’s\nsupervisor) on the ground that he did not have any role at\nDurango Jail at the time of the search. Byrd does not chal-\nlenge this ruling on appeal.\n\n   Next, because Byrd had not presented any evidence that\nArpaio had instituted an unconstitutional policy (i.e., a policy\nof conducting searches for an unconstitutional purpose or in\nan unconstitutional manner), and there was no allegation that\nArpaio had personally conducted or supervised the search, the\ndistrict court held that Arpaio was entitled to judgment as a\nmatter of law, notwithstanding the remaining factual disputes.\n\n   This left one remaining defendant, Cadet O’Connell. The\ndistrict court concluded that the factual disputes over the pur-\npose of the search and the manner in which it was conducted\nshould be decided by the jury. The court held that if the jury\nfound that the County had conducted the search for an identi-\nfied security need, and if the jury found that O’Connell had\nnot conducted the search in an inappropriate manner (i.e., by\nintentionally squeezing or kneading Byrd’s penis or scrotum,\nor improperly touching his anus through his underwear), then\n  5\n   Rule 50 provides:\n      If a party has been fully heard on an issue during a jury trial and\n      the court finds that a reasonable jury would not have a legally\n      sufficient evidentiary basis to find for the party on that issue, the\n      court may: (A) resolve the issue against the party; and (B) grant\n      a motion for judgment as a matter of law against the party on a\n      claim or defense that, under the controlling law, can be main-\n      tained or defeated only with a favorable finding on that issue.\nFed. R. Civ. P. 50(a)(1).\n\f5914        BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T\nthe search would violate neither Byrd’s substantive due pro-\ncess nor his Fourth Amendment rights as a matter of law. The\ncourt denied Byrd’s cross motions for judgment as a matter of\nlaw.\n\n   In light of these rulings, the district court submitted three\nissues to the jury: (1) whether Byrd had proved that\nO’Connell “deprived him of his right against unreasonable\nsearch[es] by intentionally squeezing or kneading his penis or\nscrotum or improperly touching his anus through his under-\nwear”; (2) whether O’Connell deprived Byrd of due process\nof law by taking any inappropriate actions during the search,6\nwhich actions had inflicted pain on Byrd, and which infliction\nwas wanton; and (3) whether O’Connell violated Byrd’s right\nagainst unreasonable searches “by conducting a search not\ndone for [an] identified security need.” The district court\ninstructed the jury that it could draw an inference adverse to\na party who destroyed evidence, but declined to give the\ninstruction proposed by Byrd’s counsel.\n\n   The jury found against Byrd on each of the issues, and the\ncourt entered judgment for all defendants. This timely appeal\nfollowed. On appeal, Byrd challenges the district court’s dis-\nmissal of his equal protection claim, certain evidentiary rul-\nings, and its grant of judgment as a matter of law in favor of\nArpaio and O’Connell as to the constitutionality of the search.7\n\n                                    II\n\n  [1] We first address whether the district court erred in its\n  6\n    As in the first issue, the jury was instructed to determine whether\n“O’Connell intentionally squeezed or kneaded [Byrd’s] penis or scrotum\nor improperly touched his anus through his underwear.”\n  7\n    We reject the County’s assertion that the issues on appeal are limited\nby rules governing in forma pauperis proceedings. See 28 U.S.C. § 1915.\nByrd did not proceed in forma pauperis in bringing his appeal, and this\ncourt’s records reflect that all appropriate fees have been paid.\n\f           BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T           5915\nsua sponte dismissal under 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e) of Byrd’s\nequal protection claim. The Prison Litigation Reform Act\nstates that “[n]otwithstanding any filing fee, or any portion\nthereof, that may have been paid, the court shall dismiss the\ncase at any time if the court determines that . . . the action or\nappeal . . . fails to state a claim on which relief may be grant-\ned.” 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). We review de novo a dis-\ntrict court’s decision to dismiss for failure to state a claim\nunder 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e). Barren v. Harrington, 152 F.3d\n1193, 1194 (9th Cir. 1998) (order). “Factual allegations in the\ncomplaint are taken as true and all reasonable inferences are\ndrawn in the plaintiff’s favor.” Barrett v. Belleque, 544 F.3d\n1060, 1061 (9th Cir. 2008) (per curiam).\n\n   In dismissing Count II, the district court held that Byrd had\n“failed to allege that he is a member of a suspect class,” and\nthat Byrd “had neither alleged nor demonstrated that Defen-\ndants’ conduct was the result of purposeful or invidious dis-\ncrimination, or that the conduct bore no rational relationship\nto a legitimate government interest.”\n\n   [2] We have held that “§ 1983 claims based on Equal Pro-\ntection violations must plead intentional unlawful discrimina-\ntion or allege facts that are at least susceptible of an inference\nof discriminatory intent.” Monteiro v. Tempe Union High Sch.\nDist., 158 F.3d 1022, 1026 (9th Cir. 1998). Even construing\nByrd’s pro se complaint liberally, see Eldridge v. Block, 832\nF.2d 1132, 1137 (9th Cir. 1987), it fails to allege facts suscep-\ntible to an inference that “defendants acted with an intent or\npurpose to discriminate against the plaintiff based upon mem-\nbership in a protected class,” Barren, 152 F.3d at 1194. While\nByrd alleged that a female searched him, he fatally “failed to\nallege that defendants’ acts or omissions were motivated by\ndiscriminatory animus toward” male prisoners. Lee v. City of\nLos Angeles, 250 F.3d 668, 687 (9th Cir. 2001); see also\nRosenbaum v. City & County of San Francisco, 484 F.3d\n1142, 1152-53 (9th Cir. 2007). Accordingly, the district court\ndid not err in dismissing Count II of the complaint.\n\f5916       BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T\n                               III\n\n   We next address Byrd’s challenges to the district court’s\nevidentiary rulings. We review a district court’s evidentiary\ndecisions, which include whether and how to sanction parties\nfor destruction of evidence, for an abuse of discretion. Med.\nLab. Mgmt. Consultants v. Am. Broad. Co., 306 F.3d 806, 824\n(9th Cir. 2002). In addition to showing the district court\nabused its discretion, “the appellant is . . . required to estab-\nlish that the error was prejudicial.” Tritchler v. County of\nLake, 358 F.3d 1150, 1155 (9th Cir. 2004). We will reverse\nthe district court only if an erroneous ruling “more likely than\nnot affected the verdict.” United States v. Pang, 362 F.3d\n1187, 1192 (9th Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nByrd challenges the district court’s decision to admit the\nVideo Yearbook into evidence, as well as its refusal to give\nhis proposed adverse inference jury instruction regarding the\nCounty’s alleged destruction of the unedited footage. We con-\nsider these issues in turn.\n\n                               A\n\n   First, Byrd argues the district court erred by permitting the\nCounty to introduce the Video Yearbook. According to Byrd,\nthe video was irrelevant because it does not include footage\nof O’Connell searching Byrd, or indeed, of O’Connell con-\nducting any of the searches she performed that day. More-\nover, Byrd argues that the video was prejudicial because it\npresented the cadets in a highly flattering light. Finally, Byrd\nasserts that the Video Yearbook was misleading because\nsearches depicted in the video showed cadets performing fully\nclothed searches on their supervisors, rather than the search of\nByrd in his underwear. Byrd contends that the prejudicial and\nmisleading effect of the video outweighs its limited or non-\nexistent probative value, and therefore, the district court\nabused its discretion by allowing it to be shown to the jury.\n\n  [3] We disagree. Evidence that is otherwise admissible may\nbe excluded if “its probative value is substantially outweighed\n\f           BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T           5917\nby the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or\nmisleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay,\nwaste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evi-\ndence.” Fed. R. Evid. 403. However, evidence that may have\nbeen otherwise excluded under Rule 403 may become admis-\nsible based on events at trial. “Under the rule of curative\nadmissibility, or the ‘opening the door’ doctrine, the introduc-\ntion of inadmissible evidence by one party allows an oppo-\nnent, in the court’s discretion, to introduce evidence on the\nsame issue to rebut any false impression that might have\nresulted from the earlier admission.” United States v. Whit-\nworth, 856 F.2d 1268, 1285 (9th Cir. 1988); accord Jerden v.\nAmstutz, 430 F.3d 1231, 1239 n.9 (9th Cir. 2005).\n\n   [4] At the pretrial hearing, after Byrd’s counsel objected to\nthe possible introduction of the Video Yearbook, the County\nindicated that it did not intend to offer the video as an exhibit\nunless Byrd’s counsel opened the door by insinuating that the\nCounty videotaped the particular search of Byrd and then\nerased it. In his opening statement, Byrd’s counsel indicated\nthat the County’s alleged destruction of the tape would be an\nissue at trial, stating, “You will learn that this training demon-\nstration on Mr. Byrd was videotaped but that the portion of\nthe tape has now been erased.” During direct examination, the\nfollowing exchange occurred between Arpaio and Byrd’s\ncounsel:\n\n    Q: [B]eing in law enforcement, you would agree that\n    officers must preserve all evidence which is critical\n    to inmate’s complaints.\n\n    A: Yes.\n\n    Q: And you would agree that it would be improper,\n    actually illegal, to lose evidence to cover up wrong-\n    doing; correct, sir?\n\n    A: To cover up wrongdoing?\n\f5918       BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T\n    Q: Yes.\n\n    A: Yes.\n\nBased on this line of questioning, the district court found that\nByrd’s counsel was laying the foundation for an instruction\npermitting the jury to infer that any missing evidence, namely,\nthe complete video footage recorded that day, was damaging\nto the County. Therefore, the district court held that Byrd’s\ncounsel had opened the door for the County to show the\nVideo Yearbook so the jury could determine whether the orig-\ninal video tape was likely or unlikely to contain what Byrd\nalleged. Byrd’s counsel subsequently played the video during\nclosing argument in an effort to prove the searches conducted\non the day in question were for training purposes rather than\nsecurity purposes.\n\n   [5] Because Byrd opened the door to the introduction of\nthis evidence, the district court did not abuse its broad discre-\ntion in admitting the Video Yearbook as an exhibit. See\nUnited States v. Segall, 833 F.2d 144, 148 (9th Cir. 1987).\nThe Video Yearbook was relevant to rebut Byrd’s assertion in\nopening argument, and suggestion during Arpaio’s direct\nexamination, that the original tape depicted an abusive search\nand had been improperly edited or destroyed. Moreover, Byrd\nhas not demonstrated that any unfair prejudice substantially\noutweighed the video’s value, or that the verdict would have\nbeen any different absent the video.\n\n                               B\n\n   Byrd next argues the district court erred in its formulation\nof an adverse inference instruction. Byrd requested that the\ndistrict court provide the following instruction:\n\n    The Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office video\n    recorded academy class 813’s search of the Durango\n    Jail, Housing Unit 4, on October 28, 2004. On that\n\f          BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T            5919\n    same day, Mr. Byrd filed a complaint with the Mari-\n    copa County Sheriff’s Office alleging that a female\n    cadet had sexually assaulted him. The Maricopa\n    County Sheriff’s Office erased the video footage of\n    academy class 813’s search of the Durango Jail,\n    Housing Unit 4, despite actual notice of Mr. Byrd’s\n    claims and allegations. The Maricopa County Sher-\n    iff’s Office’s destruction of the footage demonstrates\n    that the academy class’s search was done solely for\n    training purposes and that Ms. O’Connell grabbed\n    Mr. Byrd’s penis, scrotum and testicles, and inserted\n    her finger into Mr. Byrd’s anus. [altered to correct\n    the spelling of “Sheriff”].\n\nThe district court agreed to give an adverse inference instruc-\ntion, but provided the following to the jury:\n\n    A party who has timely notice of the assertion of a\n    claim has a duty to take reasonable efforts to pre-\n    serve evidence. If a party with such notice fails to\n    preserve evidence through some fault of its own, you\n    may draw an inference that the evidence not pre-\n    served would have been favorable to the opposing\n    party.\n\n   [6] Byrd argues that this instruction is inadequate because\nit did not direct the jury to make an adverse inference against\nthe County. We disagree. The district court’s instruction accu-\nrately stated the law and was adequate to allow the jury to\ndetermine whether an adverse inference against the County\nwas warranted. “A court is not required to use the exact words\nproposed by a party, incorporate every proposition of law sug-\ngested by counsel or amplify an instruction if the instructions\nas given allowed the jury to determine intelligently the issues\npresented.” Los Angeles Mem’l Coliseum Comm’n v. Nat’l\nFootball League, 726 F.2d 1381, 1398 (9th Cir. 1984). More-\nover, Byrd was not entitled to an instruction that directed the\njury to reach a conclusion about matters of disputed fact. Rob-\n\f5920         BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T\nerts v. Spalding, 783 F.2d 867, 873 (9th Cir. 1986). Because\nthe district court found that the applicability of the adverse\ninference instruction turned on disputed facts, the court’s\ndecision to give the instruction in the abstract and allow the\nparties to argue to the jury whether the facts supported its\napplication was not an abuse of the district court’s broad dis-\ncretion.\n\n                                    IV\n\n   We next turn to Byrd’s argument that the district court\nerred in granting judgment as a matter of law in favor of\nArpaio and O’Connell. Byrd contends that, notwithstanding\nthe jury’s findings, the search, and in particular the cross-\ngender aspect of it, violated both his substantive due process\nright to be free from punishment and his Fourth Amendment\nright to be free from unreasonable searches.8 “We review de\nnovo an order granting or denying judgment as a matter of\nlaw.” Quiksilver, Inc. v. Kymsta Corp., 466 F.3d 749, 755 (9th\nCir. 2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). “In considering\na motion under Rule 50 of the Federal Rules of Civil Proce-\ndure, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the\nnon-moving party and draw all reasonable inferences in favor\nof that party.” E.E.O.C. v. Pacific Maritime Ass’n, 351 F.3d\n1270, 1272 (9th Cir. 2003). Judgment as a matter of law\n“should be granted when the evidence permits only one rea-\nsonable conclusion as to the verdict. If conflicting inferences\nmay be drawn from the facts, the case must go to the jury.”\nRedman v. County of San Diego, 942 F.2d 1435, 1439 (9th\n  8\n    The County contends that Byrd has waived any challenge to the spe-\ncific search at issue here and is challenging only the County’s general pol-\nicy allowing cross-gender searches. We reject this argument. Byrd argued\nboth before the district court and on appeal that the search conducted by\nO’Connell violated his constitutional rights, and he pursued a claim\nagainst Arpaio in both his individual and official capacities. We read\nByrd’s appeal as challenging both the search to which he was subjected\nand the alleged County policy which putatively caused it to occur. See,\ne.g., Hafer v. Melo, 502 U.S. 21, 25 (1991).\n\f             BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T                  5921\nCir. 1991) (en banc) (internal quotation marks and citation\nomitted).\n\n   Our review is sharply circumscribed by Bell v. Wolfish, 441\nU.S. 520 (1979), in which the Supreme Court upheld visual\nbody cavity searches of pretrial detainees against their Fourth\nand Fourteenth Amendment challenges. Under Bell, when\nreviewing conditions and restrictions placed on prisoners and\npretrial detainees, we must bear in mind the inherent difficul-\nties in managing a detention facility, and that “the problems\nthat arise in the day-to-day operation of a corrections facility\nare not susceptible of easy solutions.” Id. at 547. Judicial def-\nerence to prison officials is appropriate on the grounds that\n“the realities of running a corrections institution are complex\nand difficult, courts are ill equipped to deal with these prob-\nlems, and the management of these facilities is confided to the\nExecutive and Legislative Branches, not to the Judicial\nBranch.” Id. at 548 n.29. Therefore, “in the absence of sub-\nstantial evidence in the record to indicate that the officials\nhave exaggerated their response to these considerations,\ncourts should ordinarily defer to their expert judgment in such\nmatters.” Id. at 540 n.23 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n   In light of these principles, our task is to determine whether\nthe district court erred in holding that, as a matter of law, nei-\nther Maricopa County nor the individual defendants\n(O’Connell and Arpaio in his individual capacity) violated\nByrd’s constitutional rights.9 We must also undertake our\nreview in light of the jury’s factual determinations that the\nsearch was performed for an “identified security need,” and\nthat O’Connell did not search Byrd in an inappropriate man-\nner. Byrd does not challenge these findings on appeal, and\ntherefore we are bound by them.\n  9\n    The defendants sued in their individual capacities did not assert quali-\nfied immunity in district court, and accordingly we do not consider the\nissue on appeal.\n\f5922       BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T\n                               A\n\n   We first consider Byrd’s argument that the search violated\nhis substantive due process right to be free from punishment.\nByrd contends the search at issue amounted to punishment\nbecause it was conducted by a woman despite the availability\nof men; he was not told that O’Connell was associated with\nthe jail system; jail officials carried taser and pepper guns,\ncursed at him, and ordered him to remain silent; and a person\nwith a hand-held camera was present. Moreover, Byrd states\nthat he suffers from a history of sexual abuse, and therefore\nthe cross-gender aspect of the search was particularly trau-\nmatic. Byrd asserts that the prison officials displayed deliber-\nate indifference to the harm the search would cause him, both\nbecause any person would know that the circumstances of this\nsearch would cause shock, degradation, and pain, and because\nthese consequences were easily preventable by having male\nofficials who were standing nearby conduct the search.\n\n   [7] When the government holds a person in confinement as\na pretrial detainee, it “may subject him to the restrictions and\nconditions of the detention facility so long as those conditions\nand restrictions do not amount to punishment or otherwise\nviolate the Constitution,” Bell, 441 U.S. at 536-37, because\n“under the Due Process Clause, a detainee may not be pun-\nished prior to an adjudication of guilt in accordance with due\nprocess of law,” id. at 535; accord Demery v. Arpaio, 378\nF.3d 1020, 1028 (9th Cir. 2004). This standard is different\nfrom that applied to prisoners, “who may be subject to pun-\nishment so long as it does not violate the Eighth Amend-\nment’s bar against cruel and unusual punishment.” Pierce v.\nCounty of Orange, 526 F.3d 1190, 1205 (9th Cir. 2008) (cit-\ning Bell, 441 U.S. at 535 n.16). “Because pretrial detainees’\nrights under the Fourteenth Amendment are comparable to\nprisoners’ rights under the Eighth Amendment, however, we\napply the same standards.” Frost v. Agnos, 152 F.3d 1124,\n1128 (9th Cir. 1998).\n\f           BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T           5923\n   When prisoners challenge conditions or deprivations asso-\nciated with their confinement, a court must consider the two\ncomponents of an Eighth Amendment claim: (1) the objective\ncomponent, which addresses whether the deprivation was suf-\nficiently serious to constitute “cruel and unusual” punishment;\nand (2) the subjective component, which addresses whether\nthe prison officials acted with “a sufficiently culpable state of\nmind.” Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. 294, 298 (1991). The\nSupreme Court explained that the latter intent requirement did\nnot emanate from “the predilections of this Court, but the\nEighth Amendment itself, which bans only cruel and unusual\npunishment. If the pain inflicted is not formally meted out as\npunishment by the statute or the sentencing judge, some men-\ntal element must be attributed to the inflicting officer before\nit can qualify” as punitive. Id. at 300 (emphases in original).\n\n  [8] The same intent requirement is applicable in the pretrial\ndetainee context: the Supreme Court has explained that\nwhether a particular action or condition of confinement\namounts to punishment turns on whether the action taken, or\ncondition imposed, was accompanied by punitive intent. See\nBell, 441 U.S. at 538-39.\n\n   Punitive intent may be proven in various ways. It is most\nobvious when an official expresses an intent to punish a\ndetainee. See id. at 538. When there is no evidence “of an\nexpressed intent to punish on the part of detention facility\nofficials,” punitive intent can be inferred. Id. If “a restriction\nor condition is not reasonably related to a legitimate goal—if\nit is arbitrary or purposeless—a court permissibly may infer\nthat the purpose of the governmental action is punishment that\nmay not constitutionally be inflicted upon detainees qua\ndetainees.” Id. at 539; see also Block v. Rutherford, 468 U.S.\n576, 584 (1984). When detention facility officials are person-\nally accused of depriving incarcerated persons of “the mini-\nmal civilized measure of life’s necessities,” Rhodes v.\nChapman, 452 U.S. 337, 347 (1981), or exposing them to\n“conditions posing a substantial risk of serious harm,” Farmer\n\f5924       BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T\nv. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 834 (1994), punitive intent can be\ninferred from an officer’s “deliberate indifference” to the\nharm caused. See Seiter, 501 U.S. at 302-03 (explaining the\napplicability of the deliberate indifference standard to pris-\noner cases); Frost, 152 F.3d at 1128 (explaining the applica-\nbility of the deliberate indifference standard to cases\ninvolving pretrial detainees). A detention facility official acts\nwith “deliberate indifference” if “he knows that inmates face\na substantial risk of serious harm and disregards that risk by\nfailing to take reasonable measures to abate it.” Farmer, 511\nU.S. at 847; accord Frost, 152 F.3d at 1128. “[T]he official\nmust both be aware of facts from which the inference could\nbe drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and he\nmust also draw the inference.” Farmer, 511 U.S. at 837.\n\n   [9] Byrd has not alleged or adduced any evidence indicat-\ning that O’Connell or Arpaio expressed an intent to punish\nhim. See Bell, 441 U.S. at 538. Therefore, in order to prevail\non his substantive due process claim, Byrd must present evi-\ndence from which an inference of punitive intent may be\ndrawn. See id. at 538-39; Farmer, 511 U.S. at 847. Byrd con-\ntends that we should draw such an inference in this case\nbecause the search in question is analogous to those we struck\ndown in Jordan v. Gardner, 986 F.2d 1521 (9th Cir. 1993)\n(en banc).\n\n   In Jordan, a prison had instituted a policy requiring “male\nguards to conduct random, non-emergency, suspicionless\nclothed body searches on female prisoners.” 986 F.2d at 1522\n(footnote omitted). The searches were aggressive and intru-\nsive:\n\n    According to the prison training material, “a guard\n    [was] to use a flat hand and pushing motion across\n    the inmate’s crotch area.” The guard [was to] “push\n    inward and upward when searching the crotch and\n    upper thighs of the inmate.” All seams in the leg and\n    the crotch area [were] to be “squeezed and kneaded.”\n\f           BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T          5925\n    Using the back of the hand, the guard also [was] to\n    search the breast area in a sweeping motion, so that\n    the breasts [would] be “flattened.”\n\nId. at 1523 (alterations and internal citations omitted).\n\n   In evaluating whether the policy in Jordan violated the\nEighth Amendment’s ban on “unnecessary and wanton inflic-\ntion of pain,” we first considered the objective component of\nan Eighth Amendment claim by addressing whether the depri-\nvation was sufficiently serious. We concluded that the district\ncourt’s finding that the searches constituted the “infliction of\npain” on the female inmates was not clearly erroneous, in\nlight of substantial evidence that many of the female inmates\nhad been violently sexually abused prior to their incarceration\nand were psychologically fragile, and that the cross-gender\nsearches would cause some inmates substantial suffering. Id.\nat 1525-26. The evidence included extensive expert testimony\nfrom “staff members, social workers, psychologists, an\nanthropologist, and the former Director of Corrections for\nfour different states at various times.” Id. at 1526. One expert\ntestified that “the unwilling submission to bodily contact with\nthe breasts and genitals by men would likely leave the inmate\n‘revictimized,’ resulting in a number of symptoms of post-\ntraumatic stress disorder.” Id. (alteration omitted). This evi-\ndence was corroborated by inmates’ testimony, as well as evi-\ndence that one inmate who was searched “had to have her\nfingers pried loose from bars she had grabbed during the\nsearch, and she vomited after returning to her cell block.” Id.\nat 1523.\n\n   We then considered the subjective component of an Eighth\nAmendment claim by addressing whether the prison officials\nhad acted with “deliberate indifference.” Id. at 1527. We con-\ncluded that they had, id. at 1530, basing this conclusion on\nevidence that the policymaker at the prison was aware of the\nrisk of psychological trauma to the female inmates, but never-\ntheless proceeded with the implementation of the search pol-\n\f5926      BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T\nicy, id. at 1528-29. Specifically, the prison policymaker “was\nurged by members of his own staff not to institute cross-\ngender clothed body searches due to the psychological trauma\nwhich many inmates likely would suffer.” Id. at 1528. In\naddition, a court order was required to stop the practice “al-\nthough one of the first inmates to be searched suffered a\nsevere reaction.” Id. at 1528-29. We also held that the search\npolicy was “unnecessary” because the facility’s “security\n[was] not dependent upon” cross-gender searches; nor did the\nsearches “ensure equal employment opportunities for male\nguards.” Id. at 1526-27.\n\n   [10] Applying the Jordan framework here, the prison offi-\ncials did not have the mental state necessary for their actions\nto constitute punishment. Taking the evidence and all infer-\nences in the light most favorable to Byrd, see Redman, 942\nF.2d at 1439, there is no evidence in the record that would\nallow a rational jury to conclude that either O’Connell or\nArpaio knew the cross-gender aspect of the search would\ncause Byrd harm, or that either of them “disregard[ed] that\nrisk by failing to take reasonable measures to abate it,” Far-\nmer, 511 U.S. at 847. Arpaio testified that in over 15 years,\nthere had never been a problem with a male being searched\nby a female, and the record does not show otherwise. Byrd\ndid not indicate to anyone at the jail before or during the\nsearch that he had a history of sexual abuse, and there is no\nevidence that anyone at the jail was aware of this history.\nMoreover, O’Connell testified that she had searched a “couple\nhundred” men in the same manner, and no man had ever\nadversely reacted to a search. Therefore, Byrd has not shown\nthat either O’Connell or Arpaio acted with deliberate indiffer-\nence in conducting the search.\n\n   Finally (and as discussed in more detail infra pp. 5934-37),\nbecause the search was reasonably related to the County’s\nlegitimate security needs, as found by the jury, and because\nthe County had a legitimate operational basis for permitting\n\f          BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T        5927\ncross-gender searches, we cannot infer that the purpose of the\nsearch was punitive. Bell, 441 U.S. at 561.\n\n   [11] Because the search was reasonably related to legiti-\nmate governmental needs, and because Byrd has pointed to no\nevidence from which a rational jury could conclude that it was\nconducted with “deliberate indifference” to pain the cross-\ngender aspect of the search might cause, it did not constitute\npunishment. Therefore we must conclude that neither Arpaio\nnor O’Connell violated Byrd’s substantive due process rights.\nCf. Jordan, 986 F.2d at 1527-30. Accordingly, we need not\nconsider the objective component of Byrd’s claim (the degree\nof deprivation or harm), or whether a pretrial detainee may be\nable to bring a Fourteenth Amendment substantive due pro-\ncess claim based on evidence of a less severe deprivation or\nharm than would be necessary to establish an Eighth Amend-\nment “cruel and unusual” punishment claim. See id. at\n1525-26.\n\n   [12] Because Byrd has suffered no substantive due process\ndeprivation, his claim against Maricopa County necessarily\nfails. Byrd has not alleged that any action apart from the\ncross-gender search performed by O’Connell violated his sub-\nstantive due process rights, and “[n]either a municipality nor\na supervisor . . . can be held liable under § 1983 where no\ninjury or constitutional violation has occurred.” Jackson v.\nCity of Bremerton, 268 F.3d 646, 653 (9th Cir. 2001); see also\nCity of Los Angeles v. Heller, 475 U.S. 796, 799 (1986);\nQuintanilla v. City of Downey, 84 F.3d 353, 356 (9th Cir.\n1996); cf. Fairley v. Luman, 281 F.3d 913, 917 (9th Cir.\n2002) (per curiam) (holding that a city may be liable under\n§ 1983 even when individual officials are exonerated, if a\nconstitutional deprivation was attributable to city action or\ninaction). We therefore affirm the district court’s grant of\njudgment as a matter of law to Arpaio and O’Connell on\nByrd’s substantive due process claim.\n\f5928         BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T\n                                    B\n\n   We next turn to the question whether the district court erred\nin holding that the search was reasonable under the Fourth\nAmendment as a matter of law, notwithstanding its cross-\ngender aspect. Again, we are bound by the jury’s unchal-\nlenged findings that the search in question was for security\npurposes and that O’Connell did not conduct it inappropriately.10\nWe take all other evidence and the inferences therefrom in the\nlight most favorable to Byrd. See Redman, 942 F.2d at 1439.\nHowever, “we must distinguish between evidence of disputed\nfacts and disputed matters of professional judgment. In\nrespect to the latter, our inferences must accord deference to\nthe views of prison authorities.” Beard v. Banks, 548 U.S.\n521, 530 (2006) (plurality op.); see also Overton v. Bazzetta,\n539 U.S. 126, 132 (2003). As noted above, this is due in part\nto the “difficulty of operating a detention facility safely, [and]\nthe seriousness of the risk of smuggled weapons and contra-\nband.” Way v. County of Ventura, 445 F.3d 1157, 1161 (9th\nCir. 2006); see also Bell, 441 U.S. at 548 n.29.\n\n   We agree with Byrd’s contention that we must analyze his\nclaim in light of both Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78 (1987) and\nBell. The Supreme Court in Bell assumed, without deciding,\nthat pretrial detainees retain Fourth Amendment rights, 441\nU.S. at 558, but subsequently held in Hudson v. Palmer that\n“the Fourth Amendment proscription against unreasonable\nsearches does not apply within the confines of the prison\ncell.” 468 U.S. 517, 526 (1984). We have held that the Fourth\nAmendment does apply to the invasion of bodily privacy in\nprisons, but the “reasonableness of a particular search is deter-\nmined by reference to the prison context.” Michenfelder v.\nSumner, 860 F.2d 328, 332 (9th Cir. 1988). The government\n“may restrict or withdraw rights to the extent necessary to fur-\n  10\n    To avoid confusion, we reiterate that the district court’s Rule 50 hold-\ning was contingent upon the jury finding that O’Connell did not perform\nthe search inappropriately and that it was performed for a security reason.\n\f           BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T           5929\nther the correctional system’s legitimate goals and policies.”\nGrummet v. Rushen, 779 F.2d 491, 493 (9th Cir. 1985).\n\n   [13] In considering Fourth Amendment claims, Bell man-\ndates a “test of reasonableness,” which “requires a balancing\nof the need for the particular search against the invasion of\npersonal rights that the search entails.” 441 U.S. at 559. In\nevaluating Fourth Amendment claims brought by incarcerated\npersons, Bell directs us to consider: (1) “the scope of the par-\nticular intrusion”; (2) “the manner in which it is conducted”;\n(3) “the justification for initiating it”; and (4) “the place in\nwhich it is conducted.” Id. In Turner, the Court provided\nmore guidance regarding Bell’s reasonableness standard,\nholding that “when a prison regulation impinges on inmates’\nconstitutional rights, the regulation is valid if it is reasonably\nrelated to legitimate penological interests.” 482 U.S. at 89.\nThe Court set forth several factors as being “relevant in deter-\nmining the reasonableness” of a prison regulation or practice:\n(1) “there must be a valid, rational connection between the\nprison regulation and the legitimate governmental interest put\nforward to justify it”; (2) “whether there are alternative means\nof exercising the right that remain open to prison inmates”;\n(3) “the impact accommodation of the asserted constitutional\nright will have on guards and other inmates, and on the alloca-\ntion of prison resources generally,” which, if the impact is\nsubstantial, requires particular deference to corrections offi-\ncials; and (4) “the absence of ready alternatives” as evidence\nof the reasonableness of a prison regulation, or “the existence\nof obvious, easy alternatives” as evidence that the regulation\n“is an ‘exaggerated response’ to prison concerns.” Id. at 89-91\n(internal citations and quotation marks omitted).\n\n   There are limits to the applicability of the reasonableness\nfactors outlined in Turner. We have not applied Turner to a\npretrial detainee’s Fourteenth Amendment claim of punish-\nment, see Demery, 378 F.3d at 1028, and Turner is not appli-\ncable to all prisoner challenges based on a deprivation of\nconstitutional rights, see Johnson v. California, 543 U.S. 499,\n\f5930       BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T\n510-11 (2005) (declining to apply Turner to the right not to\nbe discriminated against on the basis of race and indicating it\nmay not be applicable to Eighth Amendment claims of cruel\nand unusual punishment). However, Turner is applicable to\n“rights that are inconsistent with proper incarceration,” John-\nson, 543 U.S. at 510 (internal quotation marks omitted), and\n“courts have applied the Turner test to prisoners’ Fourth\nAmendment claims,” Thompson v. Souza, 111 F.3d 694, 699\n(9th Cir. 1997); see also Michenfelder, 860 F.2d at 332-33.\nAdditionally, we have applied Turner to prisoners’ challenges\narguing that cross-gender strip searches violated their right to\nprivacy. Michenfelder, 860 F.2d at 333-34.\n\n   [14] Logically, a pretrial detainee is entitled, at a minimum,\nto the same protection of constitutional rights as would be\navailable to a convicted inmate under the Turner framework.\nBell, 441 U.S. at 545 (“[P]retrial detainees, who have not been\nconvicted of any crimes, retain at least those constitutional\nrights that we have held are enjoyed by convicted prison-\ners.”); see also Jones v. Johnson, 781 F.2d 769, 771 (9th Cir.\n1986). Therefore, although Turner considered only the rights\nof convicted prisoners, its framework is relevant to analyzing\nthe constitutional rights of pretrial detainees, and we have\nlooked to it in the past. See Pierce, 526 F.3d at 1209 (analyz-\ning religious freedom rights of pretrial detainees under Tur-\nner); Mauro v. Arpaio, 188 F.3d 1054, 1059 (9th Cir. 1999)\n(en banc) (analyzing First Amendment rights of pretrial\ndetainees under Turner).\n\n   For these reasons, in reviewing the reasonableness of a\nsearch, we are guided by Turner’s direction to consider\nwhether the challenged conduct was “reasonably related to\nlegitimate penological interests.” Turner, 482 U.S. at 89; see\nalso Thompson, 111 F.3d at 699-700 (applying Turner and\nBell to Fourth Amendment claim). In evaluating whether the\nsearch meets this test, we are mindful of the “scope of the par-\nticular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the jus-\n\f            BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T                5931\ntification for initiating it, and the place in which it is\nconducted.” Bell, 441 U.S. at 559.\n\n   [15] Beginning with the first factor of Turner’s reasonable-\nrelation test, the jury found that the search was done for an\nidentified security need. There is no dispute that the County’s\nsecurity-related need to respond to reports of contraband and\nfighting in Byrd’s housing unit is a “legitimate governmental\ninterest,” or that the reports of contraband and fighting are\nrationally connected to, and a valid justification for, conduct-\ning the pat down and partial strip searches. 482 U.S. at 89; see\nalso Bell, 441 U.S. at 546-47 (“Central to all other correction\ngoals is the institutional consideration of internal security\nwithin the corrections facilities themselves.” (quoting Pell v.\nProcunier, 417 U.S. 817, 823 (1974) (alteration omitted))).11\n\n   [16] Moving to the Bell factors, the scope of the search was\nreasonable given the County’s suspicion of contraband circu-\nlating in the jail, and inmates’ ability to conceal contraband\nin private areas. In Bell, the Court held that visual body cavity\nsearches were justified by the detention facility officials’ need\nto detect contraband and maintain security, even though there\nhad been only one incident of attempted contraband smug-\ngling. 441 U.S. at 559. We have upheld similar searches of\nincarcerated persons against constitutional challenges. See\nRickman v. Avaniti, 854 F.2d 327, 328 (9th Cir. 1988)\n(approving same-gender strip searches conducted in cells of\nprisoners housed in administrative segregation prior to leav-\ning cell); see also Thompson, 111 F.3d at 701 (holding same-\ngender body-cavity search did not violate clearly established\nrights). Nor did the place of the search make it unreasonable.\n  11\n    The second Turner factor, “whether there are alternative means of\nexercising the right that remain open to prison inmates,” 482 U.S. at 90,\nis not applicable in the Fourth Amendment context, because the right to\nbe free from unreasonable searches is not a right susceptible to exercise\nby alternative means, see Thompson, 111 F.3d at 699; Michenfelder, 860\nF.2d at 331 n.1.\n\f5932       BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T\nWe have upheld strip searches even when they took place in\nview of others, in light of institutional needs and realities. See\nThompson, 111 F.3d at 701 (rejecting argument that same-\ngender strip search and visual body cavity search should have\nbeen conducted out of view of other prisoners who were\nlaughing or whistling); Michenfelder, 860 F.2d 328 (uphold-\ning prison’s same-gender visual body cavity searches when-\never an inmate left or returned to the maximum security unit,\nnotwithstanding fact that strip searches were conducted at the\nend of a hallway).\n\n   [17] The manner of this search requires closer scrutiny,\nhowever, because Byrd alleges the cross-gender aspect of the\nsearch makes it unreasonable. We have recognized that the\n“desire to shield one’s unclothed figure[ ] from view of\nstrangers, and particularly strangers of the opposite sex, is\nimpelled by elementary self-respect and personal dignity.”\nYork v. Story, 324 F.2d 450, 455 (9th Cir. 1963); see also\nMichenfelder, 860 F.2d at 334 (stating that this court recog-\nnizes “that incarcerated prisoners retain a limited right to bod-\nily privacy” in the context of being viewed by members of the\nopposite sex); Grummet, 779 F.2d at 494 (same). Yet, while\nwe have not foreclosed the possibility that a cross-gender\nsearch could violate an incarcerated person’s constitutional\nrights, we have noted that “our prior case law suggests that\nprisoners’ legitimate expectations of bodily privacy from per-\nsons of the opposite sex are extremely limited.” Jordan, 986\nF.2d at 1524. We have never held that a cross-gender search\nin a prison setting violated an inmate’s Fourth Amendment\nrights. See Grummet, 779 F.2d at 496; Jordan, 986 F.2d at\n1524; cf. Somers v. Thurman, 109 F.3d 614, 620 (9th Cir.\n1997) (in context of qualified immunity, holding right to be\nfree of cross-gender searches not clearly established). Rather,\nwe have upheld cross-gender visual observations and body\nsearches in certain circumstances.\n\n   [18] In Grummet, we upheld a policy permitting female\nofficers to conduct pat-down searches of male prisoners when\n\f           BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T           5933\nthe searches were “done briefly”; “in a professional manner\nand with respect for the inmates”; and performed on inmates\nwho were “fully clothed, and thus [did] not involve intimate\ncontact with the inmates’ bodies.” 779 F.2d at 496. The prison\ndid not require female officers to “conduct or observe strip or\nbody cavity searches” except in emergencies. Id. We addition-\nally upheld a policy when women were assigned to positions\nrequiring “infrequent and casual observation” of unclothed\nmale prisoners in their cells and while showering. Id. at 494.\nWe noted that preventing females from working in positions\nthat would require occasional invasions of inmates’ privacy\n“would necessitate a tremendous rearrangement of work\nschedules, and possibly produce a risk to both internal secur-\nity needs and equal employment opportunities for the female\nguards.” Id. at 496. Under these circumstances, we concluded\nthat “the inmates have not demonstrated that these restricted\nobservations by members of the opposite sex are so degrading\nas to require intervention by this court,” id. at 495, or that the\nsearches were “so offensive as to be unreasonable under the\nfourth amendment,” id. at 496.\n\n   [19] In Michenfelder, we rejected a prisoner’s argument\nthat a prison invaded his right to privacy due to a policy per-\nmitting the presence of female officers during visual body\ncavity searches in hallways, and permitting females to work\nin positions that allowed observation of unclothed male\ninmates. 860 F.2d at 334. In determining whether the policies\nwere reasonably related to legitimate penological interests, we\n“recognize[d] as legitimate both the interest in providing\nequal employment opportunities and the security interest in\ndeploying available staff effectively.” Id. We upheld the strip-\nsearch policy because female officers were not “routinely\npresent for [the] strip searches” and did not “regularly or fre-\nquently observe unclothed inmates without a legitimate rea-\nson for doing so.” Id. We also upheld females’ placement in\npositions that included “shower duty,” because female offi-\ncers’ presence “did not establish an inappropriate amount of\ncontact with disrobed prisoners.” Id. We reasoned, in part,\n\f5934       BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T\nthat “[p]rohibiting female employees from working” in areas\nthat allowed observation of unclothed inmates, or “requiring\n[female employees] to be replaced by males for the duration\nof strip searches, would displace officers throughout the pris-\non.” Id. (stating that the “third Turner v. Safley factor has spe-\ncial relevance here”).\n\n   Byrd argues the search in question is distinguishable from\nthose we upheld in Michenfelder and Grummet. He contends\nthe cross-gender aspect of the specific search at issue was not\nreasonable, but rather was an “ ‘exaggerated response’ to\nprison concerns,” Turner, 482 U.S. at 90, because of the inva-\nsiveness of the search and the ready availability of male offi-\ncials to conduct it. Because the male officials were\nimmediately available, he asserts there would have been no\nimpact on the jail’s allocation of resources or on its procedure\nfor meeting security needs if a male, rather than a female, had\nsearched him. Byrd further argues that the cross-gender ele-\nment of the search was not justified by the County’s need to\nprovide equal employment opportunities to female prison\nofficials. He cites testimony from County witnesses that they\nwere not aware of any incident in which a female officer’s\nemployment opportunities were hampered as a result of\naccommodations to protect the privacy interests of male\ndetainees.\n\n   [20] Even taking all facts and inferences therefrom in\nByrd’s favor, however, we cannot conclude that the manner\nof the search was unreasonable, or constituted an “exagger-\nated or excessive means to enforce security.” Thompson, 111\nF.3d at 700 (internal quotation marks omitted). As noted, the\njury found that the search was not done in an inappropriate\nmanner. The record indicates that O’Connell wore gloves at\nall times, and conducted the search professionally and swiftly,\nfinishing in, at most, 60 seconds. The invasion of Byrd’s bod-\nily privacy in this case does not substantially exceed the\ncross-gender observations and searches we upheld in Michen-\nfelder and Grummet. Moreover, the County has provided a\n\f           BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T         5935\nlegitimate justification for the cross-gender aspect of the\nsearch: the County adduced undisputed evidence that the\ncross-gender search was justified by its legitimate security\nand staffing needs, focusing primarily on the shortage of ade-\nquate personnel. Captain Peterson testified that the County\ndid not have sufficient numbers of male detention officers to\nconduct searches of male inmates, as required to meet safety\nand security needs, without the assistance of female officers.\nFurther, Peterson testified that the County was not able to\nobtain a greater number of male officers for these searches\nbecause it had difficulties hiring adequate staff, and because\nit could not pull male officers from other jail facilities.\nCadets, including females, were regularly called to assist in\nmass searches “because of [the need for] additional man-\npower, and we have no other place to get it from except” from\nthe Academy. We have held that the County has a legitimate\n“security interest in deploying available staff effectively.”\nMichenfelder, 860 F.2d at 334. Accordingly, we cannot con-\nclude that the cross-gender search lacked a “valid, rational\nconnection” to the County’s legitimate justifications. Turner,\n482 U.S. at 89.\n\n   Turning to the impact that accommodation of Byrd’s\nFourth Amendment rights would have “on the allocation of\nprison resources generally,” id. at 90, Byrd contends that the\nsearch was an “ ‘exaggerated response’ to prison concerns”\nbecause the presence of male officials at the search provided\n“an alternative that fully accommodates the prisoner’s right at\nde minimis cost to valid penological interests,” id. at 90-91.\nThis argument goes too far. A detention facility that hires\nboth male and female officers to meet its staffing needs will\nregularly have male officers, as well as female officers, avail-\nable at searches. The determination sought by Byrd, that it is\nper se unreasonable for a female officer to conduct searches\nof male inmates when male officers are also present, would\nsignificantly limit the usefulness of female officers for meet-\ning a detention facility’s security needs. In this case, such a\ndetermination would be inconsistent with the County’s\n\f5936       BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T\napproach to staffing and deploying its officers, and contrary\nto the County’s uncontradicted testimony that it has inade-\nquate male staff to meet its security needs, and must therefore\nuse both male and female officials to conduct searches on\nmale inmates.\n\n   [21] Moreover, the County has already made a determina-\ntion regarding when it can reasonably accommodate cross-\ngender concerns: its policies prohibit cross-gender observa-\ntion and administration of unclothed strip and body cavity\nsearches, and its policies prohibit visual inspection of\ninmates’ genitalia during a cross-gender pat down and partial\nstrip search. In light of the jury’s findings, and the “wide-\nranging deference” we owe to the County’s professional judg-\nment on these operational issues, Bell, 441 U.S. at 547, we\nconclude that the cross-gender search in question was not an\nexaggerated response to prison concerns.\n\n   We emphasize that the question whether the district court\nerred in granting the County’s motion for judgment as a mat-\nter of law is close. We are troubled by the overall circum-\nstances of the search in question. The scope of the search was\ninvasive in that it involved contact with Byrd’s genital region,\nalbeit through his boxer shorts. The embarrassment inherent\nin such a pat down and partial strip search was amplified by\nseveral factors: the cross-gender aspect; the fact that it took\nplace in the presence of many officers and cadets, one third\nof whom were female; and that it took place in the presence\nof a person with a hand-held camera, notwithstanding the fact\nthat the record does not give rise to the inference that Byrd’s\nsearch was recorded.\n\n   Yet, while prisoners and detainees retain “legitimate expec-\ntations of bodily privacy from persons of the opposite sex,”\nwe are obligated to acknowledge that such rights are “ex-\ntremely limited.” Jordan, 986 F.2d at 1524. The hallmark of\nthe Fourth Amendment is reasonableness, see, e.g., Bell, 441\nU.S. at 558, and we must assess reasonableness in the context\n\f           BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T          5937\nof detention settings and the intractable problems facing\nprison administrators, see, e.g., Turner, 482 U.S. at 84-89. We\nreview this case in the additional light of the jury’s findings\nthat the search was not conducted in an inappropriate manner\nand that it was conducted for an identified security need; the\nundisputed evidence of the County’s staffing issues; and the\nCounty’s existing restrictions on cross-gender contact\nbetween detention officers and inmates. We also take seri-\nously the Supreme Court’s direction that, in reviewing\nsecurity- and operations-related restrictions or conditions\nimposed by prisons, “courts must heed our warning that ‘such\nconsiderations are peculiarly within the province and profes-\nsional expertise of corrections officials, and, in the absence of\nsubstantial evidence in the record to indicate that the officials\nhave exaggerated their response to these considerations,\ncourts should ordinarily defer to their expert judgment in such\nmatters.’ ” Bell, 441 U.S. at 540 n.23 (quoting Pell, 417 U.S.\nat 827 (alteration omitted)). Given these factors, even viewing\nthe facts (other than those found by the jury) in the light most\nfavorable to Byrd, we cannot conclude that the district court\nerred in determining that the search did not violate Byrd’s\nFourth Amendment rights.\n\n  The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\nFERNANDEZ, Circuit Judge, concurring and dissenting:\n\n   I concur in part and dissent in part. In particular, I concur\nin most of the well reasoned majority opinion, but dissent\nfrom the determination in part IVB that the cross-gender\nsearch was reasonable under the circumstances and was not a\nviolation of the Fourth Amendment.\n\n  In my view, cross-gender strip searches are generally\nuncalled for and unreasonable. We have never held that any\ncross-gender strip search is proper, although we have allowed\n\f5938         BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T\nfor situations where female guards can observe unclothed\nmale prisoners,1 and have even approved of the pat down of\nfully clothed male prisoners by female guards.2 Moreover, in\none case we determined that a cross-gender search of clothed\nfemale prisoners by male guards was unconstitutional under\nthe circumstances presented in that case, but the basis of our\ndecision was not the Fourth Amendment. See Jordan v.\nGardner, 986 F.2d 1521, 1523-26 (9th Cir. 1993) (en banc).\n\n   I do not suggest that a cross-gender strip search can never\nbe appropriate. There may be emergency or other situations\nwhere a cross-gender strip search is proper, but this case pre-\nsents no facts to suggest that there was an emergency or some\nother unique reason for authorizing the search. In fact, the\nrecord shows that this sort of search is a regular part of the\njail’s routine,3 and that there were plenty of men available,\nwho could have conducted the search.4\n\n  When all is said and done, I would not think it was reason-\nable for males to strip search females in this kind of situation,\nand I do not think it was reasonable to have females strip\nsearch males. If our law does approve of it, and the majority\nopinion cogently reasons that it does, I reluct; the law should\nchange.\n  1\n     See Michenfelder v. Sumner, 860 F.2d 328, 333-34 (9th Cir. 1988);\nGrummett v. Rushen, 779 F.2d 491, 495-96 (9th Cir. 1985).\n   2\n     See Grummett, 779 F.2d at 496.\n   3\n     The County has indicated that “[i]t is our custom and practice to per-\nform regular mass pat searches and cell searches in Durango Jail for secur-\nity purposes. . . . Pat searches and cell searches are always together and\nroutinely performed for security purposes about four times a month.” It is\ninteresting to note that the County, throughout, insists that this strip search\nwas merely a pat search. It shrinks from suggesting that cross-gender strip\nsearches would be appropriate under these circumstances.\n   4\n     For example, O’Connell testified that of some thirty-two to forty-five\ncadets on hand only a couple were females.\n\f          BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T      5939\n  Thus, I respectfully dissent in that respect and otherwise\nconcur in the majority opinion.\n\f",

MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T\n                               OPINION\n\nIKUTA, Circuit Judge:\n\n   Charles Byrd, a former pretrial detainee in the minimum-\nsecurity Durango Jail in Maricopa County, Arizona, brought\nthis action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against Maricopa County\nSheriff Joseph Arpaio in his personal and official capacities,\nKathleen O’Connell, a former cadet at the Maricopa County\nSheriff’s Office Training Academy, and Captain Austin Peter-\nson, O’Connell’s supervisor.1 Byrd contends that a search of\nhis housing unit, during which a partial strip search and pat\ndown of his groin area was conducted by a female training\ncadet despite the availability of male detention officers\nnearby, violated his constitutional rights. The district court\ndismissed Byrd’s equal protection claim and granted judg-\nment as a matter of law against Byrd on aspects of his Four-\nteenth and Fourth Amendment claims. After a jury resolved\ncertain factual disputes relating to the search, the district court\nentered judgment in favor of all defendants. Given the facts\nand procedural posture of this case, we affirm the judgment\nof the district court.\n\n                                     I\n\n                                    A\n\n   Byrd was a pretrial detainee at minimum-security Durango\nJail in Maricopa County, Arizona. In October 2004, there had\nbeen multiple fights in Byrd’s housing unit, and officials sus-\npected that contraband was circulating in the jail. In order to\n  1\n   We construe Byrd’s complaint against Arpaio in his official capacity\nas a suit against Maricopa County. See, e.g., Kentucky v.

MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T                  5909\nconduct a coordinated search of Byrd’s entire housing unit,\njail supervisors requested assistance from the Maricopa\nCounty Sheriff’s Office Training Academy (Academy)\ncadets. On October 28, jail officers carrying taser and pepper\nguns entered Byrd’s cell and ordered him to remove all his\nclothing except his boxer shorts, which were made of thin\nmaterial. The officers ordered Byrd to walk into an open com-\nmon area known as the “day room,” where 25 to 30 Academy\ncadets and 10 to 15 uniformed detention officers were present.\nThe cadets wore jeans and white T-shirts with their last names\nprinted on the back in black lettering. Approximately one\nthird of both the cadets and officers in the room were female.\nAt least one person with a hand-held camera was present in\nthe day room.\n\n   Jail officials directed five or six inmates at a time to stand\nin front of a row of waiting cadets in order to be searched.\nWhen it was Byrd’s turn, the officers ordered Byrd to walk\nover to the cadets, stand facing away from them, raise his\narms above his head, and spread his legs. O’Connell\napproached Byrd from behind and conducted the search as\nfollows: She ran her hands across the waistband of Byrd’s\nboxer shorts and pulled the waistband out a few inches to\ncheck for anything hidden or taped inside; she did not look\ninto his boxer shorts. She lightly frisked over his boxer shorts\nand down the outside of his thigh, stopping at the bottom of\nthe shorts. Through the boxer shorts, O’Connell moved\nByrd’s scrotum and penis with the back of her hand in order\nto frisk his groin, applying light pressure to feel for contra-\nband. She then placed her hand at the bottom of his buttocks,\nran it upward over his boxers, and separated the cheeks to\nsearch for any contraband taped, placed, or hidden inside.2\n  2\n    Although the parties dispute whether this search constituted a “strip\nsearch,” we have referred to a search as a “pat down and partial strip\nsearch,” and simply as a “strip search,” when a suspect was stripped to her\nunderwear and officers felt the suspect’s groin area through the under-\nwear. United States v. Gonzalez-Rincon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"678888\"><a href=\"/opinion/678888/united-states-v-elizabeth-gonzalez-rincon/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">859</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 861 (9th Cir. 1994).\nBecause Byrd was not completely unclothed, but was in his boxer shorts\nand the search physically explored his genital region, we will refer to the\nsearch as a “pat down and partial strip search” or, for the sake of brevity\nand convenience, a “strip search.”\n\f5910         BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T\nThe record indicates the search of Byrd was brief. O’Connell\ndemonstrated the search to the jury and testified that it lasted\nbetween 10 and 20 seconds, while Byrd testified that it lasted\n60 seconds.\n\n   Under the County’s policies and customs, female officers\nand cadets are not permitted to observe or conduct cross-\ngender strip searches if all of an inmate’s clothing has been\nremoved. They are, however, permitted to observe and con-\nduct searches, whether visual or tactile, if an inmate is wear-\ning underwear, which at Maricopa County’s detention\nfacilities are standard-issue boxer shorts. Females are not per-\nmitted to look into a male inmate’s underwear when conduct-\ning a pat down and partial strip search.\n\n                                     B\n\n   After the search, Byrd filed an inmate grievance form with\nthe Maricopa County Sheriff’s office. He subsequently filed\nadditional grievances with the County, none of which resulted\nin remedial action. Byrd filed a pro se complaint in district\ncourt on November 26, 2004, and amended it June 14, 2005,\nalleging that the search violated: (1) his Fourth Amendment\nright to be free from unreasonable searches; (2) his substan-\ntive due process right to be free from punishment;3 and (3) his\nFourteenth Amendment right to equal protection of the laws.\n   3\n     Byrd’s pro se complaint alleged that his Eighth Amendment rights had\nbeen violated. Because at the time of the search Byrd was a pretrial\ndetainee, the district court correctly recharacterized this claim as one\nalleging that the County violated Byrd’s substantive due process rights\nunder the Fourteenth Amendment. See Bell v. Wolfish, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110075\"><a href=\"/opinion/110075/bell-v-wolfish/\"><span class=\"volume\">441</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">520</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 537\nn.16 (1979) (“The Court of Appeals properly relied on the Due Process\nClause rather than the Eighth Amendment in considering the claims of\npretrial detainees. Due process requires that a pretrial detainee not be pun-\nished. A sentenced inmate, on the other hand, may be punished, although\nthat punishment may not be “cruel and unusual” under the Eighth Amend-\nment.”). We refer to this claim as a Fourteenth Amendment substantive\ndue process claim throughout.\n\f             BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T                   5911\nByrd alleged that his Fourth Amendment and substantive due\nprocess rights were violated because O’Connell caused “wan-\nton and unnecessary infliction of pain” when she “grabbed his\ngenitals twice, then ram[m]ed her index finger through the\ncrack of his butto[cks].” He also alleged that there was no\nneed for a female cadet to touch him because there were more\nthan ten male detention officers present who could have per-\nformed the search. In addition, he claimed that jail officials\nwere aware of, but deliberately indifferent to, the psychologi-\ncal pain that a cross-gender body search was likely to cause.\nByrd alleged that the search caused him “public humiliation”\nand “psychological trauma,” among other injuries.\n\n  The County moved for summary judgment, arguing that\n“Officer O’Connell conducted the frisk (body) search of\nPlaintiff in accordance with MCSO policy DH-3; in the pres-\nence of her supervisor, Captain Peterson; and in the process\ndemonstrated and instructed detention officers in the proper\nmanner in which to conduct such a search for contraband.”\n\n   The district court issued an order dismissing part of the\ncomplaint, and granting in part and denying in part the Coun-\nty’s motion for summary judgment. Under its obligation to\ndismiss sua sponte certain complaints brought by prisoners\nproceeding in forma pauperis, see 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B),\nand certain claims regarding conditions of confinement, see\n42 U.S.C. § 1997e(c), the district court dismissed Count II,\nwhich had alleged an equal protection violation, for failure to\nstate a claim.\n\n  The district court denied the County’s motion for summary\njudgment on Byrd’s Fourth Amendment and Fourteenth\nAmendment substantive due process claims.4 The court held\n  4\n    The district court also granted the County’s motion in part, holding that\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(e), Byrd could not recover for mental or emo-\ntional harm, but he could recover compensatory, nominal, and punitive\ndamages premised on a violation of his Fourth Amendment and substan-\ntive due process rights, to the extent they were actionable. This holding is\nnot at issue on appeal.\n\f5912       BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T\nthat the County was not entitled to summary judgment on\nByrd’s Fourth Amendment claim because it had not estab-\nlished that the search was “necessary to security or that it fur-\nthered a legitimate penological interest,” and was not entitled\nto summary judgment on Byrd’s substantive due process\nclaim because it had not briefed the issue.\n\n                               C\n\n   The district court appointed trial counsel for Byrd. While\nproceeding pro se, Byrd had made no discovery requests.\nWhen Byrd’s newly appointed counsel learned that a person\nwith a hand-held camera was present on the day in question,\nhe asked the County to produce footage that may have been\nshot. The County initially stated it was unaware of any video\nrecording of the search. Shortly before trial, however,\nO’Connell informed defense counsel that the Academy had\ngiven the cadets a Video Yearbook, which showed approxi-\nmately one minute of footage from the day of the search. The\nCounty stated that it did not have the rest of the videotape\nfootage, and that it assumed it had been destroyed pursuant to\nthe County’s retention policy. The Video Yearbook did not\ninclude any footage of Byrd or of O’Connell performing\nsearches.\n\n   Byrd asked the court to exclude all references to the Video\nYearbook on the grounds that the brief surviving footage did\nnot show Byrd or O’Connell, and that it would be misleading\nand prejudicial because it highlighted the cadets in a favorable\nlight. In the alternative, Byrd requested an adverse inference\njury instruction that would state the videotape established that\nthe search was done solely for training purposes, and that\nO’Connell groped Byrd’s private parts. The district court\nreserved its decisions on whether to exclude the Video Year-\nbook, and on whether to give the requested instruction, pend-\ning the evidence produced at trial.\n\n  At trial, Byrd’s counsel questioned Sheriff Arpaio about the\nvideo footage. The district court held that this opened the door\n\f              BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T                    5913\nto the introduction of the Video Yearbook. Both the County\nand Byrd subsequently showed the video to the jury.\n\n   At the conclusion of testimony, both parties moved for\njudgment as a matter of law under Rule 50 of the Federal\nRules of Civil Procedure.5 The district court granted judgment\nas a matter of law in favor of Captain Peterson (O’Connell’s\nsupervisor) on the ground that he did not have any role at\nDurango Jail at the time of the search. Byrd does not chal-\nlenge this ruling on appeal.\n\n   Next, because Byrd had not presented any evidence that\nArpaio had instituted an unconstitutional policy (i.e., a policy\nof conducting searches for an unconstitutional purpose or in\nan unconstitutional manner), and there was no allegation that\nArpaio had personally conducted or supervised the search, the\ndistrict court held that Arpaio was entitled to judgment as a\nmatter of law, notwithstanding the remaining factual disputes.\n\n   This left one remaining defendant, Cadet O’Connell. The\ndistrict court concluded that the factual disputes over the pur-\npose of the search and the manner in which it was conducted\nshould be decided by the jury. The court held that if the jury\nfound that the County had conducted the search for an identi-\nfied security need, and if the jury found that O’Connell had\nnot conducted the search in an inappropriate manner (i.e., by\nintentionally squeezing or kneading Byrd’s penis or scrotum,\nor improperly touching his anus through his underwear), then\n  5\n   Rule 50 provides:\n      If a party has been fully heard on an issue during a jury trial and\n      the court finds that a reasonable jury would not have a legally\n      sufficient evidentiary basis to find for the party on that issue, the\n      court may: (A) resolve the issue against the party; and (B) grant\n      a motion for judgment as a matter of law against the party on a\n      claim or defense that, under the controlling law, can be main-\n      tained or defeated only with a favorable finding on that issue.\nFed. R. Civ. P. 50(a)(1).\n\f5914        BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T\nthe search would violate neither Byrd’s substantive due pro-\ncess nor his Fourth Amendment rights as a matter of law. The\ncourt denied Byrd’s cross motions for judgment as a matter of\nlaw.\n\n   In light of these rulings, the district court submitted three\nissues to the jury: (1) whether Byrd had proved that\nO’Connell “deprived him of his right against unreasonable\nsearch[es] by intentionally squeezing or kneading his penis or\nscrotum or improperly touching his anus through his under-\nwear”; (2) whether O’Connell deprived Byrd of due process\nof law by taking any inappropriate actions during the search,6\nwhich actions had inflicted pain on Byrd, and which infliction\nwas wanton; and (3) whether O’Connell violated Byrd’s right\nagainst unreasonable searches “by conducting a search not\ndone for [an] identified security need.” The district court\ninstructed the jury that it could draw an inference adverse to\na party who destroyed evidence, but declined to give the\ninstruction proposed by Byrd’s counsel.\n\n   The jury found against Byrd on each of the issues, and the\ncourt entered judgment for all defendants. This timely appeal\nfollowed. On appeal, Byrd challenges the district court’s dis-\nmissal of his equal protection claim, certain evidentiary rul-\nings, and its grant of judgment as a matter of law in favor of\nArpaio and O’Connell as to the constitutionality of the search.7\n\n                                    II\n\n  [1] We first address whether the district court erred in its\n  6\n    As in the first issue, the jury was instructed to determine whether\n“O’Connell intentionally squeezed or kneaded [Byrd’s] penis or scrotum\nor improperly touched his anus through his underwear.”\n  7\n    We reject the County’s assertion that the issues on appeal are limited\nby rules governing in forma pauperis proceedings. See 28 U.S.C. § 1915.\nByrd did not proceed in forma pauperis in bringing his appeal, and this\ncourt’s records reflect that all appropriate fees have been paid.\n\f           BYRD v.

We con-\nsider these issues in turn.\n\n                               A\n\n   First, Byrd argues the district court erred by permitting the\nCounty to introduce the Video Yearbook. According to Byrd,\nthe video was irrelevant because it does not include footage\nof O’Connell searching Byrd, or indeed, of O’Connell con-\nducting any of the searches she performed that day. More-\nover, Byrd argues that the video was prejudicial because it\npresented the cadets in a highly flattering light. Finally, Byrd\nasserts that the Video Yearbook was misleading because\nsearches depicted in the video showed cadets performing fully\nclothed searches on their supervisors, rather than the search of\nByrd in his underwear. Byrd contends that the prejudicial and\nmisleading effect of the video outweighs its limited or non-\nexistent probative value, and therefore, the district court\nabused its discretion by allowing it to be shown to the jury.\n\n  [3] We disagree. Evidence that is otherwise admissible may\nbe excluded if “its probative value is substantially outweighed\n\f           BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T           5917\nby the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or\nmisleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay,\nwaste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evi-\ndence.” Fed.

However, evidence that may have\nbeen otherwise excluded under Rule 403 may become admis-\nsible based on events at trial. “Under the rule of curative\nadmissibility, or the ‘opening the door’ doctrine, the introduc-\ntion of inadmissible evidence by one party allows an oppo-\nnent, in the court’s discretion, to introduce evidence on the\nsame issue to rebut any false impression that might have\nresulted from the earlier admission.” United States v.

In his opening statement, Byrd’s counsel indicated\nthat the County’s alleged destruction of the tape would be an\nissue at trial, stating, “You will learn that this training demon-\nstration on Mr. Byrd was videotaped but that the portion of\nthe tape has now been erased.” During direct examination, the\nfollowing exchange occurred between Arpaio and Byrd’s\ncounsel:\n\n    Q: [B]eing in law enforcement, you would agree that\n    officers must preserve all evidence which is critical\n    to inmate’s complaints.\n\n    A: Yes.\n\n    Q: And you would agree that it would be improper,\n    actually illegal, to lose evidence to cover up wrong-\n    doing; correct, sir?\n\n    A: To cover up wrongdoing?\n\f5918       BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T\n    Q: Yes.\n\n    A: Yes.\n\nBased on this line of questioning, the district court found that\nByrd’s counsel was laying the foundation for an instruction\npermitting the jury to infer that any missing evidence, namely,\nthe complete video footage recorded that day, was damaging\nto the County. Therefore, the district court held that Byrd’s\ncounsel had opened the door for the County to show the\nVideo Yearbook so the jury could determine whether the orig-\ninal video tape was likely or unlikely to contain what Byrd\nalleged. Byrd’s counsel subsequently played the video during\nclosing argument in an effort to prove the searches conducted\non the day in question were for training purposes rather than\nsecurity purposes.\n\n   [5] Because Byrd opened the door to the introduction of\nthis evidence, the district court did not abuse its broad discre-\ntion in admitting the Video Yearbook as an exhibit. See\nUnited States v. Segall, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"497045\"><a href=\"/opinion/497045/united-states-v-katherine-j-segall-aka-katherine-j-coady/\"><span class=\"volume\">833</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">144</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 148 (9th Cir. 1987).\nThe Video Yearbook was relevant to rebut Byrd’s assertion in\nopening argument, and suggestion during Arpaio’s direct\nexamination, that the original tape depicted an abusive search\nand had been improperly edited or destroyed. Moreover, Byrd\nhas not demonstrated that any unfair prejudice substantially\noutweighed the video’s value, or that the verdict would have\nbeen any different absent the video.\n\n                               B\n\n   Byrd next argues the district court erred in its formulation\nof an adverse inference instruction. Byrd requested that the\ndistrict court provide the following instruction:\n\n    The Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office video\n    recorded academy class 813’s search of the Durango\n    Jail, Housing Unit 4, on October 28, 2004. On that\n\f          BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T            5919\n    same day, Mr. Byrd filed a complaint with the Mari-\n    copa County Sheriff’s Office alleging that a female\n    cadet had sexually assaulted him. The Maricopa\n    County Sheriff’s Office erased the video footage of\n    academy class 813’s search of the Durango Jail,\n    Housing Unit 4, despite actual notice of Mr. Byrd’s\n    claims and allegations. The Maricopa County Sher-\n    iff’s Office’s destruction of the footage demonstrates\n    that the academy class’s search was done solely for\n    training purposes and that Ms. O’Connell grabbed\n    Mr. Byrd’s penis, scrotum and testicles, and inserted\n    her finger into Mr. Byrd’s anus. [altered to correct\n    the spelling of “Sheriff”].\n\nThe district court agreed to give an adverse inference instruc-\ntion, but provided the following to the jury:\n\n    A party who has timely notice of the assertion of a\n    claim has a duty to take reasonable efforts to pre-\n    serve evidence. If a party with such notice fails to\n    preserve evidence through some fault of its own, you\n    may draw an inference that the evidence not pre-\n    served would have been favorable to the opposing\n    party.\n\n   [6] Byrd argues that this instruction is inadequate because\nit did not direct the jury to make an adverse inference against\nthe County. We disagree. The district court’s instruction accu-\nrately stated the law and was adequate to allow the jury to\ndetermine whether an adverse inference against the County\nwas warranted. “A court is not required to use the exact words\nproposed by a party, incorporate every proposition of law sug-\ngested by counsel or amplify an instruction if the instructions\nas given allowed the jury to determine intelligently the issues\npresented.” Los Angeles Mem’l Coliseum Comm’n v.

Therefore, “in the absence of sub-\nstantial evidence in the record to indicate that the officials\nhave exaggerated their response to these considerations,\ncourts should ordinarily defer to their expert judgment in such\nmatters.” Id. at 540 n.23 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n   In light of these principles, our task is to determine whether\nthe district court erred in holding that, as a matter of law, nei-\nther Maricopa County nor the individual defendants\n(O’Connell and Arpaio in his individual capacity) violated\nByrd’s constitutional rights.9 We must also undertake our\nreview in light of the jury’s factual determinations that the\nsearch was performed for an “identified security need,” and\nthat O’Connell did not search Byrd in an inappropriate man-\nner. Byrd does not challenge these findings on appeal, and\ntherefore we are bound by them.\n  9\n    The defendants sued in their individual capacities did not assert quali-\nfied immunity in district court, and accordingly we do not consider the\nissue on appeal.\n\f5922       BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T\n                               A\n\n   We first consider Byrd’s argument that the search violated\nhis substantive due process right to be free from punishment.\nByrd contends the search at issue amounted to punishment\nbecause it was conducted by a woman despite the availability\nof men; he was not told that O’Connell was associated with\nthe jail system; jail officials carried taser and pepper guns,\ncursed at him, and ordered him to remain silent; and a person\nwith a hand-held camera was present. Moreover, Byrd states\nthat he suffers from a history of sexual abuse, and therefore\nthe cross-gender aspect of the search was particularly trau-\nmatic. Byrd asserts that the prison officials displayed deliber-\nate indifference to the harm the search would cause him, both\nbecause any person would know that the circumstances of this\nsearch would cause shock, degradation, and pain, and because\nthese consequences were easily preventable by having male\nofficials who were standing nearby conduct the search.\n\n   [7] When the government holds a person in confinement as\na pretrial detainee, it “may subject him to the restrictions and\nconditions of the detention facility so long as those conditions\nand restrictions do not amount to punishment or otherwise\nviolate the Constitution,” Bell, 441 U.S. at 536-37, because\n“under the Due Process Clause, a detainee may not be pun-\nished prior to an adjudication of guilt in accordance with due\nprocess of law,” id. at 535; accord Demery v.

MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T           5923\n   When prisoners challenge conditions or deprivations asso-\nciated with their confinement, a court must consider the two\ncomponents of an Eighth Amendment claim: (1) the objective\ncomponent, which addresses whether the deprivation was suf-\nficiently serious to constitute “cruel and unusual” punishment;\nand (2) the subjective component, which addresses whether\nthe prison officials acted with “a sufficiently culpable state of\nmind.” Wilson v. Seiter, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112626\"><a href=\"/opinion/112626/wilson-v-seiter/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">294</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 298 (1991). The\nSupreme Court explained that the latter intent requirement did\nnot emanate from “the predilections of this Court, but the\nEighth Amendment itself, which bans only cruel and unusual\npunishment. If the pain inflicted is not formally meted out as\npunishment by the statute or the sentencing judge, some men-\ntal element must be attributed to the inflicting officer before\nit can qualify” as punitive. Id. at 300 (emphases in original).\n\n  [8] The same intent requirement is applicable in the pretrial\ndetainee context: the Supreme Court has explained that\nwhether a particular action or condition of confinement\namounts to punishment turns on whether the action taken, or\ncondition imposed, was accompanied by punitive intent. See\nBell, 441 U.S. at 538-39.\n\n   Punitive intent may be proven in various ways. It is most\nobvious when an official expresses an intent to punish a\ndetainee. See id. at 538. When there is no evidence “of an\nexpressed intent to punish on the part of detention facility\nofficials,” punitive intent can be inferred. Id. If “a restriction\nor condition is not reasonably related to a legitimate goal—if\nit is arbitrary or purposeless—a court permissibly may infer\nthat the purpose of the governmental action is punishment that\nmay not constitutionally be inflicted upon detainees qua\ndetainees.” Id. at 539; see also Block v.

A detention facility official acts\nwith “deliberate indifference” if “he knows that inmates face\na substantial risk of serious harm and disregards that risk by\nfailing to take reasonable measures to abate it.” Farmer, 511\nU.S. at 847; accord Frost, 152 F.3d at 1128. “[T]he official\nmust both be aware of facts from which the inference could\nbe drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and he\nmust also draw the inference.” Farmer, 511 U.S. at 837.\n\n   [9] Byrd has not alleged or adduced any evidence indicat-\ning that O’Connell or Arpaio expressed an intent to punish\nhim. See Bell, 441 U.S. at 538. Therefore, in order to prevail\non his substantive due process claim, Byrd must present evi-\ndence from which an inference of punitive intent may be\ndrawn. See id. at 538-39; Farmer, 511 U.S. at 847. Byrd con-\ntends that we should draw such an inference in this case\nbecause the search in question is analogous to those we struck\ndown in Jordan v. Gardner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"601474\"><a href=\"/opinion/601474/jordan-v-gardner/\"><span class=\"volume\">986</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1521</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir. 1993)\n(en banc).\n\n   In Jordan, a prison had instituted a policy requiring “male\nguards to conduct random, non-emergency, suspicionless\nclothed body searches on female prisoners.” 986 F.2d at 1522\n(footnote omitted). The searches were aggressive and intru-\nsive:\n\n    According to the prison training material, “a guard\n    [was] to use a flat hand and pushing motion across\n    the inmate’s crotch area.” The guard [was to] “push\n    inward and upward when searching the crotch and\n    upper thighs of the inmate.” All seams in the leg and\n    the crotch area [were] to be “squeezed and kneaded.”\n\f           BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T          5925\n    Using the back of the hand, the guard also [was] to\n    search the breast area in a sweeping motion, so that\n    the breasts [would] be “flattened.”\n\nId. at 1523 (alterations and internal citations omitted).\n\n   In evaluating whether the policy in Jordan violated the\nEighth Amendment’s ban on “unnecessary and wanton inflic-\ntion of pain,” we first considered the objective component of\nan Eighth Amendment claim by addressing whether the depri-\nvation was sufficiently serious. We concluded that the district\ncourt’s finding that the searches constituted the “infliction of\npain” on the female inmates was not clearly erroneous, in\nlight of substantial evidence that many of the female inmates\nhad been violently sexually abused prior to their incarceration\nand were psychologically fragile, and that the cross-gender\nsearches would cause some inmates substantial suffering. Id.\nat 1525-26. The evidence included extensive expert testimony\nfrom “staff members, social workers, psychologists, an\nanthropologist, and the former Director of Corrections for\nfour different states at various times.” Id. at 1526. One expert\ntestified that “the unwilling submission to bodily contact with\nthe breasts and genitals by men would likely leave the inmate\n‘revictimized,’ resulting in a number of symptoms of post-\ntraumatic stress disorder.” Id. (alteration omitted). This evi-\ndence was corroborated by inmates’ testimony, as well as evi-\ndence that one inmate who was searched “had to have her\nfingers pried loose from bars she had grabbed during the\nsearch, and she vomited after returning to her cell block.” Id.\nat 1523.\n\n   We then considered the subjective component of an Eighth\nAmendment claim by addressing whether the prison officials\nhad acted with “deliberate indifference.” Id. at 1527. We con-\ncluded that they had, id. at 1530, basing this conclusion on\nevidence that the policymaker at the prison was aware of the\nrisk of psychological trauma to the female inmates, but never-\ntheless proceeded with the implementation of the search pol-\n\f5926      BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T\nicy, id. at 1528-29. Specifically, the prison policymaker “was\nurged by members of his own staff not to institute cross-\ngender clothed body searches due to the psychological trauma\nwhich many inmates likely would suffer.” Id. at 1528. In\naddition, a court order was required to stop the practice “al-\nthough one of the first inmates to be searched suffered a\nsevere reaction.” Id. at 1528-29. We also held that the search\npolicy was “unnecessary” because the facility’s “security\n[was] not dependent upon” cross-gender searches; nor did the\nsearches “ensure equal employment opportunities for male\nguards.” Id. at 1526-27.\n\n   [10] Applying the Jordan framework here, the prison offi-\ncials did not have the mental state necessary for their actions\nto constitute punishment. Taking the evidence and all infer-\nences in the light most favorable to Byrd, see Redman, 942\nF.2d at 1439, there is no evidence in the record that would\nallow a rational jury to conclude that either O’Connell or\nArpaio knew the cross-gender aspect of the search would\ncause Byrd harm, or that either of them “disregard[ed] that\nrisk by failing to take reasonable measures to abate it,” Far-\nmer, 511 U.S. at 847. Arpaio testified that in over 15 years,\nthere had never been a problem with a male being searched\nby a female, and the record does not show otherwise. Byrd\ndid not indicate to anyone at the jail before or during the\nsearch that he had a history of sexual abuse, and there is no\nevidence that anyone at the jail was aware of this history.\nMoreover, O’Connell testified that she had searched a “couple\nhundred” men in the same manner, and no man had ever\nadversely reacted to a search. Therefore, Byrd has not shown\nthat either O’Connell or Arpaio acted with deliberate indiffer-\nence in conducting the search.\n\n   Finally (and as discussed in more detail infra pp. 5934-37),\nbecause the search was reasonably related to the County’s\nlegitimate security needs, as found by the jury, and because\nthe County had a legitimate operational basis for permitting\n\f          BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T        5927\ncross-gender searches, we cannot infer that the purpose of the\nsearch was punitive. Bell, 441 U.S. at 561.\n\n   [11] Because the search was reasonably related to legiti-\nmate governmental needs, and because Byrd has pointed to no\nevidence from which a rational jury could conclude that it was\nconducted with “deliberate indifference” to pain the cross-\ngender aspect of the search might cause, it did not constitute\npunishment. Therefore we must conclude that neither Arpaio\nnor O’Connell violated Byrd’s substantive due process rights.\nCf. Jordan, 986 F.2d at 1527-30. Accordingly, we need not\nconsider the objective component of Byrd’s claim (the degree\nof deprivation or harm), or whether a pretrial detainee may be\nable to bring a Fourteenth Amendment substantive due pro-\ncess claim based on evidence of a less severe deprivation or\nharm than would be necessary to establish an Eighth Amend-\nment “cruel and unusual” punishment claim. See id. at\n1525-26.\n\n   [12] Because Byrd has suffered no substantive due process\ndeprivation, his claim against Maricopa County necessarily\nfails. Byrd has not alleged that any action apart from the\ncross-gender search performed by O’Connell violated his sub-\nstantive due process rights, and “[n]either a municipality nor\na supervisor . . . can be held liable under § 1983 where no\ninjury or constitutional violation has occurred.” Jackson v.\nCity of Bremerton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"775259\"><a href=\"/opinion/775259/jeannine-jackson-v-city-of-bremerton-paul-dufresne-police-chief-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">268</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">646</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 653 (9th Cir. 2001); see also\nCity of Los Angeles v.

In\nevaluating Fourth Amendment claims brought by incarcerated\npersons, Bell directs us to consider: (1) “the scope of the par-\nticular intrusion”; (2) “the manner in which it is conducted”;\n(3) “the justification for initiating it”; and (4) “the place in\nwhich it is conducted.” Id. In Turner, the Court provided\nmore guidance regarding Bell’s reasonableness standard,\nholding that “when a prison regulation impinges on inmates’\nconstitutional rights, the regulation is valid if it is reasonably\nrelated to legitimate penological interests.” 482 U.S. at 89.\nThe Court set forth several factors as being “relevant in deter-\nmining the reasonableness” of a prison regulation or practice:\n(1) “there must be a valid, rational connection between the\nprison regulation and the legitimate governmental interest put\nforward to justify it”; (2) “whether there are alternative means\nof exercising the right that remain open to prison inmates”;\n(3) “the impact accommodation of the asserted constitutional\nright will have on guards and other inmates, and on the alloca-\ntion of prison resources generally,” which, if the impact is\nsubstantial, requires particular deference to corrections offi-\ncials; and (4) “the absence of ready alternatives” as evidence\nof the reasonableness of a prison regulation, or “the existence\nof obvious, easy alternatives” as evidence that the regulation\n“is an ‘exaggerated response’ to prison concerns.” Id. at 89-91\n(internal citations and quotation marks omitted).\n\n   There are limits to the applicability of the reasonableness\nfactors outlined in Turner. We have not applied Turner to a\npretrial detainee’s Fourteenth Amendment claim of punish-\nment, see Demery, 378 F.3d at 1028, and Turner is not appli-\ncable to all prisoner challenges based on a deprivation of\nconstitutional rights, see Johnson v.

There is no dispute that the County’s\nsecurity-related need to respond to reports of contraband and\nfighting in Byrd’s housing unit is a “legitimate governmental\ninterest,” or that the reports of contraband and fighting are\nrationally connected to, and a valid justification for, conduct-\ning the pat down and partial strip searches. 482 U.S. at 89; see\nalso Bell, 441 U.S. at 546-47 (“Central to all other correction\ngoals is the institutional consideration of internal security\nwithin the corrections facilities themselves.” (quoting Pell v.\nProcunier, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109079\"><a href=\"/opinion/109079/pell-v-procunier/\"><span class=\"volume\">417</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">817</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 823 (1974) (alteration omitted))).11\n\n   [16] Moving to the Bell factors, the scope of the search was\nreasonable given the County’s suspicion of contraband circu-\nlating in the jail, and inmates’ ability to conceal contraband\nin private areas. In Bell, the Court held that visual body cavity\nsearches were justified by the detention facility officials’ need\nto detect contraband and maintain security, even though there\nhad been only one incident of attempted contraband smug-\ngling. 441 U.S. at 559.

We have recognized that the\n“desire to shield one’s unclothed figure[ ] from view of\nstrangers, and particularly strangers of the opposite sex, is\nimpelled by elementary self-respect and personal dignity.”\nYork v. Story, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"262291\"><a href=\"/opinion/262291/angelynn-york-v-ron-story-and-louis-moreno/\"><span class=\"volume\">324</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">450</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 455 (9th Cir. 1963); see also\nMichenfelder, 860 F.2d at 334 (stating that this court recog-\nnizes “that incarcerated prisoners retain a limited right to bod-\nily privacy” in the context of being viewed by members of the\nopposite sex); Grummet, 779 F.2d at 494 (same). Yet, while\nwe have not foreclosed the possibility that a cross-gender\nsearch could violate an incarcerated person’s constitutional\nrights, we have noted that “our prior case law suggests that\nprisoners’ legitimate expectations of bodily privacy from per-\nsons of the opposite sex are extremely limited.” Jordan, 986\nF.2d at 1524. We have never held that a cross-gender search\nin a prison setting violated an inmate’s Fourth Amendment\nrights. See Grummet, 779 F.2d at 496; Jordan, 986 F.2d at\n1524; cf. Somers v. Thurman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"738305\"><a href=\"/opinion/738305/97-cal-daily-op-serv-2114-97-cal-daily-op-serv-3975-97-daily/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">614</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 620 (9th Cir.\n1997) (in context of qualified immunity, holding right to be\nfree of cross-gender searches not clearly established). Rather,\nwe have upheld cross-gender visual observations and body\nsearches in certain circumstances.\n\n   [18] In Grummet, we upheld a policy permitting female\nofficers to conduct pat-down searches of male prisoners when\n\f           BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T           5933\nthe searches were “done briefly”; “in a professional manner\nand with respect for the inmates”; and performed on inmates\nwho were “fully clothed, and thus [did] not involve intimate\ncontact with the inmates’ bodies.” 779 F.2d at 496. The prison\ndid not require female officers to “conduct or observe strip or\nbody cavity searches” except in emergencies. Id. We addition-\nally upheld a policy when women were assigned to positions\nrequiring “infrequent and casual observation” of unclothed\nmale prisoners in their cells and while showering. Id. at 494.\nWe noted that preventing females from working in positions\nthat would require occasional invasions of inmates’ privacy\n“would necessitate a tremendous rearrangement of work\nschedules, and possibly produce a risk to both internal secur-\nity needs and equal employment opportunities for the female\nguards.” Id. at 496. Under these circumstances, we concluded\nthat “the inmates have not demonstrated that these restricted\nobservations by members of the opposite sex are so degrading\nas to require intervention by this court,” id. at 495, or that the\nsearches were “so offensive as to be unreasonable under the\nfourth amendment,” id. at 496.\n\n   [19] In Michenfelder, we rejected a prisoner’s argument\nthat a prison invaded his right to privacy due to a policy per-\nmitting the presence of female officers during visual body\ncavity searches in hallways, and permitting females to work\nin positions that allowed observation of unclothed male\ninmates. 860 F.2d at 334. In determining whether the policies\nwere reasonably related to legitimate penological interests, we\n“recognize[d] as legitimate both the interest in providing\nequal employment opportunities and the security interest in\ndeploying available staff effectively.” Id. We upheld the strip-\nsearch policy because female officers were not “routinely\npresent for [the] strip searches” and did not “regularly or fre-\nquently observe unclothed inmates without a legitimate rea-\nson for doing so.” Id. We also upheld females’ placement in\npositions that included “shower duty,” because female offi-\ncers’ presence “did not establish an inappropriate amount of\ncontact with disrobed prisoners.” Id. We reasoned, in part,\n\f5934       BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T\nthat “[p]rohibiting female employees from working” in areas\nthat allowed observation of unclothed inmates, or “requiring\n[female employees] to be replaced by males for the duration\nof strip searches, would displace officers throughout the pris-\non.” Id. (stating that the “third Turner v. Safley factor has spe-\ncial relevance here”).\n\n   Byrd argues the search in question is distinguishable from\nthose we upheld in Michenfelder and Grummet. He contends\nthe cross-gender aspect of the specific search at issue was not\nreasonable, but rather was an “ ‘exaggerated response’ to\nprison concerns,” Turner, 482 U.S. at 90, because of the inva-\nsiveness of the search and the ready availability of male offi-\ncials to conduct it. Because the male officials were\nimmediately available, he asserts there would have been no\nimpact on the jail’s allocation of resources or on its procedure\nfor meeting security needs if a male, rather than a female, had\nsearched him. Byrd further argues that the cross-gender ele-\nment of the search was not justified by the County’s need to\nprovide equal employment opportunities to female prison\nofficials. He cites testimony from County witnesses that they\nwere not aware of any incident in which a female officer’s\nemployment opportunities were hampered as a result of\naccommodations to protect the privacy interests of male\ndetainees.\n\n   [20] Even taking all facts and inferences therefrom in\nByrd’s favor, however, we cannot conclude that the manner\nof the search was unreasonable, or constituted an “exagger-\nated or excessive means to enforce security.” Thompson, 111\nF.3d at 700 (internal quotation marks omitted). As noted, the\njury found that the search was not done in an inappropriate\nmanner. The record indicates that O’Connell wore gloves at\nall times, and conducted the search professionally and swiftly,\nfinishing in, at most, 60 seconds. The invasion of Byrd’s bod-\nily privacy in this case does not substantially exceed the\ncross-gender observations and searches we upheld in Michen-\nfelder and Grummet. Moreover, the County has provided a\n\f           BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T         5935\nlegitimate justification for the cross-gender aspect of the\nsearch: the County adduced undisputed evidence that the\ncross-gender search was justified by its legitimate security\nand staffing needs, focusing primarily on the shortage of ade-\nquate personnel. Captain Peterson testified that the County\ndid not have sufficient numbers of male detention officers to\nconduct searches of male inmates, as required to meet safety\nand security needs, without the assistance of female officers.\nFurther, Peterson testified that the County was not able to\nobtain a greater number of male officers for these searches\nbecause it had difficulties hiring adequate staff, and because\nit could not pull male officers from other jail facilities.\nCadets, including females, were regularly called to assist in\nmass searches “because of [the need for] additional man-\npower, and we have no other place to get it from except” from\nthe Academy. We have held that the County has a legitimate\n“security interest in deploying available staff effectively.”\nMichenfelder, 860 F.2d at 334. Accordingly, we cannot con-\nclude that the cross-gender search lacked a “valid, rational\nconnection” to the County’s legitimate justifications. Turner,\n482 U.S. at 89.\n\n   Turning to the impact that accommodation of Byrd’s\nFourth Amendment rights would have “on the allocation of\nprison resources generally,” id. at 90, Byrd contends that the\nsearch was an “ ‘exaggerated response’ to prison concerns”\nbecause the presence of male officials at the search provided\n“an alternative that fully accommodates the prisoner’s right at\nde minimis cost to valid penological interests,” id. at 90-91.\nThis argument goes too far. A detention facility that hires\nboth male and female officers to meet its staffing needs will\nregularly have male officers, as well as female officers, avail-\nable at searches. The determination sought by Byrd, that it is\nper se unreasonable for a female officer to conduct searches\nof male inmates when male officers are also present, would\nsignificantly limit the usefulness of female officers for meet-\ning a detention facility’s security needs. In this case, such a\ndetermination would be inconsistent with the County’s\n\f5936       BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T\napproach to staffing and deploying its officers, and contrary\nto the County’s uncontradicted testimony that it has inade-\nquate male staff to meet its security needs, and must therefore\nuse both male and female officials to conduct searches on\nmale inmates.\n\n   [21] Moreover, the County has already made a determina-\ntion regarding when it can reasonably accommodate cross-\ngender concerns: its policies prohibit cross-gender observa-\ntion and administration of unclothed strip and body cavity\nsearches, and its policies prohibit visual inspection of\ninmates’ genitalia during a cross-gender pat down and partial\nstrip search. In light of the jury’s findings, and the “wide-\nranging deference” we owe to the County’s professional judg-\nment on these operational issues, Bell, 441 U.S. at 547, we\nconclude that the cross-gender search in question was not an\nexaggerated response to prison concerns.\n\n   We emphasize that the question whether the district court\nerred in granting the County’s motion for judgment as a mat-\nter of law is close. We are troubled by the overall circum-\nstances of the search in question. The scope of the search was\ninvasive in that it involved contact with Byrd’s genital region,\nalbeit through his boxer shorts. The embarrassment inherent\nin such a pat down and partial strip search was amplified by\nseveral factors: the cross-gender aspect; the fact that it took\nplace in the presence of many officers and cadets, one third\nof whom were female; and that it took place in the presence\nof a person with a hand-held camera, notwithstanding the fact\nthat the record does not give rise to the inference that Byrd’s\nsearch was recorded.\n\n   Yet, while prisoners and detainees retain “legitimate expec-\ntations of bodily privacy from persons of the opposite sex,”\nwe are obligated to acknowledge that such rights are “ex-\ntremely limited.” Jordan, 986 F.2d at 1524. The hallmark of\nthe Fourth Amendment is reasonableness, see, e.g., Bell, 441\nU.S. at 558, and we must assess reasonableness in the context\n\f           BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T          5937\nof detention settings and the intractable problems facing\nprison administrators, see, e.g., Turner, 482 U.S. at 84-89. We\nreview this case in the additional light of the jury’s findings\nthat the search was not conducted in an inappropriate manner\nand that it was conducted for an identified security need; the\nundisputed evidence of the County’s staffing issues; and the\nCounty’s existing restrictions on cross-gender contact\nbetween detention officers and inmates. We also take seri-\nously the Supreme Court’s direction that, in reviewing\nsecurity- and operations-related restrictions or conditions\nimposed by prisons, “courts must heed our warning that ‘such\nconsiderations are peculiarly within the province and profes-\nsional expertise of corrections officials, and, in the absence of\nsubstantial evidence in the record to indicate that the officials\nhave exaggerated their response to these considerations,\ncourts should ordinarily defer to their expert judgment in such\nmatters.’ ” Bell, 441 U.S. at 540 n.23 (quoting Pell, 417 U.S.\nat 827 (alteration omitted)). Given these factors, even viewing\nthe facts (other than those found by the jury) in the light most\nfavorable to Byrd, we cannot conclude that the district court\nerred in determining that the search did not violate Byrd’s\nFourth Amendment rights.\n\n  The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\nFERNANDEZ, Circuit Judge, concurring and dissenting:\n\n   I concur in part and dissent in part. In particular, I concur\nin most of the well reasoned majority opinion, but dissent\nfrom the determination in part IVB that the cross-gender\nsearch was reasonable under the circumstances and was not a\nviolation of the Fourth Amendment.\n\n  In my view, cross-gender strip searches are generally\nuncalled for and unreasonable. We have never held that any\ncross-gender strip search is proper, although we have allowed\n\f5938         BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T\nfor situations where female guards can observe unclothed\nmale prisoners,1 and have even approved of the pat down of\nfully clothed male prisoners by female guards.2 Moreover, in\none case we determined that a cross-gender search of clothed\nfemale prisoners by male guards was unconstitutional under\nthe circumstances presented in that case, but the basis of our\ndecision was not the Fourth Amendment. See Jordan v.\nGardner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"601474\"><a href=\"/opinion/601474/jordan-v-gardner/\"><span class=\"volume\">986</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1521</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1523-26 (9th Cir. 1993) (en banc).\n\n   I do not suggest that a cross-gender strip search can never\nbe appropriate. There may be emergency or other situations\nwhere a cross-gender strip search is proper, but this case pre-\nsents no facts to suggest that there was an emergency or some\nother unique reason for authorizing the search. In fact, the\nrecord shows that this sort of search is a regular part of the\njail’s routine,3 and that there were plenty of men available,\nwho could have conducted the search.4\n\n  When all is said and done, I would not think it was reason-\nable for males to strip search females in this kind of situation,\nand I do not think it was reasonable to have females strip\nsearch males. If our law does approve of it, and the majority\nopinion cogently reasons that it does, I reluct; the law should\nchange.\n  1\n     See Michenfelder v.

Pat searches and cell searches are always together and\nroutinely performed for security purposes about four times a month.” It is\ninteresting to note that the County, throughout, insists that this strip search\nwas merely a pat search. It shrinks from suggesting that cross-gender strip\nsearches would be appropriate under these circumstances.\n   4\n     For example, O’Connell testified that of some thirty-two to forty-five\ncadets on hand only a couple were females.\n\f          BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T      5939\n  Thus, I respectfully dissent in that respect and otherwise\nconcur in the majority opinion.\n\f</pre>",
