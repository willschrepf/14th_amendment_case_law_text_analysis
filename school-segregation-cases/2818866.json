Rhode<br><br>        Island Hospital  Trust National  Bank [\"Hospital Trust\"],  the lender,<br><br>        sued for  repayment and  for the  appointment  of a  receiver to  take<br><br>        control  of the Companies' assets,  including their FCC  licenses.

Howard,  approached Hospital<br><br>        Trust's  Broadcast Lending Division in  an effort to  refinance a $1.1<br><br>        million  bank  loan then  held by  Old  Stone Bank.    After extensive<br><br>        negotiations, Hospital  Trust officials  agreed to lend  the Companies<br><br>        $2.65 million  to refinance the loan and to pursue a program of expan-<br><br>        sion.  A Loan Agreement and  Revolving Credit and Term Note (hereinaf-<br><br>        ter, collectively, the \"loan agreement\") were  duly executed by Robert<br><br>        Howard, as president of the  Companies, on October 28, 1988.   Concur-<br><br>        rently, appellants, as co-owners of the Companies, executed a Guaranty<br><br>        Agreement under  which they personally guaranteed  the Companies' loan<br><br>        agreement  obligations.   Until  September 30, 1989,  appellants  were<br><br>        answerable under their guaranty whenever the Companies failed  to make<br><br>        any payment in full, as it came due.  After that date, appellants were<br><br>        liable on  the occurrence  of an  event of  default, as defined  under<br><br>          5.08 of the loan agreement.  Howard and  Robb reluctantly signed the<br><br>        guaranty at the insistence  of Hospital Trust, in order  to permit the<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>                            <br>        ____________________<br><br>        2Other  so-called \"facts,\" presented by appellants  for the first time<br>        on appeal,  were not before the district court and will not be consid-<br>        ered on appeal.  See Fed. R. App. Proc. 10(a).<br>                         ___<br><br>                                          4<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>        loan  transaction to  go forward.   In  all significant  respects, the<br><br>        guaranty was valid and enforceable on its face.3<br><br>                  No loan payments were made after January 30, 1990.  On April<br><br>        17, 1990, the Companies admitted their inability to make loan payments<br><br>        in a timely manner,  and on June 26,  1990, the Companies admitted  an<br><br>        event  of default under   5.08 of the loan agreement, thereby trigger-<br><br>        ing  appellants' liability on their guaranty.  On October 17, Hospital<br><br>        Trust  brought an action against the Companies under their loan agree-<br><br>        ment, and against appellants on the guaranty.<br><br>                  In  February  1991, following  several  unsuccessful workout<br><br>        attempts,  Hospital Trust moved for  the appointment of  a receiver to<br><br>        liquidate the  Companies' assets  in satisfaction  of the  unpaid loan<br><br>        balance.  At the hearing held  on the motion for the appointment  of a<br><br>        receiver in July 1991,  Robb orally represented to the  district court<br><br>        that $2 million had been \"segregated to [appellants'] account\" for the<br><br>        purpose of settling the  loan dispute.  The court  granted appellants'<br><br>        request to  defer the  appointment of  a receiver,  but no funds  were<br><br>        forthcoming.  On  August 5, Howard filed an affidavit  in support of a<br><br>        further  request for deferral of the appointment of a receiver, repre-<br><br>        senting to  the court that the  funds would be available  on or before<br>                            <br>        ____________________<br><br>        3Appellants now state that they understood that the guaranty would not<br>        be enforced, that it was \"for appearances only.\"  They state that this<br>        understanding was  reinforced by  Hospital Trust's failure     through<br>        accident  or design    to  specify the \"minimum  net worth\" appellants<br>        would be required to maintain  in order to protect the bank's  ability<br>        to collect  on their guaranty.  Appellants  say they believed that the<br>        omission of the \"minimum  net worth\" term rendered the  guaranty \"void<br>        on its face.\"  See infra pp. 8-9. <br>                       ___ _____<br><br>                                          5<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>        August 15.   Again the court  acceded, but no funds  were forthcoming.<br><br>        On  August 23, the court appointed Robert Maccini, a media consultant,<br><br>        as receiver, effective August  26, and directed him to  obtain control<br><br>        of the Companies'  properties, including their  FCC licenses.   Appel-<br><br>        lants were enjoined  to cooperate  in the delivery  of the  Companies'<br>                   ________  __ _________<br><br>        properties and to refrain from \"disturb[ing] or imped[ing] the receiv-<br><br>        er in the performance of his duties in any way.\"<br><br>                  The procedural plot deepened on  August 26, when Howard  and<br><br>        Robb moved to stay  enforcement of the receivership order  pending FCC<br><br>        approval of the  receiver's succession  to the  radio station  license<br><br>        rights.  The motion was  denied.  Although Howard and Robb  could have<br><br>        appealed the receivership  order, see 28 U.S.C.    1292(a)(2) (confer-<br>                                          ___<br><br>        ring appellate jurisdiction of interlocutory appeals from receivership<br><br>        orders), no  appeal was  taken.   Instead, on  August  28, chapter  11<br><br>        petitions were filed in behalf of the  Companies, which resulted in an<br><br>        automatic stay of the  district court receivership proceedings against<br><br>        the  Companies.  See  11 U.S.C.    362(a)(1).  In  accordance with FCC<br>                         ___<br><br>        regulations, see 47 C.F.R. 21-11(d), Howard and Robb thereupon submit-<br>                     ___<br><br>        ted a Transfer of Control Application to the FCC requesting authoriza-<br><br>        tion  to transfer  the radio  station licenses  to the  Companies, qua<br>                                                                           ___<br><br>        debtors-in-possession.<br><br>                  As the  district court  proceedings against Howard  and Robb<br><br>        were unaffected  by the Companies'  initiation of chapter  11 proceed-<br><br>        ings, see, e.g.,  In re Supermercado  Gamboa, Inc., 68  B.R. 230,  232<br>              ___  ____   ________________________________<br><br>        (Bankr.

See  11 U.S.C.    362(c)(1) &amp; (2)(B).   The<br>                                   ___<br><br>        receiver accordingly  moved to take  control of the  Companies' assets<br><br>        and, on or about  January 17, 1992, in order to assume  control of the<br><br>        FCC  licenses from the former debtors-in-possession, forwarded license<br><br>        transfer applications to Howard and Robb for execution.  Howard signed<br><br>        the  transfer  applications on  January 22  and  returned them  to the<br><br>        receiver on January 28.  In the meantime, however, on January 20, Robb<br><br>        had filed  a separate  set of  license transfer  applications, seeking<br>                     ________<br><br>        authorization to  retransfer the FCC licenses from  the Companies, qua<br>                                                                           ___<br><br>        debtors-in-possession, to the Companies, qua former debtors-in-posses-<br>                                                 ___<br><br>        sion.   Moreover,  Robb  notified  the receiver  that  the  receiver's<br><br>        license transfer  applications should  not be filed  until appellants'<br><br>        applications had \"cleared\" the FCC.

In  all significant  respects, the<br><br>        guaranty was valid and enforceable on its face.3<br><br>                  No loan payments were made after January 30, 1990.  On April<br><br>        17, 1990, the Companies admitted their inability to make loan payments<br><br>        in a timely manner,  and on June 26,  1990, the Companies admitted  an<br><br>        event  of default under   5.08 of the loan agreement, thereby trigger-<br><br>        ing  appellants' liability on their guaranty.  On October 17, Hospital<br><br>        Trust  brought an action against the Companies under their loan agree-<br><br>        ment, and against appellants on the guaranty.<br><br>                  In  February  1991, following  several  unsuccessful workout<br><br>        attempts,  Hospital Trust moved for  the appointment of  a receiver to<br><br>        liquidate the  Companies' assets  in satisfaction  of the  unpaid loan<br><br>        balance.  At the hearing held  on the motion for the appointment  of a<br><br>        receiver in July 1991,  Robb orally represented to the  district court<br><br>        that $2 million had been \"segregated to [appellants'] account\" for the<br><br>        purpose of settling the  loan dispute.  The court  granted appellants'<br><br>        request to  defer the  appointment of  a receiver,  but no funds  were<br><br>        forthcoming.  On  August 5, Howard filed an affidavit  in support of a<br><br>        further  request for deferral of the appointment of a receiver, repre-<br><br>        senting to  the court that the  funds would be available  on or before<br>                            <br>        ____________________<br><br>        3Appellants now state that they understood that the guaranty would not<br>        be enforced, that it was \"for appearances only.\"  They state that this<br>        understanding was  reinforced by  Hospital Trust's failure     through<br>        accident  or design    to  specify the \"minimum  net worth\" appellants<br>        would be required to maintain  in order to protect the bank's  ability<br>        to collect  on their guaranty.  Appellants  say they believed that the<br>        omission of the \"minimum  net worth\" term rendered the  guaranty \"void<br>        on its face.\"  See infra pp. 8-9. <br>                       ___ _____<br><br>                                          5<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>        August 15.   Again the court  acceded, but no funds  were forthcoming.<br><br>        On  August 23, the court appointed Robert Maccini, a media consultant,<br><br>        as receiver, effective August  26, and directed him to  obtain control<br><br>        of the Companies'  properties, including their  FCC licenses.

The motion was  denied.  Although Howard and Robb  could have<br><br>        appealed the receivership  order, see 28 U.S.C.    1292(a)(2) (confer-<br>                                          ___<br><br>        ring appellate jurisdiction of interlocutory appeals from receivership<br><br>        orders), no  appeal was  taken.   Instead, on  August  28, chapter  11<br><br>        petitions were filed in behalf of the  Companies, which resulted in an<br><br>        automatic stay of the  district court receivership proceedings against<br><br>        the  Companies.

See  11 U.S.C.    362(c)(1) &amp; (2)(B).   The<br>                                   ___<br><br>        receiver accordingly  moved to take  control of the  Companies' assets<br><br>        and, on or about  January 17, 1992, in order to assume  control of the<br><br>        FCC  licenses from the former debtors-in-possession, forwarded license<br><br>        transfer applications to Howard and Robb for execution.  Howard signed<br><br>        the  transfer  applications on  January 22  and  returned them  to the<br><br>        receiver on January 28.  In the meantime, however, on January 20, Robb<br><br>        had filed  a separate  set of  license transfer  applications, seeking<br>                     ________<br><br>        authorization to  retransfer the FCC licenses from  the Companies, qua<br>                                                                           ___<br><br>        debtors-in-possession, to the Companies, qua former debtors-in-posses-<br>                                                 ___<br><br>        sion.   Moreover,  Robb  notified  the receiver  that  the  receiver's<br><br>        license transfer  applications should  not be filed  until appellants'<br><br>        applications had \"cleared\" the FCC.  The  receiver's transfer applica-<br><br>        tions were not filed with the FCC until February 4.  On February 9, in<br><br>        response to the filing of the receiver's license transfer applications<br><br>        with  the FCC, appellants filed a so-called \"Transferor's Statement of<br><br>        Circumstances,\" signed  by Robb  and supported by  Howard's affidavit.<br><br>        The statement  and affidavit  opposed the receiver's  license transfer<br><br>                            <br>        ____________________<br><br>        4Under their guaranty,  Howard and  Robb waived any  right to  require<br>        that Hospital Trust  proceed against  the Companies in  the first  in-<br>        stance.<br><br>                                          7<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>        applications and alleged a litany of illegal and abusive activities on<br><br>        the  part  of the  receiver.   The  district  court later  found these<br><br>        accusations  false,  misleading,  and violative  of  the  receivership<br><br>        order.<br><br>                  Simultaneously with the filing of the Transferor's Statement<br><br>        of Circumstances, the FCC  received a so-called \"Petition to  Deny and<br><br>        Impose Forfeiture,\" signed by  \"Denise Harris\" and purportedly submit-<br><br>        ted in behalf of  the \"HCC/CRP Creditors Committee.\"   Although appel-<br><br>        lants'  names do not appear on the \"petition,\" upon further investiga-<br><br>        tion  it  was discovered  that Denise  Harris  was a  receptionist for<br><br>        Robb's  law firm.   The  creditors  committee petition  reiterated the<br><br>        false  allegations against  the  receiver, urged  disallowance of  the<br><br>        request for transfer of  the Companies' licenses to the  receiver, and<br><br>        recommended imposition  of \"the highest possible  penalty\" against the<br><br>        receiver and Hospital Trust.   If the HCC/CRP Creditors  Committee was<br><br>        anything other than  a vehicle  utilized by appellants  to impede  the<br><br>        license transfer to the court-appointed receiver, the  record does not<br><br>        substantiate it.    In any  event,  Howard and  Robb now  admit  their<br><br>        responsibility for filing  the petition  signed by  Harris, which  the<br><br>        district court found to be a flagrant violation of its order enjoining<br><br>        appellants to  refrain from  \"disturb[ing] or imped[ing]  the receiver<br><br>        . . . .\"<br><br>                  On  April 1,  the district  court found  Howard and  Robb in<br><br>        civil  contempt for  interposing (1)  the unnecessary  post-bankruptcy<br><br>        license  retransfer, (2)  the creditors  committee's petition  through<br><br>                                          8<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>        Harris,  and  (3) the  \"Statement of  Circumstances\" opposing  the FCC<br><br>        license  transfer to the receiver.
