The\nSprehes properly segregated their attorneys’ fees in accordance with Texas\nSupreme Court precedent. As such, there was sufficient evidence to support the\ntrial court’s award of attorneys’ fees to the Sprehes.\n\n\n\n\n                                       5\n\f                          STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n      Appellant Enterprising Gals of Texas, L.L.C. (“Enterprising”) filed this\n\nlawsuit on July18, 2014 against its former employee, Appellee Angelica Sprehe\n\n(“Angelica”), her husband, Appellee Ryan Sprehe (“Ryan”), and their company,\n\nAppellee ARS Wheel Repair, Inc. (“ARS”) (collectively, the “Sprehes”) [CR 7-\n\n11]. Enterprising sued the Sprehes because they set up a competing wheel repair\n\ncompany. [CR 11-12].\n\n      Because Angelica did not have a covenant not to compete or, in fact, any\n\nwritten employment agreement [CR 1137, 1182-83], Enterprising sought to\n\nindirectly prohibit competition by suing the Sprehes for alleged misappropriation\n\nand theft of trade secrets [CR 13, 16]. Although Enterprising plead its claims\n\nbroadly, it ultimately admitted that its trade secret claims were limited to: (1)\n\nAngelica’s knowledge of the identity, telephone numbers and possibly email\n\naddress of some of the decision-makers for some of its customers, and (2)\n\nAngelica’s knowledge regarding the amount charged for each wheel repair and the\n\namount of the rebate given to certain customers at the end of the month if they\n\nmaintained a certain volume of business. [CR 1153].\n\n      Despite the enactment of the Texas Uniform Trade Secrets Act, TEX. CIV.\n\nPRAC. & REM. CODE 134A.001, et. seq. (“TUTSA”) in 2013, Enterprising chose to\n\nfile suit against the Sprehes for theft of trade secrets under the Texas Theft\n\n\n\n                                      6\n\fLiability Act (“TTLA”), hoping to avail itself of the TTLA’s mandatory prevailing\n\nparty attorneys’ fee provision. [CR 16].\n\n      On August 20, 2014, the trial court ordered the Sprehes to deliver “files\n\nrelated in any way to Plaintiff, Plaintiff’s confidential information and trade\n\nsecrets, and the wheel repair business.” [CR 66-68]. Inspection of the devices was\n\nordered to be performed by Plaintiff’s expert, Protegga LLC (“Protegga”). [CR\n\n308-11]. Although Protegga received a number of electronic devices from the\n\nSprehes in January of 2015, it did not prepare its preliminary report until July 2015\n\nand did not prepare its final report until November 2015, at least in part due to non-\n\npayment by Enterprising for its work. [RR Vol. 9, pp. 165-167].1\n\n      Enterprising did not serve any written discovery other than requests for\n\ndisclosures until October 12, 2015, almost fifteen months after the lawsuit was\n\nfiled. [CR 965-66]. Enterprising did not move to compel production of the\n\ndocuments it requested or seek to obtain additional information from the Sprehes’\n\nelectronic devices until June 9, 2016 [CR965], almost seven months after\n\nresponses to its document requests were served [CR 965-67], and almost fifteen\n\nmonths after Protegga had obtained images of the electronic devices at issue. [RR\n\nVol. 9, pp. 30-31, 165-167]. Enterprising’s motion to compel was filed eleven\n\n\n1\n  RR Vol. 9 is not sequentially numbered in the same manner as other volumes of\nthe Reporter’s Record. As such, the page numbers for RR Vol. 9 herein refer to\nthe PDF page numbers, as if the RR Vol. 9 had been sequentially numbered.\n\n                                        7\n\fmonths after Protegga’s initial report in July 2015. [RR Vol. 9, pp. 102-103, 200-\n\n212].\n\n        On July 20, 2016, the trial court granted Enterprising’s motion to compel\n\ndocuments and authorized Protegga to search images of the Sprehes’ electronic\n\ndevices for certain categories of documents [CR 1122]. In response to the trial\n\ncourt’s order, the Sprehes produced approximately 9,000 pages of invoices and\n\npayment receipts responsive to Enterprising’s document requests. [RR Vols. 10-\n\n13]. Enterprising did not request, and the trial court did not order the Sprehes to\n\nproduce, QuickBooks reports. [RR Vol. 5, pp. 26-27]. On August 31, 2016,\n\nProtegga’s representative confirmed that Enterprising had not requested that\n\nProtegga perform the analysis authorized by the trial court. [RR Vol. 9, p. 65].\n\n        Over the course of twenty-one months, the trial court granted Enterprising\n\nthree separate continuances with respect to the Sprehes’ motion for summary\n\njudgment. The Sprehes first moved for summary judgment on November 20, 2014\n\n[CR 176] and attempted to have the matter heard on heard on January 2, 2015.\n\n[CR 289]. The trial court granted Enterprising a continuance [CR 289]. The\n\nSprehes again set their motion for summary Judgment for hearing eight months\n\nlater, on August 18, 2015. [CR 416]. Enterprising filed a second motion for\n\ncontinuance [CR 326], which the trial court granted. [CR 416]. On October 12,\n\n2015, the trial court entered a scheduling order setting a discovery cut-off of\n\n\n\n                                        8\n\fNovember 18, 2015, and a dispositive motion deadline of February 15, 2016. [CR\n\n417]. Following expiration of the November 15, 2015, discovery cut-off, the\n\nSprehes again sought to have their motion for summary judgment heard on\n\nDecember 17, 2015, over fourteen months after it was originally filed. [RR, Vol. 4,\n\np. 4]. Enterprising sought a third continuance [CR 422], which the trial court\n\ngranted [CR 795].\n\n      On February 3, 2016, the Court entered a new Agreed Scheduling Order\n\nsetting a discovery cut-off of September 12, 2016, and a dispositive motions\n\ndeadline of September 30, 2016. [CR 805-809]. The Agreed Scheduling Order set\n\nthe case for trial on October 31, 2016. [CR 805]. Following expiration of this\n\nsecond discovery deadline, the Sprehes timely filed an Amended Motion for\n\nSummary Judgment (seeking summary judgment on both traditional and no-\n\nevidence grounds) [CR 1135], which they set for hearing on September 29, 2016.\n\n[RR. Vol. 7, p. 4-5]. On September 22, 2016, Enterprising filed a fourth motion\n\nfor continuance of the summary judgment hearing [CR 1530], but it did set that\n\nmotion for hearing. [RR. Vol. 7, p. 4-5]. Enterprising failed to verify its motion\n\nfor continuance and, as a result, did not present the requisite sworn testimony\n\nnecessary to support a request for a continuance. [CR 1560]. The trial court\n\ndenied Enterprising’s request for a continuance [RR Vol. 7, p. 47] and granted the\n\nSprehes’ Amended Motion for Summary Judgment [CR 1741, 1758].\n\n\n\n                                       9\n\f      The case was called for a bench trial on November 2, 2016. [RR Vol. 8, p.\n\n1]. The only remaining cause of action was the Sprehes’ claim for attorneys’ fees\n\nas the prevailing party on Enterprising’s claim under the Texas Theft Liability Act\n\n[CR 1748]. The Sprehes presented testimony from their expert witness, Eric Haas.\n\n[RR, Vol. 8, p. 25]. Mr. Haas testified regarding his qualifications to render an\n\nexpert opinion on the amount, reasonableness, and necessity of the attorneys’ fees\n\nincurred by the Sprehes in defending against Enterprising’s TTLA claim. [RR,\n\nVol. 8, pp. 27-29]. Mr. Haas testified that he was familiar with rates charged by\n\nattorneys in the geographic region for performing similar services. [RR, Vol. 8, pp.\n\n29-30]. Mr. Haas also testified that he had reviewed the standards that the Texas\n\nSupreme Court has articulated for evaluation of the reasonableness and necessity\n\nof attorneys’ fees. [RR, Vol. 8, pp. 29-30].\n\n      Mr. Haas testified that he reviewed the pleadings and other filings in the\n\nlitigation and that he was familiar with the activities performed by attorneys in the\n\nmatter because he was also an attorney of record in the matter. [RR, Vol. 8, pp.\n\n31-32]. Mr. Haas also testified that he had reviewed the tasks performed by prior\n\nattorneys who represented the Sprehes in this matter. [RR, Vol. 8, pp. 31-32]. Mr.\n\nHaas testified that he had reviewed the invoices outlining the tasks performed by\n\nthe attorneys working on matter and that he was familiar with the qualifications\n\nand experience of the attorneys’ performing the tasks. [RR, Vol. 8, pp. 31-33].\n\n\n\n                                       10\n\fMr. Haas testified that he reviewed the hourly rates charged for each attorneys’\n\nwork and that, in his opinion such hourly rates were reasonable and appropriate,\n\nconsidering the factors articulated by the Texas Supreme Court. [RR, Vol. 8, pp.\n\n33-41]. Mr. Haas also testified that the services performed by each attorney were\n\nappropriate for their skill level. [RR, Vol. 8, p. 41].\n\n      Mr. Haas testified that he evaluated the total number of hours expended by\n\nall attorneys’ in the litigation and all expenses incurred by the Sprehes. [RR, Vol.\n\n8, pp. 42-43]. Mr. Haas testified that the Sprehes had not actually been charged for\n\nall hours expended by all attorneys’ in the matter due to certain amounts being\n\nwritten off by the Sprehes’ attorneys. [RR, Vol. 8, p. 43]. Mr. Haas testified that\n\nthe total amount of attorneys’ fees charged by the Gardner Haas PLLC law firm\n\nwas $112,335 and that the total amount that the Sprehes’ prior counsel billed to the\n\nSprehes was $30,399.70. [RR, Vol. 8, p. 44]. Mr. Haas testified that the Sprehes\n\nincurred $8,699.66 in litigation expenses. [RR, Vol. 8, at 44-46].\n\n       Mr. Haas also testified as to the portion of the Sprehes’ attorneys’ fees that\n\nwere reasonably incurred in connection with defending against Enterprising’s\n\nTTLA claim.       [RR, Vol. 8, at 47-50].         Mr. Haas testified regarding the\n\nmethodology he employed to form his opinion. [RR, Vol. 8, at 47-50].              He\n\ntestified that, in accordance with Texas law, he took the total fees incurred and,\n\nbased on his review of the tasks performed, determined that at least eighty percent\n\n\n\n                                         11\n\f(80%) of the total attorneys’ fees incurred advanced the defense of Enterprising’s\n\nTTLA claim. [RR, Vol. 8, pp. 47-50]. Mr. Haas testified that in order to properly\n\ndefend Enterprising’s TTLA claim, the Sprehes’ attorneys were required to\n\nperform tasks such as: (1) ascertaining what the alleged trade secrets at issue were;\n\n(2) evaluating how the trade secrets were allegedly obtained, (3) determining\n\nwhether the alleged trade secrets actually constituted trade secrets: (4)\n\ninvestigating whether, if they actually constituted trade secrets, the trade secrets\n\nwere appropriately held or maintained; and (5) evaluating whether Enterprising\n\nincurred any damages from the alleged theft of such trade secrets. [RR, Vol. 8, pp.\n\n47-50]. Applying the above methodology, Mr. Haas testified that, in his opinion,\n\n$114,000 in attorneys’ fees were reasonably and necessarily incurred by the\n\nSprehes to advance the defense of Enterprising’s TTLA claim.         [RR, Vol. 8, p.\n\n48].\n\n       Following the trial, the trial court awarded the Sprehes reasonable and\n\nnecessary attorneys’ fees in the amount of $89,844 [CR 1758-59].\n\n                       SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\n       The judgment entered by the trial court should be affirmed because the trial\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in denying Enterprising’s fourth request for a\n\ncontinuance and ruling on the Sprehes’ motion for summary judgment. After over\n\ntwo years of litigation, Enterprising failed to show that it possessed any protectable\n\n\n\n                                        12\n\ftrade secrets. Instead, Enterprising sought continuance after continuance to impose\n\ncrushing legal expenses on its former employee – with whom it had no non-\n\ncompetition agreement – for having the audacity to open her own business. After\n\ngranting Enterprising three continuances over a twenty-one month period, the trial\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in denying yet another continuance.\n\n      First, Enterprising’s fourth request for a continuance was defective because\n\nit did not include a proper verification and was not supported by a proper affidavit\n\nas required by TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(g) and 251. [CR 1560], [RR. Vol. 7, p. 4-5].\n\nThis Court should therefore presume that the trial court did not abuse its discretion\n\nin denying Enterprising’s request for a continuance.\n\n      Second, even if its motion for continuance had been sworn or supported by a\n\nproper affidavit, Enterprising failed to demonstrate that the alleged discovery\n\nwould have materially affected to the trial court’s decision to grant summary\n\njudgment. In their Amended Motion for Summary Judgment, the Sprehes argued\n\nthat Enterprising had no evidence that it (1) derived economic value form its\n\nalleged trade secrets [CR 1153] or (2) made reasonable efforts to protect the\n\nprivacy of its alleged trade secrets. [CR 1154-55]. The Sprehes also presented\n\nevidence that Enterprising’s customer contact and pricing information did not\n\nconstitute trade secrets. [CR 1144, 1154-55, 1159]. Enterprising did not respond\n\nto these summary judgment arguments, and it cannot now claim that it needed the\n\n\n\n                                       13\n\falleged discovery to do so, as information regarding its alleged trade secrets would\n\nhave already been in Enterprising’s possession. In any event, the alleged discovery\n\nwas actually produced. [RR Vols. 10-13].\n\n      Third, even if it could demonstrate that the alleged discovery was material\n\nand had not been produced, Enterprising failed to diligently pursue the alleged\n\ndiscovery. Enterprising waited fifteen months to serve its initial discovery requests\n\nin October 2015, and only did so on the eve of the initial discovery cut-off after it\n\nhad already been granted two previous continuances with respect to the Sprehes’\n\nmotion for summary judgment. Then, after obtaining a third continuance on\n\nDecember 17, 2015 [CR 795], Enterprising waited until June 9, 2016, almost seven\n\nmonths later, to file a motion to compel. [CR 965]. The Sprehes then produced\n\napproximately 9,000 pages of invoices and other records showing the amounts paid\n\nby their clients. [RR Vols. 10-13]. Enterprising did not move to compel additional\n\ndocuments until it the day its summary judgment response was due, after the\n\nsecond, extended discovery period had ended. [CR 1530, 805].\n\n      Moreover, as to alleged discovery deficiencies related to the Sprehes’\n\nelectronic devices, Enterprising’s expert, Protegga, was in possession of those\n\ndevices for over nineteen months before summary judgment was granted. [RR\n\nVol. 9, pp. 30-31, 165-167]. And on August 31, 2016, Protegga confirmed that\n\nEnterprise had not asked it to conduct additional searches of those electronic\n\n\n\n                                       14\n\fdevices [RR Vol. 9, p. 65 (Tr. at 57)], even though the trial court had granted leave\n\nto do so. [CR 1122].      Again, Enterprising waited until the date its summary\n\njudgment response was due, after the second, extended discovery period had\n\nended, to seek additional relief related to electronic devices. [CR 1530, 805].\n\n      Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying\n\nEnterprising’s fourth motion to continue the hearing on the Sprehes’ motion for\n\nsummary judgment. Because the denial of its request for a continuance is the only\n\nbasis that Enterprising presents to this Court for overturning the trial court’s grant\n\nof summary judgment, that decision should also be affirmed.\n\n      Finally, the trial court properly awarded attorneys’ fees to the Sprehes based\n\non their successful defense of Enterprising’s TTLA claim. The Sprehes properly\n\nsegregated their attorneys’ fees related to their defense of Enterprising’s TTLA\n\nclaim. The Sprehes’ expert, in accordance with Texas law, testified that at least\n\neighty percent (80%) of the Sprehes’ legal bills advanced the defense of\n\nEnterprising’s TTLA claim. That testimony provided ample evidence to support\n\nthe trial court’s determination and award of attorneys’ fees.\n\n\n\n\n                                        15\n\f                                   ARGUMENT\n\nARGUMENT REGARDING ISSUE 1:\n\nIn light of the three previous continuances granted to Enterprising, the\nsubstantial delays by Enterprising in pursuing discovery, the defects in\nEnterprising’s fourth motion for continuance, and the fact that the Sprehes\nproduced the documents which they were ordered to produce, the trial court\ndid not abuse its discretion in: (1) denying Enterprising’s fourth motion for\ncontinuance as to the Sprehes’ motion for summary judgment and (2)\ngranting the motion for summary judgment.\n\n      The standard of review for the trial court’s denial of Enterprising’s fourth\n\nmotion for continuance is an abuse of discretion. D.R. Horton-Texas, Ltd. v.\n\nSavannah Properties Assocs., L.P., 416 S.W.3d 217, 222 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth\n\n2013, no pet.). The test is whether the decision “was so arbitrary and unreasonable\n\nas to amount to a clear and prejudicial error of law.” Stierwalt v. FFE\n\nTransportation Servs., Inc., 499 S.W.3d 181, 188 (Tex. App.—El Paso 2016, no\n\npet.). So long as the trial court’s decision was based on appropriate guiding rules\n\nand principles, it should not be disturbed on appeal. See id.at 189.\n\n      The reviewing court should not substitute its own judgment for that of the\n\nlower court. Downer v. Aquamarine Operators, Inc., 701 S.W.2d 238, 241–42\n\n(Tex. 1985) (“The test for abuse of discretion is not whether, in the opinion of the\n\nreviewing court, the facts present an appropriate case for the trial court's action.\n\nRather, it is a question of whether the court acted without reference to any guiding\n\nrules and principles.”).\n\n\n\n                                        16\n\f      In this case, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that\n\nEnterprising was not entitled to a continuance of the hearing on the Sprehes’\n\nAmended Motion for Summary Judgment. First, the Court should presume that the\n\ntrial court did not abuse its discretion because Enterprising’s motion for\n\ncontinuance was not sworn or supported by an affidavit that met the applicable\n\nrequirements. Second, even if such a presumption is not applied, each of the\n\napplicable factors support the trial court’s denial of Enterprising’s request for a\n\ncontinuance. This case had been on file for over two years, Enterprising failed to\n\ndemonstrate the materiality of the alleged discovery, and Enterprising failed to\n\nshow diligence in seeking the alleged discovery. Each of these arguments is\n\naddressed in more detail below.\n\n            A. This Court Should Presume The Trial Court Did Not Abuse Its\n               Discretion In Denying A Continuance Because Enterprising’s\n               Motion Was Not Verified Or Supported By A Proper Affidavit.\n\n      “When a party contends that it has not had an adequate opportunity for\n\ndiscovery before a summary judgment hearing, it must file either an affidavit\n\nexplaining the need for further discovery or a verified motion for continuance.”\n\nTenneco Inc. v. Enter. Prods. Co., 925 S.W.2d 640, 647 (Tex. 1996). Such a\n\nrequest “must be supported by an affidavit that describes the evidence sought,\n\nexplains its materiality, and shows that the party requesting the continuance has\n\nused due diligence to timely obtain the evidence.” D.R. Horton-Texas, Ltd., 416\n\n\n\n                                       17\n\fS.W.3d at 222; see also TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(g), 251 and 252. “When a movant\n\nfails to include an affidavit in support of its motion, the appellate court presumes\n\nthe trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the continuance.” Clark v.\n\nCompass Bank, No. 2-07-050-CV, 2008 Tex. App. LEXIS 3783, at *6 (Tex. App.\n\n– Fort Worth May 22, 2008, no pet.); Ortiz v. Plano Indep. Sch. Dist., No. 07-17-\n\n00021-CV, 2017 Tex. App. LEXIS 11630, at *4 (Tex.

(“In Villegas, the Texas Supreme Court held that when a motion\n\nfor continuance is not sworn or supported by a proper affidavit, a reviewing court\n\ngenerally presumes that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the\n\ncontinuance.”) (citing Villegas v. Carter, 711 S.W.2d 624, 626 (Tex. 1986)).2\n\n\n\n\n2\n  Other appellate courts have held that a party fails to preserve the denial of a\ncontinuance for appeal by not filing a verified motion for continuance that\ncomplies with Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 251. See Grace Interest, LLC v.\nWallis State Bank, 431 S.W.3d 110, 128 n.6 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.]\n2013, pet denied.) (“We also note that appellants failed to preserve their argument\nthat the time for discovery was inadequate because they did not file a verified\nmotion for continuance in the trial court.”); Taherzadeh v. Ghaleh-Assadi, 108\nS.W.3d 927, 928 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2003, pet. denied) (finding oral motion for\ncontinuance presented without affidavit did not preserve claimed abuse of\ndiscretion by trial court in denying continuance because rule of civil procedure 251\nrequires an affidavit and error preservation under appellate rule 33.1(a)(1) requires\nmotion comply with rules of civil procedure); Ashton Grove L.C. v. Jackson\nWalker L.L.P., 366 S.W.3d 790, 800 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2012, no pet.) (same); see\nalso Ortiz, 2017 Tex. App. LEXIS 11630, at *6 n.5 (“It has also been held that\nfailure to support a motion for continuance with an affidavit preserves nothing for\nappellate review.”).\n\n\n                                       18\n\f      Here, the Court should presume that the trial court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in denying Enterprising’s motion for continuance because the motion\n\nwas not verified or supported by a proper affidavit in accordance with Texas Rules\n\nof Civil Procedure 166a(g), 251 and 252. Enterprising filed an unverified motion\n\nfor continuance with a blank verification form that no one signed and notarized.\n\n[CR 1560].3 Enterprising failed to submit an affidavit stating why it could not\n\npresent facts essential to justify its opposition to the Sprehes’ motion for summary\n\njudgment. TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a, 251, and 252. Because Enterprising failed to\n\nverify its motion or submit a proper affidavit that met the requirements of Texas\n\nRules of Civil Procedure 166a(g), 251 and 252, this Court should apply the\n\n“general presumption that a trial court does not abuse its discretion by denying a\n\nmotion for continuance that is unsworn and unsupported by an affidavit.” Ortiz v.\n\nPlano Indep. Sch. Dist., 2017 Tex. App. LEXIS 11630, at *6; see also Poonjani v.\n\nKamaluddin, No. 02-14-00193-CV, 2015 Tex. App. LEXIS 5717, at *4 (Tex. App.\n\n– Fort Worth June 4, 2015, no pet.) (mem. op.) (“Applying rule 251, we have\n\nconsistently held that a trial court does not abuse its discretion by denying an oral,\n\nunsworn motion for continuance.”) (collecting cases).\n\n\n3\n  Although Enterprising did attach an affidavit from its expert at Protegga to its\nrequest for a continuance, that affidavit did not explain the materiality of any\nevidence or explain Enterprising’s lack of diligence in obtaining any discovery. As\nsuch, the Protegga affidavit does not meet the requirements of TEX. R. CIV. P.\n166a, 251, and 252.\n\n                                        19\n\f             B. The Trial Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion In Denying\n                Enterprising’s Request.\n\n      Even when a movant includes a proper affidavit or verification in support of\n\na motion for a continuance, a denial of the motion “will be reversed only if the trial\n\ncourt acted without regard to guiding principles or was arbitrary or unreasonable.”\n\nClark, 2008 Tex. App. LEXIS 3783, at *5.             In determining a motion for\n\ncontinuance, a court should evaluate the following factors: (1) the length of time\n\nthe case has been on file: (2) the materiality and purpose of the discovery sought,\n\nand (3) whether the party seeking the continuance has exercised due diligence to\n\nobtain the discovery sought. D.R. Horton-Texas, Ltd., 416 S.W.3d at 223. For the\n\nreasons discussed below, each of these factors weigh against Enterprising’s request\n\nto continue the hearing on the Sprehe’s motion for summary judgment.\n\n                1. The Length Of Time This Case Was On File Supports The\n                   Trial Court’s Denial Of Another Continuance.\n\n      The trial court properly concluded that after over two years of litigation,\n\nEnterprising had ample opportunity to respond to the Sprehes’ motion for summary\n\njudgment. Indeed, many courts have held that shorter periods of time were more\n\nthan sufficient to justify denying a motion for continuance. See, e.g., Allen v.\n\nUnited of Omaha Life Ins. Co., 236 S.W.3d 315, 325–26 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth\n\n2007, pet. denied) (finding no abuse of discretion where case was on file 14\n\nmonths before summary judgment motion was filed); Sevier Enters., Inc. v. Euclid\n\n\n\n                                        20\n\fChem. Co., No. 02–13–00452–CV, 2014 WL 5791559, at *3-6 (Tex. App.—Fort\n\nWorth Nov. 6, 2014, no pet.) (mem. op.) (finding no abuse of discretion where\n\ncase was on file 19 months before plaintiff filed its motion for continuance of\n\nsummary judgment hearing); Idniarti v. Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc., No. 02–12–\n\n00045–CV, 2013 WL 1908291, at *3-4 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth May 9, 2013, pet.\n\ndenied) (mem. op.) (finding no abuse where case had been pending for over two\n\nyears when summary judgment motion was filed).\n\n      Clearly this factor weighs in favor of the Spehes. In fact, Enterprising\n\nconcedes that this case had been on file for “some time.” See Appellant’s Opening\n\nBrief at 13. Rather than focus on its own diligence, however, Enterprising instead\n\nfocuses on alleged delays on the Sprehes’ part in responding to discovery requests.\n\nJust as with the trial court, Enterprising does not even acknowledge, must less\n\nexplain, its own lack of diligence. The fact that this case had been on file for over\n\ntwo years provided ample support for the trial court’s denial of Enterprising’s\n\nmotion for another continuance of the summary judgment hearing.\n\n                2. Enterprising Did Not Establish The Materiality Of The\n                   Evidence Sought.\n\n      To satisfy its burden under Rule 166a(g), Enterprising was required to\n\nsubmit an “affidavit that describes the evidence sought, explains its materiality,\n\nand shows that the party requesting the continuance has used due diligence to\n\ntimely obtain the evidence.” D.R. Horton-Texas, Ltd., 416 S.W.3d at 222.\n\n                                       21\n\f      As noted above, Enterprising could not meet its burden to the trial court on\n\nthis issue because it failed to submit a verified motion or affidavit explaining such\n\nmateriality. Even if the trial court had accepted Enterprising’s unverified motion\n\nfor continuance, however, Enterprising failed to explain how the documents it\n\nsought were material in light of the issues raised by the Sprehes’ Amended Motion\n\nfor Summary Judgment.\n\n      Although the Sprehes had produced ample evidence to support their claim\n\nthat they were not in possession of, or using, Enterprising’s alleged trade secrets,\n\nthey also directed the court to a lack of evidence on a host of elements which\n\ninvolved information that Enterprising should have had in its possession before\n\neven filing suit in this matter. For instance, the Sprehes showed that Enterprising\n\nhad no evidence that it (1) derived economic value form its alleged trade secrets\n\n[CR 1153] or (2) made reasonable efforts to protect the privacy of its alleged trade\n\nsecrets. [CR 1154-55]. Enterprising could have easily presented such evidence if it\n\nin fact existed. It did not need discovery from the Sprehes to do so.\n\n      The Sprehes also presented evidence that established Enterprising’s\n\ncustomer contact information did not constitute a trade secret because: (1) the\n\ninformation related to a very small number of individuals (nine customers) with\n\nwhom Angelica interacted on a daily basis and was, therefore, within her personal\n\nknowledge and, (2) perhaps more importantly, the individuals’ names and emails\n\n\n\n                                       22\n\fwere readily ascertainable – all one had to do to find out who made purchasing\n\ndecisions for the customer was call that customer and ask. [CR 1154-55]. As with\n\nissues related to economic value and efforts to maintain privacy of alleged trade\n\nsecrets, each of these elements of Enterprising’s claim could have been satisfied by\n\npresenting information already within Enterprising’s possession and control if it\n\nexisted. Enterprising, however, did not present any evidence refuting the Sprehes’\n\nsummary judgment evidence.\n\n      Finally, the Sprehes presented evidence that established Enterprising’s\n\npricing information did not constitute a trade secrets since its pricing and rebates\n\nwere solely based on customer requests and the “market price” [CR 1144], and\n\ncould be readily ascertained from the customers themselves, with whom\n\nEnterprising had no confidentiality agreements [CR 1159]. Because the unrebutted\n\nevidence, including the testimony and admissions of Enterprising’s own corporate\n\nrepresentative, established that Enterprising did not actually have any legitimate\n\ntrade secrets, Enterprising cannot show that alleged discovery sought from the\n\nSprehes was material to the trial court’s ruling on the Sprehes’ Amended Motion\n\nfor Summary Judgment.\n\n      Perhaps equally fatal to Enterprising’s argument is the fact that the Sprehes\n\ndid produce documents containing the information that Enterprising now claims it\n\nneeded to respond to the Sprehes’ Amended Motion for Summary Judgment. On\n\n\n\n                                       23\n\fJuly 20, 2016, the trial court granted Enterprising’s motion to compel documents\n\n[CR 1122], and the Sprehes produced approximately 9,000 pages of invoices and\n\nother records responsive to Enterprising’s document requests.4 [RR Vols. pp. 10-\n\n13]. Enterprising fails to acknowledge the Sprehes’ production of invoices and\n\npayment records in its opening brief and fails to explain to the why it needed\n\nadditional discovery would have materially affected the court’s decision to grant\n\nthe Sprehe’s motion for summary judgment.\n\n      Based on the above, it is clear that the trial court would not have abused its\n\ndiscretion by determining that this factor weighed against Enterprising’s request\n\nfor a continuance.\n\n                3. Enterprising Did Not Establish Diligence In Pursuing\n                   Discovery.\n\n      A litigant who fails to diligently use the rules of civil procedure for\n\ndiscovery purposes is not entitled to a continuance. State v. Wood Oil Distrib.,\n\nInc., 751 S.W.2d 863, 865 (Tex. 1988); Clark, 2008 Tex. App. LEXIS 3783, at *6\n\n(same). The trial court may “consider whether the party seeking the continuance\n\n\n4\n In Appellant’s Brief, Enterprising asserts that a “scan of the Sprehes’ computers\nand electronic devices indicate that they Sprehes use the program QuickBooks and\nthey they have QuickBooks data regarding rebates, discounts, credits/offsets, and\nother payments related to price per wheel.” Appellants Brief at 9. Enterprising did\nnot request, and the trial court did not order the Sprehes to produce, QuickBooks\nreports. [RR Vol. 5, pp. 26-27]. Moreover, Enterprising fails to explain how such\ndata is different from the information contained in the invoices and payment\nrecords that the Sprehes produced to Enterprising. [RR Vols. 10-13].\n\n                                       24\n\fhas given an explanation for its failure to obtain the testimony and whether the\n\ntestimony cannot be procured from another source.”                Stierwalt v. FFE\n\nTransportation Servs., Inc., 499 S.W.3d 181, 189 (Tex. App.—El Paso 2016, no\n\npet); see also Dozier v. AMR Corp., No. 02–09–186–CV, 2010 WL 3075633, at\n\n*2-3 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth Aug. 5, 2010, no pet.) (mem. op.) (motion for\n\ncontinuance of summary judgment hearing based on needed evidence must be\n\nsupported by affidavit stating with particularity what diligence the moving party\n\nused to obtain that evidence, and therefore conclusory allegations are not\n\nsufficient). It is not enough to point to what evidence a party thinks it needs, a\n\nparty also bears the burden of explaining why it was not obtained earlier in order\n\nto avoid the need for a continuance. See Stierwalt 499 S.W.3d at 192.\n\n      Enterprising failed to demonstrate diligence in pursuit of discovery in this\n\nmatter as evidenced by significant gaps of time between discovery activity and by\n\nEnterprising not following through on the relief finally given to it regarding the\n\nSprehes’ electronic devices. As to discovery delays, Enterprising waited fifteen\n\nmonths after filing its lawsuit to serve any written discovery and only did so after it\n\nhad been granted two previous continuances of the Sprehes’ motion for summary\n\njudgment. Enterprising’s discovery requests were dated October 12, 2015, and\n\nwere clearly only served then to comply with the trial court’s original November\n\n18, 2015, discovery cut-off. [CR 417]. Even after obtaining a third continuance\n\n\n\n                                        25\n\fon December 17, 2015, [CR 795], Enterprising waited until June 9, 2016, almost\n\nseven months later, to file a motion to compel, [CR 965]. Following that hearing,\n\nthe Sprehes produced approximately 9,000 pages of invoices and payment credits.\n\n[RR Vols. 10-13]. Enterprising did not move to compel additional documents until\n\nthe date its summary judgment response was due and after the second, extended\n\ndiscovery period had ended. [CR 1530, 805].\n\n      As to alleged discovery deficiencies related to the Sprehes’ electronic\n\ndevices, Enterprising’s expert, Protegga was in possession of those devices for\n\nover nineteen months before summary judgment was granted. Enterprising waited\n\nuntil June 9, 2016, to seek additional searches of the electronic devices. Although\n\nthe trial court then authorized Protegga to search images of the Sprehes’ electronic\n\ndevices for certain categories of documents [CR 1122], as of August 31, 2016,\n\nEnterprise had not requested that Protegga do so. [RR Vol. 9, p. 57]. Again,\n\nEnterprising waited until the date its summary judgment response was due and\n\nafter the second, extended discovery period had ended to seek relief related to\n\nelectronic devices. [CR 1530, 805].\n\n      Despite Enterprising’s clear lack of diligence, the trial court granted three\n\nprevious motions for continuances of the Sprehe’s motion for summary judgment.\n\nIn addition, the Court set two different discovery cut-off dates.        Following\n\nexpiration of the second discovery cut-off, the trial court concluded that\n\n\n\n                                       26\n\fEnterprising had been afforded more than sufficient time to conduct discovery and\n\nprove its claims.\n\n      Based on this record, there is ample support for the trial court denying\n\nEnterprising a fourth continuance.    The trial court certainly did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in making its decision. The Sprehes’ respectfully request that this court\n\naffirm that decision.\n\nARGUMENT REGARDING ISSUE2:\n\nThe trial court properly awarded attorneys’ fees to the Sprehes based on their\nsuccessful defense of Enterprising’s Texas Theft Liability Act claim. The\nSprehes properly segregated their attorneys’ fees in accordance with Texas\nSupreme Court precedent. As such, there was sufficient evidence to support\nthe trial court’s award of attorneys’ fees to the Sprehes.\n\n      The award of fees to a prevailing party in a Texas Theft Liability Act\n\n(“TTLA”) action is mandatory. Moak v. Huff, No. 04-11-00184-CV, 2012 WL\n\n566140, at *10 (Tex. App.—San Antonio Feb. 15, 2012, no pet.) (mem. op.)\n\n(citing Peoples v. Genco Fed. Credit Union, No. 10–09–00032–CV, 2010 WL\n\n1797266, at *7 (Tex. App.—Waco May 5, 2010, no pet.) (mem. op.)). A defendant\n\nwho successfully defends a TTLA suit is entitled to recover his fees. Moak, 2012\n\nWL 566140 at *10.\n\n      Enterprising admits that it filed a claim under the TTLA. See Appellant’s\n\nOpening Brief at 15, [CR16]. Enterprising also admits that the TTLA provides for\n\nrecovery of attorneys’ fees. See id. According to Enterprising, however, the\n\n\n\n                                       27\n\fSprehes did not segregate the attorneys’ fees they incurred in connection with the\n\ndefense of Enterprising’s TTLA claim from those that it incurred in defending\n\nagainst Enterprising’s other claims. Enterprising is incorrect.\n\n      As the Texas Supreme Court explained in the seminal case on this issue,\n\n“fee claimants have always been required to segregate fees between claims for\n\nwhich they are recoverable and claims for which they are not. See Tony Gullo\n\nMotors I, L.P. v. Chapa, 212 S.W.3d 299, 311 (Tex. 2006). This does not mean,\n\nhowever, that fees that advance or relate to both recoverable and unrecoverable\n\nclaims should not be awarded. On the contrary, “[a] recognized exception to this\n\nduty to segregate arises when the attorney's fees rendered are in connection with\n\nclaims arising out of the same transaction and are so interrelated that their\n\n“prosecution or defense entails proof or denial of essentially the same facts.” Id.\n\nAs the Supreme Court recognized, “many if not most legal fees in such cases\n\ncannot and need not be precisely allocated to one claim or the other.” Id. at 313.\n\n      The Texas Supreme Court has also noted that many litigation tasks such as\n\n“requests for standard disclosures, proof of background facts, depositions of the\n\nprimary actors, discovery motions and hearings, voir dire of the jury, and a host of\n\nother services may be necessary whether a claim is filed alone or with others.” See\n\nid. “To the extent such services would have been incurred on a recoverable claim\n\nalone, they are not disallowed simply because they do double service.” Id. Thus,\n\n\n\n                                        28\n\fthe Supreme Court clearly held that only “if any attorney's fees relate solely to a\n\nclaim for which such fees are unrecoverable, a claimant must . . . segregate\n\nrecoverable from unrecoverable fees.”       See id.   In other words, “when legal\n\nservices advance both a recoverable and unrecoverable claim . . . they are so\n\nintertwined that they need not be segregated.” See id. at 313-14.\n\n      The Texas Supreme Court cautioned that “[t]his standard does not require\n\nmore precise proof for attorney's fees than for any other claims or expenses.” See\n\nid. at 314. A litigant is not required to “keep separate time records” regarding the\n\nwork performed for each claim. See id. Under the facts of the case in Chapa, the\n\nCourt noted that “an opinion would have sufficed stating that, for example, 95\n\npercent of their drafting time would have been necessary even if there had been no\n\n[non-recoverable] claim.” Id. Applying that standard, this Court has approved fee\n\nawards based on an expert’s opinion that seventy-five percent of the total\n\nattorneys’ fees were spent advancing both recoverable and non-recoverable claims.\n\nSee, e.g., Ropa Expl. Corp. v. Barash Energy, Ltd., No. 02-11-00258-CV, 2013\n\nWL 2631164, at *12 (Tex. App. – Forth Worth June 13, 2013, pet. denied) (“Ropa\n\nargues that the attorney's fee testimony was conclusory as to the seventy-five\n\npercent segregation estimate because the billing records were not in evidence and\n\nbecause only one of the nine asserted causes of action is a claim for which\n\nattorney's fees are recoverable. We disagree for two reasons.”).\n\n\n\n                                       29\n\f      In this case, the Sprehes’ expert witness, Eric Haas applied this exact\n\nmethodology in forming his opinions as to the proportion of attorneys’ fees that\n\nwere reasonably incurred by the Sprehes in defending against Enterprising’s TTLA\n\nclaims. He testified that, in accordance with Texas law, he took the total fees\n\nincurred and determined that at least eighty percent (80%) of the total attorneys’\n\nfees incurred advanced the defense of Enterprising’s TTLA claim. [RR, Vol. 8, at\n\n47-50]. Mr. Haas testified that in order to properly defend Enterprising’s TTLA\n\nclaim, the Sprehes’ attorneys were required to perform tasks such as: (1)\n\nascertaining what the alleged trade secrets at issue were; (2) evaluating how the\n\ntrade secrets were allegedly obtained, (3) determining whether the alleged trade\n\nsecrets actually constituted trade secrets: (4) investigating whether, if they actually\n\nconstituted trade secrets, the trade secrets were appropriately held or maintained;\n\nand (5) evaluating whether Enterprising incurred any damages from the alleged\n\ntheft of such trade secrets. [RR, Vol. 8, pp. 47-50]. As noted above, the fact that\n\nlitigation tasks associated with these issues also advanced non-recoverable claims\n\ndid not render then non-recoverable.\n\n      Trade secrets were central to this litigation. Enterprising based almost every\n\nclaim at least in part on the Sprehes’ alleged use of its trade secrets. For instance,\n\nin Count One, Breach of Contract, Enterprising plead that Angelica’s actions\n\nconstituted a breach of her employment agreement because she “was never\n\n\n\n                                        30\n\fpermitted or authorized to utilize, disclose, transmit, convey, sell or use the\n\nPlaintiff’s trade secrets outside of the Plaintiff’s business operations.” [CR 12].\n\nFor Count Two, Fraud, Enterprising plead that “[w]hile receiving the confidential\n\nand trade secret information described above, Defendant, Angelica Sprehe, was\n\nplanning and executing a deception to receive such information under the guise\n\nand pretense of working for the Plaintiff.” [CR 13]. For Count Three, Enterprising\n\ndirectly plead a claim for common law misappropriation of trade secrets. [CR 13].\n\nFor Count Four, Aiding and Abetting, Enterprising plead that defendants other than\n\nAngelica were responsible for this derivative tort relating their trade secrets. [CR\n\n14]. For Count Five, Breach of Fiduciary Duty, Enterprising plead that Angelica\n\nbreached such duties by “among other things, misappropriating and transferring\n\nessential business trade secrets.” [CR 15].\n\n      In light of the above, there is ample evidence to support Mr. Haas’s\n\ntestimony that eighty percent of the Sprehes’ attorneys’ fees were incurred in\n\ndefending against Enterprising’s claims related to trade secrets. Enterprising’s\n\nargument that a single paragraph in the Sprehes’ motion for summary judgment\n\nwas devoted to defeating Enterprising’s TTLA claim is disingenuous at best.\n\nEnterprising consciously chose to file its claim under the TTLA in order to avail\n\nitself of that statute’s mandatory fee-shifting provision. Enterprising could have\n\nrelied exclusively on a common-law misappropriation claim but, instead, chose to\n\n\n\n                                       31\n\fpursue a claim against the Sprehes with the threat of attorneys’ fees if it prevailed.\n\nOnly after having lost its TTLA claim does Enterprising now suggest that it never\n\nshould have brought the claim in the first place. The Sprehes did not simply rely\n\non a single paragraph in a summary judgment motion to prevail on Enterprising’s\n\nTTLA claim, and there is no indication that one argument or another was\n\nultimately dispositive of Enterprising’s TTLA claim on summary judgment. The\n\nSprehes had to fully defend themselves and raise all defenses related to\n\nEnterprising’s TTLA claim, and the trial court could have granted summary\n\njudgment on Enterprising TTLA’s claim on any of the grounds raised in the\n\nSprehes’ motion for summary judgment, including based on the evidence refuting\n\nthe existence of any legitimate trade secret. Under these circumstances, a fee\n\naward for the full cost of those efforts was warranted. The trial court agreed and\n\nmade its fee award. The Sprehes respectfully contend that there is ample evidence\n\nin the record to support that award and request that the trial court be affirmed.\n\n                                   CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, the Sprehes ask that this court affirm the trial\n\ncourt in all respects.\n\n\n\n\n                                         32\n\fDecember 20, 2017\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nGARDNER HAAS PLLC\n\nBy: /s/Eric P.

The\nSprehes properly segregated their attorneys’ fees in accordance with Texas\nSupreme Court precedent. As such, there was sufficient evidence to support the\ntrial court’s award of attorneys’ fees to the Sprehes.\n\n\n\n\n                                       5\n\f                          STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n      Appellant Enterprising Gals of Texas, L.L.C. (“Enterprising”) filed this\n\nlawsuit on July18, 2014 against its former employee, Appellee Angelica Sprehe\n\n(“Angelica”), her husband, Appellee Ryan Sprehe (“Ryan”), and their company,\n\nAppellee ARS Wheel Repair, Inc. (“ARS”) (collectively, the “Sprehes”) [CR 7-\n\n11]. Enterprising sued the Sprehes because they set up a competing wheel repair\n\ncompany. [CR 11-12].\n\n      Because Angelica did not have a covenant not to compete or, in fact, any\n\nwritten employment agreement [CR 1137, 1182-83], Enterprising sought to\n\nindirectly prohibit competition by suing the Sprehes for alleged misappropriation\n\nand theft of trade secrets [CR 13, 16]. Although Enterprising plead its claims\n\nbroadly, it ultimately admitted that its trade secret claims were limited to: (1)\n\nAngelica’s knowledge of the identity, telephone numbers and possibly email\n\naddress of some of the decision-makers for some of its customers, and (2)\n\nAngelica’s knowledge regarding the amount charged for each wheel repair and the\n\namount of the rebate given to certain customers at the end of the month if they\n\nmaintained a certain volume of business. [CR 1153].\n\n      Despite the enactment of the Texas Uniform Trade Secrets Act, TEX. CIV.\n\nPRAC. & REM. CODE 134A.001, et. seq. (“TUTSA”) in 2013, Enterprising chose to\n\nfile suit against the Sprehes for theft of trade secrets under the Texas Theft\n\n\n\n                                      6\n\fLiability Act (“TTLA”), hoping to avail itself of the TTLA’s mandatory prevailing\n\nparty attorneys’ fee provision. [CR 16].\n\n      On August 20, 2014, the trial court ordered the Sprehes to deliver “files\n\nrelated in any way to Plaintiff, Plaintiff’s confidential information and trade\n\nsecrets, and the wheel repair business.” [CR 66-68]. Inspection of the devices was\n\nordered to be performed by Plaintiff’s expert, Protegga LLC (“Protegga”). [CR\n\n308-11]. Although Protegga received a number of electronic devices from the\n\nSprehes in January of 2015, it did not prepare its preliminary report until July 2015\n\nand did not prepare its final report until November 2015, at least in part due to non-\n\npayment by Enterprising for its work. [RR Vol. 9, pp. 165-167].1\n\n      Enterprising did not serve any written discovery other than requests for\n\ndisclosures until October 12, 2015, almost fifteen months after the lawsuit was\n\nfiled. [CR 965-66]. Enterprising did not move to compel production of the\n\ndocuments it requested or seek to obtain additional information from the Sprehes’\n\nelectronic devices until June 9, 2016 [CR965], almost seven months after\n\nresponses to its document requests were served [CR 965-67], and almost fifteen\n\nmonths after Protegga had obtained images of the electronic devices at issue. [RR\n\nVol. 9, pp. 30-31, 165-167]. Enterprising’s motion to compel was filed eleven\n\n\n1\n  RR Vol. 9 is not sequentially numbered in the same manner as other volumes of\nthe Reporter’s Record. As such, the page numbers for RR Vol. 9 herein refer to\nthe PDF page numbers, as if the RR Vol. 9 had been sequentially numbered.\n\n                                        7\n\fmonths after Protegga’s initial report in July 2015. [RR Vol. 9, pp. 102-103, 200-\n\n212].\n\n        On July 20, 2016, the trial court granted Enterprising’s motion to compel\n\ndocuments and authorized Protegga to search images of the Sprehes’ electronic\n\ndevices for certain categories of documents [CR 1122]. In response to the trial\n\ncourt’s order, the Sprehes produced approximately 9,000 pages of invoices and\n\npayment receipts responsive to Enterprising’s document requests. [RR Vols. 10-\n\n13]. Enterprising did not request, and the trial court did not order the Sprehes to\n\nproduce, QuickBooks reports. [RR Vol. 5, pp. 26-27]. On August 31, 2016,\n\nProtegga’s representative confirmed that Enterprising had not requested that\n\nProtegga perform the analysis authorized by the trial court. [RR Vol. 9, p. 65].\n\n        Over the course of twenty-one months, the trial court granted Enterprising\n\nthree separate continuances with respect to the Sprehes’ motion for summary\n\njudgment. The Sprehes first moved for summary judgment on November 20, 2014\n\n[CR 176] and attempted to have the matter heard on heard on January 2, 2015.\n\n[CR 289]. The trial court granted Enterprising a continuance [CR 289]. The\n\nSprehes again set their motion for summary Judgment for hearing eight months\n\nlater, on August 18, 2015. [CR 416]. Enterprising filed a second motion for\n\ncontinuance [CR 326], which the trial court granted. [CR 416]. On October 12,\n\n2015, the trial court entered a scheduling order setting a discovery cut-off of\n\n\n\n                                        8\n\fNovember 18, 2015, and a dispositive motion deadline of February 15, 2016. [CR\n\n417]. Following expiration of the November 15, 2015, discovery cut-off, the\n\nSprehes again sought to have their motion for summary judgment heard on\n\nDecember 17, 2015, over fourteen months after it was originally filed. [RR, Vol. 4,\n\np. 4]. Enterprising sought a third continuance [CR 422], which the trial court\n\ngranted [CR 795].\n\n      On February 3, 2016, the Court entered a new Agreed Scheduling Order\n\nsetting a discovery cut-off of September 12, 2016, and a dispositive motions\n\ndeadline of September 30, 2016. [CR 805-809]. The Agreed Scheduling Order set\n\nthe case for trial on October 31, 2016. [CR 805]. Following expiration of this\n\nsecond discovery deadline, the Sprehes timely filed an Amended Motion for\n\nSummary Judgment (seeking summary judgment on both traditional and no-\n\nevidence grounds) [CR 1135], which they set for hearing on September 29, 2016.\n\n[RR. Vol. 7, p. 4-5]. On September 22, 2016, Enterprising filed a fourth motion\n\nfor continuance of the summary judgment hearing [CR 1530], but it did set that\n\nmotion for hearing. [RR. Vol. 7, p. 4-5]. Enterprising failed to verify its motion\n\nfor continuance and, as a result, did not present the requisite sworn testimony\n\nnecessary to support a request for a continuance. [CR 1560]. The trial court\n\ndenied Enterprising’s request for a continuance [RR Vol. 7, p. 47] and granted the\n\nSprehes’ Amended Motion for Summary Judgment [CR 1741, 1758].\n\n\n\n                                       9\n\f      The case was called for a bench trial on November 2, 2016. [RR Vol. 8, p.\n\n1]. The only remaining cause of action was the Sprehes’ claim for attorneys’ fees\n\nas the prevailing party on Enterprising’s claim under the Texas Theft Liability Act\n\n[CR 1748]. The Sprehes presented testimony from their expert witness, Eric Haas.\n\n[RR, Vol. 8, p. 25]. Mr. Haas testified regarding his qualifications to render an\n\nexpert opinion on the amount, reasonableness, and necessity of the attorneys’ fees\n\nincurred by the Sprehes in defending against Enterprising’s TTLA claim. [RR,\n\nVol. 8, pp. 27-29]. Mr. Haas testified that he was familiar with rates charged by\n\nattorneys in the geographic region for performing similar services. [RR, Vol. 8, pp.\n\n29-30]. Mr. Haas also testified that he had reviewed the standards that the Texas\n\nSupreme Court has articulated for evaluation of the reasonableness and necessity\n\nof attorneys’ fees. [RR, Vol. 8, pp. 29-30].\n\n      Mr. Haas testified that he reviewed the pleadings and other filings in the\n\nlitigation and that he was familiar with the activities performed by attorneys in the\n\nmatter because he was also an attorney of record in the matter. [RR, Vol. 8, pp.\n\n31-32]. Mr. Haas also testified that he had reviewed the tasks performed by prior\n\nattorneys who represented the Sprehes in this matter. [RR, Vol. 8, pp. 31-32]. Mr.\n\nHaas testified that he had reviewed the invoices outlining the tasks performed by\n\nthe attorneys working on matter and that he was familiar with the qualifications\n\nand experience of the attorneys’ performing the tasks. [RR, Vol. 8, pp. 31-33].\n\n\n\n                                       10\n\fMr. Haas testified that he reviewed the hourly rates charged for each attorneys’\n\nwork and that, in his opinion such hourly rates were reasonable and appropriate,\n\nconsidering the factors articulated by the Texas Supreme Court. [RR, Vol. 8, pp.\n\n33-41]. Mr. Haas also testified that the services performed by each attorney were\n\nappropriate for their skill level. [RR, Vol. 8, p. 41].\n\n      Mr. Haas testified that he evaluated the total number of hours expended by\n\nall attorneys’ in the litigation and all expenses incurred by the Sprehes. [RR, Vol.\n\n8, pp. 42-43]. Mr. Haas testified that the Sprehes had not actually been charged for\n\nall hours expended by all attorneys’ in the matter due to certain amounts being\n\nwritten off by the Sprehes’ attorneys. [RR, Vol. 8, p. 43]. Mr. Haas testified that\n\nthe total amount of attorneys’ fees charged by the Gardner Haas PLLC law firm\n\nwas $112,335 and that the total amount that the Sprehes’ prior counsel billed to the\n\nSprehes was $30,399.70. [RR, Vol. 8, p. 44]. Mr. Haas testified that the Sprehes\n\nincurred $8,699.66 in litigation expenses. [RR, Vol. 8, at 44-46].\n\n       Mr. Haas also testified as to the portion of the Sprehes’ attorneys’ fees that\n\nwere reasonably incurred in connection with defending against Enterprising’s\n\nTTLA claim.       [RR, Vol. 8, at 47-50].         Mr. Haas testified regarding the\n\nmethodology he employed to form his opinion. [RR, Vol. 8, at 47-50].              He\n\ntestified that, in accordance with Texas law, he took the total fees incurred and,\n\nbased on his review of the tasks performed, determined that at least eighty percent\n\n\n\n                                         11\n\f(80%) of the total attorneys’ fees incurred advanced the defense of Enterprising’s\n\nTTLA claim. [RR, Vol. 8, pp. 47-50]. Mr. Haas testified that in order to properly\n\ndefend Enterprising’s TTLA claim, the Sprehes’ attorneys were required to\n\nperform tasks such as: (1) ascertaining what the alleged trade secrets at issue were;\n\n(2) evaluating how the trade secrets were allegedly obtained, (3) determining\n\nwhether the alleged trade secrets actually constituted trade secrets: (4)\n\ninvestigating whether, if they actually constituted trade secrets, the trade secrets\n\nwere appropriately held or maintained; and (5) evaluating whether Enterprising\n\nincurred any damages from the alleged theft of such trade secrets. [RR, Vol. 8, pp.\n\n47-50]. Applying the above methodology, Mr. Haas testified that, in his opinion,\n\n$114,000 in attorneys’ fees were reasonably and necessarily incurred by the\n\nSprehes to advance the defense of Enterprising’s TTLA claim.         [RR, Vol. 8, p.\n\n48].\n\n       Following the trial, the trial court awarded the Sprehes reasonable and\n\nnecessary attorneys’ fees in the amount of $89,844 [CR 1758-59].\n\n                       SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\n       The judgment entered by the trial court should be affirmed because the trial\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in denying Enterprising’s fourth request for a\n\ncontinuance and ruling on the Sprehes’ motion for summary judgment. After over\n\ntwo years of litigation, Enterprising failed to show that it possessed any protectable\n\n\n\n                                        12\n\ftrade secrets. Instead, Enterprising sought continuance after continuance to impose\n\ncrushing legal expenses on its former employee – with whom it had no non-\n\ncompetition agreement – for having the audacity to open her own business. After\n\ngranting Enterprising three continuances over a twenty-one month period, the trial\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in denying yet another continuance.\n\n      First, Enterprising’s fourth request for a continuance was defective because\n\nit did not include a proper verification and was not supported by a proper affidavit\n\nas required by TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(g) and 251. [CR 1560], [RR. Vol. 7, p. 4-5].\n\nThis Court should therefore presume that the trial court did not abuse its discretion\n\nin denying Enterprising’s request for a continuance.\n\n      Second, even if its motion for continuance had been sworn or supported by a\n\nproper affidavit, Enterprising failed to demonstrate that the alleged discovery\n\nwould have materially affected to the trial court’s decision to grant summary\n\njudgment. In their Amended Motion for Summary Judgment, the Sprehes argued\n\nthat Enterprising had no evidence that it (1) derived economic value form its\n\nalleged trade secrets [CR 1153] or (2) made reasonable efforts to protect the\n\nprivacy of its alleged trade secrets. [CR 1154-55]. The Sprehes also presented\n\nevidence that Enterprising’s customer contact and pricing information did not\n\nconstitute trade secrets. [CR 1144, 1154-55, 1159]. Enterprising did not respond\n\nto these summary judgment arguments, and it cannot now claim that it needed the\n\n\n\n                                       13\n\falleged discovery to do so, as information regarding its alleged trade secrets would\n\nhave already been in Enterprising’s possession. In any event, the alleged discovery\n\nwas actually produced. [RR Vols. 10-13].\n\n      Third, even if it could demonstrate that the alleged discovery was material\n\nand had not been produced, Enterprising failed to diligently pursue the alleged\n\ndiscovery. Enterprising waited fifteen months to serve its initial discovery requests\n\nin October 2015, and only did so on the eve of the initial discovery cut-off after it\n\nhad already been granted two previous continuances with respect to the Sprehes’\n\nmotion for summary judgment. Then, after obtaining a third continuance on\n\nDecember 17, 2015 [CR 795], Enterprising waited until June 9, 2016, almost seven\n\nmonths later, to file a motion to compel. [CR 965]. The Sprehes then produced\n\napproximately 9,000 pages of invoices and other records showing the amounts paid\n\nby their clients. [RR Vols. 10-13]. Enterprising did not move to compel additional\n\ndocuments until it the day its summary judgment response was due, after the\n\nsecond, extended discovery period had ended. [CR 1530, 805].\n\n      Moreover, as to alleged discovery deficiencies related to the Sprehes’\n\nelectronic devices, Enterprising’s expert, Protegga, was in possession of those\n\ndevices for over nineteen months before summary judgment was granted. [RR\n\nVol. 9, pp. 30-31, 165-167]. And on August 31, 2016, Protegga confirmed that\n\nEnterprise had not asked it to conduct additional searches of those electronic\n\n\n\n                                       14\n\fdevices [RR Vol. 9, p. 65 (Tr. at 57)], even though the trial court had granted leave\n\nto do so. [CR 1122].      Again, Enterprising waited until the date its summary\n\njudgment response was due, after the second, extended discovery period had\n\nended, to seek additional relief related to electronic devices. [CR 1530, 805].\n\n      Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying\n\nEnterprising’s fourth motion to continue the hearing on the Sprehes’ motion for\n\nsummary judgment. Because the denial of its request for a continuance is the only\n\nbasis that Enterprising presents to this Court for overturning the trial court’s grant\n\nof summary judgment, that decision should also be affirmed.\n\n      Finally, the trial court properly awarded attorneys’ fees to the Sprehes based\n\non their successful defense of Enterprising’s TTLA claim. The Sprehes properly\n\nsegregated their attorneys’ fees related to their defense of Enterprising’s TTLA\n\nclaim. The Sprehes’ expert, in accordance with Texas law, testified that at least\n\neighty percent (80%) of the Sprehes’ legal bills advanced the defense of\n\nEnterprising’s TTLA claim. That testimony provided ample evidence to support\n\nthe trial court’s determination and award of attorneys’ fees.\n\n\n\n\n                                        15\n\f                                   ARGUMENT\n\nARGUMENT REGARDING ISSUE 1:\n\nIn light of the three previous continuances granted to Enterprising, the\nsubstantial delays by Enterprising in pursuing discovery, the defects in\nEnterprising’s fourth motion for continuance, and the fact that the Sprehes\nproduced the documents which they were ordered to produce, the trial court\ndid not abuse its discretion in: (1) denying Enterprising’s fourth motion for\ncontinuance as to the Sprehes’ motion for summary judgment and (2)\ngranting the motion for summary judgment.\n\n      The standard of review for the trial court’s denial of Enterprising’s fourth\n\nmotion for continuance is an abuse of discretion.

First, the Court should presume that the\n\ntrial court did not abuse its discretion because Enterprising’s motion for\n\ncontinuance was not sworn or supported by an affidavit that met the applicable\n\nrequirements.

The Trial Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion In Denying\n                Enterprising’s Request.\n\n      Even when a movant includes a proper affidavit or verification in support of\n\na motion for a continuance, a denial of the motion “will be reversed only if the trial\n\ncourt acted without regard to guiding principles or was arbitrary or unreasonable.”\n\nClark, 2008 Tex. App. LEXIS 3783, at *5.             In determining a motion for\n\ncontinuance, a court should evaluate the following factors: (1) the length of time\n\nthe case has been on file: (2) the materiality and purpose of the discovery sought,\n\nand (3) whether the party seeking the continuance has exercised due diligence to\n\nobtain the discovery sought. D.R. Horton-Texas, Ltd., 416 S.W.3d at 223. For the\n\nreasons discussed below, each of these factors weigh against Enterprising’s request\n\nto continue the hearing on the Sprehe’s motion for summary judgment.\n\n                1. The Length Of Time This Case Was On File Supports The\n                   Trial Court’s Denial Of Another Continuance.\n\n      The trial court properly concluded that after over two years of litigation,\n\nEnterprising had ample opportunity to respond to the Sprehes’ motion for summary\n\njudgment. Indeed, many courts have held that shorter periods of time were more\n\nthan sufficient to justify denying a motion for continuance. See, e.g., Allen v.\n\nUnited of Omaha Life Ins. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2186091\"><a href=\"/opinion/2186091/allen-v-united-of-omaha-life-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">236</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">315</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 325–26 (Tex.

App.—Fort Worth May 9, 2013, pet.\n\ndenied) (mem. op.) (finding no abuse where case had been pending for over two\n\nyears when summary judgment motion was filed).\n\n      Clearly this factor weighs in favor of the Spehes. In fact, Enterprising\n\nconcedes that this case had been on file for “some time.” See Appellant’s Opening\n\nBrief at 13. Rather than focus on its own diligence, however, Enterprising instead\n\nfocuses on alleged delays on the Sprehes’ part in responding to discovery requests.\n\nJust as with the trial court, Enterprising does not even acknowledge, must less\n\nexplain, its own lack of diligence. The fact that this case had been on file for over\n\ntwo years provided ample support for the trial court’s denial of Enterprising’s\n\nmotion for another continuance of the summary judgment hearing.\n\n                2. Enterprising Did Not Establish The Materiality Of The\n                   Evidence Sought.\n\n      To satisfy its burden under Rule 166a(g), Enterprising was required to\n\nsubmit an “affidavit that describes the evidence sought, explains its materiality,\n\nand shows that the party requesting the continuance has used due diligence to\n\ntimely obtain the evidence.” D.R. Horton-Texas, Ltd., 416 S.W.3d at 222.\n\n                                       21\n\f      As noted above, Enterprising could not meet its burden to the trial court on\n\nthis issue because it failed to submit a verified motion or affidavit explaining such\n\nmateriality. Even if the trial court had accepted Enterprising’s unverified motion\n\nfor continuance, however, Enterprising failed to explain how the documents it\n\nsought were material in light of the issues raised by the Sprehes’ Amended Motion\n\nfor Summary Judgment.\n\n      Although the Sprehes had produced ample evidence to support their claim\n\nthat they were not in possession of, or using, Enterprising’s alleged trade secrets,\n\nthey also directed the court to a lack of evidence on a host of elements which\n\ninvolved information that Enterprising should have had in its possession before\n\neven filing suit in this matter. For instance, the Sprehes showed that Enterprising\n\nhad no evidence that it (1) derived economic value form its alleged trade secrets\n\n[CR 1153] or (2) made reasonable efforts to protect the privacy of its alleged trade\n\nsecrets. [CR 1154-55]. Enterprising could have easily presented such evidence if it\n\nin fact existed. It did not need discovery from the Sprehes to do so.\n\n      The Sprehes also presented evidence that established Enterprising’s\n\ncustomer contact information did not constitute a trade secret because: (1) the\n\ninformation related to a very small number of individuals (nine customers) with\n\nwhom Angelica interacted on a daily basis and was, therefore, within her personal\n\nknowledge and, (2) perhaps more importantly, the individuals’ names and emails\n\n\n\n                                       22\n\fwere readily ascertainable – all one had to do to find out who made purchasing\n\ndecisions for the customer was call that customer and ask. [CR 1154-55]. As with\n\nissues related to economic value and efforts to maintain privacy of alleged trade\n\nsecrets, each of these elements of Enterprising’s claim could have been satisfied by\n\npresenting information already within Enterprising’s possession and control if it\n\nexisted. Enterprising, however, did not present any evidence refuting the Sprehes’\n\nsummary judgment evidence.\n\n      Finally, the Sprehes presented evidence that established Enterprising’s\n\npricing information did not constitute a trade secrets since its pricing and rebates\n\nwere solely based on customer requests and the “market price” [CR 1144], and\n\ncould be readily ascertained from the customers themselves, with whom\n\nEnterprising had no confidentiality agreements [CR 1159]. Because the unrebutted\n\nevidence, including the testimony and admissions of Enterprising’s own corporate\n\nrepresentative, established that Enterprising did not actually have any legitimate\n\ntrade secrets, Enterprising cannot show that alleged discovery sought from the\n\nSprehes was material to the trial court’s ruling on the Sprehes’ Amended Motion\n\nfor Summary Judgment.\n\n      Perhaps equally fatal to Enterprising’s argument is the fact that the Sprehes\n\ndid produce documents containing the information that Enterprising now claims it\n\nneeded to respond to the Sprehes’ Amended Motion for Summary Judgment. On\n\n\n\n                                       23\n\fJuly 20, 2016, the trial court granted Enterprising’s motion to compel documents\n\n[CR 1122], and the Sprehes produced approximately 9,000 pages of invoices and\n\nother records responsive to Enterprising’s document requests.4 [RR Vols. pp. 10-\n\n13]. Enterprising fails to acknowledge the Sprehes’ production of invoices and\n\npayment records in its opening brief and fails to explain to the why it needed\n\nadditional discovery would have materially affected the court’s decision to grant\n\nthe Sprehe’s motion for summary judgment.\n\n      Based on the above, it is clear that the trial court would not have abused its\n\ndiscretion by determining that this factor weighed against Enterprising’s request\n\nfor a continuance.\n\n                3. Enterprising Did Not Establish Diligence In Pursuing\n                   Discovery.\n\n      A litigant who fails to diligently use the rules of civil procedure for\n\ndiscovery purposes is not entitled to a continuance.

It is not enough to point to what evidence a party thinks it needs, a\n\nparty also bears the burden of explaining why it was not obtained earlier in order\n\nto avoid the need for a continuance. See Stierwalt 499 S.W.3d at 192.\n\n      Enterprising failed to demonstrate diligence in pursuit of discovery in this\n\nmatter as evidenced by significant gaps of time between discovery activity and by\n\nEnterprising not following through on the relief finally given to it regarding the\n\nSprehes’ electronic devices. As to discovery delays, Enterprising waited fifteen\n\nmonths after filing its lawsuit to serve any written discovery and only did so after it\n\nhad been granted two previous continuances of the Sprehes’ motion for summary\n\njudgment. Enterprising’s discovery requests were dated October 12, 2015, and\n\nwere clearly only served then to comply with the trial court’s original November\n\n18, 2015, discovery cut-off. [CR 417]. Even after obtaining a third continuance\n\n\n\n                                        25\n\fon December 17, 2015, [CR 795], Enterprising waited until June 9, 2016, almost\n\nseven months later, to file a motion to compel, [CR 965]. Following that hearing,\n\nthe Sprehes produced approximately 9,000 pages of invoices and payment credits.\n\n[RR Vols. 10-13]. Enterprising did not move to compel additional documents until\n\nthe date its summary judgment response was due and after the second, extended\n\ndiscovery period had ended. [CR 1530, 805].\n\n      As to alleged discovery deficiencies related to the Sprehes’ electronic\n\ndevices, Enterprising’s expert, Protegga was in possession of those devices for\n\nover nineteen months before summary judgment was granted. Enterprising waited\n\nuntil June 9, 2016, to seek additional searches of the electronic devices. Although\n\nthe trial court then authorized Protegga to search images of the Sprehes’ electronic\n\ndevices for certain categories of documents [CR 1122], as of August 31, 2016,\n\nEnterprise had not requested that Protegga do so. [RR Vol. 9, p. 57]. Again,\n\nEnterprising waited until the date its summary judgment response was due and\n\nafter the second, extended discovery period had ended to seek relief related to\n\nelectronic devices. [CR 1530, 805].\n\n      Despite Enterprising’s clear lack of diligence, the trial court granted three\n\nprevious motions for continuances of the Sprehe’s motion for summary judgment.\n\nIn addition, the Court set two different discovery cut-off dates.        Following\n\nexpiration of the second discovery cut-off, the trial court concluded that\n\n\n\n                                       26\n\fEnterprising had been afforded more than sufficient time to conduct discovery and\n\nprove its claims.\n\n      Based on this record, there is ample support for the trial court denying\n\nEnterprising a fourth continuance.    The trial court certainly did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in making its decision. The Sprehes’ respectfully request that this court\n\naffirm that decision.\n\nARGUMENT REGARDING ISSUE2:\n\nThe trial court properly awarded attorneys’ fees to the Sprehes based on their\nsuccessful defense of Enterprising’s Texas Theft Liability Act claim. The\nSprehes properly segregated their attorneys’ fees in accordance with Texas\nSupreme Court precedent. As such, there was sufficient evidence to support\nthe trial court’s award of attorneys’ fees to the Sprehes.\n\n      The award of fees to a prevailing party in a Texas Theft Liability Act\n\n(“TTLA”) action is mandatory.

See Appellant’s\n\nOpening Brief at 15, [CR16]. Enterprising also admits that the TTLA provides for\n\nrecovery of attorneys’ fees. See id. According to Enterprising, however, the\n\n\n\n                                       27\n\fSprehes did not segregate the attorneys’ fees they incurred in connection with the\n\ndefense of Enterprising’s TTLA claim from those that it incurred in defending\n\nagainst Enterprising’s other claims. Enterprising is incorrect.\n\n      As the Texas Supreme Court explained in the seminal case on this issue,\n\n“fee claimants have always been required to segregate fees between claims for\n\nwhich they are recoverable and claims for which they are not. See Tony Gullo\n\nMotors I, L.P. v. Chapa, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">212</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">299</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 311 (Tex. 2006). This does not mean,\n\nhowever, that fees that advance or relate to both recoverable and unrecoverable\n\nclaims should not be awarded. On the contrary, “[a] recognized exception to this\n\nduty to segregate arises when the attorney's fees rendered are in connection with\n\nclaims arising out of the same transaction and are so interrelated that their\n\n“prosecution or defense entails proof or denial of essentially the same facts.” Id.\n\nAs the Supreme Court recognized, “many if not most legal fees in such cases\n\ncannot and need not be precisely allocated to one claim or the other.” Id. at 313.\n\n      The Texas Supreme Court has also noted that many litigation tasks such as\n\n“requests for standard disclosures, proof of background facts, depositions of the\n\nprimary actors, discovery motions and hearings, voir dire of the jury, and a host of\n\nother services may be necessary whether a claim is filed alone or with others.” See\n\nid. “To the extent such services would have been incurred on a recoverable claim\n\nalone, they are not disallowed simply because they do double service.” Id. Thus,\n\n\n\n                                        28\n\fthe Supreme Court clearly held that only “if any attorney's fees relate solely to a\n\nclaim for which such fees are unrecoverable, a claimant must . . . segregate\n\nrecoverable from unrecoverable fees.”       See id.   In other words, “when legal\n\nservices advance both a recoverable and unrecoverable claim . . . they are so\n\nintertwined that they need not be segregated.” See id. at 313-14.\n\n      The Texas Supreme Court cautioned that “[t]his standard does not require\n\nmore precise proof for attorney's fees than for any other claims or expenses.” See\n\nid. at 314. A litigant is not required to “keep separate time records” regarding the\n\nwork performed for each claim. See id. Under the facts of the case in Chapa, the\n\nCourt noted that “an opinion would have sufficed stating that, for example, 95\n\npercent of their drafting time would have been necessary even if there had been no\n\n[non-recoverable] claim.” Id. Applying that standard, this Court has approved fee\n\nawards based on an expert’s opinion that seventy-five percent of the total\n\nattorneys’ fees were spent advancing both recoverable and non-recoverable claims.\n\nSee, e.g., Ropa Expl. Corp. v. Barash Energy, Ltd., No. 02-11-00258-CV, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2631164</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *12 (Tex.

We disagree for two reasons.”).\n\n\n\n                                       29\n\f      In this case, the Sprehes’ expert witness, Eric Haas applied this exact\n\nmethodology in forming his opinions as to the proportion of attorneys’ fees that\n\nwere reasonably incurred by the Sprehes in defending against Enterprising’s TTLA\n\nclaims. He testified that, in accordance with Texas law, he took the total fees\n\nincurred and determined that at least eighty percent (80%) of the total attorneys’\n\nfees incurred advanced the defense of Enterprising’s TTLA claim. [RR, Vol. 8, at\n\n47-50]. Mr. Haas testified that in order to properly defend Enterprising’s TTLA\n\nclaim, the Sprehes’ attorneys were required to perform tasks such as: (1)\n\nascertaining what the alleged trade secrets at issue were; (2) evaluating how the\n\ntrade secrets were allegedly obtained, (3) determining whether the alleged trade\n\nsecrets actually constituted trade secrets: (4) investigating whether, if they actually\n\nconstituted trade secrets, the trade secrets were appropriately held or maintained;\n\nand (5) evaluating whether Enterprising incurred any damages from the alleged\n\ntheft of such trade secrets. [RR, Vol. 8, pp. 47-50]. As noted above, the fact that\n\nlitigation tasks associated with these issues also advanced non-recoverable claims\n\ndid not render then non-recoverable.\n\n      Trade secrets were central to this litigation. Enterprising based almost every\n\nclaim at least in part on the Sprehes’ alleged use of its trade secrets. For instance,\n\nin Count One, Breach of Contract, Enterprising plead that Angelica’s actions\n\nconstituted a breach of her employment agreement because she “was never\n\n\n\n                                        30\n\fpermitted or authorized to utilize, disclose, transmit, convey, sell or use the\n\nPlaintiff’s trade secrets outside of the Plaintiff’s business operations.” [CR 12].\n\nFor Count Two, Fraud, Enterprising plead that “[w]hile receiving the confidential\n\nand trade secret information described above, Defendant, Angelica Sprehe, was\n\nplanning and executing a deception to receive such information under the guise\n\nand pretense of working for the Plaintiff.” [CR 13]. For Count Three, Enterprising\n\ndirectly plead a claim for common law misappropriation of trade secrets. [CR 13].\n\nFor Count Four, Aiding and Abetting, Enterprising plead that defendants other than\n\nAngelica were responsible for this derivative tort relating their trade secrets. [CR\n\n14]. For Count Five, Breach of Fiduciary Duty, Enterprising plead that Angelica\n\nbreached such duties by “among other things, misappropriating and transferring\n\nessential business trade secrets.” [CR 15].\n\n      In light of the above, there is ample evidence to support Mr. Haas’s\n\ntestimony that eighty percent of the Sprehes’ attorneys’ fees were incurred in\n\ndefending against Enterprising’s claims related to trade secrets. Enterprising’s\n\nargument that a single paragraph in the Sprehes’ motion for summary judgment\n\nwas devoted to defeating Enterprising’s TTLA claim is disingenuous at best.\n\nEnterprising consciously chose to file its claim under the TTLA in order to avail\n\nitself of that statute’s mandatory fee-shifting provision. Enterprising could have\n\nrelied exclusively on a common-law misappropriation claim but, instead, chose to\n\n\n\n                                       31\n\fpursue a claim against the Sprehes with the threat of attorneys’ fees if it prevailed.\n\nOnly after having lost its TTLA claim does Enterprising now suggest that it never\n\nshould have brought the claim in the first place. The Sprehes did not simply rely\n\non a single paragraph in a summary judgment motion to prevail on Enterprising’s\n\nTTLA claim, and there is no indication that one argument or another was\n\nultimately dispositive of Enterprising’s TTLA claim on summary judgment. The\n\nSprehes had to fully defend themselves and raise all defenses related to\n\nEnterprising’s TTLA claim, and the trial court could have granted summary\n\njudgment on Enterprising TTLA’s claim on any of the grounds raised in the\n\nSprehes’ motion for summary judgment, including based on the evidence refuting\n\nthe existence of any legitimate trade secret. Under these circumstances, a fee\n\naward for the full cost of those efforts was warranted. The trial court agreed and\n\nmade its fee award. The Sprehes respectfully contend that there is ample evidence\n\nin the record to support that award and request that the trial court be affirmed.\n\n                                   CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, the Sprehes ask that this court affirm the trial\n\ncourt in all respects.\n\n\n\n\n                                         32\n\fDecember 20, 2017\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nGARDNER HAAS PLLC\n\nBy: /s/Eric P.
