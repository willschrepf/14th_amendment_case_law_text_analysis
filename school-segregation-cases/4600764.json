Nor do we\nbelieve    that the 48th Leglalature    by enACting Senate Blll\nNo. 266 (Chapter 289, Acts 1943, p8ge 385) intended to take\nftrom the Armory Board any of the brond powers and discre-\ntion vhloh had been theretofore       conferred upon It.\n\n            Article   789Ob placea in the Armory Board the ex-\nQreas duty to acquire leasehold      estatea and grants to It\n all powers neoeaaary and convenient for the accomplishment\nof euoh duty.”      If we hold th8t Senate Bill No. 266 applies\nto the Armory Board, we must necessarily      hold that the\nLegislature   intanded.to   take from the Armory Board these\nbroad powers and discretions.\n             In Senate Bill No. 266, the 48th Legislature         has\n918Ced absolute discretion      over the need by any agency or\ndepartment of the rental space whlchTproposea             to lease\nor rent in the Board of Control.         Some possible   diatinotlon\nmay be made on the basis that Senate Bill No. 266 refers to\n8nd applies to rental space, vhile Article         789Ob applies to\nleasehold    estates.    However, ve will not quarrel with mere\ntemo1ogy.         A8 we have seen, Artlole    58gOb places abaolute\ndlacretion    In the Armory Board over the necessity        or desir-\nability    0r such leasehold   estate a8 it de6iroS     to acquire.\nLlkevise    under Article   T&Ob selection    d sltea is left to\nthe dlsoretlon     of the Armory Board ua a neceaaury corollary\nof the grant of “all      power8 necessary and convenient to the\n8coompllshment” 0r 14s duties.

The primary\nfunotlon of the Armory Board la to seoure and malntaln ar-\naorles and the Armory Board Act places the burden upon the\n,?gnory Board to do vhatever is neoessary to carry out its\nobjeots and purpose,s.\n             While Senate Bill Ho. 266, according           to its ex-\n press language, applies to all State agenoles,             we are of the\n r~pinion that properly oonstrued,         It does not apply, and vas\n not intended by the Legislature          to apply, to governmental\n oorporatlons,    such as the Arrmory Board, to vhloh the Legls-\n lature has granted broad and extensive powers for the aaocan-\n plirhment OS a partiaular       and segregated purpolre of the State.\nJ@&.ave already slluded to the fact that the Armory Board,\n a8 set up by the Legislature,         Is oonstituted     a body politic\n &fCZoorporation,       which, vhlle it performs funotlons bene-\n Sl~iZl to the 8tat8,       is not in a true sene.e a component and\n interdependent     part OS the admlnlstratlve        lnaohinery OS the\n state government.\n  ------- -\n-s.,;\n              In Its broadest oonnotation,        the expression    “atate\n ageaoy” may and does enoompass all organizations             and bodies\n serving any of +he objeots or purposes OS the State govern-\n ment.

While cities    are,\nin the broad sense, arms of the State, they are neverthe-\nless sovereign   ln themselves vlthln    the llmltatlons    lm-\nposed by the Constitution    and statute8 of the State.\nThey are not like those agencies or departments of the\nstate government which perform limited functions as a cog\nln the sdmlnlstratlve   machinery of state government and\nvhlch have no sovereignty    of’ their own.\n          Yet, If we were seeking an annlogy, ve would\noertaldly  conclude that the Amory     Borrrd is more nearly\nIlke a municipal corporation    or city than a State depart-\nmwlt .
