F11-00698-K\n                 IN THE CRIMINAL DISTRICT COURT NO. 4\n                            DALLAS COUNTY\n\n\n\n      A LCALA, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which K ELLER, P.J.,\nM EYERS, K EASLER, H ERVEY, R ICHARDSON, Y EARY, and N EWELL, JJ., joined.\nJ OHNSON, J., concurred.\n\n                                     OPINION\n\n      Appellant was convicted in May 2013 of capital murder committed in August\n\n2011. T EX. P ENAL C ODE § 19.03(a)(7). Based on the jury’s answers to the special issues\n\nset forth in Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Article 37.071, sections 2(b) and 2(e), the\n\f                                                                                   MUHAMMAD –2\ntrial judge sentenced appellant to death. T EX. C ODE C RIM. P ROC. art. 37.071, § 2(g).1\n\nDirect appeal to this Court is automatic. Appellant raises fifty-four points of error. After\n\nreviewing appellant’s points of error, we find them to be without merit. Consequently,\n\nwe affirm the trial court’s judgment and sentence of death.\n\n                                  STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n       Appellant drowned two of his sons, five-year-old Naim Muhammad and three-\n\nyear-old Elijah Muhammad, because he was angry with their mother, Kametra Sampson,\n\nwho had separated from appellant about eight months before the offense. Because the\n\ncircumstances of the instant offense are intertwined with appellant’s long history of\n\nabusing Kametra, we will begin with this history.\n\n       Appellant and Kametra met and began dating in 2003, when Kametra was fifteen\n\nyears old and appellant was twenty-five. Within a few weeks, appellant began physically\n\nabusing Kametra. The first episode of abuse occurred during an argument in the back\n\nyard of appellant’s father’s house. Kametra told appellant that she was leaving and\n\nturned to walk away. Appellant grabbed her, threw her into his car, punched her\n\nrepeatedly, and told her that she was not leaving. He did not let her go home that day.\n\n       Appellant beat Kametra once or twice a week for the first four or five years of\n\ntheir relationship, and then the beatings became more frequent. Appellant usually abused\n\nKametra by punching her in the face with his fists. In 2006, Kametra told appellant that\n\n\n       1\n         Unless otherwise indicated, all future references to Articles refer to the Texas Code of\nCriminal Procedure.\n\f                                                                              MUHAMMAD –3\nshe was pregnant. Appellant told her to get an abortion, and when she refused, he\n\nattempted to induce a miscarriage by punching and kicking her stomach. When that\n\nfailed, appellant urged Kametra to drink bleach or use a wire hanger, but Kametra did not\n\ndo so. Kametra later gave birth to the couple’s first child, Naim. In 2008, Kametra\n\ninformed appellant that she was pregnant with their second child. She again refused to\n\nget an abortion and appellant again attempted to induce a miscarriage by punching and\n\nkicking her stomach. The attempt failed, and Kametra gave birth to Elijah. Appellant did\n\nnot punch and kick Kametra in the stomach when she informed him that she was pregnant\n\nwith their third child, Jeremiah, but appellant continued to physically abuse her by\n\npunching her in the face.\n\n       Around Christmas of 2010, Kametra left appellant, taking their three sons with her.\n\nAppellant continued to physically abuse Kametra when he had the opportunity. He also\n\nused their sons in his efforts to control her. For example, on February 24, 2011, appellant\n\nshowed up at Kametra’s mother’s house, and Kametra went outside to talk to him. He\n\ntold Kametra that he wanted to take Naim and Elijah, but Kametra told him that he could\n\nnot. She went back inside and tried to close the door, but appellant forced his way into\n\nthe house. He pushed Kametra against the wall and punched her in the face. He then\n\nrushed into the dining room and grabbed Naim. While carrying Naim, he kicked down a\n\nside door and fled. Police found Naim a short time later and returned him to Kametra.\n\n       As a result of this incident, appellant was arrested for assaulting Kametra.\n\nAppellant was already on probation for a 2009 assault on his sister, and the State\n\f                                                                              MUHAMMAD –4\nsubsequently filed a motion to revoke his probation based on this new offense. However,\n\nthe motion to revoke remained pending because appellant stopped reporting to his\n\nprobation officer and avoided contact with other law-enforcement officials.\n\n       Kametra and appellant continued to communicate after the February 2011 incident,\n\nand the boys sometimes visited appellant. Appellant repeatedly asked Kametra to\n\nreconcile with him, but she rejected his requests. On March 24, 2011, all three boys\n\nvisited appellant at his brother’s house. Appellant told Kametra that he could not take\n\nNaim to preschool that day, so Kametra borrowed a car from her sister, Gabrielle, and\n\ndrove to the house to pick up the boys. Kametra stopped the car in front of the house,\n\nloaded the children into the back seat, and sat down in the driver’s seat. Appellant, who\n\nwas standing by the car, asked Kametra to take him to the store. She told him that she\n\ncould not do that because she had to return the car to Gabrielle. Appellant climbed into\n\nthe car anyway. Kametra again told appellant that she could not take him to the store and\n\nasked him to get out of the car. Appellant became upset and choked Kametra into\n\nunconsciousness.\n\n       When Kametra regained consciousness, she and the boys were inside the house.\n\nAppellant hit Kametra in the head with a heavy object when she told him that she needed\n\nto leave. Kametra finally persuaded appellant to let her go, telling him that Gabrielle\n\nwould call the police if she did not return the car soon. Appellant allowed Kametra to\n\nleave with the boys, but he insisted on riding with them.\n\n       Gabrielle was waiting outside when they stopped the car. As Kametra exited the\n\f                                                                              MUHAMMAD –5\ncar, Gabrielle saw her battered condition and called the police. Appellant picked up\n\nElijah and told Kametra, who was holding Jeremiah, that he would kill Elijah if she did\n\nnot walk away with him. Appellant walked away quickly, carrying Elijah. Kametra, still\n\ncarrying Jeremiah, followed appellant slowly because she did not want to go with him.\n\nAppellant attempted to hide when police officers arrived, but when he realized that the\n\nofficers had seen him, he dropped Elijah and ran away.\n\n       By the time of the instant offense, a Child Protective Services (“CPS”) worker had\n\ninstructed Kametra not to let appellant visit the boys unless his mother accompanied him.\n\nKametra complied with this instruction. Nevertheless, at around 6:30 a.m. on Naim’s first\n\nday of kindergarten, appellant borrowed a friend’s car and showed up at Kametra’s house,\n\nunannounced and alone. He stated that he wanted to take Naim to school. Kametra and\n\nher mother told appellant to leave several times before he complied.\n\n       A short time later, while Kametra and Elijah were walking Naim to school,\n\nappellant pulled up in a car in front of them, jumped out, and picked up a rock. He\n\nthreatened to hit Kametra in the head with it if she and the boys did not get into the car\n\nwith him. After they were in the car, appellant drove toward Naim’s school, but he\n\npassed it without stopping and announced that Naim would not go to school that day.\n\nAppellant drove erratically while he threatened and hit Kametra. His demeanor alternated\n\nbetween hostile and affectionate. He told Kametra several times that he would kill her\n\nand the boys.\n\n       When appellant stopped the car at a traffic light, Kametra saw a constable’s car in\n\f                                                                             MUHAMMAD –6\nthe next lane. She jumped out of appellant’s car and ran to the constable for help.\n\nAlthough the light was still red and another car was stopped in front of him, appellant\n\ndrove the car over the curb and sped away with the boys. He told them that their mother\n\ndid not care about them any more. He stopped the car near a creek and walked the boys\n\ndown the embankment. The boys told appellant that they loved him, and Naim asked him\n\nnot to kill them.\n\n        Having second thoughts, appellant walked the boys back up to the car and smoked\n\na cigarette while he considered his next move. He concluded that he could not take the\n\nboys back to the house because the police would be waiting for them. After deciding to\n\ncomplete his plan, appellant walked the boys back down the embankment. Appellant\n\ncarried Elijah after Elijah complained that he could not walk down by himself. Elijah\n\ncried for his mother, and appellant told the boys that she ran away and he did not know\n\nwhere she was. Naim repeated, “I love you, dad,” over and over.\n\n        Appellant told the boys to sit down in the water, turn away from him, and pretend\n\nthey were swimming. They complied, and he held their heads under water. Naim was\n\nkicking, but appellant would not let him get up. Appellant did not let up until both boys\n\nstopped moving. Appellant left their bodies in the creek and drove to Kametra’s house,\n\nwhere he broke a window in the room where Jeremiah was sleeping. Appellant attempted\n\nto climb through the window, but Kametra’s brother entered the room and pushed\n\nappellant back outside. Appellant, as he was leaving, stated, “Your nephews are dead\n\nnow.”\n\f                                                                               MUHAMMAD –7\n       After he committed the offense, appellant evaded capture and resisted arrest.\n\nAppellant told his mother, who was waiting for him at his brother’s house, that he would\n\nnot go home because he knew the police were looking for him and he did not want to go\n\nback to jail. While law-enforcement officers searched for him, appellant abandoned the\n\ncar and fled on foot. He kicked and fought with the arresting officers when they found\n\nhim. Five or six officers struggled to restrain him, and they “Tazed” him three times\n\nbefore they were finally able to handcuff him. Appellant did not stop fighting until he\n\nwas handcuffed.\n\n       After the offense but before his capture, appellant’s mother asked appellant what\n\nhe had done to her grandsons. Appellant told her that he “didn’t do that” and that\n\nKametra “did it” by refusing to let him see them. After he was captured, appellant said in\n\nhis statement to police that he regretted what he had done and that the only reason he\n\nkilled the boys was to prove a point to Kametra. He stated that he would not have done it\n\nif she had stayed with him in the car. Following his statement, appellant asked the\n\ninvestigating officer to tell Kametra that it was her fault that he killed the boys because he\n\nwould not have done it if she had let him see them. He also asked the investigator to tell\n\nhis sisters that he was sorry he “did this stupid-ass shit.”\n\n       While in jail, appellant wrote a letter to Kametra’s mother in which he stated that\n\nhe would never do anything to hurt the boys. He declared that he still loved Kametra. He\n\nalso stated that the boys’ deaths were Kametra’s fault because she got out of the car, and\n\nKametra’s mother’s fault because she did not let appellant into her house.\n\f                                                                                MUHAMMAD –8\n                           SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE\n\n       In point of error forty-two, appellant asserts that the evidence is legally insufficient\n\nto support the jury’s affirmative finding of future dangerousness. Appellant argues that\n\nhe had “no prior violent offense convictions that sent him to the penitentiary” and that\n\ndefense witnesses testified that he was a low risk for future dangerousness. He asserts\n\nthat the evidence showed that his conduct in this case was the result of a “family conflict”\n\nabout his children. Appellant reasons that, because this type of conflict would not exist in\n\nprison, he would not be a future danger if he received a life sentence. Appellant also\n\npoints to evidence of his terrible childhood and his low cognitive functioning to explain\n\nhis criminal behavior.\n\n       When reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury’s future-\n\ndangerousness determination, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the\n\nverdict and determine whether, based on that evidence and reasonable inferences\n\ntherefrom, any rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that there\n\nis a probability that appellant would commit criminal acts of violence constituting a\n\ncontinuing threat to society. See Martinez v. State, 327 S.W.3d 727, 730 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 2010); see also Wardrip v. State, 56 S.W.3d 588, 593 (Tex. Crim. App. 2001). We\n\ndo not weigh the evidence of future dangerousness against countervailing evidence. See\n\nBrooks v. State, 323 S.W.3d 893, 894 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010) (“a reviewing court is\n\nrequired to defer to a jury’s credibility and weight determinations”); see also McGinn v.\n\nState, 961 S.W.2d 161, 168-69 (Tex. Crim. App. 1998) (stating that, once the rationality\n\f                                                                               MUHAMMAD –9\nof the future-dangerousness prediction is established, it is impossible to determine\n\nwhether the prediction is nevertheless wrong or unjust because of countervailing\n\nevidence).\n\n       In determining the special issues, the jury is entitled to consider all of the evidence\n\npresented at both the guilt and punishment stages of trial. Art. 37.071, § 2(d)(1); see also\n\nYoung v. State, 283 S.W.3d 854, 863 (Tex. Crim. App. 2009). The jury may consider a\n\nvariety of factors when determining whether a defendant will pose a continuing threat to\n\nsociety. Wardrip, 56 S.W.3d at 594 & n.7; Keeton v. State, 724 S.W.2d 58, 61 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 1987).\n\n       The circumstances of an offense alone, if severe enough, can be sufficient to\n\nsustain an affirmative finding as to a defendant’s future dangerousness. See Rosales v.\n\nState, 841 S.W.2d 368, 381 (Tex. Crim. App. 1992); see also Kunkle v. State, 771 S.W.2d\n\n435, 445-46 (Tex. Crim. App. 1986). “This Court has repeatedly said that, if the\n\ncircumstances of the case are sufficiently cold-blooded or calculated, then those facts\n\nalone may support a finding of future dangerousness.” Gardner v. State, 306 S.W.3d 274,\n\n304 (Tex. Crim. App. 2009).\n\n       The evidence that appellant intentionally drowned his two young sons in order to\n\n“prove a point to” their mother supports the jury’s finding of future dangerousness. The\n\nage and helplessness of the victims provide some evidence of appellant’s future\n\ndangerousness. See, e.g., Lucio v. State, 351 S.W.3d 878, 904 (Tex. Crim. App. 2011)\n\n(noting that “evidence reflecting that appellant brutally murdered her defenseless\n\f                                                                             MUHAMMAD –10\ntwo-year-old child” supported future-dangerousness finding); Heiselbetz v. State, 906\n\nS.W.2d 500, 507 (Tex. Crim. App. 1995) (citing “the murder of a mother and her helpless\n\nchild” as evidence of future dangerousness). So is the act of killing children for the\n\npurpose of hurting their mother. See, e.g., Williams v. State, 273 S.W.3d 200, 220 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 2008) (stating that, to the extent that the defendant’s knowledge of the\n\nvictim’s relationships enabled him to reasonably foresee the harmful effects of the\n\nvictim’s death on others, the jury could consider that information with respect to the\n\ndefendant’s future dangerousness); Hathorn v. State, 848 S.W.2d 101, 115 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 1992) (describing appellant’s threats to kill witness’s and prosecutor’s children as\n\nevidence of future dangerousness).\n\n       Further, the evidence that appellant walked his sons down a creek bank intending\n\nto drown them, smoked a cigarette while he reconsidered, decided to complete his plan,\n\nand walked them down to the creek a second time supports a finding of calculation and\n\ndeliberation. Cf. Devoe v. State, 354 S.W.3d 457, 461 (Tex. Crim. App. 2011).\n\nSimilarly, the close physical contact and sustained effort required to drown two conscious\n\nvictims evinces appellant’s future dangerousness. Cf. Martinez v. State, 924 S.W.2d 693,\n\n696-97 (Tex. Crim. App. 1996) (distinguishing a killing by the distant and quick use of a\n\ngun from a killing by the use of a knife, which requires close proximity and contact with\n\nthe victim; “such a personal act requires a wanton and callous disregard for human life”).\n\n       Appellant’s history of abusing the victims’ mother is also evidence of future\n\ndangerousness. Cf. Lucio, 351 S.W.3d at 903 (indicating that evidence that appellant had\n\f                                                                              MUHAMMAD –11\na long history of abusing capital-murder victim supported future-dangerousness finding);\n\nsee also Coble v. State, 330 S.W.3d 253, 265 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010) (indicating that,\n\nafter appellant was convicted of killing his wife’s family, appellant’s life-long history of\n\nviolence toward women supported a future-dangerousness finding); Heiselbetz, 906\n\nS.W.2d at 507 (citing “appellant’s history of committing violent acts against women,\n\nchildren, and the elderly” as evidence of future dangerousness). Evidence that appellant\n\nassaulted Kametra while on probation for assaulting his sister and that revocation\n\nproceedings were pending when he committed the instant offense also support the jury’s\n\nfuture-dangerousness finding. See, e.g., Barnes v. State, 876 S.W.2d 316, 329 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 1994) (“That appellant committed another crime while already on probation\n\nfor other offenses has a bearing on the question of whether he would pose a future danger\n\nto society.”).\n\n       Further, appellant’s lack of remorse and his deflection of blame support the jury’s\n\nfuture-dangerousness finding. See, e.g., Salazar v. State, 38 S.W.3d 141, 145 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 2001); see also Dewberry v. State, 4 S.W.3d 735, 743 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999)\n\n(“Future dangerousness may be supported in part by evidence of a lack of remorse or\n\ncontrition.”).\n\n       In addition to the circumstances of the offense, other evidence, such as prior bad\n\nacts, prior criminal record, psychiatric evidence, and character evidence, may support a\n\nfinding of future dangerousness. See Guevara v. State, 97 S.W.3d 579, 581 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 2003). In this case, the prosecutor presented evidence that appellant’s criminal\n\f                                                                            MUHAMMAD –12\nhistory spanned nearly twenty years. See Garcia v. State, 57 S.W.3d 436, 441-42 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 2001). Appellant had contact with the juvenile system before he was a\n\nteenager, and, when he was thirteen years old, he began committing criminal offenses that\n\nresulted in juvenile adjudications. Among other offenses, appellant was adjudicated for\n\nevading arrest and for burglaries of habitations and vehicles. When he was fifteen years\n\nold, appellant was sent to a juvenile home where he received individual and group\n\ncounseling. After numerous rules infractions, however, including assaulting the same\n\njuvenile twice in one day, appellant was discharged from the home and sent to the Texas\n\nYouth Commission facility for Jefferson County (“TYC”) in July 1995.\n\n       At TYC, appellant was often explosive and disrespectful to staff. He was\n\nparticularly hostile to female staff. On one occasion when he was being disciplined for\n\ndisruptive behavior, appellant looked toward a female officer and declared that he wanted\n\nto “beat somebody down,” adding, “especially females.” Appellant also committed rules\n\ninfractions. For example, when he was found in possession of razor blades and crushed\n\naspirin in December 1995, he admitted to staff that he stole the razor blades and crushed\n\nthe aspirin to trade it for snacks. In September 1996, he was disciplined after he\n\nrepeatedly punched a juvenile while another boy held the victim down. After appellant\n\nwas released from TYC, he resumed committing criminal offenses such as burglary and\n\nevading arrest.\n\n       Appellant’s history of violence toward women was not limited to Kametra. In\n\n2001, appellant threatened to beat a female neighbor after she saw him looking in her\n\f                                                                              MUHAMMAD –13\nbathroom window and confronted him in her yard. He left when she called the police.\n\n       In 2009, appellant hit his sister in the head with a hammer. When officers\n\nresponded to the scene, his sister was crying, and fresh blood was running down the back\n\nof her head. Appellant had walked down the street to a convenience store after the\n\nincident. When he was brought back to the scene, he told officers that he had acted in\n\nself-defense. This incident was not the first time appellant had hit his sister. As a result\n\nof this incident, appellant pleaded guilty to a charge of aggravated assault with a deadly\n\nweapon and received five years’ deferred adjudication. He did not comply with many of\n\nthe conditions of his probation, including attending an anger-management course,\n\nperforming community service, and obtaining a job. He also tested positive for drug use\n\non several occasions. Appellant stopped reporting to his probation officer after his arrest\n\nfor assaulting Kametra.\n\n       While in jail awaiting trial on the instant offense, appellant committed violent\n\ndisciplinary offenses. For example, he refused instructions to return a breakfast tray and\n\n“swung at” the officer who entered his cell to retrieve it. On another occasion, appellant\n\nfought with an inmate over the choice of a television show.\n\n       Finally, one of appellant’s expert witnesses opined that appellant had antisocial\n\npersonality disorder (“ASPD”), although she minimized the significance of ASPD with\n\nrespect to predicting future dangerousness in the prison setting. Cf. Lucio, 351 S.W.3d at\n\n904 (observing that the future-dangerousness special issue asks a jury to determine\n\nwhether a capital defendant would constitute a continuing threat to society “whether in or\n\f                                                                                MUHAMMAD –14\nout of prison”). Viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, the evidence –\n\nincluding the circumstances and facts of the offense and appellant’s history of criminal\n\noffenses and bad acts – was such that the jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt that\n\nappellant would be a continuing threat to society. Point of error forty-two is overruled.\n\n                                      JURY VOIR DIRE\n\n       In points of error one through seventeen, appellant asserts that the trial court\n\nerroneously denied his challenges for cause to seventeen prospective jurors. Appellant\n\nwas entitled to fifteen peremptory challenges to be used against prospective jurors. See\n\nArt. 35.15(a). After he exhausted his fifteen peremptory strikes, he received two\n\nadditional strikes. The trial court denied appellant’s request for a third additional strike to\n\nexercise on prospective juror Ernest Hand, and Hand was seated as the twelfth juror.\n\nAppellant identified Hand as an objectionable juror. Because appellant received two\n\nadditional peremptory strikes, he is not entitled to relief unless he establishes that the trial\n\ncourt erroneously denied at least three of his challenges for cause. See Saldano v. State,\n\n232 S.W.3d 77, 93 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007).\n\n       A prospective juror is challengeable for cause if he or she has a bias or prejudice\n\nagainst the defendant or against the law upon which either the State or the defense is\n\nentitled to rely. Art. 35.16(a)(9) & (c)(2); Gardner, 306 S.W.3d at 295. The test is\n\nwhether the prospective juror’s bias or prejudice would substantially impair his ability to\n\ncarry out his duties in accordance with his instructions and his oath. Wainwright v. Witt,\n\n469 U.S. 412, 424 (1985). This standard does not require that bias be proved with\n\f                                                                             MUHAMMAD –15\n“unmistakable clarity” because many prospective jurors simply cannot be asked enough\n\nquestions to reach the point at which their bias has been made “unmistakably clear.” Id.\n\n       When a party wishes to exclude a juror because of bias, it is the party seeking\n\nexclusion who must demonstrate, through questioning, that the prospective juror lacks\n\nimpartiality. Witt, 469 U.S. at 423. To establish that a challenge for cause is proper, the\n\nproponent of the challenge must show that the prospective juror understood the\n\nrequirements of the law and could not overcome his prejudice well enough to follow the\n\nlaw. Davis v. State, 329 S.W.3d 798, 807 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010). Before a prospective\n\njuror may be excused for cause on this basis, the law must be explained to him, and he\n\nmust be asked whether he can follow that law, regardless of his personal views. Feldman\n\nv. State, 71 S.W.3d 738, 744 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002).\n\n       The standard of review on appeal is whether the trial court abused its discretion by\n\noverruling a challenge for cause. Smith v. State, 297 S.W.3d 260, 268 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n2009). In making this decision, we examine the voir dire of the prospective juror as a\n\nwhole and determine whether the record shows that the prospective juror’s convictions\n\nwould interfere with his ability to serve as a juror and to abide by the oath. Curry v.\n\nState, 910 S.W.2d 490, 493 (Tex. Crim. App. 1989); see also Feldman, 71 S.W.3d at 744.\n\nWe afford great deference to the trial court’s decision because the trial judge is present to\n\nobserve the demeanor of prospective jurors and to listen to tones of voice. See Morgan v.\n\nIllinois, 504 U.S. 719, 734-39 (1992); Davis, 329 S.W.3d at 807. Particular deference is\n\ndue when the prospective juror’s answers are vacillating, unclear, or contradictory.\n\f                                                                                MUHAMMAD –16\nSmith, 297 S.W.3d at 268.\n\n       In point of error two, appellant asserts that the trial court erroneously overruled his\n\nchallenge for cause against prospective juror Georgia Nichols. He argues that Nichols\n\nwas disqualified because she would not require the State to prove appellant’s guilt beyond\n\na reasonable doubt.2\n\n       The record does not support appellant’s claim that Nichols would not hold the\n\nState to its burden of proof at the guilt-or-innocence phase. When the prosecutor\n\nbroached the subject of the State’s burden of proof, Nichols sought clarification about the\n\nmeaning of “proof beyond a reasonable doubt.” She explained that she had previously\n\nserved on a jury in a criminal case and that she was unhappy with the result. She felt that\n\nshe had let the other jurors talk her into voting not guilty by persuading her that her\n\ndetermination of guilt was based on improper inferences from the evidence. Nichols\n\nstated that she wanted clarification because she would never “be one-hundred percent\n\nsure” or know the facts of the offense “beyond a shadow of a doubt” unless she witnessed\n\nthem personally. The prosecutor explained the State’s burden of proof and assured\n\nNichols that “beyond a reasonable doubt” did not mean “beyond a shadow of a doubt.”\n\nNichols indicated that she understood. When questioned by defense counsel, Nichols\n\nprovided an accurate understanding of the State’s burden of proof and affirmed that she\n\n\n\n       2\n         With respect to Nichols and many other prospective jurors, appellant asserts on appeal\ngrounds for disqualification that he failed to raise at trial. We will not address these grounds\nbecause he failed to preserve error. See TEX . R. APP . P. 33.1.\n\f                                                                               MUHAMMAD –17\nwould hold the State to its burden. The court did not abuse its discretion by denying the\n\nchallenge for cause. Point of error two is overruled.\n\n       In point of error three, appellant asserts that the trial court erroneously denied his\n\nchallenge for cause against Dee Jay Earley. He argues that Earley was disqualified\n\nbecause Earley: (1) was deceptive when he failed to indicate on his questionnaire that he\n\nhad been a victim’s advocate for two and one-half years while in the military; and (2)\n\nwould not consider evidence of voluntary intoxication to be mitigating.\n\n       Appellant’s first argument is predicated on the following facts in the record.\n\nQuestion 58 on the jury questionnaire asked prospective jurors, “Have you ever worked\n\nwith any local, state or national citizen’s law enforcement group, or a group dedicated to\n\nvictim’s rights?” As illustrative examples, the question identified Mothers Against Drunk\n\nDriving (“MADD”), the police auxiliary, or the sheriff auxiliary. A space below the\n\nquestion was provided for the prospective juror to list any such associations. Earley\n\nanswered this question in the negative and did not list any associations. During voir dire,\n\nhowever, Earley disclosed that he had volunteered for a victim’s advocacy program while\n\nhe was in the military. Specifically, the prosecutor asked Earley if he had participated in\n\nthe military judicial process, and Earley responded:\n\n       Ma’am, I spent a small amount of time as a victims’ advocate while I was in\n       the service, but as far as court; no, ma’am.\n\n       Q. Okay. And what did you do as a victim advocate?\n\n       A. My job was to go help the victims, no matter what it be, civilian or\n       otherwise, on the post. For example, a battered spouse, putting her up in a\n\f                                                                           MUHAMMAD –18\n      hotel on the post for the night.\n\n      Q. Okay.\n\n      A. Getting with RMP’s or military police to ensure that there’s anything\n      other – the restraining orders to keep him or her away from the victim –\n\n      Q. Okay.\n\n      A. – or alleged victim at that time.\n\n      Q. Anything about that that you feel that we need to know or –\n\n      A. No, ma’am. Soldiers will be soldiers.\n\n      Q. Yeah.\n\n      A. They get in scraps pretty often.\n\nDefense counsel asked Earley for additional details about his experience as a victim’s\n\nadvocate:\n\n      Q. Was that something – was that a post you were assigned to?\n\n      A. No, sir. That’s a complete volunteer service that some soldiers in the\n      military do.\n\n      Q. Okay. And so that was while you were serving; is that correct?\n\n      A. Yes, sir.\n\n      Q. Kind of what were your – tell me about it, please.\n\n      A. My commander at the time asked me if I’d be interested in doing it. In\n      the military, fights between spouses, fights between other soldiers happen\n      quite frequently.\n\n      Q. Yes, sir.\n\n      A. I mean, it’s a volatile area to be.\n\f                                                                     MUHAMMAD –19\n        My commander had asked me if I’d be interested in doing it. I done\nit. I went to – I forget how many hours worth of classes. And then the –\nbasically the MPs would call us out if there was a – a wife that beat a\nhusband or a husband that beat a wife, child abuse, or just a teenage kid\nfiling a complaint against their mother or father.\n\nQ. Yes, sir.\n\nA. And our jobs basically were to go out and help do what we could.\n\n       Now, obviously, we’re not a legal group of people. We are merely\nvolunteers that have been trained to deal with personal situations and give\nthem somebody to talk to, help them find a room for the night, if need be,\nhelp them find food for the night, if need be.\n\nQ. And how long did you do that, Mr. Earley?\n\nA. Off and on for about two-and-a-half years, sir.\n\nQ. Okay. So a little bit more than half of your service then, correct?\n\nA. Yes, sir.\n\n                                    ***\n\nQ. Anything about that two-and-a-half year service as a victim advocate in\nthe military, any of that kind of maybe even raised your level of support for\nthe death penalty or anything like that?\n\nA. No, sir.\n\n                                    ***\n\nQ. Okay. And anything about that advocacy program, Mr. Earley, that has\nyou maybe more likely to give the State the benefit of the doubt regarding\nany particular aspects of this case?\n\nA. No, sir.\n\nDefense counsel later challenged Earley for cause on the ground that he had been\n\f                                                                             MUHAMMAD –20\ndeceptive when he failed to list his experience as a victim’s advocate on the\n\nquestionnaire. The State pointed out that Earley’s volunteer work was not, as stated in\n\nQuestion Number 58, a “local, state or national citizen’s law enforcement group, or a\n\ngroup dedicated to victim’s rights.” The trial court indicated that the groups listed as\n\nexamples under the question were not necessarily similar to Earley’s volunteer program in\n\nthe military.\n\n       The trial court brought Earley back into the courtroom. The court provided Earley\n\nwith his questionnaire and asked him to review Question Number 58. Earley did so and\n\nthen explained that he did not think that his volunteer work was covered by the question.\n\nHe stated that his work had been “completely voluntary” and had nothing to do with law\n\nenforcement or state organizations. He noted that he never considered the program to be\n\nan organization like MADD. The volunteers in his program did not meet together as a\n\ngroup. When assisting a victim, he could telephone a coordinator for limited help, such\n\nas finding a hotel room for the night or a meal, but this help did not extend to providing\n\nlegal advice or advocacy. Earley stated that he did not have any reason to omit this\n\ninformation from his questionnaire, other than he did not think it was responsive to the\n\nquestion. He specifically denied having any intent to conceal this information. The trial\n\ncourt credited Earley’s explanation and concluded that he was not trying to be deceptive\n\nor misleading when he completed his questionnaire.\n\n       With regard to appellant’s assertion that Earley did not consider evidence of\n\nvoluntary intoxication to be mitigating, we note that Earley had no duty to regard such\n\f                                                                              MUHAMMAD –21\nevidence as mitigating. See Hernandez v. State, 390 S.W.3d 310, 315 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n2012) (“Whether a juror considers a particular type of evidence to be mitigating is not a\n\nproper area of inquiry.”). Even so, defense counsel elicited Earley’s testimony that,\n\nalthough he did not regard evidence of voluntary intoxication as a “defense,” he\n\nrecognized that such evidence was something a juror would “want to remember” or “take\n\ninto account” during punishment deliberations.\n\n       Regarding Earley’s reasons for not disclosing his volunteer work until individual\n\nvoir dire, the trial court was in the best position to evaluate Earley’s responses and\n\ndemeanor and to make decisions about his credibility. See Davis, 329 S.W.3d at 807.\n\nFurther, Earley’s views concerning evidence of voluntary intoxication did not disqualify\n\nhim. See Hernandez, 390 S.W.3d at 315. The court did not abuse its discretion by\n\ndenying the challenge for cause. Point of error three is overruled.\n\n       In point of error four, appellant asserts that the trial court erroneously overruled his\n\nchallenge for cause against prospective juror Timothy Tinsley. He argues that Tinsley\n\nwas disqualified because he: (1) was “death prone,” in that he would answer the special\n\nissues automatically after finding a defendant guilty of capital murder; (2) could not give\n\nfair consideration to mitigating evidence; and (3) would believe police officers over other\n\ntypes of witnesses.\n\n       The record shows that, during voir dire, Tinsley repeatedly stated that he would\n\nkeep an open mind and consider the evidence before determining his answers to the\n\nspecial issues. He also stated that, after finding a defendant guilty and affirmatively\n\f                                                                             MUHAMMAD –22\nanswering the future-dangerousness question, he could give fair consideration to the\n\nquestion of whether anything in the evidence constituted a sufficient mitigating\n\ncircumstance. Tinsley’s statement that he did not regard evidence of voluntary\n\nintoxication as mitigating did not disqualify him. See Standefer v. State, 59 S.W.3d 177,\n\n181 (Tex. Crim. App. 2001).\n\n       After defense counsel challenged Tinsley for cause, the trial court questioned\n\nTinsley about his ability to consider the mitigation special issue. Tinsley affirmed that, in\n\nconsidering the mitigation issue, he could review all of the evidence in the case to look\n\nfor any mitigating circumstance that would be sufficient to warrant a life sentence. When\n\nthe trial court asked him if he could keep an open mind and consider all of the evidence in\n\ndetermining the mitigation issue, Tinsley answered affirmatively.\n\n       Appellant also asserts that Tinsley’s tendency to find police officers more credible\n\nthan other witnesses disqualified him. We are not persuaded by this assertion. Tinsley\n\nindicated on his jury questionnaire that he would be inclined to find police officers more\n\ncredible than other witnesses. He acknowledged during voir dire that he would give\n\npolice officers “a little more respect than [he] would the average Joe.” However, Tinsley\n\nadded, “But everybody’s human, you know, so I would just – I would listen to the story\n\nand how it’s presented to determine, yeah.”\n\n       The trial court was in the best position to evaluate Tinsley’s responses concerning\n\nhis ability to consider all of the evidence when deliberating on the special issues. See\n\nDavis, 329 S.W.3d at 807. Further, Tinsley’s views concerning the credibility of police\n\f                                                                                 MUHAMMAD –23\nwitnesses did not disqualify him. See Feldman, 71 S.W.3d at 747 (stating that a\n\ndefendant is entitled to jurors who do not hold extreme or absolute positions regarding\n\nwitness credibility; if a venire person is more or less skeptical of a certain category of\n\nwitness, that does not make him subject to a challenge for cause). The court did not\n\nabuse its discretion by denying the challenge for cause. Point of error four is overruled.\n\n       In point of error five, appellant asserts that the trial court erroneously denied his\n\nchallenge for cause to prospective juror Robin Linn. Appellant asserts that Linn was\n\ndisqualified because: (1) her questionnaire answers showed that she was “death prone,”\n\nin violation of Wainwright v. Witt;3 and (2) she wanted to be on the jury, as indicated by\n\nher demeanor during voir dire and by her readiness to vary her answers during voir dire\n\nfrom the answers she had provided on her jury questionnaire.\n\n       Linn’s questionnaire answers and voir dire testimony demonstrated that she\n\nstrongly favored the death penalty and that she wanted to serve on the jury. However,\n\nLinn also stated during voir dire that she did not believe the death penalty was appropriate\n\nfor all homicides and that the punishment decision should depend upon the particular\n\nfacts and circumstances of each case. She stated that she would consider all of the\n\npunishment evidence. She further stated that, although she would want to know if a\n\ndefendant were remorseful, she would not require him to testify and express remorse.\n\n\n\n       3\n          We infer that appellant means to say that Linn’s views on capital punishment would\n“prevent or substantially impair the performance of [her] duties as a juror in accordance with\n[her] instructions and [her] oath.” Witt, 469 U.S. at 424.\n\f                                                                               MUHAMMAD –24\n       When defense counsel questioned Linn about her questionnaire answers that\n\nreflected her strongly favorable view of the death penalty, Linn repeatedly qualified those\n\nanswers. She stated that her answers on the questionnaire were “generic” and that she\n\nunderstood that she would have to know the facts of a particular case before she could\n\ndecide whether the death penalty would be an appropriate punishment. Linn stated that\n\nthe punishment decision would be based on the evidence and what she heard. Linn\n\naffirmed that she did not know how she would decide the special issues until she knew\n\nthe details: “I can’t tell you that I would go either way because I don’t know what the\n\nfacts of the case are.”\n\n       Defense counsel challenged Linn for cause, arguing that her demeanor\n\ndemonstrated that she was willing to change her answers during voir dire in order to be\n\nseated on the jury. The prosecutor disagreed, noting that Linn had “consistently said\n\n[she] could not go one way or the other without hearing all the evidence.”\n\n       Linn’s responses during voir dire did not establish that her views on capital\n\npunishment would prevent or substantially impair the performance of her duties as a juror\n\nin accordance with her instructions and her oath. See Witt, 469 U.S. at 424. We defer to\n\nthe trial court’s assessment of Linn’s credibility and demeanor. Davis, 329 S.W.3d at\n\n807. Without more, the fact that Linn wanted to be on the jury did not disqualify her.\n\nThe court did not abuse its discretion by overruling appellant’s challenge for cause. Point\n\nof error five is overruled.\n\n       In point of error six, appellant asserts that the trial court erroneously overruled his\n\f                                                                            MUHAMMAD –25\nchallenge for cause against prospective juror Charles Stout. He argues that Stout was\n\ndisqualified because his jury-questionnaire responses showed that he would require the\n\ndefendant to testify and he would shift the burden to the defense to prove the defendant’s\n\ninnocence. Appellant acknowledges that Stout qualified his questionnaire responses\n\nduring voir dire, but he argues that Stout’s voir dire statements were not “genuine.”\n\n       The record does not support appellant’s assertion that Stout would require a\n\ndefendant to testify. When questioned about a defendant’s right to remain silent, Stout\n\nstated that he understood the Fifth Amendment right not to testify and the fact that the\n\ndefense had no burden of proof. Stout stated that he, personally, would want to testify if\n\nhe were accused because he would want to show that the State’s evidence was wrong, but\n\nhe understood that someone else might make a different decision for reasons unrelated to\n\nguilt or innocence.\n\n       When the prosecutor first questioned Stout about the presumption of innocence,\n\nStout indicated that the defendant must have done something to get arrested:\n\n       Q. ([PROSECUTOR]). Absolutely. And that’s because the defendant, as\n       the defendant sits right here, now is presumed innocent. And that is a right\n       that everybody as a citizen has. Do you believe in that right?\n\n       A. I have [a] question about that.\n\n       Q. Okay.\n\n       A. Yes, I know that the final verdict of the law – you know, whether they’re\n       innocent or guilty, you have to present all the evidence. And this is part of\n       this process?\n\n       Q. Yes.\n\f                                                                        MUHAMMAD –26\nA. But if you’re – how can you say it? When you’re – you’re presented\nevidence and you’ve approached this individual that has, you know,\ncommitted this crime. And you want to – let’s see how I should put this?\n\nQ. Let me –\n\nA. I think that it comes down to – yes, I think this is the proper possess [sic]\nfor that. But when you arrest someone – you know, when they arrest\nsomeone, they have done something. You know, they had to have done\nsomething to be arrested.\n\nQ. Let’s talk about that a little bit. So, what the law says is, just because\nyou’re arrested doesn’t mean you’re guilty.\n\nA. Right.\n\nQ. People get arrested all the time and are found not guilty. Okay? So just\nbecause you’re arrested, you cannot use that. You cannot – you have to\npresume him and every defendant innocent, okay? Because everybody\nstarts out with that presumption. Then we have the burden to overcome that\npresumption. Does that make sense?\n\nA. I understand that process, I do. But like, if I’m sitting here, you don’t\nknow me. I’m not doing anything. You can’t, you know, just automatically\nconvict me of capital murder and send me away.\n\nQ. Exactly.\n\nA. You know, for life or for death.\n\nQ. Right.\n\nA. So, I have to have done something. I have to, you know, had to\ncommitted some type of crime [sic]. And so, that’s in order for them to\narrest you.\n\nQ. All right. And let me stop you right there. Because that’s a different\nburden. For a police officer to stop you and arrest you, that’s not beyond a\nreasonable doubt. Okay. They only need probable cause to do that.\n\nA. That’s the word I’m looking for.\n\f                                                                           MUHAMMAD –27\n      Q. Just because you’re arrested doesn’t mean you’re guilty beyond a\n      reasonable doubt.\n\n      A. Okay. That’s what I was looking for. That’s the word I was looking for.\n\n      Q. All right. Do you agree that police officers are human and they can\n      make mistakes just like everybody else?\n\n      A. Absolutely.\n\nAfter the prosecutor explained the law concerning the State’s burden, Stout indicated that\n\nhe could presume that a defendant was innocent:\n\n      Q. So the presumption of innocence says, any person that is arrested is not\n      automatically guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. They’re presumed\n      innocent. And who has the burden to prove that he’s guilty?\n\n      A. The State.\n\n      Q. That’s right. We have that burden. So, if we stand up and we don’t do\n      anything, and we just sit down and say, you know what, we rest our case.\n      What is your verdict?\n\n      A. Not guilty.\n\n      Q. Why?\n\n      A. Because you didn’t prove anything.\n\n      Q. That’s exactly right. So evidence that a person has been arrested,\n      evidence that a case has been indicted, none of those things can be used to\n      find a person guilty. Okay?\n\n      A. Right.\n\n      Q. Just like we talked about. Because police officers can make mistakes\n      just like anyone else. Someone could be arrested, maybe a person’s\n      walking out to their car this afternoon and someone comes up behind them\n      and mugs them, and take their purse. They don’t see who that person is.\n      Let’s say the police see a guy running about a mile down the road and they\n\f                                                                             MUHAMMAD –28\n      arrest that person. Does that mean that person is automatically guilty?\n\n      A. No.\n\n                                           ***\n\n      Q. So I’m just trying to let you know that there’s a different burden. That’s\n      a burden of reasonable suspicion or probable cause to arrest someone. And\n      then a case goes to [the] grand jury. Grand juries hear hundreds of cases a\n      day. Usually they take about, probably at the most, five minutes before they\n      return an indictment or they no bill the case. So that also can’t be used as\n      evidence of guilt. Do you think that’s fair?\n\n      A. Yes. Probable cause is the word I was looking for. Thank you, so much.\n\n      Q. So as we sit here right now, Mr. Muhammad is presumed innocent.\n\n      A. Yes.\n\n      Q. Can you keep an open mind and be fair, follow the law and say, right\n      now, he’s presumed innocent?\n\n      A. Yes.\n\nWhen questioned by the defense, Stout made a comment that was, arguably, inconsistent\n\nwith the presumption of innocence:\n\n      A. Honestly, you have to be fair. Just like the State had said earlier, it’s\n      important for you to do that. And I feel you should be fair.\n\n              All though [sic], yes, he was arrested and it’s presumed that he\n      committed this crime. But we have to be fair in making sure what’s\n      presented is accurate and correct. So it would be my job as a juror to listen\n      to all the evidence equally and fairly.\n\n(Emphasis added). Defense counsel did not question Stout about this apparent\n\nmisstatement. However, counsel did ask Stout about his previous comments to the\n\nprosecutor:\n\f                                                                              MUHAMMAD –29\n       Q. You mentioned that if an individual has been arrested he’s probably done\n       something to get here.\n\n       A. Yes.\n\n       Q. Okay. And I presume you feel that way?\n\n       A. Yes.\n\n       Q. Now, the law requires that you presume him innocent.\n\n       A. Right.\n\n       Q. Okay. At this point in stage [sic]. But some people – we’ve had people\n       come down here in the last two weeks and say, you know, [defense\n       counsel], I can’t presume him innocent. He’s come this far, I just can’t do\n       that.\n\n              And that’s fine. And we send them on their way and everything is\n       good. But we have to know. You know, you mentioned that in a round\n       about way two or three times, and we need to know that. Do you feel that\n       way, sir?\n\n       A. That he’s presumed innocent until the State proves otherwise, yes.\n\n       Q. Okay. So that’s your feelings on presumption of innocence. And just\n       because he’s been charged with something, you won’t consider that?\n\n       A. No.\n\n       Although some of Stout’s comments arguably suggested that he had difficulty with\n\nthe presumption of innocence, Stout also stated that he would not consider the facts that a\n\ndefendant had been arrested and indicted when determining whether the State had proven\n\nits case at the guilt-or-innocence phase. To the extent that Stout’s responses were\n\nvacillating, unclear, or contradictory, we afford particular deference to the trial court’s\n\ndecision. See Smith, 297 S.W.3d at 268. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in\n\f                                                                               MUHAMMAD –30\noverruling appellant’s challenge for cause. Point of error six is overruled.\n\n       In point of error seven, appellant asserts that the trial court erroneously overruled\n\nhis challenge for cause to prospective juror Allen Harrington. Appellant argues that\n\nHarrington was disqualified because he would not properly consider mitigating evidence\n\nregarding a defendant’s background, intoxication, and mental health. Appellant states\n\nthat Harrington’s questionnaire responses, which reflected his strong views in favor of the\n\ndeath penalty, were more truthful than his voir dire answers.\n\n       Harrington’s questionnaire responses indicate that he strongly favored the death\n\npenalty. In response to a question asking whether he would consider background\n\nevidence as mitigating, Harrington wrote, “bull shit, cold hard facts, and DNA.” When\n\nthe prosecutor asked him about this response during voir dire, Harrington explained, “I\n\ndon’t believe that the environment or any of that other stuff matters. If it doesn’t matter\n\nfor me it doesn’t matter for anybody. If I’m held to that everybody is held to that.” He\n\nacknowledged that, as a juror, he would have to listen to all of the evidence, but he added\n\nthat, after finding a defendant guilty and answering the future-dangerousness question\n\naffirmatively, “it will be a very high bar for me to hear mitigating circumstances once I’m\n\nthere that would take me to that place [of voting for a life sentence].”\n\n       Harrington responded similarly when questioned by defense counsel: “What in the\n\nworld could make me change my mind? Tell me what those mitigating circumstances are.\n\nTell me what that is. Like I said, that bar will be really high. It’s going to have to be\n\nreally something that tells me there is some mitigating circumstances.” Harrington also\n\f                                                                              MUHAMMAD –31\nclarified that, although he did not regard a person’s background as a “cause” of that\n\nperson’s actions, he recognized that a person “might not be able to truly overcome things\n\nin [his] background.” He added that he would be able to listen and consider evidence of a\n\ndefendant’s background. Harrington also modified his questionnaire response concerning\n\nwhether voluntary intoxication could be mitigating, stating that he disagreed with the law\n\nbut that he would be able to consider intoxication evidence with respect to the mitigation\n\nspecial issue.\n\n       Harrington was not required to regard any particular type of evidence as\n\nmitigating. See Standefer, 59 S.W.3d at 181. Nor was he required to regard any\n\nparticular quantity of evidence as “sufficiently mitigating.” Therefore, appellant has not\n\nshown that Harrington understood the requirements of the law but could not overcome his\n\nprejudice well enough to follow them. See Davis, 329 S.W.3d at 807. To the extent that\n\nHarrington’s answers were vacillating, unclear, or contradictory, we afford particular\n\ndeference to the trial court’s decision. See Smith, 297 S.W.3d at 268. The trial court did\n\nnot abuse its discretion in overruling appellant’s challenge for cause. Point of error seven\n\nis overruled.\n\n       In point of error nine, appellant asserts that the trial court erroneously overruled his\n\nchallenge for cause to Enrique Martinez. He argues that Martinez was disqualified\n\nbecause he was “an automatic death penalty juror” who would always impose a death\n\nsentence after finding guilt.\n\n       The record shows that Martinez strongly favored the death penalty but that he\n\f                                                                            MUHAMMAD –32\nunderstood the law and would follow it in assessing punishment. When questioned by\n\ndefense counsel about his personal thoughts about the death penalty, Martinez\n\nacknowledged that he would favor a death sentence for any capital murder without regard\n\nto the special issues, and he recognized that this view was contrary to the law. However,\n\nMartinez also clarified that, without regard to his personal feelings, he would follow the\n\nlaw as it had been explained to him:\n\n       Okay. But if I have to follow that I will follow that. I don’t know. If it\n       seems like – I don’t know how to explain it. But my belief is my belief.\n       But I was asked if I could listen to everything and come and follow this,\n       that I’ll be – I’m okay with it.\n\n              Am I explaining myself? I’m not sure.\n\nDefense counsel repeatedly encouraged Martinez to explain how he felt and what he\n\nbelieved, without regard to whether he could follow the law. In response, Martinez\n\nrepeatedly stated that he would follow the law regardless of his personal feelings.\n\n       Martinez indicated on his jury questionnaire that he did not believe that a\n\ndefendant’s background should be considered in determining punishment, “because no\n\nmatter of the background they made their choice.” When defense counsel asked him\n\nabout this response, Martinez reiterated his view that everyone can choose how to live\n\nand what to do. He added that he could take background evidence into consideration, but\n\nwhat would really matter to him would be “why” the defendant committed the offense at\n\n“that moment.”\n\n       Defense counsel asked Martinez how he could reconcile his statement that he\n\f                                                                              MUHAMMAD –33\nwould consider background evidence with his statement that background evidence would\n\nnot matter to him. Martinez explained that he would be able to listen and get to know\n\nmore about the defendant before making a judgment. Counsel then asked Martinez\n\nwhether, now that he knew the law and the wording of the mitigation special issue, he\n\ncould take background evidence into consideration. Martinez answered affirmatively.\n\n       Martinez also indicated on his questionnaire that he would not consider evidence\n\nof voluntary intoxication to be mitigating because “they made their choice.” When\n\ndefense counsel asked Martinez whether he could consider evidence of intoxication,\n\nMartinez stated that he would be able to listen and consider such evidence.\n\n       In response to a question concerning the testimony of mental-health professionals,\n\nMartinez had written on the questionnaire, “They should not [testify].” When defense\n\ncounsel asked him about this response, Martinez expressed his belief that sometimes\n\nmental-health professionals could be manipulated to testify in a defendant’s favor, and\n\nsometimes their testimony provided “just an excuse.” However, Martinez responded\n\naffirmatively when counsel asked him if he could “be open-minded and consider that kind\n\nof evidence.”\n\n       Martinez had no duty to regard any particular evidence as mitigating. See\n\nStandefer, 59 S.W.3d at 181. Further, to the extent that Martinez’s answers were\n\nvacillating, unclear, or contradictory, we afford particular deference to the decision of the\n\ntrial judge. See Smith, 297 S.W.3d at 268. We also defer to the trial court’s assessment\n\nof Martinez’s demeanor. See Davis, 329 S.W.3d at 807. The trial court did not abuse its\n\f                                                                              MUHAMMAD –34\ndiscretion in overruling appellant’s challenge for cause. Point of error nine is overruled.\n\n       In point of error ten, appellant complains that the trial court erroneously denied his\n\nchallenge for cause to prospective juror Paul Zugelder. He also complains that the trial\n\ncourt improperly curtailed defense counsel’s voir dire of Zugelder when it sustained the\n\nState’s objections to defense counsel asking Zugelder about the concept of mercy. He\n\nasserts that the court’s rulings sustaining the State’s objections gave Zugelder the\n\nimpression that defense counsel was being untruthful, so that Zugelder felt compelled to\n\nask the trial court to explain the law. Appellant concludes that the trial court’s rulings\n\nthereby “deprive[d] the defendant of seating what otherwise would have been a juror that\n\nwould have been a proper juror for the State.”\n\n       The factual basis of appellant’s point of error arose while defense counsel was\n\nexamining Zugelder concerning the mitigation special issue. Counsel had been focusing\n\non the statutory language of the mitigation issue, which was also available to Zugelder in\n\nwritten form. The record suggests that Zugelder had been reviewing that language as\n\ncounsel discussed it. Counsel then stated that various types of evidence had the potential\n\nto be mitigating and that each juror could decide whether he or she considered particular\n\nevidence to be sufficiently mitigating. Counsel then added, “But the law specifically tells\n\nus, specifically tells us, that a juror’s concept of mercy, a juror’s concept of mercy alone\n\nbased on anything they have heard in that case is sufficient, if they believe it to be\n\nsufficient. Now, do you hear what I’m saying there?” Zugelder responded that he did not\n\nsee anything in the language of the special issue to the effect that a juror’s concept of\n\f                                                                            MUHAMMAD –35\nmercy would be considered, and he asked defense counsel if it was “in there.” Counsel\n\nresponded, “No, if you read the words. But now the Supreme Court of the United States\n\nhas told us that that’s all it takes.”\n\n       The prosecutor then objected that defense counsel had misstated the law because\n\nthe sufficiency decision could not be based on “anything” the jury heard in the case but\n\nhad to be based on something from the evidence. The trial court sustained the objection.\n\nDefense counsel continued: “Your concept of mercy based on any piece of evidence that\n\nyou heard in the case. That’s the law. It doesn’t have to be written there. The courts\n\nhave told us that.” The prosecutor again objected, stating that the law was that jurors\n\ncould make a decision based on mercy but not that they were required to. Defense\n\ncounsel responded, “I’m not saying that they do, Judge,” and the court sustained the\n\nobjection.\n\n       Defense counsel again resumed his explanation of the concept of mercy:\n\n       The law in our land says that your concept, a juror’s concept of mercy based\n       on evidence that they heard in the case, if you believe it rises to the level\n       [of] sufficiency you can act upon that. And that is the law of our land.\n       Now, if we’re going to sustain an objection to that, Judge, then –\n\nThe prosecutor then objected to the sidebar and again stated that any idea of mercy had to\n\nbe “based on the evidence.” Defense counsel responded, “Based on the evidence. I said\n\nit.” The prosecutor asserted that counsel kept omitting that language. Defense counsel\n\ndisagreed. Counsel reiterated his explanation of the concept of mercy as it applied to the\n\nmitigation issue:\n\f                                                                               MUHAMMAD –36\n       Concept of mercy. That’s all it takes. And the only reason they stand up is\n       because in its simplicity it tells us, sir, that your concept of mercy alone\n       based on any piece of evidence you’ve heard in that case, if you believe it’s\n       sufficient, it’s sufficient under the law.\n\n              Now, I’ll ride that horse to the finish line, sir, because that’s the law\n       of our land. It doesn’t have to be written there because we know the\n       Supreme Court of the United States has told us that’s the law.\n\n       At that point, Zugelder turned to the trial judge for clarification, stating that he\n\nunderstood defense counsel to be saying that a juror could “feel pity for the defendant and\n\nmake a decision to kind of dismiss Special Issue Number 2 just if we don’t feel like he\n\nshould be punished to the full extent of the law.” The judge stated that he did not believe\n\nthat defense counsel had said that. He then asked the parties if he could clarify the\n\nmatter. Defense counsel responded, “Well, Judge, you can say anything you want to,\n\nJudge. I mean, the law is the law.”\n\n       The trial judge then provided a detailed explanation:\n\n       Well, I’ll just tell you on Special Issue Number 2 what our legislature has\n       envisioned, what the Supreme Court has upheld, is that the jury after having\n       found Special Issue Number 1 answering, yes, that in other words, that the\n       jury does consider the defendant that’s on trial to be a continuing threat to\n       the society or wherever he finds himself in the case of a capital murder case\n       – of course, it’s going to be the penitentiary – then you have to consider\n       Special Issue Number 2. In considering Special Issue Number 2, you have\n       to go back in your mind and in your deliberations with the other eleven\n       jurors and revisit all of the evidence that’s been presented in both phases of\n       the trial[,] the guilt-innocence phase, and the punishment phase. And there\n       might have been something that you heard when you heard it as it was\n       presented during the trial and you look at Special Issue Number 2 and\n       you’re taking into consideration all of the evidence including the\n       circumstances of the offense – so that’s the first part of the trial. That’s\n       where you look at the offense itself in the guilt-innocence phase of the trial,\n       and the defendant’s character and background. More of that probably\n\f                                                                             MUHAMMAD –37\n       comes in during the second phase of the trial than in the first phase of the\n       trial, but there could be some evidence that would come in in the first phase\n       of the trial considering that, and the personal moral culpability of the\n       defendant. “There is a sufficient mitigating circumstance or circumstances\n       to warrant that a sentence of life imprisonment without parole rather than a\n       death sentence should be imposed.” And I think what [defense counsel] is\n       telling you that’s your safety net or that’s the – he uses the example of a\n       light switch to turn the switch from death back to life in prison. If you\n       heard something in the trial you thought was sufficient, certain\n       circumstances or circumstance . . . and that you thought you know what? I\n       know this is a terrible crime. I know I found that I think he will be a future\n       danger, but because of that one circumstance I think that’s sufficient for me\n       to warrant giving him a life sentence rather than a death sentence. And that\n       can be based on anything that you want to base it on. And everybody is\n       individually different. In other words, what [defense counsel] says [is that]\n       the person sitting next to you or behind you might see something else that\n       you don’t think is mitigating, and you might see something that they don’t\n       think is mitigating.\n\nAfter hearing this explanation, Zugelder stated that he would not make a decision solely\n\nout of mercy but would “want something presented in evidence to justify a decision to\n\nchange the decision from death to life presented to justify that.”\n\n       Defense counsel again explained that the concept of mercy would be based on\n\nsomething in the evidence that would prompt Zugelder to conclude that the defendant\n\nshould receive a life sentence. Zugelder agreed that he could make a decision on that\n\nbasis. He explained that he had initially understood defense counsel’s question as asking\n\nhim whether he could “just make a decision just to be merciful.” Zugelder explained that\n\nhe had sought an explanation “from a third person” because that was what he had heard\n\neven though it was not what counsel had intended to say.\n\n       Defense counsel again clarified, “So when we talk about the concept of mercy, it’s\n\f                                                                              MUHAMMAD –38\nthe concept of being able to actually act upon your belief that there was something that\n\nyou heard that would warrant switching that back from death to life.” Zugelder again\n\naffirmed that he could do that. Defense counsel acknowledged that perhaps he had not\n\nexplained the concept very well the first time.\n\n       Defense counsel challenged Zugelder for cause based on his questioning being\n\ninterrupted by the prosecutor’s objections and based on the possibility that the trial court,\n\nin sustaining the prosecutor’s objections, had given Zugelder the impression that defense\n\ncounsel was dishonest. The prosecutor responded that he kept objecting because defense\n\ncounsel kept incorrectly explaining the law. In particular, the prosecutor asserted that\n\ndefense counsel never said that a juror could find a reason to consider mercy “based on\n\nthe evidence,” which confused Zugelder and prompted him to ask the trial court for\n\nclarification. The prosecutor averred that, after the judge cleared up Zugelder’s confusion\n\nabout the role of mercy in considering the mitigation issue, defense counsel asked the\n\nquestion properly. The trial judge stated that it was his impression that Zugelder was\n\nconfused about how the concept of mercy applied to the mitigation special issue.\n\n       Assuming that defense counsel could properly question Zugelder concerning his\n\nability to dispense mercy as defense counsel described the concept, we find that\n\nappellant’s argument is without merit. On this record, it appears that the prosecutor’s first\n\nobjection was proper because, as defense counsel acknowledged, counsel initially failed\n\nto specify that whatever Zugelder perceived as giving rise to mercy in the context of the\n\nmitigation issue had to be based on the evidence presented at trial.\n\f                                                                              MUHAMMAD –39\n       The trial court did not rule on the prosecutor’s second objection. Although\n\nunnecessary, the prosecutor’s third objection, that the law stated that a juror could\n\nconsider mercy but was not required to, did not contradict anything that defense counsel\n\nhad said, nor did it operate to prevent counsel from asking a question. Therefore, the trial\n\ncourt’s ruling sustaining that objection could not have affected Zugelder’s impression of\n\ndefense counsel’s credibility. Further, defense counsel continued to question Zugelder\n\nabout the concept of mercy and eventually elicited Zugelder’s answer to his question. See\n\nWoods v. State, 152 S.W.3d 105, 110 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004) (finding no harm where the\n\nrecord reflected that counsel was able to ask the venire person a question that was\n\nessentially the same as the denied question, or that he was able to elicit the same\n\ninformation that the denied question sought to elicit).\n\n       Based on the totality of Zugelder’s voir dire, the trial court could have reasonably\n\nconcluded that Zugelder had asked for clarification because he was confused by defense\n\ncounsel’s explanation, and not because he mistrusted defense counsel. See Feldman, 71\n\nS.W.3d at 744 (“When reviewing a trial court’s decision to grant or deny a challenge for\n\ncause, we look at the entire record to determine if there is sufficient evidence to support\n\nthe court’s ruling.”). The trial court did not abuse its discretion in overruling appellant’s\n\nchallenge for cause. Point of error ten is overruled.\n\n       In point of error eleven, appellant asserts that the trial court erroneously overruled\n\nhis challenge for cause to prospective juror David Hornstein. Appellant asserts that\n\nHornstein was disqualified based on his: (1) demeanor; (2) inability to consider\n\f                                                                             MUHAMMAD –40\ndefendant’s character and background in mitigation; (3) inability to consider mental\n\nhealth professionals’ testimony in mitigation; and (4) failure to consider voluntary\n\nintoxication as potentially mitigating.\n\n       The trial court was in the best position to evaluate Hornstein’s demeanor, and the\n\nrecord before us does not support appellant’s assertion that Hornstein’s demeanor\n\ndisqualified him from jury service. See Davis, 329 S.W.3d at 807. Concerning his\n\nattitudes toward potentially mitigating evidence, the record shows that Hornstein\n\nresponded negatively to a question on the juror questionnaire that asked whether a\n\ndefendant’s background should be considered in determining the mitigation special issue.\n\nWhen defense counsel questioned him about this response, Hornstein stated that if he had\n\nknown about the special issues when he filled out the questionnaire, he might have\n\nanswered the questions differently. Hornstein suggested that he had understood the\n\nquestions to ask whether evidence such as background would be relevant to the jury’s\n\ndetermination of guilt.\n\n       Hornstein expressed his understanding that the mitigation special issue was “an\n\nadditional filter through which [the defense is] hoping to provide a possibility of reducing\n\nthe severity of the punishment.” Defense counsel agreed with that characterization.\n\nHornstein stated that he thought it was a “valid filter,” but then he asked whether the jury\n\nwould hear any additional or different evidence after reaching a verdict of guilty. This\n\nquestion indicated that Hornstein was confused about the timing of the presentation and\n\nconsideration of evidence at different phases of the trial.\n\f                                                                            MUHAMMAD –41\n        Defense counsel answered Hornstein’s question by explaining that the jury would\n\nhear evidence at the punishment phase that was not relevant to the guilt-or-innocence\n\nphase. Counsel explained that the guilt-or-innocence phase was “like a photograph,” the\n\ncontents of which the State had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, while the punishment\n\nphase involved “the entire photo album . . . of the defendant’s life.” Hornstein then stated\n\nthat he would be able to consider all of the evidence in determining the mitigation special\n\nissue, including the defendant’s character and background: “If it provides the possibility\n\nof someone being spared the death penalty, yes, absolutely.”\n\n        On his juror questionnaire, Hornstein responded to a question about mental-health\n\nprofessionals by indicating that he thought that their testimony would “do more harm than\n\ngood.” When defense counsel asked him about this response, Hornstein explained that he\n\nwould be more concerned with a defendant’s history and past conduct than a\n\nprofessional’s opinion of the defendant after an hour-long interview. He stated that such\n\ntestimony was “something to pay attention to,” but it did not “hold as much validity as the\n\nwhole history of the person.” He stated that he did not regard psychology as a science,\n\nand he did not believe that mental-health professionals were any more qualified than other\n\npeople to “evaluate human beings.” He stated that he would listen to their testimony but\n\nhe would not regard it as “expert” testimony. Hornstein affirmed that he would keep an\n\nopen mind and consider all types of evidence. He stated that he would not discount the\n\nopinions of mental-health professionals but would consider them together with everything\n\nelse.\n\f                                                                              MUHAMMAD –42\n       Hornstein also wrote on the juror questionnaire that he did not think intoxication\n\nevidence should be mitigating. But when defense counsel questioned him about this\n\nresponse, Hornstein stated that, without regard to his personal opinions, he would be\n\nwilling to consider such evidence in mitigation because the law required him to do so.\n\n       Hornstein’s statements indicating his initial confusion about the role of\n\nbackground evidence, his skepticism with regard to the testimony of mental-health\n\nprofessionals, and his opinion that intoxication evidence was not mitigating, did not\n\ndisqualify him. See Feldman, 71 S.W.3d at 747; Standefer, 59 S.W.3d at 181. Further,\n\nafter the different phases of the trial had been explained to him, Hornstein affirmed that\n\nhe would consider all of the evidence when determining his answers to the special issues.\n\nTo the extent that Hornstein’s answers were conflicting or vacillating, we defer to the trial\n\ncourt’s decision. See Smith, 297 S.W.3d at 268. The trial court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in overruling appellant’s challenge for cause. Point of error eleven is\n\noverruled.\n\n       In point of error twelve, appellant asserts that the trial court erred by denying his\n\nchallenge for cause to prospective juror Andrea Griffith. He argues that Griffith was\n\ndisqualified because she was “mitigation impaired” and could not properly consider all\n\npotentially mitigating evidence. Appellant avers that Griffith’s responses on her written\n\nquestionnaire and during voir dire showed that she would not be able to adequately and\n\nproperly consider “any and all evidence that may be presented regarding sufficiently\n\nmitigating circumstances that are required by law.”\n\f                                                                               MUHAMMAD –43\n       Griffith’s questionnaire responses indicated that she would not regard background\n\nand intoxication evidence as mitigating. However, after the special issues were explained\n\nto Griffith during voir dire, she stated that she could give effect to all of the evidence\n\nsubmitted, including intoxication, when determining the mitigation special issue. Griffith\n\nwas not required to regard any particular type of evidence as mitigating, so long as she\n\ncould consider all of the evidence in deliberating on the mitigation issue. See Hernandez,\n\n390 S.W.3d at 315. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in overruling appellant’s\n\nchallenge for cause. Point of error twelve is overruled.\n\n       In point of error thirteen, appellant complains that the trial court erroneously\n\ndenied his challenge for cause to prospective juror Bradford McCutheon. Appellant avers\n\nthat McCutheon was disqualified because he could not give fair consideration to the\n\nspecial issues. The record shows that, although McCutheon’s questionnaire and voir dire\n\nresponses demonstrated that he strongly favored the death penalty, they also showed that\n\nhe would consider the evidence when deciding the special issues. McCutheon repeatedly\n\nstated during voir dire that he would not answer the special issues in such a way that the\n\ndeath penalty would result just because he had found someone guilty of capital murder.\n\nHe stated that he would follow the law and “keep an open mind all the way through” the\n\nprocess. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in overruling appellant’s challenge for\n\ncause. Point of error thirteen is overruled.\n\n       In point of error fourteen, appellant asserts that the trial court erroneously denied\n\nhis challenge for cause to prospective juror Elvira Corpus. He asserts that she was\n\f                                                                            MUHAMMAD –44\ndisqualified because she would automatically impose a death sentence after finding a\n\ndefendant guilty of capital murder.\n\n       Corpus indicated on her jury questionnaire that she thought that background\n\ncircumstances were sometimes “just an excuse” that should not be considered in\n\ndetermining proper punishment. However, during voir dire, Corpus stated that she could\n\nconsider such evidence. She specifically agreed that she could consider mental-health\n\nand substance-abuse evidence. She opined that intoxication evidence was not mitigating,\n\nbut she added that she could consider it. Corpus repeatedly stated that after finding a\n\ndefendant guilty, she could keep an open mind and hear the evidence before deciding the\n\nspecial issues. She stated that she would not automatically answer either special issue but\n\nwould listen to the evidence and make her decision on that basis.\n\n       Appellant also complains that the defense was prevented from asking Corpus a\n\nproper question “regarding automatic death” because the trial court sustained the State’s\n\nobjection. The record shows that Corpus answered “yes” to question number three on the\n\nquestionnaire, which asked, “If you are in favor of the death penalty in some cases, do\n\nyou agree that a life sentence, rather than the death penalty, would be appropriate under\n\nthe proper circumstances in some cases?” During voir dire, the prosecutor asked Corpus\n\nto elaborate on this response. Corpus replied that, depending on “what took place” during\n\nthe offense, the death penalty might not be appropriate. The prosecutor then explained to\n\nCorpus that there would be no conviction for capital murder if the offense was justified or\n\naccidental.\n\f                                                                              MUHAMMAD –45\n       Later, defense counsel followed up on this topic. He explained that a capital\n\nmurder always involves an intentional murder in which there is no justification and there\n\nis always violence. Counsel then asked Corpus whether she would change her answer to\n\nquestion number three, and she responded that she would. Counsel asked her what her\n\nnew answer would be, and Corpus answered, “Let’s see. Wait a minute. It would have to\n\nbe – no.” Counsel then asked more specifically, “So to question number three, knowing\n\nnow that there would be no justification you don’t agree that a life sentence would be\n\nappropriate under certain circumstances in a capital murder case?”\n\n       Before Corpus could answer the question, the prosecutor objected that Corpus had\n\n“already previously stated that in certain circumstances that if she feels it’s appropriate\n\nthat she could give a life sentence.” The trial court sustained the objection. Defense\n\ncounsel then asked Corpus whether her previous statement to the prosecutor was based on\n\na scenario involving justification or “no violence,” and Corpus answered affirmatively.\n\nShe reiterated that her answer to question number three would now be, “No.”\n\n       Assuming without deciding that the trial court abused its discretion by preventing\n\ndefense counsel from asking Corpus whether she had decided that a life sentence was not\n\nappropriate in a capital-murder case, we find no harm because counsel was allowed to\n\nelicit essentially the same information from Corpus when he asked her whether she would\n\nchange her answer to question number three, and whether she would now answer the\n\nquestion in the negative. See Woods, 152 S.W.3d at 110. A review of Corpus’s entire\n\nvoir dire reveals that the parties covered this area of inquiry thoroughly, and therefore\n\f                                                                               MUHAMMAD –46\nappellant was not harmed when the trial court sustained the prosecutor’s objection.\n\n       Corpus’s opinions regarding the mitigating value of particular types of evidence\n\ndid not disqualify her. See Hernandez, 390 S.W.3d at 315. She stated that she could\n\nconsider all of the evidence in determining the special issues. To the extent that Corpus\n\nvacillated or made conflicting statements, we defer to the trial court’s decision. See\n\nSmith, 297 S.W.3d at 268. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in overruling\n\nappellant’s challenge for cause. Point of error fourteen is overruled.\n\n       In point of error fifteen, appellant asserts that the trial court erroneously denied his\n\nchallenge for cause to venire person Temple Koestner. He avers that she was disqualified\n\nbecause she would “automatically equate a guilty verdict with a death sentence” and\n\nwould be unable to give appropriate consideration to the special issues.\n\n       Koestner’s questionnaire responses demonstrated that she strongly favored the\n\ndeath penalty. During voir dire, however, Koestner affirmed that, after convicting a\n\ndefendant of capital murder, she would have an open mind and would allow the evidence\n\nto inform her decision on punishment. She again affirmed that she would have an open\n\nmind when considering whether the evidence was sufficiently mitigating.\n\n       However, when defense counsel questioned her about situations in which she\n\nwould automatically assess the death penalty, Koestner identified cases involving the\n\nmurder of a child, the murder of two or more people, murder for hire, murder in the\n\ncourse of kidnapping or robbery, or murder of a fireman. Defense counsel asked\n\nKoestner for clarification, and it became apparent that she was confused about the\n\f                                                                             MUHAMMAD –47\nfunction of the special issues in assessing punishment:\n\n       Q. Okay. And so if you were on a hypothetical jury and you guys believed\n       each and every element beyond a reasonable doubt that would equate to a\n       guilty verdict on a capital murder, any of those that you just listed, then at\n       that point you would always answer those two special issues in such a\n       manner where the sentence would always be death. Is that what you’re\n       telling me, Ms. Koestner?\n\n       A. That I would answer them – no. We would have to go through those\n       particular situations as what the gentleman said earlier. If there’s a\n       reasonable doubt they would have to be found not guilty.\n\n       Q. No, ma’am. Let me back you up.\n\n       A. I’m sorry. I’m confused here then.\n\n       Q. It’s okay. You’re fine. You’re fine. But when we get to the point of\n       actually talking about a sentence, you have to remember we’re talking about\n       a death sentence. That’s punishment.\n\n       A. Right.\n\n       Q. So that means that a person has already been found guilty beyond a\n       reasonable doubt.\n\n       A. Okay.\n\n       Q. Okay. So I think –\n\n       A. Found guilty already?\n\n       Q. Yes, ma’am.\n\n                                            ***\n\n       Q. (BY [DEFENSE COUNSEL]) The law states, Ms. Koestner, is [sic] that\n       in order for a death sentence to be rendered, that after the individual has\n       been found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of that capital murder charge –\n       like I said, you listed them. We know what you’re talking about over there.\n\f                                                                              MUHAMMAD –48\n       A. Okay.\n\n       Q. That once the person has been found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt\n       the law states that in order to get to a death sentence those two special\n       issues have to be answered in a particular fashion. Special issue number\n       one has to be answered in the affirmative.\n\n               Special issue number two is that there’s nothing sufficiently\n       mitigating to warrant saving the defendant’s life. That’s what the law\n       states.\n\n       A. Yes.\n\n       Q. Now, some people say that their feelings are so strong in some of these\n       examples of capital murder, they understand what the law is, but regardless\n       of what the law is that once they reach a guilty verdict that at that point they\n       will also answer these two special issues in such a fashion where the\n       sentence will always be death. That’s my question to you.\n\n       A. So will I always answer death?\n\n       Q. Yes, ma’am.\n\n       A. No.\n\n       After additional discussion, Koestner expressed her understanding that after a\n\ndefendant was found guilty of capital murder, the sentence would be life without parole\n\nunless and until the jury answered the special issues in such a way that a death sentence\n\nwould be imposed.\n\n       Counsel then asked Koestner about her questionnaire response indicating that a\n\ncapital murderer would always pose a future danger. Koestner stated that she would not\n\nnecessarily find that a defendant was a future danger based solely on the offense of\n\nconviction because he would be in prison, and she did not think that a capital murderer\n\f                                                                              MUHAMMAD –49\nwould be a threat to prison society. When defense counsel asked Koestner if that meant\n\nthat she would always answer the future-dangerousness question in the negative, she\n\nacknowledged that she was confused. Counsel did not attempt to clarify Koestner’s\n\nposition further but instead moved on to the mitigation issue.\n\n       Koestner stated that she could take all of the evidence into consideration in\n\nanswering the mitigation issue. Defense counsel then asked her about her questionnaire\n\nanswer that indicated she would not consider a defendant’s background or character in\n\nmaking the punishment decision. Koestner explained that she had not known about the\n\nspecial issues when she answered the question. Once Koestner understood the special\n\nissues, she recognized that her questionnaire answer was incorrect under the law.\n\nKoestner stated that she still felt that people make their own choices, but now that she\n\nknew how the guilt phase and the punishment special issues worked, she could consider\n\nsuch evidence in reaching a decision on the mitigation special issue.\n\n       Appellant did not establish that Koestner understood the requirements of the law\n\nbut could not overcome her prejudice well enough to follow it. See Davis, 329 S.W.3d at\n\n807. After the law was explained to her, Koestner affirmed that she could set aside her\n\npersonal feelings. See Feldman, 71 S.W.3d at 744. To the extent that Koestner\n\nvacillated, we defer to the trial court’s decision. See Smith, 297 S.W.3d at 268. The trial\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in overruling appellant’s challenge for cause. Point of\n\nerror fifteen is overruled.\n\n       In point of error sixteen, appellant asserts that the trial court erroneously denied his\n\f                                                                             MUHAMMAD –50\nchallenge for cause to venire person Nancy Munn. He argues that Munn was disqualified\n\nbecause she was “death prone.” He avers that she could not consider the mitigation issue\n\nafter finding that a defendant was guilty and posed a future danger. He acknowledges\n\nthat during voir dire, Munn vacillated and equivocated concerning the special issues, but\n\nhe argues that “her true feelings” were that she would be unable to consider all of the\n\nevidence. In addition, appellant argues, Munn thought it might violate her conscience to\n\nfind a defendant not guilty due to a “technicality” even if the law demanded it, and she\n\nwould believe police officers over other witnesses.\n\n       The record does not support appellant’s allegations. When asked about the special\n\nissues, Munn affirmed that she would keep an open mind and listen to all of the evidence.\n\nWhen asked about her questionnaire answer indicating her belief that the death penalty\n\nshould be available in a case involving the death of a child, she stated that she would not\n\nautomatically impose the death penalty in such a case. When defense counsel asked\n\nMunn about her questionnaire response indicating that she thought the death penalty was\n\nimposed too seldom because of “the cost [to] taxpayers” of housing inmates and hearing\n\nappeals, Munn answered that she “was answering this questionnaire based on beliefs that\n\nI’ve had, but not really being involved in the circumstances where I’ve been put in a\n\nposition of having to make a decision like that.” She stated that she would decide the\n\nanswers to the special issues based on the facts before her and not on “the financial part.”\n\n       Defense counsel asked Munn about her questionnaire response indicating that a\n\ndefendant’s character and background should not be considered when determining the\n\f                                                                              MUHAMMAD –51\nproper punishment. Munn stated that she had not known the law when she completed the\n\nquestionnaire, but now that she had learned about the law during voir dire, she would\n\n“look at everything differently with different eyes.” When counsel asked Munn why she\n\nhad stated earlier that she felt that death would always be appropriate in a case involving\n\nthe death of a child, she stated that she had answered based on her personal beliefs, but\n\nnow that she was familiar with the process, she would take all of the facts into\n\nconsideration.\n\n       When asked what the result at the guilt phase would be if the State proved that the\n\ndefendant was guilty of the offense but failed to prove venue, Munn responded that she\n\nwould have to find that the defendant was innocent. She stated that she could do it but\n\nacknowledged that it would be hard. She affirmed that she could hold the State to its\n\nburden of proof.\n\n       Munn indicated on her questionnaire her belief that police officers were more\n\nlikely than the average person to tell the truth, but she also wrote that officers “are people\n\nso they make mistakes.” During voir dire, she testified that she would treat all witnesses\n\nthe same. She noted that people do not tell the truth all the time, police officers are\n\nhuman, and she would not automatically find an officer more credible than other\n\nwitnesses but instead would listen to the testimony to judge each witness’s credibility.\n\n       Munn’s testimony during voir dire showed that she would assess a sentence based\n\non the law and that she would consider any evidence offered in determining her answers\n\nto the special issues. See Feldman, 71 S.W.3d at 747. She did not say that she would be\n\f                                                                                MUHAMMAD –52\nunable to find a defendant not guilty based on a “technicality.” Her responses concerning\n\npolice officer testimony did not disqualify her. Id. To the extent that Munn’s answers\n\nwere vacillating, unclear, or contradictory, the trial court appropriately considered her\n\ndemeanor and credibility in determining her qualifications. See Threadgill v. State, 146\n\nS.W.3d 654, 667 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004). The trial court did not abuse its discretion in\n\ndenying appellant’s challenge for cause. Point of error sixteen is overruled.4\n\n       In point of error seventeen, appellant asserts that the trial court erroneously denied\n\nhis challenge for cause to prospective juror Ernest Hand. Appellant argues that Hand was\n\ndisqualified because he was “death prone.”\n\n       In his questionnaire responses, Hand indicated that he strongly favored the death\n\npenalty and he believed that a defendant’s background should not be considered when\n\ndetermining punishment. However, he also indicated that the death penalty should not be\n\napplied in all murder cases. During voir dire, Hand reiterated his opinion that some\n\nmurderers deserve a life sentence. He testified that after finding a defendant guilty of\n\ncapital murder, he could “refocus” and give the special issues a “fair look.” He would not\n\nautomatically answer the special issues in such a way that death would result. Instead, he\n\nwould “wait and listen” to all of the evidence before answering the special issues. Hand\n\nstated that, if the State’s evidence did not persuade him beyond all reasonable doubt that\n\n\n\n       4\n         Appellant exercised his second extra peremptory strike against venire person Robin\nSwarz, but he does not complain on appeal about the trial court’s denial of his challenge for\ncause against her.\n\f                                                                              MUHAMMAD –53\nthe defendant would continue to victimize others, he could answer the future-\n\ndangerousness question in the negative. Hand affirmed that, even after finding a\n\ndefendant guilty and a future danger, he could still answer the mitigation special issue in\n\nsuch a way that a life sentence would be imposed.\n\n       Hand testified that he would listen to any evidence presented on the special issues.\n\nSee Threadgill, 146 S.W.3d at 667. He was not required to regard evidence of\n\nbackground as mitigating. See Standefer, 59 S.W.3d at 181. To the extent that his\n\nresponses were vacillating or contradictory, we afford particular deference to the trial\n\ncourt’s decision. See Smith, 297 S.W.3d at 268. The trial court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in denying appellant’s challenge for cause. Point of error seventeen is\n\noverruled.\n\n       Because appellant has not shown that the trial court erroneously denied his\n\nchallenges for cause to at least three prospective jurors, we need not address his points of\n\nerror one and eight, concerning his challenges to voir dire members Milton Powell and\n\nAnthony Morrison. Points of error one and eight are overruled.\n\n                                  ALTERNATE JURORS\n\n       In points of error eighteen through twenty, appellant asserts that the trial court\n\nerroneously denied his challenges for cause to three prospective alternate jurors. Article\n\n35.15(d) provides, in relevant part, that if one or two alternate jurors are to be impaneled,\n\neach party is entitled to one peremptory challenge to be used against an alternate juror. In\n\naccordance with Article 35.15(d), appellant received one peremptory strike to use in the\n\f                                                                               MUHAMMAD –54\nselection of alternate jurors. Therefore, to demonstrate that he is entitled to relief,\n\nappellant must show that the trial court erroneously denied one of his challenges for cause\n\nto prospective alternate jurors. He must also show that he unsuccessfully requested an\n\nadditional peremptory strike which he would have used to remove another alternate juror\n\nwhom he identified as “objectionable” and who actually sat on the jury. See Busby v.\n\nState, 253 S.W.3d 661, 670 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008); see also Harris v. State, No. AP-\n\n76,810, slip op. at 24 & nn.51-52 (Tex. Crim. App. May 21, 2014) (not designated for\n\npublication), cert. denied, 135 S. Ct. 945 (2015) (finding no harm when jurors identified\n\nas objectionable did not participate in deliberations).\n\n       In point of error eighteen, appellant asserts that the trial court erroneously denied\n\nhis challenge for cause to prospective alternate juror Elizabeth McDaniel. He argues that\n\nMcDaniel was disqualified because her written questionnaire responses indicated that\n\nshe: (1) was “death prone”; (2) would automatically assess a death sentence after\n\nconvicting a defendant of capital murder; (3) would not adequately consider the future-\n\ndangerousness special issue; and (4) would require a defendant to show remorse before\n\nshe could answer the mitigation issue affirmatively.\n\n       As appellant acknowledges, the answers that McDaniel provided during voir dire,\n\nafter the law was explained to her, differed from her questionnaire responses. During\n\nvoir dire, McDaniel affirmed that, after finding a defendant guilty of capital murder, she\n\nwould be open to returning a sentence of either life in prison or death. She stated that she\n\nwould not automatically answer the special issues in such a way that a death sentence\n\f                                                                              MUHAMMAD –55\nwould result. She affirmed that, if she found a defendant guilty of capital murder, she\n\nwould hold the State to its burden to prove to her that the defendant would commit other\n\ncriminal acts of violence before she would answer the future-dangerousness special issue\n\naffirmatively. She also stated that she would be open to answering the mitigation issue\n\naffirmatively and would consider all of the evidence. On her questionnaire, McDaniel\n\nopined that criminals showed little remorse and faced light consequences. However, she\n\nstated during voir dire that she would not require a defendant to testify and show remorse\n\nbefore she could answer the mitigation issue affirmatively. The trial court did not abuse\n\nits discretion in denying appellant’s challenge for cause. Point of error eighteen is\n\noverruled.\n\n       In point of error nineteen, appellant asserts that the trial court erroneously denied\n\nhis challenge for cause to prospective alternate juror Arleen Jimenez. Appellant did not\n\nhave any more peremptory strikes, and his request for an additional strike was denied.\n\nJimenez was seated, over his objections, as an alternate juror. When another juror was\n\nremoved from the jury, Jimenez took his place. Appellant argues that Jimenez was\n\ndisqualified because, based on her questionnaire and voir dire responses, she would\n\nautomatically give a death sentence to anyone convicted of capital murder.\n\n       Jimenez’s written questionnaire responses indicated that she strongly favored the\n\ndeath penalty, but they also indicated that she did not think the death penalty was an\n\nappropriate punishment in all murder cases. During voir dire, Jimenez stated, “Well, I’m\n\nnot 100 percent death. . . . Probably before all these people were being released after 20\n\f                                                                               MUHAMMAD –56\nyears plus then I was probably at 100 percent. But recent activity here makes you wonder\n\nsometimes.” She repeatedly affirmed that, after finding a defendant guilty, she could\n\nkeep an open mind and not automatically answer the special issues. Jimenez twice opined\n\nthat drowning was a horrible way to die, but she added that knowing that the offense had\n\ninvolved drowning would not automatically lead her to impose a death sentence. Jimenez\n\nstated that the facts and severity of the offense, plus a prior criminal record, would be\n\nimportant to her in deciding the appropriate punishment. Jimenez expressed her\n\nunderstanding that the State had to prove future dangerousness beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt.\n\n         Jimenez affirmed that, even after answering the future-dangerousness question\n\naffirmatively, she would not automatically answer the mitigation issue negatively.\n\nAlthough she had noted on her questionnaire that too many people used background or\n\nintoxication as excuses for their misconduct, she stated during voir dire that she would be\n\nable to consider such evidence in mitigation. She stated that she “would have had to hear\n\neverything.”\n\n         To the extent that Jimenez’s answers were conflicting or vacillating, the trial court\n\nwas in the best position to evaluate her testimony and qualifications. See Smith, 297\n\nS.W.3d at 268. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant’s\n\nchallenge for cause. Point of error nineteen is overruled.\n\n         In point of error twenty, appellant complains that the trial court erroneously denied\n\nhis challenge for cause to prospective alternate juror Dan Blanks. However, the record\n\f                                                                                 MUHAMMAD –57\nshows that Blanks did not participate in jury deliberations. Therefore, appellant cannot\n\nshow any harm. See Busby, 253 S.W.3d at 670. Point of error twenty is overruled.\n\n       In points of error twenty-one and twenty-two, appellant asserts that the jury as\n\nconstituted was biased or prejudiced, thus depriving him of a fair trial in violation of his\n\nrights to due process guaranteed by the United States Constitution, the Texas\n\nConstitution, and Article 35.16. Because appellant has not demonstrated that any juror\n\nwho served on his case was biased or otherwise disqualified, or that he was otherwise\n\nharmed, he has failed to show that he was deprived of a fair trial. See Gray v. State, 233\n\nS.W.3d 295, 301 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007). Points of error twenty-one and twenty-two are\n\noverruled.\n\n                             GUILT-OR-INNOCENCE PHASE\n\n       Points of error twenty-three through twenty-six concern the admission of autopsy\n\nphotographs at the guilt-or-innocence phase. In points of error twenty-three and twenty-\n\nfour, appellant complains that the trial court erroneously admitted autopsy photographs of\n\nthe victims over appellant’s Rule 403 objection that their probative value was\n\nsubstantially outweighed by their prejudicial effect. T EX. R. E VID. 403.5 State’s Exhibits\n\n11 through 23 were autopsy photographs of Elijah. State’s Exhibits 4 through 9 were\n\nautopsy photographs of Naim.\n\n       Defense counsel argued that any probative value of the photographs was\n\n\n       5\n        Unless otherwise indicated, all future references to Rules refer to the Texas Rules of\nEvidence.\n\f                                                                            MUHAMMAD –58\nsubstantially outweighed by their prejudicial effect because the defense conceded that\n\nappellant committed the offense and also conceded “causation in the manner alleged.”\n\nCounsel further argued that the photographs were unnecessary because there was no legal\n\nor factual question about what they depicted. The trial court overruled appellant’s\n\nobjections, finding that the probative value of the photographs outweighed their\n\nprejudicial effect.\n\n         Defense counsel then argued that the photographs were numerous and duplicative.\n\nThe prosecutor responded that she had met with the medical examiner, Dr. Tracy Dyer,\n\nwho had selected the photographs that Dyer deemed necessary for her testimony\n\nconcerning “all the injuries on these two children that she observed during their\n\nautopsies.” The prosecutor noted that the nineteen photographs she offered were drawn\n\nfrom a group of “nearly 200 photographs.” The trial judge stated, “You have my ruling.”\n\n         Appellant complains that the photographs were excessive and numerous, some of\n\nthem were extremely gruesome, and they were all in color. He argues that the prosecutor\n\npresented them to appeal to jurors’ emotions. He suggests that the photographs were\n\nparticularly prejudicial because there was no controverted issue concerning the cause of\n\ndeath.\n\n         The admission of photographs over an objection is within the sound discretion of\n\nthe trial court. Sonnier v. State, 913 S.W.2d 511, 518 (Tex. Crim. App. 1995). Generally,\n\na photograph is relevant if verbal testimony concerning the matter depicted in the\n\nphotograph is also relevant. Gallo v. State, 239 S.W.3d 757, 762 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007).\n\f                                                                             MUHAMMAD –59\nRule 403 favors the admission of relevant evidence and carries a presumption that\n\nrelevant evidence will be more probative than prejudicial. Id. However, otherwise\n\nrelevant evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by\n\nthe danger of unfair prejudice. Id. A court may consider several factors in determining\n\nwhether the probative value of photographs is substantially outweighed by the danger of\n\nunfair prejudice, including, but not limited to: the number of exhibits offered, their\n\ngruesomeness, their detail, their size, whether they are black and white or color, whether\n\nthey are close-up, and whether the body depicted is naked or clothed. Id. The availability\n\nof other means of proof and the circumstances unique to each individual case must also\n\nbe considered. Id.\n\n       Although appellant did not present evidence or argument controverting the State’s\n\ncase at the guilt-or-innocence phase, he pleaded not guilty. Therefore, the State had the\n\nburden to prove every element of the offense of intentionally or knowingly causing the\n\ndeaths of two people during the same criminal transaction. See T EX. P ENAL C ODE\n\n§ 19.03(a)(7). The State had to prove not only that appellant inflicted the injuries that led\n\nto the victims’ deaths, but also that he acted with the conscious objective or desire to\n\ncause death or with awareness that his conduct was reasonably certain to cause death.\n\nSee, e.g., Landrian v. State, 268 S.W.3d 532, 537 n.27 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008); see also\n\nMedina v. State, 7 S.W.3d 633, 636 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999). The number and location of\n\nwounds inflicted are probative of a defendant’s intent to kill and his mental state at the\n\ntime of the offense. See Motilla v. State, 78 S.W.3d 352, 359 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002).\n\f                                                                              MUHAMMAD –60\nAdditionally, evidence of injury may be probative of the specific circumstances of the\n\nmurder and the veracity of a defendant’s statement to police. See, e.g., Rojas v. State, 986\n\nS.W.2d 241, 250 (Tex. Crim. App. 1998). Further, the State was entitled “to present to\n\nthe jury a picture of the events relied upon.” United States v. Fields, 483 F.3d 313,\n\n354-56 (5th Cir. 2007) (quoting United States v. Hall, 152 F.3d 381, 401 (5th Cir. 1998);\n\nOld Chief v. United States, 519 U.S. 172, 187 (1997)). The factual matter to which\n\nevidence is directed need not be in dispute. Id.; see also United States v. Cisneros, 203\n\nF.3d 333, 348 (5th Cir. 2000) (stating that a defendant’s offer to stipulate to murder\n\nvictim’s shooting did not reduce the probative value of evidence of how victim’s parents\n\nfound their son, pathologist’s testimony about victim’s autopsy, or photographs of\n\nvictim’s corpse).\n\n       Exhibits 11 and 12 were autopsy photographs of Elijah showing his appearance\n\nand clothing when his body arrived at the medical examiner’s office. Dr. Dyer used\n\nExhibit 11, which depicted fluid coming from Elijah’s nose, to explain the process of\n\npostmortem purging. She used Exhibit 12, which depicted paper bags placed over\n\nElijah’s hands, to explain the medical examiner’s office’s standard practice for preserving\n\nevidence and collecting fingernail clippings. Exhibit 13 depicted Elijah’s body after it\n\nhad been cleaned for the autopsy. Dyer used Exhibits 14 through 21 to describe the\n\ninjuries she observed during the external examination of Elijah. Each photograph was a\n\nclose-up of a specific part of Elijah’s body depicting a different area of injury.\n\nSpecifically, Exhibits 14 and 15 depicted Elijah’s facial injuries; Exhibit 16 depicted a\n\f                                                                             MUHAMMAD –61\nlinear abrasion on his back; Exhibit 17 depicted an abrasion on the outside of his left leg;\n\nExhibit 18 depicted abrasions and a blister on the sole of his left foot; Exhibit 19 depicted\n\nabrasions on the top of his right foot; Exhibit 20 depicted abrasions on the back of his\n\nlower right leg; and Exhibit 21 depicted an abrasion on his wrist. Exhibits 22 and 23\n\ndepicted injuries that Dyer observed during the internal examination of Elijah.\n\nSpecifically, Exhibit 22 depicted bruising on the underside of Elijah’s scalp that was not\n\nclearly visible externally. Exhibit 23, a photograph of a section of Elijah’s upper airway\n\nthat had been removed from his body, depicted the dirt and debris in Elijah’s airway.\n\n       Dyer used Exhibits 4 through 9, autopsy photographs of Naim, in the same manner\n\nshe had used the autopsy photographs of Elijah. Specifically, Exhibit 4 showed Naim’s\n\nappearance and the clothes he was wearing when he arrived at the medical examiner’s\n\noffice. It also depicted white foam coming from his nose and mouth, the result of\n\npostmortem purging. Exhibit 5 showed Naim’s body after it had been cleaned for\n\nautopsy. Exhibits 6 through 8 were close-up photographs of specific parts of Naim’s\n\nbody. Each photograph depicted a different area of injury that Dyer observed during the\n\nexternal examination. Specifically, Exhibits 6 and 7 depicted abrasions on the right side\n\nof Naim’s face and forehead, and Exhibit 8 depicted abrasions on the back of his hand.\n\nExhibit 9 depicted injuries that Dyer observed during the internal examination,\n\nspecifically, bruising on the underside of Naim’s scalp, caused by impacts that did not\n\f                                                                                MUHAMMAD –62\nresult in visible external bruising.6\n\n       Dyer was entitled to testify to the manner of death, cause of death, and the number\n\nand types of injuries the victims sustained. See Long v. State, 823 S.W.2d 259, 274, 275\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1991). These were issues as to which the photographs were relevant.\n\nSee id. The fact that appellant did not contest the manner of death did not render the\n\nmedical examiner’s testimony or the photographs irrelevant. See id. The State minimized\n\nthe number of photographs and used only those necessary for Dyer’s testimony. These\n\nphotographs were not particularly numerous or gruesome. See Gallo, 239 S.W.3d at 763-\n\n64. The photographs of internal injuries depicted bruising and other damage that were\n\nnot visible externally and which were attributable to appellant’s actions. Therefore, the\n\nphotographs were relevant to establishing the manner of death. See Ripkowski v. State, 61\n\nS.W.3d 378, 392-93 (Tex. Crim. App. 2001) (finding that a photograph of an organ that\n\nhad been removed from the victim’s body, depicting bruising that Ripkowski inflicted\n\nduring the offense, was not unduly prejudicial and was highly relevant to the manner of\n\ndeath); see also Gallo, 239 S.W.3d at 763 (stating that autopsy photographs showing\n\ninjuries on the underside of the victim’s scalp that were not visible externally were highly\n\nprobative to show the full extent of the injuries appellant inflicted, and, although they\n\nwere gruesome, there was no danger that the jury would attribute the mutilation caused by\n\nthe autopsy procedure to the defendant). The trial court did not abuse its discretion by\n\n\n       6\n          Appellant identifies State’s Exhibit 9 as an “extreme closeup of [Naim’s] chest showing\nbruising.” This identification does not correspond to the exhibit in the reporter’s record.\n\f                                                                               MUHAMMAD –63\nadmitting State’s Exhibits 11 through 23 and 4 through 9. Points of error twenty-three\n\nand twenty-four are overruled.\n\n       In points of error twenty-five and twenty-six, appellant asserts that the trial court\n\nerroneously admitted State’s Exhibits 77 and 78, autopsy-identification photographs of\n\nElijah and Naim that were introduced during Kametra’s testimony. Each photograph was\n\na close-up view of the face and bare upper torso of the deceased child. The medical\n\nexaminer’s placard showing the autopsy-identification number was placed across the\n\nchild’s chest. Appellant complains that the jury had already seen autopsy photographs of\n\nthe children, including photographs of their faces, during the medical examiner’s\n\ntestimony. He “incorporates by reference as if set out verbatim the argument and\n\nauthorities presented in [points of error] 23 and 24 to support this issue that the trial court\n\nreversibly erred in overruling Appellant’s objections to State’s Exhibits 77 and 78.”\n\n       At trial, defense counsel objected under Rule 403 to the admission of these\n\nphotographs. He asserted that there was no issue regarding the identities of the children\n\nand that he had offered to stipulate to their identities. Counsel further argued that, in light\n\nof the defense’s concession of guilt, the photographs had no probative value and were\n\noffered only to provoke a visceral response from Kametra during her testimony. The\n\nprosecutor responded that, because appellant pleaded not guilty, the State was required to\n\nprove the victims’ identities beyond a reasonable doubt. The prosecutor also noted that\n\nthe State had not yet proven the victims’ identities because Dyer did not have personal\n\nknowledge of their identities. The trial court examined the photographs and overruled\n\f                                                                               MUHAMMAD –64\nappellant’s objection. At the conclusion of Kametra’s direct examination, the prosecutor\n\nshowed her State’s Exhibits 77 and 78. She identified the child depicted in Exhibit 77 as\n\nElijah and the child depicted in Exhibit 78 as Naim.\n\n         These photographs were relevant because Kametra’s identification of the children\n\nlinked Dyer’s autopsy reports and testimony to the victims named in the indictment. The\n\nphotographs were not particularly gruesome; they portrayed nothing more than the\n\nvictims’ condition due to the injuries appellant had inflicted. As such, their probative\n\nvalue was not unduly outweighed by their prejudicial effect. See Young, 283 S.W.3d at\n\n875. Points of error twenty-five and twenty-six are overruled.\n\n         In point of error twenty-seven, appellant claims that the trial court erroneously\n\noverruled his objection that the State’s closing argument was “outside the scope of\n\nguilt/innocence” and was therefore improper. He asserts that the State’s argument was\n\nintended to prejudice the jury against him. He further asserts that the argument was\n\n“manifestly improper and extreme in nature” and injected new and harmful facts into the\n\ntrial.\n\n         In relevant part, the record contains the following argument, objection, and ruling:\n\n         [PROSECUTOR]: Y’all can remember the evidence that you heard\n         yesterday, Monday. He took those kids down there and he knew what he\n         was going do, and he told them to sit down.\n\n                What did he tell them? Put your head down in the water and act like\n         you are swimming. And that’s when he took his hands and he put them on\n         each kid and he held their head[s] under the water. Can you imagine what\n         that must have felt like? What were those kids thinking?\n\f                                                                              MUHAMMAD –65\n       [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Judge, again, I’m going to object again. This\n       entire argument is now outside the scope of guilt/innocence and we’re\n       going to object to it at this phase of the trial.\n\n       THE COURT: I will overrule the objection.\n\nArguably, the prosecutor’s questions asking jurors if they could imagine what the children\n\nwere feeling and thinking directed the jury’s attention to a matter that was not relevant to\n\nappellant’s guilt or innocence. However, the jury had heard appellant’s own statement to\n\nthe police in which he described Elijah crying for his mother, Naim asking appellant not\n\nto kill them, and Naim kicking when appellant held him down. Therefore, the\n\nprosecutor’s question arguably invited a reasonable deduction from the evidence. See,\n\ne.g., Berry v. State, 233 S.W.3d 847, 860 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007). Contrary to appellant’s\n\nposition, the question did not inject new and harmful facts into the trial.\n\n       The prosecutor’s argument was, at most, mildly improper. Cf. Martinez v. State,\n\n17 S.W.3d 677, 693 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000). Further, the evidence supporting\n\nappellant’s conviction was exceptionally strong even absent this argument. See Freeman\n\nv. State, 340 S.W.3d 717, 728-29 (Tex. Crim. App. 2011). We find that the error, if any,\n\ndid not affect appellant’s substantial rights. See id. Point of error twenty-seven is\n\noverruled.\n\n                                  PUNISHMENT PHASE\n\n       In point of error twenty-eight, appellant claims that the trial court erroneously\n\noverruled his objection to a CPS investigator’s testimony concerning her conversation\n\nwith appellant. Specifically, he complains that a CPS investigator, Pamela Womack, and\n\f                                                                             MUHAMMAD –66\na CPS case worker, Eduardo Beale, interviewed appellant while he was in jail without\n\nproviding Miranda7 warnings.8 Citing Wilkerson v. State,9 appellant acknowledges that\n\npolice officers and CPS workers “generally run on separate, parallel paths.” He argues,\n\nhowever, that the paths of CPS and the police converged in this case in such a way that\n\nthey were investigating the criminal offense in tandem, and therefore Miranda warnings\n\nand Article 38.22 compliance were required. He submits that the CPS employees who\n\ninterviewed him had become agents of the State. Therefore, appellant reasons, the trial\n\ncourt erred by admitting the complained-of testimony.\n\n       “Although state employment clearly makes a person an ‘agent of the State,’ that\n\nlabel does not, by itself, make the person an ‘agent of the State’ for the purpose of\n\ndefining ‘custodial interrogation.’” Wilkerson, 173 S.W.3d at 528. The law does not\n\npresume that a CPS worker is an agent of the police or prosecutor. Id. at 529-30. The\n\nperson alleging the agency relationship has the burden of proving it. Id. at 529. We\n\nexamine the entire record to determine whether the investigative paths of CPS and the\n\npolice converged in a particular case. Id. at 530.\n\n       The record does not reflect that Womack and Beale were acting as\n\n“instrumentalit[ies]” or “conduit[s]” for the police or prosecution when they interviewed\n\nappellant. See Wilkerson, 173 S.W.3d at 530. Womack testified that she interviewed\n\n       7\n           Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).\n       8\n           Beale did not testify at trial.\n       9\n           173 S.W.3d 521, 527 (Tex. Crim. App. 2005).\n\f                                                                              MUHAMMAD –67\nappellant as part of a CPS investigation to determine the placement of appellant and\n\nKametra’s surviving child, Jeremiah. Womack stated that she did not speak to law-\n\nenforcement officials about the case before she interviewed appellant, and she did not\n\nknow whether Beale had done so. See id. She acknowledged that CPS would share\n\ninformation from its investigations with law enforcement if requested to do so. However,\n\nthis fact alone did not transform her into an agent of law enforcement. See id. at 533.\n\n       Appellant did not meet his burden of showing that the CPS interview amounted to\n\na custodial interrogation. Therefore, the trial court’s decision to admit Womack’s\n\ntestimony over appellant’s objection did not constitute an abuse of discretion. See Berry,\n\n233 S.W.3d at 856. Point of error twenty-eight is overruled.\n\n       In point of error twenty-nine, appellant asserts that the trial court erroneously\n\noverruled his objection to State’s Exhibit 173, “a purported judgment of misdemeanor\n\noffense of evading arrest in Cause No. M97-57574,” because there were no identifying\n\nfingerprints on the judgment “to legally tie” the conviction to him. He reasons that,\n\nwithout identifying evidence tying the document to him, the jury could not find beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt that he committed the extraneous offense. At trial, defense counsel\n\nobjected to the “lack of a predicate and failure to establish correlation between the exhibit\n\nand the Defendant.”\n\n       To establish that appellant had been convicted of a prior offense, the State had to\n\nprove that the prior conviction existed and that appellant was linked to it. See Flowers v.\n\nState, 220 S.W.3d 919, 921 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007). The State was not required to prove\n\f                                                                               MUHAMMAD –68\nthese elements by any specific mode of proof. See id. The State could prove these\n\nelements in a number of different ways, including documentary proof that contained\n\nsufficient evidence to establish them. See id. at 921-92. The trier of fact looks at the\n\ntotality of the admitted evidence to determine if these two elements are proven. Id. at\n\n923.\n\n       In this case, the record reflects that State’s Exhibits 172 and 173 were certified\n\ncopies of judgments and court records in consecutive case numbers reflecting that\n\nsomeone with appellant’s name, date of birth, address, and physical description was\n\nconvicted of burglary of a vehicle and evading arrest. The offense dates were the same\n\nand the judgments were entered on the same date. Exhibit 172, the judgment pertaining\n\nto burglary of a vehicle, contained appellant’s fingerprints, but Exhibit 173, which\n\npertained to a conviction for evading arrest, did not. Considering the totality of the\n\nevidence, the fact finder could view the identifying information contained in State’s\n\nExhibit 173 in conjunction with the identical identifying information in Exhibit 172, plus\n\nthe additional fingerprint evidence contained in that exhibit, and determine that a prior\n\nconviction for evading arrest existed and that appellant was the person convicted. See id.\n\nat 923-24. Point of error twenty-nine is overruled.\n\n       In point of error thirty, appellant asserts that the trial court erroneously overruled\n\nhis objection that Officer Chris Havens testified from a document not in evidence. In\n\npoint of error thirty-one, appellant complains that the trial court erred when it allowed\n\nHavens to testify to appellant’s personal identifying characteristics after the State\n\f                                                                             MUHAMMAD –69\nimproperly refreshed Havens’s recollection with a police report made by a third party.\n\nAppellant states that defense counsel’s objection “was continuously overruled.”\n\nAppellant briefs these points together.\n\n       Appellant refers to Havens by name, but he provides a record cite to Dallas Police\n\nLieutenant Harold Andrews’s testimony. On this basis, we could reject this claim as\n\ninadequately briefed. T EX. R. A PP. P. 38.1. In the interests of justice, however, we will\n\naddress it on the merits.\n\n       We infer from our comparison of appellant’s brief to the trial record that appellant\n\nintends to challenge the admission of Andrews’s testimony rather than Havens’s\n\ntestimony. We draw this inference because the record of Havens’s testimony does not\n\nsupport appellant’s assertion that defense counsel’s objections were “continuously\n\noverruled,” but the record arguably does support appellant’s assertion that his objections\n\nto Andrews’s testimony were “continuously overruled.”\n\n       The record reflects that Andrews reviewed the police report of the extraneous\n\noffense in question before he testified. Andrews testified that he remembered hearing a\n\ncall to respond to a burglary of a vehicle at about 4:00 a.m. on July 27, 1994. Andrews\n\npersonally did not respond to the scene of the burglary. Rather, he heard the description\n\nof the suspects and, based on that description, he looked for suspects in the area. He\n\n“found Mr. Muhammad” and took him back to the scene of the offense, where one of the\n\ncomplainants identified him.\n\n       Andrews testified that the officers who responded to the scene prepared the written\n\f                                                                            MUHAMMAD –70\npolice report. However, Andrews also testified that he would have asked the suspect for\n\nhis name and date of birth when he detained him because that was “standard procedure.”\n\nThe prosecutor asked Andrews if he “remember[ed] the identifying information on Mr.\n\nMuhammad.” Andrews responded that he remembered that the suspect was fifteen years\n\nold and his name was Naim Muhammad, but other than that, Andrews did not recall the\n\ndetails. The prosecutor invited Andrews to refresh his memory by reviewing the police\n\nreport and then asked:\n\n       Q. Does it have a date of birth for that?\n\n       A. 5-3 of 1979.\n\n       Q. Is he a black or white male?\n\n       A. He is a black male.\n\n       At that point, defense counsel objected that Andrews was testifying from a report\n\nthat was not in evidence. The trial court ruled that the witness could refresh his memory\n\nand testify. Counsel then stated that Andrews’s testimony was admissible only if the\n\nreport refreshed his memory and did not provide him with information: “If he just reads\n\nit and he says that’s what it says, that is not refreshed testimony, Judge.” Defense counsel\n\nthen took Andrews on voir dire. Counsel asked Andrews whether, at the time of trial, he\n\nhad personal knowledge of the information contained in the report. Andrews responded\n\nthat he did not understand the question.\n\n       Defense counsel then posed a question that involved a double negative: “Other\n\nthan reading and right now saying what the document says, there is no way it is not going\n\f                                                                             MUHAMMAD –71\nto refresh your actual recollection so that you can state independently that information\n\ncontained on that document is accurate, can you?” Andrews’s one-word answer,\n\n“Correct,” did not resolve the matter of whether the document refreshed his recollection\n\nor, alternatively, provided him with new information.\n\n       After this exchange, counsel renewed his objection, but he did not obtain a new\n\nruling. The prosecutor then resumed her questioning. She asked Andrews if he obtained\n\nthe suspect’s name when he detained him. Andrews reiterated that he did not recall\n\nspecifically, but he was sure that he had done so, because “[t]hat’s just standard\n\nprocedure.” The prosecutor again asked Andrews if he had reviewed the report and if he\n\nknew that the person he detained was Naim Muhammad. The defense again took\n\nAndrews on voir dire, leading to the following exchange:\n\n       Q. Officer, other than the fact that your testimony to this jury so far has\n       been you were called to the scene, you snatched up the fellow, you carried\n       him back and you dropped him off. That’s, basically the extent of your\n       involvement in this incident, is it not?\n\n       A. More or less.\n\n                                            ***\n\n       A. I’m sure when I first approached him I got his name and date of birth,\n       that kind of information from him. I do that with everyone that I come in\n       contact with.\n\n       Q. There is nothing in these documents that are before you, at this point in\n       time, there is not a single document here that you prepared this? [sic]\n\n       A. That I actually wrote, no, sir.\n\n       Q. Right. And so, they are not even asking you to refresh your recollection\n\f                                                                               MUHAMMAD –72\n       from a document that you prepared. They are asking you to refresh your\n       recollection from a document that somebody else prepared?\n\n       A. Yes, sir.\n\nCounsel again objected, and his objection was overruled. The prosecutor then continued\n\nher direct examination, again eliciting Andrews’s testimony that he collected information\n\nabout the suspect, including his name and date of birth. Defense counsel again objected,\n\narguing that Andrews lacked personal knowledge of the answers to the prosecutor’s\n\nquestions. The court overruled the objection, and defense counsel again took Andrews on\n\nvoir dire:\n\n       Q. Is there anything on that document, sir, that you prepared?\n\n       A. No, sir.\n\n       Q. Is there anything on that document, sir, that was prepared at your\n       direction or in your presence?\n\n       A. At my direction?\n\n       Q. Or in your presence.\n\n       A. Not in my presence, no.\n\n       Q. You have no personal information or personal knowledge as to any of\n       the information contained on that document, do you, sir?\n\n       A. Yes, sir, I do.\n\n       Q. Other than the fact that it describes you as bringing somebody back from\n       the scene?\n\n       A. Correct.\n\n       Q. Other than that –\n\f                                                                             MUHAMMAD –73\n       A. At the particulars of the situation at the time, yeah.\n\n       Q. Right. But not as to the identification. Not as to the identifying factors\n       contained on that report; that’s correct, is it not?\n\n       A. As I said before I am sure I got that information.\n\n       Q. That’s a yes or no, sir. That’s a yes or no.\n\n       A. Okay. No.\n\nCounsel again objected, the court again overruled the objection, and the prosecutor again\n\nelicited Andrews’s testimony that he obtained the suspect’s name and date of birth.\n\nDefense counsel again objected that Andrews did not have personal knowledge of\n\nappellant’s identifying information. The prosecutor responded that it was appropriate for\n\nAndrews to refresh his memory by reviewing the police report “because he was there that\n\nday.” Defense counsel argued that it was improper for a witness to refresh his\n\nrecollection from a document that was not prepared in the witness’s presence or at his\n\ndirection. The trial court overruled the objection and granted defense counsel a running\n\nobjection to Andrews’s testimony. The prosecutor again elicited Andrews’s testimony\n\nnaming the suspect as Naim Muhammad and providing his date of birth as May 3, 1979.\n\n       Regardless of whether the prosecutor properly used the police report to refresh\n\nAndrews’s recollection, Andrews had already testified to the suspect’s name and date of\n\nbirth before defense counsel made his initial objection. As to this portion of Andrews’s\n\ntestimony, counsel’s belated objection did not preserve error. See T EX. R. A PP. P. 33.1;\n\nLagrone v. State, 942 S.W.2d 602, 618 (Tex. Crim. App. 1997) (“If a defendant fails to\n\f                                                                             MUHAMMAD –74\nobject until after an objectionable question has been asked and answered, and he can\n\nshow no legitimate reason to justify the delay, his objection is untimely and error is\n\nwaived.”). Moreover, even if we assume that the trial court erred by overruling\n\nappellant’s subsequent objections, appellant cannot show that the trial court reversibly\n\nerred because the same information – the suspect’s name and date of birth – was already\n\nbefore the jury. See Coble, 330 S.W.3d at 282. Points of error thirty and thirty-one are\n\noverruled.\n\n       In point of error thirty-two, appellant complains that the trial court erroneously\n\noverruled his objection that Garland Police Officer Brandon Hernandez did not have\n\npersonal knowledge of the information he provided during his testimony because he read\n\nthe information from a report. Appellant avers that the prosecutor did not properly use\n\nthe writings to refresh Hernandez’s recollection. Specifically, appellant contends that the\n\nprosecutor had Hernandez testify from a document that was not in evidence in order to\n\nenter otherwise inadmissible information into evidence.\n\n       Hernandez’s testimony provided an account of his and other officers’ response to a\n\nburglary alarm at 3:30 a.m. on July 4, 1999. When police officers responded to the scene,\n\nthey discovered a car parked in a cul-de-sac with its headlights turned off and its engine\n\nrunning. The car sped away as an officer approached it. Officers pursued and stopped\n\nthe car. They discovered a loaded shotgun and a screwdriver in the car, as well as a bag\n\nof marijuana outside the car that appeared to have been thrown from the car. All three of\n\nthe car’s occupants were arrested. One of the car’s occupants identified himself as Naim\n\f                                                                               MUHAMMAD –75\nMuhammad. He provided a birth date that enabled officers to confirm his identity against\n\npolice records.\n\n       Defense counsel then objected that Hernandez’s testimony was hearsay. The trial\n\ncourt overruled the objection and allowed defense counsel to voir dire Hernandez, who\n\nacknowledged that he did not recall whether he personally had interviewed appellant and\n\nverified his identifying information against police records. Counsel then objected that\n\nHernandez lacked personal knowledge of the events about which he had testified. The\n\ntrial court overruled the objection. On cross-examination, defense counsel elicited\n\nHernandez’s testimony that appellant had been a passenger in the back seat of the car.\n\n       Whether or not the prosecutor properly used the police report to refresh\n\nHernandez’s memory, appellant’s belated objection did not preserve error. See T EX. R.\n\nA PP. P. 33.1; Lagrone, 942 S.W.2d at 618. Point of error thirty-two is overruled.\n\n       In point of error thirty-three, appellant asserts that the trial court erroneously\n\noverruled his objection to the testimony of Dallas Police Officer David Solomon\n\nconcerning the circumstances under which he arrested appellant. Appellant appears to\n\nargue that Solomon’s reference to a suspected attempted automobile theft was prejudicial\n\nbecause appellant was cleared of any involvement in that offense.\n\n       Solomon’s testimony was offered to connect appellant to a burglary of a habitation\n\noffense that had been described in previous testimony. Solomon referred to the attempted\n\nautomobile theft in the course of explaining how and why he arrested appellant for the\n\nburglary. Specifically, Solomon testified that he stopped the car in which appellant was\n\f                                                                              MUHAMMAD –76\nriding after a witness informed Solomon that the car resembled one that was observed\n\nduring an attempted automobile theft. Based on the witness’s statement, Solomon\n\ndetained appellant and the car’s other occupants, but all of them were cleared of any\n\ninvolvement in the attempted automobile theft. However, Solomon discovered that\n\nappellant had outstanding warrants for burglary and arrested him on that basis.\n\n       Assuming without deciding that the trial court erred in admitting Solomon’s\n\ntestimony concerning the attempted automobile theft, appellant was not harmed. See\n\nCoble, 330 S.W.3d at 280 (noting that if the improperly admitted evidence did not\n\ninfluence the jury or had but a slight effect upon its deliberations, such non-constitutional\n\nerror is harmless). Solomon testified that appellant was cleared of any involvement in\n\nthat offense. Further, the trial court included in the written jury charge an instruction that\n\nthe jury could consider extraneous offenses only if the offenses had been proven beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt:\n\n       You are instructed that if there is any evidence before you in this case\n       regarding the Defendant having committed an offense or offenses other\n       than the offense alleged against him in the indictment, you cannot consider\n       this evidence for any purpose unless you find and believe beyond a\n       reasonable doubt that the Defendant committed such other offenses, if any\n       were committed, and even then you may only consider the same in\n       determining the answers to the special issues.\n\nWe presume that the jury followed this instruction. See Coble, 330 S.W.3d at 292.\n\nSolomon’s testimony concerning the attempted automobile theft did not prove beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt that the offense was committed and that appellant committed it; rather,\n\nSolomon expressly stated that appellant was cleared of any involvement. Therefore, we\n\f                                                                                 MUHAMMAD –77\npresume that the jury disregarded this evidence. We conclude that any error did not\n\ninfluence the jury or had but a slight effect. See id. at 280. Point of error thirty-three is\n\noverruled.\n\n       In point of error thirty-four, appellant asserts that the trial court erroneously\n\noverruled appellant’s objection that Warden Melody Nelson’s10 testimony about the types\n\nof weapons found in prison was not particularized to appellant. He avers that Nelson’s\n\ntestimony and the display of weapons before the jury were not relevant because the\n\ndefense had not called anyone to testify about prison conditions and so the State had no\n\nreason to offer general testimony about acts committed by other inmates. He also\n\ncomplains that Nelson’s testimony and the weapons display “could only be based on\n\nhearsay.” He argues that admitting this evidence denied him a fair trial in violation of his\n\nright to due process.\n\n       At trial, defense counsel objected that Nelson’s testimony describing the types of\n\nobjects that could be made into weapons was not relevant because there had been no\n\nshowing of any nexus between that testimony and appellant. The prosecutor responded\n\nthat the jury should be allowed to understand what the prison system was like; he clarified\n\nthat he was not saying that appellant made the weapons. The trial court overruled the\n\nobjection. Nelson continued to testify, describing additional items that could be made\n\ninto weapons. Nelson showed the jury some weapons that had been found in prisons.\n\n\n       10\n           The State’s appellate brief lists Warden Nelson’s first name as “Melodye,” but the\nreporter’s record lists it as “Melody.” We adopt the court reporter’s spelling.\n\f                                                                               MUHAMMAD –78\nDefense counsel did not specifically object to this display.\n\n       Appellant did not preserve his hearsay complaint because he did not object to\n\nNelson’s testimony on this basis at trial. T EX. R. A PP. P. 33.1. Further, to the extent that\n\nhe attempts to add a specific complaint about the weapons display, he did not preserve\n\nthis complaint with a trial objection. Cf. Roberts v. State, 220 S.W.3d 521, 532 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 2007) (general objection to testimony, advanced before testimony was heard,\n\ndid not place the trial court on notice that appellant would find particular testimony\n\nobjectionable); Ladd v. State, 3 S.W.3d 547, 572 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999) (trial court was\n\nnot required, in the face of a global objection, to sift through an exhibit and segregate the\n\nadmissible portions from the inadmissible portions). Therefore, we consider only\n\nappellant’s complaint that Nelson’s testimony about weapons in prisons was not relevant\n\nbecause it was not connected to appellant.\n\n       Nelson’s testimony described the conditions that appellant would face if he were\n\nsentenced to life in prison, including the potential for violence. Her testimony, including\n\nher description of weapons that inmates had made, was relevant because it informed the\n\njury’s assessment of the probability that appellant would commit acts of violence in\n\nprison society. See Coble, 330 S.W.3d at 269. The trial court did not abuse its discretion\n\nby admitting Nelson’s testimony. Point of error thirty-four is overruled.\n\n       In point of error thirty-five, appellant complains that the trial court erroneously\n\ndenied his motion for a hearing to make a threshold inquiry into whether the State could\n\npresent sufficient evidence of extraneous offenses and bad acts before allowing the State\n\f                                                                                   MUHAMMAD –79\nto present such evidence to the jury. Specifically, appellant complains that, if the trial\n\ncourt had determined the threshold admissibility of extraneous-offense evidence before\n\nallowing the State to present it to the jury, the trial errors raised in points of error forty-\n\ntwo, forty-three, and forty-four would have been prevented.11\n\n       Appellant further argues that the court’s refusal to make a preliminary\n\nadmissibility determination resulted in prejudice because the State presented testimony\n\nfrom police officers who made unsubstantiated allegations of appellant’s bad conduct.\n\nHe asserts that the trial court’s refusal to exclude the State’s “anecdotal” and “minimal”\n\nevidence of extraneous bad acts resulted in “a series of repetitive errors on the State’s . . .\n\nattempted use of improper extraneous evidence.”\n\n       The record reflects that, during a pre-trial discussion of appellant’s “Motion for a\n\nPre-Trial Hearing as to the Admissibility of Each Extraneous Offense o[r] Bad Act,”\n\nappellant expressly asked the trial court to carry his motion for a pre-trial hearing until a\n\nlater time. Defense counsel stated, “If the State is intending to offer anything other than\n\nlive witnesses, we have some confrontation issues and some Crawford 12 issues that would\n\ncertainly apply to the State’s intent to offer [proof of extraneous acts] by way of a\n\nbusiness record.” However, in light of the prosecutor’s stated intent to present\n\n\n\n\n       11\n          Points of error forty-two, forty-three, and forty-four concern the sufficiency of the\nfuture-dangerousness evidence and the constitutionality of Article 37.071. We suspect that\nappellant did not intend to refer to these points of error, but we decline to speculate.\n       12\n            Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36 (2004).\n\f                                                                              MUHAMMAD –80\nextraneous-act evidence through live testimony, counsel asked the trial court to “hold the\n\nmotion at this time for further consideration, if it comes up.”\n\n       The trial judge advised defense counsel to let him know if the defense had an\n\nobjection during the proffer of evidence, stating that the court would rule on it at that\n\ntime. Thus, to the extent that appellant complains about the trial court’s pre-trial handling\n\nof his motion, he did not preserve error, and he is estopped from seeking appellate relief.\n\nSee T EX. R. A PP. P. 33.1; see also Woodall v. State, 336 S.W.3d 634, 644 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 2011) (“The law of invited error provides that a party cannot take advantage of an\n\nerror that it invited or caused.”).\n\n       After the guilt-or-innocence phase and before the punishment phase, defense\n\ncounsel again discussed the motion. Counsel requested that, prior to the introduction of\n\nany testimony concerning extraneous bad acts, the trial court make a threshold\n\ndetermination that there was competent proof that appellant committed the bad act.\n\nCounsel also requested that the trial court provide an oral jury instruction after the\n\npresentation of evidence of each extraneous offense, to the effect that the jury could not\n\nconsider such evidence unless it found beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant had\n\ncommitted the extraneous offense. Further, defense counsel requested that the trial court\n\ninclude a similar written jury instruction in the jury charge. The trial court denied the\n\nmotion.\n\n       When the relevance of evidence depends on whether a fact exists, proof must be\n\nintroduced sufficient to support a finding that the fact does exist. Rule 104(b). The trial\n\f                                                                                MUHAMMAD –81\ncourt may admit the proposed evidence on the condition that the proof be introduced later.\n\nId.; see also Moore v. State, 700 S.W.2d 193, 205 (Tex. Crim. App. 1985) (noting that the\n\ntrial court has the discretion either to determine the merits of motions concerning the\n\nadmissibility of evidence during the trial itself or to set a hearing to determine such\n\nmotions).\n\n       In capital cases in which the State seeks the death penalty, Article 37.071, section\n\n2(a), governs the admissibility of extraneous-act evidence offered at punishment. Hughes\n\nv. State, 24 S.W.3d 833, 843 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000). The trial judge has wide latitude in\n\nadmitting or excluding such evidence. Kemp v. State, 846 S.W.2d 289, 307 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 1992). “Before extraneous offenses may be introduced during the punishment phase\n\nof a capital murder trial, the State must ‘clearly prove’ to the trial court that an offense\n\nwas committed and that the accused was the perpetrator.” Burks v. State, 876 S.W.2d\n\n877, 909 (Tex. Crim. App. 1994). Nevertheless, “evidence should not be excluded\n\nmerely because its relevance may depend upon the production of additional evidence at a\n\nlater point in the trial or because its probative strength is alone insufficient to prove a\n\nsignificant fact.” Fuller v. State, 829 S.W.2d 191, 197 (Tex. Crim. App. 1992). “[O]nce\n\nevidence is deemed admissible, the jury is the ultimate judge of the credibility of\n\nwitnesses and of the weight to be given their testimony.” Id. We evaluate the trial court’s\n\nruling solely to determine whether it was within the zone of reasonable disagreement.\n\nChamberlain v. State, 998 S.W.2d 230, 235 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999).\n\n       The trial court had the discretion either to hold a separate hearing concerning the\n\f                                                                             MUHAMMAD –82\nadmissibility of the State’s extraneous-offense evidence or to determine the admissibility\n\nof this evidence during the trial. See Moore, 700 S.W.2d at 205. The court acted within\n\nthis discretion when it denied appellant’s motion to hold a separate hearing before the\n\npunishment phase.\n\n       After several State’s witnesses testified about extraneous offenses and bad acts\n\nduring the State’s punishment case-in-chief, the trial court held another hearing outside\n\nthe jury’s presence on appellant’s motion. Defense counsel argued that, by presenting\n\nthese witnesses, the State had offered evidence that was not admissible against appellant.\n\nCounsel complained that the testimony of police officers who did not independently recall\n\nevents, but who reviewed arrest reports and then testified about the contents of those\n\nreports, was inadmissible because such testimony was not evidence that would lead a jury\n\nto find someone guilty of the alleged extraneous offenses beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nCounsel also argued that testimony merely referring to the arrest report for the suspect’s\n\nname and date of birth – which were the same as appellant’s – was insufficient to tie\n\nappellant to those offenses. The trial court disagreed and again denied appellant’s request\n\nfor a threshold hearing on extraneous-offense evidence. The trial court instructed the\n\nState to “tie up” extraneous-offense testimony in which appellant had not been identified\n\nas a suspect, but the court also ruled that, with respect to the extraneous-offense evidence\n\nthat had already been presented to the jury, the State had made a clear showing as\n\nrequired by law.\n\n       The trial court acted within its discretion by declining to hold a threshold hearing.\n\f                                                                               MUHAMMAD –83\nSee Fuller, 829 S.W.2d at 198 (“[A] trial judge cannot err in most cases by overruling a\n\nrelevancy objection so long as the challenged evidence might be ‘connected up’ before\n\nthe end of trial.”). The court’s determination that the State’s evidence clearly proved that\n\nthe offenses were committed and that appellant was the perpetrator was also within the\n\nzone of reasonable disagreement. See id. at 197 (finding no error when trial court\n\noverruled relevancy objection “pending the fact that” the prosecutor would introduce\n\nevidence sufficient to fulfill a condition of fact; “Clearly, the parties must be allowed to\n\ndevelop their cases one step at a time.”).\n\n       Defense counsel re-urged the motion again after additional State’s witnesses\n\ntestified about extraneous offenses. Counsel argued that, by having officers with no\n\nindependent recollection of events testify from arrest reports, the State was effectively\n\nproving up extraneous offenses through business records. Counsel complained\n\nspecifically of the extraneous-offense testimony of one police officer who acknowledged\n\nthat he had no independent recollection of events even after reviewing the arrest report.\n\nDefense counsel asserted that such testimony was not competent evidence. The trial court\n\nexpressed the view that the complained-of witness had been unprepared, but the court\n\ndeclined to instruct the jury that any previously presented extraneous-offense testimony\n\nwas not competent evidence.\n\n       The trial court did, however, grant appellant part of the relief he requested in his\n\nmotion. Before the State presented any additional extraneous-bad-act evidence, the court\n\ninstructed the jurors orally that, if they did not believe that the evidence of an offense\n\f                                                                               MUHAMMAD –84\nproved beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense had been committed and that appellant\n\ncommitted it, then they should not consider the evidence for any purpose. As noted in\n\npoint of error thirty-three, the court also provided a similar instruction in the written jury\n\ncharge.\n\n       Other than his broad assertions that the State’s witnesses’ testimony concerning\n\nappellant’s bad acts was “anecdotal, minimal,” and unsubstantiated, appellant does not\n\nexplain how or why this testimony was inadmissible. We decline to make his argument\n\nfor him. See T EX. R. A PP. P. 38.1; Ladd, 3 S.W.3d at 574. Further, by giving the\n\nrequested jury instructions, the trial court provided a safeguard against the possibility that\n\nthe jurors would consider extraneous-offense evidence even if they did not believe that\n\nthe evidence clearly proved the offense and appellant’s commission of it. Appellant has\n\nnot overcome the presumption that the jury followed the trial court’s oral and written\n\ninstructions. See Gamboa v. State, 296 S.W.3d 574, 580 (Tex. Crim. App. 2009). Point\n\nof error thirty-five is overruled.\n\n       In point of error thirty-six, appellant complains that the trial court erroneously\n\noverruled his motion for a mistrial after the prosecutor presented a witness to testify about\n\nan extraneous bad act but then withdrew the witness’s testimony after appellant objected\n\nto the lack of notice.\n\n       The record reflects that the prosecutor called Officer Ryan Swain to testify that on\n\nJuly 18, 2010, while responding to a call about a suspicious person, he encountered\n\nappellant. Defense counsel objected that the offense about which Swain would testify\n\f                                                                              MUHAMMAD –85\nhad been omitted from the State’s Rule 404(b) notice. After reviewing the notice, the\n\nprosecutor confirmed that the State had not given notice of the offense at issue and agreed\n\nthat the State would not present any more testimony from Swain. Defense counsel\n\ncomplained that Swain’s incomplete testimony would cause the jury to speculate about\n\nappellant’s bad conduct that led to the suspicious-person call. Counsel asked the trial\n\ncourt to instruct the jury that it should not consider any of Swain’s statements for any\n\npurpose. Counsel also asked for a mistrial. The trial court instructed the jury to disregard\n\nSwain’s testimony, but overruled the request for a mistrial.\n\n       The trial court’s instruction to disregard Swain’s testimony was sufficient to cure\n\nany harm. See Coble, 330 S.W.3d at 292. Further, the written jury charge instructed the\n\njury to disregard any extraneous-offense evidence that did not prove the offense beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt, and we presume that the jury followed this instruction. See Gamboa,\n\n296 S.W.3d at 580. Given the evidence of appellant’s other extraneous offenses, the trial\n\ncourt’s instruction to disregard, and the inconsequential nature of Swain’s testimony, the\n\ntrial court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant’s motion for a mistrial. Point\n\nof error thirty-six is overruled.\n\n       In point of error thirty-seven, appellant asserts, “The trial court erred in overruling\n\nappellant’s objection that the State was allowed to present evidence that an arrest of\n\nappellant was based on a warrant for an alleged burglary of a motor vehicle that he was\n\nnot involved. [sic]” We surmise that this point of error is a restatement of point of error\n\nthirty-three. Appellant excerpts part of the record of Solomon’s testimony during which\n\f                                                                               MUHAMMAD –86\ndefense counsel objected that the State failed to give the defense proper notice under Rule\n\n404(b). Appellant then cites two non-capital cases in support of his assertion that the jury\n\ncould not find beyond a reasonable doubt that he committed the extraneous offense.\n\nFinally, appellant submits that the trial court erred in admitting this evidence and that the\n\nerror had a substantial or injurious effect on the punishment verdict. Because appellant\n\ndoes not apply the law to the facts of the case, we reject this point of error as inadequately\n\nbriefed. See T EX. R. A PP. P. 38.1; see also Linney v. State, 413 S.W.3d 766, 767-68 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 2013). Point of error thirty-seven is overruled.\n\n       In points of error thirty-eight and thirty-nine, appellant complains that the trial\n\ncourt’s erroneous rulings allowed the State to cross-examine two testifying mental-heath\n\nexperts on matters outside their expertise. In point of error thirty-eight, appellant asserts\n\nthat the trial court erroneously overruled his objection to the State’s cross-examining Dr.\n\nKelly Gray-Smith about her opinion that appellant had antisocial personality disorder\n\n(“ASPD”). In point of error thirty-nine, appellant asserts that the trial court erroneously\n\noverruled his objection to the State’s cross-examining Dr. Gilbert Martinez about the\n\nsymptoms of ASPD.\n\n       Appellant briefs points of error thirty-eight and thirty-nine together. He argues\n\nthat the trial court’s rulings permitted the State to require defense witnesses on cross-\n\nexamination to testify “beyond the scope” of their “expertise or engagement for the case\n\nat bar.” He complains that the State was allowed to convert the witnesses into State’s\n\nwitnesses by eliciting opinions or information that appellant “had all the criteria for a\n\f                                                                            MUHAMMAD –87\ndiagnosis of Anti Personality Disorder [sic] in order to convince the jury that he was a\n\nfuture danger.”\n\n       The record reflects that Martinez testified before Gray-Smith. Martinez informed\n\nthe jury that he was a clinical neuropsychologist who evaluated the mental functioning of\n\npeople suspected of having neurological disorders. Typically, he evaluated and treated\n\npeople with head injuries or strokes. In this case, he “conduct[ed] a neuropsychological\n\nexamination of [appellant’s] intelligence and what’s called his cognitive functioning; in\n\nother words, his mental functioning, his memory, attention, reasoning and judgment and\n\nso forth.” In addition to reviewing appellant’s academic, juvenile, and medical records,\n\nMartinez met with appellant for five hours to conduct an interview and administer a\n\nbattery of psychological tests.\n\n       Based on the results of this examination, Martinez diagnosed appellant with a\n\n“mild neurocognitive disorder,” which could interfere with a person’s thinking,\n\nreasoning, impulse control, and inhibition. Martinez testified that a person with this\n\ndisorder might have deficits in behavioral and emotional control, as well as problems\n\nunderstanding social situations. Martinez also diagnosed appellant with borderline\n\nintellectual functioning. He noted that appellant’s history revealed “Epilepsy, Possible\n\nConcussion/Mild Head Injury reported in 2009, and Head Injury, auto crash in 1983.”\n\nMartinez observed that the medication used to treat epilepsy could contribute to cognitive\n\ndeficits. Prolonged drug abuse could also contribute to intellectual and executive-\n\nfunctioning deficits.\n\f                                                                               MUHAMMAD –88\n       During cross-examination, Martinez acknowledged that he was not certain that\n\nappellant had a brain injury, but he noted that appellant’s test scores were “highly\n\nconsistent” with a childhood brain injury. Martinez also acknowledged that\n\n“[i]mpulsivity is one of the diagnostic criteria for antisocial personality disorder,” as is “a\n\nfailure to conform to society’s norms and general rules and regulations of society.”\n\nMartinez further acknowledged that a history of lying or conning people for personal gain\n\nor pleasure, and difficulty planning ahead, could also be symptoms of ASPD.\n\n       Defense counsel then objected that “[a]ll of these questions here are clearly outside\n\nof the referral question,” and that Martinez had “not been asked to do any kind of\n\npsychological assessment in regards to any ASPD factors.” Counsel asserted that\n\nMartinez was asked to evaluate and testify specifically concerning appellant’s cognitive\n\ndeficits. The prosecutor responded that Martinez “made an Axis II diagnosis and that\n\nincluded antisocial personality disorder.” The trial court overruled the objection.\n\n       The prosecutor went on to note that, as part of Martinez’s evaluation of appellant,\n\nMartinez had reviewed a 1994 psychological report that included a diagnosis of conduct\n\ndisorder. The prosecutor asked Martinez if that was “the same as a sociopath.” Martinez\n\ndeclined to answer, saying that he was not an expert in ASPD and he did not want to give\n\nan opinion outside his area of expertise. The prosecutor continued to press Martinez for\n\nan opinion as to whether appellant had ASPD, but Martinez repeatedly declined to\n\nprovide one. Martinez explained that, in order to diagnose someone with ASPD, he\n\nwould have conducted a different type of assessment that included administering\n\f                                                                             MUHAMMAD –89\npersonality tests and psychological tests “that look at that.” In this case, Martinez had\n\n“only administered cognitive and intelligence tests.”\n\n       On redirect, defense counsel elicited Martinez’s testimony emphasizing that his\n\narea of expertise did not include personality disorders and that his diagnosis was limited\n\nto appellant’s intellectual and cognitive functioning. Martinez observed that some of the\n\ntraits that the prosecutor associated with personality disorders were also associated with\n\ncognitive deficits.\n\n       Appellant failed to preserve his complaint concerning the testimony in which\n\nMartinez generally acknowledged some of the diagnostic criteria for ASPD because\n\ndefense counsel did not object until after the prosecutor elicited this testimony. See T EX.\n\nR. A PP. P. 33.1. After defense counsel objected, Martinez repeatedly declined to give an\n\nopinion as to whether appellant had ASPD. Therefore, with respect to the part of\n\nappellant’s complaint that was preserved by objection, Martinez did not testify outside his\n\narea of expertise. Point of error thirty-nine is overruled.\n\n       Later, Gray-Smith, a psychologist with a specialty in school psychology, testified\n\nabout chronic academic failure and emotional disturbance in children. She observed that\n\nthe “externalizing behaviors” that often arise from emotional or academic disabilities can\n\nbe mislabeled as choice-based “bad behavior,” with the result that a child who has such\n\ndisabilities and exhibits such behavior does not receive appropriate support and\n\nintervention. Without such support, the child does not learn coping skills and is unable to\n\nregulate his emotions and respond to stressful situations “in a controlled way.” Such a\n\f                                                                           MUHAMMAD –90\nchild is likely to exhibit chronic academic and behavioral problems.\n\n       Gray-Smith had reviewed a number of appellant’s records in forming her opinion\n\nand preparing her report. These included appellant’s school records, which she said\n\nreflected very early academic failure and no effective intervention. Although appellant’s\n\nschool records from fourth and fifth grades included a mention of special education,\n\nGray-Smith opined that, based on appellant’s early poor performance, the school should\n\nhave provided him with help in the first or second grade. She noted that appellant’s\n\nschool records showed that his behavioral and academic problems worsened after sixth\n\ngrade, but he received no intervention.\n\n       Gray-Smith explained that if a child had behavioral problems but received no\n\nintervention before he was nine years old, his prognosis would be very poor with respect\n\nto preventing adolescent behavioral problems. Beyond the age of nine, a child’s\n\nbehavioral problems would be classified as a conduct disorder and generally result in\n\nsuspension or expulsion. Such disciplinary actions would disconnect the child from his\n\nschool and important sources of help and support. In addition, a child whose school\n\nrecords indicated that he had oppositional defiant disorder and whose juvenile records\n\nincluded a diagnosis of conduct disorder, but who received no intervention, would\n\ntypically be diagnosed with ASPD as an adult. Gray-Smith testified that such a person\n\nwould likely end up unemployed or in jail.\n\n       On cross-examination, Gray-Smith acknowledged that most children with chronic\n\nschool failures do not go on to commit violent offenses such as capital murder. The\n\f                                                                            MUHAMMAD –91\nprosecutor noted that Gray-Smith concluded “throughout [her] report” that appellant had\n\nASPD, and Gray-Smith agreed with that characterization. She declined to say that she\n\nhad diagnosed appellant with ASPD, but she acknowledged that she had formed an\n\nopinion. She stated that she was familiar with behavioral disorders. Based on appellant’s\n\nprior conduct-disorder diagnosis and his other criminal offenses, Gray-Smith believed\n\nthat appellant had ASPD.\n\n       On redirect, Gray-Smith elaborated on the difference between a diagnosis and an\n\nopinion. She stated that the psychologists’ licensing act and ethical guidelines mandated\n\nthat a psychologist should not go beyond his or her area of expertise in making a\n\ndiagnosis, even if he or she might form an opinion. She also stated that a great majority\n\nof inmates in the penitentiary have the traits of ASPD, so an opinion that a person has\n\nASPD is not a meaningful predictor of his future dangerousness in prison.\n\n       On recross, the State asked Gray-Smith about the symptoms of ASPD listed in the\n\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - Fourth Edition (“DSM-IV”).\n\nGray-Smith acknowledged that people with ASPD typically “have a reckless disregard for\n\nthe safety of others.” After the prosecutor asked Gray-Smith whether a failure to conform\n\nto norms was also characteristic of a person with ASPD, defense counsel objected that the\n\nprosecutor was improperly attempting to associate all of the specific symptoms of ASPD\n\nto appellant, when Gray-Smith had not interviewed or examined appellant and could not\n\nattribute specific traits to him. The prosecutor responded that Gray-Smith could discuss\n\nthe symptoms of ASPD because she had given an opinion that appellant had ASPD. The\n\f                                                                             MUHAMMAD –92\ntrial court overruled the objection.\n\n       The prosecutor then asked generally whether a person with ASPD would: have\n\ndifficulty conforming to social norms and rules; lie in order to get what he wanted; be\n\nimpulsive; and fail to plan ahead. Gray-Smith stated that a person with ASPD would\n\nhave some of those symptoms but not necessarily all of them. The prosecutor continued\n\nlisting the criteria for ASPD, and Gray-Smith continued acknowledging that they were\n\ntraits typical of ASPD: aggression and repeated fights or acts of violence; inability or\n\nunwillingness to meet continuing obligations and responsibilities; inability or\n\nunwillingness to show remorse; rationalizing harm caused to others; violating others’\n\nrights; and a diagnosis of conduct disorder before the age of fifteen.\n\n       Appellant did not object to Gray-Smith’s ASPD testimony until after she had\n\nopined that appellant had ASPD and acknowledged that one of the traits identified by the\n\nprosecutor was typical of ASPD. See T EX. R. A PP. P. 33.1; see also Luna v. State, 268\n\nS.W.3d 594, 604 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008). Further, appellant’s trial objection – that Gray-\n\nSmith had not interviewed or examined appellant and therefore could not specifically\n\nattribute particular traits of ASPD to him – does not comport with his complaint on\n\nappeal, which is that Gray-Smith testified outside her area of expertise. See T EX. R. A PP.\n\nP. 33.1; see also Gallo, 239 S.W.3d at 768. Therefore, appellant did not preserve this\n\nportion of his argument.\n\n       To the extent that appellant argues that Gray-Smith’s testimony that appellant met\n\nall the criteria for ASPD went beyond the scope of her pretrial preparations, his argument\n\f                                                                             MUHAMMAD –93\nfails to state a claim for relief. Appellant mischaracterizes Gray-Smith’s testimony\n\nbecause Gray-Smith did not expressly attribute particular ASPD traits to appellant.\n\nInstead, she testified generally about the traits of a person with ASPD. See, e.g., Tillman\n\nv. State, 354 S.W.3d 425, 439-40 (Tex. Crim. App. 2011) (applying the reasoning of\n\nCohn v. State, 849 S.W.2d 817 (Tex. Crim. App. 1993), to find that an expert witness’s\n\ngeneral testimony was sufficiently tied to the facts of the case by other witnesses’\n\ntestimony). Gray-Smith properly could testify beyond the scope of her pretrial\n\npreparations. See id. (observing that Rule of Evidence 703 permits an expert to base her\n\nopinion testimony on the data and facts made known to her during trial). Point of error\n\nthirty-eight is overruled.\n\n       In point of error forty, appellant asserts that the trial judge improperly commented\n\non the weight of the evidence when he admonished the jury concerning overnight\n\nsequestration. Appellant states that the court’s comment that jurors should bring\n\novernight bags with them the following morning, although they probably would not need\n\nthem, may have led the jury to infer the judge’s opinion of the merits of the case.\n\nAppellant also asserts that the comment “indirectly coerced [jurors] through the threat of\n\nsequestration away from their homes and family to reach a verdict before the end of the\n\nday,” and denied him due process and a fair trial by a fair jury. He argues that, because\n\nthe jury returned a sentence of death, the alleged error was not harmless beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.\n\n       The record reflects that, at the end of the presentation of evidence on May 22,\n\f                                                                               MUHAMMAD –94\n2013, the trial court released the jury for the day. The judge explained that it was almost\n\n3:00 p.m. and that he would keep the jury together once they started deliberations. Rather\n\nthan providing the jury charge and beginning closing arguments that afternoon, the court\n\nwould be in recess until the jury returned at 9:00 the next morning. Defense counsel then\n\nreminded the judge about the “future instructions,” which prompted the judge to inform\n\njurors that the bailiff would give them some instructions before they left for the day:\n\n       I’ve asked [the bailiff] to have you, in the morning, bring with you a change\n       of clothes just in case. I don’t think you are going to need it, but just in case\n       you do not finish your deliberations tomorrow, then I will have to sequester\n       you as long as you are in deliberations, or before you return to court with a\n       verdict on punishment, then I will have to keep y’all together. And so – just\n       bring a change of clothes with you.\n\n       Defense counsel requested a mistrial, stating that the court had commented on the\n\nweight of the evidence by indicating to the jury “that there is nothing in this case worthy\n\nof a deliberate process on it.” Counsel added, “we are prejudiced beyond belief that the\n\nCourt would make that comment in front of the jury.” The trial judge disagreed with\n\ncounsel’s view that his statement was a comment on the weight of the evidence; rather,\n\nthe judge stated that he had explained to the jurors that he was planning to resume the\n\ncase in the morning so that they would have a full day to deliberate, but if they did not\n\nreach a verdict, then they would be prepared for sequestration. The court denied the\n\nmotion for mistrial.\n\n       We need not address the merits of appellant’s current argument that the jury was\n\nindirectly coerced through the threat of sequestration because this argument does not\n\f                                                                             MUHAMMAD –95\ncomport with the basis for appellant’s motion for mistrial. See T EX. R. A PP. P. 33.1; see\n\nalso Gallo, 239 S.W.3d at 768. With respect to appellant’s argument that the judge’s\n\nstatement was a comment on the weight of the evidence that warranted a mistrial, we note\n\nthat a trial judge is prohibited from conveying to the jury his personal opinion as to the\n\ntruth or falsity of any evidence. See Russell v. State, 749 S.W.2d 77, 78 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n1988). In this case, however, the trial judge’s comment did not convey such an opinion.\n\nThe comment conveyed an opinion that the jury probably would not need more than a day\n\nin which to deliberate and resolve the punishment special issues, but the comment did not\n\nfavor either party or single out any particular evidence for the jury’s consideration.\n\nFurther, the comment did not direct the jurors to resolve the special issues quickly.\n\nRather, the comment advised jurors to bring a change of clothes, and, thus, clearly\n\ncontemplated that they might deliberate for longer than one day.\n\n       Assuming for the sake of argument that the trial judge’s statement was an\n\nimproper comment on the weight of the evidence, appellant has not shown reversible\n\nerror. We afford great deference to the trial judge’s decision as to whether a comment on\n\nthe weight of the evidence warrants a mistrial. See Pierson v. State, 426 S.W.3d 763, 773\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 2014) (quoting Harrison v. State, 788 S.W.2d 18, 22 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n1990)) (“[I]n the context of a declaration of mistrial involving an assessment of the\n\nprejudicial impact upon the jury of some impropriety, the trial judge’s decision is entitled\n\nto great deference.”); see also Coble, 330 S.W.3d at 292 (holding that a trial judge’s\n\ndenial of a motion for mistrial is reviewed under an abuse-of-discretion standard, and the\n\f                                                                               MUHAMMAD –96\nruling must be upheld if it was within the zone of reasonable disagreement).\n\n       Though requesting lesser remedies is not a prerequisite to a motion for mistrial,\n\nwhen the movant does not first request a lesser remedy, we will not reverse the court’s\n\njudgment if the problem could have been cured by a less drastic alternative. Ocon v.\n\nState, 284 S.W.3d 880, 884-85 (Tex. Crim. App. 2009). Here, the jury instructions that\n\nthe judge provided the next day cured any harm. See, e.g., id. at 885 (noting that jury\n\ninstructions are among the less drastic alternatives to declaring a mistrial). When the\n\njurors returned to the courtroom the following morning, the trial court instructed them\n\nthat it would be improper for them to arrive at their answers to the special issues by any\n\nmethod other than a full, fair, and free exchange of opinions. They were also instructed\n\nthat they should deliberate for as long as they felt was necessary to arrive at their answers\n\nto the special issues. Jury instructions should be presumed effective, absent evidence that\n\nthe jury did not follow them. Gamboa, 296 S.W.3d at 580. Appellant has identified no\n\nsuch evidence, and we have found none in our independent review of the record. Point of\n\nerror forty is overruled.\n\n       In point of error forty-one, appellant asserts that the trial court erroneously\n\noverruled his objection that the State argued outside of the record during closing\n\nargument. Specifically, in the State’s final closing argument, the prosecutor drew\n\nparallels between Kametra’s life and the life of Maya Angelou. The prosecutor advised\n\nthe jury that Angelou was raped when she was eight years old, had a child when she was\n\nseventeen, and was once “a full-grown madam, running a brothel.” The prosecutor noted\n\f                                                                            MUHAMMAD –97\nthat Angelou arose from these circumstances to become “Poet Laureate.” From this, the\n\nState argued that Kametra could also change her life and “be anything she wants to.” The\n\ntrial court overruled defense counsel’s repeated objections that this argument was outside\n\nthe record and injected facts not in evidence. Finally, when counsel objected that the\n\nprosecutor could not “argue the life history of people,” the court admonished the\n\nprosecutor to “[a]rgue the evidence and the law.”\n\n       Appellant complains that the prosecutor’s introduction of information about\n\nAngelou’s life history was “obviously presented to inflame the minds of the jury with\n\nenough prejudice beyond the facts of the case in issue that the jury would return a death\n\nverdict in answering the special issues.” He asserts that this argument was extreme and\n\nmanifestly improper because it injected new and harmful facts into the proceeding.\n\n       The record shows that before the State’s argument, defense counsel’s closing\n\nargument had attacked Kametra’s credibility and character, stating that Kametra’s\n\ntestimony about appellant’s previous acts of domestic violence had “escalated” since she\n\nfirst described them to defense counsel. Counsel pointed out that Kametra had cheated on\n\nappellant while he was serving a previous jail term. Counsel also described Kametra as a\n\n“sophisticated prostitute” running an “internet prostitution scheme.” He reminded the\n\njury that, after Kametra left appellant, she developed a $3,000-a-month drug habit.\n\nDefense counsel argued that the State wanted to present Kametra as a victim with “no\n\nway to get away from [appellant]” because it fit well with the State’s theory of the case.\n\n       The State avers that the prosecutor’s argument was a response to defense counsel’s\n\f                                                                             MUHAMMAD –98\nargument, as well as a summation and reasonable deduction from the evidence. See\n\nRocha v. State, 16 S.W.3d 1, 21 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000) (recognizing four areas of\n\npermissible jury argument). The State also argues that Angelou’s life history was\n\nadmissible under the “common knowledge” exception to the prohibition against arguing\n\noutside the record. See Nenno v. State, 970 S.W.2d 549, 559 (Tex. Crim. App. 1998).\n\nSpecifically, the State asserts, “Angelou is a public figure whose life history is common\n\nknowledge.”\n\n       Although the State’s argument describing the facts of Kametra’s life was a\n\nsummation and reasonable deduction from the evidence, the argument describing\n\nAngelou’s life history was not. Angelou’s life history was outside the record. “Common\n\nknowledge” does not necessarily encompass the life history of a public figure, and we are\n\nnot persuaded that Angelou’s life history otherwise falls within the “common knowledge”\n\nexception. See, e.g., Ex parte Lane, 303 S.W.3d 702, 711-12 (Tex. Crim. App. 2009)\n\n(holding that an outside-the-record argument that “people” sell methamphetamine to\n\nchildren, who then become addicts, was designed to arouse the passion and prejudices of\n\nthe jury and was an improper attempt to persuade the jury to convict a defendant of\n\npossession with intent to deliver based on an uncharged offense for which he was not on\n\ntrial); Lagrone, 942 S.W.2d at 619 (holding that an argument that “drugs . . . are a part of\n\nprison life” was not a matter of common knowledge); Freeman, 340 S.W.3d at 728\n\n(holding that a comment that a defendant “tried with all he could” to “commit the worst\n\ncriminal act on law enforcement ever in the United States’ history,” was not a matter of\n\f                                                                              MUHAMMAD –99\ncommon knowledge).\n\n       However, even if Angelou’s life history was not a matter of common knowledge,\n\nwe find that any error in overruling appellant’s objection to this argument was harmless.\n\nSee Lagrone, 942 S.W.2d at 619. “Comments upon matters outside the record, while\n\noutside the permissible areas of jury argument, do not appear to raise any unique concerns\n\nthat would require us to assign constitutional status.” Easley v. State, 424 S.W.3d 535,\n\n541 (Tex. Crim. App. 2014). Such non-constitutional error must be disregarded if it did\n\nnot affect the defendant’s substantial rights. T EX. R. A PP. P. 44.2(b); Freeman, 340\n\nS.W.3d at 728; Brown v. State, 270 S.W.3d 564, 572-73 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008). In\n\ndetermining whether the substantial rights of the defendant have been affected, we\n\nbalance the severity of the misconduct (that is, the prejudicial effect), any curative\n\nmeasures, and the certainty of the punishment assessed absent the misconduct. See\n\nMartinez, 17 S.W.3d at 692-93.\n\n       When viewed against the State’s argument as a whole, the State’s argument that\n\nintroduced information about Angelou’s life was not calculated to deprive appellant of a\n\nfair and impartial trial. In addition, this information was not particularly inflammatory or\n\nprejudicial. This part of the State’s argument took up less than two pages of an eighteen-\n\npage final closing argument. Although the trial court did not take curative measures, we\n\nhave a strong assurance that the jury would have assessed the same punishment if the\n\nState had not introduced information about Angelou’s life. In light of the other evidence\n\nwhich supported a finding of future dangerousness – including the instant offense and\n\f                                                                             MUHAMMAD –100\nappellant’s history of physically abusing Kametra and his sister – the introduction of this\n\ninformation had no appreciable effect on the jury’s decision. See, e.g., Lagrone, 942\n\nS.W.2d at 620. Point of error forty-one is overruled.\n\n                               CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES\n\n       Appellant raises points of error forty-three through fifty-four under the heading,\n\n“Constitutional Issues.” These points of error raise various challenges to the\n\nconstitutionality of Article 37.071, as well as challenges to the trial court’s rulings on\n\nappellant’s pretrial motions to find Article 37.071 unconstitutional. Citing Saldano,\n\nappellant acknowledges that this Court has rejected these claims in the past. He invites\n\nthe Court to review its prior decisions and states that he has included these claims in order\n\nto preserve them for further review in the federal courts. As appellant acknowledges, we\n\nhave previously rejected similar claims. See Saldano, 232 S.W.3d at 107-08. Appellant\n\npresents no new arguments to persuade us to revisit our previous dispositions of these\n\nissues. Points of error forty-three through fifty-four are overruled.\n\n       We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\nDelivered: November 4, 2015\nDo Not Publish\n\f",

T EX. C ODE C RIM. P ROC. art. 37.071, § 2(g).1\n\nDirect appeal to this Court is automatic. Appellant raises fifty-four points of error. After\n\nreviewing appellant’s points of error, we find them to be without merit. Consequently,\n\nwe affirm the trial court’s judgment and sentence of death.\n\n                                  STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n       Appellant drowned two of his sons, five-year-old Naim Muhammad and three-\n\nyear-old Elijah Muhammad, because he was angry with their mother, Kametra Sampson,\n\nwho had separated from appellant about eight months before the offense. Because the\n\ncircumstances of the instant offense are intertwined with appellant’s long history of\n\nabusing Kametra, we will begin with this history.\n\n       Appellant and Kametra met and began dating in 2003, when Kametra was fifteen\n\nyears old and appellant was twenty-five. Within a few weeks, appellant began physically\n\nabusing Kametra. The first episode of abuse occurred during an argument in the back\n\nyard of appellant’s father’s house. Kametra told appellant that she was leaving and\n\nturned to walk away. Appellant grabbed her, threw her into his car, punched her\n\nrepeatedly, and told her that she was not leaving. He did not let her go home that day.\n\n       Appellant beat Kametra once or twice a week for the first four or five years of\n\ntheir relationship, and then the beatings became more frequent. Appellant usually abused\n\nKametra by punching her in the face with his fists. In 2006, Kametra told appellant that\n\n\n       1\n         Unless otherwise indicated, all future references to Articles refer to the Texas Code of\nCriminal Procedure.\n\f                                                                              MUHAMMAD –3\nshe was pregnant. Appellant told her to get an abortion, and when she refused, he\n\nattempted to induce a miscarriage by punching and kicking her stomach. When that\n\nfailed, appellant urged Kametra to drink bleach or use a wire hanger, but Kametra did not\n\ndo so. Kametra later gave birth to the couple’s first child, Naim. In 2008, Kametra\n\ninformed appellant that she was pregnant with their second child. She again refused to\n\nget an abortion and appellant again attempted to induce a miscarriage by punching and\n\nkicking her stomach. The attempt failed, and Kametra gave birth to Elijah. Appellant did\n\nnot punch and kick Kametra in the stomach when she informed him that she was pregnant\n\nwith their third child, Jeremiah, but appellant continued to physically abuse her by\n\npunching her in the face.\n\n       Around Christmas of 2010, Kametra left appellant, taking their three sons with her.\n\nAppellant continued to physically abuse Kametra when he had the opportunity. He also\n\nused their sons in his efforts to control her. For example, on February 24, 2011, appellant\n\nshowed up at Kametra’s mother’s house, and Kametra went outside to talk to him. He\n\ntold Kametra that he wanted to take Naim and Elijah, but Kametra told him that he could\n\nnot. She went back inside and tried to close the door, but appellant forced his way into\n\nthe house. He pushed Kametra against the wall and punched her in the face. He then\n\nrushed into the dining room and grabbed Naim. While carrying Naim, he kicked down a\n\nside door and fled. Police found Naim a short time later and returned him to Kametra.\n\n       As a result of this incident, appellant was arrested for assaulting Kametra.\n\nAppellant was already on probation for a 2009 assault on his sister, and the State\n\f                                                                              MUHAMMAD –4\nsubsequently filed a motion to revoke his probation based on this new offense. However,\n\nthe motion to revoke remained pending because appellant stopped reporting to his\n\nprobation officer and avoided contact with other law-enforcement officials.\n\n       Kametra and appellant continued to communicate after the February 2011 incident,\n\nand the boys sometimes visited appellant. Appellant repeatedly asked Kametra to\n\nreconcile with him, but she rejected his requests. On March 24, 2011, all three boys\n\nvisited appellant at his brother’s house. Appellant told Kametra that he could not take\n\nNaim to preschool that day, so Kametra borrowed a car from her sister, Gabrielle, and\n\ndrove to the house to pick up the boys. Kametra stopped the car in front of the house,\n\nloaded the children into the back seat, and sat down in the driver’s seat. Appellant, who\n\nwas standing by the car, asked Kametra to take him to the store. She told him that she\n\ncould not do that because she had to return the car to Gabrielle. Appellant climbed into\n\nthe car anyway. Kametra again told appellant that she could not take him to the store and\n\nasked him to get out of the car. Appellant became upset and choked Kametra into\n\nunconsciousness.\n\n       When Kametra regained consciousness, she and the boys were inside the house.\n\nAppellant hit Kametra in the head with a heavy object when she told him that she needed\n\nto leave. Kametra finally persuaded appellant to let her go, telling him that Gabrielle\n\nwould call the police if she did not return the car soon. Appellant allowed Kametra to\n\nleave with the boys, but he insisted on riding with them.\n\n       Gabrielle was waiting outside when they stopped the car. As Kametra exited the\n\f                                                                              MUHAMMAD –5\ncar, Gabrielle saw her battered condition and called the police. Appellant picked up\n\nElijah and told Kametra, who was holding Jeremiah, that he would kill Elijah if she did\n\nnot walk away with him. Appellant walked away quickly, carrying Elijah. Kametra, still\n\ncarrying Jeremiah, followed appellant slowly because she did not want to go with him.\n\nAppellant attempted to hide when police officers arrived, but when he realized that the\n\nofficers had seen him, he dropped Elijah and ran away.\n\n       By the time of the instant offense, a Child Protective Services (“CPS”) worker had\n\ninstructed Kametra not to let appellant visit the boys unless his mother accompanied him.\n\nKametra complied with this instruction. Nevertheless, at around 6:30 a.m. on Naim’s first\n\nday of kindergarten, appellant borrowed a friend’s car and showed up at Kametra’s house,\n\nunannounced and alone. He stated that he wanted to take Naim to school. Kametra and\n\nher mother told appellant to leave several times before he complied.\n\n       A short time later, while Kametra and Elijah were walking Naim to school,\n\nappellant pulled up in a car in front of them, jumped out, and picked up a rock. He\n\nthreatened to hit Kametra in the head with it if she and the boys did not get into the car\n\nwith him. After they were in the car, appellant drove toward Naim’s school, but he\n\npassed it without stopping and announced that Naim would not go to school that day.\n\nAppellant drove erratically while he threatened and hit Kametra. His demeanor alternated\n\nbetween hostile and affectionate. He told Kametra several times that he would kill her\n\nand the boys.\n\n       When appellant stopped the car at a traffic light, Kametra saw a constable’s car in\n\f                                                                             MUHAMMAD –6\nthe next lane. She jumped out of appellant’s car and ran to the constable for help.\n\nAlthough the light was still red and another car was stopped in front of him, appellant\n\ndrove the car over the curb and sped away with the boys. He told them that their mother\n\ndid not care about them any more. He stopped the car near a creek and walked the boys\n\ndown the embankment. The boys told appellant that they loved him, and Naim asked him\n\nnot to kill them.\n\n        Having second thoughts, appellant walked the boys back up to the car and smoked\n\na cigarette while he considered his next move. He concluded that he could not take the\n\nboys back to the house because the police would be waiting for them. After deciding to\n\ncomplete his plan, appellant walked the boys back down the embankment. Appellant\n\ncarried Elijah after Elijah complained that he could not walk down by himself. Elijah\n\ncried for his mother, and appellant told the boys that she ran away and he did not know\n\nwhere she was. Naim repeated, “I love you, dad,” over and over.\n\n        Appellant told the boys to sit down in the water, turn away from him, and pretend\n\nthey were swimming. They complied, and he held their heads under water. Naim was\n\nkicking, but appellant would not let him get up. Appellant did not let up until both boys\n\nstopped moving. Appellant left their bodies in the creek and drove to Kametra’s house,\n\nwhere he broke a window in the room where Jeremiah was sleeping. Appellant attempted\n\nto climb through the window, but Kametra’s brother entered the room and pushed\n\nappellant back outside. Appellant, as he was leaving, stated, “Your nephews are dead\n\nnow.”\n\f                                                                               MUHAMMAD –7\n       After he committed the offense, appellant evaded capture and resisted arrest.\n\nAppellant told his mother, who was waiting for him at his brother’s house, that he would\n\nnot go home because he knew the police were looking for him and he did not want to go\n\nback to jail. While law-enforcement officers searched for him, appellant abandoned the\n\ncar and fled on foot. He kicked and fought with the arresting officers when they found\n\nhim. Five or six officers struggled to restrain him, and they “Tazed” him three times\n\nbefore they were finally able to handcuff him. Appellant did not stop fighting until he\n\nwas handcuffed.\n\n       After the offense but before his capture, appellant’s mother asked appellant what\n\nhe had done to her grandsons. Appellant told her that he “didn’t do that” and that\n\nKametra “did it” by refusing to let him see them. After he was captured, appellant said in\n\nhis statement to police that he regretted what he had done and that the only reason he\n\nkilled the boys was to prove a point to Kametra. He stated that he would not have done it\n\nif she had stayed with him in the car. Following his statement, appellant asked the\n\ninvestigating officer to tell Kametra that it was her fault that he killed the boys because he\n\nwould not have done it if she had let him see them. He also asked the investigator to tell\n\nhis sisters that he was sorry he “did this stupid-ass shit.”\n\n       While in jail, appellant wrote a letter to Kametra’s mother in which he stated that\n\nhe would never do anything to hurt the boys. He declared that he still loved Kametra. He\n\nalso stated that the boys’ deaths were Kametra’s fault because she got out of the car, and\n\nKametra’s mother’s fault because she did not let appellant into her house.\n\f                                                                                MUHAMMAD –8\n                           SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE\n\n       In point of error forty-two, appellant asserts that the evidence is legally insufficient\n\nto support the jury’s affirmative finding of future dangerousness. Appellant argues that\n\nhe had “no prior violent offense convictions that sent him to the penitentiary” and that\n\ndefense witnesses testified that he was a low risk for future dangerousness. He asserts\n\nthat the evidence showed that his conduct in this case was the result of a “family conflict”\n\nabout his children. Appellant reasons that, because this type of conflict would not exist in\n\nprison, he would not be a future danger if he received a life sentence. Appellant also\n\npoints to evidence of his terrible childhood and his low cognitive functioning to explain\n\nhis criminal behavior.\n\n       When reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury’s future-\n\ndangerousness determination, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the\n\nverdict and determine whether, based on that evidence and reasonable inferences\n\ntherefrom, any rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that there\n\nis a probability that appellant would commit criminal acts of violence constituting a\n\ncontinuing threat to society.

App. 2001). Appellant had contact with the juvenile system before he was a\n\nteenager, and, when he was thirteen years old, he began committing criminal offenses that\n\nresulted in juvenile adjudications. Among other offenses, appellant was adjudicated for\n\nevading arrest and for burglaries of habitations and vehicles. When he was fifteen years\n\nold, appellant was sent to a juvenile home where he received individual and group\n\ncounseling. After numerous rules infractions, however, including assaulting the same\n\njuvenile twice in one day, appellant was discharged from the home and sent to the Texas\n\nYouth Commission facility for Jefferson County (“TYC”) in July 1995.\n\n       At TYC, appellant was often explosive and disrespectful to staff. He was\n\nparticularly hostile to female staff. On one occasion when he was being disciplined for\n\ndisruptive behavior, appellant looked toward a female officer and declared that he wanted\n\nto “beat somebody down,” adding, “especially females.” Appellant also committed rules\n\ninfractions. For example, when he was found in possession of razor blades and crushed\n\naspirin in December 1995, he admitted to staff that he stole the razor blades and crushed\n\nthe aspirin to trade it for snacks. In September 1996, he was disciplined after he\n\nrepeatedly punched a juvenile while another boy held the victim down. After appellant\n\nwas released from TYC, he resumed committing criminal offenses such as burglary and\n\nevading arrest.\n\n       Appellant’s history of violence toward women was not limited to Kametra. In\n\n2001, appellant threatened to beat a female neighbor after she saw him looking in her\n\f                                                                              MUHAMMAD –13\nbathroom window and confronted him in her yard. He left when she called the police.\n\n       In 2009, appellant hit his sister in the head with a hammer. When officers\n\nresponded to the scene, his sister was crying, and fresh blood was running down the back\n\nof her head. Appellant had walked down the street to a convenience store after the\n\nincident. When he was brought back to the scene, he told officers that he had acted in\n\nself-defense. This incident was not the first time appellant had hit his sister. As a result\n\nof this incident, appellant pleaded guilty to a charge of aggravated assault with a deadly\n\nweapon and received five years’ deferred adjudication. He did not comply with many of\n\nthe conditions of his probation, including attending an anger-management course,\n\nperforming community service, and obtaining a job. He also tested positive for drug use\n\non several occasions. Appellant stopped reporting to his probation officer after his arrest\n\nfor assaulting Kametra.\n\n       While in jail awaiting trial on the instant offense, appellant committed violent\n\ndisciplinary offenses. For example, he refused instructions to return a breakfast tray and\n\n“swung at” the officer who entered his cell to retrieve it. On another occasion, appellant\n\nfought with an inmate over the choice of a television show.\n\n       Finally, one of appellant’s expert witnesses opined that appellant had antisocial\n\npersonality disorder (“ASPD”), although she minimized the significance of ASPD with\n\nrespect to predicting future dangerousness in the prison setting. Cf. Lucio, 351 S.W.3d at\n\n904 (observing that the future-dangerousness special issue asks a jury to determine\n\nwhether a capital defendant would constitute a continuing threat to society “whether in or\n\f                                                                                MUHAMMAD –14\nout of prison”). Viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, the evidence –\n\nincluding the circumstances and facts of the offense and appellant’s history of criminal\n\noffenses and bad acts – was such that the jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt that\n\nappellant would be a continuing threat to society.

Appellant\n\nwas entitled to fifteen peremptory challenges to be used against prospective jurors. See\n\nArt. 35.15(a). After he exhausted his fifteen peremptory strikes, he received two\n\nadditional strikes. The trial court denied appellant’s request for a third additional strike to\n\nexercise on prospective juror Ernest Hand, and Hand was seated as the twelfth juror.\n\nAppellant identified Hand as an objectionable juror. Because appellant received two\n\nadditional peremptory strikes, he is not entitled to relief unless he establishes that the trial\n\ncourt erroneously denied at least three of his challenges for cause.

He argues that Nichols\n\nwas disqualified because she would not require the State to prove appellant’s guilt beyond\n\na reasonable doubt.2\n\n       The record does not support appellant’s claim that Nichols would not hold the\n\nState to its burden of proof at the guilt-or-innocence phase. When the prosecutor\n\nbroached the subject of the State’s burden of proof, Nichols sought clarification about the\n\nmeaning of “proof beyond a reasonable doubt.” She explained that she had previously\n\nserved on a jury in a criminal case and that she was unhappy with the result. She felt that\n\nshe had let the other jurors talk her into voting not guilty by persuading her that her\n\ndetermination of guilt was based on improper inferences from the evidence. Nichols\n\nstated that she wanted clarification because she would never “be one-hundred percent\n\nsure” or know the facts of the offense “beyond a shadow of a doubt” unless she witnessed\n\nthem personally. The prosecutor explained the State’s burden of proof and assured\n\nNichols that “beyond a reasonable doubt” did not mean “beyond a shadow of a doubt.”\n\nNichols indicated that she understood. When questioned by defense counsel, Nichols\n\nprovided an accurate understanding of the State’s burden of proof and affirmed that she\n\n\n\n       2\n         With respect to Nichols and many other prospective jurors, appellant asserts on appeal\ngrounds for disqualification that he failed to raise at trial.

The court did not abuse its discretion by denying the\n\nchallenge for cause. Point of error two is overruled.\n\n       In point of error three, appellant asserts that the trial court erroneously denied his\n\nchallenge for cause against Dee Jay Earley. He argues that Earley was disqualified\n\nbecause Earley: (1) was deceptive when he failed to indicate on his questionnaire that he\n\nhad been a victim’s advocate for two and one-half years while in the military; and (2)\n\nwould not consider evidence of voluntary intoxication to be mitigating.\n\n       Appellant’s first argument is predicated on the following facts in the record.\n\nQuestion 58 on the jury questionnaire asked prospective jurors, “Have you ever worked\n\nwith any local, state or national citizen’s law enforcement group, or a group dedicated to\n\nvictim’s rights?” As illustrative examples, the question identified Mothers Against Drunk\n\nDriving (“MADD”), the police auxiliary, or the sheriff auxiliary. A space below the\n\nquestion was provided for the prospective juror to list any such associations. Earley\n\nanswered this question in the negative and did not list any associations. During voir dire,\n\nhowever, Earley disclosed that he had volunteered for a victim’s advocacy program while\n\nhe was in the military. Specifically, the prosecutor asked Earley if he had participated in\n\nthe military judicial process, and Earley responded:\n\n       Ma’am, I spent a small amount of time as a victims’ advocate while I was in\n       the service, but as far as court; no, ma’am.\n\n       Q. Okay. And what did you do as a victim advocate?\n\n       A. My job was to go help the victims, no matter what it be, civilian or\n       otherwise, on the post. For example, a battered spouse, putting her up in a\n\f                                                                           MUHAMMAD –18\n      hotel on the post for the night.\n\n      Q. Okay.\n\n      A. Getting with RMP’s or military police to ensure that there’s anything\n      other – the restraining orders to keep him or her away from the victim –\n\n      Q. Okay.\n\n      A. – or alleged victim at that time.\n\n      Q. Anything about that that you feel that we need to know or –\n\n      A. No, ma’am. Soldiers will be soldiers.\n\n      Q. Yeah.\n\n      A. They get in scraps pretty often.\n\nDefense counsel asked Earley for additional details about his experience as a victim’s\n\nadvocate:\n\n      Q. Was that something – was that a post you were assigned to?\n\n      A. No, sir. That’s a complete volunteer service that some soldiers in the\n      military do.\n\n      Q. Okay. And so that was while you were serving; is that correct?\n\n      A. Yes, sir.\n\n      Q. Kind of what were your – tell me about it, please.\n\n      A. My commander at the time asked me if I’d be interested in doing it. In\n      the military, fights between spouses, fights between other soldiers happen\n      quite frequently.\n\n      Q. Yes, sir.\n\n      A. I mean, it’s a volatile area to be.\n\f                                                                     MUHAMMAD –19\n        My commander had asked me if I’d be interested in doing it. I done\nit. I went to – I forget how many hours worth of classes. And then the –\nbasically the MPs would call us out if there was a – a wife that beat a\nhusband or a husband that beat a wife, child abuse, or just a teenage kid\nfiling a complaint against their mother or father.\n\nQ. Yes, sir.\n\nA. And our jobs basically were to go out and help do what we could.\n\n       Now, obviously, we’re not a legal group of people. We are merely\nvolunteers that have been trained to deal with personal situations and give\nthem somebody to talk to, help them find a room for the night, if need be,\nhelp them find food for the night, if need be.\n\nQ. And how long did you do that, Mr. Earley?\n\nA. Off and on for about two-and-a-half years, sir.\n\nQ. Okay. So a little bit more than half of your service then, correct?\n\nA. Yes, sir.\n\n                                    ***\n\nQ. Anything about that two-and-a-half year service as a victim advocate in\nthe military, any of that kind of maybe even raised your level of support for\nthe death penalty or anything like that?\n\nA. No, sir.\n\n                                    ***\n\nQ. Okay. And anything about that advocacy program, Mr. Earley, that has\nyou maybe more likely to give the State the benefit of the doubt regarding\nany particular aspects of this case?\n\nA. No, sir.\n\nDefense counsel later challenged Earley for cause on the ground that he had been\n\f                                                                             MUHAMMAD –20\ndeceptive when he failed to list his experience as a victim’s advocate on the\n\nquestionnaire. The State pointed out that Earley’s volunteer work was not, as stated in\n\nQuestion Number 58, a “local, state or national citizen’s law enforcement group, or a\n\ngroup dedicated to victim’s rights.” The trial court indicated that the groups listed as\n\nexamples under the question were not necessarily similar to Earley’s volunteer program in\n\nthe military.\n\n       The trial court brought Earley back into the courtroom. The court provided Earley\n\nwith his questionnaire and asked him to review Question Number 58. Earley did so and\n\nthen explained that he did not think that his volunteer work was covered by the question.\n\nHe stated that his work had been “completely voluntary” and had nothing to do with law\n\nenforcement or state organizations. He noted that he never considered the program to be\n\nan organization like MADD. The volunteers in his program did not meet together as a\n\ngroup. When assisting a victim, he could telephone a coordinator for limited help, such\n\nas finding a hotel room for the night or a meal, but this help did not extend to providing\n\nlegal advice or advocacy. Earley stated that he did not have any reason to omit this\n\ninformation from his questionnaire, other than he did not think it was responsive to the\n\nquestion. He specifically denied having any intent to conceal this information. The trial\n\ncourt credited Earley’s explanation and concluded that he was not trying to be deceptive\n\nor misleading when he completed his questionnaire.\n\n       With regard to appellant’s assertion that Earley did not consider evidence of\n\nvoluntary intoxication to be mitigating, we note that Earley had no duty to regard such\n\f                                                                              MUHAMMAD –21\nevidence as mitigating.

App.\n\n2012) (“Whether a juror considers a particular type of evidence to be mitigating is not a\n\nproper area of inquiry.”). Even so, defense counsel elicited Earley’s testimony that,\n\nalthough he did not regard evidence of voluntary intoxication as a “defense,” he\n\nrecognized that such evidence was something a juror would “want to remember” or “take\n\ninto account” during punishment deliberations.\n\n       Regarding Earley’s reasons for not disclosing his volunteer work until individual\n\nvoir dire, the trial court was in the best position to evaluate Earley’s responses and\n\ndemeanor and to make decisions about his credibility. See Davis, 329 S.W.3d at 807.\n\nFurther, Earley’s views concerning evidence of voluntary intoxication did not disqualify\n\nhim. See Hernandez, 390 S.W.3d at 315. The court did not abuse its discretion by\n\ndenying the challenge for cause. Point of error three is overruled.\n\n       In point of error four, appellant asserts that the trial court erroneously overruled his\n\nchallenge for cause against prospective juror Timothy Tinsley. He argues that Tinsley\n\nwas disqualified because he: (1) was “death prone,” in that he would answer the special\n\nissues automatically after finding a defendant guilty of capital murder; (2) could not give\n\nfair consideration to mitigating evidence; and (3) would believe police officers over other\n\ntypes of witnesses.\n\n       The record shows that, during voir dire, Tinsley repeatedly stated that he would\n\nkeep an open mind and consider the evidence before determining his answers to the\n\nspecial issues. He also stated that, after finding a defendant guilty and affirmatively\n\f                                                                             MUHAMMAD –22\nanswering the future-dangerousness question, he could give fair consideration to the\n\nquestion of whether anything in the evidence constituted a sufficient mitigating\n\ncircumstance. Tinsley’s statement that he did not regard evidence of voluntary\n\nintoxication as mitigating did not disqualify him. See Standefer v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1352675\"><a href=\"/opinion/1352675/standefer-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">59</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">177</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n181 (Tex. Crim. App. 2001).\n\n       After defense counsel challenged Tinsley for cause, the trial court questioned\n\nTinsley about his ability to consider the mitigation special issue. Tinsley affirmed that, in\n\nconsidering the mitigation issue, he could review all of the evidence in the case to look\n\nfor any mitigating circumstance that would be sufficient to warrant a life sentence. When\n\nthe trial court asked him if he could keep an open mind and consider all of the evidence in\n\ndetermining the mitigation issue, Tinsley answered affirmatively.\n\n       Appellant also asserts that Tinsley’s tendency to find police officers more credible\n\nthan other witnesses disqualified him. We are not persuaded by this assertion. Tinsley\n\nindicated on his jury questionnaire that he would be inclined to find police officers more\n\ncredible than other witnesses. He acknowledged during voir dire that he would give\n\npolice officers “a little more respect than [he] would the average Joe.” However, Tinsley\n\nadded, “But everybody’s human, you know, so I would just – I would listen to the story\n\nand how it’s presented to determine, yeah.”\n\n       The trial court was in the best position to evaluate Tinsley’s responses concerning\n\nhis ability to consider all of the evidence when deliberating on the special issues. See\n\nDavis, 329 S.W.3d at 807. Further, Tinsley’s views concerning the credibility of police\n\f                                                                                 MUHAMMAD –23\nwitnesses did not disqualify him. See Feldman, 71 S.W.3d at 747 (stating that a\n\ndefendant is entitled to jurors who do not hold extreme or absolute positions regarding\n\nwitness credibility; if a venire person is more or less skeptical of a certain category of\n\nwitness, that does not make him subject to a challenge for cause). The court did not\n\nabuse its discretion by denying the challenge for cause. Point of error four is overruled.\n\n       In point of error five, appellant asserts that the trial court erroneously denied his\n\nchallenge for cause to prospective juror Robin Linn. Appellant asserts that Linn was\n\ndisqualified because: (1) her questionnaire answers showed that she was “death prone,”\n\nin violation of Wainwright v. Witt;3 and (2) she wanted to be on the jury, as indicated by\n\nher demeanor during voir dire and by her readiness to vary her answers during voir dire\n\nfrom the answers she had provided on her jury questionnaire.\n\n       Linn’s questionnaire answers and voir dire testimony demonstrated that she\n\nstrongly favored the death penalty and that she wanted to serve on the jury. However,\n\nLinn also stated during voir dire that she did not believe the death penalty was appropriate\n\nfor all homicides and that the punishment decision should depend upon the particular\n\nfacts and circumstances of each case. She stated that she would consider all of the\n\npunishment evidence. She further stated that, although she would want to know if a\n\ndefendant were remorseful, she would not require him to testify and express remorse.\n\n\n\n       3\n          We infer that appellant means to say that Linn’s views on capital punishment would\n“prevent or substantially impair the performance of [her] duties as a juror in accordance with\n[her] instructions and [her] oath.” Witt, 469 U.S. at 424.\n\f                                                                               MUHAMMAD –24\n       When defense counsel questioned Linn about her questionnaire answers that\n\nreflected her strongly favorable view of the death penalty, Linn repeatedly qualified those\n\nanswers. She stated that her answers on the questionnaire were “generic” and that she\n\nunderstood that she would have to know the facts of a particular case before she could\n\ndecide whether the death penalty would be an appropriate punishment. Linn stated that\n\nthe punishment decision would be based on the evidence and what she heard. Linn\n\naffirmed that she did not know how she would decide the special issues until she knew\n\nthe details: “I can’t tell you that I would go either way because I don’t know what the\n\nfacts of the case are.”\n\n       Defense counsel challenged Linn for cause, arguing that her demeanor\n\ndemonstrated that she was willing to change her answers during voir dire in order to be\n\nseated on the jury. The prosecutor disagreed, noting that Linn had “consistently said\n\n[she] could not go one way or the other without hearing all the evidence.”\n\n       Linn’s responses during voir dire did not establish that her views on capital\n\npunishment would prevent or substantially impair the performance of her duties as a juror\n\nin accordance with her instructions and her oath. See Witt, 469 U.S. at 424. We defer to\n\nthe trial court’s assessment of Linn’s credibility and demeanor. Davis, 329 S.W.3d at\n\n807. Without more, the fact that Linn wanted to be on the jury did not disqualify her.\n\nThe court did not abuse its discretion by overruling appellant’s challenge for cause. Point\n\nof error five is overruled.\n\n       In point of error six, appellant asserts that the trial court erroneously overruled his\n\f                                                                            MUHAMMAD –25\nchallenge for cause against prospective juror Charles Stout. He argues that Stout was\n\ndisqualified because his jury-questionnaire responses showed that he would require the\n\ndefendant to testify and he would shift the burden to the defense to prove the defendant’s\n\ninnocence. Appellant acknowledges that Stout qualified his questionnaire responses\n\nduring voir dire, but he argues that Stout’s voir dire statements were not “genuine.”\n\n       The record does not support appellant’s assertion that Stout would require a\n\ndefendant to testify. When questioned about a defendant’s right to remain silent, Stout\n\nstated that he understood the Fifth Amendment right not to testify and the fact that the\n\ndefense had no burden of proof. Stout stated that he, personally, would want to testify if\n\nhe were accused because he would want to show that the State’s evidence was wrong, but\n\nhe understood that someone else might make a different decision for reasons unrelated to\n\nguilt or innocence.\n\n       When the prosecutor first questioned Stout about the presumption of innocence,\n\nStout indicated that the defendant must have done something to get arrested:\n\n       Q. ([PROSECUTOR]). Absolutely. And that’s because the defendant, as\n       the defendant sits right here, now is presumed innocent. And that is a right\n       that everybody as a citizen has. Do you believe in that right?\n\n       A. I have [a] question about that.\n\n       Q. Okay.\n\n       A. Yes, I know that the final verdict of the law – you know, whether they’re\n       innocent or guilty, you have to present all the evidence. And this is part of\n       this process?\n\n       Q. Yes.\n\f                                                                        MUHAMMAD –26\nA. But if you’re – how can you say it? When you’re – you’re presented\nevidence and you’ve approached this individual that has, you know,\ncommitted this crime. And you want to – let’s see how I should put this?\n\nQ. Let me –\n\nA. I think that it comes down to – yes, I think this is the proper possess [sic]\nfor that. But when you arrest someone – you know, when they arrest\nsomeone, they have done something. You know, they had to have done\nsomething to be arrested.\n\nQ. Let’s talk about that a little bit. So, what the law says is, just because\nyou’re arrested doesn’t mean you’re guilty.\n\nA. Right.\n\nQ. People get arrested all the time and are found not guilty. Okay? So just\nbecause you’re arrested, you cannot use that. You cannot – you have to\npresume him and every defendant innocent, okay? Because everybody\nstarts out with that presumption. Then we have the burden to overcome that\npresumption. Does that make sense?\n\nA. I understand that process, I do. But like, if I’m sitting here, you don’t\nknow me. I’m not doing anything. You can’t, you know, just automatically\nconvict me of capital murder and send me away.\n\nQ. Exactly.\n\nA. You know, for life or for death.\n\nQ. Right.\n\nA. So, I have to have done something. I have to, you know, had to\ncommitted some type of crime [sic]. And so, that’s in order for them to\narrest you.\n\nQ. All right. And let me stop you right there. Because that’s a different\nburden. For a police officer to stop you and arrest you, that’s not beyond a\nreasonable doubt. Okay. They only need probable cause to do that.\n\nA. That’s the word I’m looking for.\n\f                                                                           MUHAMMAD –27\n      Q. Just because you’re arrested doesn’t mean you’re guilty beyond a\n      reasonable doubt.\n\n      A. Okay. That’s what I was looking for. That’s the word I was looking for.\n\n      Q. All right. Do you agree that police officers are human and they can\n      make mistakes just like everybody else?\n\n      A. Absolutely.\n\nAfter the prosecutor explained the law concerning the State’s burden, Stout indicated that\n\nhe could presume that a defendant was innocent:\n\n      Q. So the presumption of innocence says, any person that is arrested is not\n      automatically guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. They’re presumed\n      innocent. And who has the burden to prove that he’s guilty?\n\n      A. The State.\n\n      Q. That’s right. We have that burden. So, if we stand up and we don’t do\n      anything, and we just sit down and say, you know what, we rest our case.\n      What is your verdict?\n\n      A. Not guilty.\n\n      Q. Why?\n\n      A. Because you didn’t prove anything.\n\n      Q. That’s exactly right. So evidence that a person has been arrested,\n      evidence that a case has been indicted, none of those things can be used to\n      find a person guilty. Okay?\n\n      A. Right.\n\n      Q. Just like we talked about. Because police officers can make mistakes\n      just like anyone else. Someone could be arrested, maybe a person’s\n      walking out to their car this afternoon and someone comes up behind them\n      and mugs them, and take their purse. They don’t see who that person is.\n      Let’s say the police see a guy running about a mile down the road and they\n\f                                                                             MUHAMMAD –28\n      arrest that person. Does that mean that person is automatically guilty?\n\n      A. No.\n\n                                           ***\n\n      Q. So I’m just trying to let you know that there’s a different burden. That’s\n      a burden of reasonable suspicion or probable cause to arrest someone. And\n      then a case goes to [the] grand jury. Grand juries hear hundreds of cases a\n      day. Usually they take about, probably at the most, five minutes before they\n      return an indictment or they no bill the case. So that also can’t be used as\n      evidence of guilt. Do you think that’s fair?\n\n      A. Yes. Probable cause is the word I was looking for. Thank you, so much.\n\n      Q. So as we sit here right now, Mr. Muhammad is presumed innocent.\n\n      A. Yes.\n\n      Q. Can you keep an open mind and be fair, follow the law and say, right\n      now, he’s presumed innocent?\n\n      A. Yes.\n\nWhen questioned by the defense, Stout made a comment that was, arguably, inconsistent\n\nwith the presumption of innocence:\n\n      A. Honestly, you have to be fair. Just like the State had said earlier, it’s\n      important for you to do that. And I feel you should be fair.\n\n              All though [sic], yes, he was arrested and it’s presumed that he\n      committed this crime. But we have to be fair in making sure what’s\n      presented is accurate and correct. So it would be my job as a juror to listen\n      to all the evidence equally and fairly.\n\n(Emphasis added). Defense counsel did not question Stout about this apparent\n\nmisstatement. However, counsel did ask Stout about his previous comments to the\n\nprosecutor:\n\f                                                                              MUHAMMAD –29\n       Q. You mentioned that if an individual has been arrested he’s probably done\n       something to get here.\n\n       A. Yes.\n\n       Q. Okay. And I presume you feel that way?\n\n       A. Yes.\n\n       Q. Now, the law requires that you presume him innocent.\n\n       A. Right.\n\n       Q. Okay. At this point in stage [sic]. But some people – we’ve had people\n       come down here in the last two weeks and say, you know, [defense\n       counsel], I can’t presume him innocent. He’s come this far, I just can’t do\n       that.\n\n              And that’s fine. And we send them on their way and everything is\n       good. But we have to know. You know, you mentioned that in a round\n       about way two or three times, and we need to know that. Do you feel that\n       way, sir?\n\n       A. That he’s presumed innocent until the State proves otherwise, yes.\n\n       Q. Okay. So that’s your feelings on presumption of innocence. And just\n       because he’s been charged with something, you won’t consider that?\n\n       A. No.\n\n       Although some of Stout’s comments arguably suggested that he had difficulty with\n\nthe presumption of innocence, Stout also stated that he would not consider the facts that a\n\ndefendant had been arrested and indicted when determining whether the State had proven\n\nits case at the guilt-or-innocence phase. To the extent that Stout’s responses were\n\nvacillating, unclear, or contradictory, we afford particular deference to the trial court’s\n\ndecision. See Smith, 297 S.W.3d at 268. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in\n\f                                                                               MUHAMMAD –30\noverruling appellant’s challenge for cause. Point of error six is overruled.\n\n       In point of error seven, appellant asserts that the trial court erroneously overruled\n\nhis challenge for cause to prospective juror Allen Harrington. Appellant argues that\n\nHarrington was disqualified because he would not properly consider mitigating evidence\n\nregarding a defendant’s background, intoxication, and mental health. Appellant states\n\nthat Harrington’s questionnaire responses, which reflected his strong views in favor of the\n\ndeath penalty, were more truthful than his voir dire answers.\n\n       Harrington’s questionnaire responses indicate that he strongly favored the death\n\npenalty. In response to a question asking whether he would consider background\n\nevidence as mitigating, Harrington wrote, “bull shit, cold hard facts, and DNA.” When\n\nthe prosecutor asked him about this response during voir dire, Harrington explained, “I\n\ndon’t believe that the environment or any of that other stuff matters. If it doesn’t matter\n\nfor me it doesn’t matter for anybody. If I’m held to that everybody is held to that.” He\n\nacknowledged that, as a juror, he would have to listen to all of the evidence, but he added\n\nthat, after finding a defendant guilty and answering the future-dangerousness question\n\naffirmatively, “it will be a very high bar for me to hear mitigating circumstances once I’m\n\nthere that would take me to that place [of voting for a life sentence].”\n\n       Harrington responded similarly when questioned by defense counsel: “What in the\n\nworld could make me change my mind? Tell me what those mitigating circumstances are.\n\nTell me what that is. Like I said, that bar will be really high. It’s going to have to be\n\nreally something that tells me there is some mitigating circumstances.” Harrington also\n\f                                                                              MUHAMMAD –31\nclarified that, although he did not regard a person’s background as a “cause” of that\n\nperson’s actions, he recognized that a person “might not be able to truly overcome things\n\nin [his] background.” He added that he would be able to listen and consider evidence of a\n\ndefendant’s background. Harrington also modified his questionnaire response concerning\n\nwhether voluntary intoxication could be mitigating, stating that he disagreed with the law\n\nbut that he would be able to consider intoxication evidence with respect to the mitigation\n\nspecial issue.\n\n       Harrington was not required to regard any particular type of evidence as\n\nmitigating. See Standefer, 59 S.W.3d at 181. Nor was he required to regard any\n\nparticular quantity of evidence as “sufficiently mitigating.” Therefore, appellant has not\n\nshown that Harrington understood the requirements of the law but could not overcome his\n\nprejudice well enough to follow them. See Davis, 329 S.W.3d at 807. To the extent that\n\nHarrington’s answers were vacillating, unclear, or contradictory, we afford particular\n\ndeference to the trial court’s decision. See Smith, 297 S.W.3d at 268. The trial court did\n\nnot abuse its discretion in overruling appellant’s challenge for cause. Point of error seven\n\nis overruled.\n\n       In point of error nine, appellant asserts that the trial court erroneously overruled his\n\nchallenge for cause to Enrique Martinez. He argues that Martinez was disqualified\n\nbecause he was “an automatic death penalty juror” who would always impose a death\n\nsentence after finding guilt.\n\n       The record shows that Martinez strongly favored the death penalty but that he\n\f                                                                            MUHAMMAD –32\nunderstood the law and would follow it in assessing punishment. When questioned by\n\ndefense counsel about his personal thoughts about the death penalty, Martinez\n\nacknowledged that he would favor a death sentence for any capital murder without regard\n\nto the special issues, and he recognized that this view was contrary to the law. However,\n\nMartinez also clarified that, without regard to his personal feelings, he would follow the\n\nlaw as it had been explained to him:\n\n       Okay. But if I have to follow that I will follow that. I don’t know. If it\n       seems like – I don’t know how to explain it. But my belief is my belief.\n       But I was asked if I could listen to everything and come and follow this,\n       that I’ll be – I’m okay with it.\n\n              Am I explaining myself? I’m not sure.\n\nDefense counsel repeatedly encouraged Martinez to explain how he felt and what he\n\nbelieved, without regard to whether he could follow the law. In response, Martinez\n\nrepeatedly stated that he would follow the law regardless of his personal feelings.\n\n       Martinez indicated on his jury questionnaire that he did not believe that a\n\ndefendant’s background should be considered in determining punishment, “because no\n\nmatter of the background they made their choice.” When defense counsel asked him\n\nabout this response, Martinez reiterated his view that everyone can choose how to live\n\nand what to do. He added that he could take background evidence into consideration, but\n\nwhat would really matter to him would be “why” the defendant committed the offense at\n\n“that moment.”\n\n       Defense counsel asked Martinez how he could reconcile his statement that he\n\f                                                                              MUHAMMAD –33\nwould consider background evidence with his statement that background evidence would\n\nnot matter to him. Martinez explained that he would be able to listen and get to know\n\nmore about the defendant before making a judgment. Counsel then asked Martinez\n\nwhether, now that he knew the law and the wording of the mitigation special issue, he\n\ncould take background evidence into consideration. Martinez answered affirmatively.\n\n       Martinez also indicated on his questionnaire that he would not consider evidence\n\nof voluntary intoxication to be mitigating because “they made their choice.” When\n\ndefense counsel asked Martinez whether he could consider evidence of intoxication,\n\nMartinez stated that he would be able to listen and consider such evidence.\n\n       In response to a question concerning the testimony of mental-health professionals,\n\nMartinez had written on the questionnaire, “They should not [testify].” When defense\n\ncounsel asked him about this response, Martinez expressed his belief that sometimes\n\nmental-health professionals could be manipulated to testify in a defendant’s favor, and\n\nsometimes their testimony provided “just an excuse.” However, Martinez responded\n\naffirmatively when counsel asked him if he could “be open-minded and consider that kind\n\nof evidence.”\n\n       Martinez had no duty to regard any particular evidence as mitigating. See\n\nStandefer, 59 S.W.3d at 181. Further, to the extent that Martinez’s answers were\n\nvacillating, unclear, or contradictory, we afford particular deference to the decision of the\n\ntrial judge. See Smith, 297 S.W.3d at 268. We also defer to the trial court’s assessment\n\nof Martinez’s demeanor. See Davis, 329 S.W.3d at 807. The trial court did not abuse its\n\f                                                                              MUHAMMAD –34\ndiscretion in overruling appellant’s challenge for cause. Point of error nine is overruled.\n\n       In point of error ten, appellant complains that the trial court erroneously denied his\n\nchallenge for cause to prospective juror Paul Zugelder. He also complains that the trial\n\ncourt improperly curtailed defense counsel’s voir dire of Zugelder when it sustained the\n\nState’s objections to defense counsel asking Zugelder about the concept of mercy. He\n\nasserts that the court’s rulings sustaining the State’s objections gave Zugelder the\n\nimpression that defense counsel was being untruthful, so that Zugelder felt compelled to\n\nask the trial court to explain the law. Appellant concludes that the trial court’s rulings\n\nthereby “deprive[d] the defendant of seating what otherwise would have been a juror that\n\nwould have been a proper juror for the State.”\n\n       The factual basis of appellant’s point of error arose while defense counsel was\n\nexamining Zugelder concerning the mitigation special issue. Counsel had been focusing\n\non the statutory language of the mitigation issue, which was also available to Zugelder in\n\nwritten form. The record suggests that Zugelder had been reviewing that language as\n\ncounsel discussed it. Counsel then stated that various types of evidence had the potential\n\nto be mitigating and that each juror could decide whether he or she considered particular\n\nevidence to be sufficiently mitigating. Counsel then added, “But the law specifically tells\n\nus, specifically tells us, that a juror’s concept of mercy, a juror’s concept of mercy alone\n\nbased on anything they have heard in that case is sufficient, if they believe it to be\n\nsufficient. Now, do you hear what I’m saying there?” Zugelder responded that he did not\n\nsee anything in the language of the special issue to the effect that a juror’s concept of\n\f                                                                            MUHAMMAD –35\nmercy would be considered, and he asked defense counsel if it was “in there.” Counsel\n\nresponded, “No, if you read the words. But now the Supreme Court of the United States\n\nhas told us that that’s all it takes.”\n\n       The prosecutor then objected that defense counsel had misstated the law because\n\nthe sufficiency decision could not be based on “anything” the jury heard in the case but\n\nhad to be based on something from the evidence. The trial court sustained the objection.\n\nDefense counsel continued: “Your concept of mercy based on any piece of evidence that\n\nyou heard in the case. That’s the law. It doesn’t have to be written there. The courts\n\nhave told us that.” The prosecutor again objected, stating that the law was that jurors\n\ncould make a decision based on mercy but not that they were required to. Defense\n\ncounsel responded, “I’m not saying that they do, Judge,” and the court sustained the\n\nobjection.\n\n       Defense counsel again resumed his explanation of the concept of mercy:\n\n       The law in our land says that your concept, a juror’s concept of mercy based\n       on evidence that they heard in the case, if you believe it rises to the level\n       [of] sufficiency you can act upon that. And that is the law of our land.\n       Now, if we’re going to sustain an objection to that, Judge, then –\n\nThe prosecutor then objected to the sidebar and again stated that any idea of mercy had to\n\nbe “based on the evidence.” Defense counsel responded, “Based on the evidence. I said\n\nit.” The prosecutor asserted that counsel kept omitting that language. Defense counsel\n\ndisagreed. Counsel reiterated his explanation of the concept of mercy as it applied to the\n\nmitigation issue:\n\f                                                                               MUHAMMAD –36\n       Concept of mercy. That’s all it takes. And the only reason they stand up is\n       because in its simplicity it tells us, sir, that your concept of mercy alone\n       based on any piece of evidence you’ve heard in that case, if you believe it’s\n       sufficient, it’s sufficient under the law.\n\n              Now, I’ll ride that horse to the finish line, sir, because that’s the law\n       of our land. It doesn’t have to be written there because we know the\n       Supreme Court of the United States has told us that’s the law.\n\n       At that point, Zugelder turned to the trial judge for clarification, stating that he\n\nunderstood defense counsel to be saying that a juror could “feel pity for the defendant and\n\nmake a decision to kind of dismiss Special Issue Number 2 just if we don’t feel like he\n\nshould be punished to the full extent of the law.” The judge stated that he did not believe\n\nthat defense counsel had said that. He then asked the parties if he could clarify the\n\nmatter. Defense counsel responded, “Well, Judge, you can say anything you want to,\n\nJudge. I mean, the law is the law.”\n\n       The trial judge then provided a detailed explanation:\n\n       Well, I’ll just tell you on Special Issue Number 2 what our legislature has\n       envisioned, what the Supreme Court has upheld, is that the jury after having\n       found Special Issue Number 1 answering, yes, that in other words, that the\n       jury does consider the defendant that’s on trial to be a continuing threat to\n       the society or wherever he finds himself in the case of a capital murder case\n       – of course, it’s going to be the penitentiary – then you have to consider\n       Special Issue Number 2. In considering Special Issue Number 2, you have\n       to go back in your mind and in your deliberations with the other eleven\n       jurors and revisit all of the evidence that’s been presented in both phases of\n       the trial[,] the guilt-innocence phase, and the punishment phase. And there\n       might have been something that you heard when you heard it as it was\n       presented during the trial and you look at Special Issue Number 2 and\n       you’re taking into consideration all of the evidence including the\n       circumstances of the offense – so that’s the first part of the trial. That’s\n       where you look at the offense itself in the guilt-innocence phase of the trial,\n       and the defendant’s character and background. More of that probably\n\f                                                                             MUHAMMAD –37\n       comes in during the second phase of the trial than in the first phase of the\n       trial, but there could be some evidence that would come in in the first phase\n       of the trial considering that, and the personal moral culpability of the\n       defendant. “There is a sufficient mitigating circumstance or circumstances\n       to warrant that a sentence of life imprisonment without parole rather than a\n       death sentence should be imposed.” And I think what [defense counsel] is\n       telling you that’s your safety net or that’s the – he uses the example of a\n       light switch to turn the switch from death back to life in prison. If you\n       heard something in the trial you thought was sufficient, certain\n       circumstances or circumstance . . . and that you thought you know what? I\n       know this is a terrible crime. I know I found that I think he will be a future\n       danger, but because of that one circumstance I think that’s sufficient for me\n       to warrant giving him a life sentence rather than a death sentence. And that\n       can be based on anything that you want to base it on. And everybody is\n       individually different. In other words, what [defense counsel] says [is that]\n       the person sitting next to you or behind you might see something else that\n       you don’t think is mitigating, and you might see something that they don’t\n       think is mitigating.\n\nAfter hearing this explanation, Zugelder stated that he would not make a decision solely\n\nout of mercy but would “want something presented in evidence to justify a decision to\n\nchange the decision from death to life presented to justify that.”\n\n       Defense counsel again explained that the concept of mercy would be based on\n\nsomething in the evidence that would prompt Zugelder to conclude that the defendant\n\nshould receive a life sentence. Zugelder agreed that he could make a decision on that\n\nbasis. He explained that he had initially understood defense counsel’s question as asking\n\nhim whether he could “just make a decision just to be merciful.” Zugelder explained that\n\nhe had sought an explanation “from a third person” because that was what he had heard\n\neven though it was not what counsel had intended to say.\n\n       Defense counsel again clarified, “So when we talk about the concept of mercy, it’s\n\f                                                                              MUHAMMAD –38\nthe concept of being able to actually act upon your belief that there was something that\n\nyou heard that would warrant switching that back from death to life.” Zugelder again\n\naffirmed that he could do that. Defense counsel acknowledged that perhaps he had not\n\nexplained the concept very well the first time.\n\n       Defense counsel challenged Zugelder for cause based on his questioning being\n\ninterrupted by the prosecutor’s objections and based on the possibility that the trial court,\n\nin sustaining the prosecutor’s objections, had given Zugelder the impression that defense\n\ncounsel was dishonest. The prosecutor responded that he kept objecting because defense\n\ncounsel kept incorrectly explaining the law. In particular, the prosecutor asserted that\n\ndefense counsel never said that a juror could find a reason to consider mercy “based on\n\nthe evidence,” which confused Zugelder and prompted him to ask the trial court for\n\nclarification. The prosecutor averred that, after the judge cleared up Zugelder’s confusion\n\nabout the role of mercy in considering the mitigation issue, defense counsel asked the\n\nquestion properly. The trial judge stated that it was his impression that Zugelder was\n\nconfused about how the concept of mercy applied to the mitigation special issue.\n\n       Assuming that defense counsel could properly question Zugelder concerning his\n\nability to dispense mercy as defense counsel described the concept, we find that\n\nappellant’s argument is without merit. On this record, it appears that the prosecutor’s first\n\nobjection was proper because, as defense counsel acknowledged, counsel initially failed\n\nto specify that whatever Zugelder perceived as giving rise to mercy in the context of the\n\nmitigation issue had to be based on the evidence presented at trial.\n\f                                                                              MUHAMMAD –39\n       The trial court did not rule on the prosecutor’s second objection. Although\n\nunnecessary, the prosecutor’s third objection, that the law stated that a juror could\n\nconsider mercy but was not required to, did not contradict anything that defense counsel\n\nhad said, nor did it operate to prevent counsel from asking a question. Therefore, the trial\n\ncourt’s ruling sustaining that objection could not have affected Zugelder’s impression of\n\ndefense counsel’s credibility. Further, defense counsel continued to question Zugelder\n\nabout the concept of mercy and eventually elicited Zugelder’s answer to his question. See\n\nWoods v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1504749\"><a href=\"/opinion/1504749/woods-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">152</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">105</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 110 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004) (finding no harm where the\n\nrecord reflected that counsel was able to ask the venire person a question that was\n\nessentially the same as the denied question, or that he was able to elicit the same\n\ninformation that the denied question sought to elicit).\n\n       Based on the totality of Zugelder’s voir dire, the trial court could have reasonably\n\nconcluded that Zugelder had asked for clarification because he was confused by defense\n\ncounsel’s explanation, and not because he mistrusted defense counsel. See Feldman, 71\n\nS.W.3d at 744 (“When reviewing a trial court’s decision to grant or deny a challenge for\n\ncause, we look at the entire record to determine if there is sufficient evidence to support\n\nthe court’s ruling.”). The trial court did not abuse its discretion in overruling appellant’s\n\nchallenge for cause. Point of error ten is overruled.\n\n       In point of error eleven, appellant asserts that the trial court erroneously overruled\n\nhis challenge for cause to prospective juror David Hornstein. Appellant asserts that\n\nHornstein was disqualified based on his: (1) demeanor; (2) inability to consider\n\f                                                                             MUHAMMAD –40\ndefendant’s character and background in mitigation; (3) inability to consider mental\n\nhealth professionals’ testimony in mitigation; and (4) failure to consider voluntary\n\nintoxication as potentially mitigating.\n\n       The trial court was in the best position to evaluate Hornstein’s demeanor, and the\n\nrecord before us does not support appellant’s assertion that Hornstein’s demeanor\n\ndisqualified him from jury service. See Davis, 329 S.W.3d at 807. Concerning his\n\nattitudes toward potentially mitigating evidence, the record shows that Hornstein\n\nresponded negatively to a question on the juror questionnaire that asked whether a\n\ndefendant’s background should be considered in determining the mitigation special issue.\n\nWhen defense counsel questioned him about this response, Hornstein stated that if he had\n\nknown about the special issues when he filled out the questionnaire, he might have\n\nanswered the questions differently. Hornstein suggested that he had understood the\n\nquestions to ask whether evidence such as background would be relevant to the jury’s\n\ndetermination of guilt.\n\n       Hornstein expressed his understanding that the mitigation special issue was “an\n\nadditional filter through which [the defense is] hoping to provide a possibility of reducing\n\nthe severity of the punishment.” Defense counsel agreed with that characterization.\n\nHornstein stated that he thought it was a “valid filter,” but then he asked whether the jury\n\nwould hear any additional or different evidence after reaching a verdict of guilty. This\n\nquestion indicated that Hornstein was confused about the timing of the presentation and\n\nconsideration of evidence at different phases of the trial.\n\f                                                                            MUHAMMAD –41\n        Defense counsel answered Hornstein’s question by explaining that the jury would\n\nhear evidence at the punishment phase that was not relevant to the guilt-or-innocence\n\nphase. Counsel explained that the guilt-or-innocence phase was “like a photograph,” the\n\ncontents of which the State had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, while the punishment\n\nphase involved “the entire photo album . . . of the defendant’s life.” Hornstein then stated\n\nthat he would be able to consider all of the evidence in determining the mitigation special\n\nissue, including the defendant’s character and background: “If it provides the possibility\n\nof someone being spared the death penalty, yes, absolutely.”\n\n        On his juror questionnaire, Hornstein responded to a question about mental-health\n\nprofessionals by indicating that he thought that their testimony would “do more harm than\n\ngood.” When defense counsel asked him about this response, Hornstein explained that he\n\nwould be more concerned with a defendant’s history and past conduct than a\n\nprofessional’s opinion of the defendant after an hour-long interview. He stated that such\n\ntestimony was “something to pay attention to,” but it did not “hold as much validity as the\n\nwhole history of the person.” He stated that he did not regard psychology as a science,\n\nand he did not believe that mental-health professionals were any more qualified than other\n\npeople to “evaluate human beings.” He stated that he would listen to their testimony but\n\nhe would not regard it as “expert” testimony. Hornstein affirmed that he would keep an\n\nopen mind and consider all types of evidence. He stated that he would not discount the\n\nopinions of mental-health professionals but would consider them together with everything\n\nelse.\n\f                                                                              MUHAMMAD –42\n       Hornstein also wrote on the juror questionnaire that he did not think intoxication\n\nevidence should be mitigating. But when defense counsel questioned him about this\n\nresponse, Hornstein stated that, without regard to his personal opinions, he would be\n\nwilling to consider such evidence in mitigation because the law required him to do so.\n\n       Hornstein’s statements indicating his initial confusion about the role of\n\nbackground evidence, his skepticism with regard to the testimony of mental-health\n\nprofessionals, and his opinion that intoxication evidence was not mitigating, did not\n\ndisqualify him. See Feldman, 71 S.W.3d at 747; Standefer, 59 S.W.3d at 181. Further,\n\nafter the different phases of the trial had been explained to him, Hornstein affirmed that\n\nhe would consider all of the evidence when determining his answers to the special issues.\n\nTo the extent that Hornstein’s answers were conflicting or vacillating, we defer to the trial\n\ncourt’s decision. See Smith, 297 S.W.3d at 268. The trial court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in overruling appellant’s challenge for cause. Point of error eleven is\n\noverruled.\n\n       In point of error twelve, appellant asserts that the trial court erred by denying his\n\nchallenge for cause to prospective juror Andrea Griffith. He argues that Griffith was\n\ndisqualified because she was “mitigation impaired” and could not properly consider all\n\npotentially mitigating evidence. Appellant avers that Griffith’s responses on her written\n\nquestionnaire and during voir dire showed that she would not be able to adequately and\n\nproperly consider “any and all evidence that may be presented regarding sufficiently\n\nmitigating circumstances that are required by law.”\n\f                                                                               MUHAMMAD –43\n       Griffith’s questionnaire responses indicated that she would not regard background\n\nand intoxication evidence as mitigating. However, after the special issues were explained\n\nto Griffith during voir dire, she stated that she could give effect to all of the evidence\n\nsubmitted, including intoxication, when determining the mitigation special issue. Griffith\n\nwas not required to regard any particular type of evidence as mitigating, so long as she\n\ncould consider all of the evidence in deliberating on the mitigation issue. See Hernandez,\n\n390 S.W.3d at 315. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in overruling appellant’s\n\nchallenge for cause. Point of error twelve is overruled.\n\n       In point of error thirteen, appellant complains that the trial court erroneously\n\ndenied his challenge for cause to prospective juror Bradford McCutheon. Appellant avers\n\nthat McCutheon was disqualified because he could not give fair consideration to the\n\nspecial issues. The record shows that, although McCutheon’s questionnaire and voir dire\n\nresponses demonstrated that he strongly favored the death penalty, they also showed that\n\nhe would consider the evidence when deciding the special issues. McCutheon repeatedly\n\nstated during voir dire that he would not answer the special issues in such a way that the\n\ndeath penalty would result just because he had found someone guilty of capital murder.\n\nHe stated that he would follow the law and “keep an open mind all the way through” the\n\nprocess. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in overruling appellant’s challenge for\n\ncause. Point of error thirteen is overruled.\n\n       In point of error fourteen, appellant asserts that the trial court erroneously denied\n\nhis challenge for cause to prospective juror Elvira Corpus. He asserts that she was\n\f                                                                            MUHAMMAD –44\ndisqualified because she would automatically impose a death sentence after finding a\n\ndefendant guilty of capital murder.\n\n       Corpus indicated on her jury questionnaire that she thought that background\n\ncircumstances were sometimes “just an excuse” that should not be considered in\n\ndetermining proper punishment. However, during voir dire, Corpus stated that she could\n\nconsider such evidence. She specifically agreed that she could consider mental-health\n\nand substance-abuse evidence. She opined that intoxication evidence was not mitigating,\n\nbut she added that she could consider it. Corpus repeatedly stated that after finding a\n\ndefendant guilty, she could keep an open mind and hear the evidence before deciding the\n\nspecial issues. She stated that she would not automatically answer either special issue but\n\nwould listen to the evidence and make her decision on that basis.\n\n       Appellant also complains that the defense was prevented from asking Corpus a\n\nproper question “regarding automatic death” because the trial court sustained the State’s\n\nobjection. The record shows that Corpus answered “yes” to question number three on the\n\nquestionnaire, which asked, “If you are in favor of the death penalty in some cases, do\n\nyou agree that a life sentence, rather than the death penalty, would be appropriate under\n\nthe proper circumstances in some cases?” During voir dire, the prosecutor asked Corpus\n\nto elaborate on this response. Corpus replied that, depending on “what took place” during\n\nthe offense, the death penalty might not be appropriate. The prosecutor then explained to\n\nCorpus that there would be no conviction for capital murder if the offense was justified or\n\naccidental.\n\f                                                                              MUHAMMAD –45\n       Later, defense counsel followed up on this topic. He explained that a capital\n\nmurder always involves an intentional murder in which there is no justification and there\n\nis always violence. Counsel then asked Corpus whether she would change her answer to\n\nquestion number three, and she responded that she would. Counsel asked her what her\n\nnew answer would be, and Corpus answered, “Let’s see. Wait a minute. It would have to\n\nbe – no.” Counsel then asked more specifically, “So to question number three, knowing\n\nnow that there would be no justification you don’t agree that a life sentence would be\n\nappropriate under certain circumstances in a capital murder case?”\n\n       Before Corpus could answer the question, the prosecutor objected that Corpus had\n\n“already previously stated that in certain circumstances that if she feels it’s appropriate\n\nthat she could give a life sentence.” The trial court sustained the objection. Defense\n\ncounsel then asked Corpus whether her previous statement to the prosecutor was based on\n\na scenario involving justification or “no violence,” and Corpus answered affirmatively.\n\nShe reiterated that her answer to question number three would now be, “No.”\n\n       Assuming without deciding that the trial court abused its discretion by preventing\n\ndefense counsel from asking Corpus whether she had decided that a life sentence was not\n\nappropriate in a capital-murder case, we find no harm because counsel was allowed to\n\nelicit essentially the same information from Corpus when he asked her whether she would\n\nchange her answer to question number three, and whether she would now answer the\n\nquestion in the negative. See Woods, 152 S.W.3d at 110. A review of Corpus’s entire\n\nvoir dire reveals that the parties covered this area of inquiry thoroughly, and therefore\n\f                                                                               MUHAMMAD –46\nappellant was not harmed when the trial court sustained the prosecutor’s objection.\n\n       Corpus’s opinions regarding the mitigating value of particular types of evidence\n\ndid not disqualify her. See Hernandez, 390 S.W.3d at 315. She stated that she could\n\nconsider all of the evidence in determining the special issues. To the extent that Corpus\n\nvacillated or made conflicting statements, we defer to the trial court’s decision. See\n\nSmith, 297 S.W.3d at 268. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in overruling\n\nappellant’s challenge for cause. Point of error fourteen is overruled.\n\n       In point of error fifteen, appellant asserts that the trial court erroneously denied his\n\nchallenge for cause to venire person Temple Koestner. He avers that she was disqualified\n\nbecause she would “automatically equate a guilty verdict with a death sentence” and\n\nwould be unable to give appropriate consideration to the special issues.\n\n       Koestner’s questionnaire responses demonstrated that she strongly favored the\n\ndeath penalty. During voir dire, however, Koestner affirmed that, after convicting a\n\ndefendant of capital murder, she would have an open mind and would allow the evidence\n\nto inform her decision on punishment. She again affirmed that she would have an open\n\nmind when considering whether the evidence was sufficiently mitigating.\n\n       However, when defense counsel questioned her about situations in which she\n\nwould automatically assess the death penalty, Koestner identified cases involving the\n\nmurder of a child, the murder of two or more people, murder for hire, murder in the\n\ncourse of kidnapping or robbery, or murder of a fireman. Defense counsel asked\n\nKoestner for clarification, and it became apparent that she was confused about the\n\f                                                                             MUHAMMAD –47\nfunction of the special issues in assessing punishment:\n\n       Q. Okay. And so if you were on a hypothetical jury and you guys believed\n       each and every element beyond a reasonable doubt that would equate to a\n       guilty verdict on a capital murder, any of those that you just listed, then at\n       that point you would always answer those two special issues in such a\n       manner where the sentence would always be death. Is that what you’re\n       telling me, Ms. Koestner?\n\n       A. That I would answer them – no. We would have to go through those\n       particular situations as what the gentleman said earlier. If there’s a\n       reasonable doubt they would have to be found not guilty.\n\n       Q. No, ma’am. Let me back you up.\n\n       A. I’m sorry. I’m confused here then.\n\n       Q. It’s okay. You’re fine. You’re fine. But when we get to the point of\n       actually talking about a sentence, you have to remember we’re talking about\n       a death sentence. That’s punishment.\n\n       A. Right.\n\n       Q. So that means that a person has already been found guilty beyond a\n       reasonable doubt.\n\n       A. Okay.\n\n       Q. Okay. So I think –\n\n       A. Found guilty already?\n\n       Q. Yes, ma’am.\n\n                                            ***\n\n       Q. (BY [DEFENSE COUNSEL]) The law states, Ms. Koestner, is [sic] that\n       in order for a death sentence to be rendered, that after the individual has\n       been found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of that capital murder charge –\n       like I said, you listed them. We know what you’re talking about over there.\n\f                                                                              MUHAMMAD –48\n       A. Okay.\n\n       Q. That once the person has been found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt\n       the law states that in order to get to a death sentence those two special\n       issues have to be answered in a particular fashion. Special issue number\n       one has to be answered in the affirmative.\n\n               Special issue number two is that there’s nothing sufficiently\n       mitigating to warrant saving the defendant’s life. That’s what the law\n       states.\n\n       A. Yes.\n\n       Q. Now, some people say that their feelings are so strong in some of these\n       examples of capital murder, they understand what the law is, but regardless\n       of what the law is that once they reach a guilty verdict that at that point they\n       will also answer these two special issues in such a fashion where the\n       sentence will always be death. That’s my question to you.\n\n       A. So will I always answer death?\n\n       Q. Yes, ma’am.\n\n       A. No.\n\n       After additional discussion, Koestner expressed her understanding that after a\n\ndefendant was found guilty of capital murder, the sentence would be life without parole\n\nunless and until the jury answered the special issues in such a way that a death sentence\n\nwould be imposed.\n\n       Counsel then asked Koestner about her questionnaire response indicating that a\n\ncapital murderer would always pose a future danger. Koestner stated that she would not\n\nnecessarily find that a defendant was a future danger based solely on the offense of\n\nconviction because he would be in prison, and she did not think that a capital murderer\n\f                                                                              MUHAMMAD –49\nwould be a threat to prison society. When defense counsel asked Koestner if that meant\n\nthat she would always answer the future-dangerousness question in the negative, she\n\nacknowledged that she was confused. Counsel did not attempt to clarify Koestner’s\n\nposition further but instead moved on to the mitigation issue.\n\n       Koestner stated that she could take all of the evidence into consideration in\n\nanswering the mitigation issue. Defense counsel then asked her about her questionnaire\n\nanswer that indicated she would not consider a defendant’s background or character in\n\nmaking the punishment decision. Koestner explained that she had not known about the\n\nspecial issues when she answered the question. Once Koestner understood the special\n\nissues, she recognized that her questionnaire answer was incorrect under the law.\n\nKoestner stated that she still felt that people make their own choices, but now that she\n\nknew how the guilt phase and the punishment special issues worked, she could consider\n\nsuch evidence in reaching a decision on the mitigation special issue.\n\n       Appellant did not establish that Koestner understood the requirements of the law\n\nbut could not overcome her prejudice well enough to follow it. See Davis, 329 S.W.3d at\n\n807. After the law was explained to her, Koestner affirmed that she could set aside her\n\npersonal feelings. See Feldman, 71 S.W.3d at 744. To the extent that Koestner\n\nvacillated, we defer to the trial court’s decision. See Smith, 297 S.W.3d at 268. The trial\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in overruling appellant’s challenge for cause. Point of\n\nerror fifteen is overruled.\n\n       In point of error sixteen, appellant asserts that the trial court erroneously denied his\n\f                                                                             MUHAMMAD –50\nchallenge for cause to venire person Nancy Munn. He argues that Munn was disqualified\n\nbecause she was “death prone.” He avers that she could not consider the mitigation issue\n\nafter finding that a defendant was guilty and posed a future danger. He acknowledges\n\nthat during voir dire, Munn vacillated and equivocated concerning the special issues, but\n\nhe argues that “her true feelings” were that she would be unable to consider all of the\n\nevidence. In addition, appellant argues, Munn thought it might violate her conscience to\n\nfind a defendant not guilty due to a “technicality” even if the law demanded it, and she\n\nwould believe police officers over other witnesses.\n\n       The record does not support appellant’s allegations. When asked about the special\n\nissues, Munn affirmed that she would keep an open mind and listen to all of the evidence.\n\nWhen asked about her questionnaire answer indicating her belief that the death penalty\n\nshould be available in a case involving the death of a child, she stated that she would not\n\nautomatically impose the death penalty in such a case. When defense counsel asked\n\nMunn about her questionnaire response indicating that she thought the death penalty was\n\nimposed too seldom because of “the cost [to] taxpayers” of housing inmates and hearing\n\nappeals, Munn answered that she “was answering this questionnaire based on beliefs that\n\nI’ve had, but not really being involved in the circumstances where I’ve been put in a\n\nposition of having to make a decision like that.” She stated that she would decide the\n\nanswers to the special issues based on the facts before her and not on “the financial part.”\n\n       Defense counsel asked Munn about her questionnaire response indicating that a\n\ndefendant’s character and background should not be considered when determining the\n\f                                                                              MUHAMMAD –51\nproper punishment. Munn stated that she had not known the law when she completed the\n\nquestionnaire, but now that she had learned about the law during voir dire, she would\n\n“look at everything differently with different eyes.” When counsel asked Munn why she\n\nhad stated earlier that she felt that death would always be appropriate in a case involving\n\nthe death of a child, she stated that she had answered based on her personal beliefs, but\n\nnow that she was familiar with the process, she would take all of the facts into\n\nconsideration.\n\n       When asked what the result at the guilt phase would be if the State proved that the\n\ndefendant was guilty of the offense but failed to prove venue, Munn responded that she\n\nwould have to find that the defendant was innocent. She stated that she could do it but\n\nacknowledged that it would be hard. She affirmed that she could hold the State to its\n\nburden of proof.\n\n       Munn indicated on her questionnaire her belief that police officers were more\n\nlikely than the average person to tell the truth, but she also wrote that officers “are people\n\nso they make mistakes.” During voir dire, she testified that she would treat all witnesses\n\nthe same. She noted that people do not tell the truth all the time, police officers are\n\nhuman, and she would not automatically find an officer more credible than other\n\nwitnesses but instead would listen to the testimony to judge each witness’s credibility.\n\n       Munn’s testimony during voir dire showed that she would assess a sentence based\n\non the law and that she would consider any evidence offered in determining her answers\n\nto the special issues. See Feldman, 71 S.W.3d at 747. She did not say that she would be\n\f                                                                                MUHAMMAD –52\nunable to find a defendant not guilty based on a “technicality.” Her responses concerning\n\npolice officer testimony did not disqualify her. Id. To the extent that Munn’s answers\n\nwere vacillating, unclear, or contradictory, the trial court appropriately considered her\n\ndemeanor and credibility in determining her qualifications. See Threadgill v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2175651\"><a href=\"/opinion/2175651/threadgill-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">146</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">654</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 667 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004). The trial court did not abuse its discretion in\n\ndenying appellant’s challenge for cause. Point of error sixteen is overruled.4\n\n       In point of error seventeen, appellant asserts that the trial court erroneously denied\n\nhis challenge for cause to prospective juror Ernest Hand. Appellant argues that Hand was\n\ndisqualified because he was “death prone.”\n\n       In his questionnaire responses, Hand indicated that he strongly favored the death\n\npenalty and he believed that a defendant’s background should not be considered when\n\ndetermining punishment. However, he also indicated that the death penalty should not be\n\napplied in all murder cases. During voir dire, Hand reiterated his opinion that some\n\nmurderers deserve a life sentence. He testified that after finding a defendant guilty of\n\ncapital murder, he could “refocus” and give the special issues a “fair look.” He would not\n\nautomatically answer the special issues in such a way that death would result. Instead, he\n\nwould “wait and listen” to all of the evidence before answering the special issues. Hand\n\nstated that, if the State’s evidence did not persuade him beyond all reasonable doubt that\n\n\n\n       4\n         Appellant exercised his second extra peremptory strike against venire person Robin\nSwarz, but he does not complain on appeal about the trial court’s denial of his challenge for\ncause against her.\n\f                                                                              MUHAMMAD –53\nthe defendant would continue to victimize others, he could answer the future-\n\ndangerousness question in the negative. Hand affirmed that, even after finding a\n\ndefendant guilty and a future danger, he could still answer the mitigation special issue in\n\nsuch a way that a life sentence would be imposed.\n\n       Hand testified that he would listen to any evidence presented on the special issues.\n\nSee Threadgill, 146 S.W.3d at 667. He was not required to regard evidence of\n\nbackground as mitigating. See Standefer, 59 S.W.3d at 181. To the extent that his\n\nresponses were vacillating or contradictory, we afford particular deference to the trial\n\ncourt’s decision. See Smith, 297 S.W.3d at 268. The trial court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in denying appellant’s challenge for cause. Point of error seventeen is\n\noverruled.\n\n       Because appellant has not shown that the trial court erroneously denied his\n\nchallenges for cause to at least three prospective jurors, we need not address his points of\n\nerror one and eight, concerning his challenges to voir dire members Milton Powell and\n\nAnthony Morrison. Points of error one and eight are overruled.\n\n                                  ALTERNATE JURORS\n\n       In points of error eighteen through twenty, appellant asserts that the trial court\n\nerroneously denied his challenges for cause to three prospective alternate jurors. Article\n\n35.15(d) provides, in relevant part, that if one or two alternate jurors are to be impaneled,\n\neach party is entitled to one peremptory challenge to be used against an alternate juror. In\n\naccordance with Article 35.15(d), appellant received one peremptory strike to use in the\n\f                                                                               MUHAMMAD –54\nselection of alternate jurors. Therefore, to demonstrate that he is entitled to relief,\n\nappellant must show that the trial court erroneously denied one of his challenges for cause\n\nto prospective alternate jurors. He must also show that he unsuccessfully requested an\n\nadditional peremptory strike which he would have used to remove another alternate juror\n\nwhom he identified as “objectionable” and who actually sat on the jury.

He argues that\n\nMcDaniel was disqualified because her written questionnaire responses indicated that\n\nshe: (1) was “death prone”; (2) would automatically assess a death sentence after\n\nconvicting a defendant of capital murder; (3) would not adequately consider the future-\n\ndangerousness special issue; and (4) would require a defendant to show remorse before\n\nshe could answer the mitigation issue affirmatively.\n\n       As appellant acknowledges, the answers that McDaniel provided during voir dire,\n\nafter the law was explained to her, differed from her questionnaire responses. During\n\nvoir dire, McDaniel affirmed that, after finding a defendant guilty of capital murder, she\n\nwould be open to returning a sentence of either life in prison or death. She stated that she\n\nwould not automatically answer the special issues in such a way that a death sentence\n\f                                                                              MUHAMMAD –55\nwould result. She affirmed that, if she found a defendant guilty of capital murder, she\n\nwould hold the State to its burden to prove to her that the defendant would commit other\n\ncriminal acts of violence before she would answer the future-dangerousness special issue\n\naffirmatively. She also stated that she would be open to answering the mitigation issue\n\naffirmatively and would consider all of the evidence. On her questionnaire, McDaniel\n\nopined that criminals showed little remorse and faced light consequences. However, she\n\nstated during voir dire that she would not require a defendant to testify and show remorse\n\nbefore she could answer the mitigation issue affirmatively. The trial court did not abuse\n\nits discretion in denying appellant’s challenge for cause. Point of error eighteen is\n\noverruled.\n\n       In point of error nineteen, appellant asserts that the trial court erroneously denied\n\nhis challenge for cause to prospective alternate juror Arleen Jimenez. Appellant did not\n\nhave any more peremptory strikes, and his request for an additional strike was denied.\n\nJimenez was seated, over his objections, as an alternate juror. When another juror was\n\nremoved from the jury, Jimenez took his place. Appellant argues that Jimenez was\n\ndisqualified because, based on her questionnaire and voir dire responses, she would\n\nautomatically give a death sentence to anyone convicted of capital murder.\n\n       Jimenez’s written questionnaire responses indicated that she strongly favored the\n\ndeath penalty, but they also indicated that she did not think the death penalty was an\n\nappropriate punishment in all murder cases. During voir dire, Jimenez stated, “Well, I’m\n\nnot 100 percent death. . . . Probably before all these people were being released after 20\n\f                                                                               MUHAMMAD –56\nyears plus then I was probably at 100 percent. But recent activity here makes you wonder\n\nsometimes.” She repeatedly affirmed that, after finding a defendant guilty, she could\n\nkeep an open mind and not automatically answer the special issues. Jimenez twice opined\n\nthat drowning was a horrible way to die, but she added that knowing that the offense had\n\ninvolved drowning would not automatically lead her to impose a death sentence. Jimenez\n\nstated that the facts and severity of the offense, plus a prior criminal record, would be\n\nimportant to her in deciding the appropriate punishment. Jimenez expressed her\n\nunderstanding that the State had to prove future dangerousness beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt.\n\n         Jimenez affirmed that, even after answering the future-dangerousness question\n\naffirmatively, she would not automatically answer the mitigation issue negatively.\n\nAlthough she had noted on her questionnaire that too many people used background or\n\nintoxication as excuses for their misconduct, she stated during voir dire that she would be\n\nable to consider such evidence in mitigation. She stated that she “would have had to hear\n\neverything.”\n\n         To the extent that Jimenez’s answers were conflicting or vacillating, the trial court\n\nwas in the best position to evaluate her testimony and qualifications. See Smith, 297\n\nS.W.3d at 268. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant’s\n\nchallenge for cause. Point of error nineteen is overruled.\n\n         In point of error twenty, appellant complains that the trial court erroneously denied\n\nhis challenge for cause to prospective alternate juror Dan Blanks. However, the record\n\f                                                                                 MUHAMMAD –57\nshows that Blanks did not participate in jury deliberations. Therefore, appellant cannot\n\nshow any harm. See Busby, 253 S.W.3d at 670. Point of error twenty is overruled.\n\n       In points of error twenty-one and twenty-two, appellant asserts that the jury as\n\nconstituted was biased or prejudiced, thus depriving him of a fair trial in violation of his\n\nrights to due process guaranteed by the United States Constitution, the Texas\n\nConstitution, and Article 35.16. Because appellant has not demonstrated that any juror\n\nwho served on his case was biased or otherwise disqualified, or that he was otherwise\n\nharmed, he has failed to show that he was deprived of a fair trial. See Gray v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2101781\"><a href=\"/opinion/2101781/gray-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">233</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">295</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 301 (Tex.

In points of error twenty-three and twenty-\n\nfour, appellant complains that the trial court erroneously admitted autopsy photographs of\n\nthe victims over appellant’s Rule 403 objection that their probative value was\n\nsubstantially outweighed by their prejudicial effect. T EX. R. E VID. 403.5 State’s Exhibits\n\n11 through 23 were autopsy photographs of Elijah. State’s Exhibits 4 through 9 were\n\nautopsy photographs of Naim.\n\n       Defense counsel argued that any probative value of the photographs was\n\n\n       5\n        Unless otherwise indicated, all future references to Rules refer to the Texas Rules of\nEvidence.\n\f                                                                            MUHAMMAD –58\nsubstantially outweighed by their prejudicial effect because the defense conceded that\n\nappellant committed the offense and also conceded “causation in the manner alleged.”\n\nCounsel further argued that the photographs were unnecessary because there was no legal\n\nor factual question about what they depicted. The trial court overruled appellant’s\n\nobjections, finding that the probative value of the photographs outweighed their\n\nprejudicial effect.\n\n         Defense counsel then argued that the photographs were numerous and duplicative.\n\nThe prosecutor responded that she had met with the medical examiner, Dr. Tracy Dyer,\n\nwho had selected the photographs that Dyer deemed necessary for her testimony\n\nconcerning “all the injuries on these two children that she observed during their\n\nautopsies.” The prosecutor noted that the nineteen photographs she offered were drawn\n\nfrom a group of “nearly 200 photographs.” The trial judge stated, “You have my ruling.”\n\n         Appellant complains that the photographs were excessive and numerous, some of\n\nthem were extremely gruesome, and they were all in color. He argues that the prosecutor\n\npresented them to appeal to jurors’ emotions. He suggests that the photographs were\n\nparticularly prejudicial because there was no controverted issue concerning the cause of\n\ndeath.\n\n         The admission of photographs over an objection is within the sound discretion of\n\nthe trial court.

Id. However, otherwise\n\nrelevant evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by\n\nthe danger of unfair prejudice. Id. A court may consider several factors in determining\n\nwhether the probative value of photographs is substantially outweighed by the danger of\n\nunfair prejudice, including, but not limited to: the number of exhibits offered, their\n\ngruesomeness, their detail, their size, whether they are black and white or color, whether\n\nthey are close-up, and whether the body depicted is naked or clothed. Id. The availability\n\nof other means of proof and the circumstances unique to each individual case must also\n\nbe considered. Id.\n\n       Although appellant did not present evidence or argument controverting the State’s\n\ncase at the guilt-or-innocence phase, he pleaded not guilty. Therefore, the State had the\n\nburden to prove every element of the offense of intentionally or knowingly causing the\n\ndeaths of two people during the same criminal transaction. See T EX. P ENAL C ODE\n\n§ 19.03(a)(7). The State had to prove not only that appellant inflicted the injuries that led\n\nto the victims’ deaths, but also that he acted with the conscious objective or desire to\n\ncause death or with awareness that his conduct was reasonably certain to cause death.\n\nSee, e.g., Landrian v.

Dr. Dyer used\n\nExhibit 11, which depicted fluid coming from Elijah’s nose, to explain the process of\n\npostmortem purging. She used Exhibit 12, which depicted paper bags placed over\n\nElijah’s hands, to explain the medical examiner’s office’s standard practice for preserving\n\nevidence and collecting fingernail clippings. Exhibit 13 depicted Elijah’s body after it\n\nhad been cleaned for the autopsy. Dyer used Exhibits 14 through 21 to describe the\n\ninjuries she observed during the external examination of Elijah. Each photograph was a\n\nclose-up of a specific part of Elijah’s body depicting a different area of injury.\n\nSpecifically, Exhibits 14 and 15 depicted Elijah’s facial injuries; Exhibit 16 depicted a\n\f                                                                             MUHAMMAD –61\nlinear abrasion on his back; Exhibit 17 depicted an abrasion on the outside of his left leg;\n\nExhibit 18 depicted abrasions and a blister on the sole of his left foot; Exhibit 19 depicted\n\nabrasions on the top of his right foot; Exhibit 20 depicted abrasions on the back of his\n\nlower right leg; and Exhibit 21 depicted an abrasion on his wrist. Exhibits 22 and 23\n\ndepicted injuries that Dyer observed during the internal examination of Elijah.\n\nSpecifically, Exhibit 22 depicted bruising on the underside of Elijah’s scalp that was not\n\nclearly visible externally. Exhibit 23, a photograph of a section of Elijah’s upper airway\n\nthat had been removed from his body, depicted the dirt and debris in Elijah’s airway.\n\n       Dyer used Exhibits 4 through 9, autopsy photographs of Naim, in the same manner\n\nshe had used the autopsy photographs of Elijah. Specifically, Exhibit 4 showed Naim’s\n\nappearance and the clothes he was wearing when he arrived at the medical examiner’s\n\noffice. It also depicted white foam coming from his nose and mouth, the result of\n\npostmortem purging. Exhibit 5 showed Naim’s body after it had been cleaned for\n\nautopsy. Exhibits 6 through 8 were close-up photographs of specific parts of Naim’s\n\nbody. Each photograph depicted a different area of injury that Dyer observed during the\n\nexternal examination. Specifically, Exhibits 6 and 7 depicted abrasions on the right side\n\nof Naim’s face and forehead, and Exhibit 8 depicted abrasions on the back of his hand.\n\nExhibit 9 depicted injuries that Dyer observed during the internal examination,\n\nspecifically, bruising on the underside of Naim’s scalp, caused by impacts that did not\n\f                                                                                MUHAMMAD –62\nresult in visible external bruising.6\n\n       Dyer was entitled to testify to the manner of death, cause of death, and the number\n\nand types of injuries the victims sustained.

Crim. App. 1991). These were issues as to which the photographs were relevant.\n\nSee id. The fact that appellant did not contest the manner of death did not render the\n\nmedical examiner’s testimony or the photographs irrelevant. See id. The State minimized\n\nthe number of photographs and used only those necessary for Dyer’s testimony. These\n\nphotographs were not particularly numerous or gruesome. See Gallo, 239 S.W.3d at 763-\n\n64. The photographs of internal injuries depicted bruising and other damage that were\n\nnot visible externally and which were attributable to appellant’s actions. Therefore, the\n\nphotographs were relevant to establishing the manner of death. See Ripkowski v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1588890\"><a href=\"/opinion/1588890/ripkowski-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">378</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 392-93 (Tex. Crim. App. 2001) (finding that a photograph of an organ that\n\nhad been removed from the victim’s body, depicting bruising that Ripkowski inflicted\n\nduring the offense, was not unduly prejudicial and was highly relevant to the manner of\n\ndeath); see also Gallo, 239 S.W.3d at 763 (stating that autopsy photographs showing\n\ninjuries on the underside of the victim’s scalp that were not visible externally were highly\n\nprobative to show the full extent of the injuries appellant inflicted, and, although they\n\nwere gruesome, there was no danger that the jury would attribute the mutilation caused by\n\nthe autopsy procedure to the defendant). The trial court did not abuse its discretion by\n\n\n       6\n          Appellant identifies State’s Exhibit 9 as an “extreme closeup of [Naim’s] chest showing\nbruising.” This identification does not correspond to the exhibit in the reporter’s record.\n\f                                                                               MUHAMMAD –63\nadmitting State’s Exhibits 11 through 23 and 4 through 9. Points of error twenty-three\n\nand twenty-four are overruled.\n\n       In points of error twenty-five and twenty-six, appellant asserts that the trial court\n\nerroneously admitted State’s Exhibits 77 and 78, autopsy-identification photographs of\n\nElijah and Naim that were introduced during Kametra’s testimony. Each photograph was\n\na close-up view of the face and bare upper torso of the deceased child. The medical\n\nexaminer’s placard showing the autopsy-identification number was placed across the\n\nchild’s chest. Appellant complains that the jury had already seen autopsy photographs of\n\nthe children, including photographs of their faces, during the medical examiner’s\n\ntestimony. He “incorporates by reference as if set out verbatim the argument and\n\nauthorities presented in [points of error] 23 and 24 to support this issue that the trial court\n\nreversibly erred in overruling Appellant’s objections to State’s Exhibits 77 and 78.”\n\n       At trial, defense counsel objected under Rule 403 to the admission of these\n\nphotographs. He asserted that there was no issue regarding the identities of the children\n\nand that he had offered to stipulate to their identities. Counsel further argued that, in light\n\nof the defense’s concession of guilt, the photographs had no probative value and were\n\noffered only to provoke a visceral response from Kametra during her testimony. The\n\nprosecutor responded that, because appellant pleaded not guilty, the State was required to\n\nprove the victims’ identities beyond a reasonable doubt. The prosecutor also noted that\n\nthe State had not yet proven the victims’ identities because Dyer did not have personal\n\nknowledge of their identities. The trial court examined the photographs and overruled\n\f                                                                               MUHAMMAD –64\nappellant’s objection. At the conclusion of Kametra’s direct examination, the prosecutor\n\nshowed her State’s Exhibits 77 and 78. She identified the child depicted in Exhibit 77 as\n\nElijah and the child depicted in Exhibit 78 as Naim.\n\n         These photographs were relevant because Kametra’s identification of the children\n\nlinked Dyer’s autopsy reports and testimony to the victims named in the indictment. The\n\nphotographs were not particularly gruesome; they portrayed nothing more than the\n\nvictims’ condition due to the injuries appellant had inflicted. As such, their probative\n\nvalue was not unduly outweighed by their prejudicial effect. See Young, 283 S.W.3d at\n\n875. Points of error twenty-five and twenty-six are overruled.\n\n         In point of error twenty-seven, appellant claims that the trial court erroneously\n\noverruled his objection that the State’s closing argument was “outside the scope of\n\nguilt/innocence” and was therefore improper. He asserts that the State’s argument was\n\nintended to prejudice the jury against him. He further asserts that the argument was\n\n“manifestly improper and extreme in nature” and injected new and harmful facts into the\n\ntrial.\n\n         In relevant part, the record contains the following argument, objection, and ruling:\n\n         [PROSECUTOR]: Y’all can remember the evidence that you heard\n         yesterday, Monday. He took those kids down there and he knew what he\n         was going do, and he told them to sit down.\n\n                What did he tell them? Put your head down in the water and act like\n         you are swimming. And that’s when he took his hands and he put them on\n         each kid and he held their head[s] under the water. Can you imagine what\n         that must have felt like? What were those kids thinking?\n\f                                                                              MUHAMMAD –65\n       [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Judge, again, I’m going to object again. This\n       entire argument is now outside the scope of guilt/innocence and we’re\n       going to object to it at this phase of the trial.\n\n       THE COURT: I will overrule the objection.\n\nArguably, the prosecutor’s questions asking jurors if they could imagine what the children\n\nwere feeling and thinking directed the jury’s attention to a matter that was not relevant to\n\nappellant’s guilt or innocence. However, the jury had heard appellant’s own statement to\n\nthe police in which he described Elijah crying for his mother, Naim asking appellant not\n\nto kill them, and Naim kicking when appellant held him down. Therefore, the\n\nprosecutor’s question arguably invited a reasonable deduction from the evidence. See,\n\ne.g., Berry v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2101333\"><a href=\"/opinion/2101333/berry-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">233</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">847</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 860 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007). Contrary to appellant’s\n\nposition, the question did not inject new and harmful facts into the trial.\n\n       The prosecutor’s argument was, at most, mildly improper. Cf. Martinez v. State,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1561283\"><a href=\"/opinion/1561283/martinez-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">677</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 693 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000). Further, the evidence supporting\n\nappellant’s conviction was exceptionally strong even absent this argument. See Freeman\n\nv. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2545239\"><a href=\"/opinion/2545239/freeman-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">340</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">717</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 728-29 (Tex. Crim. App. 2011). We find that the error, if any,\n\ndid not affect appellant’s substantial rights. See id. Point of error twenty-seven is\n\noverruled.\n\n                                  PUNISHMENT PHASE\n\n       In point of error twenty-eight, appellant claims that the trial court erroneously\n\noverruled his objection to a CPS investigator’s testimony concerning her conversation\n\nwith appellant. Specifically, he complains that a CPS investigator, Pamela Womack, and\n\f                                                                             MUHAMMAD –66\na CPS case worker, Eduardo Beale, interviewed appellant while he was in jail without\n\nproviding Miranda7 warnings.8 Citing Wilkerson v. State,9 appellant acknowledges that\n\npolice officers and CPS workers “generally run on separate, parallel paths.” He argues,\n\nhowever, that the paths of CPS and the police converged in this case in such a way that\n\nthey were investigating the criminal offense in tandem, and therefore Miranda warnings\n\nand Article 38.22 compliance were required. He submits that the CPS employees who\n\ninterviewed him had become agents of the State. Therefore, appellant reasons, the trial\n\ncourt erred by admitting the complained-of testimony.\n\n       “Although state employment clearly makes a person an ‘agent of the State,’ that\n\nlabel does not, by itself, make the person an ‘agent of the State’ for the purpose of\n\ndefining ‘custodial interrogation.’” Wilkerson, 173 S.W.3d at 528. The law does not\n\npresume that a CPS worker is an agent of the police or prosecutor. Id. at 529-30. The\n\nperson alleging the agency relationship has the burden of proving it. Id. at 529. We\n\nexamine the entire record to determine whether the investigative paths of CPS and the\n\npolice converged in a particular case. Id. at 530.\n\n       The record does not reflect that Womack and Beale were acting as\n\n“instrumentalit[ies]” or “conduit[s]” for the police or prosecution when they interviewed\n\nappellant. See Wilkerson, 173 S.W.3d at 530. Womack testified that she interviewed\n\n       7\n           Miranda v.

Crim. App. 2005).\n\f                                                                              MUHAMMAD –67\nappellant as part of a CPS investigation to determine the placement of appellant and\n\nKametra’s surviving child, Jeremiah. Womack stated that she did not speak to law-\n\nenforcement officials about the case before she interviewed appellant, and she did not\n\nknow whether Beale had done so. See id. She acknowledged that CPS would share\n\ninformation from its investigations with law enforcement if requested to do so. However,\n\nthis fact alone did not transform her into an agent of law enforcement. See id. at 533.\n\n       Appellant did not meet his burden of showing that the CPS interview amounted to\n\na custodial interrogation. Therefore, the trial court’s decision to admit Womack’s\n\ntestimony over appellant’s objection did not constitute an abuse of discretion. See Berry,\n\n233 S.W.3d at 856. Point of error twenty-eight is overruled.\n\n       In point of error twenty-nine, appellant asserts that the trial court erroneously\n\noverruled his objection to State’s Exhibit 173, “a purported judgment of misdemeanor\n\noffense of evading arrest in Cause No. M97-57574,” because there were no identifying\n\nfingerprints on the judgment “to legally tie” the conviction to him. He reasons that,\n\nwithout identifying evidence tying the document to him, the jury could not find beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt that he committed the extraneous offense. At trial, defense counsel\n\nobjected to the “lack of a predicate and failure to establish correlation between the exhibit\n\nand the Defendant.”\n\n       To establish that appellant had been convicted of a prior offense, the State had to\n\nprove that the prior conviction existed and that appellant was linked to it. See Flowers v.\n\nState, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1756426\"><a href=\"/opinion/1756426/flowers-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">220</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">919</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 921 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007). The State was not required to prove\n\f                                                                               MUHAMMAD –68\nthese elements by any specific mode of proof. See id. The State could prove these\n\nelements in a number of different ways, including documentary proof that contained\n\nsufficient evidence to establish them. See id. at 921-92. The trier of fact looks at the\n\ntotality of the admitted evidence to determine if these two elements are proven. Id. at\n\n923.\n\n       In this case, the record reflects that State’s Exhibits 172 and 173 were certified\n\ncopies of judgments and court records in consecutive case numbers reflecting that\n\nsomeone with appellant’s name, date of birth, address, and physical description was\n\nconvicted of burglary of a vehicle and evading arrest. The offense dates were the same\n\nand the judgments were entered on the same date. Exhibit 172, the judgment pertaining\n\nto burglary of a vehicle, contained appellant’s fingerprints, but Exhibit 173, which\n\npertained to a conviction for evading arrest, did not. Considering the totality of the\n\nevidence, the fact finder could view the identifying information contained in State’s\n\nExhibit 173 in conjunction with the identical identifying information in Exhibit 172, plus\n\nthe additional fingerprint evidence contained in that exhibit, and determine that a prior\n\nconviction for evading arrest existed and that appellant was the person convicted. See id.\n\nat 923-24. Point of error twenty-nine is overruled.\n\n       In point of error thirty, appellant asserts that the trial court erroneously overruled\n\nhis objection that Officer Chris Havens testified from a document not in evidence. In\n\npoint of error thirty-one, appellant complains that the trial court erred when it allowed\n\nHavens to testify to appellant’s personal identifying characteristics after the State\n\f                                                                             MUHAMMAD –69\nimproperly refreshed Havens’s recollection with a police report made by a third party.\n\nAppellant states that defense counsel’s objection “was continuously overruled.”\n\nAppellant briefs these points together.\n\n       Appellant refers to Havens by name, but he provides a record cite to Dallas Police\n\nLieutenant Harold Andrews’s testimony. On this basis, we could reject this claim as\n\ninadequately briefed. T EX. R. A PP. P. 38.1. In the interests of justice, however, we will\n\naddress it on the merits.\n\n       We infer from our comparison of appellant’s brief to the trial record that appellant\n\nintends to challenge the admission of Andrews’s testimony rather than Havens’s\n\ntestimony. We draw this inference because the record of Havens’s testimony does not\n\nsupport appellant’s assertion that defense counsel’s objections were “continuously\n\noverruled,” but the record arguably does support appellant’s assertion that his objections\n\nto Andrews’s testimony were “continuously overruled.”\n\n       The record reflects that Andrews reviewed the police report of the extraneous\n\noffense in question before he testified. Andrews testified that he remembered hearing a\n\ncall to respond to a burglary of a vehicle at about 4:00 a.m. on July 27, 1994. Andrews\n\npersonally did not respond to the scene of the burglary. Rather, he heard the description\n\nof the suspects and, based on that description, he looked for suspects in the area. He\n\n“found Mr. Muhammad” and took him back to the scene of the offense, where one of the\n\ncomplainants identified him.\n\n       Andrews testified that the officers who responded to the scene prepared the written\n\f                                                                            MUHAMMAD –70\npolice report. However, Andrews also testified that he would have asked the suspect for\n\nhis name and date of birth when he detained him because that was “standard procedure.”\n\nThe prosecutor asked Andrews if he “remember[ed] the identifying information on Mr.\n\nMuhammad.” Andrews responded that he remembered that the suspect was fifteen years\n\nold and his name was Naim Muhammad, but other than that, Andrews did not recall the\n\ndetails. The prosecutor invited Andrews to refresh his memory by reviewing the police\n\nreport and then asked:\n\n       Q. Does it have a date of birth for that?\n\n       A. 5-3 of 1979.\n\n       Q. Is he a black or white male?\n\n       A. He is a black male.\n\n       At that point, defense counsel objected that Andrews was testifying from a report\n\nthat was not in evidence. The trial court ruled that the witness could refresh his memory\n\nand testify. Counsel then stated that Andrews’s testimony was admissible only if the\n\nreport refreshed his memory and did not provide him with information: “If he just reads\n\nit and he says that’s what it says, that is not refreshed testimony, Judge.” Defense counsel\n\nthen took Andrews on voir dire. Counsel asked Andrews whether, at the time of trial, he\n\nhad personal knowledge of the information contained in the report. Andrews responded\n\nthat he did not understand the question.\n\n       Defense counsel then posed a question that involved a double negative: “Other\n\nthan reading and right now saying what the document says, there is no way it is not going\n\f                                                                             MUHAMMAD –71\nto refresh your actual recollection so that you can state independently that information\n\ncontained on that document is accurate, can you?” Andrews’s one-word answer,\n\n“Correct,” did not resolve the matter of whether the document refreshed his recollection\n\nor, alternatively, provided him with new information.\n\n       After this exchange, counsel renewed his objection, but he did not obtain a new\n\nruling. The prosecutor then resumed her questioning. She asked Andrews if he obtained\n\nthe suspect’s name when he detained him. Andrews reiterated that he did not recall\n\nspecifically, but he was sure that he had done so, because “[t]hat’s just standard\n\nprocedure.” The prosecutor again asked Andrews if he had reviewed the report and if he\n\nknew that the person he detained was Naim Muhammad. The defense again took\n\nAndrews on voir dire, leading to the following exchange:\n\n       Q. Officer, other than the fact that your testimony to this jury so far has\n       been you were called to the scene, you snatched up the fellow, you carried\n       him back and you dropped him off. That’s, basically the extent of your\n       involvement in this incident, is it not?\n\n       A. More or less.\n\n                                            ***\n\n       A. I’m sure when I first approached him I got his name and date of birth,\n       that kind of information from him. I do that with everyone that I come in\n       contact with.\n\n       Q. There is nothing in these documents that are before you, at this point in\n       time, there is not a single document here that you prepared this? [sic]\n\n       A. That I actually wrote, no, sir.\n\n       Q. Right. And so, they are not even asking you to refresh your recollection\n\f                                                                               MUHAMMAD –72\n       from a document that you prepared. They are asking you to refresh your\n       recollection from a document that somebody else prepared?\n\n       A. Yes, sir.\n\nCounsel again objected, and his objection was overruled. The prosecutor then continued\n\nher direct examination, again eliciting Andrews’s testimony that he collected information\n\nabout the suspect, including his name and date of birth. Defense counsel again objected,\n\narguing that Andrews lacked personal knowledge of the answers to the prosecutor’s\n\nquestions. The court overruled the objection, and defense counsel again took Andrews on\n\nvoir dire:\n\n       Q. Is there anything on that document, sir, that you prepared?\n\n       A. No, sir.\n\n       Q. Is there anything on that document, sir, that was prepared at your\n       direction or in your presence?\n\n       A. At my direction?\n\n       Q. Or in your presence.\n\n       A.

The prosecutor responded that it was appropriate for\n\nAndrews to refresh his memory by reviewing the police report “because he was there that\n\nday.” Defense counsel argued that it was improper for a witness to refresh his\n\nrecollection from a document that was not prepared in the witness’s presence or at his\n\ndirection. The trial court overruled the objection and granted defense counsel a running\n\nobjection to Andrews’s testimony. The prosecutor again elicited Andrews’s testimony\n\nnaming the suspect as Naim Muhammad and providing his date of birth as May 3, 1979.\n\n       Regardless of whether the prosecutor properly used the police report to refresh\n\nAndrews’s recollection, Andrews had already testified to the suspect’s name and date of\n\nbirth before defense counsel made his initial objection. As to this portion of Andrews’s\n\ntestimony, counsel’s belated objection did not preserve error. See T EX. R. A PP. P. 33.1;\n\nLagrone v.

Moreover, even if we assume that the trial court erred by overruling\n\nappellant’s subsequent objections, appellant cannot show that the trial court reversibly\n\nerred because the same information – the suspect’s name and date of birth – was already\n\nbefore the jury. See Coble, 330 S.W.3d at 282. Points of error thirty and thirty-one are\n\noverruled.\n\n       In point of error thirty-two, appellant complains that the trial court erroneously\n\noverruled his objection that Garland Police Officer Brandon Hernandez did not have\n\npersonal knowledge of the information he provided during his testimony because he read\n\nthe information from a report. Appellant avers that the prosecutor did not properly use\n\nthe writings to refresh Hernandez’s recollection. Specifically, appellant contends that the\n\nprosecutor had Hernandez testify from a document that was not in evidence in order to\n\nenter otherwise inadmissible information into evidence.\n\n       Hernandez’s testimony provided an account of his and other officers’ response to a\n\nburglary alarm at 3:30 a.m. on July 4, 1999. When police officers responded to the scene,\n\nthey discovered a car parked in a cul-de-sac with its headlights turned off and its engine\n\nrunning. The car sped away as an officer approached it. Officers pursued and stopped\n\nthe car. They discovered a loaded shotgun and a screwdriver in the car, as well as a bag\n\nof marijuana outside the car that appeared to have been thrown from the car. All three of\n\nthe car’s occupants were arrested. One of the car’s occupants identified himself as Naim\n\f                                                                               MUHAMMAD –75\nMuhammad. He provided a birth date that enabled officers to confirm his identity against\n\npolice records.\n\n       Defense counsel then objected that Hernandez’s testimony was hearsay. The trial\n\ncourt overruled the objection and allowed defense counsel to voir dire Hernandez, who\n\nacknowledged that he did not recall whether he personally had interviewed appellant and\n\nverified his identifying information against police records. Counsel then objected that\n\nHernandez lacked personal knowledge of the events about which he had testified. The\n\ntrial court overruled the objection. On cross-examination, defense counsel elicited\n\nHernandez’s testimony that appellant had been a passenger in the back seat of the car.\n\n       Whether or not the prosecutor properly used the police report to refresh\n\nHernandez’s memory, appellant’s belated objection did not preserve error. See T EX. R.\n\nA PP. P. 33.1; Lagrone, 942 S.W.2d at 618. Point of error thirty-two is overruled.\n\n       In point of error thirty-three, appellant asserts that the trial court erroneously\n\noverruled his objection to the testimony of Dallas Police Officer David Solomon\n\nconcerning the circumstances under which he arrested appellant. Appellant appears to\n\nargue that Solomon’s reference to a suspected attempted automobile theft was prejudicial\n\nbecause appellant was cleared of any involvement in that offense.\n\n       Solomon’s testimony was offered to connect appellant to a burglary of a habitation\n\noffense that had been described in previous testimony. Solomon referred to the attempted\n\nautomobile theft in the course of explaining how and why he arrested appellant for the\n\nburglary. Specifically, Solomon testified that he stopped the car in which appellant was\n\f                                                                              MUHAMMAD –76\nriding after a witness informed Solomon that the car resembled one that was observed\n\nduring an attempted automobile theft. Based on the witness’s statement, Solomon\n\ndetained appellant and the car’s other occupants, but all of them were cleared of any\n\ninvolvement in the attempted automobile theft. However, Solomon discovered that\n\nappellant had outstanding warrants for burglary and arrested him on that basis.\n\n       Assuming without deciding that the trial court erred in admitting Solomon’s\n\ntestimony concerning the attempted automobile theft, appellant was not harmed. See\n\nCoble, 330 S.W.3d at 280 (noting that if the improperly admitted evidence did not\n\ninfluence the jury or had but a slight effect upon its deliberations, such non-constitutional\n\nerror is harmless). Solomon testified that appellant was cleared of any involvement in\n\nthat offense. Further, the trial court included in the written jury charge an instruction that\n\nthe jury could consider extraneous offenses only if the offenses had been proven beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt:\n\n       You are instructed that if there is any evidence before you in this case\n       regarding the Defendant having committed an offense or offenses other\n       than the offense alleged against him in the indictment, you cannot consider\n       this evidence for any purpose unless you find and believe beyond a\n       reasonable doubt that the Defendant committed such other offenses, if any\n       were committed, and even then you may only consider the same in\n       determining the answers to the special issues.\n\nWe presume that the jury followed this instruction. See Coble, 330 S.W.3d at 292.\n\nSolomon’s testimony concerning the attempted automobile theft did not prove beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt that the offense was committed and that appellant committed it; rather,\n\nSolomon expressly stated that appellant was cleared of any involvement. Therefore, we\n\f                                                                                 MUHAMMAD –77\npresume that the jury disregarded this evidence. We conclude that any error did not\n\ninfluence the jury or had but a slight effect. See id. at 280. Point of error thirty-three is\n\noverruled.\n\n       In point of error thirty-four, appellant asserts that the trial court erroneously\n\noverruled appellant’s objection that Warden Melody Nelson’s10 testimony about the types\n\nof weapons found in prison was not particularized to appellant. He avers that Nelson’s\n\ntestimony and the display of weapons before the jury were not relevant because the\n\ndefense had not called anyone to testify about prison conditions and so the State had no\n\nreason to offer general testimony about acts committed by other inmates. He also\n\ncomplains that Nelson’s testimony and the weapons display “could only be based on\n\nhearsay.” He argues that admitting this evidence denied him a fair trial in violation of his\n\nright to due process.\n\n       At trial, defense counsel objected that Nelson’s testimony describing the types of\n\nobjects that could be made into weapons was not relevant because there had been no\n\nshowing of any nexus between that testimony and appellant. The prosecutor responded\n\nthat the jury should be allowed to understand what the prison system was like; he clarified\n\nthat he was not saying that appellant made the weapons. The trial court overruled the\n\nobjection. Nelson continued to testify, describing additional items that could be made\n\ninto weapons. Nelson showed the jury some weapons that had been found in prisons.\n\n\n       10\n           The State’s appellate brief lists Warden Nelson’s first name as “Melodye,” but the\nreporter’s record lists it as “Melody.” We adopt the court reporter’s spelling.\n\f                                                                               MUHAMMAD –78\nDefense counsel did not specifically object to this display.\n\n       Appellant did not preserve his hearsay complaint because he did not object to\n\nNelson’s testimony on this basis at trial. T EX. R. A PP. P. 33.1. Further, to the extent that\n\nhe attempts to add a specific complaint about the weapons display, he did not preserve\n\nthis complaint with a trial objection. Cf. Roberts v.

Therefore, we consider only\n\nappellant’s complaint that Nelson’s testimony about weapons in prisons was not relevant\n\nbecause it was not connected to appellant.\n\n       Nelson’s testimony described the conditions that appellant would face if he were\n\nsentenced to life in prison, including the potential for violence. Her testimony, including\n\nher description of weapons that inmates had made, was relevant because it informed the\n\njury’s assessment of the probability that appellant would commit acts of violence in\n\nprison society. See Coble, 330 S.W.3d at 269. The trial court did not abuse its discretion\n\nby admitting Nelson’s testimony. Point of error thirty-four is overruled.\n\n       In point of error thirty-five, appellant complains that the trial court erroneously\n\ndenied his motion for a hearing to make a threshold inquiry into whether the State could\n\npresent sufficient evidence of extraneous offenses and bad acts before allowing the State\n\f                                                                                   MUHAMMAD –79\nto present such evidence to the jury. Specifically, appellant complains that, if the trial\n\ncourt had determined the threshold admissibility of extraneous-offense evidence before\n\nallowing the State to present it to the jury, the trial errors raised in points of error forty-\n\ntwo, forty-three, and forty-four would have been prevented.11\n\n       Appellant further argues that the court’s refusal to make a preliminary\n\nadmissibility determination resulted in prejudice because the State presented testimony\n\nfrom police officers who made unsubstantiated allegations of appellant’s bad conduct.\n\nHe asserts that the trial court’s refusal to exclude the State’s “anecdotal” and “minimal”\n\nevidence of extraneous bad acts resulted in “a series of repetitive errors on the State’s . . .\n\nattempted use of improper extraneous evidence.”\n\n       The record reflects that, during a pre-trial discussion of appellant’s “Motion for a\n\nPre-Trial Hearing as to the Admissibility of Each Extraneous Offense o[r] Bad Act,”\n\nappellant expressly asked the trial court to carry his motion for a pre-trial hearing until a\n\nlater time. Defense counsel stated, “If the State is intending to offer anything other than\n\nlive witnesses, we have some confrontation issues and some Crawford 12 issues that would\n\ncertainly apply to the State’s intent to offer [proof of extraneous acts] by way of a\n\nbusiness record.” However, in light of the prosecutor’s stated intent to present\n\n\n\n\n       11\n          Points of error forty-two, forty-three, and forty-four concern the sufficiency of the\nfuture-dangerousness evidence and the constitutionality of Article 37.071. We suspect that\nappellant did not intend to refer to these points of error, but we decline to speculate.\n       12\n            Crawford v.

Thus, to the extent that appellant complains about the trial court’s pre-trial handling\n\nof his motion, he did not preserve error, and he is estopped from seeking appellate relief.\n\nSee T EX. R.

See Moore, 700 S.W.2d at 205. The court acted within\n\nthis discretion when it denied appellant’s motion to hold a separate hearing before the\n\npunishment phase.\n\n       After several State’s witnesses testified about extraneous offenses and bad acts\n\nduring the State’s punishment case-in-chief, the trial court held another hearing outside\n\nthe jury’s presence on appellant’s motion. Defense counsel argued that, by presenting\n\nthese witnesses, the State had offered evidence that was not admissible against appellant.\n\nCounsel complained that the testimony of police officers who did not independently recall\n\nevents, but who reviewed arrest reports and then testified about the contents of those\n\nreports, was inadmissible because such testimony was not evidence that would lead a jury\n\nto find someone guilty of the alleged extraneous offenses beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nCounsel also argued that testimony merely referring to the arrest report for the suspect’s\n\nname and date of birth – which were the same as appellant’s – was insufficient to tie\n\nappellant to those offenses. The trial court disagreed and again denied appellant’s request\n\nfor a threshold hearing on extraneous-offense evidence. The trial court instructed the\n\nState to “tie up” extraneous-offense testimony in which appellant had not been identified\n\nas a suspect, but the court also ruled that, with respect to the extraneous-offense evidence\n\nthat had already been presented to the jury, the State had made a clear showing as\n\nrequired by law.\n\n       The trial court acted within its discretion by declining to hold a threshold hearing.\n\f                                                                               MUHAMMAD –83\nSee Fuller, 829 S.W.2d at 198 (“[A] trial judge cannot err in most cases by overruling a\n\nrelevancy objection so long as the challenged evidence might be ‘connected up’ before\n\nthe end of trial.”). The court’s determination that the State’s evidence clearly proved that\n\nthe offenses were committed and that appellant was the perpetrator was also within the\n\nzone of reasonable disagreement. See id. at 197 (finding no error when trial court\n\noverruled relevancy objection “pending the fact that” the prosecutor would introduce\n\nevidence sufficient to fulfill a condition of fact; “Clearly, the parties must be allowed to\n\ndevelop their cases one step at a time.”).\n\n       Defense counsel re-urged the motion again after additional State’s witnesses\n\ntestified about extraneous offenses. Counsel argued that, by having officers with no\n\nindependent recollection of events testify from arrest reports, the State was effectively\n\nproving up extraneous offenses through business records. Counsel complained\n\nspecifically of the extraneous-offense testimony of one police officer who acknowledged\n\nthat he had no independent recollection of events even after reviewing the arrest report.\n\nDefense counsel asserted that such testimony was not competent evidence. The trial court\n\nexpressed the view that the complained-of witness had been unprepared, but the court\n\ndeclined to instruct the jury that any previously presented extraneous-offense testimony\n\nwas not competent evidence.\n\n       The trial court did, however, grant appellant part of the relief he requested in his\n\nmotion. Before the State presented any additional extraneous-bad-act evidence, the court\n\ninstructed the jurors orally that, if they did not believe that the evidence of an offense\n\f                                                                               MUHAMMAD –84\nproved beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense had been committed and that appellant\n\ncommitted it, then they should not consider the evidence for any purpose. As noted in\n\npoint of error thirty-three, the court also provided a similar instruction in the written jury\n\ncharge.\n\n       Other than his broad assertions that the State’s witnesses’ testimony concerning\n\nappellant’s bad acts was “anecdotal, minimal,” and unsubstantiated, appellant does not\n\nexplain how or why this testimony was inadmissible. We decline to make his argument\n\nfor him. See T EX. R. A PP. P. 38.1; Ladd, 3 S.W.3d at 574. Further, by giving the\n\nrequested jury instructions, the trial court provided a safeguard against the possibility that\n\nthe jurors would consider extraneous-offense evidence even if they did not believe that\n\nthe evidence clearly proved the offense and appellant’s commission of it. Appellant has\n\nnot overcome the presumption that the jury followed the trial court’s oral and written\n\ninstructions. See Gamboa v.

Point\n\nof error thirty-five is overruled.\n\n       In point of error thirty-six, appellant complains that the trial court erroneously\n\noverruled his motion for a mistrial after the prosecutor presented a witness to testify about\n\nan extraneous bad act but then withdrew the witness’s testimony after appellant objected\n\nto the lack of notice.\n\n       The record reflects that the prosecutor called Officer Ryan Swain to testify that on\n\nJuly 18, 2010, while responding to a call about a suspicious person, he encountered\n\nappellant. Defense counsel objected that the offense about which Swain would testify\n\f                                                                              MUHAMMAD –85\nhad been omitted from the State’s Rule 404(b) notice. After reviewing the notice, the\n\nprosecutor confirmed that the State had not given notice of the offense at issue and agreed\n\nthat the State would not present any more testimony from Swain. Defense counsel\n\ncomplained that Swain’s incomplete testimony would cause the jury to speculate about\n\nappellant’s bad conduct that led to the suspicious-person call. Counsel asked the trial\n\ncourt to instruct the jury that it should not consider any of Swain’s statements for any\n\npurpose. Counsel also asked for a mistrial. The trial court instructed the jury to disregard\n\nSwain’s testimony, but overruled the request for a mistrial.\n\n       The trial court’s instruction to disregard Swain’s testimony was sufficient to cure\n\nany harm.

Further, the written jury charge instructed the\n\njury to disregard any extraneous-offense evidence that did not prove the offense beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt, and we presume that the jury followed this instruction. See Gamboa,\n\n296 S.W.3d at 580. Given the evidence of appellant’s other extraneous offenses, the trial\n\ncourt’s instruction to disregard, and the inconsequential nature of Swain’s testimony, the\n\ntrial court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant’s motion for a mistrial. Point\n\nof error thirty-six is overruled.\n\n       In point of error thirty-seven, appellant asserts, “The trial court erred in overruling\n\nappellant’s objection that the State was allowed to present evidence that an arrest of\n\nappellant was based on a warrant for an alleged burglary of a motor vehicle that he was\n\nnot involved. [sic]” We surmise that this point of error is a restatement of point of error\n\nthirty-three. Appellant excerpts part of the record of Solomon’s testimony during which\n\f                                                                               MUHAMMAD –86\ndefense counsel objected that the State failed to give the defense proper notice under Rule\n\n404(b). Appellant then cites two non-capital cases in support of his assertion that the jury\n\ncould not find beyond a reasonable doubt that he committed the extraneous offense.\n\nFinally, appellant submits that the trial court erred in admitting this evidence and that the\n\nerror had a substantial or injurious effect on the punishment verdict. Because appellant\n\ndoes not apply the law to the facts of the case, we reject this point of error as inadequately\n\nbriefed. See T EX. R. A PP. P. 38.1; see also Linney v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">413</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">766</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 767-68 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 2013). Point of error thirty-seven is overruled.\n\n       In points of error thirty-eight and thirty-nine, appellant complains that the trial\n\ncourt’s erroneous rulings allowed the State to cross-examine two testifying mental-heath\n\nexperts on matters outside their expertise. In point of error thirty-eight, appellant asserts\n\nthat the trial court erroneously overruled his objection to the State’s cross-examining Dr.\n\nKelly Gray-Smith about her opinion that appellant had antisocial personality disorder\n\n(“ASPD”). In point of error thirty-nine, appellant asserts that the trial court erroneously\n\noverruled his objection to the State’s cross-examining Dr. Gilbert Martinez about the\n\nsymptoms of ASPD.\n\n       Appellant briefs points of error thirty-eight and thirty-nine together. He argues\n\nthat the trial court’s rulings permitted the State to require defense witnesses on cross-\n\nexamination to testify “beyond the scope” of their “expertise or engagement for the case\n\nat bar.” He complains that the State was allowed to convert the witnesses into State’s\n\nwitnesses by eliciting opinions or information that appellant “had all the criteria for a\n\f                                                                            MUHAMMAD –87\ndiagnosis of Anti Personality Disorder [sic] in order to convince the jury that he was a\n\nfuture danger.”\n\n       The record reflects that Martinez testified before Gray-Smith. Martinez informed\n\nthe jury that he was a clinical neuropsychologist who evaluated the mental functioning of\n\npeople suspected of having neurological disorders. Typically, he evaluated and treated\n\npeople with head injuries or strokes. In this case, he “conduct[ed] a neuropsychological\n\nexamination of [appellant’s] intelligence and what’s called his cognitive functioning; in\n\nother words, his mental functioning, his memory, attention, reasoning and judgment and\n\nso forth.” In addition to reviewing appellant’s academic, juvenile, and medical records,\n\nMartinez met with appellant for five hours to conduct an interview and administer a\n\nbattery of psychological tests.\n\n       Based on the results of this examination, Martinez diagnosed appellant with a\n\n“mild neurocognitive disorder,” which could interfere with a person’s thinking,\n\nreasoning, impulse control, and inhibition. Martinez testified that a person with this\n\ndisorder might have deficits in behavioral and emotional control, as well as problems\n\nunderstanding social situations. Martinez also diagnosed appellant with borderline\n\nintellectual functioning. He noted that appellant’s history revealed “Epilepsy, Possible\n\nConcussion/Mild Head Injury reported in 2009, and Head Injury, auto crash in 1983.”\n\nMartinez observed that the medication used to treat epilepsy could contribute to cognitive\n\ndeficits. Prolonged drug abuse could also contribute to intellectual and executive-\n\nfunctioning deficits.\n\f                                                                               MUHAMMAD –88\n       During cross-examination, Martinez acknowledged that he was not certain that\n\nappellant had a brain injury, but he noted that appellant’s test scores were “highly\n\nconsistent” with a childhood brain injury. Martinez also acknowledged that\n\n“[i]mpulsivity is one of the diagnostic criteria for antisocial personality disorder,” as is “a\n\nfailure to conform to society’s norms and general rules and regulations of society.”\n\nMartinez further acknowledged that a history of lying or conning people for personal gain\n\nor pleasure, and difficulty planning ahead, could also be symptoms of ASPD.\n\n       Defense counsel then objected that “[a]ll of these questions here are clearly outside\n\nof the referral question,” and that Martinez had “not been asked to do any kind of\n\npsychological assessment in regards to any ASPD factors.” Counsel asserted that\n\nMartinez was asked to evaluate and testify specifically concerning appellant’s cognitive\n\ndeficits. The prosecutor responded that Martinez “made an Axis II diagnosis and that\n\nincluded antisocial personality disorder.” The trial court overruled the objection.\n\n       The prosecutor went on to note that, as part of Martinez’s evaluation of appellant,\n\nMartinez had reviewed a 1994 psychological report that included a diagnosis of conduct\n\ndisorder. The prosecutor asked Martinez if that was “the same as a sociopath.” Martinez\n\ndeclined to answer, saying that he was not an expert in ASPD and he did not want to give\n\nan opinion outside his area of expertise. The prosecutor continued to press Martinez for\n\nan opinion as to whether appellant had ASPD, but Martinez repeatedly declined to\n\nprovide one. Martinez explained that, in order to diagnose someone with ASPD, he\n\nwould have conducted a different type of assessment that included administering\n\f                                                                             MUHAMMAD –89\npersonality tests and psychological tests “that look at that.” In this case, Martinez had\n\n“only administered cognitive and intelligence tests.”\n\n       On redirect, defense counsel elicited Martinez’s testimony emphasizing that his\n\narea of expertise did not include personality disorders and that his diagnosis was limited\n\nto appellant’s intellectual and cognitive functioning. Martinez observed that some of the\n\ntraits that the prosecutor associated with personality disorders were also associated with\n\ncognitive deficits.\n\n       Appellant failed to preserve his complaint concerning the testimony in which\n\nMartinez generally acknowledged some of the diagnostic criteria for ASPD because\n\ndefense counsel did not object until after the prosecutor elicited this testimony. See T EX.\n\nR. A PP. P. 33.1. After defense counsel objected, Martinez repeatedly declined to give an\n\nopinion as to whether appellant had ASPD. Therefore, with respect to the part of\n\nappellant’s complaint that was preserved by objection, Martinez did not testify outside his\n\narea of expertise. Point of error thirty-nine is overruled.\n\n       Later, Gray-Smith, a psychologist with a specialty in school psychology, testified\n\nabout chronic academic failure and emotional disturbance in children. She observed that\n\nthe “externalizing behaviors” that often arise from emotional or academic disabilities can\n\nbe mislabeled as choice-based “bad behavior,” with the result that a child who has such\n\ndisabilities and exhibits such behavior does not receive appropriate support and\n\nintervention. Without such support, the child does not learn coping skills and is unable to\n\nregulate his emotions and respond to stressful situations “in a controlled way.” Such a\n\f                                                                           MUHAMMAD –90\nchild is likely to exhibit chronic academic and behavioral problems.\n\n       Gray-Smith had reviewed a number of appellant’s records in forming her opinion\n\nand preparing her report. These included appellant’s school records, which she said\n\nreflected very early academic failure and no effective intervention. Although appellant’s\n\nschool records from fourth and fifth grades included a mention of special education,\n\nGray-Smith opined that, based on appellant’s early poor performance, the school should\n\nhave provided him with help in the first or second grade. She noted that appellant’s\n\nschool records showed that his behavioral and academic problems worsened after sixth\n\ngrade, but he received no intervention.\n\n       Gray-Smith explained that if a child had behavioral problems but received no\n\nintervention before he was nine years old, his prognosis would be very poor with respect\n\nto preventing adolescent behavioral problems. Beyond the age of nine, a child’s\n\nbehavioral problems would be classified as a conduct disorder and generally result in\n\nsuspension or expulsion. Such disciplinary actions would disconnect the child from his\n\nschool and important sources of help and support. In addition, a child whose school\n\nrecords indicated that he had oppositional defiant disorder and whose juvenile records\n\nincluded a diagnosis of conduct disorder, but who received no intervention, would\n\ntypically be diagnosed with ASPD as an adult. Gray-Smith testified that such a person\n\nwould likely end up unemployed or in jail.\n\n       On cross-examination, Gray-Smith acknowledged that most children with chronic\n\nschool failures do not go on to commit violent offenses such as capital murder. The\n\f                                                                            MUHAMMAD –91\nprosecutor noted that Gray-Smith concluded “throughout [her] report” that appellant had\n\nASPD, and Gray-Smith agreed with that characterization. She declined to say that she\n\nhad diagnosed appellant with ASPD, but she acknowledged that she had formed an\n\nopinion. She stated that she was familiar with behavioral disorders. Based on appellant’s\n\nprior conduct-disorder diagnosis and his other criminal offenses, Gray-Smith believed\n\nthat appellant had ASPD.\n\n       On redirect, Gray-Smith elaborated on the difference between a diagnosis and an\n\nopinion. She stated that the psychologists’ licensing act and ethical guidelines mandated\n\nthat a psychologist should not go beyond his or her area of expertise in making a\n\ndiagnosis, even if he or she might form an opinion. She also stated that a great majority\n\nof inmates in the penitentiary have the traits of ASPD, so an opinion that a person has\n\nASPD is not a meaningful predictor of his future dangerousness in prison.\n\n       On recross, the State asked Gray-Smith about the symptoms of ASPD listed in the\n\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - Fourth Edition (“DSM-IV”).\n\nGray-Smith acknowledged that people with ASPD typically “have a reckless disregard for\n\nthe safety of others.” After the prosecutor asked Gray-Smith whether a failure to conform\n\nto norms was also characteristic of a person with ASPD, defense counsel objected that the\n\nprosecutor was improperly attempting to associate all of the specific symptoms of ASPD\n\nto appellant, when Gray-Smith had not interviewed or examined appellant and could not\n\nattribute specific traits to him. The prosecutor responded that Gray-Smith could discuss\n\nthe symptoms of ASPD because she had given an opinion that appellant had ASPD. The\n\f                                                                             MUHAMMAD –92\ntrial court overruled the objection.\n\n       The prosecutor then asked generally whether a person with ASPD would: have\n\ndifficulty conforming to social norms and rules; lie in order to get what he wanted; be\n\nimpulsive; and fail to plan ahead. Gray-Smith stated that a person with ASPD would\n\nhave some of those symptoms but not necessarily all of them. The prosecutor continued\n\nlisting the criteria for ASPD, and Gray-Smith continued acknowledging that they were\n\ntraits typical of ASPD: aggression and repeated fights or acts of violence; inability or\n\nunwillingness to meet continuing obligations and responsibilities; inability or\n\nunwillingness to show remorse; rationalizing harm caused to others; violating others’\n\nrights; and a diagnosis of conduct disorder before the age of fifteen.\n\n       Appellant did not object to Gray-Smith’s ASPD testimony until after she had\n\nopined that appellant had ASPD and acknowledged that one of the traits identified by the\n\nprosecutor was typical of ASPD. See T EX. R. A PP. P. 33.1; see also Luna v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1488102\"><a href=\"/opinion/1488102/luna-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">268</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">594</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 604 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008). Further, appellant’s trial objection – that Gray-\n\nSmith had not interviewed or examined appellant and therefore could not specifically\n\nattribute particular traits of ASPD to him – does not comport with his complaint on\n\nappeal, which is that Gray-Smith testified outside her area of expertise. See T EX. R. A PP.\n\nP. 33.1; see also Gallo, 239 S.W.3d at 768. Therefore, appellant did not preserve this\n\nportion of his argument.\n\n       To the extent that appellant argues that Gray-Smith’s testimony that appellant met\n\nall the criteria for ASPD went beyond the scope of her pretrial preparations, his argument\n\f                                                                             MUHAMMAD –93\nfails to state a claim for relief. Appellant mischaracterizes Gray-Smith’s testimony\n\nbecause Gray-Smith did not expressly attribute particular ASPD traits to appellant.\n\nInstead, she testified generally about the traits of a person with ASPD. See, e.g., Tillman\n\nv. State, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">354</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">425</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 439-40 (Tex. Crim.

Gray-Smith properly could testify beyond the scope of her pretrial\n\npreparations. See id. (observing that Rule of Evidence 703 permits an expert to base her\n\nopinion testimony on the data and facts made known to her during trial). Point of error\n\nthirty-eight is overruled.\n\n       In point of error forty, appellant asserts that the trial judge improperly commented\n\non the weight of the evidence when he admonished the jury concerning overnight\n\nsequestration. Appellant states that the court’s comment that jurors should bring\n\novernight bags with them the following morning, although they probably would not need\n\nthem, may have led the jury to infer the judge’s opinion of the merits of the case.\n\nAppellant also asserts that the comment “indirectly coerced [jurors] through the threat of\n\nsequestration away from their homes and family to reach a verdict before the end of the\n\nday,” and denied him due process and a fair trial by a fair jury. He argues that, because\n\nthe jury returned a sentence of death, the alleged error was not harmless beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.\n\n       The record reflects that, at the end of the presentation of evidence on May 22,\n\f                                                                               MUHAMMAD –94\n2013, the trial court released the jury for the day. The judge explained that it was almost\n\n3:00 p.m. and that he would keep the jury together once they started deliberations. Rather\n\nthan providing the jury charge and beginning closing arguments that afternoon, the court\n\nwould be in recess until the jury returned at 9:00 the next morning. Defense counsel then\n\nreminded the judge about the “future instructions,” which prompted the judge to inform\n\njurors that the bailiff would give them some instructions before they left for the day:\n\n       I’ve asked [the bailiff] to have you, in the morning, bring with you a change\n       of clothes just in case. I don’t think you are going to need it, but just in case\n       you do not finish your deliberations tomorrow, then I will have to sequester\n       you as long as you are in deliberations, or before you return to court with a\n       verdict on punishment, then I will have to keep y’all together. And so – just\n       bring a change of clothes with you.\n\n       Defense counsel requested a mistrial, stating that the court had commented on the\n\nweight of the evidence by indicating to the jury “that there is nothing in this case worthy\n\nof a deliberate process on it.” Counsel added, “we are prejudiced beyond belief that the\n\nCourt would make that comment in front of the jury.” The trial judge disagreed with\n\ncounsel’s view that his statement was a comment on the weight of the evidence; rather,\n\nthe judge stated that he had explained to the jurors that he was planning to resume the\n\ncase in the morning so that they would have a full day to deliberate, but if they did not\n\nreach a verdict, then they would be prepared for sequestration. The court denied the\n\nmotion for mistrial.\n\n       We need not address the merits of appellant’s current argument that the jury was\n\nindirectly coerced through the threat of sequestration because this argument does not\n\f                                                                             MUHAMMAD –95\ncomport with the basis for appellant’s motion for mistrial. See T EX. R. A PP. P. 33.1; see\n\nalso Gallo, 239 S.W.3d at 768. With respect to appellant’s argument that the judge’s\n\nstatement was a comment on the weight of the evidence that warranted a mistrial, we note\n\nthat a trial judge is prohibited from conveying to the jury his personal opinion as to the\n\ntruth or falsity of any evidence. See Russell v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2468536\"><a href=\"/opinion/2468536/russell-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">749</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">77</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 78 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n1988). In this case, however, the trial judge’s comment did not convey such an opinion.\n\nThe comment conveyed an opinion that the jury probably would not need more than a day\n\nin which to deliberate and resolve the punishment special issues, but the comment did not\n\nfavor either party or single out any particular evidence for the jury’s consideration.\n\nFurther, the comment did not direct the jurors to resolve the special issues quickly.\n\nRather, the comment advised jurors to bring a change of clothes, and, thus, clearly\n\ncontemplated that they might deliberate for longer than one day.\n\n       Assuming for the sake of argument that the trial judge’s statement was an\n\nimproper comment on the weight of the evidence, appellant has not shown reversible\n\nerror. We afford great deference to the trial judge’s decision as to whether a comment on\n\nthe weight of the evidence warrants a mistrial. See Pierson v.

When the\n\njurors returned to the courtroom the following morning, the trial court instructed them\n\nthat it would be improper for them to arrive at their answers to the special issues by any\n\nmethod other than a full, fair, and free exchange of opinions. They were also instructed\n\nthat they should deliberate for as long as they felt was necessary to arrive at their answers\n\nto the special issues. Jury instructions should be presumed effective, absent evidence that\n\nthe jury did not follow them. Gamboa, 296 S.W.3d at 580. Appellant has identified no\n\nsuch evidence, and we have found none in our independent review of the record. Point of\n\nerror forty is overruled.\n\n       In point of error forty-one, appellant asserts that the trial court erroneously\n\noverruled his objection that the State argued outside of the record during closing\n\nargument. Specifically, in the State’s final closing argument, the prosecutor drew\n\nparallels between Kametra’s life and the life of Maya Angelou. The prosecutor advised\n\nthe jury that Angelou was raped when she was eight years old, had a child when she was\n\nseventeen, and was once “a full-grown madam, running a brothel.” The prosecutor noted\n\f                                                                            MUHAMMAD –97\nthat Angelou arose from these circumstances to become “Poet Laureate.” From this, the\n\nState argued that Kametra could also change her life and “be anything she wants to.” The\n\ntrial court overruled defense counsel’s repeated objections that this argument was outside\n\nthe record and injected facts not in evidence. Finally, when counsel objected that the\n\nprosecutor could not “argue the life history of people,” the court admonished the\n\nprosecutor to “[a]rgue the evidence and the law.”\n\n       Appellant complains that the prosecutor’s introduction of information about\n\nAngelou’s life history was “obviously presented to inflame the minds of the jury with\n\nenough prejudice beyond the facts of the case in issue that the jury would return a death\n\nverdict in answering the special issues.” He asserts that this argument was extreme and\n\nmanifestly improper because it injected new and harmful facts into the proceeding.\n\n       The record shows that before the State’s argument, defense counsel’s closing\n\nargument had attacked Kametra’s credibility and character, stating that Kametra’s\n\ntestimony about appellant’s previous acts of domestic violence had “escalated” since she\n\nfirst described them to defense counsel. Counsel pointed out that Kametra had cheated on\n\nappellant while he was serving a previous jail term. Counsel also described Kametra as a\n\n“sophisticated prostitute” running an “internet prostitution scheme.” He reminded the\n\njury that, after Kametra left appellant, she developed a $3,000-a-month drug habit.\n\nDefense counsel argued that the State wanted to present Kametra as a victim with “no\n\nway to get away from [appellant]” because it fit well with the State’s theory of the case.\n\n       The State avers that the prosecutor’s argument was a response to defense counsel’s\n\f                                                                             MUHAMMAD –98\nargument, as well as a summation and reasonable deduction from the evidence. See\n\nRocha v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1448432\"><a href=\"/opinion/1448432/rocha-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 21 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000) (recognizing four areas of\n\npermissible jury argument). The State also argues that Angelou’s life history was\n\nadmissible under the “common knowledge” exception to the prohibition against arguing\n\noutside the record. See Nenno v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1491957\"><a href=\"/opinion/1491957/nenno-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">970</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">549</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 559 (Tex. Crim. App. 1998).\n\nSpecifically, the State asserts, “Angelou is a public figure whose life history is common\n\nknowledge.”\n\n       Although the State’s argument describing the facts of Kametra’s life was a\n\nsummation and reasonable deduction from the evidence, the argument describing\n\nAngelou’s life history was not. Angelou’s life history was outside the record. “Common\n\nknowledge” does not necessarily encompass the life history of a public figure, and we are\n\nnot persuaded that Angelou’s life history otherwise falls within the “common knowledge”\n\nexception. See, e.g., Ex parte Lane, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1618393\"><a href=\"/opinion/1618393/ex-parte-lane/\"><span class=\"volume\">303</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">702</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 711-12 (Tex. Crim. App. 2009)\n\n(holding that an outside-the-record argument that “people” sell methamphetamine to\n\nchildren, who then become addicts, was designed to arouse the passion and prejudices of\n\nthe jury and was an improper attempt to persuade the jury to convict a defendant of\n\npossession with intent to deliver based on an uncharged offense for which he was not on\n\ntrial); Lagrone, 942 S.W.2d at 619 (holding that an argument that “drugs . . . are a part of\n\nprison life” was not a matter of common knowledge); Freeman, 340 S.W.3d at 728\n\n(holding that a comment that a defendant “tried with all he could” to “commit the worst\n\ncriminal act on law enforcement ever in the United States’ history,” was not a matter of\n\f                                                                              MUHAMMAD –99\ncommon knowledge).\n\n       However, even if Angelou’s life history was not a matter of common knowledge,\n\nwe find that any error in overruling appellant’s objection to this argument was harmless.\n\nSee Lagrone, 942 S.W.2d at 619. “Comments upon matters outside the record, while\n\noutside the permissible areas of jury argument, do not appear to raise any unique concerns\n\nthat would require us to assign constitutional status.” Easley v.

App. 2014). Such non-constitutional error must be disregarded if it did\n\nnot affect the defendant’s substantial rights. T EX. R. A PP. P. 44.2(b); Freeman, 340\n\nS.W.3d at 728; Brown v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1590505\"><a href=\"/opinion/1590505/brown-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">270</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">564</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 572-73 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008). In\n\ndetermining whether the substantial rights of the defendant have been affected, we\n\nbalance the severity of the misconduct (that is, the prejudicial effect), any curative\n\nmeasures, and the certainty of the punishment assessed absent the misconduct. See\n\nMartinez, 17 S.W.3d at 692-93.\n\n       When viewed against the State’s argument as a whole, the State’s argument that\n\nintroduced information about Angelou’s life was not calculated to deprive appellant of a\n\nfair and impartial trial. In addition, this information was not particularly inflammatory or\n\nprejudicial. This part of the State’s argument took up less than two pages of an eighteen-\n\npage final closing argument. Although the trial court did not take curative measures, we\n\nhave a strong assurance that the jury would have assessed the same punishment if the\n\nState had not introduced information about Angelou’s life. In light of the other evidence\n\nwhich supported a finding of future dangerousness – including the instant offense and\n\f                                                                             MUHAMMAD –100\nappellant’s history of physically abusing Kametra and his sister – the introduction of this\n\ninformation had no appreciable effect on the jury’s decision. See, e.g., Lagrone, 942\n\nS.W.2d at 620. Point of error forty-one is overruled.\n\n                               CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES\n\n       Appellant raises points of error forty-three through fifty-four under the heading,\n\n“Constitutional Issues.” These points of error raise various challenges to the\n\nconstitutionality of Article 37.071, as well as challenges to the trial court’s rulings on\n\nappellant’s pretrial motions to find Article 37.071 unconstitutional. Citing Saldano,\n\nappellant acknowledges that this Court has rejected these claims in the past. He invites\n\nthe Court to review its prior decisions and states that he has included these claims in order\n\nto preserve them for further review in the federal courts. As appellant acknowledges, we\n\nhave previously rejected similar claims. See Saldano, 232 S.W.3d at 107-08. Appellant\n\npresents no new arguments to persuade us to revisit our previous dispositions of these\n\nissues. Points of error forty-three through fifty-four are overruled.\n\n       We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\nDelivered: November 4, 2015\nDo Not Publish\n\f</pre>",
