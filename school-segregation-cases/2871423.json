The procedural history of this case and the details of Delker’s claims\n\nare well-known to the parties, set forth in the District Court’s thorough opinion, and need\n\nnot be discussed at length. Briefly, Delker alleged that he was confined in administrative\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\fsegregation without meaningful review and that this violated his right to due process.\n\nDelker has been kept in segregation since December 1973 after killing a Department of\n\nCorrections captain. The Magistrate Judge issued a Report and Recommendation and\n\nconcluded that, while Delker had a liberty interest in being released from administrative\n\nsegregation, the procedures used to determine whether or not he would be released\n\ncomported with procedural due process. The District Court adopted the Magistrate\n\nJudge’s Report and Recommendation and granted the motion for summary judgment.\n\nDelker filed a timely notice of appeal and we have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n\n       We exercise plenary review over the District Court’s order granting appellees’\n\nmotion for summary judgment. Gallo v. City of Philadelphia, 161 F.3d 217, 221 (3d Cir.\n\n1998). A grant of summary judgment will be affirmed if our review reveals that “there is\n\nno genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment\n\nas a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). We review the facts in a light most favorable\n\nto the party against whom summary judgment was entered. See Coolspring Stone Supply,\n\nInc. v. American States Life Ins. Co., 10 F.3d 144, 146 (3d Cir. 1993).\n\n       Appellees conceded in the District Court that Delker’s continuing placement in\n\nadministrative confinement triggers due process protections. Thus, the question is\n\nwhether Delker received procedural due process in relation to his confinement. In Shoats\n\nv. Horn, 213 F.3d 140 (3d Cir. 2000), we examined the case of a prisoner who had been\n\nheld in administrative confinement for eight years. We held that based on the periodic\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\freviews of his status, Shoats had received the due process to which he was entitled. We\n\nfurther noted that even if Shoats’s confinement was based only on his past crimes, the\n\nprocess would be constitutional. Delker argues that, while he has been given the required\n\nperiodic reviews, these reviews were “no more than rote exercises” and this denial of\n\nmeaningful review violates the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n        The District Court did a thorough review of the relevant caselaw and set forth a\n\nconcise summary of the appellees’ deposition testimony. We agree with the District\n\nCourt that the appellees gave Delker meaningful periodic reviews, and thus procedural\n\ndue process, and were entitled to summary judgment. However, we note that it would be\n\nhelpful for judicial review if a brief written rationalization for keeping Delker confined in\n\nsolitary was made when his status was reviewed, although not necessarily every ninety\n\ndays.\n\n        For the above reasons, as well as those set forth by the District Court, we will\n\naffirm the District Court’s April 1, 2003, judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\f",
