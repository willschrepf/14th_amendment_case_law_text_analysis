An act is deceptive if it is likely to mislead a\n\nreasonable consumer. Such an act satisfies the first element if it has the capacity to\n\ndeceive a substantial portion of the public. When the underlying facts are undisputed,\n\nthe question whether the acts are likely to mislead—an objective inquiry—is a question of\n\nlaw. Whether such a deception has the capacity to reach a substantial portion of the\n\npublic is a question of fact precluding summary judgment, unless the undisputed facts\n\nestablish that capacity.\n\n\n       I Ch. 19.86 RCW.\n\fNo. 74978-1-1/2\n\n       Here, the undisputed facts show The Mandatory Poster Agency, Inc.(MPA)sent\n\nmass mailings under the assumed name Corporate Records Service(CRS)to more\n\nthan 79,000 Washington corporations. As a matter of law, the undisputed format,\n\nimages, and content of the mailings created a net impression likely to mislead a\n\nreasonable consumer into believing CRS is associated with a governmental agency and\n\nthat the recipients were obligated to fill out and return the solicitations with a fee of\n\n$125. Notably, the mass mailings include language, tone, and imagery prohibited by\n\nMPA's 2008 \"Assurance of Discontinuance,\" and such violations are prima facie\n\nevidence of a CPA violation.\n\n       Further, the undisputed scope of the extensive mass mailings generating\n\npayments by 2,901 consumers reveals a capacity to reach and thus deceive a\n\nsubstantial portion of the public. The trial court did not err in granting summary\n\njudgment that MPA engaged in a deceptive act or practice.\n\n       CRS contends the $793,540 penalty imposed by the court is excessive. On\n\ncross appeal, the State argues the penalty is too lenient. The trial court did not abuse\n\nits broad discretion in setting a penalty of $10 per mailing, together with a provision\n\nrequiring CRS to fund restitution.\n\n       The trial court adequately engaged in a lodestar calculation of attorney fees, but\n\nfailed to make the required findings for an award of nonlawyer time. And the trial court\n\nshould not have awarded expert witness fees as costs.\n\n       Because the State is the prevailing party on appeal, it is entitled to fees on\n\nappeal.\n\n       We affirm in part and reverse in part.\n\n\n\n                                               2\n\fNo. 74978-1-1/3\n\n                                         FACTS\n\n       Steven Fata, Thomas Fata, and Joseph Fata each own one-third of MPA and\n\njointly undertake all corporate decisions. CRS has a mailbox in Olympia, Washington at\n\na United Parcel Service store.\n\n       Several years ago, the Attorney General's Office initiated an investigation into\n\nMPA's mass marketing of posters summarizing state and federal legal requirements.\n\nThe State alleged MPA used mailers with various business names to deceive\n\nconsumers into believing they must purchase posters from the company in order to\n\ncomply with state and federal law. The MPA advertisements appeared to originate from\n\nthe government or an organization associated or in contact with the government. The\n\nads also used names that evoked \"an official government tone\" and emblems that\n\n\"mimic a state agency emblem.\"2 The ads also used a postal drop box with an Olympia\n\naddress. The language suggested a necessity to act, such as \"Advisory,\"\"advisement,\"\n\n\"achieve compliance,\" and \"effective immediately.\"3\n\n       In February 2008, at the conclusion of the Attorney General Office's\n\ninvestigation, MPA entered into an Assurance of Discontinuance prohibiting the\n\ncompany and its officers, directors, and principals from engaging in a variety of unfair or\n\ndeceptive practices, including sending misleading solicitations to consumers that create\n\nthe impression that the solicitations are from a government agency. The Assurance of\n\nDiscontinuance also barred the use of specific terms and practices, along with the\n\nfollowing provision:\n\n\n\n       2 Clerk's   Papers(CP)at 488.\n       3 CP at 488.\n\n\n                                             3\n\fNo. 74978-1-1/4\n\n      This Assurance of Discontinuance shall not be considered an admission of\n      violation of the Consumer Protection Act for any purposes, but failure to\n      comply with this Assurance of Discontinuance shall be prima facie\n      evidence of violations of RCW 19.86.020, thereby placing upon the\n      Respondents, and their officers, directors, and principals, the burden of\n      defending against imposition by the court of damages, injunctions,\n      restitution, civil penalties of up to $2,000.00 per violation and costs\n      including reasonable attorney's fees. In addition, pursuant to\n      RCW 19.86.140[J violations of the injunctive provisions of this Assurance\n      of Discontinuance may result in court imposed civil penalties of up to\n      $25,000.00•[4J\n\n      In 2012 and 2013, CRS sent \"Annual Minutes Records Form\" solicitations to\n\nWashington consumers. Joseph Fata designed the solicitation; Steven Fata and\n\nThomas Fata approved its use in Washington.\n\n      CRS mailed 79,354 solicitations to Washington consumers. The front of each\n\nenvelope contained the language \"IMPORTANT\" in bold above \"Annual Minutes\n\nRequirement Statement,\"\"TIME SENSITIVE,\" and \"If addressed name is incorrect,\n\nplease forward document to an authorized employee representative Immediately.\"6 The\n\ngreen colored envelope included a stylized eagle symbol in the upper right-hand corner\n\nand an Olympia return address. A notation \"THIS IS NOT A GOVERNMENT\n\nDOCUMENT\" was located just below the return address.6\n\n      Inside the envelope, CRS included a form entitled \"2012 — ANNUAL MINUTES\n\nRECORDS FORM.\"7 The form was addressed to the recipient's business and\n\ncontained a key code, bar code, response date, and the recipient's date of\n\nincorporation. Each solicitation, excluding the February 2013 mailings, also included\n\n\n      4 CP   at 492.\n      5 CP   at 1011, 1025, 1028.\n      6 CP   at 1011, 1025, 1028.\n      7 CP   at 1006, 1012-13, 1023-24, 1029, 2199-200.\n\n\n                                           4\n\fNo. 74978-1-1/5\n\nthe \"Corporation Number\" consisting of the uniform business identifier number assigned\n\nby the State to the corporation.8 The first instruction on the form stated,\"IMPORTANT!\n\nFOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS EXACTLY WHEN COMPLETING THIS FORM. PLEASE\n\nPRINT.\"8 CRS listed selected citations to the Washington Business Corporations Act\n\nnear the top of the page. The form had the disclaimer \"CORPORATE RECORDS\n\nSERVICE IS NOT A GOVERNMENT AGENCY AND DOES NOT HAVE OR\n\nCONTRACT WITH ANY GOVERNMENT AGENCY TO PROVIDE THIS SERVICE.\"1°\n\nThis disclaimer was surrounded by other text and was located one-third of the way\n\ndown from the top of the form.\n\n         CRS titled the second page \"INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING THE\n\nANNUAL MINUTES RECORDS FORM (Washington Corporations).\"11 The instructions\n\ndirect recipients to review the accuracy of their preprinted corporate name and address\n\nand to then complete seven steps to fill out the form. The instructions also note that\n\n\"[m]aintaining records is important to the existence of all corporations.\"12 In response to\n\nthe mailing, 2,901 Washington businesses submitted a completed form with the $125\n\nfee.13\n\n\n\n\n           at 2199; CP at 1010-14(CRS did not include the corporation number in its\n         8 CP\nFebruary 2013 mailings, totaling approximately 5,619 mailings).\n      9 CP at 1012-13, 1023-24, 1027, 1029, 2199.\n\n         19 CP   at 1012-13, 1023-24, 1029, 2199-200.\n         11 CP at 1024.\n         12 CP at 1024.\n\n         13 CP   at 484-85.\n\n\n                                             5\n\fNo. 74978-1-1/6\n\n      CRS sent a corporate minute book to Washington consumers who returned the\n\nAnnual Minutes Records Form and $125.14 The corporate minute book contained\n\n\"Unanimous Consent of Shareholders\" and \"Unanimous Consent of Directors\" forms.15\n\nThe corporate minute book included instructions to sign and date the documents. It\n\nadvised that \"[y]our company will be in full compliance with the corporate minute records\n\nrequirement after the Unanimous Consent documents are signed and dated.\"16\n\n      After receiving numerous complaints, the Attorney General's Office filed a lawsuit\n\nin King County Superior Court, alleging misrepresentation and violations of the CPA.\n\nBoth parties moved for summary judgment. The trial court partially granted the State's\n\nmotion and denied CRS's motion. The court concluded as a matter of law that the\n\nAnnual Minutes Records Form solicitation was a deceptive act or practice that violated\n\nthe Assurance of Discontinuance and the CPA. Specifically, the court determined CRS\n\ncommitted 79,354 separate violations by creating the deceptive net impression that its\n\nsolicitations \"were from a governmental agency and that Washington consumers were\n\nobligated to fill out and return the solicitations along with $125.\"17 The court also\n\nconcluded as a matter of law that the \"solicitations had the capacity to deceive a\n\nsubstantial number of Washington consumers\" and because CRS engaged in trade and\n\ncommerce, their actions affected the public interest.\n\n       The trial court entered an order imposing a civil penalty under RCW 19.86.140 in\n\nthe amount of $793,540, $10 per violation, and instituted a restitution process requiring\n\n\n       14   CP at 1006.\n       15   CP at 1015-21.\n       16   CP at 1019.\n       17 CP   at 1591.\n\n\n                                             6\n\fNo. 74978-1-1/7\n\nCRS to transmit the full amount of potential restitution, $362,625, to a claims\n\nadministrator.18 The trial court also awarded the State $337,593.20 in attorney fees and\n\n$39,571.27 in costs.18\n\n       CRS appeals. The State cross appeals.\n\n                                         ANALYSIS\n\n       We review a summary judgment decision de novo.2° Summary judgment is\n\nappropriate if \"there is no genuine issue as to any material fact' and `the moving party is\n\nentitled to a judgment as a matter of law.'\"21 A response to a summary judgment motion\n\n\"must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\"22\n\n                                  I. Unfair or Deceptive Act\n\n       CRS argues the trial court erred by concluding as a matter of law that its\n\nsolicitation was an unfair or deceptive act under the CPA.\n\n       The CPA forbids luinfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or\n\npractices in the conduct of any trade or commerce.\"23 The State must prove \"(1) an\n\nunfair or deceptive act or practice,(2) occurring in trade or commerce, and (3) public\n\ninterest impact.\"24 Unlike a private plaintiff under the CPA,the State is not required to\n\n\n\n\n       18   CP at 2046.\n       19 CP   at 2125-27.\n        Keck v.

Several cases have recognized the first element is a question\n\nof law when the facts are undisputed.\n\n       In Leingang v. Pierce County Medical Bureau, Inc., the court noted:\n\n       Whether a party in fact committed a particular act is reviewable under the\n       substantial evidence test. However, the determination of whether a\n       particular statute applies to a factual situation is a conclusion of law.\n       Consequently, whether a particular action gives rise to a Consumer\n       Protection Act violation is reviewable as a question of law. Therefore,\n       since there is no dispute offacts as to what the parties did in this case,\n       whether the conduct constitutes an unfair or deceptive act can be decided\n       by this court as a question oflaw.1341\n\n       Twelve years later, our Supreme Court echoed the same standard in Panag v.\n\nFarmers Insurance Company of Washington: \"The next issue is whether.. . the first\n\n[CPA]element has been established. Whether a particular act or practice is 'unfair or\n\ndeceptive' is a question of law.\"35 We have recognized this standard in several cases.36\n\n\n       34   131 Wn.2d 133, 150, 930 P.2d 288(1997)(emphasis added)(citations\nomitted).\n       36 166 Wn.2d   27, 47, 204 P.3d 885(2009)(emphasis added)(citing Leingang,\n131 Wn.2d at 150).\n       36 Rush, 190 Wn.

But\n\nthose cases hold that the capacity to reach a substantial portion of the public may\n\npresent a question of fact, not that the fact finder is asked to determine whether\n\nundisputed facts are likely to mislead a reasonable consumer.39\n\n       The Holiday Resort court acknowledged that whether an act is unfair or\n\ndeceptive is a legal question, but \"whether the 1997 Rental Agreement has the capacity\n\nto deceive a substantial portion of the public is a question of fact.\"49 In that case, the\n\ntrial court dismissed the plaintiffs' suit and ruled there was no connection between the\n\nalleged CPA violation and the plaintiffs' injuries.'\" On appeal, this court concluded the\n\nlanguage in the rental agreement violated a statute and was an unfair act or practice\n\n\n\n\nIns.

Those cases\n\nrecognize only that the substantial portion of the public component of a deceptive act or\n\npractice may present a question of fact, not that a fact finder weighs whether a\n\nrepresentation, omission, or practice is likely to mislead a reasonable consumer.47\n\n\n\n       42   Id. at 226.\n       43 Id. at 226-27 (emphasis added).\n\n       44   Behnke, 172 Wn.

CRS also cites Deegan v. Windermere Real\nEstate/Center-Isle, Inc., 197 Wn. App. 875, 391 P.3d 582(2017) and Rhodes v. Rains,\n\n                                             11\n\fNo. 74978-1-1/12\n\n       The undisputed facts show each of the 79,354 solicitations included an envelope\n\nthat(1) contained bolded text reading,\"IMPORTANT\"\"Annual Minutes Requirement\n\nStatement\";(2) depicted a large eagle on the top right side of the green colored\n\nenvelope;(3) stated \"Business Mail - Time Sensitive\";(4) directed the recipient to\n\n\"[p]lease forward to an authorized employee representative Immediately\"; and (5) used\n\nauthoritative language similar to a government document.48 The solicitation inside the\n\nenvelope (1) contained selective citations to Washington corporate statutes,(2) directed\n\n\"IMPORTANT! FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS EXACTLY WHEN COMPLETING THIS\n\nFORM,PLEASE PRINT,\"(3) referred to the recipient's Washington State corporation\n\nuniform business identifier number, and (4) recited the recipient's incorporation date.49\n\nAlthough the CRS form is not identical to the Secretary of State's annual report form,\n\nthe tone is similar to a mandatory governmental form.\n\n       The CRS mass mailings are likely to mislead a reasonable consumer because\n\nthe undisputed format, images, and content do mimic government-related forms and\n\ncreate the net impression that the recipient is obligated to return the form and pay $125\n\nto CRS. CRS contends its solicitations were not deceptive because they accurately\n\nstated Washington corporate law requirements.

Deegan stands for the proposition that causation under the CPA is a question\nof fact, and Rhodes merely suggests that disputed facts should be resolved by the trier\nof fact.\n       48 CP   at 1011, 1025, 1028.\n       49 CP   at 1012-13, 1023-24, 1027, 1029, 2199.\n\n\n                                             12\n\fNo. 74978-1-1/13\n\nmislead.'\"5° Here, it is clear that consents in lieu of director and shareholder meetings\n\nmay satisfy Washington annual meeting and recordkeeping requirements. But the\n\naccuracy of those statements does not eliminate their likelihood to mislead in the\n\ncontext of the annual minutes solicitation. Consumers are likely misled by the net\n\nimpression that CRS is associated with the government and that consumers are\n\nrequired to return the completed form with a fee.\n\n      CRS also focuses on its disclaimers, but courts have recognized that disclaimers\n\ndo not always cure the potential for deception.51 Here, the disclaimer \"THIS IS NOT A\n\nGOVERNMENT DOCUMENT\" is just underneath the return address on the envelope\n\nand is overshadowed by a large all caps and bold \"IMPORTANT\" notation on the face\n\nof the envelope just above \"Annual Minutes Requirement Statement.\" The all-caps\n\ndisclaimer in the instructions, that CRS is not a government agency and does not have\n\na contract with a government agency is one-third down the page surrounded by\n\nunrelated instructions. Considering the format and placement, the disclaimers do not\n\ncure the potential for deception. Notwithstanding the disclaimers, CRS's solicitation\n\ncreated the misleading net impression that CRS is associated with a government\n\nagency and that consumers were obligated to return the form with a fee.\n\n\n\n       50 Kaiser, 161 Wn.

The Assurance of\n\nDiscontinuance precluded \"[u]se of the term 'confidential','important information',\n\n'approved','effective immediately','compliance','issued', or any terms ofsimilar\n\nimport.\"52 CRS used the words \"IMPORTANT\" and \"Requirement\" on its envelope and\n\ninstructed recipients \"IMPORTANT! FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS EXACTLY WHEN\n\nCOMPLETING THIS FORM.\"53\n\n       The Assurance of Discontinuance barred language suggesting that \"an enclosed\n\nsolicitation requires immediate or other mandated response.\"54 CRS used \"Annual\n\nMinutes Requirement Statement,\" \"If addressed name is incorrect, please forward\n\ndocument to an authorized employee representative Immediately,\" and \"TIME\n\nSENSITIVE\" on the envelope.55 CRS also referred to a corporate uniform business\n\nidentifier number on the vast majority of the solicitations.56\n\n\n\n\n       52 CP   at 489, Assurance of Discontinuance(AOD)2.1(b)(3)(emphasis added).\n       53 CP   at 1011-12, 1028-29.\n       54   CP at 489, AOD 2.1(b)(5).\n       55 CP   at 1011, 1028.\n       56   CP at 1029.\n\n\n                                              14\n\fNo. 74978-1-1/15\n\n       We conclude CRS's mailers violated the Assurance of Discontinuance. The\n\nviolations are prima facie evidence of a CPA violation.\n\n                                       II. Penalties\n\n       CRS argues the trial court abused its discretion in imposing an excessive penalty\n\nbecause the State did not prove each recipient was deceived by the solicitation. In its\n\ncross appeal, the State contends the penalties were too lenient.\n\n       The CPA includes specific provisions for civil penalties, authorizing a penalty up\n\nto $2,000 per violation.57 We review the trial court's assessment of civil penalties within\n\nthe statutory limits for an abuse of discretion.58 Each deceptive act is a separate\n\nviolation. In State v. Ralph Williams' North West Chrysler Plymouth, Inc., our Supreme\n\nCourt recognized that the CPA \"vests the trial court with the power to assess a penalty\n\nfor each violation.\"58 And CPA penalties are valid even though \"the trial court did not\n\nfind that the consumers relied on appellants' wrongful conduct.\"8° Similarly, because\n\neach of CRS's 79,354 solicitations had the capacity to deceive, each mailing was a\n\nviolation, whether or not the recipient purchased its product.\n\n\n\n\n       57 RCW   19.86.140.\n       55 See Ethridge v. Hwang, 105 Wn. App. 447,459, 20 P.3d 958(2001)(award of\nenhanced damages under the CPA reviewed for abuse of discretion); United States v.\nITT Continental Baking Co., 420 U.S. 223, 229 n.6, 95 S.

Ed. 2d 148\n(1975)(reviewing lower court assessment of civil penalty within statutory limits for\nFederal Trade Commission Act violation for abuse of discretion); see also Progressive\nAnimal Welfare Soc'y v. University of Wash., 114 Wn.2d 677, 683-84, 688-89, 790 P.2d\n604(1990)(reviewing trial court's calculation of attorney fees mandated by statute for\nabuse of discretion).\n       59 87 Wn.2d 298, 317, 553 P.2d 423(1976)(also recognizing the potential for\nmultiple violations per consumer).\n       69 Id.\n\n\n\n                                            15\n\fNo. 74978-1-1/16\n\n          Both parties cite United States v. Reader's Digest Association Inc., a similar\n\nmass mailing case under an analogous consumer protection standard, where a federal\n\ndistrict court held that Reader's Digest committed 17,940,521 violations on the rationale\n\nthat \"each letter distributed in the Digest's mass mailings constituted a separate\n\nviolation.\"61 The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed, holding\n\n\"each letter included as part of a mass mailing constitutes a separate violation.\"62 The\n\ncourt also identified five factors to consider in determining the appropriate penalty: (1)\n\nwhether defendants acted in good faith,(2) injury to the public,(3) defendant's ability to\n\npay,(4) desire to eliminate any benefits derived by the defendants from the violation at\n\nissue, and (5) necessity of vindicating the authority of the law enforcement agency.63\n\n          Here, the trial court focused on lack of good faith without addressing the other\n\nReader's Digest factors. While the factors are helpful guidelines, we reject any\n\nsuggestion by either party that a trial court is compelled to expressly address each\n\nfactor.\n\n          Next, CRS argues RCW 19.86.140 limits the total civil penalty to $25,000.\n\n          RCW 19.86.140 provides, in relevant part:\n\n                  Every person who shall violate the terms of any injunction issued as\n          in this chapter provided, shall forfeit and pay a civil penalty of not more\n          than twenty-five thousand dollars.\n\n\n\n                  Every person who violates RCW 19.86.020 shall forfeit and pay a\n          civil penalty of not more than two thousand dollars for each violation.\n\n\n\n          61662 F.2d 955, 959-60 (3rd Cir. 1981).\n          62 Id. at 966 (emphasis added).\n\n          63 Id. at 967.\n\n\n\n                                               16\n\fNo. 74978-1-1/17\n\n       The $25,000.00 limit from the first paragraph does not apply here because the\n\nState did not plead or seek to enforce the Assurance of Discontinuance injunctive\n\nprovisions. Instead, the State pleaded relief for violations of ROW 19.86.020 for\n\ndeceptive acts. The trial court determined that the violations of the assurance of\n\ndiscontinuance constituted prima facie evidence of such CPA violations.\n\n       Relying on BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore, CRS also argues this civil\n\npenalty violates due process.64 To determine whether a $2,000,000 punitive damages\n\naward to one plaintiff in Gore violated due process, the United States Supreme Court\n\nlooked to the reprehensibility of the defendant's conduct by considering specific\n\nfactors.65 But in Perez-Farias v. Global Horizons, Inc., our Supreme Court expressly\n\ndeclined to apply the Gore factors to cases involving statutory damages, noting \"no\n\nstate public policy or due process principles require reduction in the total damages\n\nmandated by statute.\"66 And CRS does not provide any compelling authority67 that\n\ncourts have applied the Gore factors to cases involving statutory damages.68\n\n\n\n\n      64 517   U.S. 559, 116 S. Ct. 1589, 134 L. Ed. 2d 809(1996).\n      65 The   court in Gore looked at whether the harm caused was physical or\neconomic, the conduct showed an indifference to or a reckless disregard of the health\nor safety of others, the target of the conduct had financial vulnerability, the conduct\ninvolved repeated actions or was an isolated incident, and if the harm was the result of\nintentional malice, trickery, or deceit. Id. at 575.\n      66  175 Wn.2d 518, 533-34, 286 P.3d 46(2012).\n       67 CRS cites to State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co. v. Campbell, 538 U.S. 408, 123 S.\nCt. 1513, 155 L. Ed. 2d. 585 (2003), but that case makes no mention of the applicability\nof the Gore factors to cases involving statutory damages.\n      68 Although  the State offers analysis as to how, if considered, the Gore factors\nwould apply in this case, we need not apply those factors. See Perez-Farias, 175\nWn.2d at 532 n.15.\n\n\n                                           17\n\fNo. 74978-1-1/18\n\n       On cross appeal, the State argues the trial court did not impose penalties\n\nadequate to deter future violations, but does not establish that the trial court's decision\n\nwas outside the range of acceptable choices. The trial court specifically noted the\n\nacceptable range of penalties in its order:\n\n       The civil penalty set herein is less than the maximum potential civil penalty\n       of $2,000 per violation, which would total $158,708,000. There is no\n       mandatory \"cap\" on the penalty in this situation. The amount is also less\n       than the potential harm of $9,919,250 that Defendants could have caused\n       if all Washington consumers who had received Defendants' deceptive\n       mailer had purchased the $125 product based on Defendants'\n       deception.[691\n\nThe penalties, combined with the restitution provisions, ensure compensation to injured\n\nconsumers and, considering the likely response rate for such mass-mail solicitations, far\n\nexceed any potential profits. The penalty does deter similar misleading mailings.\n\n       We conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion in setting the amount of\n\npenalties.\n\n                                          III. Fees\n\n       CRS argues the trial court abused its discretion in calculating and awarding the\n\nState a fee award in the amount of $337,593.20.\n\n       In a CPA enforcement action, the trial court has discretion to award the prevailing\n\nparty the costs of the action, including reasonable attorney fees.\" To determine a\n\nreasonable attorney fee, the court starts with the \"lodestar\" calculation.71 That\n\n\n\n\n       69 CP   at 2045.\n       70   RCW 19.86.080(1); Ralph Williams, 87 Wn.2d at 314-15.\n       71   Berryman v.

CRS argues that the requested government\n\nattorney rates are artificially high, but it was within the discretion of the trial court to\n\naccept the identified rates.73 The trial court also concluded that the time detailed in the\n\nState's declarations was reasonable and appropriate. The State submitted a 28-page\n\nspreadsheet listing the individual time entries for which it sought fees. As CRS notes,\n\nseveral entries are vague and general. But the majority of the entries contain\n\ninformation identifying the nature of the work itemized. The trial court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in accepting the itemizations.\n\n       CRS argues the State failed to segregate its time spent on its abandoned theory\n\nthat CRS misrepresented the legal standards for Washington corporate recordkeeping.\n\nThe time itemized for a case should be discounted for hours spent on unsuccessful\n\nclaims or otherwise unproductive time.74 A reduction is warranted if \"the hours at issue\n\nwere unproductive or that they were not sufficiently related to the successful claim.\"75\n\n\n\n\n       72   Id.\n       73 See W.

CRS\n\nargued a segregation was necessary for time spent by the State on its allegation that\n\nCRS inaccurately stated Washington corporate recordkeeping standards. Specifically,\n\nCRS pointed to the June 18, 2015 letter by the assistant attorney general as evidence\n\nthe State abandoned that theory late in the litigation. The State replied:\n\n       While the focus of the case has been on whether Defendants' solicitation\n       created the deceptive net impression that the solicitation came from a\n       government agency that consumers were required to return and whether\n       Defendants violated the 2008 Assurance of Discontinuance (AOD),\n       Defendants also engaged in deceptive acts and practices by offering to\n       provide meeting minutes while actually providing corporate consents.n\n\nThe June 18 letter is largely consistent with the State's argument.78 Although the State\n\nmay have refined its theory of a corporate recordkeeping misrepresentation and the trial\n\ncourt granted summary judgment only on the \"net impressions\" theory, both alleged\n\nunfair and deceptive acts based on the same core of underlying facts of the contents of\n\nthe mass mailings. Where the plaintiffs' claims involve a common core of facts and\n\nrelated legal theories, \"'a plaintiff who has won substantial relief should not have his\n\nattorney's fee reduced simply because the [trial] court did not adopt each contention\n\n\n       76   Id. at 540.\n       77 CP   at 2111.\n       78 The  letter purports to clarify the State's legal theories and then reconcile its\nclarified position with an earlier interrogatory answer: \"Mt is our position that the\nWashington Business Corporation Act requires a corporation to take certain actions\nthrough a meeting or through executed consents. If a meeting is held, then minutes\nmust be kept as permanent records.

Costs\n\n       CRS argues the trial court erred in awarding costs beyond those allowed in\n\nRCW 4.84.010.\n\n       The standard of review for an award of costs involves a two-step process.81\n\nFirst, whether a statute, contract, or equitable theory authorizes the award is a matter of\n\nlaw, which we review de novo.82 Second, if there is such authority, the amount of the\n\naward is subject to the abuse of discretion standard.83\n\n       Costs in a CPA action are limited to those set out in RCW 4.84.010.84\n\nRCW 4.84.010 does not authorize expert witness fees in an award of costs to the\n\nprevailing party.85 Our Supreme Court has recognized that \"'[w]here an expert is\n\nemployed and is acting for one of the parties', it is not proper to charge the allowance of\n\nfees for such expert against the losing party as a part of the costs of the action.'\"88\n\n       Here, the State included expert witness fees and the transcription of that expert\n\nwitness testimony in its cost bill.\n\n       We conclude the trial court erred in awarding costs for expert witness fees and\n\nthe transcription of that testimony.\n\n\n\n\n       81   Ester v.

An act is deceptive if it is likely to mislead a\n\nreasonable consumer. Such an act satisfies the first element if it has the capacity to\n\ndeceive a substantial portion of the public. When the underlying facts are undisputed,\n\nthe question whether the acts are likely to mislead—an objective inquiry—is a question of\n\nlaw. Whether such a deception has the capacity to reach a substantial portion of the\n\npublic is a question of fact precluding summary judgment, unless the undisputed facts\n\nestablish that capacity.\n\n\n       I Ch. 19.86 RCW.\n\fNo. 74978-1-1/2\n\n       Here, the undisputed facts show The Mandatory Poster Agency, Inc.(MPA)sent\n\nmass mailings under the assumed name Corporate Records Service(CRS)to more\n\nthan 79,000 Washington corporations. As a matter of law, the undisputed format,\n\nimages, and content of the mailings created a net impression likely to mislead a\n\nreasonable consumer into believing CRS is associated with a governmental agency and\n\nthat the recipients were obligated to fill out and return the solicitations with a fee of\n\n$125. Notably, the mass mailings include language, tone, and imagery prohibited by\n\nMPA's 2008 \"Assurance of Discontinuance,\" and such violations are prima facie\n\nevidence of a CPA violation.\n\n       Further, the undisputed scope of the extensive mass mailings generating\n\npayments by 2,901 consumers reveals a capacity to reach and thus deceive a\n\nsubstantial portion of the public. The trial court did not err in granting summary\n\njudgment that MPA engaged in a deceptive act or practice.\n\n       CRS contends the $793,540 penalty imposed by the court is excessive. On\n\ncross appeal, the State argues the penalty is too lenient. The trial court did not abuse\n\nits broad discretion in setting a penalty of $10 per mailing, together with a provision\n\nrequiring CRS to fund restitution.\n\n       The trial court adequately engaged in a lodestar calculation of attorney fees, but\n\nfailed to make the required findings for an award of nonlawyer time. And the trial court\n\nshould not have awarded expert witness fees as costs.\n\n       Because the State is the prevailing party on appeal, it is entitled to fees on\n\nappeal.\n\n       We affirm in part and reverse in part.\n\n\n\n                                               2\n\fNo. 74978-1-1/3\n\n                                         FACTS\n\n       Steven Fata, Thomas Fata, and Joseph Fata each own one-third of MPA and\n\njointly undertake all corporate decisions. CRS has a mailbox in Olympia, Washington at\n\na United Parcel Service store.\n\n       Several years ago, the Attorney General's Office initiated an investigation into\n\nMPA's mass marketing of posters summarizing state and federal legal requirements.\n\nThe State alleged MPA used mailers with various business names to deceive\n\nconsumers into believing they must purchase posters from the company in order to\n\ncomply with state and federal law. The MPA advertisements appeared to originate from\n\nthe government or an organization associated or in contact with the government. The\n\nads also used names that evoked \"an official government tone\" and emblems that\n\n\"mimic a state agency emblem.\"2 The ads also used a postal drop box with an Olympia\n\naddress. The language suggested a necessity to act, such as \"Advisory,\"\"advisement,\"\n\n\"achieve compliance,\" and \"effective immediately.\"3\n\n       In February 2008, at the conclusion of the Attorney General Office's\n\ninvestigation, MPA entered into an Assurance of Discontinuance prohibiting the\n\ncompany and its officers, directors, and principals from engaging in a variety of unfair or\n\ndeceptive practices, including sending misleading solicitations to consumers that create\n\nthe impression that the solicitations are from a government agency. The Assurance of\n\nDiscontinuance also barred the use of specific terms and practices, along with the\n\nfollowing provision:\n\n\n\n       2 Clerk's   Papers(CP)at 488.\n       3 CP at 488.\n\n\n                                             3\n\fNo. 74978-1-1/4\n\n      This Assurance of Discontinuance shall not be considered an admission of\n      violation of the Consumer Protection Act for any purposes, but failure to\n      comply with this Assurance of Discontinuance shall be prima facie\n      evidence of violations of RCW 19.86.020, thereby placing upon the\n      Respondents, and their officers, directors, and principals, the burden of\n      defending against imposition by the court of damages, injunctions,\n      restitution, civil penalties of up to $2,000.00 per violation and costs\n      including reasonable attorney's fees. In addition, pursuant to\n      RCW 19.86.140[J violations of the injunctive provisions of this Assurance\n      of Discontinuance may result in court imposed civil penalties of up to\n      $25,000.00•[4J\n\n      In 2012 and 2013, CRS sent \"Annual Minutes Records Form\" solicitations to\n\nWashington consumers. Joseph Fata designed the solicitation; Steven Fata and\n\nThomas Fata approved its use in Washington.\n\n      CRS mailed 79,354 solicitations to Washington consumers. The front of each\n\nenvelope contained the language \"IMPORTANT\" in bold above \"Annual Minutes\n\nRequirement Statement,\"\"TIME SENSITIVE,\" and \"If addressed name is incorrect,\n\nplease forward document to an authorized employee representative Immediately.\"6 The\n\ngreen colored envelope included a stylized eagle symbol in the upper right-hand corner\n\nand an Olympia return address. A notation \"THIS IS NOT A GOVERNMENT\n\nDOCUMENT\" was located just below the return address.6\n\n      Inside the envelope, CRS included a form entitled \"2012 — ANNUAL MINUTES\n\nRECORDS FORM.\"7 The form was addressed to the recipient's business and\n\ncontained a key code, bar code, response date, and the recipient's date of\n\nincorporation. Each solicitation, excluding the February 2013 mailings, also included\n\n\n      4 CP   at 492.\n      5 CP   at 1011, 1025, 1028.\n      6 CP   at 1011, 1025, 1028.\n      7 CP   at 1006, 1012-13, 1023-24, 1029, 2199-200.\n\n\n                                           4\n\fNo. 74978-1-1/5\n\nthe \"Corporation Number\" consisting of the uniform business identifier number assigned\n\nby the State to the corporation.8 The first instruction on the form stated,\"IMPORTANT!\n\nFOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS EXACTLY WHEN COMPLETING THIS FORM. PLEASE\n\nPRINT.\"8 CRS listed selected citations to the Washington Business Corporations Act\n\nnear the top of the page. The form had the disclaimer \"CORPORATE RECORDS\n\nSERVICE IS NOT A GOVERNMENT AGENCY AND DOES NOT HAVE OR\n\nCONTRACT WITH ANY GOVERNMENT AGENCY TO PROVIDE THIS SERVICE.\"1°\n\nThis disclaimer was surrounded by other text and was located one-third of the way\n\ndown from the top of the form.\n\n         CRS titled the second page \"INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING THE\n\nANNUAL MINUTES RECORDS FORM (Washington Corporations).\"11 The instructions\n\ndirect recipients to review the accuracy of their preprinted corporate name and address\n\nand to then complete seven steps to fill out the form. The instructions also note that\n\n\"[m]aintaining records is important to the existence of all corporations.\"12 In response to\n\nthe mailing, 2,901 Washington businesses submitted a completed form with the $125\n\nfee.13\n\n\n\n\n           at 2199; CP at 1010-14(CRS did not include the corporation number in its\n         8 CP\nFebruary 2013 mailings, totaling approximately 5,619 mailings).\n      9 CP at 1012-13, 1023-24, 1027, 1029, 2199.\n\n         19 CP   at 1012-13, 1023-24, 1029, 2199-200.\n         11 CP at 1024.\n         12 CP at 1024.\n\n         13 CP   at 484-85.\n\n\n                                             5\n\fNo. 74978-1-1/6\n\n      CRS sent a corporate minute book to Washington consumers who returned the\n\nAnnual Minutes Records Form and $125.14 The corporate minute book contained\n\n\"Unanimous Consent of Shareholders\" and \"Unanimous Consent of Directors\" forms.15\n\nThe corporate minute book included instructions to sign and date the documents. It\n\nadvised that \"[y]our company will be in full compliance with the corporate minute records\n\nrequirement after the Unanimous Consent documents are signed and dated.\"16\n\n      After receiving numerous complaints, the Attorney General's Office filed a lawsuit\n\nin King County Superior Court, alleging misrepresentation and violations of the CPA.\n\nBoth parties moved for summary judgment. The trial court partially granted the State's\n\nmotion and denied CRS's motion. The court concluded as a matter of law that the\n\nAnnual Minutes Records Form solicitation was a deceptive act or practice that violated\n\nthe Assurance of Discontinuance and the CPA. Specifically, the court determined CRS\n\ncommitted 79,354 separate violations by creating the deceptive net impression that its\n\nsolicitations \"were from a governmental agency and that Washington consumers were\n\nobligated to fill out and return the solicitations along with $125.\"17 The court also\n\nconcluded as a matter of law that the \"solicitations had the capacity to deceive a\n\nsubstantial number of Washington consumers\" and because CRS engaged in trade and\n\ncommerce, their actions affected the public interest.\n\n       The trial court entered an order imposing a civil penalty under RCW 19.86.140 in\n\nthe amount of $793,540, $10 per violation, and instituted a restitution process requiring\n\n\n       14   CP at 1006.\n       15   CP at 1015-21.\n       16   CP at 1019.\n       17 CP   at 1591.\n\n\n                                             6\n\fNo. 74978-1-1/7\n\nCRS to transmit the full amount of potential restitution, $362,625, to a claims\n\nadministrator.18 The trial court also awarded the State $337,593.20 in attorney fees and\n\n$39,571.27 in costs.18\n\n       CRS appeals. The State cross appeals.\n\n                                         ANALYSIS\n\n       We review a summary judgment decision de novo.2° Summary judgment is\n\nappropriate if \"there is no genuine issue as to any material fact' and `the moving party is\n\nentitled to a judgment as a matter of law.'\"21 A response to a summary judgment motion\n\n\"must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\"22\n\n                                  I.

Several cases have recognized the first element is a question\n\nof law when the facts are undisputed.\n\n       In Leingang v. Pierce County Medical Bureau, Inc., the court noted:\n\n       Whether a party in fact committed a particular act is reviewable under the\n       substantial evidence test. However, the determination of whether a\n       particular statute applies to a factual situation is a conclusion of law.\n       Consequently, whether a particular action gives rise to a Consumer\n       Protection Act violation is reviewable as a question of law. Therefore,\n       since there is no dispute offacts as to what the parties did in this case,\n       whether the conduct constitutes an unfair or deceptive act can be decided\n       by this court as a question oflaw.1341\n\n       Twelve years later, our Supreme Court echoed the same standard in Panag v.\n\nFarmers Insurance Company of Washington: \"The next issue is whether.. . the first\n\n[CPA]element has been established. Whether a particular act or practice is 'unfair or\n\ndeceptive' is a question of law.\"35 We have recognized this standard in several cases.36\n\n\n       34   </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">133</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 150, 930 P.2d 288(1997)(emphasis added)(citations\nomitted).\n       36 </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">166</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. 2d</span>   <span class=\"page\">27</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 47, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2626534\"><a href=\"/opinion/2626534/panag-v-farmers-ins-co-of-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">204</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">885</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">(2009)(emphasis added)(citing Leingang,\n131 Wn.2d at 150).\n       36 Rush, 190 Wn.

In its\n\ncross appeal, the State contends the penalties were too lenient.\n\n       The CPA includes specific provisions for civil penalties, authorizing a penalty up\n\nto $2,000 per violation.57 We review the trial court's assessment of civil penalties within\n\nthe statutory limits for an abuse of discretion.58 Each deceptive act is a separate\n\nviolation. In State v. Ralph Williams' North West Chrysler Plymouth, Inc., our Supreme\n\nCourt recognized that the CPA \"vests the trial court with the power to assess a penalty\n\nfor each violation.\"58 And CPA penalties are valid even though \"the trial court did not\n\nfind that the consumers relied on appellants' wrongful conduct.\"8° Similarly, because\n\neach of CRS's 79,354 solicitations had the capacity to deceive, each mailing was a\n\nviolation, whether or not the recipient purchased its product.\n\n\n\n\n       57 RCW   19.86.140.\n       55 See Ethridge v.

See Perez-Farias, 175\nWn.2d at 532 n.15.\n\n\n                                           17\n\fNo. 74978-1-1/18\n\n       On cross appeal, the State argues the trial court did not impose penalties\n\nadequate to deter future violations, but does not establish that the trial court's decision\n\nwas outside the range of acceptable choices. The trial court specifically noted the\n\nacceptable range of penalties in its order:\n\n       The civil penalty set herein is less than the maximum potential civil penalty\n       of $2,000 per violation, which would total $158,708,000. There is no\n       mandatory \"cap\" on the penalty in this situation. The amount is also less\n       than the potential harm of $9,919,250 that Defendants could have caused\n       if all Washington consumers who had received Defendants' deceptive\n       mailer had purchased the $125 product based on Defendants'\n       deception.[691\n\nThe penalties, combined with the restitution provisions, ensure compensation to injured\n\nconsumers and, considering the likely response rate for such mass-mail solicitations, far\n\nexceed any potential profits. The penalty does deter similar misleading mailings.\n\n       We conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion in setting the amount of\n\npenalties.\n\n                                          III. Fees\n\n       CRS argues the trial court abused its discretion in calculating and awarding the\n\nState a fee award in the amount of $337,593.20.\n\n       In a CPA enforcement action, the trial court has discretion to award the prevailing\n\nparty the costs of the action, including reasonable attorney fees.\" To determine a\n\nreasonable attorney fee, the court starts with the \"lodestar\" calculation.71 That\n\n\n\n\n       69 CP   at 2045.\n       70   RCW 19.86.080(1); Ralph Williams, 87 Wn.2d at 314-15.\n       71   Berryman v.

CRS argues that the requested government\n\nattorney rates are artificially high, but it was within the discretion of the trial court to\n\naccept the identified rates.73 The trial court also concluded that the time detailed in the\n\nState's declarations was reasonable and appropriate. The State submitted a 28-page\n\nspreadsheet listing the individual time entries for which it sought fees. As CRS notes,\n\nseveral entries are vague and general. But the majority of the entries contain\n\ninformation identifying the nature of the work itemized. The trial court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in accepting the itemizations.\n\n       CRS argues the State failed to segregate its time spent on its abandoned theory\n\nthat CRS misrepresented the legal standards for Washington corporate recordkeeping.\n\nThe time itemized for a case should be discounted for hours spent on unsuccessful\n\nclaims or otherwise unproductive time.74 A reduction is warranted if \"the hours at issue\n\nwere unproductive or that they were not sufficiently related to the successful claim.\"75\n\n\n\n\n       72   Id.\n       73 See W.

CRS\n\nargued a segregation was necessary for time spent by the State on its allegation that\n\nCRS inaccurately stated Washington corporate recordkeeping standards. Specifically,\n\nCRS pointed to the June 18, 2015 letter by the assistant attorney general as evidence\n\nthe State abandoned that theory late in the litigation. The State replied:\n\n       While the focus of the case has been on whether Defendants' solicitation\n       created the deceptive net impression that the solicitation came from a\n       government agency that consumers were required to return and whether\n       Defendants violated the 2008 Assurance of Discontinuance (AOD),\n       Defendants also engaged in deceptive acts and practices by offering to\n       provide meeting minutes while actually providing corporate consents.n\n\nThe June 18 letter is largely consistent with the State's argument.78 Although the State\n\nmay have refined its theory of a corporate recordkeeping misrepresentation and the trial\n\ncourt granted summary judgment only on the \"net impressions\" theory, both alleged\n\nunfair and deceptive acts based on the same core of underlying facts of the contents of\n\nthe mass mailings. Where the plaintiffs' claims involve a common core of facts and\n\nrelated legal theories, \"'a plaintiff who has won substantial relief should not have his\n\nattorney's fee reduced simply because the [trial] court did not adopt each contention\n\n\n       76   Id. at 540.\n       77 CP   at 2111.\n       78 The  letter purports to clarify the State's legal theories and then reconcile its\nclarified position with an earlier interrogatory answer: \"Mt is our position that the\nWashington Business Corporation Act requires a corporation to take certain actions\nthrough a meeting or through executed consents. If a meeting is held, then minutes\nmust be kept as permanent records. If a meeting is not held, and corporate actions are\napproved through executed consents, there is no requirement to prepare annual\nminutes... . We believe the State's response to Interrogatory No. 13 is consistent with\nthe State's Causes of Action as plead.\" CP at 2088, 2090.\n\n                                             20\n\fNo. 74978-1-1/21\n\nraised.'\"79 The trial court did not abuse its discretion in declining to require a\n\nsegregation.\n\n       We conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding $310,422.40\n\nfor the work performed by the State's four attorneys.\n\n       CRS also contends the trial court abused its discretion when it awarded fees for\n\nthe State's paralegal and investigator.\n\n       For the recovery of fees of nonlawyers, the court must consider six factors\n\nidentified in Absher Construction Co. v. Kent School District.80 The State's declarations\n\nregarding the work of its investigator and paralegal do not specify how the services\n\nperformed were legal in nature, whether they were supervised by an attorney, the\n\nqualifications of the person performing the work, or the reasonable community\n\nstandards for the nature of work. CRS adequately raised the need to document\n\nrequested fees. The trial court failed to address the governing factors.\n\n       We conclude the trial court abused its discretion when it included $10,405.80 for\n\nparalegal time and $16,764.90 for investigator time in the State's attorney fee award.\n\n\n\n\n        79 Martinez v.
