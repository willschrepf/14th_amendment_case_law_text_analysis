Stephens and Frank W. Cass formed an operating partnership known as\r\nStephens &amp; Cass.<span>  </span>The partnership\r\noperated properties which General Stephens and Frank Cass acquired individually.<span>  </span>From 1970 to 1977, the partnership\r\nsuccessfully drilled and operated approximately sixty to seventy wells located\r\nin Reagan, Upton, Glassock, and Midland Counties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In 1974, General\r\nStephens<span><span>=</span></span> health\r\nbegan to decline.<span>  </span>He suffered a broken\r\nhip and had to have surgery.<span>  </span>Over the\r\nnext two years, he had three more surgeries on his hip and eventually had to\r\nhave his hip replaced.<span>  </span>It appears that\r\nduring this period, General Stephens was not able to meaningfully participate\r\nin the daily activities of the partnership.<span> \r\n</span>By late 1977, Frank Cass desired to terminate his relationship with\r\nGeneral Stephens and bring his son Michael L. Cass into the business.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<span><br clear=\"all\">\r\n</span>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"Section3\">\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">On October 1,\r\n1977, General Stephens and Frank Cass entered into an <span><span>A</span></span>Agreement\r\nto Terminate<span><span>@</span></span> the\r\npartnership.<span>  </span>By this agreement, the two\r\nmen agreed to wind up the business by January 1, 1978.<span>  </span>They further agreed:<span>  </span>to notify all of the other joint interest\r\nowners that Stephens &amp; Cass had agreed to terminate their obligation as\r\noperator under the joint operating agreements (<span><span>A</span></span>JOAs<span><span>@</span></span>); that Mr. Cass would attempt to\r\nsucceed the partnership as operator; that if Mr. Cass succeeded in obtaining\r\nthe necessary votes under the JOAs, he would continue to operate the wells\r\npursuant to the existing agreements; that Stephens &amp; Cass would marshal and\r\ninventory all personal property owned by the partnership so that it could be\r\nvalued; and finally that the records of Stephens &amp; Cass would remain the\r\nproperty of both men and would be available to either one as required.<span>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Pursuant to the\r\nforegoing agreement and the various JOAs, formal written ballots were\r\nadministered, and Mr. Cass was elected operator by a majority-in-interest of\r\nthe well owners.<span>  </span>On January 1, 1978, Mr.\r\nCass and the General entered into a new operating agreement recognizing that\r\nMr. Cass had been elected operator.<span>  </span>In\r\n1980, Mr. Cass and General Stephens reached an agreement and assigned values to\r\nthe personal property which they jointly owned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In January of\r\n1979, the General slipped on a patch of ice outside his home and suffered a\r\nbroken back.<span>  </span>The General<span><span>=</span></span>s wife, Patricia Stephens, took him to\r\nthe hospital.<span>  </span>Apparently, he became\r\nover-medicated and slipped into a coma while at the hospital.<span>  </span>His air supply was cut off for a period of\r\ntime.<span>  </span>The General eventually recovered,\r\nbut developed a condition known as Pickwickian Syndrome which caused him to\r\nsleep excessively.<span>  </span>Mrs. Stephens\r\ntestified that her husband slept almost twenty hours a day from 1979 until his\r\ndeath in 1984.<span>  </span>During this time, the\r\nGeneral was unable to handle the vast majority of his financial affairs.<span>  </span>Mrs. Stephens helped pay bills, but she\r\ntestified that much of her husband<span><span>=</span></span>s\r\nmail went unopened and that he failed to pay taxes for three years before his\r\ndeath. </p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<span><br clear=\"all\">\r\n</span>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"Section4\">\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">After he became\r\noperator of the jointly-owned wells, Frank Cass threatened to resign on a\r\nnumber of occasions.<span>  </span>He did so because\r\nhe was discouraged by the working interest owners<span><span>=</span></span>\r\nfailure to timely pay their monthly joint interest bills (<span><span>A</span></span>JIBs<span><span>@</span></span>).<span>  </span>Mr. Cass related that he was being forced to\r\nput up his own money to pay vendors of the wells, and was losing money as the\r\noperator.<span>  </span>In 1979, he sent a letter to\r\nall working interest owners stating that he was resigning as operator under the\r\nJOAs.<span>  </span>The JOAs allowed an operator to\r\nresign, stating that all parties to the contract shall select by majority vote\r\nin interest a new operator.<span>  </span>Nothing more\r\nwas done or said about Mr. Cass<span><span>=</span></span>s\r\nresignation and he continued to operate the wells for another three years.<span>  </span>In 1982, Mr. Cass sent a letter notifying the\r\nworking interest owners that he was changing the operator<span><span>=</span></span>s name from his own to Cass Oil\r\nCompany, Inc.<span>  </span>From that point forward,\r\nall the working interest owners made their checks payable to Cass Oil Company,\r\nInc., instead of Frank Cass.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">On November 14,\r\n1983, Mr. Cass purchased certain undeveloped lease-hold acreage from General\r\nStephens.<span>  </span>These undrilled locations were\r\non the same leases as the jointly-owned wells (<span><span>A</span></span>the\r\nStephens wells<span><span>@</span></span>) and\r\nwere direct offsets to them.<span>  </span>The General\r\npassed away a few months after he executed those assignments.<span>  </span>After the General died, his properties passed\r\nto Mrs. Stephens, the Walter H.

analysis.<span> \r\n</span>The evidence clearly shows that Frank generally owned an interest of\r\n43.7 percent to 50 percent in the Cass companion wells, with his own family\r\nmembers owning the rest.<span>  </span>By contrast,\r\nFrank Cass generally owned smaller interests in the Stephens<span><span>=</span></span> wells--anywhere from a low of 12\r\npercent to a high of 50 percent--with the remaining interest owned by Stephens\r\nand various other persons.<span>  </span>Allocating\r\ncharges to an account in which an individual owns a smaller interest benefits\r\nhim economically.<span>  </span>If he bills $100 to an\r\naccount that he owns a 100 percent share in, he pays $100.<span>  </span>If he bills $100 to an account that he owns a\r\n50 percent share in, he pays $50.<span>  </span>If he\r\nmisallocates a bill of $100 to an account that he owns a 20 percent share in,\r\nrather than an account that he owns a 50 percent interest in, then he pays $20\r\nrather than $50.<span>  </span>The jury could properly\r\ninfer that Frank personally benefitted from the misallocation of expenses to\r\nthe Stephens<span><span>=</span></span>\r\nwells.<span>  </span>The jury was also at liberty to\r\nconsider the benefit which inured to Frank when his family received free goods\r\nand services at the

General Stephens made a $225,000 prepayment of expenses in\r\nDecember of 1983, and argues that it shows the General agreed with his\r\noperating procedures.<span>  </span>Finally, Frank\r\npoints to

his misconduct had Stephens requested to see\r\nthe records.<span>  </span>The jury was aware that\r\nFrank had not disclosed all of the records to Gruy, and that he attempted to\r\ndestroy evidence

the\r\ndocuments.<span>  </span>Frank<span><span>=</span></span>s\r\ntestimony that the General regularly discussed the joint interest bills with\r\nhim, and was knowledgeable about them, stands in strong contrast to the\r\nportrait of the General as weak, soporific, and unable to manage his financial\r\naffairs during the later years of his life.<span> \r\n</span>It was for the jury to resolve the conflicts in the evidence and to\r\nassess Frank<span><span>=</span></span>s\r\ncredibility.<span>  </span>The fact that the General\r\nprepaid his expenses permits an inference that the General

</span>On the contrary, Stephens<span><span>=</span></span> evidence supports an inference that\r\nshe would not have been able to detect many of the breaches of the operating\r\nagreements until after she recovered the trash documents.<span>  </span>Finally, the fact that Frank gave Stephens\r\nall the documents she requested, prior to the lawsuit, does not prove that\r\nFrank did not conceal his breaches of the operating agreements.<span>  </span>A review of the entire record demonstrates\r\nthat Frank presented his theory to the jury, and that the jury rejected his\r\nposition.<span>  </span>The jury was the sole judge of\r\nthe credibility of the witnesses, and it was their duty to resolve the\r\nconflicts in the evidence.<span>  </span>Accordingly,\r\nwe overrule

committed within the four-year limitations\r\nperiod.<span>  </span>Next, she obtained findings that\r\nshe could not have discovered the fraud before September 24, 1986, and that her\r\ndamages for the acts of fraud committed outside the limitations period were\r\n$33,164.23.<span>  </span>The findings that Frank and\r\nMichael converted jointly-owned equipment are similar to the

address\r\nFrank<span><span>=</span></span>s\r\nchallenges to the sufficiency of the evidence to support the discovery rule\r\nfindings on Stephens<span><span>=</span></span>\r\nfraud claims.<span>  </span>Frank once again argues\r\nthat Stephens failed to use reasonable diligence in ascertaining her causes of\r\naction against him.<span>  </span>He contends that\r\nStephens could have requested the records and discovered his fraudulent\r\nbehavior.<span>  </span>He asserts that his misconduct\r\nwas so obvious that it was inherently discoverable.<span>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">We have already\r\nconcluded that there was legally and factually sufficient evidence to support\r\nthe fraud findings against Frank.<span>  </span>In\r\nfinding fraud, the jury impliedly found that Frank knowingly made material\r\nmisrepresentations on the joint interest bills intending that the joint owners rely\r\non those misrepresentations.<span>  </span>Texas\r\ncourts have long adhered to the view that fraud vitiates whatever it touches,\r\nand have consistently held that a party will not be permitted to avail himself\r\nof the protection of a limitations statute when by his own fraud he has\r\nprevented the other party from seeking redress within the period of\r\nlimitations.<span>  </span><i>See Borderlon</i>, 661\r\nS.W.2d at 908-09.<span>  </span>To reward

avoid detection by failing to disclose information on the joint\r\ninterest billings, failing to disclose all documents to Gruy, and by his\r\ndestruction of evidence.<span>  </span>The jury was\r\nalso offered testimony that the fraud was not readily discoverable from the\r\njoint interest bills.<span>  </span>From this\r\nevidence, the jury rationally could have found that

class=\"MsoNormal\">Frank contends\r\nthat his conduct did not prejudice Stephens.<span> \r\n</span>First, he asserts that Stephens already had copies of the trash\r\ndocuments, and that the documents were produced to the Gruy auditors.<span>  </span>We disagree.<span> \r\n</span>One, there is no proof that Stephens had a copy of the documents that\r\nwere thrown away.<span>  </span>Two, Stephens put on\r\nevidence showing that the trash documents were not produced to Gruy.<span>  </span>Next, Frank asserts that Stephens was not\r\nprejudiced because the General agreed that the records could be destroyed.<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><sup><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><sup><span>[6]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span><span>  </span>We disagree.<span> \r\n</span>First, we point out that the trash documents were covered by a discovery\r\norder regardless of whether the General agreed to destroy an extra set of those\r\ndocuments.<span>  </span>Second, we note that the operating\r\nagreements required the operator to maintain a copy of the joint account\r\nrecords.<span>  </span>Thus, Frank had a duty as\r\noperator to maintain a copy of the records regarding the joint accounts\r\nregardless of the agreed destruction of the documents held in storage.<span>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Finally, Frank\r\ncomplains that the sanctions create a double recovery because the award\r\nincludes damages attributable to attorney<span><span>=</span></span>s\r\nfees.<span>  </span>We disagree.<span>  </span>Mr. Davis testified that the reasonable and\r\nnecessary attorney<span><span>=</span></span>s fees\r\nfor the whole case were $3 million.<span>  </span>The\r\njury awarded Stephens $1.4 million for the breach of contract claim alone.<span>  </span>Considering the numerous motions, the\r\nnumerous hearings on Stephens<span><span>=</span></span>\r\ndiscovery requests, the weeks of hearings on the motion for sanctions, and the\r\nappeal of the sanctions order, we conclude that the award of attorney<span><span>=</span></span>s fees was just.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<span><br clear=\"all\">\r\n</span>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"Section60\">\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In summary, we\r\nconclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by imposing\r\nsanctions.<span>  </span>The evidence shows that Frank\r\nfailed to comply with Stephens<span><span>=</span></span>\r\ndiscovery requests, that he violated the court<span><span>=</span></span>s\r\ndiscovery orders, and that he destroyed discoverable documents and\r\nrecords.<span>  </span>The record also contains\r\nevidence that Stephens incurred considerable expenses in recovering the trash\r\ndocuments and in pursuing Frank<span><span>=</span></span>s\r\ncompliance with the rules of procedure.<span> \r\n</span>We conclude that the sanctions were just as both a punishment for Frank<span><span>=</span></span>s bad faith conduct and as a future\r\ndeterrent against such conduct.<span>  </span>The\r\nsanctions were directly related to the offensive conduct and were not excessive\r\nconsidering the time, effort, and expense incurred by Stephens.<span>  </span>Accordingly, we overrule Frank<span><span>=</span></span>s sixth point of error.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b>CONCLUSION</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In summary, we\r\nconclude that the trial court did not err by admitting

findings\r\nexcept for punitive damages.<span>  </span>We affirm\r\nthe judgment of the trial court except that we reform the judgment to provide\r\nfor punitive damages of $300,000 against defendant

Stephens and Frank W. Cass formed an operating partnership known as\r\nStephens &amp; Cass.<span>  </span>The partnership\r\noperated properties which General Stephens and Frank Cass acquired individually.<span>  </span>From 1970 to 1977, the partnership\r\nsuccessfully drilled and operated approximately sixty to seventy wells located\r\nin Reagan, Upton, Glassock, and Midland Counties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In 1974, General\r\nStephens<span><span>=</span></span> health\r\nbegan to decline.<span>  </span>He suffered a broken\r\nhip and had to have surgery.<span>  </span>Over the\r\nnext two years, he had three more surgeries on his hip and eventually had to\r\nhave his hip replaced.<span>  </span>It appears that\r\nduring this period, General Stephens was not able to meaningfully participate\r\nin the daily activities of the partnership.<span> \r\n</span>By late 1977, Frank Cass desired to terminate his relationship with\r\nGeneral Stephens and bring his son Michael L.

field equipment business through high school and college.<span>  </span>In 1966, he graduated from McMurray College\r\nwith a B.B.A. with emphasis in accounting.<span> \r\n</span>He became a certified public accountant (<span><span>A</span></span>CPA<span><span>@</span></span>) in March of 1968.<span>  </span>After college, he worked for Arthur Anderson\r\n&amp; Company in Dallas, Texas, with clients engaged in the oil and gas, cement,\r\nmanufacturing, and processing industries.<span> \r\n</span>He then became Vice President of Finance and Controller of Harding\r\nBrothers Oil Company, a company engaged in drilling, completing, and operating\r\noil and gas wells.<span>  </span>Eldridge related that\r\nhe was responsible for all accounting functions, including billing on joint\r\ninterest accounts.<span>  </span>He was also\r\nresponsible for accounting for new and used equipment of a Harding affiliate\r\ncompany called Pipe &amp; Supply, Inc.<span> \r\n</span>After Harding, Eldridge worked for at least five other oil and gas\r\ncompanies.<span>  </span>His duties routinely required\r\nhim to handle accounting functions, joint interest billings, and tax\r\nmatters.<span>  </span>Next, Eldridge became managing\r\npartner and tax partner in charge of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, Midland,\r\nTexas.<span>  </span>There, he was responsible for the\r\nfirm<span><span>=</span></span>s due\r\ndiligence activities.<span>  </span>Since 1991, Mr.\r\nEldridge has been a solo practitioner and consultant.<span>  </span>In 1992, he also served as Bankruptcy Trustee\r\nfor an oil and gas company that operated about 550 oil and gas wells.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Eldridge explained\r\nthat he has performed joint interest audits of oil and gas operators for over\r\ntwenty years.<span>  </span>He spent approximately ten\r\nyears with companies that operated hundreds of oil and gas wells.<span>  </span>He related that he has extensive knowledge\r\nregarding operating agreements, title opinions, division of interest, joint\r\ninterest billings, revenue distribution, accounting, billing, and\r\ncollection.<span>  </span>He is a member of the\r\nCouncil of Petroleum Accountants Society (<span><span>A</span></span>COPAS<span><span>@</span></span>) and has served on the tax committee\r\nand the audit committee for the Permian Basin chapter.<span>  </span>COPAS is the recognized authority for the\r\npetroleum accounting industry and is responsible for promulgating accounting\r\nprocedures which are attached to virtually every operating agreement.<span>  </span>Eldridge is also a member of The American\r\nInstitute of Certified Public Accountants (<span><span>A</span></span>AICPA<span><span>@</span></span>), and the

therefore qualified to give an expert\r\nopinion as to whether the Cass Defendants complied with the proper accounting\r\nprocedures under the operating agreements.<span> \r\n</span>The proposed testimony was scientific, technical, and specialized.<span>  </span>The testimony of a petroleum accountant would\r\nhave clearly assisted the trier of fact to understand the evidence presented

admitting the testimony.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Casses\r\ncomplain, however, that <span><span>A</span></span>Eldridge\r\nemployed his own, self-invented, untested, and non-industry

of\r\naccounting is not recognized by any authority, is undefined, untested, and\r\nincapable of peer review because only Eldridge knows what the procedures\r\nentail.<span>  </span>Their claim is

Casses<span><span>=</span></span> motion.<span>  </span>The Casses reasserted their motion before\r\nEldridge began testifying.<span>  </span>The trial\r\ncourt overruled their objection.<span>  </span>On\r\ndirect examination during trial, Eldridge explained that the term <span><span>A</span></span>Contract Compliance Verification\r\nProcedures<span><span>@</span></span> was\r\ntaken from COPAS Bulletin Number 3, Paragraph B which states that an\r\nexpenditure audit of a joint account serves two main purposes:<span>  </span><i>verifying</i> and authenticating account\r\ncharges and assuring <i>compliance with the operating agreements</i>.<span>  </span>Throughout the litigation of this case,\r\nwhether it was during his deposition, the hearing on the motion to disqualify,\r\nor during the trial, Eldridge did not waiver in his testimony that he followed\r\naccepted accounting methods and standards.<span> \r\n</span>Specifically, he relied on COPAS Bulletin Numbers 3, 5, 8, 16, 23, and\r\n26, various pronouncements of AICPA, and the Rules of the Texas State Board of\r\nPublic Accounting.<span>  </span>These bulletins and\r\npronouncements are all recognized as authoritative and controlling in auditing\r\njoint interest accounts.<span>  </span>We conclude\r\nthat the trial court did not err by admitting Eldridge<span><span>=</span></span>s\r\ntestimony.<span>  </span>Accordingly, we overrule\r\nFrank and Michael<span><span>=</span></span>s general\r\ncomplaints that the trial court abused its

clear=\"all\">\r\n</span>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"Section25\">\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">From this\r\nevidence, a jury could rationally find that Frank used Cass Oil Company, Inc.\r\nto perpetuate a

showed up on the\r\njoint interest bills as apparently legitimate charges for operating\r\nexpenses.<span>  </span>The charges were material\r\nrepresentations that Stephens owed money for expenses which she in fact had not\r\nincurred.<span>  </span>A rational jury could have\r\nfound that Frank knowingly submitted the false bills from the fact that he\r\npersonally altered and signed many of the tickets and invoices which\r\nmisallocated the operating expenses.<span>  </span>It\r\nis also reasonable to infer that the bills were made with the intent that\r\nStephens rely upon them.<span>  </span>There is\r\nevidence that she in fact paid the bills to her detriment.<span>  </span>Viewed in the light most favorable, we\r\nconclude that there is legally sufficient evidence to support the

wells\r\nthan Appellees.<span>  </span>He points out that if\r\nthe Stephens<span><span>=</span></span> wells\r\nwere improperly charged, then he was improperly charged as well.<span>  </span>He also relies on Eldridge<span><span>=</span></span>s statement that he could not find any\r\nevidence that Frank personally received any money from the affiliate companies\r\nthat overcharged the Stephens<span><span>=</span></span>\r\nwells for goods and services.<span>  </span>Frank\r\nargues that there is no proof that any of the overcharges benefitted

</span>Assuming he paid the\r\ncharges, he is no doubt correct in asserting that he still had to pay a\r\nproportional share of the misapplied charges.<span> \r\n</span>But that does not end our analysis.<span> \r\n</span>The evidence clearly shows that Frank generally owned an interest of\r\n43.7 percent to 50 percent in the Cass companion wells, with his own family\r\nmembers owning the rest.<span>  </span>By contrast,\r\nFrank Cass generally owned smaller interests in the Stephens<span><span>=</span></span> wells--anywhere from a low of 12\r\npercent to a high of 50 percent--with the remaining interest owned by Stephens\r\nand various other persons.<span>  </span>Allocating\r\ncharges to an account in which an individual owns a smaller interest benefits\r\nhim economically.<span>  </span>If he bills $100 to an\r\naccount that he owns a 100 percent share in, he pays $100.<span>  </span>If he bills $100 to an account that he owns a\r\n50 percent share in, he pays $50.<span>  </span>If he\r\nmisallocates a bill of $100 to an account that he owns a 20 percent share in,\r\nrather than an account that he owns a 50 percent interest in, then he pays $20\r\nrather than $50.<span>  </span>The jury could properly\r\ninfer that Frank personally benefitted from the misallocation of expenses to\r\nthe Stephens<span><span>=</span></span>\r\nwells.<span>  </span>The jury was also at liberty to\r\nconsider the benefit which inured to Frank when his family received free goods\r\nand services at the expense of others.<span> \r\n</span>Having assayed all the evidence, we conclude that the evidence that\r\nsupports the jury<span><span>=</span></span>s verdict\r\nis not so weak as to be clearly wrong and manifestly unjust.<span>  </span>Frank<span><span>=</span></span>s\r\nfactual sufficiency complaint is overruled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In summary, we\r\nconclude that there is

General Stephens made a $225,000 prepayment of expenses in\r\nDecember of 1983, and argues that it shows the General agreed with his\r\noperating procedures.<span>  </span>Finally, Frank\r\npoints to

the conflicts in the evidence and to\r\nassess Frank<span><span>=</span></span>s\r\ncredibility.<span>  </span>The fact that the General\r\nprepaid his expenses permits an inference that the General

</span>On the contrary, Stephens<span><span>=</span></span> evidence supports an inference that\r\nshe would not have been able to detect many of the breaches of the operating\r\nagreements until

</span>The jury was the sole judge of\r\nthe credibility of the witnesses, and it was their duty to resolve the\r\nconflicts in the evidence.<span>  </span>Accordingly,\r\nwe overrule

committed within the four-year limitations\r\nperiod.<span>  </span>Next, she obtained findings that\r\nshe could not have discovered the fraud before September 24, 1986, and that her\r\ndamages for the acts of fraud committed outside the limitations period were\r\n$33,164.23.<span>  </span>The findings that Frank and\r\nMichael converted jointly-owned equipment are similar to the

</span>Frank once again argues\r\nthat Stephens failed to use reasonable diligence in ascertaining her causes of\r\naction against him.<span>  </span>He contends that\r\nStephens could have requested

class=\"MsoNormal\">We have already\r\nconcluded that there was legally and factually sufficient evidence to support\r\nthe fraud findings against Frank.<span>  </span>In\r\nfinding fraud, the jury impliedly found that Frank knowingly made material\r\nmisrepresentations on the joint interest bills intending that the joint owners rely\r\non those misrepresentations.<span>  </span>Texas\r\ncourts have long adhered to the view that fraud vitiates whatever it touches,\r\nand have consistently held that a party will not be permitted to avail himself\r\nof the protection of a limitations statute when by his own fraud he has\r\nprevented the other party from seeking redress within the period of\r\nlimitations.<span>  </span><i>See Borderlon</i>, 661\r\nS.W.2d at 908-09.<span>  </span>To reward

avoid detection by failing to disclose information on the joint\r\ninterest billings, failing to disclose all documents to Gruy, and by his\r\ndestruction of evidence.<span>  </span>The jury

maintain a copy of the joint account\r\nrecords.<span>  </span>Thus, Frank had a duty as\r\noperator to maintain a copy of the records regarding the joint accounts\r\nregardless of the agreed

attorney<span><span>=</span></span>s fees\r\nfor the whole case were $3 million.<span>  </span>The\r\njury awarded Stephens $1.4 million for the breach of contract claim alone.<span>  </span>Considering the numerous motions, the\r\nnumerous hearings on Stephens<span><span>=</span></span>\r\ndiscovery requests, the weeks of hearings on the motion for sanctions, and the\r\nappeal of

Frank<span><span>=</span></span>s\r\ncompliance with the rules of procedure.<span> \r\n</span>We conclude that the sanctions were just as both a punishment for Frank<span><span>=</span></span>s bad
