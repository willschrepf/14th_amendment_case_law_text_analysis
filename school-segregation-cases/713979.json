The Corinne A. Seeds University Elementary School (\"UES\"), and its research and training mission is to help the State of California meet the needs of a dramatically changing public school population. To this end, UES identifies issues relevant to the education and social development of children in multicultural, urban communities, conducts research on these issues, and develops innovations in teaching based on this research. UES shares its research results with public school teachers throughout the State of California through seminars, workshops, teacher training programs, and published articles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each year, UES's Admissions Committee, under the direction of the Dean of the Graduate School of Education and Information Studies and the Director of UES, determines what characteristics are needed in UES's 460-student population to fulfill its research and training mission. UES considers gender, race/ethnicity, and family income in its admissions process to obtain the desired student population. In selecting students, UES also considers other factors that might affect a child's suitability as a research subject, e.g., dominant language, permanence of residence, and parents' willingness to comply with UES's mandatory involvement requirement. Parents of students applying to UES are informed of UES's consideration of race/ethnicity, gender, and family income in admissions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Richard Hunter and Gina Brandt's older daughter Cia was admitted into UES through its admissions process. Apparently pleased with Cia's experience at UES, in 1995, the year after Cia graduated, they sought to enroll their younger daughter, Keeley. Keeley was not selected for admission.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> When notified that their daughter had not been admitted, Keeley's parents sued the Regents of the University of California  (\"Regents\") under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. section 2000(d), and Dr. Theodore Mitchell, Dean of the Graduate School of Education and Information Studies, under 42 U.S.C. section 1983.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The suit challenges the constitutionality of UES's admissions process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court conducted extensive hearings on the school's purpose, its research, and its admission process, and ultimately ruled in its favor. The district court found that (1) California had a compelling state interest in operating a research-oriented elementary school dedicated to improving the quality of education in urban public schools, and (2) UES's consideration of race/ethnicity in its admissions process was narrowly tailored to further that interest. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits a state from \"deny[ing] to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. \" U.S. Const. amend. XIV, S 1. The Supreme Court has said that \"any person, of whatever race, has the right to demand that any governmental actor subject to the Constitution justify any racial classification subjecting that person to unequal treatment under the strictest judicial scrutiny.\" Adarand Constructors, Inc., v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200, 224 (1995). To meet the strict scrutiny test, the Regents must demonstrate that UES's consideration of race/ethnicity is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest. See id.  at 227.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's conclusion that UES's admissions procedures meet the strict scrutiny test is based on extensive findings of fact which we review for clear error. See National Ass'n of Radiation Survivors v. Derwinski, 994 F.2d 583, 587 (9th Cir. 1993). After reviewing the entire record, we conclude that Judge Kenyon's findings of fact were not clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's conclusions regarding the sufficiency of those facts in meeting strict scrutiny is a mixed question of law and fact which we review de novo.

Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, 493 (1954). The Supreme Court has recognized \" `the public schools as a most vital civic institution for the preservation of a democratic system of government.' \" Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 221 (1982) (quoting SchoolDist. of Abington Township v. Schempp, 374 U.S. 203, 230 (1963) (Brennan, J., concurring)); see also Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 213 (1972) (\"Providing public schools ranks at the very apex of the function of a State.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court heard extensive expert testimony on current problems in public urban education. The challenges posed by California's increasingly diverse population intensify the state's interest in improving urban public schools. Cultural and economic differences in the classroom pose special problems for public school teachers. In his decision, Judge Kenyon noted that defendants presented \"an unexhaustive list of such issues and challenges [that ] includes limited language proficiency, different learning styles, involvement of parents from diverse cultures with different expectations and values, and racial and ethnic conflict among families and children.\" Dr. Mitchell,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> who testified as an expert witness, stated that \"[t]here is no more pressing problem facing California, or indeed the nation, than urban education; for it is in the urban school system that the majority of California's future citizens will be educated (either well or poorly), creating the basic fabric for the society of the future.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">UES is dedicated to providing more useful and more accurate information to educators facing these challenges. Dr. Deborah Stipek,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> director of UES, testified, \"[t]he current mission of UES is to do research relevant to . . . urban education and to disseminate that research to promote more effective education for children in urban schools.\" As part of its research mission, UES exchanges information with the State Department of Education as well as other California educational policy groups; trains teachers; develops and tests innovative teaching strategies; and disseminates study results nationwide.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Mitchell also testified that \"[t]he dynamic interplay of . . . research, dissemination, professional development, and  the training of an ever-expanding cadre of researchers dedicated to find[ing] the answers to the perplexing problems facing urban schools . . . makes UES a unique and powerful instrument in meeting the State's fundamental obligations to the children of its cities.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given this record, the district court concluded, and we agree, that \"the defendants' interest in operating a research oriented elementary school is compelling.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The dissent expresses some concern that, as a result of our decision, \"every stratum of a state's public education system  (whether formally designated a `laboratory school' or not) may now in the name of `research on effective educational strategies' implement a racially classified admission system.\" Infra at 11093-94. We do not share this concern.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is not UES's designation as a laboratory school that justifies its admission process. UES's status as a laboratory school with a research mission is not a designation without substance. UES's research is funded in part through federal and private grants and its students are protected by all federal, state, and university guidelines, rules, and policies pertaining to research involving human subjects. Research results are shared through \"a variety of publications, the television and film industries, computer technologies, and other media,\" as well as through \"seminars, workshops, observation opportunities, and conferences\" offered to teachers, administrators, researchers, and educational policy makers. Its research mission and its dissemination of information makes UES \"a center for the education and training of teachers and educational leaders.\" Through UES, \"nationally recognized scholars work together with educators and administrators to foster a better schooling system for California children.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor does UES's stated mission of \"educational research\" justify its admissions process. A mere statement from a governmental entity that it is committed to research, without more, would not be sufficient to establish a compelling interest. But research is fundamental to the UES's charter. The research mission affects the day-to day experience of its students and requires more resources than those available to most, if not all, other elementary schools. In 1995, UES's elementary school, with its population of 460 students, had a faculty of twenty-seven professors with doctorates in fields including psychology, education, and medicine. In addition, twenty-one graduate, doctoral, and post-doctoral students, three medical students, thirty-two nursing students, and seventy-five undergraduate student teachers were involved with the elementary school, observing, working with students, and conducting research.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All of these characteristics make UES an exceptional school and a valuable resource to California's public education system. Consequently, we do not share the dissent's concerns that this decision will lead to racial classification in \"every stratum of a state's public education system.\" Infra at 1075.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To complete our strict scrutiny analysis, we next address the question whether the district court correctly concluded that \"[t]he defendants have successfully proven that the use of racial and ethnic identity criteria in UES's admission policy is narrowly tailored to serve the purpose of a compelling state interest.\" (Emphasis added.) In support of this conclusion, the district court pointed to \"a parade of experts [who testified] about the necessity of a race-conscious admission policy at UES. Each expert's testimony was underscored by the belief that the State must `continue to conduct research on issues involving how children learn and how we can do a better job of teachingthem.' \" (quoting Dr. Harry Handler's<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> testimony).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Carollee Howes<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> testified that \"[t]here is a simple rule about being a researcher. . . . If you're trying to find a sample  that has some [particular] distribution of race, you use race as the variable to make that. You don't use an approximation or some variable of it.\" Dr. Stipek further testified that \"even if the applicant pool in the aggregate [was] sufficiently diverse, an entirely random selection would not yield a population that balances ethnicity with other factors, such as age, gender and family income.\" Dr. Handler also testified that\"[b]ecause ofthe small sample size, it is highly unlikely that such a small group, if selected without some explicit consideration of race/ ethnicity, would be representative of Los Angeles' or the State's urban school population.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court commented on the testimony presented:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court simply cannot hope to recount each of the particular innovative educational techniques developed at UES, or each of the specific studies conducted at UES, which rely on the diversity of the laboratory school's student population. Having examined the testimony of the defendants' witnesses, the Court is convinced that without a racially and ethnically diverse student population, the benefits to be gained by these innovations and studies would be lost.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the district court concluded that \"it would not be possible, nor would it be reasonable, to require the defendants to attempt to obtain an ethnically diverse representative sample of students without the use of specific racial targets and classifications.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The dissent suggests a number of alternatives to UES's current admissions process. These alternatives range from locating laboratory schools elsewhere to mandating laboratory conditions in public schools throughout California. See infra at 11098. But both Dr. Stipek and Dr. Handler testified that it was necessary to explicitly consider race/ethnicity in UES's admissions process to achieve the precise student population required for UES's research.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Therefore, even if California were to establish one or more other lab schools elsewhere,this would not address UES's need to maintain the representative sample of students UES needs to fulfill its research mission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, in evaluating whether UES's use of race/ethnicity in its admissions process is narrowly tailored, we recognize, as did the district court, that courts should defer to researchers' decisions about what they need for their research.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> The SupremeCourt has stated: \"Courts have stressed the importance of avoiding second-guessing of legitimate academic judgments. This Court itself has cautioned that`judges . . . asked to review the substance of a genuinely academic decision . . . should show great respect for the faculty's professional judgment.' \" University of Penn v. EEOC, 493 U.S. 182, 199 (1990) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the evidence in the record, we agree with the district court's determination that UES's use of race/ethnicity in its admissions process is narrowly tailored to achieve the necessary laboratory environment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">V.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, UES is a research-oriented institution dedicated to developing effective techniques for use in urban public schools--a project that benefits public school children throughout the state. California has a compelling interest in providing effective education to its diverse, multi-ethnic, public school population. UES's use of race/ethnicity in its admissions process is narrowly tailored to achieve the necessary laboratory environment to produce research results which can be used to improve the education of California's ethnically diverse urban public school population.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> There is no suggestion that any different admission procedures were employed in the process resulting in Keeley's rejection than in Cia's earlier acceptance.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Keeley was four years old when the suit was initiated.

Dr. Mitchell received a Ph.D. from Stanford University in 1983. He served as chair to Dartmouth's Department of Education, and Deputy to the President of Stanford University before becoming Dean of UCLA's Graduate School of Education in 1992. He has published numerous scholarly articles on education and school reform.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Dr. Stipek also testified as an expert witness. She received a Ph.D. in developmental psychology from Yale University. She has published numerous articles on early childhood and elementary education. She has been with the Graduate School of Education and Information Studies since 1977.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The appellant argues that only an interest in remedying past discrimination can justify UES use of race/ethnicity as one of a number of factors in its admissions process. We disagree. The Supreme Court has never held that only a state's interest in remedial action can meet strict scrutiny. In fact, in Miller v. Johnson, 515 U.S. 900 (1995), the Court expressly left open the question whether \"compliance with the[Voting Rights] Act, standing alone, can provide a compelling interest independent of any interest in remedying past discrimination.\" Id. at 921 (emphasis added). The Court in Shaw v. Hunt followed Miller and left this question open: \"In Miller, we expressly left open the question whether under the proper circumstances compliance with the Voting Rights Act, on its own, could be a compelling interest. Here once again we do not reach that question . . . .\" Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U.S. 899, 911 (1996) (internal citation and parenthetical omitted).</p>\n        <p>In addition, contrary to the dissent's assertion, this court has not \"held that `[r]ace based classifications must be reserved strictly for remedial settings.' \" Infra at 11085 (quoting Coral Construction v. King County, 941 F.2d 910, 920 (1991)). Rather, this court held that where the asserted state interest is remedying past discrimination, this remedial interest must be supported by concrete evidence of discrimination. See id; see also Monterey Mechanical v. Wilson, 125 F.3d 702, 714 (9th Cir. 1997) (same). In Coral and Monterey, this court simply followed the Supreme Court's decision in City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469 (1989), which required a \"strong basis in evidence\" for race-based remedial action. These holdings have no bearing on the question whether a non-remedial interest, such as the operation of a research-oriented elementary school dedicated to improving the quality of education in urban public schools, can serve as a compelling interest sufficient to survive strict scrutiny.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Dr. Harry Handler has a Ph.D. in Educational Psychology from the University of Southern California, and, at the time of his testimony, was Adjunct Professor and Special Assistant to the Graduate School of Education and Information Studies.

Hunt, 517 U.S. 899, 909 (1996) (\"Shaw II\"). For that interest to constitute a compelling governmental interest, it must satisfy two conditions. First, the discrimination must be specific, identified discrimination. See id.

In Croson, a plurality of the Supreme Court held that racial classifications are justified only when used to remedy the effects of racial discrimination. See Croson, 488 U.S. at 493 (O'Connor, J., joined by Rehnquist, C.J., and White and Kennedy, JJ.) (\"Classifications based on race carry a danger of stigmatic harm. Unless they are strictly reserved for remedial settings, they may in fact promote notions of racial inferiority and lead to a politics of racial hostility.\"). One year later, four members of the current Supreme Court reiterated this view: \"We subject even racial classifications claimed to be remedial to strict scrutiny . . . to ensure that the Government in fact employs any race-conscious measures to further this remedial interest [in redressing the effects of identified race discrimination] and employs them only when, and no more broadly than, the interest demands.\" Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v.

Cir. 1998) (noting, in the employment context, that \"[w]e do not think diversity can be elevated to the `compelling' level, particularly when the Court has given every indication of wanting to cut back Metro Broadcasting\"). Based on its review of the relevant Supreme Court caselaw, the Hopwood court even went so far as to state that \"nonremedial state interests will never justify racial classifications.\" Hopwood, 78 F.3d at 944.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Justice O'Connor's dissenting opinion in Metro  represented the view of four Justices. The majority opinion in Metro upheld the federal government's non-remedial interest in \"diversity of broadcast viewpoints\" only by applying intermediate scrutiny (which the Court believed appropriate for federal racial classifications). Metro has since been overruled, see Adarand, 515 U.S. at 225-27, in part because its application of intermediate scrutiny to federal racial classifications was inconsistent with the strict scrutiny applied to state racial classifications. In overruling Metro, Adarand did not specifically address the question whether \"diversity of broadcast viewpoints\" could count as a compelling governmental interest under strict scrutiny. See id. at 258-59 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (\"the question is not remotely presented in this case\"). Thus, the Metro dissent's thorough and thoughtful rejection of an asserted non-remedial governmental interest in \"diversity\" under strict scrutiny provides significantguidance on the question whether UES's asserted interests in educational research and academic freedom constitute compelling governmental interests.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The leitmotif of Justice O'Connor's dissent in Metro is best captured by the following: \"Social scientists may debate how peoples' thoughts and behavior reflect their background, but the Constitution provides that the Government may not allocate benefits and burdens among individuals based on the assumption that race or ethnicity determines how they act or think.\" Metro, 497 U.S. at 602 (O'Connor, J., joined by Rehnquist, C.J., and Scalia and Kennedy, JJ., dissenting). Racial classifications, \"whether providing benefits to or burdening particular racial or ethnic groups,\" are inherently pernicious because \"[t]hey endorse race-based reasoning and the conception of a Nation divided into racial blocs, thus contributing to an escalation of racial hostility and conflict.\" Id. at 603-04.

See Metro, 497 U.S. at 563-65 &amp; n.12.

History should teach greater humility.\" Id. at 609 (O'Connor, J., joined by Rehnquist, C.J., and Scalia and Kennedy, JJ., dissenting). \"Divorced from any remedial purpose and otherwise undefined, `benign' means only what shifting fashions and changing politics deem acceptable.\" Id. at 615.

See id. at 612; Wygant, 476 U.S. at 275 (plurality opinion) (noting \"the Court's focus on prior discrimination as the justification for, and the limitation on, a State's adoption of race-based remedies\"). A non-remedial \"interest in increasing the diversity of broadcast viewpoints is clearly not a compelling interest. It is simply too amorphous, too insubstantial, and too unrelated to any legitimate basis for employing racial classifications.\" Metro, 497 U.S. at 612 (O'Connor, J., joined by Rehnquist, C.J., and Scalia and Kennedy, JJ., dissenting).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Justice O'Connor's dissenting opinion excoriated the majority for \"too casually extend[ing] the justifications that might support racial classifications, beyond that of remedying past discrimination.\" Id. at 613. Justice O'Connor's opinion characterized \"diversity\" as \"certainly insufficiently weighty to justify tolerance\" of government-sponsored racial distinctions; indeed, to accept \"diversity\" as a justification would be to \"trivialize[ ] the constitutional command to guard against such discrimination.\" Id. Of particular concern was the possibility that, \"[l]ike the vague assertion of societal discrimination, a claim of insufficiently diverse broadcasting viewpoints might be used to justify . . . unconstrained racial preferences . . .

See Shaw II, 517 U.S. at 909. The Court requires such showings to ensure that racial classifications will have \"only limited and carefully defined uses.\" Metro, 497 U.S. at 613 (O'Connor, J., joined by Rehnquist, C.J., and Scalia and Kennedy, JJ., dissenting). For example, discussing Justice Powell's opinion in Bakke, the Court in Croson highlighted the contrast between the \"focused\" goal of remedying \"specific instances of racial discrimination\" and the comparatively \"amorphous concept of injury\" inherent in \"societal discrimination\" that \"may be ageless in its reach into the past.\" Croson, 488 U.S. at 496-97 (plurality opinion) (internal quotation marks omitted). The idea of \"societal discrimination\" \"does little to define the scope of any injury . . . [and] could justify a preference of any size or duration.\" Id. at 505. Likewise in Wygant, the Court rejected the asserted interest in providing minority role models to redress societal discrimination because such a rationale would allow remedies \"timeless in their ability to affect the future.\" Wygant , 476 U.S. at 276 (plurality opinion).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To prevent such an unbridled use of racial classifications, the Court has imposed rigorous evidentiary safeguards: any governmental entity endeavoring to classify by race must point to specific, identified instances of past or present dis-crimination, Shaw II, 517 U.S. at 909, for which that governmental entity has been either actively or passively responsible, Croson, 488 U.S. at 482-84, 490-91; and that governmental entity must come forward with \"a strong basis in evidence for its conclusion that remedial action was necessary.\" Wygant, 476 U.S. at 277 (plurality opinion); Bakke, 438 U.S. at 308-09 (Powell, J.)

Such findings also serve to assure all citizens that the deviation from the norm of equal treatment of all racial and ethnic groups is a temporary matter, a measure taken in the service of the goal of equality itself.

In the face of such a powerful constitutional proscription, UES's novel justifications quickly wither. So \"noxious, \" Adarand, 515 U.S. at 241 (Thomas, J., concurring), so \"odious,\" Hirabayashi, 320 U.S. at 100, are racial classifications in our constitutional democracy, that four members of the current Supreme Court have held that they have absolutely no place except in the most narrowly defined remedial settings.

Further, as best one can discern, the rationales based on the race-based \"learning styles\" of children, the desire to publish and disseminate research results,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a> and the need to train future researchers and teachers, all appear to require only some general level of racial/ethnic diversity. Appellees' expert witnesses testified, for example, that: UES requires \"a diversity comparable in rough terms to urban schools\" (Professor Saxe) (emphasis supplied); \"it is imperative that UES have a student population that is perceived and accepted as being representative of the population in the public schools\" (Professor Handler) (emphasis supplied); UES needs \"the kind of diverse populations that challenge . . . schools all over the state\" (Professor Gallimore) (emphasis supplied). Professor Stipek, director of UES, testified that the required \"diversity\" at UES would need to include some unspecified \"critical mass\" of each significant ethnic group represented in the urban school population, but conceded that she could not \"give specific percentages.\" Plainly, this need for some undefined level of racial/ethnic diversity at UES bears scant relation, let alone the constitutionally required \"exact connection, \" Adarand, 515 U.S. at 229 (internal quotation marks omitted), to the use of a racial/ethnic quota system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The rationale premised on the need for racial/ethnic diversity in specific studies conducted at UES also lacks any kind of connection to the racial/ethnic quotas used. The only studies mentioned by appellees' expert witnesses were a bilingual research project involving native Spanish and English speaking students, and an instructional program being developed on the Harlem Renaissance. The bilingual study only requires the selection of children based on their native language, and is therefore irrelevant to any purported need for racial/ethnic diversity or racial quotas. The Harlem Renaissance project is geared solely toward African-American students and it does not, even by its own terms, require any specific number of those students. Thus, it, too, lacks any connection to UES's asserted need for a set number of students from different racial/ethnic groups.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, UES's utilization of a mixed-race category is a \"red flag[ ]\" signaling that its admissions procedure \"is not, as the Equal Protection Clause requires, narrowly tailored.\" Monterey Mech., 125 F.3d at 714. Indeed, UES's racially classified admissions system is over inclusive. The theory underlying UES's research mission is, in important part, that a child's race/ethnicity is specifically tied to a distinct \"learning style.\" But if this is true, the targeted selection of mixed-race children is incomprehensible -how could such a theory possibly require the selection of mixed-race students? Use of this puzzling category is compelling evidence that UES's admissions method is not narrowly tailored. Cf. Croson, 488 U.S. at 506 (\"random inclusion of racial groups that . . . may never have suffered from discrimination . . . strongly impugns the city's claim of remedial motivation\"); Wygant, 476 U.S. at 284 n.13 (plurality opinion) (\"The Board's definitionof minority to include blacks, Orientals, American Indians, and persons of Spanish descent further illustrates the undifferentiated nature of the plan.\") (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellees only attempted justification for the anomalous presence of a mixed-race category in UES's admission procedures came from Professor Stipek.

This explanation manifestly fails to explain how the theory of race-specific \"learning styles\" justifies the selection of mixed-race students.

To this end, UES identifies issues relevant to the education and social development of children in multicultural, urban communities, conducts research on these issues, and develops innovations in teaching based on this research.

In selecting students, UES also considers other factors that might affect a child's suitability as a research subject, e.g., dominant language, permanence of residence, and parents' willingness to comply with UES's mandatory involvement requirement.

Cultural and economic differences in the classroom pose special problems for public school teachers. In his decision, Judge Kenyon noted that defendants presented \"an unexhaustive list of such issues and challenges [that ] includes limited language proficiency, different learning styles, involvement of parents from diverse cultures with different expectations and values, and racial and ethnic conflict among families and children.\" Dr. Mitchell,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> who testified as an expert witness, stated that \"[t]here is no more pressing problem facing California, or indeed the nation, than urban education; for it is in the urban school system that the majority of California's future citizens will be educated (either well or poorly), creating the basic fabric for the society of the future.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">UES is dedicated to providing more useful and more accurate information to educators facing these challenges.

We do not share this concern.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is not UES's designation as a laboratory school that justifies its admission process. UES's status as a laboratory school with a research mission is not a designation without substance. UES's research is funded in part through federal and private grants and its students are protected by all federal, state, and university guidelines, rules, and policies pertaining to research involving human subjects. Research results are shared through \"a variety of publications, the television and film industries, computer technologies, and other media,\" as well as through \"seminars, workshops, observation opportunities, and conferences\" offered to teachers, administrators, researchers, and educational policy makers. Its research mission and its dissemination of information makes UES \"a center for the education and training of teachers and educational leaders.\" Through UES, \"nationally recognized scholars work together with educators and administrators to foster a better schooling system for California children.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor does UES's stated mission of \"educational research\" justify its admissions process. A mere statement from a governmental entity that it is committed to research, without more, would not be sufficient to establish a compelling interest. But research is fundamental to the UES's charter. The research mission affects the day-to day experience of its students and requires more resources than those available to most, if not all, other elementary schools. In 1995, UES's elementary school, with its population of 460 students, had a faculty of twenty-seven professors with doctorates in fields including psychology, education, and medicine. In addition, twenty-one graduate, doctoral, and post-doctoral students, three medical students, thirty-two nursing students, and seventy-five undergraduate student teachers were involved with the elementary school, observing, working with students, and conducting research.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All of these characteristics make UES an exceptional school and a valuable resource to California's public education system.

In support of this conclusion, the district court pointed to \"a parade of experts [who testified] about the necessity of a race-conscious admission policy at UES.

The majority opinion in Metro upheld the federal government's non-remedial interest in \"diversity of broadcast viewpoints\" only by applying intermediate scrutiny (which the Court believed appropriate for federal racial classifications). Metro has since been overruled, see Adarand, 515 U.S. at 225-27, in part because its application of intermediate scrutiny to federal racial classifications was inconsistent with the strict scrutiny applied to state racial classifications. In overruling Metro, Adarand did not specifically address the question whether \"diversity of broadcast viewpoints\" could count as a compelling governmental interest under strict scrutiny. See id. at 258-59 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (\"the question is not remotely presented in this case\"). Thus, the Metro dissent's thorough and thoughtful rejection of an asserted non-remedial governmental interest in \"diversity\" under strict scrutiny provides significantguidance on the question whether UES's asserted interests in educational research and academic freedom constitute compelling governmental interests.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The leitmotif of Justice O'Connor's dissent in Metro is best captured by the following: \"Social scientists may debate how peoples' thoughts and behavior reflect their background, but the Constitution provides that the Government may not allocate benefits and burdens among individuals based on the assumption that race or ethnicity determines how they act or think.\" Metro, 497 U.S. at 602 (O'Connor, J., joined by Rehnquist, C.J., and Scalia and Kennedy, JJ., dissenting). Racial classifications, \"whether providing benefits to or burdening particular racial or ethnic groups,\" are inherently pernicious because \"[t]hey endorse race-based reasoning and the conception of a Nation divided into racial blocs, thus contributing to an escalation of racial hostility and conflict.\" Id. at 603-04.

See Metro, 497 U.S. at 563-65 &amp; n.12. The dissenters found this cold comfort, noting that\"[t]he Court's emphasis on `benign racial classifications' suggests confidence in its ability to distinguish good from harmful governmental uses of racial criteria. History should teach greater humility.\" Id. at 609 (O'Connor, J., joined by Rehnquist, C.J., and Scalia and Kennedy, JJ., dissenting). \"Divorced from any remedial purpose and otherwise undefined, `benign' means only what shifting fashions and changing politics deem acceptable.\" Id. at 615.

See id. at 612; Wygant, 476 U.S. at 275 (plurality opinion) (noting \"the Court's focus on prior discrimination as the justification for, and the limitation on, a State's adoption of race-based remedies\"). A non-remedial \"interest in increasing the diversity of broadcast viewpoints is clearly not a compelling interest.

Of particular concern was the possibility that, \"[l]ike the vague assertion of societal discrimination, a claim of insufficiently diverse broadcasting viewpoints might be used to justify . . . unconstrained racial preferences . . .

See Shaw II, 517 U.S. at 909. The Court requires such showings to ensure that racial classifications will have \"only limited and carefully defined uses.\" Metro, 497 U.S. at 613 (O'Connor, J., joined by Rehnquist, C.J., and Scalia and Kennedy, JJ., dissenting). For example, discussing Justice Powell's opinion in Bakke, the Court in Croson highlighted the contrast between the \"focused\" goal of remedying \"specific instances of racial discrimination\" and the comparatively \"amorphous concept of injury\" inherent in \"societal discrimination\" that \"may be ageless in its reach into the past.\" Croson, 488 U.S. at 496-97 (plurality opinion) (internal quotation marks omitted). The idea of \"societal discrimination\" \"does little to define the scope of any injury . . . [and] could justify a preference of any size or duration.\" Id. at 505. Likewise in Wygant, the Court rejected the asserted interest in providing minority role models to redress societal discrimination because such a rationale would allow remedies \"timeless in their ability to affect the future.\" Wygant , 476 U.S. at 276 (plurality opinion).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To prevent such an unbridled use of racial classifications, the Court has imposed rigorous evidentiary safeguards: any governmental entity endeavoring to classify by race must point to specific, identified instances of past or present dis-crimination, Shaw II, 517 U.S. at 909, for which that governmental entity has been either actively or passively responsible, Croson, 488 U.S. at 482-84, 490-91; and that governmental entity must come forward with \"a strong basis in evidence for its conclusion that remedial action was necessary.\" Wygant, 476 U.S. at 277 (plurality opinion); Bakke, 438 U.S. at 308-09 (Powell, J.)

In the face of such a powerful constitutional proscription, UES's novel justifications quickly wither. So \"noxious, \" Adarand, 515 U.S. at 241 (Thomas, J., concurring), so \"odious,\" Hirabayashi, 320 U.S. at 100, are racial classifications in our constitutional democracy, that four members of the current Supreme Court have held that they have absolutely no place except in the most narrowly defined remedial settings. See Croson, 488 U.S. at 493 (O'Connor, J., joined by Rehnquist, C.J., and White and Kennedy, JJ.); id. at 524 (Scalia, J., concurring).

Hunter, 971 F. Supp. at 1332.

Further, as best one can discern, the rationales based on the race-based \"learning styles\" of children, the desire to publish and disseminate research results,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a> and the need to train future researchers and teachers, all appear to require only some general level of racial/ethnic diversity. Appellees' expert witnesses testified, for example, that: UES requires \"a diversity comparable in rough terms to urban schools\" (Professor Saxe) (emphasis supplied); \"it is imperative that UES have a student population that is perceived and accepted as being representative of the population in the public schools\" (Professor Handler) (emphasis supplied); UES needs \"the kind of diverse populations that challenge . . . schools all over the state\" (Professor Gallimore) (emphasis supplied). Professor Stipek, director of UES, testified that the required \"diversity\" at UES would need to include some unspecified \"critical mass\" of each significant ethnic group represented in the urban school population, but conceded that she could not \"give specific percentages.\" Plainly, this need for some undefined level of racial/ethnic diversity at UES bears scant relation, let alone the constitutionally required \"exact connection, \" Adarand, 515 U.S. at 229 (internal quotation marks omitted), to the use of a racial/ethnic quota system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The rationale premised on the need for racial/ethnic diversity in specific studies conducted at UES also lacks any kind of connection to the racial/ethnic quotas used. The only studies mentioned by appellees' expert witnesses were a bilingual research project involving native Spanish and English speaking students, and an instructional program being developed on the Harlem Renaissance. The bilingual study only requires the selection of children based on their native language, and is therefore irrelevant to any purported need for racial/ethnic diversity or racial quotas. The Harlem Renaissance project is geared solely toward African-American students and it does not, even by its own terms, require any specific number of those students. Thus, it, too, lacks any connection to UES's asserted need for a set number of students from different racial/ethnic groups.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, UES's utilization of a mixed-race category is a \"red flag[ ]\" signaling that its admissions procedure \"is not, as the Equal Protection Clause requires, narrowly tailored.\" Monterey Mech., 125 F.3d at 714. Indeed, UES's racially classified admissions system is over inclusive. The theory underlying UES's research mission is, in important part, that a child's race/ethnicity is specifically tied to a distinct \"learning style.\" But if this is true, the targeted selection of mixed-race children is incomprehensible -how could such a theory possibly require the selection of mixed-race students? Use of this puzzling category is compelling evidence that UES's admissions method is not narrowly tailored. Cf. Croson, 488 U.S. at 506 (\"random inclusion of racial groups that . . . may never have suffered from discrimination . . . strongly impugns the city's claim of remedial motivation\"); Wygant, 476 U.S. at 284 n.13 (plurality opinion) (\"The Board's definitionof minority to include blacks, Orientals, American Indians, and persons of Spanish descent further illustrates the undifferentiated nature of the plan.\") (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellees only attempted justification for the anomalous presence of a mixed-race category in UES's admission procedures came from Professor Stipek. She claimed that \"many children identified in California statistics in a single ethnic category are in fact of mixed ethnicities,\" and noted that \"researchers . . . as well as government organizations . . . are working on alternative strategies to collect ethnicity data that do not force individuals into single categories. \" Accordingly, Professor Stipek explained that it was \"inappropriate\" to require multi-ethnic applicants to choose just one racial/ethnic category. This explanation manifestly fails to explain how the theory of race-specific \"learning styles\" justifies the selection of mixed-race students. The use of a mixed-race category in UES's admissions procedure is simply irreconcilable with the \"onerous `narrowly tailored' requirement,\" Wygant, 476 U.S. at 294 (O'Connor, J., concurring).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I would reverse the judgment of the district court.

Croson, 488 U.S. at 507 (\"it is almost impossible to assess whether the Richmond Plan is narrowly tailored to remedy prior discrimination since it is not linked to identified discrimination in any way\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn18\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18_ref\">18</a>\n        <p> According to Professor Stipek, one of appellees' expert witnesses at trial, \"[e]thnicity is an important variable in research related to education because there is evidence that children with different ethnic backgrounds often have different learning styles, respond differently to the same instructional approaches and have different styles of interaction with the teacher.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn19\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19_ref\">19</a>\n        <p> The district court did not make a specific finding on this discrete question. The closest it came was to make the undifferentiated statement that an ethnically diverse student population presents \"issues and challenges [that] include[ ] limited language proficiency, different learning styles, involvement of parents from diverse cultures with different expectations and values and racial and ethnic conflict among families and children.\" Hunter, 971 F. Supp. at 1328-29. To the extent that this statement could be construed as containing a finding of fact that any particular race/ ethnicity is inextricably linked to any particular \"learning style,\" such a finding is, on this record, clearly erroneous. More broadly, the \"premise that differences in race . . . reflect real differences . . . is utterly irrational and repugnant to the principles of a free and democratic society.\" Metro, 497 U.S. at 618 (O'Connor, J., joined by Rehnquist, C.J., and Scalia and Kennedy, JJ., dissenting) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn20\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20_ref\">20</a>\n        <p> It bears emphasis that, although the majority opinion in Metro accepted the approximate fit of means (the FCC's race-based preferential licensing policy) to ends (diversity of broadcast viewpoints), it did so only through the use of intermediate scrutiny. Strict scrutiny may well have led to a different majority opinion.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn21\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21_ref\">21</a>\n        <p> According to Mitchell, three other University of California campuses (i.e., San Diego, Santa Cruz and Irvine) are presently discussing plans to build their own research-oriented laboratory schools. He testified, however, that he \"ha[d] no idea\" whether the naturally occurring diversity around those campuses would produce a sufficiently diverse applicant pool to obviate the need for racial quotas. Mitchell also testified that he \"ha[d] not undertaken to ask the question [whether] any of the other nine campuses of the University of California\" outside of UCLA are sufficiently diverse to eliminate the need for racial quotas.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn22\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22_ref\">22</a>\n        <p> The district court's conclusion that this race-neutral alternative was unavailable presents a mixed question of law and fact that we review de novo.

For example, as appellant notes, the California legislature enacted the Charter Schools Act of 1992, Cal. Ed.

Although appellees' witnesses preferred to characterize these numbers as \"general targets\" or \"general goals,\" rather than outright quotas, UES \"appeared to be especially adept at meeting its yearly `goals.' \" Hopwood, 78 F.3d at 948 n.36. UES did so, as Professor Stipek explained, by translating any \"goal\" into a \"specific number\" in the course of making admissions decisions.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn28\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28_ref\">28</a>\n        <p> The publication and dissemination rationales are based on the need to maintain credibility among the academic and teaching communities.
