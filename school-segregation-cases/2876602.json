The State argues that the\nfee award should be reduced because the Jenkins Class failed to prevent\ndismissal of the State from the litigation.       The district court found that\nthe issues were interrelated, Order of       March 27, 1997, slip op. at 7,\n\n\n\n\n      1\n       The Jenkins Class has moved to vacate the stay of execution.

The district court\nfound that the Jenkins Class had won \"substantial relief\" in the hearing\nand that the results could not be characterized as \"only limited success.\"\nId. at 7.     The district court found that the Jenkins Class was in a\ndefensive posture on these inter-related claims, slip op. at 6, which\nweighed in favor of awarding them fees under Association        for Retarded\nCitizens v. Schafer, 83 F.3d 1008, 1011 (8th Cir. ), cert. denied, 117 S.\nCt. 482 (1996).    The district court's order on the motions for unitariness\nand approval of the agreement demonstrates the close inter-relationship\nbetween the issues pertaining to unitary status and approval of the\nsettlement.     Indeed, the district court's findings that the achievement\ngap had not been remedied, but was to be remedied within three years, and\nthat the Green2 factors, with the exception of extracurricular activities,\nwould be unitary within two or three years, were essentially the factual\nfindings undergirding the district court's approval of the settlement\nbetween the State and the KCMSD.         The Jenkins Class prevailed on the\nunitariness issue, and we affirmed the district court's judgment.          We\ncannot conclude that the district court erred in finding the Jenkins Class\nhad earned \"substantial relief\" and was entitled to a fully compensatory\nfee.\n\n\n       The State argues that the district court erred in allowing the\nshifting of expert witness fees, contrary to West Virginia University\nHospitals, Inc. v. Casey, 499 U.S. 83 (1991). The district court's order\nrecited that plaintiffs had not claimed $17,359.10 in expert expenses that\nclearly related to litigation.      Order of March 27, 1997, slip op.\n\n\n\n\n       2\n        Green v. County School Bd., 391 U.S. 430 (1968).\n                                       -4-\n\fat 9-10.    The State specifically objected to a fee of $982.50 for Robert\nThaler's work in computational assistance for preparing an analysis of the\nvestiges of segregation for Dr. Robert Crain, and $11,275.00 for Dr. Crain\nand   his   associates   for   work   that   included     scale    construction     and\npreparation of charts.     With respect to Thaler's services, the district\ncourt stated that the work was completed in December and included helping\nDr. Crain in analyzing the vestiges of prior discrimination.               Slip op. at\n10.   As one of the Jenkins Class's duties was assessing the status of              the\nKCMSD to monitor racial balance and racial attitudes, the court found that\nthis expense was a reasonable cost for those monitoring activities.                Id.\nat 11.   With respect to the request for the work done by Dr. Robert Crain,\nthe court reduced the request by $1,000 for preparation of charts, which\nwas   clearly   litigation-related     activity,    and    found    that    the   other\ncategories of expense, $10,275, were reasonable monitoring activities.              The\ncourt allowed a payment of $1,380 for a video production that the Jenkins\nClass counsel used at the unitariness hearing.            It found that the video\nshowed a teaching method that the Jenkins Class had mentioned throughout\nthe proceedings, and the video was useful because it gave form and\nsubstance to an abstract teaching method.          Id. at 11-12.\n\n\n      The State argues that the expert witness fees of Dr. Crain are not\nrecoverable because 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988 (b) (1994), as interpreted in Casey,\ngives no authority to shift expert fees for either testimonial or non-\ntestimonial work.   We are persuaded, however, that the district court did\nnot err in concluding that Dr. Crain's work was monitoring activity, which\nthe Jenkins Class has the responsibility to conduct and for which it has\nthe right to be compensated.     See Jenkins v. Missouri, 967 F.2d 1248, 1251\n(8th Cir. 1992) (\"Monitoring implementation of the remedy is a crucial part\nof the plaintiffs' function in these cases . . .\").\n\n\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\f      The State also appeals the award of 13.5 hours for legal research on\nthe   Equal Educational Opportunities Act.   These fees total $877.50.   The\ndistrict court found that attorneys often research different courses to\nfollow in litigation efforts, and the hours were not excessive for a path\nthat \"did not lead where plaintiffs thought it might.\"   Order of March 27,\n1997, slip op. at 9.   We reject the State's argument.\n\n\n      We affirm the fees awarded for the first, second and third quarters\nof Year XII in the amounts which we have catalogued above.\n\n      A true copy.\n\n            Attest:\n\n                 CLERK, U.S. COURT OF APPEALS, EIGHTH CIRCUIT.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\f",

The district court's order\nrecited that plaintiffs had not claimed $17,359.10 in expert expenses that\nclearly related to litigation.      Order of March 27, 1997, slip op.\n\n\n\n\n       2\n        Green v. County School Bd., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107705\"><a href=\"/opinion/107705/green-v-county-school-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">430</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1968).\n                                       -4-\n\fat 9-10.    The State specifically objected to a fee of $982.50 for Robert\nThaler's work in computational assistance for preparing an analysis of the\nvestiges of segregation for Dr. Robert Crain, and $11,275.00 for Dr. Crain\nand   his   associates   for   work   that   included     scale    construction     and\npreparation of charts.     With respect to Thaler's services, the district\ncourt stated that the work was completed in December and included helping\nDr. Crain in analyzing the vestiges of prior discrimination.               Slip op. at\n10.   As one of the Jenkins Class's duties was assessing the status of              the\nKCMSD to monitor racial balance and racial attitudes, the court found that\nthis expense was a reasonable cost for those monitoring activities.                Id.\nat 11.   With respect to the request for the work done by Dr. Robert Crain,\nthe court reduced the request by $1,000 for preparation of charts, which\nwas   clearly   litigation-related     activity,    and    found    that    the   other\ncategories of expense, $10,275, were reasonable monitoring activities.              The\ncourt allowed a payment of $1,380 for a video production that the Jenkins\nClass counsel used at the unitariness hearing.            It found that the video\nshowed a teaching method that the Jenkins Class had mentioned throughout\nthe proceedings, and the video was useful because it gave form and\nsubstance to an abstract teaching method.          Id. at 11-12.\n\n\n      The State argues that the expert witness fees of Dr. Crain are not\nrecoverable because 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988 (b) (1994), as interpreted in Casey,\ngives no authority to shift expert fees for either testimonial or non-\ntestimonial work.   We are persuaded, however, that the district court did\nnot err in concluding that Dr. Crain's work was monitoring activity, which\nthe Jenkins Class has the responsibility to conduct and for which it has\nthe right to be compensated.
