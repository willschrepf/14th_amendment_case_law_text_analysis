The\r\ntrial judge entered findings of fact and conclusions of law and recommended that relief be\r\ndenied.  We have reviewed the record, and we adopt the trial judge's findings and conclusions. \r\nTherefore, we deny relief.  We also dismiss applicant's \"Motion to Consider Additional\r\nEvidence of Mental Retardation\" because that supplemental material was improperly and\r\nuntimely filed with this Court instead of the convicting court.  Article 11.071<sup> (1)</sup> does not\r\nauthorize piecemeal submission of evidence, nor does it permit the original filing of evidence\r\nwith this Court rather than the convicting court.  Because the trial judge's written findings were\r\nso thorough and complete, we need discuss only applicant's mental- retardation claim and the\r\nmotions applicant filed directly in this Court.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span>I.\tApplicant was indicted for the robbery and murder of Geraldine Davidson on January\r\n26, 2000.  In November 2002, a jury convicted him of that capital murder and, based upon the\r\njury's answers to the punishment special issues, the trial judge sentenced applicant to death. \r\n </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe evidence at trial showed that the 20-year-old applicant, a member of the Southside\r\nCryps gang, planned and executed a burglary at the Palestine, Texas, home of Mrs. Davidson,\r\nan 84-year-old widow and retired teacher.  He had burglarized Mrs. Davidson's home before,\r\nbut this time he enlisted the aid of his sixteen-year-old wife and thirteen-year-old cousin.  Mrs.\r\nDavidson returned home during the burglary, so applicant and his cohorts tied her up with duct\r\ntape, put her into the trunk of her car, and then spent the afternoon driving around in her car\r\nbuying and smoking formaldehyde-laced marijuana cigars.   Later, they picked up applicant's\r\nyounger brother and stopped at a Jack-in-the-Box, where applicant sent the others inside to buy\r\nfood while he waited, outside surveillance camera range, in Mrs. Davidson's car.  After the\r\nfoursome ate and </span><span>smoked more marijuana, applicant drove the car to the Neches River.  He and\r\nhis younger brother pulled Mrs. Davidson out of the trunk, tied her legs to a cinder block, beat\r\nher with her gardening shovel, kicked her in the head, and finally threw her in the river to\r\ndrown.  After dropping off his three cohorts, applicant \"rented\" Mrs. Davidson's car to friends\r\nin return for two rocks of crack cocaine.  His friends were later pulled over in Mrs. Davidson's\r\ncar, and they told the police about applicant \"renting\" them the stolen car.  Police came to\r\napplicant's house to arrest him but he fled.  The officers arrested applicant later that day, after\r\nhe and his brother were found hiding in a neighborhood \"dope house.\"  Applicant was wearing\r\nMrs. Davidson's gold wedding ring when he was booked into jail.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe affirmed applicant's conviction and sentence on direct appeal.<sup> (2)</sup>  Meanwhile, on\r\nDecember 3, 2002, applicant filed his original writ of habeas corpus with the presiding judge\r\nof the convicting court.<sup> (3)</sup>  Accompanying his writ application were two volumes of material,\r\nincluding various affidavits, treatise excerpts in support of his mental-retardation claim,\r\ndocuments from the underlying trial, and published law review and behavioral science articles. \r\nThe State filed its response five months later.  On June 23, 2003, after consulting with the\r\nattorneys, the trial judge entered an order that found that there were no factual issues that could\r\nnot be resolved by using the trial record and the written writ materials.  Thus he decided that\r\na live evidentiary hearing was unnecessary.  He ordered both the State and applicant to file\r\nproposed findings of fact and conclusions of law.  On July 14, 2003, applicant filed an\r\nadditional affidavit by Dr. Windel Dickerson who, based on a personal examination of applicant\r\nand his review of  various other materials, concluded that applicant was mildly mentally\r\nretarded.  Two weeks later the trial judge signed an order permitting both the State and\r\napplicant to acquire and file additional educational records for applicant.  On that same day, the\r\ntrial judge denied applicant's proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law and signed the\r\nState's proposed findings.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn August 7, 2003, applicant's special-education records were filed with the convicting\r\ncourt, and, one month later, applicant filed a videotaped statement made by Dr. Dickerson.<sup> (4)</sup> \r\nAll of these materials were then forwarded to this Court on September 10, 2003.  Applicant\r\nhas continued to file additional motions in this Court, culminating, on May 19, 2004, with a\r\n\"Motion to Consider Additional Evidence of Mental Retardation.\"  Attached to this motion is\r\na letter from Dr. Dickerson and an accompanying psychological-services test report, again\r\nsetting out his opinion that applicant is mentally retarded.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center>II.</center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tApplicant contends that he is mentally retarded and thus, under </span><span><em>Atkins v. Virginia</em>,<sup> (5)</sup>  he\r\nis exempt from execution.  Here, as in </span><span><em>Hall v. State</em>,<sup> (6)</sup> the convicting court did not hold a live\r\nevidentiary hearing on applicant's post-conviction habeas corpus allegation of mental\r\nretardation.  But, also as in </span><span><em>Hall</em>, the issue of mental retardation was fully litigated during the\r\npunishment phase of applicant's original capital-murder trial.  Although applicant's trial took\r\nplace before the Supreme Court decided </span><span><em>Atkins</em>, his able trial counsel presciently predicted\r\nthe outcome of that case and presented extensive mental-retardation evidence as calling for\r\na \"Yes\" answer to the mitigation special issue submitted to the jury.  Applicant's habeas writ\r\nrelies almost exclusively upon that extensive testimony.  Although it is advisable to have an\r\nevidentiary hearing to determine mental-retardation claims raised for the first time in post-</span><span><em>Atkins</em> habeas applications,<sup> (7)</sup> it is not necessary where, as here, the habeas applicant relies\r\nprimarily upon trial testimony.  In this case, both sides had an opportunity to fully develop the\r\npertinent facts at trial, and the habeas judge had an opportunity to assess the credibility and\r\ndemeanor of the witnesses when he presided over the trial.  Although the discrete fact of\r\nmental retardation was not an ultimate issue at the capital-murder trial, the punishment phase\r\ntestimony fully developed that contested fact.<sup> (8)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDuring the punishment phase of applicant's trial, the defense called applicant's father,\r\nmother, and two sisters.  Significantly, none of these witnesses-the persons who knew him\r\nbest during his youth-testified that they had thought, during his formative years, that applicant\r\nwas mentally retarded.<sup> (9)</sup>  Applicant's father remembered that applicant had twice suffered head\r\ninjuries as a child, but he did not know whether he suffered any brain injury as a result.  He\r\ntestified that applicant had had school truancy problems and usually got into trouble alone. \r\nWhile applicant's father stated that applicant had a history of seizures, his sister said that she\r\ndid not believe that applicant had ever suffered seizures.  Applicant's elder sister, a TDCJ-CID\r\nprison guard, said that there was very little good that she could say about him other than the fact\r\nthat he attended church.  Applicant's mother testified that applicant failed kindergarten and\r\nthird grade, that he was sometimes placed in special-education classes, and that he was \"very\r\nslow and had a learning disability.\"  He missed a lot of school because he had headaches, felt\r\nbad about himself, and because she could not drive him to school all the time, as she had to\r\nwork two jobs.  She made him move out of her home about a year before the murder because\r\nhe had sexually assaulted her adopted daughter.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe defense also called a psychologist, a pediatric neurologist, and a psychiatrist to\r\ntestify to applicant's mental condition and abilities.  Dr. Andrews, the psychologist, testified\r\nthat applicant has borderline intellectual functioning.  He stated that applicant's academic\r\nknowledge is \"low\" and that he reads at an early high-school level, and has a fifth-grade spelling\r\nability and sixth-grade math ability.  When applicant was 14 years old, his full-scale IQ score\r\non the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children was 71, and he scored a 72 on the TONI.<sup> (10)</sup>  The\r\nnext year he received a 78 full-scale IQ score on the Wechsler and an 86 on the TONI-2.  No\r\none discussed the significance of this improvement in IQ scores.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tApplicant dropped out of school in the ninth grade.  His teachers consistently noted his\r\nhigh truancy rate as an educational impediment.  Dr. Andrews stated that applicant has adaptive\r\ndeficits and a low ability to complete planning and organization tests.  He did not believe that\r\napplicant was faking mental deficiencies, but he did think that applicant is \"a chronic liar\" and\r\nthat his manipulative conduct in jail demonstrated adaptive behavior.<sup> (11)</sup>  Dr. Andrews concluded\r\nthat applicant is in the \"borderline mentally retarded range\" and would not resolve complex\r\nsituations very well.<sup> (12)</sup>   Dr. Andrews also stated that applicant has an anti-social personality.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDr. Wise, a pediatric neurologist, reviewed applicant's EEG (electroencephalogram)\r\nand testified that applicant has an abnormal neurological status, a generalized slowing of brain\r\nfunction.  He stated that the brain changes as a person ages and is influenced by such things as\r\ndiet, smoking, drug use, and trauma.  He had not personally examined applicant. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDr. Barry Mills, the chief psychiatrist for the Maximum Security Behavior Management\r\nProgram at Vernon State Hospital, examined applicant and concluded that applicant has two\r\nsubdural hematomas (blood clots on both sides of his brain) which have caused brain damage. \r\nAs a result, applicant has poor judgment, an inability to learn from his mistakes or to change\r\nhis actions in response to complicated situations, and an inability to control frustration or\r\nmanage himself.  Dr. Mills acknowledged that there is nothing in applicant's medical records\r\nto confirm any head injury.  He did agree that smoking embalming fluid may cause EEG\r\nchanges.  Dr. Mills stated that applicant was not malingering during his examination but that\r\nhe had been \"manipulative and dishonest throughout a large part of his life.\"  He testified that\r\n\"I did not say [applicant] was mentally retarded.  I said he was borderline mentally retarded,\r\nessentially functioning at that level, but his I.Q. score was not mentally retarded.\"  He agreed\r\nthat applicant had never been diagnosed by anyone as \"borderline mentally retarded\" until after\r\nhe was charged with capital murder, and he stated that applicant's TONI IQ of 86 was \"a more\r\naccurate measure of [applicant's] intelligence.\"  \t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn rebuttal, the State called Dr. David Self, a psychiatrist, who had also examined\r\napplicant.  In his opinion, applicant was malingering and faking his psychiatric symptoms.  He\r\nstated that, during his interview, applicant spontaneously launched into a narrative of various\r\nmental complaints, including visual and auditory hallucinations, depression, an attempted\r\nsuicide, and a history of head trauma.  In Dr. Self's opinion, applicant's intellectual functioning\r\nis in the borderline-to-low average range and he </span><span>does not have significant adaptive deficits.  Dr.\r\nSelf described applicant's letter-writing campaign from jail to various friends and relatives\r\nasking them to smuggle contraband to him as adaptive, albeit anti-social, behavior.  In his\r\nopinion applicant's lack of empathy, his callous disregard for others, and his prior conduct,\r\nincluding his sexual assault of his adopted sister, his shooting at his ex-girlfriend, and his\r\nassaults on his wife and children, were traits consistent with a psychopathy.  Dr. Self stated that\r\napplicant's MRI showed evidence of a prior \"head trauma,\" but no evidence of any brain\r\ndamage.  He concluded that applicant has an anti-social personality disorder, but is not\r\nmentally retarded.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAdditional evidence was timely submitted for the convicting court's consideration on\r\nthe writ. This evidence included most of applicant's school records, his two written statements\r\nto police after his arrest for this murder, twenty inmate-request forms that applicant submitted\r\nwhile he was in jail awaiting trial, letters that he wrote to family and friends from jail, a letter\r\nthat he had written from jail to a venireperson whose name and address he had memorized in\r\nthe courtroom from his attorney's jury list, and applicant's medical and mental-health records\r\nfrom TDCJ-CID.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tApplicant's school records showed that, in almost every year, he missed a large number\r\nof school days, but nonetheless he achieved passing grades in almost all classes.  Seventeen\r\n\"Notices of Concern\" were sent to his family during one school year; they noted that applicant\r\nfailed to complete assignments, failed to make up missed tests, and that he exhibited\r\n\"excessive absences\" and \"lack of effort.\" </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tApplicant's jail letters are clear, coherent, and clever.   In one, he explains to his cousin\r\nhow to smuggle photographs of his three girlfriends into the jail by taping them to extra pages\r\nin an incoming letter.  In letters to his brother, applicant writes jocularly in gang slang.  In\r\nletters to his mother, on the other hand, applicant writes in standard English, without slang.  He\r\nuses a polite tone as he instructs her on how to smuggle tobacco and rolling papers into the jail\r\nby putting them in envelopes labeled \"Legal Mail,\" and having them delivered by his defense\r\ninvestigator.  He tells his mother that he is working on getting joint custody of his son for her\r\nand his wife's mother, and asks her to call the defense investigator and have him bring applicant\r\na small tape recorder so he can record his wife's custody concessions on the phone.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tApplicant's TDCJ-CID medical and mental-health records show that applicant achieved\r\nan IQ result of 84 on a TONI test when he arrived on death row which, according to the records,\r\n\"precluded other need for I.Q. testing.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe trial judge entered findings of fact, based on his review of the trial and writ\r\nevidence, that applicant failed to present a cognizable claim of mental retardation because he\r\nfailed to show facts that prove he is mentally retarded.  The trial judge found that Dr.\r\nDickerson's affidavit concluding that applicant is mentally retarded was untimely submitted\r\nand therefore should not be considered.  In the alternative, he found it unpersuasive.<sup> (13)</sup>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAlthough the trial court did not have the benefit of this Court's opinion in </span><span><em>Ex parte\r\nBriseno</em>,<sup> (14)</sup> it followed the methodology and legal standards set out in that opinion.  Applicant\r\nclaims that his execution would violate the Supreme Court's rulings in </span><span><em>Atkins</em> and </span><span><em>Ring v.\r\nArizona</em><sup> (15)</sup> unless a jury has found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that he is </span><span><em>not</em> mentally retarded,\r\nbrain damaged, or otherwise lacking in mental culpability. This is a claim that we rejected in\r\n</span><span><em>Briseno</em>,<sup> (16)</sup> and it is a claim that the habeas judge in this case rejected as well. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn sum, although there was some evidence in the trial and writ record suggesting the\r\npossibility of mild mental retardation, there was also ample evidence in the record supporting\r\nthe trial court's finding that applicant is not mentally retarded.  We conclude that the trial court\r\ndid not abuse its discretion in reaching this factual conclusion.  Therefore, we deny applicant\r\nrelief on his mental retardation claim.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center>III.</center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe also dismiss applicant's recently filed \"Motion to Consider Additional Evidence\r\nof Mental Retardation\" because we do not have statutory authority to consider  additional\r\nevidence. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tApplicant's writ application, the State's response, all associated exhibits, and the trial\r\ncourt's written findings of fact and conclusions of law were received by this Court on\r\nSeptember 10, 2003.  Article 11.071, § 9(f) explicitly states that once all of the appropriate\r\nmaterials have been timely submitted to the trial court and the trial court has made its written\r\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law, the clerk of the convicting court shall immediately\r\ntransmit these materials to this Court.  Then, under article 11.071, § 11, this Court shall\r\n\"expeditiously review\" the habeas application.  We may (but need not) set the case for oral\r\nargument and we may (but need not) request further briefing.<sup> (17)</sup>  \"After reviewing the record\"\r\nas it was developed in the trial court, this Court \"shall enter its judgment remanding the\r\napplicant to custody or ordering the applicant's release, as the law and facts may justify.\"<sup> (18)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn the present case, applicant asks us to act outside of our statutory authority.  On\r\nNovember 24, 2003, more than a month after the clerk of the trial court transmitted all of the\r\nappropriate writ materials to this Court, applicant filed a motion with this Court entitled\r\n\"Motion to Declare Simpson Mentally Retarded under </span><span><em>Atkins</em> or Alternatively, Motion to\r\nRemand for Evidentiary Hearing to Determine Mental Retardation.\"  This motion alleged that\r\napplicant's counsel was \"trying to set up an appointment with Dr. Dickerson to re-examine Mr.\r\nSimpson.\"<sup> (19)</sup>  He requested that this Court stay further action until Dr. Dickerson could file a\r\nnew report directly with this Court.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn February 9, 2004, this Court received applicant's \"Supplemental Reply to State's\r\nResponse to Petitioner's Mental Retardation Summary.\"  This document stated that Dr.\r\nDickerson had completed his second examination of applicant and a preliminary report was\r\nattached.  Although the document was filed with this Court, applicant asked that the habeas\r\njudge read the attached preliminary report and make supplemental findings.  We do not know\r\nwhether the habeas judge received and read this document, but he did not file any supplemental\r\nfindings, presumably because he did not have statutory authority to do so.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFinally, on May 19, 2004, applicant filed his Motion to Consider Additional Evidence\r\nof Mental Retardation.  He states that this motion is a supplement to the motion he filed with\r\nthis Court on November 24, 2003.  According to that motion and Dr. Dickerson's attached\r\nreport, the results of this second mental-status test were obtained under better conditions than\r\nthose under which earlier tests were taken.  Dr. Dickerson again opines that applicant is mildly\r\nmentally retarded and suffers from organic brain damage.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThere is no provision in article 11.071 that permits either the State or the habeas\r\napplicant to submit original evidence directly to this Court.  Evidentiary affidavits, letters,\r\ntranscripts, or other documents relating to a habeas claim should not be attached to motions\r\nor briefs, and they shall not, and will not, be considered by this Court.  As we recently stated\r\nin another context: </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAn appellate court may not consider factual assertions that are outside the\r\nrecord, and a party cannot circumvent this prohibition by submitting an affidavit\r\nfor the first time on appeal. While the record may be supplemented under the\r\nappellate rules if something has been omitted, the supplementation rules cannot\r\nbe used to create new evidence.  Moreover, an appellate court's review of the\r\nrecord itself is generally limited to the evidence before the trial court at the\r\ntime of the trial court's ruling.<sup> (20)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tIn the ordinary case, if this Court were to consider evidentiary materials that were never\r\nsubmitted to, or considered by, the  habeas  court, the statutory purpose in having the\r\nconvicting court gather the pertinent evidence and make the appropriate written findings of fact \r\nwould be entirely frustrated.<sup> (21)</sup>  The legislative framework of article 11.071 contemplates that\r\nthe habeas judge is \"Johnny-on-the-Spot.\"  He is the collector of the evidence, the organizer\r\nof the materials, the decisionmaker as to what live testimony may be necessary, the factfinder\r\nwho resolves disputed factual issues, the judge who applies the law to the facts, enters specific\r\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law, and may make a specific recommendation to grant or\r\ndeny relief.  This Court then has the statutory duty to </span><span><em>review</em> the trial court's factual findings\r\nand legal conclusions to ensure that they are supported by the record and are in accordance\r\nwith the law.<sup> (22)</sup> We are not the convicting trial court, and we are not the original factfinders. \r\nIt is generally fruitless, if not counterproductive, to file original evidentiary materials relating\r\nto a habeas claim with this Court rather than the trial court.  Although we might have the\r\nimplicit authority to consider evidentiary materials filed directly with this Court, normally the\r\njurisprudential considerations of efficiency, effectiveness, and comity to the habeas court\r\ncounsel against such consideration. Because applicant has failed to offer proof of any\r\ncompelling and extraordinary circumstances, we decline to consider the evidentiary materials\r\nthat he has filed directly with this Court.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tTherefore, based upon our review and our adoption of the trial court's ninety-five pages\r\nof thorough and comprehensive findings of fact and conclusions of law which were submitted\r\nto this Court, we deny relief and dismiss applicant's motions filed directly in this Court.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Cochran</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Filed: June 30, 2004.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Publish\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<p>1.

Applicant submitted these materials to the trial court </p></span><span><em>after</em> that court had filed its findings of\r\nfact and conclusions of law and thus they are not discussed within the trial court's written findings. \r\nNonetheless, we have independently reviewed the materials and conclude that they do not present any\r\nsignificant additional information that was not already before the trial court at the time he made his\r\nfindings.  \r\n<p>5.  536 U.S. 304 (2002).\r\n</p><p>6.  ___ S.W.3d ___, ___ 2004 Tex.Crim.App. LEXIS 817 (Tex.

[and] was not\r\nable to cross examine the affiants and the judge was not able to evaluate their credibility\").\r\n<p>8.  </p></span><span><em>See Hall,</em> ___ S.W.3d at ___.  In </span><span><em>Hall</em>, as in the present case, mental retardation was not an\r\nultimate discrete fact litigated during the capital-murder punishment phase.   We noted that:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tthe parties introduced a significant amount of evidence regarding whether appellant was\r\nmentally retarded, mental retardation was not considered as a discrete issue by the trial\r\njudge or the jury. Although the parties certainly had incentive to litigate the question of\r\nappellant's intelligence, the litigation occurred as a question of degree: defense counsel\r\ncould contend that appellant's low intelligence mitigated his moral culpability even if it\r\ndid not amount to mental retardation, while the State could contend that, even if\r\nappellant were in the mental retardation range, he appreciated the consequences of his\r\nactions to a sufficient degree to deserve the death penalty. Had mental retardation been\r\nan ultimate issue, the parties may well have litigated the issue even more robustly than\r\nthey did, as the issue would be a question of kind (which side of the mental divide\r\nappellant was on) rather than degree (how much did appellant appreciate the\r\nimmorality of his conduct).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><em>Id</em>.  Nonetheless, during this writ proceeding, both parties could, and did, present whatever additional\r\nevidence they believed supported or negated the fact of mental retardation.  It was only after consulting\r\nwith the attorneys that the trial judge determined that a live evidentiary hearing was not necessary.\r\n<p>9.  LaTonya, one of applicant's sisters, did testify that applicant was twice held back in\r\nelementary school and \"had a bunch of problems.\"  She testified that he missed a lot of school:  \"I'm\r\nnot saying he was retarded, but I'm just saying that he was slow.\"  Applicant's other sister, Tangela,\r\ntestified that applicant was slow \"as far as educational level,\" but not in other things.\r\n</p><p>10.  Test of Non-Verbal Intelligence.\r\n</p><p>11.  Dr. Andrews agreed that applicant's conduct in writing his mother-in-law from jail saying that\r\nhe would serve his time for this capital murder in a mental hospital by telling \"my lawyer and the judge\r\nthat I need some help and I'm having problems and seeing things and hearing things\" was goal-directed\r\nand showed a knowledge of the legal system and how to avoid the death penalty.  Dr. Andrews stated\r\nthat he did not believe applicant when applicant told him he had auditory and visual hallucinations. \r\nApplicant also told Dr. Andrews that he had been hospitalized for psychiatric problems, but Dr.\r\nAndrews could not find corroboration for this assertion.  \r\n</p><p>12.  Concerning the issue of \"significant adaptive deficits,\" Dr. Andrews explained:</p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWell, he was not able to function well in school.  He was not able to function well in a\r\nwork setting.  These could be adaptive deficits.  They might be problems with\r\npersonality as well.  I am not terming him mentally retarded but I do think he has some\r\nadaptive deficits.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>He noted that applicant had been diagnosed with a learning disability, not mental retardation, by school\r\nofficials based upon his IQ test of 78 and TONI results of 86.\r\n<p>13.  Specifically, he found that the prison testing conditions \"likely affected\" the test scores; the IQ\r\nscore of 59 that Dr. Dickerson reached was completely at odds with all prior test scores; only portions\r\nof tests were given; separate tests for malingering were not given; Dr. Dickerson's assertion that\r\napplicant was treated as a mentally retarded person in school was contrary to all other evidence which\r\nindicated applicant had a learning disability and truancy problem; Dr. Dickerson appeared not to have\r\nreviewed all of the trial testimony; his \"adaptive behavior\" assessment did not describe behavior that is\r\nnecessarily the result of mental retardation; Dr. Dickerson's assessment was based largely upon\r\napplicant's self-reporting, but applicant's veracity to mental-health experts had been called into serious\r\nquestion by other experts.  Dr. Dickerson's videotaped interview, which was submitted to the trial\r\ncourt after the written findings were signed, does not differ substantively from his affidavit.\r\n</p><p>14.  </p></span><span><em>Ex parte Briseno</em>, ___ S.W.3d ___ , 2004 Tex.

The\r\ntrial judge entered findings of fact and conclusions of law and recommended that relief be\r\ndenied.  We have reviewed the record, and we adopt the trial judge's findings and conclusions. \r\nTherefore, we deny relief.  We also dismiss applicant's \"Motion to Consider Additional\r\nEvidence of Mental Retardation\" because that supplemental material was improperly and\r\nuntimely filed with this Court instead of the convicting court.  Article 11.071<sup> (1)</sup> does not\r\nauthorize piecemeal submission of evidence, nor does it permit the original filing of evidence\r\nwith this Court rather than the convicting court.  Because the trial judge's written findings were\r\nso thorough and complete, we need discuss only applicant's mental- retardation claim and the\r\nmotions applicant filed directly in this Court.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span>I.\tApplicant was indicted for the robbery and murder of Geraldine Davidson on January\r\n26, 2000.  In November 2002, a jury convicted him of that capital murder and, based upon the\r\njury's answers to the punishment special issues, the trial judge sentenced applicant to death. \r\n </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe evidence at trial showed that the 20-year-old applicant, a member of the Southside\r\nCryps gang, planned and executed a burglary at the Palestine, Texas, home of Mrs. Davidson,\r\nan 84-year-old widow and retired teacher.  He had burglarized Mrs. Davidson's home before,\r\nbut this time he enlisted the aid of his sixteen-year-old wife and thirteen-year-old cousin.  Mrs.\r\nDavidson returned home during the burglary, so applicant and his cohorts tied her up with duct\r\ntape, put her into the trunk of her car, and then spent the afternoon driving around in her car\r\nbuying and smoking formaldehyde-laced marijuana cigars.   Later, they picked up applicant's\r\nyounger brother and stopped at a Jack-in-the-Box, where applicant sent the others inside to buy\r\nfood while he waited, outside surveillance camera range, in Mrs. Davidson's car.  After the\r\nfoursome ate and </span><span>smoked more marijuana, applicant drove the car to the Neches River.  He and\r\nhis younger brother pulled Mrs. Davidson out of the trunk, tied her legs to a cinder block, beat\r\nher with her gardening shovel, kicked her in the head, and finally threw her in the river to\r\ndrown.  After dropping off his three cohorts, applicant \"rented\" Mrs. Davidson's car to friends\r\nin return for two rocks of crack cocaine.  His friends were later pulled over in Mrs. Davidson's\r\ncar, and they told the police about applicant \"renting\" them the stolen car.  Police came to\r\napplicant's house to arrest him but he fled.  The officers arrested applicant later that day, after\r\nhe and his brother were found hiding in a neighborhood \"dope house.\"  Applicant was wearing\r\nMrs. Davidson's gold wedding ring when he was booked into jail.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe affirmed applicant's conviction and sentence on direct appeal.<sup> (2)</sup>  Meanwhile, on\r\nDecember 3, 2002, applicant filed his original writ of habeas corpus with the presiding judge\r\nof the convicting court.<sup> (3)</sup>  Accompanying his writ application were two volumes of material,\r\nincluding various affidavits, treatise excerpts in support of his mental-retardation claim,\r\ndocuments from the underlying trial, and published law review and behavioral science articles. \r\nThe State filed its response five months later.  On June 23, 2003, after consulting with the\r\nattorneys, the trial judge entered an order that found that there were no factual issues that could\r\nnot be resolved by using the trial record and the written writ materials.  Thus he decided that\r\na live evidentiary hearing was unnecessary.  He ordered both the State and applicant to file\r\nproposed findings of fact and conclusions of law.  On July 14, 2003, applicant filed an\r\nadditional affidavit by Dr. Windel Dickerson who, based on a personal examination of applicant\r\nand his review of  various other materials, concluded that applicant was mildly mentally\r\nretarded.  Two weeks later the trial judge signed an order permitting both the State and\r\napplicant to acquire and file additional educational records for applicant.  On that same day, the\r\ntrial judge denied applicant's proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law and signed the\r\nState's proposed findings.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn August 7, 2003, applicant's special-education records were filed with the convicting\r\ncourt, and, one month later, applicant filed a videotaped statement made by Dr. Dickerson.<sup> (4)</sup> \r\nAll of these materials were then forwarded to this Court on September 10, 2003.  Applicant\r\nhas continued to file additional motions in this Court, culminating, on May 19, 2004, with a\r\n\"Motion to Consider Additional Evidence of Mental Retardation.\"  Attached to this motion is\r\na letter from Dr. Dickerson and an accompanying psychological-services test report, again\r\nsetting out his opinion that applicant is mentally retarded.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center>II.</center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tApplicant contends that he is mentally retarded and thus, under </span><span><em>Atkins v. Virginia</em>,<sup> (5)</sup>  he\r\nis exempt from execution.  Here, as in </span><span><em>Hall v. State</em>,<sup> (6)</sup> the convicting court did not hold a live\r\nevidentiary hearing on applicant's post-conviction habeas corpus allegation of mental\r\nretardation.  But, also as in </span><span><em>Hall</em>, the issue of mental retardation was fully litigated during the\r\npunishment phase of applicant's original capital-murder trial.  Although applicant's trial took\r\nplace before the Supreme Court decided </span><span><em>Atkins</em>, his able trial counsel presciently predicted\r\nthe outcome of that case and presented extensive mental-retardation evidence as calling for\r\na \"Yes\" answer to the mitigation special issue submitted to the jury.  Applicant's habeas writ\r\nrelies almost exclusively upon that extensive testimony.  Although it is advisable to have an\r\nevidentiary hearing to determine mental-retardation claims raised for the first time in post-</span><span><em>Atkins</em> habeas applications,<sup> (7)</sup> it is not necessary where, as here, the habeas applicant relies\r\nprimarily upon trial testimony.  In this case, both sides had an opportunity to fully develop the\r\npertinent facts at trial, and the habeas judge had an opportunity to assess the credibility and\r\ndemeanor of the witnesses when he presided over the trial.  Although the discrete fact of\r\nmental retardation was not an ultimate issue at the capital-murder trial, the punishment phase\r\ntestimony fully developed that contested fact.<sup> (8)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDuring the punishment phase of applicant's trial, the defense called applicant's father,\r\nmother, and two sisters.  Significantly, none of these witnesses-the persons who knew him\r\nbest during his youth-testified that they had thought, during his formative years, that applicant\r\nwas mentally retarded.<sup> (9)</sup>  Applicant's father remembered that applicant had twice suffered head\r\ninjuries as a child, but he did not know whether he suffered any brain injury as a result.  He\r\ntestified that applicant had had school truancy problems and usually got into trouble alone. \r\nWhile applicant's father stated that applicant had a history of seizures, his sister said that she\r\ndid not believe that applicant had ever suffered seizures.  Applicant's elder sister, a TDCJ-CID\r\nprison guard, said that there was very little good that she could say about him other than the fact\r\nthat he attended church.  Applicant's mother testified that applicant failed kindergarten and\r\nthird grade, that he was sometimes placed in special-education classes, and that he was \"very\r\nslow and had a learning disability.\"  He missed a lot of school because he had headaches, felt\r\nbad about himself, and because she could not drive him to school all the time, as she had to\r\nwork two jobs.  She made him move out of her home about a year before the murder because\r\nhe had sexually assaulted her adopted daughter.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe defense also called a psychologist, a pediatric neurologist, and a psychiatrist to\r\ntestify to applicant's mental condition and abilities.  Dr. Andrews, the psychologist, testified\r\nthat applicant has borderline intellectual functioning.  He stated that applicant's academic\r\nknowledge is \"low\" and that he reads at an early high-school level, and has a fifth-grade spelling\r\nability and sixth-grade math ability.  When applicant was 14 years old, his full-scale IQ score\r\non the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children was 71, and he scored a 72 on the TONI.<sup> (10)</sup>  The\r\nnext year he received a 78 full-scale IQ score on the Wechsler and an 86 on the TONI-2.  No\r\none discussed the significance of this improvement in IQ scores.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tApplicant dropped out of school in the ninth grade.  His teachers consistently noted his\r\nhigh truancy rate as an educational impediment.  Dr. Andrews stated that applicant has adaptive\r\ndeficits and a low ability to complete planning and organization tests.  He did not believe that\r\napplicant was faking mental deficiencies, but he did think that applicant is \"a chronic liar\" and\r\nthat his manipulative conduct in jail demonstrated adaptive behavior.<sup> (11)</sup>  Dr. Andrews concluded\r\nthat applicant is in the \"borderline mentally retarded range\" and would not resolve complex\r\nsituations very well.<sup> (12)</sup>   Dr. Andrews also stated that applicant has an anti-social personality.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDr. Wise, a pediatric neurologist, reviewed applicant's EEG (electroencephalogram)\r\nand testified that applicant has an abnormal neurological status, a generalized slowing of brain\r\nfunction.  He stated that the brain changes as a person ages and is influenced by such things as\r\ndiet, smoking, drug use, and trauma.  He had not personally examined applicant. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDr. Barry Mills, the chief psychiatrist for the Maximum Security Behavior Management\r\nProgram at Vernon State Hospital, examined applicant and concluded that applicant has two\r\nsubdural hematomas (blood clots on both sides of his brain) which have caused brain damage. \r\nAs a result, applicant has poor judgment, an inability to learn from his mistakes or to change\r\nhis actions in response to complicated situations, and an inability to control frustration or\r\nmanage himself.  Dr. Mills acknowledged that there is nothing in applicant's medical records\r\nto confirm any head injury.  He did agree that smoking embalming fluid may cause EEG\r\nchanges.  Dr. Mills stated that applicant was not malingering during his examination but that\r\nhe had been \"manipulative and dishonest throughout a large part of his life.\"  He testified that\r\n\"I did not say [applicant] was mentally retarded.  I said he was borderline mentally retarded,\r\nessentially functioning at that level, but his I.Q. score was not mentally retarded.\"  He agreed\r\nthat applicant had never been diagnosed by anyone as \"borderline mentally retarded\" until after\r\nhe was charged with capital murder, and he stated that applicant's TONI IQ of 86 was \"a more\r\naccurate measure of [applicant's] intelligence.\"  \t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn rebuttal, the State called Dr. David Self, a psychiatrist, who had also examined\r\napplicant.  In his opinion, applicant was malingering and faking his psychiatric symptoms.  He\r\nstated that, during his interview, applicant spontaneously launched into a narrative of various\r\nmental complaints, including visual and auditory hallucinations, depression, an attempted\r\nsuicide, and a history of head trauma.  In Dr. Self's opinion, applicant's intellectual functioning\r\nis in the borderline-to-low average range and he </span><span>does not have significant adaptive deficits.  Dr.\r\nSelf described applicant's letter-writing campaign from jail to various friends and relatives\r\nasking them to smuggle contraband to him as adaptive, albeit anti-social, behavior.  In his\r\nopinion applicant's lack of empathy, his callous disregard for others, and his prior conduct,\r\nincluding his sexual assault of his adopted sister, his shooting at his ex-girlfriend, and his\r\nassaults on his wife and children, were traits consistent with a psychopathy.  Dr. Self stated that\r\napplicant's MRI showed evidence of a prior \"head trauma,\" but no evidence of any brain\r\ndamage.  He concluded that applicant has an anti-social personality disorder, but is not\r\nmentally retarded.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAdditional evidence was timely submitted for the convicting court's consideration on\r\nthe writ. This evidence included most of applicant's school records, his two written statements\r\nto police after his arrest for this murder, twenty inmate-request forms that applicant submitted\r\nwhile he was in jail awaiting trial, letters that he wrote to family and friends from jail, a letter\r\nthat he had written from jail to a venireperson whose name and address he had memorized in\r\nthe courtroom from his attorney's jury list, and applicant's medical and mental-health records\r\nfrom TDCJ-CID.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tApplicant's school records showed that, in almost every year, he missed a large number\r\nof school days, but nonetheless he achieved passing grades in almost all classes.  Seventeen\r\n\"Notices of Concern\" were sent to his family during one school year; they noted that applicant\r\nfailed to complete assignments, failed to make up missed tests, and that he exhibited\r\n\"excessive absences\" and \"lack of effort.\" </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tApplicant's jail letters are clear, coherent, and clever.   In one, he explains to his cousin\r\nhow to smuggle photographs of his three girlfriends into the jail by taping them to extra pages\r\nin an incoming letter.  In letters to his brother, applicant writes jocularly in gang slang.  In\r\nletters to his mother, on the other hand, applicant writes in standard English, without slang.  He\r\nuses a polite tone as he instructs her on how to smuggle tobacco and rolling papers into the jail\r\nby putting them in envelopes labeled \"Legal Mail,\" and having them delivered by his defense\r\ninvestigator.  He tells his mother that he is working on getting joint custody of his son for her\r\nand his wife's mother, and asks her to call the defense investigator and have him bring applicant\r\na small tape recorder so he can record his wife's custody concessions on the phone.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tApplicant's TDCJ-CID medical and mental-health records show that applicant achieved\r\nan IQ result of 84 on a TONI test when he arrived on death row which, according to the records,\r\n\"precluded other need for I.Q. testing.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe trial judge entered findings of fact, based on his review of the trial and writ\r\nevidence, that applicant failed to present a cognizable claim of mental retardation because he\r\nfailed to show facts that prove he is mentally retarded.  The trial judge found that Dr.\r\nDickerson's affidavit concluding that applicant is mentally retarded was untimely submitted\r\nand therefore should not be considered.  In the alternative, he found it unpersuasive.<sup> (13)</sup>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAlthough the trial court did not have the benefit of this Court's opinion in </span><span><em>Ex parte\r\nBriseno</em>,<sup> (14)</sup> it followed the methodology and legal standards set out in that opinion.  Applicant\r\nclaims that his execution would violate the Supreme Court's rulings in </span><span><em>Atkins</em> and </span><span><em>Ring v.\r\nArizona</em><sup> (15)</sup> unless a jury has found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that he is </span><span><em>not</em> mentally retarded,\r\nbrain damaged, or otherwise lacking in mental culpability. This is a claim that we rejected in\r\n</span><span><em>Briseno</em>,<sup> (16)</sup> and it is a claim that the habeas judge in this case rejected as well. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn sum, although there was some evidence in the trial and writ record suggesting the\r\npossibility of mild mental retardation, there was also ample evidence in the record supporting\r\nthe trial court's finding that applicant is not mentally retarded.  We conclude that the trial court\r\ndid not abuse its discretion in reaching this factual conclusion.  Therefore, we deny applicant\r\nrelief on his mental retardation claim.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center>III.</center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe also dismiss applicant's recently filed \"Motion to Consider Additional Evidence\r\nof Mental Retardation\" because we do not have statutory authority to consider  additional\r\nevidence. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tApplicant's writ application, the State's response, all associated exhibits, and the trial\r\ncourt's written findings of fact and conclusions of law were received by this Court on\r\nSeptember 10, 2003.  Article 11.071, § 9(f) explicitly states that once all of the appropriate\r\nmaterials have been timely submitted to the trial court and the trial court has made its written\r\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law, the clerk of the convicting court shall immediately\r\ntransmit these materials to this Court.  Then, under article 11.071, § 11, this Court shall\r\n\"expeditiously review\" the habeas application.  We may (but need not) set the case for oral\r\nargument and we may (but need not) request further briefing.<sup> (17)</sup>  \"After reviewing the record\"\r\nas it was developed in the trial court, this Court \"shall enter its judgment remanding the\r\napplicant to custody or ordering the applicant's release, as the law and facts may justify.\"<sup> (18)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn the present case, applicant asks us to act outside of our statutory authority.  On\r\nNovember 24, 2003, more than a month after the clerk of the trial court transmitted all of the\r\nappropriate writ materials to this Court, applicant filed a motion with this Court entitled\r\n\"Motion to Declare Simpson Mentally Retarded under </span><span><em>Atkins</em> or Alternatively, Motion to\r\nRemand for Evidentiary Hearing to Determine Mental Retardation.\"  This motion alleged that\r\napplicant's counsel was \"trying to set up an appointment with Dr. Dickerson to re-examine Mr.\r\nSimpson.\"<sup> (19)</sup>  He requested that this Court stay further action until Dr. Dickerson could file a\r\nnew report directly with this Court.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn February 9, 2004, this Court received applicant's \"Supplemental Reply to State's\r\nResponse to Petitioner's Mental Retardation Summary.\"  This document stated that Dr.\r\nDickerson had completed his second examination of applicant and a preliminary report was\r\nattached.  Although the document was filed with this Court, applicant asked that the habeas\r\njudge read the attached preliminary report and make supplemental findings.  We do not know\r\nwhether the habeas judge received and read this document, but he did not file any supplemental\r\nfindings, presumably because he did not have statutory authority to do so.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFinally, on May 19, 2004, applicant filed his Motion to Consider Additional Evidence\r\nof Mental Retardation.  He states that this motion is a supplement to the motion he filed with\r\nthis Court on November 24, 2003.  According to that motion and Dr. Dickerson's attached\r\nreport, the results of this second mental-status test were obtained under better conditions than\r\nthose under which earlier tests were taken.  Dr. Dickerson again opines that applicant is mildly\r\nmentally retarded and suffers from organic brain damage.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThere is no provision in article 11.071 that permits either the State or the habeas\r\napplicant to submit original evidence directly to this Court.  Evidentiary affidavits, letters,\r\ntranscripts, or other documents relating to a habeas claim should not be attached to motions\r\nor briefs, and they shall not, and will not, be considered by this Court.  As we recently stated\r\nin another context: </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAn appellate court may not consider factual assertions that are outside the\r\nrecord, and a party cannot circumvent this prohibition by submitting an affidavit\r\nfor the first time on appeal. While the record may be supplemented under the\r\nappellate rules if something has been omitted, the supplementation rules cannot\r\nbe used to create new evidence.  Moreover, an appellate court's review of the\r\nrecord itself is generally limited to the evidence before the trial court at the\r\ntime of the trial court's ruling.<sup> (20)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tIn the ordinary case, if this Court were to consider evidentiary materials that were never\r\nsubmitted to, or considered by, the  habeas  court, the statutory purpose in having the\r\nconvicting court gather the pertinent evidence and make the appropriate written findings of fact \r\nwould be entirely frustrated.<sup> (21)</sup>  The legislative framework of article 11.071 contemplates that\r\nthe habeas judge is \"Johnny-on-the-Spot.\"  He is the collector of the evidence, the organizer\r\nof the materials, the decisionmaker as to what live testimony may be necessary, the factfinder\r\nwho resolves disputed factual issues, the judge who applies the law to the facts, enters specific\r\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law, and may make a specific recommendation to grant or\r\ndeny relief.  This Court then has the statutory duty to </span><span><em>review</em> the trial court's factual findings\r\nand legal conclusions to ensure that they are supported by the record and are in accordance\r\nwith the law.<sup> (22)</sup> We are not the convicting trial court, and we are not the original factfinders. \r\nIt is generally fruitless, if not counterproductive, to file original evidentiary materials relating\r\nto a habeas claim with this Court rather than the trial court.  Although we might have the\r\nimplicit authority to consider evidentiary materials filed directly with this Court, normally the\r\njurisprudential considerations of efficiency, effectiveness, and comity to the habeas court\r\ncounsel against such consideration. Because applicant has failed to offer proof of any\r\ncompelling and extraordinary circumstances, we decline to consider the evidentiary materials\r\nthat he has filed directly with this Court.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tTherefore, based upon our review and our adoption of the trial court's ninety-five pages\r\nof thorough and comprehensive findings of fact and conclusions of law which were submitted\r\nto this Court, we deny relief and dismiss applicant's motions filed directly in this Court.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Cochran</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Filed: June 30, 2004.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Publish\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<p>1.

In his writ application, applicant candidly admits that his claims 20-37 are ones that have been\r\npreviously rejected by this Court and \"are therefore segregated at the end of the application and need\r\nnot delay the Court.\"  Nonetheless, we have carefully reviewed those claims, as well as all of his other\r\nnon-mental retardation claims, and deny them based upon the trial court's findings of fact and\r\nconclusions of law.\r\n</p><p>4.  Applicant submitted these materials to the trial court </p></span><span><em>after</em> that court had filed its findings of\r\nfact and conclusions of law and thus they are not discussed within the trial court's written findings. \r\nNonetheless, we have independently reviewed the materials and conclude that they do not present any\r\nsignificant additional information that was not already before the trial court at the time he made his\r\nfindings.  \r\n<p>5.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121158\"><a href=\"/opinion/121158/atkins-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">304</span></a></span> (2002).\r\n</p><p>6.  ___ S.W.3d ___, ___ 2004 Tex.Crim.App. LEXIS 817 (Tex.

[and] was not\r\nable to cross examine the affiants and the judge was not able to evaluate their credibility\").\r\n<p>8.  </p></span><span><em>See Hall,</em> ___ S.W.3d at ___.  In </span><span><em>Hall</em>, as in the present case, mental retardation was not an\r\nultimate discrete fact litigated during the capital-murder punishment phase.   We noted that:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tthe parties introduced a significant amount of evidence regarding whether appellant was\r\nmentally retarded, mental retardation was not considered as a discrete issue by the trial\r\njudge or the jury. Although the parties certainly had incentive to litigate the question of\r\nappellant's intelligence, the litigation occurred as a question of degree: defense counsel\r\ncould contend that appellant's low intelligence mitigated his moral culpability even if it\r\ndid not amount to mental retardation, while the State could contend that, even if\r\nappellant were in the mental retardation range, he appreciated the consequences of his\r\nactions to a sufficient degree to deserve the death penalty. Had mental retardation been\r\nan ultimate issue, the parties may well have litigated the issue even more robustly than\r\nthey did, as the issue would be a question of kind (which side of the mental divide\r\nappellant was on) rather than degree (how much did appellant appreciate the\r\nimmorality of his conduct).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><em>Id</em>.  Nonetheless, during this writ proceeding, both parties could, and did, present whatever additional\r\nevidence they believed supported or negated the fact of mental retardation.  It was only after consulting\r\nwith the attorneys that the trial judge determined that a live evidentiary hearing was not necessary.\r\n<p>9.  LaTonya, one of applicant's sisters, did testify that applicant was twice held back in\r\nelementary school and \"had a bunch of problems.\"  She testified that he missed a lot of school:  \"I'm\r\nnot saying he was retarded, but I'm just saying that he was slow.\"  Applicant's other sister, Tangela,\r\ntestified that applicant was slow \"as far as educational level,\" but not in other things.\r\n</p><p>10.  Test of Non-Verbal Intelligence.\r\n</p><p>11.  Dr. Andrews agreed that applicant's conduct in writing his mother-in-law from jail saying that\r\nhe would serve his time for this capital murder in a mental hospital by telling \"my lawyer and the judge\r\nthat I need some help and I'm having problems and seeing things and hearing things\" was goal-directed\r\nand showed a knowledge of the legal system and how to avoid the death penalty.  Dr. Andrews stated\r\nthat he did not believe applicant when applicant told him he had auditory and visual hallucinations. \r\nApplicant also told Dr. Andrews that he had been hospitalized for psychiatric problems, but Dr.\r\nAndrews could not find corroboration for this assertion.  \r\n</p><p>12.  Concerning the issue of \"significant adaptive deficits,\" Dr. Andrews explained:</p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWell, he was not able to function well in school.  He was not able to function well in a\r\nwork setting.  These could be adaptive deficits.  They might be problems with\r\npersonality as well.  I am not terming him mentally retarded but I do think he has some\r\nadaptive deficits.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>He noted that applicant had been diagnosed with a learning disability, not mental retardation, by school\r\nofficials based upon his IQ test of 78 and TONI results of 86.\r\n<p>13.  Specifically, he found that the prison testing conditions \"likely affected\" the test scores; the IQ\r\nscore of 59 that Dr. Dickerson reached was completely at odds with all prior test scores; only portions\r\nof tests were given; separate tests for malingering were not given; Dr. Dickerson's assertion that\r\napplicant was treated as a mentally retarded person in school was contrary to all other evidence which\r\nindicated applicant had a learning disability and truancy problem; Dr. Dickerson appeared not to have\r\nreviewed all of the trial testimony; his \"adaptive behavior\" assessment did not describe behavior that is\r\nnecessarily the result of mental retardation; Dr. Dickerson's assessment was based largely upon\r\napplicant's self-reporting, but applicant's veracity to mental-health experts had been called into serious\r\nquestion by other experts.  Dr. Dickerson's videotaped interview, which was submitted to the trial\r\ncourt after the written findings were signed, does not differ substantively from his affidavit.\r\n</p><p>14.  </p></span><span><em>Ex parte Briseno</em>, ___ S.W.3d ___ , 2004 Tex.
