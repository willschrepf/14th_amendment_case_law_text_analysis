Ct. No. CR46579\n ___________________________________ )\n\n\n        Defendants Orlando Gene Romero and Christopher Self were convicted of the first\ndegree murders of Joey Mans, Timothy Jones, and Jose Aragon, the willful, deliberate,\nand premeditated attempted murders of Kenneth Mills, Paulita Williams, and Randolph\nRankins, the attempted robbery of Kenneth Mills and Vicky Ewy, shooting at the vehicle\noccupied by Kenneth Mills and Ewy, the mayhem of Kenneth Mills, the second degree\nrobberies of William Meredith, Jerry Mills, Sr., Jerry Mills, Jr., and Albert Knoefler, the\nsecond degree burglary and vandalism of Magnolia Center Interiors, and receiving stolen\nproperty. (Pen. Code,1 §§ 187, subd. (a), 189, 205, 211, 459, 496, 594, subd. (b)(2),\n664.) The juries2 also found true robbery-murder special-circumstance allegations as to\nall three murders, two multiple-murder special-circumstance allegations for each murder,\nand arming enhancement allegations. (§§ 190.2, subd. (a)(3), (17)(i), 12022,\n\n\n1       All further undesignated statutory references are to this code.\n2       Defendants were tried jointly before separate juries.\n\n                                              1\n\fsubd. (a)(1).) Self was also convicted of the willful, deliberate, and premeditated\nattempted murder and second degree robbery of John Feltenberger and the kidnapping for\nrobbery and second degree robbery of Alfred Steenblock, and the jury found true great\nbodily injury enhancement allegations as to the crimes against Feltenberger and Kenneth\nMills and arming enhancement allegations. (§§ 187, subd. (a), 209, subd. (b), 211, 664,\n12022, subd. (a)(1), 12022.7.) Romero was also convicted of the kidnapping for robbery\nand second degree robbery of Robert Greer, the second degree robbery of Roger\nBeliveau, and receiving stolen property (Feltenberger‘s ammunition pouch), and the jury\nfound true arming enhancement allegations. (§§ 209, subd. (b), 211, 496, 12022, subd.\n(a)(1).) The juries returned death verdicts, and the trial court entered judgments of death.\nThis appeal is automatic. (Cal. Const., art. VI, § 11, subd. (a); § 1239, subd. (b).) For the\nreasons that follow we reverse Self‘s conviction and sentence for Knoefler‘s robbery,\nvacate five multiple-murder special-circumstance findings for each defendant, and\notherwise affirm the judgments.\n                                         I. FACTS\nA.     Guilt Phase\n       1.     Prosecution case\n     In 1992, defendants and brothers Romero and Self3 engaged in a two-month crime\nspree. They were joined at times by Jose Munoz, who pled guilty and testified against\ndefendants at trial,4 and Daniel Chavez, whose case was severed before trial. Defendants\nwere also implicated by their recorded statements to police, which were played for the\njury, and by witness identification and physical evidence.\n\n3      At some point Self changed his last name from Romero to that of their stepfather,\nPhillip Self.\n4        In exchange for Munoz‘s testimony and agreement to plead guilty to the first\ndegree murders of Aragon, Mans, and Jones, the attempted premeditated murder of\nFeltenberger, the robberies of Feltenberger, Knoefler, and Meredith, and the attempted\nrobbery of Kenneth Mills and Ewy, the prosecutor agreed to seek a sentence of 51 years\nto life in prison for Munoz, and request Munoz serve his sentence out of state.\n\n                                             2\n\f               a. Meredith robbery\n     On October 8, 1992, about 10:30 p.m., defendants and Munoz robbed William\nMeredith and stole his 1991 Nissan Pathfinder. They subsequently made a withdrawal\nand a charge on Meredith‘s Visa card.\n\n               b. Mans and Jones murders\n     In the early hours of October 12, 1992, defendants, Munoz, and Chavez noticed\nTimothy Jones and his best friend Joey Mans in a car at a hilltop area near Lake\nMathews. Romero and Munoz ordered the men out of the car at gunpoint. Romero told\nMans to relax and everything would be all right, and had Mans lie down on the ground\nnext to Jones. Romero told Chavez to ―[s]hoot,‖ adding, ―[s]omething like this.‖\nRomero shot Mans in the back, killing him. He attempted to shoot Jones, but the gun\nmalfunctioned. Jones got up and ran down the hill, and defendants ran after him. Self\nbeat Jones with his fists and a pipe and shot him four times, killing him. Defendants stole\nthe victims‘ car keys and a box containing boots, shoes, magazines, and toiletries.\n\n               c. Kenneth Mills and Ewy assault\n     On October 22, 1992, between 11:30 p.m. and midnight, Kenneth Mills and his\ngirlfriend Vicky Ewy took a drive to look at the lightning. Defendants and Munoz pulled\nup beside them and Self shot Mills, who was driving, in the face. Defendants continued\nto chase them until Mills turned onto a golf cart path. Mills permanently lost vision in his\nright eye.\n\n               d. Williams and Rankins attempted murders\n     In the early morning hours of October 26, 1992, Randolph Rankins was\nunsuccessful in purchasing methamphetamine for defendants and Munoz. Romero said\nhe would ―be seeing‖ Rankins later; defendants and Munoz then left. Romero told Self\nand Munoz that if Rankins did not refund their money, they should ―take him out,‖ and\nSelf agreed. About an hour later, Rankins was with acquaintance Paulita Williams in her\ncar at the intersection of Alexander Street and Myron Street in Riverside County.\n                                             3\n\fWilliams was trying to back up to make a turn she had missed. Defendants‘ car appeared\nand blocked Williams‘s car, and Munoz and Self got out. As Munoz began shooting,\nRankins escaped from the car. The bullets struck Williams in her left side and shattered\nthe driver and passenger windows. Self, who appeared to be smiling, began stabbing\nWilliams in the arm. Munoz pushed Self away and shot Williams. Williams suffered a\npunctured lung and three cuts on her hand and arm, including a nine-inch-long gash on\nher arm that required about 80 stitches. One of the bullets left a deep gash on her back\nabout six inches long and an inch and a half wide, and pellets were embedded in her\nspine, shoulder bone, and muscle. Williams still felt the pellets constantly and could not\nbear weight on her shoulders.\n\n               e. Magnolia Center Interiors burglary and vandalism\n     On the night of November 13, 1992, defendants broke into Magnolia Center\nInteriors in Riverside. File drawers were emptied, fire extinguishers were sprayed on\nfabric samples, and glue was sprayed into computers, telephones, fax machines, and\ncalculators. Words similar to ―You‘re going to die‖ were written on a sonogram picture\nof the shop owner‘s unborn son and the picture was stabbed with a sharp object. The\nwords ―Just when you thought‖ and the number ―666‖ were written on the wall and the\nwords ―Now you die‖ were written in the bathroom. The store safe was closed but its\ncombination lock was missing and its hinges had been tampered with. A pair of bolt\ncutters was found by the safe and several screwdrivers and chisels had been ―beaten flat,‖\nas though ―somebody was pounding‖ on the hinges ―trying to pull the hinge pins out.‖ A\nset of unlabeled master keys to offices around the city and a set of keys to the shop van\nwere taken, along with personal objects.\n\n               f.   Steenblock kidnapping and robbery\n     On November 18, 1992, about 1:15 p.m., Alfred Steenblock was eating lunch in his\n1992 Pontiac Grand Prix parked at the Mission Grove Plaza shopping center in Riverside.\n\n\n                                             4\n\fSelf approached Steenblock, pointed a gun at his face, and told him to move over. Self\ndrove Steenblock to an empty field. Another car followed and parked behind them, and\ntwo men, including Chavez, got out. Self demanded Steenblock‘s wallet, took out his\nautomated teller machine (ATM) card, and asked for his personal identification number\n(PIN). He also took about $80 in cash and Steenblock‘s watch. The men instructed\nSteenblock to get out of the car, walk into the field, and stay there for an hour, and then\nleft, taking Steenblock‘s car. Steenblock‘s partially stripped car was later recovered in a\nrural area of Mead Valley.\n\n               g. Knoefler robbery\n     On November 20, 1992, about 3:30 p.m., Albert Knoefler was tending beehives at\nMarkham Street and Washington Street in Riverside County. Parked nearby was his\n1987 pickup truck. Romero approached Knoefler, struck up a conversation about the\nbees, and walked around the bee yard. Romero then brandished what appeared to be a\nsawed-off shotgun and demanded the keys to Knoefler‘s truck. Munoz appeared wearing\na ski mask. Romero said he needed money for gas, and Knoefler handed him about $50.\nThe men left in the truck. The truck was stripped and found several weeks later.\n\n               h. Robbery of Jerry Mills, Sr., and Jerry Mills, Jr.\n     On November 21, 1992, about 12:45 p.m., Jerry Mills, Sr., and his 15-year-old son,\nJerry Mills, Jr., were engaged in target practice shooting about two miles south of the\nPerris Airport in Riverside County. A gray hatchback pulled up and Self pointed a\nshotgun at Mills. Defendants and Chavez got out of the hatchback and took from Mills\nhis pickup truck, along with a Colt Gold Cup .45-caliber semiautomatic pistol, a Ruger\n.22-caliber semiautomatic pistol, a Ruger .22-caliber convertible Western-style single\naction revolver, a Ruger 10/22 semiautomatic rifle with a dark mahogany stock and a\nscope, a ―banana clip‖ or curved 25-round magazine, a 10-round magazine for the rifle,\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\fan ammunition box, toolbox, and about $150. Mills‘s abandoned truck was found a half-\nhour later.\n\n                i.   Aragon murder\n     On November 25, 1992, 22-year-old Jose Aragon was practicing motorcycle stunts\nin San Timoteo Canyon in Riverside County. Defendants and Munoz engaged Aragon in\nfriendly conversation and, after Aragon showed them some stunts, Self shot him.\nRomero picked Aragon up and asked: ―How does it feel to get shot? Does it burn?‖\nRomero placed Aragon in the bed of his (Aragon‘s) pickup truck. Munoz asked him for\nhis keys and wallet, and Self told Aragon to tell him his ATM access code or he would\nkill him. After Aragon gave Self the code, Self put his gun to Aragon‘s ribs and fired\nrepeatedly. Aragon was shot 11 times; all wounds were inflicted before and contributed\nto his death.\n     Defendants and Munoz stole Aragon‘s wallet, toolbox, and Craftsman socket set.\nAs they drove off, Self laughed and said, ―Oh, wow, you should have seen the hole it\nmade.‖ Self made a circle with his fingers about two and a half inches in diameter.\nDefendants and Munoz withdrew $300 from Aragon‘s bank account at two different\nATM‘s and ate lunch at Coco‘s restaurant.\n     Aragon‘s body was discovered later that afternoon by a 10-year-old boy. Two red\nplastic fragments consistent with a 20-gauge sabot shotgun round manufactured by BRI\nwere found in his body. Jose Munoz was videotaped making one of the ATM\nwithdrawals, later arrested, and gave a statement to police that led to defendants‘ arrest.\n\n                j.   Feltenberger attempted murder and robbery\n     On November 30, 1992, about 4:00 a.m., off-duty Ontario Police Sergeant John\nFeltenberger was driving his 1991 red Geo Metro coupe in Moreno Valley near his home.\nHe was not armed or in uniform. A white car appeared and drove parallel to\nFeltenberger, matching his speed each time he slowed down or accelerated. Feltenberger\n\n\n                                              6\n\fthought it might be his newspaper carrier, and pulled to the side of the road; the white car\nstopped beside him. Self got out of the passenger side of the white car carrying a silver\nor chrome sawed-off shotgun. He opened the driver‘s door and demanded Feltenberger\nget out of the car and give Self his wallet. The wallet was in Feltenberger‘s back pocket,\nbut he said it was in the back of his car. The men switched positions so Feltenberger was\noutside facing the car. Feltenberger ignored Self‘s demands for the wallet and, with his\nhands raised, started to back away from Self. When Feltenberger was about 10 feet\naway, he heard a voice from the white car in which Munoz was sitting say, ―Kill him.‖\nFeltenberger said, ―Nobody has to get hurt,‖ and threw the wallet to Self. The voice\ninside the car again said, ―Kill him.‖ Self said, ―I ought to shoot you,‖ and shot\nFeltenberger in the chest. Feltenberger collapsed and Self drove off in the Geo Metro.\nFeltenberger was bleeding and his lung had collapsed, but he managed to reach a\nneighbor‘s house and obtain aid. At the hospital Riverside County Sheriff‘s Deputy\nDavid Green saw medical personnel remove a small piece of red plastic measuring about\ntwo inches by one inch from Feltenberger‘s right arm. In his ―thousands‖ of times firing\na shotgun, Green had never seen a similar object in a round. A different deputy sheriff\nsaw a red plastic object under Feltenberger‘s shirt in his chest area. Feltenberger was in\nintensive care for three days and hospitalized for about 10 days.\n     Both the red material observed by the deputies and the red sabot material found in\nAragon‘s body were identified at trial as consistent with a BRI 20-gauge sabot shotgun\nround. The pathologist who performed Aragon‘s autopsy testified that injuries from\nsabot rounds are uncommon.\n     In his statement to police, Self admitted shooting Feltenberger with a 20-gauge\nsawed-off shotgun and taking his car. Feltenberger testified that when his car was\nreturned to him in January 1993, it was missing his flashlight, ammunition pouch, and\naxe. In Romero‘s statement to police he admitted that the ―pouch‖ he had had come from\nthe Feltenberger incident. Munoz testified he and Self found the ammunition pouch in\n                                             7\n\fFeltenberger‘s car, and that Romero later ―took it‖ because it fit the magazines for his\n.45-caliber weapon.\n\n               k. Greer kidnapping and robbery\n     On December 5, 1992, about 8:00 p.m., Robert Greer withdrew cash from an ATM\nat the corner of Alessandro Boulevard and Trautwein Road in Riverside. As he returned\nto his 1992 Honda Accord EX, Romero, wearing a ski mask, brandished a gun and told\nGreer to throw him his car keys. Romero ordered Greer to sit on the passenger side of\nthe car. As Romero drove, he kept the gun pointed at Greer. The gun was a dull gray or\nsilver and appeared to be a semiautomatic, ―like a .45‖ caliber. They drove about nine\nmiles to a remote area in Mead Valley. Romero took Greer‘s car, about $40, and Greer‘s\ndriver‘s license and ATM card. He asked for Greer‘s PIN number, and $800 was later\nwithdrawn from Greer‘s bank account. Greer walked about two miles to a house where\nhe contacted police.\n\n               l.   Beliveau robbery\n     On December 7, 1992, about 12:45 a.m., Roger Beliveau was in an unlit restroom at\nHunt Park in Riverside. Romero approached him and Beliveau heard the sound of a\nround being chambered in a semiautomatic pistol. Romero told Beliveau to give him his\ncar keys and he would not get hurt. He then told Beliveau to wait in the restroom for five\nminutes and drove off in Beliveau‘s maroon 1978 Ford LTD. Romero stopped at the end\nof the parking lot, where another man threw trash bags into the back of the car; the two\nmen then left. Police later found Beliveau‘s ransacked car in a shopping center at\nAlessandro Boulevard and Trautwein Road in Riverside.\n\n               m. Romero’s escape attempt\n     In April 1994 Arthur Dicken was housed in a Riverside jail cell next to a cell\nhousing Romero and Michael Aragon (who was no relation to murder victim Jose\nAragon). During the nighttime between April 1 and April 14, 1994, Dicken observed\n\n                                             8\n\fRomero and Aragon cutting the two bottom bars of their cell door with a hacksaw blade.\nRomero told Dicken he was planning to escape by taking the nighttime deputy hostage,\nthreatening him with a shank, and leaving the jail. Dicken observed Romero with a four-\nto six-inch-long sharpened metal piece or shank and Aragon with a makeshift spear.\nRomero and Aragon hid the damage to the bars by taping and painting them. Jail\npersonnel learned of the planned escape and Romero and Aragon were moved to a\ndifferent cell. Inspection of the two bars revealed they were completely cut through and\ncould be removed by hand to create a space large enough for an inmate to leave the cell.\nA weapon was found in the cell.\n\n               n. Self’s escape attempt\n     On December 16, 1994, about 1:00 a.m., Riverside County Deputy Sheriff Scott\nCollins noticed a car parked near the jail in a lot reserved for authorized vehicles. The\nwindow for the ground floor cell in which Self was incarcerated was visible from the\ncar‘s location. When the driver, Romero‘s girlfriend, Sonia Alvarez, was asked what she\nwas doing there she gave several different explanations and was arrested. Sheriff‘s\ndeputies inspected Self‘s cell and found gouges in and around the rear window and\nconcrete chips on his bed below. A welded bracket from a cage around Self‘s television\nset had been removed and was found under the television. Self had an inch-long cut on\none finger and redness on both hands.\n\n       2.     Defense case\n     Defendants rested without presenting evidence.\n\n\n\n\n                                             9\n\fB.     Penalty Phase\n       1.     Prosecution case\n               a. Victim impact evidence5\n                    (1) Jose Aragon\n     Lydia Roybal-Aragon, Jose Aragon‘s stepmother, married Jose‘s father when Jose\nwas about 13. The family lived in Albuquerque, New Mexico. In 1985, they moved to\nRedlands, California.\n     Lydia described Jose as a ―kind,‖ ―gentle soul‖ who ―never hurt anybody.‖ At the\ntime of his death, Jose was a 22-year-old senior engineering student at California State\nPolytechnic University. He was a dedicated student and studied constantly. Jose‘s\nfavorite activity was motorcycle riding, and he had received numerous competition\ntrophies. Jose was close to his siblings.\n     Lydia described how the family learned of Jose‘s murder and its effect on them.\nAfter Jose‘s death, his father and brothers Steven and Carlos isolated themselves and\nrarely interacted with the family. His father lost interest in his job, about which he had\npreviously been passionate, and Steven suffered from insomnia. Jose‘s younger sister\nLaura started to misbehave and had difficulty completing her schoolwork.\n     Leighette Hopkins, Jose‘s friend since high school, described Jose as a calm and\nfriendly person who made people laugh. He was a bright and hard-working student who\ntook time to help Leighette study for a chemistry test the night before he died.\n     Stephanie Aragon, Jose‘s younger sister, testified that when their parents divorced\nJose and Steven moved to California with their father. Stephanie, who was then seven\nyears old, stayed in New Mexico with her mother. Stephanie saw Jose about four times a\nyear. Jose was quiet and shy and protected her.\n\n\n\n5      Because some witnesses and victims shared surnames, for clarity we refer to the\nvictims and witnesses by their first names in this portion of the opinion.\n\n                                             10\n\f                    (2) Joey Mans\n     Catherine Mans, Joey Mans‘s mother, testified he was her only son and had five\nsisters. He was 26 years old when he died. Joey was generous, polite, smart, and\nprotective of his family. He was mechanically inclined and could fix anything.\nCatherine did not attend Joey‘s funeral because she did not ―want to see [her] son in a\nbox,‖ and had never visited his grave. She ―almost died [her]self,‖ felt angry all the time,\nquit her job, and had been prescribed tranquilizers.\n     Angela Mans, younger than Joey by six years, testified her brother was kind and\ngullible. He loved to draw and play guitar and work on cars. When Angela saw Joey in\nhis casket, he ―looked so scared,‖ so she knew he was afraid when he died. Because of\nfear she would be similarly attacked, for two months she did not leave her home except to\ngo to work, and four years later at the time of her testimony she still did not go out at\nnight. Their father had not celebrated Christmas in three years because the family was\nnot ―complete.‖ Every year on Joey‘s birthday, Angela and other family members\nbrought to his grave and released a number of balloons corresponding to what his age\nwould have been.\n                    (3) Timothy Jones\n     James Jones, Timothy Jones‘s father, testified that Timmy had a brother, a sister,\nand two stepbrothers. He was 22 years old when he died. Timmy was the ―[m]ost\nwonderful kid in the world,‖ who was kind and generous and ―would do anything for\nyou‖ and ―didn‘t hate anyone.‖ James could not understand ―how they could take his\nlife.‖ James had visited Timmy the night before he died. ―[L]ike always,‖ Timmy told\nJames, ―I love you, Pop,‖ and hugged him goodbye. James next saw Timmy in the\nfuneral parlor and wished he could have died instead of him.\n     Timmy‘s parents divorced when Timmy was about seven years old and the children\nlived with their father. Shortly after Timmy‘s death, his mother had a stroke and died\nabout two years later.\n\n\n                                             11\n\f                b. Unadjudicated criminal activity\n                     (1) Romero\n     On September 22, 1993, Rodney Medeiros, who was incarcerated with Romero,\nreceived food from the commissary. Romero and other inmates demanded Medeiros give\nthem his food and beat him when he refused. He was treated for a week in the medical\nward.\n     On October 6, 1993, about 9:20 p.m., inmate Walter Jutras was sleeping in his cell.\nHe awoke when Romero put his knee on the back of his neck. Romero and another\ninmate repeatedly struck him.\n     On October 27, 1993, Riverside County Sheriff‘s Deputy George Munoz removed\nRomero from his jail cell and told him to empty his pockets. Romero removed a\nsharpened toothbrush that could be used as a weapon. In a box of his belongings Munoz\nfound a broken hairbrush handle that appeared to have been sharpened.\n     On September 3, 1994, and October 29, 1994, shanks were found in Romero‘s one-\nman cell.\n     On June 12, 1994, Romero lured fellow Riverside jail inmate Olen Thibedeau to his\ncell and stabbed him in the stomach with a spear more than four feet long. Thibedeau\nwas facing charges of child molestation and was later convicted of those crimes.\n     On February 8, 1995, Romero visited with Stephanie Stinson, the mother of his son,\nand their conversation was recorded and a portion played for the jury. Romero said: ―I\ndon‘t like violence. I try to avoid it. But when they stick a child molester next door to\nme [and] expect me not to do something, I‘ll be his friend, talk to him real nice, bring\nhim close to the door, and then make him a little spear about this long, about this skinny,\nthat‘s real hard and won‘t bend. You put a pencil at the end of it and strips of wood.\n[¶] . . . [¶] Stick him in his neck.‖\n     Between October 1994 and March 1995, Romero squirted urine from a bottle on\ninmate Tyreid Hodges, who had been charged with child molestation, stepped on a carton\n\n                                             12\n\fof feces splattering them on Hodges, and ―squished‖ a shampoo bottle containing urine,\ncausing it to hit Hodges. He also threw a hairbrush at Hodges.\n\n                    (2) Self\n       Milton Solorzano attended high school with Self. On May 22, 1992, while\nSolorzano was standing in the lunch line, Self charged toward him. Solorzano moved out\nof the way and Self hit his head on the wall. Solorzano grabbed Self and held him in a\nheadlock for about two minutes until a teacher came. Self repeatedly tried to hit\nSolorzano with his fist and said: ―I‘m going to get you. Let me go.‖\n       On June 24, 1993, Self and another inmate approached inmate Oswaldo Vazquez\nand asked him to massage their backs. Vazquez refused. Self threatened Vazquez with a\npencil and said he would stab Vazquez in the neck if he did not give Self a massage.\nVazquez massaged Self‘s back. Self then told Vazquez to suck his penis. Vazquez\ndeclined, and Self and another inmate beat him while a third inmate stood guard.\nVazquez had a scar near his eye as a result of the attack.\n       On September 19, 1993, a shank was found in Self‘s box of personal belongings.\nOn November 25, 1994, three shanks were found in Self‘s one-man cell.\n       On May 30, 1994, Self punched inmate Mario Garcia Pescador in the mouth and left\neye. One or two other inmates joined Self. The victim received six stitches above his\neye.\n       On June 5, 1994, about 1:00 a.m., Riverside County Sheriff‘s Deputy Manuel\nCorrea responded to inmate Jacob Aramburo‘s screams for help. Aramburo was sobbing\non the floor of his cell in a fetal position. He had a cut on the back of his head, scrapes\non his back and chest, and pain in his left shoulder and lower back, and the right side of\nhis face was swollen. Aramburo shared the cell with other inmates including Self. Self‘s\nknuckles were red and he had a fresh cut on one knuckle.\n\n\n\n\n                                             13\n\f     On July 22, 1994, Riverside County Sheriff‘s Deputy Alfonso Campa responded to\ncalls for help from inmate Richard Reyes. Reyes was missing several teeth and bleeding\nfrom his lip and gum, had red marks on his face, and looked scared. Campa examined\nthe other inmates in Reyes‘s cell. Self was bleeding from a puncture wound on one of his\nknuckles and his other knuckles were red. None of the other inmates had marks on their\nhands. On July 24, 1994, Self told his mother in a recorded conversation that was played\nfor the jury that he had ―busted out‖ an inmate‘s ―two teeth.‖\n\n       2.     Defense case\n\n               a. Both defendants\n     Maria Self, defendants‘ mother, testified that defendants‘ biological father was\nOrlando Romero, and she was married to their stepfather, Phillip Self. Maria was 17 in\n1968 when she married 22-year-old Orlando. They were married for six years and had\nfour sons; she was pregnant with Self when she filed for divorce.\n     Maria never smoked, drank alcohol, or used drugs when she was pregnant with\ndefendants. Orlando never worked. He was physically abusive to Maria, and once put a\ngun to her face and said he should kill her. On another occasion he threatened the entire\nfamily by filling the house with thick smoke and refusing to let them leave. Both\nOrlando and Maria had frequent affairs. At one point Maria called 911 and told the\ndispatcher she was ―going to kill them all because [she] couldn‘t handle them.‖ On\ncross-examination she said that although she spoke to the dispatcher for over two\nminutes, and cried hysterically that she was going to kill all of her children, no police\nofficer ever came to her house to investigate.\n     After Maria left Orlando, she and her sons moved to Modesto for about four years.\nMaria did not work, and she abused alcohol and drugs, including methamphetamine, in\nfront of the children. She was also physically and verbally abusive to the boys, and never\nhugged them or told them she loved them. When Self was about two years old, she\n\n\n                                             14\n\fslashed his face and the children were removed from her custody. About a year later, the\nchildren were returned to her. On cross-examination, Maria said she had struck Self with\na broken fly swatter, he had one cut, and she did not seek medical attention for him.\nMaria agreed with the prosecutor that she had been distraught and told a counselor at the\ndepartment of mental health she was ―in a bad way‖ and ―needed somebody to help [her]\nwith the children.‖ The following day her children were placed with relatives.\n     At some point the family left Modesto and moved to Turlock for about a year.\nMaria continued to drink and she also used methamphetamine and LSD. The family then\nmoved to Stockton, where they lived with a heroin addict and dealer. Romero was in\nschool, but she never visited the school or asked about his homework. Romero closely\nresembled his biological father, and Maria frequently reminded him of this circumstance\nand said that she hated his father.\n     The family then returned to Riverside. Maria continued to use drugs and did not\nmonitor the children‘s school work. Between the time Maria married Orlando and when\nshe married Phillip Self, she had been in about 10 relationships. After her divorce from\nOrlando the family moved frequently, living in 10 or 11 different places.\n     On cross-examination Maria agreed with the prosecutor that shortly after returning\nto Riverside she met and moved in with her current husband, Phillip Self. Romero was\nabout eight years old and Self about five years old. Phillip was very good to the boys.\nHe took them fishing, showed them how to change a tire, and treated them as his own\nchildren. Maria agreed with the prosecutor that Phillip was ―the best thing that ever\nhappened to [her],‖ and said that when she would try to abuse alcohol or drugs, ―he\nwouldn‘t let [her].‖ Maria and Phillip had two girls together, and Maria had tried to be a\ngood parent to them.\n     When Romero was 14, he asked to live with his father. Maria allowed him to go,\nbut believed her ―baby [was] gone . . . into somebody‘s hands who really doesn‘t care\nabout him.‖ When Romero became involved with drugs, Maria told him she would help\n                                            15\n\fhim in any way she could to get off drugs. She tried to arrange for him to go to the\ntreatment program Teen Challenge, but there was a long waiting list.\n     When Self was about 14 or 15 years old he lived with Maria‘s niece for about four\nmonths and then came home; at some point he also lived with his father. Self began\nusing drugs and alcohol. Maria sent him to a Chino drug rehabilitation center for two\nweeks. Afterward, Self did ―much better.‖ He was home-schooled and received good\ngrades. Self relapsed, however. Maria had two small girls in the house and did not want\nthem to see their brothers abusing these substances, so she told Self he had to leave and\nsent him to live with her friend Charlene. Self later lived with Maria‘s mother. Maria\ntestified that Self ―does beautiful artwork.‖\n     Maria loved defendants. Since their arrest three and a half years earlier, Maria had\nspent much of her time crying and praying.\n     Anthony Self, defendants‘ older brother, testified he had enlisted in the Army at the\nage of 18 and reenlisted for another four years when he was 22 years old. He was a\ncombat engineer and paratrooper in the 27th Engineer Battalion at Fort Bragg, cleared\nmine fields during Desert Storm, and supervised other soldiers.\n     When Anthony was about eight years old, he and his family lived with Bobby\nGuzman. Guzman once disciplined Self by making him stand in a corner for two hours\nwith soiled underwear on his head. At some point Maria married Phillip Self, whom the\nboys liked, and whom Anthony considered his father.\n     Anthony and his brothers would frequently send Self to fight the next-door neighbor\nto ―see what he could take.‖ Anthony experimented with drugs in high school and once\ngave Self heroin when he was in elementary school. Maria and Phillip were unaware of\nhis drug use. On cross-examination Anthony agreed he had never mentioned giving Self\nheroin to any of the investigators he had spoken to before trial. Maria told the boys to\navoid drugs and both she and Phillip would have been very upset if they had learned\nAnthony had been drinking alcohol in high school.\n                                                16\n\f     When the boys upset Maria she would ―lash out at us with whatever she had in her\nhand,‖ such as a fly swatter or broom. She once threw a knife at Anthony, hitting him\nwith the handle. On cross-examination Anthony testified it was important to Maria that\nthe boys did well in school and she wanted them to attend school and complete their\nhomework.\n     Anthony used the last name Self because his biological father was ―really never any\npart of our lives‖ and did not provide any financial support. He said, ―We lived pretty\nmuch in poverty with my mother raising us.‖ When Phillip Self joined the family he was\nvery good to the boys, taking them fishing and supporting them and showing Anthony\nhow to work on cars.\n\n               b. Romero\n     Carmen Burrola, Maria Self‘s sister and Romero‘s aunt, testified that when Romero\nwas in about the second grade, he and his brother Anthony stayed with her and her\nhusband and daughters for about two years because Maria had a ―nervous breakdown.‖\nRomero was kind and polite. Burrola and her husband took the boys to Disneyland and\nother amusement parks and to the mountains. Burrola gave the boys chores to do, tried to\nteach them right from wrong, and gave them advice on how to navigate life‘s problems.\n     Burrola had never seen Maria abuse the boys. Burrola knew Orlando, Romero‘s\nbiological father, and characterized home life with him and Maria as ―[a]wful.‖ She\nrecalled Orlando ―drunk, . . . just lying there, not doing nothing.‖ Phillip Self was a good\nman who was ― [v]ery patient‖ with the boys and very good to Maria. Burrola was very\nsad and surprised when she heard Romero was charged with murder because he ―was\nalways a good boy‖ and ―very respectful.‖\n     Mona Suzette Quezada, Romero‘s cousin, had worked for the Riverside Transit\nAgency for eight years. She was 10 years older than Romero and grew up with him. She\ndescribed him as a quiet child. Their grandparents lived in the area on a small farm. At\n\n\n                                            17\n\ftimes when she was 10 to 12 years old, she and her grandparents would pick up Romero\nand his siblings either because they were not being taken care of or because Maria was\nupset with Romero‘s father. On those occasions Romero and his siblings often did not\nhave ―decent food to eat,‖ and sometimes were without electricity. Her grandmother was\nvery good to Romero and his siblings when they were at her house. Quezada was very\nsurprised when she heard Romero was charged with murder because it ―was totally out of\ncharacter.‖\n     Margaret Lopez, Romero‘s aunt and godmother, took care of Romero for two\nmonths when he was about a year and a half old. She did not have a lot of contact with\nRomero when he was a child. When he was a teenager Romero visited her whenever he\ncould and was respectful. She was shocked when she heard he was charged with murder\nbecause he was a ―good kid‖ and ―wouldn‘t do what they are saying.‖\n     Corinna Leon, Romero‘s cousin, took care of him frequently when he was young.\nAs a teenager Romero was quiet and kind and interacted well with her children. At some\npoint as a teenager he had a girlfriend and a baby of his own and Corinna saw him less\nfrequently. When Romero‘s mother Maria returned from ―up north,‖ she was not ―taking\ncare of the boys,‖ although Corinna could not recall any particular incident when they\nwere not fed or clothed.\n     Catherine Mejia, Romero‘s cousin, lived with Romero for about three months in\n1990. Romero was quiet, happy, and nice.\n     Christine Arrabito testified that she had attended school with Romero from\nelementary through high school. After high school Romero lived with Arrabito and her\nfamily in Perris for about a month. Later that same year he lived with her and her family\nin Pacifica for about five months, saying he ―really wanted to . . . change‖ and wanted a\n―fresh start.‖ Although he held various jobs, he did not pay his share of the rent or phone\nbill and was asked to leave. On cross-examination Arrabito did not recall telling an\ninvestigator that Romero said he and his friends would beat up people who ―piss[ed] him\n                                            18\n\foff.‖ She relayed Romero‘s description in high school of watching the drivers of\nexpensive cars for a long period of time before stealing their cars. She believed her\nfamily had given Romero a chance in Pacifica and he had misused it and taken advantage\nof them. After that she did not want anything to do with him.\n     Janice Babish, Arrabito‘s mother, testified that Romero came to live with them in\nPacifica because he ―felt like he needed to turn his life around‖ and thought it would help\nto leave the Riverside area. On cross-examination Babish said Romero would claim to be\nstill working at a job after he had been fired so Babish would think he was still earning\nmoney. When he left their home he said he would pay the family back for his phone bill\nbut never did.\n     Sheila Torres, Romero‘s cousin and a California deputy labor commissioner, was\ntwo years older than Romero‘s mother. Once when she and her grandparents took\ngroceries over to Romero‘s house, his father Orlando was passed out in the house. Her\ncousins were toddlers and were outside playing in a field.\n     Torres said at one point Romero‘s mother Maria Self came to live with her while\nRomero lived with another family. For about a year Maria occasionally dated a heroin\ndealer, Henry Alvarado. Torres was upset and spoke to Maria because Alvarado ―had no\nredeeming qualities.‖ Torres also witnessed Maria throw objects at her sons. She\ncommented, ―it seemed like [Maria] was either riding them for something or not paying\nany attention to them at all.‖ Maria ―was always comparing [Romero] to his father‖ and\n―telling him that he wouldn‘t amount to anything.‖\n     Torres also said she had a brother who committed suicide, a niece who was beaten\nto death, and a great-uncle, whom neither she nor defendants had met, who was convicted\nof murder.\n\n\n\n\n                                            19\n\f               c. Self\n     Sheriff‘s Deputy John Bianco worked at the Robert Presley Detention Center, where\nSelf was housed in a cell by himself. For two hours a day he could leave the cell and use\nart supplies. The jury was shown several pieces of Self‘s artwork.\n     Margaret Louie, Self‘s high school art teacher, testified that Self had voluntarily\nparticipated in creating a mural to honor an art teacher who had died, and had drawn a\ncover for a school literary magazine. She described Self as ―[v]ery talented, very\nmotivated,‖ and someone who always volunteered.\n\n       3.     Rebuttal\n\n               a. Both defendants\n     Robin Levinson, a defense private investigator, conducted a taped interview of\nMaria Self on June 8, 1993, and had a transcript prepared. When Maria was asked if she\nused drugs around her children, she said she had never used drugs or been drunk in front\nof them but rather always tried to shield them.\n     Levinson had also interviewed Christine Arrabito. Arrabito said Romero told her he\nand his friends would beat up individuals who made them angry, but she never saw this\nquality in him and thought it was ―all talk.‖\n\n               b. Romero\n     Maria Self, defendants‘ mother, testified she did not recall telling an investigator\nduring a taped interview that Romero‘s ―attitude was very bad,‖ ―he never wanted to take\nresponsibility for anything that he did,‖ and he did poorly in school. When asked if it\nwas true Romero never wanted to take responsibility for his actions, Maria replied,\n―Well, he may have not liked to, no, but sometimes he did.‖ On cross-examination she\nagreed with defense counsel that if something had been Romero‘s fault, she would ―just\nbeat him.‖\n     Robin Levinson testified Maria Self had said during her taped interview: ―His\nattitude was very bad. It was like he never wanted to take responsibility for anything that\n                                                20\n\fhe did. It was always somebody else‘s fault. He denied things that would be in front of\nsomebody‘s face and he would still deny it. He didn‘t want to get up in the morning. He\ndidn‘t do well in school. He did very poorly.‖ On cross-examination, Levinson noted\nMaria had also said Romero ―had very low self-esteem, even though he was the best\nlooking kid on the block.‖\n\n                                    II. DISCUSSION6\n\nA.     Pretrial Issues\n\n       1.     Challenges to juror questionnaire\n     Self contends that asking each prospective juror to identify on the juror\nquestionnaire his or her race and ethnic background led to the improper discharge of\nprospective jurors based on race and ethnicity and resulted in the selection of a biased\njury that violated Self‘s right to a representative cross-section of the community.7 Before\n\n\n6      Before turning to defendants‘ claims, we address three preliminary matters. First,\ndefendants each make a blanket statement they join in all issues raised by each other that\nmay accrue to their benefit. We have recently strongly disapproved of this practice.\n(People v. Bryant, Smith and Wheeler (2014) 60 Cal.4th 335, 363–364 (Bryant, Smith\nand Wheeler). As in Bryant, Smith and Wheeler, however, we will assume defendants\nhave complied with California Rules of Court, rules 8.630(a) and 8.200(a)(5), in order to\navoid further delay. (Bryant, Smith and Wheeler, at p. 364.)\n       Second, ―as to many claims defendants allege for the first time that the error\ncomplained of violated their federal constitutional rights. To the extent that in doing so\ndefendants have raised only a new constitutional ‗gloss‘ on claims preserved below, that\nnew aspect of the claims is not forfeited. However, ‗[n]o separate constitutional\ndiscussion is required, or provided, when rejection of a claim on the merits necessarily\nleads to rejection of [the] constitutional theory . . . .‘ ‖ (Bryant, Smith and Wheeler,\nsupra, 60 Cal.4th at p. 364.)\n        Finally, Romero‘s first ―claim‖ presents no claim of error but is simply a lengthy\nexegesis on how ―any substantial error could have affected the penalty verdict.‖ Absent\nreference to a claim of error, it is difficult to meaningfully assess or respond to his\ndiscussion. Where relevant, we invoke the proper standard of prejudice for that asserted\nerror, and nothing in Romero‘s discussion persuades us to revisit these standards.\n7      Question 1.D. read: ―Your race and ethnic origin: _____.‖\n\n                                            21\n\fjury selection defendants unsuccessfully objected to the use of a juror questionnaire\nbecause in their view it would be used by the prosecutor to strike any prospective juror\nexpressing ―even a minimal reservation about imposing the death penalty.‖ Once the\nquestionnaire was drafted, Self objected to a question regarding the then recent\nO.J. Simpson trial. Self did not object to the question regarding the prospective juror‘s\nrace and ethnic background, and the claim is therefore forfeited.\n     Self further contends use of the jury questionnaire to dismiss 56 prospective jurors\nwas unconstitutional. Several of these prospective jurors were questioned on voir dire,\nand in any event, Self stipulated to the dismissal of all of them and the claim is therefore\nforfeited. Although the trial court at times commented on the prospective jurors who had\nbeen stipulated for excusal, these statements were not findings. As we have explained:\n―A court may allow counsel to prescreen juror questionnaires and stipulate to juror\ndismissals. [Citations.] When prospective jurors are formally dismissed pursuant to\nstipulation rather than cause, the trial court makes no findings, and we have nothing we\ncan review. [Citation.] Consequently, a stipulation to the excusal of jurors forfeits any\nsubsequent objection to their omission from the jury pool.‖ (People v. Duff (2014) 58\nCal.4th 527, 540; see People v. Booker (2011) 51 Cal.4th 141, 159 [―We previously have\nbarred belated challenges to stipulated excusals of prospective jurors‖].) Unlike in\nPeople v. Stewart (2004) 33 Cal.4th 425, 444–445, 448, on which Self relies, the\nprospective jurors here were not excused over Self‘s objection but rather with his\nconsent.\n\n       2.     Asserted prosecutorial misconduct\n\n               a. Assertedly racially biased voir dire\n     Self contends during voir dire the prosecutor improperly and repeatedly asked\nHispanic prospective jurors more ―probing and detailed questions‖ than he asked\nCaucasian prospective jurors in a successful effort to eliminate ―all eligible, qualified\n\n\n                                             22\n\fHispanic prospective jurors from the final jury pool.‖ As Self concedes, he did not object\nbelow on the ground the prosecutor‘s voir dire was racially biased and the claim is\ntherefore forfeited. Such a failure ―deprives the trial court of the opportunity‖ to create a\nrecord and to ―correct potential error in the first instance.‖ (People v. Lewis (2008) 43\nCal.4th 415, 481; id. at pp. 481–482 [failure to press for a ruling on a Wheeler8 motion\nforfeits the issue on appeal]; see People v. Richardson (2008) 43 Cal.4th 959, 984 [failure\nto make a Wheeler motion at trial ―forfeits the issue on appeal‖]; People v. Gallego\n(1990) 52 Cal.3d 115, 166 [no error appears when the defendant ―failed even to raise a\nWheeler claim, let alone establish a prima facie case of misuse of peremptory\nchallenges‖].) Contrary to Self‘s assertion, nothing in Catchpole v. Brannon (1995) 36\nCal.App.4th 237, 244 (disapproved in People v. Freeman (2010) 47 Cal.4th 993, 1006,\nfn. 4), which concerned a litigant‘s claim of judicial partiality for the first time on appeal,\ncompels a different result.\n     Self further contends in his reply brief that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to\nobject to the asserted misconduct. ―Obvious reasons of fairness militate against\nconsideration of an issue raised initially in [a] reply brief . . . .‖ (Varjabedian v. City of\nMadera (1977) 20 Cal.3d 285, 295, fn. 11.) Moreover, ―deciding whether to object is\ninherently tactical, and the failure to object will rarely establish ineffective assistance.‖\n(People v. Hillhouse (2002) 27 Cal.4th 469, 502 (Hillhouse).) Here, because no\nprosecutorial misconduct claim was raised below, we have no record—such as the\nprosecutor‘s reasons for the manner in which any particular prospective juror was\nquestioned—on which we can assess Self‘s claim. (People v. Mendoza Tello (1997) 15\nCal.4th 264, 266–267 [ineffective assistance of counsel claims are generally properly\ndecided in a habeas corpus proceeding rather than on appeal].)\n\n\n\n8      People v. Wheeler (1978) 22 Cal.3d 258.\n\n                                               23\n\f               b. Assertedly misleading comments about mitigation\n     Self contends the prosecutor misrepresented the nature of mitigating evidence\nduring voir dire. We disagree.\n     The prosecutor said to one group of prospective jurors: ―You may hear evidence in\nmitigation, things, perhaps the defendant was a war hero. Perhaps he saved his platoon in\nthe Persian Gulf and received a Silver Star. Perhaps he once pulled a family from a\nburning car. Perhaps he once gave bone marrow in a transplant so that a child could\nsurvive. Perhaps you may hear evidence that would make you have sympathy for him,\nall of which you can consider in making your [penalty] decision. And there is only one\ndecision to make when you are in the penalty phase, that is between life without parole or\ndeath. There is no other option in the penalty phase.‖ He made similar comments on\nother occasions, at times using hypothetical examples of Self being a scout leader or\nsoccer or Little League coach and having a positive effect on young people.\n     Defense counsel said to one group of prospective jurors: ―[W]e would present\nmitigating factors, things that we would want you to consider in terms of making this\ndecision, and those mitigating factors can be anything. There ha[ve] been previous\nexamples given by [the prosecutor] of . . . doing a heroic act, for example, or saving\nsomebody from a burning car, a burning building, providing a bone marrow transplant.\nWhat I am telling you is, I don‘t want you to have any preconceived notion as to what\nmitigating factors might be present. If the only people that deserve life without parole\nwould be heroes, nobody would probably receive it. Do you follow me?‖ He informed a\ndifferent group of prospective jurors ―[m]itigating factors . . . can be anything positive‖\nabout Self and another ―[m]itigating factors are anything that may tend to mitigate\nagainst what took place‖ including ―[p]ositive things about‖ Self.\n     At the end of the penalty phase the trial court instructed the jury that a ―mitigating\ncircumstance is any fact, condition, or event which, as such, does not constitute a\njustification or excuse for the crime in question, but may be considered as an extenuating\n\n                                             24\n\fcircumstance in determining the appropriateness of the death penalty.‖ It further\ninstructed the jury a mitigating circumstance did not have to be proved beyond a\nreasonable doubt; the jury need not unanimously agree on the presence of a mitigating\nfactor before a juror could consider it; the mitigating circumstances read were merely\nexamples and a juror could ―also consider any other circumstances relating to the case or\nto the defendant as shown by the evidence as reasons for not imposing the death penalty‖;\na juror could find a mitigating circumstance existed if there was any evidence, however\nweak, to support it; any mitigating circumstance could outweigh all the aggravating\nfactors; the jury could reject death as a penalty based solely on sympathy or compassion\nresulting from the mitigating evidence; and the jury could decide even in the absence of\nany mitigating evidence that the ―aggravating evidence is not comparatively substantial\nenough to warrant death.‖\n     Self did not object to the prosecutor‘s statements or seek an admonition, and no\nexception to the general rule requiring an objection and request for admonition is\napplicable. The claim is therefore forfeited. (People v. Samayoa (1997) 15 Cal.4th 795,\n841 (Samayoa).)\n     It is also meritless. Self contends that the prosecutor‘s comments were improper\nbecause they ―permitted the jury to infer that only highly or strongly mitigating evidence\nwould be worthy of consideration in deciding penalty and that [Self] was required to\nintroduce‖ such evidence ―to counter any evidence in aggravation [and] to establish that\nhe did not warrant death.‖ There is no reasonable likelihood the jury so construed the\nprosecutor‘s comments. (People v. Centeno (2014) 60 Cal.4th 659, 667 [―When\nattacking the prosecutor‘s remarks to the jury, the defendant must show‖ in the context of\nthe whole argument and the instructions there was ― ‗a reasonable likelihood the jury\nunderstood or applied the complained-of comments in an improper or erroneous\nmanner.‘ ‖].) Here, defense counsel on at least one occasion corrected and clarified the\nprosecutor‘s remarks through his own voir dire comments. (People v. Seaton (2001) 26\n                                            25\n\fCal.4th 598, 636.) More critically, the trial court‘s instructions at the end of trial fully\ninformed the jury that it could consider in mitigation any circumstance—no matter how\nweak the evidence of that circumstance—relating to the case or to Self, and could find\nlife imprisonment without the possibility of parole the appropriate penalty even in the\nabsence of any mitigating evidence.\n     Self further contends that the prosecutor improperly insinuated that Self ―bore a\nheavy burden of proof in order to obtain a sentence less than death.‖ Nothing in the\nprosecutor‘s remarks referred to a burden of proof and, once again, the trial court\nexhaustively instructed the jury on the proper definition and use of mitigating evidence.\n     In his reply brief Self asserts trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the\nprosecutor‘s challenged comments. There was no misconduct and therefore no\ndeficiency on counsel‘s part in failing to object.\n\n       3.     Evidence of Feltenberger’s attempted murder\n\n     Defendant Romero contends the trial court erred in admitting ―gruesome‖ evidence\nof Feltenberger‘s attempted murder to prove Romero received the victim‘s stolen\nammunition pouch. (§ 496; see ante, at pp. 6–8.) He asserts his ―guilt of the uncontested\nreceiving charge was clear without the attempted-murder testimony, so the error could\nnot have affected that determination,‖ but the testimony was prejudicial at the penalty\nphase. We disagree.\n     Before opening statements, the prosecutor moved to have the juries for both\ndefendants hear Feltenberger testify. The trial court admitted Feltenberger‘s testimony,\nbut directed defense counsel to prepare a limiting instruction, and admonished the\nprosecutor not to in any way suggest Romero was involved in Feltenberger‘s shooting.\nBefore Feltenberger testified, the trial court instructed the Romero jury: ―You are about\nto hear evidence in the form of testimony from John Feltenberger. This evidence is not\nbeing offered to show that the defendant Orlando Romero is involved in the alleged\n\n\n                                              26\n\frobbery and attempted murder of Mr. Feltenberger. On the contrary, there will be no\nevidence provided that Mr. Romero was . . . involved in this incident. Instead, this\nevidence is being offered as it relates to Count XX, receiving stolen property. You are to\nconsider it solely as it relates [to], one, whether the property was in fact stolen, and, two,\nwhether Mr. Romero had knowledge that the property was stolen.‖ After Feltenberger‘s\ntestimony, Romero unsuccessfully moved to preclude testimony by other witnesses\ndescribing the investigation into the Feltenberger shooting, including the discovery of the\nred sabot material found in Feltenberger. At the close of the guilt phase the trial court\ngave Romero‘s jury a limiting instruction similar to that given before Feltenberger‘s\ntestimony.\n     Here Romero asserts only that the evidence was prejudicial at the penalty phase, and\nwe therefore need not consider whether it was properly admitted at the guilt phase.\nAssuming, therefore, without deciding, that evidence of the details of the attack on\nFeltenberger was improperly admitted, there is no reasonable possibility a different\npenalty verdict would have resulted absent admission of this evidence. (See People v.\nBrown (1988) 46 Cal.3d 432, 448.) Both before Feltenberger‘s testimony and at the close\nof the guilt phase the trial court instructed the jury the evidence was not being offered to\nshow Romero was involved in the robbery or attempted murder of Feltenberger and there\nwas no evidence Romero was involved in this incident. We presume the jury understood\nand followed this instruction. (People v. Hajek and Vo (2014) 58 Cal.4th 1144, 1178.)\nMoreover, other evidence demonstrated Romero‘s role in the brutal and unprovoked\nmurders of Aragon, Jones, and Mans, and the attempted murders of Kenneth Mills,\nWilliams, and Rankins, as well as his in-custody violence against Medeiros, Jutras,\nThibedeau, and Hodges. In addition, the jury acquitted Romero of the Steenblock\nrobbery and kidnapping charges, showing it carefully evaluated the evidence.\n\n\n\n\n                                              27\n\f       4.     Joinder and severance\n\n     Romero contends that joinder of the Magnolia Center Interiors (Magnolia Center)\nburglary (predicated on entry with intent to steal and vandalize) and vandalism charges\nand the receiving stolen property (Feltenberger‘s ammunition pouch) charge with the\nremaining counts was ―statutorily unauthorized‖ under section 954. Defendants further\ncontend the trial court abused its discretion in denying the motion to sever the Magnolia\nCenter charges from the remaining charges, and Romero asserts the trial court abused its\ndiscretion in failing to sever the charge of receiving stolen property from the remaining\ncharges against him. We disagree.\n     Before trial, Self, joined by Romero, moved to sever the murder counts from the\nremaining charges. Defendants focused particularly on severing the murder counts from\nthe counts involving the attempted murders of Feltenberger and Williams. The motion to\nsever did not contest that the statutory requirements for joinder had been met. The trial\ncourt denied the motion.\n     Because it generally promotes efficiency, joinder of charges is ― ‗preferred by the\nlaw.‘ ‖ (People v. Hartsch (2010) 49 Cal.4th 472, 493 (Hartsch).) When the statutory\njoinder requirements are met, a defendant can demonstrate error in a ― ‗ruling allowing\njoint trial . . . only by making a ―clear showing of prejudice . . . .‖ ‘ ‖ (Ibid.) As can be\nseen, defendants did not claim joinder of any of the counts was statutorily unauthorized.\nUnder section 954, this claim is therefore forfeited.\n     Even had the claims of improper joinder not been forfeited, they would have lacked\nmerit. The charges were properly joined because they were ―connected . . . in their\ncommission‖ within the meaning of section 954. Charges are so connected if ― ‗ ―there is\na common element of substantial importance in their commission.‖ ‘ ‖ (Alcala v.\nSuperior Court (2008) 43 Cal.4th 1205, 1218, italics omitted.) Here, the crimes all\noccurred within a two-month time period and, as the trial court observed, each involved a\nfelonious intent to obtain property. (People v. Koontz (2002) 27 Cal.4th 1041, 1054–\n\n                                              28\n\f1058, 1074–1075 [petty theft charge was properly joined with unrelated murder, robbery,\nand vehicle-taking charges because the petty theft, robbery, and vehicle-taking charges\ninvolved ―the common characteristic of the wrongful taking of another‘s property‖];\nPeople v. Mendoza (2000) 24 Cal.4th 130, 160 [crimes were connected in their\ncommission when committed in close timeframe of three days and many of the crimes\ninvolved the felonious intent to obtain property].) Contrary to Romero‘s contention that\nthe ―tenor‖ of the Magnolia Center burglary was vandalism, not theft, defendants were\ncharged with burglary premised in part on entry with an intent to steal. Moreover, the\nevidence demonstrated defendants made a concerted but unsuccessful effort to break into\nthe Magnolia Center store safe and stole other items from the store. Neither the\ncircumstance that defendants also committed vandalism nor the minimal worth of the\nobjects taken obviated their intent to steal.\n     Nor did defendants move to sever the Magnolia Center burglary and vandalism\ncharges from the remaining counts, or Romero move to sever the charge of receiving\nstolen property from the remaining charges against him. The trial court has ―no statutory\nduty to order severance on its own motion.‖ (People v. Rogers (2006) 39 Cal.4th 826,\n851.) Defendants‘ claims that the trial court abused its discretion in denying severance\nare therefore also forfeited. (People v. Ramirez (2006) 39 Cal.4th 398, 439 [―defendant is\nlimited on appeal to arguing that the trial court erred in failing to sever the charges‖ in the\nmanner ―requested at trial‖]; see People v. Tafoya (2007) 42 Cal.4th 147, 163 [―defendant\nhas forfeited this issue on appeal because he failed to assert this ground at the time his\nseverance motion was heard by the trial court‖].)\n     Even assuming the claim is preserved, no abuse of discretion is demonstrated. ―The\nparty seeking severance has the burden to establish a substantial danger of prejudice\nrequiring the charges to be separately tried. [Citation.] Refusal to sever may be an abuse\nof discretion where (1) evidence of the crimes to be jointly tried would not be cross-\nadmissible in separate trials; (2) certain of the charges are unusually likely to inflame the\n                                                29\n\fjury against the defendant; (3) a ‗weak‘ case has been joined with a ‗strong‘ case or with\nanother ‗weak‘ case, so that the ‗spillover‘ effect of aggregate evidence on several\ncharges might well alter the outcome of some or all of the charges; and (4) any one of the\ncharges carries the death penalty or joinder of them turns the matter into a capital case.\n[Citation.] If evidence on each of the joined crimes would have been admissible in a\nseparate trial of the other crimes, then such cross-admissibility ordinarily dispels any\ninference of prejudice.‖ (People v. Gonzales and Soliz (2011) 52 Cal.4th 254, 281–282.)\n     Here, Self‘s counsel conceded at the hearing on the motion to sever the murder\ncounts from the remaining counts that the evidence in ―these cases‖ was ―cross-\nadmissible,‖ and Romero‘s counsel ―[j]oin[ed]‖ those remarks. On appeal, however,\ndefendants claim the evidence was not cross-admissible. ―We need not affirmatively\ndecide, however, whether the evidence would have been cross-admissible in separate\ntrials because, as defendant[s] acknowledge[], lack of cross-admissibility is not\ndispositive of whether the court abused its discretion in denying severance.‖ (People v.\nMyles (2012) 53 Cal.4th 1181, 1201, citing § 954.1.) Considering the remaining three\nfactors, we conclude no prejudice is demonstrated. Evidence of the murders, the burglary\nand vandalism of Magnolia Center, and Romero‘s receipt of stolen property was strong.\nNor was evidence of the Magnolia Center crimes or Romero‘s receipt of stolen property\nmore inflammatory than evidence defendants had callously murdered three young men,\nand attempted to murder three other individuals. Moreover, ―[e]ven where the People\npresent capital charges, joinder is proper so long as evidence of each charge is so strong\nthat consolidation is unlikely to affect the verdict.‖ (People v. Ochoa (2001) 26 Cal.4th\n398, 423.)\n     Self further contends joinder of the Magnolia Center crimes, in hindsight, produced\ngross unfairness amounting to deprivation of a fair trial or a denial of due process at the\nguilt phase because evidence of the details of the vandalism ―rais[ed] the possibility the\njury [would] be swayed by the evidence of defendant‘s bad character.‖ The evidence\n                                             30\n\fSelf murdered three individuals was strong and indeed is not challenged on appeal.\nThere is therefore no reasonable probability Self would not have been found guilty of\nthese murders had the jury not heard the evidence regarding the Magnolia Center crimes.\n     Likewise, and contrary to defendants‘ contention, joinder of the Magnolia Center\ncrimes, in hindsight, did not produce gross unfairness amounting to deprivation of a fair\ntrial or a denial of due process at the penalty phase. Given the brutal circumstances\nunderlying their three murder and three attempted murder convictions, and Self‘s\nadditional conviction for the attempted murder of Feltenberger, there is no reasonable\npossibility that a different verdict would have resulted had the jury not heard evidence of\nthreatening graffiti and the stabbing of a sonogram photograph during the Magnolia\nCenter burglary and vandalism. To the extent Romero asserts a similar claim regarding\njoinder of the receipt of stolen property charge, we have already concluded that even\nassuming evidence of the details of the attack on Feltenberger were improperly admitted,\nthere is no reasonable possibility a different penalty verdict would have resulted absent\nadmission of this evidence. (See ante, at pp. 26–27.)\n\nB.     Guilt Phase Issues\n\n       1.     Accomplice corroboration\n\n     The trial court instructed the jury that Jose Munoz was an accomplice as a matter of\nlaw as to certain crimes, including the crimes against Kenneth Mills and Vicky Ewy\n(counts V-VIII), and Knoefler (count XV), and ―his testimony [was] subject to the rule\nrequiring corroboration.‖9 (§ 1111; see ante, at pp. 3, 5.) Self contends Munoz‘s\n\n9      The court instructed Self‘s jury:\n       ―A defendant cannot be found guilty based upon the testimony of an accomplice\nunless such testimony is corroborated by other evidence which tends to connect such\ndefendant with the commission of the offense. . . . To corroborate the testimony of an\naccomplice there must be evidence of some act or fact related to the crime which, if\nbelieved, by itself and without any aid, interpretation, or direction from the testimony of\nthe accomplice, tends to connect the defendant with the commission of the crime\n                                             31\n\ftestimony was not corroborated and therefore his convictions for the crimes against\nKenneth Mills, Ewy, and Knoefler must be reversed. He further contends the evidence\nwas insufficient to establish his guilt as an aider and abettor of the crimes against\nKnoefler. We conclude Munoz‘s testimony was corroborated as to the crimes against\nKenneth Mills and Ewy, but not as to the robbery of Knoefler. We therefore reverse\nSelf‘s conviction and sentence for Knoefler‘s robbery.\n     Section 1111 provides in part: ―A conviction can not be had upon the testimony of\nan accomplice unless it be corroborated by such other evidence as shall tend to connect\nthe defendant with the commission of the offense; and the corroboration is not sufficient\nif it merely shows the commission of the offense or the circumstances thereof.‖ The\nrequirement that accomplice testimony be corroborated is an ― ‗exception[]‘ to the\nsubstantial evidence‖ rule. (People v. Najera (2008) 43 Cal.4th 1132, 1137.) It is based\non the Legislature‘s determination that ― ‗because of the reliability questions posed by‘ ‖\naccomplice testimony, such testimony ― ‗by itself is insufficient as a matter of law to\nsupport a conviction.‘ ‖ (Ibid.; see People v. Cuevas (1995) 12 Cal.4th 252, 261.)\nSection 1111 does not affect the admissibility of accomplice testimony but rather\n\ncharged. However, it is not necessary that the evidence of corroboration be sufficient in\nitself to establish every element of the crime charged or that it corroborate every fact to\nwhich the accomplice testifies. In determining whether an accomplice has been\ncorroborated, you must first assume the testimony of the accomplice has been removed\nfrom the case. You must then determine whether there is any remaining evidence which\ntends to connect the defendant with the commission of the crime. If there is not such\nindependent evidence that tends to connect the defendant with the commission of the\ncrime, the testimony of the accomplice is not corroborated. If there is such independent\nevidence which you believe, then the testimony of the accomplice is corroborated. If the\ncrimes charged in the Information except Counts XI–XIV, XVI, XVII, and XX–XXIII\n[were] committed by anyone, the witness Jose Munoz was an accomplice as a matter of\nlaw and his testimony is subject to the rule requiring corroboration. The testimony of an\naccomplice ought to be viewed with distrust. This does not mean that you may arbitrarily\ndisregard such testimony, but you should give to it the weight to which you find it to be\nentitled after examining it with care and caution and in the light of all the evidence in the\ncase.‖ (Italics added.)\n\n                                             32\n\f―reflects a legislative determination of how accomplice testimony must be treated.‖\n(Bryant, Smith and Wheeler, supra, 60 Cal.4th at p. 434; see id. at pp. 453–454; People v.\nBowley (1963) 59 Cal.2d 855, 858.)\n     Thus, for the jury to rely on an accomplice‘s testimony about the circumstances of\nan offense, it must find evidence that ― ‗without aid from the accomplice‘s testimony,\ntend[s] to connect the defendant with the crime.‘ ‖ (People v. Abilez (2007) 41 Cal.4th\n472, 505 (Abilez); see People v. Davis (2005) 36 Cal.4th 510, 543.) ―The entire conduct\nof the parties, their relationship, acts, and conduct may be taken into consideration by the\ntrier of fact in determining the sufficiency of the corroboration.‖ (People v. Rissman\n(1957) 154 Cal.App.2d 265, 278; see People v. Trujillo (1948) 32 Cal.2d 105, 111\n(Trujillo) [―The prosecution is not required to single out an isolated fact which in itself,\nunrelated to other proven facts, is considered to be sufficient corroboration‖].) The\nevidence ―need not independently establish the identity of the victim‘s assailant‖ (Abilez,\nat p. 506), nor corroborate every fact to which the accomplice testifies (Davis, at p. 543),\nand ― ‗may be circumstantial or slight and entitled to little consideration when standing\nalone‘ ‖ (Abilez, at p. 505). ―The trier of fact‘s determination on the issue of\ncorroboration is binding on the reviewing court unless the corroborating evidence should\nnot have been admitted or does not reasonably tend to connect the defendant with the\ncommission of the crime.‖ (People v. McDermott (2002) 28 Cal.4th 946, 986.)10\n\n\n\n\n     10 Although similarities between the circumstances of the crime—as evidenced\neither by the physical evidence or a witness‘s testimony—and an accomplice‘s testimony\ncannot be relied on under section 1111 to corroborate the accomplice‘s testimony, these\nsimilarities nevertheless do play a role. Even after deciding an accomplice‘s testimony is\ncorroborated, the jury is instructed to view it with caution. Similarities between the\naccomplice‘s account and the physical evidence or a victim‘s description of the crime\nlogically are considered in assessing that credibility.\n                                              33\n\f               a. Crimes against Kenneth Mills and Ewy\n     Kenneth Mills testified that on October 22, 1992, between 11:30 p.m. and midnight,\nhe and his girlfriend Vicky Ewy took a drive to look at the lightning. Mills was driving.\nAs they drove down Moreno Beach Drive, a dark grey or blue hatchback coming in the\nopposite direction made a U-turn and began to drive in front of them. At the next stop\nsign the cars were next to each other, and the other car turned on its high beams and\nfollowed the victims. As Mills started to turn right, he saw for ―no more than a second‖\nthe silhouette of a car next to him, and a ―person from the waist up out of the‖ front\n―passenger window pointing a gun at me.‖ The gun fired, hitting Mills in the face, and\nMills sped away. He could not see out of his right eye and the vision in his left eye was\nblurry. The assailants continued to chase them until Mills turned onto a golf cart path\nnear three model homes, one of which had all its lights on. Mills permanently lost vision\nin his right eye. A bullet hole was found in the top of the driver‘s window of Ewy‘s car\nand another hole near the bottom of the passenger window. Twenty-gauge plastic\nshotgun wadding was found on the passenger side floor. Shotgun pellets, too damaged\nfor their size to be determined, were found in the passenger door.\n     Munoz testified that on or about the night of October 22, 1992, he was riding with\ndefendants in Romero‘s girlfriend Sonia Alvarez‘s Dodge Colt in an isolated area past\nMoreno Valley and near Lake Perris. Romero was driving, Munoz was in the passenger\nseat, and Self was in the backseat. They had Self‘s sawed-off shotgun and a ―single shot‖\nrifle and were ―going out stealing.‖ They saw Ewy‘s red car, which Munoz identified at\ntrial, and turned around. They pulled up alongside the car at a stop sign, and Munoz ―was\nready to get out . . . [and] carjack them.‖ But Romero said, ―Shoot ‘em,‖ and Self\nclimbed out of the backseat window on the driver‘s side and fired the shotgun across the\ntop of the Colt at the victims. The bullet hit the victims‘ driver‘s window, and the\nvictims drove away.\n\n\n\n                                             34\n\f      Munoz‘s testimony was corroborated in part by the circumstance that 20-gauge\nshotgun wadding was found in Ewy‘s car on the passenger side floor. Self admitted in\nhis statement to police that he had possessed a 20-gauge shotgun for about a month\nbefore he shot Feltenberger on November 30, 1992, and victim Jerry Mills, Sr. identified\nSelf as the person holding a shotgun in that robbery. ―Possession of a gun similar to that\nused in the commission of the crime has been deemed competent corroborative\nevidence . . . .‖ (People v. Henderson (1949) 34 Cal.2d 340, 343; id at pp. 344, 346\n[accomplice testimony corroborated in part by the circumstance the defendant purchased\na .410 shotgun the day before the attempted robbery in which such a shotgun was used];\nsee Trujillo, supra, 32 Cal.2d at pp. 111-112 [accomplice testimony corroborated in part\nby evidence the bullet that killed the victim could have come from the gun the defendant\nadmitted was in his possession before the crime and which was found in his room after\nhis arrest].)\n      In his statement to police Self also admitted purchasing 20-gauge shells for the\nshotgun about two weeks before the attack on Feltenberger, and appeared to say that\nbefore this purchase he ―had shells to the gauge, this other guy, but those . . . weren‘t the\nsame ones, we got those mixed up.‖ Thus, although it is unclear, the jury could infer Self\nnot only had 20-gauge shells before he purchased the one used on Feltenberger, but that\nhe had used 20-gauge shells on another ―guy.‖\n      Munoz‘s testimony was further corroborated by the circumstance that about a month\nlater, on November 30, 1992, he and Self attacked and robbed Feltenberger in a manner\nsimilar to that of the attack on Kenneth Mills and Ewy. (People v. Washington (1969)\n71 Cal.2d 1061, 1093 [accomplice‘s testimony corroborated by the testimony of\nnumerous witnesses who identified the defendant as a participant in similarly perpetrated\nrobberies on the same night and in the same vicinity as the robbery to which the\naccomplice testified, and a witness‘s identification of the car being driven away from the\nscene of the robbery ―matched the description of the car given by other victims as the one\n                                             35\n\fin which defendant was riding‖]; People v. Barillas (1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1012, 1021\n[proof the defendant ―committed three robberies or attempted robberies earlier that same\nevening using the same white pickup and having the same coperpetrator‖ in part\ncorroborated accomplice testimony]; People v. Blackwell (1967) 257 Cal.App.2d 313,\n320–321 [―similarity in the commission of crimes in a given locality is itself a\ncircumstance tending to corroborate the testimony of an accomplice‖]; People v.\nComstock (1956) 147 Cal.App.2d 287, 298 [―Proof that a defendant committed other\nrecent and similar offenses tending to show a consistent plan or method of misconduct‖\nmay corroborate accomplice testimony].) Here, in both the attack on Kenneth Mills and\nEwy and the attack on Feltenberger, the victims were driving in isolated areas late at\nnight when a car suddenly appeared and drove beside them before the shotgun attack.\nAlthough Feltenberger pulled over before he was shot, he only did so because he mistook\nthe perpetrators‘ car for that of his newspaper carrier; indeed, Self said in his statement to\npolice, Munoz ―saw [Feltenberger] and tried to cut him off.‖ Feltenberger identified Self\nas the person who shot him with a shotgun, and Self admitted to police he was with\nMunoz that night and wounded Feltenberger with his 20-gauge shotgun.\n     In sum, Munoz‘s testimony was corroborated as to the crimes against Kenneth Mills\nand Vicky Ewy.\n\n               b. Robbery of Knoefler\n     Self contends no evidence corroborated Munoz‘s testimony that Self was ―even in\nthe car or otherwise present at the scene‖ of Knoefler‘s robbery. We agree.\n     Knoefler testified that on November 20, 1992, about 3:30 p.m., he was tending\nbeehives at Markham Street and Washington Street in Riverside County. Parked nearby\nwas his 1987 pickup truck. A man approached Knoefler, struck up a conversation about\nthe bees, and walked around the bee yard. Knoefler testified he ―seemed to be [a] pretty\nnice guy.‖ The man then brandished what appeared to be a sawed-off shotgun and\n\n\n                                             36\n\fdemanded the keys to Knoefler‘s truck. Knoefler gave him the keys. Another man\nwearing a ski mask appeared. The first man said he needed some money for gas, and\nKnoefler handed him about $50. The men left in the truck.\n     Munoz testified that during the daytime on or about November 20, 1992, he was\nriding in Alvarez‘s Colt with defendants and Chavez. They were ―going to go steal,‖ and\nwere carrying Self‘s 20-gauge shotgun and perhaps another weapon. They noticed the\nbeekeeper, and decided to send Romero, carrying Self‘s shotgun, to see what valuables\nthe man had. After a few minutes, Munoz, wearing a mask, went to see what ―was taking\nhim so long‖ and hid when he heard Romero and the beekeeper talking. Romero told the\n―old man‖ he needed his truck, and the man said, ―I was wondering why you were being\nso nice to me.‖ Munoz appeared and Romero told the man ―I‘m going to need gas\nmoney,‖ and the man offered Romero $25. Romero said he wanted all of it, and the man\ngave him about $75. Munoz and Romero then left in Knoefler‘s truck and drove back to\nthe Colt. Self and Chavez, in the Colt, followed Romero and Munoz to an open field.\nRomero and Munoz pushed the truck down an embankment, then got into the Colt and\nleft the area.\n     Although a shotgun was used in the robbery, and Self admitted in his statement to\npolice that he had possessed a shotgun for about a month before he shot Feltenberger on\nNovember 30, 1992, there is no dispute Romero, not Self, was holding the shotgun when\nKnoefler was robbed. Thus, this circumstance does not corroborate Munoz‘s testimony\nthat Self was present at the robbery. (See People v. Robinson (1964) 61 Cal.2d 373, 379,\n398 [the defendant‘s fingerprints on a car associated with the murder did not connect the\ndefendant to the murder given both the defendant and the car‘s recent owner were\nfrequent visitors to the defendant‘s cousin‘s apartment and there was no evidence as to\nwhen the fingerprints were left on the car].)\n\n\n\n\n                                                37\n\f     In her brief the Attorney General asserts Munoz‘s testimony is ―largely corroborated\nby Knoefler‘s testimony; specifically, that Romero, armed with a shotgun, and Munoz,\narriving a bit later, robbed him of his cash and fled in his truck.‖ We disagree.\n     As noted above, section 1111 provides that an accomplice‘s testimony is not\ncorroborated by evidence that ―merely shows the commission of the offense or the\ncircumstances thereof.‖ In other words, an accomplice‘s testimony is not corroborated by\nthe circumstance that the testimony is consistent with the victim‘s description of the\ncrime or physical evidence from the crime scene. Such consistency and knowledge of the\ndetails of the crime simply proves the accomplice was at the crime scene, something the\naccomplice by definition admits. Rather, under section 1111, the corroboration must\nconnect the defendant to the crime independent of the accomplice‘s testimony.\n     As originally enacted in 1872, section 1111 provided: ―A conviction cannot be had\non the testimony of an accomplice, unless he is corroborated by other evidence which in\nitself, and without the aid of the testimony of the accomplice, tends to connect the\ndefendant with the commission of the offense; and the corroboration is not sufficient, if it\nmerely shows the commission of the offense, or the circumstances thereof.‖ (Ann. Pen.\nCode (1872) p. 390.) A note following section 1111 in the annotated Penal Code cites\nand quotes from People v. Ames (1870) 39 Cal. 403. In Ames, the robbers were disguised\nand used numbers during the robbery to refer to one another. (Id. at pp. 403–404) At one\npoint a robber was referred to as ―Charley‖ and the speaker immediately substituted the\nterm ―Number Three.‖ (Ibid.) One of the robbers testified at trial that the defendant\nCharles Ames was known as ―Charley,‖ and during the robbery was designated ―Number\nThree.‖ (Id. at p. 404.) This court reversed the judgment against the defendant, stating:\n―[T]he corroborating evidence must, of itself, and without the aid of the testimony of the\naccomplice, tend, in some degree, to connect the defendant with the commission of the\noffense. It need not, of course, be sufficient to establish his guilt; for, in that event, the\ntestimony of the accomplice would not be needed. But it must tend, in some slight\n                                               38\n\fdegree at least, to implicate the defendant. . . . [A]side from the testimony of the\naccomplice, and laying that entirely out of view, there was no evidence whatever in this\ncase ‗tending to connect the defendant with the commission of the offense.‘ The fact that\none of the robbers was addressed as ‗Charley,‘ and again as ‗Number Three,‘ and that\nthey designated each other by numbers, no more tends, of itself, to connect the defendant\nwith the crime than it would . . . any one else.‖ (Id. at pp. 404–405.)\n     In 1911, the statute was revised, as relevant here, to its present form (except for the\nsubstitution in 1915 of ―it‖ for ―he‖ in the first clause). (Stats. 1911, ch. 292, § 1, p. 484.)\nThis court subsequently held that the 1911 amendment did not change the meaning of the\nstatute. (People v. Robbins (1915) 171 Cal. 466, 473–474.) Our cases continue to refer\nto the requirement that the corroborating evidence ― ‗must, without aid from the\naccomplice‘s testimony, tend to connect the defendant with the crime‘ ‖ (Abilez, supra,\n41 Cal.4th at p. 505), and Self‘s jury here was so instructed.11 (See ante, p. 31, fn. 9.)\n     We conclude Munoz‘s testimony that Self robbed Knoefler was not corroborated.\nReversing this conviction does not affect the penalty judgment because, given the nature\nof Self‘s additional crimes, there is no reasonable possibility the penalty judgment would\nhave been different had he not been convicted of Knoefler‘s robbery. Given that we\nreverse Self‘s conviction for the Knoefler robbery, we need not address Self‘s further\nclaim that no substantial evidence supports his conviction for this offense under a theory\nof aiding and abetting.\n\n\n\n11      In People v. Miranda (1987) 44 Cal.3d 57, 100, this court stated a witness‘s\ndescription of the events that led to a stabbing closely matched the accomplice‘s version\nof events, and this ―evidence was enough to connect defendant with the killing and\ntherefore to support the credibility‖ of the accomplice. In Miranda, however, in addition\nto the similarity in detail between the witness‘s and the accomplice‘s accounts, the\nwitness observed the defendant hold a knife to the victim‘s throat and then follow the\nvictim down the street. (Id. at p. 93.) Such evidence independently linked the defendant\nto the stabbing.\n\n                                              39\n\f       2. Evidence of Romero’s attempted escape\n\n     Defendant Romero contends that the trial court erred in admitting escape evidence\nbecause it amounted to no more than planning and did not constitute an attempt. We\ndisagree.\n     Before trial the prosecutor moved to admit escape evidence at the guilt phase.\nRomero unsuccessfully opposed the motion on the ground that it was unduly prejudicial\nunder Evidence Code section 352.12\n     ― ‗Evidence of a planned escape permits an inference of consciousness of guilt, even\nif the escape was not actually attempted.‘ ‖ (People v. Box (2000) 23 Cal.4th 1153,\n1205.) Moreover, here there was substantial evidence of an attempted escape. Although\nthe terms ―escape‖ and ―attempted escape‖ are ―not statutorily defined, case law has\ndefined ‗escape‘ as the unauthorized or ‗ ―unlawful departure of a prisoner from the\nlimits of his custody.‖ ‘ [Citations.] ‗The crime is completed when the prisoner wilfully\nleaves the prison camp, without authorization . . . .‘ ‖ (People v. Bailey (2012) 54 Cal.4th\n740, 748–749 (Bailey).) Attempted escape requires ―a specific intent to escape‖ and ― ‗a\ndirect, unequivocal act to effect that purpose.‘ ‖ (Id. at p. 749.)\n     Here, Romero‘s intent to escape was demonstrated by his statement to fellow inmate\nDicken that he was planning to escape by taking the nighttime deputy hostage,\nthreatening him with a shank, and leaving the jail. Romero also committed acts to\neffectuate this intent when he obtained hacksaw blades, completely severed the bars to\nhis cell, creating a hole large enough to escape, and armed himself. (See People v.\nMason (1991) 52 Cal.3d 909, 954–955 (Mason) [noting the defendant attempted to\nescape once by sawing loose on two sides the metal screen that covered his cell window\n\n\n12    Evidence Code section 352 provides: ―The court in its discretion may exclude\nevidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the probability that its\nadmission will (a) necessitate undue consumption of time or (b) create substantial danger\nof undue prejudice, of confusing the issues, or of misleading the jury.‖\n\n                                              40\n\fand again by making a three- by three-inch cut in the replacement screen]; compare\nPeople v. Lancaster (2007) 41 Cal.4th 50, 91, 94 (Lancaster) [mere possession of a\nhandcuff key ―was not sufficient to establish an escape attempt‖].) As the Attorney\nGeneral observes, Romero ―did everything but actually escape from his cell.‖\n        Romero contends that this evidence shows he only prepared to escape but did not\nattempt to escape because ―he had not started going anywhere.‖ We have previously\nrejected this view. ― ‗The introduction into the concept of attempt to escape of a\nrequirement of intentionally doing an act, the direct, natural and probable consequence of\nwhich, if successfully completed, would be an escape, too narrowly limits the application\nof the statute. Such an act could be to pass part way through a door, window or other\nopening to the outside of the place of confinement before falling back, being pulled back\nor disabled. [¶] . . . [¶] The Legislature has not proscribed the doing of any single\ndefined act as an attempt to escape. Many acts, including some non-criminal in\nthemselves, might be conducive toward carrying out an intention to escape, and the scope\nof the statute proscribing such an attempt should not be limited to specifically designated\nacts.‘ [Citation.] Thus, the heightened mental state required for an attempt to escape\nserves to ‗separate[] criminality itself from otherwise innocuous behavior.‘ (United\nStates v. Bailey [(1980)] 444 U.S. [394,] 405.)‖ (Bailey, supra, 54 Cal.4th at pp. 750–\n751.)\n\n         3.     Asserted prosecutorial misconduct\n\n        Self contends the prosecutor repeatedly vouched for the credibility of Jose Munoz\nduring his opening statement and closing argument. Not so.\n        Self did not object to the prosecutor‘s statements or seek an admonition, and no\nexception to the general rule requiring an objection and request for admonition is\napplicable. The claim is therefore forfeited. (Samayoa, supra, 15 Cal.4th at p. 841.)\n\n\n\n                                              41\n\f     It is also meritless. ―A prosecutor is prohibited from vouching for the credibility of\nwitnesses or otherwise bolstering the veracity of their testimony by referring to evidence\noutside the record.‖ (People v. Frye (1998) 18 Cal.4th 894, 971 (Frye).) ―However, so\nlong as a prosecutor‘s assurances regarding the apparent honesty or reliability of\nprosecution witnesses are based on the ‗facts of [the] record and the inferences\nreasonably drawn therefrom, rather than any purported personal knowledge or belief,‘\n[his] comments cannot be characterized as improper vouching.‖ (Ibid.) Here, the\nprosecutor simply advanced the view Munoz was credible based on the evidence, which\nis permissible.\n     Self further asserts counsel was ineffective in failing to object to the prosecutor‘s\nstatements. For example, Self contends effective counsel would have objected when the\nprosecutor improperly referred to Munoz‘s statement to police, thus implying that\nevidence the jury had not seen established Munoz‘s veracity. Contrary to Self‘s\nimplication, the jury heard nearly all of Munoz‘s statement, and the remainder was\ndescribed by the interviewing officer. There was no misconduct, hence there was no\nvalid basis for objection.\n\n       4.     Asserted instructional error\n\n                  a. Accomplice instructions\n     Self contends the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury sua sponte it could\nnot aggregate evidence or incidents to corroborate the accomplice testimony of Munoz\nand to determine guilt. There was no error.\n     The trial court instructed the jury in the language of CALJIC No. 17.02: ―Each\ncount charges a distinct crime. You must decide each count separately. The defendant\nmay be found guilty or not guilty of any or all of the crimes charged. Your finding as to\neach count must be stated in a separate verdict.‖ Self contends the court, sua sponte,\nshould have modified this instruction to tell the jury it ―must decide each count separately\n\n\n                                               42\n\fon the law and the evidence applicable to it, including the evidence required to\ncorroborate the accomplice‘s testimony.‖\n     Self has forfeited this claim by failing to request a modification of CALJIC\nNo. 17.02. (People v. Geier (2007) 41 Cal.4th 555, 579 [the defendant‘s failure ―even to\npropose a modification of CALJIC No. 17.02, or to propose an additional instruction‖\nforfeited the instructional error claim].)\n     The claim also lacks merit. The instructions given informed the jury of the offenses\nfor which Munoz was an accomplice as a matter of law, and that his testimony as to\ncertain charged offenses must be ―corroborated by other evidence which tends to connect\nsuch defendant with the commission of the offense.‖ (Italics added.) They further\nprovided, ―To corroborate the testimony of an accomplice there must be evidence of\nsome act or fact related to the crime which, if believed, by itself and without any aid,\ninterpretation, or direction from the testimony of the accomplice, tends to connect the\ndefendant with the commission of the crime charged.‖ (Italics added.) This language\ninformed the jury that evidence corroborating Munoz‘s testimony was required for each\ncount as to which Munoz was an accomplice as a matter of law. Contrary to Self‘s\nassertion, there is no reasonable likelihood the jury would have understood the\ninstructions to mean it could ―use[] Feltenberger‘s corroborating testimony as to counts\nXVIII and XIX to find the requisite corroboration on unrelated counts V through VII,‖ or\ntreat ―Munoz‘s accomplice testimony as to counts I and II‖ as ―corroborated by the\nvictim‘s testimony in the unrelated . . . Meredith robbery (count IV) or by‖ Rankin‘s\ntestimony regarding the shooting in counts IX and X.\n     Self further contends that in the absence of his proposed instruction the jury likely\nwould ―treat evidence of [Self‘s] involvement on some counts as evidence of his guilt on\nother, unrelated counts charged against him.‖ To the extent Self claims the jury could not\nconsider evidence on one count to prove his guilt on other counts we reject the claim.\n(See People v. Lynch (2010) 50 Cal.4th 693, 760–761 [trial court properly refused to give\n                                             43\n\fproposed instruction that each count must be proven independently of the other counts\nbecause the evidence was cross-admissible and the jury was instructed in the language of\nCALJIC No. 17.02].)\n\n               b. CALJIC No. 3.02\n     Romero contends instruction in the language of CALJIC No. 3.02 creates an\nunconstitutional mandatory presumption that aiding and abetting a robbery in which\nmurder was a natural and probable consequence is equivalent to aiding and abetting\nmurder, and thus ―effectively require[s]‖ the jury to presume ―intent to encourage or\nfacilitate a murder.‖13 We need not address this issue because the jury here was also\ninstructed on felony murder based on robbery and found true robbery-murder special-\ncircumstance allegations as to all three murders.14 We can deduce from these special\n\n13      The court instructed the jury in the language of CALJIC No. 3.02: ―One who\naid[s] and abets another in the commission of a crime is not only guilty of that crime but\nis also guilty of any other crime committed by the principal which is a natural and\nprobable consequence of the crime[] originally aided and abetted. In order to find the\ndefendant guilty of the crime of murder . . . as an aider and abettor, you must be satisfied\nbeyond a reasonable doubt: One, the crime of robbery or attempt[ed] robbery was\ncommitted; Two, the defendant aided and abetted such crime; Three, a co-principal in\nsuch crime committed the crime of murder, and, Four, the crime of murder was a natural\nand probable consequence of the commission of the crime of robbery or attempt[ed]\nrobbery.‖\n14      The trial court instructed the jury: ―The unlawful killing of a human being,\nwhether intentional, unintentional, or accidental, which occurs during the commission or\nattempted commission of the crime as a direct causal result of robbery is murder of the\nfirst degree when the perpetrator had the specific intent to commit such crime. The\nspecific intent to commit robbery and the commission or attempted commission of such\ncrime must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. If a human being is killed by any one\nof several persons engaged in the commission or attempted commission of the crime of\nrobbery, all persons who either directly and actively commit the act constituting such\ncrime, or who with knowledge of the unlawful purpose of the perpetrator of the crime and\nwith the intent or purpose of committing, encouraging, or facilitating the commission of\nthe offense aid, promote, encourage, or instigate by act or advice its commission, are\nguilty of murder in the first degree whether the killing is intentional, unintentional, or\naccidental.‖\n\n                                             44\n\fcircumstance findings that the jury necessarily found Romero guilty of first degree\nfelony-murder under section 189. (People v. Hovarter (2008) 44 Cal.4th 983, 1019.)\nUnder the felony-murder rule those who commit enumerated felonies are ― ‗strictly\nresponsible for any killing committed by a cofelon, whether intentional, negligent, or\naccidental, during the perpetration or attempted perpetration of the felony.‘ ‖ (People v.\nGonzales (2011) 51 Cal.4th 894, 943.) Thus, there was no need for the jury to find, as\nRomero contends, an ―intent to encourage or facilitate a murder.‖\n     The felony-murder rule operates independently from an ―aider and abettor‘s liability\nfor murder under the natural and probable consequences doctrine.‖ (People v. Chiu\n(2014) 59 Cal.4th 155, 166.) To the extent the jury understood it also needed to find ―the\ncrime of murder was a natural and probable consequence of the commission of the crime\nof robbery or attempt[ed] robbery‖ because it was instructed in the language of CALJIC\nNo. 3.02, Romero could have only benefitted from this ambiguity.\n\n               c. Reasonable doubt instruction\n     Defendants contend instruction in the language of CALJIC No. 2.90 does not\nadequately define reasonable doubt. Self additionally contends such instruction in\nconjunction with other jury instructions impermissibly undermined and diluted the\nprosecutor‘s burden of proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.15 We disagree.\n\n\n\n15      Both juries received the standard instruction on reasonable doubt. The court\ninstructed Romero‘s jury: ―A defendant in a criminal action is presumed to be innocent\nuntil the contrary is proved, and in case of a reasonable doubt whether his guilt is\nsatisfactorily shown, he is entitled to a verdict of not guilty. This presumption places\nupon the People . . . the burden of proving him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\nReasonable doubt is defined as follows: It is not a mere possible doubt, because\neverything relating to human affairs is open to some possible or imaginary doubt. It is\nthat state of the case which, after the entire comparison and consideration of all the\nevidence, leaves the minds of the jurors in that condition that they cannot say they feel an\nabiding conviction of the truth of the charge.‖ A virtually identical instruction was given\nto Self‘s jury.\n\n                                            45\n\f     The court‘s instruction properly defined the prosecution‘s burden of proof. (People\nv. Brown (2004) 33 Cal.4th 382, 391–392 [upholding instruction substantially similar to\nthat given here] (Brown); see Victor v. Nebraska (1994) 511 U.S. 1, 14–15 [―An\ninstruction cast in terms of an abiding conviction as to guilt, without reference to moral\ncertainty, correctly states the government‘s burden of proof‖].) Thus, contrary to Self‘s\nassertion, there is no reasonable likelihood the jurors understood the instruction to mean\n―they must articulate reason and logic for their doubt . . . before such doubt[] could be\nconsidered sufficient to acquit.‖ (See People v. Capistrano (2014) 59 Cal.4th 830, 879\n(Capistrano).) Nor, as he also asserts, does the instruction erroneously inform the jury\nthat reasonable doubt is ―not a mere possible doubt‖ (Capistrano, at p. 880) or err in the\nuse of the term ―until‖ instead of ―unless‖ when it provides ― ‗[a] defendant in a criminal\naction is presumed to be innocent until the contrary is proved‘ ‖ (People v. Lucas (2014)\n60 Cal.4th 153, 295–296 (Lucas); People v. Thomas (2012) 53 Cal.4th 771, 812).\nContrary to his assertion, CALJIC No. 2.90 is not wanting because it does not expressly\nstate ―that the accused need not present any evidence for the jury to have a reasonable\ndoubt,‖ given there is no reasonable likelihood the jury understood the instruction to\nmean Self had the burden of producing sufficient evidence to raise a reasonable doubt of\nhis guilt. (Frye, supra, 18 Cal.4th at p. 974.) Further, and contrary to Romero‘s\nassertion, changes in the instruction after the crime and before trial deleting reference to\nmoral evidence and moral certainty do not implicate due process and ex post facto\nconcerns. (Brown, at pp. 390–392.)\n     ―[W]e have previously considered and rejected the argument‖ that instruction in the\nlanguage of CALJIC No. 2.90 in conjunction with other instructions ―improperly\ndilute[s] the constitutional requirement that guilt be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.‖\n(People v. Vines (2011) 51 Cal.4th 830, 885 (Vines) [rejecting challenge to CALJIC\nNos. 2.01, 2.21.2, 2.27]; see People v. Sattiewhite (2014) 59 Cal.4th 446, 479 [rejecting\nchallenge to CALJIC No. 1.00]; People v. Solomon (2010) 49 Cal.4th 792, 826–828\n                                             46\n\f[rejecting challenges to CALJIC Nos. 2.01, 2.11, 2.21.2]; People v. Roberts (1992)\n2 Cal.4th 271, 314–315 [no possible prejudice in giving over the defendant‘s objection\nCALJIC Nos. 2.60 and 2.61 concerning a defendant‘s right not to testify].) Self\n―advances no persuasive reason to reconsider our prior rejection of challenges to these\ninstructions, and we decline to do so.‖ (Vines, at p. 885.)\n\n               d. Error in allowing jury to make two special circumstance findings as\n                  to each murder count\n     Romero contends the trial court erred in instructing the jury to make two multiple-\nmurder special-circumstance findings as to each count of murder. (§ 190.2, subd. (a)(3).)\nThe Attorney General concedes the error. We agree, and vacate five duplicative\nmultiple-murder special-circumstance findings for each defendant. (People v. Hardy\n(1992) 2 Cal.4th 86, 191, 216.) Contrary to Romero‘s assertion, he was not prejudiced by\nthe duplicative findings. Rather, we apply the settled rule that ―the jury‘s consideration\nof duplicative multiple-murder special circumstances is harmless where, as here, the jury\nknows the number of murders on which the special circumstances are based.‖ (People v.\nMarshall (1996) 13 Cal.4th 799, 855.)\n\n       5.     Validity of section 190.2, subdivision (d)\n\n     Romero contends that section 190.2, subdivision (d), enacted in 1990 by Proposition\n115, is invalid because Proposition 114, also on the 1990 ballot, received more votes.\nWe have previously rejected this argument and Romero cites no persuasive reason to\nrevisit our conclusion. (People v. Morgan (2007) 42 Cal.4th 593, 621–622; Yoshisato v.\nSuperior Court (1992) 2 Cal.4th 978, 989–992.)\n\n\n\n\n                                             47\n\fC.       Penalty Phase Issues\n\n         1.    Assertedly biased jurors\n     Self contends that Jurors Nos. 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11, and 1416 were ―strongly in favor of\nthe death penalty and should have been dismissed for cause‖ because they were actually\nbiased against him on the penalty issue. The claim is forfeited because Self challenged\nonly one of these jurors (Juror No. 8) for cause, and did not use an available peremptory\nchallenge to remove that juror.17 (People v. Nunez and Satele (2013) 57 Cal.4th 1, 25–26\n[failure to use a peremptory challenge to remove a prospective juror forfeits a claim the\ntrial court erred in denying a challenge for cause against the prospective juror]; People v.\nCoffman and Marlow (2004) 34 Cal.4th 1, 48 (Coffman and Marlow) [failure to\nchallenge for cause purportedly biased jurors ―forfeit[s] any appellate claim of error in\nthe seating of those jurors‖].) Nor did Self object to the jury as finally constituted.\n(People v. Souza (2012) 54 Cal.4th 90, 130; People v. Virgil (2011) 51 Cal.4th 1210,\n1239.)\n     In an appropriate case, a forfeited claim of juror bias can be asserted on appeal\nunder the rubric of ineffective assistance of counsel. Self further contends trial counsel\nwas ineffective in failing to challenge for cause and then excuse by peremptory challenge\nJuror Nos. 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 11, and 14. ―[A] prospective juror may be challenged for cause\nbased upon his or her views regarding capital punishment only if those views would\n‗ ― ‗prevent or substantially impair‘ ‖ the performance of the juror‘s duties as defined by\nthe court‘s instructions and the juror‘s oath.‘ [Citation.] A prospective juror who would\nbe unable conscientiously to consider all of the sentencing alternatives, including, when\nappropriate, the death penalty, is properly subject to excusal for cause. [Citation.] Our\n\n\n16     Juror No. 14, originally an alternate, served on the jury during both the guilt and\npenalty phases.\n17     We disapprove any language to the contrary in People v. Whalen (2013) 56\nCal.4th 1, 51.\n\n                                              48\n\freview of the record confirms that none of the [eight] jurors who defendant asserts were\nbiased would have been properly excused under this standard, as each expressed a\nwillingness to consider all the evidence presented before reaching a decision as to\npenalty. Counsel therefore did not perform deficiently in not challenging those jurors for\ncause.‖ (Coffman and Marlow, supra, 34 Cal.4th at p. 48.)\n     Nor on this record has Self demonstrated counsel was ineffective in not removing\nthese jurors by peremptory challenge. (People v. Montiel (1993) 5 Cal.4th 877, 911\n[―Because the use of peremptory challenges is inherently subjective and intuitive, an\nappellate record will rarely disclose reversible incompetence in this process‖].)\n\n       2.     Evidentiary issues\n\n               a.   Victim impact evidence\n     Before the penalty phase began, Self, joined by Romero, unsuccessfully moved to\nexclude all victim impact evidence. Self here contends that the trial court erroneously\nadmitted victim impact evidence, and that the prosecutor committed misconduct by\noffering and then arguing this evidence. Both defendants challenge the quantity and\ncontent of the evidence. We reject the claims.\n     ―In a capital trial, evidence showing the direct impact of the defendant‘s acts on the\nvictims‘ friends and family is not barred by the Eighth or Fourteenth Amendments to the\nfederal Constitution. (Payne v. Tennessee (1991) 501 U.S. 808, 825–827.) Under\nCalifornia law, victim impact evidence is admissible at the penalty phase under section\n190.3, factor (a), as a circumstance of the crime, provided the evidence is not so\ninflammatory as to elicit from the jury an irrational or emotional response untethered to\nthe facts of the case.‖ (People v. Pollock (2004) 32 Cal.4th 1153, 1180 (Pollock).) We\nconclude neither the federal nor the state standard was violated here.\n     Defendants contend that the victim impact evidence was ―excessive, improper,\ninflammatory, and highly prejudicial.‖ Defendants did not object at any time during the\n\n\n                                             49\n\ftestimony, and this claim is therefore forfeited. (People v. Wilson (2005) 36 Cal.4th 309,\n357 (Wilson) [failure to object to victim impact testimony as exceeding the scope of\n§ 190.3, factor (a) forfeits the claim].) Self‘s motion in limine sought to broadly exclude\nall victim impact evidence on constitutional grounds, and did not specifically object to\nthe admission of any particular witness‘s testimony anticipated in this case. (See\ngenerally People v. Morris (1991) 53 Cal.3d 152, 189–190.) Thus denial of the motion in\nlimine did not make objection during testimony redundant, but rather it was incumbent on\ndefendants to object if they believed the testimony actually presented was ―excessive,\nimproper, inflammatory, and highly prejudicial.‖ (See id. at p. 190.)\n     The claim is also meritless. A total of six witnesses were presented from the\nfamilies and friends of the three murder victims. (See ante, at pp. 10-11.) The testimony\ntook place on a single day before both juries and spans 96 pages of the reporter‘s\ntranscript. Twelve photographs of Jose Aragon or aspects of his life, nine of Joey Mans,\nand seven of Timothy Jones, were admitted. The evidence can scarcely be characterized\nas ―excessive.‖\n     Moreover, the content of the testimony was neither inflammatory nor unduly\nprejudicial. ― ‗[U]nless it invites a purely irrational response, evidence of the effect of a\ncapital murder on the loved ones of the victim and the community is relevant and\nadmissible under section 190.3, factor (a) as a circumstance of the crime. [Citation.] The\nfederal Constitution bars victim impact evidence only if it is so unduly prejudicial as to\nrender the trial fundamentally unfair.‘ ‖ (Vines, supra, 51 Cal.4th at p. 889.) Here, the\ntestimony fell well within these bounds and was similar to that we have previously\nupheld. (See People v. Murtishaw (2011) 51 Cal.4th 574, 579, 581–582, 595; People v.\nVerdugo (2010) 50 Cal.4th 263, 296–298; People v. Dykes (2009) 46 Cal.4th 731, 779–\n783 (Dykes); Wilson, supra, 36 Cal.4th at p. 357.) Contrary to Self‘s contention, that the\nwitnesses described events that occurred before or after the murders was proper. (Brown,\nsupra, 33 Cal.4th at pp. 397–398.) Their recollections ―simply served to explain why\n                                              50\n\fthey continued to be affected by [the] loss and to show the ‗victim[s‘] ―uniqueness as . . .\nindividual human being[s].‖ ‘ ‖ (Id. at p. 398, quoting Payne v. Tennessee, supra, 501\nU.S. at p. 823.)\n     Self relies on comments made by the trial court during record correction six years\nafter trial. While addressing requests to settle the record as to gestures by attorneys or\nwitnesses during the five-month trial the court commented it did not think it was\n―possible or realistic for us to go that far back in time to remember what a witness was\npointing at or what type of gesture they were making or what type of demeanor they were\ndemonstrating.‖ The court stated that although it had some independent recollection of\nevents during trial they were ―few and far between.‖ It did recall certain events,\nincluding when the victim impact testimony was presented, saying it was a ―very painful\nand agonizing [day] for everyone who was in the courtroom,‖ ―there wasn‘t a dry eye in\nthe courtroom,‖ and ―[t]hat‘s the day that I will always have with me.‖ These comments\ndo not demonstrate that the victim impact evidence was unduly prejudicial or that ―the\ncourt‘s impartiality was undermined‖ by the evidence. Indeed, trial courts must be aware\nof juror and spectator reactions as part of their diligent trial management, and we\npresume they are capable of setting this information aside when rendering their rulings.\n(See People v. Chatman (2006) 38 Cal.4th 344, 365.) Moreover, the callous and\nunprovoked nature of the murders understandably triggered an emotional reaction in the\npersons who testified and those observing in the courtroom, but this did not render the\ntestimony inflammatory or unduly prejudicial. (People v. Jurado (2006) 38 Cal.4th 72,\n132, 134 [―The record does not support defendant‘s suggestion that after hearing the\nvictim impact testimony the jurors were so overwhelmed by emotion that they were\nunable to make a rational determination of penalty,‖ where ―at least two of the jurors had\nbeen in tears‖ at the break and ―defendant had been ‗crying and sobbing‘ as well‖];\nWilson, supra, 36 Cal.4th at p. 357 [approving admission of evidence of victim‘s\n― ‗understandable human reactions‘ ‖]; see generally People v. Zamudio (2008) 43\n                                             51\n\fCal.4th 327, 368 (Zamudio) [―Although jurors must never be influenced by passion or\nprejudice,‖ ―the requested instruction is misleading to the extent it indicates that emotions\nmay play no part in a juror‘s decision to opt for the death penalty‖].)\n     Self also contends that ― ‗expansive‘ ‖ victim impact evidence ― ‗will inevitably\nmake way for racial discrimination to operate in the capital sentencing jury‘s life or death\ndecision.‘ ‖ Relying on Turner v. Murray (1986) 476 U.S. 28, he further asserts racial\nprejudice will remain undetected, and that this ―danger is particularly acute where the\njury, as here, is virtually all Caucasian—as were two of the victims—and [Self] is\nHispanic.‖ In Turner v. Murray, which involved ―a black man sentenced to death for the\nmurder of a white storekeeper,‖ the high court held the trial court erred in failing to allow\nquestioning of prospective jurors on the issue of racial prejudice. (Turner, at pp. 29, 33,\n36–37.) Self fails to demonstrate how Turner bears on the issue of admission of victim\nimpact evidence, or otherwise supports his assertion that the victim impact evidence here\n―invited both arbitrary or invidious comparisons and, especially in cross-racial cases like\nthis one, arbitrary comparisons tainted by racial bias against Hispanics.‖\n     Self further contends that victim impact evidence should be limited to\n(1) ―testimony from a single witness,‖ (2) testimony that ―describes the effect of the\nmurder on a family member who was present at the scene during or immediately after the\ncrime,‖ and (3) ―consequences that were known or reasonably apparent to the defendant\nat the time he committed the crime or were properly introduced to prove the charges at\nthe guilt phase of the trial.‖ We have previously rejected all of these contentions, and\nSelf cites no persuasive reason to revisit our conclusion. (See, e.g., People v. Trinh\n(2014) 59 Cal.4th 216, 245–246; Pollock, supra, 32 Cal.4th at p. 1183.)\n     Self further contends that the prosecutor committed misconduct by offering this\nevidence and then relying on it during closing argument. We have concluded this\nevidence was properly admitted. Hence the prosecutor did not commit misconduct by\nrelying on it during closing argument.\n                                             52\n\f               b. Evidence of assault on Tyreid Hodges, attempted escape, and shank\n                  possession\n     Defendant Romero contends that the trial court erroneously admitted evidence of his\nassault on Tyreid Hodges, attempted escape, and shank possession. (See ante, at pp. 8-9,\n12-13.) The evidence was properly admitted.\n\n                    (1) Hodges\n     Romero contends that ―[n]othing done to Hodges was a violent crime‖ within the\nmeaning of section 190.3, factor (b). Romero told Hodges that ―if he had his way about\nit . . . he would . . . take [Hodges] out.‖ Romero squirted urine from a bottle on Hodges,\nstepped on a carton of feces, splattering the contents on Hodges, and ―squished‖ a\nshampoo bottle containing urine, causing it to hit Hodges. He also threw a hairbrush at\nbut missed Hodges. These actions were assaults and batteries and hence admissible\nunder section 190.3, factor (b). (People v. Banks (2014) 59 Cal.4th 1113, 1197–1198\n[deputy‘s testimony about the ―defendant‘s assault upon him with a container filled with\nurine and feces was admissible‖]; People v. Burgener (2003) 29 Cal.4th 833, 868 [each\ninstance when the defendant ―threw water, urine, scouring powder, bleach, and other\nsubstances at correctional officers . . . constitute[d] a battery‖ and was admissible under\n§ 190.3, factor (b)]; People v. Pinholster (1992) 1 Cal.4th 865, 960-961 [―throwing a cup\nof urine in a person‘s face is a battery, since ‗[a]ny harmful or offensive touching\nconstitutes an unlawful use of force or violence‘ and thus a battery under section 243‖\nand is admissible under § 190.3].)\n\n                    (2) Attempted escape\n     Romero asserts that the jury was erroneously permitted to use evidence of his\nattempted escape in aggravation at the penalty phase because it was merely a planned and\nnot an attempted escape. (See Lancaster, supra, 41 Cal.4th at p. 94 [mere preparation for\nescape is insufficient under § 190.3].) Because we have previously concluded the\n\n\n\n                                             53\n\fevidence here demonstrated an attempted escape (see ante, pp. 40–41), this contention\nfails.\n         Romero further contends that the escape evidence did not demonstrate an express or\nimplied threat of force or violence under section 190.3, factor (b). He did not object on\nthis basis below, and the claim is therefore forfeited. It is also meritless. Although\nevidence of attempted escape alone is not admissible under section 190.3, factor (b), here\nthe evidence indicated Romero not only planned to escape by taking the nighttime deputy\nhostage and threatening him with a shank, he was also observed with a shank, and a\nweapon was found in his cell. That is sufficient. (Mason, supra, 52 Cal.3d at pp. 954–\n956 [escape evidence admissible under § 190.3, factor (b) when ―an escape from the\nadministrative segregation cell would almost certainly have involved defendant in a\nconfrontation with a guard‖].)\n         Romero further contends trial counsel was ineffective in failing to object to\nevidence of the escape attempt at the guilt phase on the ground the evidence ―had no\nlegitimate use‖ at the penalty phase. The evidence was admissible; therefore, he\nestablishes no deficiency on counsel‘s part in failing to object on this basis.\n         Romero also contends that instruction in the language of CALJIC Nos. 6.00, 6.01,\nand 6.02 ―fail[ed] to ensure that the jury understood that the purported escape attempt\ncould not be weighed as a circumstance in aggravation if it was only preparation.‖18 Not\n\n\n18     The court instructed the jury: ―An attempt to commit a crime consists of two\nelements, namely, a specific intent to commit the crime and a direct but ineffectual act\ndone towards its commission. In determining whether or not such an act was done, it is\nnecessary to distinguish between mere preparation, on the one hand, and the actual\ncommencement of the doing of the criminal deed, on the other. Mere preparation which\nmay . . . consist of planning the offense or of devising or obtaining or arranging the\nmeans for its commission, is not sufficient to constitute an attempt. However, acts of a\nperson who intends to commit a crime will constitute an attempt where those acts clearly\nindicate a certain, unambiguous intent to commit that specific crime. Such acts must be\nan immediate step in the present execution of the criminal design, the progress of which\nwould be completed unless interrupted by some circumstance not intended in the original\n                                                54\n\fso. The court instructed the jury mere preparation was ―not sufficient to constitute an\nattempt,‖ and further required the jury—in order to find Romero had committed\nattempted escape by force or violence—to find Romero‘s ―acts clearly indicate[d] a\ncertain, unambiguous intent to‖ escape and were ―an immediate step in the present\nexecution of the criminal design, the progress of which would be completed unless\ninterrupted by some circumstance not intended in the original design.‖ It is not clear\nwhether instruction in the language of CALJIC No. 6.00 is consistent with our recent\ndiscussion of attempted escape in Bailey, supra, 54 Cal.4th 740, but to the extent the\ncourt‘s instructions were too stringent, Romero could have only benefitted from the error.\n(See id. at p. 749 [stating attempted escape requires ―a specific intent to escape‖ and ― ‗a\ndirect, unequivocal act to effect that purpose‘ ‖]; and see id. at p. 750 [noting ― ‗[t]he\nintroduction into the concept of attempt to escape of a requirement of intentionally doing\nan act, the direct, natural and probable consequence of which, if successfully completed,\nwould be an escape, too narrowly limits the application of the [escape] statute‘ ‖].)\n\n                    (3) Shank\n     Romero contends the trial court erred in admitting evidence he possessed shanks in\njail. Romero did not challenge the admission of this evidence below, and the claim is\ntherefore forfeited. It is also meritless. ― ‗It is settled that a defendant‘s knowing\npossession of a potentially dangerous weapon in custody is admissible under [section\n190.3,] factor (b). Such conduct is unlawful and involves an implied threat of violence\n\n\n\n\ndesign. A person who has once committed acts which constitute an attempt to commit a\ncrime is liable for the crime of attempted escape by force or violence even though he does\nnot proceed further with the intent to commit the crime, either by reason of voluntarily\nabandoning his purpose or because he was prevented or interfered with in completing the\ncrime. If a person intends to commit a crime but, before committing an act toward the\nultimate commission of the crime, freely and voluntarily abandons the original intent and\nmakes no effort to accomplish it, such person has not attempted to commit the crime.‖\n                                              55\n\feven where there is no evidence defendant used or displayed it in a provocative or\nthreatening manner.‘ ‖ (People v. Smithey (1999) 20 Cal.4th 936, 1002.)\n\n                c. Exclusion of mitigating evidence\n     Romero contends the trial court erroneously excluded his mother Maria Self‘s\ntestimony that as a child she had been raped repeatedly by two of her brothers.\n     During Maria‘s direct testimony, she said her relationship with two of her brothers\nwas ―not good‖ because she ―was afraid of them.‖ When counsel asked why she was\nafraid, the prosecutor‘s relevance objection was sustained. At sidebar, counsel said he\nwas eliciting testimony Maria had been raped by her brothers for seven years starting\nwhen she was six years old. The court stated Maria‘s engaging in abusive behavior\ntoward her sons was relevant, but the reason why she was abusive was not relevant.\nAfter hearing further argument, the court ruled such testimony was not relevant ―at this\npoint in time‖ because it did not ―relate to factors in mitigation for the defendants.‖ Even\nif the evidence were relevant, the court found it ―highly prejudicial‖ because it would\nconfuse and mislead the jury, and therefore also excluded it under Evidence Code section\n352. The court further stated that if on cross-examination it appeared the prosecutor\nraised ―any issues that might open the door to her giving this testimony on redirect,‖ it\nwould reconsider its ruling. Counsel did not raise the issue after Maria‘s cross-\nexamination.\n     ― ‗The Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments require that the sentencer in a capital\ncase not be precluded from considering any relevant mitigating evidence, that is,\nevidence regarding ―any aspect of a defendant‘s character or record and any of the\ncircumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than\ndeath.‖ ‘ [Citation.] ‗Nonetheless, the trial court still ― ‗determines relevancy in the first\ninstance and retains discretion to exclude evidence whose probative value is substantially\noutweighed by the probability that its admission will create substantial danger of\n\n\n                                              56\n\fconfusing the issues or misleading the jury.‘ ‖ ‘ (People v. Williams (2006) 40 Cal.4th\n287, 320; see Romano v. Oklahoma (1994) 512 U.S. 1, 12 [‗The Eighth Amendment does\nnot establish a federal code of evidence to supersede state evidentiary rules in capital\nsentencing proceedings.‘]; Lockett v. Ohio (1978) 438 U.S. 586, 604, fn. 12 [‗Nothing in\nthis opinion limits the traditional authority of a court to exclude, as irrelevant, evidence\nnot bearing on the defendant‘s character, prior record, or the circumstances of his\noffense.‘].)‖ (People v. Farley (2009) 46 Cal.4th 1053, 1128.)\n     Here, evidence defendant Romero‘s mother had been raped as a child had no\nbearing on his character, record, or the circumstances of the offense. The court therefore\ndid not abuse its discretion in excluding this evidence.\n\n         3.   Asserted prosecutorial misconduct\n\n     Romero contends the prosecutor committed misconduct when he misled the court\nabout his intended use of Romero‘s statement to his girlfriend Stephanie Stinson, and\nthen used the statement to argue Romero‘s future dangerousness. There was no\nmisconduct.\n     As noted above, on June 12, 1994, Romero lured fellow Riverside jail inmate Olen\nThibedeau to his cell and then stabbed him in the stomach with a spear more than four\nfeet long. (See ante, p. 12.) Thibedeau was facing charges of child molestation and was\nlater convicted of these crimes. On February 8, 1995, Romero visited with Stephanie\nStinson and their conversation was recorded. Romero said: ―I don‘t like violence. I try\nto avoid it. But when they stick a child molester next door to me [and] expect me not to\ndo something, I‘ll be his friend, talk to him real nice, bring him close to the door, and\nthen make him a little spear about this long, about this skinny, that‘s real hard and won‘t\nbend. You put a pencil at the end of it and strips of wood. [¶] . . . [¶] Stick him in his\nneck.‖\n\n\n\n                                              57\n\f     At the hearing on whether to admit Romero‘s statement to Stinson, the prosecutor\nobserved that on cross-examination the defense had ―made quite an effort to impugn . . .\nThibedeau‘s credibility.‖ The prosecutor contended that Romero‘s later statement to\nStinson was an admission that ―he did[] exactly what . . . Thibedeau said.‖ The trial court\nadmitted the statement to rehabilitate Thibedeau.\n     During closing argument, the prosecutor said Romero ―has shown in jail since his\narrest that he is not done hurting people, that he still wants to kill and rob and terrorize\nand hurt.‖ He described Romero‘s attempted escape in which he planned to threaten a\nguard with a shank, his possession of shanks in jail, the robbery and beatings of Medeiros\nand Jutras, and the battery of Hodges with urine and feces. The prosecutor then said,\n―And he tried to run a spear through . . . Thibedeau.‖ After describing the incident, the\nprosecutor said: ―He is proud of it. Romero is proud of it. You heard him fondly\nremembering this event on tape.‖ He played the tape of Romero‘s statement to Stinson,\nand said: ―He is so proud. Mr. Romero gives you your verdict right there. You can‘t\nexpect him not to do something like this. He said it, ‗But when they stick a child\nmolester next door to me and not expect me to do something . . . .‘ He is telling you what\nto expect from him. You don‘t need a crystal ball to know what to expect from Mr.\nRomero in the future.‖ The prosecutor subsequently argued: ―Look at how he acted\nwhen he was free. He murdered people. When he had everything to lose, he murdered\npeople. Look at how he acted in the jail when he had this trial pending and he had\nsomething to lose. How is he going to act when he has nothing left to lose, when he has\ngot LWOP and they can‘t do anything else to him? It‘s an American Express card for\nviolence.‖ The prosecutor also noted that Romero would come into contact with ―nurses,\nclerks, guards, counselors, [and] other inmates,‖ and said: ―[W]hat we know about him is\nthat he likes to hurt people. The best predictor of the future is the past. He has 30, 40, 50\nyears of victims ahead of him if he has an LWOP, if he has life without parole.‖ The\n\n\n                                              58\n\fprosecutor also said, ―Consider 50 years of what you have seen of the last three years.\nDon‘t let the price of your compassion be another victim.‖\n      On appeal, Romero expressly does not challenge admission of his statement to\nStinson. Rather he contends that the prosecutor deceived the trial court by successfully\nseeking admission of the statement to rehabilitate Thibedeau‘s credibility and then using\nthe statement instead to improperly argue future dangerousness and urge the jury to\nconsider an aggravating factor not listed in section 190.3.\n      Romero cites no authority for the novel proposition a prosecutor commits\nmisconduct during closing argument by drawing a reasonable inference from properly\nadmitted evidence if he did not mention the inference at the time admissibility was\nsought. Rather, the crux of Romero‘s claim is that future dangerousness is an\naggravating factor not listed in section 190.3 and therefore improperly relied on by a\nprosecutor during argument. Romero correctly notes this court has never delineated why\nthere is no conflict between the circumstance that section 190.3 sets forth an exclusive\nlist of aggravating factors, not expressly including future dangerousness, and our line of\ncases holding ―[p]rosecutorial argument regarding a capital defendant‘s future\ndangerousness is permissible if . . . it is based on evidence of the defendant‘s conduct\nrather than expert opinion.‖ (People v. Thomas (2011) 52 Cal.4th 336, 364.) We now do\nso.\n      The circumstances of a defendant‘s crimes, his unadjudicated violent conduct, and\nhis violent conduct underlying a prior conviction, are aggravating factors under section\n190.3, factors (a), (b), and (c). (People v. Homick (2012) 55 Cal.4th 816, 889.) A\nprediction that a defendant will be dangerous in the future based on evidence admitted\nunder factors (a)–(c) is not itself a fact or an aggravating factor. It is an inference drawn\nfrom the aggravating evidence, and is properly argued by a prosecutor and considered by\nthe jury in making its penalty determination. (See People v. Ervine (2009) 47 Cal.4th\n745, 797 [if the jury interpreted the trial court instruction ―to mean that ‗no evidence was\n                                              59\n\fintroduced regarding the defendant‘s propensity to violence if in prison because the\ndefendant‘s propensity for violence in prison is irrelevant,‘ then it would have failed to\nconsider a relevant consideration in selecting the penalty‖].) As the high court has\nrecognized, ― ‗any sentencing authority must predict a convicted person‘s probable future\nconduct when it engages in the process of determining what punishment to impose.‘ ‖\n(California v. Ramos (1983) 463 U.S. 992, 1002.) And as the Attorney General observes,\nour cases stand ―for the unsurprising proposition that the prosecution may make\nreasonable inferences from properly admitted evidence to argue for imposition of the\ndeath penalty.‖19\n     ― ‗[W]e have held that at the penalty phase of a capital case the prosecutor may not\nintroduce expert testimony forecasting that, if sentenced to life without the possibility of\nparole, a defendant will commit violent acts in prison . . . .‘ ‖ (People v. Michaels (2002)\n28 Cal.4th 486, 540.) ―[T]here is a significant difference between an inference which a\njuror may or may not draw and a direct expression of expert opinion. The expert‘s\nauthority and experience may persuade the jurors to a conclusion they would not reach on\ntheir own.‖ (People v. Lucero (1988) 44 Cal.3d 1006, 1029.)\n     Accordingly, the prosecutor‘s argument here did not urge the jury to consider an\naggravating factor not listed in section 190.3. Rather, the prediction of future\ndangerousness was supported by the evidence, properly argued by the prosecutor, and\nproperly considered by the jury.\n\n\n\n19     In Lucas, supra, 60 Cal.4th at p. 321, we stated, ―The trial court properly refused\ndefendant‘s instruction that possible belief or predictions about a defendant‘s future\ndangerousness are not to be considered for any purpose because the standard jury\ninstructions do not permit ‗the jury to believe defendant‘s future dangerousness could be\nan aggravating factor.‘ ‖ An instruction such as that requested in Lucas would be\ninappropriate because the jury may consider a defendant‘s future dangerousness. To the\nextent Lucas could be read to mean a jury may not consider a defendant‘s future\ndangerousness, it is disapproved. (Lucas, supra, 60 Cal.4th 153.)\n                                             60\n\f       4.     Asserted instructional error\n\n               a. Victim impact\n     Defendants contend the trial court erroneously refused to give a limiting instruction\nregarding the victim impact evidence. We disagree.\n     Defendants requested the court instruct the jury: ―Evidence has been introduced for\nthe purpose of showing the specific harm caused by the defendant‘s crime. Such\nevidence, if believed, was not received and may not be considered by you to divert your\nattention from your proper role of deciding whether defendant should live or die. You\nmust face this obligation soberly and rationally, and you may not impose the ultimate\nsanction as a result of an irrational, purely subjective response to emotional evidence and\nargument. On the other hand, evidence and argument on emotional though relevant\nsubjects may provide legitimate reasons to sway the jury to show mercy.‖ The trial court\ndenied the request, finding the proposed instruction was argumentative, a misstatement of\nthe law, and duplicative. We have previously concluded that a substantially similar\ninstruction was ―argumentative‖ (Hartsch, supra, 49 Cal.4th at pp. 510–511) and\n―misleading to the extent it indicates that emotions may play no part in a juror‘s decision\nto opt for the death penalty‖ (Zamudio, supra, 43 Cal.4th at p. 368). ―We have also held\nthat the standard instructions given here, including CALJIC No. 8.85, adequately convey\nto the jury the proper consideration and use of victim impact evidence.‖20 (People v.\n\n\n\n20     As we have observed, ―CALJIC now includes a standard instruction explaining the\npermissible use of victim impact evidence consistent with our case law: ‗Victim impact\nevidence has been received in this trial for the purpose of showing, if it does, the\nfinancial, emotional, psychological or physical effects of the victim‘s death on the family\nand friends of the victim[s]. You may consider this evidence as part of the circumstances\nof the crime in determining penalty. Your consideration must be limited to a rational\ninquiry, and must not be simply an emotional response to this evidence. These witnesses\nare not permitted to offer any opinion as to what is the appropriate penalty in this case.‘\n(CALJIC No. 8.85.1 (Spring 2010 new) (Spring 2014 ed.) . . . .‖ (People v. Boyce (2014)\n59 Cal.4th 672, 689, fn. 11.)\n\n                                             61\n\fWilliams (2013) 56 Cal.4th 165, 197.) Defendants cite no persuasive reason to revisit\nthese conclusions.\n\n                b. Coperpetrator’s sentence\n     Romero contends the trial court erroneously refused to instruct the jury it could\nconsider Munoz‘s sentence as a mitigating factor. ―We have consistently held that\nevidence of an accomplice‘s sentence or of the leniency granted an accomplice is\nirrelevant at the penalty phase because ‗ ―it does not shed any light on the circumstances\nof the offense or the defendant‘s character, background, history or mental condition.‖ ‘\n[Citations.] Nothing in Parker v. Dugger (1991) 498 U.S. 308, relied on by defendant,\ncompels a different result.‖ (People v. Maciel (2013) 57 Cal.4th 482, 549.) Moreover,\nthe court permitted counsel to remind the jury of Munoz‘s sentence so long as he did not\n―compare it to what the defendants could possibly receive as a sentence in this case.‖\n\n                c. Reasonable doubt\n     Romero challenges the reasonable doubt instruction on the same grounds as in the\nguilt phase. (See ante, pp. 45–47.) We reject the claim for the same reasons stated\nabove.\n\n                d. Challenge to CALJIC No. 8.87\n     Romero contends instruction in the language of CALJIC No. 8.8721 was unfairly\none-sided, implied a unanimity requirement for mitigating evidence, and directed a\nverdict on whether the unadjudicated criminal conduct was violent. We have repeatedly\n\n21      The court instructed the Romero jury that evidence had been introduced to show\nRomero had committed ―assault, battery, robbery, attempted escape by force or violence,\nand possession of a deadly weapon in jail.‖ It then instructed the jury: ―Before a juror\nmay consider any of such criminal acts or activity as an aggravating circumstance in this\ncase, a juror must first be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant Romero\ndid in fact commit such criminal acts or activity. . . . It is not necessary for all jurors to\nagree. If any juror is convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that such criminal activity\noccurred, that juror may consider that activity as a fact in aggravation. If a juror is not so\nconvinced, that juror must not consider that evidence for any purpose.‖\n\n                                              62\n\frejected similar challenges, and do so again here. (People v. Moore (2011) 51 Cal.4th\n1104, 1139–1140 [instruction regarding lack of unanimity requirement for mitigating\nevidence not required, nor does the prosecution receive preferential treatment in the\nabsence of such an instruction]; People v. Nakahara (2003) 30 Cal.4th 705, 720\n[―CALJIC No. 8.87 is not invalid for failing to submit to the jury the issue whether the\ndefendant‘s acts involved the use, attempted use, or threat of force or violence‖].)\nMoreover, following the court‘s instructions to the Romero jury, Romero‘s counsel\nindicated only Self requested (and received) an instruction providing, ―There is no need\nfor the jurors to unanimously agree on the presence of a mitigating factor before\nconsidering it.‖\n\n                e. Challenge to CALJIC No. 8.88\n     Defendants challenge the court‘s instruction in the language of CALJIC No. 8.88 on\ngrounds we have repeatedly rejected. Contrary to their assertion, the language ―so\nsubstantial‖ and ―warrants‖ in that instruction is not impermissibly vague. (People v.\nDement (2011) 53 Cal.4th 1, 56 (Dement).) ―The instruction is not constitutionally\nflawed because it fails to inform the jury that if it determines the mitigating factors\noutweigh the aggravating factors, it is required to return a sentence of life imprisonment\nwithout the possibility of parole.‖ (Ibid.)\n\n       5.     Constitutionality of the death penalty statute\n     Defendants contend California‘s death penalty statute and implementing instructions\nare constitutionally invalid in numerous respects. We have repeatedly rejected similar\nclaims, and defendants provide no persuasive reason to revisit our decisions.\n     We ―reject the claim that section 190.3, factor (a), on its face or as interpreted and\napplied, permits arbitrary and capricious imposition of a sentence of death . . . .‖ (Dykes,\nsupra, 46 Cal.4th at p. 813; see Tuilaepa v. California (1994) 512 U.S. 967, 975–976,\n978.) ―[T]he death penalty statute is not unconstitutional because it does not require\n\n\n                                              63\n\f‗unanimity as to the truth of aggravating circumstances, or findings beyond a reasonable\ndoubt that an aggravating circumstance (other than § 190.3, factor (b) or (c) evidence) has\nbeen proved, that the aggravating factors outweighed the mitigating factors, or that death\nis the appropriate sentence.‘ [Citation.] Nothing in Cunningham v. California (2007)\n549 U.S. 270, Blakely v. Washington (2004) 542 U.S. 296, Ring v. Arizona (2002)\n536 U.S. 584, or Apprendi v. New Jersey (2000) 530 U.S. 466, affects our conclusions in\nthis regard. [Citations.] No burden of proof is constitutionally required, nor is the trial\ncourt required to instruct the jury that there is no burden of proof.‖ (Dement, supra,\n53 Cal.4th at p. 55.) The trial court need not instruct there is a presumption in favor of a\nsentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. (People v. Adams (2014)\n60 Cal.4th 541, 581.)\n     The trial court was not required to ―delete inapplicable factors from CALJIC\nNo. 8.85‖ (People v. Watson (2008) 43 Cal.4th 652, 701) or ―instruct that the jury can\nconsider certain statutory factors only in mitigation‖ (People v. Valencia (2008) 43\nCal.4th 268, 311). ―Written findings by the jury during the penalty phase are not\nconstitutionally required, and their absence does not deprive defendant of meaningful\nappellate review.‖ (People v. Mendoza (2011) 52 Cal.4th 1056, 1097.) The jury may\nproperly ―consider a defendant‘s unadjudicated criminal activity.‖ (People v. Martinez\n(2010) 47 Cal.4th 911, 968.) ―Use of the adjectives ‗extreme‘ and ‗substantial‘ in section\n190.3, factors (d) and (g) is constitutional.‖ (Dement, supra, 53 Cal.4th at p. 57.)\n     ― ‗The federal constitutional guarantees of due process and equal protection, and\nagainst cruel and unusual punishment [citations], do not require intercase proportionality\nreview on appeal.‘ [Citations.] Moreover, ‗capital and noncapital defendants are not\nsimilarly situated and therefore may be treated differently‘ [as to written jury findings,\nunanimity on aggravating factors, and the use of unadjudicated criminal activity] without\nviolating‘ a defendant‘s right to equal protection of the laws, due process of law, or\n\n\n                                             64\n\ffreedom from cruel and unusual punishment.‖ (People v. Carrasco (2014) 59 Cal.4th\n924, 971; see Capistrano, supra, 59 Cal.4th at p. 881.)\n     Defendants contend their death sentences violate international law and therefore\ntheir rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the federal Constitution.\nThey point to no authority ―prohibit[ing] a sentence of death rendered in accordance with\nstate and federal constitutional and statutory requirements.‖ (Hillhouse, supra, 27\nCal.4th at p. 511.)\n\n       6.       Cumulative prejudice\n     Defendants contend the cumulative effect of guilt and penalty phase errors requires\nus to reverse the judgments. We have found error only in Self‘s conviction for the\nrobbery of Albert Knoefler and the duplicative multiple-murder special-circumstance\nfindings for both defendants, and where we have assumed error regarding the admission\nof evidence of Feltenberger‘s attempted murder before Romero‘s jury and the escape\ninstructions given to Romero‘s jury we have concluded there was no prejudice. We\nfurther conclude this error and any assumed error are not prejudicial when considered\ncumulatively.\n\n\n\n\n                                            65\n\f                                     DISPOSITION\n\n     For the reasons set forth above, we reverse Self‘s conviction and sentence on count\nXV, the robbery of Albert Knoefler, vacate five multiple-murder special-circumstance\nfindings for each defendant, and otherwise affirm the judgments.\n                                                WERDEGAR, J.\n\n\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\nCANTIL-SAKAUYE, C.

Ct. No. CR46579\n ___________________________________ )\n\n\n        Defendants Orlando Gene Romero and Christopher Self were convicted of the first\ndegree murders of Joey Mans, Timothy Jones, and Jose Aragon, the willful, deliberate,\nand premeditated attempted murders of Kenneth Mills, Paulita Williams, and Randolph\nRankins, the attempted robbery of Kenneth Mills and Vicky Ewy, shooting at the vehicle\noccupied by Kenneth Mills and Ewy, the mayhem of Kenneth Mills, the second degree\nrobberies of William Meredith, Jerry Mills, Sr., Jerry Mills, Jr., and Albert Knoefler, the\nsecond degree burglary and vandalism of Magnolia Center Interiors, and receiving stolen\nproperty. (Pen. Code,1 §§ 187, subd. (a), 189, 205, 211, 459, 496, 594, subd. (b)(2),\n664.) The juries2 also found true robbery-murder special-circumstance allegations as to\nall three murders, two multiple-murder special-circumstance allegations for each murder,\nand arming enhancement allegations. (§§ 190.2, subd. (a)(3), (17)(i), 12022,\n\n\n1       All further undesignated statutory references are to this code.\n2       Defendants were tried jointly before separate juries.\n\n                                              1\n\fsubd. (a)(1).) Self was also convicted of the willful, deliberate, and premeditated\nattempted murder and second degree robbery of John Feltenberger and the kidnapping for\nrobbery and second degree robbery of Alfred Steenblock, and the jury found true great\nbodily injury enhancement allegations as to the crimes against Feltenberger and Kenneth\nMills and arming enhancement allegations. (§§ 187, subd. (a), 209, subd. (b), 211, 664,\n12022, subd. (a)(1), 12022.7.) Romero was also convicted of the kidnapping for robbery\nand second degree robbery of Robert Greer, the second degree robbery of Roger\nBeliveau, and receiving stolen property (Feltenberger‘s ammunition pouch), and the jury\nfound true arming enhancement allegations. (§§ 209, subd. (b), 211, 496, 12022, subd.\n(a)(1).) The juries returned death verdicts, and the trial court entered judgments of death.\nThis appeal is automatic. (Cal. Const., art. VI, § 11, subd. (a); § 1239, subd. (b).) For the\nreasons that follow we reverse Self‘s conviction and sentence for Knoefler‘s robbery,\nvacate five multiple-murder special-circumstance findings for each defendant, and\notherwise affirm the judgments.\n                                         I. FACTS\nA.     Guilt Phase\n       1.     Prosecution case\n     In 1992, defendants and brothers Romero and Self3 engaged in a two-month crime\nspree. They were joined at times by Jose Munoz, who pled guilty and testified against\ndefendants at trial,4 and Daniel Chavez, whose case was severed before trial. Defendants\nwere also implicated by their recorded statements to police, which were played for the\njury, and by witness identification and physical evidence.\n\n3      At some point Self changed his last name from Romero to that of their stepfather,\nPhillip Self.\n4        In exchange for Munoz‘s testimony and agreement to plead guilty to the first\ndegree murders of Aragon, Mans, and Jones, the attempted premeditated murder of\nFeltenberger, the robberies of Feltenberger, Knoefler, and Meredith, and the attempted\nrobbery of Kenneth Mills and Ewy, the prosecutor agreed to seek a sentence of 51 years\nto life in prison for Munoz, and request Munoz serve his sentence out of state.\n\n                                             2\n\f               a. Meredith robbery\n     On October 8, 1992, about 10:30 p.m., defendants and Munoz robbed William\nMeredith and stole his 1991 Nissan Pathfinder. They subsequently made a withdrawal\nand a charge on Meredith‘s Visa card.\n\n               b. Mans and Jones murders\n     In the early hours of October 12, 1992, defendants, Munoz, and Chavez noticed\nTimothy Jones and his best friend Joey Mans in a car at a hilltop area near Lake\nMathews. Romero and Munoz ordered the men out of the car at gunpoint. Romero told\nMans to relax and everything would be all right, and had Mans lie down on the ground\nnext to Jones. Romero told Chavez to ―[s]hoot,‖ adding, ―[s]omething like this.‖\nRomero shot Mans in the back, killing him. He attempted to shoot Jones, but the gun\nmalfunctioned. Jones got up and ran down the hill, and defendants ran after him. Self\nbeat Jones with his fists and a pipe and shot him four times, killing him. Defendants stole\nthe victims‘ car keys and a box containing boots, shoes, magazines, and toiletries.\n\n               c. Kenneth Mills and Ewy assault\n     On October 22, 1992, between 11:30 p.m. and midnight, Kenneth Mills and his\ngirlfriend Vicky Ewy took a drive to look at the lightning. Defendants and Munoz pulled\nup beside them and Self shot Mills, who was driving, in the face. Defendants continued\nto chase them until Mills turned onto a golf cart path. Mills permanently lost vision in his\nright eye.\n\n               d. Williams and Rankins attempted murders\n     In the early morning hours of October 26, 1992, Randolph Rankins was\nunsuccessful in purchasing methamphetamine for defendants and Munoz. Romero said\nhe would ―be seeing‖ Rankins later; defendants and Munoz then left. Romero told Self\nand Munoz that if Rankins did not refund their money, they should ―take him out,‖ and\nSelf agreed. About an hour later, Rankins was with acquaintance Paulita Williams in her\ncar at the intersection of Alexander Street and Myron Street in Riverside County.\n                                             3\n\fWilliams was trying to back up to make a turn she had missed. Defendants‘ car appeared\nand blocked Williams‘s car, and Munoz and Self got out. As Munoz began shooting,\nRankins escaped from the car. The bullets struck Williams in her left side and shattered\nthe driver and passenger windows. Self, who appeared to be smiling, began stabbing\nWilliams in the arm. Munoz pushed Self away and shot Williams. Williams suffered a\npunctured lung and three cuts on her hand and arm, including a nine-inch-long gash on\nher arm that required about 80 stitches. One of the bullets left a deep gash on her back\nabout six inches long and an inch and a half wide, and pellets were embedded in her\nspine, shoulder bone, and muscle. Williams still felt the pellets constantly and could not\nbear weight on her shoulders.\n\n               e. Magnolia Center Interiors burglary and vandalism\n     On the night of November 13, 1992, defendants broke into Magnolia Center\nInteriors in Riverside. File drawers were emptied, fire extinguishers were sprayed on\nfabric samples, and glue was sprayed into computers, telephones, fax machines, and\ncalculators. Words similar to ―You‘re going to die‖ were written on a sonogram picture\nof the shop owner‘s unborn son and the picture was stabbed with a sharp object. The\nwords ―Just when you thought‖ and the number ―666‖ were written on the wall and the\nwords ―Now you die‖ were written in the bathroom. The store safe was closed but its\ncombination lock was missing and its hinges had been tampered with. A pair of bolt\ncutters was found by the safe and several screwdrivers and chisels had been ―beaten flat,‖\nas though ―somebody was pounding‖ on the hinges ―trying to pull the hinge pins out.‖ A\nset of unlabeled master keys to offices around the city and a set of keys to the shop van\nwere taken, along with personal objects.\n\n               f.   Steenblock kidnapping and robbery\n     On November 18, 1992, about 1:15 p.m., Alfred Steenblock was eating lunch in his\n1992 Pontiac Grand Prix parked at the Mission Grove Plaza shopping center in Riverside.\n\n\n                                             4\n\fSelf approached Steenblock, pointed a gun at his face, and told him to move over. Self\ndrove Steenblock to an empty field. Another car followed and parked behind them, and\ntwo men, including Chavez, got out. Self demanded Steenblock‘s wallet, took out his\nautomated teller machine (ATM) card, and asked for his personal identification number\n(PIN). He also took about $80 in cash and Steenblock‘s watch. The men instructed\nSteenblock to get out of the car, walk into the field, and stay there for an hour, and then\nleft, taking Steenblock‘s car. Steenblock‘s partially stripped car was later recovered in a\nrural area of Mead Valley.\n\n               g. Knoefler robbery\n     On November 20, 1992, about 3:30 p.m., Albert Knoefler was tending beehives at\nMarkham Street and Washington Street in Riverside County. Parked nearby was his\n1987 pickup truck. Romero approached Knoefler, struck up a conversation about the\nbees, and walked around the bee yard. Romero then brandished what appeared to be a\nsawed-off shotgun and demanded the keys to Knoefler‘s truck. Munoz appeared wearing\na ski mask. Romero said he needed money for gas, and Knoefler handed him about $50.\nThe men left in the truck. The truck was stripped and found several weeks later.\n\n               h. Robbery of Jerry Mills, Sr., and Jerry Mills, Jr.\n     On November 21, 1992, about 12:45 p.m., Jerry Mills, Sr., and his 15-year-old son,\nJerry Mills, Jr., were engaged in target practice shooting about two miles south of the\nPerris Airport in Riverside County. A gray hatchback pulled up and Self pointed a\nshotgun at Mills. Defendants and Chavez got out of the hatchback and took from Mills\nhis pickup truck, along with a Colt Gold Cup .45-caliber semiautomatic pistol, a Ruger\n.22-caliber semiautomatic pistol, a Ruger .22-caliber convertible Western-style single\naction revolver, a Ruger 10/22 semiautomatic rifle with a dark mahogany stock and a\nscope, a ―banana clip‖ or curved 25-round magazine, a 10-round magazine for the rifle,\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\fan ammunition box, toolbox, and about $150. Mills‘s abandoned truck was found a half-\nhour later.\n\n                i.   Aragon murder\n     On November 25, 1992, 22-year-old Jose Aragon was practicing motorcycle stunts\nin San Timoteo Canyon in Riverside County. Defendants and Munoz engaged Aragon in\nfriendly conversation and, after Aragon showed them some stunts, Self shot him.\nRomero picked Aragon up and asked: ―How does it feel to get shot? Does it burn?‖\nRomero placed Aragon in the bed of his (Aragon‘s) pickup truck. Munoz asked him for\nhis keys and wallet, and Self told Aragon to tell him his ATM access code or he would\nkill him. After Aragon gave Self the code, Self put his gun to Aragon‘s ribs and fired\nrepeatedly. Aragon was shot 11 times; all wounds were inflicted before and contributed\nto his death.\n     Defendants and Munoz stole Aragon‘s wallet, toolbox, and Craftsman socket set.\nAs they drove off, Self laughed and said, ―Oh, wow, you should have seen the hole it\nmade.‖ Self made a circle with his fingers about two and a half inches in diameter.\nDefendants and Munoz withdrew $300 from Aragon‘s bank account at two different\nATM‘s and ate lunch at Coco‘s restaurant.\n     Aragon‘s body was discovered later that afternoon by a 10-year-old boy. Two red\nplastic fragments consistent with a 20-gauge sabot shotgun round manufactured by BRI\nwere found in his body. Jose Munoz was videotaped making one of the ATM\nwithdrawals, later arrested, and gave a statement to police that led to defendants‘ arrest.\n\n                j.   Feltenberger attempted murder and robbery\n     On November 30, 1992, about 4:00 a.m., off-duty Ontario Police Sergeant John\nFeltenberger was driving his 1991 red Geo Metro coupe in Moreno Valley near his home.\nHe was not armed or in uniform. A white car appeared and drove parallel to\nFeltenberger, matching his speed each time he slowed down or accelerated. Feltenberger\n\n\n                                              6\n\fthought it might be his newspaper carrier, and pulled to the side of the road; the white car\nstopped beside him. Self got out of the passenger side of the white car carrying a silver\nor chrome sawed-off shotgun. He opened the driver‘s door and demanded Feltenberger\nget out of the car and give Self his wallet. The wallet was in Feltenberger‘s back pocket,\nbut he said it was in the back of his car. The men switched positions so Feltenberger was\noutside facing the car. Feltenberger ignored Self‘s demands for the wallet and, with his\nhands raised, started to back away from Self. When Feltenberger was about 10 feet\naway, he heard a voice from the white car in which Munoz was sitting say, ―Kill him.‖\nFeltenberger said, ―Nobody has to get hurt,‖ and threw the wallet to Self. The voice\ninside the car again said, ―Kill him.‖ Self said, ―I ought to shoot you,‖ and shot\nFeltenberger in the chest. Feltenberger collapsed and Self drove off in the Geo Metro.\nFeltenberger was bleeding and his lung had collapsed, but he managed to reach a\nneighbor‘s house and obtain aid. At the hospital Riverside County Sheriff‘s Deputy\nDavid Green saw medical personnel remove a small piece of red plastic measuring about\ntwo inches by one inch from Feltenberger‘s right arm. In his ―thousands‖ of times firing\na shotgun, Green had never seen a similar object in a round. A different deputy sheriff\nsaw a red plastic object under Feltenberger‘s shirt in his chest area. Feltenberger was in\nintensive care for three days and hospitalized for about 10 days.\n     Both the red material observed by the deputies and the red sabot material found in\nAragon‘s body were identified at trial as consistent with a BRI 20-gauge sabot shotgun\nround. The pathologist who performed Aragon‘s autopsy testified that injuries from\nsabot rounds are uncommon.\n     In his statement to police, Self admitted shooting Feltenberger with a 20-gauge\nsawed-off shotgun and taking his car. Feltenberger testified that when his car was\nreturned to him in January 1993, it was missing his flashlight, ammunition pouch, and\naxe. In Romero‘s statement to police he admitted that the ―pouch‖ he had had come from\nthe Feltenberger incident. Munoz testified he and Self found the ammunition pouch in\n                                             7\n\fFeltenberger‘s car, and that Romero later ―took it‖ because it fit the magazines for his\n.45-caliber weapon.\n\n               k. Greer kidnapping and robbery\n     On December 5, 1992, about 8:00 p.m., Robert Greer withdrew cash from an ATM\nat the corner of Alessandro Boulevard and Trautwein Road in Riverside. As he returned\nto his 1992 Honda Accord EX, Romero, wearing a ski mask, brandished a gun and told\nGreer to throw him his car keys. Romero ordered Greer to sit on the passenger side of\nthe car. As Romero drove, he kept the gun pointed at Greer. The gun was a dull gray or\nsilver and appeared to be a semiautomatic, ―like a .45‖ caliber. They drove about nine\nmiles to a remote area in Mead Valley. Romero took Greer‘s car, about $40, and Greer‘s\ndriver‘s license and ATM card. He asked for Greer‘s PIN number, and $800 was later\nwithdrawn from Greer‘s bank account. Greer walked about two miles to a house where\nhe contacted police.\n\n               l.   Beliveau robbery\n     On December 7, 1992, about 12:45 a.m., Roger Beliveau was in an unlit restroom at\nHunt Park in Riverside. Romero approached him and Beliveau heard the sound of a\nround being chambered in a semiautomatic pistol. Romero told Beliveau to give him his\ncar keys and he would not get hurt. He then told Beliveau to wait in the restroom for five\nminutes and drove off in Beliveau‘s maroon 1978 Ford LTD. Romero stopped at the end\nof the parking lot, where another man threw trash bags into the back of the car; the two\nmen then left. Police later found Beliveau‘s ransacked car in a shopping center at\nAlessandro Boulevard and Trautwein Road in Riverside.\n\n               m. Romero’s escape attempt\n     In April 1994 Arthur Dicken was housed in a Riverside jail cell next to a cell\nhousing Romero and Michael Aragon (who was no relation to murder victim Jose\nAragon). During the nighttime between April 1 and April 14, 1994, Dicken observed\n\n                                             8\n\fRomero and Aragon cutting the two bottom bars of their cell door with a hacksaw blade.\nRomero told Dicken he was planning to escape by taking the nighttime deputy hostage,\nthreatening him with a shank, and leaving the jail. Dicken observed Romero with a four-\nto six-inch-long sharpened metal piece or shank and Aragon with a makeshift spear.\nRomero and Aragon hid the damage to the bars by taping and painting them. Jail\npersonnel learned of the planned escape and Romero and Aragon were moved to a\ndifferent cell. Inspection of the two bars revealed they were completely cut through and\ncould be removed by hand to create a space large enough for an inmate to leave the cell.\nA weapon was found in the cell.\n\n               n. Self’s escape attempt\n     On December 16, 1994, about 1:00 a.m., Riverside County Deputy Sheriff Scott\nCollins noticed a car parked near the jail in a lot reserved for authorized vehicles. The\nwindow for the ground floor cell in which Self was incarcerated was visible from the\ncar‘s location. When the driver, Romero‘s girlfriend, Sonia Alvarez, was asked what she\nwas doing there she gave several different explanations and was arrested. Sheriff‘s\ndeputies inspected Self‘s cell and found gouges in and around the rear window and\nconcrete chips on his bed below. A welded bracket from a cage around Self‘s television\nset had been removed and was found under the television. Self had an inch-long cut on\none finger and redness on both hands.\n\n       2.     Defense case\n     Defendants rested without presenting evidence.\n\n\n\n\n                                             9\n\fB.     Penalty Phase\n       1.     Prosecution case\n               a. Victim impact evidence5\n                    (1) Jose Aragon\n     Lydia Roybal-Aragon, Jose Aragon‘s stepmother, married Jose‘s father when Jose\nwas about 13. The family lived in Albuquerque, New Mexico. In 1985, they moved to\nRedlands, California.\n     Lydia described Jose as a ―kind,‖ ―gentle soul‖ who ―never hurt anybody.‖ At the\ntime of his death, Jose was a 22-year-old senior engineering student at California State\nPolytechnic University. He was a dedicated student and studied constantly. Jose‘s\nfavorite activity was motorcycle riding, and he had received numerous competition\ntrophies. Jose was close to his siblings.\n     Lydia described how the family learned of Jose‘s murder and its effect on them.\nAfter Jose‘s death, his father and brothers Steven and Carlos isolated themselves and\nrarely interacted with the family. His father lost interest in his job, about which he had\npreviously been passionate, and Steven suffered from insomnia. Jose‘s younger sister\nLaura started to misbehave and had difficulty completing her schoolwork.\n     Leighette Hopkins, Jose‘s friend since high school, described Jose as a calm and\nfriendly person who made people laugh. He was a bright and hard-working student who\ntook time to help Leighette study for a chemistry test the night before he died.\n     Stephanie Aragon, Jose‘s younger sister, testified that when their parents divorced\nJose and Steven moved to California with their father. Stephanie, who was then seven\nyears old, stayed in New Mexico with her mother. Stephanie saw Jose about four times a\nyear. Jose was quiet and shy and protected her.\n\n\n\n5      Because some witnesses and victims shared surnames, for clarity we refer to the\nvictims and witnesses by their first names in this portion of the opinion.\n\n                                             10\n\f                    (2) Joey Mans\n     Catherine Mans, Joey Mans‘s mother, testified he was her only son and had five\nsisters. He was 26 years old when he died. Joey was generous, polite, smart, and\nprotective of his family. He was mechanically inclined and could fix anything.\nCatherine did not attend Joey‘s funeral because she did not ―want to see [her] son in a\nbox,‖ and had never visited his grave. She ―almost died [her]self,‖ felt angry all the time,\nquit her job, and had been prescribed tranquilizers.\n     Angela Mans, younger than Joey by six years, testified her brother was kind and\ngullible. He loved to draw and play guitar and work on cars. When Angela saw Joey in\nhis casket, he ―looked so scared,‖ so she knew he was afraid when he died. Because of\nfear she would be similarly attacked, for two months she did not leave her home except to\ngo to work, and four years later at the time of her testimony she still did not go out at\nnight. Their father had not celebrated Christmas in three years because the family was\nnot ―complete.‖ Every year on Joey‘s birthday, Angela and other family members\nbrought to his grave and released a number of balloons corresponding to what his age\nwould have been.\n                    (3) Timothy Jones\n     James Jones, Timothy Jones‘s father, testified that Timmy had a brother, a sister,\nand two stepbrothers. He was 22 years old when he died. Timmy was the ―[m]ost\nwonderful kid in the world,‖ who was kind and generous and ―would do anything for\nyou‖ and ―didn‘t hate anyone.‖ James could not understand ―how they could take his\nlife.‖ James had visited Timmy the night before he died. ―[L]ike always,‖ Timmy told\nJames, ―I love you, Pop,‖ and hugged him goodbye. James next saw Timmy in the\nfuneral parlor and wished he could have died instead of him.\n     Timmy‘s parents divorced when Timmy was about seven years old and the children\nlived with their father. Shortly after Timmy‘s death, his mother had a stroke and died\nabout two years later.\n\n\n                                             11\n\f                b. Unadjudicated criminal activity\n                     (1) Romero\n     On September 22, 1993, Rodney Medeiros, who was incarcerated with Romero,\nreceived food from the commissary. Romero and other inmates demanded Medeiros give\nthem his food and beat him when he refused. He was treated for a week in the medical\nward.\n     On October 6, 1993, about 9:20 p.m., inmate Walter Jutras was sleeping in his cell.\nHe awoke when Romero put his knee on the back of his neck. Romero and another\ninmate repeatedly struck him.\n     On October 27, 1993, Riverside County Sheriff‘s Deputy George Munoz removed\nRomero from his jail cell and told him to empty his pockets. Romero removed a\nsharpened toothbrush that could be used as a weapon. In a box of his belongings Munoz\nfound a broken hairbrush handle that appeared to have been sharpened.\n     On September 3, 1994, and October 29, 1994, shanks were found in Romero‘s one-\nman cell.\n     On June 12, 1994, Romero lured fellow Riverside jail inmate Olen Thibedeau to his\ncell and stabbed him in the stomach with a spear more than four feet long. Thibedeau\nwas facing charges of child molestation and was later convicted of those crimes.\n     On February 8, 1995, Romero visited with Stephanie Stinson, the mother of his son,\nand their conversation was recorded and a portion played for the jury. Romero said: ―I\ndon‘t like violence. I try to avoid it. But when they stick a child molester next door to\nme [and] expect me not to do something, I‘ll be his friend, talk to him real nice, bring\nhim close to the door, and then make him a little spear about this long, about this skinny,\nthat‘s real hard and won‘t bend. You put a pencil at the end of it and strips of wood.\n[¶] . . . [¶] Stick him in his neck.‖\n     Between October 1994 and March 1995, Romero squirted urine from a bottle on\ninmate Tyreid Hodges, who had been charged with child molestation, stepped on a carton\n\n                                             12\n\fof feces splattering them on Hodges, and ―squished‖ a shampoo bottle containing urine,\ncausing it to hit Hodges. He also threw a hairbrush at Hodges.\n\n                    (2) Self\n       Milton Solorzano attended high school with Self. On May 22, 1992, while\nSolorzano was standing in the lunch line, Self charged toward him. Solorzano moved out\nof the way and Self hit his head on the wall. Solorzano grabbed Self and held him in a\nheadlock for about two minutes until a teacher came. Self repeatedly tried to hit\nSolorzano with his fist and said: ―I‘m going to get you. Let me go.‖\n       On June 24, 1993, Self and another inmate approached inmate Oswaldo Vazquez\nand asked him to massage their backs. Vazquez refused. Self threatened Vazquez with a\npencil and said he would stab Vazquez in the neck if he did not give Self a massage.\nVazquez massaged Self‘s back. Self then told Vazquez to suck his penis. Vazquez\ndeclined, and Self and another inmate beat him while a third inmate stood guard.\nVazquez had a scar near his eye as a result of the attack.\n       On September 19, 1993, a shank was found in Self‘s box of personal belongings.\nOn November 25, 1994, three shanks were found in Self‘s one-man cell.\n       On May 30, 1994, Self punched inmate Mario Garcia Pescador in the mouth and left\neye. One or two other inmates joined Self. The victim received six stitches above his\neye.\n       On June 5, 1994, about 1:00 a.m., Riverside County Sheriff‘s Deputy Manuel\nCorrea responded to inmate Jacob Aramburo‘s screams for help. Aramburo was sobbing\non the floor of his cell in a fetal position. He had a cut on the back of his head, scrapes\non his back and chest, and pain in his left shoulder and lower back, and the right side of\nhis face was swollen. Aramburo shared the cell with other inmates including Self. Self‘s\nknuckles were red and he had a fresh cut on one knuckle.\n\n\n\n\n                                             13\n\f     On July 22, 1994, Riverside County Sheriff‘s Deputy Alfonso Campa responded to\ncalls for help from inmate Richard Reyes. Reyes was missing several teeth and bleeding\nfrom his lip and gum, had red marks on his face, and looked scared. Campa examined\nthe other inmates in Reyes‘s cell. Self was bleeding from a puncture wound on one of his\nknuckles and his other knuckles were red. None of the other inmates had marks on their\nhands. On July 24, 1994, Self told his mother in a recorded conversation that was played\nfor the jury that he had ―busted out‖ an inmate‘s ―two teeth.‖\n\n       2.     Defense case\n\n               a. Both defendants\n     Maria Self, defendants‘ mother, testified that defendants‘ biological father was\nOrlando Romero, and she was married to their stepfather, Phillip Self. Maria was 17 in\n1968 when she married 22-year-old Orlando. They were married for six years and had\nfour sons; she was pregnant with Self when she filed for divorce.\n     Maria never smoked, drank alcohol, or used drugs when she was pregnant with\ndefendants. Orlando never worked. He was physically abusive to Maria, and once put a\ngun to her face and said he should kill her. On another occasion he threatened the entire\nfamily by filling the house with thick smoke and refusing to let them leave. Both\nOrlando and Maria had frequent affairs. At one point Maria called 911 and told the\ndispatcher she was ―going to kill them all because [she] couldn‘t handle them.‖ On\ncross-examination she said that although she spoke to the dispatcher for over two\nminutes, and cried hysterically that she was going to kill all of her children, no police\nofficer ever came to her house to investigate.\n     After Maria left Orlando, she and her sons moved to Modesto for about four years.\nMaria did not work, and she abused alcohol and drugs, including methamphetamine, in\nfront of the children. She was also physically and verbally abusive to the boys, and never\nhugged them or told them she loved them. When Self was about two years old, she\n\n\n                                             14\n\fslashed his face and the children were removed from her custody. About a year later, the\nchildren were returned to her. On cross-examination, Maria said she had struck Self with\na broken fly swatter, he had one cut, and she did not seek medical attention for him.\nMaria agreed with the prosecutor that she had been distraught and told a counselor at the\ndepartment of mental health she was ―in a bad way‖ and ―needed somebody to help [her]\nwith the children.‖ The following day her children were placed with relatives.\n     At some point the family left Modesto and moved to Turlock for about a year.\nMaria continued to drink and she also used methamphetamine and LSD. The family then\nmoved to Stockton, where they lived with a heroin addict and dealer. Romero was in\nschool, but she never visited the school or asked about his homework. Romero closely\nresembled his biological father, and Maria frequently reminded him of this circumstance\nand said that she hated his father.\n     The family then returned to Riverside. Maria continued to use drugs and did not\nmonitor the children‘s school work. Between the time Maria married Orlando and when\nshe married Phillip Self, she had been in about 10 relationships. After her divorce from\nOrlando the family moved frequently, living in 10 or 11 different places.\n     On cross-examination Maria agreed with the prosecutor that shortly after returning\nto Riverside she met and moved in with her current husband, Phillip Self. Romero was\nabout eight years old and Self about five years old. Phillip was very good to the boys.\nHe took them fishing, showed them how to change a tire, and treated them as his own\nchildren. Maria agreed with the prosecutor that Phillip was ―the best thing that ever\nhappened to [her],‖ and said that when she would try to abuse alcohol or drugs, ―he\nwouldn‘t let [her].‖ Maria and Phillip had two girls together, and Maria had tried to be a\ngood parent to them.\n     When Romero was 14, he asked to live with his father. Maria allowed him to go,\nbut believed her ―baby [was] gone . . . into somebody‘s hands who really doesn‘t care\nabout him.‖ When Romero became involved with drugs, Maria told him she would help\n                                            15\n\fhim in any way she could to get off drugs. She tried to arrange for him to go to the\ntreatment program Teen Challenge, but there was a long waiting list.\n     When Self was about 14 or 15 years old he lived with Maria‘s niece for about four\nmonths and then came home; at some point he also lived with his father. Self began\nusing drugs and alcohol. Maria sent him to a Chino drug rehabilitation center for two\nweeks. Afterward, Self did ―much better.‖ He was home-schooled and received good\ngrades. Self relapsed, however. Maria had two small girls in the house and did not want\nthem to see their brothers abusing these substances, so she told Self he had to leave and\nsent him to live with her friend Charlene. Self later lived with Maria‘s mother. Maria\ntestified that Self ―does beautiful artwork.‖\n     Maria loved defendants. Since their arrest three and a half years earlier, Maria had\nspent much of her time crying and praying.\n     Anthony Self, defendants‘ older brother, testified he had enlisted in the Army at the\nage of 18 and reenlisted for another four years when he was 22 years old. He was a\ncombat engineer and paratrooper in the 27th Engineer Battalion at Fort Bragg, cleared\nmine fields during Desert Storm, and supervised other soldiers.\n     When Anthony was about eight years old, he and his family lived with Bobby\nGuzman. Guzman once disciplined Self by making him stand in a corner for two hours\nwith soiled underwear on his head. At some point Maria married Phillip Self, whom the\nboys liked, and whom Anthony considered his father.\n     Anthony and his brothers would frequently send Self to fight the next-door neighbor\nto ―see what he could take.‖ Anthony experimented with drugs in high school and once\ngave Self heroin when he was in elementary school. Maria and Phillip were unaware of\nhis drug use. On cross-examination Anthony agreed he had never mentioned giving Self\nheroin to any of the investigators he had spoken to before trial. Maria told the boys to\navoid drugs and both she and Phillip would have been very upset if they had learned\nAnthony had been drinking alcohol in high school.\n                                                16\n\f     When the boys upset Maria she would ―lash out at us with whatever she had in her\nhand,‖ such as a fly swatter or broom. She once threw a knife at Anthony, hitting him\nwith the handle. On cross-examination Anthony testified it was important to Maria that\nthe boys did well in school and she wanted them to attend school and complete their\nhomework.\n     Anthony used the last name Self because his biological father was ―really never any\npart of our lives‖ and did not provide any financial support. He said, ―We lived pretty\nmuch in poverty with my mother raising us.‖ When Phillip Self joined the family he was\nvery good to the boys, taking them fishing and supporting them and showing Anthony\nhow to work on cars.\n\n               b. Romero\n     Carmen Burrola, Maria Self‘s sister and Romero‘s aunt, testified that when Romero\nwas in about the second grade, he and his brother Anthony stayed with her and her\nhusband and daughters for about two years because Maria had a ―nervous breakdown.‖\nRomero was kind and polite. Burrola and her husband took the boys to Disneyland and\nother amusement parks and to the mountains. Burrola gave the boys chores to do, tried to\nteach them right from wrong, and gave them advice on how to navigate life‘s problems.\n     Burrola had never seen Maria abuse the boys. Burrola knew Orlando, Romero‘s\nbiological father, and characterized home life with him and Maria as ―[a]wful.‖ She\nrecalled Orlando ―drunk, . . . just lying there, not doing nothing.‖ Phillip Self was a good\nman who was ― [v]ery patient‖ with the boys and very good to Maria. Burrola was very\nsad and surprised when she heard Romero was charged with murder because he ―was\nalways a good boy‖ and ―very respectful.‖\n     Mona Suzette Quezada, Romero‘s cousin, had worked for the Riverside Transit\nAgency for eight years. She was 10 years older than Romero and grew up with him. She\ndescribed him as a quiet child. Their grandparents lived in the area on a small farm. At\n\n\n                                            17\n\ftimes when she was 10 to 12 years old, she and her grandparents would pick up Romero\nand his siblings either because they were not being taken care of or because Maria was\nupset with Romero‘s father. On those occasions Romero and his siblings often did not\nhave ―decent food to eat,‖ and sometimes were without electricity. Her grandmother was\nvery good to Romero and his siblings when they were at her house. Quezada was very\nsurprised when she heard Romero was charged with murder because it ―was totally out of\ncharacter.‖\n     Margaret Lopez, Romero‘s aunt and godmother, took care of Romero for two\nmonths when he was about a year and a half old. She did not have a lot of contact with\nRomero when he was a child. When he was a teenager Romero visited her whenever he\ncould and was respectful. She was shocked when she heard he was charged with murder\nbecause he was a ―good kid‖ and ―wouldn‘t do what they are saying.‖\n     Corinna Leon, Romero‘s cousin, took care of him frequently when he was young.\nAs a teenager Romero was quiet and kind and interacted well with her children. At some\npoint as a teenager he had a girlfriend and a baby of his own and Corinna saw him less\nfrequently. When Romero‘s mother Maria returned from ―up north,‖ she was not ―taking\ncare of the boys,‖ although Corinna could not recall any particular incident when they\nwere not fed or clothed.\n     Catherine Mejia, Romero‘s cousin, lived with Romero for about three months in\n1990. Romero was quiet, happy, and nice.\n     Christine Arrabito testified that she had attended school with Romero from\nelementary through high school. After high school Romero lived with Arrabito and her\nfamily in Perris for about a month. Later that same year he lived with her and her family\nin Pacifica for about five months, saying he ―really wanted to . . . change‖ and wanted a\n―fresh start.‖ Although he held various jobs, he did not pay his share of the rent or phone\nbill and was asked to leave. On cross-examination Arrabito did not recall telling an\ninvestigator that Romero said he and his friends would beat up people who ―piss[ed] him\n                                            18\n\foff.‖ She relayed Romero‘s description in high school of watching the drivers of\nexpensive cars for a long period of time before stealing their cars. She believed her\nfamily had given Romero a chance in Pacifica and he had misused it and taken advantage\nof them. After that she did not want anything to do with him.\n     Janice Babish, Arrabito‘s mother, testified that Romero came to live with them in\nPacifica because he ―felt like he needed to turn his life around‖ and thought it would help\nto leave the Riverside area. On cross-examination Babish said Romero would claim to be\nstill working at a job after he had been fired so Babish would think he was still earning\nmoney. When he left their home he said he would pay the family back for his phone bill\nbut never did.\n     Sheila Torres, Romero‘s cousin and a California deputy labor commissioner, was\ntwo years older than Romero‘s mother. Once when she and her grandparents took\ngroceries over to Romero‘s house, his father Orlando was passed out in the house. Her\ncousins were toddlers and were outside playing in a field.\n     Torres said at one point Romero‘s mother Maria Self came to live with her while\nRomero lived with another family. For about a year Maria occasionally dated a heroin\ndealer, Henry Alvarado. Torres was upset and spoke to Maria because Alvarado ―had no\nredeeming qualities.‖ Torres also witnessed Maria throw objects at her sons. She\ncommented, ―it seemed like [Maria] was either riding them for something or not paying\nany attention to them at all.‖ Maria ―was always comparing [Romero] to his father‖ and\n―telling him that he wouldn‘t amount to anything.‖\n     Torres also said she had a brother who committed suicide, a niece who was beaten\nto death, and a great-uncle, whom neither she nor defendants had met, who was convicted\nof murder.\n\n\n\n\n                                            19\n\f               c. Self\n     Sheriff‘s Deputy John Bianco worked at the Robert Presley Detention Center, where\nSelf was housed in a cell by himself. For two hours a day he could leave the cell and use\nart supplies. The jury was shown several pieces of Self‘s artwork.\n     Margaret Louie, Self‘s high school art teacher, testified that Self had voluntarily\nparticipated in creating a mural to honor an art teacher who had died, and had drawn a\ncover for a school literary magazine. She described Self as ―[v]ery talented, very\nmotivated,‖ and someone who always volunteered.\n\n       3.     Rebuttal\n\n               a. Both defendants\n     Robin Levinson, a defense private investigator, conducted a taped interview of\nMaria Self on June 8, 1993, and had a transcript prepared. When Maria was asked if she\nused drugs around her children, she said she had never used drugs or been drunk in front\nof them but rather always tried to shield them.\n     Levinson had also interviewed Christine Arrabito.

Romero\n     Maria Self, defendants‘ mother, testified she did not recall telling an investigator\nduring a taped interview that Romero‘s ―attitude was very bad,‖ ―he never wanted to take\nresponsibility for anything that he did,‖ and he did poorly in school. When asked if it\nwas true Romero never wanted to take responsibility for his actions, Maria replied,\n―Well, he may have not liked to, no, but sometimes he did.‖ On cross-examination she\nagreed with defense counsel that if something had been Romero‘s fault, she would ―just\nbeat him.‖\n     Robin Levinson testified Maria Self had said during her taped interview: ―His\nattitude was very bad.

He denied things that would be in front of\nsomebody‘s face and he would still deny it. He didn‘t want to get up in the morning. He\ndidn‘t do well in school. He did very poorly.‖ On cross-examination, Levinson noted\nMaria had also said Romero ―had very low self-esteem, even though he was the best\nlooking kid on the block.‖\n\n                                    II. DISCUSSION6\n\nA.     Pretrial Issues\n\n       1.     Challenges to juror questionnaire\n     Self contends that asking each prospective juror to identify on the juror\nquestionnaire his or her race and ethnic background led to the improper discharge of\nprospective jurors based on race and ethnicity and resulted in the selection of a biased\njury that violated Self‘s right to a representative cross-section of the community.7 Before\n\n\n6      Before turning to defendants‘ claims, we address three preliminary matters. First,\ndefendants each make a blanket statement they join in all issues raised by each other that\nmay accrue to their benefit. We have recently strongly disapproved of this practice.\n(People v. Bryant, Smith and Wheeler (2014) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">60</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">335</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 363–364 (Bryant, Smith\nand Wheeler). As in Bryant, Smith and Wheeler, however, we will assume defendants\nhave complied with California Rules of Court, rules 8.630(a) and 8.200(a)(5), in order to\navoid further delay. (Bryant, Smith and Wheeler, at p. 364.)\n       Second, ―as to many claims defendants allege for the first time that the error\ncomplained of violated their federal constitutional rights. To the extent that in doing so\ndefendants have raised only a new constitutional ‗gloss‘ on claims preserved below, that\nnew aspect of the claims is not forfeited. However, ‗[n]o separate constitutional\ndiscussion is required, or provided, when rejection of a claim on the merits necessarily\nleads to rejection of [the] constitutional theory . . . .‘ ‖ (Bryant, Smith and Wheeler,\nsupra, 60 Cal.4th at p. 364.)\n        Finally, Romero‘s first ―claim‖ presents no claim of error but is simply a lengthy\nexegesis on how ―any substantial error could have affected the penalty verdict.‖ Absent\nreference to a claim of error, it is difficult to meaningfully assess or respond to his\ndiscussion. Where relevant, we invoke the proper standard of prejudice for that asserted\nerror, and nothing in Romero‘s discussion persuades us to revisit these standards.\n7      Question 1.D. read: ―Your race and ethnic origin: _____.‖\n\n                                            21\n\fjury selection defendants unsuccessfully objected to the use of a juror questionnaire\nbecause in their view it would be used by the prosecutor to strike any prospective juror\nexpressing ―even a minimal reservation about imposing the death penalty.‖ Once the\nquestionnaire was drafted, Self objected to a question regarding the then recent\nO.J. Simpson trial. Self did not object to the question regarding the prospective juror‘s\nrace and ethnic background, and the claim is therefore forfeited.\n     Self further contends use of the jury questionnaire to dismiss 56 prospective jurors\nwas unconstitutional. Several of these prospective jurors were questioned on voir dire,\nand in any event, Self stipulated to the dismissal of all of them and the claim is therefore\nforfeited. Although the trial court at times commented on the prospective jurors who had\nbeen stipulated for excusal, these statements were not findings. As we have explained:\n―A court may allow counsel to prescreen juror questionnaires and stipulate to juror\ndismissals. [Citations.] When prospective jurors are formally dismissed pursuant to\nstipulation rather than cause, the trial court makes no findings, and we have nothing we\ncan review. [Citation.] Consequently, a stipulation to the excusal of jurors forfeits any\nsubsequent objection to their omission from the jury pool.‖ (People v.

Asserted prosecutorial misconduct\n\n               a. Assertedly racially biased voir dire\n     Self contends during voir dire the prosecutor improperly and repeatedly asked\nHispanic prospective jurors more ―probing and detailed questions‖ than he asked\nCaucasian prospective jurors in a successful effort to eliminate ―all eligible, qualified\n\n\n                                             22\n\fHispanic prospective jurors from the final jury pool.‖ As Self concedes, he did not object\nbelow on the ground the prosecutor‘s voir dire was racially biased and the claim is\ntherefore forfeited.

Here, because no\nprosecutorial misconduct claim was raised below, we have no record—such as the\nprosecutor‘s reasons for the manner in which any particular prospective juror was\nquestioned—on which we can assess Self‘s claim.

Assertedly misleading comments about mitigation\n     Self contends the prosecutor misrepresented the nature of mitigating evidence\nduring voir dire. We disagree.\n     The prosecutor said to one group of prospective jurors: ―You may hear evidence in\nmitigation, things, perhaps the defendant was a war hero. Perhaps he saved his platoon in\nthe Persian Gulf and received a Silver Star. Perhaps he once pulled a family from a\nburning car. Perhaps he once gave bone marrow in a transplant so that a child could\nsurvive. Perhaps you may hear evidence that would make you have sympathy for him,\nall of which you can consider in making your [penalty] decision. And there is only one\ndecision to make when you are in the penalty phase, that is between life without parole or\ndeath. There is no other option in the penalty phase.‖ He made similar comments on\nother occasions, at times using hypothetical examples of Self being a scout leader or\nsoccer or Little League coach and having a positive effect on young people.\n     Defense counsel said to one group of prospective jurors: ―[W]e would present\nmitigating factors, things that we would want you to consider in terms of making this\ndecision, and those mitigating factors can be anything. There ha[ve] been previous\nexamples given by [the prosecutor] of . . . doing a heroic act, for example, or saving\nsomebody from a burning car, a burning building, providing a bone marrow transplant.\nWhat I am telling you is, I don‘t want you to have any preconceived notion as to what\nmitigating factors might be present. If the only people that deserve life without parole\nwould be heroes, nobody would probably receive it. Do you follow me?‖ He informed a\ndifferent group of prospective jurors ―[m]itigating factors . . . can be anything positive‖\nabout Self and another ―[m]itigating factors are anything that may tend to mitigate\nagainst what took place‖ including ―[p]ositive things about‖ Self.\n     At the end of the penalty phase the trial court instructed the jury that a ―mitigating\ncircumstance is any fact, condition, or event which, as such, does not constitute a\njustification or excuse for the crime in question, but may be considered as an extenuating\n\n                                             24\n\fcircumstance in determining the appropriateness of the death penalty.‖ It further\ninstructed the jury a mitigating circumstance did not have to be proved beyond a\nreasonable doubt; the jury need not unanimously agree on the presence of a mitigating\nfactor before a juror could consider it; the mitigating circumstances read were merely\nexamples and a juror could ―also consider any other circumstances relating to the case or\nto the defendant as shown by the evidence as reasons for not imposing the death penalty‖;\na juror could find a mitigating circumstance existed if there was any evidence, however\nweak, to support it; any mitigating circumstance could outweigh all the aggravating\nfactors; the jury could reject death as a penalty based solely on sympathy or compassion\nresulting from the mitigating evidence; and the jury could decide even in the absence of\nany mitigating evidence that the ―aggravating evidence is not comparatively substantial\nenough to warrant death.‖\n     Self did not object to the prosecutor‘s statements or seek an admonition, and no\nexception to the general rule requiring an objection and request for admonition is\napplicable. The claim is therefore forfeited. (People v. Samayoa (1997) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">795</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n841 (Samayoa).)\n     It is also meritless. Self contends that the prosecutor‘s comments were improper\nbecause they ―permitted the jury to infer that only highly or strongly mitigating evidence\nwould be worthy of consideration in deciding penalty and that [Self] was required to\nintroduce‖ such evidence ―to counter any evidence in aggravation [and] to establish that\nhe did not warrant death.‖ There is no reasonable likelihood the jury so construed the\nprosecutor‘s comments. (People v. Centeno (2014) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">60</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">659</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 667 [―When\nattacking the prosecutor‘s remarks to the jury, the defendant must show‖ in the context of\nthe whole argument and the instructions there was ― ‗a reasonable likelihood the jury\nunderstood or applied the complained-of comments in an improper or erroneous\nmanner.‘ ‖].) Here, defense counsel on at least one occasion corrected and clarified the\nprosecutor‘s remarks through his own voir dire comments. (People v. Seaton (2001) 26\n                                            </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span>\n\f<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">598</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 636.) More critically, the trial court‘s instructions at the end of trial fully\ninformed the jury that it could consider in mitigation any circumstance—no matter how\nweak the evidence of that circumstance—relating to the case or to Self, and could find\nlife imprisonment without the possibility of parole the appropriate penalty even in the\nabsence of any mitigating evidence.\n     Self further contends that the prosecutor improperly insinuated that Self ―bore a\nheavy burden of proof in order to obtain a sentence less than death.‖ Nothing in the\nprosecutor‘s remarks referred to a burden of proof and, once again, the trial court\nexhaustively instructed the jury on the proper definition and use of mitigating evidence.\n     In his reply brief Self asserts trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the\nprosecutor‘s challenged comments. There was no misconduct and therefore no\ndeficiency on counsel‘s part in failing to object.\n\n       3.     Evidence of Feltenberger’s attempted murder\n\n     Defendant Romero contends the trial court erred in admitting ―gruesome‖ evidence\nof Feltenberger‘s attempted murder to prove Romero received the victim‘s stolen\nammunition pouch. (§ 496; see ante, at pp. 6–8.) He asserts his ―guilt of the uncontested\nreceiving charge was clear without the attempted-murder testimony, so the error could\nnot have affected that determination,‖ but the testimony was prejudicial at the penalty\nphase. We disagree.\n     Before opening statements, the prosecutor moved to have the juries for both\ndefendants hear Feltenberger testify. The trial court admitted Feltenberger‘s testimony,\nbut directed defense counsel to prepare a limiting instruction, and admonished the\nprosecutor not to in any way suggest Romero was involved in Feltenberger‘s shooting.\nBefore Feltenberger testified, the trial court instructed the Romero jury: ―You are about\nto hear evidence in the form of testimony from John Feltenberger. This evidence is not\nbeing offered to show that the defendant Orlando Romero is involved in the alleged\n\n\n                                              26\n\frobbery and attempted murder of Mr. Feltenberger. On the contrary, there will be no\nevidence provided that Mr. Romero was . . . involved in this incident. Instead, this\nevidence is being offered as it relates to Count XX, receiving stolen property. You are to\nconsider it solely as it relates [to], one, whether the property was in fact stolen, and, two,\nwhether Mr. Romero had knowledge that the property was stolen.‖ After Feltenberger‘s\ntestimony, Romero unsuccessfully moved to preclude testimony by other witnesses\ndescribing the investigation into the Feltenberger shooting, including the discovery of the\nred sabot material found in Feltenberger. At the close of the guilt phase the trial court\ngave Romero‘s jury a limiting instruction similar to that given before Feltenberger‘s\ntestimony.\n     Here Romero asserts only that the evidence was prejudicial at the penalty phase, and\nwe therefore need not consider whether it was properly admitted at the guilt phase.\nAssuming, therefore, without deciding, that evidence of the details of the attack on\nFeltenberger was improperly admitted, there is no reasonable possibility a different\npenalty verdict would have resulted absent admission of this evidence. (See People v.\nBrown (1988) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1405930\"><a href=\"/opinion/1405930/people-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">432</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 448.) Both before Feltenberger‘s testimony and at the close\nof the guilt phase the trial court instructed the jury the evidence was not being offered to\nshow Romero was involved in the robbery or attempted murder of Feltenberger and there\nwas no evidence Romero was involved in this incident. We presume the jury understood\nand followed this instruction. (People v. Hajek and Vo (2014) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">58</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1144</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1178.)\nMoreover, other evidence demonstrated Romero‘s role in the brutal and unprovoked\nmurders of Aragon, Jones, and Mans, and the attempted murders of Kenneth Mills,\nWilliams, and Rankins, as well as his in-custody violence against Medeiros, Jutras,\nThibedeau, and Hodges. In addition, the jury acquitted Romero of the Steenblock\nrobbery and kidnapping charges, showing it carefully evaluated the evidence.\n\n\n\n\n                                              27\n\f       4.     Joinder and severance\n\n     Romero contends that joinder of the Magnolia Center Interiors (Magnolia Center)\nburglary (predicated on entry with intent to steal and vandalize) and vandalism charges\nand the receiving stolen property (Feltenberger‘s ammunition pouch) charge with the\nremaining counts was ―statutorily unauthorized‖ under section 954. Defendants further\ncontend the trial court abused its discretion in denying the motion to sever the Magnolia\nCenter charges from the remaining charges, and Romero asserts the trial court abused its\ndiscretion in failing to sever the charge of receiving stolen property from the remaining\ncharges against him. We disagree.\n     Before trial, Self, joined by Romero, moved to sever the murder counts from the\nremaining charges. Defendants focused particularly on severing the murder counts from\nthe counts involving the attempted murders of Feltenberger and Williams. The motion to\nsever did not contest that the statutory requirements for joinder had been met. The trial\ncourt denied the motion.\n     Because it generally promotes efficiency, joinder of charges is ― ‗preferred by the\nlaw.‘ ‖ (People v. Hartsch (2010) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2518093\"><a href=\"/opinion/2518093/people-v-hartsch/\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">472</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 493 (Hartsch).) When the statutory\njoinder requirements are met, a defendant can demonstrate error in a ― ‗ruling allowing\njoint trial . . . only by making a ―clear showing of prejudice . . . .‖ ‘ ‖ (Ibid.) As can be\nseen, defendants did not claim joinder of any of the counts was statutorily unauthorized.\nUnder section 954, this claim is therefore forfeited.\n     Even had the claims of improper joinder not been forfeited, they would have lacked\nmerit. The charges were properly joined because they were ―connected . . . in their\ncommission‖ within the meaning of section 954. Charges are so connected if ― ‗ ―there is\na common element of substantial importance in their commission.‖ ‘ ‖ (Alcala v.\nSuperior Court (2008) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1205</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1218, italics omitted.) Here, the crimes all\noccurred within a two-month time period and, as the trial court observed, each involved a\nfelonious intent to obtain property. (People v.

Contrary to Romero‘s contention that\nthe ―tenor‖ of the Magnolia Center burglary was vandalism, not theft, defendants were\ncharged with burglary premised in part on entry with an intent to steal. Moreover, the\nevidence demonstrated defendants made a concerted but unsuccessful effort to break into\nthe Magnolia Center store safe and stole other items from the store. Neither the\ncircumstance that defendants also committed vandalism nor the minimal worth of the\nobjects taken obviated their intent to steal.\n     Nor did defendants move to sever the Magnolia Center burglary and vandalism\ncharges from the remaining counts, or Romero move to sever the charge of receiving\nstolen property from the remaining charges against him.

On appeal, however,\ndefendants claim the evidence was not cross-admissible. ―We need not affirmatively\ndecide, however, whether the evidence would have been cross-admissible in separate\ntrials because, as defendant[s] acknowledge[], lack of cross-admissibility is not\ndispositive of whether the court abused its discretion in denying severance.‖ (People v.\nMyles (2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1181</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1201, citing § 954.1.)

Evidence of the murders, the burglary\nand vandalism of Magnolia Center, and Romero‘s receipt of stolen property was strong.\nNor was evidence of the Magnolia Center crimes or Romero‘s receipt of stolen property\nmore inflammatory than evidence defendants had callously murdered three young men,\nand attempted to murder three other individuals. Moreover, ―[e]ven where the People\npresent capital charges, joinder is proper so long as evidence of each charge is so strong\nthat consolidation is unlikely to affect the verdict.‖ (People v.

Given the brutal circumstances\nunderlying their three murder and three attempted murder convictions, and Self‘s\nadditional conviction for the attempted murder of Feltenberger, there is no reasonable\npossibility that a different verdict would have resulted had the jury not heard evidence of\nthreatening graffiti and the stabbing of a sonogram photograph during the Magnolia\nCenter burglary and vandalism. To the extent Romero asserts a similar claim regarding\njoinder of the receipt of stolen property charge, we have already concluded that even\nassuming evidence of the details of the attack on Feltenberger were improperly admitted,\nthere is no reasonable possibility a different penalty verdict would have resulted absent\nadmission of this evidence.

Accomplice corroboration\n\n     The trial court instructed the jury that Jose Munoz was an accomplice as a matter of\nlaw as to certain crimes, including the crimes against Kenneth Mills and Vicky Ewy\n(counts V-VIII), and Knoefler (count XV), and ―his testimony [was] subject to the rule\nrequiring corroboration.‖9 (§ 1111; see ante, at pp. 3, 5.) Self contends Munoz‘s\n\n9      The court instructed Self‘s jury:\n       ―A defendant cannot be found guilty based upon the testimony of an accomplice\nunless such testimony is corroborated by other evidence which tends to connect such\ndefendant with the commission of the offense. . . . To corroborate the testimony of an\naccomplice there must be evidence of some act or fact related to the crime which, if\nbelieved, by itself and without any aid, interpretation, or direction from the testimony of\nthe accomplice, tends to connect the defendant with the commission of the crime\n                                             31\n\ftestimony was not corroborated and therefore his convictions for the crimes against\nKenneth Mills, Ewy, and Knoefler must be reversed. He further contends the evidence\nwas insufficient to establish his guilt as an aider and abettor of the crimes against\nKnoefler. We conclude Munoz‘s testimony was corroborated as to the crimes against\nKenneth Mills and Ewy, but not as to the robbery of Knoefler. We therefore reverse\nSelf‘s conviction and sentence for Knoefler‘s robbery.\n     Section 1111 provides in part: ―A conviction can not be had upon the testimony of\nan accomplice unless it be corroborated by such other evidence as shall tend to connect\nthe defendant with the commission of the offense; and the corroboration is not sufficient\nif it merely shows the commission of the offense or the circumstances thereof.‖ The\nrequirement that accomplice testimony be corroborated is an ― ‗exception[]‘ to the\nsubstantial evidence‖ rule.

However, it is not necessary that the evidence of corroboration be sufficient in\nitself to establish every element of the crime charged or that it corroborate every fact to\nwhich the accomplice testifies. In determining whether an accomplice has been\ncorroborated, you must first assume the testimony of the accomplice has been removed\nfrom the case. You must then determine whether there is any remaining evidence which\ntends to connect the defendant with the commission of the crime. If there is not such\nindependent evidence that tends to connect the defendant with the commission of the\ncrime, the testimony of the accomplice is not corroborated. If there is such independent\nevidence which you believe, then the testimony of the accomplice is corroborated. If the\ncrimes charged in the Information except Counts XI–XIV, XVI, XVII, and XX–XXIII\n[were] committed by anyone, the witness Jose Munoz was an accomplice as a matter of\nlaw and his testimony is subject to the rule requiring corroboration. The testimony of an\naccomplice ought to be viewed with distrust. This does not mean that you may arbitrarily\ndisregard such testimony, but you should give to it the weight to which you find it to be\nentitled after examining it with care and caution and in the light of all the evidence in the\ncase.‖ (Italics added.)\n\n                                             32\n\f―reflects a legislative determination of how accomplice testimony must be treated.‖\n(Bryant, Smith and Wheeler, supra, 60 Cal.4th at p. 434; see id. at pp. 453–454; People v.\nBowley (1963) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2606663\"><a href=\"/opinion/2606663/people-v-bowley/\"><span class=\"volume\">59</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">855</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 858.)\n     Thus, for the jury to rely on an accomplice‘s testimony about the circumstances of\nan offense, it must find evidence that ― ‗without aid from the accomplice‘s testimony,\ntend[s] to connect the defendant with the crime.‘ ‖ (People v.

Crimes against Kenneth Mills and Ewy\n     Kenneth Mills testified that on October 22, 1992, between 11:30 p.m. and midnight,\nhe and his girlfriend Vicky Ewy took a drive to look at the lightning. Mills was driving.\nAs they drove down Moreno Beach Drive, a dark grey or blue hatchback coming in the\nopposite direction made a U-turn and began to drive in front of them. At the next stop\nsign the cars were next to each other, and the other car turned on its high beams and\nfollowed the victims. As Mills started to turn right, he saw for ―no more than a second‖\nthe silhouette of a car next to him, and a ―person from the waist up out of the‖ front\n―passenger window pointing a gun at me.‖ The gun fired, hitting Mills in the face, and\nMills sped away. He could not see out of his right eye and the vision in his left eye was\nblurry. The assailants continued to chase them until Mills turned onto a golf cart path\nnear three model homes, one of which had all its lights on. Mills permanently lost vision\nin his right eye. A bullet hole was found in the top of the driver‘s window of Ewy‘s car\nand another hole near the bottom of the passenger window. Twenty-gauge plastic\nshotgun wadding was found on the passenger side floor. Shotgun pellets, too damaged\nfor their size to be determined, were found in the passenger door.\n     Munoz testified that on or about the night of October 22, 1992, he was riding with\ndefendants in Romero‘s girlfriend Sonia Alvarez‘s Dodge Colt in an isolated area past\nMoreno Valley and near Lake Perris. Romero was driving, Munoz was in the passenger\nseat, and Self was in the backseat. They had Self‘s sawed-off shotgun and a ―single shot‖\nrifle and were ―going out stealing.‖ They saw Ewy‘s red car, which Munoz identified at\ntrial, and turned around. They pulled up alongside the car at a stop sign, and Munoz ―was\nready to get out . . . [and] carjack them.‖ But Romero said, ―Shoot ‘em,‖ and Self\nclimbed out of the backseat window on the driver‘s side and fired the shotgun across the\ntop of the Colt at the victims. The bullet hit the victims‘ driver‘s window, and the\nvictims drove away.\n\n\n\n                                             34\n\f      Munoz‘s testimony was corroborated in part by the circumstance that 20-gauge\nshotgun wadding was found in Ewy‘s car on the passenger side floor. Self admitted in\nhis statement to police that he had possessed a 20-gauge shotgun for about a month\nbefore he shot Feltenberger on November 30, 1992, and victim Jerry Mills, Sr. identified\nSelf as the person holding a shotgun in that robbery. ―Possession of a gun similar to that\nused in the commission of the crime has been deemed competent corroborative\nevidence . . . .‖ (People v.

Robbery of Knoefler\n     Self contends no evidence corroborated Munoz‘s testimony that Self was ―even in\nthe car or otherwise present at the scene‖ of Knoefler‘s robbery. We agree.\n     Knoefler testified that on November 20, 1992, about 3:30 p.m., he was tending\nbeehives at Markham Street and Washington Street in Riverside County. Parked nearby\nwas his 1987 pickup truck. A man approached Knoefler, struck up a conversation about\nthe bees, and walked around the bee yard. Knoefler testified he ―seemed to be [a] pretty\nnice guy.‖ The man then brandished what appeared to be a sawed-off shotgun and\n\n\n                                             36\n\fdemanded the keys to Knoefler‘s truck. Knoefler gave him the keys. Another man\nwearing a ski mask appeared. The first man said he needed some money for gas, and\nKnoefler handed him about $50. The men left in the truck.\n     Munoz testified that during the daytime on or about November 20, 1992, he was\nriding in Alvarez‘s Colt with defendants and Chavez. They were ―going to go steal,‖ and\nwere carrying Self‘s 20-gauge shotgun and perhaps another weapon. They noticed the\nbeekeeper, and decided to send Romero, carrying Self‘s shotgun, to see what valuables\nthe man had. After a few minutes, Munoz, wearing a mask, went to see what ―was taking\nhim so long‖ and hid when he heard Romero and the beekeeper talking. Romero told the\n―old man‖ he needed his truck, and the man said, ―I was wondering why you were being\nso nice to me.‖ Munoz appeared and Romero told the man ―I‘m going to need gas\nmoney,‖ and the man offered Romero $25. Romero said he wanted all of it, and the man\ngave him about $75. Munoz and Romero then left in Knoefler‘s truck and drove back to\nthe Colt. Self and Chavez, in the Colt, followed Romero and Munoz to an open field.\nRomero and Munoz pushed the truck down an embankment, then got into the Colt and\nleft the area.\n     Although a shotgun was used in the robbery, and Self admitted in his statement to\npolice that he had possessed a shotgun for about a month before he shot Feltenberger on\nNovember 30, 1992, there is no dispute Romero, not Self, was holding the shotgun when\nKnoefler was robbed. Thus, this circumstance does not corroborate Munoz‘s testimony\nthat Self was present at the robbery. (See People v.

Such consistency and knowledge of the\ndetails of the crime simply proves the accomplice was at the crime scene, something the\naccomplice by definition admits. Rather, under section 1111, the corroboration must\nconnect the defendant to the crime independent of the accomplice‘s testimony.\n     As originally enacted in 1872, section 1111 provided: ―A conviction cannot be had\non the testimony of an accomplice, unless he is corroborated by other evidence which in\nitself, and without the aid of the testimony of the accomplice, tends to connect the\ndefendant with the commission of the offense; and the corroboration is not sufficient, if it\nmerely shows the commission of the offense, or the circumstances thereof.‖ (Ann.

In Ames, the robbers were disguised\nand used numbers during the robbery to refer to one another. (Id. at pp. 403–404) At one\npoint a robber was referred to as ―Charley‖ and the speaker immediately substituted the\nterm ―Number Three.‖ (Ibid.) One of the robbers testified at trial that the defendant\nCharles Ames was known as ―Charley,‖ and during the robbery was designated ―Number\nThree.‖ (Id. at p. 404.) This court reversed the judgment against the defendant, stating:\n―[T]he corroborating evidence must, of itself, and without the aid of the testimony of the\naccomplice, tend, in some degree, to connect the defendant with the commission of the\noffense. It need not, of course, be sufficient to establish his guilt; for, in that event, the\ntestimony of the accomplice would not be needed. But it must tend, in some slight\n                                               38\n\fdegree at least, to implicate the defendant. . . . [A]side from the testimony of the\naccomplice, and laying that entirely out of view, there was no evidence whatever in this\ncase ‗tending to connect the defendant with the commission of the offense.‘ The fact that\none of the robbers was addressed as ‗Charley,‘ and again as ‗Number Three,‘ and that\nthey designated each other by numbers, no more tends, of itself, to connect the defendant\nwith the crime than it would . . . any one else.‖ (Id. at pp. 404–405.)\n     In 1911, the statute was revised, as relevant here, to its present form (except for the\nsubstitution in 1915 of ―it‖ for ―he‖ in the first clause). (Stats. 1911, ch. 292, § 1, p. 484.)\nThis court subsequently held that the 1911 amendment did not change the meaning of the\nstatute. (People v.

Evidence of Romero’s attempted escape\n\n     Defendant Romero contends that the trial court erred in admitting escape evidence\nbecause it amounted to no more than planning and did not constitute an attempt. We\ndisagree.\n     Before trial the prosecutor moved to admit escape evidence at the guilt phase.\nRomero unsuccessfully opposed the motion on the ground that it was unduly prejudicial\nunder Evidence Code section 352.12\n     ― ‗Evidence of a planned escape permits an inference of consciousness of guilt, even\nif the escape was not actually attempted.‘ ‖ (People v.

Attempted escape requires ―a specific intent to escape‖ and ― ‗a\ndirect, unequivocal act to effect that purpose.‘ ‖ (Id. at p. 749.)\n     Here, Romero‘s intent to escape was demonstrated by his statement to fellow inmate\nDicken that he was planning to escape by taking the nighttime deputy hostage,\nthreatening him with a shank, and leaving the jail. Romero also committed acts to\neffectuate this intent when he obtained hacksaw blades, completely severed the bars to\nhis cell, creating a hole large enough to escape, and armed himself.

[¶] The Legislature has not proscribed the doing of any single\ndefined act as an attempt to escape.

Asserted prosecutorial misconduct\n\n        Self contends the prosecutor repeatedly vouched for the credibility of Jose Munoz\nduring his opening statement and closing argument. Not so.\n        Self did not object to the prosecutor‘s statements or seek an admonition, and no\nexception to the general rule requiring an objection and request for admonition is\napplicable. The claim is therefore forfeited. (Samayoa, supra, 15 Cal.4th at p. 841.)\n\n\n\n                                              41\n\f     It is also meritless. ―A prosecutor is prohibited from vouching for the credibility of\nwitnesses or otherwise bolstering the veracity of their testimony by referring to evidence\noutside the record.‖ (People v.

Here, the\nprosecutor simply advanced the view Munoz was credible based on the evidence, which\nis permissible.\n     Self further asserts counsel was ineffective in failing to object to the prosecutor‘s\nstatements. For example, Self contends effective counsel would have objected when the\nprosecutor improperly referred to Munoz‘s statement to police, thus implying that\nevidence the jury had not seen established Munoz‘s veracity. Contrary to Self‘s\nimplication, the jury heard nearly all of Munoz‘s statement, and the remainder was\ndescribed by the interviewing officer. There was no misconduct, hence there was no\nvalid basis for objection.\n\n       4.     Asserted instructional error\n\n                  a. Accomplice instructions\n     Self contends the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury sua sponte it could\nnot aggregate evidence or incidents to corroborate the accomplice testimony of Munoz\nand to determine guilt. There was no error.\n     The trial court instructed the jury in the language of CALJIC No. 17.02: ―Each\ncount charges a distinct crime. You must decide each count separately. The defendant\nmay be found guilty or not guilty of any or all of the crimes charged. Your finding as to\neach count must be stated in a separate verdict.‖ Self contends the court, sua sponte,\nshould have modified this instruction to tell the jury it ―must decide each count separately\n\n\n                                               42\n\fon the law and the evidence applicable to it, including the evidence required to\ncorroborate the accomplice‘s testimony.‖\n     Self has forfeited this claim by failing to request a modification of CALJIC\nNo. 17.02. (People v. Geier (2007) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2599781\"><a href=\"/opinion/2599781/people-v-geier/\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">555</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 579 [the defendant‘s failure ―even to\npropose a modification of CALJIC No. 17.02, or to propose an additional instruction‖\nforfeited the instructional error claim].)\n     The claim also lacks merit. The instructions given informed the jury of the offenses\nfor which Munoz was an accomplice as a matter of law, and that his testimony as to\ncertain charged offenses must be ―corroborated by other evidence which tends to connect\nsuch defendant with the commission of the offense.‖ (Italics added.) They further\nprovided, ―To corroborate the testimony of an accomplice there must be evidence of\nsome act or fact related to the crime which, if believed, by itself and without any aid,\ninterpretation, or direction from the testimony of the accomplice, tends to connect the\ndefendant with the commission of the crime charged.‖ (Italics added.) This language\ninformed the jury that evidence corroborating Munoz‘s testimony was required for each\ncount as to which Munoz was an accomplice as a matter of law. Contrary to Self‘s\nassertion, there is no reasonable likelihood the jury would have understood the\ninstructions to mean it could ―use[] Feltenberger‘s corroborating testimony as to counts\nXVIII and XIX to find the requisite corroboration on unrelated counts V through VII,‖ or\ntreat ―Munoz‘s accomplice testimony as to counts I and II‖ as ―corroborated by the\nvictim‘s testimony in the unrelated . . . Meredith robbery (count IV) or by‖ Rankin‘s\ntestimony regarding the shooting in counts IX and X.\n     Self further contends that in the absence of his proposed instruction the jury likely\nwould ―treat evidence of [Self‘s] involvement on some counts as evidence of his guilt on\nother, unrelated counts charged against him.‖ To the extent Self claims the jury could not\nconsider evidence on one count to prove his guilt on other counts we reject the claim.\n(See People v.

CALJIC No. 3.02\n     Romero contends instruction in the language of CALJIC No. 3.02 creates an\nunconstitutional mandatory presumption that aiding and abetting a robbery in which\nmurder was a natural and probable consequence is equivalent to aiding and abetting\nmurder, and thus ―effectively require[s]‖ the jury to presume ―intent to encourage or\nfacilitate a murder.‖13 We need not address this issue because the jury here was also\ninstructed on felony murder based on robbery and found true robbery-murder special-\ncircumstance allegations as to all three murders.14 We can deduce from these special\n\n13      The court instructed the jury in the language of CALJIC No. 3.02: ―One who\naid[s] and abets another in the commission of a crime is not only guilty of that crime but\nis also guilty of any other crime committed by the principal which is a natural and\nprobable consequence of the crime[] originally aided and abetted. In order to find the\ndefendant guilty of the crime of murder . . . as an aider and abettor, you must be satisfied\nbeyond a reasonable doubt: One, the crime of robbery or attempt[ed] robbery was\ncommitted; Two, the defendant aided and abetted such crime; Three, a co-principal in\nsuch crime committed the crime of murder, and, Four, the crime of murder was a natural\nand probable consequence of the commission of the crime of robbery or attempt[ed]\nrobbery.‖\n14      The trial court instructed the jury: ―The unlawful killing of a human being,\nwhether intentional, unintentional, or accidental, which occurs during the commission or\nattempted commission of the crime as a direct causal result of robbery is murder of the\nfirst degree when the perpetrator had the specific intent to commit such crime. The\nspecific intent to commit robbery and the commission or attempted commission of such\ncrime must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. If a human being is killed by any one\nof several persons engaged in the commission or attempted commission of the crime of\nrobbery, all persons who either directly and actively commit the act constituting such\ncrime, or who with knowledge of the unlawful purpose of the perpetrator of the crime and\nwith the intent or purpose of committing, encouraging, or facilitating the commission of\nthe offense aid, promote, encourage, or instigate by act or advice its commission, are\nguilty of murder in the first degree whether the killing is intentional, unintentional, or\naccidental.‖\n\n                                             44\n\fcircumstance findings that the jury necessarily found Romero guilty of first degree\nfelony-murder under section 189.

Thus, there was no need for the jury to find, as\nRomero contends, an ―intent to encourage or facilitate a murder.‖\n     The felony-murder rule operates independently from an ―aider and abettor‘s liability\nfor murder under the natural and probable consequences doctrine.‖ (People v.

To the extent the jury understood it also needed to find ―the\ncrime of murder was a natural and probable consequence of the commission of the crime\nof robbery or attempt[ed] robbery‖ because it was instructed in the language of CALJIC\nNo. 3.02, Romero could have only benefitted from this ambiguity.\n\n               c. Reasonable doubt instruction\n     Defendants contend instruction in the language of CALJIC No. 2.90 does not\nadequately define reasonable doubt. Self additionally contends such instruction in\nconjunction with other jury instructions impermissibly undermined and diluted the\nprosecutor‘s burden of proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.15 We disagree.\n\n\n\n15      Both juries received the standard instruction on reasonable doubt. The court\ninstructed Romero‘s jury: ―A defendant in a criminal action is presumed to be innocent\nuntil the contrary is proved, and in case of a reasonable doubt whether his guilt is\nsatisfactorily shown, he is entitled to a verdict of not guilty. This presumption places\nupon the People . . . the burden of proving him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\nReasonable doubt is defined as follows: It is not a mere possible doubt, because\neverything relating to human affairs is open to some possible or imaginary doubt. It is\nthat state of the case which, after the entire comparison and consideration of all the\nevidence, leaves the minds of the jurors in that condition that they cannot say they feel an\nabiding conviction of the truth of the charge.‖ A virtually identical instruction was given\nto Self‘s jury.\n\n                                            45\n\f     The court‘s instruction properly defined the prosecution‘s burden of proof.

Nor, as he also asserts, does the instruction erroneously inform the jury\nthat reasonable doubt is ―not a mere possible doubt‖ (Capistrano, at p. 880) or err in the\nuse of the term ―until‖ instead of ―unless‖ when it provides ― ‗[a] defendant in a criminal\naction is presumed to be innocent until the contrary is proved‘ ‖ (People v.

Romero told Hodges that ―if he had his way about\nit . . . he would . . . take [Hodges] out.‖ Romero squirted urine from a bottle on Hodges,\nstepped on a carton of feces, splattering the contents on Hodges, and ―squished‖ a\nshampoo bottle containing urine, causing it to hit Hodges.

(See Lancaster, supra, 41 Cal.4th at p. 94 [mere preparation for\nescape is insufficient under § 190.3].) Because we have previously concluded the\n\n\n\n                                             53\n\fevidence here demonstrated an attempted escape (see ante, pp. 40–41), this contention\nfails.\n         Romero further contends that the escape evidence did not demonstrate an express or\nimplied threat of force or violence under section 190.3, factor (b). He did not object on\nthis basis below, and the claim is therefore forfeited. It is also meritless. Although\nevidence of attempted escape alone is not admissible under section 190.3, factor (b), here\nthe evidence indicated Romero not only planned to escape by taking the nighttime deputy\nhostage and threatening him with a shank, he was also observed with a shank, and a\nweapon was found in his cell. That is sufficient. (Mason, supra, 52 Cal.3d at pp. 954–\n956 [escape evidence admissible under § 190.3, factor (b) when ―an escape from the\nadministrative segregation cell would almost certainly have involved defendant in a\nconfrontation with a guard‖].)\n         Romero further contends trial counsel was ineffective in failing to object to\nevidence of the escape attempt at the guilt phase on the ground the evidence ―had no\nlegitimate use‖ at the penalty phase. The evidence was admissible; therefore, he\nestablishes no deficiency on counsel‘s part in failing to object on this basis.\n         Romero also contends that instruction in the language of CALJIC Nos. 6.00, 6.01,\nand 6.02 ―fail[ed] to ensure that the jury understood that the purported escape attempt\ncould not be weighed as a circumstance in aggravation if it was only preparation.‖18 Not\n\n\n18     The court instructed the jury: ―An attempt to commit a crime consists of two\nelements, namely, a specific intent to commit the crime and a direct but ineffectual act\ndone towards its commission. In determining whether or not such an act was done, it is\nnecessary to distinguish between mere preparation, on the one hand, and the actual\ncommencement of the doing of the criminal deed, on the other. Mere preparation which\nmay . . . consist of planning the offense or of devising or obtaining or arranging the\nmeans for its commission, is not sufficient to constitute an attempt. However, acts of a\nperson who intends to commit a crime will constitute an attempt where those acts clearly\nindicate a certain, unambiguous intent to commit that specific crime. Such acts must be\nan immediate step in the present execution of the criminal design, the progress of which\nwould be completed unless interrupted by some circumstance not intended in the original\n                                                54\n\fso. The court instructed the jury mere preparation was ―not sufficient to constitute an\nattempt,‖ and further required the jury—in order to find Romero had committed\nattempted escape by force or violence—to find Romero‘s ―acts clearly indicate[d] a\ncertain, unambiguous intent to‖ escape and were ―an immediate step in the present\nexecution of the criminal design, the progress of which would be completed unless\ninterrupted by some circumstance not intended in the original design.‖ It is not clear\nwhether instruction in the language of CALJIC No. 6.00 is consistent with our recent\ndiscussion of attempted escape in Bailey, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">740</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, but to the extent the\ncourt‘s instructions were too stringent, Romero could have only benefitted from the error.\n(See id. at p. 749 [stating attempted escape requires ―a specific intent to escape‖ and ― ‗a\ndirect, unequivocal act to effect that purpose‘ ‖]; and see id. at p. 750 [noting ― ‗[t]he\nintroduction into the concept of attempt to escape of a requirement of intentionally doing\nan act, the direct, natural and probable consequence of which, if successfully completed,\nwould be an escape, too narrowly limits the application of the [escape] statute‘ ‖].)\n\n                    (3) Shank\n     Romero contends the trial court erred in admitting evidence he possessed shanks in\njail. Romero did not challenge the admission of this evidence below, and the claim is\ntherefore forfeited. It is also meritless. ― ‗It is settled that a defendant‘s knowing\npossession of a potentially dangerous weapon in custody is admissible under [section\n190.3,] factor (b). Such conduct is unlawful and involves an implied threat of violence\n\n\n\n\ndesign. A person who has once committed acts which constitute an attempt to commit a\ncrime is liable for the crime of attempted escape by force or violence even though he does\nnot proceed further with the intent to commit the crime, either by reason of voluntarily\nabandoning his purpose or because he was prevented or interfered with in completing the\ncrime. If a person intends to commit a crime but, before committing an act toward the\nultimate commission of the crime, freely and voluntarily abandons the original intent and\nmakes no effort to accomplish it, such person has not attempted to commit the crime.‖\n                                              55\n\feven where there is no evidence defendant used or displayed it in a provocative or\nthreatening manner.‘ ‖ (People v.

Exclusion of mitigating evidence\n     Romero contends the trial court erroneously excluded his mother Maria Self‘s\ntestimony that as a child she had been raped repeatedly by two of her brothers.\n     During Maria‘s direct testimony, she said her relationship with two of her brothers\nwas ―not good‖ because she ―was afraid of them.‖ When counsel asked why she was\nafraid, the prosecutor‘s relevance objection was sustained. At sidebar, counsel said he\nwas eliciting testimony Maria had been raped by her brothers for seven years starting\nwhen she was six years old. The court stated Maria‘s engaging in abusive behavior\ntoward her sons was relevant, but the reason why she was abusive was not relevant.\nAfter hearing further argument, the court ruled such testimony was not relevant ―at this\npoint in time‖ because it did not ―relate to factors in mitigation for the defendants.‖ Even\nif the evidence were relevant, the court found it ―highly prejudicial‖ because it would\nconfuse and mislead the jury, and therefore also excluded it under Evidence Code section\n352. The court further stated that if on cross-examination it appeared the prosecutor\nraised ―any issues that might open the door to her giving this testimony on redirect,‖ it\nwould reconsider its ruling. Counsel did not raise the issue after Maria‘s cross-\nexamination.\n     ― ‗The Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments require that the sentencer in a capital\ncase not be precluded from considering any relevant mitigating evidence, that is,\nevidence regarding ―any aspect of a defendant‘s character or record and any of the\ncircumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than\ndeath.‖ ‘ [Citation.] ‗Nonetheless, the trial court still ― ‗determines relevancy in the first\ninstance and retains discretion to exclude evidence whose probative value is substantially\noutweighed by the probability that its admission will create substantial danger of\n\n\n                                              56\n\fconfusing the issues or misleading the jury.‘ ‖ ‘ (People v.

Asserted prosecutorial misconduct\n\n     Romero contends the prosecutor committed misconduct when he misled the court\nabout his intended use of Romero‘s statement to his girlfriend Stephanie Stinson, and\nthen used the statement to argue Romero‘s future dangerousness. There was no\nmisconduct.\n     As noted above, on June 12, 1994, Romero lured fellow Riverside jail inmate Olen\nThibedeau to his cell and then stabbed him in the stomach with a spear more than four\nfeet long. (See ante, p. 12.) Thibedeau was facing charges of child molestation and was\nlater convicted of these crimes. On February 8, 1995, Romero visited with Stephanie\nStinson and their conversation was recorded. Romero said: ―I don‘t like violence. I try\nto avoid it. But when they stick a child molester next door to me [and] expect me not to\ndo something, I‘ll be his friend, talk to him real nice, bring him close to the door, and\nthen make him a little spear about this long, about this skinny, that‘s real hard and won‘t\nbend. You put a pencil at the end of it and strips of wood. [¶] . . . [¶] Stick him in his\nneck.‖\n\n\n\n                                              57\n\f     At the hearing on whether to admit Romero‘s statement to Stinson, the prosecutor\nobserved that on cross-examination the defense had ―made quite an effort to impugn . . .\nThibedeau‘s credibility.‖ The prosecutor contended that Romero‘s later statement to\nStinson was an admission that ―he did[] exactly what . . . Thibedeau said.‖ The trial court\nadmitted the statement to rehabilitate Thibedeau.\n     During closing argument, the prosecutor said Romero ―has shown in jail since his\narrest that he is not done hurting people, that he still wants to kill and rob and terrorize\nand hurt.‖ He described Romero‘s attempted escape in which he planned to threaten a\nguard with a shank, his possession of shanks in jail, the robbery and beatings of Medeiros\nand Jutras, and the battery of Hodges with urine and feces. The prosecutor then said,\n―And he tried to run a spear through . . . Thibedeau.‖ After describing the incident, the\nprosecutor said: ―He is proud of it. Romero is proud of it. You heard him fondly\nremembering this event on tape.‖ He played the tape of Romero‘s statement to Stinson,\nand said: ―He is so proud. Mr. Romero gives you your verdict right there. You can‘t\nexpect him not to do something like this. He said it, ‗But when they stick a child\nmolester next door to me and not expect me to do something . . . .‘ He is telling you what\nto expect from him. You don‘t need a crystal ball to know what to expect from Mr.\nRomero in the future.‖ The prosecutor subsequently argued: ―Look at how he acted\nwhen he was free. He murdered people. When he had everything to lose, he murdered\npeople. Look at how he acted in the jail when he had this trial pending and he had\nsomething to lose. How is he going to act when he has nothing left to lose, when he has\ngot LWOP and they can‘t do anything else to him? It‘s an American Express card for\nviolence.‖ The prosecutor also noted that Romero would come into contact with ―nurses,\nclerks, guards, counselors, [and] other inmates,‖ and said: ―[W]hat we know about him is\nthat he likes to hurt people. The best predictor of the future is the past. He has 30, 40, 50\nyears of victims ahead of him if he has an LWOP, if he has life without parole.‖ The\n\n\n                                              58\n\fprosecutor also said, ―Consider 50 years of what you have seen of the last three years.\nDon‘t let the price of your compassion be another victim.‖\n      On appeal, Romero expressly does not challenge admission of his statement to\nStinson. Rather he contends that the prosecutor deceived the trial court by successfully\nseeking admission of the statement to rehabilitate Thibedeau‘s credibility and then using\nthe statement instead to improperly argue future dangerousness and urge the jury to\nconsider an aggravating factor not listed in section 190.3.\n      Romero cites no authority for the novel proposition a prosecutor commits\nmisconduct during closing argument by drawing a reasonable inference from properly\nadmitted evidence if he did not mention the inference at the time admissibility was\nsought. Rather, the crux of Romero‘s claim is that future dangerousness is an\naggravating factor not listed in section 190.3 and therefore improperly relied on by a\nprosecutor during argument. Romero correctly notes this court has never delineated why\nthere is no conflict between the circumstance that section 190.3 sets forth an exclusive\nlist of aggravating factors, not expressly including future dangerousness, and our line of\ncases holding ―[p]rosecutorial argument regarding a capital defendant‘s future\ndangerousness is permissible if . . . it is based on evidence of the defendant‘s conduct\nrather than expert opinion.‖ (People v.

A\nprediction that a defendant will be dangerous in the future based on evidence admitted\nunder factors (a)–(c) is not itself a fact or an aggravating factor. It is an inference drawn\nfrom the aggravating evidence, and is properly argued by a prosecutor and considered by\nthe jury in making its penalty determination. (See People v.

As the high court has\nrecognized, ― ‗any sentencing authority must predict a convicted person‘s probable future\nconduct when it engages in the process of determining what punishment to impose.‘ ‖\n(California v.

Rather, the prediction of future\ndangerousness was supported by the evidence, properly argued by the prosecutor, and\nproperly considered by the jury.\n\n\n\n19     In Lucas, supra, 60 Cal.4th at p. 321, we stated, ―The trial court properly refused\ndefendant‘s instruction that possible belief or predictions about a defendant‘s future\ndangerousness are not to be considered for any purpose because the standard jury\ninstructions do not permit ‗the jury to believe defendant‘s future dangerousness could be\nan aggravating factor.‘ ‖ An instruction such as that requested in Lucas would be\ninappropriate because the jury may consider a defendant‘s future dangerousness. To the\nextent Lucas could be read to mean a jury may not consider a defendant‘s future\ndangerousness, it is disapproved.

Asserted instructional error\n\n               a. Victim impact\n     Defendants contend the trial court erroneously refused to give a limiting instruction\nregarding the victim impact evidence. We disagree.\n     Defendants requested the court instruct the jury: ―Evidence has been introduced for\nthe purpose of showing the specific harm caused by the defendant‘s crime. Such\nevidence, if believed, was not received and may not be considered by you to divert your\nattention from your proper role of deciding whether defendant should live or die. You\nmust face this obligation soberly and rationally, and you may not impose the ultimate\nsanction as a result of an irrational, purely subjective response to emotional evidence and\nargument. On the other hand, evidence and argument on emotional though relevant\nsubjects may provide legitimate reasons to sway the jury to show mercy.‖ The trial court\ndenied the request, finding the proposed instruction was argumentative, a misstatement of\nthe law, and duplicative. We have previously concluded that a substantially similar\ninstruction was ―argumentative‖ (Hartsch, supra, 49 Cal.4th at pp. 510–511) and\n―misleading to the extent it indicates that emotions may play no part in a juror‘s decision\nto opt for the death penalty‖ (Zamudio, supra, 43 Cal.4th at p. 368). ―We have also held\nthat the standard instructions given here, including CALJIC No. 8.85, adequately convey\nto the jury the proper consideration and use of victim impact evidence.‖20 (People v.\n\n\n\n20     As we have observed, ―CALJIC now includes a standard instruction explaining the\npermissible use of victim impact evidence consistent with our case law: ‗Victim impact\nevidence has been received in this trial for the purpose of showing, if it does, the\nfinancial, emotional, psychological or physical effects of the victim‘s death on the family\nand friends of the victim[s].

We reject the claim for the same reasons stated\nabove.\n\n                d. Challenge to CALJIC No. 8.87\n     Romero contends instruction in the language of CALJIC No. 8.8721 was unfairly\none-sided, implied a unanimity requirement for mitigating evidence, and directed a\nverdict on whether the unadjudicated criminal conduct was violent. We have repeatedly\n\n21      The court instructed the Romero jury that evidence had been introduced to show\nRomero had committed ―assault, battery, robbery, attempted escape by force or violence,\nand possession of a deadly weapon in jail.‖ It then instructed the jury: ―Before a juror\nmay consider any of such criminal acts or activity as an aggravating circumstance in this\ncase, a juror must first be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant Romero\ndid in fact commit such criminal acts or activity. . . . It is not necessary for all jurors to\nagree. If any juror is convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that such criminal activity\noccurred, that juror may consider that activity as a fact in aggravation. If a juror is not so\nconvinced, that juror must not consider that evidence for any purpose.‖\n\n                                              62\n\frejected similar challenges, and do so again here.
