As a result of that interference, the Manns sustained damages, damages\n\nwhich were not controverted.\n\n                                  ARGUMENT\n\n      Issue Number One: The trial court’s finding of no damages for\n      Christopher Mann, Gwenda Mann, and Mann’s Machine, Inc. is\n      against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence. (C.R.\n      228-230; R.R. Vol. 4, p. 10) (Restated)\n                                       1\n\f      The evidence is undisputed that Robles interfered with the Manns’ easement\n\nrights. Because of that interference, the Manns sustained damages, damages which\n\nwere not controverted. The Robleses claim that the Manns did not prevail on any\n\nclaim for which they would be entitled to damages and there was insufficient\n\nevidence of those damages. But both contentions are incorrect.\n\n      There is both legally and factually sufficient evidence that the Robleses\n\ninterfered with the Manns’ property rights. Robles focuses on the timing of the\n\ninstallation of the gate, the prior temporary injunction, and the Manns’ actions\n\nregarding the gate. But the focus should be on the Robleses’ actions, as these\n\nsupport the claim for interfering with the Manns’ property rights.         And the\n\nRobleses’ actions were many: Rudis Robles denied there was an easement, he placed\n\na gate on the easement that was latched 24 hours a day, and he placed poles on the\n\neasement. (R.R. Vol. 2, pp. 29, 30-31, 35, 47-48, 52-53) And this was testimony\n\ndirectly from Mr. Robles. The Manns also testified about debris on the easement,\n\nwith utility poles, trees, and pipes. (R.R. Vol. 2, pp. 63-64, 106, 107-108) Mr.\n\nRobles disagreed with the easement and did everything he could to interfere with the\n\nManns’ use of that easement.\n\n      As a result of this interference, the Manns and their business suffered\n\ndamages.    Mr. Mann testified that they sustained losses of $120,000.00 to\n\n                                         2\n\f$130,000.00. (R.R. Vol. 2, p. 68) Customers and vendors could not get to the\n\nbusiness. (R.R. Vol. 2, p. 69, 100)\n\n      The Robleses claim that because an easement does not convey title to the\n\nproperty, there is no claim for damages to real property. But this argument misses\n\nthe mark. The Manns sued for interference with easement rights. To prevail on\n\nsuch a claim, they had to prove that the Robleses engaged in activities that interfered\n\nwith their reasonable use and enjoyment of the easement.             Brookshire Katy\n\nDrainage Dist. v. Lily Gardens, LLC, 333 S.W.3d 301, 310 (Tex. Civ. App.—\n\nHouston [1st Dist.] 2010, pet. denied).       They provided this proof.     And they\n\nprovided proof of those damages, even under the standards set forth by the Robleses.\n\nThe statement by the Robleses that the only evidence presented was Gwenda Mann’s\n\nstatement they lost business is incorrect. Both Mr. and Mrs. Mann testified to dollar\n\namounts lost because of the Robleses’ interference with their rights. (R.R. Vol. 2,\n\np. 68; R.R. Vol. 2, p. 114)\n\n      This interference caused the Manns mental anguish damages—so much so\n\nthey had to seek medical attention and were prescribed medication. (R.R. Vol. 2,\n\np. 77; R.R. Vol. 2, pp. 113-114)\n\n      Because the evidence as to the interference and the damages sustained was so\n\ncontrary to the overwhelming weight of all the evidence, this portion of the trial\n\ncourt’s judgment should be set aside and a new trial ordered as to the Manns’\n                                          3\n\fdamages.\n\n      Issue Number Two: The trial court’s award of only attorney fees\n      through trial in the amount of $4,069.98 is against the great weight\n      and preponderance of the evidence. (C.R. 228-230; R.R. Vol. 4,\n      pp. 10-11) (Restated)\n\n       The Manns incurred substantial attorney fees in obtaining the declaratory\n\njudgment signed by the trial court to enforce their easement rights. The trial court\n\nerred by limiting the recovery of attorney fees to all of the fees charged in one month\n\nto the Manns by their prior attorney.\n\n      Specifically, the trial Court stated:\n\n            I am awarding attorneys fees to Christopher Mann and Gwenda\n      Mann, the attorneys fees being in an amount testified to by Ms. Tillman\n      as being expended on this case during one month. That amount is\n      $4,069.98.\n\n(R.R. Vol. 4, pp. 10-11) But the Manns prevailed on their claim for a declaratory\n\njudgment, a claim that has been part of the relief sought by the Manns in their\n\noriginal pleading. (C.R. 10-74) Section 37.009 of the Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.\n\nCode allows the Court to award costs and reasonable attorney fees. Tom Shipp\n\ntestified as to his reasonable hourly rate of $390.00 per hour. (R.R. Vol. 3 p. 60)\n\nHe testified as to the number of hours worked. (R.R. Vol. 3 p. 64)\n\n      Attorney fees are conclusively proved when the supporting evidence is clear,\n\ndirect, positive, and without contradiction from another witness or attendant\n\ncircumstances, and such evidence could have easily been controverted. Smith v.\n                                              4\n\fPatrick W.Y. Tam Trust, 296 S.W.3d 545, 547-548 (Tex. 2009). Robles’ primary\n\ndispute with the Manns’ attorney fees is that Tom Shipp did not segregate the fees.\n\nThe general rule requires the segregation of attorney fees.       But as the Texas\n\nSupreme Court directed in Tony Gullo Motors I, L.P. v. Chapa, 212 S.W.3d 299,\n\n313-314 (Tex. 2006), when discrete legal services advance both a recoverable and\n\nunrecoverable claim they are so intertwined that they need not be segregated. And\n\nSteven Lawrence testified about the attorney fees. (R.R. Vol. 3, p. 69) He testified\n\nthat because of the common nucleus of acts, each of the causes of action are\n\ninterrelated. (R.R. Vol. 3, p. 72) He testified that the fees sought by Christopher\n\nMann, Gwenda Mann, and Mann’s Machine, Inc. were reasonable and customary.\n\n(R.R. Vol. 3, pp. 72-73) The trial court erred in disregarding this uncontradicted\n\ntestimony.\n\n      Cross-Appellants request that this Court sustain their Issue Number Two,\n\nreverse the Judgment of the trial court awarding attorney fees of $4,069.98, and\n\nremand to the trial court for a new trial as to the amount of the Cross-Appellants’\n\nattorney fees.\n\n                                 CONCLUSION\n\n       The trial court’s failure to award damages to the Manns and the trial court’s\n\naward of attorney fees limited to $4,069.98 are not supported by sufficient evidence.\n\nThe Robleses took affirmative and undisputed steps to interfere with the Manns’\n                                         5\n\feasement. And because of those steps, the Manns sustained damages. The trial\n\ncourt’s failure to award damages is not supported by sufficient evidence.\n\n      And the Manns attorney worked in excess of 200 hours, including the trial on\n\nthe merits of this case. Yet the trial court awarded damages only for one month of\n\nfees charged by a prior attorney—and awarded no fees for the actual trial. The\n\nRobleses’ only argument as to the Manns’ fees is that Tom Shipp did not segregate\n\nhis fees. But segregation is not required when the claims are so intertwined that\n\nthey need not be segregated.        Although Tom Shipp did not testify as to the\n\nintertwined nature of the claims, Steven Lawrence did.

(C.R.\n      228-230; R.R. Vol. 4, p. 10) (Restated)\n                                       1\n\f      The evidence is undisputed that Robles interfered with the Manns’ easement\n\nrights. Because of that interference, the Manns sustained damages, damages which\n\nwere not controverted. The Robleses claim that the Manns did not prevail on any\n\nclaim for which they would be entitled to damages and there was insufficient\n\nevidence of those damages. But both contentions are incorrect.\n\n      There is both legally and factually sufficient evidence that the Robleses\n\ninterfered with the Manns’ property rights. Robles focuses on the timing of the\n\ninstallation of the gate, the prior temporary injunction, and the Manns’ actions\n\nregarding the gate. But the focus should be on the Robleses’ actions, as these\n\nsupport the claim for interfering with the Manns’ property rights.         And the\n\nRobleses’ actions were many: Rudis Robles denied there was an easement, he placed\n\na gate on the easement that was latched 24 hours a day, and he placed poles on the\n\neasement. (R.R. Vol. 2, pp. 29, 30-31, 35, 47-48, 52-53) And this was testimony\n\ndirectly from Mr. Robles. The Manns also testified about debris on the easement,\n\nwith utility poles, trees, and pipes. (R.R. Vol. 2, pp. 63-64, 106, 107-108) Mr.\n\nRobles disagreed with the easement and did everything he could to interfere with the\n\nManns’ use of that easement.\n\n      As a result of this interference, the Manns and their business suffered\n\ndamages.    Mr. Mann testified that they sustained losses of $120,000.00 to\n\n                                         2\n\f$130,000.00. (R.R. Vol. 2, p. 68) Customers and vendors could not get to the\n\nbusiness. (R.R. Vol. 2, p. 69, 100)\n\n      The Robleses claim that because an easement does not convey title to the\n\nproperty, there is no claim for damages to real property. But this argument misses\n\nthe mark. The Manns sued for interference with easement rights. To prevail on\n\nsuch a claim, they had to prove that the Robleses engaged in activities that interfered\n\nwith their reasonable use and enjoyment of the easement.             Brookshire Katy\n\nDrainage Dist. v. Lily Gardens, LLC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2280620\"><a href=\"/opinion/2280620/brookshire-katy-drainage-v-lily-gardens/\"><span class=\"volume\">333</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">301</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 310 (Tex. Civ. App.—\n\nHouston [1st Dist.] 2010, pet. denied).       They provided this proof.     And they\n\nprovided proof of those damages, even under the standards set forth by the Robleses.\n\nThe statement by the Robleses that the only evidence presented was Gwenda Mann’s\n\nstatement they lost business is incorrect. Both Mr. and Mrs. Mann testified to dollar\n\namounts lost because of the Robleses’ interference with their rights. (R.R. Vol. 2,\n\np. 68; R.R. Vol. 2, p. 114)\n\n      This interference caused the Manns mental anguish damages—so much so\n\nthey had to seek medical attention and were prescribed medication. (R.R. Vol. 2,\n\np. 77; R.R. Vol. 2, pp. 113-114)\n\n      Because the evidence as to the interference and the damages sustained was so\n\ncontrary to the overwhelming weight of all the evidence, this portion of the trial\n\ncourt’s judgment should be set aside and a new trial ordered as to the Manns’\n                                          3\n\fdamages.\n\n      Issue Number Two: The trial court’s award of only attorney fees\n      through trial in the amount of $4,069.98 is against the great weight\n      and preponderance of the evidence. (C.R. 228-230; R.R. Vol. 4,\n      pp. 10-11) (Restated)\n\n       The Manns incurred substantial attorney fees in obtaining the declaratory\n\njudgment signed by the trial court to enforce their easement rights. The trial court\n\nerred by limiting the recovery of attorney fees to all of the fees charged in one month\n\nto the Manns by their prior attorney.\n\n      Specifically, the trial Court stated:\n\n            I am awarding attorneys fees to Christopher Mann and Gwenda\n      Mann, the attorneys fees being in an amount testified to by Ms. Tillman\n      as being expended on this case during one month. That amount is\n      $4,069.98.\n\n(R.R. Vol. 4, pp. 10-11) But the Manns prevailed on their claim for a declaratory\n\njudgment, a claim that has been part of the relief sought by the Manns in their\n\noriginal pleading. (C.R. 10-74) Section 37.009 of the Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.\n\nCode allows the Court to award costs and reasonable attorney fees. Tom Shipp\n\ntestified as to his reasonable hourly rate of $390.00 per hour. (R.R. Vol. 3 p. 60)\n\nHe testified as to the number of hours worked. (R.R. Vol. 3 p. 64)\n\n      Attorney fees are conclusively proved when the supporting evidence is clear,\n\ndirect, positive, and without contradiction from another witness or attendant\n\ncircumstances, and such evidence could have easily been controverted.

Vol. 3, pp. 72-73) The trial court erred in disregarding this uncontradicted\n\ntestimony.\n\n      Cross-Appellants request that this Court sustain their Issue Number Two,\n\nreverse the Judgment of the trial court awarding attorney fees of $4,069.98, and\n\nremand to the trial court for a new trial as to the amount of the Cross-Appellants’\n\nattorney fees.\n\n                                 CONCLUSION\n\n       The trial court’s failure to award damages to the Manns and the trial court’s\n\naward of attorney fees limited to $4,069.98 are not supported by sufficient evidence.\n\nThe Robleses took affirmative and undisputed steps to interfere with the Manns’\n                                         5\n\feasement. And because of those steps, the Manns sustained damages. The trial\n\ncourt’s failure to award damages is not supported by sufficient evidence.\n\n      And the Manns attorney worked in excess of 200 hours, including the trial on\n\nthe merits of this case. Yet the trial court awarded damages only for one month of\n\nfees charged by a prior attorney—and awarded no fees for the actual trial. The\n\nRobleses’ only argument as to the Manns’ fees is that Tom Shipp did not segregate\n\nhis fees. But segregation is not required when the claims are so intertwined that\n\nthey need not be segregated.        Although Tom Shipp did not testify as to the\n\nintertwined nature of the claims, Steven Lawrence did. With this evidence, the trial\n\ncourt’s award of attorney’s fees for one month’s work for the prior attorney is not\n\nsupport by sufficient evidence.\n\n                              PRAYER FOR RELIEF\n\n      Cross-Appellants request that this Court reverse the Judgment of the trial court\n\non the issue of the Cross-Appellants’ damages and attorney fees and remand this\n\ncase to the trial court for a new trial on these issues.\n\n\n\n\n                                            6\n\fRespectfully submitted,\n\nTHE SEILER LAW FIRM, PLLC\n\n   /s/ Kenna M.
