This court previously dismissed a prior appeal for lack\n\nof a final order. See Fennell v. City of Pine Bluff, 2015 Ark. App. 216. Having found that\n\nappellants have cured any deficiencies, we may now address the merits of this appeal.\n\nAppellants contend that (1) the circuit court erred when it failed to provide a basis for its\n\ndecision as required; (2) the circuit court erred by applying federal summary-judgment\n\nstandards; (3) the circuit court erred in dismissing the whistle-blower claims based on either\n\nthe lack of an adverse act, retaliatory intent, and/or an affirmative defense that the city would\n\nhave taken action against Fennell and Burnley regardless of their protected activity; (4) the\n\ncircuit court erred in dismissing appellants’ Arkansas Civil Rights Act (ACRA) free-speech\n\f                                  Cite as 2016 Ark. App. 275\n\nclaims on the grounds that there was no protected speech, adverse action, retaliatory intent\n\nor the same-decision defense, and/or qualified immunity; (5) the circuit court erred in\n\ndismissing appellants’ overtime claims based on the statute of limitations when they clearly\n\nalleged a denial of overtime as recently as 2012, suit was filed in 2011, the Arkansas Minimum\n\nWage Act (AMWA) has a three-year statute of limitations, and appellees have the burden of\n\nproving that appellants did not work when appellees failed to keep accurate records; and (6)\n\nthe circuit court erred in dismissing Burnley’s battery claim where Burnley testified that\n\nReynolds came up to him immediately after he had reported Reynolds, challenged Burnley\n\nto fight, threatened him, and repeatedly bumped Burnley’s chest without consent. We affirm\n\nin part and reverse and remand in part.\n\n       Fennell initially filed a complaint against the City of Pine Bluff on July 11, 2011. After\n\nsubsequent amended complaints, Fennell and Burnley filed a fourth amended complaint\n\nagainst the City of Pine Bluff, Reynolds, and Kenneth Blackwell, in his individual and official\n\ncapacities,1 on August 27, 2013. Appellees filed an answer to the fourth amended complaint\n\non September 16, 2013, and a motion for summary judgment on December 16, 2013, arguing\n\nthat the fourth amended complaint should be dismissed. Appellants subsequently filed a\n\nresponse to the motion for summary judgment on January 28, 2014, and appellees filed a reply\n\non February 13, 2014.2\n\n\n       1\n           Blackwell was dismissed as an unserved defendant and is not a party to this appeal.\n       2\n        Appellants’ fourth amended complaint and appellees’ motion for summary judgment\naddressed numerous claims that are not at issue in this appeal. Additionally, appellants\nexpressly abandoned several claims and arguments in their reply brief, including “(1) the hate\n\n                                               2\n\f                                 Cite as 2016 Ark. App. 275\n\n       Several exhibits were submitted to the circuit court, including deposition excerpts,\n\ncopies of payroll records, copies of time cards, memorandums, and affidavits. Based on the\n\nfacts contained in the exhibits, appellees alleged that they were entitled to summary judgment\n\nbecause the relevant facts were undisputed. Fennell began working for the City of Pine Bluff\n\nin 1999 driving buses, doing customer service, and servicing buses. Burnley was hired in 2006\n\nand would fuel buses, check fluids, and assist the mechanic. During their employment, they\n\nwere supervised by the operations manager; Revawn Johnson, Quintavious Brown, and\n\nKenneth Blackwell served in that order as operations manager. The operations manager\n\nreported to the transit director. Reynolds served as the transit director from 1999 to 2013 and\n\nwas replaced by Charlina Lacy in July 2013.\n\n       In Fennell’s deposition testimony and affidavit, she testified that she had observed\n\nReynolds stealing gasoline and that she had made a report to Ted David, the mayor’s assistant.\n\nHowever, she was unable to recall when she made this report or even the year in which she\n\nmade the report. Despite the fact that she could not recall when she reported the gasoline\n\ntheft, she alleged that she was denied the opportunity to work overtime hours driving a bus\n\nas a result of her report. Additionally, she stated that she was denied a promotion because\n\nBrown had told her that he would promote her to his position if Reynolds was fired and he\n\nwas promoted to serve as transit director. However, Brown subsequently resigned from his\n\n\ncrimes claim; (2) the issue of willfulness so that a three year statute of limitations could be\napplied on the FLSA claims; [and] (3) the issue of official capacity liability on the free speech\nretaliation claims.” Instead, appellants specifically stated that only their “(1) AMWA claims;\n(2) battery claims; (3) whistle-blower claims; [and] (4) ACRA claims for retaliation” should\nbe set for trial. As such, this opinion is limited to discussing these claims and issues.\n\n                                               3\n\f                                 Cite as 2016 Ark. App. 275\n\nposition, and Blackwell was hired to replace him. At some point, Fennell and Burnley were\n\naccused of stealing money. However, neither employee was disciplined because Reynolds\n\ndetermined that the allegations were false. Fennell further complained that Blackwell would\n\nyell at her to “get to work,” that she was suspended for insubordination in July 2013 by\n\nBlackwell, and that she was terminated in August 2013.\n\n       Burnley testified that he was not paid for all of his work, that he had reported to\n\nJohnson in 2008 that Reynolds had stolen gasoline, that Reynolds had bumped his chest\n\nduring an argument regarding not receiving all of his pay, that he was falsely accused of theft\n\nbut was not disciplined after Reynolds had determined that the allegations were false, and that\n\nhe generally was subjected to a “hostile work environment.” However, Burnley testified that\n\nthis hostile environment started in 2007.\n\n       Reynolds denied the allegations made against him. Furthermore, Lacy testified that\n\nFennell was suspended for insubordination after Fennell had a meeting with her and\n\nBlackwell. During that meeting, she stated that Fennell “lashed out” at Blackwell and\n\nbehaved in a manner that she believed was insubordinate. Additionally, she testified that\n\nFennell’s termination was the result of budget cuts in 2013. Lacy was told in an email that\n\nthere were two budget cuts in 2013. Mayor Debbie Hollingsworth confirmed that she had\n\nrequired and approved the budget reduction.\n\n       A disciplinary-action form documenting the incident that resulted in Fennell’s\n\nsuspension was submitted as an exhibit. The form documented that Fennell had violated Pine\n\nBluff Transit’s policy when she called a coworker to work in her place instead of calling her\n\n\n                                              4\n\f                                  Cite as 2016 Ark. App. 275\n\nsupervisor and that she was insubordinate to Blackwell in a meeting in the director’s office\n\nregarding this violation. Additionally, a letter dated August 12, 2013, and signed by Lacy,\n\nstated that Fennell’s position had been “written out of the Pine Bluff Transit Budget.”\n\n       After a hearing on the motion for summary judgment on May 2, 2014, the circuit\n\ncourt filed the following order on June 9, 2014:\n\n               The Court has considered the Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment that\n       was filed after the Plaintiffs’ Fourth Amended Complaint. The Court has considered\n       the Response filed by Plaintiffs; and, Reply filed thereto by the Defendants, and finds\n       that the Motion for Summary Judgment shall be granted in its entirety. Because the\n       Motion for Summary Judgment is granted, the Plaintiffs’ Fourth Amended Complaint\n       is dismissed with prejudice.\n\nAfter the circuit court subsequently denied appellants’ motion to vacate and motion to alter\n\nor amend, this appeal followed.\n\n       Summary judgment may be granted only when there are no genuine issues of material\n\nfact to be litigated. Greenlee v. J.B. Hunt Transp. Servs., 2009 Ark. 506, 342 S.W.3d 274.\n\nOnce the moving party has established a prima facie entitlement to summary judgment, the\n\nopposing party must meet proof with proof and demonstrate the existence of a material issue\n\nof fact. Id. On appellate review, this court determines if summary judgment was appropriate\n\nbased on whether the evidentiary items presented by the moving party in support of the\n\nmotion leave a material fact unanswered. Id. We view the evidence in the light most\n\nfavorable to the party against whom the motion was filed, resolving all doubts and inferences\n\nagainst the moving party. Id. Our review focuses not only on the pleadings, but also on the\n\naffidavits and other documents filed by the parties. Id.\n\n       In appellants’ first point on appeal, they argue that the circuit court erred when it failed\n\n                                                5\n\f                                  Cite as 2016 Ark. App. 275\n\nto provide a basis for its decision as required. Specifically, they argue that the circuit court\n\nwas required to make specific findings in its order granting summary judgment, citing Brodie\n\nv. City of Jonesboro and Johnson v. Windstream Communications, Inc., as authority. See Brodie v.\n\nCity of Jonesboro, 2012 Ark. 5; Johnson v. Windstream Commc’ns, Inc., 2012 Ark. App. 590\n\n(Johnson I).\n\n       Appellees correctly note that as a general rule, circuit courts are not required to make\n\nspecific findings when granting motions for summary judgment. See Hardin v. Bishop, 2013\n\nArk. 395, 430 S.W.3d 49; Ark. R. Civ. P. 52(a) (2015). However, our supreme court has\n\nestablished a pertinent exception to this general rule in cases involving ACRA claims. See\n\nBrodie, supra. Therefore, although the circuit court did not err in not making specific findings\n\nin granting summary judgment regarding all claims alleged by appellants, we find that the\n\ncircuit court did err in part by failing to make specific findings as our supreme court has now\n\nrequired under Brodie.\n\n       Appellants alleged in their fourth amended complaint employment-related retaliation\n\nclaims pursuant to Arkansas Code Annotated section 16-123-108 (Supp. 2011) of ACRA.3\n\nThis court has applied the three-stage, burden-shifting standard set forth in McDonnell Douglas\n\nCorp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973) in analyzing these types of claims. Eusanio v. Tippin,\n\n2013 Ark. App. 38, 425 S.W.3d 838. As our supreme court explained in Brodie, 2012 Ark.\n\n5, the plaintiff bears the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination. Id.\n\n\n       3\n         Although appellants had also alleged in their fourth amended complaint claims\npursuant to Arkansas Code Annotated section 16-123-106 (Supp. 2011) of ACRA, appellants\nexpressly abandoned these claims in their reply brief.\n\n                                                6\n\f                                 Cite as 2016 Ark. App. 275\n\nOnce a prima facie case is established, a rebuttable presumption shifts the burden to the\n\ndefendant to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for his or her action. Eusanio,\n\nsupra. If the defendant articulates such a reason, the presumption disappears, and the plaintiff\n\nbears the burden of proving that the defendant’s proffered reason is merely a pretext for\n\ndiscrimination. Brodie, supra.\n\n       Our supreme court has additionally made it clear that, even in summary-judgment\n\ncases, the circuit court must evaluate these types of claims using the McDonnell Douglas\n\nframework and that it must explain its findings. See Brodie, supra. As in Brodie and Johnson I,\n\nwe cannot conclude that the circuit court properly evaluated this case under McDonnell\n\nDouglas. There is no mention in the circuit court’s order about a prima facie case of\n\ndiscrimination, a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for appellees’ actions, or pretext for\n\ndiscrimination. See Brodie, supra; Alexander v. E. Tank Servs., Inc., 2016 Ark. App. 185, ___\n\nS.W.3d ___; Johnson I, supra; Johnson v. Windstream Commc’ns, Inc., 2014 Ark. App. 99\n\n(Johnson II). Accordingly, we must reverse and remand this case in part to the circuit court\n\nto explain its ruling on each remaining ACRA claim. Johnson I, supra. As we further\n\nexplained in Johnson II, the circuit court must use the McDonnell Douglas framework in\n\nreviewing appellees’ motion for summary judgment regarding appellants’ remaining ACRA\n\nclaims and include its analysis in its summary-judgment order. Implicit in these directions is\n\nthe possibility that the circuit court might determine after its analysis that the claims are not\n\nappropriate for summary judgment. See Johnson II, supra.\n\n       In appellants’ second point on appeal, they argue that the circuit court erred by\n\n\n                                               7\n\f                                  Cite as 2016 Ark. App. 275\n\napplying federal summary-judgment standards. This argument is without merit. As appellants\n\nindicated in their first point on appeal, the circuit court made no specific findings in its order\n\ngranting summary judgment, and there is no indication in the record that the circuit court\n\napplied improper summary-judgment standards.\n\n       In appellants’ third point on appeal, they argue that the circuit court erred in dismissing\n\nthe claims alleged under the Arkansas Whistle-Blower Act (AWBA), Arkansas Code\n\nAnnotated sections 21-1-601 to -609 (Repl. 2004 & Supp. 2013). Under the AWBA, a\n\npublic employee who reports violations of law or waste of public funds to the appropriate\n\nauthorities is afforded protection under the Act. See Ark. Code Ann. § 21-1-602(8). A public\n\nemployer is prohibited from taking adverse action against a public employee for a\n\ncommunication that falls within the protection of this subchapter. See Ark. Code Ann. § 21-\n\n1-603(a)(1). Pursuant to section 21-1-602(1), an “adverse action” means to discharge,\n\nthreaten, or otherwise discriminate or retaliate against a public employee in any manner that\n\naffects the employee’s employment, including compensation. A whistle-blower who is\n\npunished by a public employer may seek actual damages and injunctive relief. See Ark. Code\n\nAnn. § 21-1-604(a). However, “[a] public employer shall have an affirmative defense to a\n\ncivil action brought by a public employee under this subchapter if the adverse action taken\n\nagainst a public employee was due to employee misconduct [or] poor job performance . . .\n\nunrelated to a communication made pursuant to § 21-1-603.” See Ark. Code Ann. § 21-1-\n\n604(e)(1). In order for appellants to prevail on their claims under the AWBA, they were\n\nrequired to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that they suffered an adverse action\n\n\n                                                8\n\f                                Cite as 2016 Ark. App. 275\n\nbecause they engaged or intended to engage in an activity protected under the AWBA and\n\nthat such action was unrelated to their own misconduct or poor job performance. Barrows v.\n\nCity of Fort Smith, 2010 Ark. 73, 360 S.W.3d 117; Hollis v. Fayetteville Sch. Dist. No. 1 of\n\nWashington Cty., 2015 Ark. App. 544, 473 S.W.3d 45. The burden was on appellees to\n\nestablish their affirmative defense of employee misconduct unrelated to the communications\n\nby a preponderance of the evidence. Ark. Code Ann. § 21-1-604(e)(2).\n\n       On appeal, appellants allege that the circuit court erred in dismissing Fennell’s and\n\nBurnley’s whistle-blower claims because\n\n       Burnley and Fennell have both given sworn testimony that their working hours were\n       cut, reducing their pay. In Burnley’s case, he was not paid for time worked, and\n       overtime worked. Fennell was denied a promotion, and therefore more pay. Finally,\n       Fennell was suspended and then fired. . . . Burnley and Fennell were also subjected to\n       a hostile work environment, including threats to their compensation, jobs, and person,\n       closer supervision, being yelled at regularly, being segregated from other employees,\n       and battered in Burnley’s case.\n\nHowever, appellants’ arguments are without merit. Fennell failed to provide any proof that\n\nthe alleged adverse actions were the result of her reporting Reynolds. In fact, she was unable\n\nto recall when she even made the alleged report. Arguably, she would have had to have made\n\nthe report sometime prior to 2011, when she instituted this lawsuit, but her suspension and\n\ntermination did not occur until 2013. Additionally, she did not even allege that she had\n\napplied for Blackwell’s position and was denied the promotion. Instead, she alleged that\n\nBrown had told her that he would promote her if he was promoted. However, it is\n\nundisputed that Brown resigned from his position. Furthermore, Fennell failed to submit any\n\nproof that she was entitled to receive overtime hours. Finally, appellees submitted evidence\n\n\n                                              9\n\f                                 Cite as 2016 Ark. App. 275\n\nthat Fennell was suspended and terminated as a result of insubordination and budget cuts,\n\nrespectively. For all of these reasons, the circuit court did not err in dismissing Fennell’s\n\nwhistle-blower claims.\n\n       For similar reasons, the circuit court did not err in dismissing Burnley’s whistle-blower\n\nclaims. Although Burnley testified that he reported Reynolds’s theft in 2008, he further\n\ntestified that his problems at work started in 2007. Therefore, Burnley failed to provide any\n\nproof that the alleged adverse actions were the result of the report. Consequently, there were\n\nno genuine issues of material fact left unresolved, and appellees were entitled to summary\n\njudgment as a matter of law. Accordingly, we affirm on this point on appeal.\n\n       In appellants’ fourth point on appeal, they argue that the circuit court erred in\n\ndismissing appellants’ employment-related retaliation claims pursuant to Arkansas Code\n\nAnnotated section 16-123-108 of ACRA. Because we are required to reverse and remand\n\nfor further findings as we explained in addressing appellants’ first point on appeal, it is\n\npremature for this court to address the merits of appellants’ arguments regarding their\n\nemployment-related retaliation claims at this time.\n\n       In appellants’ fifth point on appeal, they argue that the circuit court erred in dismissing\n\nappellants’ overtime claims filed pursuant to the AMWA based on the fact that they were\n\nbarred by the statute of limitations. However, when a circuit court bases its decision on more\n\nthan one independent ground and the appellant challenges fewer than all those grounds on\n\nappeal, we will affirm without addressing any of the grounds. Evangelical Lutheran Good\n\nSamaritan Soc’y v. Kolesar, 2014 Ark. 279; Patel v. Patel, 2015 Ark. App. 726, 479 S.W.3d 580.\n\n\n                                               10\n\f                                 Cite as 2016 Ark. App. 275\n\nHere, the circuit court granted the motion for summary judgment in its entirety, and appellees\n\nspecifically argued in their motion for summary judgment that appellants’ AMWA claims\n\nshould be dismissed because the City’s payroll records indicated that appellants were\n\ncompensated for all the time they worked. Therefore, because appellants failed to challenge\n\nthis ground on appeal and only argue that the circuit court erred in granting summary\n\njudgment based on an independent ground regarding statute of limitations, we must\n\nsummarily affirm without addressing the merits.\n\n       In appellants’ final point on appeal, they argue that the circuit court erred in dismissing\n\nBurnley’s battery claim. In their initial brief, appellants’ discussion of this point consists of\n\nonly four sentences, not including the heading, and a reference to Arkansas Model Jury\n\nInstruction 417 without any further explanation or citation to authority. Appellants failed to\n\naddress the specific arguments that were made by appellees to the circuit court and in their\n\nmotion for summary judgment. Appellees had contended that any battery claim was not\n\nfactually supported as required by Costner v. Adams, 82 Ark. App. 148, 121 S.W.3d 164\n\n(2003).\n\n       We have repeatedly held that we will not consider an argument if the appellant does\n\nnot make a convincing argument or cite authority to support it. Orintas v. Point Lookout Prop.\n\nOwners Ass’n Bd. of Dirs., 2015 Ark. App. 648, 476 S.W.3d 174. It is not the duty of this\n\ncourt to research or develop arguments for an appellant on appeal, and the failure to develop\n\na point legally or factually is reason enough to affirm the circuit court.

Fennell began working for the City of Pine Bluff\n\nin 1999 driving buses, doing customer service, and servicing buses. Burnley was hired in 2006\n\nand would fuel buses, check fluids, and assist the mechanic. During their employment, they\n\nwere supervised by the operations manager; Revawn Johnson, Quintavious Brown, and\n\nKenneth Blackwell served in that order as operations manager. The operations manager\n\nreported to the transit director. Reynolds served as the transit director from 1999 to 2013 and\n\nwas replaced by Charlina Lacy in July 2013.\n\n       In Fennell’s deposition testimony and affidavit, she testified that she had observed\n\nReynolds stealing gasoline and that she had made a report to Ted David, the mayor’s assistant.\n\nHowever, she was unable to recall when she made this report or even the year in which she\n\nmade the report. Despite the fact that she could not recall when she reported the gasoline\n\ntheft, she alleged that she was denied the opportunity to work overtime hours driving a bus\n\nas a result of her report.

Fennell further complained that Blackwell would\n\nyell at her to “get to work,” that she was suspended for insubordination in July 2013 by\n\nBlackwell, and that she was terminated in August 2013.\n\n       Burnley testified that he was not paid for all of his work, that he had reported to\n\nJohnson in 2008 that Reynolds had stolen gasoline, that Reynolds had bumped his chest\n\nduring an argument regarding not receiving all of his pay, that he was falsely accused of theft\n\nbut was not disciplined after Reynolds had determined that the allegations were false, and that\n\nhe generally was subjected to a “hostile work environment.” However, Burnley testified that\n\nthis hostile environment started in 2007.\n\n       Reynolds denied the allegations made against him. Furthermore, Lacy testified that\n\nFennell was suspended for insubordination after Fennell had a meeting with her and\n\nBlackwell. During that meeting, she stated that Fennell “lashed out” at Blackwell and\n\nbehaved in a manner that she believed was insubordinate. Additionally, she testified that\n\nFennell’s termination was the result of budget cuts in 2013. Lacy was told in an email that\n\nthere were two budget cuts in 2013. Mayor Debbie Hollingsworth confirmed that she had\n\nrequired and approved the budget reduction.\n\n       A disciplinary-action form documenting the incident that resulted in Fennell’s\n\nsuspension was submitted as an exhibit.

The Court has considered\n       the Response filed by Plaintiffs; and, Reply filed thereto by the Defendants, and finds\n       that the Motion for Summary Judgment shall be granted in its entirety. Because the\n       Motion for Summary Judgment is granted, the Plaintiffs’ Fourth Amended Complaint\n       is dismissed with prejudice.\n\nAfter the circuit court subsequently denied appellants’ motion to vacate and motion to alter\n\nor amend, this appeal followed.\n\n       Summary judgment may be granted only when there are no genuine issues of material\n\nfact to be litigated.

Under the AWBA, a\n\npublic employee who reports violations of law or waste of public funds to the appropriate\n\nauthorities is afforded protection under the Act. See Ark. Code Ann. § 21-1-602(8). A public\n\nemployer is prohibited from taking adverse action against a public employee for a\n\ncommunication that falls within the protection of this subchapter. See Ark. Code Ann. § 21-\n\n1-603(a)(1). Pursuant to section 21-1-602(1), an “adverse action” means to discharge,\n\nthreaten, or otherwise discriminate or retaliate against a public employee in any manner that\n\naffects the employee’s employment, including compensation. A whistle-blower who is\n\npunished by a public employer may seek actual damages and injunctive relief. See Ark. Code\n\nAnn. § 21-1-604(a). However, “[a] public employer shall have an affirmative defense to a\n\ncivil action brought by a public employee under this subchapter if the adverse action taken\n\nagainst a public employee was due to employee misconduct [or] poor job performance . . .\n\nunrelated to a communication made pursuant to § 21-1-603.” See Ark.

Although Burnley testified that he reported Reynolds’s theft in 2008, he further\n\ntestified that his problems at work started in 2007. Therefore, Burnley failed to provide any\n\nproof that the alleged adverse actions were the result of the report. Consequently, there were\n\nno genuine issues of material fact left unresolved, and appellees were entitled to summary\n\njudgment as a matter of law. Accordingly, we affirm on this point on appeal.\n\n       In appellants’ fourth point on appeal, they argue that the circuit court erred in\n\ndismissing appellants’ employment-related retaliation claims pursuant to Arkansas Code\n\nAnnotated section 16-123-108 of ACRA. Because we are required to reverse and remand\n\nfor further findings as we explained in addressing appellants’ first point on appeal, it is\n\npremature for this court to address the merits of appellants’ arguments regarding their\n\nemployment-related retaliation claims at this time.\n\n       In appellants’ fifth point on appeal, they argue that the circuit court erred in dismissing\n\nappellants’ overtime claims filed pursuant to the AMWA based on the fact that they were\n\nbarred by the statute of limitations. However, when a circuit court bases its decision on more\n\nthan one independent ground and the appellant challenges fewer than all those grounds on\n\nappeal, we will affirm without addressing any of the grounds.

Therefore, because appellants failed to challenge\n\nthis ground on appeal and only argue that the circuit court erred in granting summary\n\njudgment based on an independent ground regarding statute of limitations, we must\n\nsummarily affirm without addressing the merits.\n\n       In appellants’ final point on appeal, they argue that the circuit court erred in dismissing\n\nBurnley’s battery claim. In their initial brief, appellants’ discussion of this point consists of\n\nonly four sentences, not including the heading, and a reference to Arkansas Model Jury\n\nInstruction 417 without any further explanation or citation to authority. Appellants failed to\n\naddress the specific arguments that were made by appellees to the circuit court and in their\n\nmotion for summary judgment.
