Hoye appeals the district court’s order granting the Appellees’ motion\n\nto dismiss and dismissing for failure to state a claim Hoye’s 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (2012)\n\ncomplaint alleging retaliation in violation of the First Amendment. He contends that the\n\ndistrict court erred in relying on Adams v. Rice, 40 F.3d 72 (4th Cir. 1996), and that his\n\nallegations of adversity were sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss. We affirm.\n\n      We review de novo a district court’s dismissal of an action under Federal Rule of\n\nCivil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim. Trejo v. Ryman Hosp. Props., Inc.,\n\n795 F.3d 442, 445-46 (4th Cir. 2015). “To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must\n\ncontain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is\n\nplausible on its face.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted). Although we must “draw[] all reasonable inferences in favor of the\n\nplaintiff,” Elyazidi v. SunTrust Bank, 780 F.3d 227, 233 (4th Cir. 2015) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted), a pleading that offers only “labels and conclusions” or “a\n\nformulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do,” Bell Atl. Corp. v.\n\nTwombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007). “Nor does a complaint suffice if it tenders naked\n\nassertions devoid of further factual enhancement.” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (alteration and\n\ninternal quotations marks omitted).\n\n      To state a First Amendment retaliation claim, a plaintiff must show that (1) his\n\nspeech was protected, (2) the alleged retaliatory action adversely affected his protected\n\nspeech, and (3) a causal relationship existed between the protected speech and the\n\nretaliation. Raub v. Campbell, 785 F.3d 876, 885 (4th Cir. 2015). Claims of retaliation\n\n                                            3\n\fby prisoners must “be regarded with skepticism, lest federal courts embroil themselves in\n\nevery disciplinary act that occurs in state penal institutions.” Adams v. Rice, 40 F.3d 72,\n\n74 (4th Cir. 1994).\n\n       “[F]or purposes of a First Amendment retaliation claim under § 1983, a plaintiff\n\nsuffers adverse action if the defendant’s allegedly retaliatory conduct would likely deter a\n\nperson of ordinary firmness from the exercise of First Amendment rights.” Constantine\n\nv. Rectors & Visitors of George Mason Univ., 411 F.3d 474, 500 (4th Cir. 2005) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).\n\n       Distinguishing Adams, we recently held that prisoners have a constitutional right\n\nto file prison grievances free from retaliation. Booker v. S.C. Dep’t of Corr., 855 F.3d\n\n533, 545 (4th Cir. 2017). Thus, Hoye has shown that his filing of prison grievances was\n\na protected activity.\n\n       We conclude, however, that Hoye has not shown an adverse action. Hoye alleges\n\nthat as a result of his transfer, he is now located in a prison farther away from his family,\n\nmaking it “practically impossible” for his family to visit him. (J.A. 24). But Deep\n\nMeadow Correctional Center (DMCC) is a prison on the same security level as\n\nCoffeewood Correctional Center (CWCC), is located in the same zone as CWCC, and is\n\nonly about an hour farther away from his family than CWCC. Traveling an extra hour to\n\nthe prison—two hours roundtrip—does not make it “practically impossible” for Hoye’s\n\nfamily to visit him, nor, we conclude, would such a transfer deter a person of ordinary\n\nfirmness from filing prison grievances, see Constantine, 411 F.3d at 500.            Indeed,\n\n“[s]ince prisoners are expected to endure more than the average citizen, and since\n\n                                             4\n\ftransfers are common among prisons, ordinarily a transfer would not deter a prisoner of\n\nordinary firmness from continuing to engage in protected conduct.”            Siggers-El v.\n\nBarlow, 412 F.3d 693, 701 (6th Cir. 2005).           Ultimately, the transfer “may have\n\ninconvenienced” Hoye, “but it did not chill, impair, or deny [his] exercise of First\n\nAmendment rights.” Am. Civil Liberties Union of Md., Inc. v. Wicomico Cty., 999 F.2d\n\n780, 786 (4th Cir. 1993).\n\n         Hoye’s situation is quite unlike the situations in the cases that Hoye cites for\n\nsupport.    In Pasley v. Conerly, the Sixth Circuit ruled that threatening to transfer\n\nsomebody from a prison outside of Detroit to a place “so far up North that your family\n\nwon’t recognize you when you get back” constituted an adverse action. 345 F. App’x\n\n981, 983, 985 (6th Cir. 2009) (No. 08-2132) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nSimilarly, the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that reclassifying a prisoner as a “special\n\noffender” and transferring him from Pennsylvania to Florida, over a thousand miles away\n\nfrom his sick parents, constituted an adverse action. Toolasprashad v. Bureau of Prisons,\n\n286 F.3d 576, 580, 585 (D.C. Cir. 2002). Hoye, in contrast, was transferred only 70\n\nmiles away. Moreover, Hoye was not transferred to “a more dangerous section” of a\n\nprison, see Morris v. Powell, 449 F.3d 682, 687 (5th Cir. 2006), nor was he placed in\n\nsegregated housing or in a lock-down unit, see Hill v. Lappin, 630 F.3d 468, 474 (6th Cir.\n\n2010).\n\n         Finally, although Hoye alleges that he is now rarely able to call his children “due\n\nto the increased cost of long-distance phone service from DMCC” (J.A. 24), Hoye does\n\nnot explain how much more money it costs to call his family now when compared to the\n\n                                              5\n\fcost while he was incarcerated at CWCC. Without anything more, we conclude an\n\nunspecified increase in the cost of telephone calls would not deter a person of ordinary\n\nfirmness from filing prison grievances. See Constantine, 411 F.3d at 500. Thus, we\n\nconclude that the district court did not err in dismissing Hoye’s complaint.\n\n       Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral\n\nargument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the\n\nmaterials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.\n\n                                                                               AFFIRMED\n\n\n\n\n                                             6\n\f",

Without anything more, we conclude an\n\nunspecified increase in the cost of telephone calls would not deter a person of ordinary\n\nfirmness from filing prison grievances. See Constantine, 411 F.3d at 500. Thus, we\n\nconclude that the district court did not err in dismissing Hoye’s complaint.\n\n       Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral\n\nargument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the\n\nmaterials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.\n\n                                                                               AFFIRMED\n\n\n\n\n                                             6\n\f</pre>",
