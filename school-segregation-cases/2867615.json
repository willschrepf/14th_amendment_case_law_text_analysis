The criminal charges against\nHomar were eventually dismissed, but Homar was nonetheless\nsubsequently demoted to the position of groundskeeper. Homar filed\nsuit in federal district court seeking reinstatement, backpay and\ndamages for violations of his due process rights. The district\ncourt entered summary judgment in favor of defendants. Plaintiff\nappeals.\n     Although we conclude that these circumstances warranted and\njustified an immediate suspension of employment without a hearing,\nthe added suspension of pay necessitated a hearing. Furthermore,\nthe subsequent restoration of that pay cannot serve to cure the due\nprocess violation. It may serve to reduce the damages to which the\nemployee may be entitled, but the deprivation must be viewed at the\ntime of its occurrence, not as belatedly corrected by later action;\notherwise employers could violate the due process rights of their\nemployees and simply cure those violations through the means of\nretroactive pay.\n     We also hold that once suspended, an employee is entitled to\na hearing before any further action is taken to demote, terminate,\nor extend his suspension. At such a hearing, the employee is\nentitled to know the evidence against him and be afforded the\nopportunity for a meaningful response. We conclude that there is\na genuine issue of material fact as to whether such a hearing was\nafforded here, and we thus reverse the order of summary judgment.\n\n                                I.\n     Plaintiff Richard Homar was employed as a police officer at\nEast Stroudsburg University (\"ESU\"). On August 26, 1992, Homar was\narrested when a drug raid took place at the home of his friend,\nJames Crompton, whom he was visiting. That same day, the\nPennsylvania State Police filed a criminal complaint against Homar\ncharging him with possession of marijuana, possession with intent\nto deliver and criminal conspiracy.\n     The state police called David Marazas, ESU's police chief and\nHomar's supervisor, to inform him of Homar's arrest and the charges\nagainst him. Marazas then informed Gerald Levanowitz, ESU's\nDirector of Human Resources, to whom ESU President James Gilbert\n\fhad delegated authority to discipline and suspend ESU employees.\nLevanowitz decided immediately to suspend Homar without pay. No\npre-suspension hearing was held.\n     On August 27, Homar received a letter from Levanowitz advising\nhim that he was suspended without pay pending further investigation\nand disposition of the criminal charges. The letter advised Homar\nthat any administrative action taken by the University against him\n\"[did] not have to coincide with the disposition of those charges\nthrough the legal process.\" Appendix (\"App.\") at 197.\n     District Justice Charles P. Eyer dismissed all criminal\ncharges against Homar on September 1, 1992. Levanowitz still\nrefused to lift Homar's suspension.\n     On September 11, 1992, Levanowitz, along with two ESU police\nsergeants who were assigned to conduct an investigation on Homar,\nmet with two state troopers and a Corporal to discuss Homar's\nsituation. App. at 143. One of the troopers was the state trooper\nwho signed the criminal complaint against Homar. At this meeting,\nLevanowitz was provided with a copy of a page from the Pennsylvania\nState Police investigative file regarding Homar, called the\n\"Supplemental Report.\" This report includes statements attributed\nto Homar that he allegedly made to the Pennsylvania State Police\nwhen he was interviewed shortly after his arrest. According to the\nSupplemental Report, Homar admitted his knowledge of drug dealing\nby Crompton and another man named Habhab, and Homar further\nadmitted that he had received marijuana from Habhab for his own use\nwhile he was employed as an ESU police officer. Homar contests\nthat he ever made these statements.\n     On September 15, 1992, Levanowitz called Homar and arranged\nfor a meeting three days later. Levanowitz explained that this\nmeeting would be an \"administrative hearing,\" and that accordingly\nHomar had a right to have his union representative present but that\nhe did not have a right to legal counsel.\n     Homar attended this meeting on September 18, 1992, along with\nhis union representative. Besides Levanowitz, Marazas was also\npresent, as well as Levanowitz's secretary. At the start of the\nmeeting, Homar's union representative requested that Homar's\nattorney be present. Levanowitz responded that if Homar so chose,\nthey would have to postpone the meeting until a later time. Homar\nopted to proceed with the meeting unrepresented. According to the\nnotes taken by Levanowitz's secretary, Levanowitz made the\nfollowing statement to Homar:\n     The purpose of this meeting today is to give you an\n     opportunity to provide any information on your own behalf\n     that would assist us in making a determination concerning\n     the action that would end your suspension and any\n     information that would be of help to you in presenting\n     your case.\nApp. at 205.\n     Levanowitz maintained at a deposition held later that he had\ntold Homar that \"the State Police had given [him] some evidence\nvery serious in nature,\" App. at 164, and that he offered Homar the\nopportunity to present his side of the story. Levanowitz never\ninformed Homar that he had received the Supplemental Report from\nthe state police containing his alleged confession.\n\f     On September 23, 1992, Levanowitz wrote a letter to Homar\nadvising him that he was being demoted from the position of police\nofficer to the position of groundskeeper. The text of the letter\nreads, in pertinent part, as follows:\n          This is to inform you that you are to be demoted\n     from your position as a Police Officer I in the Campus\n     Police Department to the position of Groundskeeper. . .\n     . The action is effective retroactive to August 26, 1992,\n     and you are to be given back pay to that date at the rate\n     of pay for a Groundskeeper. You are to report to work at\n     7:00 A.M. on September 24, 1992 at the Facilities\n     Management Office. Your new rate of pay as Groundskeeper\n     will be $552.80 bi-weekly.\n\n          This action is being taken as a result of admissions\n     made by yourself to the Pennsylvania State Police on\n     August 26, 1992 that you maintained association with\n     individuals whom you knew were dealing in large\n     quantities of marijuana and you obtained marijuana from\n     one of those individuals for your own use. Your actions\n     constitute a clear and flagrant violation of Sections 200\n     and 200.2 of the East Stroudsburg University Police\n     Department Manual.\nApp. at 208 (footnote added).\n     After this letter was issued, the president of the union\nrepresenting Homar requested that Homar have an opportunity to meet\nwith President Gilbert regarding the letter. The meeting occurred\non September 24, 1992 at 2:00 p.m. By this time, Homar had\nreceived and read a copy of the Supplemental Report. Gilbert\nprovided Homar with an opportunity to respond to the charges and to\nLevanowitz's decision. Gilbert nonetheless sustained the\nsuspension.\n     After failing to obtain relief through his union grievance\nprocedure, Homar filed a complaint in the district court for the\nMiddle District of Pennsylvania against Gilbert, Levanowitz and\nMarazas. His complaint alleges that the procedures by which he was\nsuspended and then demoted lacked required due process, that\ndefendants' actions deprived him of liberty and property, and that\nhis substantive due process rights were also violated. The\ndistrict court entered summary judgment in favor of the defendants\non March 17, 1995. Homar then appealed to this court.\n\n                               II.\n     The district court had jurisdiction over this action pursuant\nto 28 U.S.C.    1331 and 1343 and 42 U.S.C.   1983. This court has\njurisdiction over the appeal of the district court's final decision\nunder 28 U.S.C.   1291.\n     Our review of the district court's order for summary judgment\nis plenary, and we thus apply the same standards that were\napplicable in the district court. J.F. Feeser, Inc. v. Serv-A-\nPortion, Inc., 909 F.2d 1524, 1530 (3d Cir., 1990), cert. denied,\n499 U.S. 921 (1991). Summary judgment is appropriately granted\nwhen \"there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the\nmoving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.\n\fR. Civ. P. 56(c). If, however, \"the evidence is such that a\nreasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party,\"\nAnderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986), summary\njudgment shall not be granted. Homar, as the nonmoving party, is\nentitled to have all reasonable inferences drawn in his favor. SeeJ.F.\nFeeser, 909 F.2d at 1531.\n\n                               III.\n     Homar's first claim is that ESU failed to provide him a\nmeaningful pre-deprivation hearing prior to his suspension without\npay and his subsequent demotion from police officer to\ngroundskeeper.\n     In Cleveland Bd. of Education v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532\n(1985), the United States Supreme Court held that when a public\nemployee has a property interest in his or her employment he or she\nis entitled to a meaningful pre-termination hearing. Such a\nhearing need not be elaborate, but rather \"an initial check against\nmistaken decision -- essentially, a determination of whether there\nare reasonable grounds to believe that the charges against the\nemployee are true and support the proposed action.\" Id. at 545-46.\nLoudermill specifically requires that prior to termination:\n     [a] tenured public employee is entitled to oral or\n     written notice of the charges against him, an explanation\n     of the employer's evidence, and an opportunity to present\n     his side of the story.\nId. at 546.\n     The Supreme Court has made it eminently clear that due process\nentitles a party to such a hearing \"before he [or she] is deprived\nof any significant property interest, except for extraordinary\nsituations where some valid governmental interest is at stake that\njustifies postponing the hearing until after the event.\" Boddie v.\nConnecticut, 401 U.S. 371, 379 (1971); see also Loudermill, 470\nU.S. at 542; Bell v. Burson, 402 U.S. 535, 542 (1971). This\nfundamental right to a pre-deprivation hearing is not abridged by\nthe availability of extensive post-deprivations remedies. SeeMorton v.\nBeyer, 822 F.2d 364, 368 (3d Cir. 1987) (holding that\n\"the availability of extensive post-termination procedures does not\neliminate the essential requirement of due process that a hearing\nbe provided before discharge\"); Gniotek v. City of Philadelphia,\n808 F.2d 241, 243 (3d Cir. 1986) (noting that \"[t]he predeprivation\nhearing need not be elaborate, but it is necessary, even if\nextensive post-deprivation remedies are afforded.\"), cert. denied,\n481 U.S. 1050 (1987).\n     While we recognize that Homar was not completely terminated\nfrom his employment with ESU, he was terminated from his position\nas a police officer and received a reduction in his pay.\nAccordingly, we find the requirements of Loudermill to be\napplicable in this instance. Indeed, there is no dispute among the\nparties that Homar had a property interest in his employment as\npolice officer. Rather, the dispute concerns the degree of due\nprocess to which Homar was entitled prior to his suspension without\npay and prior to his demotion from his position as police officer\nto groundskeeper.\n                                A.\n\f     We will first address Homar's contention that he was entitled\nto notice and an opportunity to be heard prior to his suspension\nwithout pay from his position as an ESU police officer.\n     It is undisputed that Homar was not afforded any kind of\nhearing prior to his suspension without pay immediately following\nhis arrest on drug charges. ESU nonetheless argues that Homar's\ndue process rights were not violated because, while Homar's\ninterest in remaining in his job is \"an important one,\" ESU had a\ncompelling interest in \"taking prompt action to maintain public\nconfidence in its police force.\" Appellee's Brief at 15. Indeed,\nthe Supreme Court has explained that\n     [a]n important government interest, accompanied by a\n     substantial assurance that the deprivation is not\n     baseless or unwarranted, may in limited cases demanding\n     prompt action justify postponing the opportunity to be\n     heard until after the initial deprivation.\nFDIC v. Mallen, 486 U.S. 230, 240 (1988); see also Boddie, 401 U.S.\nat 379 (noting that there can be \"extraordinary situations where\nsome valid governmental interest is at stake that justifies\npostponing the hearing until after the event\").\n     The district court agreed with ESU, finding that it was\npermissible for the university to suspend Homar without pay and\nwithout a hearing. The court first noted that \"[b]oth the timing\nand the nature of requisite process depends upon an 'appropriate\naccommodation of the competing interests involved.'\" Homar v.\nGilbert, No. CV-93-0853, typescript at 11 (M.D. Pa., March 17,\n1995) (hereinafter \"D. Ct. Op.\") (citing Goss v. Lopez, 419 U.S.\n565, 579 (1975)). It then applied the analysis prescribed by Logan\nv. Zimmerman Brush Co., assessing the competing interests involved,\nincluding \"the importance of the private interest, and the length\nand finality of the deprivation, . . . the likelihood of\ngovernmental error, . . . and the magnitude of the governmental\ninterests involved.\" Id., typescript at 11 (quoting Logan v.\nZimmerman Brush Co., 455 U.S. 422, 434 (1982)). While the district\ncourt recognized that Homar's \"private interest was strong,\" it\nfound that \"the deprivation incident to a suspension was only\ntemporary and of a relatively brief duration (approximately one\nmonth).\" Id., typescript at 11. The district court concluded that\nHomar's interest in avoiding such a \"temporary\" and \"brief\"\ndeprivation was not as compelling as \"the governmental interest in\npreserving public confidence in law enforcement.\" Id., typescript\nat 12. The court found its conclusion bolstered by the fact that\nHomar was eventually awarded full pay and benefits for the period\nof suspension, noting that \"'[s]uspension with pay does not raise\ndue process concerns.'\" Id., typescript at 13 (quoting Hicks v.\nCity of Watonga, Okl., 942 F.2d 737, 746 n.4 (10th Cir. 1991).\n     We agree with the district court that there was a compelling\ngovernmental interest which supports ESU's decision to suspend\nHomar immediately and without a hearing pending further\ninvestigation. The university has a substantial interest in\nmaintaining public confidence in the ESU police force, and Homar's\narrest on drug charges certainly suffices to ensure that the\nuniversity's concerns were not baseless or unwarranted, as required\nby the Supreme Court. See Mallen, 486 U.S. at 240. In\n\fcircumstances where public safety is implicated, \"[n]ot even an\ninformal hearing . . . must precede a deprivation.\" Caine v.\nHardy, 943 F.2d 1406, 1412 (5th Cir. 1991) (en banc), cert. denied,\n503 U.S. 936 (1992).\n     Nonetheless, we find that Homar's due process rights were\nviolated because he was suspended without pay. The Supreme Court's\ndecision in Loudermill strongly suggests that suspension without\npay must be preceded by notice and an opportunity to be heard in\nall instances. Initially, the Court noted that it had \"frequently\nrecognized the severity of depriving a person of the means of\nlivelihood.\" Loudermill, 470 U.S. at 543. Then the Court\nexplained that, while it recognized that there were some limited\ninstances in which a strong governmental interest might warrant\nimmediately removing a person from a position without a hearing,\n\"in those situations where the employer perceives a significant\nhazard in keeping the employee on the job, it can avoid the problem\nby suspending with pay.\" Id. at 544-45 (emphasis added).\n     Other circuits which have examined this language in Loudermillhave\ndisagreed with regard to its precise mandate. At least one\ncourt of appeals has read Loudermill to require that an employee be\nprovided an opportunity to be heard prior to suspension without\npay. See Everett v. Napper, 833 F.2d 1507, 1512 (11th Cir. 1987)\n(holding that, under Loudermill a suspended firefighter was\nentitled to a hearing prior to suspension because he was not paid\nduring his suspension). The Federal Circuit, by contrast, noted\nthat Loudermill's prescription of suspension with pay in situations\nwhere significant hazards would result from continued employment\nwas only dicta: \"We agree that in the instant case, the government\ncould have suspended with pay. Nevertheless, we cannot read\nLoudermill as holding the government must suspend . . . with pay.\"\nEngdahl v. Dept. of Navy, 900 F.2d 1572, 1578 (Fed. Cir. 1990).\nOther circuits, while not explicitly addressing Loudermill, have on\noccasion allowed suspension without pay to stand even in the\nabsence of a pre-deprivation hearing. See, e.g., Jones v. City of\nGary, Ind., 57 F.3d 1435, 1436 (7th Cir. 1995); Ambus v. Granite\nBd. of Educ., 975 F.2d 1555, 1558, 1562 (10th Cir. 1992), modified\non rehearing by, 995 F.2d 992 (10th Cir. 1993) (en banc).\n     This court has not precisely addressed this issue in the past.\nHowever, our decision in Bradley v. Pittsburgh Bd. of Educ., 913\nF.2d 1064 (3d Cir. 1990), may be read to imply that, under\nLoudermill, suspension without a pre-deprivation hearing is only\nconstitutional if the suspension is one with pay. In Bradley, we\nwere called upon to decide, among other issues, whether a teacher\nwho had been effectively suspended without pay and without a\nhearing for one year prior to being officially terminated, had been\ndeprived of his procedural due process rights. The employer in\nBradley ultimately provided Bradley full sabbatical pay for the\nyear in question. The district court had relied upon Loudermill to\nconclude that the employer was entitled to suspend Bradley without\na pre-suspension hearing because he eventually had been provided\npayment for the period of suspension. Id. at 1077. In reviewing\nthis decision, we first acknowledged that under Loudermill, in\ncircumstances where a governmental employer perceives substantial\nhazards in keeping an employee on the job, it may suspend the\n\femployee with pay until such time that a hearing may be held. Id.(citing\nLoudermill, 470 U.S. at 544-45). We concluded, however,\nthat \"Loudermill [did] not govern [that] case because Bradley was\nsuspended without pay.\" Id. We thus implicitly, but necessarily,\nrejected the idea that a government employer could cite to the\nsubstantial hazards of keeping an employee on the job and thereby\nsuspend him without a pre-suspension hearing without pay. Had we\ndetermined that Bradley had been suspended with pay, we presumably\nwould have found that the Loudermill exception -- essentially the\nMallen exception -- applied. Thus, while Bradley does not\nexplicitly declare that suspension without pay and without a pre-\nsuspension hearing always violates due process, such a holding may\nbe inferred from its reasoning.\n     Today we clearly enunciate that a governmental employer may\nnot suspend an employee without pay unless that suspension is\npreceded by some kind of pre-suspension hearing, providing the\nemployee with notice and an opportunity to be heard. We think that\nsuch a holding is not only consistent with, and suggested by,\nLoudermill, but it is also eminently sensible. It is imperative\nthat employers be provided with adequate flexibility to allow them\nto protect the public and respond to emergency situations\nexpediently. Suspension with pay addresses these important\nconcerns while simultaneously protecting the fundamental rights of\nan employee to due process prior to being deprived of his or her\nproperty interest in employment and its accompanying salary.\nFurthermore, this conclusion seems consistent with the Supreme\nCourt's holding in Zimmerman Brush that, in determining the timing\nand nature of an appropriate hearing, courts should assess the\ncompeting interests involved and arrive at an appropriate\naccommodation. Zimmerman Brush, 455 U.S. at 434.\n     As noted above, the district court treated Homar's suspension\nas a suspension with pay:\n     That Homar was originally suspended without pay does not\n     warrant a finding that he was deprived of property\n     without due process. At most, he was denied use of his\n     salary for a very brief period of time. To recognize a\n     cause of action for denial of due process under these\n     circumstances would clearly elevate form over substance.\n\n                       *     *     *\n\n     Since he clearly could be suspended with pay without\n     implicating due process concerns, and within one month\n     after being suspended he was awarded full pay for the\n     period of suspension, any injury resulting from the\n     failure to provide an opportunity to be heard before the\n     suspension was imposed is surely de minimis.\nD. Ct. Op., typescript at 13-14.\n     We fundamentally disagree with the district court's\nconclusion. First, our decision in Bradley clearly indicates that\nthe subsequent awarding of backpay does not remedy a due process\nviolation:\n     The right to procedural due process cannot be so\n     ephemeral that it evaporates because an individual\n\f     suspended without pay happened to obtain paid leave\n     thereafter. . . . That may affect the damages ultimately\n     awarded, but if there was a violation of due process,\n     [the employee] is entitled to have that right vindicated.\nBradley, 913 F.2d at 1077.\n     Second, Homar's suspension without pay cannot be viewed as deminimis.\nAt the time that Homar was suspended, he was told that\nhe was \"to be suspended without pay, effective immediately on\n8/26/92, from [his] position as a police officer at East\nStroudsburg University.\" App. at 197. For a period of\napproximately one month, Homar's very livelihood was threatened\nbecause he received no salary. As far as Homar knew at the time of\nhis suspension, he had no prospects whatsoever of receiving any\nwages for the indefinite duration of his suspension. It was not\nuntil he received his letter of demotion on September 24, 1992 --\nnearly a month after he was suspended -- that he learned he would\nbe receiving backpay at the rate of a groundskeeper. While it is\ntrue that Homar eventually received backpay at the wage rate he\nearned as a police officer to cover the period of his suspension,\nwe note that according to Defendant's Statement of Material Fact\naccompanying their Motion for Summary Judgment, Levanowitz did not\nauthorize Homar's backpay at the rate of a police officer until\nFebruary 16, 1993. Thus, for nearly six months, Homar was deprived\nof a salary that was rightfully his. Furthermore, there is\nevidence to suggest that ESU only agreed to pay this rate upon\npressure from Homar's union representative.\n       Accordingly, we find that Homar was entitled to notice and\nat least some kind of hearing prior to being suspended without\npay. It is undisputed that Homar received no hearing prior to his\nsuspension, and we conclude that the district court erred in\ngranting summary judgment in favor of defendants on this issue.\n\n                                B.\n     Homar further alleges that he was deprived of meaningful pre-\ntermination due process in the course of his demotion to the\nposition of groundskeeper.\n     As outlined above, Loudermill requires that a public employee\nwith a property interest in his or her employment be granted a\nmeaningful pre-termination hearing. Loudermill, 470 U.S. at 545-\n46. We reiterate that it is of paramount importance that this\nhearing take place prior to the deprivation. As explained above,\nabsent compelling government interests justifying postponement of\na hearing, the hearing must take place before the deprivation, seeBoddie,\n401 U.S. at 379; Loudermill, 470 U.S. at 542; Bell, 402\nU.S. at 542, because \"the only meaningful opportunity to invoke the\ndiscretion of the decisionmaker is likely to be before the\ntermination takes effect.\" Id.; see also, Board of Regents v.\nRoth, 408 U.S. 564, 570 n.7 (1972). Indeed, this right to pre-\ndeprivation due process is so fundamental that it remains \"even if\nextensive post-deprivation remedies are afforded.\" Gniotek, 808\nF.2d at 243; see also Morton, 822 F.2d at 368.\n     This pre-deprivation hearing need not be elaborate. As\nexplained by the Supreme Court, \"'something less' than a full\nevidentiary hearing is sufficient prior to adverse administrative\n\faction.\" Loudermill, 470 U.S. at 545 (citations omitted).\nNonetheless, the hearing must be sufficient to inform the employee\nof the evidence against him or her and to respond to the evidence.\nSee Fraternal Order of Police Lodge No. 5 v. Tucker, 868 F.2d 74,\n80 (3d Cir. 1989). \"[A] sina [sic] qua non of a meaningful hearing\nis a sufficient explanation of the employer's evidence to permit a\nmeaningful response.\" Id.\n     Under the circumstances presented here, where Homar was\nsuspended from his position pending further investigation into his\nactivities, it is clear that there was no compelling government\nissue at stake that would require ESU to immediately deprive Homar\nof his employment. Any concerns about preserving public safety or\nthe integrity of the police force were met by Homar's suspension.\nThe university thus was afforded the time it would need adequately\nto provide Homar a pre-deprivation hearing. The question for us to\nanswer, then, is whether the university provided him such a\nhearing.\n     The district court concluded that the \"administrative hearing\"\nwhich took place on September 18 did not meet the due process\nrequirements of a pre-deprivation hearing because it \"did not allow\n[Homar] to make a meaningful response to the damaging information\nfound in the supplemental report.\" D. Ct. Op., typescript at 15.\nWe agree.\n     During the September 18 meeting, Levanowitz only told Homar\nthat the State Police had given him some \"evidence very serious in\nnature.\" App. at 164. While it safely can be presumed that Homar\nknew that ESU's concerns about his employment arose from his arrest\non drug charges, Homar was not aware of the allegations made\nagainst him by the troopers that were presented in the Supplemental\nReport, namely that he allegedly confessed to knowing that Crompton\nand Habhab were drug dealers and to receiving marijuana from Habhab\nduring his employment as a police officer. More to the point,\nHomar was completely unaware that Levanowitz had received a copy of\nthe Supplemental Report containing these allegations. Under these\ncircumstances it is very clear that Homar's right to a meaningful\npre-deprivation hearing was denied. See Tucker, 868 F.2d at 80\n(holding that suspended police officers who were not told anything\nspecific about drug use allegations or the evidence regarding the\nallegations were deprived of their due process rights because they\nhad no opportunity to explain or rebut evidence).\n     In spite of its conclusion regarding the insufficiency of the\nSeptember 18 \"administrative hearing,\" the district court entered\nsummary judgment in favor of defendants because it concluded that\nHomar's September 24, 1995 meeting with President Gilbert, prior to\nwhich Homar had received and read the Supplemental Report, was a\nmeaningful pre-termination hearing. D. Ct. Op., typescript at 16.\nGiven that Homar was afforded an opportunity to review the\nSupplemental Report and offer meaningful responses to the\nallegations, we find that this meeting afforded Homar with\nsufficient procedural due process protections assuming it took\nplace prior to his demotion becoming effective. While true that an\nemployee is not entitled to a pre-decision hearing, see Chung v.\nPark, 514 F.2d 382, 387 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 948\n\f(1975), only if this hearing took place before his demotion tookeffect can\nwe conclude that he was afforded meaningful due process.\n      The district court held as a matter of law that Homar's\ndismissal from his position as a police officer took effect only\nafter this meeting with President Gilbert. D. Ct. Op., typescript\nat 16. The district court found that the meeting, which took place\nat 2 p.m. on September 24, 1992, \"occurred before Homar would have\nstarted his evening shift as police officer should Gilbert have\ndecided to reinstate him to that position,\" id., and thus concluded\nthat \"Gilbert's decision that Homar could not return to ESU as a\npolice officer is properly viewed as the point in time when Homar\nwas deprived of his position as an ESU police officer.\" Id.\n     We disagree with the district court that the point in time at\nwhich Homar's demotion became effective is clear. There is\nsubstantial evidence in the record to support a conclusion that\nHomar's demotion took effect prior to this meeting. Homar's\nmeeting with Gilbert took place on September 24 at 2:00 p.m. The\nletter which Levanowitz sent to Homar apprising him that he had\nbeen demoted to Groundskeeper was dated on September 23, 1992. In\nthat letter, Levanowitz informed Homar that he was \"to be demoted\nfrom [his] position as a Police Officer I in the Campus Police\nDepartment to the position of Groundskeeper, a position [he]\nformerly held.\" App. at 208 (emphasis added). The letter further\nrequired that Homar \"report to work at 7:00 A.M. on September 24,\n1992,\" to start his job as groundskeeper, and informed Homar that\nthis \"action is effective retroactive to August 26, 1992.\" App. at\n208 (emphasis added). Homar testified during a deposition that he\nwas already working as a groundskeeper at the time of his September\n24th, 2:00 p.m. meeting with Gilbert. There is thus evidence\nsuggesting that Homar had already been demoted to groundskeeper by\nthe time this meeting took place. If this is true, then Homar was\ndeprived of a meaningful pre-deprivation hearing.\n     The district court based its contrary conclusion on two\ngrounds. First, the court determined that \"[t]he significance of\nthe meeting was that Gilbert held ultimate decision-making\nauthority regarding whether Homar would remain employed by ESU as\na police officer.\" D. Ct. Op., typescript at 15. However, this\nmeeting with Gilbert never would have occurred had Homar's union\nrepresentative not sought to arrange for the meeting with Gilbert.\nApp. at 225. This fact seems to suggest that Levanowitz's demotion\nof Homar would have become effective without Gilbert's approval,\nwhich would render Levanowitz's letter the final demotion.\nLevanowitz's authoritative tone in the letter similarly supports\nthis conclusion.\n     The district court also concluded that the meeting with\nGilbert had taken place prior to Homar's demotion because it\noccurred before 4 p.m., the time at which Homar would normally\nbegin his shift as a police officer. Id. at 16. We disagree that\nthe timing of the demotion is so clear. We think there is\ncertainly an issue of material fact as to whether Homar's demotion\nbecame effective on August 26, as stated in the letter; at 7:00\na.m. on September 24, the date he was told to report to work as a\ngroundskeeper; or at 4:00 p.m. on September 24, the time at which\nHomar would normally report to work as a police officer. Unless\n\fdefendants expected Homar to act as both groundskeeper and police\nofficer on September 24, the facts appear to support the conclusion\nthat Homar's demotion was effective at the latest by 7 a.m. on the\nmorning of September 24th, seven hours prior to his meeting with\nGilbert.\n     We thus conclude that there is a genuine issue of material\nfact regarding the date and time at which Homar's demotion became\neffective, and that the district court's grant of summary judgment\nwas therefore inappropriate. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.,\n477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986) (holding summary judgment is inappropriate\nif there is evidence \"such that a reasonable jury could return a\nverdict for the nonmoving party.\"). Accordingly, we reverse the\ndistrict court's entry of summary judgment regarding Homar's\nmeaningful pre-deprivation hearing.\n\n                               IV.\n     Homar also contends that there is an issue of material fact as\nto whether his substantive due process rights were violated.\nRelying on this court's precedent in Parkway Garage, Inc. v. City\nof Philadelphia, 5 F.3d 685, 692 (3d Cir. 1993) in which we stated\nthat \"[a] violation of substantive due process rights is proven: .\n. . 'if the government's actions in a particular case were in fact\nmotivated by bias, bad faith or improper motive. . . ,'\" id.(quoting\nMidnight Sessions, Ltd. v. City of Philadelphia, 945 F.2d\n683 (3d Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 503 U.S. 984 (1992)), Homar\npoints to several facts that he argues demonstrate that his\nsuspension and demotion were motivated by bias, bad faith or\nimproper motive.\n     The district court granted summary judgment in favor of\ndefendants on this claim on the ground that there was no genuine\nissue of material fact as to whether Levanowitz, Gilbert or any\nother ESU official was motivated by bias, bad faith or improper\nmotive.\n     While we agree with the district court that the evidence in\nthis case does not support a conclusion that Levanowitz or any\nother ESU official was motivated by an improper motive in\nsuspending and then demoting Homar, for there is, indeed, \"nothing\nimproper about conducting an investigation of a law enforcement\nofficer who has been arrested, even if the charges are ultimately\ndismissed,\" D. Ct. Op., typescript at 23, we think that there is\na question of material fact as to whether ESU officials acted in\nbad faith. Several events leading up to Homar's demotion suggest\nthat Levanowitz did not engage in a good faith effort to accord\nHomar appropriate due process protection throughout his ordeal.\nLevanowitz never informed Homar that he had received and read the\nSupplemental Report prior to their September 18 meeting; Levanowitz\nordered that a poll be taken among police officers regarding\nwhether Homar should be allowed to return to the force, which is\ncertainly a very strange proceeding outside the realm of\ntraditional due process proceedings; and Levanowitz issued the\nSeptember 23 letter of demotion prior to the meeting with President\nGilbert -- a meeting which occurred only after Homar's union\nrepresentative requested it take place. Such events might lead a\nreasonable fact-finder to conclude that Homar's demotion was pre-\n\fdetermined and to view the entire demotion process as rigged to\nproduce this result.\n     Our conclusion that there is a genuine issue of material fact\nas to whether ESU officials were motivated by bad faith, however,\ndoes not lead us to remand this matter simply for a factual\nfinding. A more fundamental legal question must first be\naddressed, namely whether Homar's property interest in his state-\ncreated job is an interest worthy of protection under substantive\ndue process. DeBlasio v. Zoning Bd. of Adjustment, 53 F.3d 592,\n598, 600 (3d Cir. 1993) (holding that before addressing the\nsufficiency of the evidence of improper motive, a court addressing\na substantive due process claim should first consider whether the\nplaintiff possesses a property interest worthy of substantive due\nprocess protection). Although Homar has succeeded in making a\nprocedural due process claim, under the law of this circuit \"not\nall property interests worthy of procedural due process protections\nare protected by the concept of substantive due process.\" Reich v.\nBeharry, 883 F.2d 239, 244 (3d Cir. 1989). In order to state a\nsubstantive due process claim, \"a plaintiff must have been deprived\nof a certain quality of property interest.\" DeBlasio, 53 F.3d at\n600.\n     The parties did not address before the district court the\nquestion of whether a state-created property interest in employment\nis the \"certain quality\" of property interest worthy of protection\nunder the substantive due process clause, nor did the district\ncourt consider it. While courts of appeals do have discretion to\nconsider and resolve certain issues for the first time on appeal,\nsuch as where the proper resolution is not in doubt or where\n\"'injustice might otherwise result,'\" Singleton v. Wulff, 428 U.S.\n106, 121 (1976) (quoting Hormel v. Helvering, 312 U.S. 552, 557\n(1941)); see also Nelson v. County of Allegheny, 60 F.3d 1010, 1013\nn.3 (3d Cir. 1995), it is a general rule that federal appellate\ncourts do not consider an issue not passed upon below. Singleton,\n428 U.S. at 120.\n     In the instant case, we think it appropriate to remand this\nissue for consideration in the first instance by the district\ncourt. Certainly this is not a situation where the proper\nresolution is clear. Rather, the case law of this circuit and the\nSupreme Court provides very little guidance as to what constitutes\nthis \"certain quality\" of property interest worthy of protection\nunder the substantive due process clause. We have held that\n\"ownership is a property interest worthy of substantive due process\nprotection,\" id., but we have found that neither interest in prompt\nreceipt of payment for professional services provided to the state,\nReich, 883 F.2d at 244-45, nor state law entitlement to water and\nsewer services, Ransom v. Marrazzo, 848 F.2d 398, 411-12 (3d Cir.\n1988) are the \"certain quality\" of property interest worthy of\nsubstantive due process protection. We also have strongly\nsuggested in dictum that a student's right to continued enrollment\nin a graduate program does not rise to such a level on the ground\nthat such an interest bears \"'little resemblance to the fundamental\ninterests that previously had been viewed as implicitly protected\nby the Constitution.'\" Mauriello v. U. of Med. & Dentistry of\nN.J., 781 F.2d 46, 40 (3d Cir. 1986) (quoting Regents of University\n\fof Michigan v. Ewing, 474 U.S. 214, 229-30 (Powell, J.,\nconcurring).   None of the property interests formerly considered\nare especially analogous to the property interest in state-created\nemployment. Given the complexity of this issue, we think it\nappropriate to allow the district court the first opportunity to\nconsider it. Should this issue return to us on appeal, we will\nbenefit from the district court's analysis. Furthermore, we have\nalready determined to remand this matter on the procedural due\nprocess ground as well, eliminating any concern about the injustice\nof delaying the final conclusion of this case. Accordingly, we\nremand this question to the district court for consideration there.\n                                V.\n     Additionally, Homar contends that a genuine issue of material\nfact exists as to whether Homar's due process rights were violated\nbecause defendants made public statements about his suspension that\nstigmatized Homar and damaged his reputation. Specifically, Homar\nalleges that ESU violated his protected liberty interest in two\nways. First, he alleges that ESU seriously damaged his good name\nand reputation by publicly disclosing the charges against him.\nSecond, Homar alleges that ESU imposed a stigma or disability on\nhim, foreclosing his freedom to take advantage of other employment\nopportunities. We will address these two claims in turn.\n                                A.\n     The Supreme Court has held that a person has a liberty\ninterest in employment actions which require due process \"where a\nperson's good name, reputation, honor or integrity is at stake\nbecause of what the government is doing to him.\" Roth, 408 U.S. at\n573. Homar claims that this liberty interest was implicated in the\ninstant case because ESU's demotion of him \"'damage[d] his standing\nand associations in the community.'\" Appellant's Brief at 28\n(citing Roth, 408 U.S. at 573). Homar may only prevail on this\nclaim if he can demonstrate that the government \"create[d] and\ndisseminate[d] a false and defamatory impression about [him] in\nconnection with his termination.\" Codd v. Velger, 429 U.S. 624,\n628 (1977) (per curiam). See also Bishop v. Wood, 426 U.S. 341,\n348-39 (1976).\n     Homar contends that ESU's disclosure of its investigation into\nhis activities in a small article that appeared in the Pocono\nRecord newspaper, coupled with his subsequent demotion, implicated\nhis liberty interest. We disagree. The article in the newspaper\ndid not disclose any specifics regarding the nature of ESU's\nconcern, nor did it disclose information about the disciplinary\naction ESU contemplated. Furthermore, the article appeared prior\nto his demotion, and there is no evidence to indicate that ESU\npublicly disclosed the outcome of its investigation or the fact\nthat it demoted Homar to groundskeeper. We accordingly find that\nHomar has no liberty interest claim. See Tucker, 868 F.2d at 82\n(holding that no liberty interest was implicated when press release\nabout discharge of police officers was not misleading).\n                                B.\n        Homar further alleges that ESU violated his liberty\ninterest because it imposed \"a stigma . . . that foreclosed his\nfreedom to take advantage of other employment opportunities.\"\nRoth, 408 U.S. at 573. Yet Homar has proffered no evidence to\n\fsuggest that the disciplinary actions taken by the university had\nin any way foreclosed other employment opportunities. Indeed,\nHomar testified at his deposition that he had not sought out a\nposition with any other employer since his demotion. App. at 50.\nFurthermore, as noted above, Homar makes no allegations that any\ninformation in the newspaper article was untrue; the university\nnever even publicly disclosed that Homar was terminated from his\njob as police officer. Under such circumstances, we cannot find\nthat Homar's liberty interest was implicated. Tucker, 868 F.2d at\n83.\n     Accordingly, we affirm the district court's issuance of\nsummary judgment as to this issue.\n                               VI.\n     For the foregoing reasons, we affirm in part, reverse in part\nand remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\nHomar v. Gilbert\nNo. 95-7218.\nALITO, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n\n     I write separately for two reasons. First, I would hold,\nbased on the undisputed facts of this case, that the university's\nsuspension of Homar without pay and without a hearing did not\nviolate the principles of procedural due process as interpreted by\nthe Supreme Court. I thus dissent from section III.A of the\nmajority's opinion. Second, although I do not disagree with the\nmajority's decision to remand the substantive due process question\nto the district court, I wish to set forth my own views on that\nissue.\n\n                                I.\n     A. Due process does not always require a pre-suspension\nhearing. See, e.g., FDIC v. Mallen, 486 U.S. 230, 240-41 (1988);\nBarry v. Barchi, 443 U.S. 55, 63-66 (1979). In Mallen, the Supreme\nCourt observed that \"[a]n important government interest,\naccompanied by a substantial assurance that the deprivation is not\nbaseless or unwarranted, may in limited cases demanding prompt\naction justify postponing the opportunity to be heard until after\nthe initial deprivation.\" Id. at 240 (citations omitted); see alsoLogan\nv. Zimmerman Brush Co., 455 U.S. 422 (1982) (\"[T]he timing\nand nature of the required hearing `will depend on appropriate\naccommodation of the competing interests involved. These include\nthe importance of the private interest and the length or finality\nof the deprivation, the likelihood of governmental error, and the\nmagnitude of the governmental interests involved.\") (citations and\nfootnote omitted). In my view, this exception should apply here.\nSee, e.g., Ambus v. Granite Bd. of Educ., 975 F.2d 1555, 1562 (10th\nCir. 1992), aff'd as modified on other ground, 995 F.2d 992 (10th\nCir. 1993) (en banc).\n     Under the particular circumstances of this case, a pre-\nsuspension hearing was not, in my view, essential. Within a few\nhours of the August 26, 1992, drug raid that resulted in Homar's\narrest, the university learned that Homar had been charged with\npossession of marijuana, possession with intent to deliver\n\fmarijuana, and criminal conspiracy. Homar did not report to work\non August 26 for his 4:00 p.m. to 12:00 p.m. shift. The next day,\nHomar called his police chief to say that he had been arrested and\nto ask whether he was suspended. Homar was informed that he was\nsuspended, and this was confirmed by letter delivered the same\nday.\n     I do not think that the university violated Homar's right to\nprocedural due process when it suspended him from his position as\na campus police officer after learning that he had been arrested\nand charged with drug violations. There was probable cause to\nsupport the criminal charges and hence a substantial assurance that\nthe deprivation was not baseless or unwarranted. The university\nwas certainly entitled to take the position that Homar could not be\npermitted to work as a campus police officer with such charges\noutstanding, and there was thus, as the majority concedes, a\ncompelling government interest present. And the university needed\nto act promptly. The majority admits all of this but finds that\nthe university had to suspend Homar with pay. I find no\nrequirement that in such circumstances a public employer must pay\nits suspended employees.\n     B. In reaching its conclusion to the contrary, the majority\ndeclares that \"a governmental employer may not suspend an employee\nwithout pay unless that suspension is preceded by some kind of pre-\nsuspension hearing.\" Majority Opinion, Typescript at 14. The\nmajority essentially announces a blanket rule that a public\nemployer that wishes to suspend an employee -- even an employee in\na public-safety position who has been charged with multiple\nfelonies -- must either provide a pre-suspension hearing or suspend\nthe employee with pay. This holding is based on one sentence of\ndictum from Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532,\n544-45 (1985), the Eleventh Circuit's reliance on that dictum in\nEverett v. Napper, 833 F.2d 1507, 1512 (11th Cir. 1987), and this\ncourt's opinion in Bradley v. Pittsburgh Bd. of Educ., 913 F.2d\n1064 (3d Cir. 1990). These bases do not, in my view, withstand\nscrutiny.\n     With regard to Loudermill, I note that the Supreme Court there\nexpressly recognized that \"[t]here are, of course, some situations\nin which a postdeprivation hearing will satisfy due process\nrequirements.\" Loudermill, 470 U.S. at 542 n.7 (citations\nomitted). It is of course true, as the Court later notes, that an\nemployer can avoid any due process problems associated with keeping\na dangerous employee on the job by suspending the employee with\npay, id. at 544-45, \"for then there is not a deprivation.\" Bailey\nv. Board of County Commissioners of Alachua County, 956 F.2d 1112,\n1124 n.13 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 832 (1992). But as\nthe Federal Circuit has explained, this \"is merely descriptive, not\nnormative. We agree that in the instant case, the government could\nhave suspended with pay. Nevertheless, we cannot read Loudermillas\nholding that the government must suspend him with pay.\" Engdahl\nv. Department of Navy, 900 F.2d 1572, 1578 (Fed. Cir. 1990). I\nagree.\n     The Eleventh Circuit's decision in Everett, which was issued\nbefore the Supreme Court's decision in Mallen, simply relies on the\nLoudermill dictum. Numerous courts of appeals have reached a\n\fcontrary conclusion regarding the import of Loudermill,\nparticularly after Mallen. See Jones v.

All of these\ndecisions -- like the Supreme Court's procedural due process cases\nin general and unlike the majority's blanket rule -- reflect a\nbalancing of interests based on the particular circumstances of\neach case.\n     I also believe that the majority has misinterpreted our\nopinion in Bradley. Citing Bradley, 913 F.2d at 1077, the majority\nstates that Bradley implies that suspension without pay and without\n\fa pre-suspension hearing always violates due process. Majority\nOpinion, Typescript at 13-14. However, on the next page of the\nBradley opinion, the panel clearly stated:\n     We need not decide in this case whether Bradley was\n     entitled to a pre-suspension hearing, as he contends, or\n     whether a post-suspension hearing sufficed. CompareLoudermill, 470\nU.S. at 544, 105 S.Ct. at 1494 (because\n     government's interest in immediate termination of\n     security guard who had lied when seeking employment did\n     not outweigh employee's interest in retaining employment,\n     pre-termination hearing was required) with FDIC v.\n     Mallen, 486 U.S. 230, 108 S.Ct.1780, 1787-88, 100 L.Ed.2d\n     265 (1988) (because government had substantial interest\n     in suspending indicted bank official to protect bank and\n     depositors, a post-suspension hearing within a reasonable\n     time was sufficient).\n\n           Bradley received no hearing, either before or after\n     the suspension, and hence if he was suspended, as the\n     record suggests, he was deprived of due process.\n913 F.2d at 1078. In my view, far from implying anything, the\nBradley panel expressly reserved decision on the issue presented in\nthis case.\n     I would resolve that issue in this case by following the great\nweight of federal appellate authority cited above and holding that\nwhether a pre-suspension hearing was required in this particular\ncase requires a balancing of the relevant factors. For the reasons\nalready expressed above, I would hold that in the circumstances of\nthis case, a pre-suspension hearing was not required and that a\npost-suspension hearing within a reasonable time after the\nsuspension was sufficient. It may be that the university failed to\nconduct a sufficiently prompt or adequate post-suspension hearing\nafter the criminal charges were dismissed on September 1, 1992, but\nthat is a different question. Moreover, as in Strong, I am not\nsure how a pre-suspension hearing on August 26, 1992, would have\nmade any difference. The only fact important to the university's\ndecision was whether Homar had been arrested and charged. Homar\ndid not dispute this, and in fact confirmed it the next day; Homar\nwas well aware of the reasons for his suspension. As in Strong,\nthe hearing required by the majority would have been \"an empty\nformality.\" See Strong, 902 F.2d at 212.\n     C. I have one final problem with the section of the majority\nopinion dealing with the need for a pre-suspension hearing. The\nmajority assumes that an important government interest requiring\nprompt action is what permits an employer to suspend an employee\nwithout a pre-suspension hearing but with pay. I think that this\nis inaccurate. It is my understanding that a public employer may\ngenerally suspend a public employee for cause, with pay, and\nwithout a hearing -- even absent an emergency situation -- because\nsuch a suspension does not ordinarily implicate any\nconstitutionally protected property interest. See, e.g., Hicks v.\nCity of Watonga, 942 F.2d 737, 746 n.4 (10th Cir. 1991) (\"[N]o\nproperty interest was infringed at Mr. Hicks' first round of\nhearings when he was suspended and then reprimanded. Mr. Hicks\n\fsuffered no loss in pay because of the pre-hearing suspension.\nSuspension with pay does not raise due process concerns.\")\n(citations omitted); Pitts v. Board of Educ. of U.S.D. 305, Salina,\nKansas, 869 F.2d 555, 556 (10th Cir. 1989) (same); see alsoHardiman v.\nJefferson County Bd. of Educ., 709 F.2d 635, 637-38 &\nn.2 (11th Cir. 1983) (not deciding but questioning whether\nsuspension with pay could ever constitute deprivation of property\ninterest, and opining that \"bad-faith\" suspension with pay might\ninfringe liberty interest); Koelsch v. Town of Amesbury, 851 F.\nSupp. 497, 500 (D. Mass. 1994) (\"A public employee's suspension\nwith pay does not implicate a constitutionally protected property\ninterest.\") (citations omitted). Under the majority's reasoning,\nthe important government interest requiring prompt action is\nrendered a nullity because it simply allows the employer to do what\nit could do in a typical non-emergency, for-cause suspension\nsituation, i.e., suspend the employee with pay.\n\n                               II.\n     Although I do not disagree with the majority's determination\nthat a remand is in order on Homar's substantive due process claim,\nI write separately to set forth my views on the viability of that\nclaim. I do not think that a plaintiff has a substantive due\nprocess claim for a non-legislative deprivation of a state-created\nproperty right by a public employer. Moreover, if Homar has a\nsubstantive due process claim in this context, it seems to me that\nhe must show that the employer's actions were not rationally\nrelated to a legitimate government interest; mere allegations of\nbad faith cannot suffice.\n     A. Neither the Supreme Court nor this court has previously\nheld that a plaintiff has a substantive due process claim for a\nnon-legislative deprivation of a state-created property interest by\na public employer. The Eleventh Circuit recently overruled a\ndecade of its own decisions recognizing such claims. McKinney v.\nPate, 20 F.3d 1550 (11th Cir. 1994) (en banc), cert. denied, 115 S.\nCt. 898 (1995); see also Rivkin v. Dover Twp. Rent Leveling Bd.,\n671 A.2d 567 (N.J. 1996). Essentially for the reasons stated in\nMcKinney, which I find persuasive, I believe that Homar's\nallegations state only procedural due process claims.\n     In McKinney, the Eleventh Circuit considered the following\nissue: \"whether, under the Fourteenth Amendment, a government\nemployee possessing a state-created property interest in his\nemployment states a substantive due process claim, rather than a\nprocedural due process claim, when he alleges that he was deprived\nof the employment interest by an arbitrary and capricious non-\nlegislative government action.\" Id. at 1553. Sitting en banc, a\nunanimous Eleventh Circuit answered \"no,\" and in an effort to bring\nits cases back into line with Supreme Court precedent, overruled a\ndecade of its prior decisions. The court held that \"in non-\nlegislative cases, only procedural due process claims are available\nto pretextually terminated employees.\" Id. at 1560; see alsoRivkin, 671\nA.2d at 577 (plaintiffs' purported substantive due\nprocess claim \"is much closer to a procedural due process claim\" in\nthat it \"amounts to an allegation that the State failed to furnish\nan impartial tribunal, which `is a matter of procedural, not\n\fsubstantive, due process'\") (citations omitted).\n     Two aspects of the Eleventh Circuit's opinion in McKinney bear\nemphasis here. First, the court concluded that allegations of\narbitrary and capricious action by governmental employers affecting\nan individual's property interest in public employment \"will not\nmake out a substantive due process claim under the jurisprudence of\nthe Supreme Court . . . because only procedural issues are\nimplicated.\" Id. at 1559 (emphasis in original); see also id. at\n1561 (\"McKinney's allegation is procedural: the County failed to\nprovide one of the elements of procedural due process -- an\nunbiased decisionmaker.\"). I agree, as I discuss further below.\n     Second, crucial to the court's decision was the distinction\nbetween legislative acts and non-legislative or executive acts.\nExecutive acts, such as employment decisions, typically apply to\none person or to a limited number of persons, while legislative\nacts, generally laws and broad executive regulations, apply to\nlarge segments of society. Id. at 1557 n.9. The court criticized\nits prior decision in Hearn v. City of Gainesville, 688 F.2d 1328\n(11th Cir. 1982) -- its first case to apply substantive due process\nanalysis to an arbitrary termination claim -- because \"[i]n that\ncase, where a terminated employee challenged an executive act, we\ncited Nebbia [v. New York, 291 U.S. 502 (1934)], where a\nlegislative act (to wit, a law) was at issue.\" Id. at 1558 n.14.\nThe court added that \"[i]t is imperative that a stricter\nsegregation of these two distinct case-categories be maintained.\"\nId. The court indicated that rational basis review under the\nsubstantive component of the Due Process Clause is appropriate only\nin the context of challenges to legislative action. Id. at 1557-58\n& nn. 9 & 14; see also TRM, Inc. v. United States, 52 F.3d 941, 945\n& n.17 (11th Cir. 1995) (applying rational basis review to\nsubstantive due process challenge to regulation under Food Stamp\nAct and noting that \"[t]his standard is not affected by our\ndecision in McKinney\" because \"[t]he holding of that case was\nspecifically limited to substantive due process challenges to non-\nlegislative acts\") (citations omitted); Sullivan Properties, Inc.\nv. City of Winter Springs, 899 F. Supp. 587, 594-96 (M.D. Fla.\n1995) (considering the impact of McKinney on substantive due\nprocess challenges in the area of zoning and the granting of\nbuilding permits; concluding that there is a \"substantive due\nprocess cause of action for arbitrary and unreasonable zoning\nordinances\" but not for \"substantive due process claims\n[challenging] executive acts granting or denying a particular\nbuilding permit application\"). I again agree.\n     Like the prior decisions in the Eleventh Circuit, a decision\nallowing Homar to maintain a substantive due process claim based on\nan allegation of bad faith would elevate Homar's procedural\nchallenges to substantive due process status. Assuming that there\nis a factual issue regarding whether defendants acted in bad faith,\nI question the wisdom of recognizing a substantive due process\nclaim where a university fails to provide adequate procedural due\nprocess and where the way in which procedural due process is denied\ncould give rise to an inference of bad faith. This sort of\n\"substantive procedural due process claim\" is precisely what\ntroubled both the Eleventh Circuit in McKinney and a unanimous New\n\fJersey Supreme Court in Rivkin, and I would not recognize such a\nclaim. It seems to me that Homar's claim is clearly procedural and\nshould be recognized as such.\n     Further, the cases upon which Homar relies essentially derive\n-- as is discussed more fully below -- from Pace Resources, Inc. v.\nShrewsbury Tp., 808 F.2d 1023 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 482 U.S. 906\n(1987), and Rogin v. Bensalem Tp., 616 F.2d 680, 689 (3d Cir.\n1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 1029 (1981), both of which involve\nchallenges to zoning ordinances and thus challenges to legislative\nacts. The cases that have applied Pace Resources and Rogin in\nchallenges to non-legislative acts have, in my view, fallen into\nthe trap identified by the Eleventh Circuit in McKinney. I would\nnot extend them into the public employment setting.\n     B. Assuming for the sake of argument that there is a\nsubstantive due process claim for arbitrary and capricious non-\nlegislative actions by public employers and that Homar's interest\nin his position as a campus police officer constituted a \"property\"\ninterest for substantive due process purposes, I nonetheless\nconclude that Homar seeks application of the wrong standard in\nevaluating his claim. Under true rational basis review -- which is\nthe most that Homar is entitled to where he is asserting the\nviolation of a non-fundamental, state-created property interest --\nI think that Homar failed to create a fact issue as to whether the\nuniversity violated his substantive due process rights.\n     The appropriateness of summary judgment as to Homar's\nsubstantive due process claim requires consideration of what Homar\nmust show to establish a substantive due process violation. Homar\nargues that our cases hold that a plaintiff can establish a\nsubstantive due process violation by proving that the government's\nactions were motivated by bias, bad faith, or improper motive.\nHomar contends that a public employee who suffers an adverse\nemployment decision may maintain a substantive due process claim\nagainst the public employer by showing (1) that the employer's\nactions were not rationally related to a legitimate government\ninterest or (2) that the employer's actions were motivated by (a)\nbias, (b) bad faith, or (c) improper motive. I do not agree.\n     First, as I alluded to above, we have never applied this test\nin the public employment context, and I would not extend this test\nto this context, whatever its appropriateness in other contexts.\nFurther, it seems to me that the statements in our opinions\nregarding the nature of rational basis review in substantive due\nprocess cases have evolved in a strange and, I think, unintended\nway. Beginning with unobjectionable descriptions of classical\nrational basis review, our opinions eventually reached the point of\nsuggesting that a plaintiff can state a substantive due process\nclaim merely by alleging that an individual decision resulting in\nthe deprivation of a property right was taken in bad faith. The\nSupreme Court has never sanctioned such a broad proposition, and I\nam confident that this cannot be the law. If a plaintiff like\nHomar has a substantive due process claim in this context, it seems\nto me that he must show that the employer's actions were not\nrationally related to a legitimate government interest and that\nmere allegations of bad faith cannot suffice.\n     In Pace Resources, Inc. v. Shrewsbury Tp., 808 F.2d 1023 (3d\n\fCir.), cert. denied, 482 U.S. 906 (1987), plaintiff challenged a\nmunicipality's land use restrictions on substantive due process\ngrounds. In describing the \"narrow review\" over zoning ordinances,\nwe quoted our prior decision in Rogin v. Bensalem Tp., 616 F.2d\n680, 689 (3d Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 1029 (1981):\n     \"The test for determining whether a law comports with\n     substantive due process is whether the law is rationally\n     related to a legitimate state interest. `[T]he law need\n     not be in every respect logically consistent with its\n     aims to be constitutional. It is enough that there is an\n     evil at hand for correction, and that it might be thought\n     that the particular legislative measure was a rational\n     way to correct it.'\"\n808 F.2d at 1034 (quoting Rogin, 616 F.2d at 689) (quoting\nWilliamson v. Lee Optical, 348 U.S. 483, 487-88 (1955)) (brackets\nin Rogin). We explained that \"[a] plaintiff making a substantive\ndue process claim in federal court has the burden of showing that\nthe regulation is arbitrary or irrational. Thus to state a claim,\nPace's complaint would have to allege facts that would support a\nfinding of arbitrary or irrational legislative action by the\nTownship.\" Id. at 1035 (citations omitted). After concluding that\n\"Pace's complaint fails to make any factual allegations that\nindicate irrationality\" and that \"Pace does not present a case\ninvolving actions aimed at this developer for reasons unrelated to\nland use planning,\" we concluded that \"[b]ecause it appears on the\nface of the amended complaint that the Township decisionmakers\ncould have had rational reasons for the decisions contested here\nand because that complaint alleges no facts suggesting\narbitrariness, it fails to state a substantive due process claim\nupon which relief can be granted.\" Id. at 1035-36 (citation\nomitted).\n     In Bello v. Walker, we noted the rational basis review\narticulated in Pace Resources, but we focused on the language from\nPace stating that the plaintiff there did not allege \"actions aimed\nat this developer for reasons unrelated to land use planning.\"\nBello v. Walker, 840 F.2d 1124, 1129 (3d Cir.) (citation omitted),\ncert. denied, 488 U.S. 851 (1988). We thus distinguished Pace\nResources and announced as follows:\n          We need not define, at this juncture, the outer\n     limits of the showing necessary to demonstrate that a\n     governmental action was arbitrary, irrational, or tainted\n     by improper motive. The plaintiffs in this case\n     presented evidence from which a fact finder could\n     reasonably conclude that certain council members, acting\n     in their capacity as officers of the municipality\n     improperly interfered with the process by which the\n     municipality issued building permits, and that they did\n     so for partisan political or personal reasons unrelated\n     to the merits of the application for the permits. These\n     actions can have no relationship to any legitimate\n     governmental objective, and if proven, are sufficient to\n     establish a substantive due process violation actionable\n     under section 1983.\nId. at 1129-30 (footnote omitted).\n\f     Next, the panel in Midnight Sessions paraphrased Bello and\nstated that \"a plaintiff may maintain a claim of substantive due\nprocess violation upon allegations that the government deliberately\nand arbitrarily abused its power.\" Midnight Sessions, Ltd. v. City\nof Phil., 945 F.2d 667, 683 (3d Cir. 1991) (citation omitted),\ncert. denied, 503 U.S. 984 (1992). \"Thus, allegations that the\ngovernment's actions in a particular case were motivated by bias,\nbad faith, or improper motive . . . may support a finding of\nsubstantive due process violation.\" Id. (citing Bello and Pace\nResources).\n     In Parkway Garage, Inc. v. City of Phil., 5 F.3d 685, 692 (3d\nCir. 1993), we explained that \"[s]ubstantive due process protects\ncitizens from arbitrary and irrational acts of government.\" Id. at\n692 (citing Rogin v. Bensalem Tp., 616 F.2d 680, 689 (3d Cir.\n1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 1029 (1981)). We then stated the\nfollowing test (which is the test quoted by the parties in this\ncase): \"A violation of substantive due process rights is proven:\n(1) if the government's actions were not rationally related to a\nlegitimate interest; or (2) `if the government's actions in a\nparticular case were in fact motivated by bias, bad faith or\nimproper motive.'\" Id. (citation omitted); see also Blanche Road\nCorp. v. Bensalem Tp., 57 F.3d 253, 263 (3d Cir.), cert. denied,\n116 S. Ct. 303 (1995).\n     From Rogin to Parkway Garage, then, we have moved from\ninquiring merely whether a legislative act survived pure rational\nbasis review to inquiring whether actions by specific defendants\nvis-a-vis a specific plaintiff were somehow improper. It seems to\nme that our cases began looking to governmental conduct that might\nprove a lack of rational basis, but we have now set forth an\nentirely separate test for evaluating substantive due process\nclaims that is independent of standard rational basis review. Seealso\nRivkin, 671 A.2d at 576-77 (declining to follow DeBlasio and\nBello and stating that \"[i]t is a mistake . . . to equate the\nconcept of `arbitrary and irrational' governmental land use\ndecisions with the substantive component of the Due Process Clause\nof the Fourteenth Amendment\"). In my view, the court should take\nthe next available opportunity to clarify that the appropriate test\nis true rational basis review.\n     If we are to recognize substantive due process claims in the\npublic employment context -- which, for the reasons discussed\nabove, I think would be a mistake -- then, in my view, we should\nask merely whether the plaintiff can show that the employer's\nactions were not rationally related to a legitimate government\ninterest. It should not be enough to allege bad faith by a single\ngovernmental actor; the overall conduct complained of must be\nunrelated to any legitimate governmental interest. If this mode of\nanalysis is applied to this case, I think that it is clear that the\nuniversity's actions were rationally related to its legitimate\ninterests, and, indeed, Homar does not contend otherwise.\n     C. In sum, substantive due process applies where there is a\nfundamental right at stake or legislation is challenged as having\nno rational relationship to any legitimate government interest.\nHere, plaintiff suggests no fundamental right within the meaning of\nthe substantive component of the Due Process Clause; nor is\n\fplaintiff challenging a legislative act on rational-basis grounds.\nIn my view, then, plaintiff has no substantive due process claim on\nthe undisputed facts presented.\n\n                               III.\n     For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent from the\nmajority's conclusion, set forth in section III.A, that Homar had\na right to a hearing prior to his suspension. Although I join in\nsection IV of the opinion remanding the substantive due process\nissue to the district court, I do not believe that Homar's\nsubstantive due process claim should survive a motion for summary\njudgment on remand.\n\f",

The criminal charges against\nHomar were eventually dismissed, but Homar was nonetheless\nsubsequently demoted to the position of groundskeeper. Homar filed\nsuit in federal district court seeking reinstatement, backpay and\ndamages for violations of his due process rights. The district\ncourt entered summary judgment in favor of defendants. Plaintiff\nappeals.\n     Although we conclude that these circumstances warranted and\njustified an immediate suspension of employment without a hearing,\nthe added suspension of pay necessitated a hearing. Furthermore,\nthe subsequent restoration of that pay cannot serve to cure the due\nprocess violation. It may serve to reduce the damages to which the\nemployee may be entitled, but the deprivation must be viewed at the\ntime of its occurrence, not as belatedly corrected by later action;\notherwise employers could violate the due process rights of their\nemployees and simply cure those violations through the means of\nretroactive pay.\n     We also hold that once suspended, an employee is entitled to\na hearing before any further action is taken to demote, terminate,\nor extend his suspension. At such a hearing, the employee is\nentitled to know the evidence against him and be afforded the\nopportunity for a meaningful response. We conclude that there is\na genuine issue of material fact as to whether such a hearing was\nafforded here, and we thus reverse the order of summary judgment.\n\n                                I.\n     Plaintiff Richard Homar was employed as a police officer at\nEast Stroudsburg University (\"ESU\"). On August 26, 1992, Homar was\narrested when a drug raid took place at the home of his friend,\nJames Crompton, whom he was visiting. That same day, the\nPennsylvania State Police filed a criminal complaint against Homar\ncharging him with possession of marijuana, possession with intent\nto deliver and criminal conspiracy.\n     The state police called David Marazas, ESU's police chief and\nHomar's supervisor, to inform him of Homar's arrest and the charges\nagainst him. Marazas then informed Gerald Levanowitz, ESU's\nDirector of Human Resources, to whom ESU President James Gilbert\n\fhad delegated authority to discipline and suspend ESU employees.\nLevanowitz decided immediately to suspend Homar without pay. No\npre-suspension hearing was held.\n     On August 27, Homar received a letter from Levanowitz advising\nhim that he was suspended without pay pending further investigation\nand disposition of the criminal charges. The letter advised Homar\nthat any administrative action taken by the University against him\n\"[did] not have to coincide with the disposition of those charges\nthrough the legal process.\" Appendix (\"App.\") at 197.\n     District Justice Charles P. Eyer dismissed all criminal\ncharges against Homar on September 1, 1992. Levanowitz still\nrefused to lift Homar's suspension.\n     On September 11, 1992, Levanowitz, along with two ESU police\nsergeants who were assigned to conduct an investigation on Homar,\nmet with two state troopers and a Corporal to discuss Homar's\nsituation. App. at 143. One of the troopers was the state trooper\nwho signed the criminal complaint against Homar. At this meeting,\nLevanowitz was provided with a copy of a page from the Pennsylvania\nState Police investigative file regarding Homar, called the\n\"Supplemental Report.\" This report includes statements attributed\nto Homar that he allegedly made to the Pennsylvania State Police\nwhen he was interviewed shortly after his arrest. According to the\nSupplemental Report, Homar admitted his knowledge of drug dealing\nby Crompton and another man named Habhab, and Homar further\nadmitted that he had received marijuana from Habhab for his own use\nwhile he was employed as an ESU police officer. Homar contests\nthat he ever made these statements.\n     On September 15, 1992, Levanowitz called Homar and arranged\nfor a meeting three days later. Levanowitz explained that this\nmeeting would be an \"administrative hearing,\" and that accordingly\nHomar had a right to have his union representative present but that\nhe did not have a right to legal counsel.\n     Homar attended this meeting on September 18, 1992, along with\nhis union representative. Besides Levanowitz, Marazas was also\npresent, as well as Levanowitz's secretary. At the start of the\nmeeting, Homar's union representative requested that Homar's\nattorney be present. Levanowitz responded that if Homar so chose,\nthey would have to postpone the meeting until a later time. Homar\nopted to proceed with the meeting unrepresented. According to the\nnotes taken by Levanowitz's secretary, Levanowitz made the\nfollowing statement to Homar:\n     The purpose of this meeting today is to give you an\n     opportunity to provide any information on your own behalf\n     that would assist us in making a determination concerning\n     the action that would end your suspension and any\n     information that would be of help to you in presenting\n     your case.\nApp. at 205.\n     Levanowitz maintained at a deposition held later that he had\ntold Homar that \"the State Police had given [him] some evidence\nvery serious in nature,\" App. at 164, and that he offered Homar the\nopportunity to present his side of the story. Levanowitz never\ninformed Homar that he had received the Supplemental Report from\nthe state police containing his alleged confession.\n\f     On September 23, 1992, Levanowitz wrote a letter to Homar\nadvising him that he was being demoted from the position of police\nofficer to the position of groundskeeper. The text of the letter\nreads, in pertinent part, as follows:\n          This is to inform you that you are to be demoted\n     from your position as a Police Officer I in the Campus\n     Police Department to the position of Groundskeeper. . .\n     . The action is effective retroactive to August 26, 1992,\n     and you are to be given back pay to that date at the rate\n     of pay for a Groundskeeper. You are to report to work at\n     7:00 A.M. on September 24, 1992 at the Facilities\n     Management Office. Your new rate of pay as Groundskeeper\n     will be $552.80 bi-weekly.\n\n          This action is being taken as a result of admissions\n     made by yourself to the Pennsylvania State Police on\n     August 26, 1992 that you maintained association with\n     individuals whom you knew were dealing in large\n     quantities of marijuana and you obtained marijuana from\n     one of those individuals for your own use. Your actions\n     constitute a clear and flagrant violation of Sections 200\n     and 200.2 of the East Stroudsburg University Police\n     Department Manual.\nApp. at 208 (footnote added).\n     After this letter was issued, the president of the union\nrepresenting Homar requested that Homar have an opportunity to meet\nwith President Gilbert regarding the letter. The meeting occurred\non September 24, 1992 at 2:00 p.m. By this time, Homar had\nreceived and read a copy of the Supplemental Report. Gilbert\nprovided Homar with an opportunity to respond to the charges and to\nLevanowitz's decision. Gilbert nonetheless sustained the\nsuspension.\n     After failing to obtain relief through his union grievance\nprocedure, Homar filed a complaint in the district court for the\nMiddle District of Pennsylvania against Gilbert, Levanowitz and\nMarazas. His complaint alleges that the procedures by which he was\nsuspended and then demoted lacked required due process, that\ndefendants' actions deprived him of liberty and property, and that\nhis substantive due process rights were also violated. The\ndistrict court entered summary judgment in favor of the defendants\non March 17, 1995. Homar then appealed to this court.\n\n                               II.\n     The district court had jurisdiction over this action pursuant\nto 28 U.S.C.    1331 and 1343 and 42 U.S.C.   1983. This court has\njurisdiction over the appeal of the district court's final decision\nunder 28 U.S.C.   1291.\n     Our review of the district court's order for summary judgment\nis plenary, and we thus apply the same standards that were\napplicable in the district court.

Indeed, there is no dispute among the\nparties that Homar had a property interest in his employment as\npolice officer. Rather, the dispute concerns the degree of due\nprocess to which Homar was entitled prior to his suspension without\npay and prior to his demotion from his position as police officer\nto groundskeeper.\n                                A.\n\f     We will first address Homar's contention that he was entitled\nto notice and an opportunity to be heard prior to his suspension\nwithout pay from his position as an ESU police officer.\n     It is undisputed that Homar was not afforded any kind of\nhearing prior to his suspension without pay immediately following\nhis arrest on drug charges. ESU nonetheless argues that Homar's\ndue process rights were not violated because, while Homar's\ninterest in remaining in his job is \"an important one,\" ESU had a\ncompelling interest in \"taking prompt action to maintain public\nconfidence in its police force.\" Appellee's Brief at 15. Indeed,\nthe Supreme Court has explained that\n     [a]n important government interest, accompanied by a\n     substantial assurance that the deprivation is not\n     baseless or unwarranted, may in limited cases demanding\n     prompt action justify postponing the opportunity to be\n     heard until after the initial deprivation.\nFDIC v.

The court first noted that \"[b]oth the timing\nand the nature of requisite process depends upon an 'appropriate\naccommodation of the competing interests involved.'\" Homar v.\nGilbert, No. CV-93-0853, typescript at 11 (M.D. Pa., March 17,\n1995) (hereinafter \"D.

It then applied the analysis prescribed by Logan\nv.

While the district\ncourt recognized that Homar's \"private interest was strong,\" it\nfound that \"the deprivation incident to a suspension was only\ntemporary and of a relatively brief duration (approximately one\nmonth).\" Id., typescript at 11. The district court concluded that\nHomar's interest in avoiding such a \"temporary\" and \"brief\"\ndeprivation was not as compelling as \"the governmental interest in\npreserving public confidence in law enforcement.\" Id., typescript\nat 12. The court found its conclusion bolstered by the fact that\nHomar was eventually awarded full pay and benefits for the period\nof suspension, noting that \"'[s]uspension with pay does not raise\ndue process concerns.'\" Id., typescript at 13 (quoting Hicks v.\nCity of Watonga, Okl., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566909\"><a href=\"/opinion/566909/steven-r-hicks-v-city-of-watonga-oklahoma-a-municipal-corporation-rb/\"><span class=\"volume\">942</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">737</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 746 n.4 (10th Cir. 1991).\n     We agree with the district court that there was a compelling\ngovernmental interest which supports ESU's decision to suspend\nHomar immediately and without a hearing pending further\ninvestigation. The university has a substantial interest in\nmaintaining public confidence in the ESU police force, and Homar's\narrest on drug charges certainly suffices to ensure that the\nuniversity's concerns were not baseless or unwarranted, as required\nby the Supreme Court. See Mallen, 486 U.S. at 240.

The Supreme Court's\ndecision in Loudermill strongly suggests that suspension without\npay must be preceded by notice and an opportunity to be heard in\nall instances. Initially, the Court noted that it had \"frequently\nrecognized the severity of depriving a person of the means of\nlivelihood.\" Loudermill, 470 U.S. at 543. Then the Court\nexplained that, while it recognized that there were some limited\ninstances in which a strong governmental interest might warrant\nimmediately removing a person from a position without a hearing,\n\"in those situations where the employer perceives a significant\nhazard in keeping the employee on the job, it can avoid the problem\nby suspending with pay.\" Id. at 544-45 (emphasis added).\n     Other circuits which have examined this language in Loudermillhave\ndisagreed with regard to its precise mandate. At least one\ncourt of appeals has read Loudermill to require that an employee be\nprovided an opportunity to be heard prior to suspension without\npay. See Everett v. Napper, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"498019\"><a href=\"/opinion/498019/45-empl-prac-dec-p-37596-2-indivemplrtscas-1377-tommy-l-everett/\"><span class=\"volume\">833</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1507</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1512 (11th Cir. 1987)\n(holding that, under Loudermill a suspended firefighter was\nentitled to a hearing prior to suspension because he was not paid\nduring his suspension). The Federal Circuit, by contrast, noted\nthat Loudermill's prescription of suspension with pay in situations\nwhere significant hazards would result from continued employment\nwas only dicta: \"We agree that in the instant case, the government\ncould have suspended with pay. Nevertheless, we cannot read\nLoudermill as holding the government must suspend . . . with pay.\"\nEngdahl v.

Pittsburgh Bd. of Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"547610\"><a href=\"/opinion/547610/earl-bradley-and-diane-murray-v-pittsburgh-board-of-education-richard-c/\"><span class=\"volume\">913</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1064</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir. 1990), may be read to imply that, under\nLoudermill, suspension without a pre-deprivation hearing is only\nconstitutional if the suspension is one with pay. In Bradley, we\nwere called upon to decide, among other issues, whether a teacher\nwho had been effectively suspended without pay and without a\nhearing for one year prior to being officially terminated, had been\ndeprived of his procedural due process rights. The employer in\nBradley ultimately provided Bradley full sabbatical pay for the\nyear in question. The district court had relied upon Loudermill to\nconclude that the employer was entitled to suspend Bradley without\na pre-suspension hearing because he eventually had been provided\npayment for the period of suspension. Id. at 1077. In reviewing\nthis decision, we first acknowledged that under Loudermill, in\ncircumstances where a governmental employer perceives substantial\nhazards in keeping an employee on the job, it may suspend the\n\femployee with pay until such time that a hearing may be held. Id.(citing\nLoudermill, 470 U.S. at 544-45). We concluded, however,\nthat \"Loudermill [did] not govern [that] case because Bradley was\nsuspended without pay.\" Id. We thus implicitly, but necessarily,\nrejected the idea that a government employer could cite to the\nsubstantial hazards of keeping an employee on the job and thereby\nsuspend him without a pre-suspension hearing without pay. Had we\ndetermined that Bradley had been suspended with pay, we presumably\nwould have found that the Loudermill exception -- essentially the\nMallen exception -- applied. Thus, while Bradley does not\nexplicitly declare that suspension without pay and without a pre-\nsuspension hearing always violates due process, such a holding may\nbe inferred from its reasoning.\n     Today we clearly enunciate that a governmental employer may\nnot suspend an employee without pay unless that suspension is\npreceded by some kind of pre-suspension hearing, providing the\nemployee with notice and an opportunity to be heard. We think that\nsuch a holding is not only consistent with, and suggested by,\nLoudermill, but it is also eminently sensible. It is imperative\nthat employers be provided with adequate flexibility to allow them\nto protect the public and respond to emergency situations\nexpediently. Suspension with pay addresses these important\nconcerns while simultaneously protecting the fundamental rights of\nan employee to due process prior to being deprived of his or her\nproperty interest in employment and its accompanying salary.\nFurthermore, this conclusion seems consistent with the Supreme\nCourt's holding in Zimmerman Brush that, in determining the timing\nand nature of an appropriate hearing, courts should assess the\ncompeting interests involved and arrive at an appropriate\naccommodation. Zimmerman Brush, 455 U.S. at 434.\n     As noted above, the district court treated Homar's suspension\nas a suspension with pay:\n     That Homar was originally suspended without pay does not\n     warrant a finding that he was deprived of property\n     without due process. At most, he was denied use of his\n     salary for a very brief period of time. To recognize a\n     cause of action for denial of due process under these\n     circumstances would clearly elevate form over substance.\n\n                       *     *     *\n\n     Since he clearly could be suspended with pay without\n     implicating due process concerns, and within one month\n     after being suspended he was awarded full pay for the\n     period of suspension, any injury resulting from the\n     failure to provide an opportunity to be heard before the\n     suspension was imposed is surely de minimis.\nD. Ct. Op., typescript at 13-14.\n     We fundamentally disagree with the district court's\nconclusion. First, our decision in Bradley clearly indicates that\nthe subsequent awarding of backpay does not remedy a due process\nviolation:\n     The right to procedural due process cannot be so\n     ephemeral that it evaporates because an individual\n\f     suspended without pay happened to obtain paid leave\n     thereafter. . . . That may affect the damages ultimately\n     awarded, but if there was a violation of due process,\n     [the employee] is entitled to have that right vindicated.\nBradley, 913 F.2d at 1077.\n     Second, Homar's suspension without pay cannot be viewed as deminimis.\nAt the time that Homar was suspended, he was told that\nhe was \"to be suspended without pay, effective immediately on\n8/26/92, from [his] position as a police officer at East\nStroudsburg University.\" App. at 197. For a period of\napproximately one month, Homar's very livelihood was threatened\nbecause he received no salary. As far as Homar knew at the time of\nhis suspension, he had no prospects whatsoever of receiving any\nwages for the indefinite duration of his suspension. It was not\nuntil he received his letter of demotion on September 24, 1992 --\nnearly a month after he was suspended -- that he learned he would\nbe receiving backpay at the rate of a groundskeeper. While it is\ntrue that Homar eventually received backpay at the wage rate he\nearned as a police officer to cover the period of his suspension,\nwe note that according to Defendant's Statement of Material Fact\naccompanying their Motion for Summary Judgment, Levanowitz did not\nauthorize Homar's backpay at the rate of a police officer until\nFebruary 16, 1993. Thus, for nearly six months, Homar was deprived\nof a salary that was rightfully his. Furthermore, there is\nevidence to suggest that ESU only agreed to pay this rate upon\npressure from Homar's union representative.\n       Accordingly, we find that Homar was entitled to notice and\nat least some kind of hearing prior to being suspended without\npay. It is undisputed that Homar received no hearing prior to his\nsuspension, and we conclude that the district court erred in\ngranting summary judgment in favor of defendants on this issue.\n\n                                B.\n     Homar further alleges that he was deprived of meaningful pre-\ntermination due process in the course of his demotion to the\nposition of groundskeeper.\n     As outlined above, Loudermill requires that a public employee\nwith a property interest in his or her employment be granted a\nmeaningful pre-termination hearing. Loudermill, 470 U.S. at 545-\n46. We reiterate that it is of paramount importance that this\nhearing take place prior to the deprivation. As explained above,\nabsent compelling government interests justifying postponement of\na hearing, the hearing must take place before the deprivation, seeBoddie,\n401 U.S. at 379; Loudermill, 470 U.S. at 542; Bell, 402\nU.S. at 542, because \"the only meaningful opportunity to invoke the\ndiscretion of the decisionmaker is likely to be before the\ntermination takes effect.\" Id.; see also, Board of Regents v.\nRoth, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108608\"><a href=\"/opinion/108608/board-of-regents-of-state-colleges-v-roth/\"><span class=\"volume\">408</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">564</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 570 n.7 (1972). Indeed, this right to pre-\ndeprivation due process is so fundamental that it remains \"even if\nextensive post-deprivation remedies are afforded.\" Gniotek, 808\nF.2d at 243; see also Morton, 822 F.2d at 368.\n     This pre-deprivation hearing need not be elaborate. As\nexplained by the Supreme Court, \"'something less' than a full\nevidentiary hearing is sufficient prior to adverse administrative\n\faction.\" Loudermill, 470 U.S. at 545 (citations omitted).\nNonetheless, the hearing must be sufficient to inform the employee\nof the evidence against him or her and to respond to the evidence.\nSee Fraternal Order of Police Lodge No. 5 v. Tucker, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"518747\"><a href=\"/opinion/518747/fraternal-order-of-police-lodge-no-5-reginald-adams-willie-carroll/\"><span class=\"volume\">868</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">74</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n80 (3d Cir. 1989). \"[A] sina [sic] qua non of a meaningful hearing\nis a sufficient explanation of the employer's evidence to permit a\nmeaningful response.\" Id.\n     Under the circumstances presented here, where Homar was\nsuspended from his position pending further investigation into his\nactivities, it is clear that there was no compelling government\nissue at stake that would require ESU to immediately deprive Homar\nof his employment. Any concerns about preserving public safety or\nthe integrity of the police force were met by Homar's suspension.\nThe university thus was afforded the time it would need adequately\nto provide Homar a pre-deprivation hearing. The question for us to\nanswer, then, is whether the university provided him such a\nhearing.\n     The district court concluded that the \"administrative hearing\"\nwhich took place on September 18 did not meet the due process\nrequirements of a pre-deprivation hearing because it \"did not allow\n[Homar] to make a meaningful response to the damaging information\nfound in the supplemental report.\" D. Ct. Op., typescript at 15.\nWe agree.\n     During the September 18 meeting, Levanowitz only told Homar\nthat the State Police had given him some \"evidence very serious in\nnature.\" App. at 164. While it safely can be presumed that Homar\nknew that ESU's concerns about his employment arose from his arrest\non drug charges, Homar was not aware of the allegations made\nagainst him by the troopers that were presented in the Supplemental\nReport, namely that he allegedly confessed to knowing that Crompton\nand Habhab were drug dealers and to receiving marijuana from Habhab\nduring his employment as a police officer. More to the point,\nHomar was completely unaware that Levanowitz had received a copy of\nthe Supplemental Report containing these allegations. Under these\ncircumstances it is very clear that Homar's right to a meaningful\npre-deprivation hearing was denied. See Tucker, 868 F.2d at 80\n(holding that suspended police officers who were not told anything\nspecific about drug use allegations or the evidence regarding the\nallegations were deprived of their due process rights because they\nhad no opportunity to explain or rebut evidence).\n     In spite of its conclusion regarding the insufficiency of the\nSeptember 18 \"administrative hearing,\" the district court entered\nsummary judgment in favor of defendants because it concluded that\nHomar's September 24, 1995 meeting with President Gilbert, prior to\nwhich Homar had received and read the Supplemental Report, was a\nmeaningful pre-termination hearing. D. Ct. Op., typescript at 16.\nGiven that Homar was afforded an opportunity to review the\nSupplemental Report and offer meaningful responses to the\nallegations, we find that this meeting afforded Homar with\nsufficient procedural due process protections assuming it took\nplace prior to his demotion becoming effective. While true that an\nemployee is not entitled to a pre-decision hearing, see Chung v.\nPark, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"326905\"><a href=\"/opinion/326905/in-cho-chung-in-no-74-1875-v-lawrence-park-individually-and-as/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">382</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 387 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">423</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">948</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\f(1975), only if this hearing took place before his demotion tookeffect can\nwe conclude that he was afforded meaningful due process.\n      The district court held as a matter of law that Homar's\ndismissal from his position as a police officer took effect only\nafter this meeting with President Gilbert. D. Ct. Op., typescript\nat 16. The district court found that the meeting, which took place\nat 2 p.m. on September 24, 1992, \"occurred before Homar would have\nstarted his evening shift as police officer should Gilbert have\ndecided to reinstate him to that position,\" id., and thus concluded\nthat \"Gilbert's decision that Homar could not return to ESU as a\npolice officer is properly viewed as the point in time when Homar\nwas deprived of his position as an ESU police officer.\" Id.\n     We disagree with the district court that the point in time at\nwhich Homar's demotion became effective is clear. There is\nsubstantial evidence in the record to support a conclusion that\nHomar's demotion took effect prior to this meeting. Homar's\nmeeting with Gilbert took place on September 24 at 2:00 p.m. The\nletter which Levanowitz sent to Homar apprising him that he had\nbeen demoted to Groundskeeper was dated on September 23, 1992. In\nthat letter, Levanowitz informed Homar that he was \"to be demoted\nfrom [his] position as a Police Officer I in the Campus Police\nDepartment to the position of Groundskeeper, a position [he]\nformerly held.\" App. at 208 (emphasis added). The letter further\nrequired that Homar \"report to work at 7:00 A.M. on September 24,\n1992,\" to start his job as groundskeeper, and informed Homar that\nthis \"action is effective retroactive to August 26, 1992.\" App. at\n208 (emphasis added). Homar testified during a deposition that he\nwas already working as a groundskeeper at the time of his September\n24th, 2:00 p.m. meeting with Gilbert. There is thus evidence\nsuggesting that Homar had already been demoted to groundskeeper by\nthe time this meeting took place. If this is true, then Homar was\ndeprived of a meaningful pre-deprivation hearing.\n     The district court based its contrary conclusion on two\ngrounds. First, the court determined that \"[t]he significance of\nthe meeting was that Gilbert held ultimate decision-making\nauthority regarding whether Homar would remain employed by ESU as\na police officer.\" D. Ct. Op., typescript at 15. However, this\nmeeting with Gilbert never would have occurred had Homar's union\nrepresentative not sought to arrange for the meeting with Gilbert.\nApp. at 225. This fact seems to suggest that Levanowitz's demotion\nof Homar would have become effective without Gilbert's approval,\nwhich would render Levanowitz's letter the final demotion.\nLevanowitz's authoritative tone in the letter similarly supports\nthis conclusion.\n     The district court also concluded that the meeting with\nGilbert had taken place prior to Homar's demotion because it\noccurred before 4 p.m., the time at which Homar would normally\nbegin his shift as a police officer. Id. at 16. We disagree that\nthe timing of the demotion is so clear. We think there is\ncertainly an issue of material fact as to whether Homar's demotion\nbecame effective on August 26, as stated in the letter; at 7:00\na.m. on September 24, the date he was told to report to work as a\ngroundskeeper; or at 4:00 p.m. on September 24, the time at which\nHomar would normally report to work as a police officer. Unless\n\fdefendants expected Homar to act as both groundskeeper and police\nofficer on September 24, the facts appear to support the conclusion\nthat Homar's demotion was effective at the latest by 7 a.m. on the\nmorning of September 24th, seven hours prior to his meeting with\nGilbert.\n     We thus conclude that there is a genuine issue of material\nfact regarding the date and time at which Homar's demotion became\neffective, and that the district court's grant of summary judgment\nwas therefore inappropriate.

Ct. Op., typescript at 23, we think that there is\na question of material fact as to whether ESU officials acted in\nbad faith. Several events leading up to Homar's demotion suggest\nthat Levanowitz did not engage in a good faith effort to accord\nHomar appropriate due process protection throughout his ordeal.\nLevanowitz never informed Homar that he had received and read the\nSupplemental Report prior to their September 18 meeting; Levanowitz\nordered that a poll be taken among police officers regarding\nwhether Homar should be allowed to return to the force, which is\ncertainly a very strange proceeding outside the realm of\ntraditional due process proceedings; and Levanowitz issued the\nSeptember 23 letter of demotion prior to the meeting with President\nGilbert -- a meeting which occurred only after Homar's union\nrepresentative requested it take place. Such events might lead a\nreasonable fact-finder to conclude that Homar's demotion was pre-\n\fdetermined and to view the entire demotion process as rigged to\nproduce this result.\n     Our conclusion that there is a genuine issue of material fact\nas to whether ESU officials were motivated by bad faith, however,\ndoes not lead us to remand this matter simply for a factual\nfinding. A more fundamental legal question must first be\naddressed, namely whether Homar's property interest in his state-\ncreated job is an interest worthy of protection under substantive\ndue process.

Specifically, Homar\nalleges that ESU violated his protected liberty interest in two\nways. First, he alleges that ESU seriously damaged his good name\nand reputation by publicly disclosing the charges against him.\nSecond, Homar alleges that ESU imposed a stigma or disability on\nhim, foreclosing his freedom to take advantage of other employment\nopportunities. We will address these two claims in turn.\n                                A.\n     The Supreme Court has held that a person has a liberty\ninterest in employment actions which require due process \"where a\nperson's good name, reputation, honor or integrity is at stake\nbecause of what the government is doing to him.\" Roth, 408 U.S. at\n573. Homar claims that this liberty interest was implicated in the\ninstant case because ESU's demotion of him \"'damage[d] his standing\nand associations in the community.'\" Appellant's Brief at 28\n(citing Roth, 408 U.S. at 573).

We disagree. The article in the newspaper\ndid not disclose any specifics regarding the nature of ESU's\nconcern, nor did it disclose information about the disciplinary\naction ESU contemplated. Furthermore, the article appeared prior\nto his demotion, and there is no evidence to indicate that ESU\npublicly disclosed the outcome of its investigation or the fact\nthat it demoted Homar to groundskeeper. We accordingly find that\nHomar has no liberty interest claim. See Tucker, 868 F.2d at 82\n(holding that no liberty interest was implicated when press release\nabout discharge of police officers was not misleading).\n                                B.\n        Homar further alleges that ESU violated his liberty\ninterest because it imposed \"a stigma . . . that foreclosed his\nfreedom to take advantage of other employment opportunities.\"\nRoth, 408 U.S. at 573. Yet Homar has proffered no evidence to\n\fsuggest that the disciplinary actions taken by the university had\nin any way foreclosed other employment opportunities. Indeed,\nHomar testified at his deposition that he had not sought out a\nposition with any other employer since his demotion. App. at 50.\nFurthermore, as noted above, Homar makes no allegations that any\ninformation in the newspaper article was untrue; the university\nnever even publicly disclosed that Homar was terminated from his\njob as police officer. Under such circumstances, we cannot find\nthat Homar's liberty interest was implicated. Tucker, 868 F.2d at\n83.\n     Accordingly, we affirm the district court's issuance of\nsummary judgment as to this issue.\n                               VI.\n     For the foregoing reasons, we affirm in part, reverse in part\nand remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\nHomar v.

Within a few\nhours of the August 26, 1992, drug raid that resulted in Homar's\narrest, the university learned that Homar had been charged with\npossession of marijuana, possession with intent to deliver\n\fmarijuana, and criminal conspiracy. Homar did not report to work\non August 26 for his 4:00 p.m. to 12:00 p.m. shift. The next day,\nHomar called his police chief to say that he had been arrested and\nto ask whether he was suspended. Homar was informed that he was\nsuspended, and this was confirmed by letter delivered the same\nday.\n     I do not think that the university violated Homar's right to\nprocedural due process when it suspended him from his position as\na campus police officer after learning that he had been arrested\nand charged with drug violations. There was probable cause to\nsupport the criminal charges and hence a substantial assurance that\nthe deprivation was not baseless or unwarranted. The university\nwas certainly entitled to take the position that Homar could not be\npermitted to work as a campus police officer with such charges\noutstanding, and there was thus, as the majority concedes, a\ncompelling government interest present. And the university needed\nto act promptly. The majority admits all of this but finds that\nthe university had to suspend Homar with pay. I find no\nrequirement that in such circumstances a public employer must pay\nits suspended employees.\n     B. In reaching its conclusion to the contrary, the majority\ndeclares that \"a governmental employer may not suspend an employee\nwithout pay unless that suspension is preceded by some kind of pre-\nsuspension hearing.\" Majority Opinion, Typescript at 14. The\nmajority essentially announces a blanket rule that a public\nemployer that wishes to suspend an employee -- even an employee in\na public-safety position who has been charged with multiple\nfelonies -- must either provide a pre-suspension hearing or suspend\nthe employee with pay.

All of these\ndecisions -- like the Supreme Court's procedural due process cases\nin general and unlike the majority's blanket rule -- reflect a\nbalancing of interests based on the particular circumstances of\neach case.\n     I also believe that the majority has misinterpreted our\nopinion in Bradley. Citing Bradley, 913 F.2d at 1077, the majority\nstates that Bradley implies that suspension without pay and without\n\fa pre-suspension hearing always violates due process. Majority\nOpinion, Typescript at 13-14. However, on the next page of the\nBradley opinion, the panel clearly stated:\n     We need not decide in this case whether Bradley was\n     entitled to a pre-suspension hearing, as he contends, or\n     whether a post-suspension hearing sufficed. CompareLoudermill, 470\nU.S. at 544, 105 S.Ct. at 1494 (because\n     government's interest in immediate termination of\n     security guard who had lied when seeking employment did\n     not outweigh employee's interest in retaining employment,\n     pre-termination hearing was required) with FDIC v.\n     Mallen, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112079\"><a href=\"/opinion/112079/fdic-v-mallen/\"><span class=\"volume\">486</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">230</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 108 S.Ct.1780, 1787-88, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112079\"><a href=\"/opinion/112079/fdic-v-mallen/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L.

In my view, far from implying anything, the\nBradley panel expressly reserved decision on the issue presented in\nthis case.\n     I would resolve that issue in this case by following the great\nweight of federal appellate authority cited above and holding that\nwhether a pre-suspension hearing was required in this particular\ncase requires a balancing of the relevant factors. For the reasons\nalready expressed above, I would hold that in the circumstances of\nthis case, a pre-suspension hearing was not required and that a\npost-suspension hearing within a reasonable time after the\nsuspension was sufficient. It may be that the university failed to\nconduct a sufficiently prompt or adequate post-suspension hearing\nafter the criminal charges were dismissed on September 1, 1992, but\nthat is a different question. Moreover, as in Strong, I am not\nsure how a pre-suspension hearing on August 26, 1992, would have\nmade any difference. The only fact important to the university's\ndecision was whether Homar had been arrested and charged. Homar\ndid not dispute this, and in fact confirmed it the next day; Homar\nwas well aware of the reasons for his suspension. As in Strong,\nthe hearing required by the majority would have been \"an empty\nformality.\" See Strong, 902 F.2d at 212.\n     C. I have one final problem with the section of the majority\nopinion dealing with the need for a pre-suspension hearing. The\nmajority assumes that an important government interest requiring\nprompt action is what permits an employer to suspend an employee\nwithout a pre-suspension hearing but with pay. I think that this\nis inaccurate. It is my understanding that a public employer may\ngenerally suspend a public employee for cause, with pay, and\nwithout a hearing -- even absent an emergency situation -- because\nsuch a suspension does not ordinarily implicate any\nconstitutionally protected property interest. See, e.g., Hicks v.\nCity of Watonga, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566909\"><a href=\"/opinion/566909/steven-r-hicks-v-city-of-watonga-oklahoma-a-municipal-corporation-rb/\"><span class=\"volume\">942</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">737</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 746 n.4 (10th Cir. 1991) (\"[N]o\nproperty interest was infringed at Mr. Hicks' first round of\nhearings when he was suspended and then reprimanded.

Town of Amesbury, 851 F.\nSupp. 497, 500 (D. Mass. 1994) (\"A public employee's suspension\nwith pay does not implicate a constitutionally protected property\ninterest.\") (citations omitted). Under the majority's reasoning,\nthe important government interest requiring prompt action is\nrendered a nullity because it simply allows the employer to do what\nit could do in a typical non-emergency, for-cause suspension\nsituation, i.e., suspend the employee with pay.\n\n                               II.\n     Although I do not disagree with the majority's determination\nthat a remand is in order on Homar's substantive due process claim,\nI write separately to set forth my views on the viability of that\nclaim. I do not think that a plaintiff has a substantive due\nprocess claim for a non-legislative deprivation of a state-created\nproperty right by a public employer. Moreover, if Homar has a\nsubstantive due process claim in this context, it seems to me that\nhe must show that the employer's actions were not rationally\nrelated to a legitimate government interest; mere allegations of\nbad faith cannot suffice.\n     A. Neither the Supreme Court nor this court has previously\nheld that a plaintiff has a substantive due process claim for a\nnon-legislative deprivation of a state-created property interest by\na public employer. The Eleventh Circuit recently overruled a\ndecade of its own decisions recognizing such claims.

Essentially for the reasons stated in\nMcKinney, which I find persuasive, I believe that Homar's\nallegations state only procedural due process claims.\n     In McKinney, the Eleventh Circuit considered the following\nissue: \"whether, under the Fourteenth Amendment, a government\nemployee possessing a state-created property interest in his\nemployment states a substantive due process claim, rather than a\nprocedural due process claim, when he alleges that he was deprived\nof the employment interest by an arbitrary and capricious non-\nlegislative government action.\" Id. at 1553. Sitting en banc, a\nunanimous Eleventh Circuit answered \"no,\" and in an effort to bring\nits cases back into line with Supreme Court precedent, overruled a\ndecade of its prior decisions. The court held that \"in non-\nlegislative cases, only procedural due process claims are available\nto pretextually terminated employees.\" Id. at 1560; see alsoRivkin, 671\nA.2d at 577 (plaintiffs' purported substantive due\nprocess claim \"is much closer to a procedural due process claim\" in\nthat it \"amounts to an allegation that the State failed to furnish\nan impartial tribunal, which `is a matter of procedural, not\n\fsubstantive, due process'\") (citations omitted).\n     Two aspects of the Eleventh Circuit's opinion in McKinney bear\nemphasis here. First, the court concluded that allegations of\narbitrary and capricious action by governmental employers affecting\nan individual's property interest in public employment \"will not\nmake out a substantive due process claim under the jurisprudence of\nthe Supreme Court . . . because only procedural issues are\nimplicated.\" Id. at 1559 (emphasis in original); see also id. at\n1561 (\"McKinney's allegation is procedural: the County failed to\nprovide one of the elements of procedural due process -- an\nunbiased decisionmaker.\"). I agree, as I discuss further below.\n     Second, crucial to the court's decision was the distinction\nbetween legislative acts and non-legislative or executive acts.\nExecutive acts, such as employment decisions, typically apply to\none person or to a limited number of persons, while legislative\nacts, generally laws and broad executive regulations, apply to\nlarge segments of society. Id. at 1557 n.9. The court criticized\nits prior decision in Hearn v.

I again agree.\n     Like the prior decisions in the Eleventh Circuit, a decision\nallowing Homar to maintain a substantive due process claim based on\nan allegation of bad faith would elevate Homar's procedural\nchallenges to substantive due process status. Assuming that there\nis a factual issue regarding whether defendants acted in bad faith,\nI question the wisdom of recognizing a substantive due process\nclaim where a university fails to provide adequate procedural due\nprocess and where the way in which procedural due process is denied\ncould give rise to an inference of bad faith. This sort of\n\"substantive procedural due process claim\" is precisely what\ntroubled both the Eleventh Circuit in McKinney and a unanimous New\n\fJersey Supreme Court in Rivkin, and I would not recognize such a\nclaim.

The cases that have applied Pace Resources and Rogin in\nchallenges to non-legislative acts have, in my view, fallen into\nthe trap identified by the Eleventh Circuit in McKinney. I would\nnot extend them into the public employment setting.\n     B. Assuming for the sake of argument that there is a\nsubstantive due process claim for arbitrary and capricious non-\nlegislative actions by public employers and that Homar's interest\nin his position as a campus police officer constituted a \"property\"\ninterest for substantive due process purposes, I nonetheless\nconclude that Homar seeks application of the wrong standard in\nevaluating his claim. Under true rational basis review -- which is\nthe most that Homar is entitled to where he is asserting the\nviolation of a non-fundamental, state-created property interest --\nI think that Homar failed to create a fact issue as to whether the\nuniversity violated his substantive due process rights.\n     The appropriateness of summary judgment as to Homar's\nsubstantive due process claim requires consideration of what Homar\nmust show to establish a substantive due process violation. Homar\nargues that our cases hold that a plaintiff can establish a\nsubstantive due process violation by proving that the government's\nactions were motivated by bias, bad faith, or improper motive.\nHomar contends that a public employee who suffers an adverse\nemployment decision may maintain a substantive due process claim\nagainst the public employer by showing (1) that the employer's\nactions were not rationally related to a legitimate government\ninterest or (2) that the employer's actions were motivated by (a)\nbias, (b) bad faith, or (c) improper motive. I do not agree.\n     First, as I alluded to above, we have never applied this test\nin the public employment context, and I would not extend this test\nto this context, whatever its appropriateness in other contexts.\nFurther, it seems to me that the statements in our opinions\nregarding the nature of rational basis review in substantive due\nprocess cases have evolved in a strange and, I think, unintended\nway. Beginning with unobjectionable descriptions of classical\nrational basis review, our opinions eventually reached the point of\nsuggesting that a plaintiff can state a substantive due process\nclaim merely by alleging that an individual decision resulting in\nthe deprivation of a property right was taken in bad faith. The\nSupreme Court has never sanctioned such a broad proposition, and I\nam confident that this cannot be the law. If a plaintiff like\nHomar has a substantive due process claim in this context, it seems\nto me that he must show that the employer's actions were not\nrationally related to a legitimate government interest and that\nmere allegations of bad faith cannot suffice.\n     In Pace Resources, Inc. v.

It seems to\nme that our cases began looking to governmental conduct that might\nprove a lack of rational basis, but we have now set forth an\nentirely separate test for evaluating substantive due process\nclaims that is independent of standard rational basis review. Seealso\nRivkin, 671 A.2d at 576-77 (declining to follow DeBlasio and\nBello and stating that \"[i]t is a mistake . . . to equate the\nconcept of `arbitrary and irrational' governmental land use\ndecisions with the substantive component of the Due Process Clause\nof the Fourteenth Amendment\"). In my view, the court should take\nthe next available opportunity to clarify that the appropriate test\nis true rational basis review.\n     If we are to recognize substantive due process claims in the\npublic employment context -- which, for the reasons discussed\nabove, I think would be a mistake -- then, in my view, we should\nask merely whether the plaintiff can show that the employer's\nactions were not rationally related to a legitimate government\ninterest. It should not be enough to allege bad faith by a single\ngovernmental actor; the overall conduct complained of must be\nunrelated to any legitimate governmental interest. If this mode of\nanalysis is applied to this case, I think that it is clear that the\nuniversity's actions were rationally related to its legitimate\ninterests, and, indeed, Homar does not contend otherwise.\n     C. In sum, substantive due process applies where there is a\nfundamental right at stake or legislation is challenged as having\nno rational relationship to any legitimate government interest.\nHere, plaintiff suggests no fundamental right within the meaning of\nthe substantive component of the Due Process Clause; nor is\n\fplaintiff challenging a legislative act on rational-basis grounds.\nIn my view, then, plaintiff has no substantive due process claim on\nthe undisputed facts presented.\n\n                               III.\n     For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent from the\nmajority's conclusion, set forth in section III.A, that Homar had\na right to a hearing prior to his suspension. Although I join in\nsection IV of the opinion remanding the substantive due process\nissue to the district court, I do not believe that Homar's\nsubstantive due process claim should survive a motion for summary\njudgment on remand.\n\f</pre>",
