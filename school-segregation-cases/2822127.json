Coutin  appeals.   Because  the  district  court\r<br>\r<br>          employed   a  flawed  methodology  and  relied  on  impermissible\r<br>\r<br>          criteria, we vacate its order and remand for further proceedings.\r<br>\r<br>          I.  BACKGROUND\r          I.  BACKGROUND\r<br>\r<br>                    On December  30, 1993,  the appellant  sued her  former\r<br>\r<br>          employer, defendant-appellee Young &amp; Rubicam of Puerto Rico, Inc.\r<br>\r<br>          (Y&amp;R), an advertising agency, for over $1,500,000 in compensatory\r<br>\r<br>          and punitive  damages.   Her complaint  advanced one  substantive\r<br>\r<br>          federal  claim:   that Y&amp;R had  violated Title  VII of  the Civil\r<br>\r<br>          Rights  Act of  1964,  42  U.S.C.     2000e  to 2000e-17  (1994),\r<br>\r<br>          including  the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, 42 U.S.C.   2000e(k)\r<br>\r<br>          (1994), by (1) assigning Coutin  (who was then pregnant) to tasks\r<br>\r<br>          that were  detrimental to her physical and  emotional health, (2)\r<br>\r<br>          requiring her to work under unsafe conditions, (3) condoning (or,\r<br>\r<br>          at least, neglecting to curb) her coworkers' disparaging comments\r<br>\r<br>          about her gravidity, and (4) constructively discharging her.  The\r<br>\r<br>          complaint  also  included  several claims  under  local  law, the\r<br>\r<br>          elements of  which were  subsumed, without  exception, under  the\r<br>\r<br>                              \r          ____________________\r<br>\r<br>               1Coutin's  spouse  and their  conjugal partnership  are also\r<br>          plaintiffs  and appellants  in this  litigation.   Because  their\r<br>          rights derive from Coutin's, we  opt for simplicity and treat the\r<br>          appeal as if Coutin were the sole plaintiff and appellant.\r<br>\r<br>                                          2\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          broader federal claim.\r<br>\r<br>                    Y&amp;R denied  Coutin's allegations and defended  the suit\r<br>\r<br>          with considerable vigor.  Along the way, the parties attempted to\r<br>\r<br>          reach  an  accord, but  they  came  no closer  than  a demand  of\r<br>\r<br>          $150,000 as against an offer of $15,000.  At trial, the appellant\r<br>\r<br>          (who  had secured  and  retained  other  employment)  offered  no\r<br>\r<br>          evidence of  lost income, and  that aspect of her  original claim\r<br>\r<br>          was  pretermitted.  The  case went to the  jury, which found that\r<br>\r<br>          Y&amp;R had intentionally  discriminated against, and  constructively\r<br>\r<br>          discharged, the appellant, thus violating both federal and Puerto\r<br>\r<br>          Rico law.   The jury awarded the appellant and her spouse a total\r<br>\r<br>          of $44,000 in  compensatory damages, plus an additional $1,538 in\r<br>\r<br>          severance  pay under  Law  80, P.R.  Laws Ann.  tit.  29,    185a\r<br>\r<br>          (1985).   The jury rejected  the appellant's prayer  for punitive\r<br>\r<br>          damages.\r<br>\r<br>                    Y&amp;R, which had  moved unsuccessfully for judgment  as a\r<br>\r<br>          matter of law on several occasions during the trial, renewed that\r<br>\r<br>          motion and asked alternatively for a new trial.  See Fed. R. Civ.\r                                                           ___\r<br>\r<br>          P. 50,  59.   The district court  refused relief.   In  turn, the\r<br>\r<br>          appellant  petitioned under  42 U.S.C.     1988 for  an award  of\r<br>\r<br>          $52,793.75  in  counsel fees  and  related  expenses.    The  fee\r<br>\r<br>          application contained  a sworn statement delineating her lawyer's\r<br>\r<br>          two   decades  of  experience  in  personal  injury,  labor,  and\r<br>\r<br>          discrimination  cases,  as  well  as  extensive,  contemporaneous\r<br>\r<br>          billing  records  that  detailed  the  lawyer's  work  over  four\r<br>\r<br>          calendar years.  At the bottom line, the reckoning reflected out-\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                          3\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          of-court time (250.25 hours) billed at $175 per hour and in-court\r<br>\r<br>          time (45 hours) billed at $200 per hour.\r<br>\r<br>                    Despite this meticulous proffer, the judge eschewed any\r<br>\r<br>          discussion  of  either  the  hours  spent  or the  billing  rates\r<br>\r<br>          assigned and instead awarded the appellant a mere $5,000 in fees.\r<br>\r<br>          The  judge  purported  to  base  his  decision  entirely  on  the\r<br>\r<br>          \"plaintiffs' limited  success on  their  claims, the  plaintiffs'\r<br>\r<br>          willingness  to go  to  trial  despite  the  defendant's  earnest\r<br>\r<br>          efforts to settle the case for a reasonable sum, and the equities\r<br>\r<br>          involved.\"2  This appeal ensued.\r<br>\r<br>          II.

In this  regard,  an abuse  of\r<br>\r<br>          discretion occurs \"when  a material factor deserving  significant\r<br>\r<br>          weight is  ignored, when  an improper factor  is relied  upon, or\r<br>\r<br>          when all  proper and  no improper factors  are assessed,  but the\r<br>\r<br>                              \r          ____________________\r<br>\r<br>               2While the court did not elaborate upon the phrase \"equities\r<br>          involved,\" it is apparently a euphemism for the judge's view that\r<br>          the appellant  had been fortunate to secure a verdict, and that a\r<br>          large  fee  award  therefore  \"would  constitute  an  intolerable\r<br>          windfall.\"   We proceed on the  assumption that this is  what the\r<br>          judge meant.    In all  events,  if the  judge was  referring  to\r<br>          \"equities\" in a broader sense, those equities, to the extent that\r<br>          they  bear on attorney  compensation, are encompassed  within the\r<br>          standard   fee-adjustment  factors.

It\r<br>\r<br>          can refer  to a  plaintiff's success  claim by  claim, or  to the\r<br>\r<br>          relief actually  achieved, or to  the societal importance  of the\r<br>\r<br>          right which has been vindicated,  or to all of these  measures in\r<br>\r<br>          combination.

This\r<br>\r<br>          dissonance makes it  all the more crucial that a nisi prius court\r<br>\r<br>          provide a  clear explanation  when limited  relief furnishes  the\r<br>\r<br>          ostensible justification for a departure from the lodestar.\r<br>\r<br>                    Conscious of these differing configurations, we turn to\r<br>\r<br>          the case  at hand.  The focus of our inquiry is the lower court's\r<br>\r<br>          determination  that the  appellant's  success was  limited  (and,\r<br>\r<br>          thus, justified a fee reduction).\r<br>\r<br>                    We  start by  scrutinizing claims-based  success.   Y&amp;R\r<br>\r<br>          asserts that Coutin's victory was less than complete both because\r<br>\r<br>          the  jury  declined to  grant  punitive damages  and  because the\r<br>\r<br>          appellant did not pursue her original prayer for lost income.  We\r<br>\r<br>          believe  that this riposte  blurs the distinction  between claims\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                          13\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          and  damages.   In  the  fee-shifting context,  a  \"claim\" is  an\r<br>\r<br>          allegation of  a legal injury  comprised of various  elements and\r<br>\r<br>          equivalent to  a  cause  of action,  whereas  \"damages\"  are  the\r<br>\r<br>          compensation  awarded to the  plaintiff who has  suffered a legal\r<br>\r<br>          wrong and who therefore has  a valid claim against the defendant.\r<br>\r<br>          In this case, punitive damages and loss of income (no matter  how\r<br>\r<br>          they are denominated in the complaint) are not failed claims, but\r<br>\r<br>          are  categories  of relief  that  the  jury and  the  appellant's\r<br>\r<br>          subsequent employment history, respectively, have denied her.\r<br>\r<br>                    We  need not linger.  From a claim-by-claim standpoint,\r<br>\r<br>          the  appellant prevailed up and down  the line.  She triumphed on\r<br>\r<br>          every  substantive claim asserted  under both federal  and Puerto\r<br>\r<br>          Rico law.   In so doing, she  achieved a 100% success  rate   and\r<br>\r<br>          complete  success is hardly  \"limited.\"  Consequently,  a claims-\r<br>\r<br>          based, results-obtained fee reduction is wholly inappropriate.\r<br>\r<br>                    From the  standpoint of relief obtained,  the situation\r<br>\r<br>          is more  ambiguous.   After all, it  remains within  the district\r<br>\r<br>          court's discretion to  reduce a fee award in  response to limited\r<br>\r<br>          relief even  in the  presence of  complete claims-based  success.\r<br>\r<br>          See, e.g.,  Cartwright v.

Here,\r<br>\r<br>          however, the damage award is substantial in absolute terms   over\r<br>\r<br>          $45,000   and equals  roughly three times the  appellant's annual\r<br>\r<br>          salary.

BACKGROUND\r          I.  BACKGROUND\r<br>\r<br>                    On December  30, 1993,  the appellant  sued her  former\r<br>\r<br>          employer, defendant-appellee Young &amp; Rubicam of Puerto Rico, Inc.\r<br>\r<br>          (Y&amp;R), an advertising agency, for over $1,500,000 in compensatory\r<br>\r<br>          and punitive  damages.   Her complaint  advanced one  substantive\r<br>\r<br>          federal  claim:   that Y&amp;R had  violated Title  VII of  the Civil\r<br>\r<br>          Rights  Act of  1964,  42  U.S.C.     2000e  to 2000e-17  (1994),\r<br>\r<br>          including  the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, 42 U.S.C.   2000e(k)\r<br>\r<br>          (1994), by (1) assigning Coutin  (who was then pregnant) to tasks\r<br>\r<br>          that were  detrimental to her physical and  emotional health, (2)\r<br>\r<br>          requiring her to work under unsafe conditions, (3) condoning (or,\r<br>\r<br>          at least, neglecting to curb) her coworkers' disparaging comments\r<br>\r<br>          about her gravidity, and (4) constructively discharging her.  The\r<br>\r<br>          complaint  also  included  several claims  under  local  law, the\r<br>\r<br>          elements of  which were  subsumed, without  exception, under  the\r<br>\r<br>                              \r          ____________________\r<br>\r<br>               1Coutin's  spouse  and their  conjugal partnership  are also\r<br>          plaintiffs  and appellants  in this  litigation.   Because  their\r<br>          rights derive from Coutin's, we  opt for simplicity and treat the\r<br>          appeal as if Coutin were the sole plaintiff and appellant.\r<br>\r<br>                                          2\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          broader federal claim.\r<br>\r<br>                    Y&amp;R denied  Coutin's allegations and defended  the suit\r<br>\r<br>          with considerable vigor.  Along the way, the parties attempted to\r<br>\r<br>          reach  an  accord, but  they  came  no closer  than  a demand  of\r<br>\r<br>          $150,000 as against an offer of $15,000.  At trial, the appellant\r<br>\r<br>          (who  had secured  and  retained  other  employment)  offered  no\r<br>\r<br>          evidence of  lost income, and  that aspect of her  original claim\r<br>\r<br>          was  pretermitted.  The  case went to the  jury, which found that\r<br>\r<br>          Y&amp;R had intentionally  discriminated against, and  constructively\r<br>\r<br>          discharged, the appellant, thus violating both federal and Puerto\r<br>\r<br>          Rico law.   The jury awarded the appellant and her spouse a total\r<br>\r<br>          of $44,000 in  compensatory damages, plus an additional $1,538 in\r<br>\r<br>          severance  pay under  Law  80, P.R.  Laws Ann.  tit.  29,    185a\r<br>\r<br>          (1985).   The jury rejected  the appellant's prayer  for punitive\r<br>\r<br>          damages.\r<br>\r<br>                    Y&amp;R, which had  moved unsuccessfully for judgment  as a\r<br>\r<br>          matter of law on several occasions during the trial, renewed that\r<br>\r<br>          motion and asked alternatively for a new trial.  See Fed. R. Civ.\r                                                           ___\r<br>\r<br>          P. 50,  59.   The district court  refused relief.

To  be sure, as\r<br>\r<br>          the  court pointed  out, there  was  a chasmal  gulf between  the\r<br>\r<br>          damages requested in the complaint and the damages awarded.4  The\r<br>                              \r          ____________________\r<br>\r<br>               4In  making this  comparison, the  court  emphasized the  ad\r<br>          damnum.   The use of  the ad damnum  for this purpose  is suspect\r<br>          because the ad damnum is an inherently artificial construct.

Because  this   phenomenon  is   sometimes\r<br>\r<br>          misunderstood, we take some pains to explain it.\r<br>\r<br>                    As Judge  Casellas correctly noted,  the Supreme  Court\r<br>\r<br>          has  identified results obtained as a preeminent consideration in\r<br>\r<br>          the fee-adjustment process.   See Hensley, 461 U.S.  at 432, 440.\r                                        ___ _______\r<br>\r<br>          But  the term \"results obtained\"  has a variety  of meanings.  It\r<br>\r<br>          can refer  to a  plaintiff's success  claim by  claim, or  to the\r<br>\r<br>          relief actually  achieved, or to  the societal importance  of the\r<br>\r<br>          right which has been vindicated,  or to all of these  measures in\r<br>\r<br>          combination.  We think that the  last meaning is the best choice,\r<br>\r<br>          and  that,  as  a  consequence,  all  three  types  of  \"results\"\r<br>\r<br>          potentially bear upon  the amount of an  ensuing fee award.

This\r<br>\r<br>          dissonance makes it  all the more crucial that a nisi prius court\r<br>\r<br>          provide a  clear explanation  when limited  relief furnishes  the\r<br>\r<br>          ostensible justification for a departure from the lodestar.\r<br>\r<br>                    Conscious of these differing configurations, we turn to\r<br>\r<br>          the case  at hand.  The focus of our inquiry is the lower court's\r<br>\r<br>          determination  that the  appellant's  success was  limited  (and,\r<br>\r<br>          thus, justified a fee reduction).\r<br>\r<br>                    We  start by  scrutinizing claims-based  success.   Y&amp;R\r<br>\r<br>          asserts that Coutin's victory was less than complete both because\r<br>\r<br>          the  jury  declined to  grant  punitive damages  and  because the\r<br>\r<br>          appellant did not pursue her original prayer for lost income.  We\r<br>\r<br>          believe  that this riposte  blurs the distinction  between claims\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                          13\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          and  damages.   In  the  fee-shifting context,  a  \"claim\" is  an\r<br>\r<br>          allegation of  a legal injury  comprised of various  elements and\r<br>\r<br>          equivalent to  a  cause  of action,  whereas  \"damages\"  are  the\r<br>\r<br>          compensation  awarded to the  plaintiff who has  suffered a legal\r<br>\r<br>          wrong and who therefore has  a valid claim against the defendant.\r<br>\r<br>          In this case, punitive damages and loss of income (no matter  how\r<br>\r<br>          they are denominated in the complaint) are not failed claims, but\r<br>\r<br>          are  categories  of relief  that  the  jury and  the  appellant's\r<br>\r<br>          subsequent employment history, respectively, have denied her.\r<br>\r<br>                    We  need not linger.  From a claim-by-claim standpoint,\r<br>\r<br>          the  appellant prevailed up and down  the line.

The  court below  offered no\r<br>\r<br>          plausible reason for eschewing the  lodestar method, and no  such\r<br>\r<br>                              \r          ____________________\r<br>\r<br>               10In Aubin, the plaintiff  prevailed on interrelated federal\r                    _____\r<br>          and state claims,  recovering $501 on the former  and $300,000 on\r<br>          the  latter.  782  F.2d at 288.   The district  court reduced the\r<br>          requested attorneys' fees on a  theory much like that advanced by\r<br>          Y&amp;R.   See id.  at 290.  We  overturned that ruling.   See id. at\r                 ___ ___                                         ___ ___\r<br>          292.\r<br>\r<br>                                          19\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          reason springs spontaneously from the record.  It was, therefore,\r<br>\r<br>          error to  forgo the lodestar.   In addition, the court  relied on\r<br>\r<br>          impermissible  criteria in  making  its  non-lodestar fee  award.\r<br>\r<br>          Consequently,  we vacate the  order appealed from  and remand for\r<br>\r<br>          further  proceedings  consistent  with this  opinion.    Costs on\r<br>\r<br>          appeal shall be taxed in favor of the appellant.  Upon the timely\r<br>\r<br>          filing  of a  supplemental  application  in  suitable  form,  the\r<br>\r<br>          district  court  shall  include  in  its  new  fee  award  a  sum\r<br>\r<br>          sufficient  to compensate  the appellant's  counsel for  services\r<br>\r<br>          rendered  in connection with  the successful prosecution  of this\r<br>\r<br>          appeal.\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                    It is so ordered.\r                    It is so ordered.\r                    ________________\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                          20\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br></pre>\n\n</div>",
