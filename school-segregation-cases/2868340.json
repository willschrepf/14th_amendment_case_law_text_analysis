Schurr, a light and sound technician in the\ncasino industry in New Jersey, appeals from an order of the\nDistrict Court granting summary judgment in favor of\nResorts International Hotel, Inc., and Bradford Smith,\nChairman of the New Jersey Casino Control Commission, in\nconnection with Schurr's claims of reverse discrimination in\nhiring.1 In his complaint, Schurr alleged that race was the\ndetermining factor in Resorts' decision not to offer him a\njob which was ultimately filled by an equally well qualified\nminority candidate. Schurr sought declaratory and\ninjunctive relief against Smith, contending that his\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. James R. Hurley, the current Chairman of the Commission, has been\nsubstituted for Smith.\n\n                               2\n\fFourteenth Amendment rights were violated by the\nCommission's regulations establishing minority\nemployment goals. Schurr also alleged that Resorts'\naffirmative action plan as drafted and applied was invalid,\nresulting in violation of his rights under Title VII, 42 U.S.C.\nS 2000e et seq., 42 U.S.C. S 1981, 42 U.S.C. S 1983, the\nNew Jersey Law Against Discrimination, N.J.S. 10:5-1 et\nseq., and the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution. Because we are convinced that the District\nCourt erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the\ndefendants on Schurr's Title VII and other statutory claims,\nwe will reverse that portion of the District Court's Order\nand remand the matter for further proceedings. As to\nSchurr's Fourteenth Amendment claim against the\nCommission Chairman, we will affirm the grant of summary\njudgment in favor of the Chairman on standing grounds,\nalthough for reasons different from those set forth by the\nDistrict Court.\n\nI.\n\nBecause this matter, both legally and factually, arises\nagainst the regulatory background established by the\nCasino Control Commission pursuant to the Casino Control\nAct, N.J.S. 5-12:134, we examine this backgroundfirst. The\nCasino Control Act requires that every casino license holder\nundertake affirmative measures to ensure equal\nemployment opportunities. Relevant regulations require\nthat casino licensees take affirmative steps \"to ensure that\nwomen, minorities and persons with disabilities are\nrecruited and employed at all levels of the operation's work\nforce and treated during employment without regard to\ntheir gender, minority status, or disability.\" N.J.A.C. 19:53-\n4.3(a). Equal opportunity efforts are to be undertaken in all\nemployment practices including promotion, demotion,\nlayoffs and termination. Id. Casino licensees are required to\nimprove the representation of \"[w]omen and minorities in\njob titles within EEOC job categories in which the casino\nlicensee is below the applicable employment goals\nestablished by N.J.A.C. 19-53-4.4.\" See N.J.A.C. 19:53-\n4.3(b)(2). The regulations establish the following goals:\n\n                               3\n\f                               Minority Goal          Female Goal\nEEOC Job Category              (Percentage)           (Percentage)\n\n\nOfficers and Managers          25                     46\nProfessionals                  25                     46\nTechnicians                    25                     46\nSales workers                  25                     46\nOffice and Clerical            25                     46\nCrafts persons                 14                      5\nOperatives                     25                     30\nLaborers                       25                     14\nService Workers                25                     46\n\nN.J.A.C. 19:53-4.4.\n\nIn setting these goals, the Commission reviewed 1990\ncensus data for Atlantic City, New Jersey and for the\nCommission's casino industry work force composition\nanalysis. See 25 N.J.R. 3690 (August 15, 1993). The goals\nfor each category were \"based on the actual number of\nemployees in the comparative work force who were actually\navailable to fill such positions,\" and were set so as not to\nexceed the cumulative Atlantic County work force statistics\nin the given category. Id. In addition,\"if the Atlantic County\navailability statistic falls significantly (more than ten\npercent) below the cumulative Atlantic County work force\nstatistic for that class, the employment goal for that\nparticular EEOC category and class will be the Atlantic\nCounty availability statistic.\" Id.\n\nIn order to meet these goals and as a prerequisite to\nlicensing, each casino licensee is required to develop an\nEqual Employment and Business Opportunity Plan\n(\"EEBOP\"). N.J.A.C. 19:53-6.1. The EEBOP must set forth\na detailed description of \"the means by which the[casino]\nintends to comply with the equal opportunity and\nregulatory obligations imposed by N.J.A.C. 19:53-4.4.\"\nN.J.A.C. 19:53-6.4. While the regulations do not specify the\nmeans which must be used to meet employment goals, the\nterms of the EEBOP are subject to the approval of the\nCommission.\n\nBy statute, the Commission is also charged with\nmonitoring the composition of the workforce at each\n\n                               4\n\flicensed casino. Each licensee is required to file quarterly\nand annual reports with the Commission and the Division\nof Gaming Enforcement on its \"affirmative action efforts . . .\nconcerning [its] operations work force.\" N.J.A.C. 19:53-4.5,\n4.6. The quarterly report must include a listing of the\noperations workforce by race and gender in each EEOC job\ncategory and subclass. Id. Each casino is also required to\nsupply a summary of new hires, promotions, terminations,\nand layoffs, a copy of all grievance reports relating to equal\nemployment opportunity, and a report on the\nimplementation of upward mobility training programs and\nthe status of participants. Id. If in a given quarter the\n\"casino licensee is below the applicable . . . goal established\nby the N.J.A.C. 19:53-4.4 for a job category in which a\nposition with a salary of $35,000 or more is filled by\nsomeone other than a woman or minority, the casino\nlicensee [must] document its efforts to hire or promote a\nwoman or minority to the position.\" N.J.A. 19:53-4.5(c)(2).\nSimilarly, \"each casino licensee whose annual workforce\ncomposition report does not demonstrate that the casino\nlicensee or applicant achieved the applicable employment\ngoals . . . shall be required to document its efforts to\nimplement and comply with the operations workforce\nsection of its EEBOP. . . .\" N.J.A.C. 19:53-4.6.\n\nCasino licensees are also subject to periodic EEBOP\nassessment hearings at which the licensee is required to\ndemonstrate its compliance with its equal opportunity and\naffirmative action obligations. If the Commissionfinds that\nthe licensee has failed to meet performance goals, the\nlicensee must document its good faith efforts to achieve\nthese goals, showing that it has implemented and complied\nwith those portions of its approved EEBOP which relate to\nachievement of performance goals. N.J.A.C. 19-53-6.8.\nShould the Commission determine that a casino licensee\nhas failed to comply with the requirements of the Act, it\nmay impose sanctions. Id. These penalties include, among\nothers, denial, suspension, revocation of, or refusal to\nrenew the casino license, the imposition of license\nconditions, referral of a matter for legal action, assessment\nof civil penalties, and \"other action authorized or permitted\nby the Act.\" N.J.A.C. 19:53-6.11.\n\n                               5\n\fII.\n\nWith the legislative and regulatory background\nestablished, we turn to the facts. In July 1994 Karl Schurr,\na white male resident of New Jersey, sought a position as\na light and sound technician at Resorts in Atlantic City,\nNew Jersey. Schurr had worked at Resorts in a number of\nfull-time jobs from 1974 until 1986 when he resigned in\norder to enter the restaurant business. After June 1986\nSchurr continued to work for Resorts on occasion as a\n\"casual\" worker2 on an\"as needed\" basis.\n\nIn late 1993 a full-time light and sound technician at\nResorts was suspended. While arbitration proceedings\nrelevant to this suspension were pending, Schurr, still\nworking as a casual employee, filled in for the suspended\nemployee on a regular basis. In early July 1994, the labor\narbitration was concluded and the full-time technician's job\nbecame available. Five people, including Schurr, applied for\nthe job.3 Bill Stevenson, Resorts' Director of Show\nOperations and Stage Manager, narrowed those under\nconsideration to Schurr and Ronald Boykin, a black male\nwho was also employed as a casual worker at Resorts. Both\nStevenson and his direct superior, Robert Chambers,\nbelieved that each of the applicants was qualified for the\nopen position. Stevenson viewed the two as equally\nqualified. Acting pursuant to what he believed was required\nby the Resorts EEBOP, Stevenson hired Boykin. Stevenson\nstated that under the EEBOP, the \"technician\"\nclassification was underutilized as of October, 1993, i.e.,\nthe percentage of minorities in the technician category was\n22.25%, but the goal established by the Casino Control\nCommission regulations was 25%. Stevenson stated that he\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. A casual employee is defined in the union contract between Resorts\nand the International Alliance of Theatrical State Employees as \"an\nemployee required to supplement specific classification in the normal\nhouse crew on an intermittent basis.\"\n\n3. At about the same time, Schurr also applied to Resorts for a position\nas an apprentice mechanic. Schurr's complaint alleged reverse\ndiscrimination in Resorts' failure to hire him for this position as well.\nThe District Court found that Schurr failed to establish a prima facie\ncase with respect to this position. Schurr does not appeal that portion of\nthe District Court's ruling.\n\n                               6\n\fbelieved that in an underutilized category, for which there\nwere two equally qualified applicants, he was obligated to\nhire the minority applicant. Chambers, Stevenson's\nsuperior, also believed that Resorts was obligated to hire\nthe minority candidate if one of the two qualified applicants\nfor a position was a minority and Resorts had failed to meet\nstate goals in the relevant category.\n\nAfter learning that he had not been hired for the full-time\ntechnician position, Schurr continued to work as a casual\nemployee at Resorts and at other Atlantic City casinos.4 In\nJanuary 1995 Schurr filed a charge of discrimination with\nthe New Jersey Division of Civil Rights and the EEOC\nalleging discrimination on the basis of race. He received a\nnotice of right to sue on May 7, 1996, and on July 8, 1996,\nSchurr filed this action.\n\nOn January 13, 1997 the parties consented to dismissal\nwith prejudice of all of Schurr's claims against the\nCommission, and to dismissal of the section 1983 claim for\nmonetary damages against the Commission Chairman.\n\nFollowing the close of discovery, the parties filed motions\nfor summary judgment. In an order dated June 30, 1998,\nthe District Court entered an order granting the motions\nfiled by Resorts and the Commission Chairman and\ndenying the motion filed by Schurr. This timely appeal\nfollowed.5\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4. In January 1996, Schurr became a full-time employee of another\nAtlantic City resort. He continues to work at casinos as a casual\nemployee for extra income.\n\n5. The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. S 1331. We\nhave jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. S 1291. Our review of an order\ngranting or denying a motion for summary judgment is plenary. Johnson\nv. Horn, 150 F.3d 276 (3d Cir. 1998). We apply the same test as that\nused by the District Court. We must be satisfied that there is \"no\ngenuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is\nentitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). All\ninferences are to be drawn in favor of the non-moving party. Krouse v.\nAmerican Sterilizer Co., 126 F.3d 494, 500 n.2 (3d Cir. 1997).\n\n                                7\n\fIII.\n\nWe address first whether Schurr has standing to assert\nclaims against the Commission Chairman for declaratory\nand injunctive relief. Schurr contends that his Fourteenth\nAmendment equal protection rights were violated when the\nCommission Chairman enforced the Commission's\nregulations setting minority employment goals and\nrequiring that casino licensees implement affirmative action\nplans designed to meet these goals: \"Smith and the\nCommission's actions in imposing employment goals in\nResorts' [EEBOP] and in approving and monitoring same,\ndirectly resulted in Resorts' denial of the Light and Sound\nTechnician . . . position to Schurr.\" The District Court\ngranted summary judgment in favor of the Commission\nChairman, concluding that Schurr lacked standing to\npursue his claim.\n\nThe standing requirements embodied in the \"case\" or\n\"controversy\" provision of Article III of the United States\nConstitution mandate that in every case, the plaintiff be\nable to demonstrate:\n\n        An \"injury in fact\"-- an invasion of a judicially\n        cognizable interest which is (a) concrete and\n        particularized and (b) actual or imminent, not\n        conjectural or hypothetical; second, [that] there [is] a\n        causal connection between the injury and the conduct\n        complained of -- the injury has to be \"fairly trace[able]\n        to the challenged action of the defendant, and not .. .\n        the result [of] the independent action of some third\n        party not before the court.\" Third, [that] it [is] \"likely,\"\n        as opposed to merely \"speculative,\" that the injury will\n        be redressed by a favorable decision.\"\n\nLujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992)\n(internal citations omitted). Applying these standing\nrequirements to the facts of this case, the District Court\nconcluded, first, that Schurr did not suffer an \"injury in\nfact\" within the meaning of Article III. In Northeastern\nFlorida Chapter of the Associated Gen. Contractors of\nAmerica v. City of Jacksonville, 508 U.S. 656, 666 (1993),\nthe Supreme Court determined that \"the `injury in fact' in\nan equal protection case of this variety is the denial of\n\n                               8\n\fequal treatment resulting from the imposition of[a] barrier\n. . . .\" Relying on this language, the District Court\nconcluded that the challenged regulations constituted\nmerely a means of \"outreach\" to minorities and women, and\ndid not constitute a barrier to others:\n\n        The Commission's affirmative action regulations in\n        general, and the minority and women employment\n        goals in particular [did] not erect a barrier to Schurr's\n        ability to compete fairly for the positions for which he\n        applied . . . . [T]he Commission's regulations mandate\n        that casino licensees reach out to women and minority\n        candidates, not that they prefer women and minorities\n        in actually making hiring decisions. Because Schurr\n        applied, and was seriously considered for the light and\n        sound technician job, he was not injured by Resorts'\n        failure to reach out to him . . . .\n\n         [T]he obvious thrust of the regulations is that . . . a\n        casino licensee should broaden the pool of applicants,\n        not that casino licensees should prefer minorities and\n        women to non-minorities and men in making hiring\n        decisions.\n\n         [N]o hiring preference appears on the face of or is\n        implied by the language of the regulations . . . .\n\nSchurr v. Resorts Int'l Hotel, Inc., 16 F. Supp. 2d 537, 548-\n49 (D.N.J. 1998). The District Court reasoned that because\nthe regulations merely required casino licensees to\n\"broaden the applicant pool by employing various outreach\nefforts,\" they had not injured Schurr. Id. at 549.\n\nThe District Court also concluded that Schurr lacked\nstanding to maintain his claim against the Commission\nChairman because he failed to show a causal link between\nthe relevant regulations and Resorts' decision to hire the\nminority candidate. \"[T]here is only the most attenuated\nrelationship between the Commission's regulations and the\nhiring decisions which allegedly injured or will injure\nSchurr.\" Id. at 550. In the District Court's view, the\nregulations at issue did not mandate a particular\nemployment decision:\n\n        [W]ith respect to the decision not to hire Schurr for the\n        light and sound technician job, Schurr's damage is\n\n                                9\n\f        fairly traceable only to Resorts' actions in implementing\n        its affirmative action plan and Resorts' actions in\n        administering the plan through its employees....\n        Schurr's damage is not, however, traceable as far back\n        as the Commission's regulations.\n\nId. The Court concluded that:\n\n        The \"links in the chain\" between the Commission's\n        regulations and Schurr's alleged injury are \"far too\n        weak as a whole to sustain\" Schurr's standing.\n        Accordingly, I will grant Smith's Motion for Summary\n        Judgment and deny Schurr's Motion for Summary\n        Judgment on his section 1983 claim.\n\nId. (internal citation omitted.)\n\nThe District Court's standing analysis as to both injury in\nfact and causation rested on its characterization of the\nCommission's regulations: \"[These] regulations specifically\ndo not authorize or encourage the use of preference in\nhiring. Instead they specifically provide for other, much\nmore benign methods by which casino licensees may\nexpand the applicant pool.\" Id. at 549-50. According to the\nDistrict Court, \"even the most casual review of the\nCommission's regulations\" reveals that \"the obvious thrust\nof the regulations is that, in order to improve the\nrepresentation of women and minorities . . . a casino\nlicensee should broaden the pool of applicants . . ..\" Id. at\n549.\n\nWe disagree with the District Court's characterization of\nthe regulations. Our reading of both the Act and the\nimplementing regulations convinces us that the regulatory\nscheme challenged here contemplates something beyond\n\"benign methods by which casino licensees may expand the\napplicant pool.\" Id. at 550. The finding that the challenged\nregulations are directed only at recruitment is inconsistent\nwith the language used in the regulations.\n\nThe regulations were drafted to prohibit discrimination by\n\"encouraging businesses to achieve a balanced\nrepresentation of employees at all levels of the work force,\"\nN.J.A.C. 15:32-1.1, and to ensure that \"affirmative efforts\nare made to recruit and employ\" minorities, N.J.A.C. 19:53-\n\n                                10\n\f1.4 (emphasis added). Affirmative efforts are to address,\nwithout limitation, all employment practices including:\n\n        (1) employment promotion, demotion or transfer;\n\n        (2) recruitment, recruitment advertising or postin g;\n\n        (3) layoff or termination;\n\n        (4) rates of pay and other forms of compensation o r\n        benefits;\n\n        (5) selection for training and upward mobility\n        programs; and;\n\n        (6) grievance procedures for, and disposition of,\n        complaints related to equal employment opportunity.\n        . . .\n\nN.J.A.C. 19.53-4.3. If a casino licensee fails to meet the\nestablished goal, the licensee is required to document its\ngood faith efforts to hire a qualified female or minority\ncandidate for the position. N.J.A.C. 19:53-4.3.\n\nThe broad language used throughout the regulations as\na whole undermines both the District Court's conclusion\nthat the scheme is addressed to recruitment alone and its\ndisposition of the standing issue on the basis of that\nconclusion. We agree with the District Court that the\nregulations do not mandate specific hiring decisions. We\nare convinced, however, that in setting employment goals\nfor women and minorities, in monitoring compliance with\nthese goals, and in providing for sanctions if casino\nlicensees cannot demonstrate good faith efforts to comply\nwith those goals, the regulations were intended to influence\nemployment decisions generally and may, as here, affect\nconcrete decisions; for example, which of two equally\nqualified job candidates will be hired.\n\nThis conclusion is supported by the testimony of the\nResort employees responsible for hiring under the EEBOP.\nThey testified that they believed that the regulations and\nthe EEBOP formulated and reviewed pursuant to those\nregulations required that they hire the minority candidate\nover Schurr. Given the candidates' comparable\nqualifications, those responsible for hiring at Resorts were\nunable to justify hiring Schurr where the technician job\n\n                               11\n\fcategory was underutilized. Furthermore, they did not want\nto bear the administrative burden of having to do so. This\nevidence supports the conclusion that the regulations set\nemployment goals, and place administrative pressure upon\ncasino licensees to meet these goals. The fact that the\nregulations do not explicitly require minority hiring or\nmandate a race-based decision is not dispositive of the\ncausation question.\n\nAlthough it was decided under a somewhat different set\nof facts, our causation analysis is guided by the discussion\nset forth by our sister Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit\nin Bras v. California Public Utilities, 59 F.3d 869 (9th Cir.\n1995), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1084 (1996). In Bras, the\ncourt considered an equal protection challenge to a\nCalifornia statute, the California Women and Minority\nBusiness Enterprise Law, which required nongovernmental\ncontractors to meet minority participation goals. Pursuant\nto this law, the California Public Utilities Commission was\ndirected to formulate goals for state utilities in the\nprocurement of goods and services from minority-owned\nbusinesses. In 1988, the Commission promulgated an order\nrequiring each state utility to establish a \"goal\" specifying\nthat it would purchase at least fifteen percent of its utilities\nrequirements from minority firms.\n\nIn response to this Order, in 1991, Pacific Bell provided\na prequalification form to a number of architectural firms\nfrom which it expected to receive proposals for future work.\nThis form required the firms to specify whether they were\ncertified as a minority or women enterprise. Bras submitted\nits form, stating that it was not so certified. Because it was\nnot a minority enterprise, Bras was not selected as one of\nthe firms eligible to bid on Pacific Bell projects.\n\nBras filed suit in federal court alleging that the Law and\nthe Order violated the requirements of the Equal Protection\nClause. Bras also sought a permanent injunction\npreventing the Commission from implementing the goals\nprovided for in the Law and the Order. The district court\ndismissed Bras' claim for lack of standing.\n\nOn appeal, a majority of the Court held that Bras had\nsatisfied the standing requirements and should have been\n\n                               12\n\fpermitted to pursue the request for injunctive relief.6 The\nCourt found that although the challenged Law and Order\nset \"goals\" and not set-asides, they had the practical effect\nof placing the Bras firm on unequal footing in competing for\nbusiness. According to the Court of Appeals, the\"economic\nreality\" created by both the Law and the Order was the\nrequirement that California utilities adopt discriminatory\nprograms, or risk sanction. As a result, the Court held that\nthere was a connection between Bras' injury and\nimplementation of the Law and Order sufficient to satisfy\nthe causation element of the standing analysis.\n\nWe do not find any meaningful distinction between the\ngoals at issue in Bras and those challenged here. The\nchallenged goal-based regulations, like those at issue in\nBras, clearly have the practical effect of encouraging (if not\noutright compelling) discriminatory hiring.\n\nThat employment goals may, in some circumstances,\ncreate a classification based on race was also recognized by\nthe Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in\nLutheran Church-Missouri Synod v. FCC, 141 F.3d 344 (D.C.\nCir.), reh'g denied, 154 F.3d 487 (D.C. Cir.), and reh'g en\nbanc denied, 154 F.3d 494 (D.C. Cir. 1998). There the\nCourt addressed the impact of the FCC's regulatory\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6. The Bras court determined that the question of standing was\ncontrolled by the Supreme Court's holding in Northeastern Florida\nChapter of the Associated Gen. Contractors v. City of Jacksonville, 508\nU.S. 656, 666 (1993), and that the \"injury in fact\" associated with\nminority preference programs is \"the inability to compete on an equal\nfooting in the bidding process, not the loss of a contract.\" Bras, 59 F.3d\nat 873. The court concluded that Bras satisfied this \"injury in fact\"\nrequirement by stating that he wanted to \"reinstate\" his eligibility to\nbid\non Pacific Bell projects \"in the future\" and that he was \"ready, willing\nand able\" to provide services to Pacific Bell. Id. at 873-74. Tracking\nthis\nlanguage, Schurr here asserts that he is \"ready, willing and able\" to work\nat Resorts. As discussed infra, this allegation does not itself resolve\nthe\nissue of whether Schurr has established a sufficiently imminent injury to\nbe entitled to forward-looking relief. That issue is governed by Adarand\nConstructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200, 211 (1995), a decision that\nissued shortly after and was therefore not addressed in Bras. Moreover,\nunlike the situation in Bras, the evidence in this case indicates that\nSchurr has in fact been repeatedly subject to the challenged regulations,\nwithout apparent adverse consequence.\n\n                               13\n\frequirement that radio stations adopt affirmative action\nprograms incorporating numerical goals, based on\npopulation data, for hiring women and minorities. In\ndetermining that goals similar to those at issue here\ncreated minority preferences subject to equal protection\nanalysis, the Court of Appeals noted that the crucial point\nis not whether the regulations required quotas, but rather\nwhether they obliged stations to grant some degree of\npreference to minorities in hiring. Concluding that the\nchallenged regulations granted such a preference, the court\nexplained:\n\n        The entire scheme is built on the notion that stations\n        should aspire to a workforce that attains, or at least\n        approaches, proportional representation. . . . The very\n        term \"under-representation\" necessarily implies that if\n        such a situation exists, the station is falling short of\n        the desired outcome. The regulations pressure stations\n        to maintain a workforce that mirrors the racial\n        breakdown of their \"metropolitan statistical area.\"\n\n        . . .\n\n        Although it was urged that . . . \"goals\" should be\n        treated differently than obligatory set asides . . . we do\n        not think it matters whether a government hiring\n        program imposes hard quotas, soft quotas, or goals.\n        Any one of these techniques induces an employer to\n        hire with an eye toward meeting the numerical target.\n        As such, they can and surely will result in individuals\n        being granted a privilege because of their race.\n\nLutheran Church-Missouri Synod v. FCC, 141 F.3d 351-52,\n354.\n\nHowever, our conclusion that the District Court erred\nboth in characterizing the regulations at issue and in\nholding that Schurr failed to establish causation does not\nmandate reversal, for there is another component of the\nstanding inquiry that is at issue.\n\nSchurr's sole equal protection claim against the\nCommission Chairman is for forward-looking declaratory\nand injunctive relief. In order to have standing to challenge\nfuture rather than past application of the regulation,\n\n                                14\n\fSchurr must allege that the setting of minority employment\ngoals for job categories within the casino industry \"in the\nfuture constitutes `an invasion of a legally protected interest\nwhich is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) actual or\nimminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.' \" Adarand\nConstructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200, 211 (1995)\n(quoting Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. at 560).\nUnder this standard, Schurr must demonstrate that he will\nin the future be prevented from competing on an equal\nbasis with minority candidates; i.e., Schurr must show that\nthe employment goals embodied in the challenged\nregulations will cause \"imminent\" injury. The District Court\nheld that Schurr failed to do so. Schurr, 16 F. Supp. 2d at\n551. We agree.\n\nSchurr's evidence in support of his claim that he is in\ndanger of imminent injury in fact supports the opposite\nconclusion. For example, Schurr testified at his deposition\nthat since January 1996, he has held a full-time position as\nan engineer at another casino. The engineering position\nappears to be one covered by the challenged regulations\n(under either the \"professional\" or \"technician\" category).\nSchurr also testified that in addition to this full-time work,\nhe has obtained part-time casino work -- at Resorts as well\nas at least five other casinos -- \"filling in\" for extra money.\nThe part-time work appears to be that of a technician. This\nevidence indicates that since being denied the full-time\ntechnician's job in 1994, Schurr repeatedly has been\nsubjected to the regulations, with no apparent adverse\neffect.\n\nIn evaluating Schurr's evidence of imminent harm, we are\nalso mindful of what is not in the record. There is no\nevidence of how frequently jobs for which Schurr is\nqualified become available.7 There is no evidence of how\nfrequently Schurr must compete with women or minorities\nfor those jobs. There is no evidence as of whether Schurr\nhas been denied any other job for which he applied-- or\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n7. Such evidence is of obvious important to the imminence issue. For\nexample, Schurr testified at this deposition that he rarely works at \"the\nSands\" merely because \"they don't do much.\" The challenged regulations\nthus played no part in Schurr's inability to work at the Sands.\n\n                               15\n\fthe reason for such denial. Nor is there any evidence of\nwhether any of the other casinos at which Schurr might\napply have met their relevant goals, or whether they, like\nResorts, consider the \"goals\" to mandate hiring preferences.\nThis record is therefore distinguishable from that in\nAdarand, which supported a finding that Adarand had\nestablished a threat of \"imminent injury\" necessary to\nmaintain its claim for forward-looking relief. The evidence\nin Adarand included statistical evidence of how frequently\nthe relevant contracts came up for bid; evidence that\nAdarand bid on every such contract in Colorado, and was\n\"very likely\" to bid on future contracts; and evidence that\nAdarand \"often\" had to compete against businesses certified\nunder the challenged program. Adarand, 515 U.S. at 212.\nWe also note the statement in Lujan that \" `some day'\nintentions\" are insufficient to establish an imminent injury.\nLujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 564 (1992).\n\nIn sum, Schurr failed to make an adequate showing that\nhe is in danger of suffering imminent injury as a result of\nthe challenged regulations. Accordingly, we will affirm the\norder of the District Court granting summary judgment in\nfavor of the Commission Chairman, limited in accordance\nwith our foregoing discussion.\n\nIV.\n\nWe focus next on Schurr's claim that Resorts violated the\nrequirements of Title VII when it made race a factor in the\ndecision not to hire Schurr.\n\nBecause the District Court, after extensive analysis,\nrejected Schurr's equal protection claim for lack of standing,8\nit conducted only a cursory Title VII analysis.9 Generally,\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n8. Our decision with respect to Schurr's standing to pursue forward-\nlooking relief on his equal protection claim applies as well to any claim\nfor forward-looking relief under Title VII or the related statutes that\nSchurr asserts.\n\n9. For example, the District Court concluded the Commission's\naffirmative action regulations were enacted to remedy a manifest\nimbalance because it found the regulations set forth \"employment goals\non a category by category basis\" and \"distinguishe[d] between skilled and\nunskilled workers.\" But under Weber, a court determines whether a\nmanifest imbalance existed by examining the racial makeup of the labor\nforce.\n\n                               16\n\fcourts of appeals should not decide the legality of an\naffirmative action program in the absence of careful district\ncourt analysis of the merits. In most cases, a district\ncourt's analysis of why an affirmative action plan was\nadopted and how the plan affects non-minorities is crucial\nto thorough and effective appellate review of the plan. See\nWygant v. Jackson Bd. of Educ., 476 U.S. 267, 277-78\n(1986) (plurality opinion) (stating that in the absence of\ndistrict court's analysis an \"appellate court reviewing a\nchallenge by nonminority employees to remedial action\ncannot determine whether the race-based action is justified\nas a remedy for prior discrimination\"); In re Birmingham\nReverse Discrimination Employment Litig., 20 F.3d 1525,\n1539-40 (11th Cir. 1994) (stating that district court\nfindings of fact are \"necessary\" to appellate review and that\nin their absence \"appellate court has no basis upon which\nto determine whether race-based action was justified as a\nremedy\"); Conlin v. Blanchard, 890 F.2d 811, 815 (6th Cir.\n1989) (refusing to decide legality of affirmative action\nprogram because, inter alia, district court did not make\nfindings of fact regarding past discrimination). In most\ncases, therefore, the better course is to remand and\ninstruct the district court to conduct this analysis. But this\nis an atypical case; here, the record on summary judgment\nmakes clear that Resorts' plan was not adopted to remedy\na manifest imbalance in traditionally segregated job\ncategories. Accordingly, based on that record, we will\nassess whether Resorts' plan violates Title VII.\n\nThe terms of Title VII are violated when an employer\ntakes action \"to discriminate against any individual with\nrespect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges\nof employment\" or \"to limit, segregate, or classify his\nemployees ... in any way which would deprive or tend to\ndeprive any individual of employment opportunities or\notherwise affect his status as an employee\" on the basis of\n\"race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\" 42 U.S.C.\nS 2000e - 2(a). Although this language was initially\nconstrued as absolute -- prohibiting all discrimination in\nemployment, see e.g. Johnson v. Transportation Agency,\nSanta Clara County, 480 U.S. 616, 643 (1987)-- it is clear\nnow that in certain circumstances, race-based employment\n\n                               17\n\fdecisions made pursuant to an affirmative action plan do\nnot run afoul of the statute.\n\nWe considered affirmative action efforts in the context of\na Title VII action in Taxman v. Board of Educ., 91 F.3d\n1547 (3d Cir. 1996), cert. dismissed, 118 S.Ct. 595 (1997).\nThere, we cited the Supreme Court's decision in United\nSteelworkers v. Weber, 443 U.S. 193, 208 (1979), that:\n\"Title VII's prohibition against racial discrimination is not\nviolated by affirmative action plans which, first, `have\npurposes that mirror those of the statute' and second, `do\nnot unnecessarily trammel the interests of the [non-\nminority] employees.' \" 91 F.3d at 1550. 10\n\nIn order to determine the purpose underlying Title VII, we\nanalyzed Supreme Court precedent in light of the plain\nlanguage of Title VII, and concluded that:\n\n        Title VII was enacted to further two primary goals: to\n        end discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion,\n        sex or national origin, thereby guaranteeing equal\n        opportunity in the workplace, and to remedy the\n        segregation and under-representation of minorities that\n        discrimination has caused in our nation's workforce.\n\nId. at 1556. We placed particular emphasis on the remedial\ncomponent of Title VII, finding it central to the Title VII\nscheme:\n\n        The significance of [the] second corrective purpose\n        cannot be overstated. It is only because Title VII was\n        written to eradicate not only discrimination per se but\n        the consequences of prior discrimination as well, that\n        racial preferences in the form of affirmative action can\n        co-exist with the Act's antidiscrimination mandate.\n\nId. We then announced the following rule which now guides\nour discussion of Schurr's Title VII claim and Resorts'\naffirmative action plan: \"Unless an affirmative action plan\nhas a remedial purpose, it cannot be said to mirror the\npurposes of the statute, and, therefore, cannot satisfy the\nfirst prong of the Weber test.\" Id.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n10. This two-prong test announced in Weber was reaffirmed in Johnson\nv. Transportation Agency, Santa Clara County, 480 U.S. 616 (1987).\n\n                                18\n\fThe parties in this matter agree that Schurr has\nestablished a prima facie case of race-based employment\ndiscrimination11 and that Resorts rested its decision not to\nhire Schurr on the terms of its affirmative action policy.\nHere, then, as was the case in Taxman, \"The dispositive\nliability issue ... is the validity of [Resorts'] policy under\nTitle VII.\" Id.\n\nWe have carefully reviewed the record in this matter and\nare convinced that the affirmative action plan offered to\nrebut Schurr's prima facie case lacks the remedial purpose\nrequired by controlling precedent. In order to be\ncharacterized accurately as remedial, an affirmative action\nplan must be designed to correct a \"manifest imbalance in\ntraditionally segregated job categories.\" Weber, 443 U.S. at\n207. \"The requirement that `manifest imbalance' relate to a\ntraditionally segregated job category `provides assurance\n. . . that race will be taken into account in a manner\nconsistent with Title VII's purpose of eliminating the effects\nof employment discrimination . . .\" Johnson, 480 U.S. 650\n(emphasis added).\n\nUnder our reasonable interpretation of this standard,\nResorts' affirmative action plan is deficient. The plan itself\nand the regulations which mandate the plan were not\nbased on any finding of historical or then-current\ndiscrimination in the casino industry or in the technician\njob category; the plan was not put in place as a result of\nany manifest imbalance or in response to a finding that any\nrelevant job category was or ever had been affected by\nsegregation.12 Indeed, the case now before us is an unusual\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n11. We analyze Schurr's Title VII claim under the approach set forth in\nMcDonnell Douglas v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973). When a plaintiff\nestablishes a prima facie case, the burden of production shifts to the\nemployer to show a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the decision.\nThe decision in Johnson, 480 U.S. at 626, establishes that one such\nreason may be an affirmative action plan. If the employer is able to meet\nthis burden of production, the burden shifts back to the employee to\ndemonstrate that the nondiscriminatory reason offered is pretextual, i.e.\nthat the affirmative action plan is invalid.\n\n12. Evidence that a manifest imbalance existed either before or after\nResorts enacted its plan would have sufficed. See Wygant v. Jackson Bd.\n\n                               19\n\fone in that there is no disagreement as to whether Resorts'\nplan or the challenged regulations were intended to remedy\npast or present discrimination. They were not. In a\ndeposition, Gustave Thomas, the designated Commission\nrepresentative, testified as follows:\n\n           Q: Now prior to issuing the employment goals\n              in the Commission's regs, did the\n              Commission itself ever practice\n              discrimination?\n\n        Thomas: No, not to my knowledge.\n\n           Q: Was there ever any finding that the state\n              had discriminated with regard to the various\n              job categories and the employment goals\n              pursuant to those categories issued by the\n              Commission regs?\n\n           A: Not to my knowledge.\n\n           Q: The casinos, from the inception of the casino\n              industry in Atlantic City, have always needed\n              to have the employment goals pursuant to\n              those categories issued by the Commission\n              rep?\n\n           A: That's correct.\n\nThe remainder of the record contains nothing to suggest\nthat the Act or the regulations promulgated pursuant to\nthat Act were drafted or enacted with an intent to remedy\nany discrimination. The Commission does not contend\notherwise. On appeal, the Commission makes the following\nstatement relevant to the purpose underlying the Act and\nthe regulations:\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nof Educ., 476 U.S. 267, 291 (1986) (O'Connor, J., concurring);\nContractors Ass'n of Eastern Penna., Inc. v. City of Philadelphia, 6 F.3d\n990, 1004 (3d Cir. 1993) (admitting post-enactment evidence); see also\nCoral Constr. Co. v. King County, 941 F.2d 910, 921 (9th Cir. 1991)\n(explaining that refusing to admit post-enactment evidence places\nmunicipalities in the \"dilemma of deciding whether to wait the months\nnecessary for further development of the record, risking . . . culpability\n[to Blacks] due to inaction, or to act and risk liability [to Whites] for\nacting prematurely but otherwise justifiably.\")\n\n                                20\n\f        The Legislature recognized that a once renowned\n        tourist area had become blighted and had been largely\n        abandoned by tourists. The Legislature was also aware\n        Atlantic City had and has a large minority population,\n        and sought to ensure that the job creation which\n        would accompany casino developments would benefit\n        all segments of the population.\n\nThis absence of any reference to or showing of past or\npresent discrimination in the casino industry is fatal. The\naffirmative action plan relied on by Resorts in this Title VII\naction is invalid under the first prong of Weber13 and\n\"cannot form the basis for deviating from the\nantidiscrimination mandate of Title VII.\" Taxman, 91 F.3d\nat 1563. Schurr, therefore, is entitled to summary\njudgment on the Title VII claim.\n\nV.\n\nOur disposition of Schurr's Title VII claim dictates\nreversal of the District Court's grant of summary judgment\nin favor of Resorts on Schurr's claims based on the NJLAD\nand on section 1981.\n\nAnalysis of a claim made pursuant to the NJLAD\ngenerally follows analysis of a Title VII claim. We predicted\nin Taxman that the New Jersey Supreme Court considering\nan affirmative action plan in light of the NJLAD \"would\nfollow the analytical directive of Weber and Johnson.\" 91\nF.3d at 1564. The result under the NJLAD would, therefore,\nbe the same as that reached in our Title VII analysis.\nSchurr is entitled to summary judgment on his claim made\nunder the NJLAD.\n\nThe result is similar with respect to Schurr's claim based\non 42 U.S.C. S 1981. While a valid affirmative action plan\nserves as a defense to an action under section 1981, the\nstandard for evaluating the validity of a plan is identical to\nthe standard developed in Title VII cases. Setser v. Novack\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n13. Because we conclude that Resorts' plan fails the first part of the\nWeber test, we do not address whether the plan passes the second part\nof that test; i.e., whether it \"unnecessarily trammel[s] the interests of\n[non-minority] employees.\" Weber, 443 U.S. at 207-08.\n\n                                21\n\fInvestment Co., 657 F.2d 962, 968 (8th Cir. 1981). In light\nof our conclusion that the Resorts' affirmative action plan\nwas invalid for purposes of Title VII, we also conclude that\nthe plan cannot serve as a defense to Schurr's section 1981\nclaim. The grant of summary judgment in favor of Resorts\non this claim was, therefore, inappropriate. As the District\nCourt recognized, \"In the Third Circuit, the elements of\nemployment discrimination under Title VII are identical to\nthe elements of a section 1981 claim.\" Schurr, 16 F.\nSupp.2d at 556. Schurr was entitled to summary judgment\nunder Title VII and should have been granted summary\njudgment on the section 1981 claim as well.\n\nBecause the District Court granted summary judgment in\nfavor of the defendants on the Title VII and related\nstatutory claims, it did not, of course, consider the question\nof damages. Based on our holding in this matter, an\nassessment of damages is required. As the record is\nunderstandably devoid of evidence bearing on this\nassessment, we will remand this matter to the District\nCourt for further proceedings.\n\nVI.\n\nWe find that the District Court properly granted\nsummary judgment in favor of the Commission Chairman\non Schurr's equal protection claim and will, therefore,\naffirm the Order of the District Court with respect to that\nclaim. We find that the District Court erred in granting\nsummary judgment in favor of Resorts on claims made\npursuant to Title VII, Section 1981, and the NJLAD, and\nwill direct that summary judgment be entered in favor of\nSchurr on these claims. This matter will be remanded to\nthe District Court for consideration of damages under Title\nVII and the related statutes.\n\nA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\n        Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n        for the Third Circuit\n\n                               22\n\f",

Schurr, a light and sound technician in the\ncasino industry in New Jersey, appeals from an order of the\nDistrict Court granting summary judgment in favor of\nResorts International Hotel, Inc., and Bradford Smith,\nChairman of the New Jersey Casino Control Commission, in\nconnection with Schurr's claims of reverse discrimination in\nhiring.1 In his complaint, Schurr alleged that race was the\ndetermining factor in Resorts' decision not to offer him a\njob which was ultimately filled by an equally well qualified\nminority candidate. Schurr sought declaratory and\ninjunctive relief against Smith, contending that his\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. James R. Hurley, the current Chairman of the Commission, has been\nsubstituted for Smith.\n\n                               2\n\fFourteenth Amendment rights were violated by the\nCommission's regulations establishing minority\nemployment goals. Schurr also alleged that Resorts'\naffirmative action plan as drafted and applied was invalid,\nresulting in violation of his rights under Title VII, 42 U.S.C.\nS 2000e et seq., 42 U.S.C. S 1981, 42 U.S.C. S 1983, the\nNew Jersey Law Against Discrimination, N.J.S. 10:5-1 et\nseq., and the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution. Because we are convinced that the District\nCourt erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the\ndefendants on Schurr's Title VII and other statutory claims,\nwe will reverse that portion of the District Court's Order\nand remand the matter for further proceedings. As to\nSchurr's Fourteenth Amendment claim against the\nCommission Chairman, we will affirm the grant of summary\njudgment in favor of the Chairman on standing grounds,\nalthough for reasons different from those set forth by the\nDistrict Court.\n\nI.\n\nBecause this matter, both legally and factually, arises\nagainst the regulatory background established by the\nCasino Control Commission pursuant to the Casino Control\nAct, N.J.S. 5-12:134, we examine this backgroundfirst. The\nCasino Control Act requires that every casino license holder\nundertake affirmative measures to ensure equal\nemployment opportunities. Relevant regulations require\nthat casino licensees take affirmative steps \"to ensure that\nwomen, minorities and persons with disabilities are\nrecruited and employed at all levels of the operation's work\nforce and treated during employment without regard to\ntheir gender, minority status, or disability.\" N.J.A.C. 19:53-\n4.3(a). Equal opportunity efforts are to be undertaken in all\nemployment practices including promotion, demotion,\nlayoffs and termination. Id. Casino licensees are required to\nimprove the representation of \"[w]omen and minorities in\njob titles within EEOC job categories in which the casino\nlicensee is below the applicable employment goals\nestablished by N.J.A.C. 19-53-4.4.\" See N.J.A.C. 19:53-\n4.3(b)(2). The regulations establish the following goals:\n\n                               3\n\f                               Minority Goal          Female Goal\nEEOC Job Category              (Percentage)           (Percentage)\n\n\nOfficers and Managers          25                     46\nProfessionals                  25                     46\nTechnicians                    25                     46\nSales workers                  25                     46\nOffice and Clerical            25                     46\nCrafts persons                 14                      5\nOperatives                     25                     30\nLaborers                       25                     14\nService Workers                25                     46\n\nN.J.A.C. 19:53-4.4.\n\nIn setting these goals, the Commission reviewed 1990\ncensus data for Atlantic City, New Jersey and for the\nCommission's casino industry work force composition\nanalysis. See 25 N.J.R. 3690 (August 15, 1993). The goals\nfor each category were \"based on the actual number of\nemployees in the comparative work force who were actually\navailable to fill such positions,\" and were set so as not to\nexceed the cumulative Atlantic County work force statistics\nin the given category. Id. In addition,\"if the Atlantic County\navailability statistic falls significantly (more than ten\npercent) below the cumulative Atlantic County work force\nstatistic for that class, the employment goal for that\nparticular EEOC category and class will be the Atlantic\nCounty availability statistic.\" Id.\n\nIn order to meet these goals and as a prerequisite to\nlicensing, each casino licensee is required to develop an\nEqual Employment and Business Opportunity Plan\n(\"EEBOP\"). N.J.A.C. 19:53-6.1. The EEBOP must set forth\na detailed description of \"the means by which the[casino]\nintends to comply with the equal opportunity and\nregulatory obligations imposed by N.J.A.C. 19:53-4.4.\"\nN.J.A.C. 19:53-6.4. While the regulations do not specify the\nmeans which must be used to meet employment goals, the\nterms of the EEBOP are subject to the approval of the\nCommission.\n\nBy statute, the Commission is also charged with\nmonitoring the composition of the workforce at each\n\n                               4\n\flicensed casino. Each licensee is required to file quarterly\nand annual reports with the Commission and the Division\nof Gaming Enforcement on its \"affirmative action efforts . . .\nconcerning [its] operations work force.\" N.J.A.C. 19:53-4.5,\n4.6. The quarterly report must include a listing of the\noperations workforce by race and gender in each EEOC job\ncategory and subclass. Id. Each casino is also required to\nsupply a summary of new hires, promotions, terminations,\nand layoffs, a copy of all grievance reports relating to equal\nemployment opportunity, and a report on the\nimplementation of upward mobility training programs and\nthe status of participants. Id. If in a given quarter the\n\"casino licensee is below the applicable . . . goal established\nby the N.J.A.C. 19:53-4.4 for a job category in which a\nposition with a salary of $35,000 or more is filled by\nsomeone other than a woman or minority, the casino\nlicensee [must] document its efforts to hire or promote a\nwoman or minority to the position.\" N.J.A. 19:53-4.5(c)(2).\nSimilarly, \"each casino licensee whose annual workforce\ncomposition report does not demonstrate that the casino\nlicensee or applicant achieved the applicable employment\ngoals . . . shall be required to document its efforts to\nimplement and comply with the operations workforce\nsection of its EEBOP. . . .\" N.J.A.C. 19:53-4.6.\n\nCasino licensees are also subject to periodic EEBOP\nassessment hearings at which the licensee is required to\ndemonstrate its compliance with its equal opportunity and\naffirmative action obligations. If the Commissionfinds that\nthe licensee has failed to meet performance goals, the\nlicensee must document its good faith efforts to achieve\nthese goals, showing that it has implemented and complied\nwith those portions of its approved EEBOP which relate to\nachievement of performance goals. N.J.A.C. 19-53-6.8.\nShould the Commission determine that a casino licensee\nhas failed to comply with the requirements of the Act, it\nmay impose sanctions. Id. These penalties include, among\nothers, denial, suspension, revocation of, or refusal to\nrenew the casino license, the imposition of license\nconditions, referral of a matter for legal action, assessment\nof civil penalties, and \"other action authorized or permitted\nby the Act.\" N.J.A.C. 19:53-6.11.\n\n                               5\n\fII.\n\nWith the legislative and regulatory background\nestablished, we turn to the facts. In July 1994 Karl Schurr,\na white male resident of New Jersey, sought a position as\na light and sound technician at Resorts in Atlantic City,\nNew Jersey. Schurr had worked at Resorts in a number of\nfull-time jobs from 1974 until 1986 when he resigned in\norder to enter the restaurant business. After June 1986\nSchurr continued to work for Resorts on occasion as a\n\"casual\" worker2 on an\"as needed\" basis.\n\nIn late 1993 a full-time light and sound technician at\nResorts was suspended. While arbitration proceedings\nrelevant to this suspension were pending, Schurr, still\nworking as a casual employee, filled in for the suspended\nemployee on a regular basis. In early July 1994, the labor\narbitration was concluded and the full-time technician's job\nbecame available. Five people, including Schurr, applied for\nthe job.3 Bill Stevenson, Resorts' Director of Show\nOperations and Stage Manager, narrowed those under\nconsideration to Schurr and Ronald Boykin, a black male\nwho was also employed as a casual worker at Resorts. Both\nStevenson and his direct superior, Robert Chambers,\nbelieved that each of the applicants was qualified for the\nopen position. Stevenson viewed the two as equally\nqualified. Acting pursuant to what he believed was required\nby the Resorts EEBOP, Stevenson hired Boykin. Stevenson\nstated that under the EEBOP, the \"technician\"\nclassification was underutilized as of October, 1993, i.e.,\nthe percentage of minorities in the technician category was\n22.25%, but the goal established by the Casino Control\nCommission regulations was 25%. Stevenson stated that he\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. A casual employee is defined in the union contract between Resorts\nand the International Alliance of Theatrical State Employees as \"an\nemployee required to supplement specific classification in the normal\nhouse crew on an intermittent basis.\"\n\n3. At about the same time, Schurr also applied to Resorts for a position\nas an apprentice mechanic. Schurr's complaint alleged reverse\ndiscrimination in Resorts' failure to hire him for this position as well.\nThe District Court found that Schurr failed to establish a prima facie\ncase with respect to this position. Schurr does not appeal that portion of\nthe District Court's ruling.\n\n                               6\n\fbelieved that in an underutilized category, for which there\nwere two equally qualified applicants, he was obligated to\nhire the minority applicant. Chambers, Stevenson's\nsuperior, also believed that Resorts was obligated to hire\nthe minority candidate if one of the two qualified applicants\nfor a position was a minority and Resorts had failed to meet\nstate goals in the relevant category.\n\nAfter learning that he had not been hired for the full-time\ntechnician position, Schurr continued to work as a casual\nemployee at Resorts and at other Atlantic City casinos.4 In\nJanuary 1995 Schurr filed a charge of discrimination with\nthe New Jersey Division of Civil Rights and the EEOC\nalleging discrimination on the basis of race. He received a\nnotice of right to sue on May 7, 1996, and on July 8, 1996,\nSchurr filed this action.\n\nOn January 13, 1997 the parties consented to dismissal\nwith prejudice of all of Schurr's claims against the\nCommission, and to dismissal of the section 1983 claim for\nmonetary damages against the Commission Chairman.\n\nFollowing the close of discovery, the parties filed motions\nfor summary judgment. In an order dated June 30, 1998,\nthe District Court entered an order granting the motions\nfiled by Resorts and the Commission Chairman and\ndenying the motion filed by Schurr. This timely appeal\nfollowed.5\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4. In January 1996, Schurr became a full-time employee of another\nAtlantic City resort. He continues to work at casinos as a casual\nemployee for extra income.\n\n5. The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. S 1331. We\nhave jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. S 1291.

Schurr contends that his Fourteenth\nAmendment equal protection rights were violated when the\nCommission Chairman enforced the Commission's\nregulations setting minority employment goals and\nrequiring that casino licensees implement affirmative action\nplans designed to meet these goals: \"Smith and the\nCommission's actions in imposing employment goals in\nResorts' [EEBOP] and in approving and monitoring same,\ndirectly resulted in Resorts' denial of the Light and Sound\nTechnician . . . position to Schurr.\" The District Court\ngranted summary judgment in favor of the Commission\nChairman, concluding that Schurr lacked standing to\npursue his claim.\n\nThe standing requirements embodied in the \"case\" or\n\"controversy\" provision of Article III of the United States\nConstitution mandate that in every case, the plaintiff be\nable to demonstrate:\n\n        An \"injury in fact\"-- an invasion of a judicially\n        cognizable interest which is (a) concrete and\n        particularized and (b) actual or imminent, not\n        conjectural or hypothetical; second, [that] there [is] a\n        causal connection between the injury and the conduct\n        complained of -- the injury has to be \"fairly trace[able]\n        to the challenged action of the defendant, and not .. .\n        the result [of] the independent action of some third\n        party not before the court.\" Third, [that] it [is] \"likely,\"\n        as opposed to merely \"speculative,\" that the injury will\n        be redressed by a favorable decision.\"\n\nLujan v.

Applying these standing\nrequirements to the facts of this case, the District Court\nconcluded, first, that Schurr did not suffer an \"injury in\nfact\" within the meaning of Article III. In Northeastern\nFlorida Chapter of the Associated Gen. Contractors of\nAmerica v. City of Jacksonville, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112884\"><a href=\"/opinion/112884/northeastern-fla-chapter-associated-gen-contractors-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">656</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 666 (1993),\nthe Supreme Court determined that \"the `injury in fact' in\nan equal protection case of this variety is the denial of\n\n                               8\n\fequal treatment resulting from the imposition of[a] barrier\n. . . .\" Relying on this language, the District Court\nconcluded that the challenged regulations constituted\nmerely a means of \"outreach\" to minorities and women, and\ndid not constitute a barrier to others:\n\n        The Commission's affirmative action regulations in\n        general, and the minority and women employment\n        goals in particular [did] not erect a barrier to Schurr's\n        ability to compete fairly for the positions for which he\n        applied . . . . [T]he Commission's regulations mandate\n        that casino licensees reach out to women and minority\n        candidates, not that they prefer women and minorities\n        in actually making hiring decisions.

Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">537</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 548-\n49 (D.N.J. 1998). The District Court reasoned that because\nthe regulations merely required casino licensees to\n\"broaden the applicant pool by employing various outreach\nefforts,\" they had not injured Schurr. Id. at 549.\n\nThe District Court also concluded that Schurr lacked\nstanding to maintain his claim against the Commission\nChairman because he failed to show a causal link between\nthe relevant regulations and Resorts' decision to hire the\nminority candidate. \"[T]here is only the most attenuated\nrelationship between the Commission's regulations and the\nhiring decisions which allegedly injured or will injure\nSchurr.\" Id. at 550. In the District Court's view, the\nregulations at issue did not mandate a particular\nemployment decision:\n\n        [W]ith respect to the decision not to hire Schurr for the\n        light and sound technician job, Schurr's damage is\n\n                                9\n\f        fairly traceable only to Resorts' actions in implementing\n        its affirmative action plan and Resorts' actions in\n        administering the plan through its employees....\n        Schurr's damage is not, however, traceable as far back\n        as the Commission's regulations.\n\nId. The Court concluded that:\n\n        The \"links in the chain\" between the Commission's\n        regulations and Schurr's alleged injury are \"far too\n        weak as a whole to sustain\" Schurr's standing.\n        Accordingly, I will grant Smith's Motion for Summary\n        Judgment and deny Schurr's Motion for Summary\n        Judgment on his section 1983 claim.\n\nId. (internal citation omitted.)\n\nThe District Court's standing analysis as to both injury in\nfact and causation rested on its characterization of the\nCommission's regulations: \"[These] regulations specifically\ndo not authorize or encourage the use of preference in\nhiring. Instead they specifically provide for other, much\nmore benign methods by which casino licensees may\nexpand the applicant pool.\" Id. at 549-50. According to the\nDistrict Court, \"even the most casual review of the\nCommission's regulations\" reveals that \"the obvious thrust\nof the regulations is that, in order to improve the\nrepresentation of women and minorities . . . a casino\nlicensee should broaden the pool of applicants . . ..\" Id. at\n549.\n\nWe disagree with the District Court's characterization of\nthe regulations. Our reading of both the Act and the\nimplementing regulations convinces us that the regulatory\nscheme challenged here contemplates something beyond\n\"benign methods by which casino licensees may expand the\napplicant pool.\" Id. at 550. The finding that the challenged\nregulations are directed only at recruitment is inconsistent\nwith the language used in the regulations.\n\nThe regulations were drafted to prohibit discrimination by\n\"encouraging businesses to achieve a balanced\nrepresentation of employees at all levels of the work force,\"\nN.J.A.C. 15:32-1.1, and to ensure that \"affirmative efforts\nare made to recruit and employ\" minorities, N.J.A.C. 19:53-\n\n                                10\n\f1.4 (emphasis added). Affirmative efforts are to address,\nwithout limitation, all employment practices including:\n\n        (1) employment promotion, demotion or transfer;\n\n        (2) recruitment, recruitment advertising or postin g;\n\n        (3) layoff or termination;\n\n        (4) rates of pay and other forms of compensation o r\n        benefits;\n\n        (5) selection for training and upward mobility\n        programs; and;\n\n        (6) grievance procedures for, and disposition of,\n        complaints related to equal employment opportunity.\n        . . .\n\nN.J.A.C. 19.53-4.3. If a casino licensee fails to meet the\nestablished goal, the licensee is required to document its\ngood faith efforts to hire a qualified female or minority\ncandidate for the position. N.J.A.C. 19:53-4.3.\n\nThe broad language used throughout the regulations as\na whole undermines both the District Court's conclusion\nthat the scheme is addressed to recruitment alone and its\ndisposition of the standing issue on the basis of that\nconclusion. We agree with the District Court that the\nregulations do not mandate specific hiring decisions. We\nare convinced, however, that in setting employment goals\nfor women and minorities, in monitoring compliance with\nthese goals, and in providing for sanctions if casino\nlicensees cannot demonstrate good faith efforts to comply\nwith those goals, the regulations were intended to influence\nemployment decisions generally and may, as here, affect\nconcrete decisions; for example, which of two equally\nqualified job candidates will be hired.\n\nThis conclusion is supported by the testimony of the\nResort employees responsible for hiring under the EEBOP.\nThey testified that they believed that the regulations and\nthe EEBOP formulated and reviewed pursuant to those\nregulations required that they hire the minority candidate\nover Schurr. Given the candidates' comparable\nqualifications, those responsible for hiring at Resorts were\nunable to justify hiring Schurr where the technician job\n\n                               11\n\fcategory was underutilized. Furthermore, they did not want\nto bear the administrative burden of having to do so. This\nevidence supports the conclusion that the regulations set\nemployment goals, and place administrative pressure upon\ncasino licensees to meet these goals. The fact that the\nregulations do not explicitly require minority hiring or\nmandate a race-based decision is not dispositive of the\ncausation question.\n\nAlthough it was decided under a somewhat different set\nof facts, our causation analysis is guided by the discussion\nset forth by our sister Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit\nin Bras v. California Public Utilities, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"699266\"><a href=\"/opinion/699266/j-jack-bras-individually-and-doing-business-as-j-jack-bras-associates/\"><span class=\"volume\">59</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">869</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir.\n1995), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">516</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1084</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1996). In Bras, the\ncourt considered an equal protection challenge to a\nCalifornia statute, the California Women and Minority\nBusiness Enterprise Law, which required nongovernmental\ncontractors to meet minority participation goals. Pursuant\nto this law, the California Public Utilities Commission was\ndirected to formulate goals for state utilities in the\nprocurement of goods and services from minority-owned\nbusinesses. In 1988, the Commission promulgated an order\nrequiring each state utility to establish a \"goal\" specifying\nthat it would purchase at least fifteen percent of its utilities\nrequirements from minority firms.\n\nIn response to this Order, in 1991, Pacific Bell provided\na prequalification form to a number of architectural firms\nfrom which it expected to receive proposals for future work.\nThis form required the firms to specify whether they were\ncertified as a minority or women enterprise. Bras submitted\nits form, stating that it was not so certified. Because it was\nnot a minority enterprise, Bras was not selected as one of\nthe firms eligible to bid on Pacific Bell projects.\n\nBras filed suit in federal court alleging that the Law and\nthe Order violated the requirements of the Equal Protection\nClause. Bras also sought a permanent injunction\npreventing the Commission from implementing the goals\nprovided for in the Law and the Order. The district court\ndismissed Bras' claim for lack of standing.\n\nOn appeal, a majority of the Court held that Bras had\nsatisfied the standing requirements and should have been\n\n                               12\n\fpermitted to pursue the request for injunctive relief.6 The\nCourt found that although the challenged Law and Order\nset \"goals\" and not set-asides, they had the practical effect\nof placing the Bras firm on unequal footing in competing for\nbusiness. According to the Court of Appeals, the\"economic\nreality\" created by both the Law and the Order was the\nrequirement that California utilities adopt discriminatory\nprograms, or risk sanction. As a result, the Court held that\nthere was a connection between Bras' injury and\nimplementation of the Law and Order sufficient to satisfy\nthe causation element of the standing analysis.\n\nWe do not find any meaningful distinction between the\ngoals at issue in Bras and those challenged here. The\nchallenged goal-based regulations, like those at issue in\nBras, clearly have the practical effect of encouraging (if not\noutright compelling) discriminatory hiring.\n\nThat employment goals may, in some circumstances,\ncreate a classification based on race was also recognized by\nthe Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in\nLutheran Church-Missouri Synod v. FCC, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">141</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">344</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.C.\nCir.), reh'g denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">154</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">487</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.C.

The Bras court determined that the question of standing was\ncontrolled by the Supreme Court's holding in Northeastern Florida\nChapter of the Associated Gen. Contractors v. City of Jacksonville, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112884\"><a href=\"/opinion/112884/northeastern-fla-chapter-associated-gen-contractors-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">656</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 666 (1993), and that the \"injury in fact\" associated with\nminority preference programs is \"the inability to compete on an equal\nfooting in the bidding process, not the loss of a contract.\" Bras, 59 F.3d\nat 873. The court concluded that Bras satisfied this \"injury in fact\"\nrequirement by stating that he wanted to \"reinstate\" his eligibility to\nbid\non Pacific Bell projects \"in the future\" and that he was \"ready, willing\nand able\" to provide services to Pacific Bell. Id. at 873-74. Tracking\nthis\nlanguage, Schurr here asserts that he is \"ready, willing and able\" to work\nat Resorts. As discussed infra, this allegation does not itself resolve\nthe\nissue of whether Schurr has established a sufficiently imminent injury to\nbe entitled to forward-looking relief. That issue is governed by Adarand\nConstructors, Inc. v. Pena, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117947\"><a href=\"/opinion/117947/adarand-constructors-inc-v-pena/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 211 (1995), a decision that\nissued shortly after and was therefore not addressed in Bras. Moreover,\nunlike the situation in Bras, the evidence in this case indicates that\nSchurr has in fact been repeatedly subject to the challenged regulations,\nwithout apparent adverse consequence.\n\n                               13\n\frequirement that radio stations adopt affirmative action\nprograms incorporating numerical goals, based on\npopulation data, for hiring women and minorities. In\ndetermining that goals similar to those at issue here\ncreated minority preferences subject to equal protection\nanalysis, the Court of Appeals noted that the crucial point\nis not whether the regulations required quotas, but rather\nwhether they obliged stations to grant some degree of\npreference to minorities in hiring. Concluding that the\nchallenged regulations granted such a preference, the court\nexplained:\n\n        The entire scheme is built on the notion that stations\n        should aspire to a workforce that attains, or at least\n        approaches, proportional representation. . . . The very\n        term \"under-representation\" necessarily implies that if\n        such a situation exists, the station is falling short of\n        the desired outcome. The regulations pressure stations\n        to maintain a workforce that mirrors the racial\n        breakdown of their \"metropolitan statistical area.\"\n\n        . . .\n\n        Although it was urged that . . . \"goals\" should be\n        treated differently than obligatory set asides . . . we do\n        not think it matters whether a government hiring\n        program imposes hard quotas, soft quotas, or goals.\n        Any one of these techniques induces an employer to\n        hire with an eye toward meeting the numerical target.\n        As such, they can and surely will result in individuals\n        being granted a privilege because of their race.\n\nLutheran Church-Missouri Synod v. FCC, 141 F.3d 351-52,\n354.\n\nHowever, our conclusion that the District Court erred\nboth in characterizing the regulations at issue and in\nholding that Schurr failed to establish causation does not\nmandate reversal, for there is another component of the\nstanding inquiry that is at issue.\n\nSchurr's sole equal protection claim against the\nCommission Chairman is for forward-looking declaratory\nand injunctive relief. In order to have standing to challenge\nfuture rather than past application of the regulation,\n\n                                14\n\fSchurr must allege that the setting of minority employment\ngoals for job categories within the casino industry \"in the\nfuture constitutes `an invasion of a legally protected interest\nwhich is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) actual or\nimminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.' \" Adarand\nConstructors, Inc. v. Pena, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117947\"><a href=\"/opinion/117947/adarand-constructors-inc-v-pena/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 211 (1995)\n(quoting Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. at 560).\nUnder this standard, Schurr must demonstrate that he will\nin the future be prevented from competing on an equal\nbasis with minority candidates; i.e., Schurr must show that\nthe employment goals embodied in the challenged\nregulations will cause \"imminent\" injury. The District Court\nheld that Schurr failed to do so. Schurr, 16 F. Supp. 2d at\n551. We agree.\n\nSchurr's evidence in support of his claim that he is in\ndanger of imminent injury in fact supports the opposite\nconclusion. For example, Schurr testified at his deposition\nthat since January 1996, he has held a full-time position as\nan engineer at another casino. The engineering position\nappears to be one covered by the challenged regulations\n(under either the \"professional\" or \"technician\" category).\nSchurr also testified that in addition to this full-time work,\nhe has obtained part-time casino work -- at Resorts as well\nas at least five other casinos -- \"filling in\" for extra money.\nThe part-time work appears to be that of a technician. This\nevidence indicates that since being denied the full-time\ntechnician's job in 1994, Schurr repeatedly has been\nsubjected to the regulations, with no apparent adverse\neffect.\n\nIn evaluating Schurr's evidence of imminent harm, we are\nalso mindful of what is not in the record. There is no\nevidence of how frequently jobs for which Schurr is\nqualified become available.7 There is no evidence of how\nfrequently Schurr must compete with women or minorities\nfor those jobs. There is no evidence as of whether Schurr\nhas been denied any other job for which he applied-- or\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n7. Such evidence is of obvious important to the imminence issue. For\nexample, Schurr testified at this deposition that he rarely works at \"the\nSands\" merely because \"they don't do much.\" The challenged regulations\nthus played no part in Schurr's inability to work at the Sands.\n\n                               15\n\fthe reason for such denial. Nor is there any evidence of\nwhether any of the other casinos at which Schurr might\napply have met their relevant goals, or whether they, like\nResorts, consider the \"goals\" to mandate hiring preferences.\nThis record is therefore distinguishable from that in\nAdarand, which supported a finding that Adarand had\nestablished a threat of \"imminent injury\" necessary to\nmaintain its claim for forward-looking relief. The evidence\nin Adarand included statistical evidence of how frequently\nthe relevant contracts came up for bid; evidence that\nAdarand bid on every such contract in Colorado, and was\n\"very likely\" to bid on future contracts; and evidence that\nAdarand \"often\" had to compete against businesses certified\nunder the challenged program. Adarand, 515 U.S. at 212.\nWe also note the statement in Lujan that \" `some day'\nintentions\" are insufficient to establish an imminent injury.\nLujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112747\"><a href=\"/opinion/112747/lujan-v-defenders-of-wildlife/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">555</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 564 (1992).\n\nIn sum, Schurr failed to make an adequate showing that\nhe is in danger of suffering imminent injury as a result of\nthe challenged regulations. Accordingly, we will affirm the\norder of the District Court granting summary judgment in\nfavor of the Commission Chairman, limited in accordance\nwith our foregoing discussion.\n\nIV.\n\nWe focus next on Schurr's claim that Resorts violated the\nrequirements of Title VII when it made race a factor in the\ndecision not to hire Schurr.\n\nBecause the District Court, after extensive analysis,\nrejected Schurr's equal protection claim for lack of standing,8\nit conducted only a cursory Title VII analysis.9 Generally,\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n8. Our decision with respect to Schurr's standing to pursue forward-\nlooking relief on his equal protection claim applies as well to any claim\nfor forward-looking relief under Title VII or the related statutes that\nSchurr asserts.\n\n9. For example, the District Court concluded the Commission's\naffirmative action regulations were enacted to remedy a manifest\nimbalance because it found the regulations set forth \"employment goals\non a category by category basis\" and \"distinguishe[d] between skilled and\nunskilled workers.\" But under Weber, a court determines whether a\nmanifest imbalance existed by examining the racial makeup of the labor\nforce.\n\n                               16\n\fcourts of appeals should not decide the legality of an\naffirmative action program in the absence of careful district\ncourt analysis of the merits. In most cases, a district\ncourt's analysis of why an affirmative action plan was\nadopted and how the plan affects non-minorities is crucial\nto thorough and effective appellate review of the plan.

In most\ncases, therefore, the better course is to remand and\ninstruct the district court to conduct this analysis. But this\nis an atypical case; here, the record on summary judgment\nmakes clear that Resorts' plan was not adopted to remedy\na manifest imbalance in traditionally segregated job\ncategories. Accordingly, based on that record, we will\nassess whether Resorts' plan violates Title VII.\n\nThe terms of Title VII are violated when an employer\ntakes action \"to discriminate against any individual with\nrespect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges\nof employment\" or \"to limit, segregate, or classify his\nemployees ... in any way which would deprive or tend to\ndeprive any individual of employment opportunities or\notherwise affect his status as an employee\" on the basis of\n\"race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\" 42 U.S.C.\nS 2000e - 2(a). Although this language was initially\nconstrued as absolute -- prohibiting all discrimination in\nemployment, see e.g. Johnson v.

We placed particular emphasis on the remedial\ncomponent of Title VII, finding it central to the Title VII\nscheme:\n\n        The significance of [the] second corrective purpose\n        cannot be overstated. It is only because Title VII was\n        written to eradicate not only discrimination per se but\n        the consequences of prior discrimination as well, that\n        racial preferences in the form of affirmative action can\n        co-exist with the Act's antidiscrimination mandate.\n\nId. We then announced the following rule which now guides\nour discussion of Schurr's Title VII claim and Resorts'\naffirmative action plan: \"Unless an affirmative action plan\nhas a remedial purpose, it cannot be said to mirror the\npurposes of the statute, and, therefore, cannot satisfy the\nfirst prong of the Weber test.\" Id.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n10. This two-prong test announced in Weber was reaffirmed in Johnson\nv. Transportation Agency, Santa Clara County, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111846\"><a href=\"/opinion/111846/johnson-v-transportation-agency-santa-clara-cty/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">616</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1987).\n\n                                18\n\fThe parties in this matter agree that Schurr has\nestablished a prima facie case of race-based employment\ndiscrimination11 and that Resorts rested its decision not to\nhire Schurr on the terms of its affirmative action policy.\nHere, then, as was the case in Taxman, \"The dispositive\nliability issue ... is the validity of [Resorts'] policy under\nTitle VII.\" Id.\n\nWe have carefully reviewed the record in this matter and\nare convinced that the affirmative action plan offered to\nrebut Schurr's prima facie case lacks the remedial purpose\nrequired by controlling precedent. In order to be\ncharacterized accurately as remedial, an affirmative action\nplan must be designed to correct a \"manifest imbalance in\ntraditionally segregated job categories.\" Weber, 443 U.S. at\n207. \"The requirement that `manifest imbalance' relate to a\ntraditionally segregated job category `provides assurance\n. . . that race will be taken into account in a manner\nconsistent with Title VII's purpose of eliminating the effects\nof employment discrimination . . .\" Johnson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">650</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(emphasis added).\n\nUnder our reasonable interpretation of this standard,\nResorts' affirmative action plan is deficient. The plan itself\nand the regulations which mandate the plan were not\nbased on any finding of historical or then-current\ndiscrimination in the casino industry or in the technician\njob category; the plan was not put in place as a result of\nany manifest imbalance or in response to a finding that any\nrelevant job category was or ever had been affected by\nsegregation.12 Indeed, the case now before us is an unusual\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n11. We analyze Schurr's Title VII claim under the approach set forth in\nMcDonnell Douglas v. Green, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">792</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1973). When a plaintiff\nestablishes a prima facie case, the burden of production shifts to the\nemployer to show a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the decision.\nThe decision in Johnson, 480 U.S. at 626, establishes that one such\nreason may be an affirmative action plan. If the employer is able to meet\nthis burden of production, the burden shifts back to the employee to\ndemonstrate that the nondiscriminatory reason offered is pretextual, i.e.\nthat the affirmative action plan is invalid.\n\n12. Evidence that a manifest imbalance existed either before or after\nResorts enacted its plan would have sufficed. See Wygant v. Jackson Bd.\n\n                               19\n\fone in that there is no disagreement as to whether Resorts'\nplan or the challenged regulations were intended to remedy\npast or present discrimination. They were not. In a\ndeposition, Gustave Thomas, the designated Commission\nrepresentative, testified as follows:\n\n           Q: Now prior to issuing the employment goals\n              in the Commission's regs, did the\n              Commission itself ever practice\n              discrimination?\n\n        Thomas: No, not to my knowledge.\n\n           Q: Was there ever any finding that the state\n              had discriminated with regard to the various\n              job categories and the employment goals\n              pursuant to those categories issued by the\n              Commission regs?\n\n           A: Not to my knowledge.\n\n           Q: The casinos, from the inception of the casino\n              industry in Atlantic City, have always needed\n              to have the employment goals pursuant to\n              those categories issued by the Commission\n              rep?\n\n           A: That's correct.\n\nThe remainder of the record contains nothing to suggest\nthat the Act or the regulations promulgated pursuant to\nthat Act were drafted or enacted with an intent to remedy\nany discrimination.

Schurr, therefore, is entitled to summary\njudgment on the Title VII claim.\n\nV.\n\nOur disposition of Schurr's Title VII claim dictates\nreversal of the District Court's grant of summary judgment\nin favor of Resorts on Schurr's claims based on the NJLAD\nand on section 1981.\n\nAnalysis of a claim made pursuant to the NJLAD\ngenerally follows analysis of a Title VII claim. We predicted\nin Taxman that the New Jersey Supreme Court considering\nan affirmative action plan in light of the NJLAD \"would\nfollow the analytical directive of Weber and Johnson.\" 91\nF.3d at 1564. The result under the NJLAD would, therefore,\nbe the same as that reached in our Title VII analysis.\nSchurr is entitled to summary judgment on his claim made\nunder the NJLAD.\n\nThe result is similar with respect to Schurr's claim based\non 42 U.S.C. S 1981. While a valid affirmative action plan\nserves as a defense to an action under section 1981, the\nstandard for evaluating the validity of a plan is identical to\nthe standard developed in Title VII cases. Setser v. Novack\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n13. Because we conclude that Resorts' plan fails the first part of the\nWeber test, we do not address whether the plan passes the second part\nof that test; i.e., whether it \"unnecessarily trammel[s] the interests of\n[non-minority] employees.\" Weber, 443 U.S. at 207-08.\n\n                                21\n\fInvestment Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"393737\"><a href=\"/opinion/393737/26-fair-emplpraccas-513-26-empl-prac-dec-p-31995-chester-w-setser/\"><span class=\"volume\">657</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">962</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 968 (8th Cir. 1981). In light\nof our conclusion that the Resorts' affirmative action plan\nwas invalid for purposes of Title VII, we also conclude that\nthe plan cannot serve as a defense to Schurr's section 1981\nclaim. The grant of summary judgment in favor of Resorts\non this claim was, therefore, inappropriate. As the District\nCourt recognized, \"In the Third Circuit, the elements of\nemployment discrimination under Title VII are identical to\nthe elements of a section 1981 claim.\" Schurr, 16 F.\nSupp.2d at 556. Schurr was entitled to summary judgment\nunder Title VII and should have been granted summary\njudgment on the section 1981 claim as well.\n\nBecause the District Court granted summary judgment in\nfavor of the defendants on the Title VII and related\nstatutory claims, it did not, of course, consider the question\nof damages. Based on our holding in this matter, an\nassessment of damages is required. As the record is\nunderstandably devoid of evidence bearing on this\nassessment, we will remand this matter to the District\nCourt for further proceedings.\n\nVI.\n\nWe find that the District Court properly granted\nsummary judgment in favor of the Commission Chairman\non Schurr's equal protection claim and will, therefore,\naffirm the Order of the District Court with respect to that\nclaim. We find that the District Court erred in granting\nsummary judgment in favor of Resorts on claims made\npursuant to Title VII, Section 1981, and the NJLAD, and\nwill direct that summary judgment be entered in favor of\nSchurr on these claims. This matter will be remanded to\nthe District Court for consideration of damages under Title\nVII and the related statutes.\n\nA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\n        Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n        for the Third Circuit\n\n                               22\n\f</pre>",
