For the\n\nfollowing reasons, we will affirm.\n\f                                              I.\n\n       Holbrook alleges that, while imprisoned at SCI-Huntingdon, prison personnel\n\nretaliated against him for filing certain grievances and for his religious affiliation by\n\nplacing him in administrative custody and ultimately transferring him to a different\n\nprison. The District Court’s Memorandum of April 4, 2008, thoroughly sets forth the\n\nbackground of this matter, and we summarize only those facts necessary to our decision.\n\n       Holbrook was transferred to SCI-Huntingdon from another prison in April 2000\n\nfor reasons that the parties dispute. What is not disputed is that Holbrook arrived at SCI-\n\nHuntingdon with a lengthy institutional file documenting his involvement in stabbings,\n\nassaults and other misconduct, and his suspected affiliation with the Fruit of Islam,1 while\n\nincarcerated in at least six different prisons. Defendant Walters, the Unit Manager of\n\nHolbrook’s cell block, reviewed his file on intake and made a notation indicating security\n\nconcerns and suggesting that he be “monitored closely.” In January and April 2001,\n\nrespectively, Holbrook received misconducts for writing a Fruit of Islam slogan on his\n\ncell wall and the discovery of a “shank” in his cell.\n\n       After these incidents, Holbrook began filing the grievances for which he claims he\n\nwas retaliated against. In July 2001, Holbrook filed a grievance accusing a prison guard\n\nof racial intimidation. In October 2001, Holbrook filed a grievance against a different\n\n\n   1\n    According to defendants, the Fruit of Islam is the paramilitary wing of the Nation of\nIslam. Holbrook claims to be a member only of the Nation of Islam and not of the Fruit\nof Islam, but that point is not relevant to our disposition.\n\n                                               2\n\fprison guard who had confiscated certain items from his cell. (The guard, following the\n\nattacks of September 11, had confiscated a map of Afghanistani terrorist camps, a picture\n\nof a “militant,” and other materials. The guard’s supervisor returned the items to\n\nHolbrook that same day after determining that they did not pose a threat to security.)\n\nThen, in December 2001, Holbrook and six other prisoners sent an informal complaint to\n\nthe DOC Office of Professional Responsibility accusing still another prison guard of\n\nracially-motivated mistreatment.\n\n       Holbrook alleges that defendants’ retaliatory conduct began after this incident, and\n\nhis allegations relate primarily to defendant Walters. According to Holbrook, Walters\n\nlearned of the informal complaint in January 2002, told Holbrook that he did not like\n\nprisoners “going over his head,” and demanded that Holbrook withdraw the complaint or\n\nthat “he would see to it that plaintiff goes under for a long time.” In March 2002, Walters\n\nasked another prisoner whether Holbrook had “put him up to” joining in the informal\n\ncomplaint and told him that whoever was “behind” it would be “sitting in the hole for a\n\nlong time.” Holbrook later helped another prisoner file a formal grievance against the\n\nsame prison guard. Walters asked Holbrook whether he had done so and, when Holbrook\n\nadmitted that he had, Walters said that he was “fed up” with Holbrook’s grievances and\n\n“was not going to tolerate them or plaintiff causing trouble on his block.”\n\n       Nothing further occurred until June 10, 2002, when Holbrook requested that\n\nWalters grant him an override of his custody level that would allow him to work in the\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\fprison’s electrical power plant. Walters thought the request odd because Holbrook\n\npreviously had refused to work. On June 20, Walters attended an operations meeting\n\nwhere staff were briefed on “the recruitment of inmates in American prisons by radical\n\nIslamic groups.” Walters then spoke with other prison staff regarding Holbrook’s\n\n“sudden” interest in the power plant. A corrections officer advised him that Holbrook\n\nwas rumored to have risen to the rank of Major in the Fruit of Islam and that Holbrook\n\nhad been telling other prisoners that he was “in the American Taliban.”\n\n       These circumstances, together with Holbrook’s history, prompted Walters to raise\n\nconcerns with security personnel by memorandum dated June 21, 2002. The\n\nmemorandum suggested that Holbrook be monitored more closely or placed in\n\nadministrative custody and stated that “this information is being provided to you for any\n\naction you deem appropriate.” On June 26, a Major Weaverling (not a defendant) asked\n\nWalters to arrange for Holbrook’s placement in administrative custody, which Walters did\n\nthat same day. On July 3, 2002, a Program Review Committee composed of defendants\n\nHollibaugh, Lawler and Williamson reviewed Holbrook’s custody status. After\n\nreviewing Walter’s memorandum and receiving additional information, the committee\n\ndeemed Holbrook a threat to the security of the institution and approved his retention in\n\nadministrative custody pending a transfer to a long term segregation unit. Holbrook\n\nadministratively challenged this determination to no avail. Holbrook also filed a\n\ngrievance against Walters, alleging that Walters had falsified information in his file in\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\fretaliation for Holbrook’s past grievances and complaints. Major Weaverling\n\ninvestigated the grievance and concluded that it lacked merit. Walters, acting on the\n\ncommittee’s recommendation, thereafter filed two petitions for Holbrook’s transfer to\n\nanother prison. Those petitions were denied, but a different prison employee filed a third\n\npetition on the basis of which Holbrook ultimately was transferred to SCI-Greene.\n\n       In January 2003, Holbrook filed his complaint, alleging that defendants had placed\n\nhim in administrative custody in retaliation for his filing of grievances and complaints and\n\nhad denied him due process. The District Court dismissed Holbrook’s due process claim\n\nbut allowed his retaliation claim to proceed. The District Court also allowed Holbrook to\n\namend his complaint to assert that defendants had retaliated against him because of his\n\nreligious affiliation. Following discovery, defendants moved for summary judgment on\n\nthe retaliation claims, and the District Court granted their motion by order entered April\n\n4, 2007.2 The District Court also denied Holbrook’s timely motion for reconsideration of\n\nthat ruling by order entered March 31, 2008. Holbrook appeals.3\n\n   2\n    In his January 2003 complaint, the only retaliatory action Holbrook alleged was his\nplacement in administrative custody at SCI-Huntingdon. In May 2003, he was transferred\nto SCI-Greene. Thereafter, he argued in various briefs that the prison transfer was\nretaliatory as well, but he never sought to amend his complaint to assert it as a discrete\nclaim. Nevertheless, the District Court addressed the prison transfer.\n   3\n    We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291. In his brief, Holbrook challenges\nonly the District Court’s entry of summary judgment and its application of law on\nreconsideration. Our review of those rulings is plenary. See In re Tower Air, Inc., 416\nF.3d 229, 235 n.7 (3d Cir. 2005); Carter v. McGrady, 292 F.3d 152, 157 (3d Cir. 2002).\n“Summary judgment is proper if there is no genuine issue of material fact and if, viewing\n                                                                             (continued...)\n\n                                             5\n\f                                              II.\n\n       “A prisoner alleging that prison officials have retaliated against him for exercising\n\nhis constitutional rights must prove that: (1) the conduct in which he engaged was\n\nconstitutionally protected; (2) he suffered ‘adverse action’ at the hands of prison officials;\n\nand (3) his constitutionally protected conduct was a substantial or motivating factor in the\n\ndecision to discipline him.” Carter, 292 F.3d at 157-58. If the prisoner makes that\n\nshowing, “the burden shifts to the defendant to prove by a preponderance of the evidence\n\nthat it ‘would have made the same decision absent the protected conduct for reasons\n\nreasonably related to penological interest.’” Id. at 158 (citation omitted). We have\n\nexplained that this element must be evaluated in light of the “great deference” generally\n\nafforded to prison officials’ decisions regarding prison administration. See id.\n\n       In this case, the District Court held that Holbrook had presented sufficient\n\nevidence to show that his conduct was constitutionally protected and that the\n\nadministrative custody imposed on him was sufficiently adverse. It held, however, that\n\ndefendants prevailed as a matter of law on the issue of causation. Our careful review of\n\nthe record leads us to agree.\n\n\n\n\n   3\n    (...continued)\nthe facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, the moving party is entitled\nto judgment as a matter of law.” Carter, 292 F.3d at 157 n.2. A party opposing summary\njudgment may not rely on mere allegations, but must instead come forward with specific\nfacts “‘showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.’” Lauren v. DeFlaminis, 480 F.3d\n259, 266 (3d Cir. 2007) (citation omitted).\n\n                                              6\n\f       The District Court’s analysis proceeded in two steps. First, the District Court held\n\nthat Holbrook had presented no evidence that any of the defendants save Walters had any\n\nretaliatory motive. Our review of the record confirms that Holbrook, despite his\n\nconclusory allegation that all other defendants “cooperated” with Walters, presented no\n\nevidence that any of them did anything other than perform their ordinary administrative\n\nfunctions in reliance on Walters’s memorandum.\n\n       Second, the District Court held that Holbrook had presented sufficient evidence to\n\nraise an inference that Walters’s conduct was motivated by retaliation for filing\n\ngrievances and complaints (though not for his religious affiliation).4 It concluded,\n\nhowever, that Walters had shown that he would have taken the same action, regardless of\n\nHolbrook’s activities, for reasons related to penological interests. We agree with this\n\nruling as well.\n\n       Walters submitted a declaration explaining in detail the reasons for drafting his\n\nJune 21 memorandum, including Holbrook’s extensive history of misconduct and new-\n\nfound interest in working at the power plant after he was reported to have told other\n\nprisoners that he was “with the American Taliban.” Holbrook never came forward with\n\nany evidence raising a genuine issue of material fact with regard to these circumstances.\n\n\n   4\n    Holbrook does not challenge this second conclusion on appeal, but we note our\nagreement with the District Court. The undisputed facts of record show that defendants\nwere aware of Holbrook’s religious affiliation in April 2000 but took no steps to place\nhim in administrative custody until June 2002. Moreover, Walter’s alleged threats related\nsolely to Holbrook’s filing of grievances, not his religious affiliation.\n\n                                             7\n\fMoreover, Walters’s memorandum itself does not recommend Holbrook’s placement in\n\nadministrative custody per se, but instead lists such placement as one among other\n\nsecurity options. Under the circumstances, it is clear that Walters would have taken the\n\naction he did regardless of Holbrook’s protected conduct and that his action was well\n\nwithin the broad discretion afforded to prison personnel in matters of prison\n\nadministration. See Carter, 292 F.3d at 158-59 (affirming summary judgment in favor of\n\nprison official who allegedly had threatened to place inmate in restricted custody for\n\nconduct assumed to be protected where quantum of evidence showed that prisoner faced\n\ndiscipline notwithstanding that protected activity).5\n\n       Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court. Holbrook’s\n\nmotion to supplement the District Court record is denied.6\n\n\n\n\n   5\n    Holbrook argues that Walter’s retaliatory intent can be inferred from the “conflicting\nrationales” given in the three petitions for his transfer to another prison. Walters,\nhowever, prepared only the first two petitions, and they are perfectly consistent (the\nstatements in the second petition regarding asserted terrorist materials that were not\nincluded in the first petition were included in Walters’s June 21 memorandum, which was\nattached to the first petition). The third petition, which notes as an additional ground for\ntransfer the need to separate Holbrook and Walters and which resulted in Holbrook’s\ntransfer to SCI-Greene, was prepared by another individual who has not been named as a\ndefendant.\n   6\n    Holbrook seeks to supplement the record with a memorandum showing that he\ncontinues to suffer adverse consequences as a result of Walters’s June 21 memorandum\nand asks that we order the memorandum expunged from his institutional file. That\nrequest is beyond the scope of this appeal.\n\n                                              8\n\f",

What is not disputed is that Holbrook arrived at SCI-\n\nHuntingdon with a lengthy institutional file documenting his involvement in stabbings,\n\nassaults and other misconduct, and his suspected affiliation with the Fruit of Islam,1 while\n\nincarcerated in at least six different prisons. Defendant Walters, the Unit Manager of\n\nHolbrook’s cell block, reviewed his file on intake and made a notation indicating security\n\nconcerns and suggesting that he be “monitored closely.” In January and April 2001,\n\nrespectively, Holbrook received misconducts for writing a Fruit of Islam slogan on his\n\ncell wall and the discovery of a “shank” in his cell.\n\n       After these incidents, Holbrook began filing the grievances for which he claims he\n\nwas retaliated against. In July 2001, Holbrook filed a grievance accusing a prison guard\n\nof racial intimidation. In October 2001, Holbrook filed a grievance against a different\n\n\n   1\n    According to defendants, the Fruit of Islam is the paramilitary wing of the Nation of\nIslam. Holbrook claims to be a member only of the Nation of Islam and not of the Fruit\nof Islam, but that point is not relevant to our disposition.\n\n                                               2\n\fprison guard who had confiscated certain items from his cell. (The guard, following the\n\nattacks of September 11, had confiscated a map of Afghanistani terrorist camps, a picture\n\nof a “militant,” and other materials. The guard’s supervisor returned the items to\n\nHolbrook that same day after determining that they did not pose a threat to security.)\n\nThen, in December 2001, Holbrook and six other prisoners sent an informal complaint to\n\nthe DOC Office of Professional Responsibility accusing still another prison guard of\n\nracially-motivated mistreatment.\n\n       Holbrook alleges that defendants’ retaliatory conduct began after this incident, and\n\nhis allegations relate primarily to defendant Walters. According to Holbrook, Walters\n\nlearned of the informal complaint in January 2002, told Holbrook that he did not like\n\nprisoners “going over his head,” and demanded that Holbrook withdraw the complaint or\n\nthat “he would see to it that plaintiff goes under for a long time.” In March 2002, Walters\n\nasked another prisoner whether Holbrook had “put him up to” joining in the informal\n\ncomplaint and told him that whoever was “behind” it would be “sitting in the hole for a\n\nlong time.” Holbrook later helped another prisoner file a formal grievance against the\n\nsame prison guard. Walters asked Holbrook whether he had done so and, when Holbrook\n\nadmitted that he had, Walters said that he was “fed up” with Holbrook’s grievances and\n\n“was not going to tolerate them or plaintiff causing trouble on his block.”\n\n       Nothing further occurred until June 10, 2002, when Holbrook requested that\n\nWalters grant him an override of his custody level that would allow him to work in the\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\fprison’s electrical power plant. Walters thought the request odd because Holbrook\n\npreviously had refused to work. On June 20, Walters attended an operations meeting\n\nwhere staff were briefed on “the recruitment of inmates in American prisons by radical\n\nIslamic groups.” Walters then spoke with other prison staff regarding Holbrook’s\n\n“sudden” interest in the power plant. A corrections officer advised him that Holbrook\n\nwas rumored to have risen to the rank of Major in the Fruit of Islam and that Holbrook\n\nhad been telling other prisoners that he was “in the American Taliban.”\n\n       These circumstances, together with Holbrook’s history, prompted Walters to raise\n\nconcerns with security personnel by memorandum dated June 21, 2002. The\n\nmemorandum suggested that Holbrook be monitored more closely or placed in\n\nadministrative custody and stated that “this information is being provided to you for any\n\naction you deem appropriate.” On June 26, a Major Weaverling (not a defendant) asked\n\nWalters to arrange for Holbrook’s placement in administrative custody, which Walters did\n\nthat same day. On July 3, 2002, a Program Review Committee composed of defendants\n\nHollibaugh, Lawler and Williamson reviewed Holbrook’s custody status. After\n\nreviewing Walter’s memorandum and receiving additional information, the committee\n\ndeemed Holbrook a threat to the security of the institution and approved his retention in\n\nadministrative custody pending a transfer to a long term segregation unit. Holbrook\n\nadministratively challenged this determination to no avail. Holbrook also filed a\n\ngrievance against Walters, alleging that Walters had falsified information in his file in\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\fretaliation for Holbrook’s past grievances and complaints. Major Weaverling\n\ninvestigated the grievance and concluded that it lacked merit. Walters, acting on the\n\ncommittee’s recommendation, thereafter filed two petitions for Holbrook’s transfer to\n\nanother prison. Those petitions were denied, but a different prison employee filed a third\n\npetition on the basis of which Holbrook ultimately was transferred to SCI-Greene.\n\n       In January 2003, Holbrook filed his complaint, alleging that defendants had placed\n\nhim in administrative custody in retaliation for his filing of grievances and complaints and\n\nhad denied him due process. The District Court dismissed Holbrook’s due process claim\n\nbut allowed his retaliation claim to proceed. The District Court also allowed Holbrook to\n\namend his complaint to assert that defendants had retaliated against him because of his\n\nreligious affiliation. Following discovery, defendants moved for summary judgment on\n\nthe retaliation claims, and the District Court granted their motion by order entered April\n\n4, 2007.2 The District Court also denied Holbrook’s timely motion for reconsideration of\n\nthat ruling by order entered March 31, 2008. Holbrook appeals.3\n\n   2\n    In his January 2003 complaint, the only retaliatory action Holbrook alleged was his\nplacement in administrative custody at SCI-Huntingdon. In May 2003, he was transferred\nto SCI-Greene. Thereafter, he argued in various briefs that the prison transfer was\nretaliatory as well, but he never sought to amend his complaint to assert it as a discrete\nclaim. Nevertheless, the District Court addressed the prison transfer.\n   3\n    We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291. In his brief, Holbrook challenges\nonly the District Court’s entry of summary judgment and its application of law on\nreconsideration. Our review of those rulings is plenary.

If the prisoner makes that\n\nshowing, “the burden shifts to the defendant to prove by a preponderance of the evidence\n\nthat it ‘would have made the same decision absent the protected conduct for reasons\n\nreasonably related to penological interest.’” Id. at 158 (citation omitted).

First, the District Court held\n\nthat Holbrook had presented no evidence that any of the defendants save Walters had any\n\nretaliatory motive. Our review of the record confirms that Holbrook, despite his\n\nconclusory allegation that all other defendants “cooperated” with Walters, presented no\n\nevidence that any of them did anything other than perform their ordinary administrative\n\nfunctions in reliance on Walters’s memorandum.\n\n       Second, the District Court held that Holbrook had presented sufficient evidence to\n\nraise an inference that Walters’s conduct was motivated by retaliation for filing\n\ngrievances and complaints (though not for his religious affiliation).4 It concluded,\n\nhowever, that Walters had shown that he would have taken the same action, regardless of\n\nHolbrook’s activities, for reasons related to penological interests. We agree with this\n\nruling as well.\n\n       Walters submitted a declaration explaining in detail the reasons for drafting his\n\nJune 21 memorandum, including Holbrook’s extensive history of misconduct and new-\n\nfound interest in working at the power plant after he was reported to have told other\n\nprisoners that he was “with the American Taliban.” Holbrook never came forward with\n\nany evidence raising a genuine issue of material fact with regard to these circumstances.\n\n\n   4\n    Holbrook does not challenge this second conclusion on appeal, but we note our\nagreement with the District Court. The undisputed facts of record show that defendants\nwere aware of Holbrook’s religious affiliation in April 2000 but took no steps to place\nhim in administrative custody until June 2002. Moreover, Walter’s alleged threats related\nsolely to Holbrook’s filing of grievances, not his religious affiliation.\n\n                                             7\n\fMoreover, Walters’s memorandum itself does not recommend Holbrook’s placement in\n\nadministrative custody per se, but instead lists such placement as one among other\n\nsecurity options. Under the circumstances, it is clear that Walters would have taken the\n\naction he did regardless of Holbrook’s protected conduct and that his action was well\n\nwithin the broad discretion afforded to prison personnel in matters of prison\n\nadministration. See Carter, 292 F.3d at 158-59 (affirming summary judgment in favor of\n\nprison official who allegedly had threatened to place inmate in restricted custody for\n\nconduct assumed to be protected where quantum of evidence showed that prisoner faced\n\ndiscipline notwithstanding that protected activity).5\n\n       Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court. Holbrook’s\n\nmotion to supplement the District Court record is denied.6\n\n\n\n\n   5\n    Holbrook argues that Walter’s retaliatory intent can be inferred from the “conflicting\nrationales” given in the three petitions for his transfer to another prison. Walters,\nhowever, prepared only the first two petitions, and they are perfectly consistent (the\nstatements in the second petition regarding asserted terrorist materials that were not\nincluded in the first petition were included in Walters’s June 21 memorandum, which was\nattached to the first petition). The third petition, which notes as an additional ground for\ntransfer the need to separate Holbrook and Walters and which resulted in Holbrook’s\ntransfer to SCI-Greene, was prepared by another individual who has not been named as a\ndefendant.\n   6\n    Holbrook seeks to supplement the record with a memorandum showing that he\ncontinues to suffer adverse consequences as a result of Walters’s June 21 memorandum\nand asks that we order the memorandum expunged from his institutional file. That\nrequest is beyond the scope of this appeal.\n\n                                              8\n\f</pre>",
