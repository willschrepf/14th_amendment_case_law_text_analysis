You have asked whether\nthe statute attempts an unconstitutional grant of school\nlands.\n\n     Because it is not found in the codified compilation of\nTexas statutes, the pertinent parts of the rather lengthy\n1971 provision are set out below:\n\n             Section 1. The City of Corpus Christi,\n          Texas, a home rule city, desires to restore\n          and maintain a recreation beach, commonly\n          known as Corpus Christi Beach, and intends\n          to accomplish this purpose acting in con-\n          junction with the United States Corps of\n          Engineers, and other agents and contractors,\n          and as a result of a survey and report made\n          by the United States Corps of Engineers,\n          such restoration has-been found and deemed\n          to be feasible, and the project has received\n          Congressional authorization.\n\fThe Honorable Bob Armstrong - page two   (PI-881)\n\n\n\n             Sec. 2. In furtherance and in aid of the\n         above objective there is hereby granted to\n         the City of Corpus Christi, the United States\n         Corps of Engineers, their respective agents\n         and contractors, a construction easement, on\n         the lands described in Section 3 of this Act,\n         for the purpose of allowing such city, the\n         Corps of Engineers, their agents and con-\n         tractors to conduct dredging, filling,\n         excavation, and all necessary operations,\n         without payment to the State for any fill\n         material  of any kind or character removed\n         from the borrow areas described in Section\n         3, in furtherance of the purpose stated in\n         Section 1, on the lands described hereinafter\n         in Section 3, which lands are owned by the\n         State of Texas or in which the State has\n         title or interest.

Acts 1971, 62nd Leg., ch. 883 at\n          2708.   (Emphasis added).\n\n     Section 6 grants Corpus Christi a fee simple determinable\nin Tract 1, an estate that will last as long as the land is\nused for a public beach. See Eyssen v. Zeppa, 100 S.W.Zd\n417 (Tex. Civ. App. -- Texzana   1936,writ ref'd); 22 Tex.\nJur.Zd, Estates 9 7; Restatement of Property §§ 23, 44.\n\fThe Honorable Bob Armstrong - page four     @-I-8813:\n\n\n\n\n     Section 2 grants Corpus Christi, the United States Corps\nof Engineers, and their agents and contractors, a construction\neasement, which permits them to excavate and remove fill\nmaterials from the borrow area in Tract 2 or 3. The Act\ndoes not provide for compensating the public school fund for\nthe grant of Tract 1, the removal of materials from the borrow\narea, or any other use of the property encompassed in the\nconstruction easement.\n\n     We will first consider the grant of Tract 1 to Corpus\nChristi, the validity of which turns on whether the land has\nbeen dedicated to the permanent school fund. Article 7, section\n2 of the Texas Constitution determines the components of the\npermanent school fund.\n\n          All funds, lands and other property heretofore\n          set apart and appropriated for the support of\n          the public schools; all the alternate sections\n          of land reserved by the State out of grants\n          heretofore made or that may hereafter be made\n          to railroads or other corporations of any\n          nature whatsoever; one haif of the ublic\n          domain --\n                 of the State; ~ndl~um~o           mone\n          fhatmay come toe\n                         --      Statgrme      -%?\n                                                 sa  e of\n          Fportionf   --  same  .  . . .(jEm$%isdded).\n\nArticle 7, section 4 requires that these lands be sold.\n\n          The lands herein set apart to the Public\n          Free School fund shall be sold under such\n          regulations, at such times, and on such\n          terms as may be prescribed by law . . . .\n\nThis provision    prevents the Legislature from giving the land\naway, although    it might postpone sale and instead lease the\nland. Wheeler     v. Stanolind Oil & Gas Co., 252 S.W.2d 149,\n;;;o,(Tex. Sup.   m52); Reed v. Rogan, 59 S.W. 255 (Tex. Sup.\n     .\n\n     Article 7, section 5 governs the disposition of proceeds\nfrom the sale of school lands.\n\n          The principal of all bonds and other funds,\n          and the principal arising from the sale of\n          the lands hereinbefore set apart to said\n          school fund, shall be the permanent school\n\n\n\n                               p;   ,37X:\n\fThe Honorable Bob Armstrong - page five (H-881)\n\n\n\n          fund . ., . .

(Emiihasisadaed).\n\n     These constitutional provisions render the Legislature\npowerless to make a free grant of school lands. Moreover, once\nthe Legislature has dedicated land to the permanent school\nfund, it may not withdraw it. The Texas Supreme Court in\nHague v. Baker, 45 S.W. 1004, 1005 (Tex. Sup. 18981, stated\nthat azim,      section 2, \"fixed the right of the school\nfund in one-half of the unappropriated public domain, but\nleft the legislature . . . with extended authority over the\nsegregation of that interest . . . .\" The Court went on to\nsay that \"where the legislature has taken affirmative action,\nand has provided pro tanto for the segregation of the interest\nof the school fund, its action is final . . . .'I Id. at 1006.\nIt was held in E&v.   State, 84 S.W. 607, 611 (Texxiv.\nApp. 1904, writ refq),t       once it appropriated lands to\nthe school fund, \"the Legislature could not by subsequent\nlegislation change or destroy the character of these lands as\npublic school lands . . . .'I In 1900 the Settlement Act\nsettled permanently the division of much of the public domain\nbut excluded lakes, bays , and islands on the Gulf of Mexico\nwithin tide water limits. Acts 1900, 26th Leg., 1st C. S.,\nch. 11 at 29. When the Legislature subsequently placed\nlands excluded by the Settlement Act in the public school\nfund, its decision was also final as to them. Attorney\nGeneral Opinion M-356  (1969).\n\n     In 1941 the Legislature enacted article. 5415a, V.T.C.S.\nThe pertinent portion of that statute reads as follows:\n\n             Sec. 3.  The State of Texas owns, in\n          full and complete ownership, the waters\n          of the Gulf of Mexico and of the arms of\n          the said Gulf, and the beds and shores of\n          the Gulf of Mexico, and the arms of the\n          Gulf of Mexico, including all lands that\n          are covered by the waters of the said\n          Gulf and its 'arms, either at low tide or\n          high tide, within the boundaries of Texas,\n          as herein fixed; -----\n                           and that all of said\n          lands --\n                are set apart -and granted --\n                                           to the\n\n\n\n\n                             p. 3712\n\fThe Honorable Bob Armstrong - page six (H-881)\n\n\n\n          Permanent Public Free School Fund of the\n          State, andmbeeT?f-%?mbenefit\n          ofe    Public Free School Fund of this\n          State according to the provisions of law\n          governing the same.   (Emphasis added).\n\nGrants of lands under navigable waters are strictly construed\nagainst the grantee, and any ambiguity will be resolved in\nfavor of the State. State v. Bradford, 50 S.W.Zd 1065, 1075\n(Tex. Sup. 1932). The Supreme Court has said that \"before a\nstatute will be construed to include land under navigable\nwaters, such as river beds and channels, it will have to be\nexpressed in plain and positive language and not in general\nlanguage.\"   Id. We believe that the underlined language of\narticle,5415axpressly   and unambiguously grants tidelands\nand submerged lands to the public school fund. Moreover, it\nhas been construed to have made this grant. Butler v. Sadler,\n399 S.W.Zd 411, 419 (Tex. Civ. App. -- Corpus Christrl966,\nwrit ref'd n.r.e.); Attorney General Opinion M-356  (1969).\nIn view of the clear language dedicating submerged glands to\nthe permanent school fund and the inability of the Legislature\nto revoke its grant, we conclude that,the Legislature could\nnot constitutionally grant Tract 1 to Corpus Christi without\nrequiring compensation to the permanent school fund.\n\n     Section 2 of the 1971 Act grants a construction easement\nover all three tracts in furtherance of the Corpus Christi-\nBeach restoration project. We believe that the grant of.\nthis easement was inextricably intertwined with the grant of\nthe restored beach to Corpus Christi. The invalidation of\nsection 6 impairs the purpose underlying section 2 so that\nthe latterprovision  cannot stand alone.\n\n     Although the Act contains a saving clause, it has no\nmeaning when sections 2 and 6 are removed. Therefore, we\nbelieve that the 1971 Act is unconstitutional in that it\nviolates article 7, sections 2, 4 and 5 of the Texas\nConstitution.\n\n\n\n\n                           p. 3713\n\fThe Honorable Bob Armstrong - page seven (H-881)\n\n\n\n                        SUMMARY\n\n            An Act granting the City of Corpus Christi\n            submerged lands without compensation to\n            the Public Free School Fund is unconstitu-\n            tional in that it violates article 7,\n            sections 2, 4 and 5 of the Texas Constitu-\n            tion.\n\n                                  _Very truly yours,\n\n\n\n\n                                  Attorney General of Texas\nAPPROVED:\n\n\n\n\njwb\n\n\n\n\n                             p. 3714\n\f",

The Act\ndoes not provide for compensating the public school fund for\nthe grant of Tract 1, the removal of materials from the borrow\narea, or any other use of the property encompassed in the\nconstruction easement.\n\n     We will first consider the grant of Tract 1 to Corpus\nChristi, the validity of which turns on whether the land has\nbeen dedicated to the permanent school fund. Article 7, section\n2 of the Texas Constitution determines the components of the\npermanent school fund.\n\n          All funds, lands and other property heretofore\n          set apart and appropriated for the support of\n          the public schools; all the alternate sections\n          of land reserved by the State out of grants\n          heretofore made or that may hereafter be made\n          to railroads or other corporations of any\n          nature whatsoever; one haif of the ublic\n          domain --\n                 of the State; ~ndl~um~o           mone\n          fhatmay come toe\n                         --      Statgrme      -%?\n                                                 sa  e of\n          Fportionf   --  same  .  . . .(jEm$%isdded).\n\nArticle 7, section 4 requires that these lands be sold.\n\n          The lands herein set apart to the Public\n          Free School fund shall be sold under such\n          regulations, at such times, and on such\n          terms as may be prescribed by law . . . .\n\nThis provision    prevents the Legislature from giving the land\naway, although    it might postpone sale and instead lease the\nland.

Acts 1900, 26th Leg., 1st C. S.,\nch. 11 at 29. When the Legislature subsequently placed\nlands excluded by the Settlement Act in the public school\nfund, its decision was also final as to them. Attorney\nGeneral Opinion M-356  (1969).\n\n     In 1941 the Legislature enacted article. 5415a, V.T.C.S.\nThe pertinent portion of that statute reads as follows:\n\n             Sec. 3.  The State of Texas owns, in\n          full and complete ownership, the waters\n          of the Gulf of Mexico and of the arms of\n          the said Gulf, and the beds and shores of\n          the Gulf of Mexico, and the arms of the\n          Gulf of Mexico, including all lands that\n          are covered by the waters of the said\n          Gulf and its 'arms, either at low tide or\n          high tide, within the boundaries of Texas,\n          as herein fixed; -----\n                           and that all of said\n          lands --\n                are set apart -and granted --\n                                           to the\n\n\n\n\n                             p. 3712\n\fThe Honorable Bob Armstrong - page six (H-881)\n\n\n\n          Permanent Public Free School Fund of the\n          State, andmbeeT?f-%?mbenefit\n          ofe    Public Free School Fund of this\n          State according to the provisions of law\n          governing the same.   (Emphasis added).\n\nGrants of lands under navigable waters are strictly construed\nagainst the grantee, and any ambiguity will be resolved in\nfavor of the State. State v. Bradford, 50 S.W.Zd 1065, 1075\n(Tex. Sup. 1932). The Supreme Court has said that \"before a\nstatute will be construed to include land under navigable\nwaters, such as river beds and channels, it will have to be\nexpressed in plain and positive language and not in general\nlanguage.\"   Id. We believe that the underlined language of\narticle,5415axpressly   and unambiguously grants tidelands\nand submerged lands to the public school fund. Moreover, it\nhas been construed to have made this grant. Butler v. Sadler,\n399 S.W.Zd 411, 419 (Tex. Civ. App. -- Corpus Christrl966,\nwrit ref'd n.r.e.); Attorney General Opinion M-356  (1969).\nIn view of the clear language dedicating submerged glands to\nthe permanent school fund and the inability of the Legislature\nto revoke its grant, we conclude that,the Legislature could\nnot constitutionally grant Tract 1 to Corpus Christi without\nrequiring compensation to the permanent school fund.\n\n     Section 2 of the 1971 Act grants a construction easement\nover all three tracts in furtherance of the Corpus Christi-\nBeach restoration project. We believe that the grant of.\nthis easement was inextricably intertwined with the grant of\nthe restored beach to Corpus Christi. The invalidation of\nsection 6 impairs the purpose underlying section 2 so that\nthe latterprovision  cannot stand alone.\n\n     Although the Act contains a saving clause, it has no\nmeaning when sections 2 and 6 are removed. Therefore, we\nbelieve that the 1971 Act is unconstitutional in that it\nviolates article 7, sections 2, 4 and 5 of the Texas\nConstitution.\n\n\n\n\n                           p. 3713\n\fThe Honorable Bob Armstrong - page seven (H-881)\n\n\n\n                        SUMMARY\n\n            An Act granting the City of Corpus Christi\n            submerged lands without compensation to\n            the Public Free School Fund is unconstitu-\n            tional in that it violates article 7,\n            sections 2, 4 and 5 of the Texas Constitu-\n            tion.\n\n                                  _Very truly yours,\n\n\n\n\n                                  Attorney General of Texas\nAPPROVED:\n\n\n\n\njwb\n\n\n\n\n                             p. 3714\n\f</pre>",
