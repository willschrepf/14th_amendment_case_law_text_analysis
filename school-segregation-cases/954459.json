Patrick Murray for Appellants\n\n        Victor D. Radel for Appellees\n\fCase No. 3-09-15\n\n\nPRESTON, J.\n\n       {¶1} Plaintiffs-appellants, Jane Miller and Louise Murray (collectively\n\n“appellants”), appeal the Crawford County Court of Common Pleas’ judgment\n\nentry dismissing their complaint against defendants-appellees, Delores Cass,\n\nindividually (hereinafter “Cass”), Dolores Cass as Trustee of the Doris Pittenger\n\nTrust, Dolores Cass as Trustee of the Dolores Cass Trust, Doris Pittenger, Trustee\n\nof the R.M. Pittenger Trust and Joint Trust (hereinafter “Doris”) (collectively\n\n“appellees”). For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n\n       {¶2} Jane and Louise are Reid M. Pittenger’s (hereinafter “Reid”)\n\ndaughters from his first marriage, and Cass is Doris’ only daughter from a\n\nprevious marriage. On July 14, 1992, when Reid was approximately eighty-nine\n\n(89) years of age, Cass helped Reid select a Columbus attorney to prepare the Reid\n\nM. Pittenger Trust (hereinafter “R.M. Trust”) and Reid’s last will and testament.\n\n(First Amended Complaint, Doc. No. 10, at ¶¶1, 10); (Plaintiffs’ Exs. 1, 3). Reid’s\n\nwill disposed of his real and personal property by reference to the R.M. Trust.\n\nReid and Doris served as co-trustees of the R.M. Trust. On September 10, 1992,\n\nReid and Doris created the Reid M. Pittenger and Doris H. Pittenger Joint\n\nRevocable Living Trust (hereinafter “Joint Trust”). (First Amended Complaint,\n\nDoc. No. 10, ¶1); (Plaintiffs’ Ex. 2). Reid and Doris served as co-trustees of the\n\nJoint Trust.\n\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fCase No. 3-09-15\n\n\n       {¶3} On July 3, 2002, Reid died, and his estate was never probated as all\n\nhis assets were in the R.M. Trust. (First Amended Complaint, Doc. No. 10, at ¶3);\n\n(Plaintiffs’ Exs. 1, 3). Doris served as trustee of the R.M. Trust and the Joint Trust\n\nthereafter until her death on January 9, 2009. (First Amended Complaint, Doc. No.\n\n10, at ¶4).\n\n       {¶4} On April 24, 2009, Jane and Louise filed a complaint against\n\nappellees alleging, in pertinent part, that: Trustee Doris ignored the mandates of\n\nthe trusts and illegally and improperly removed hundreds of thousands of dollars\n\nfrom the trusts and deposited this money into trusts and funds for which Cass was\n\nthe beneficiary; Cass controlled Trustee Doris’ actions as she was in her eighties\n\n(80’s) and was financially unsophisticated; Cass took control of Reid and Doris’\n\naffairs when they were mentally feeble because of age; and Trustee Doris, under\n\nthe control of Cass, committed several breaches of her fiduciary duties, including:\n\nillegally diverting funds and self-dealing, negligent management of assets, breach\n\nof the trust agreement, spoliation of records, plundering trust assets, failing to\n\nfollow the grantor’s instructions, and conversion. (Complaint, Doc. No. 1); (First\n\nAmended Complaint, Doc. No. 10).\n\n       {¶5} On May 19, 2009, appellees filed a Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion to\n\ndismiss for failure to state a claim. (Doc. No. 5). Appellees alleged that the\n\n\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fCase No. 3-09-15\n\n\ncomplaint had to be dismissed against Trustee Doris as she was deceased, and that\n\nthe allegations against Cass fail because she owed Jane and Louise no duty. (Id.).\n\n       {¶6} On June 25, 2009, Jane and Louise filed a reply to the motion to\n\ndismiss arguing that Cass could be held liable since she was a ‘de facto’ trustee.\n\n(Doc. No. 8). On June 30, 2009, appellees filed a reply brief in support of their\n\nmotion to dismiss arguing that: Cass was not a trustee; Cass had no privity of\n\ncontract with Jane and Louise; and that Jane and Louise never alleged that Cass\n\nwas a ‘de facto’ trustee in the complaint. (Doc. No. 9).\n\n       {¶7} On July 2, 2009, Jane and Louise filed their first amended complaint\n\nwith substantially the same allegations, but added allegations with regard to the\n\nappointment of a commissioner for Doris’ estate. (Doc. No. 10).\n\n       {¶8} On July 9, 2009, appellees filed a Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion to dismiss\n\nthe amended complaint arguing that: Doris was not a proper party as she was\n\ndeceased; Cass was not liable as the complaint failed to set forth any duty; and\n\nDoris was not acting as Cass’ agent. (Doc. No. 12).\n\n       {¶9} On July 16, 2009, Jane and Louise filed a response to the motion to\n\ndismiss arguing that: Cass was a ‘de facto’ trustee as she controlled Doris’\n\nfinances and decisions; and Cass was liable for conversion and constructive trust.\n\n(Doc. No. 14).\n\n\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fCase No. 3-09-15\n\n\n       {¶10} On July 27, 2009, appellees filed a reply arguing that: Cass was not\n\nliable for conversion or constructive trust since Doris did not commit any\n\n“wrongful act” as she had absolute discretion to manage the trust funds. (Doc. No.\n\n15).\n\n       {¶11} On August 6, 2009, Jane and Louise filed a sur reply to appellees’\n\nmotion to dismiss arguing that: Cass exerted undue influence upon Reid when he\n\nwas executing the trust agreements and his will; Cass controlled Doris and aided\n\nand abetted her in breaching her fiduciary duties; Cass supervised Doris’ negligent\n\nhandling of trust assets and ignoring trust provisions; Cass recklessly and\n\nintentionally assisted Doris in ignoring the trust provisions; Cass plundered trust\n\nassets for her own benefit; and Cass converted trust funds. (Doc. No. 18).\n\n       {¶12} On August 10, 2009, appellees filed a response arguing that the\n\nterms of the trust agreement, attached to the complaint, provided Doris with\n\nunfettered discretion to manage the trust funds; and therefore, Jane and Louise’s\n\ncomplaint fails to allege any wrong. (Doc. No. 20).\n\n       {¶13} On August 12, 2009, appellees filed a motion to supplement their\n\nCiv.R. 12(B)(6) motion asserting that Jane and Louise withdrew their motion to\n\nreopen Doris’ estate. (Doc. No. 21)\n\n       {¶14} On August 14, 2009, Jane and Louise filed a motion to accept\n\nsupplemental documents in response to appellees’ Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion wherein\n\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fCase No. 3-09-15\n\n\nthey informed the trial court that an application for the appointment of an\n\nadministrator for Doris’ estate was pending in Crawford County Probate Court.\n\n(Doc. No. 22). That same day, Jane and Louise also filed a motion to amend their\n\ncomplaint to name the administrator of Doris’ estate as a party defendant. (Doc.\n\nNo. 23)\n\n       {¶15} On September 3, 2009, the parties entered a stipulated order wherein\n\nthey agreed that: Jane and Louise will move the Crawford County Probate Court\n\nto reopen the Estate of Doris H. Pittenger, and defendant Cass will not oppose the\n\nmotion and will accept appointment as administrator; the plaintiffs had filed a\n\nmotion to amend the complaint to name the estate in these proceedings; that the\n\ntrial court has all the legal issues before it, and the appointment of an administrator\n\ndoes not affect the legal issues herein; neither party will appeal the trial court’s\n\nruling on the basis that the estate is not properly before the court; the trial court’s\n\nruling is binding upon all parties, including the estate of Doris Pittenger; and oral\n\nargument as to the motion should be waived. (Doc. No. 24).\n\n       {¶16} On September 9, 2009, the trial court granted defendants’ Civ.R.\n\n12(B)(6) motion to dismiss finding that the plaintiffs could not maintain an action\n\nfor conversion or constructive trust because the trust language gave Doris\n\ndiscretion in handling the trust assets and exempted her from liability. As such,\n\n\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\fCase No. 3-09-15\n\n\nJane and Louise failed to allege any “wrongful” act done by Doris; and they could\n\nnot recover against Cass if they could not recover against Doris. (Doc. No. 25).1\n\n        {¶17} On September 21, 2009, Jane and Louise filed a motion for\n\nreconsideration. (Doc. No. 27). On October 2, 2009, Jane and Louise filed a\n\nnotice of appeal (Doc. No. 30).                Jane and Louise now appeal raising eleven\n\nassignments of error for our review. We have elected to combine appellants’\n\nassignments of error where appropriate.\n\n                                ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR A\n\n        THE   COURT    ERRONEOUSLY     IGNORED THE\n        COMPLAINT AND MADE RULINGS OF FACT AND LAW\n        NOT RELEVANT UNDER A RULE 12 MOTION.\n\n                                ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR H\n\n        THE COURT ERRED IN IMPROPERLY CREATING AN\n        AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE FOR A DEFENDANT IN RULING\n        ON A RULE 12(B)(6) MOTION.\n\n                                ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR G\n\n        THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN IGNORING THE\n        ALLEGATIONS OF UNDUE INFLUENCE AND DURESS\n        AND DISMISSED PLAINTIFFS’ COMPLAINT ON THE\n        SAME.\n\n        {¶18} In assignment of error A, Jane and Louise argue that the trial court\n\nfailed to apply the applicable standards under Civ.R. 12(B)(6) when ruling on the\n\n\n\n1\n  On October 30, 2009, the trial court entered a nunc pro tunc entry clarifying that its judgment dismissed\nthe complaint and the case as to all defendants.\n\n\n                                                  -7-\n\fCase No. 3-09-15\n\n\nmotion. Specifically, Jane and Louise argue that the trial court failed to note any\n\ndeficiency in the complaint in its ruling, and that they should be allowed to present\n\nevidence on the validity of the trust documents as well as the manner by which the\n\ntrusts were administered. In assignment of error H, plaintiffs allege that the trial\n\ncourt improperly considered Trustee Doris Pittenger’s affirmative defense of a\n\nrelease from liability under the R.M. Trust. In assignment of error G, plaintiffs\n\nargue that the trial court erred by dismissing the complaint as to its allegations of\n\nundue influence in the creation of the trust documents. We disagree.\n\n       {¶19} “A motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief\n\ncan be granted is procedural and tests the sufficiency of the complaint.” State ex\n\nrel. Hanson v. Guernsey Cty. Bd. of Commrs. (1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 545, 548, 605\n\nN.E.2d 378, citing Assn. for the Defense of the Washington Local School Dist. v.\n\nKiger (1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 116, 117, 537 N.E.2d 1292, 1293. For that reason, a\n\ntrial court may not rely upon evidence or allegations outside the complaint when\n\nruling on a Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion. State ex rel. Fuqua v. Alexander (1997), 79\n\nOhio St.3d 206, 207, 680 N.E.2d 985.          However, “[a] copy of any written\n\ninstrument attached to a pleading is a part of the pleading for all purposes”; and\n\ntherefore, the trial court may consider attached written instruments for purposes of\n\na motion to dismiss. Civ.R. 10(C); Davis v. Widman, 184 Ohio App.3d 705, 2009-\n\nOhio-5430, 922 N.E.2d 272, ¶18, citing Keenan v. Adecco Emp. Servs., Inc., 3d\n\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fCase No. 3-09-15\n\n\nDist. No. 1-06-10, 2006-Ohio-3633, ¶¶8-9, citing Slife v. Kundtz Properties, Inc.\n\n(1974), 40 Ohio App.2d 179, 185-86, 318 N.E.2d 557. “If the plaintiff decides to\n\nattach documents to his complaint, which he claims establish his case, such\n\ndocuments can be used to his detriment to dismiss the case if they along with the\n\ncomplaint itself establish a failure to state a claim.” Adlaka v. Giannini, 7th Dist.\n\nNo. 05 MA 105, 2006-Ohio-4611, ¶34, citing Aleman v. Ohio Adult Parole Auth.\n\n(Apr. 24, 1995), 4th Dist. No. 94CA17. “Dismissals under Civ.R. 12(B)(6) are\n\nproper where the language of the writing is clear and unambiguous.” Keenan,\n\n2006-Ohio-3633, at ¶9.\n\n       {¶20} To sustain a Civ.R. 12(B)(6) dismissal, “it must appear beyond\n\ndoubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of the claim that would\n\nentitle the plaintiff to relief.” LeRoy v. Allen, Yurasek, & Merklin, 114 Ohio St.3d\n\n323, 2007-Ohio-3608, 872 N.E.2d 254, ¶14, citing Doe v. Archdiocese of\n\nCincinnati, 109 Ohio St.3d 491, 2006-Ohio-2625, 849 N.E.2d 268, ¶11.\n\nAdditionally, the complaint’s allegations must be construed as true, and any\n\nreasonable inferences must be construed in the nonmoving party’s favor. Id., citing\n\nMaitland v. Ford Motor Co., 103 Ohio St.3d 463, 2004-Ohio-5717, 816 N.E.2d\n\n1061, ¶11; Kenty v. Transamerica Premium Ins. Co. (1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 415,\n\n418, 650 N.E.2d 863.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\fCase No. 3-09-15\n\n\n       {¶21} When reviewing a Civ.R. 12(B)(6) decision, this Court must\n\ndetermine whether the complaint’s allegations constitute a statement of a claim\n\nunder Civ.R. 8(A). Keenan, 2006-Ohio-3633, at ¶7. “All that the civil rules\n\nrequire is a short, plain statement of the claim that will give the defendant fair\n\nnotice of the plaintiff’s claim and the grounds upon which it is based.” Patrick v.\n\nWertman (1996), 113 Ohio App.3d 713, 716, 681 N.E.2d 1385, citing Kelley v. E.\n\nCleveland (Oct. 28, 1982), 8th Dist. No. 44448. See, also, Civ.R. 8(A)(1). When\n\nfiling a claim pursuant to Civ.R. 8(A), “[a] party is not required to “plead the legal\n\ntheory of recovery”; furthermore, “a pleader is not bound by any particular theory\n\nof a claim but that the facts of the claim as developed by the proof establish the\n\nright to relief.” Illinois Controls, Inc. v. Langham (1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 512, 526,\n\n639 N.E.2d 771. Indeed, “that each element of [a] cause of action was not set\n\nforth in the complaint with crystalline specificity” does not render it fatally\n\ndefective and subject to dismissal. Border City Sav. & Loan Ass’n v. Moan (1984),\n\n15 Ohio St.3d 65, 66, 472 N.E.2d 350. See, also, Parks v. Parks (Mar. 5, 1998), 3d\n\nDist No. 1-97-60, at *2. However,\n\n       the complaint must contain either direct allegations on every\n       material point necessary to sustain a recovery on any legal\n       theory, even though it may not be the theory suggested or\n       intended by the pleader, or contain allegations from which an\n       inference fairly may be drawn that evidence on these material\n       points will be introduced at trial.\n\n\n\n\n                                        - 10 -\n\fCase No. 3-09-15\n\n\nFancher v. Fancher (1982), 8 Ohio App.3d 79, 83, 455 N.E.2d 1344, citing 5\n\nWright & Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure: Civil (1969), at 120-123, Section\n\n1216.\n\n        {¶22} This Court reviews de novo a trial court’s decision to grant or deny a\n\nCiv.R. 12(B)(6) motion. RMW Ventures, L.L.C. v. Stover Family Invest.,\n\nL.L.C., 161 Ohio App.3d 819, 2005-Ohio-3226, 832 N.E.2d 118, ¶8, citing Hunt v.\n\nMarksman Prod. (1995), 101 Ohio App.3d 760, 762, 656 N.E.2d 726. This Court\n\nmay substitute, without deference, its judgment for that of the trial court when\n\nreviewing de novo. Castlebrook, Ltd. v. Dayton Properties Ltd. Partnership\n\n(1992), 78 Ohio App.3d 340, 346, 604 N.E.2d 808.\n\n        {¶23} In its judgment entry, the trial court set forth the correct Civ.R.\n\n12(B)(6) standard when ruling on the motion to dismiss. (Sept. 9, 2009 JE, Doc.\n\nNo. 25). Therefore, contrary to plaintiffs’ assertions the trial court applied the\n\ncorrect standard when ruling upon the motion to dismiss. As such, plaintiffs’\n\nassignment of error A lacks merit.\n\n        {¶24} Plaintiffs further allege that the trial court created an affirmative\n\ndefense by improperly considering the release from liability provided to trustee\n\nDoris Pittenger under the terms of the R.M. Trust. This argument too lacks merit\n\nbecause the trial court may consider the trust language for purposes of a motion to\n\ndismiss. Civ.R. 10(C); Davis, 2009-Ohio-5430, at ¶18, citing Keenan, 2006-Ohio-\n\n\n\n                                       - 11 -\n\fCase No. 3-09-15\n\n\n3633, at ¶¶8-9, citing Slife, 40 Ohio App.2d at 185-86.      As such, plaintiffs’\n\nassignment of error H lacks merit.\n\n       {¶25} Next, plaintiffs assert in assignment of error G that the trial court\n\nerred by dismissing their claim of undue influence in the creation of the trust\n\nagreements.\n\n       A trust is void to the extent its creation was induced by fraud,\n       duress, or undue influence. As used in this section, “fraud,”\n       “duress,” and “undue influence” have the same meanings for\n       trust validity purposes as they have for purposes of determining\n       the validity of a will.\n\nR.C. 5804.06. “The elements of undue influence include the following: (1) a\n\nsusceptible party; (2) another’s opportunity to exert influence; (3) the fact of\n\nimproper influence exerted or attempted; and (4) the result showing the effect of\n\nsuch improper influence.” Lah v. Rogers (1998), 125 Ohio App.3d 164, 171, 707\n\nN.E.2d 1208, citing Krischbaum v. Dillon (1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 58, 65, 567\n\nN.E.2d 1291; West v. Henry (1962), 173 Ohio St. 498, 510-11, 184 N.E.2d 200.\n\n“Undue influence” requires a two-step inquiry: first, it must be determined\n\nwhether the transaction was the result of influence brought to bear upon the\n\nsusceptible party; and second, it must be determined whether that influence was\n\nactually “undue.” Id., citing Dillon, 58 Ohio St.3d at 68.\n\n       {¶26} The Ohio Supreme Court defined “undue influence” in West v.\n\nHenry as follows:\n\n\n\n                                        - 12 -\n\fCase No. 3-09-15\n\n\n      Similarly, ‘undue influence to avoid a will, must so overpower\n      and subjugate the mind of the testator as to destroy his free\n      agency and make him express the will of another rather than his\n      own, and the mere presence of influence is not sufficient. Undue\n      influence must be present or operative at the time of the\n      execution of the will resulting in dispositions which the testator\n      would not otherwise have made.’ 94 C.J.S. Wills § 224, p. 1064.\n\n      General influence, however strong or controlling, is not undue\n      influence unless brought to bear directly upon the act of making\n      the will. If the will or codicil, as finally executed, expresses the\n      will, wishes and desires of the testator, the will is not void because\n      of undue influence.\n\n      ***\n\n      The mere existence of undue influence, or an opportunity to\n      exercise it, although coupled with an interest or motive to do so, is\n      not sufficient, but such influence must be actually exerted on the\n      mind of the testator with respect to the execution of the will in\n      question. It must be shown that such influence, whether exerted at\n      the time of the making of the will or prior thereto, was operative at\n      the time of its execution or was directly connected therewith. It\n      must be shown that undue influence was exercised with the\n      object of procuring a will in favor of particular parties.\n\n173 Ohio St. at 501 (emphasis in original). “To determine whether the particular\n\ninfluence was undue, a court must consider ‘whether the influence was reasonable,\n\ngiven all the prevailing facts and circumstances.’ ” Jackson v. Jackson, 3d Dist.\n\nNo. 11-07-11, 2008-Ohio-1482, ¶11, quoting Dillon, 58 Ohio St.3d at 68.\n\n      {¶27} The complaint herein alleged, in pertinent part, that:\n\n      Dolores Cass took control of the affairs of Reid Pittenger and\n      Doris Pittenger at a time in their lives when they were mentally\n      feeble because of age. She convinced Reid Pittenger to abandon\n      his long-time attorney in Galion, Ohio and to allow her to direct\n\n\n                                      - 13 -\n\fCase No. 3-09-15\n\n\n      all matters concerning his estate. She selected a Columbus\n      attorney unknown to him and directed him on the types of\n      testamentary and legal instruments he would need. She\n      convinced him that he no longer needed the counsel and advice\n      from his attorney son-in-law. She also directed and controlled\n      Doris Pittenger in all of her legal matters and actions.\n\n(First Amended Complaint, Doc. No. 10, at ¶10.). Construing this allegation in a\n\nlight most favorable to plaintiffs as the non-moving party, we cannot conclude the\n\ncomplaint alleges a cause of action for undue influence. Although it appears from\n\nthe complaint that plaintiffs allege that Cass convinced her step-father to abandon\n\nhis “long-time” local attorney and seek different counsel, the complaint fails to\n\nallege that Reid or Doris’ will was overcome and that they did not exercise their\n\nindependent judgment.      Henry, 173 Ohio St. at 501.          Furthermore, and\n\nimportantly, Plaintiffs failed to allege that Cass’ influence “result[ed] in\n\ndispositions which the testator[s] would not otherwise have made.” Id. The only\n\nallegations of negative ‘effects’ of Cass’ influence upon the grantors concern the\n\nadministration of the trust agreements by Trustee Doris Pittenger, not, as is\n\nrequired, allegations that Cass’ influence affected the execution of the trust\n\nagreements by Reid and Doris Pittenger. Henry, 173 Ohio St. at 501. In fact, the\n\ntestamentary documents reflect that Reid gave plaintiffs an interest in his home\n\nand contingent interests in those assets which remained in the R.M. and Doris\n\nPittenger Trusts. (Plaintiffs’ Exs. 1-3). Furthermore, as plaintiffs concede, Cass\n\nwas not a named beneficiary of the R.M. Trust or a devisee under Reid’s will.\n\n\n                                      - 14 -\n\fCase No. 3-09-15\n\n\n(Plaintiffs’ Exs. 1, 3). Finally, although Reid may have not sought his son-in-\n\nlaw’s advice or counsel, he did name him as the first contingent executor of his\n\nwill and the successor trustee of the R.M. Trust. (Plaintiffs’ Exs. 1, 3). Viewed in\n\na light most favorable to plaintiffs, we conclude that the allegations made in the\n\ncomplaint amount, at best, to allegations of “general influence” made by a\n\ndaughter to her mother and step-father, not “undue influence” as is required.\n\nHenry, 173 Ohio St. at 501.\n\n      {¶28} For all these reasons, plaintiffs’ assignments of error A, H, and G are\n\noverruled.\n\n                         ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR J\n\n      THE COURT ERRED IN UTILIZING TWO PARAGRAPHS\n      OUT OF CONTEXT IN DISMISSING PLAINTIFFS’\n      COMPLAINT.

Pittenger, as Co-Trustee.\n\n(R.M. Trust, Plaintiff’s Ex. 1). Upon Reid’s death, the trust estate was to be\n\ndivided into two trusts: Trust Number 1 (Marital Trust) and Trust Number 2\n\n(Child/Children’s Trust). (R.M. Trust, Article II, Plaintiffs’ Ex. 1). With regard to\n\nthe Marital Trust, Doris, as trustee, was directed to “pay the net income of Trust\n\nNumber 1 to or for the benefit of [Doris] annually, or more frequently if [Doris]\n\ndirects.” (R.M. Trust, Article II, Section 8(a), Plaintiff’s Ex. 1) (emphasis added).\n\n\n\n                                       - 18 -\n\fCase No. 3-09-15\n\n\nArticle II, Section 8(b) provided that “[Trustee Doris] may pay to or for the benefit\n\nof [Doris] from time to time such amounts of the principal of Trust Number 1 as\n\n[Trustee Doris] in [her] discretion may determine to be necessary or desirable for\n\nthe health, education, support, maintenance, comfort, and happiness of [Doris].”\n\n(Plaintiff’s Ex. 1) (emphasis added).\n\n       {¶35} With regard to Trust Number 2, the trust agreement provided:\n\n       (a) [Trustee Doris] may in [her] sole discretion pay to or for the\n       benefit of [Doris] and the Grantor’s children and their issue so\n       much of the net income principal of Trust Number 2 as is\n       necessary for the health, education, support, and maintenance of\n       [Doris] * * * The welfare of [Doris] is Grantor’s primary concern,\n       and [Trustee Doris] shall be liberal in making payments of income\n       and principal to or for the benefit of [Doris]. However, [Trustee\n       Doris] shall not make payments of principal for Trust Number 2\n       to [Doris] until Trust Number 1 shall have been first exhausted\n       or until further liquidation of Trust Number 1 assets would, in\n       the sole discretion of [Trustee Doris], be inappropriate. [Trustee\n       Doris] is directed to consult [Doris] prior to making any\n       distribution of income or principal to any person other than\n       [Doris]. However, [Trustee Doris] shall not be required to follow\n       the recommendation of [Doris] concerning distribution of\n       income or principal from Trust Number 2.\n\n       (b) Upon the death of [Doris], trustee shall transfer the\n       principal of Trust Number 2 and all accumulations thereof by\n       proper instruments of conveyance to and among the children of\n       Grantor and their issue in such proportions and legal or\n       equitable interest as [Doris] shall appoint by specific reference to\n       this limited power of appointment in [Doris’] Last Will and\n       Testament. The purpose of this power of appointment is to\n       enable [Doris] to respond to changes in circumstance of\n       Grantor’s children and their issue which may occur subsequent\n       to Grantor’s death by adjusting the disposition of the assets of\n       Trust Number 2 at [Doris’] death.\n\n\n                                        - 19 -\n\fCase No. 3-09-15\n\n\n\n(R.M. Trust, Article II, Section 9(a), Plaintiff’s Ex. 1).\n\n       {¶36} Article III of the Trust provided that any of the principal of Trusts 1,\n\n2, and 3, or all of the trust estate, should be held as a single fund for the benefit of\n\nGrantor’s children and their issue divided into separate trusts under Article III.\n\n(Plaintiffs’ Ex. 1). Article V, Section 11 provided that the “[Trustee Doris] shall\n\nincur no liability for the reasonable and prudent exercise of or failure to exercise\n\nany and all duties, powers, and discretions enumerated in this agreement or\n\nconferred upon [Trustee Doris] by any provision of law.” (Plaintiff’s Ex. 1).\n\n       {¶37} The Reid M. Pittenger and Doris H. Pittenger Joint Revocable Trust\n\n(“Joint Trust”) was entered into between Reid and Doris as Grantors and co-\n\ntrustees. (Plaintiffs’ Ex. 2). During Reid and Doris’ lives, the trustee (Doris or\n\nReid) was required to pay to Doris and Reid or apply for their benefit “all of the\n\nnet income of the trust, and such amounts or all of the principal as [they] may\n\nrequest in writing from time to time[.]” (Joint Trust, Section 3, Plaintiffs’ Ex. 2).\n\nUpon the death of one of the grantor-spouses, the trust property was to be divided\n\ninto two trusts: Trust A (the marital trust) and Trust B (the family trust). (Id. at\n\nSection 5, Plaintiffs’ Ex. 2). With regard to Trust A, the trustee (Doris since she\n\nsurvived Reid) was instructed to “pay to [Doris], on an annual basis and no less\n\nfrequently than quarterly, all of the net income of trust A beginning as of the date\n\nof death of the first grantor-spouse’s death.” (Id. at Section 6(a)(i), Plaintiffs’ Ex.\n\n\n                                         - 20 -\n\fCase No. 3-09-15\n\n\n2). Doris, as trustee, was also instructed to “pay to [Doris] so much, none, or all\n\nof the principal of Trust A as [Trustee Doris], in [her] absolute discretion, shall\n\ndeem necessary or advisable to provide liberally for [Doris’] health, maintenance\n\nand support in reasonable comfort.” (Id. at Section 6(a)(ii), Plaintiffs’ Ex. 2)\n\n(emphasis added). Trustee Doris was further instructed to “pay to [Doris], * * *\n\nan amount equal to the greater of Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000) or five percent\n\n(5%) of the value of the principal of Trust A on the last day of each calendar year\n\nas [Doris] may in writing request in each calendar year.” (Id. at Section 6(a)(iii),\n\nPlaintiffs’ Ex. 2). Section 6(b) gave Doris the power to appoint the remaining\n\nportion of the principal of Trust A “to such one or more persons or organizations\n\nor [Doris’] estate, in such amounts, proportions, interests, or estates, and upon\n\nsuch trusts, terms, powers, and conditions, if any, as [Doris], alone and in all\n\nevents, may appoint by [her] valid Will[.]” (Plaintiffs’ Ex. 2) (emphasis added).\n\n       {¶38} With respect to Trust B, the family trust, Trustee Doris was directed\n\nto:\n\n       * * * distribute or accumulate, in [Trustee Doris’] sole discretion,\n       such portions of the income of this trust to, or for the benefit of,\n       [Doris] and children, in equal or unequal shares as [Trustee\n       Doris] deems advisable for their respective health, support,\n       maintenance and education, giving due regard to the respective\n       needs of each beneficiary, to the amount of income available to\n       them from other sources * * * and to their respective federal\n       income tax brackets.\n\n\n\n\n                                       - 21 -\n\fCase No. 3-09-15\n\n\n(Joint Trust, Section 7(a)(i), Plaintiffs’ Ex. 2) (emphasis added). The Joint Trust\n\nfurther provided that:\n\n       [Trustee Doris] shall also pay to [Doris] and to each living child\n       of ours so much, none or all of the principal of Trust B as\n       [Trustee Doris], in [her] absolute discretion, shall deem necessary\n       or advisable to provide liberally for the health, maintenance,\n       support in reasonable comfort, and education of [Doris] and\n       children, bearing in mind that our primary concern is for the care\n       and well-being of [Doris].\n\n(Id. at Section 7(a)(ii), Plaintiffs’ Ex. 2) (emphasis added). The Joint Trust also\n\nprovided that “[Trustee Doris] shall pay to [Doris], beginning with the calendar\n\nyear following the year of the first spouse’s death, an amount equal to the greater\n\nof Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000) or five percent (5%) of the value of the\n\nprincipal as [Doris] may in writing request in each calendar year[.]” (Id. at Section\n\n7(a)(iii), Plaintiffs’ Ex. 2) (emphasis added). Upon Doris’ death, the successor\n\ntrustee was directed to:\n\n       retain and distribute the remaining amount of principal of Trust\n       B (as augmented by additions from Trust A, from [Doris’\n       estate], or otherwise) in the following manner: (A). One-half of\n       the net trust estate to Jane E. Miller and Louise E. Murray in\n       equal shares per stirpes with the exception that if Jane E. Miller\n       predecease us, or die [sic] prior to receiving her full distribution,\n       then her share shall pass to Ann Louise Miller; (B) One-half of\n       the net trust estate to Dolores H. Cass per stirpes.\n\n(Joint Trust, Section 7(b), Plaintiffs’ Ex. 2). The Joint Trust provided the trustee\n\nwith several “rights, powers, duties, and immunities to be exercised without court\n\norder or other authority upon such terms and conditions and at such times as the\n\n\n                                       - 22 -\n\fCase No. 3-09-15\n\n\ntrustee determines in its absolute discretion[.]” (Joint Trust, Section 10(a)-(t),\n\nPlaintiffs’ Ex. 2) (emphasis added).\n\n       {¶39} After reviewing the trust agreements in their entirety, with special\n\nattention to the provisions highlighted above, we cannot conclude that the trial\n\ncourt erred in dismissing Plaintiffs’ constructive trust, conversion, and third-party\n\nclaims. As an initial matter, although generally a court is required to assume the\n\nallegations in the complaint are true for purposes of a Civ.R. 12(B)(6), a court is\n\nnot required to assume those allegations in the complaint are true, which the plain\n\nlanguage of an attached, incorporated document clearly refutes. LeRoy, 2007-\n\nOhio-3608, at ¶14, citing Maitland, 2004-Ohio-5717, at ¶11; Cleveland Elec.\n\nIllum. Co. v. Pub. Util. Comm. (1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 521, 532, 668 N.E.2d 889\n\n(Moyer, C.J., dissenting), citing State ex rel. Edwards v. Toledo City School Dist.\n\nBd. of Edn. (1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 106, 109, 647 N.E.2d 799. See, also, Keenan,\n\n2006-Ohio-3633, at ¶¶11-13 (noting that the plain language of the agreements at\n\nissue contradicted appellants’ assertions and that the written agreement was an\n\ninsuperable bar to recovery). In an effort to limit Trustee Doris’ discretion under\n\nthe terms of the trusts, the plaintiffs alleged that “[s]he was permitted to draw on\n\nthe trust yields for “maintenance” and “reasonable comfort,” and that Doris had no\n\nsuch needs over the seven-year period she was trustee. (First Amended Complaint,\n\nDoc. No. 10, at ¶¶4-5). That is only a partial truth. The R.M. Trust allowed\n\n\n\n                                       - 23 -\n\fCase No. 3-09-15\n\n\nTrustee Doris to pay to herself, as the surviving spouse, income from the marital\n\ntrust annually or more frequently if she directed. (R.M. Trust, Section 8(a),\n\nPlaintiffs’ Ex. 1).    Doris was also permitted to draw from the marital trust\n\nprincipal in her discretion, which was necessary or desirable for her health,\n\neducation, support, maintenance, comfort, and happiness. (Id. at Section 8(b)).\n\nDoris was also given discretion to make payments of principal and income to\n\nherself from the children’s trust after the assets of the marital trust were exhausted.\n\n(Id. at Section 9). Reid also expressly indicated that Doris was his “primary\n\nconcern” and that she should be “liberal in making payments of income and\n\nprincipal to or for the benefit of [herself].” (Id.). Furthermore, the joint trust\n\nexpressly defined the term “maintenance” to account for Doris’ previous manner\n\nof living. (Joint Trust, Section 9(d), Plaintiffs’ Ex. 2). Both definitions of “health”\n\nand “support” also include the terms “but shall not be limited to,” indicating the\n\ngrantor’s intent to provide the trustee with discretion in administering the trust\n\nfunds. (Id. at Sections 9(c), (e), Plaintiffs’ Ex. 2).\n\n       {¶40} The thrust of Plaintiffs’ complaint is that Doris never divided the\n\ntrust assets into marital and family trusts as mandated by the trusts, and that Doris,\n\nas trustee, wrongfully caused funds to be withdrawn from the trusts for the direct\n\nand indirect benefit of her daughter, Dolores Cass. These allegations, even if true,\n\nfail as a matter of law under the express terms of the trust agreements. Under the\n\n\n\n                                          - 24 -\n\fCase No. 3-09-15\n\n\nterms of the the R.M. Trust, Trustee Doris was not required to physically segregate\n\nthe trust assets but could “hold them as an undivided fund for management and\n\ninvestment purposes.” (R.M. Trust, Article II, Section 2, Plaintiffs’ Ex. 1). Under\n\nthe terms of the trusts, Doris was permitted to withdraw money from the trusts for\n\nherself liberally, and the provisions read collectively evidence the grantor’s intent\n\nfor the same. That Doris placed the funds into accounts for which Cass was the\n\nprimary beneficiary is irrelevant. Furthermore, the joint trust agreement allowed\n\nDoris, in her sole or absolute discretion, to give her daughter Cass family trust\n\nfunds for her health, education, support, maintenance, and education. (Joint Trust,\n\nSections (7)(a)(i), (ii), Plaintiffs’ Ex. 2). The joint trust also provided that the\n\ndisbursements from the family trust income could be in unequal shares at Doris’\n\nsole discretion, and that Doris could pay “so much, none, or all of the principal” of\n\nthe family trust as Doris deemed necessary or advisable in her absolute discretion.\n\n(Id.). Under these circumstances, even if the allegations of plaintiffs’ complaint\n\nare assumed to be true, as required, the trust agreements are an insuperable bar to\n\ntheir recovery as Doris had the discretion to remove the trust funds liberally for\n\nher benefit and in unequal shares to the children.\n\n       {¶41} Since Doris’ actions, as alleged in the complaint, were not in\n\nviolation of the trust agreements, Plaintiffs’ fail to allege any commission of\n\nwrong, unconscionable conduct, artifice, concealment, or questionable means, or\n\n\n\n                                       - 25 -\n\fCase No. 3-09-15\n\n\nany act against equity and good conscience by which a court could impose a\n\nconstructive trust upon defendant Cass. Estate of Cowling, 2006-Ohio-2418, at\n\n¶18, citing Ferguson, 9 Ohio St.3d at 225, quoting 76 American Jurisprudence 2d\n\n(1975) 446, Trusts, Section 221. Similarly, plaintiffs have failed to allege any\n\n“wrongful act or disposition of plaintiff’s property rights” for which an action for\n\nconversion may be maintained. Dice, 2007-Ohio-5755, at ¶17, citations omitted.\n\nFurthermore, since Doris has not committed any breach of the trust agreements,\n\neven assuming the allegations of the complaint to be true, plaintiffs have failed to\n\nallege a breach for which Cass, as a third party, might be liable. 91 Ohio\n\nJurisprudence 3d Trusts, Section 497, citing Shuster, 139 Ohio St. 315.\n\n       {¶42} For these reasons, plaintiffs’ assignments of error J, B, C, and F are\n\nhereby overruled.\n\n                         ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR I\n\n       THE COURT ERRED IN IGNORING PLAINTIFFS’\n       COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY, SELF-\n       DEALING, CONFLICT OF INTEREST AND BREACH OF\n       STATUTORY DUTIES OF A TRUSTEE IN DISMISSING\n       PLAINTIFFS’ COMPLAINT ON A RULE 12(B)(6) MOTION.\n\n                         ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR K\n\n       THE COURT ERRED IN DISMISSING PLAINTIFFS’\n       COMPLAINT UNDER A RULE 12(B)(6) MOTION WHICH\n       ALLEGED THAT THE TRUSTEE IGNORED THE\n       SETTLOR’S WISHES IN HANDLING TRUST PROPERTY.\n\n\n\n\n                                       - 26 -\n\fCase No. 3-09-15\n\n\n       {¶43} In assignment of error I, plaintiffs allege that the trial court erred by\n\ndismissing their complaint for breach of fiduciary duty, self-dealing, conflict of\n\ninterest, and breach of statutory duties. In assignment of error K, plaintiffs allege\n\nthat the trial court erred in dismissing their complaint because the trustee ignored\n\nthe settlor’s wishes in handling the trust property. We disagree.\n\n       {¶44} As an initial matter, the Plaintiffs never asserted breaches of\n\nstatutory duties in their initial or amended complaint or their multiple filings in\n\nresponse to the motion to dismiss. (Doc. Nos. 1, 8, 10, 14, 18). In fact, plaintiffs\n\nnever cited any of the statutes in their multiple filings in the trial court that they\n\nnow argue on appeal. It was not until after the trial court granted the motion to\n\ndismiss that plaintiffs asserted any breach of statutory duties. (Memo. in Support\n\nof Motion for Reconsideration, Doc. No. 28). “A party waives any error that he\n\ncould have, but did not, call to the trial court’s attention at a time when such error\n\ncould have been avoided or corrected by the trial court.” Cichanowicz v.\n\nCichanowicz, 3d Dist. No. 3-08-04, 2008-Ohio-4779, ¶26, quoting Butler v.\n\nButler, 4th Dist.

The Rules of Civil Procedure\n\ndo not provide for motions for reconsideration; and therefore, “motions for\n\nreconsideration of a final judgment in the trial court are a nullity.” Pitts v. Dept. of\n\n\n\n                                         - 27 -\n\fCase No. 3-09-15\n\n\nTransp. (1981), 67 Ohio St.2d 378, 379-80, 423 N.E.2d 1105; Ham v. Ham, 3d\n\nDist. No. 16-07-04, 2008-Ohio-828, ¶15. Furthermore, any order that a trial court\n\nenters granting or denying any such motion is also a legal nullity. Robinson v.\n\nRobinson, 168 Ohio App.3d 476, 2006-Ohio-4282, 860 N.E.2d 1027, ¶17, citing\n\nPitts, 67 Ohio St.2d 378. As such, by raising the alleged breaches of statutory\n\nduties in their motion for reconsideration plaintiffs did not preserve the issue for\n\nappeal since the trial court could not have corrected its error(s) via a motion for\n\nreconsideration. Franks v. The Lima News (1996), 109 Ohio App.3d 408, 411, 672\n\nN.E.2d 245. See, also, Wilson v. PNC Bank, NA (May 5, 2000), 1st Dist. No. C-\n\n990727, at *3 (motion to reconsider did preserve issue where the motion to\n\nreconsider was filed before the trial court’s final judgment so the trial court could\n\nhave considered the ordinance); Stanley v. City of Miamisburg (Jan. 28, 2000), 2nd\n\nDist. No. 17912, at *4; Reagan v. Ranger Transp., Inc. (Aug. 9, 1996), 11th Dist.\n\nNos. 95-P-0123, 95-P-0124, at *3 (Civ.R. 60(B), not a motion for reconsideration,\n\nis the proper way to bring to the trial court’s attention its errors following a final\n\njudgment entry).\n\n       {¶45} Even assuming plaintiffs’ alleged breaches of statutory duties were\n\npreserved for appeal, we find their arguments meritless.          Plaintiffs cite the\n\nfollowing portions of three statutes in support of these assignments of error: R.C.\n\n5808.01, which provides, in pertinent part, “* * * the trustee shall administer the\n\n\n\n                                        - 28 -\n\fCase No. 3-09-15\n\n\ntrust in good faith, in accordance with its terms and purposes and the interests of\n\nthe beneficiaries[.]”; R.C. 5808.02, which provides, in pertinent part:\n\n       (A) A trustee shall administer the trust solely in the interests of\n       the beneficiaries.\n\n       (B) * * * a sale, encumbrance, or other transaction involving\n       the investment or management of trust property entered into by\n       the trustee for the trustee’s own personal account or that is\n       otherwise affected by a conflict between the trustee’s fiduciary\n       and personal interests is voidable by a beneficiary affected by\n       the transaction unless one of the following applies:\n\n       ***\n       (C) A sale, encumbrance, or other transaction involving the\n       investment or management of trust property is presumed to be\n       affected by a conflict between personal and fiduciary interests if\n       it is entered into by the trustee with one of the following:\n\n       ***\n       (2) The trustee’s descendant, sibling, or parent or the spouse of a\n       trustee’s descendant, sibling, or parent;\n\nand R.C. 5808.03, which provides, in pertinent part, “[i]f a trust has two or more\n\nbeneficiaries, the trustee shall act impartially in investing, managing, and\n\ndistributing the trust property, giving due regard to the beneficiaries’ respective\n\ninterests.” (Emphasis added).\n\n       {¶46} When reviewing these statutes, it is important to note that Doris was\n\nboth a trustee and the primary beneficiary under the trust agreements. The grantor\n\nexpressly stated in the R.M. Trust that Doris’ welfare was his “primary concern”\n\nand that Doris, as trustee, “shall be liberal in making payments of income and\n\n\n\n                                       - 29 -\n\fCase No. 3-09-15\n\n\nprincipal to or for [her] benefit.” (R.M. Trust, Article II, Section 9(a), Plaintiffs’\n\nEx. 1). Both trusts provided that any of trust assets remaining after Doris’ death\n\nwould be distributed into separate trusts for the children. (Id., at Article III); (Joint\n\nTrust, Section 7(b), Plaintiffs’ Ex. 2). Therefore, the children’s interest in the trust\n\nassets was contingent upon whether or not Doris, as the surviving spouse, used all\n\nof the trust funds prior to her death, which she had the right to do under the terms\n\nof the trust agreements. See Firestone v. Galbreath (1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 87, 89,\n\n616 N.E.2d 202 (Evans, J., concurring in part dissenting in part). After reading the\n\nterms of the trust agreements and the broad discretion afforded to Doris as trustee,\n\nalong with the settlor’s express statement that Doris was his “primary concern,”\n\nwe cannot conclude that she breached any duty, statutory or otherwise, owed to\n\nthe plaintiffs; rather, Doris, as trustee, gave due regard to their respective interests\n\nas contingent beneficiaries. R.C. 5808.03. Furthermore, we find R.C. 5808.02\n\ninapplicable here as that section deals with trustee’s self-dealing where the trustee\n\nis not also a beneficiary under the terms of the trust like Doris is here.\n\nFurthermore, even assuming the statute applies, R.C. 5808.02(B)(1) provides an\n\nexception where “[t]he transaction was authorized by the terms of the trust * * *,”\n\nwhich would preclude plaintiffs from prevailing on the allegations of so-called\n\nself-dealing against Doris.\n\n\n\n\n                                         - 30 -\n\fCase No. 3-09-15\n\n\n       {¶47} For all these reasons, plaintiffs’ assignments of error I and K lack\n\nmerit and are hereby overruled.\n\n                          ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR D\n\n       THE COURT ERRED IN DISMISSING                           PLAINTIFFS’\n       REQUEST FOR AN ACCOUNTING.\n\n                          ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR E\n\n       THE COURT ERRED IN DISMISSING PLAINTIFFS’\n       COMPLAINT REQUESTING RECORDS PERTAINING TO\n       THE HANDLING OF THE TRUST.\n\n       {¶48} In assignments of error D, plaintiffs argue that the trial court erred in\n\ndismissing their complaint because they were entitled to an accounting pursuant to\n\nthe terms of the joint trust agreement and R.C. 5808.13. In assignment of error E,\n\nplaintiffs assert that the trial court erred in dismissing its complaint, which alleged\n\nspoliation of records, and the trustee’s failure to keep adequate records. We\n\ndisagree.\n\n       {¶49} As an initial matter, plaintiffs failed to assert any breach of statutory\n\nduties in their multiple filing with the trial court prior to its entry of final\n\njudgment. (Doc. Nos. 1, 8, 10, 14, 18). It was not until after the trial court granted\n\nthe motion to dismiss that plaintiffs asserted any breach of statutory duties.\n\n(Memo. in Support of Motion for Reconsideration, Doc. No. 28).               As such,\n\nplaintiffs have waived their arguments with respect to the trustee’s purported\n\nbreach of its statutory duties. Cichanowicz at ¶26, quoting Butler at ¶19, citing\n\n\n                                        - 31 -\n\fCase No. 3-09-15\n\n\nStores Realty Co., 41 Ohio St.2d at 43; Riley, 16 Ohio App.3d at 463; Pitts, 67\n\nOhio St.2d at 379-80; Ham at ¶15; Robinson at ¶17, citing Pitts, 67 Ohio St.2d\n\n378; The Lima News, 109 Ohio App.3d at 411. See, also, PNC Bank, 1st Dist. No.\n\nC-990727, at *3; Stanley, 2nd Dist. No. 17912, at *4; Reagan, 11th Dist. Nos. 95-\n\nP-0123, 95-P-0124, at *3.\n\n       {¶50} Furthermore, plaintiffs’ complaint did not allege a breach of the\n\ntrustee’s duty to provide an accounting to them, as beneficiaries, as they now\n\nallege on appeal. At best, the complaint alleges that “[d]efendants had a duty to\n\nkeep an accurate accounting of all assets,” not a duty to provide plaintiffs with an\n\naccounting as they now argue. (First Amended Complaint, Doc. No. 10, at ¶12).\n\nPlaintiffs sought an accounting as a form of equitable relief to account for the trust\n\nassets in the prayer of their complaint. (Id., at Prayer for Relief). Plaintiffs did not\n\nassert a separate breach of duty for the trustee’s alleged failure to provide them\n\nwith an accounting as they now assert on appeal. (See id.). Therefore, plaintiffs’\n\nassignment of error D lacks merit.\n\n       {¶51} Next plaintiffs allege the trial court erred in dismissing their\n\ncomplaint for spoliation of records. The elements of spoliation are: “(1) pending\n\nor probable litigation involving the plaintiff, (2) knowledge on the part of\n\ndefendant that litigation exists or is probable, (3) willful destruction of evidence\n\nby defendant designed to disrupt the plaintiff’s case, (4) disruption of the\n\n\n\n                                         - 32 -\n\fCase No. 3-09-15\n\n\nplaintiff’s case, and (5) damages proximately caused by the defendant’s acts.”\n\nSmith v. Howard Johnson Co., Inc. (1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 28, 29, 615 N.E.2d\n\n1037. Plaintiffs failed to allege any facts which would state a cause of action for\n\nspoliation. Plaintiffs alleged that Doris and Cass “intentionally failed to maintain\n\nrecords as to the opening balances of each trust,” not that they willfully destroyed\n\nrecords in anticipation of litigation to disrupt plaintiffs’ case against them.\n\n(Amended complaint, Doc. No. 10, at ¶12). As such, the trial court did not err in\n\ndismissing plaintiffs’ complaint on this basis.\n\n       {¶52} Plaintiffs’ assignments of error D and E are, therefore, overruled.\n\n       {¶53} Having found no error prejudicial to the appellant herein in the\n\nparticulars assigned and argued, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\n                                                               Judgment Affirmed\n\nROGERS and SHAW, J.J., concur.\n\n/jlr\n\n\n\n\n                                        - 33 -\n\f",

Patrick Murray for Appellants\n\n        Victor D. Radel for Appellees\n\fCase No. 3-09-15\n\n\nPRESTON, J.\n\n       {¶1} Plaintiffs-appellants, Jane Miller and Louise Murray (collectively\n\n“appellants”), appeal the Crawford County Court of Common Pleas’ judgment\n\nentry dismissing their complaint against defendants-appellees, Delores Cass,\n\nindividually (hereinafter “Cass”), Dolores Cass as Trustee of the Doris Pittenger\n\nTrust, Dolores Cass as Trustee of the Dolores Cass Trust, Doris Pittenger, Trustee\n\nof the R.M. Pittenger Trust and Joint Trust (hereinafter “Doris”) (collectively\n\n“appellees”). For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n\n       {¶2} Jane and Louise are Reid M. Pittenger’s (hereinafter “Reid”)\n\ndaughters from his first marriage, and Cass is Doris’ only daughter from a\n\nprevious marriage. On July 14, 1992, when Reid was approximately eighty-nine\n\n(89) years of age, Cass helped Reid select a Columbus attorney to prepare the Reid\n\nM. Pittenger Trust (hereinafter “R.M. Trust”) and Reid’s last will and testament.\n\n(First Amended Complaint, Doc. No. 10, at ¶¶1, 10); (Plaintiffs’ Exs. 1, 3). Reid’s\n\nwill disposed of his real and personal property by reference to the R.M. Trust.\n\nReid and Doris served as co-trustees of the R.M. Trust. On September 10, 1992,\n\nReid and Doris created the Reid M. Pittenger and Doris H. Pittenger Joint\n\nRevocable Living Trust (hereinafter “Joint Trust”). (First Amended Complaint,\n\nDoc. No. 10, ¶1); (Plaintiffs’ Ex. 2). Reid and Doris served as co-trustees of the\n\nJoint Trust.\n\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fCase No. 3-09-15\n\n\n       {¶3} On July 3, 2002, Reid died, and his estate was never probated as all\n\nhis assets were in the R.M. Trust. (First Amended Complaint, Doc. No. 10, at ¶3);\n\n(Plaintiffs’ Exs. 1, 3). Doris served as trustee of the R.M. Trust and the Joint Trust\n\nthereafter until her death on January 9, 2009. (First Amended Complaint, Doc. No.\n\n10, at ¶4).\n\n       {¶4} On April 24, 2009, Jane and Louise filed a complaint against\n\nappellees alleging, in pertinent part, that: Trustee Doris ignored the mandates of\n\nthe trusts and illegally and improperly removed hundreds of thousands of dollars\n\nfrom the trusts and deposited this money into trusts and funds for which Cass was\n\nthe beneficiary; Cass controlled Trustee Doris’ actions as she was in her eighties\n\n(80’s) and was financially unsophisticated; Cass took control of Reid and Doris’\n\naffairs when they were mentally feeble because of age; and Trustee Doris, under\n\nthe control of Cass, committed several breaches of her fiduciary duties, including:\n\nillegally diverting funds and self-dealing, negligent management of assets, breach\n\nof the trust agreement, spoliation of records, plundering trust assets, failing to\n\nfollow the grantor’s instructions, and conversion. (Complaint, Doc. No. 1); (First\n\nAmended Complaint, Doc. No. 10).\n\n       {¶5} On May 19, 2009, appellees filed a Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion to\n\ndismiss for failure to state a claim. (Doc. No. 5). Appellees alleged that the\n\n\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fCase No. 3-09-15\n\n\ncomplaint had to be dismissed against Trustee Doris as she was deceased, and that\n\nthe allegations against Cass fail because she owed Jane and Louise no duty. (Id.).\n\n       {¶6} On June 25, 2009, Jane and Louise filed a reply to the motion to\n\ndismiss arguing that Cass could be held liable since she was a ‘de facto’ trustee.\n\n(Doc. No. 8). On June 30, 2009, appellees filed a reply brief in support of their\n\nmotion to dismiss arguing that: Cass was not a trustee; Cass had no privity of\n\ncontract with Jane and Louise; and that Jane and Louise never alleged that Cass\n\nwas a ‘de facto’ trustee in the complaint. (Doc. No. 9).\n\n       {¶7} On July 2, 2009, Jane and Louise filed their first amended complaint\n\nwith substantially the same allegations, but added allegations with regard to the\n\nappointment of a commissioner for Doris’ estate. (Doc. No. 10).\n\n       {¶8} On July 9, 2009, appellees filed a Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion to dismiss\n\nthe amended complaint arguing that: Doris was not a proper party as she was\n\ndeceased; Cass was not liable as the complaint failed to set forth any duty; and\n\nDoris was not acting as Cass’ agent. (Doc. No. 12).\n\n       {¶9} On July 16, 2009, Jane and Louise filed a response to the motion to\n\ndismiss arguing that: Cass was a ‘de facto’ trustee as she controlled Doris’\n\nfinances and decisions; and Cass was liable for conversion and constructive trust.\n\n(Doc. No. 14).\n\n\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fCase No. 3-09-15\n\n\n       {¶10} On July 27, 2009, appellees filed a reply arguing that: Cass was not\n\nliable for conversion or constructive trust since Doris did not commit any\n\n“wrongful act” as she had absolute discretion to manage the trust funds. (Doc. No.\n\n15).\n\n       {¶11} On August 6, 2009, Jane and Louise filed a sur reply to appellees’\n\nmotion to dismiss arguing that: Cass exerted undue influence upon Reid when he\n\nwas executing the trust agreements and his will; Cass controlled Doris and aided\n\nand abetted her in breaching her fiduciary duties; Cass supervised Doris’ negligent\n\nhandling of trust assets and ignoring trust provisions; Cass recklessly and\n\nintentionally assisted Doris in ignoring the trust provisions; Cass plundered trust\n\nassets for her own benefit; and Cass converted trust funds. (Doc. No. 18).\n\n       {¶12} On August 10, 2009, appellees filed a response arguing that the\n\nterms of the trust agreement, attached to the complaint, provided Doris with\n\nunfettered discretion to manage the trust funds; and therefore, Jane and Louise’s\n\ncomplaint fails to allege any wrong. (Doc. No. 20).\n\n       {¶13} On August 12, 2009, appellees filed a motion to supplement their\n\nCiv.R. 12(B)(6) motion asserting that Jane and Louise withdrew their motion to\n\nreopen Doris’ estate. (Doc. No. 21)\n\n       {¶14} On August 14, 2009, Jane and Louise filed a motion to accept\n\nsupplemental documents in response to appellees’ Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion wherein\n\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fCase No. 3-09-15\n\n\nthey informed the trial court that an application for the appointment of an\n\nadministrator for Doris’ estate was pending in Crawford County Probate Court.\n\n(Doc. No. 22). That same day, Jane and Louise also filed a motion to amend their\n\ncomplaint to name the administrator of Doris’ estate as a party defendant. (Doc.\n\nNo. 23)\n\n       {¶15} On September 3, 2009, the parties entered a stipulated order wherein\n\nthey agreed that: Jane and Louise will move the Crawford County Probate Court\n\nto reopen the Estate of Doris H. Pittenger, and defendant Cass will not oppose the\n\nmotion and will accept appointment as administrator; the plaintiffs had filed a\n\nmotion to amend the complaint to name the estate in these proceedings; that the\n\ntrial court has all the legal issues before it, and the appointment of an administrator\n\ndoes not affect the legal issues herein; neither party will appeal the trial court’s\n\nruling on the basis that the estate is not properly before the court; the trial court’s\n\nruling is binding upon all parties, including the estate of Doris Pittenger; and oral\n\nargument as to the motion should be waived.

Undue\n      influence must be present or operative at the time of the\n      execution of the will resulting in dispositions which the testator\n      would not otherwise have made.’ 94 C.J.S. Wills § 224, p. 1064.\n\n      General influence, however strong or controlling, is not undue\n      influence unless brought to bear directly upon the act of making\n      the will. If the will or codicil, as finally executed, expresses the\n      will, wishes and desires of the testator, the will is not void because\n      of undue influence.\n\n      ***\n\n      The mere existence of undue influence, or an opportunity to\n      exercise it, although coupled with an interest or motive to do so, is\n      not sufficient, but such influence must be actually exerted on the\n      mind of the testator with respect to the execution of the will in\n      question. It must be shown that such influence, whether exerted at\n      the time of the making of the will or prior thereto, was operative at\n      the time of its execution or was directly connected therewith. It\n      must be shown that undue influence was exercised with the\n      object of procuring a will in favor of particular parties.\n\n173 Ohio St. at 501 (emphasis in original). “To determine whether the particular\n\ninfluence was undue, a court must consider ‘whether the influence was reasonable,\n\ngiven all the prevailing facts and circumstances.’ ” Jackson v. Jackson, 3d Dist.\n\nNo. 11-07-11, 2008-Ohio-1482, ¶11, quoting Dillon, 58 Ohio St.3d at 68.\n\n      {¶27} The complaint herein alleged, in pertinent part, that:\n\n      Dolores Cass took control of the affairs of Reid Pittenger and\n      Doris Pittenger at a time in their lives when they were mentally\n      feeble because of age. She convinced Reid Pittenger to abandon\n      his long-time attorney in Galion, Ohio and to allow her to direct\n\n\n                                      - 13 -\n\fCase No. 3-09-15\n\n\n      all matters concerning his estate. She selected a Columbus\n      attorney unknown to him and directed him on the types of\n      testamentary and legal instruments he would need. She\n      convinced him that he no longer needed the counsel and advice\n      from his attorney son-in-law. She also directed and controlled\n      Doris Pittenger in all of her legal matters and actions.\n\n(First Amended Complaint, Doc. No. 10, at ¶10.). Construing this allegation in a\n\nlight most favorable to plaintiffs as the non-moving party, we cannot conclude the\n\ncomplaint alleges a cause of action for undue influence. Although it appears from\n\nthe complaint that plaintiffs allege that Cass convinced her step-father to abandon\n\nhis “long-time” local attorney and seek different counsel, the complaint fails to\n\nallege that Reid or Doris’ will was overcome and that they did not exercise their\n\nindependent judgment.      Henry, 173 Ohio St. at 501.          Furthermore, and\n\nimportantly, Plaintiffs failed to allege that Cass’ influence “result[ed] in\n\ndispositions which the testator[s] would not otherwise have made.” Id. The only\n\nallegations of negative ‘effects’ of Cass’ influence upon the grantors concern the\n\nadministration of the trust agreements by Trustee Doris Pittenger, not, as is\n\nrequired, allegations that Cass’ influence affected the execution of the trust\n\nagreements by Reid and Doris Pittenger. Henry, 173 Ohio St. at 501. In fact, the\n\ntestamentary documents reflect that Reid gave plaintiffs an interest in his home\n\nand contingent interests in those assets which remained in the R.M. and Doris\n\nPittenger Trusts. (Plaintiffs’ Exs. 1-3). Furthermore, as plaintiffs concede, Cass\n\nwas not a named beneficiary of the R.M. Trust or a devisee under Reid’s will.\n\n\n                                      - 14 -\n\fCase No. 3-09-15\n\n\n(Plaintiffs’ Exs. 1, 3). Finally, although Reid may have not sought his son-in-\n\nlaw’s advice or counsel, he did name him as the first contingent executor of his\n\nwill and the successor trustee of the R.M. Trust. (Plaintiffs’ Exs. 1, 3). Viewed in\n\na light most favorable to plaintiffs, we conclude that the allegations made in the\n\ncomplaint amount, at best, to allegations of “general influence” made by a\n\ndaughter to her mother and step-father, not “undue influence” as is required.\n\nHenry, 173 Ohio St. at 501.\n\n      {¶28} For all these reasons, plaintiffs’ assignments of error A, H, and G are\n\noverruled.\n\n                         ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR J\n\n      THE COURT ERRED IN UTILIZING TWO PARAGRAPHS\n      OUT OF CONTEXT IN DISMISSING PLAINTIFFS’\n      COMPLAINT.

Trust agreement was made between Reid M. Pittenger, as\n\nGrantor and as Trustee, along with his wife, Doris H. Pittenger, as Co-Trustee.\n\n(R.M. Trust, Plaintiff’s Ex. 1). Upon Reid’s death, the trust estate was to be\n\ndivided into two trusts: Trust Number 1 (Marital Trust) and Trust Number 2\n\n(Child/Children’s Trust). (R.M. Trust, Article II, Plaintiffs’ Ex. 1). With regard to\n\nthe Marital Trust, Doris, as trustee, was directed to “pay the net income of Trust\n\nNumber 1 to or for the benefit of [Doris] annually, or more frequently if [Doris]\n\ndirects.” (R.M. Trust, Article II, Section 8(a), Plaintiff’s Ex. 1) (emphasis added).\n\n\n\n                                       - 18 -\n\fCase No. 3-09-15\n\n\nArticle II, Section 8(b) provided that “[Trustee Doris] may pay to or for the benefit\n\nof [Doris] from time to time such amounts of the principal of Trust Number 1 as\n\n[Trustee Doris] in [her] discretion may determine to be necessary or desirable for\n\nthe health, education, support, maintenance, comfort, and happiness of [Doris].”\n\n(Plaintiff’s Ex. 1) (emphasis added).\n\n       {¶35} With regard to Trust Number 2, the trust agreement provided:\n\n       (a) [Trustee Doris] may in [her] sole discretion pay to or for the\n       benefit of [Doris] and the Grantor’s children and their issue so\n       much of the net income principal of Trust Number 2 as is\n       necessary for the health, education, support, and maintenance of\n       [Doris] * * * The welfare of [Doris] is Grantor’s primary concern,\n       and [Trustee Doris] shall be liberal in making payments of income\n       and principal to or for the benefit of [Doris].

However, [Trustee Doris] shall not be required to follow\n       the recommendation of [Doris] concerning distribution of\n       income or principal from Trust Number 2.\n\n       (b) Upon the death of [Doris], trustee shall transfer the\n       principal of Trust Number 2 and all accumulations thereof by\n       proper instruments of conveyance to and among the children of\n       Grantor and their issue in such proportions and legal or\n       equitable interest as [Doris] shall appoint by specific reference to\n       this limited power of appointment in [Doris’] Last Will and\n       Testament. The purpose of this power of appointment is to\n       enable [Doris] to respond to changes in circumstance of\n       Grantor’s children and their issue which may occur subsequent\n       to Grantor’s death by adjusting the disposition of the assets of\n       Trust Number 2 at [Doris’] death.\n\n\n                                        - 19 -\n\fCase No. 3-09-15\n\n\n\n(R.M.

Article V, Section 11 provided that the “[Trustee Doris] shall\n\nincur no liability for the reasonable and prudent exercise of or failure to exercise\n\nany and all duties, powers, and discretions enumerated in this agreement or\n\nconferred upon [Trustee Doris] by any provision of law.” (Plaintiff’s Ex. 1).\n\n       {¶37} The Reid M. Pittenger and Doris H. Pittenger Joint Revocable Trust\n\n(“Joint Trust”) was entered into between Reid and Doris as Grantors and co-\n\ntrustees. (Plaintiffs’ Ex. 2). During Reid and Doris’ lives, the trustee (Doris or\n\nReid) was required to pay to Doris and Reid or apply for their benefit “all of the\n\nnet income of the trust, and such amounts or all of the principal as [they] may\n\nrequest in writing from time to time[.]” (Joint Trust, Section 3, Plaintiffs’ Ex. 2).\n\nUpon the death of one of the grantor-spouses, the trust property was to be divided\n\ninto two trusts: Trust A (the marital trust) and Trust B (the family trust). (Id. at\n\nSection 5, Plaintiffs’ Ex. 2). With regard to Trust A, the trustee (Doris since she\n\nsurvived Reid) was instructed to “pay to [Doris], on an annual basis and no less\n\nfrequently than quarterly, all of the net income of trust A beginning as of the date\n\nof death of the first grantor-spouse’s death.” (Id. at Section 6(a)(i), Plaintiffs’ Ex.\n\n\n                                         - 20 -\n\fCase No. 3-09-15\n\n\n2). Doris, as trustee, was also instructed to “pay to [Doris] so much, none, or all\n\nof the principal of Trust A as [Trustee Doris], in [her] absolute discretion, shall\n\ndeem necessary or advisable to provide liberally for [Doris’] health, maintenance\n\nand support in reasonable comfort.” (Id. at Section 6(a)(ii), Plaintiffs’ Ex. 2)\n\n(emphasis added). Trustee Doris was further instructed to “pay to [Doris], * * *\n\nan amount equal to the greater of Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000) or five percent\n\n(5%) of the value of the principal of Trust A on the last day of each calendar year\n\nas [Doris] may in writing request in each calendar year.” (Id. at Section 6(a)(iii),\n\nPlaintiffs’ Ex. 2). Section 6(b) gave Doris the power to appoint the remaining\n\nportion of the principal of Trust A “to such one or more persons or organizations\n\nor [Doris’] estate, in such amounts, proportions, interests, or estates, and upon\n\nsuch trusts, terms, powers, and conditions, if any, as [Doris], alone and in all\n\nevents, may appoint by [her] valid Will[.]” (Plaintiffs’ Ex. 2) (emphasis added).\n\n       {¶38} With respect to Trust B, the family trust, Trustee Doris was directed\n\nto:\n\n       * * * distribute or accumulate, in [Trustee Doris’] sole discretion,\n       such portions of the income of this trust to, or for the benefit of,\n       [Doris] and children, in equal or unequal shares as [Trustee\n       Doris] deems advisable for their respective health, support,\n       maintenance and education, giving due regard to the respective\n       needs of each beneficiary, to the amount of income available to\n       them from other sources * * * and to their respective federal\n       income tax brackets.\n\n\n\n\n                                       - 21 -\n\fCase No. 3-09-15\n\n\n(Joint Trust, Section 7(a)(i), Plaintiffs’ Ex. 2) (emphasis added). The Joint Trust\n\nfurther provided that:\n\n       [Trustee Doris] shall also pay to [Doris] and to each living child\n       of ours so much, none or all of the principal of Trust B as\n       [Trustee Doris], in [her] absolute discretion, shall deem necessary\n       or advisable to provide liberally for the health, maintenance,\n       support in reasonable comfort, and education of [Doris] and\n       children, bearing in mind that our primary concern is for the care\n       and well-being of [Doris].\n\n(Id. at Section 7(a)(ii), Plaintiffs’ Ex. 2) (emphasis added). The Joint Trust also\n\nprovided that “[Trustee Doris] shall pay to [Doris], beginning with the calendar\n\nyear following the year of the first spouse’s death, an amount equal to the greater\n\nof Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000) or five percent (5%) of the value of the\n\nprincipal as [Doris] may in writing request in each calendar year[.]” (Id. at Section\n\n7(a)(iii), Plaintiffs’ Ex. 2) (emphasis added). Upon Doris’ death, the successor\n\ntrustee was directed to:\n\n       retain and distribute the remaining amount of principal of Trust\n       B (as augmented by additions from Trust A, from [Doris’\n       estate], or otherwise) in the following manner: (A). One-half of\n       the net trust estate to Jane E. Miller and Louise E. Murray in\n       equal shares per stirpes with the exception that if Jane E. Miller\n       predecease us, or die [sic] prior to receiving her full distribution,\n       then her share shall pass to Ann Louise Miller; (B) One-half of\n       the net trust estate to Dolores H. Cass per stirpes.\n\n(Joint Trust, Section 7(b), Plaintiffs’ Ex. 2). The Joint Trust provided the trustee\n\nwith several “rights, powers, duties, and immunities to be exercised without court\n\norder or other authority upon such terms and conditions and at such times as the\n\n\n                                       - 22 -\n\fCase No. 3-09-15\n\n\ntrustee determines in its absolute discretion[.]” (Joint Trust, Section 10(a)-(t),\n\nPlaintiffs’ Ex. 2) (emphasis added).\n\n       {¶39} After reviewing the trust agreements in their entirety, with special\n\nattention to the provisions highlighted above, we cannot conclude that the trial\n\ncourt erred in dismissing Plaintiffs’ constructive trust, conversion, and third-party\n\nclaims. As an initial matter, although generally a court is required to assume the\n\nallegations in the complaint are true for purposes of a Civ.R. 12(B)(6), a court is\n\nnot required to assume those allegations in the complaint are true, which the plain\n\nlanguage of an attached, incorporated document clearly refutes.

See, also, Keenan,\n\n2006-Ohio-3633, at ¶¶11-13 (noting that the plain language of the agreements at\n\nissue contradicted appellants’ assertions and that the written agreement was an\n\ninsuperable bar to recovery). In an effort to limit Trustee Doris’ discretion under\n\nthe terms of the trusts, the plaintiffs alleged that “[s]he was permitted to draw on\n\nthe trust yields for “maintenance” and “reasonable comfort,” and that Doris had no\n\nsuch needs over the seven-year period she was trustee. (First Amended Complaint,\n\nDoc. No. 10, at ¶¶4-5). That is only a partial truth. The R.M. Trust allowed\n\n\n\n                                       - 23 -\n\fCase No. 3-09-15\n\n\nTrustee Doris to pay to herself, as the surviving spouse, income from the marital\n\ntrust annually or more frequently if she directed. (R.M. Trust, Section 8(a),\n\nPlaintiffs’ Ex. 1).    Doris was also permitted to draw from the marital trust\n\nprincipal in her discretion, which was necessary or desirable for her health,\n\neducation, support, maintenance, comfort, and happiness. (Id. at Section 8(b)).\n\nDoris was also given discretion to make payments of principal and income to\n\nherself from the children’s trust after the assets of the marital trust were exhausted.\n\n(Id. at Section 9). Reid also expressly indicated that Doris was his “primary\n\nconcern” and that she should be “liberal in making payments of income and\n\nprincipal to or for the benefit of [herself].” (Id.). Furthermore, the joint trust\n\nexpressly defined the term “maintenance” to account for Doris’ previous manner\n\nof living. (Joint Trust, Section 9(d), Plaintiffs’ Ex. 2). Both definitions of “health”\n\nand “support” also include the terms “but shall not be limited to,” indicating the\n\ngrantor’s intent to provide the trustee with discretion in administering the trust\n\nfunds. (Id. at Sections 9(c), (e), Plaintiffs’ Ex. 2).\n\n       {¶40} The thrust of Plaintiffs’ complaint is that Doris never divided the\n\ntrust assets into marital and family trusts as mandated by the trusts, and that Doris,\n\nas trustee, wrongfully caused funds to be withdrawn from the trusts for the direct\n\nand indirect benefit of her daughter, Dolores Cass. These allegations, even if true,\n\nfail as a matter of law under the express terms of the trust agreements. Under the\n\n\n\n                                          - 24 -\n\fCase No. 3-09-15\n\n\nterms of the the R.M. Trust, Trustee Doris was not required to physically segregate\n\nthe trust assets but could “hold them as an undivided fund for management and\n\ninvestment purposes.” (R.M. Trust, Article II, Section 2, Plaintiffs’ Ex. 1). Under\n\nthe terms of the trusts, Doris was permitted to withdraw money from the trusts for\n\nherself liberally, and the provisions read collectively evidence the grantor’s intent\n\nfor the same. That Doris placed the funds into accounts for which Cass was the\n\nprimary beneficiary is irrelevant. Furthermore, the joint trust agreement allowed\n\nDoris, in her sole or absolute discretion, to give her daughter Cass family trust\n\nfunds for her health, education, support, maintenance, and education. (Joint Trust,\n\nSections (7)(a)(i), (ii), Plaintiffs’ Ex. 2). The joint trust also provided that the\n\ndisbursements from the family trust income could be in unequal shares at Doris’\n\nsole discretion, and that Doris could pay “so much, none, or all of the principal” of\n\nthe family trust as Doris deemed necessary or advisable in her absolute discretion.\n\n(Id.). Under these circumstances, even if the allegations of plaintiffs’ complaint\n\nare assumed to be true, as required, the trust agreements are an insuperable bar to\n\ntheir recovery as Doris had the discretion to remove the trust funds liberally for\n\nher benefit and in unequal shares to the children.\n\n       {¶41} Since Doris’ actions, as alleged in the complaint, were not in\n\nviolation of the trust agreements, Plaintiffs’ fail to allege any commission of\n\nwrong, unconscionable conduct, artifice, concealment, or questionable means, or\n\n\n\n                                       - 25 -\n\fCase No. 3-09-15\n\n\nany act against equity and good conscience by which a court could impose a\n\nconstructive trust upon defendant Cass.

Plaintiffs cite the\n\nfollowing portions of three statutes in support of these assignments of error: R.C.\n\n5808.01, which provides, in pertinent part, “* * * the trustee shall administer the\n\n\n\n                                        - 28 -\n\fCase No. 3-09-15\n\n\ntrust in good faith, in accordance with its terms and purposes and the interests of\n\nthe beneficiaries[.]”; R.C. 5808.02, which provides, in pertinent part:\n\n       (A) A trustee shall administer the trust solely in the interests of\n       the beneficiaries.\n\n       (B) * * * a sale, encumbrance, or other transaction involving\n       the investment or management of trust property entered into by\n       the trustee for the trustee’s own personal account or that is\n       otherwise affected by a conflict between the trustee’s fiduciary\n       and personal interests is voidable by a beneficiary affected by\n       the transaction unless one of the following applies:\n\n       ***\n       (C) A sale, encumbrance, or other transaction involving the\n       investment or management of trust property is presumed to be\n       affected by a conflict between personal and fiduciary interests if\n       it is entered into by the trustee with one of the following:\n\n       ***\n       (2) The trustee’s descendant, sibling, or parent or the spouse of a\n       trustee’s descendant, sibling, or parent;\n\nand R.C. 5808.03, which provides, in pertinent part, “[i]f a trust has two or more\n\nbeneficiaries, the trustee shall act impartially in investing, managing, and\n\ndistributing the trust property, giving due regard to the beneficiaries’ respective\n\ninterests.” (Emphasis added).\n\n       {¶46} When reviewing these statutes, it is important to note that Doris was\n\nboth a trustee and the primary beneficiary under the trust agreements. The grantor\n\nexpressly stated in the R.M. Trust that Doris’ welfare was his “primary concern”\n\nand that Doris, as trustee, “shall be liberal in making payments of income and\n\n\n\n                                       - 29 -\n\fCase No. 3-09-15\n\n\nprincipal to or for [her] benefit.” (R.M. Trust, Article II, Section 9(a), Plaintiffs’\n\nEx. 1). Both trusts provided that any of trust assets remaining after Doris’ death\n\nwould be distributed into separate trusts for the children. (Id., at Article III); (Joint\n\nTrust, Section 7(b), Plaintiffs’ Ex. 2). Therefore, the children’s interest in the trust\n\nassets was contingent upon whether or not Doris, as the surviving spouse, used all\n\nof the trust funds prior to her death, which she had the right to do under the terms\n\nof the trust agreements. See Firestone v. Galbreath (1993), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">67</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">87</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 89,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">616</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">202</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Evans, J., concurring in part dissenting in part). After reading the\n\nterms of the trust agreements and the broad discretion afforded to Doris as trustee,\n\nalong with the settlor’s express statement that Doris was his “primary concern,”\n\nwe cannot conclude that she breached any duty, statutory or otherwise, owed to\n\nthe plaintiffs; rather, Doris, as trustee, gave due regard to their respective interests\n\nas contingent beneficiaries. R.C. 5808.03. Furthermore, we find R.C. 5808.02\n\ninapplicable here as that section deals with trustee’s self-dealing where the trustee\n\nis not also a beneficiary under the terms of the trust like Doris is here.\n\nFurthermore, even assuming the statute applies, R.C. 5808.02(B)(1) provides an\n\nexception where “[t]he transaction was authorized by the terms of the trust * * *,”\n\nwhich would preclude plaintiffs from prevailing on the allegations of so-called\n\nself-dealing against Doris.\n\n\n\n\n                                         - 30 -\n\fCase No. 3-09-15\n\n\n       {¶47} For all these reasons, plaintiffs’ assignments of error I and K lack\n\nmerit and are hereby overruled.\n\n                          ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR D\n\n       THE COURT ERRED IN DISMISSING                           PLAINTIFFS’\n       REQUEST FOR AN ACCOUNTING.\n\n                          ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR E\n\n       THE COURT ERRED IN DISMISSING PLAINTIFFS’\n       COMPLAINT REQUESTING RECORDS PERTAINING TO\n       THE HANDLING OF THE TRUST.\n\n       {¶48} In assignments of error D, plaintiffs argue that the trial court erred in\n\ndismissing their complaint because they were entitled to an accounting pursuant to\n\nthe terms of the joint trust agreement and R.C. 5808.13. In assignment of error E,\n\nplaintiffs assert that the trial court erred in dismissing its complaint, which alleged\n\nspoliation of records, and the trustee’s failure to keep adequate records. We\n\ndisagree.\n\n       {¶49} As an initial matter, plaintiffs failed to assert any breach of statutory\n\nduties in their multiple filing with the trial court prior to its entry of final\n\njudgment. (Doc. Nos. 1, 8, 10, 14, 18). It was not until after the trial court granted\n\nthe motion to dismiss that plaintiffs asserted any breach of statutory duties.\n\n(Memo. in Support of Motion for Reconsideration, Doc. No. 28).               As such,\n\nplaintiffs have waived their arguments with respect to the trustee’s purported\n\nbreach of its statutory duties.

See, also, PNC Bank, 1st Dist. No.\n\nC-990727, at *3; Stanley, 2nd Dist. No. 17912, at *4; Reagan, 11th Dist. Nos. 95-\n\nP-0123, 95-P-0124, at *3.\n\n       {¶50} Furthermore, plaintiffs’ complaint did not allege a breach of the\n\ntrustee’s duty to provide an accounting to them, as beneficiaries, as they now\n\nallege on appeal. At best, the complaint alleges that “[d]efendants had a duty to\n\nkeep an accurate accounting of all assets,” not a duty to provide plaintiffs with an\n\naccounting as they now argue. (First Amended Complaint, Doc. No. 10, at ¶12).\n\nPlaintiffs sought an accounting as a form of equitable relief to account for the trust\n\nassets in the prayer of their complaint. (Id., at Prayer for Relief). Plaintiffs did not\n\nassert a separate breach of duty for the trustee’s alleged failure to provide them\n\nwith an accounting as they now assert on appeal. (See id.). Therefore, plaintiffs’\n\nassignment of error D lacks merit.\n\n       {¶51} Next plaintiffs allege the trial court erred in dismissing their\n\ncomplaint for spoliation of records. The elements of spoliation are: “(1) pending\n\nor probable litigation involving the plaintiff, (2) knowledge on the part of\n\ndefendant that litigation exists or is probable, (3) willful destruction of evidence\n\nby defendant designed to disrupt the plaintiff’s case, (4) disruption of the\n\n\n\n                                         - 32 -\n\fCase No. 3-09-15\n\n\nplaintiff’s case, and (5) damages proximately caused by the defendant’s acts.”\n\nSmith v.

Plaintiffs failed to allege any facts which would state a cause of action for\n\nspoliation. Plaintiffs alleged that Doris and Cass “intentionally failed to maintain\n\nrecords as to the opening balances of each trust,” not that they willfully destroyed\n\nrecords in anticipation of litigation to disrupt plaintiffs’ case against them.\n\n(Amended complaint, Doc. No. 10, at ¶12). As such, the trial court did not err in\n\ndismissing plaintiffs’ complaint on this basis.\n\n       {¶52} Plaintiffs’ assignments of error D and E are, therefore, overruled.\n\n       {¶53} Having found no error prejudicial to the appellant herein in the\n\nparticulars assigned and argued, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\n                                                               Judgment Affirmed\n\nROGERS and SHAW, J.J., concur.\n\n/jlr\n\n\n\n\n                                        - 33 -\n\f</pre>",
