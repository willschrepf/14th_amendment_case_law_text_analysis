In a pro se statement of additional grounds, he raises challenges\n\nto the convictions and the enhancements. We find no error or abuse of discretion and\n\naffirm.\n\n                      FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n          In March 2015, Trevor Powers was employed as a caretaker at the Canon De Sol\n\nWinery. On the evening of March 15, 2015, he and his roommate Brent Parrish were\n\ndriving back to the winery after a several hour absence when they saw a black pickup\n\ntruck parked on the property with its headlights off. Mr. Parrish, who was driving, pulled\n\nin front of the truck, shining his headlights into the cab. Mr. Powers took a handgun out\n\fNo. 34006-6-III\nState v. Powers\n\n\nof his backpack, loaded it, stuck it in his belt, got out of the car and approached the truck\n\nwith the reported intention of speaking with its occupants.\n\n       The parked truck belonged to 21-year-old Matthew Mahan, who had driven to the\n\nwinery with his girlfriend, 19- or 20-year-old Alyssa Aitoro, to park and talk about\n\nproblems they were having in their relationship. With the problems apparently resolved,\n\nthey had moved into the back seat. When they saw Mr. Parrish's car turning into the\n\nwinery property, they resumed their seats in the front.\n\n       When the car stopped in front of them, almost blocking them, Mr. Mahan turned\n\non his headlights. As Mr. Powers approached them, he had one hand in the air and the\n\nother behind his back, apparently reaching for his waistband. Fearing he had a gun, Mr.\n\nMahan floored his gas pedal and made a hard right tum to get around the car. As he did,\n\nMr. Powers began to fire at the pickup truck. Mr. Mahan put his arm around Ms.\n\nAitoro's back and pushed her down as he continued to drive away. Eleven bullet holes\n\nwere later found in the truck, starting at the driver's side door, continuing down the\n\ndriver's side of the pickup, and finishing in the back of the truck. When the couple\n\narrived at Ms. Aitoro's home, her father called police.\n\n       Mr. Powers was interviewed late that evening and again two days later by Benton\n\nCounty Sheriffs Detective Justin Gerry. On March 20, five days after the incident, he\n\nwas charged with two counts of second degree assault, each with a firearm enhancement.\n\nThe charges were later amended to include one count of first degree malicious mischief.\n\n                                              2\n\fNo. 34006-6-III\nState v. Powers\n\n\n       Mr. Powers's first court-appointed lawyer was Sylvia Comish and trial was\n\ninitially set for May 11, 2015. During her representation, Ms. Comish arranged for a\n\nforensic psychological assessment of Mr. Powers by Philip Barnard, a clinical\n\npsychologist. Dr. Barnard sent an eight page report to Ms. Comish on April 29, 2015, in\n\nwhich he expressed opinions that Mr. Powers was mentally competent and normal or\n\naverage in many respects, but concluded with an opinion that at the time of the alleged\n\nassaults, \"several contributing elements\" resulted in \"significantly impaired\" reasoning,\n\njudgment, and impulse control that Dr. Barnard characterized as resulting in \"diminished\n\ncapacity.\" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 96.\n\n       Mr. Powers signed three waivers of his speedy trial right in May, July, and August\n\n2015, the third of which was to allow John Chambers, who substituted as counsel for Ms.\n\nComish in July, to be ready for trial. Trial ultimately began on December 7, 2015.\n\n       Mr. Powers did not testify at trial but his two recorded police interviews were\n\nentered into evidence. Mr. Parrish testified for the defense. Mr. Powers' s defense at\n\ntrial, consistent with his statements to Detective Gerry, was that he reasonably unloaded\n\nhis handgun in self-defense after Mr. Mahan floored his gas pedal and the pickup came\n\n\"flying at him, full throttle, engine revving, rocks flying everywhere.\" Report of\n\nProceedings (RP) at 207. 1\n\n\n       1\n        All references to the report of proceedings are to the volume that begins with Mr.\nPowers' s arraignment on March 23, 2015, and includes the trial proceedings.\n\n                                             3\n\fNo. 34006-6-111\nState v. Powers\n\n\n       The jury was unpersuaded by the defense and found Mr. Powers guilty on all\n\ncounts, returning special verdicts finding that he had been armed with a firearm in\n\ncommitting the assaults. At sentencing, defense counsel Chambers asked the court to\n\nimpose an exceptional downward sentence, explaining that he had supplied the State with\n\na copy of Dr. Barnard's forensic evaluation, which would support RCW\n\n9.94A.535(l)(c)'s mitigating circumstance of having \"commited the crime under duress,\n\nthreat, or compulsion insufficient to constitute a complete defense, but which\n\nsignificantly affected [the defendant's] conduct.\" RP at 23 7.\n\n       The trial court denied the request for a departure and sentenced Mr. Powers to a\n\ntotal 85 months' confinement. It imposed costs in the total amount of $4,552.50, listing\n\nseveral that were summarized on a cost bill signed by a deputy court clerk that the court\n\nattached to the judgment and sentence. Mr. Powers did not object. The court also\n\nimposed restitution in the stipulated amount of $8,520.90, consisting of the insurer's\n\n$7,084.56 cost of repairs to Mr. Mahan's pickup, $800 to Mr. Mahan for repair costs not\n\ncovered by insurance, and $636.34 in counseling expenses incurred by Ms. Aitoro.\n\n       Mr. Powers appeals.\n\n                                       ANALYSIS\n\n       The only assignments of error made by Mr. Powers's brief on appeal are to the\n\nsuperior court's allegedly improper delegation to the court clerk of the authority to\n\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\fNo. 34006-6-111\nState v. Powers\n\n\nimpose special costs and to the prosecutor's alleged failure to fulfill its obligation to\n\nexamine and approve the cost bill.\n\n       Mr. Powers points out that by statute, it is only the superior court who may order\n\nthe payment of a legal financial obligation (hereafter sometimes \"LFO\") as part of a\n\nconvicted defendant's sentence, and that the court\n\n       must on either the judgment and sentence or on a subsequent order to pay,\n       designate the total amount of a legal financial obligation and segregate this\n       amount among the separate assessments made for restitution, costs, fines,\n       and other assessments required by law.\n\nRCW 9.94A.760(1) (emphasis added). He adds that costs imposed on a defendant \"shall\n\nbe limited to expenses specially incurred by the state in prosecuting the defendant ....\n\nThey cannot include expenses inherent in providing a constitutionally guaranteed jury\n\ntrial.\" RCW 10.01.160(2).\n\n       He also points out that by statute, it is the duty of the prosecutor to\n\n       [c]arefully tax all cost bills in criminal cases and take care that no useless\n       witness fees are taxed as part of the costs and that the officers authorized to\n       execute process tax no other or greater fees than the fees allowed by law.\n\nRCW 36.27 .020(7).\n\n       In this case, he contends, the trial court said only the following in imposing over\n\n$4,500 in LFOs on Mr. Powers:\n\n              THE COURT: I would impose, then, the restitution as indicated; the\n       $500 crime victim assessment; $100 felony DNA collection fee.\n              Mr. Powers, you were working at the time of this the incident. Is\n       there any reason that you are not capable of working?\n\n                                              5\n\fNo. 34006-6-111\nState v. Powers\n\n\n              DEFENDANT POWERS: Not at this time, no, Ma'am.\n              THE COURT: I would impose, then, the court costs, attorney's fees,\n       [and] jury fee.\n              Costs and fees in the sum of $4,552.50; plus the restitution.\n\nRP at 244-45. In addition, Mr. Powers acknowledges that the judgment and sentence\n\nsigned by the court directed payment of the $500 crime victim assessment, $250 jury\n\ndemand fee, $700 in attorney fees, and the $200 filing fee. Br. of Appellant at 5.\n\n       Mr. Powers's concern is with an additional ''special cost reimbursement\" of\n\n$2,742.50 that the superior court included in its total, derived from the cost bill signed by\n\ndeputy court clerk Amy Hauer. CP at 107. He concedes the cost bill includes notations\n\nof two amounts that add up to the $2,742.50-\"DR $2,000\" and \"INV $742.50\"-but\n\ncomplains that these are unidentified and \"[t]here is no way to determine from the record\n\nwhether or not the special cost reimbursement falls within the prohibitions of RCW\n\n10.01.160(2).\" Br. of Appellant at 7.\n\n       Neither party has briefed the issue of whether these assignments of error may be\n\nraised for the first time on appeal. See RAP 2.5(a). In State v. Diaz-Farias, 191 Wn.\n\nApp. 512,520,362 P.3d 322 (2015), we held that an assignment of error to costs that a\n\ndefendant contends are not authorized by statute under any circumstances is one that can\n\nbe raised for the first time on appeal. Lacking briefing from the parties, we will assume\n\nwithout deciding that Mr. Powers's argument that the superior court improperly delegated\n\n\n\n\n                                              6\n\fNo. 34006-6-111\nState v. Powers\n\n\nauthority to the court clerk falls within this category. We deem waived his argument that\n\nthe prosecutor failed in this case to carefully review and tax costs.\n\n       In responding to the challenge to the special cost reimbursement, the State points\n\nto documents in the record that explain the \"DR $2,000\" and \"INV $742.50\" notations on\n\nthe cost bill. CP at 107. The first is a $2,000 bill for Dr. Barnard's (hence, \"DR\") expert\n\nservices for the defense. CP at 117. The second is a $742.50 bill for a defense\n\ninvestigator (hence, \"INV\"). CP at 118. Mr. Powers accepts these as supporting\n\ndocuments, but argues by reply that a defendant, through court-appointed counsel, has a\n\nright to such services that is guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the United States\n\nConstitution, the Washington State Constitution, Const. art. 1, § 22, and CrR 3 .1 ( f)( 1),\n\nciting State v. Punsalan, 156 Wn.2d 875, 878, 133 P.3d 934 (2006). He contends that the\n\nservices of Dr. Barnard and the investigator were necessary for him to present a defense\n\nand are thereby \"expenses inherent in providing a constitutionally guaranteed jury trial\"\n\nthat RCW 10.01.160(2) forbids a court to impose on a defendant.\n\n       We find no improper delegation of authority by the trial court. It was the court,\n\nnot the clerk, that imposed the special cost reimbursement, by including it in the\n\n$4,552.50 total costs imposed in the judgment and sentence. We also find an adequate\n\nsegregation of the costs by the court, where the judgment and sentence incorporated the\n\nattached cost bill by reference. The statutes relied on by Mr. Powers do not require any\n\nparticular form of segregation, and the incorporation of a cost bill prepared by a court\n\n                                               7\n\fNo. 34006-6-III\nState v. Powers\n\n\nclerk is an adequate procedure for informing the defendant of each assessment taxed and\n\nfor purposes of appeal. Any lack of clarity in listing costs as \"DR\" and \"INV\" was a\n\nproblem that should have been raised in the trial court and has now been remedied by the\n\nState's response.\n\n       Defense expert and investigator expenses are not '·expenses inherent in providing\n\na constitutionally guaranteed jury trial\" within the meaning ofRCW 10.01.160(2). In\n\nDiaz-Farias, this court concluded that when the legislature used the phrase \"expenses\n\ninherent in providing a constitutionally guaranteed jury trial\" in that statute, it \"' intended\n\nto encompass only expenses relating to a defendant's jury trial itself, not expenses\n\nassociated with other constitutional rights that apply at the time of trial.'\" 191 Wn. App.\n\nat 523 (quoting State v. Ferman-Velasco, 333 Or. 422, 41 P.3d 404 (2002)). Fees related\n\nto experts are an expense specially incurred by the State in prosecuting a defendant. See\n\nUtter v. Dep't of Soc. & Health Servs., 140 Wn. App. 293,311, 165 P.3d 399 (2007)\n\n(costs relating to a competency evaluation); State v. Baggett, 103 Wn. App. 564, 13 P.3d\n\n659 (2000), review denied, 143 Wn.2d 1011, 21 P.3d 291 (2000) (expert witness costs).\n\n       We find no error.\n\n                      STATEMENT OF ADDITIONAL GROUNDS\n\n       In a prose statement of additional grounds (SAG), Mr. Powers raises four. While\n\nhis second ground claims ineffective assistance of counsel, which can be raised for the\n\n\n\n\n                                               8\n\fNo. 34006-6-111\nState v. Powers\n\n\nfirst time on appeal, his first, third, and fourth are all issues that implicate RAP 2.5(a),\n\nunder which issues are waived if not raised in the trial court.\n\n       \"RAP 2.5(a) states the general rule for appellate disposition of issues not raised in\n\nthe trial court: appellate courts will not entertain them.\" State v. Guzman Nunez, 160 Wn.\n\nApp. 150, 157, 248 P.3d 103 (2011), aff'd and remanded sub nom. State v. Nunez, 174\n\nWn.2d 707,285 P.3d 21 (2012) (citing State v. Scott, 110 Wn.2d 682,685, 757 P.2d 492\n\n(1988) ). The rationale for refusing to review an issue raised for the first time on appeal is\n\nwell settled-issue preservation helps promote judicial economy by ensuring \"that the\n\ntrial court has the opportunity to correct any errors, thereby avoiding unnecessary\n\nappeals.\" State v. Robinson, 171 Wn.2d 292, 304-05, 253 P.3d 84 (2011) (citing Scott,\n\n110 Wn.2d at 685).\n\n       We first address the three grounds that implicate RAP 2.5(a) and then tum to Mr.\n\nPowers' s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\n       SAG No. 1. Mr. Powers's first ground for relief is an alleged violation of his right\n\nto a speedy trial, based on a Hobson's choice he claims was presented by his last waiver\n\nof that right, in late July 2015, when he wanted the opportunity to work with his new\n\nlawyer, Mr. Chambers. With respect to this ground, Mr. Powers not only implicitly\n\nwaived error by failing to raise it in the trial court, he signed explicit waivers. And under\n\nCrR 3.3(d)(3), by failing to file a motion objecting to his continued trial date within 10\n\n\n\n\n                                               9\n\fNo. 34006-6-III\nState v. Powers\n\n\ndays after notice, Mr. Powers lost his right to object that a trial did not take place within\n\nthe time limits prescribed by the rule.\n\n       State v. Michielli, 132 Wn.2d 229,937 P.2d 587 (1997), on which Mr. Powers\n\nrelies, was not decided on speedy trial grounds. Instead, late-filed charges were\n\ndismissed in that case after the defendant successfully raised an issue of prosecutorial\n\nmismanagement.\n\n       SAG No. 3. Mr. Powers's third ground for relief boils down to a claim of\n\ninstructional error. Because Mr. Powers was charged with assault in the second degree\n\nunder RCW 9A.36.02l(l)(c), the trial court instructed the jury on the required element\n\nthat the assaults were with a deadly weapon. It also defined \"firearm,\" and instructed the\n\njury that a firearm is a deadly weapon. The special verdict forms completed by the jury\n\nstated that Mr. Powers \"[w]as ... armed with a firearm at the time of the commission of'\n\nthe crimes of assault. CP at 84, 86.\n\n       The only flaw in the jury instructions that Mr. Powers identifies-and identifies\n\ntoo late-is that the jury instructions on the state's burden in obtaining the special\n\nverdicts stated that it must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was\n\n\"armed with a deadly weapon.\" CP at 81, 82. This was based on the State's proposed\n\ninstructions, which included Washington Pattern Jury Instruction: Criminal (WPIC)\n\n2.07 .02, when it should have proposed WPIC 2.10.01 instead. See CP at 53, 26. The\n\ndefense made no objection to these instructions at the instruction conference.\n\n                                              10\n\fNo. 34006-6-111\nState v. Powers\n\n\n       As pointed out in Scott, the general rule that we do not entertain issues not raised\n\nin the trial court has specific applicability with respect to claimed errors in jury\n\ninstructions in criminal cases through CrR 6.15( c), requiring that timely and well stated\n\nobjections be made to instructions given or refused \"' in order that the trial court may\n\nhave the opportunity to correct any error.\"' 110 Wn.2d at 686 (quoting City of Seattle v.\n\nRainwater, 86 Wn.2d 567, 571, 546 P.2d 450 (1976) overruled on other grounds by State\n\nv. Blair, 117 Wn.2d 479, 816 P.2d 718 (1991)). Mr. Powers does not suggest an\n\nexception to RAP 2.5(a) that allows him to challenge the instructions for the first time on\n\nappeal. 2\n\n       SAG No. 4. Mr. Powers's fourth ground for relief is that the trial court erred in not\n\ninquiring whether he had a current or future ability to pay LFOs. RCW 10.01.160(3)\n\nprovides that \"the court shall not order a defendant to pay costs unless the defendant is or\n\nwill be able to pay them. In determining the amount and method of payment of costs, the\n\n\n       2 Mr. Powers also mentions State v. Williams-Walker, 167 Wn.2d 889, 896, 225\nP.3d 913 (2010) in connection with SAG No. 3, but no Blakely problem (Blakely v.\nWashington, 542 U.S. 296, 124 S. Ct. 2531, 159 L. Ed. 2d 403 (2004)) is presented.\nWilliams-Walker actually undercuts any argument Mr. Powers might try to make,\nbecause it holds that sentence enhancements \"must be authorized by the jury in the form\nof a special verdict\" and \"the sentencing judge can know which (if any) enhancement\napplies only by looking to the jury's special findings.\" Id. at 900-02. The court held in\nWilliams-Walker that the court could not look to the jury's general verdict to infer and\nresolve ambiguity in the answer to the special verdict. Here, the instructions could have\nbeen more consistent, but the jury's special verdict answer that Mr. Powers was armed\nwith a firearm was clear. It would be wrong under Williams-Walker to look to the jury\ninstructions to infer ambiguity in that answer.\n\n                                              11\n\fNo. 34006-6-III\nState v. Powers\n\n\ncourt shall take account of the financial resources of the defendant.\" In State v. Blazina,\n\n182 Wn.2d 827,834,344 P.3d 680 (2015), our Supreme Court concluded that the\n\nlegislature intended through the statute for \"each judge to conduct a case-by-case analysis\n\nand arrive at an LFO order appropriate to the individual defendant's circumstances,\"\n\nrequiring an individualized inquiry on the record. Id. at 834, 838. A Blazina inquiry is\n\nrequired only for discretionary LFOs. State v. Clark, 191 Wn. App. 369,373,362 P.3d\n\n309 (2015).\n\n      Because Mr. Powers failed to object, we could decline to review this issue.\n\nBlazina, 182 Wn.2d at 834. A majority of the panel favors exercising our discretion to at\n\nleast consider Mr. Powers's argument.\n\n       The trial court imposed $3,752.50 in discretionary LFOs. It was aware from Mr.\n\nPowers's interviews by Detective Gerry that Mr. Powers was 31 years old when\n\ninterviewed and worked as a caretaker at the time of the crimes. Dr. Barnard's report,\n\nprovided by the defense in support of its request for a downward departure from the\n\nstandard range, generally recounted Mr. Powers's work history and stated he was a high\n\nschool graduate with a Bachelor of Arts degree in international business.\n\n      As previously noted, the trial court asked Mr. Powers at sentencing whether there\n\nwas any reason he was not capable of working, to which he responded, \"Not at this time,\n\nno, Ma'am.\" RP at 244. In allocuting at sentencing, Mr. Powers told the court that ifhe\n\nreceived a long sentence, \"[I]t won't do anything but hamper my ability to make\n\n                                             12\n\fNo. 34006-6-111\nState v. Powers\n\n\nrestitution and pay the substantial court costs and fines that I know I'm gonna settle with\n\nand, ultimately, just make amends for what I did.\" RP at 240. Again, he did not object\n\nwhen the trial court announced the costs it would impose.\n\n       Given his education and work background, the fact that Mr. Powers is currently 33\n\nyears old and will be released from prison before age 40, and his statements to the court,\n\nthe trial court's inquiry was sufficient. We will not remand for a further inquiry.\n\n       SAG No. 2. We turn last to Mr. Powers's claim of ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel. He claims his trial lawyer was ineffective by failing to request instruction on,\n\nand advocate for, a diminished capacity defense.\n\n       Effectiye assistance of counsel is guaranteed by both the Sixth Amendment and\n\narticle I, section 22 of the Washington Constitution. U.S. Const. amend. VI; Wash.\n\nConst. art. I, § 22; Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 686, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L.\n\nEd. 2d 674 (1984); State v. Mierz, 127 Wn.2d 460,471, 901 P.2d 286 (1995). To\n\ndemonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must show two things: \"(1)\n\ndefense counsel's representation was deficient, i.e., it fell below an objective standard of\n\nreasonableness based on consideration of all the circumstances; and (2) defense counsel's\n\ndeficient representation prejudiced the defendant, i.e., there is a reasonable probability\n\nthat, except for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have\n\nbeen different.\" State v. McFarland, 127 Wn.2d 322, 334-35, 899 P.2d 1251 (1995)\n\n(citing State v. Thomas, 109 Wn.2d 222, 225-26, 743 P.2d 816 (1987)). When a claim\n\n                                             13\n\fNo. 34006-6-III\nState v. Powers\n\n\ncan be disposed of on one ground, this court need not consider both prongs. Strickland,\n\n466 U.S. at 697.\n\n       Washington courts strongly presume counsel's representation was effective.\n\nMcFarland, 127 Wn.2d at 335. Deficient performance is not shown by matters relating\n\nto trial strategy or tactics. See State v. Sardinia, 42 Wn. App. 533, 542, 713 P.2d 122\n\n(1986).\n\n       To prove diminished capacity, a defendant must show the crime charged includes\n\na particular mental state as an element, present evidence of a mental disorder, and supply\n\n\"expert testimony demonstrating the defendant suffered from a mental condition that\n\nimpaired his ... ability to form the requisite ... intent.\" State v. Eakins, 127 Wn.2d 490,\n\n502,902 P.2d 1236 (1995); State v. Atsbeha, 142 Wn.2d 904,921, 16 P.3d 626 (2001).\n\n\"' Diminished capacity instructions are to be given whenever there is substantial evidence\n\nof such a condition and such evidence logically and reasonably connects the defendant's\n\nalleged mental condition with the inability to possess the required level of culpability to\n\ncommit the crime charged.\"' State v. Cienfuegos, 144 Wn.2d 222, 227-28, 25 P.3d 1011\n\n(2001) (quoting State v. Griffin, 100 Wn.2d 417, 418-19, 670 P.2d 265 (1983)).\n\n       Failure of defense counsel to present a diminished capacity defense, where the\n\nfacts support it, was held to satisfy both prongs of the Strickland test in Thomas. In that\n\ncase, the theory of defense to a charge of felony flight from a police officer was that\n\nThomas was too intoxicated to have formulated the required mental state of wanton or\n\n                                             14\n\fNo. 34006-6-111\nState v. Powers\n\n\nwillful disregard. 109 Wn.2d at 227. The diminished capacity instruction that her lawyer\n\nfailed to request was entirely consistent with her theory of defense. In the absence of the\n\ninstruction, the State argued to the jury that Thomas's intoxication actually caused the\n\nmental state required for the crime, while the instruction would have supported the\n\ncontrary defense argument that her drunkenness negated it. Id. at 228. The Supreme\n\nCourt concluded that a reasonably competent lawyer would have proposed an instruction\n\nbased on pertinent cases. Id. at 229. Its finding of ineffective assistance was further\n\nsupported by the defense lawyer's failure to ascertain that his expert on the effects of\n\nalcohol would not qualify as an expert, as a result of which the witness was not allowed\n\nto testify as one. Id. Neither failure could be explained as tactical.\n\n       Other cases have found that the failure to request a diminished capacity instruction\n\nis not ineffective assistance where the expert's opinion would not satisfy the standards for\n\nthe diminished capacity defense. State v. Harper, 64 Wn. App. 283, 290, 823 P.2d 1137\n\n( 1992). It is not ineffective assistance where it is evidently tactical, with nothing to\n\nsuggest the lawyers were not aware of the defense and where they instead pursued a\n\ndefense more consistent with their client's statements about the incident. In re Pers.\n\nRestraint of Woods, 154 Wn.2d 400,421, 114 P.3d 607 (2005), overruled on other\n\ngrounds by Carey v. Musladin, 549 U.S. 70, 127 S. Ct. 649, 166 L. Ed. 2d 482 (2006).\n\n       Here, our presumption that counsel's decision was tactical finds much support in\n\nthe record. While the penultimate paragraph of Dr. Barnard's report speaks-of\n\n                                              15\n\fNo. 34006-6-III\nState v. Powers\n\n\n\"diminished capacity\" for the alleged incidents, it was entirely based on Mr. Powers's\n\nself-reporting. And the circumstances Dr. Barnard equated with diminished capacity-\n\n\"[Mr. Powers's] reasoning,judgement [sic], and impulse control were significantly\n\nimpaired\"-do not track the requirements for the legal defense. CP at 96. Mr. Powers's\n\nexplanation of his actions to Detective Gerry had been that he was frightened and acted in\n\nself-defense, not that he was impaired by his low blood sugar, clinical depression, or\n\nregular marijuana use noted by Dr. Barnard. Mr. Chambers was clearly aware of Dr.\n\nBarnard's report because he provided it to the court in support of his request for a\n\ndownward departure from the standard sentencing range. He essentially admitted he did\n\nnot believe Dr. Barnard's findings provided a defense to the assault charges when he\n\nadvocated that RCW 9.94A.535(1)(c) applied-telling the court that Mr. Powers's\n\nconduct had significantly been affected by duress, threat, or compulsion \"insufficient to\n\nconstitute a complete defense.\" RP at 236-37. Because deficient performance is not\n\nshown, we need not review prejudice. 3\n\n\n\n       3 Mr. Powers asked that we remand for a RAP 9.11 hearing and direct the trial\ncourt to take additional evidence on the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel, relying\non State v. Jones, 183 Wn.2d 327,352 P.3d 776 (2015). RAP 9.11 authorizes us, in our\ndiscretion, to direct that additional evidence be taken before the decision on review if\n       (1) [A]dditional proof of facts is needed to fairly resolve the issues on\n       review, (2) the additional evidence would probably change the decision\n       being reviewed, (3) it is equitable to excuse a party's failure to present the\n       evidence to the trial court, (4) the remedy available to a party through\n       postjudgment motions in the trial court is inadequate or unnecessarily\n\n                                             16\n\fNo. 34006-6-III\nState v. Powers\n\n\n       Affirmed.\n\n       A majority of the panel has determined this opinion will not be printed in the\n\nWashington Appellate Reports, but it will be filed for public record pursuant to RCW\n\n2.06.040.\n\n\n                                                   d?'dhw~ft·\n                                                 Siddoway, J.\n\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\n\n\nLawrence-Berrey, A.CJ.\n                                    j\n\n\nPennell, J.\n\n\n\n\n       expensive, (5) the appellate court remedy of granting a new trial is\n       inadequate or unnecessarily expensive, and (6) it would be inequitable to\n       decide the case solely on the evidence already taken in the trial court.\nRAP 9 .11.

We find no error or abuse of discretion and\n\naffirm.\n\n                      FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n          In March 2015, Trevor Powers was employed as a caretaker at the Canon De Sol\n\nWinery. On the evening of March 15, 2015, he and his roommate Brent Parrish were\n\ndriving back to the winery after a several hour absence when they saw a black pickup\n\ntruck parked on the property with its headlights off. Mr. Parrish, who was driving, pulled\n\nin front of the truck, shining his headlights into the cab. Mr. Powers took a handgun out\n\fNo. 34006-6-III\nState v. Powers\n\n\nof his backpack, loaded it, stuck it in his belt, got out of the car and approached the truck\n\nwith the reported intention of speaking with its occupants.\n\n       The parked truck belonged to 21-year-old Matthew Mahan, who had driven to the\n\nwinery with his girlfriend, 19- or 20-year-old Alyssa Aitoro, to park and talk about\n\nproblems they were having in their relationship. With the problems apparently resolved,\n\nthey had moved into the back seat. When they saw Mr. Parrish's car turning into the\n\nwinery property, they resumed their seats in the front.\n\n       When the car stopped in front of them, almost blocking them, Mr. Mahan turned\n\non his headlights. As Mr. Powers approached them, he had one hand in the air and the\n\nother behind his back, apparently reaching for his waistband. Fearing he had a gun, Mr.\n\nMahan floored his gas pedal and made a hard right tum to get around the car. As he did,\n\nMr. Powers began to fire at the pickup truck. Mr. Mahan put his arm around Ms.\n\nAitoro's back and pushed her down as he continued to drive away. Eleven bullet holes\n\nwere later found in the truck, starting at the driver's side door, continuing down the\n\ndriver's side of the pickup, and finishing in the back of the truck. When the couple\n\narrived at Ms. Aitoro's home, her father called police.\n\n       Mr. Powers was interviewed late that evening and again two days later by Benton\n\nCounty Sheriffs Detective Justin Gerry. On March 20, five days after the incident, he\n\nwas charged with two counts of second degree assault, each with a firearm enhancement.\n\nThe charges were later amended to include one count of first degree malicious mischief.\n\n                                              2\n\fNo. 34006-6-III\nState v. Powers\n\n\n       Mr. Powers's first court-appointed lawyer was Sylvia Comish and trial was\n\ninitially set for May 11, 2015. During her representation, Ms. Comish arranged for a\n\nforensic psychological assessment of Mr. Powers by Philip Barnard, a clinical\n\npsychologist. Dr. Barnard sent an eight page report to Ms. Comish on April 29, 2015, in\n\nwhich he expressed opinions that Mr. Powers was mentally competent and normal or\n\naverage in many respects, but concluded with an opinion that at the time of the alleged\n\nassaults, \"several contributing elements\" resulted in \"significantly impaired\" reasoning,\n\njudgment, and impulse control that Dr. Barnard characterized as resulting in \"diminished\n\ncapacity.\" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 96.\n\n       Mr. Powers signed three waivers of his speedy trial right in May, July, and August\n\n2015, the third of which was to allow John Chambers, who substituted as counsel for Ms.\n\nComish in July, to be ready for trial. Trial ultimately began on December 7, 2015.\n\n       Mr. Powers did not testify at trial but his two recorded police interviews were\n\nentered into evidence. Mr. Parrish testified for the defense. Mr. Powers' s defense at\n\ntrial, consistent with his statements to Detective Gerry, was that he reasonably unloaded\n\nhis handgun in self-defense after Mr. Mahan floored his gas pedal and the pickup came\n\n\"flying at him, full throttle, engine revving, rocks flying everywhere.\" Report of\n\nProceedings (RP) at 207. 1\n\n\n       1\n        All references to the report of proceedings are to the volume that begins with Mr.\nPowers' s arraignment on March 23, 2015, and includes the trial proceedings.\n\n                                             3\n\fNo. 34006-6-111\nState v. Powers\n\n\n       The jury was unpersuaded by the defense and found Mr. Powers guilty on all\n\ncounts, returning special verdicts finding that he had been armed with a firearm in\n\ncommitting the assaults. At sentencing, defense counsel Chambers asked the court to\n\nimpose an exceptional downward sentence, explaining that he had supplied the State with\n\na copy of Dr. Barnard's forensic evaluation, which would support RCW\n\n9.94A.535(l)(c)'s mitigating circumstance of having \"commited the crime under duress,\n\nthreat, or compulsion insufficient to constitute a complete defense, but which\n\nsignificantly affected [the defendant's] conduct.\" RP at 23 7.\n\n       The trial court denied the request for a departure and sentenced Mr. Powers to a\n\ntotal 85 months' confinement. It imposed costs in the total amount of $4,552.50, listing\n\nseveral that were summarized on a cost bill signed by a deputy court clerk that the court\n\nattached to the judgment and sentence. Mr. Powers did not object. The court also\n\nimposed restitution in the stipulated amount of $8,520.90, consisting of the insurer's\n\n$7,084.56 cost of repairs to Mr. Mahan's pickup, $800 to Mr. Mahan for repair costs not\n\ncovered by insurance, and $636.34 in counseling expenses incurred by Ms. Aitoro.\n\n       Mr. Powers appeals.\n\n                                       ANALYSIS\n\n       The only assignments of error made by Mr. Powers's brief on appeal are to the\n\nsuperior court's allegedly improper delegation to the court clerk of the authority to\n\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\fNo. 34006-6-111\nState v. Powers\n\n\nimpose special costs and to the prosecutor's alleged failure to fulfill its obligation to\n\nexamine and approve the cost bill.\n\n       Mr. Powers points out that by statute, it is only the superior court who may order\n\nthe payment of a legal financial obligation (hereafter sometimes \"LFO\") as part of a\n\nconvicted defendant's sentence, and that the court\n\n       must on either the judgment and sentence or on a subsequent order to pay,\n       designate the total amount of a legal financial obligation and segregate this\n       amount among the separate assessments made for restitution, costs, fines,\n       and other assessments required by law.\n\nRCW 9.94A.760(1) (emphasis added). He adds that costs imposed on a defendant \"shall\n\nbe limited to expenses specially incurred by the state in prosecuting the defendant ....\n\nThey cannot include expenses inherent in providing a constitutionally guaranteed jury\n\ntrial.\" RCW 10.01.160(2).\n\n       He also points out that by statute, it is the duty of the prosecutor to\n\n       [c]arefully tax all cost bills in criminal cases and take care that no useless\n       witness fees are taxed as part of the costs and that the officers authorized to\n       execute process tax no other or greater fees than the fees allowed by law.\n\nRCW 36.27 .020(7).\n\n       In this case, he contends, the trial court said only the following in imposing over\n\n$4,500 in LFOs on Mr. Powers:\n\n              THE COURT: I would impose, then, the restitution as indicated; the\n       $500 crime victim assessment; $100 felony DNA collection fee.\n              Mr. Powers, you were working at the time of this the incident. Is\n       there any reason that you are not capable of working?\n\n                                              5\n\fNo. 34006-6-111\nState v. Powers\n\n\n              DEFENDANT POWERS: Not at this time, no, Ma'am.\n              THE COURT: I would impose, then, the court costs, attorney's fees,\n       [and] jury fee.\n              Costs and fees in the sum of $4,552.50; plus the restitution.\n\nRP at 244-45. In addition, Mr. Powers acknowledges that the judgment and sentence\n\nsigned by the court directed payment of the $500 crime victim assessment, $250 jury\n\ndemand fee, $700 in attorney fees, and the $200 filing fee. Br. of Appellant at 5.\n\n       Mr. Powers's concern is with an additional ''special cost reimbursement\" of\n\n$2,742.50 that the superior court included in its total, derived from the cost bill signed by\n\ndeputy court clerk Amy Hauer. CP at 107. He concedes the cost bill includes notations\n\nof two amounts that add up to the $2,742.50-\"DR $2,000\" and \"INV $742.50\"-but\n\ncomplains that these are unidentified and \"[t]here is no way to determine from the record\n\nwhether or not the special cost reimbursement falls within the prohibitions of RCW\n\n10.01.160(2).\" Br. of Appellant at 7.\n\n       Neither party has briefed the issue of whether these assignments of error may be\n\nraised for the first time on appeal. See RAP 2.5(a). In State v. Diaz-Farias, 191 Wn.\n\nApp. 512,520,362 P.3d 322 (2015), we held that an assignment of error to costs that a\n\ndefendant contends are not authorized by statute under any circumstances is one that can\n\nbe raised for the first time on appeal. Lacking briefing from the parties, we will assume\n\nwithout deciding that Mr. Powers's argument that the superior court improperly delegated\n\n\n\n\n                                              6\n\fNo. 34006-6-111\nState v. Powers\n\n\nauthority to the court clerk falls within this category. We deem waived his argument that\n\nthe prosecutor failed in this case to carefully review and tax costs.\n\n       In responding to the challenge to the special cost reimbursement, the State points\n\nto documents in the record that explain the \"DR $2,000\" and \"INV $742.50\" notations on\n\nthe cost bill. CP at 107. The first is a $2,000 bill for Dr. Barnard's (hence, \"DR\") expert\n\nservices for the defense. CP at 117. The second is a $742.50 bill for a defense\n\ninvestigator (hence, \"INV\"). CP at 118. Mr. Powers accepts these as supporting\n\ndocuments, but argues by reply that a defendant, through court-appointed counsel, has a\n\nright to such services that is guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the United States\n\nConstitution, the Washington State Constitution, Const. art. 1, § 22, and CrR 3 .1 ( f)( 1),\n\nciting State v.

Mr. Powers's first ground for relief is an alleged violation of his right\n\nto a speedy trial, based on a Hobson's choice he claims was presented by his last waiver\n\nof that right, in late July 2015, when he wanted the opportunity to work with his new\n\nlawyer, Mr. Chambers. With respect to this ground, Mr. Powers not only implicitly\n\nwaived error by failing to raise it in the trial court, he signed explicit waivers. And under\n\nCrR 3.3(d)(3), by failing to file a motion objecting to his continued trial date within 10\n\n\n\n\n                                               9\n\fNo. 34006-6-III\nState v. Powers\n\n\ndays after notice, Mr. Powers lost his right to object that a trial did not take place within\n\nthe time limits prescribed by the rule.\n\n       State v. Michielli, 132 Wn.2d 229,937 P.2d 587 (1997), on which Mr. Powers\n\nrelies, was not decided on speedy trial grounds. Instead, late-filed charges were\n\ndismissed in that case after the defendant successfully raised an issue of prosecutorial\n\nmismanagement.\n\n       SAG No. 3. Mr. Powers's third ground for relief boils down to a claim of\n\ninstructional error. Because Mr. Powers was charged with assault in the second degree\n\nunder RCW 9A.36.02l(l)(c), the trial court instructed the jury on the required element\n\nthat the assaults were with a deadly weapon. It also defined \"firearm,\" and instructed the\n\njury that a firearm is a deadly weapon. The special verdict forms completed by the jury\n\nstated that Mr. Powers \"[w]as ... armed with a firearm at the time of the commission of'\n\nthe crimes of assault. CP at 84, 86.\n\n       The only flaw in the jury instructions that Mr. Powers identifies-and identifies\n\ntoo late-is that the jury instructions on the state's burden in obtaining the special\n\nverdicts stated that it must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was\n\n\"armed with a deadly weapon.\" CP at 81, 82. This was based on the State's proposed\n\ninstructions, which included Washington Pattern Jury Instruction: Criminal (WPIC)\n\n2.07 .02, when it should have proposed WPIC 2.10.01 instead. See CP at 53, 26. The\n\ndefense made no objection to these instructions at the instruction conference.\n\n                                              10\n\fNo. 34006-6-111\nState v. Powers\n\n\n       As pointed out in Scott, the general rule that we do not entertain issues not raised\n\nin the trial court has specific applicability with respect to claimed errors in jury\n\ninstructions in criminal cases through CrR 6.15( c), requiring that timely and well stated\n\nobjections be made to instructions given or refused \"' in order that the trial court may\n\nhave the opportunity to correct any error.\"' 110 Wn.2d at 686 (quoting City of Seattle v.\n\nRainwater, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1418629\"><a href=\"/opinion/1418629/seattle-v-rainwater/\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">567</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 571, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1418629\"><a href=\"/opinion/1418629/seattle-v-rainwater/\"><span class=\"volume\">546</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">450</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1976) overruled on other grounds by State\n\nv.

Mr. Powers's fourth ground for relief is that the trial court erred in not\n\ninquiring whether he had a current or future ability to pay LFOs. RCW 10.01.160(3)\n\nprovides that \"the court shall not order a defendant to pay costs unless the defendant is or\n\nwill be able to pay them.

The court held in\nWilliams-Walker that the court could not look to the jury's general verdict to infer and\nresolve ambiguity in the answer to the special verdict. Here, the instructions could have\nbeen more consistent, but the jury's special verdict answer that Mr. Powers was armed\nwith a firearm was clear. It would be wrong under Williams-Walker to look to the jury\ninstructions to infer ambiguity in that answer.\n\n                                              11\n\fNo. 34006-6-III\nState v. Powers\n\n\ncourt shall take account of the financial resources of the defendant.\" In State v. Blazina,\n\n182 Wn.2d 827,834,344 P.3d 680 (2015), our Supreme Court concluded that the\n\nlegislature intended through the statute for \"each judge to conduct a case-by-case analysis\n\nand arrive at an LFO order appropriate to the individual defendant's circumstances,\"\n\nrequiring an individualized inquiry on the record. Id. at 834, 838. A Blazina inquiry is\n\nrequired only for discretionary LFOs. State v. Clark, 191 Wn. App. 369,373,362 P.3d\n\n309 (2015).\n\n      Because Mr. Powers failed to object, we could decline to review this issue.\n\nBlazina, 182 Wn.2d at 834. A majority of the panel favors exercising our discretion to at\n\nleast consider Mr. Powers's argument.\n\n       The trial court imposed $3,752.50 in discretionary LFOs. It was aware from Mr.\n\nPowers's interviews by Detective Gerry that Mr. Powers was 31 years old when\n\ninterviewed and worked as a caretaker at the time of the crimes. Dr. Barnard's report,\n\nprovided by the defense in support of its request for a downward departure from the\n\nstandard range, generally recounted Mr. Powers's work history and stated he was a high\n\nschool graduate with a Bachelor of Arts degree in international business.\n\n      As previously noted, the trial court asked Mr. Powers at sentencing whether there\n\nwas any reason he was not capable of working, to which he responded, \"Not at this time,\n\nno, Ma'am.\" RP at 244. In allocuting at sentencing, Mr. Powers told the court that ifhe\n\nreceived a long sentence, \"[I]t won't do anything but hamper my ability to make\n\n                                             12\n\fNo. 34006-6-111\nState v. Powers\n\n\nrestitution and pay the substantial court costs and fines that I know I'm gonna settle with\n\nand, ultimately, just make amends for what I did.\" RP at 240. Again, he did not object\n\nwhen the trial court announced the costs it would impose.\n\n       Given his education and work background, the fact that Mr. Powers is currently 33\n\nyears old and will be released from prison before age 40, and his statements to the court,\n\nthe trial court's inquiry was sufficient. We will not remand for a further inquiry.\n\n       SAG No. 2. We turn last to Mr. Powers's claim of ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel. He claims his trial lawyer was ineffective by failing to request instruction on,\n\nand advocate for, a diminished capacity defense.\n\n       Effectiye assistance of counsel is guaranteed by both the Sixth Amendment and\n\narticle I, section 22 of the Washington Constitution.

While the penultimate paragraph of Dr. Barnard's report speaks-of\n\n                                              15\n\fNo. 34006-6-III\nState v. Powers\n\n\n\"diminished capacity\" for the alleged incidents, it was entirely based on Mr. Powers's\n\nself-reporting. And the circumstances Dr. Barnard equated with diminished capacity-\n\n\"[Mr. Powers's] reasoning,judgement [sic], and impulse control were significantly\n\nimpaired\"-do not track the requirements for the legal defense. CP at 96. Mr. Powers's\n\nexplanation of his actions to Detective Gerry had been that he was frightened and acted in\n\nself-defense, not that he was impaired by his low blood sugar, clinical depression, or\n\nregular marijuana use noted by Dr. Barnard. Mr. Chambers was clearly aware of Dr.\n\nBarnard's report because he provided it to the court in support of his request for a\n\ndownward departure from the standard sentencing range. He essentially admitted he did\n\nnot believe Dr. Barnard's findings provided a defense to the assault charges when he\n\nadvocated that RCW 9.94A.535(1)(c) applied-telling the court that Mr. Powers's\n\nconduct had significantly been affected by duress, threat, or compulsion \"insufficient to\n\nconstitute a complete defense.\" RP at 236-37. Because deficient performance is not\n\nshown, we need not review prejudice. 3\n\n\n\n       3 Mr. Powers asked that we remand for a RAP 9.11 hearing and direct the trial\ncourt to take additional evidence on the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel, relying\non State v. Jones, 183 Wn.2d 327,352 P.3d 776 (2015). RAP 9.11 authorizes us, in our\ndiscretion, to direct that additional evidence be taken before the decision on review if\n       (1) [A]dditional proof of facts is needed to fairly resolve the issues on\n       review, (2) the additional evidence would probably change the decision\n       being reviewed, (3) it is equitable to excuse a party's failure to present the\n       evidence to the trial court, (4) the remedy available to a party through\n       postjudgment motions in the trial court is inadequate or unnecessarily\n\n                                             16\n\fNo. 34006-6-III\nState v.
