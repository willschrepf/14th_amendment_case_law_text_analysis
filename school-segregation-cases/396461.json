Conley seeking to condemn various parcels\n\nof land owned by Conley. Conley, proceeding pro se, removed the action to the\n\fMiddle District of Alabama on the grounds that federal subject matter jurisdiction\n\nexisted under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981, 1983, 1985 and 1988 and that the action was\n\nremovable under 28 U.S.C. § 1443. Upon ASU’s motion, the district court\n\nremanded the proceedings to state court. Conley appeals, arguing that removal\n\njurisdiction under § 1443 exists in this case and that the district court erred when it\n\nremanded this action to state court.1 After review, we affirm.\n\n                              I. BACKGROUND FACTS2\n\n       According to Conley’s petition for removal, ASU announced plans in 1995\n\nto seek condemnation of certain properties located in the Bel Aire community\n\nadjacent to its campus as part of its plan to expand its athletic facilities. Over the\n\nnext four years, ASU purchased various parcels of land from elderly or retired\n\n       1\n         In its remand order, the district court found that Conley had removed the lawsuit\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1441, which permits removal of actions raising federal questions. The\ncourt concluded that ASU’s complaint presented no federal questions and that the court,\ntherefore, lacked subject matter jurisdiction. Consequently, the court remanded the action\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1447(c). The court did not explicitly address Conley’s asserted grounds\nfor removal under § 1443.\n        An order remanding a civil action to state court for lack of subject matter jurisdiction\npursuant to §§ 1441 and 1447(c) is not reviewable. 28 U.S.C. § 1447(d); Thermtron Prods., Inc.,\nv. Hermansdorfer, 423 U.S. 336, 345-46 (1976), abrogated on other grounds, Quackenbush v.\nAllstate Ins. Co., 517 U.S. 706 (1996). Hence, in a prior order of this Court, we dismissed\nConley’s appeal to the extent it challenges the district court’s remand order based on §§ 1441\nand 1447(c), but allowed Conley’s appeal to proceed to the extent he is challenging the district\ncourt’s implicit determination that removal based on § 1443 was improper. Therefore, the only\nquestion presently before us is whether the district court properly remanded Conley’s action\nbased on a finding that removal jurisdiction under § 1443 did not exist.\n       2\n         The facts are drawn from the allegations in Conley’s removal petition, which we assume\nare true for purposes of this appeal.\n\n                                               2\n\fproperty owners.3 Then, beginning in 1995, the State of Alabama, on behalf of\n\nASU, instituted eminent domain proceedings against three or four owners of larger\n\ntracts of land in the area. Included among these landowners was Conley, who is\n\nblack, and a group of white doctors called collectively the Southeastern Cardiac\n\nBuilding Partners (“Southeastern Cardiac”).\n\n       Conley contends that, of these landowners, he owned the largest piece of\n\nland, with a total square footage of 135,067 feet. Conley’s land contained 22\n\nbuildings housing 43 apartment units. Southeastern Cardiac’s property, on the\n\nother hand, was comprised of 103,442 square feet of vacant land. Southeastern\n\nCardiac had purchased this land, which was located behind its medical building, in\n\n1995 for $1,400,000. The doctors intended to construct a cardiac center and\n\nparking lot on the property.\n\n       According to the removal petition, ASU offered to purchase Southeastern\n\nCardiac’s property for $219,000, but was rejected. Thereafter, ASU instituted\n\n\n       3\n        Conley also contends that, during the aggressive land acquisition between 1995 and\n1998, ASU was able to obtain land from black property owners in Bel Aire at less than fair\nmarket value before instituting eminent domain proceedings. In the process, ASU also caused a\nmassive upheaval of the area’s black residents, who then had difficulty resettling because ASU’s\nbelow-market compensation for the land was inadequate to permit the black property owners to\npurchase real estate elsewhere. As a result of public outcry and local media criticism, ASU\nprodded members of the state legislature, some of whom were employees of ASU, to enact The\nAlabama Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1999, which\nearmarked funds for additional payments of $22,500 for qualified property owners.\n\n\n                                               3\n\fcondemnation proceedings against Southeastern Cardiac and, after extensive pre-\n\ntrial discovery and negotiations, purchased Southeastern Cardiac’s property for\n\n$2,163,500, the value established by Southeastern Cardiac’s expert appraisers.\n\n      In 1999, ASU filed this eminent domain action against Conley in the probate\n\ncourt of Montgomery County, Alabama seeking to condemn Conley’s property\n\nsituated near the ASU campus and adjacent to Southeastern Cardiac’s property.\n\nFollowing a decision by the probate court to award Conley $165,000 for his\n\nproperty, Conley appealed to the Alabama circuit court for a de novo trial and\n\nasserted a counterclaim against ASU alleging that it had violated his civil rights by\n\nengaging in a conspiracy to favor some property owners over others during the\n\nland acquisition process.\n\n      According to Conley, ASU officials conspired with a real estate appraiser to\n\nobtain an appraisal of Conley’s property that artificially deflated its market value in\n\nviolation of state appraisal standards. The appraiser accomplished this by\n\ncomparing Conley’s property, which is a large tract of land comprised of many\n\nlots, to small, individual lots located in areas inhabited only by black property\n\nowners and refusing to compare Conley’s property with the adjacent property\n\npurchased from Southeastern Cardiac.\n\n\n\n\n                                          4\n\f       In his removal petition, Conley alleges that ASU engaged in stonewalling\n\nduring the discovery period in circuit court and that the circuit court judge assigned\n\nto the case, Judge Gene Reese, “stymied his effort to prepare for trial” by, among\n\nother things, failing to schedule hearings or rule upon motions filed by Conley,\n\nimposing “prejudicial restraints on pre-trial discovery,”4 and refusing to permit\n\nevidence of ASU’s purchase price for Southeastern Cardiac property to be\n\nadmitted in determining the value of Conley’s property. Conley contends that the\n\ntrial judge gave ASU preferential treatment during the state court proceedings in\n\ncontemplation of political favors to be gained from the Alabama Democratic\n\nConference, which was led by ASU’s vice president and one of ASU’s trustees.5\n\n       Finally, Conley contends that, before removing the case to federal court, he\n\nsought relief from the Alabama Supreme Court by filing a writ of mandamus,\n\n\n       4\n          Conley contends that Judge Reese granted all of ASU’s requests for protective orders\nduring the seven or eight months of pre-trial discovery. Conley’s discovery requests sought\nappraisers’ depositions taken during pre-trial discovery in ASU’s prior condemnation\nproceedings against Southeastern Cardiac. According to Conley, Judge Reese refused to order\nASU to produce these materials or to take judicial notice of certain facts revealed in the court\nrecord in the Southeastern Cardiac litigation. Conley also alleges that Judge Reese refused to\npermit him to depose certain ASU officials or ASU’s former attorney in charge of the\ncondemnation proceedings. Finally, Conley contends that the trial judge repeatedly postponed\nthe trial date, despite the fact that the case was the oldest case on the judge’s docket and that\nAlabama law requires eminent domain cases to be expedited in advance of other civil actions,\nand that, at the time the removal petition was filed, no specific trial date had been set.\n       5\n         Specifically, Conley alleges that the Alabama Democratic Conference placed pollsters at\nthe entrance to voting stations around Montgomery to hand out marked ballots that urged voters\nto vote for Judge Reese, among others.\n\n                                                 5\n\fwhich was denied. Conley asserts that several members of the Alabama Supreme\n\nCourt were likewise seeking re-election and were desirous of support from the\n\nAlabama Democratic Conference, which “affected the possibility of a corrective\n\nadjudication.”\n\n      In sum, Conley contends that ASU officials, ASU’s real estate appraiser, and\n\nvarious state court judges conspired to take his property for less than fair market\n\nvalue and that this scheme “resulted in reverse race discrimination” and the denial\n\nof his rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. Because of this alleged conspiracy,\n\nConley contends, he cannot enforce his equal rights in the Alabama state courts\n\nand thus removal under 28 U.S.C. § 1443 is warranted.\n\n                                  II. DISCUSSION\n\n      In relevant part, 28 U.S.C. § 1443(1) permits a defendant in a civil state\n\ncourt action to remove the action to federal district court if the action is against a\n\nperson who is denied or cannot enforce in the state courts “a right under any law\n\nproviding for equal civil rights of citizens of the United States.” In Georgia v.\n\nRachel, the United States Supreme Court articulated the two-prong test which a\n\nremoval petition filed pursuant to § 1443(1) must satisfy. First, the petitioner must\n\nshow that the right upon which the petitioner relies arises under a federal law\n\n“providing for specific civil rights stated in terms of racial equality.” Georgia v.\n\n\n                                           6\n\fRachel, 384 U.S. 780, 792 (1966). Second, the petitioner must show that he has\n\nbeen denied or cannot enforce that right in the state courts. Id. at 794. After\n\nreviewing Conley’s removal petition, we conclude that it does not satisfy the\n\nRachel test.\n\n      A. Law Providing for Equal Civil Rights\n\n      Conley alleges that the eminent domain action filed by ASU denied his\n\nrights under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981, 1983 and 1985(3), and under the Equal Protection\n\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Under the first prong of Rachel, we must\n\ndetermine whether any of these asserted rights falls within the scope of § 1443(1).\n\nThe phrase “any law providing for . . . equal civil rights” refers to laws “providing\n\nfor specific civil rights stated in terms of racial equality,” and does not include\n\nrights of “general application available to all persons or citizens.” Rachel, 384\n\nU.S. at 792. Our predecessor circuit, in a case very similar to the one presented by\n\nConley, held that a defendant’s “right to a fair trial and equal protection of the laws\n\nand [his] rights under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 do not arise from legislation providing for\n\nspecific civil rights in terms of racial equality . . . .” See Sunflower County\n\nColored Baptist Ass’n v. Trustees of Indianola Mun. Separate Sch. Dist., 369 F.2d\n\n795, 796 (5th Cir. 1966). Therefore, to the extent Conley relies upon broad\n\n\n\n\n                                           7\n\fassertions under the Equal Protection Clause or § 1983, those rights are insufficient\n\nto support a valid claim for removal under § 1443(1).\n\n      However, in City of Greenwood v. Peacock, decided on the same day as\n\nRachel, the United States Supreme Court recognized that § 1981 qualifies under §\n\n1443(1) as a law providing specific civil rights stated in terms of racial equality.\n\nSee City of Greenwood v. Peacock, 384 U.S. 808, 825 (1966).6 Furthermore,\n\nneither the Supreme Court nor this circuit has addressed whether § 1985(3), the\n\nother federal statute cited by Conley, qualifies as an “equal civil rights” statute.\n\nFor purposes of this appeal, we assume without deciding that § 1985(3) meets\n\nRachel’s definition of an equal civil rights statute under § 1443(1).7 See Davis v.\n\n\n      6\n       42 U.S.C. § 1981 provides:\n\n              All persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the same\n      right in every State and Territory to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties,\n      give evidence, and to the full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the\n      security of all persons and property as is enjoyed by white citizens, and shall be\n      subject to like punishment, pains, penalties, taxes, licenses, and exactions of every\n      kind, and to no other.\n      7\n       42 U.S.C. § 1985(3) states:\n\n              If two or more persons in any State or Territory conspire . . . for the\n      purpose of depriving, either directly or indirectly, any person or class of persons\n      of the equal protection of the laws, or of equal privileges and immunities under\n      the laws; . . . in any case of conspiracy set forth in this section, if one or more\n      persons engaged therein do, or cause to be done, any act in furtherance of the\n      object of such conspiracy, whereby another is injured in his person or property, or\n      deprived of having and exercising a right or privilege of a citizen of the United\n      States, the party so injured or deprived may have an action for the recovery of\n      damages, occasioned by such injury or deprivation, against any one or more of the\n\n                                               8\n\fGlanton, 107 F.3d 1044, 1049-50 (3d Cir. 1997) (declining to address whether §\n\n1985(3) constitutes an “equal civil rights” statute within the meaning of § 1443(1),\n\nbut noting that there are “strong arguments on both sides in terms of\n\njurisprudence”). Nonetheless, we conclude that the district court properly\n\nremanded this action because, for reasons described herein, we find that Conley\n\nhas failed to satisfy the second prong of Rachel.\n\n      B. Right Denied or Unenforceable in State Courts\n\n      Generally, the denial of the petitioner’s equal civil rights must be “manifest\n\nin a formal expression of state law.” Rachel, 384 U.S. at 803. This requirement\n\nensures that removal is available only in cases where the denial of the right can be\n\nclearly predicted and avoids involving federal judges in “the unseemly process of\n\nprejudging their brethren of the state courts.” Id. at 803-04. However, under a\n\nnarrow exception recognized by the Supreme Court in Rachel, even where the\n\naction is premised upon a facially neutral state law, if the very act of bringing the\n\nstate court proceedings will constitute a denial of the rights conferred by the\n\nfederal statute, § 1443(1) removal is proper. Id. at 804-05.\n\n      For example, in Rachel, the state court defendants were prosecuted for\n\ncriminal trespass after they refused to leave a privately-owned restaurant open to\n\n\n      conspirators.\n\n                                           9\n\fthe general public. The defendants were civil rights demonstrators protesting the\n\nrestaurant’s policy of segregating its customers based on race. Although Georgia’s\n\ncriminal trespass statute was facially neutral, the act of prosecuting the defendants\n\nfor criminal trespass directly conflicted with the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which\n\nprecludes such state prosecutions for “peaceful attempts to be served upon an equal\n\nbasis in establishments covered under the Act.” Id. at 785.\n\n      Conley concedes that Alabama’s eminent domain provisions are facially\n\nneutral. He argues that his case falls within the latter category of cases recognized\n\nin Rachel. Conley contends that the filing of the eminent domain action is itself\n\nthe act by which his federal civil rights have been violated. His argument is\n\nforeclosed, however, by Sunflower County Colored Baptist Association v. Trustees\n\nof Indianola Municipal Separate School District, 369 F.2d 795 (5th Cir. 1966), in\n\nwhich our predecessor circuit held that a state’s facially neutral eminent domain\n\nstatutes do not conflict with or deny an eminent domain defendant’s federal rights.\n\n      In Sunflower County, the Trustees of Indianola Municipal Separate School\n\nDistrict brought eminent domain proceedings in Mississippi state court against the\n\nSunflower County Colored Baptist Association, among others, to obtain land to\n\nbuild schools and playgrounds. Sunflower County Colored Baptist Ass’n v.\n\nTrustees of Indianola Mun. Separate Sch. Dist., 369 F.2d 795, 795-96 (5th Cir.\n\n\n                                          10\n\f1966). At the time, the property owned by the Baptist Association was being used\n\nby civil rights organizations to give classes to black children and adults. Id. at 796.\n\nThe Baptist Association filed a removal petition alleging jurisdiction under § 1443\n\nbecause in the condemnation proceedings it would be “denied a fair trial, equal\n\nprotection of the laws and particularly [would] be denied its federal rights arising\n\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1981, 1982 and 1983.” Id. Although the court found that the\n\nBaptist Association had satisfied the first prong of Rachel when it cited § 1981, it\n\nconcluded that it did not meet the second prong. Id. at 796-97.\n\n      In reaching this conclusion, the former Fifth Circuit quoted Peacock, in\n\nwhich the Supreme Court stated that allegations of corruption or unfairness\n\npreceding or during a particular court proceeding do not support removal under §\n\n1443(1), as follows:\n\n              It is not enough to support removal under § 1443(1) to allege or\n      show that the defendant’s federal equal civil rights have been illegally\n      and corruptly denied by state administrative officials in advance of\n      trial, and that the charges against the defendant are false, or that the\n      defendant is unable to obtain a fair trial in a particular state court. The\n      motives of the officers bringing the charges may be corrupt, but that\n      does not show that the state trial court will find the defendant guilty if\n      he is innocent, or that in any other manner the defendant will be\n      “denied or cannot enforce in the courts” of the State any right under a\n      federal law providing for equal civil rights. The civil rights removal\n      statute does not require and does not permit the judges of the federal\n      courts to put their brethren of the state judiciary on trial. Under §\n      1443(1), the vindication of the defendant’s federal rights is left to the\n      state courts except in the rare situations where it can be clearly\n\n                                          11\n\f      predicted by reason of the operation of a pervasive and explicit state\n      of federal law that those rights will inevitably be denied by the very\n      act of bringing the defendant to trial in the state court.\n\nId. at 797 (quoting Peacock, 384 U.S. at 827-28). Noting that “the Association’s\n\nclaim that their federal civil rights will be denied must be based on the state\n\nconstitution, a statute, municipal ordinance, rule of court or regulatory provision\n\nbinding on the court which expressly deny such federal rights,” the court\n\nconcluded that “[n]o Mississippi statute, including the eminent domain statute,\n\nwhich confers on municipal separate school districts the power to acquire property\n\nfor school purposes, or the Mississippi constitutional provision allowing the taking\n\nof property for public use, precisely conflicts and conclusively denies the federal\n\nrights of the Association.” Id. at 797-98 (citations omitted). Finally, again relying\n\nupon Peacock, the court noted that any denial of federal rights that might come to\n\npass as the proceedings progressed could be redressed by direct review of the\n\nfederal claims by the state appellate court and the United States Supreme Court or\n\nin other proceedings designed to remedy claims of unfair proceedings, denial of\n\nequal protection, and rights protected under § 1983. Id. at 798.\n\n      We agree with the reasoning in Sunflower County. ASU’s act of bringing a\n\nproceeding under Alabama’s eminent domain laws does not directly conflict with\n\n\n\n\n                                          12\n\fConley’s rights under §§ 1981 and 1985(3).8 Unlike the Civil Rights Act of 1964\n\nin Rachel, neither § 1981 or § 1985(3) contains specific provisions that immunize\n\nConley from the precise type of proceeding being brought in state court.\n\n          In Rachel, it was only because section 203(c) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\n\nexpressly immunized the defendants from prosecution for trespass when they\n\npeacefully attempted to gain admittance and remain at the restaurant, that “the\n\nmere pendency of the prosecutions enables the federal court to make the clear\n\nprediction that the defendants will be ‘denied or cannot enforce in the courts of\n\n(the) State’ the right to be free of any ‘attempt to punish’ them for protected\n\nactivity.” See Rachel, 384 U.S. at 804-05.9 No similarly explicit prohibition\n\n\n          8\n           Conley does not state precisely which rights under §§ 1981 and 1985(3) he has been\ndenied.\n          9\n         Conley’s reliance upon Sofarelli v. Pinellas County, 931 F.2d 718 (11th Cir. 1991) is\nequally unavailing. In Sofarelli, the removing defendant was attempting to move a house on a\ntrailer over a public road in order to place it on a lot and sell it to a minority purchaser. The\nplaintiffs sought an injunction to prevent the defendant from relocating the house. The\ndefendant’s removal petition alleged that the plaintiffs’ request for an injunction was motivated\nby race and invoked § 3617 of the Fair Housing Act of 1968, which makes it unlawful “to\ncoerce, intimidate, threaten, or interfere with any other person . . . on account of his having aided\nor encouraged any other person in the exercise or enjoyment of any right granted” by the Fair\nHousing Act. See Sofarelli v. Pinellas County, 931 F.2d 718, 720-22 & n.2 (11th Cir. 1991). In\nother words, the Fair Housing Act prohibited prosecution of a criminal or civil action against a\nperson who had encouraged another to exercise their rights under the Fair Housing Act. Id. at\n724-45. Neither § 1985(3) nor § 1981 contains a similar provision that could be read to prohibit\nthe bringing of a civil eminent domain action. Furthermore, the court in Sofarelli did not\nsquarely address this issue as the parties did not dispute that Sofarelli’s allegations fell within the\nholding of Rachel. See id. at 725. Rather the court addressed whether remand was nonetheless\nproper in light of the district court’s conclusion that Sofarelli had failed to state a claim under the\nFair Housing Act. Id.\n\n                                                  13\n\fagainst proceedings brought in retaliation for engaging in a protected activity, and\n\ncertainly no proscription against eminent domain proceedings, can be found in §§\n\n1981 or 1985(3). Therefore, no “equivalent basis [can] be shown for an equally\n\nfirm prediction that the defendant would be ‘denied or cannot enforce’ the\n\nspecified federal rights in the state court.” Id. at 804.\n\n       Furthermore, Conley’s allegation that he cannot get a fair trial in state court\n\nbecause the state trial judge is biased in favor of the defendant for political reasons\n\ndoes not state a cognizable ground for removal under § 1443(1). As the Supreme\n\nCourt has made clear, charges “that the defendant is unable to obtain a fair trial in a\n\nparticular state court” are insufficient to support removal under § 1443(1). See\n\nPeacock, 384 U.S. at 827. The allegedly corrupt or otherwise improper motives of\n\nan individual state court judge do not show that Conley will be unable ultimately to\n\nobtain fair market value for his property in Alabama’s state courts or to raise any\n\ndue process claims he may have in either the state court action or a separate action\n\nin federal court.10\n\n\n       10\n          We note that, as a result of Conley’s allegations of corruption in his removal petition,\nthe state trial judge has recused himself from the case to avoid any appearance of impropriety.\nFurthermore, we agree with ASU that Conley has failed to show that he cannot vindicate his\nrights in Alabama’s appellate courts. The denial of Conley’s petition for a writ of mandamus\ndoes not “operate as a binding decision on the merits.” See R.E. Grills, Inc. v. Davison, 641\nSo.2d 225, 229 (Ala. 1994). Likewise, his request to appeal a discovery order was an\ninterlocutory matter, the denial of which does not have res judicata effect. See Ex Parte Ryals,\n773 So.2d 1011, 1014 (Ala. 2000) (holding that trial court’s interlocutory order was not a final\n\n                                                 14\n\f       In conclusion, Conley’s removal petition fails to satisfy the second prong of\n\nthe Rachel test by demonstrating that the eminent domain proceeding filed in state\n\ncourt is itself an act by which his equal civil rights have been violated. Therefore,\n\nConley’s allegations do not fall within the scope of § 1443(1), and the district\n\ncourt’s order remanding this action to state court was proper.\n\n       AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\njudgment for purposes of res judicata).\n\n                                          15\n\f",

Conley seeking to condemn various parcels\n\nof land owned by Conley. Conley, proceeding pro se, removed the action to the\n\fMiddle District of Alabama on the grounds that federal subject matter jurisdiction\n\nexisted under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981, 1983, 1985 and 1988 and that the action was\n\nremovable under 28 U.S.C. § 1443. Upon ASU’s motion, the district court\n\nremanded the proceedings to state court. Conley appeals, arguing that removal\n\njurisdiction under § 1443 exists in this case and that the district court erred when it\n\nremanded this action to state court.1 After review, we affirm.\n\n                              I. BACKGROUND FACTS2\n\n       According to Conley’s petition for removal, ASU announced plans in 1995\n\nto seek condemnation of certain properties located in the Bel Aire community\n\nadjacent to its campus as part of its plan to expand its athletic facilities. Over the\n\nnext four years, ASU purchased various parcels of land from elderly or retired\n\n       1\n         In its remand order, the district court found that Conley had removed the lawsuit\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1441, which permits removal of actions raising federal questions. The\ncourt concluded that ASU’s complaint presented no federal questions and that the court,\ntherefore, lacked subject matter jurisdiction. Consequently, the court remanded the action\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1447(c). The court did not explicitly address Conley’s asserted grounds\nfor removal under § 1443.\n        An order remanding a civil action to state court for lack of subject matter jurisdiction\npursuant to §§ 1441 and 1447(c) is not reviewable. 28 U.S.C. § 1447(d); Thermtron Prods., Inc.,\nv.

Hence, in a prior order of this Court, we dismissed\nConley’s appeal to the extent it challenges the district court’s remand order based on §§ 1441\nand 1447(c), but allowed Conley’s appeal to proceed to the extent he is challenging the district\ncourt’s implicit determination that removal based on § 1443 was improper. Therefore, the only\nquestion presently before us is whether the district court properly remanded Conley’s action\nbased on a finding that removal jurisdiction under § 1443 did not exist.\n       2\n         The facts are drawn from the allegations in Conley’s removal petition, which we assume\nare true for purposes of this appeal.\n\n                                               2\n\fproperty owners.3 Then, beginning in 1995, the State of Alabama, on behalf of\n\nASU, instituted eminent domain proceedings against three or four owners of larger\n\ntracts of land in the area. Included among these landowners was Conley, who is\n\nblack, and a group of white doctors called collectively the Southeastern Cardiac\n\nBuilding Partners (“Southeastern Cardiac”).\n\n       Conley contends that, of these landowners, he owned the largest piece of\n\nland, with a total square footage of 135,067 feet. Conley’s land contained 22\n\nbuildings housing 43 apartment units. Southeastern Cardiac’s property, on the\n\nother hand, was comprised of 103,442 square feet of vacant land. Southeastern\n\nCardiac had purchased this land, which was located behind its medical building, in\n\n1995 for $1,400,000. The doctors intended to construct a cardiac center and\n\nparking lot on the property.\n\n       According to the removal petition, ASU offered to purchase Southeastern\n\nCardiac’s property for $219,000, but was rejected. Thereafter, ASU instituted\n\n\n       3\n        Conley also contends that, during the aggressive land acquisition between 1995 and\n1998, ASU was able to obtain land from black property owners in Bel Aire at less than fair\nmarket value before instituting eminent domain proceedings. In the process, ASU also caused a\nmassive upheaval of the area’s black residents, who then had difficulty resettling because ASU’s\nbelow-market compensation for the land was inadequate to permit the black property owners to\npurchase real estate elsewhere. As a result of public outcry and local media criticism, ASU\nprodded members of the state legislature, some of whom were employees of ASU, to enact The\nAlabama Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1999, which\nearmarked funds for additional payments of $22,500 for qualified property owners.\n\n\n                                               3\n\fcondemnation proceedings against Southeastern Cardiac and, after extensive pre-\n\ntrial discovery and negotiations, purchased Southeastern Cardiac’s property for\n\n$2,163,500, the value established by Southeastern Cardiac’s expert appraisers.\n\n      In 1999, ASU filed this eminent domain action against Conley in the probate\n\ncourt of Montgomery County, Alabama seeking to condemn Conley’s property\n\nsituated near the ASU campus and adjacent to Southeastern Cardiac’s property.\n\nFollowing a decision by the probate court to award Conley $165,000 for his\n\nproperty, Conley appealed to the Alabama circuit court for a de novo trial and\n\nasserted a counterclaim against ASU alleging that it had violated his civil rights by\n\nengaging in a conspiracy to favor some property owners over others during the\n\nland acquisition process.\n\n      According to Conley, ASU officials conspired with a real estate appraiser to\n\nobtain an appraisal of Conley’s property that artificially deflated its market value in\n\nviolation of state appraisal standards. The appraiser accomplished this by\n\ncomparing Conley’s property, which is a large tract of land comprised of many\n\nlots, to small, individual lots located in areas inhabited only by black property\n\nowners and refusing to compare Conley’s property with the adjacent property\n\npurchased from Southeastern Cardiac.\n\n\n\n\n                                          4\n\f       In his removal petition, Conley alleges that ASU engaged in stonewalling\n\nduring the discovery period in circuit court and that the circuit court judge assigned\n\nto the case, Judge Gene Reese, “stymied his effort to prepare for trial” by, among\n\nother things, failing to schedule hearings or rule upon motions filed by Conley,\n\nimposing “prejudicial restraints on pre-trial discovery,”4 and refusing to permit\n\nevidence of ASU’s purchase price for Southeastern Cardiac property to be\n\nadmitted in determining the value of Conley’s property. Conley contends that the\n\ntrial judge gave ASU preferential treatment during the state court proceedings in\n\ncontemplation of political favors to be gained from the Alabama Democratic\n\nConference, which was led by ASU’s vice president and one of ASU’s trustees.5\n\n       Finally, Conley contends that, before removing the case to federal court, he\n\nsought relief from the Alabama Supreme Court by filing a writ of mandamus,\n\n\n       4\n          Conley contends that Judge Reese granted all of ASU’s requests for protective orders\nduring the seven or eight months of pre-trial discovery. Conley’s discovery requests sought\nappraisers’ depositions taken during pre-trial discovery in ASU’s prior condemnation\nproceedings against Southeastern Cardiac. According to Conley, Judge Reese refused to order\nASU to produce these materials or to take judicial notice of certain facts revealed in the court\nrecord in the Southeastern Cardiac litigation. Conley also alleges that Judge Reese refused to\npermit him to depose certain ASU officials or ASU’s former attorney in charge of the\ncondemnation proceedings. Finally, Conley contends that the trial judge repeatedly postponed\nthe trial date, despite the fact that the case was the oldest case on the judge’s docket and that\nAlabama law requires eminent domain cases to be expedited in advance of other civil actions,\nand that, at the time the removal petition was filed, no specific trial date had been set.\n       5\n         Specifically, Conley alleges that the Alabama Democratic Conference placed pollsters at\nthe entrance to voting stations around Montgomery to hand out marked ballots that urged voters\nto vote for Judge Reese, among others.\n\n                                                 5\n\fwhich was denied. Conley asserts that several members of the Alabama Supreme\n\nCourt were likewise seeking re-election and were desirous of support from the\n\nAlabama Democratic Conference, which “affected the possibility of a corrective\n\nadjudication.”\n\n      In sum, Conley contends that ASU officials, ASU’s real estate appraiser, and\n\nvarious state court judges conspired to take his property for less than fair market\n\nvalue and that this scheme “resulted in reverse race discrimination” and the denial\n\nof his rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. Because of this alleged conspiracy,\n\nConley contends, he cannot enforce his equal rights in the Alabama state courts\n\nand thus removal under 28 U.S.C. § 1443 is warranted.\n\n                                  II. DISCUSSION\n\n      In relevant part, 28 U.S.C. § 1443(1) permits a defendant in a civil state\n\ncourt action to remove the action to federal district court if the action is against a\n\nperson who is denied or cannot enforce in the state courts “a right under any law\n\nproviding for equal civil rights of citizens of the United States.” In Georgia v.\n\nRachel, the United States Supreme Court articulated the two-prong test which a\n\nremoval petition filed pursuant to § 1443(1) must satisfy. First, the petitioner must\n\nshow that the right upon which the petitioner relies arises under a federal law\n\n“providing for specific civil rights stated in terms of racial equality.” Georgia v.\n\n\n                                           6\n\fRachel, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107263\"><a href=\"/opinion/107263/georgia-v-rachel/\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">780</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 792 (1966). Second, the petitioner must show that he has\n\nbeen denied or cannot enforce that right in the state courts. Id. at 794. After\n\nreviewing Conley’s removal petition, we conclude that it does not satisfy the\n\nRachel test.\n\n      A. Law Providing for Equal Civil Rights\n\n      Conley alleges that the eminent domain action filed by ASU denied his\n\nrights under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981, 1983 and 1985(3), and under the Equal Protection\n\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Under the first prong of Rachel, we must\n\ndetermine whether any of these asserted rights falls within the scope of § 1443(1).\n\nThe phrase “any law providing for . . . equal civil rights” refers to laws “providing\n\nfor specific civil rights stated in terms of racial equality,” and does not include\n\nrights of “general application available to all persons or citizens.” Rachel, 384\n\nU.S. at 792. Our predecessor circuit, in a case very similar to the one presented by\n\nConley, held that a defendant’s “right to a fair trial and equal protection of the laws\n\nand [his] rights under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 do not arise from legislation providing for\n\nspecific civil rights in terms of racial equality . . . .” See Sunflower County\n\nColored Baptist Ass’n v. Trustees of Indianola Mun. Separate Sch. Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"273999\"><a href=\"/opinion/273999/sunflower-county-colored-baptist-association-v-trustees-of-indianola/\"><span class=\"volume\">369</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">795</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 796 (5th Cir. 1966). Therefore, to the extent Conley relies upon broad\n\n\n\n\n                                           7\n\fassertions under the Equal Protection Clause or § 1983, those rights are insufficient\n\nto support a valid claim for removal under § 1443(1).\n\n      However, in City of Greenwood v. Peacock, decided on the same day as\n\nRachel, the United States Supreme Court recognized that § 1981 qualifies under §\n\n1443(1) as a law providing specific civil rights stated in terms of racial equality.\n\nSee City of Greenwood v. Peacock, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107264\"><a href=\"/opinion/107264/city-of-greenwood-v-peacock/\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">808</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 825 (1966).6 Furthermore,\n\nneither the Supreme Court nor this circuit has addressed whether § 1985(3), the\n\nother federal statute cited by Conley, qualifies as an “equal civil rights” statute.\n\nFor purposes of this appeal, we assume without deciding that § 1985(3) meets\n\nRachel’s definition of an equal civil rights statute under § 1443(1).7 See Davis v.\n\n\n      6\n       42 U.S.C. § 1981 provides:\n\n              All persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the same\n      right in every State and Territory to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties,\n      give evidence, and to the full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the\n      security of all persons and property as is enjoyed by white citizens, and shall be\n      subject to like punishment, pains, penalties, taxes, licenses, and exactions of every\n      kind, and to no other.\n      7\n       42 U.S.C. § 1985(3) states:\n\n              If two or more persons in any State or Territory conspire . . . for the\n      purpose of depriving, either directly or indirectly, any person or class of persons\n      of the equal protection of the laws, or of equal privileges and immunities under\n      the laws; . . . in any case of conspiracy set forth in this section, if one or more\n      persons engaged therein do, or cause to be done, any act in furtherance of the\n      object of such conspiracy, whereby another is injured in his person or property, or\n      deprived of having and exercising a right or privilege of a citizen of the United\n      States, the party so injured or deprived may have an action for the recovery of\n      damages, occasioned by such injury or deprivation, against any one or more of the\n\n                                               8\n\fGlanton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"736912\"><a href=\"/opinion/736912/kenneth-e-davis-james-s-ettelson-alan-c-kessler-frank-lutz-joseph-m/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1044</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1049-50 (3d Cir. 1997) (declining to address whether §\n\n1985(3) constitutes an “equal civil rights” statute within the meaning of § 1443(1),\n\nbut noting that there are “strong arguments on both sides in terms of\n\njurisprudence”). Nonetheless, we conclude that the district court properly\n\nremanded this action because, for reasons described herein, we find that Conley\n\nhas failed to satisfy the second prong of Rachel.\n\n      B. Right Denied or Unenforceable in State Courts\n\n      Generally, the denial of the petitioner’s equal civil rights must be “manifest\n\nin a formal expression of state law.” Rachel, 384 U.S. at 803. This requirement\n\nensures that removal is available only in cases where the denial of the right can be\n\nclearly predicted and avoids involving federal judges in “the unseemly process of\n\nprejudging their brethren of the state courts.” Id. at 803-04. However, under a\n\nnarrow exception recognized by the Supreme Court in Rachel, even where the\n\naction is premised upon a facially neutral state law, if the very act of bringing the\n\nstate court proceedings will constitute a denial of the rights conferred by the\n\nfederal statute, § 1443(1) removal is proper. Id. at 804-05.\n\n      For example, in Rachel, the state court defendants were prosecuted for\n\ncriminal trespass after they refused to leave a privately-owned restaurant open to\n\n\n      conspirators.\n\n                                           9\n\fthe general public. The defendants were civil rights demonstrators protesting the\n\nrestaurant’s policy of segregating its customers based on race. Although Georgia’s\n\ncriminal trespass statute was facially neutral, the act of prosecuting the defendants\n\nfor criminal trespass directly conflicted with the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which\n\nprecludes such state prosecutions for “peaceful attempts to be served upon an equal\n\nbasis in establishments covered under the Act.” Id. at 785.\n\n      Conley concedes that Alabama’s eminent domain provisions are facially\n\nneutral. He argues that his case falls within the latter category of cases recognized\n\nin Rachel. Conley contends that the filing of the eminent domain action is itself\n\nthe act by which his federal civil rights have been violated. His argument is\n\nforeclosed, however, by Sunflower County Colored Baptist Association v. Trustees\n\nof Indianola Municipal Separate School District, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"273999\"><a href=\"/opinion/273999/sunflower-county-colored-baptist-association-v-trustees-of-indianola/\"><span class=\"volume\">369</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">795</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (5th Cir. 1966), in\n\nwhich our predecessor circuit held that a state’s facially neutral eminent domain\n\nstatutes do not conflict with or deny an eminent domain defendant’s federal rights.\n\n      In Sunflower County, the Trustees of Indianola Municipal Separate School\n\nDistrict brought eminent domain proceedings in Mississippi state court against the\n\nSunflower County Colored Baptist Association, among others, to obtain land to\n\nbuild schools and playgrounds.

Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"273999\"><a href=\"/opinion/273999/sunflower-county-colored-baptist-association-v-trustees-of-indianola/\"><span class=\"volume\">369</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">795</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 795-96 (5th Cir.\n\n\n                                          10\n\f1966). At the time, the property owned by the Baptist Association was being used\n\nby civil rights organizations to give classes to black children and adults. Id. at 796.\n\nThe Baptist Association filed a removal petition alleging jurisdiction under § 1443\n\nbecause in the condemnation proceedings it would be “denied a fair trial, equal\n\nprotection of the laws and particularly [would] be denied its federal rights arising\n\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1981, 1982 and 1983.” Id. Although the court found that the\n\nBaptist Association had satisfied the first prong of Rachel when it cited § 1981, it\n\nconcluded that it did not meet the second prong. Id. at 796-97.\n\n      In reaching this conclusion, the former Fifth Circuit quoted Peacock, in\n\nwhich the Supreme Court stated that allegations of corruption or unfairness\n\npreceding or during a particular court proceeding do not support removal under §\n\n1443(1), as follows:\n\n              It is not enough to support removal under § 1443(1) to allege or\n      show that the defendant’s federal equal civil rights have been illegally\n      and corruptly denied by state administrative officials in advance of\n      trial, and that the charges against the defendant are false, or that the\n      defendant is unable to obtain a fair trial in a particular state court. The\n      motives of the officers bringing the charges may be corrupt, but that\n      does not show that the state trial court will find the defendant guilty if\n      he is innocent, or that in any other manner the defendant will be\n      “denied or cannot enforce in the courts” of the State any right under a\n      federal law providing for equal civil rights. The civil rights removal\n      statute does not require and does not permit the judges of the federal\n      courts to put their brethren of the state judiciary on trial. Under §\n      1443(1), the vindication of the defendant’s federal rights is left to the\n      state courts except in the rare situations where it can be clearly\n\n                                          11\n\f      predicted by reason of the operation of a pervasive and explicit state\n      of federal law that those rights will inevitably be denied by the very\n      act of bringing the defendant to trial in the state court.\n\nId. at 797 (quoting Peacock, 384 U.S. at 827-28). Noting that “the Association’s\n\nclaim that their federal civil rights will be denied must be based on the state\n\nconstitution, a statute, municipal ordinance, rule of court or regulatory provision\n\nbinding on the court which expressly deny such federal rights,” the court\n\nconcluded that “[n]o Mississippi statute, including the eminent domain statute,\n\nwhich confers on municipal separate school districts the power to acquire property\n\nfor school purposes, or the Mississippi constitutional provision allowing the taking\n\nof property for public use, precisely conflicts and conclusively denies the federal\n\nrights of the Association.” Id. at 797-98 (citations omitted). Finally, again relying\n\nupon Peacock, the court noted that any denial of federal rights that might come to\n\npass as the proceedings progressed could be redressed by direct review of the\n\nfederal claims by the state appellate court and the United States Supreme Court or\n\nin other proceedings designed to remedy claims of unfair proceedings, denial of\n\nequal protection, and rights protected under § 1983. Id. at 798.\n\n      We agree with the reasoning in Sunflower County. ASU’s act of bringing a\n\nproceeding under Alabama’s eminent domain laws does not directly conflict with\n\n\n\n\n                                          12\n\fConley’s rights under §§ 1981 and 1985(3).8 Unlike the Civil Rights Act of 1964\n\nin Rachel, neither § 1981 or § 1985(3) contains specific provisions that immunize\n\nConley from the precise type of proceeding being brought in state court.\n\n          In Rachel, it was only because section 203(c) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\n\nexpressly immunized the defendants from prosecution for trespass when they\n\npeacefully attempted to gain admittance and remain at the restaurant, that “the\n\nmere pendency of the prosecutions enables the federal court to make the clear\n\nprediction that the defendants will be ‘denied or cannot enforce in the courts of\n\n(the) State’ the right to be free of any ‘attempt to punish’ them for protected\n\nactivity.” See Rachel, 384 U.S. at 804-05.9 No similarly explicit prohibition\n\n\n          8\n           Conley does not state precisely which rights under §§ 1981 and 1985(3) he has been\ndenied.\n          9\n         Conley’s reliance upon Sofarelli v. Pinellas County, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"559980\"><a href=\"/opinion/559980/michael-sofarelli-v-pinellas-county-pinellas-county-sheriff-dept-norman/\"><span class=\"volume\">931</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">718</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (11th Cir. 1991) is\nequally unavailing. In Sofarelli, the removing defendant was attempting to move a house on a\ntrailer over a public road in order to place it on a lot and sell it to a minority purchaser. The\nplaintiffs sought an injunction to prevent the defendant from relocating the house. The\ndefendant’s removal petition alleged that the plaintiffs’ request for an injunction was motivated\nby race and invoked § 3617 of the Fair Housing Act of 1968, which makes it unlawful “to\ncoerce, intimidate, threaten, or interfere with any other person . . . on account of his having aided\nor encouraged any other person in the exercise or enjoyment of any right granted” by the Fair\nHousing Act. See Sofarelli v. Pinellas County, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"559980\"><a href=\"/opinion/559980/michael-sofarelli-v-pinellas-county-pinellas-county-sheriff-dept-norman/\"><span class=\"volume\">931</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">718</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 720-22 & n.2 (11th Cir. 1991). In\nother words, the Fair Housing Act prohibited prosecution of a criminal or civil action against a\nperson who had encouraged another to exercise their rights under the Fair Housing Act. Id. at\n724-45. Neither § 1985(3) nor § 1981 contains a similar provision that could be read to prohibit\nthe bringing of a civil eminent domain action. Furthermore, the court in Sofarelli did not\nsquarely address this issue as the parties did not dispute that Sofarelli’s allegations fell within the\nholding of Rachel. See id. at 725. Rather the court addressed whether remand was nonetheless\nproper in light of the district court’s conclusion that Sofarelli had failed to state a claim under the\nFair Housing Act. Id.\n\n                                                  13\n\fagainst proceedings brought in retaliation for engaging in a protected activity, and\n\ncertainly no proscription against eminent domain proceedings, can be found in §§\n\n1981 or 1985(3). Therefore, no “equivalent basis [can] be shown for an equally\n\nfirm prediction that the defendant would be ‘denied or cannot enforce’ the\n\nspecified federal rights in the state court.” Id. at 804.\n\n       Furthermore, Conley’s allegation that he cannot get a fair trial in state court\n\nbecause the state trial judge is biased in favor of the defendant for political reasons\n\ndoes not state a cognizable ground for removal under § 1443(1). As the Supreme\n\nCourt has made clear, charges “that the defendant is unable to obtain a fair trial in a\n\nparticular state court” are insufficient to support removal under § 1443(1). See\n\nPeacock, 384 U.S. at 827. The allegedly corrupt or otherwise improper motives of\n\nan individual state court judge do not show that Conley will be unable ultimately to\n\nobtain fair market value for his property in Alabama’s state courts or to raise any\n\ndue process claims he may have in either the state court action or a separate action\n\nin federal court.10\n\n\n       10\n          We note that, as a result of Conley’s allegations of corruption in his removal petition,\nthe state trial judge has recused himself from the case to avoid any appearance of impropriety.\nFurthermore, we agree with ASU that Conley has failed to show that he cannot vindicate his\nrights in Alabama’s appellate courts. The denial of Conley’s petition for a writ of mandamus\ndoes not “operate as a binding decision on the merits.” See R.E. Grills, Inc. v. Davison, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1584267\"><a href=\"/opinion/1584267/re-grills-inc-v-davison/\"><span class=\"volume\">641</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">225</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 229 (Ala. 1994).
