GORDON delivered the opinion of the court:\n\n       These consolidated appeals arise from an action to quiet title to three parcels of\n\nreal estate and to recover damages for slander of title filed in the chancery division of the\n\ncircuit court of Cook County. Joseph J. Gambino (Gambino), as beneficiary of three\n\fseparate land trusts, and North Star Trust Company (North Star), as trustee under land\n\ntrust agreements Nos. 13534, 23985, and 23994, filed this action to quiet title to the three\n\nparcels of real estate and to recover damages for slander of title against certain\n\ndefendants. The subject properties are located at 7460 North Milwaukee Avenue in\n\nNiles, Illinois (Niles Property), 2738-40 North Kedzie Avenue in Chicago (Kedzie\n\nProperty), and 3619 North Lavergne Avenue in Chicago (Lavergne Property).1 Gambino\n\nsuffered a heart attack during his discovery deposition in this matter and died shortly\n\nthereafter. Joseph M. Gambino was substituted as party plaintiff as independent\n\nadministrator of his father’s estate.\n\n        After a two-week bench trial in late October and early November of 2007, the\n\ntrial court found in favor of plaintiffs on all counts of their complaint declaring (1) title to\n\nthe subject properties was vested in North Star under trust agreements Nos. 13534,\n\n23985, and 23994, and (2) all purported inconsistent instruments of title and any clouds\n\non title to the subject properties, including mortgage liens, were void. Further, the trial\n\ncourt awarded plaintiffs compensatory damages of $595,574 and (2) punitive damages of\n\n$675,000 as follows: $500,000, jointly and severally, against defendants Salvatore\n\nDiBenedetto, Vincenzo DiBenedetto, Dennis Koonce, Boulevard Mortgage Corporation,\n\nand Title America, Inc., and $175,000, jointly and severally, against defendants Stephen\n\nWolf and W.W. Funding, L.L.C. We affirm.\n\n\n\n\n        1\n            The properties will be referred to collectively as the “subject properties” where\n\nappropriate.\n\n                                                2\n\f                                       BACKGROUND\n\n                                       1. The Pleadings\n\n       Plaintiffs’ verified “Corrected Second Amended Complaint” contained six counts,\n\ntwo counts as to each of the three subject properties. As to each of the properties, one\n\ncount sought to quiet title and a second count alleged slander of title. The allegations of\n\nthe complaint common to all six counts were as follows.2 Gambino, 73 years old at the\n\ntime of his death in 2006, owned and operated the United Transmission Center (United),\n\nan Illinois corporation, a motor vehicle transmission repair business located at the Niles\n\nProperty. The Lavergne Property consisted of a four-unit, multifamily apartment\n\nbuilding that Gambino owned for “investment purposes.” In October 2002, Gambino\n\nmet with his nephew, defendant Salvatore DiBenedetto (Sal), whom Gambino believed to\n\nbe a mortgage broker, to assist him in refinancing one or more of his properties in order\n\nto pay off certain financial obligations. Over the following two months, Gambino and\n\nSal had several discussions, during which Sal obtained information concerning\n\nGambino’s business and assets, including information regarding the subject properties.\n\n       The complaint alleged that Sal represented to Gambino that he and several real\n\nestate investors were interested in purchasing the Niles and Kedzie Properties and the\n\ntransmission business. Sal suggested that the transmission business should be managed\n\nby his brother, defendant Enzo DiBenedetto (Enzo). Gambino refused. Shortly\n\n       2\n           Previous versions of plaintiffs’ complaint were verified by the sworn affidavit of\n\nGambino, prior to his death and preserved in plaintiffs’ “Corrected Second Amended\n\nComplaint,” which contained binding judicial admissions. Winnetka Bank v. Mandas,\n\n202 Ill. App. 3d 373, 396 (1990).\n\n                                               3\n\fthereafter in 2003, Sal offered to purchase the Lavergne Property in a written purchase\n\nagreement with an offer of $550,000. Gambino never accepted the offer.\n\n        The complaint further alleged that Sal personally loaned Gambino $70,000 to be\n\nrepaid upon future refinancing or sale of any of the subject properties. The complaint\n\nalleged that Sal requested permission to remove underground liquid storage tanks at the\n\nNiles Property prior to any transfer of the property, and Gambino refused.\n\n        The complaint further alleged that Gambino never: (1) signed any agreement\n\nregarding the conveyance of any of the subject properties, or the purchase of United; (2)\n\nauthorized Sal or anyone else to place liens or encumbrances upon any of the subject\n\nproperties, including any mortgages; (3) authorized anyone to affix his signature to any\n\ndocument concerning any of the subject properties; or (4) directed his land trustee North\n\nStar to transfer title or his beneficial interest in the subject properties to anyone.\n\n        The complaint further alleged that Sal, Enzo, Boulevard, and defendants Dennis\n\nKoonce and Title America, Inc. (Title America), “participated in” forging deeds, and\n\nother documents, to “procure and secure” mortgages on those properties. The complaint\n\nalleged that Koonce, an attorney, participated in each of the transactions that purported to\n\nconvey title to the subject properties. Additionally, the complaint alleged that Boulevard\n\nand Title America are both owned and controlled by Koonce, that Boulevard was the\n\nultimate grantee in a series of forged deeds pertaining to the Lavergne Property, and that\n\nTitle America acted as title agent with regard to all but one of the transactions that\n\npurported to convey title to the subject properties.\n\n        Count I of plaintiffs’ complaint, pled against Sal, Enzo, Koonce, Boulevard, Title\n\nAmerica, and Washington Mutual Bank, sought to quiet title to the Lavergne Property.\n\n                                               4\n\fCount I of plaintiff’s complaint alleged that in May 2003, a mortgage lien in favor of\n\nLaSalle Bank existed on the Lavergne Property, with a principal balance of\n\napproximately $200,000. On May 5, 2003, LaSalle “informed” Gambino that the\n\nmortgage had been paid in full although Gambino was unaware of this transaction.\n\n       Count I further alleged that unbeknownst to plaintiffs, Sal, Enzo, Koonce,\n\nBoulevard, and Title America recorded against the Lavergne Property: a forged trustee’s\n\ndeed purportedly executed by North Star, conveying title to the Lavergne Property to\n\nKoonce; a mortgage naming Koonce as the borrower and Equity Plus, Inc., as the lender,\n\nwith a principal sum of $400,000; a mortgage naming Koonce as the borrower and\n\nWashington Mutual as the lender with a principal sum of $406,000; and a quitclaim deed,\n\nlisting Koonce as the grantor and Boulevard as the grantee. Count I further alleges that\n\nSal, Enzo, Koonce, Boulevard, Title America and Washington Mutual knew or should\n\nhave known that the purported trustee’s deed conveying title to Koonce was forged.\n\n       Count II of plaintiffs’ complaint, pled against Sal, Enzo, Koonce, Boulevard, and\n\nTitle America, seeking compensatory and punitive damages, alleges slander of title with\n\nregard to the Lavergne Property.\n\n       Count III of plaintiffs’ complaint, pled against Sal, Enzo, Koonce, Title America,\n\nW.W. Funding, L.L.C. (WW Funding), Stephen Wolf, and Plaza Bank, sought to quiet\n\ntitle to the Niles Property. Count III alleged that in the early fall of 2003, Reuben\n\nZippershtein told Gambino that he was the mortgagee to the Niles Property and that the\n\nmortgage was in default. On January 21, 2004, Zippershtein filed suit to foreclose the\n\nmortgage. On July 9, 2004, Zippershtein voluntarily dismissed the foreclosure suit and\n\nexecuted a release deed of the recorded mortgage on the Niles Property.\n\n                                              5\n\f       Count III alleged that the Zippershtein mortgage was a result of forged and\n\nunauthorized instruments which were recorded by Sal, Enzo, Koonce, Boulevard, Title\n\nAmerica, Wolf and WW Funding. Count III further alleged that the following illegal\n\ninstruments were recorded against the Niles Property: a forged trustee’s deed,\n\npurportedly executed by North Star, conveying title to the Niles Property to “Joseph J.\n\nGambino”; a mortgage naming “Joseph J. Gambino” as the borrower and Zippershtein as\n\nthe lender, with a principal sum of $200,000; a warrantee deed, listing “Joseph J.\n\nGambino” as the grantor and WW Funding as the grantee; a mortgage, naming WW\n\nFunding as the borrower and defendant Plaza Bank as the lender, with a principal sum of\n\n$445,000; and an assignment, purporting to assign rents from WW Funding to Plaza\n\nBank. Count III further alleged that Sal, Enzo, Koonce, Boulevard, Title America, WW\n\nFunding, Wolf, and Plaza Bank knew or should have known that the purported trustee’s\n\ndeed conveying title to “Joseph J. Gambino” was forged.\n\n       Count IV of plaintiffs’ complaint, pled against Sal, Enzo, Koonce, Boulevard,\n\nTitle America, WW Funding, and Wolf, seeking compensatory and punitive damages,\n\nalleged slander of title with regard to the Niles Property.\n\n       Count V of plaintiffs’ complaint, pled against Sal, Enzo, Koonce, Boulevard,\n\nTitle America, WW Funding, Wolf, and Plaza Bank, sought to quiet title to the Kedzie\n\nProperty. Count V alleged that the following illegal instruments were recorded against\n\nthe Kedzie Property: a forged trustee’s deed, purportedly executed by North Star,\n\nconveying title to the Kedzie Property to “Joseph J. Gambino”; a forged warrantee deed,\n\nlisting “Joseph J. Gambino” as the grantor and 21st Century Financial Planners, Inc.\n\n\n\n                                              6\n\f(Century), as the grantee3; a special warranty deed, listing Century as grantor and WW\n\nFunding as grantee; a mortgage naming WW Funding as the borrower and Plaza Bank as\n\nthe lender, with a principal sum of $350,000; and an assignment, purporting to assign\n\nrents from WW Funding to Plaza Bank. Count V further alleged that Sal, Enzo, Koonce,\n\nBoulevard, Title America, WW Funding, Wolf, and Plaza Bank knew or should have\n\nknown that the purported trustee’s deed conveying title to “Joseph J. Gambino” was\n\nforged.\n\n          Count VI of plaintiffs’ complaint, pled against Sal, Enzo, Koonce, Boulevard,\n\nTitle America, WW Funding, and Wolf, seeking compensatory and punitive damages,\n\nalleged slander of title with regard to the Kedzie Property.\n\n          As noted, defendants Koonce, Boulevard, Title America, and WW Funding filed\n\ncounterclaims which included claims to quiet title to the subject properties. The Koonce\n\ndefendants’ (Koonce, Boulevard, and Title America) verified amended counterclaim\n\ncontained five counts. Count I of the Koonce-related defendants’ counterclaim sought a\n\njudgment to quiet title to the Lavergne Property in favor of Boulevard. Counts II, III, IV,\n\nand V of the Koonce defendants’ counterclaim alleged unjust enrichment, fraud,\n\nintentional interference with a business relationship, and slander of title, respectively.\n\n          Further, the Koonce defendants raised affirmative defenses to plaintiffs’\n\ncomplaint consisting of waiver, estoppel, ratification, and laches.\n\n          3\n              This warranty deed bears an execution date of January 17, 2003; the complaint\n\nalleges that on that same date, Gambino’s signature was forged to a commercial lease\n\nwhere Gambino purportedly leased the Kedzie Property from Century. This lease was\n\nsigned by Wolf on behalf of Century.\n\n                                                 7\n\f       WW Funding’s counterclaim was filed in two counts. One count concerned the\n\nKedzie Property and the other count concerned the Niles Property. In each count WW\n\nFunding sought to quiet title or, in the alternative, to obtain reimbursement from\n\nGambino’s estate for various sums.4\n\n                         2. Overview of the Events Leading to Trial\n\n       As noted, this case was tried as a bench trial over a two-week period in late\n\nOctober and early November of 2007. In order to provide context for the testimony\n\npresented in this case, we will provide an overview of the events leading to trial,\n\nincluding a description of the real estate closings, the disbursement of funds, and the\n\nparties’ involvement in those closings.\n\n       It is undisputed by the parties that Gambino was in serious financial debt in the\n\nsummer of 2002, owing overdue payroll and real estate taxes. United, Gambino’s motor\n\nvehicle transmission repair business, had failed to pay payroll taxes since 1999 and owed\n\nthe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) approximately $125,000 to $150,000 for back taxes,\n\npenalties, and interest. Gambino was in danger of losing properties, which had been sold\n\nto tax buyers for unpaid real estate taxes that were past due.\n\n       By June 2002, the payroll taxes had gone unpaid for years, and the IRS threatened\n\nto levy on United and close them down, seize its assets, and/or personally assess\n\n        4\n            At oral argument before this court on November 12, 2009, counsel for Wolf\n\nand WW Funding stated that both Wolf and WW Funding seek only to vacate the trial\n\ncourt’s findings against them with respect to slander of title, and that WW Funding no\n\nlonger seeks a finding of quiet title with respect to either the Kedzie or Niles Property\n\nor reimbursement from Gambino’s estate.\n\n                                              8\n\fGambino for the outstanding moneys due. In June 2002, Gambino hired Jeffrey Pritikin,\n\nwho testified in plaintiffs’ case-in-chief. Pritikin testified he was an accountant and an\n\n“enrolled agent” licensed to represent taxpayers before the IRS. He testified that one can\n\nbecome an “enrolled agent” by working for the IRS for five years, and he had worked for\n\nthe IRS for seven years. He is not an attorney and not a certified public accountant.\n\n       Pritikin testified that Gambino told him that he intended to borrow money by\n\nusing the subject properties as security; in September 2002, Gambino approached his\n\nnephew Sal, who “had contacts” in the mortgage industry. Pritikin spoke with Sal, who\n\nclaimed he was able to arrange a loan for Gambino and provided Pritikin with a\n\ncommitment letter to present to the IRS to “stall” any seizure of Gambino’s or United’s\n\nassets. Pritikin submitted a form to the IRS which contained a description of the subject\n\nproperties and their corresponding values, which were less than the values of what the\n\nsubject properties were appraised for.\n\n       Six transactions, two as to each of the subject properties, form the basis of\n\nplaintiffs’ complaint to quiet title and for damages for slander of title. The testimony at\n\ntrial concerning the transactions, and the circumstances surrounding them, indicate the\n\nfollowing. The witnesses whose testimony provides the basis for the following synopsis\n\nwere called as witnesses in plaintiffs’ case-in-chief, and they testified without objection\n\nunder the Dead-Man’s Act (735 ILCS 5/8-201 (West 2006)), as did Pritikin.\n\n       Sal sought a collateral-based lender for the Niles Property in the summer of 2002.\n\nHe met with Wolf and explained what he was looking for. Wolf spoke with his associate,\n\nReuben Zippershtein (since deceased), a “hard money” lender, who made a loan on the\n\nproperty. Sal testified that Zippershtein agreed to loan Gambino $200,000 to be repaid in\n\n                                              9\n\fone year, and that Zippershtein advised Gambino to direct North Star to convey legal title\n\nto Gambino because a loan could not be procured if legal title was held in trust.\n\n       Maritza Castillo, a senior trust officer for North Star, testified that Gambino\n\nexecuted three written directions to convey legal title to Gambino from the land trusts.\n\nHe told her that he was going to refinance the properties and required legal title conveyed\n\nto him personally.\n\n       Koonce testified that in October 2002, at Sal’s request, he began to give money to\n\nSal and Enzo for what he believed were loans to Gambino. Koonce testified that he\n\nsigned numerous checks payable to Sal and Enzo and gave them to Sal frequently over a\n\nperiod of about three years totaling of $157,300.\n\n       Sal testified that he arranged for an appraisal of the Niles Property, for which he\n\nand Enzo both testified Enzo paid the appraiser $5,000. Gambino accompanied the\n\nappraiser through the property during the appraisal. The property was appraised at\n\n$550,000, and the appraisal report was delivered to Zippershtein’s office. Sal testified\n\nthat he obtained an estimate of redemption for the past-due real estate taxes owed on the\n\nNiles Property and forwarded copies to Zippershtein, Gambino, and Koonce. Real estate\n\ntaxes had not been paid since 1999 and the property had been sold to a tax buyer.\n\n       Stephen Fritzshall, Zippershtein’s attorney, testified that Zippershtein telephoned\n\nhim to drop everything to prepare the legal documents to “save Gambino’s business and\n\nproperty.” Koonce faxed Fritzshall wire instructions and provided a copy of the title\n\ncommitment issued by Title America.\n\n       The first closing related to the Niles Property occurred on December 20, 2002.\n\nSal testified that he obtained the closing documents from Koonce and Fritzshall, the\n\n                                            10\n\ftrustee’s deed conveying title to Gambino and other documents from Gambino, “got the\n\ntransfer tax exemption stamp in Niles, and went to Zippershtein’s office for the checks\n\nand a conference call with Koonce.” Fritzshall, Zippershtein, Sal, and Wolf were\n\npresent, with Koonce representing the title company and assisting by telephone. Koonce\n\ntransmitted to Fritzshall an insurance binder and a signed Housing and Urban\n\nDevelopment (HUD) settlement statement signed by Koonce and purportedly signed by\n\nGambino.\n\n       Koonce testified that he made disbursements on behalf of Title America pursuant\n\nto Gambino’s purported letter of direction, which was delivered by Sal. Disbursements\n\nwere made to the following:\n\nStephen Wolf                  $5,250          (commitment fees)\nAdam Wolf                     $4,000          (commitment fees)\nZippershtein                  $15,750         (commitment fees)\nDecember Interest             $3,000          (on Zippershtein mortgage)\nFritzshall                    $1,500          (attorney fees)\nMortgage Escrow               $33,000         (11 months of payments on mortgage)\nSal                           $53,141.91      (for back taxes)\nEnzo                          $5,000          (appraisal fee)\nLawyers Title                 $282            (title policy, etc.)\nKoonce, Title America         $1490           (closing fees)\nGambino                       $52,586.09\nSal                           $25,000           (Sal testified that the moneys went to\n                                                Gambino)\n                              ----------------------------------------------------------\n                              $200,000          Total\n\n       Sal testified that he obtained a cashier’s check at Harris Bank for the property\n\ntaxes and cashed the check payable to him, paid the outstanding real estate taxes, drove\n\nto Gambino’s office in Niles and gave him copies of the tax paid receipts and of the title\n\ncompany checks, and $25,000 in cash and cashier’s checks (Sal could not recall what\n\nportion of the $25,000 was in currency or cashier’s checks). Sal obtained the deed at\n\n                                             11\n\fKoonce’s office on December 26, 2002, and had it recorded at the Cook County recorder\n\nof deed’s office in Markham, Illinois.\n\n       Within a month of the first transaction concerning the Niles Property, Sal\n\ncontacted investors, including Wolf, as funding sources for a loan on the Kedzie\n\nProperty. Wolf testified that he was not interested in lending money on the Kedzie\n\nProperty but that he telephoned an investor David Azran and asked Azran if he wanted to\n\nmake a loan. Azran agreed to do so through his company, 21st Century Financial\n\n(Century). Sal testified that he was introduced to Stephen Richek, Azran’s attorney.\n\n       Century purportedly loaned Gambino $200,000, through a sale and lease back of\n\nthe Kedzie Property, which was to include a purchase option to Gambino. Century was\n\nto hold title for a year, receive $3,000 per month pursuant to the purported lease,\n\nmaintain a reserve for interest, taxes, and insurance and funds to cover all the costs of the\n\nloan and the fees involved, and, if Gambino did not pay off the loan in a year, keep title.\n\n       Richek prepared the legal documentation for the transaction. Marc Smith was\n\nalso involved as attorney for the Wolfs in the transaction, and prepared some of the\n\ndocumentation. Estimates of redemption for the outstanding Kedzie Property real estate\n\ntaxes were obtained by Sal.\n\n       The closing took place on January 17, 2003. Sal delivered what purported to be a\n\ntrustee’s deed for the Kedzie Property conveying title to Gambino. Sal testified that he\n\npicked up closing documents from Koonce and the deed and other documents from\n\nGambino, and delivered them to Richek at Zippershtein’s office. He testified that he\n\nobtained a $200,000 check from Century at Zippershtien’s office and delivered it to\n\n\n\n                                             12\n\fKoonce. Azran was not at the closing. The lease purporting to have Gambino’s\n\nsignature was signed by Richek on behalf of the lessor.\n\n       The following disbursements were made at the January 17, 2003, closing relating\n\nto the Kedzie Property:\n\nCentury                       $9,250         (January rent ($3,000) & loan fee)\nSteven Wolf                   $6,250         (commitment fee)\nAdam Wolf                     $6,250         (loan fee)\nHarris Bank                   $30,274.83     (back taxes)\nMarc Smith                    $2,500         (attorney fees)\nZippershtein                  $6,250         (commitment fee)\nRichek                        $500           (attorney fees)\nChesterfield Insurance        $3,368         (insurance)\nLawyers Title                 $2,134\nTitle America                 $1,190         (title insurance)\nLease Payment                 $3,000         (February lease payment)\nNorman Trust Account          $25,000        (the disbursement sheet notes that this\n                                             amount was to “pay off investor.” At trial,\n                                             Sal admitted that this amount was used to\n                                             fund a settlement of a lawsuit against him\n                                             for fraud)\nCasale, Woodward & Bulls      $5,372.72      (attorney fees)\nLease Escrow                  $30,000        (10 months of lease payments)\nWater Certificate Escrow      $8,000\nJames Halle                   $16,000           (cash purportedly given to Gambino)\nMark Guillermo                $9,660.45         (cash purportedly given to Gambino)\nPapiese                       $25,000           (cash purportedly given to Gambino)\nGambino                       $10,000           (cash Gambino acknowledged he received)\n                              ----------------------------------------------------------\n                              $200,000          Total\n\nThe deed was recorded on January 23, 2003.\n\n       In January 2003, after the two aforementioned closings had already occurred,\n\nGambino returned the three North Star trustee’s deeds he had obtained in December 2002\n\nto North Star, which cancelled the deeds.\n\n\n\n\n                                            13\n\f       The first closing related to the Lavernge Property occurred on April 30, 2003, at\n\nLawyers Title. A mortgage lien in favor of LaSalle Bank existed on the Lavergne\n\nProperty.\n\n       Prior to closing, Koonce applied for and obtained a $400,000 loan from Equity\n\nPlus. Equity Plus later assigned its mortgage to Countrywide Mortgage. Sal delivered a\n\ntrustee’s deed to Lawyers Title dated April 28, 2003, purporting to convey legal title on\n\nthe Lavergne Property from North Star as trustee to Koonce. Koonce transferred the\n\nassignment of rents from the leases on the four Lavergne Property apartments on May 1,\n\n2003, to Countrywide.\n\n       The following disbursements were made on the refinancing:\n\nLaSalle Bank                  $219,551.03    (mortgage loan payoff)\nEquity Plus                   $1,093.11      (loan fees)\nBoulevard                     $850           (loan application and processing fees)\nLawyers Title                 $930           (closing and underwriting fees)\nRecording Fees                $114\nChesterfield Insurance        $3,628            (insurance premium)\nKoonce                        $32,926.71        (payment escrow for mortgage payments for\n                                                one year)\nSBC Ameritech                 $4,470            (for Gambino’s past due account)\nEquity Plus                   $3,337.15         (loan fees)\nCountrywide Funding           $3,100            (loan fees)\nHarris Bank                   $10,000           (cash purportedly given to Gambino)\nEnzo                          $10,000           (cash purportedly given to Gambino)\nEnzo                          $110,000          (wired funds purportedly given to Gambino)\n                              --------------------------------------------------------\n                              $400,000          Total\n\n       A second closing concerning the Lavergne Property occurred on December 17,\n\n2003, when Koonce refinanced the property for just over $400,000 from Washington\n\nMutual. Koonce applied for the loan as borrower and quitclaimed title to the Lavergne\n\nProperty to his mortgage company, Boulevard, on the day of closing.\n\n\n                                            14\n\f       At closing, the balance of the Countrywide loan, $399,896.60, was paid. Overdue\n\nreal estate taxes, in the amount of $2,487.83, were also paid. Settlement charges,\n\nincluding loan fees, interest, title charges, and recording fees, were paid in the amount of\n\n$3,222.05.\n\n       A second closing also occurred when the Kedzie Property was refinanced in\n\nDecember 2003. Century had not been paid on its mortgage for the loan it made on the\n\nKedzie Property. In December 2003, Sal met with Wolf and told him that Century was\n\ngoing to take title to the Kedzie Property, and asked if Wolf would provide a loan to\n\nprevent its loss. Wolf testified that he met with Sal and Gambino, and that during that\n\nmeeting Gambino told him that Sal was authorized to act on his behalf with regard to any\n\nloan secured by the Kedzie Property. Wolf made the loan through his company, WW\n\nFunding.\n\n       The transaction was structured so that the Century loan would be repaid and the\n\nproperty would be conveyed to WW Funding as collateral for the loan. WW Funding\n\nborrowed $350,000 from Plaza Bank, took title to the property, paid the Century\n\nmortgage, and granted an option to purchase the property to Koonce. The option\n\nprovided that if the loan from Plaza was paid within a year, WW Funding would convey\n\ntitle to Koonce. Sal testified that he received a document prepared by Richek or Marc\n\nSmith assigning the purchase option, under the lease of the Kedzie Property from\n\nCentury to Gambino (as noted, the first transaction involving the Kedzie Property was\n\nstructured as a “sale/leaseback”), to WW Funding. Sal testified that he obtained\n\nGambino’s signature on that document and returned the executed assignment to either\n\nRichek or Smith.\n\n                                             15\n\f       The following disbursements were made on this refinancing:\n\n\nTax Escrow                     $1,988.14         (for payment of future real estate taxes)\nPlaza Bank                     $5,250            (loan fees)\nPlaza Bank                     $200              (loan document preparation fees)\nFlood Certificate              $15\nTax Service Fee                $50\nCentury                        $218,008.49       (mortgage loan payoff)\nMarc Smith                     $42,000           (escrow for monthly rent payments under\n                                                 agreement granting Koonce purchase\n                                                 option)\nWW Funding                     $33,738.74        (“cash to borrower”)\nWW Funding                     $25,800           (commitment fee & $800 insurance\n                                                 payment)\nLawyers Title                  $2,380            (recording fees, tax transfer stamps)\nTitle America                  $2,511.50         (settlement & title insurance)\nCook County Collector          $17,808.13        (back real estate taxes)\nWater Certificate              $250\n                               ---------------------------------------------------------------\n                               $350,000          Total\n\n       A second closing related to the Niles Property for refinancing occurred in June\n\n2004. The December 2002 Zippershtein loan had not been paid. Fritzshall sent a letter to\n\nGambino in December 2003, demanding payment. On January 16, 2004, Gambino sent a\n\nletter to Fritzshall, denying the existence of the loan. Zippershtein filed a mortgage\n\nforeclosure action and later voluntarily dismissed the case. Link testified that in 2004,\n\nGambino told him that the foreclosure action filed by Zippershtein was being dismissed\n\nbecause “somebody had paid off the loan.” An agreed order of dismissal entered in that\n\naction stated that the “debt at issue was paid in full.”\n\n       Koonce testified that Enzo, who had planned on acquiring Gambino’s business\n\nand the buildings housing the business, desired an option to purchase the business and\n\nproperty. The transaction was structured as a refinance, with WW Funding borrowing\n\n$445,000, to pay off the Zippershtein mortgage, and providing Koonce with an option to\n\n                                               16\n\fpurchase the property for $230,000. Koonce testified that the option was actually for\n\nGambino’s benefit, because Gambino had financial issues and did not have enough credit\n\nto structure a deal. Koonce was creditworthy and would be able to secure financing to\n\n“save” the property.\n\n       An agreement purportedly signed by Gambino allowed WW Funding to acquire\n\ntitle to the Niles Property and grant an option to Koonce to purchase the property for\n\n$230,000, the amount necessary to pay off the Zippershtein loan. Sal testified that he\n\nobtained Gambino’s signature on the agreement, and also had him sign a warranty deed\n\nto WW Funding that he had notarized. Sal further testified that Gambino signed a power\n\nof attorney authorizing Sal to sign any documents necessary to complete the transaction.\n\n       The closing occurred at Attorneys Title. Sal signed documents on behalf of\n\nGambino, including the HUD statement. WW Funding borrowed $445,000 from Plaza\n\nBank, took title to the property, and paid off the Zippershtein mortgage.\n\n       The following disbursements were made at closing:\n\nZippershtein                  $231,680.08       (mortgage loan payoff)\nPullman Bank                  $6,675            (commitment fee)\nPlaza Bank                    $830              (closing fees)\nPlaza Bank                    $45,000           (underground tank removal escrow)\nReal Estate Capital Corp.     $6,675            (commitment fee (Adam Wolf’s brokerage\n                                                firm))\nCounty Taxes                  $7,535.88         (real estate taxes)\nAttorney Title                $2,636.50         (state & county stamps, title insurance, etc.)\nRecording Fees                $82\nCourier                       $30\nMarc Smith                    $7,500            (attorney fees)\nWater Certificate             $1,184.16\nBalance to WW Funding         $135,171.38\n                              ------------------------------------------------------------\n                              $445,000          Total\n\nGambino received nothing.\n\n                                              17\n\f       In July 2004, after the claimed refinancing of the Niles Property, Gambino\n\nrefused to allow workers to remove the underground tanks. In the fall of 2004, Enzo, Sal,\n\nand Gambino met with Gambino’s first cousin Thomas Gambino (Thomas), who also is\n\nSal and Enzo’s uncle, in an attempt to resolve some of the problems they were having.\n\nThomas testified that at the meeting, Gambino confirmed that he had discussed selling\n\nthe subject properties with Sal and Enzo, and had agreed to let Sal sell one of his\n\nproperties, and if that worked out to proceed with the others, and talked with Enzo about\n\npurchasing United.\n\n       At the meeting, Thomas testified that Gambino said that he wanted his properties\n\nback. Sal said he could not make that happen at that time; the deal had to be completed\n\nor Gambino would lose everything.\n\n       In December 2004, Gambino executed a letter to Enzo and Sal “to stop all activity\n\nrelating to the pending business transaction involving the businesses and properties.”\n\nWhen Enzo was cleaning up the Kedzie Property in February 2005, Gambino called the\n\npolice and Enzo was charged with criminal trespass. Enzo was found not guilty after a\n\nbench trial. In March 2005, Gambino and North Star filed this action.\n\n                                          3. Trial\n\n       The following testimony was presented at trial.\n\n                                    a. Plaintiffs’ Witnesses\n\n       Gambino’s widow, Catherine, was called as a witness at trial. She testified that\n\nshe was married to Gambino on November 15, 1952, and that the two remained married\n\nuntil Gambino’s death in 2006. After serving in the military for approximately 10 years,\n\n\n\n                                             18\n\fGambino started a transmission repair business (United) in the 1960s at the Kedzie\n\nProperty.\n\n        Catherine testified that she was familiar with Gambino’s signature. She identified\n\nplaintiff’s exhibit No. 44, which contained a series of handwriting samples, marked K1\n\nthrough K36, which she identified as her husband’s signature. She then reviewed\n\nplaintiff’s exhibits Nos. 5 through 43, which consisted of legal documents purportedly\n\nsigned by Gambino concerning the subject properties. She testified that the signatures\n\ncontained on the documents were not Gambino’s signatures.\n\n        On cross-examination, Catherine testified without objection that she was aware\n\nthat Gambino spoke to Sal and Enzo regarding business matters, but did not know the\n\ndetails of those conversations. She identified her signature as well as Gambino’s\n\nsignature on a mortgage loan commitment dated November 29, 2002, signed by Sal on\n\nbehalf of Boulevard relating to the procurement of a mortgage on her residence.\n\nCatherine testified that Gambino was attempting to obtain loans due to financial\n\ndifficulties he was experiencing, including back taxes owed to the IRS.\n\n        Maritza Castillo testified at trial. She testified that she was employed by North\n\nStar as trust officer for six years prior to the trial in this matter. She testified that\n\nGambino was the sole beneficiary of the land trusts held by North Star under trust\n\nagreement Nos. 13534, 23985, and 23994, until the time of his death. Castillo identifed\n\nthree trustee’s deeds purportedly executed by her and Phyllis Robinson, vice president of\n\nNorth Star. She testified that the signatures bearing her name and Robinson’s were not\n\ngenuine, and that the trustee’s deeds were not authentic. She also identified a trust\n\nagreement purportedly signed by her as trust officer, dated April 9, 1962, pertaining to\n\n                                                19\n\fthe Lavergne Property, which showed Koonce as the sole beneficiary of the land trust.\n\nShe testified that the land trust agreement was not authentic and that the signature on the\n\ntrust agreement bearing her name was not genuine.\n\n         On cross-examination, Castillo identified three canceled trustee’s deeds executed\n\nat Gambino’s direction in December 2002 regarding the subject properties. Prior to their\n\ncancellation, the trustee’s deeds conveyed legal title from North Star to Gambino.\n\nCastillo testified without objection that Gambino directed North Star to convey him legal\n\ntitle because he planned to refinance the subject properties, but he returned the\n\ndocuments to North Star a few weeks later and directed North Star to cancel them. On\n\nfurther cross-examination, Castillo testified that there was no way that one could\n\ndetermine that the trustee’s deeds from North Star were forged by simply viewing the\n\ndeeds.\n\n         Phyllis Robinson also testified at trial. She was retired at the time of trial, but\n\npreviously was vice president of North Star. Her testimony echoed that of Castillo; she\n\nidentifed three trustee’s deeds purportedly executed by her and Castillo. She testified\n\nthat the signatures bearing her name and Castillo’s name were not genuine.\n\n         Pritikin was then called as a witness and testified that he was an accountant\n\nlicensed to practice before the IRS in representing the interests of taxpayers as an\n\n“enrolled agent.” Pritikin testified that Gambino retained him in June 2002 to represent\n\nhim with regard to “payroll tax problems.” He testified that Gambino and United owed\n\nthe IRS between $125,000 and $150,000. Pritikin told Gambino that the IRS could shut\n\nUnited down if the tax liability was not settled. Pritikin testified that Gambino told him\n\n\n\n                                               20\n\fthat he was going to borrow money against some of his properties with the assistance of\n\nSal so that he could settle United’s liability with the IRS.\n\n       Pritikin testified that Gambino directed him to speak with Sal in November 2002,\n\nand Sal told him he was employed by Boulevard and could obtain loans on Gambino’s\n\nproperties. Sal sent Pritikin via facsimile a loan commitment from Boulevard showing\n\nGambino approved for a loan signed by Sal.\n\n       On August 7, 2003, Pritikin spoke with Sal requesting documentation regarding a\n\nrefinance or sale of Gambino’s properties because the IRS was threatening to seize\n\nUnited. Pritikin testified that he never received any documentation from Sal regarding a\n\nrefinance or sale of the subject properties.\n\n       Stephen Link, an attorney since 1995, was called as a witness. He testified that he\n\nwas Gambino’s counsel from 2002 until shortly after the instant case was filed, when he\n\nwithdrew. Link testified that he was never made aware that any loans were procured on\n\nthe subject properties. Link filed an appearance in the Zippershtein foreclosure suit, and\n\nwhen the suit was dismissed, Gambino was “surprised” and told Link that “someone had\n\npaid off the mortgage.”\n\n       Sal was then called by plaintiffs as an adverse witness. Sal testified that at the\n\ntime of trial, he was unemployed. He testified that he never held employment where he\n\nearned a salary or wage, and had never received unemployment benefits. He testified\n\nthat he had been living on moneys borrowed or gifted from family members. Sal\n\ntestified that he had not held a bank account for approximately 12 to 15 years, and that he\n\nconducted all his financial transactions in cash and on rare occasions by cashier’s check.\n\nSal identified the loan commitment sent to Pritikin by facsimile transmission, on\n\n                                               21\n\fBoulevard letterhead, and identified his signature on the document above the signature\n\nline as the “authorized signature.”\n\n       Sal testified that had known Koonce since the fall of 2001 and that Koonce was\n\nan attorney and owned both Boulevard and Title America. Sal testified that he never\n\nrepresented to anyone that he worked for Boulevard. Sal testified that he and Enzo “had\n\na couple of business transactions going on” with Koonce regarding Gambino. He\n\ntestified that Koonce lent money to both him and Enzo and they gave the funds totalling\n\n$180,000 to Gambino.\n\n       Sal testified that his role in the transactions described in the plaintiffs’ complaint\n\nwas limited, but admitted he attended at least five of the closings at issue. He was shown\n\nall the documents that plaintiffs claimed had forgeries of Gambino’s signatures; of the\n\ndocuments he recognized, he claimed that all of them were signed by Gambino in his\n\npresence. Sal identified the notary of Gambino’s signature on all of the contested\n\ndocuments as that of Regina Brophy, who worked as a legal secretary for the Cook\n\nCounty public defender’s office in Markham, Illinois, where Sal’s uncle, Thomas\n\nGambino, was employed as a supervisor of criminal investigations. Sal testified that it\n\nwas his practice to have Gambino sign the documents at United’s Niles location, drive\n\nthe documents to Brophy in Markham, together with a copy of Gambino’s driver’s\n\nlicense, and present it to her to be notarized.\n\n       Sal testified that he never kept any money for his participation in the various\n\ntransactions involving the subject properties. When Sal was first approached by\n\nGambino in the fall of 2002 about refinancing his properties, Gambino signed various\n\nauthorizations allowing Sal to obtain Gambino’s credit report. He also received a list of\n\n                                              22\n\fGambino’s properties, showing their value and mortgage indebtedness. The listing\n\nshowed that the Niles Property had an estimated value of $550,000 with no mortgage\n\ndebt, the Kedzie property had an estimated value of $1.2 million with no mortgage debt,\n\nand the Lavergne Property had an estimated value of $450,000 with a mortgage debt of\n\n$223,000.\n\n       Sal testified that he and Wolf were present at the December 20, 2002, closing.\n\nSal testified that Gambino had signed all the relevant legal documents prior to the\n\nclosing. Sal testified that he prepared the accounting of the funds distributed at the\n\nDecember 20, 2002, closing. He testified that the accounting showed that Koonce earned\n\nan attorney’s fee of $750, Enzo received a check for $5,000 for the appraisal, and that he\n\nreceived a check for $25,000 which he converted to cash and gave to Gambino.\n\n       Sal testified that he made loans to Gambino, totaling $770,000, but could not\n\nprovide an accounting. Sal testified that Gambino owed him a balance between $150,000\n\nand $200,000.\n\n       In early 2005, Sal worked with WW Funding, which held title the Kedzie\n\nProperty and had the locks changed. Sal also testified that he made repairs to the\n\nLavergne Property after Boulevard had acquired title to the property.\n\n       Sal deposited a cashier’s check payable to Gambino for $42,586.09 into one of\n\nGambino’s accounts concerning the Niles Property. Sal identified a check that Gambino\n\npaid to either Sal or Enzo for unpaid property taxes in the amount of $24,067.48, which\n\nshowed up in a deposit into Enzo’s account of $24,067.48 on December 30, 2002, and\n\nshowed no withdrawals on that date.\n\n\n\n                                             23\n\f       Sal testified that Gambino was not at the Kedzie closing but had signed all the\n\nclosing documents in Sal’s presence, and Sal then delivered the documents to the closing.\n\n       Sal was shown an entry on the disbursement sheet of a $25,000 payment made to\n\nthe “Norman Trust Account” to “payoff investor.” At first, Sal testified that the Norman\n\nTrust payment constituted repayment of an investor on behalf of Gambino, but then\n\nadmitted this payment was made to fund a settlement of a suit against him for fraud.\n\n       The parties stipulated that a $25,000 cashier’s check drawn on Title America’s\n\naccount at Harris Bank payable to Enzo’s girlfriend Kathleen Papiese was funds\n\ndeposited into Papiese’s bank account and that Enzo was a signatory to that account.\n\n       Sal testified that a payment of fees to a law firm Casale, Woodward & Bulls for\n\n$5,372.72 was not for Gambino’s benefit, although it originated from a mortgage placed\n\non the Kedzie Property.\n\n       Sal testified that he prepared the April 30, 2003, disbursements on the Lavergne\n\nProperty, claiming that $130,000 in cash was given to Gambino.\n\n       Sal admitted that no funds were given to Gambino from the Kedzie Property\n\nclosing. Checks were written to Marc Smith, which were ultimately disbursed to WW\n\nFunding. Plaza Bank provided the financing for this transaction. Sal testified that he\n\nalso procured Gambino’s signature on an assignment of an option that allowed WW\n\nFunding to acquire the Kedzie Property by paying off the Century loan.\n\n       Sal claimed Gambino had given him a power of attorney for the Niles Property.\n\nSal signed the HUD statement, in which $135,171.38 was disbursed to WW Funding. No\n\nfunds were written to Gambino. In this transaction, WW Funding purportedly purchased\n\n\n\n                                            24\n\fthe Niles Property from Gambino for $230,000 based on a contract on which Sal claimed\n\nhe had procured Gambino’s signature.\n\n       Regina Brophy, a 25-year legal secretary for the office of the Cook County public\n\ndefender in Markham, testified at trial. She is a notary public who worked with Thomas\n\nGambino. She testified she notarized signatures for Sal without ever seeing the people\n\nwho signed the documents or knowing whether they were genuine. She testified, “I just\n\ntrusted him.”\n\n       Thomas Gambino testified that he was a supervisor of criminal investigations in\n\nthe public defender’s Markham office. Sal and Enzo are his nephews. He testified that\n\nhe attended a meeting in late 2004 with Gambino, Enzo and Sal, at Enzo’s request, to\n\nhelp Enzo “straighten out” some problems he and Sal were having with Gambino. He\n\ntestified that his role at this meeting was as a mediator, because whatever business deals\n\nSal and Enzo had with Gambino were nearing a “complete breakdown.”\n\n       Thomas testified that Gambino explained he had engaged in conversations with\n\nSal and Enzo about selling his properties and possibly retiring when Gambino received\n\nnotification from his bank that one of his properties had been sold without his\n\nknowledge, and he ordered them to stop doing anything further. Gambino said that he\n\ngave Sal and Enzo permission to sell one of his properties, but Thomas did not identify\n\nwhich property Gambino was referring to.\n\n       Sal said Gambino “was confused and did not quite understand how the deal was\n\nput together.” When asked how it was that Gambino had lost control of his properties,\n\nSal said “that it had to be part of the deal because [the investors had] to have more\n\nassurance and *** more property,” in order for the deal to proceed. Sal said that he had\n\n                                             25\n\fgiven Gambino $60,000 in “good faith” money and that more moneys would be paid\n\nGambino at “the close of the deal.”\n\n       Gambino requested his properties back and Sal told Gambino the deals were\n\n“nonreversible.” Sal said the investors “were people that you don’t fool around with\n\nonce [you] make a deal.”\n\n       Steven Fritzshall, a licensed attorney since 1981, was then called as a witness. He\n\nrepresented Zippershtein in connection with the mortgage on the Niles Property. In\n\nconnection with this transaction he testified that Koonce claimed that he was Gambino’s\n\nattorney.\n\n       In December 2003, Fritzshall wrote to Gambino regarding a default on the\n\nZippershtein mortgage. Gambino responded, “In response to your letter, I have told Mr.\n\nZippershtein several times the loan you are referring to was not made by me. I did not\n\nreceive any loan from Mr. Zippershtein. The loans you are referring to are not valid.”\n\n       Barry Mullin testified that in 2003, he was employed as a personal banker for\n\nLaSalle Bank/ABN Amro, which had held a mortgage on the Lavergne Property.\n\nGambino asked him to find out how his loan had been paid. Mullin called Koonce, who\n\n“informed [Mullin] he had paid off the mortgage because [the property] had been deeded\n\nto him.”\n\n       David Azran testified that he was the sole shareholder of Century, which was the\n\nlender involved in the first transaction related to the Kedzie Property. He made the loan\n\nas a result of a call he received from Zippershtein and Wolf. They told him the\n\ntransaction was a “sale/leaseback” of $200,000, with interest at 18% per year. The\n\ntransaction was structured so that if the borrower did not pay the loan within a year,\n\n                                             26\n\fCentury would have the right to retain title to the property given to it as security for the\n\ndebt. He testified that, Azran, Wolf, and Zippershtein agreed to share in ownership if the\n\npurchase option was never exercised.\n\n        Phillip Cali testified that he was an independent agent for Service Insurance\n\nAgents and was Gambino’s insurance agent. Cali testified that the certificate of\n\ninsurance concerning the Niles Property was not authentic and did not bear his signature.\n\n        Rogelio Llamedo testified that he owned, developed and managed property in\n\nChicago. He met Gambino in early 2006. Llamedo testified, over an objection under the\n\nDead-Man’s Act (735 ILCS 5/8-201 (West 2006)), that on January 12, 2006, he entered\n\ninto a contract to purchase the Kedzie Property from Gambino for $1.4 million. On that\n\ndate, Llamedo also entered into a contract to purchase the house adjacent to the Kedzie\n\nProperty. It was his intent to develop the properties. He testified that he had the\n\nfinancial ability to close on the contract to purchase the Kedzie Property in January 2006\n\nand retained that ability at the time of trial.\n\n        Diane Marsh, a forensic document examiner, was qualified as an expert\n\nhandwriting witness. She compared Gambino’s known handwriting samples with the\n\nquestioned documents at issue. Marsh testified that experts in her field utilize a hierarchy\n\nof conclusions, ranging from the most certain to the least certain. The highest degree of\n\nconfidence is called an identification, which means that the forensic document examiner\n\nhas no reservations concerning the authenticity of the signature. In expressing her\n\nopinion regarding the authenticity of the suspect signatures, Marsh utilized the highest\n\nlevel of certainty.\n\n\n\n                                                  27\n\f       Marsh described at length the procedures she followed in reaching her conclusion\n\nand the basis for the three separate reports she issued in the case. Marsh’s examination\n\ninvolved the detection of possible autoforgery, which are instances “where somebody\n\ntries to disguise their own signature so they can deny it later.” Simulations, on the other\n\nhand, are signatures of a third party meant to appear authentic. She testified that it is\n\nextremely difficult to create a series of autoforgeries that could escape detection. Her\n\nconclusion was, “Mr. Gambino did not disguise his own signatures,” and the 39\n\nsignatures contained on plaintiffs’ exhibits Nos. 5 through 43 were not Gambino’s. It\n\nwas also her opinion that all but one of the questioned documents were signed by the\n\nsame person, and that the one questioned document was also not signed by Gambino.\n\n       On cross-examination Marsh testified that the handwriting samples that she\n\nconsidered in reaching her opinion were all tendered by Gambino, and that she did not\n\nuse the retainer check for her services as one of the samples in reaching her opinion.\n\n       Dennis Koonce, a licensed attorney since 1986, was called as an adverse witness.\n\nKoonce is the sole shareholder of Title America and Boulevard. Title America acted as\n\nthe “policy issuing agent” for five of the six transactions. The one exception was the\n\nsecond transaction related to the Niles Property.\n\n       Koonce was shown the loan application in connection with the first Lavergne\n\nclosing, dated April 30, 2003. Koonce signed it and certified the accuracy of the\n\ninformation; in it, he listed the Lavergne Property as one of his own properties, claiming\n\nhe had acquired it in 1995. The application for the loan was submitted as a refinance. He\n\nwas then shown a purported trust agreement between Koonce and North Star as trust No.\n\n13534, dated April 9, 1962, signed by Koonce. Koonce was shown copies of leases\n\n                                             28\n\fpertaining to the Lavergne Property when he was the lessor, although the dates of the\n\nleases preceded the first transaction concerning the Lavergne Property. Koonce\n\nidentified his signature on the leases.\n\n       Koonce identified the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) form from\n\nthe closing concerning the refinancing transaction of the Lavergne Property on December\n\n17, 2003, which he signed. He identified a similar set of leases that had been submitted\n\nto Washington Mutual regarding the Lavergne Property, and a mortgage loan application\n\nsigned by him for $800,000 regarding the Niles and Kedzie Properties. He testified that,\n\nin the schedule listing real estate owned, he had listed the Niles, Kedzie and Lavergne\n\nProperties as his own.\n\n       Koonce identified his agreement with WW Funding to acquire the Niles and\n\nKedzie Properties granting him an option to acquire the properties after WW Funding\n\nhad paid off Century and Zippershtein. Koonce testified that he had entered into this\n\nseries of agreements for the benefit of Gambino. He claimed “the money that I advanced\n\nto [Gambino] was going to be lost and these properties were not saved so in an effort to\n\nsave them yes I did and [Gambino] did nothing to preserve that.”\n\n       Enzo was then called as an adverse witness. Enzo was asked about the funds\n\nshown as being disbursed to him and to his girlfriend from various transactions, and he\n\nadmitted receiving them.\n\n       Stephen Wolf was then called as an adverse witness. He had been a real estate\n\ninvestor for 40 years. Wolf said he never paid Gambino anything when he acquired the\n\nKedzie Property from Century or when he acquired the Niles Property by paying off the\n\nZippershtein loan. Wolf estimated the value of the Niles Property as between $550,000\n\n                                            29\n\fand $700,000. He testified that Gambino’s name appeared nowhere in connection with\n\nthe various option agreements granted to Koonce.\n\n        Wolf testified he met with Gambino prior to the refinancing transaction on the\n\nKedzie Property, prior to granting Koonce an option. He said that during this meeting,\n\nno terms were discussed, but he had requested that, if a problem arose, Gambino should\n\ncontact him. Wolf testified that Gambino was not accompanied by an attorney. Wolf\n\nidentified an outline of the agreement WW Funding was to have with Koonce regarding\n\nthe Kedzie Property. Wolf did not have Gambino sign it to indicate his assent. Wolf\n\nadmitted that he never attempted to communicate with Gambino when problems arose\n\nconcerning the Koonce option.\n\n        Joseph M. Gambino was the independent administrator of his father’s estate. He\n\nhad worked at the transmission shop his father operated at the Kedzie Property and was\n\nfamiliar with the manner in which Gambino carried on his business. He was familiar\n\nwith Gambino’s signature and had observed him sign documents many times. He was\n\nshown the signatures on plaintiffs’ exhibits Nos. 5 through 43, and he testified that the\n\nsignatures were not his father’s.\n\n                                    b. Defense Witnesses\n\n        Enzo testified that he met with Gambino in 2002. He testified, over an objection\n\nunder the Dead-Man’s Act, that Gambino agreed to the purchase price of $2.8 million for\n\nthe subject properties and the house adjacent to the Kedzie Property, which Gambino also\n\nowned. To raise the money, Sal introduced Enzo to Koonce, to help him obtain\n\nfinancing. Gambino told Enzo he did not have books that would substantiate his business\n\nprofit and loss.\n\n                                             30\n\f        Plaintiffs’ exhibit No. 151 was a listing of checks Enzo received, which he\n\nclaimed he had cashed and the proceeds of which he had given to Gambino, either in the\n\nform of currency or cashier’s checks. Enzo never obtained a receipt.\n\n        Enzo thought he was going to be taking over Gambino’s business in January of\n\n2003. However, he testified that Gambino decided not to allow him to assume control.\n\nInspections were performed on the Kedzie Property and Gambino allowed the inspection.\n\nEnzo testified that the $25,000 received by Enzo’s girlfriend was later converted to cash,\n\ncashier’s checks or money orders and delivered to Gambino.\n\n        Regarding the wire transfer of $110,000 to his account from the first closing\n\nconcerning the Lavergne Property, Enzo testified he delivered these funds to Gambino in\n\ncash.\n\n        After Enzo met with Gambino and Thomas Gambino in late 2004, he went to the\n\nKedzie Property to “clean-up.” At the same time, he also applied for a business license\n\nand had several meetings with Gambino. In February 2005, Gambino “had [him]\n\narrested for trespassing.” Enzo made arrangements to move underground storage tanks at\n\nthe Niles Property in July 2004. Enzo identified various permits he obtained from\n\ngovernmental agencies regarding work to be performed at the Niles and Kedzie\n\nProperties.\n\n        On cross-examination, Enzo was unable to recall any document signed by\n\nGambino memorializing any agreement between Gambino and Enzo or Sal with regard to\n\nthe subject properties. Enzo admitted receiving a letter from Gambino dated December\n\n16, 2004, to cease any activity with regard to the subject properties. In February 2005,\n\n\n\n                                            31\n\fEnzo had the locks changed at the Kedzie Property at the instruction of WW Funding.\n\nEnzo did not believe that Gambino had any further interest in the building at the time.\n\n       Sal also testified in defendants’ case-in-chief and identified a credit report that he\n\nhad obtained concerning Gambino. Based upon that credit report, Sal made inquiries to\n\nAdam Wolf to find a collateral-based lender, and Adam recommended his father. Sal\n\nmet with Wolf, who told him that Zippershtein would be interested in making such a\n\nloan. Sal testified that he was present in December 2003 when Wolf met with Gambino\n\nand when Gambino authorized Sal to act on his behalf.\n\n       Koonce also testified in defendants’ case-in-chief and testified that he never told\n\nanyone he represented Gambino. He testified that he had no knowledge that the trustee’s\n\ndeeds may have been forged. Koonce identified the back real estate taxes owed on\n\nseveral of the subject properties, insurance certificates regarding the properties and\n\nvarious payments he made regarding the Lavergne Property.\n\n       The trial court ruled that although Gambino had died during the course of his\n\ndiscovery deposition and had not signed the transcript of his deposition or been afforded\n\nan opportunity to examine the transcript to make corrections, sections of his deposition\n\nwould be admitted into evidence, not as binding judicial admissions, but as evidentiary\n\nadmissions by a party opponent. These admissions were then read into the record.\n\n       At his discovery deposition, Gambino admitted to having North Star execute\n\ntrustee’s deeds conveying legal title to him, but that he later had those deeds cancelled.\n\nGambino admitted receiving two checks for $10,000 each on January 8, 2003, and\n\nJanuary 28, 2003, from Sal. He also admitted receiving a check for $42,586.09, but\n\nclaimed that Sal requested a check from him for $24,067.48 in return. He also admitted\n\n                                             32\n\freceiving cash from Sal or Enzo on two occasions; one for $5,000, and another for\n\n$2,000. Further, he admitted to accompanying the appraiser through the Niles Property\n\nduring the late 2002 appraisal.\n\n        Stephen Wolf testified in defendants’ case-in-chief that he became involved in the\n\ntransactions at issue through his son, Adam. At that time, he shared an office with\n\nZippershtein. He testified that he had a meeting with Gambino and Zippershtein\n\nimmediately before the first transaction concerning the Niles Property and received a fee,\n\nand then another fee concerning the Kedzie Property. He never became aware of any\n\nclaim that Gambino’s signature was forged.\n\n        In December 2003, Sal approached Wolf requesting a loan secured by the Kedzie\n\nProperty. Wolf made arrangements with Plaza for funding that transaction, and prior to\n\nclosing, met with Gambino. As part of that transaction, an option was given to Koonce\n\nto acquire the property by repaying the interest, fees and principal balance of WW\n\nFunding’s loan. The option was given to Koonce, not Gambino, because Koonce was\n\ncreditworthy. Sal told him that Gambino had no problem with the arrangement.\n\n                                4. The Trial Court’s Findings\n\n        The trial court rendered its “Findings of Fact and Judgment after Trial” in a 21-\n\npage written memorandum opinion and order. The trial court found in favor of plaintiffs\n\non all counts of plaintiffs’ complaint to quiet title and for slander of title.\n\n        The trial court found that plaintiffs’ evidence was overwhelming that the\n\npurported trustee’s deeds conveying title to the subject properties were forged, which\n\nevidence included the testimony of Castillo and Robinson that they had not signed the\n\ntrustee’s deeds used to effectuate the disputed conveyances, and the testimony of Brophy,\n\n                                               33\n\fwho admitted to notarizing the trustee’s deeds, as well as approximately 40 other\n\ndocuments used to accomplish the disputed conveyances, at the request of Sal without\n\nseeing the signatories or recognizing the signatories’ signatures. The trial court also\n\nfound the expert testimony of Marsh “extremely credible, thoroughly articulated, and\n\nwell-supported.” The trial court found that defendants offered no evidence to refute this\n\ntestimony. Further, the trial court discounted Sal’s testimony, including the portions\n\nrelated to Gambino signing the disputed documents, finding it to “be zero in all respects.”\n\n        Further, the trial court found that by their acts Sal, Enzo, Koonce, Boulevard,\n\nTitle America, Wolf, and WW Funding had slandered plaintiffs’ title to the Kedzie and\n\nNiles Properties. With respect to the Lavergne Property, the trial court found that by\n\ntheir acts Sal, Enzo, Koonce, Boulevard, and Title America had slandered plaintiffs’ title.\n\nIn its order, the trial court deferred its findings as to compensatory damages until a later\n\ndate and ordered plaintiffs’ attorneys to submit a fee petition. The trial court did assess\n\npunitive damages in the following amounts on November 30, 2007: the trial court\n\nimposed punitive damages against Enzo, Sal, and the Koonce defendants, jointly and\n\nseverally, in the amount of $500,000, and against Wolf and WW Funding, jointly and\n\nseverally, in the amount of $175,000.\n\n        On May 2, 2008, the trial court issued a seven-page memorandum opinion and\n\norder where it awarded compensatory damages to plaintiffs.5 In its memorandum opinion\n\nand order, the trial court described plaintiffs’ petition for attorney fees. The trial court\n\nindicated that the suit was brought when Gambino was still alive. Link was the attorney\n\n        5\n            The trial court’s May 2, 2008, order also denied two Illinois Supreme Court Rule\n\n137 petitions for sanctions. 155 Ill. 2d R. 137.\n\n                                              34\n\fengaged for the lawsuit. He drafted the originally filed complaint and a motion for\n\ntemporary restraining order. The fee arrangement between Link and Gambino was set at\n\nan hourly rate of $185. Link submitted a copy of his billings for the period of March 1,\n\n2005, to March 15, 2005, totaling $7,085.\n\n       Shortly after the filing of the lawsuit, Gambino engaged additional counsel, Sam\n\nAmirante. On March 22, 2005, Gambino agreed to a $10,000 retainer and a contingency\n\nfee of one-third of any recovery. Link and Amirante withdrew their appearances on\n\nMarch 31, 2006. Arimante accepted the $10,000 and made no further claim for fees.\n\n       On March 31, 2006, Gambino engaged new counsel. New counsel were attorneys\n\nMichael Braun, Sherwin Winer, and Kevin O’Rouke. Initially, all three attorneys billed\n\nmonthly at an hourly rate. Within a short time, however, Gambino was unable to keep\n\ncurrent in paying his attorney fees. Counsel were unwilling to continue working on an\n\nhourly basis when their bills were not being paid and would not agree to deferring\n\npayment until the conclusion of the case. It was agreed that while billing would continue\n\non an hourly basis, all amounts unpaid would be treated under a contingency fee\n\nagreement. Specifically, all unpaid hourly fees would be paid at three times the amount\n\nbilled if and when the case reached successful conclusion. Costs were to be treated in the\n\nsame manner. The attorneys’ billings were attached to the fee petition. Braun billed at\n\n$205 per hour; Winer at $250 per hour; and O’Rouke at $150 per hour for out-of-court\n\ntime and $200 per hour for in-court time. A total of $187,196 in bills was unpaid and\n\nthus subject to the contingency enhancement.\n\n       The Koonce defendants and the Wolf defendants both objected to plaintiffs’\n\npetition for attorney fees. Both sets of defendants argued that no Illinois authority\n\n                                             35\n\fallowed the multiplier of three to be applied to the lodestar amount. Further, the Wolf\n\ndefendants argued that the petition failed to properly segregate the attorneys’ billings for\n\nplaintiff’s claims to quiet title and plaintiffs’ claims for slander of title. They argued that\n\nonly plaintiffs’ attorney fees incurred in quieting title were recoverable.\n\n        The trial court first rejected the Wolf defendants’ argument that only plaintiffs’\n\nattorney fees incurred for plaintiffs’ quiet title claims were compensable, finding that\n\nplaintiffs’ claims to quiet title and for slander of title were inextricably linked. The trial\n\ncourt then addressed the reasonableness of the attorney fees exclusive of the multiplier,\n\nand found that the attorneys’ hourly rates were reasonable. The trial court found all\n\nitemizations sufficiently detailed, noting its own familiarity with the entire context of the\n\ntrial court proceedings. The trial court found the time billed for each item appropriate,\n\nrecognizing the difficulties presented by the multidefendant, multiproperty case and the\n\nexpertise of plaintiffs’ counsel.\n\n        Finally, the trial court rejected defendants’ objections to the use of a multiplier of\n\nthree times the lodestar, finding that the measure was “imminently reasonable.” The trial\n\ncourt found that the hourly rates were modest and that the attorneys’ itemized time\n\nappropriate. Further, the trial court found that the fee was proportionate to the value of\n\nthe properties at issue, roughly $2.5 million.\n\n        Noting that the Wolf defendants had no involvement with respect to the contested\n\ntransactions related to the Lavergne Property, the trial court segregated the attorney fees\n\nincurred with respect to the Lavergne Property from the remainder of the petition and\n\nawarded the following accordingly: attorney fees in the form of compensatory damages\n\nin the amount of $595,574 on counts IV and VI of plaintiffs’ complaint, such damages\n\n                                              36\n\fimposed jointly and severally against Sal, Enzo, and the Koonce defendants; attorney\n\nfees in the form of compensatory damages in the amount of $556,485 on counts IV and\n\nVI on plaintiffs’ complaint, such damages imposed jointly and severally against Wolf\n\nand WW Funding; and attorney fees in the form of compensatory damages in the amount\n\nof $595,574 on count II of plaintiffs’ complaint, imposed jointly and severally against\n\nSal, Enzo, and the Koonce defendants. The court found that plaintiffs were to have only\n\none recovery of compensatory damages, and the judgments entered were not cumulative.\n\n                                   5. Notices of Appeal\n\n       As noted, multiple appeals were taken from the trial court’s November 30, 2007,\n\nand May 2, 2008, orders. The appeals were consolidated on this court’s own motion.\n\n       Sal and Enzo filed a timely notice of appeal, but have failed to file a brief with\n\nthis court. The Koonce defendants have appealed from both the November 30, 2007, and\n\nMay 2, 2008, orders and the judgments entered against them. The Koonce defendants\n\nraise no arguments with regard to the trial court’s finding against them on their\n\ncounterclaims, and as a result all arguments concerning their counterclaims are waived.\n\n210 Ill. 2d R. 341(h)(7). Wolf and WW Funding have appealed from both the November\n\n30, 2007, and May 2, 2008, orders and the judgments entered against them. Although\n\nWW Funding filed a notice of appeal from the trial court’s November 30, 2007, order,\n\nwhere the trial court found against its counterclaim to quiet title to the Kedzie and Niles\n\nproperties, WW Funding raises no argument with respect to those findings. Further, as\n\nnoted, at oral argument before this court, WW Funding explicitly waived any claims to\n\nquiet title to the Kedzie and Niles Properties. As such, any argument concerning its\n\ncounterclaim is waived. 210 Ill. 2d R. 341(h)(7). Plaza Bank has appealed the trial\n\n                                             37\n\fcourt’s judgment with respect to its finding to quiet title to the Niles Property.\n\nWashington Mutual (Washington Mutual did not file a notice of appeal from the trial\n\ncourt’s quiet title findings) and Plaza Bank filed a notice of appeal from the trial court’s\n\ndenial of their Rule 137 motion for sanctions. Plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal from the\n\ntrial court’s denial of their Rule 137 motion for sanctions.\n\n                                         ANALYSIS\n\n        On appeal, the defendants, collectively, raise a myriad of arguments with respect\n\nto the trial court’s findings. The Koonce defendants (Koonce, Boulevard, and Title\n\nAmerica) attack the trial court’s findings with respect to plaintiffs’ claims for quiet title\n\nand slander of title, and the trial court’s assessment of damages against them, including\n\nits assessment of compensatory damages for plaintiffs’ attorney fees and its assessment\n\nof punitive damages. The Wolf defendants (Wolf and WW Funding) only raise\n\narguments with respect to the trial court’s slander of title findings and its assessment of\n\ndamages against them, including its assessment of compensatory damages for plaintiffs’\n\nattorney fees and its assessment of punitive damages. Plaza Bank’s arguments on appeal\n\nconcern only the trial court’s findings with respect to plaintiffs’ claim to quiet title to the\n\nNiles Property.\n\n                                   1. Standards of Review\n\n        A trial court’s decision following a bench trial is reviewed to determine if the\n\njudgment is against the manifest weight of the evidence. Smith, Allen, Mendenhall,\n\nEmons & Selby v. Thomson Corp., 371 Ill. App. 3d 556, 558 (2006). A judgment is not\n\nagainst the manifest weight of the of the evidence unless the opposite conclusion is\n\n\n\n                                              38\n\fclearly evident. Ikari v. Mason Properties, 314 Ill. App. 3d 222, 228 (2000), citing\n\nJordan v. National Steel Corp., 183 Ill. 2d 448, 456 (1998).\n\n          A trial court’s decision awarding attorney fees is reviewed under the abuse of\n\ndiscretion standard. Mirar Development, Inc. v. Kroner, 308 Ill. App. 3d 483, 485\n\n(1999). “A trial court does not abuse its discretion unless, in view of all the\n\ncircumstances, its decision so exceeded the bounds of reason that no person would take\n\nthe view adopted by the trial court.” In re Marriage of Demar, 385 Ill. App. 3d 837, 852\n\n(2008).\n\n          On appeal from a bench trial, the question of whether punitive damages are\n\navailable as a matter of law for a cause of action is reviewed de novo. Franz v. Calaco\n\nDevelopment Corp., 352 Ill. App. 3d 1129, 1138 (2004). The question of whether the\n\nfacts prove willfulness or other aggravating factors justifying the imposition of punitive\n\ndamages is a factual determination that is reviewed using the manifest-weight standard.\n\nFranz, 352 Ill. App. 3d at 1137-38. The trial court’s decision to award punitive damages\n\nis reviewed for an abuse of discretion. Franz, 352 Ill. App. 3d at 1138.\n\n                                          2. Quiet Title\n\n          We begin with the trial court’s findings with respect to plaintiffs’ quiet title\n\nclaims. As noted, counts I, III, and V, of plaintiffs’ complaint sought to quiet title to the\n\nsubject properties. On November 30, 2007, the trial court found in favor of the plaintiffs\n\non those counts based on its finding that the evidence at trial showed “overwhelming[ly]”\n\nthat the written instruments used to convey title to the subject properties from plaintiffs\n\nwere forgeries.\n\n\n\n                                                39\n\f        An action to quiet title in property is an equitable proceeding in which a party\n\nseeks to remove a cloud on his title to the property. Stahelin v. Forest Preserve District\n\nof Du Page County, 376 Ill. App. 3d 765 (2007). A cloud on title is the semblance of\n\ntitle, either legal or equitable, appearing in some legal form but which is, in fact,\n\nunfounded or which it would be inequitable to enforce. Lakeview Trust & Savings Bank\n\nv. Estrada, 134 Ill. App. 3d 792, 812 (1985). “Various forms of documents which\n\nappeared valid on their face have been held to constitute clouds on title.” Lakeview Trust\n\n& Savings Bank, 134 Ill. App. 3d at 812, citing Johnston v. Masterson, 397 Ill. 168, 172\n\n(1947) (subsequent deed to second grantee), Johnson v. Riedler, 395 Ill. 412, 417 (1946)\n\n(recorded mortgage), and Oswald v. Newbanks, 336 Ill. 490, 496 (1929) (forged deed).\n\n        “ ‘It is a fundamental requirement in an action to quiet title or in an action to\n\nremove a cloud from a title that the plaintiff must recover on the strength of his own title,\n\nalthough it is not required that a perfect title be established.’ ” Lakeview Trust & Savings\n\nBank, 134 Ill. App. 3d at 812, quoting Reynolds v. Burns, 20 Ill. 2d 179, 193 (1960).\n\nThus, a plaintiff cannot claim that there is a cloud on his title, unless he actually has title.\n\nLakeview Trust & Savings Bank, 134 Ill. App. 3d at 812, citing Ford v. Witwer, 383 Ill.\n\n511, 514 (1943); Klingel v. Kehrer, 81 Ill. App. 3d 431, 439 (1980); Aebischer v. Zobrist,\n\n56 Ill. App. 3d 151, 154 (1977).\n\n        “The essential elements of a forgery are (1) a false writing or alteration of some\n\ninstrument in writing; (2) the instrument must be apparently capable of defrauding; and\n\n(3) there must be an intent to defraud.” In re Estate of Bontkowski, 337 Ill. App. 3d 72,\n\n76 (2003), citing Haffa v. Haffa, 115 Ill. App. 2d 467 (1969). The validity of signatures\n\non a deed of conveyance can be overcome only by clear and convincing evidence from\n\n                                               40\n\fdisinterested witnesses. Estate of Bontkowski, 337 Ill. App. 3d at 76, citing Witt v.\n\nPanek, 408 Ill. 328 (1951); Resolution Trust Corp. v. Hardisty, 269 Ill. App. 3d 613\n\n(1995).\n\n          A trial court’s determination as to these matters will not be disturbed unless it is\n\nagainst the manifest weight of the evidence. Estate of Bontkowski, 337 Ill. App. 3d at 76,\n\nciting Resolution Trust Corp., 269 Ill. App. 3d at 617. A trial court’s finding is against\n\nthe manifest weight of the evidence only if the opposite conclusion is clearly evident.\n\nIkari v. Mason Properties, 314 Ill. App. 3d 222, 228 (2000), citing Jordan v. National\n\nSteel Corp., 183 Ill. 2d 448, 456 (1998).\n\n          With regard to the trial court’s findings as to plaintiffs’ claims to quiet title, the\n\nKoonce defendants first argue that the validity of North Star’s title to the subject\n\nproperties was never established. They argue that no evidence was presented as to the\n\ntitle of the subject properties “at any time, before or after the transfers,” and that the trial\n\ncourt’s quiet title findings should be reversed on this basis alone. This argument is not\n\npersuasive.\n\n          First, the Koonce defendants’ counterclaim verified by the sworn affidavit of\n\nKoonce alleged that “North Star *** held title to the [subject] properties in trust, with\n\nGambino as the beneficiary.” This binding judicial admission removed the question of\n\nthe validity of North Star’s title to the subject properties from contention. Winnetka Bank\n\nv. Mandas, 202 Ill. App. 3d 373, 396 (1990). Second, the evidence at trial establishing\n\nthe validity of North Star’s title to the subject properties was uncontroverted. Castillo,\n\nNorth Star’s trust officer, testified that Gambino was the sole beneficiary of three land\n\n\n\n                                                 41\n\ftrusts holding legal title to the subject properties under trust agreements Nos. 13534,\n\n23985, and 23994, until the time of his death.\n\n       The Koonce defendants then argue that the alleged clouds on title to the subject\n\nproperties and the alleged forgery of the trustee’s deeds to the subject properties were\n\nnever proven.\n\n       A cloud on title is the semblance of title, either legal or equitable, appearing in\n\nsome legal form but which is, in fact, unfounded or which it would be inequitable to\n\nenforce. Lakeview Trust & Savings Bank v. Estrada, 134 Ill. App. 3d 792, 812 (1985). It\n\nis undisputed that the questioned trustee’s deeds conveying legal title out of trust were\n\nrecorded against the subject properties, along with other legal documents used to convey\n\ntitle to the subject properties and procure loans using the subject properties as security.\n\nFurther, mortgage liens were recorded against all three of the subject properties. The\n\nKoonce defendants argue that the trustee’s deeds conveying title to the subject properties\n\nout of trust were improperly admitted into evidence. However, a review of the record\n\ndemonstrates that the trustee’s deeds were admitted into evidence without objection. See\n\nIn re Stephen K., 373 Ill. App. 3d 7, 22 (2007) (waiver).\n\n       The Koonce defendants then argue that the trial court’s finding that the evidence\n\nthat the purported trustee’s deeds conveying legal title to the subject properties, and other\n\nlegal documents used in the contested transactions, were forged, was against the manifest\n\nweight of the evidence. Estate of Bontkowski, 337 Ill. App. 3d at 76 (a trial court’s\n\nfinding of forgery is reviewed under the manifest-weight standard).\n\n       The bank officers whose signatures purportedly appear on the trustee’s deeds\n\ntestified that they did not sign the deeds and that the signatures purporting to be theirs\n\n                                             42\n\fwere not. The notary whose seal and signature appears on the trustee’s deeds also\n\ntestified to notarizing the trustee’s deeds, as well as approximately 40 other legal\n\ndocuments, each at the request of Sal, without seeing the signatories, knowing the\n\nsignatories, or having any familiarity with the signatories’ signatures. The notary further\n\nadmitted to notarizing the purported signature of Gambino contained on the deeds to the\n\nNiles and Kedzie Properties conveying title to WW Funding and Century, respectively, at\n\nSal’s request, without seeing Gambino, knowing his signature, or having any familiarity\n\nwith his signature.\n\n       Further, Marsh, plaintiffs’ handwriting expert and a disinterested witness, opined\n\nthat the signatures contained on a series of contested documents purporting to be that of\n\nGambino, including the deeds conveying title to the Niles and Kedzie Properties to WW\n\nFunding and Century, were not Gambino’s.\n\n       Despite the foregoing, the Koonce defendants argue that the trial court’s finding\n\nas to forgery was against the manifest weight of the evidence because the trial court\n\nfailed to make a specific finding of an intent to defraud. Estate of Bontkowski, 337 Ill.\n\nApp. 3d at 76. A reviewing court may affirm the trial court’s judgment on any basis\n\nwhich appears in the record, regardless of the basis relied upon by the circuit court.\n\nEstate of Bontkowski, 337 Ill. App. 3d at 78. “ ‘The real issue on appeal is not the\n\nreasoning of the [trial] court nor the basis for its decree, but whether its decree was\n\ncorrect.’ ” Estate of Bontkowski, 337 Il. App. 3d at 78, quoting La Salle National Bank v.\n\nInternational Ltd., 129 Ill. App. 2d 381, 390-91 (1970). Again, a trial court’s findings as\n\nto the elements of forgery, including the determination of an intent to defraud, are\n\n\n\n                                             43\n\freviewed under the manifest-weight standard. Estate of Bontkowski, 337 Ill. App. 3d at\n\n78.\n\n       In the present case, there was ample evidence of the Koonce defendants’ intent to\n\ndefraud by the use of the forged documents. The Koonce defendants, relying on the\n\ntestimony of Sal, argue that Gambino signed the contested documents in Sal’s presence.\n\nFirst, we note that the trial court found Sal’s credibility to be “zero” in all respects. The\n\ndetermination of witnesses’ credibility is a matter for the trier of fact and will not be\n\nsecond-guessed on appeal. Franz, 352 Ill. App. 3d at 1144. Plaintiffs’ expert, who was\n\nnot contradicted at trial, opined that Gambino did not sign the contested documents. The\n\ntrial court found the contested documents were signed by someone other than Gambino\n\nfor the advantage of several defendants in the case at bar, including Sal, which illustrates\n\nan intent to defraud. “Intent to defraud is a question of fact, which may be proved by\n\ncircumstantial evidence and inferred from the facts and circumstances surrounding the\n\ntransaction.” People v. Aguilar, 366 Ill. App. 3d 341, 344 (2006).\n\n       Here, the settlement documents on the subject properties provide direct and\n\ncircumstantial evidence of fraud. The Niles Property alone had $25,000 in commitment\n\nfees distributed to the Wolfs and Zippershtien, a mortgage escrow of $33,000 which is\n\nunusual, a $5,000 appraisal fee, and a payment to Sal of $25,000 that is questionable on\n\nits face. The Kedzie settlement disbursements reveal commitment or loan fees of\n\n$18,750, a $25,000 payment to “Norman Trust Account,” and $5,372.72 to a law firm not\n\ninvolved in the process, and over $50,000 to unknown people (Halle, Guillermo, and\n\nPapiese) and only $10,000 to Gambino, which should have indicated to the Koonce\n\ndefendants that an explanation was in order. The disbursements on the Lavergne\n\n                                              44\n\fProperty were just as bizarre with no funds going to Gambino and $120,000 to Enzo,\n\nwith loan fees over $7,000, and an unexplained disbursement to Harris Bank for $10,000.\n\n       The case of In re Estate of Bontkowski, 337 Ill. App. 3d 72 (2003), is instructive\n\nhere. In that case, the proof of an alleged forged deed was found sufficiently established\n\nby testimony of a handwriting expert that the signatures on a deed were not those of the\n\ndecedent and by testimony of a notary who affixed her signature and notary seal to the\n\ndeed. Like this case, in In re Estate of Bontkowski, the notary admitted that someone\n\nother than the signatory had given her the deed to notarize, that the signatory was not\n\npresent when she notarized the deeds, that she had never met the signatory, and that she\n\ndid not know the purported signatory’s signature. Based on that evidence, the appellate\n\ncourt affirmed the trial court’s findings that the elements of forgery had been met,\n\nincluding intent to defraud. In re Estate of Bontkowski, 337 Ill. App. 3d at 77.\n\n       Like In re Estate of Bontkowski, the trial court’s finding in the case at bar that the\n\nsignatures, the trustee’s deeds, the deeds conveying the Kedzie and Niles Properties from\n\nGambino to WW Funding and Century, and other documents used in the contested\n\ntransactions were forged was not against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n\n       The Koonce defendants then argue that Gambino authorized and/or ratified the\n\ntransactions.\n\n       An agent’s authority may be actual or apparent and, if actual, may be express or\n\nimplied. Granite Properties Limited Partnership v. Granite Investment Co., 220 Ill. App.\n\n3d 711, 713-14 (1991). Apparent authority is cognizable when a principal, through\n\nwords or conduct, creates the reasonable impression in a third party that his agent is\n\nauthorized to perform a certain act on his behalf. To prove the existence of apparent\n\n                                             45\n\fauthority, a party must establish that: (1) the principal consented to or knowingly\n\nacquiesced in the agent’s exercise of authority; (2) the third party, based upon his\n\nknowledge of the facts, possessed a good-faith belief that the agent possessed such\n\nauthority; and (3) the third party relied to his detriment on the agent’s apparent authority.\n\nWeil, Freiburg & Thomas, P.C. v. Sara Lee Corp., 218 Ill. App. 3d 383, 390 (1991). The\n\nparty alleging an agency relationship must prove it by a preponderance of the evidence.\n\nGranite Properties Limited Partnership, 220 Ill. App. 3d at 714.\n\n       “Ratification occurs when the principal learns of an unauthorized transaction,\n\nthen retains the benefits of the transaction or takes a position inconsistent with\n\nnonaffirmation.” Stathis v. Geldermann, Inc., 295 Ill. App. 3d 844, 858 (1998), citing\n\nProgress Printing Corp. v. Jane Byrne Political Committee, 235 Ill. App. 3d 292, 310\n\n(1992). “For ratification to occur, the principal must, with full knowledge of the act,\n\nmanifest an intent to abide and be bound by the transaction.” Stathis, 295 Ill. App. 3d at\n\n858, citing Peskin v. Deutsch, 134 Ill. App. 3d 48, 55 (1985). “Ratification may be\n\ninferred from surrounding circumstances, including long-term acquiescence, after notice,\n\nto the benefits of an allegedly unauthorized transaction.” Stathis, 295 Ill. App. 3d at 858,\n\nciting Progress Printing Corp., 235 Ill. App. 3d at 310.\n\n       The Koonce defendants argue that the fact that Gambino executed three written\n\ndirections to convey and requested trustee’s deeds from North Star “gave Gambino the\n\nopportunity to create fraudulent deeds himself, which he ultimately delivered to Sal to be\n\nrecorded.” The Koonce defendants argue that Gambino had possession of the trustee’s\n\ndeeds for approximately a month before returning them to North Star giving Gambino, or\n\nSal with Gambino’s “encouragement and authorization,” an opportunity to prepare the\n\n                                             46\n\ffraudulent deeds. The Koonce defendants also point out that the trustee’s deeds that\n\nGambino did indeed request from North Star and the contested trustee’s deeds are mirror\n\nimages. They reason that this fact proves that Gambino provided and encouraged Sal\n\nwith the opportunity to forge the questioned trustee’s deeds. Again, when we analyze the\n\nsettlement documents on the subject properties, the disbursements appear to be tainted\n\nwith fraud. The Niles Property alone had $25,000 in commitment fees distributed to the\n\nWolfs and Zippershtein, a mortgage escrow of $33,000, which is unusual, a $5,000\n\nappraisal fee, and a payment to Sal of $25,000 that is questionable on its face. The\n\nKedzie settlement disbursements reveal commitment or loan fees of $18,750, a $25,000\n\npayment to “Norman Trust Account,” and $5,372.72 to a law firm not involved in the\n\nprocess, and over $50,000 to unknown people (Halle, Guillermo, and Papiese) and only\n\n$10,000 to Gambino, which should have indicated to the Koonce defendants that an\n\nexplanation was in order. The disbursements on the Lavergne Property, again, were just\n\nas bizarre with no funds going to Gambino and $120,000 to Enzo, with loan fees over\n\n$7,000, and an unexplained disbursement to Harris Bank for $10,000.\n\n       The Koonce defendant’s argument to the trial court was that Gambino was the\n\none who committed the fraud based on the fact that he may have shown the trustee’s\n\ndeeds from North Star to Sal. The trial court found that this “prove[d] nothing except\n\nthat by having in his possession such a deed *** Gambino provided [Sal, Enzo] and\n\nKoonce with the tools of their fraud.”\n\n       There was no credible evidence at trial to prove that Gambino authorized and/or\n\nratified the contested transactions. The Koonce defendants argue that Gambino received\n\nhundreds of thousands of dollars from the disputed transactions in cash, checks, and the\n\n                                            47\n\fpayment of bills and loans. They point out that Gambino told Thomas Gambino that he\n\nhad authorized Sal and Enzo to procure a loan on one of his properties. Further, they\n\npoint out that overdue real estate taxes were paid on the subject properties from the\n\nclosings. Further, they argue that Gambino’s response to the Zippershtein foreclosure\n\naction showed that Gambino ratified the transactions. They argue that Gambino, after\n\nbeing served with the foreclosure complaint, never filed a motion to dismiss or strike the\n\nforeclosure action, but simply allowed the mortgage to be paid.\n\n       First, the only testimony that Gambino actually received hundreds of thousands of\n\ndollars from the disputed transactions was the testimony of Sal and Enzo, which the trial\n\ncourt found to be not credible. Koonce testified that he signed numerous checks payable\n\nto Sal and Enzo for what he believed were loans to Gambino. Yet, Koonce, a lawyer and\n\nsophisticated real estate investor, never discussed the matter with Gambino or obtained\n\nany receipts of the moneys he paid to Sal or Enzo for Gambino. Multiple payments were\n\nmade to third parties from the closings, including creditors of Sal. Deposits of large\n\namounts of moneys were made into Enzo’s bank accounts and the bank account of his\n\ngirlfriend, which Enzo testified was converted to cash and given to Gambino, but no\n\ndocumentary evidence showed that Gambino actually received these moneys.\n\n       Second, the fact that Gambino approached Sal about procuring a loan on one of\n\nthe subject properties was admitted by plaintiffs in their complaint at the outset; what\n\nwas contested was the transactions that conveyed the subject properties from Gambino to\n\nseveral defendants for pennies on the dollar. Further, the fact that overdue real estate\n\ntaxes were paid from the closings does not prove that Gambino ratified the transactions\n\nor that the taxes were paid for his benefit. Rather, the evidence at trial shows that the\n\n                                             48\n\foverdue real estate taxes were paid for the benefit of several of the defendants in the case\n\nto clear title to the properties. Finally, the events surrounding the Zippershtein\n\nforeclosure action does not undercut the trial court’s finding that Gambino did not ratify\n\nthe contested transactions. Upon receiving a letter demanding payment of the\n\nZippershtien mortgage, Gambino denied any knowledge with regard to the loan. When\n\nsuit was filed, he appeared to defend until that suit was voluntarily dismissed by\n\nZippershtein. These arguments cannot serve as a basis for reversing the trial court’s\n\nfindings.\n\n       We now address the arguments of Plaza Bank. Plaza Bank’s arguments on appeal\n\nsolely concern the trial court’s order voiding its mortgage lien on the Niles Property.\n\nPlaza Bank argues that the trial court’s findings with regard to plaintiffs’ claim to quiet\n\ntitle to the Niles Property were against the manifest weight of the evidence. Smith, Allen,\n\nMendenhall, Emons & Selby v. Thomson Corp., 371 Ill. App. 3d 556, 558 (2006) (trial\n\ncourt’s decision following a bench trial is reviewed to determine if the judgment is\n\nagainst the manifest weight of the evidence). Plaza Bank argues that the evidence\n\npresented coupled with plaintiffs’ judicial admissions establishes that Gambino was\n\naware of and participated in the Niles mortgage.\n\n       Plaza Bank first argues that Sal and Enzo were Gambino’s agents. In this regard,\n\nPlaza Bank argues that Gambino engaged Sal and Enzo to procure a loan on one of his\n\nproperties, authorized Sal to obtain his credit report, and authorized Pritikin to speak with\n\nSal regarding the procurement of a loan to settle his liability with the IRS. The trial court\n\nfound in its November 30, 2007, order that “there was no proof of any statement or\n\nconduct by Gambino that encouraged or led these defendants or anyone else to produce\n\n                                             49\n\fthese forged and falsely notarized documents purportedly transferring title, to [his]\n\ndetriment.” The judgment of the trial court cannot be reversed on this basis.\n\n       Plaza Bank then argues that Gambino ratified the Niles transaction. As noted,\n\nratification occurs when the principal learns of an unauthorized transaction, then retains\n\nthe benefits of the transaction or takes a position inconsistent with nonaffirmation.\n\nStathis, 295 Ill. App. 3d at 858, citing Progress Printing Corp. v. Jane Byrne Political\n\nCommittee, 235 Ill. App. 3d 292, 310 (1992).\n\n       Plaza Bank points to the fact that Gambino directed North Star to convey legal\n\ntitle to the Niles Property to him 10 days before the Zippershtein mortgage was procured\n\non the property. Plaza Bank argues that Gambino received moneys from the first closing\n\nrelated to the Niles Property and also points out that Gambino told Thomas Gambino that\n\nhe had authorized Sal and Enzo to procure a loan on one of his properties. Further, Plaza\n\nBank points out that overdue real estate taxes were paid on the subject properties from\n\nthe closings. Further, Plaza Bank argues that Gambino’s response to the Zippershtein\n\nforeclosure action showed that Gambino ratified the transactions. Plaza Bank argues that\n\nGambino, after being served with the foreclosure complaint, never filed a motion to\n\ndismiss or strike the foreclosure action, but simply allowed the mortgage to be paid.\n\n       Again, the fact that Gambino approached Sal about the possibility of procuring a\n\nloan on one of the subject properties was admitted by plaintiffs in their complaint at the\n\noutset; what was contested was the transactions that conveyed the subject properties from\n\nGambino to several defendants by the use of fraudulent, forged legal documents\n\nincluding forged deeds. Further, the fact that overdue real estate taxes were paid from\n\nthe closings does not prove that Gambino ratified the transactions or that the taxes were\n\n                                             50\n\fpaid for his benefit. Rather, the evidence at trial shows that the overdue real estate taxes\n\nwere paid for the benefit of several of the defendants who needed to have clear title.\n\nFinally, the events surrounding the Zippershtein foreclosure action does not undercut the\n\ntrial court’s finding that Gambino did not ratify the contested transactions. Upon\n\nreceiving a letter demanding payment of the Zippershtien mortgage, Gambino denied any\n\nknowledge of the loan. When suit was filed, he hired a lawyer to defend until that suit\n\nwas voluntarily dismissed. Like the Koonce defendants’ arguments, Plaza Bank’s\n\narguments are not persuasive.\n\n        Plaza Bank also argues that Gambino is judicially estopped from denying the\n\nNiles transaction, because of his involvement in the Zippershtein foreclosure suit. The\n\ndoctrine of judicial estoppel postulates that “ ‘a party who assumes a particular position\n\nin a legal proceeding is estopped from assuming a contrary position in a subsequent legal\n\nproceeding.’ ” Barack Ferrazzano Kirschbaum Perlman & Nagelberg v. Loffredi, 342\n\nIll. App. 3d 453, 460 (2003), quoting Bidani v. Lewis, 285 Ill. App. 3d 545, 550 (1996).\n\nThe purpose of the doctrine is “ ‘to promote the truth and to protect the integrity of the\n\ncourt system by preventing litigants from deliberately shifting positions to suit the\n\nexigencies of the moment.’ ” Loffredi, 342 Ill. App. 3d at 460, quoting Bidani, 285 Ill.\n\nApp. 3d at 550. The five elements necessary for the application of judicial estoppel\n\ninclude the following: “ ‘the party to be estopped must have (1) taken two positions, (2)\n\nthat are factually inconsistent, (3) in separate judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings, (4)\n\nintended for the trier of fact to accept the truth of the facts alleged, and (5) have\n\nsucceeded in the first proceeding and received some benefit from it.’ ” Loffredi, 342 Ill.\n\nApp. 3d at 460, quoting People v. Caballero, 206 Ill. 2d 65, 80 (2002).\n\n                                              51\n\f       In the case at bar, the elements of judicial estoppel have not been met. Gambino\n\ndid not take a position in the case at bar factually inconsistent with his position in the\n\nZippershtein foreclosure action. In both actions, he contested the validity of the\n\nZippershtein mortage. When the foreclosure action was filed, Gambino retained a lawyer\n\nto defend the case. It was Zippershtein who voluntarily dismissed that suit.\n\n       Plaza Bank then argues that Gambino had unclean hands. It is a basic maxim of\n\nequity that he who seeks equity must do equity. Long v. Kemper Life Insurance Co., 196\n\nIll. App. 3d 216, 218 (1990). The doctrine of “unclean hands” precludes a party from\n\ntaking advantage of his own wrong. Long, 196 Ill. App. 3d at 219, citing State Bank of\n\nGeneva v. Sorenson, 167 Ill. App. 3d 674, 680 (1988). It is an equitable doctrine that\n\nbars relief when the party seeking that relief is guilty of misconduct in connection with\n\nthe subject matter of the litigation. Thomson Learning, Inc. v. Olympia Properties, LLC,\n\n365 Ill. App. 3d 621, 634 (2006), citing Wolfram Partnership, Ltd. v. LaSalle National\n\nBank, 328 Ill. App. 3d 207, 221-22 (2001). For the doctrine to apply, the party’s\n\nmisconduct must rise to the level of fraud or bad faith. Thomson Learning, Inc., 365 Ill.\n\nApp. 3d at 634, citing Beitner v. Marzahl, 354 Ill. App. 3d 142, 150 (2004). To\n\ndetermine whether a party acted with unclean hands, the court must look to the intent of\n\nthat party. Thomson Learning, Inc., 365 Ill. App. 3d at 634, citing Schivarelli v. Chicago\n\nTransit Authority, 355 Ill. App. 3d 93, 103 (2005). The doctrine is unavailable where the\n\nact giving rise to the defense does not directly involve the transaction which is the subject\n\nof the litigation. Cole v. Guy, 183 Ill. App. 3d 768, 776 (1989). The application of the\n\ndoctrine is a matter for the trial court’s discretion, which this court will not disturb on\n\n\n\n                                              52\n\fappeal absent an abuse of that discretion. Long, 196 Ill. App. 3d at 219, citing Fair\n\nAutomotive Repair, Inc. v. Car-X Service Systems, Inc., 128 Ill. App. 3d 763, 768 (1984).\n\n       Plaza Bank argues that Gambino lied in plaintiffs’ verified complaint when he\n\nverified the allegation that he never directed North Star to convey legal title to the subject\n\nproperties to anyone including himself. Further, Plaza Bank argues that Gambino made\n\nmisrepresentations to the IRS on the values of the subject properties. Plaza Bank’s\n\nargument cannot be used to reverse the trial court’s judgment as the actions giving rise to\n\nits “unclean hands” argument did not involve the Niles transaction. Further, since\n\nGambino returned the title documents to North Star, the trial court may have found that\n\nallegation drawn by his attorney did not rise to the level of “unclean hands,” and we\n\ncannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in its findings on that matter or on\n\nGambino’s representation to the IRS. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by not\n\napplying the “unclean hands” doctrine.\n\n       Finally, Plaza Bank argues that the trial court awarded Gambino a “windfall”\n\nwhen it ordered Plaza Bank’s mortgage lien on the Niles Property void. They claim they\n\nare entitled to a lien on the Niles Property in the amount of $335,000, for its payoff of the\n\nZippershtein mortgage, $54,000 for their payment of back real estate taxes paid on the\n\nNiles Property, and $69,000 which Plaza Bank claim Gambino received from the Niles\n\ntransactions.\n\n       Compensatory damages are those which are awarded to a person as\n\ncompensation, indemnity or restitution for a wrong or injury sustained by him. Harris v.\n\nPeters, 274 Ill. App. 3d 206, 207 (1995). The purpose of awarding compensatory\n\ndamages is to make the injured party whole and restore him to the position he was in\n\n                                              53\n\fbefore the loss, but not to enable him to make a profit or windfall on the transaction.\n\nHarris, 274 Ill. App. 3d at 207, citing Rittenhouse v. Tabor Grain Co., 203 Ill. App. 3d\n\n639, 650 (1990).\n\n          Plaza Bank’s argument is not persuasive because it never raised the issue of\n\nrestitution or its entitlement to a lien on the Niles Property in any pleading. The issues in\n\ncontroversy and the theories upon which recovery is sought are fixed by the pleadings.\n\nIMC Global v. Continental Insurance Co., 378 Ill. App. 3d 797, 804 (2007), citing\n\nKincaid v. Ames Department Stores, Inc., 283 Ill. App. 3d 555, 568 (1996). Accordingly,\n\nthe trial court lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate an issue not presented through proper\n\npleadings. William J. Templeman Co. v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., 316 Ill. App. 3d\n\n379, 388 (2000). Since Plaza Bank never raised the issue of restitution or its entitlement\n\nto a lien on the Niles Property in a pleading, we cannot say that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion in denying the relief requested.\n\n          Based on the foregoing, we affirm the trial court’s findings with respect to\n\nplaintiffs’ claims to quiet title to the subject properties.\n\n                                       2. Slander of Title\n\n          We now consider the trial court’s findings concerning plaintiffs’ slander of title\n\ncounts. As noted, plaintiffs alleged slander of title in counts II, IV, and VI of their\n\ncomplaint. Count II was pled against Sal, Enzo, and the Koonce defendants with regard\n\nto the Lavergne Property. Counts IV and VI were pled against Sal, Enzo, the Koonce\n\ndefendants, and the Wolf defendants with regard to the Niles and Kedzie Properties,\n\nrespectively. On November 30, 2007, the trial court found in favor of plaintiffs on those\n\ncounts.\n\n                                               54\n\f        The Koonce defendants and the Wolf defendants (Wolf and WW Funding) argue\n\nthat the trial court’s findings as to plaintiffs’ slander of title counts are against the\n\nmanifest weight of the evidence. A plaintiff asserting slander of title bears the burden of\n\nproving the following: (1) the defendants made a false and malicious publication, either\n\noral or written; (2) that such publication disparaged the plaintiff’s title to property; and\n\n(3) damages due to such publication. Chicago Title & Trust Co. v. Levine, 333 Ill. App.\n\n3d 420, 424 (2002), citing American National Bank & Trust Co. v. Bentley Builders, Inc.,\n\n308 Ill. App. 3d 246, 251 (1999). A plaintiff must also prove that the defendants acted\n\nwith malice. Levine, 333 Ill. App. 3d at 424, citing Bentley Builders, 308 Ill. App. 3d at\n\n252. To prove malice, the plaintiff must show that the defendants knew that the\n\ndisparaging statements were false or that the statements were made with reckless\n\ndisregard of their truth or falsity. Levine, 333 Ill. App. 3d at 424, citing Bentley Builders,\n\n308 Ill. App. 3d at 251-52. A defendant acts with reckless disregard if he publishes the\n\nallegedly damaging matter despite a high degree of awareness of its probable falsity or if\n\nhe has serious doubts as to its truth. Levine, 333 Ill. App. 3d at 424, citing Bentley\n\nBuilders, 308 Ill. App. 3d at 252.\n\n        The act of maliciously recording a document that clouds another’s title to real\n\nestate is actionable as slander of title. Bentley Builders, 308 Ill. App. 3d at 252, citing\n\nWhildin v. Kovacs, 82 Ill. App. 3d 1015, 1016 (1980). However, if the party who records\n\nthe document has reasonable grounds to believe that he has title or a claim to the\n\nproperty, he has not acted with malice. Bentley Builders, 308 Ill. App. 3d at 252, citing\n\nWhildin, 82 Ill. App. 3d at 1016. Malice is a question of fact. Bentley Builders, 308 Ill.\n\nApp. 3d at 252, Whildin, 82 Ill. App. 3d at 1016. In a bench trial, it is the function of the\n\n                                               55\n\ftrial judge to weigh the evidence and make findings of fact. Kalata v. Anheuser-Busch\n\nCos., 144 Ill. 2d 425, 433 (1991). A trial court’s findings of fact are entitled to great\n\ndeference and should not be overturned on review merely because the reviewing court\n\nmay have reached a different result. Lake County Grading Co. Of Libertyville, Inc. v.\n\nAdvance Mechanical Contractors, Inc., 275 Ill. App. 3d 452, 463-64 (1995). A trial\n\ncourt's findings of fact will only be set aside when they are against the manifest weight of\n\nthe evidence. In re Application of the County Treasurer, 131 Ill. 2d 541, 549 (1989). A\n\nfinding is against the manifest weight of the evidence when the opposite conclusion is\n\nclearly evident. Case v. Forloine, 266 Ill. App. 3d 120, 125 (1993).\n\n       The Koonce defendants first argue that plaintiffs failed to prove the element of\n\npublication. Emery v. Northeast Illinois Regional Commuter R.R. Corp., 377 Ill. app. 3d\n\n1013, 1022 (2007) (in order to prove publication, a plaintiff must show that allegedly\n\nslanderous remarks were communicated to someone other than plaintiff). The Koonce\n\ndefendants’ argument ignores the trial court’s finding that the Koonce defendants\n\nparticipated in the acts leading to the recording of all the legal documents which\n\nslandered plaintiffs’ title to the subject properties. Plaintiffs were not required to prove\n\nthat the Koonce defendants actually recorded the documents. All persons who cause or\n\nparticipate in the publication of slanderous matters are responsible for such publication.\n\nVan Horne v. Muller, 185 Ill. 2d 299, 308 (1998). At trial, Sal admitted that he\n\npersonally recorded all the deeds, including the forged trustee’s deed conveying title to\n\nthe Lavergne Property from North Star directly to Koonce. Further, mortgage liens were\n\nrecorded against the Lavergne Property due to loans applied for by Koonce as borrower.\n\nFurther, Koonce submitted his application for a loan on the Lavergne Property in April\n\n                                              56\n\f2003 through Boulevard, which received an $850 fee for “loan application and\n\nprocessing fees.” Further, Title America was the title company used for five of the six\n\nclosings which led to the recording of the legal documents slandering plaintiffs’ title to\n\nall three of the subject properties. The element of publication against the Koonce\n\ndefendants was proven.\n\n       The Koonce defendants and the Wolf defendants both argue that there was no\n\nevidence that they acted with malice. We will address the trial court’s findings with\n\nregard to the Koonce defendants first.\n\n       The trial court found that Koonce was personally involved with Sal in defrauding\n\nGambino from the outset of the events leading to this trial. At trial, Sal admitted that he\n\nrecorded all the deeds as to the subject properties. As to the Lavergne Property, he\n\nadmitted that he recorded the forged trustee’s deed conveying title from North Star\n\ndirectly to Koonce. As to the Niles Property, the trial court believed the testimony of\n\nFritzshall, Zippershtein’s attorney, that Koonce claimed he was Gambino’s attorney. At\n\ntrial, Koonce denied that he ever represented to anyone that he was Gambino’s attorney\n\nbut the trial court found his testimony not credible.\n\n       The trial court noted that Koonce “refinanced” the Lavergne Property, although\n\nhe did not own it. He submitted a loan application as a “refinance” and signed it as the\n\n“borrower.” Further, the court noted Koonce’s agreement with WW Funding to take an\n\noption to purchase the Kedzie Property, an option for which Koonce admitted he paid\n\nnothing.\n\n       Further, the trial court found that both Boulevard and Title America acted with\n\nmalice. With respect to Boulevard, the court found that Koonce and Sal used Boulevard\n\n                                             57\n\fin various ways for these transactions. Koonce used a Boulevard form to submit an\n\napplication for a $800,000 loan to Washington Mutual on the Niles and Kedzie\n\nProperties. Koonce and Sal used Boulevard to obtain a credit report for Gambino, and\n\nissued a mortgage loan commitment for Gambino from it. Koonce quitclaimed his\n\ninterest in the Lavergne Property to Boulevard.\n\n       The trial court noted that Title America, of which Koonce is the sole shareholder,\n\nwas used as the title company for five of the six contested transactions. The trial court\n\nfound that the reason for this was so scrutiny of the forged documents would remain low.\n\nTitle America accepted the forged deeds and other forged documents. Moneys were paid\n\nfrom the closings to third parties unrelated to the transactions. Large checks and wire\n\ntransfers were issued by Title America to Enzo and Sal, and to creditors of Sal.\n\n       Based on the foregoing, we cannot say that the trial court’s findings that the\n\nKoonce defendants acted with malice was against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n\n       We now address the Wolf defendants argument that the trial court’s findings that\n\nthey acted with malice was against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n\n       The Wolf defendants argue that they did not know nor should they have known\n\nthat the warranty deed WW Funding received from “Joseph J. Gambino” to the Niles\n\nProperty was forged or that the warrantee deed from “Joseph J. Gambino” to Century for\n\nthe Kedzie Property, title to which WW Funding later obtained, was forged. The Wolf\n\ndefendants argue that they, in good faith, believed that they were purchasing the Niles\n\nand Kedzie Properties by paying off the Zippershtein mortgage and the Century loan.\n\n       The trial court found that Wolf was involved with Sal’s defrauding of Gambino\n\nfrom the beginning of the events leading to trial. Sal first approached Wolf with regard\n\n                                             58\n\fto the Niles Property. Wolf referred the loan to Zippershtein, who made a $200,000 loan\n\non the Niles Property. Wolf earned a $5,250 commitment fee from that loan. His son\n\nAdam earned a $4,000 commitment fee. Both Fritzshall and Sal testified that Wolf was\n\npresent for the first closing related to the Niles Property. Wolf denied being present.\n\n       With regard to the Kedzie Property, Wolf referred the loan to Azran who made a\n\nloan through his company Century. Century loaned $200,000, taking title to the property\n\nas security for the loan, and purportedly leased the property back to Gambino; a purchase\n\noption which lapsed in a year’s time was also purportedly given to Gambino. Azran\n\ntestified that it was agreed in advance that in the event Gambino did not exercise his\n\noption to purchase, Wolf, Zippershtein, and Azran would each take a one-third ownership\n\ninterest in the property. Wolf was paid a $6,250 commitment fee for this loan. His son\n\nAdam was also paid a $6,250 loan fee for this loan. When Gambino failed to exercise\n\nthe option to purchase the Kedzie Property, it was Wolf who purchased the property\n\nthrough his company WW Funding. From this closing, WW Funding was paid a $25,000\n\ncommitment fee. As to the Niles Property, after Zippershtein filed the foreclosure suit,\n\nWW Funding purchased the property, obtaining $445,000 in financing from Plaza Bank.\n\nWW Funding held $135,171.38 from closing. Upon WW Funding’s taking title to both\n\nthe Niles and Kedzie Properties, options to purchase were granted to Koonce.\n\n       The trial court “flatly disbelieve[d]” Wolf’s testimony that he personally met with\n\nGambino and that Gambino approved the aforementioned transactions.\n\n       As to WW Funding, the trial court found that Wolf used WW Funding to\n\ncomplete the transactions in which he would finally hold title to the Niles and Kedzie\n\nProperties.\n\n                                             59\n\f       Based upon the foregoing, we cannot say that the trial court’s finding as to the\n\nWolf defendants’ malice was against the manifest weight of the evidence. We recognize\n\nthe fact that large commitment fees are sometimes earned in “hard-money” transactions\n\nlike the ones in the case at bar and that large commitment fees are not necessarily\n\nindicative of illegal transactions. However, it was the trial court’s duty to determine\n\nwhether the Wolf defendants had acted with malice in the case at bar, which it did, and\n\nbased upon the record before us we cannot determine that the opposite conclusion, that\n\nthe Wolf defendants did not act with malice in slandering plaintiffs’ title to the Kedzie\n\nand Niles Properties, was clearly evident.\n\n       Accordingly, the trial court’s findings with respect to plaintiffs’ slander of title\n\nclaims are affirmed.\n\n                                         3. Damages\n\n       The Koonce defendants and the Wolf defendants raise several arguments with\n\nregard to the trial court’s award of compensatory and punitive damages. They argue that\n\nthe trial court abused its discretion in awarding attorney fees in the amount of three times\n\nthe lodestar. They further argue that the trial court’s award of punitive damages was\n\nerror as a matter of law, against the manifest weight of the evidence, an abuse of\n\ndiscretion, and in violation of their constitutional right to due process.\n\n        We begin with the arguments with regard to the trial court’s award of attorney\n\nfees. As noted, the trial court awarded attorney fees to plaintiffs in the form of\n\ncompensatory damages: $595,574 on counts IV and VI of plaintiffs’ complaint, such\n\ndamages imposed jointly and severally against Sal, Enzo, and the Koonce defendants;\n\n$556,485 on counts IV and VI of plaintiffs’ complaint, such damages imposed jointly\n\n                                              60\n\fand severally against Wolf and WW Funding, and $595,574 on count II of plaintiffs’\n\ncomplaint, imposed jointly and severally against Sal, Enzo, and the Koonce defendants.\n\nThe court found that plaintiffs were to have only one recovery of compensatory damages,\n\nand the judgments entered were not cumulative.\n\n       A trial court has broad discretionary powers in awarding attorney fees and its\n\ndiscretion will not be reversed on review unless the court abused its discretion. Mirar\n\nDevelopment, Inc. v. Kroner, 308 Ill. App. 3d 483, 485 (1999), citing In re Estate of\n\nCallahan, 144 Ill. 2d 32, 43-44 (1991). The party seeking fees bears the burden of\n\npresenting sufficient evidence from which the trial court can render a decision as to their\n\nreasonableness. Kaiser v. MEPC American Properties, Inc., 164 Ill. App. 3d 978, 983\n\n(1987), citing Fiorito v. Jones, 72 Ill. 2d 73 (1978); Heckman v. Hospital Service Corp.,\n\n104 Ill. App. 3d 728 (1982); Ealy v. Peddy, 138 Ill. App. 3d 397 (1985). An appropriate\n\nfee consists of reasonable charges for reasonable services; however, to justify a fee, more\n\nmust be presented than a mere compilation of hours multiplied by a fixed hourly rate or\n\nbills issued to the client (In re Marriage of Angiuli, 134 Ill. App. 3d 417 (1985)), since\n\nthis type of data, without more, does not provide the court with sufficient information as\n\nto their reasonableness -- a matter which cannot be determined on the basis of conjecture\n\nor on the opinion or conclusions of the attorney seeking the fees. Flynn v. Kucharski, 59\n\nIll. 2d 61 (1974); In re Marriage of Angiuli, 134 Ill. App. 3d 417 (1985). Rather, the\n\npetition for fees must specify the services performed, by whom they were performed, the\n\ntime expended thereon and the hourly rate charged therefor. Fiorito, 72 Ill. 2d 73; Ealy v.\n\nPeddy, 138 Ill. App. 3d 397 (1985). Because of the importance of these factors, it is\n\nincumbent upon the petitioner to present detailed records maintained during the course of\n\n                                             61\n\fthe litigation containing facts and computations upon which the charges are predicated.\n\nFlynn v. Kucharski, 59 Ill. 2d 61 (1974); Board of Education of the Aptakisic-Tripp\n\nSchool District No. 102 v. County of Lake, 156 Ill. App. 3d 1064 (1987).\n\n       Once presented with these facts, the trial court should consider a variety of\n\nadditional factors such as the skill and standing of the attorneys, the nature of the case,\n\nthe novelty and/or difficulty of the issues and work involved, the importance of the\n\nmatter, the degree of responsibility required, the usual and customary charges for\n\ncomparable services, the benefit to the client (Ashby v. Price, 112 Ill. App. 3d 114\n\n(1983)), and whether there is a reasonable connection between the fees and the amount\n\ninvolved in the litigation. In re Estate of Healy, 137 Ill. App. 3d 406 (1985); In re\n\nMarriage of Ransom, 102 Ill. App. 3d 38 (1981).\n\n       As noted, on March 31, 2006, Gambino engaged attorneys Michael Braun,\n\nSherwin Winer, and Kevin O’Rouke, after his original attorneys had withdrawn.\n\nInitially, all three attorneys billed monthly on an hourly rate. Within a short time,\n\nGambino was unable to keep current in paying the attorneys’ fees. Counsels were\n\nunwilling to continue working on an hourly basis when their bills were not being pay and\n\nthey would not agree to deferring payment until conclusion of the case. It was agreed\n\nthat while billing would continue on an hourly basis, all amounts unpaid would be treated\n\nby a contingency fee agreement. Specifically, all unpaid hourly fees would be paid at\n\nthree times the amount billed if and when the case reached successful outcome. Costs\n\nwere to be treated in the same manner. The attorneys’ billings were attached to the fees\n\npetition submitted to the trial court after trial. A total of $187,196 in bills was unpaid,\n\nand thus subject to the contingency enhancement.\n\n                                              62\n\f        The trial court found that the attorneys’ hourly rates were reasonable and all\n\nitemizations sufficiently detailed, noting its own familiarity with the entire context of the\n\ntrial court proceedings. The trial court found the time billed for each item appropriate,\n\nrecognizing the difficulties presented by the multidefendant, multiproperty case and the\n\nexpertise of plaintiffs’ counsel.\n\n        The Wolf defendants argue that the trial court abused its discretion by awarding\n\nattorney fees for plaintiffs’ slander of title claims. They argue that only the attorney fees\n\nincurred on plaintiffs’ quieting title claims were recoverable, not fees incurred for\n\nplaintiffs’ claims for slander of title. This argument is not persuasive.\n\n        Contrary to the Wolf defendants’ argument, there is authority in Illinois providing\n\nthat recovery for slander of title actions permit recovery of those costs and attorney fees\n\nwhich directly flow from the wrongful disparagement. Home Investments Fund v.\n\nRobertson, 10 Ill. App. 3d 840, 844 (1973). Further, plaintiffs were entitled to recover\n\nthose costs and attorney fees directly related to the quieting of title and to those damages\n\ndirectly related to a slander of title, i.e., loss of vendibility, etc. Robertson, 10 Ill. App.\n\n3d at 844.\n\n        Both the Koonce defendants and the Wolf defendants argue that the trial court\n\nabused its discretion by awarding attorney fees enhanced by a multiplier of three. They\n\nargue that no Illinois authority supported the use of a multiplier.\n\n        The trial court rejected defendants’ objections to the use of a multiplier of three\n\ntimes the lodestar, finding that the measure was imminently reasonable. The trial court\n\nfound the hourly rates were modest and the attorneys’ itemized time appropriate.\n\n\n\n                                               63\n\fFurther, the trial court found that the fee was proportionate to the value of the properties\n\nat issue, roughly $2.5 million.\n\n        As noted, plaintiffs were entitled to recover those costs and attorney fees directly\n\nrelated to the quieting of title and to those damages directly related to a slander of title,\n\ni.e., loss of vendibility, etc. Robertson, 10 Ill. App. 3d at 844. Plaintiffs costs and\n\nattorney fees directly related to the quieting of title and to those damages directly related\n\nto a slander of title were those costs which Gambino agreed to in his contingency\n\nagreement with counsel who tried this litigation to successful outcome.\n\n        The Koonce defendants and the Wolf defendants do not cite, and our independent\n\nresearch does not reveal any Illinois authority that forbids the award of plaintiffs’ actual\n\ncosts and attorney fees directly related to this action. No law of this state, including any\n\nstatute, compels us to find the contingency agreement against public policy.\n\n        We cannot find that the trial court abused its discretion by awarding plaintiffs\n\nattorney fees actually incurred in this action.\n\n        We now turn to the arguments regarding the imposition of punitive damages. As\n\nnoted, the trial court awarded $675,000 in punitive damages: $500,000, jointly and\n\nseverally, against Sal, Enzo, and the Koonce defendants, and $175,000 against Wolf and\n\nWW Funding.\n\n        The purpose of punitive damages is: “ ‘(1) to act as retribution against the\n\ndefendant; (2) to deter the defendant from committing similar wrongs in the future; and\n\n(3) to deter others from similar conduct.’ ” Gomez v. The Finishing Co., 369 Ill. App. 3d\n\n711, 721 (2006), quoting Hazelwood v. Illinois Central Gulf R.R., 114 Ill. App. 3d 703,\n\n712 (1983). Such damages will be awarded only where the defendant’s conduct is willful\n\n                                              64\n\for outrageous due to evil motive or a reckless indifference to the rights of others. Franz\n\nv. Calaco Development Corp., 352 Ill. App. 3d 1129, 1137 (2004), citing Proctor v.\n\nDavis, 291 Ill. App. 3d 265, 285 (1997). Because punitive damages are not favored in\n\nthe law they are only available in cases where the wrongful act complained of is\n\ncharacterized by wantonness, malice, oppression, willfulness, or other circumstances of\n\naggravation. Franz, 352 Ill. App. 3d at 1138.\n\n        On appeal from a bench trial, the question of whether punitive damages are\n\navailable as a matter of law for the cause of action is reviewed de novo. Franz, 352 Ill.\n\nApp. 3d at 1137. The question of whether the facts prove willfulness or other\n\naggravating factors is a factual determination that is reviewed using the manifest-weight\n\nstandard. Franz, 352 Ill. App. 3d at 1137-38. Whether punitive damages should be\n\nawarded is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. Franz, 352 Ill. App. 3d at 1138. We\n\nreview the computation of the punitive damages award to determine whether the amount\n\nwas excessive or the result of passion, partiality, or corruption. Franz, 352 Ill. App. 3d at\n\n1138.\n\n        “In reviewing [the] determination of the amount of punitive damages, if any, we\n\nwill reverse only if the award was ‘so excessive [as] to indicate passion, partiality, or\n\ncorruption.’ ” Gomez, 369 Ill. App. 3d at 722, quoting Franz, 352 Ill. App. 3d at 1138.\n\nThe assessment of punitive damages is a highly factual decision, which is appropriately\n\nmade at the trial court level. Franz, 352 Ill. App. 3d at 1144. The amount of an award\n\nshould be a reflection of the fact finder’s determination as to the degree of maliciousness\n\nevidenced by a defendant’s actions. Franz, 352 Ill. App. 3d at 1144. In reviewing the\n\nmaliciousness of conduct for purposes of punitive damages awards, a reviewing court is\n\n                                             65\n\fnot in a position to reassess the credibility of the witnesses who testified at trial. Franz,\n\n352 Ill. App. 3d at 1144. A trial court must evaluate available evidence of a defendant’s\n\nfinancial worth in calculating punitive damages, but an award will not be overturned just\n\nbecause the defendant did not present evidence of financial worth at trial. Gomez, 369\n\nIll. App. 3d at 722, citing Franz, 352 Ill. App. 3d at 1144, and Kochan v. Owens-Corning\n\nFiberglass Corp., 242 Ill. App. 3d 781, 798 (1993).\n\n        Here, as a matter of law, punitive damages are available. See Chicago Title &\n\nTrust Co. v. Levine, 333 Ill. App. 3d 420, 426 (2002) (affirming award of punitive\n\ndamages in slander of title case).\n\n        However, the Koonce defendants and the Wolf defendants argue that the trial\n\ncourt erred by imposing punitive damages, as a matter of law, because there was no\n\nevidence to support a finding of malice beyond that necessary for a finding of liability on\n\nthe tort of slander of title itself. They argue that, “to the extent that plaintiff[s]\n\nestablished nothing more than the elements of the tort itself, punitive damages are not\n\nappropriate.” Further, they argue that the trial court’s finding that punitive damages were\n\nwarranted in this case was against the manifest weight of the evidence. These arguments\n\nare unpersuasive.\n\n        In Illinois, although malice is an element of the tort of slander, punitive damages\n\nmay be awarded in slander cases where actual malice exists. Levine, 333 Ill. App. 3d at\n\n426; Mullen v. Solber, 271 Ill. App. 3d 442, 445 (1995). Further, as is apparent from a\n\nreading of the trial court’s memorandum opinions and orders, it found actual malice\n\nwarranting the imposition of punitive damages in this case. The trial court found that the\n\nmalice exhibited by these defendants was beyond that necessary to establish the elements\n\n                                               66\n\fof plaintiffs’ slander of title claims. The trial court found that the Koonce defendants and\n\nthe Wolf defendants participated in a number of transactions by which the subject\n\nproperties were taken from plaintiffs by means of fraudulent, forged legal documents.\n\nAgain, we note that the settlement documents are direct evidence of fraud. The Niles\n\nProperty alone had $25,000 in commitment fees distributed to the Wolfs and\n\nZippershtein; a mortgage escrow of $33,000, which is unusual; a $5,000 appraisal fee;\n\nand a payment to Sal of $25,000 that is questionable on its face. The Kedzie settlement\n\ndisbursements reveal commitment or loan fees of $18,750, a $25,000 payment to\n\n“Norman Trust Account,” and $5,372.72 to a law firm not involved in the process, and\n\nover $50,000 to unknown people and only $10,000 to Gambino. The disbursements on\n\nthe Lavergne Property were just as bizarre with no funds going to Gambino and $120,000\n\nto Enzo with loan fees over $7,000 and an unexplained disbursement to Harris Bank for\n\n$10,000. Further, Wolf, Zippershtein, and Azran, had in place an agreement to share in\n\nthe ownership of the Kedzie Property in the event Gambino should fail to exercise his\n\noption to purchase the property. The trial court’s decision to impose punitive damages in\n\nthis case was neither error as a matter of law, against the manifest weight of the evidence,\n\nor an abuse of its discretion. Again, the assessment of punitive damages is highly factual\n\ndecision that should be a reflection of the fact finder’s determination of maliciousness.\n\nGomez, 369 Ill. App. 3d at 722. We cannot disturb the trial court’s assessment of\n\npunitive damages here.\n\n       We note that no defendant has provided us with any authority of whether the trial\n\ncourt’s assessment of punitive damages before its calculation of compensatory damages\n\nwas error. As a result any contention in this regard is waived. 210 Ill. 2d R. 341(h)(7).\n\n                                             67\n\fWe also were unable to find any authority dictating the reversal of the trial court’s order\n\nunder these circumstances. We also note that the fact that no evidence of defendants’\n\nfinancial status does not require reversal. Kochan, 242 Ill. App. 3d at 798. This court in\n\na decision authored by Justice Cahill recently upheld an award of punitive damages\n\ndespite the absence of evidence of the defendant’s financial status in Gomez v. The\n\nFinishing Co., 369 Ill. App. 3d 711 (2006).\n\n       Next, both the Koonce defendants and the Wolf defendants argue that the trial\n\ncourt’s award of punitive damages violated their constitutional right to due process.\n\n       The standard of review for the constitutional question of whether a punitive\n\ndamages award is excessive in violation of due process is reviewed de novo. Franz, 352\n\nIll. App. 3d at 1147. A constitutional challenge to an award of punitive damages is\n\nseparate from the common-law challenge addressed above. Franz, 352 Ill. App. 3d at\n\n1147. The constitutional question requires a court to consider three factors: (1) the\n\ndegree of reprehensibility of the defendant’s misconduct; (2) the disparity between the\n\nharm suffered by the plaintiff and the punitive damages award; and (3) the difference\n\nbetween the punitive damages awarded and the civil penalties authorized or imposed in\n\ncomparable cases. Franz, 352 Ill. App. 3d at 1147, citing Cooper Industries, Inc. v.\n\nLeatherman Tool Group, Inc., 532 U.S. 424, 440, 149 L. Ed. 2d 674, 689, 121 S. Ct.\n\n1678, 1687 (2001).\n\n       “Perhaps the most important indicium of the reasonableness of a punitive\n\ndamages award is the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant's conduct.” BMW of\n\nNorth Amerca, Inc. v. Gore, 517 U.S. 559, 575, 134 L. Ed. 2d 809, 826, 116 S. Ct. 1589,\n\n1599 (1996). Courts are instructed to consider the following factors when determining\n\n                                              68\n\freprehensibility: (1) whether the harm caused was physical as opposed to economic; (2)\n\nwhether the tortious conduct evinced an indifference to or a reckless disregard for the\n\nhealth and safety of others; (3) whether the target of the conduct was financially\n\nvulnerable; (4) whether the conduct involved repeated actions or was an isolated\n\nincident; and (5) whether the harm was the result of intentional malice, trickery, or\n\ndeceit, or mere accident. Gore, 517 U.S. at 575, 134 L. Ed. 2d at 826, 116 S. Ct. at 1599.\n\n“The existence of any one of these factors weighing in favor of a plaintiff may not be\n\nsufficient to sustain a punitive damages award; and the absence of all of them renders any\n\naward suspect. It should be presumed a plaintiff has been made whole for his injuries by\n\ncompensatory damages, so punitive damages should only be awarded if the defendant's\n\nculpability, after having paid compensatory damages, is so reprehensible as to warrant\n\nthe imposition of further sanctions to achieve punishment or deterrence.” State Farm\n\nMutual Automobile Insurance Co. v. Campbell, 538 U.S. at 408, 419, 155 L. Ed. 2d 585,\n\n602, 123 S. Ct. 1513, 1521 (2003).\n\n       In the case at bar, the evidence presented and highlighted by the trial court’s\n\nfindings, demonstrated the reprehensible nature of the defendants’ conduct. As noted,\n\nthe factors to be considered in determining reprehensibility include whether the target of\n\nthe conduct was financially vulnerable, whether the conduct involved repeated actions\n\nand whether the harm was the result of intentional malice, trickery, or deceit. Here, it is\n\nundisputed that Gambino was in serious financial debt in the summer of 2002. He owed\n\nback taxes to the IRS and overdue real estate taxes. Further, the conduct involved\n\nrepeated actions. Over 40 legal documents were used in order to take title to the subject\n\nproperties over the course of six real estate closings. The trial court also found that the\n\n                                             69\n\fharm here was the result of intentional malice, trickery, and deceit. The trial court\n\ndetermined that the Koonce defendants and the Wolf defendants participated in a scheme\n\nto take plaintiffs’ properties through the use of fraudulent, forged legal documents\n\nincluding forged deeds.\n\n        Furthermore, the punitive damages awarded in this case were only a fraction of\n\nthe damages plaintiffs’ suffered as a result of the defendants’ conduct. The trial court’s\n\nimposition of punitive damages in this case did not violate due process.\n\n                                        4. Sanctions\n\n        We finally come to the final issues on appeal; whether the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion by denying two Illinois Supreme Court Rule 137 motions for sanctions (155\n\nIll. 2d R. 137) in its May 2, 2008, order. Plaintiffs filed a cross-appeal from the denial of\n\ntheir motion for sanctions against defendants Plaza Bank and Washington Mutual for\n\nfailing to amend their answer to plaintiffs’ complaint to conform to the proofs of this\n\ncase. Plaza Bank and Washington Mutual filed their own Rule 137 motion in response to\n\nplaintiffs’ motion, which was also denied. Plaza Bank and Washington Mutual appeal\n\nthe denial of their motion for sanctions.\n\n        As noted, plaintiffs’ complaint alleged that Plaza Bank and Washington Mutual\n\nknew or should have known that the trustee’s deeds recorded against the subject\n\nproperties were forged. In response to this allegation both Plaza Bank and Washington\n\nMutual answered that they “lacked knowledge or information sufficient” to form a belief\n\nas to the truth of the allegation.\n\n        Plaintiffs filed a motion for sanctions against Plaza Bank and Washington Mutual\n\non December 12, 2007, after the trial court’s November 30, 2007, order, arguing that\n\n                                             70\n\fPlaza Bank and Washington Mutual had a continuing duty to monitor the accuracy of\n\ntheir answer and that their continued disavowal of the forgeries warranted sanctions.\n\n       Plaza Bank and Washington Mutual responded and filed a cross-motion for\n\nsanctions, contending that the motion for sanctions filed by plaintiffs themselves was not\n\nwell-grounded in fact or law.\n\n       Illinois Supreme Court Rule 137 allows the trial court to award sanctions against\n\nparties who filed frivolous pleadings when a pleading has no basis in fact or law. 134 Ill.\n\n2d R. 137. An attorney’s signature on a pleading, motion or other paper indicates:\n\n       “That to the best of his knowledge, information, and belief formed after\n\n       reasonable inquiry it is well grounded in fact and is warranted by existing\n\n       law or a good-faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal\n\n       of existing law, and that it is not interposed for any improper purpose.”\n\n       134 Ill. 2d R. 137.\n\n“Rule 137 is intended to prevent counsel from making assertions of fact or law without\n\nsupport.” Lewy v. Koeckritz International, Inc., 211 Ill. App. 3d 330, 334 (1991).\n\nSpecifically, with respect to a question of law, Rule 137 is intended to provide a sanction\n\nwhen a party asserts a proposition of law which is contrary to established precedent.\n\nShea, Rogal & Associates, Ltd. v. Leslie Volkswagen, Inc., 250 Ill. App. 3d 149 (1993).\n\n       In order to avoid sanctions, parties must present objectively reasonable arguments\n\nfor their view, regardless of whether they are found to be correct. Shea, 250 Ill. App. 3d\n\nat 154. In determining whether sanctions are warranted in a particular case, the court\n\nmust ascertain what was reasonable at the time, and should not engage in hindsight.\n\nLewy, 211 Ill. App. 3d at 334. The determination of whether to impose sanctions under\n\n                                            71\n\fRule 137 rests with the sound discretion of the trial court; the decision to impose or deny\n\nsanctions is entitled to great weight on appeal and will not be disturbed on review absent\n\nan abuse of discretion. In re Estate of Wernick, 127 Ill. 2d 61, 77-78 (1989).\n\n       The trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying plaintiffs’ motion for\n\nsanctions. It is quite settled that a pleading is judged at the time that it is filed. Ambrose\n\nv. Thornton Township School Trustees, 274 Ill. App. 3d 676, 685 (1995) (“[i]n\n\ndetermining whether sanctions are warranted in a particular case, the court must ascertain\n\nwhat was reasonable at the time, and should not engage in hindsight”). Further, there\n\nwas evidence in the record that if believed would have validated Plaza Bank and\n\nWashington Mutual’s answer. Evidence was presented to the trial court that Gambino\n\nratified and/or authorized the transactions; of course, this evidence was rejected by the\n\ntrial court, but it cannot be used as a basis to sanction a party on the basis of a pleading\n\nfiled long before the trial court’s judgment.\n\n       Further, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying Plaza Bank and\n\nWashington Mutual’s motion for sanctions. Although the trial court made no specific\n\nfindings as to the denial of this motion for sanctions, the trial court could have found that\n\nplaintiffs’ motion for sanctions was not made for an improper purpose and was a good-\n\nfaith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law to impose a\n\nduty on litigants a continuing duty to amend their pleadings as facts come to light that\n\nwould prove their pleadings mistaken.\n\n\n\n\n                                                72\n\f                                    CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court of Cook\n\nCounty in its entirety.\n\n       Affirmed.\n\n       CAHILL, P.J., and McBRIDE, J., concur.\n\n\n\n\n                                           73\n\f",

GORDON delivered the opinion of the court:\n\n       These consolidated appeals arise from an action to quiet title to three parcels of\n\nreal estate and to recover damages for slander of title filed in the chancery division of the\n\ncircuit court of Cook County. Joseph J. Gambino (Gambino), as beneficiary of three\n\fseparate land trusts, and North Star Trust Company (North Star), as trustee under land\n\ntrust agreements Nos. 13534, 23985, and 23994, filed this action to quiet title to the three\n\nparcels of real estate and to recover damages for slander of title against certain\n\ndefendants. The subject properties are located at 7460 North Milwaukee Avenue in\n\nNiles, Illinois (Niles Property), 2738-40 North Kedzie Avenue in Chicago (Kedzie\n\nProperty), and 3619 North Lavergne Avenue in Chicago (Lavergne Property).1 Gambino\n\nsuffered a heart attack during his discovery deposition in this matter and died shortly\n\nthereafter. Joseph M. Gambino was substituted as party plaintiff as independent\n\nadministrator of his father’s estate.\n\n        After a two-week bench trial in late October and early November of 2007, the\n\ntrial court found in favor of plaintiffs on all counts of their complaint declaring (1) title to\n\nthe subject properties was vested in North Star under trust agreements Nos. 13534,\n\n23985, and 23994, and (2) all purported inconsistent instruments of title and any clouds\n\non title to the subject properties, including mortgage liens, were void. Further, the trial\n\ncourt awarded plaintiffs compensatory damages of $595,574 and (2) punitive damages of\n\n$675,000 as follows: $500,000, jointly and severally, against defendants Salvatore\n\nDiBenedetto, Vincenzo DiBenedetto, Dennis Koonce, Boulevard Mortgage Corporation,\n\nand Title America, Inc., and $175,000, jointly and severally, against defendants Stephen\n\nWolf and W.W. Funding, L.L.C. We affirm.\n\n\n\n\n        1\n            The properties will be referred to collectively as the “subject properties” where\n\nappropriate.\n\n                                                2\n\f                                       BACKGROUND\n\n                                       1. The Pleadings\n\n       Plaintiffs’ verified “Corrected Second Amended Complaint” contained six counts,\n\ntwo counts as to each of the three subject properties. As to each of the properties, one\n\ncount sought to quiet title and a second count alleged slander of title. The allegations of\n\nthe complaint common to all six counts were as follows.2 Gambino, 73 years old at the\n\ntime of his death in 2006, owned and operated the United Transmission Center (United),\n\nan Illinois corporation, a motor vehicle transmission repair business located at the Niles\n\nProperty. The Lavergne Property consisted of a four-unit, multifamily apartment\n\nbuilding that Gambino owned for “investment purposes.” In October 2002, Gambino\n\nmet with his nephew, defendant Salvatore DiBenedetto (Sal), whom Gambino believed to\n\nbe a mortgage broker, to assist him in refinancing one or more of his properties in order\n\nto pay off certain financial obligations. Over the following two months, Gambino and\n\nSal had several discussions, during which Sal obtained information concerning\n\nGambino’s business and assets, including information regarding the subject properties.\n\n       The complaint alleged that Sal represented to Gambino that he and several real\n\nestate investors were interested in purchasing the Niles and Kedzie Properties and the\n\ntransmission business. Sal suggested that the transmission business should be managed\n\nby his brother, defendant Enzo DiBenedetto (Enzo). Gambino refused. Shortly\n\n       2\n           Previous versions of plaintiffs’ complaint were verified by the sworn affidavit of\n\nGambino, prior to his death and preserved in plaintiffs’ “Corrected Second Amended\n\nComplaint,” which contained binding judicial admissions.

Gambino never accepted the offer.\n\n        The complaint further alleged that Sal personally loaned Gambino $70,000 to be\n\nrepaid upon future refinancing or sale of any of the subject properties. The complaint\n\nalleged that Sal requested permission to remove underground liquid storage tanks at the\n\nNiles Property prior to any transfer of the property, and Gambino refused.\n\n        The complaint further alleged that Gambino never: (1) signed any agreement\n\nregarding the conveyance of any of the subject properties, or the purchase of United; (2)\n\nauthorized Sal or anyone else to place liens or encumbrances upon any of the subject\n\nproperties, including any mortgages; (3) authorized anyone to affix his signature to any\n\ndocument concerning any of the subject properties; or (4) directed his land trustee North\n\nStar to transfer title or his beneficial interest in the subject properties to anyone.\n\n        The complaint further alleged that Sal, Enzo, Boulevard, and defendants Dennis\n\nKoonce and Title America, Inc. (Title America), “participated in” forging deeds, and\n\nother documents, to “procure and secure” mortgages on those properties. The complaint\n\nalleged that Koonce, an attorney, participated in each of the transactions that purported to\n\nconvey title to the subject properties. Additionally, the complaint alleged that Boulevard\n\nand Title America are both owned and controlled by Koonce, that Boulevard was the\n\nultimate grantee in a series of forged deeds pertaining to the Lavergne Property, and that\n\nTitle America acted as title agent with regard to all but one of the transactions that\n\npurported to convey title to the subject properties.\n\n        Count I of plaintiffs’ complaint, pled against Sal, Enzo, Koonce, Boulevard, Title\n\nAmerica, and Washington Mutual Bank, sought to quiet title to the Lavergne Property.\n\n                                               4\n\fCount I of plaintiff’s complaint alleged that in May 2003, a mortgage lien in favor of\n\nLaSalle Bank existed on the Lavergne Property, with a principal balance of\n\napproximately $200,000. On May 5, 2003, LaSalle “informed” Gambino that the\n\nmortgage had been paid in full although Gambino was unaware of this transaction.\n\n       Count I further alleged that unbeknownst to plaintiffs, Sal, Enzo, Koonce,\n\nBoulevard, and Title America recorded against the Lavergne Property: a forged trustee’s\n\ndeed purportedly executed by North Star, conveying title to the Lavergne Property to\n\nKoonce; a mortgage naming Koonce as the borrower and Equity Plus, Inc., as the lender,\n\nwith a principal sum of $400,000; a mortgage naming Koonce as the borrower and\n\nWashington Mutual as the lender with a principal sum of $406,000; and a quitclaim deed,\n\nlisting Koonce as the grantor and Boulevard as the grantee. Count I further alleges that\n\nSal, Enzo, Koonce, Boulevard, Title America and Washington Mutual knew or should\n\nhave known that the purported trustee’s deed conveying title to Koonce was forged.\n\n       Count II of plaintiffs’ complaint, pled against Sal, Enzo, Koonce, Boulevard, and\n\nTitle America, seeking compensatory and punitive damages, alleges slander of title with\n\nregard to the Lavergne Property.\n\n       Count III of plaintiffs’ complaint, pled against Sal, Enzo, Koonce, Title America,\n\nW.W. Funding, L.L.C. (WW Funding), Stephen Wolf, and Plaza Bank, sought to quiet\n\ntitle to the Niles Property. Count III alleged that in the early fall of 2003, Reuben\n\nZippershtein told Gambino that he was the mortgagee to the Niles Property and that the\n\nmortgage was in default. On January 21, 2004, Zippershtein filed suit to foreclose the\n\nmortgage. On July 9, 2004, Zippershtein voluntarily dismissed the foreclosure suit and\n\nexecuted a release deed of the recorded mortgage on the Niles Property.\n\n                                              5\n\f       Count III alleged that the Zippershtein mortgage was a result of forged and\n\nunauthorized instruments which were recorded by Sal, Enzo, Koonce, Boulevard, Title\n\nAmerica, Wolf and WW Funding. Count III further alleged that the following illegal\n\ninstruments were recorded against the Niles Property: a forged trustee’s deed,\n\npurportedly executed by North Star, conveying title to the Niles Property to “Joseph J.\n\nGambino”; a mortgage naming “Joseph J. Gambino” as the borrower and Zippershtein as\n\nthe lender, with a principal sum of $200,000; a warrantee deed, listing “Joseph J.\n\nGambino” as the grantor and WW Funding as the grantee; a mortgage, naming WW\n\nFunding as the borrower and defendant Plaza Bank as the lender, with a principal sum of\n\n$445,000; and an assignment, purporting to assign rents from WW Funding to Plaza\n\nBank. Count III further alleged that Sal, Enzo, Koonce, Boulevard, Title America, WW\n\nFunding, Wolf, and Plaza Bank knew or should have known that the purported trustee’s\n\ndeed conveying title to “Joseph J. Gambino” was forged.\n\n       Count IV of plaintiffs’ complaint, pled against Sal, Enzo, Koonce, Boulevard,\n\nTitle America, WW Funding, and Wolf, seeking compensatory and punitive damages,\n\nalleged slander of title with regard to the Niles Property.\n\n       Count V of plaintiffs’ complaint, pled against Sal, Enzo, Koonce, Boulevard,\n\nTitle America, WW Funding, Wolf, and Plaza Bank, sought to quiet title to the Kedzie\n\nProperty. Count V alleged that the following illegal instruments were recorded against\n\nthe Kedzie Property: a forged trustee’s deed, purportedly executed by North Star,\n\nconveying title to the Kedzie Property to “Joseph J. Gambino”; a forged warrantee deed,\n\nlisting “Joseph J. Gambino” as the grantor and 21st Century Financial Planners, Inc.\n\n\n\n                                              6\n\f(Century), as the grantee3; a special warranty deed, listing Century as grantor and WW\n\nFunding as grantee; a mortgage naming WW Funding as the borrower and Plaza Bank as\n\nthe lender, with a principal sum of $350,000; and an assignment, purporting to assign\n\nrents from WW Funding to Plaza Bank. Count V further alleged that Sal, Enzo, Koonce,\n\nBoulevard, Title America, WW Funding, Wolf, and Plaza Bank knew or should have\n\nknown that the purported trustee’s deed conveying title to “Joseph J. Gambino” was\n\nforged.\n\n          Count VI of plaintiffs’ complaint, pled against Sal, Enzo, Koonce, Boulevard,\n\nTitle America, WW Funding, and Wolf, seeking compensatory and punitive damages,\n\nalleged slander of title with regard to the Kedzie Property.\n\n          As noted, defendants Koonce, Boulevard, Title America, and WW Funding filed\n\ncounterclaims which included claims to quiet title to the subject properties. The Koonce\n\ndefendants’ (Koonce, Boulevard, and Title America) verified amended counterclaim\n\ncontained five counts. Count I of the Koonce-related defendants’ counterclaim sought a\n\njudgment to quiet title to the Lavergne Property in favor of Boulevard. Counts II, III, IV,\n\nand V of the Koonce defendants’ counterclaim alleged unjust enrichment, fraud,\n\nintentional interference with a business relationship, and slander of title, respectively.\n\n          Further, the Koonce defendants raised affirmative defenses to plaintiffs’\n\ncomplaint consisting of waiver, estoppel, ratification, and laches.\n\n          3\n              This warranty deed bears an execution date of January 17, 2003; the complaint\n\nalleges that on that same date, Gambino’s signature was forged to a commercial lease\n\nwhere Gambino purportedly leased the Kedzie Property from Century. This lease was\n\nsigned by Wolf on behalf of Century.\n\n                                                 7\n\f       WW Funding’s counterclaim was filed in two counts. One count concerned the\n\nKedzie Property and the other count concerned the Niles Property. In each count WW\n\nFunding sought to quiet title or, in the alternative, to obtain reimbursement from\n\nGambino’s estate for various sums.4\n\n                         2. Overview of the Events Leading to Trial\n\n       As noted, this case was tried as a bench trial over a two-week period in late\n\nOctober and early November of 2007. In order to provide context for the testimony\n\npresented in this case, we will provide an overview of the events leading to trial,\n\nincluding a description of the real estate closings, the disbursement of funds, and the\n\nparties’ involvement in those closings.\n\n       It is undisputed by the parties that Gambino was in serious financial debt in the\n\nsummer of 2002, owing overdue payroll and real estate taxes. United, Gambino’s motor\n\nvehicle transmission repair business, had failed to pay payroll taxes since 1999 and owed\n\nthe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) approximately $125,000 to $150,000 for back taxes,\n\npenalties, and interest. Gambino was in danger of losing properties, which had been sold\n\nto tax buyers for unpaid real estate taxes that were past due.\n\n       By June 2002, the payroll taxes had gone unpaid for years, and the IRS threatened\n\nto levy on United and close them down, seize its assets, and/or personally assess\n\n        4\n            At oral argument before this court on November 12, 2009, counsel for Wolf\n\nand WW Funding stated that both Wolf and WW Funding seek only to vacate the trial\n\ncourt’s findings against them with respect to slander of title, and that WW Funding no\n\nlonger seeks a finding of quiet title with respect to either the Kedzie or Niles Property\n\nor reimbursement from Gambino’s estate.\n\n                                              8\n\fGambino for the outstanding moneys due. In June 2002, Gambino hired Jeffrey Pritikin,\n\nwho testified in plaintiffs’ case-in-chief. Pritikin testified he was an accountant and an\n\n“enrolled agent” licensed to represent taxpayers before the IRS. He testified that one can\n\nbecome an “enrolled agent” by working for the IRS for five years, and he had worked for\n\nthe IRS for seven years. He is not an attorney and not a certified public accountant.\n\n       Pritikin testified that Gambino told him that he intended to borrow money by\n\nusing the subject properties as security; in September 2002, Gambino approached his\n\nnephew Sal, who “had contacts” in the mortgage industry. Pritikin spoke with Sal, who\n\nclaimed he was able to arrange a loan for Gambino and provided Pritikin with a\n\ncommitment letter to present to the IRS to “stall” any seizure of Gambino’s or United’s\n\nassets. Pritikin submitted a form to the IRS which contained a description of the subject\n\nproperties and their corresponding values, which were less than the values of what the\n\nsubject properties were appraised for.\n\n       Six transactions, two as to each of the subject properties, form the basis of\n\nplaintiffs’ complaint to quiet title and for damages for slander of title. The testimony at\n\ntrial concerning the transactions, and the circumstances surrounding them, indicate the\n\nfollowing. The witnesses whose testimony provides the basis for the following synopsis\n\nwere called as witnesses in plaintiffs’ case-in-chief, and they testified without objection\n\nunder the Dead-Man’s Act (735 ILCS 5/8-201 (West 2006)), as did Pritikin.\n\n       Sal sought a collateral-based lender for the Niles Property in the summer of 2002.\n\nHe met with Wolf and explained what he was looking for. Wolf spoke with his associate,\n\nReuben Zippershtein (since deceased), a “hard money” lender, who made a loan on the\n\nproperty. Sal testified that Zippershtein agreed to loan Gambino $200,000 to be repaid in\n\n                                              9\n\fone year, and that Zippershtein advised Gambino to direct North Star to convey legal title\n\nto Gambino because a loan could not be procured if legal title was held in trust.\n\n       Maritza Castillo, a senior trust officer for North Star, testified that Gambino\n\nexecuted three written directions to convey legal title to Gambino from the land trusts.\n\nHe told her that he was going to refinance the properties and required legal title conveyed\n\nto him personally.\n\n       Koonce testified that in October 2002, at Sal’s request, he began to give money to\n\nSal and Enzo for what he believed were loans to Gambino. Koonce testified that he\n\nsigned numerous checks payable to Sal and Enzo and gave them to Sal frequently over a\n\nperiod of about three years totaling of $157,300.\n\n       Sal testified that he arranged for an appraisal of the Niles Property, for which he\n\nand Enzo both testified Enzo paid the appraiser $5,000. Gambino accompanied the\n\nappraiser through the property during the appraisal. The property was appraised at\n\n$550,000, and the appraisal report was delivered to Zippershtein’s office. Sal testified\n\nthat he obtained an estimate of redemption for the past-due real estate taxes owed on the\n\nNiles Property and forwarded copies to Zippershtein, Gambino, and Koonce. Real estate\n\ntaxes had not been paid since 1999 and the property had been sold to a tax buyer.\n\n       Stephen Fritzshall, Zippershtein’s attorney, testified that Zippershtein telephoned\n\nhim to drop everything to prepare the legal documents to “save Gambino’s business and\n\nproperty.” Koonce faxed Fritzshall wire instructions and provided a copy of the title\n\ncommitment issued by Title America.\n\n       The first closing related to the Niles Property occurred on December 20, 2002.\n\nSal testified that he obtained the closing documents from Koonce and Fritzshall, the\n\n                                            10\n\ftrustee’s deed conveying title to Gambino and other documents from Gambino, “got the\n\ntransfer tax exemption stamp in Niles, and went to Zippershtein’s office for the checks\n\nand a conference call with Koonce.” Fritzshall, Zippershtein, Sal, and Wolf were\n\npresent, with Koonce representing the title company and assisting by telephone. Koonce\n\ntransmitted to Fritzshall an insurance binder and a signed Housing and Urban\n\nDevelopment (HUD) settlement statement signed by Koonce and purportedly signed by\n\nGambino.\n\n       Koonce testified that he made disbursements on behalf of Title America pursuant\n\nto Gambino’s purported letter of direction, which was delivered by Sal. Disbursements\n\nwere made to the following:\n\nStephen Wolf                  $5,250          (commitment fees)\nAdam Wolf                     $4,000          (commitment fees)\nZippershtein                  $15,750         (commitment fees)\nDecember Interest             $3,000          (on Zippershtein mortgage)\nFritzshall                    $1,500          (attorney fees)\nMortgage Escrow               $33,000         (11 months of payments on mortgage)\nSal                           $53,141.91      (for back taxes)\nEnzo                          $5,000          (appraisal fee)\nLawyers Title                 $282            (title policy, etc.)\nKoonce, Title America         $1490           (closing fees)\nGambino                       $52,586.09\nSal                           $25,000           (Sal testified that the moneys went to\n                                                Gambino)\n                              ----------------------------------------------------------\n                              $200,000          Total\n\n       Sal testified that he obtained a cashier’s check at Harris Bank for the property\n\ntaxes and cashed the check payable to him, paid the outstanding real estate taxes, drove\n\nto Gambino’s office in Niles and gave him copies of the tax paid receipts and of the title\n\ncompany checks, and $25,000 in cash and cashier’s checks (Sal could not recall what\n\nportion of the $25,000 was in currency or cashier’s checks). Sal obtained the deed at\n\n                                             11\n\fKoonce’s office on December 26, 2002, and had it recorded at the Cook County recorder\n\nof deed’s office in Markham, Illinois.\n\n       Within a month of the first transaction concerning the Niles Property, Sal\n\ncontacted investors, including Wolf, as funding sources for a loan on the Kedzie\n\nProperty. Wolf testified that he was not interested in lending money on the Kedzie\n\nProperty but that he telephoned an investor David Azran and asked Azran if he wanted to\n\nmake a loan. Azran agreed to do so through his company, 21st Century Financial\n\n(Century). Sal testified that he was introduced to Stephen Richek, Azran’s attorney.\n\n       Century purportedly loaned Gambino $200,000, through a sale and lease back of\n\nthe Kedzie Property, which was to include a purchase option to Gambino. Century was\n\nto hold title for a year, receive $3,000 per month pursuant to the purported lease,\n\nmaintain a reserve for interest, taxes, and insurance and funds to cover all the costs of the\n\nloan and the fees involved, and, if Gambino did not pay off the loan in a year, keep title.\n\n       Richek prepared the legal documentation for the transaction. Marc Smith was\n\nalso involved as attorney for the Wolfs in the transaction, and prepared some of the\n\ndocumentation. Estimates of redemption for the outstanding Kedzie Property real estate\n\ntaxes were obtained by Sal.\n\n       The closing took place on January 17, 2003. Sal delivered what purported to be a\n\ntrustee’s deed for the Kedzie Property conveying title to Gambino. Sal testified that he\n\npicked up closing documents from Koonce and the deed and other documents from\n\nGambino, and delivered them to Richek at Zippershtein’s office. He testified that he\n\nobtained a $200,000 check from Century at Zippershtien’s office and delivered it to\n\n\n\n                                             12\n\fKoonce. Azran was not at the closing. The lease purporting to have Gambino’s\n\nsignature was signed by Richek on behalf of the lessor.\n\n       The following disbursements were made at the January 17, 2003, closing relating\n\nto the Kedzie Property:\n\nCentury                       $9,250         (January rent ($3,000) & loan fee)\nSteven Wolf                   $6,250         (commitment fee)\nAdam Wolf                     $6,250         (loan fee)\nHarris Bank                   $30,274.83     (back taxes)\nMarc Smith                    $2,500         (attorney fees)\nZippershtein                  $6,250         (commitment fee)\nRichek                        $500           (attorney fees)\nChesterfield Insurance        $3,368         (insurance)\nLawyers Title                 $2,134\nTitle America                 $1,190         (title insurance)\nLease Payment                 $3,000         (February lease payment)\nNorman Trust Account          $25,000        (the disbursement sheet notes that this\n                                             amount was to “pay off investor.” At trial,\n                                             Sal admitted that this amount was used to\n                                             fund a settlement of a lawsuit against him\n                                             for fraud)\nCasale, Woodward & Bulls      $5,372.72      (attorney fees)\nLease Escrow                  $30,000        (10 months of lease payments)\nWater Certificate Escrow      $8,000\nJames Halle                   $16,000           (cash purportedly given to Gambino)\nMark Guillermo                $9,660.45         (cash purportedly given to Gambino)\nPapiese                       $25,000           (cash purportedly given to Gambino)\nGambino                       $10,000           (cash Gambino acknowledged he received)\n                              ----------------------------------------------------------\n                              $200,000          Total\n\nThe deed was recorded on January 23, 2003.\n\n       In January 2003, after the two aforementioned closings had already occurred,\n\nGambino returned the three North Star trustee’s deeds he had obtained in December 2002\n\nto North Star, which cancelled the deeds.\n\n\n\n\n                                            13\n\f       The first closing related to the Lavernge Property occurred on April 30, 2003, at\n\nLawyers Title. A mortgage lien in favor of LaSalle Bank existed on the Lavergne\n\nProperty.\n\n       Prior to closing, Koonce applied for and obtained a $400,000 loan from Equity\n\nPlus. Equity Plus later assigned its mortgage to Countrywide Mortgage. Sal delivered a\n\ntrustee’s deed to Lawyers Title dated April 28, 2003, purporting to convey legal title on\n\nthe Lavergne Property from North Star as trustee to Koonce. Koonce transferred the\n\nassignment of rents from the leases on the four Lavergne Property apartments on May 1,\n\n2003, to Countrywide.\n\n       The following disbursements were made on the refinancing:\n\nLaSalle Bank                  $219,551.03    (mortgage loan payoff)\nEquity Plus                   $1,093.11      (loan fees)\nBoulevard                     $850           (loan application and processing fees)\nLawyers Title                 $930           (closing and underwriting fees)\nRecording Fees                $114\nChesterfield Insurance        $3,628            (insurance premium)\nKoonce                        $32,926.71        (payment escrow for mortgage payments for\n                                                one year)\nSBC Ameritech                 $4,470            (for Gambino’s past due account)\nEquity Plus                   $3,337.15         (loan fees)\nCountrywide Funding           $3,100            (loan fees)\nHarris Bank                   $10,000           (cash purportedly given to Gambino)\nEnzo                          $10,000           (cash purportedly given to Gambino)\nEnzo                          $110,000          (wired funds purportedly given to Gambino)\n                              --------------------------------------------------------\n                              $400,000          Total\n\n       A second closing concerning the Lavergne Property occurred on December 17,\n\n2003, when Koonce refinanced the property for just over $400,000 from Washington\n\nMutual. Koonce applied for the loan as borrower and quitclaimed title to the Lavergne\n\nProperty to his mortgage company, Boulevard, on the day of closing.\n\n\n                                            14\n\f       At closing, the balance of the Countrywide loan, $399,896.60, was paid. Overdue\n\nreal estate taxes, in the amount of $2,487.83, were also paid. Settlement charges,\n\nincluding loan fees, interest, title charges, and recording fees, were paid in the amount of\n\n$3,222.05.\n\n       A second closing also occurred when the Kedzie Property was refinanced in\n\nDecember 2003. Century had not been paid on its mortgage for the loan it made on the\n\nKedzie Property. In December 2003, Sal met with Wolf and told him that Century was\n\ngoing to take title to the Kedzie Property, and asked if Wolf would provide a loan to\n\nprevent its loss. Wolf testified that he met with Sal and Gambino, and that during that\n\nmeeting Gambino told him that Sal was authorized to act on his behalf with regard to any\n\nloan secured by the Kedzie Property. Wolf made the loan through his company, WW\n\nFunding.\n\n       The transaction was structured so that the Century loan would be repaid and the\n\nproperty would be conveyed to WW Funding as collateral for the loan. WW Funding\n\nborrowed $350,000 from Plaza Bank, took title to the property, paid the Century\n\nmortgage, and granted an option to purchase the property to Koonce. The option\n\nprovided that if the loan from Plaza was paid within a year, WW Funding would convey\n\ntitle to Koonce. Sal testified that he received a document prepared by Richek or Marc\n\nSmith assigning the purchase option, under the lease of the Kedzie Property from\n\nCentury to Gambino (as noted, the first transaction involving the Kedzie Property was\n\nstructured as a “sale/leaseback”), to WW Funding. Sal testified that he obtained\n\nGambino’s signature on that document and returned the executed assignment to either\n\nRichek or Smith.\n\n                                             15\n\f       The following disbursements were made on this refinancing:\n\n\nTax Escrow                     $1,988.14         (for payment of future real estate taxes)\nPlaza Bank                     $5,250            (loan fees)\nPlaza Bank                     $200              (loan document preparation fees)\nFlood Certificate              $15\nTax Service Fee                $50\nCentury                        $218,008.49       (mortgage loan payoff)\nMarc Smith                     $42,000           (escrow for monthly rent payments under\n                                                 agreement granting Koonce purchase\n                                                 option)\nWW Funding                     $33,738.74        (“cash to borrower”)\nWW Funding                     $25,800           (commitment fee & $800 insurance\n                                                 payment)\nLawyers Title                  $2,380            (recording fees, tax transfer stamps)\nTitle America                  $2,511.50         (settlement & title insurance)\nCook County Collector          $17,808.13        (back real estate taxes)\nWater Certificate              $250\n                               ---------------------------------------------------------------\n                               $350,000          Total\n\n       A second closing related to the Niles Property for refinancing occurred in June\n\n2004. The December 2002 Zippershtein loan had not been paid. Fritzshall sent a letter to\n\nGambino in December 2003, demanding payment. On January 16, 2004, Gambino sent a\n\nletter to Fritzshall, denying the existence of the loan. Zippershtein filed a mortgage\n\nforeclosure action and later voluntarily dismissed the case. Link testified that in 2004,\n\nGambino told him that the foreclosure action filed by Zippershtein was being dismissed\n\nbecause “somebody had paid off the loan.” An agreed order of dismissal entered in that\n\naction stated that the “debt at issue was paid in full.”\n\n       Koonce testified that Enzo, who had planned on acquiring Gambino’s business\n\nand the buildings housing the business, desired an option to purchase the business and\n\nproperty. The transaction was structured as a refinance, with WW Funding borrowing\n\n$445,000, to pay off the Zippershtein mortgage, and providing Koonce with an option to\n\n                                               16\n\fpurchase the property for $230,000. Koonce testified that the option was actually for\n\nGambino’s benefit, because Gambino had financial issues and did not have enough credit\n\nto structure a deal. Koonce was creditworthy and would be able to secure financing to\n\n“save” the property.\n\n       An agreement purportedly signed by Gambino allowed WW Funding to acquire\n\ntitle to the Niles Property and grant an option to Koonce to purchase the property for\n\n$230,000, the amount necessary to pay off the Zippershtein loan. Sal testified that he\n\nobtained Gambino’s signature on the agreement, and also had him sign a warranty deed\n\nto WW Funding that he had notarized. Sal further testified that Gambino signed a power\n\nof attorney authorizing Sal to sign any documents necessary to complete the transaction.\n\n       The closing occurred at Attorneys Title. Sal signed documents on behalf of\n\nGambino, including the HUD statement. WW Funding borrowed $445,000 from Plaza\n\nBank, took title to the property, and paid off the Zippershtein mortgage.\n\n       The following disbursements were made at closing:\n\nZippershtein                  $231,680.08       (mortgage loan payoff)\nPullman Bank                  $6,675            (commitment fee)\nPlaza Bank                    $830              (closing fees)\nPlaza Bank                    $45,000           (underground tank removal escrow)\nReal Estate Capital Corp.     $6,675            (commitment fee (Adam Wolf’s brokerage\n                                                firm))\nCounty Taxes                  $7,535.88         (real estate taxes)\nAttorney Title                $2,636.50         (state & county stamps, title insurance, etc.)\nRecording Fees                $82\nCourier                       $30\nMarc Smith                    $7,500            (attorney fees)\nWater Certificate             $1,184.16\nBalance to WW Funding         $135,171.38\n                              ------------------------------------------------------------\n                              $445,000          Total\n\nGambino received nothing.\n\n                                              17\n\f       In July 2004, after the claimed refinancing of the Niles Property, Gambino\n\nrefused to allow workers to remove the underground tanks. In the fall of 2004, Enzo, Sal,\n\nand Gambino met with Gambino’s first cousin Thomas Gambino (Thomas), who also is\n\nSal and Enzo’s uncle, in an attempt to resolve some of the problems they were having.\n\nThomas testified that at the meeting, Gambino confirmed that he had discussed selling\n\nthe subject properties with Sal and Enzo, and had agreed to let Sal sell one of his\n\nproperties, and if that worked out to proceed with the others, and talked with Enzo about\n\npurchasing United.\n\n       At the meeting, Thomas testified that Gambino said that he wanted his properties\n\nback. Sal said he could not make that happen at that time; the deal had to be completed\n\nor Gambino would lose everything.\n\n       In December 2004, Gambino executed a letter to Enzo and Sal “to stop all activity\n\nrelating to the pending business transaction involving the businesses and properties.”\n\nWhen Enzo was cleaning up the Kedzie Property in February 2005, Gambino called the\n\npolice and Enzo was charged with criminal trespass. Enzo was found not guilty after a\n\nbench trial. In March 2005, Gambino and North Star filed this action.\n\n                                          3. Trial\n\n       The following testimony was presented at trial.\n\n                                    a. Plaintiffs’ Witnesses\n\n       Gambino’s widow, Catherine, was called as a witness at trial. She testified that\n\nshe was married to Gambino on November 15, 1952, and that the two remained married\n\nuntil Gambino’s death in 2006. After serving in the military for approximately 10 years,\n\n\n\n                                             18\n\fGambino started a transmission repair business (United) in the 1960s at the Kedzie\n\nProperty.\n\n        Catherine testified that she was familiar with Gambino’s signature. She identified\n\nplaintiff’s exhibit No. 44, which contained a series of handwriting samples, marked K1\n\nthrough K36, which she identified as her husband’s signature. She then reviewed\n\nplaintiff’s exhibits Nos. 5 through 43, which consisted of legal documents purportedly\n\nsigned by Gambino concerning the subject properties. She testified that the signatures\n\ncontained on the documents were not Gambino’s signatures.\n\n        On cross-examination, Catherine testified without objection that she was aware\n\nthat Gambino spoke to Sal and Enzo regarding business matters, but did not know the\n\ndetails of those conversations. She identified her signature as well as Gambino’s\n\nsignature on a mortgage loan commitment dated November 29, 2002, signed by Sal on\n\nbehalf of Boulevard relating to the procurement of a mortgage on her residence.\n\nCatherine testified that Gambino was attempting to obtain loans due to financial\n\ndifficulties he was experiencing, including back taxes owed to the IRS.\n\n        Maritza Castillo testified at trial. She testified that she was employed by North\n\nStar as trust officer for six years prior to the trial in this matter. She testified that\n\nGambino was the sole beneficiary of the land trusts held by North Star under trust\n\nagreement Nos. 13534, 23985, and 23994, until the time of his death. Castillo identifed\n\nthree trustee’s deeds purportedly executed by her and Phyllis Robinson, vice president of\n\nNorth Star. She testified that the signatures bearing her name and Robinson’s were not\n\ngenuine, and that the trustee’s deeds were not authentic. She also identified a trust\n\nagreement purportedly signed by her as trust officer, dated April 9, 1962, pertaining to\n\n                                                19\n\fthe Lavergne Property, which showed Koonce as the sole beneficiary of the land trust.\n\nShe testified that the land trust agreement was not authentic and that the signature on the\n\ntrust agreement bearing her name was not genuine.\n\n         On cross-examination, Castillo identified three canceled trustee’s deeds executed\n\nat Gambino’s direction in December 2002 regarding the subject properties. Prior to their\n\ncancellation, the trustee’s deeds conveyed legal title from North Star to Gambino.\n\nCastillo testified without objection that Gambino directed North Star to convey him legal\n\ntitle because he planned to refinance the subject properties, but he returned the\n\ndocuments to North Star a few weeks later and directed North Star to cancel them. On\n\nfurther cross-examination, Castillo testified that there was no way that one could\n\ndetermine that the trustee’s deeds from North Star were forged by simply viewing the\n\ndeeds.\n\n         Phyllis Robinson also testified at trial. She was retired at the time of trial, but\n\npreviously was vice president of North Star. Her testimony echoed that of Castillo; she\n\nidentifed three trustee’s deeds purportedly executed by her and Castillo. She testified\n\nthat the signatures bearing her name and Castillo’s name were not genuine.\n\n         Pritikin was then called as a witness and testified that he was an accountant\n\nlicensed to practice before the IRS in representing the interests of taxpayers as an\n\n“enrolled agent.” Pritikin testified that Gambino retained him in June 2002 to represent\n\nhim with regard to “payroll tax problems.” He testified that Gambino and United owed\n\nthe IRS between $125,000 and $150,000. Pritikin told Gambino that the IRS could shut\n\nUnited down if the tax liability was not settled. Pritikin testified that Gambino told him\n\n\n\n                                               20\n\fthat he was going to borrow money against some of his properties with the assistance of\n\nSal so that he could settle United’s liability with the IRS.\n\n       Pritikin testified that Gambino directed him to speak with Sal in November 2002,\n\nand Sal told him he was employed by Boulevard and could obtain loans on Gambino’s\n\nproperties. Sal sent Pritikin via facsimile a loan commitment from Boulevard showing\n\nGambino approved for a loan signed by Sal.\n\n       On August 7, 2003, Pritikin spoke with Sal requesting documentation regarding a\n\nrefinance or sale of Gambino’s properties because the IRS was threatening to seize\n\nUnited. Pritikin testified that he never received any documentation from Sal regarding a\n\nrefinance or sale of the subject properties.\n\n       Stephen Link, an attorney since 1995, was called as a witness. He testified that he\n\nwas Gambino’s counsel from 2002 until shortly after the instant case was filed, when he\n\nwithdrew. Link testified that he was never made aware that any loans were procured on\n\nthe subject properties. Link filed an appearance in the Zippershtein foreclosure suit, and\n\nwhen the suit was dismissed, Gambino was “surprised” and told Link that “someone had\n\npaid off the mortgage.”\n\n       Sal was then called by plaintiffs as an adverse witness. Sal testified that at the\n\ntime of trial, he was unemployed. He testified that he never held employment where he\n\nearned a salary or wage, and had never received unemployment benefits. He testified\n\nthat he had been living on moneys borrowed or gifted from family members. Sal\n\ntestified that he had not held a bank account for approximately 12 to 15 years, and that he\n\nconducted all his financial transactions in cash and on rare occasions by cashier’s check.\n\nSal identified the loan commitment sent to Pritikin by facsimile transmission, on\n\n                                               21\n\fBoulevard letterhead, and identified his signature on the document above the signature\n\nline as the “authorized signature.”\n\n       Sal testified that had known Koonce since the fall of 2001 and that Koonce was\n\nan attorney and owned both Boulevard and Title America. Sal testified that he never\n\nrepresented to anyone that he worked for Boulevard. Sal testified that he and Enzo “had\n\na couple of business transactions going on” with Koonce regarding Gambino. He\n\ntestified that Koonce lent money to both him and Enzo and they gave the funds totalling\n\n$180,000 to Gambino.\n\n       Sal testified that his role in the transactions described in the plaintiffs’ complaint\n\nwas limited, but admitted he attended at least five of the closings at issue. He was shown\n\nall the documents that plaintiffs claimed had forgeries of Gambino’s signatures; of the\n\ndocuments he recognized, he claimed that all of them were signed by Gambino in his\n\npresence. Sal identified the notary of Gambino’s signature on all of the contested\n\ndocuments as that of Regina Brophy, who worked as a legal secretary for the Cook\n\nCounty public defender’s office in Markham, Illinois, where Sal’s uncle, Thomas\n\nGambino, was employed as a supervisor of criminal investigations. Sal testified that it\n\nwas his practice to have Gambino sign the documents at United’s Niles location, drive\n\nthe documents to Brophy in Markham, together with a copy of Gambino’s driver’s\n\nlicense, and present it to her to be notarized.\n\n       Sal testified that he never kept any money for his participation in the various\n\ntransactions involving the subject properties. When Sal was first approached by\n\nGambino in the fall of 2002 about refinancing his properties, Gambino signed various\n\nauthorizations allowing Sal to obtain Gambino’s credit report. He also received a list of\n\n                                              22\n\fGambino’s properties, showing their value and mortgage indebtedness. The listing\n\nshowed that the Niles Property had an estimated value of $550,000 with no mortgage\n\ndebt, the Kedzie property had an estimated value of $1.2 million with no mortgage debt,\n\nand the Lavergne Property had an estimated value of $450,000 with a mortgage debt of\n\n$223,000.\n\n       Sal testified that he and Wolf were present at the December 20, 2002, closing.\n\nSal testified that Gambino had signed all the relevant legal documents prior to the\n\nclosing. Sal testified that he prepared the accounting of the funds distributed at the\n\nDecember 20, 2002, closing. He testified that the accounting showed that Koonce earned\n\nan attorney’s fee of $750, Enzo received a check for $5,000 for the appraisal, and that he\n\nreceived a check for $25,000 which he converted to cash and gave to Gambino.\n\n       Sal testified that he made loans to Gambino, totaling $770,000, but could not\n\nprovide an accounting. Sal testified that Gambino owed him a balance between $150,000\n\nand $200,000.\n\n       In early 2005, Sal worked with WW Funding, which held title the Kedzie\n\nProperty and had the locks changed. Sal also testified that he made repairs to the\n\nLavergne Property after Boulevard had acquired title to the property.\n\n       Sal deposited a cashier’s check payable to Gambino for $42,586.09 into one of\n\nGambino’s accounts concerning the Niles Property. Sal identified a check that Gambino\n\npaid to either Sal or Enzo for unpaid property taxes in the amount of $24,067.48, which\n\nshowed up in a deposit into Enzo’s account of $24,067.48 on December 30, 2002, and\n\nshowed no withdrawals on that date.\n\n\n\n                                             23\n\f       Sal testified that Gambino was not at the Kedzie closing but had signed all the\n\nclosing documents in Sal’s presence, and Sal then delivered the documents to the closing.\n\n       Sal was shown an entry on the disbursement sheet of a $25,000 payment made to\n\nthe “Norman Trust Account” to “payoff investor.” At first, Sal testified that the Norman\n\nTrust payment constituted repayment of an investor on behalf of Gambino, but then\n\nadmitted this payment was made to fund a settlement of a suit against him for fraud.\n\n       The parties stipulated that a $25,000 cashier’s check drawn on Title America’s\n\naccount at Harris Bank payable to Enzo’s girlfriend Kathleen Papiese was funds\n\ndeposited into Papiese’s bank account and that Enzo was a signatory to that account.\n\n       Sal testified that a payment of fees to a law firm Casale, Woodward & Bulls for\n\n$5,372.72 was not for Gambino’s benefit, although it originated from a mortgage placed\n\non the Kedzie Property.\n\n       Sal testified that he prepared the April 30, 2003, disbursements on the Lavergne\n\nProperty, claiming that $130,000 in cash was given to Gambino.\n\n       Sal admitted that no funds were given to Gambino from the Kedzie Property\n\nclosing. Checks were written to Marc Smith, which were ultimately disbursed to WW\n\nFunding. Plaza Bank provided the financing for this transaction. Sal testified that he\n\nalso procured Gambino’s signature on an assignment of an option that allowed WW\n\nFunding to acquire the Kedzie Property by paying off the Century loan.\n\n       Sal claimed Gambino had given him a power of attorney for the Niles Property.\n\nSal signed the HUD statement, in which $135,171.38 was disbursed to WW Funding. No\n\nfunds were written to Gambino. In this transaction, WW Funding purportedly purchased\n\n\n\n                                            24\n\fthe Niles Property from Gambino for $230,000 based on a contract on which Sal claimed\n\nhe had procured Gambino’s signature.\n\n       Regina Brophy, a 25-year legal secretary for the office of the Cook County public\n\ndefender in Markham, testified at trial. She is a notary public who worked with Thomas\n\nGambino. She testified she notarized signatures for Sal without ever seeing the people\n\nwho signed the documents or knowing whether they were genuine. She testified, “I just\n\ntrusted him.”\n\n       Thomas Gambino testified that he was a supervisor of criminal investigations in\n\nthe public defender’s Markham office. Sal and Enzo are his nephews. He testified that\n\nhe attended a meeting in late 2004 with Gambino, Enzo and Sal, at Enzo’s request, to\n\nhelp Enzo “straighten out” some problems he and Sal were having with Gambino. He\n\ntestified that his role at this meeting was as a mediator, because whatever business deals\n\nSal and Enzo had with Gambino were nearing a “complete breakdown.”\n\n       Thomas testified that Gambino explained he had engaged in conversations with\n\nSal and Enzo about selling his properties and possibly retiring when Gambino received\n\nnotification from his bank that one of his properties had been sold without his\n\nknowledge, and he ordered them to stop doing anything further. Gambino said that he\n\ngave Sal and Enzo permission to sell one of his properties, but Thomas did not identify\n\nwhich property Gambino was referring to.\n\n       Sal said Gambino “was confused and did not quite understand how the deal was\n\nput together.” When asked how it was that Gambino had lost control of his properties,\n\nSal said “that it had to be part of the deal because [the investors had] to have more\n\nassurance and *** more property,” in order for the deal to proceed. Sal said that he had\n\n                                             25\n\fgiven Gambino $60,000 in “good faith” money and that more moneys would be paid\n\nGambino at “the close of the deal.”\n\n       Gambino requested his properties back and Sal told Gambino the deals were\n\n“nonreversible.” Sal said the investors “were people that you don’t fool around with\n\nonce [you] make a deal.”\n\n       Steven Fritzshall, a licensed attorney since 1981, was then called as a witness. He\n\nrepresented Zippershtein in connection with the mortgage on the Niles Property. In\n\nconnection with this transaction he testified that Koonce claimed that he was Gambino’s\n\nattorney.\n\n       In December 2003, Fritzshall wrote to Gambino regarding a default on the\n\nZippershtein mortgage. Gambino responded, “In response to your letter, I have told Mr.\n\nZippershtein several times the loan you are referring to was not made by me. I did not\n\nreceive any loan from Mr. Zippershtein. The loans you are referring to are not valid.”\n\n       Barry Mullin testified that in 2003, he was employed as a personal banker for\n\nLaSalle Bank/ABN Amro, which had held a mortgage on the Lavergne Property.\n\nGambino asked him to find out how his loan had been paid. Mullin called Koonce, who\n\n“informed [Mullin] he had paid off the mortgage because [the property] had been deeded\n\nto him.”\n\n       David Azran testified that he was the sole shareholder of Century, which was the\n\nlender involved in the first transaction related to the Kedzie Property. He made the loan\n\nas a result of a call he received from Zippershtein and Wolf. They told him the\n\ntransaction was a “sale/leaseback” of $200,000, with interest at 18% per year. The\n\ntransaction was structured so that if the borrower did not pay the loan within a year,\n\n                                             26\n\fCentury would have the right to retain title to the property given to it as security for the\n\ndebt. He testified that, Azran, Wolf, and Zippershtein agreed to share in ownership if the\n\npurchase option was never exercised.\n\n        Phillip Cali testified that he was an independent agent for Service Insurance\n\nAgents and was Gambino’s insurance agent. Cali testified that the certificate of\n\ninsurance concerning the Niles Property was not authentic and did not bear his signature.\n\n        Rogelio Llamedo testified that he owned, developed and managed property in\n\nChicago. He met Gambino in early 2006. Llamedo testified, over an objection under the\n\nDead-Man’s Act (735 ILCS 5/8-201 (West 2006)), that on January 12, 2006, he entered\n\ninto a contract to purchase the Kedzie Property from Gambino for $1.4 million. On that\n\ndate, Llamedo also entered into a contract to purchase the house adjacent to the Kedzie\n\nProperty. It was his intent to develop the properties. He testified that he had the\n\nfinancial ability to close on the contract to purchase the Kedzie Property in January 2006\n\nand retained that ability at the time of trial.\n\n        Diane Marsh, a forensic document examiner, was qualified as an expert\n\nhandwriting witness. She compared Gambino’s known handwriting samples with the\n\nquestioned documents at issue. Marsh testified that experts in her field utilize a hierarchy\n\nof conclusions, ranging from the most certain to the least certain. The highest degree of\n\nconfidence is called an identification, which means that the forensic document examiner\n\nhas no reservations concerning the authenticity of the signature. In expressing her\n\nopinion regarding the authenticity of the suspect signatures, Marsh utilized the highest\n\nlevel of certainty.\n\n\n\n                                                  27\n\f       Marsh described at length the procedures she followed in reaching her conclusion\n\nand the basis for the three separate reports she issued in the case. Marsh’s examination\n\ninvolved the detection of possible autoforgery, which are instances “where somebody\n\ntries to disguise their own signature so they can deny it later.” Simulations, on the other\n\nhand, are signatures of a third party meant to appear authentic. She testified that it is\n\nextremely difficult to create a series of autoforgeries that could escape detection. Her\n\nconclusion was, “Mr. Gambino did not disguise his own signatures,” and the 39\n\nsignatures contained on plaintiffs’ exhibits Nos. 5 through 43 were not Gambino’s. It\n\nwas also her opinion that all but one of the questioned documents were signed by the\n\nsame person, and that the one questioned document was also not signed by Gambino.\n\n       On cross-examination Marsh testified that the handwriting samples that she\n\nconsidered in reaching her opinion were all tendered by Gambino, and that she did not\n\nuse the retainer check for her services as one of the samples in reaching her opinion.\n\n       Dennis Koonce, a licensed attorney since 1986, was called as an adverse witness.\n\nKoonce is the sole shareholder of Title America and Boulevard. Title America acted as\n\nthe “policy issuing agent” for five of the six transactions. The one exception was the\n\nsecond transaction related to the Niles Property.\n\n       Koonce was shown the loan application in connection with the first Lavergne\n\nclosing, dated April 30, 2003. Koonce signed it and certified the accuracy of the\n\ninformation; in it, he listed the Lavergne Property as one of his own properties, claiming\n\nhe had acquired it in 1995. The application for the loan was submitted as a refinance. He\n\nwas then shown a purported trust agreement between Koonce and North Star as trust No.\n\n13534, dated April 9, 1962, signed by Koonce. Koonce was shown copies of leases\n\n                                             28\n\fpertaining to the Lavergne Property when he was the lessor, although the dates of the\n\nleases preceded the first transaction concerning the Lavergne Property. Koonce\n\nidentified his signature on the leases.\n\n       Koonce identified the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) form from\n\nthe closing concerning the refinancing transaction of the Lavergne Property on December\n\n17, 2003, which he signed. He identified a similar set of leases that had been submitted\n\nto Washington Mutual regarding the Lavergne Property, and a mortgage loan application\n\nsigned by him for $800,000 regarding the Niles and Kedzie Properties. He testified that,\n\nin the schedule listing real estate owned, he had listed the Niles, Kedzie and Lavergne\n\nProperties as his own.\n\n       Koonce identified his agreement with WW Funding to acquire the Niles and\n\nKedzie Properties granting him an option to acquire the properties after WW Funding\n\nhad paid off Century and Zippershtein. Koonce testified that he had entered into this\n\nseries of agreements for the benefit of Gambino. He claimed “the money that I advanced\n\nto [Gambino] was going to be lost and these properties were not saved so in an effort to\n\nsave them yes I did and [Gambino] did nothing to preserve that.”\n\n       Enzo was then called as an adverse witness. Enzo was asked about the funds\n\nshown as being disbursed to him and to his girlfriend from various transactions, and he\n\nadmitted receiving them.\n\n       Stephen Wolf was then called as an adverse witness. He had been a real estate\n\ninvestor for 40 years. Wolf said he never paid Gambino anything when he acquired the\n\nKedzie Property from Century or when he acquired the Niles Property by paying off the\n\nZippershtein loan. Wolf estimated the value of the Niles Property as between $550,000\n\n                                            29\n\fand $700,000. He testified that Gambino’s name appeared nowhere in connection with\n\nthe various option agreements granted to Koonce.\n\n        Wolf testified he met with Gambino prior to the refinancing transaction on the\n\nKedzie Property, prior to granting Koonce an option. He said that during this meeting,\n\nno terms were discussed, but he had requested that, if a problem arose, Gambino should\n\ncontact him. Wolf testified that Gambino was not accompanied by an attorney. Wolf\n\nidentified an outline of the agreement WW Funding was to have with Koonce regarding\n\nthe Kedzie Property. Wolf did not have Gambino sign it to indicate his assent. Wolf\n\nadmitted that he never attempted to communicate with Gambino when problems arose\n\nconcerning the Koonce option.\n\n        Joseph M. Gambino was the independent administrator of his father’s estate. He\n\nhad worked at the transmission shop his father operated at the Kedzie Property and was\n\nfamiliar with the manner in which Gambino carried on his business. He was familiar\n\nwith Gambino’s signature and had observed him sign documents many times. He was\n\nshown the signatures on plaintiffs’ exhibits Nos. 5 through 43, and he testified that the\n\nsignatures were not his father’s.\n\n                                    b. Defense Witnesses\n\n        Enzo testified that he met with Gambino in 2002. He testified, over an objection\n\nunder the Dead-Man’s Act, that Gambino agreed to the purchase price of $2.8 million for\n\nthe subject properties and the house adjacent to the Kedzie Property, which Gambino also\n\nowned. To raise the money, Sal introduced Enzo to Koonce, to help him obtain\n\nfinancing. Gambino told Enzo he did not have books that would substantiate his business\n\nprofit and loss.\n\n                                             30\n\f        Plaintiffs’ exhibit No. 151 was a listing of checks Enzo received, which he\n\nclaimed he had cashed and the proceeds of which he had given to Gambino, either in the\n\nform of currency or cashier’s checks. Enzo never obtained a receipt.\n\n        Enzo thought he was going to be taking over Gambino’s business in January of\n\n2003. However, he testified that Gambino decided not to allow him to assume control.\n\nInspections were performed on the Kedzie Property and Gambino allowed the inspection.\n\nEnzo testified that the $25,000 received by Enzo’s girlfriend was later converted to cash,\n\ncashier’s checks or money orders and delivered to Gambino.\n\n        Regarding the wire transfer of $110,000 to his account from the first closing\n\nconcerning the Lavergne Property, Enzo testified he delivered these funds to Gambino in\n\ncash.\n\n        After Enzo met with Gambino and Thomas Gambino in late 2004, he went to the\n\nKedzie Property to “clean-up.” At the same time, he also applied for a business license\n\nand had several meetings with Gambino. In February 2005, Gambino “had [him]\n\narrested for trespassing.” Enzo made arrangements to move underground storage tanks at\n\nthe Niles Property in July 2004. Enzo identified various permits he obtained from\n\ngovernmental agencies regarding work to be performed at the Niles and Kedzie\n\nProperties.\n\n        On cross-examination, Enzo was unable to recall any document signed by\n\nGambino memorializing any agreement between Gambino and Enzo or Sal with regard to\n\nthe subject properties. Enzo admitted receiving a letter from Gambino dated December\n\n16, 2004, to cease any activity with regard to the subject properties. In February 2005,\n\n\n\n                                            31\n\fEnzo had the locks changed at the Kedzie Property at the instruction of WW Funding.\n\nEnzo did not believe that Gambino had any further interest in the building at the time.\n\n       Sal also testified in defendants’ case-in-chief and identified a credit report that he\n\nhad obtained concerning Gambino. Based upon that credit report, Sal made inquiries to\n\nAdam Wolf to find a collateral-based lender, and Adam recommended his father. Sal\n\nmet with Wolf, who told him that Zippershtein would be interested in making such a\n\nloan. Sal testified that he was present in December 2003 when Wolf met with Gambino\n\nand when Gambino authorized Sal to act on his behalf.\n\n       Koonce also testified in defendants’ case-in-chief and testified that he never told\n\nanyone he represented Gambino. He testified that he had no knowledge that the trustee’s\n\ndeeds may have been forged. Koonce identified the back real estate taxes owed on\n\nseveral of the subject properties, insurance certificates regarding the properties and\n\nvarious payments he made regarding the Lavergne Property.\n\n       The trial court ruled that although Gambino had died during the course of his\n\ndiscovery deposition and had not signed the transcript of his deposition or been afforded\n\nan opportunity to examine the transcript to make corrections, sections of his deposition\n\nwould be admitted into evidence, not as binding judicial admissions, but as evidentiary\n\nadmissions by a party opponent. These admissions were then read into the record.\n\n       At his discovery deposition, Gambino admitted to having North Star execute\n\ntrustee’s deeds conveying legal title to him, but that he later had those deeds cancelled.\n\nGambino admitted receiving two checks for $10,000 each on January 8, 2003, and\n\nJanuary 28, 2003, from Sal. He also admitted receiving a check for $42,586.09, but\n\nclaimed that Sal requested a check from him for $24,067.48 in return. He also admitted\n\n                                             32\n\freceiving cash from Sal or Enzo on two occasions; one for $5,000, and another for\n\n$2,000. Further, he admitted to accompanying the appraiser through the Niles Property\n\nduring the late 2002 appraisal.\n\n        Stephen Wolf testified in defendants’ case-in-chief that he became involved in the\n\ntransactions at issue through his son, Adam. At that time, he shared an office with\n\nZippershtein. He testified that he had a meeting with Gambino and Zippershtein\n\nimmediately before the first transaction concerning the Niles Property and received a fee,\n\nand then another fee concerning the Kedzie Property. He never became aware of any\n\nclaim that Gambino’s signature was forged.\n\n        In December 2003, Sal approached Wolf requesting a loan secured by the Kedzie\n\nProperty. Wolf made arrangements with Plaza for funding that transaction, and prior to\n\nclosing, met with Gambino. As part of that transaction, an option was given to Koonce\n\nto acquire the property by repaying the interest, fees and principal balance of WW\n\nFunding’s loan. The option was given to Koonce, not Gambino, because Koonce was\n\ncreditworthy. Sal told him that Gambino had no problem with the arrangement.\n\n                                4. The Trial Court’s Findings\n\n        The trial court rendered its “Findings of Fact and Judgment after Trial” in a 21-\n\npage written memorandum opinion and order. The trial court found in favor of plaintiffs\n\non all counts of plaintiffs’ complaint to quiet title and for slander of title.\n\n        The trial court found that plaintiffs’ evidence was overwhelming that the\n\npurported trustee’s deeds conveying title to the subject properties were forged, which\n\nevidence included the testimony of Castillo and Robinson that they had not signed the\n\ntrustee’s deeds used to effectuate the disputed conveyances, and the testimony of Brophy,\n\n                                               33\n\fwho admitted to notarizing the trustee’s deeds, as well as approximately 40 other\n\ndocuments used to accomplish the disputed conveyances, at the request of Sal without\n\nseeing the signatories or recognizing the signatories’ signatures. The trial court also\n\nfound the expert testimony of Marsh “extremely credible, thoroughly articulated, and\n\nwell-supported.” The trial court found that defendants offered no evidence to refute this\n\ntestimony. Further, the trial court discounted Sal’s testimony, including the portions\n\nrelated to Gambino signing the disputed documents, finding it to “be zero in all respects.”\n\n        Further, the trial court found that by their acts Sal, Enzo, Koonce, Boulevard,\n\nTitle America, Wolf, and WW Funding had slandered plaintiffs’ title to the Kedzie and\n\nNiles Properties. With respect to the Lavergne Property, the trial court found that by\n\ntheir acts Sal, Enzo, Koonce, Boulevard, and Title America had slandered plaintiffs’ title.\n\nIn its order, the trial court deferred its findings as to compensatory damages until a later\n\ndate and ordered plaintiffs’ attorneys to submit a fee petition. The trial court did assess\n\npunitive damages in the following amounts on November 30, 2007: the trial court\n\nimposed punitive damages against Enzo, Sal, and the Koonce defendants, jointly and\n\nseverally, in the amount of $500,000, and against Wolf and WW Funding, jointly and\n\nseverally, in the amount of $175,000.\n\n        On May 2, 2008, the trial court issued a seven-page memorandum opinion and\n\norder where it awarded compensatory damages to plaintiffs.5 In its memorandum opinion\n\nand order, the trial court described plaintiffs’ petition for attorney fees. The trial court\n\nindicated that the suit was brought when Gambino was still alive. Link was the attorney\n\n        5\n            The trial court’s May 2, 2008, order also denied two Illinois Supreme Court Rule\n\n137 petitions for sanctions. 155 Ill. 2d R. 137.\n\n                                              34\n\fengaged for the lawsuit. He drafted the originally filed complaint and a motion for\n\ntemporary restraining order. The fee arrangement between Link and Gambino was set at\n\nan hourly rate of $185. Link submitted a copy of his billings for the period of March 1,\n\n2005, to March 15, 2005, totaling $7,085.\n\n       Shortly after the filing of the lawsuit, Gambino engaged additional counsel, Sam\n\nAmirante. On March 22, 2005, Gambino agreed to a $10,000 retainer and a contingency\n\nfee of one-third of any recovery. Link and Amirante withdrew their appearances on\n\nMarch 31, 2006. Arimante accepted the $10,000 and made no further claim for fees.\n\n       On March 31, 2006, Gambino engaged new counsel. New counsel were attorneys\n\nMichael Braun, Sherwin Winer, and Kevin O’Rouke. Initially, all three attorneys billed\n\nmonthly at an hourly rate. Within a short time, however, Gambino was unable to keep\n\ncurrent in paying his attorney fees. Counsel were unwilling to continue working on an\n\nhourly basis when their bills were not being paid and would not agree to deferring\n\npayment until the conclusion of the case. It was agreed that while billing would continue\n\non an hourly basis, all amounts unpaid would be treated under a contingency fee\n\nagreement. Specifically, all unpaid hourly fees would be paid at three times the amount\n\nbilled if and when the case reached successful conclusion. Costs were to be treated in the\n\nsame manner. The attorneys’ billings were attached to the fee petition. Braun billed at\n\n$205 per hour; Winer at $250 per hour; and O’Rouke at $150 per hour for out-of-court\n\ntime and $200 per hour for in-court time. A total of $187,196 in bills was unpaid and\n\nthus subject to the contingency enhancement.\n\n       The Koonce defendants and the Wolf defendants both objected to plaintiffs’\n\npetition for attorney fees. Both sets of defendants argued that no Illinois authority\n\n                                             35\n\fallowed the multiplier of three to be applied to the lodestar amount. Further, the Wolf\n\ndefendants argued that the petition failed to properly segregate the attorneys’ billings for\n\nplaintiff’s claims to quiet title and plaintiffs’ claims for slander of title. They argued that\n\nonly plaintiffs’ attorney fees incurred in quieting title were recoverable.\n\n        The trial court first rejected the Wolf defendants’ argument that only plaintiffs’\n\nattorney fees incurred for plaintiffs’ quiet title claims were compensable, finding that\n\nplaintiffs’ claims to quiet title and for slander of title were inextricably linked. The trial\n\ncourt then addressed the reasonableness of the attorney fees exclusive of the multiplier,\n\nand found that the attorneys’ hourly rates were reasonable. The trial court found all\n\nitemizations sufficiently detailed, noting its own familiarity with the entire context of the\n\ntrial court proceedings. The trial court found the time billed for each item appropriate,\n\nrecognizing the difficulties presented by the multidefendant, multiproperty case and the\n\nexpertise of plaintiffs’ counsel.\n\n        Finally, the trial court rejected defendants’ objections to the use of a multiplier of\n\nthree times the lodestar, finding that the measure was “imminently reasonable.” The trial\n\ncourt found that the hourly rates were modest and that the attorneys’ itemized time\n\nappropriate. Further, the trial court found that the fee was proportionate to the value of\n\nthe properties at issue, roughly $2.5 million.\n\n        Noting that the Wolf defendants had no involvement with respect to the contested\n\ntransactions related to the Lavergne Property, the trial court segregated the attorney fees\n\nincurred with respect to the Lavergne Property from the remainder of the petition and\n\nawarded the following accordingly: attorney fees in the form of compensatory damages\n\nin the amount of $595,574 on counts IV and VI of plaintiffs’ complaint, such damages\n\n                                              36\n\fimposed jointly and severally against Sal, Enzo, and the Koonce defendants; attorney\n\nfees in the form of compensatory damages in the amount of $556,485 on counts IV and\n\nVI on plaintiffs’ complaint, such damages imposed jointly and severally against Wolf\n\nand WW Funding; and attorney fees in the form of compensatory damages in the amount\n\nof $595,574 on count II of plaintiffs’ complaint, imposed jointly and severally against\n\nSal, Enzo, and the Koonce defendants. The court found that plaintiffs were to have only\n\none recovery of compensatory damages, and the judgments entered were not cumulative.\n\n                                   5. Notices of Appeal\n\n       As noted, multiple appeals were taken from the trial court’s November 30, 2007,\n\nand May 2, 2008, orders. The appeals were consolidated on this court’s own motion.\n\n       Sal and Enzo filed a timely notice of appeal, but have failed to file a brief with\n\nthis court. The Koonce defendants have appealed from both the November 30, 2007, and\n\nMay 2, 2008, orders and the judgments entered against them. The Koonce defendants\n\nraise no arguments with regard to the trial court’s finding against them on their\n\ncounterclaims, and as a result all arguments concerning their counterclaims are waived.\n\n210 Ill. 2d R. 341(h)(7). Wolf and WW Funding have appealed from both the November\n\n30, 2007, and May 2, 2008, orders and the judgments entered against them. Although\n\nWW Funding filed a notice of appeal from the trial court’s November 30, 2007, order,\n\nwhere the trial court found against its counterclaim to quiet title to the Kedzie and Niles\n\nproperties, WW Funding raises no argument with respect to those findings. Further, as\n\nnoted, at oral argument before this court, WW Funding explicitly waived any claims to\n\nquiet title to the Kedzie and Niles Properties. As such, any argument concerning its\n\ncounterclaim is waived. 210 Ill. 2d R. 341(h)(7). Plaza Bank has appealed the trial\n\n                                             37\n\fcourt’s judgment with respect to its finding to quiet title to the Niles Property.\n\nWashington Mutual (Washington Mutual did not file a notice of appeal from the trial\n\ncourt’s quiet title findings) and Plaza Bank filed a notice of appeal from the trial court’s\n\ndenial of their Rule 137 motion for sanctions. Plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal from the\n\ntrial court’s denial of their Rule 137 motion for sanctions.\n\n                                         ANALYSIS\n\n        On appeal, the defendants, collectively, raise a myriad of arguments with respect\n\nto the trial court’s findings. The Koonce defendants (Koonce, Boulevard, and Title\n\nAmerica) attack the trial court’s findings with respect to plaintiffs’ claims for quiet title\n\nand slander of title, and the trial court’s assessment of damages against them, including\n\nits assessment of compensatory damages for plaintiffs’ attorney fees and its assessment\n\nof punitive damages. The Wolf defendants (Wolf and WW Funding) only raise\n\narguments with respect to the trial court’s slander of title findings and its assessment of\n\ndamages against them, including its assessment of compensatory damages for plaintiffs’\n\nattorney fees and its assessment of punitive damages. Plaza Bank’s arguments on appeal\n\nconcern only the trial court’s findings with respect to plaintiffs’ claim to quiet title to the\n\nNiles Property.\n\n                                   1.

Quiet Title\n\n          We begin with the trial court’s findings with respect to plaintiffs’ quiet title\n\nclaims. As noted, counts I, III, and V, of plaintiffs’ complaint sought to quiet title to the\n\nsubject properties. On November 30, 2007, the trial court found in favor of the plaintiffs\n\non those counts based on its finding that the evidence at trial showed “overwhelming[ly]”\n\nthat the written instruments used to convey title to the subject properties from plaintiffs\n\nwere forgeries.\n\n\n\n                                                39\n\f        An action to quiet title in property is an equitable proceeding in which a party\n\nseeks to remove a cloud on his title to the property.

They argue that no evidence was presented as to the\n\ntitle of the subject properties “at any time, before or after the transfers,” and that the trial\n\ncourt’s quiet title findings should be reversed on this basis alone. This argument is not\n\npersuasive.\n\n          First, the Koonce defendants’ counterclaim verified by the sworn affidavit of\n\nKoonce alleged that “North Star *** held title to the [subject] properties in trust, with\n\nGambino as the beneficiary.” This binding judicial admission removed the question of\n\nthe validity of North Star’s title to the subject properties from contention.

The Koonce defendants, relying on the\n\ntestimony of Sal, argue that Gambino signed the contested documents in Sal’s presence.\n\nFirst, we note that the trial court found Sal’s credibility to be “zero” in all respects.

The\n\ntrial court found the contested documents were signed by someone other than Gambino\n\nfor the advantage of several defendants in the case at bar, including Sal, which illustrates\n\nan intent to defraud. “Intent to defraud is a question of fact, which may be proved by\n\ncircumstantial evidence and inferred from the facts and circumstances surrounding the\n\ntransaction.” People v.

In that case, the proof of an alleged forged deed was found sufficiently established\n\nby testimony of a handwriting expert that the signatures on a deed were not those of the\n\ndecedent and by testimony of a notary who affixed her signature and notary seal to the\n\ndeed. Like this case, in In re Estate of Bontkowski, the notary admitted that someone\n\nother than the signatory had given her the deed to notarize, that the signatory was not\n\npresent when she notarized the deeds, that she had never met the signatory, and that she\n\ndid not know the purported signatory’s signature. Based on that evidence, the appellate\n\ncourt affirmed the trial court’s findings that the elements of forgery had been met,\n\nincluding intent to defraud. In re Estate of Bontkowski, 337 Ill.

The Koonce defendants also point out that the trustee’s deeds that\n\nGambino did indeed request from North Star and the contested trustee’s deeds are mirror\n\nimages. They reason that this fact proves that Gambino provided and encouraged Sal\n\nwith the opportunity to forge the questioned trustee’s deeds. Again, when we analyze the\n\nsettlement documents on the subject properties, the disbursements appear to be tainted\n\nwith fraud. The Niles Property alone had $25,000 in commitment fees distributed to the\n\nWolfs and Zippershtein, a mortgage escrow of $33,000, which is unusual, a $5,000\n\nappraisal fee, and a payment to Sal of $25,000 that is questionable on its face. The\n\nKedzie settlement disbursements reveal commitment or loan fees of $18,750, a $25,000\n\npayment to “Norman Trust Account,” and $5,372.72 to a law firm not involved in the\n\nprocess, and over $50,000 to unknown people (Halle, Guillermo, and Papiese) and only\n\n$10,000 to Gambino, which should have indicated to the Koonce defendants that an\n\nexplanation was in order. The disbursements on the Lavergne Property, again, were just\n\nas bizarre with no funds going to Gambino and $120,000 to Enzo, with loan fees over\n\n$7,000, and an unexplained disbursement to Harris Bank for $10,000.\n\n       The Koonce defendant’s argument to the trial court was that Gambino was the\n\none who committed the fraud based on the fact that he may have shown the trustee’s\n\ndeeds from North Star to Sal. The trial court found that this “prove[d] nothing except\n\nthat by having in his possession such a deed *** Gambino provided [Sal, Enzo] and\n\nKoonce with the tools of their fraud.”\n\n       There was no credible evidence at trial to prove that Gambino authorized and/or\n\nratified the contested transactions. The Koonce defendants argue that Gambino received\n\nhundreds of thousands of dollars from the disputed transactions in cash, checks, and the\n\n                                            47\n\fpayment of bills and loans. They point out that Gambino told Thomas Gambino that he\n\nhad authorized Sal and Enzo to procure a loan on one of his properties. Further, they\n\npoint out that overdue real estate taxes were paid on the subject properties from the\n\nclosings. Further, they argue that Gambino’s response to the Zippershtein foreclosure\n\naction showed that Gambino ratified the transactions. They argue that Gambino, after\n\nbeing served with the foreclosure complaint, never filed a motion to dismiss or strike the\n\nforeclosure action, but simply allowed the mortgage to be paid.\n\n       First, the only testimony that Gambino actually received hundreds of thousands of\n\ndollars from the disputed transactions was the testimony of Sal and Enzo, which the trial\n\ncourt found to be not credible. Koonce testified that he signed numerous checks payable\n\nto Sal and Enzo for what he believed were loans to Gambino. Yet, Koonce, a lawyer and\n\nsophisticated real estate investor, never discussed the matter with Gambino or obtained\n\nany receipts of the moneys he paid to Sal or Enzo for Gambino. Multiple payments were\n\nmade to third parties from the closings, including creditors of Sal. Deposits of large\n\namounts of moneys were made into Enzo’s bank accounts and the bank account of his\n\ngirlfriend, which Enzo testified was converted to cash and given to Gambino, but no\n\ndocumentary evidence showed that Gambino actually received these moneys.\n\n       Second, the fact that Gambino approached Sal about procuring a loan on one of\n\nthe subject properties was admitted by plaintiffs in their complaint at the outset; what\n\nwas contested was the transactions that conveyed the subject properties from Gambino to\n\nseveral defendants for pennies on the dollar. Further, the fact that overdue real estate\n\ntaxes were paid from the closings does not prove that Gambino ratified the transactions\n\nor that the taxes were paid for his benefit. Rather, the evidence at trial shows that the\n\n                                             48\n\foverdue real estate taxes were paid for the benefit of several of the defendants in the case\n\nto clear title to the properties. Finally, the events surrounding the Zippershtein\n\nforeclosure action does not undercut the trial court’s finding that Gambino did not ratify\n\nthe contested transactions. Upon receiving a letter demanding payment of the\n\nZippershtien mortgage, Gambino denied any knowledge with regard to the loan. When\n\nsuit was filed, he appeared to defend until that suit was voluntarily dismissed by\n\nZippershtein. These arguments cannot serve as a basis for reversing the trial court’s\n\nfindings.\n\n       We now address the arguments of Plaza Bank. Plaza Bank’s arguments on appeal\n\nsolely concern the trial court’s order voiding its mortgage lien on the Niles Property.\n\nPlaza Bank argues that the trial court’s findings with regard to plaintiffs’ claim to quiet\n\ntitle to the Niles Property were against the manifest weight of the evidence. Smith, Allen,\n\nMendenhall, Emons & Selby v. Thomson Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">371</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill.

Plaza Bank argues that the evidence\n\npresented coupled with plaintiffs’ judicial admissions establishes that Gambino was\n\naware of and participated in the Niles mortgage.\n\n       Plaza Bank first argues that Sal and Enzo were Gambino’s agents. In this regard,\n\nPlaza Bank argues that Gambino engaged Sal and Enzo to procure a loan on one of his\n\nproperties, authorized Sal to obtain his credit report, and authorized Pritikin to speak with\n\nSal regarding the procurement of a loan to settle his liability with the IRS. The trial court\n\nfound in its November 30, 2007, order that “there was no proof of any statement or\n\nconduct by Gambino that encouraged or led these defendants or anyone else to produce\n\n                                             49\n\fthese forged and falsely notarized documents purportedly transferring title, to [his]\n\ndetriment.” The judgment of the trial court cannot be reversed on this basis.\n\n       Plaza Bank then argues that Gambino ratified the Niles transaction. As noted,\n\nratification occurs when the principal learns of an unauthorized transaction, then retains\n\nthe benefits of the transaction or takes a position inconsistent with nonaffirmation.\n\nStathis, 295 Ill.

Plaza Bank argues that Gambino received moneys from the first closing\n\nrelated to the Niles Property and also points out that Gambino told Thomas Gambino that\n\nhe had authorized Sal and Enzo to procure a loan on one of his properties. Further, Plaza\n\nBank points out that overdue real estate taxes were paid on the subject properties from\n\nthe closings. Further, Plaza Bank argues that Gambino’s response to the Zippershtein\n\nforeclosure action showed that Gambino ratified the transactions. Plaza Bank argues that\n\nGambino, after being served with the foreclosure complaint, never filed a motion to\n\ndismiss or strike the foreclosure action, but simply allowed the mortgage to be paid.\n\n       Again, the fact that Gambino approached Sal about the possibility of procuring a\n\nloan on one of the subject properties was admitted by plaintiffs in their complaint at the\n\noutset; what was contested was the transactions that conveyed the subject properties from\n\nGambino to several defendants by the use of fraudulent, forged legal documents\n\nincluding forged deeds. Further, the fact that overdue real estate taxes were paid from\n\nthe closings does not prove that Gambino ratified the transactions or that the taxes were\n\n                                             50\n\fpaid for his benefit. Rather, the evidence at trial shows that the overdue real estate taxes\n\nwere paid for the benefit of several of the defendants who needed to have clear title.\n\nFinally, the events surrounding the Zippershtein foreclosure action does not undercut the\n\ntrial court’s finding that Gambino did not ratify the contested transactions. Upon\n\nreceiving a letter demanding payment of the Zippershtien mortgage, Gambino denied any\n\nknowledge of the loan. When suit was filed, he hired a lawyer to defend until that suit\n\nwas voluntarily dismissed. Like the Koonce defendants’ arguments, Plaza Bank’s\n\narguments are not persuasive.\n\n        Plaza Bank also argues that Gambino is judicially estopped from denying the\n\nNiles transaction, because of his involvement in the Zippershtein foreclosure suit. The\n\ndoctrine of judicial estoppel postulates that “ ‘a party who assumes a particular position\n\nin a legal proceeding is estopped from assuming a contrary position in a subsequent legal\n\nproceeding.’ ” Barack Ferrazzano Kirschbaum Perlman & Nagelberg v.

Gambino\n\ndid not take a position in the case at bar factually inconsistent with his position in the\n\nZippershtein foreclosure action. In both actions, he contested the validity of the\n\nZippershtein mortage. When the foreclosure action was filed, Gambino retained a lawyer\n\nto defend the case.

Further, Plaza Bank argues that Gambino made\n\nmisrepresentations to the IRS on the values of the subject properties. Plaza Bank’s\n\nargument cannot be used to reverse the trial court’s judgment as the actions giving rise to\n\nits “unclean hands” argument did not involve the Niles transaction. Further, since\n\nGambino returned the title documents to North Star, the trial court may have found that\n\nallegation drawn by his attorney did not rise to the level of “unclean hands,” and we\n\ncannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in its findings on that matter or on\n\nGambino’s representation to the IRS.

Slander of Title\n\n          We now consider the trial court’s findings concerning plaintiffs’ slander of title\n\ncounts. As noted, plaintiffs alleged slander of title in counts II, IV, and VI of their\n\ncomplaint. Count II was pled against Sal, Enzo, and the Koonce defendants with regard\n\nto the Lavergne Property. Counts IV and VI were pled against Sal, Enzo, the Koonce\n\ndefendants, and the Wolf defendants with regard to the Niles and Kedzie Properties,\n\nrespectively. On November 30, 2007, the trial court found in favor of plaintiffs on those\n\ncounts.\n\n                                               54\n\f        The Koonce defendants and the Wolf defendants (Wolf and WW Funding) argue\n\nthat the trial court’s findings as to plaintiffs’ slander of title counts are against the\n\nmanifest weight of the evidence. A plaintiff asserting slander of title bears the burden of\n\nproving the following: (1) the defendants made a false and malicious publication, either\n\noral or written; (2) that such publication disparaged the plaintiff’s title to property; and\n\n(3) damages due to such publication.

At trial, Sal admitted that he\n\npersonally recorded all the deeds, including the forged trustee’s deed conveying title to\n\nthe Lavergne Property from North Star directly to Koonce. Further, mortgage liens were\n\nrecorded against the Lavergne Property due to loans applied for by Koonce as borrower.\n\nFurther, Koonce submitted his application for a loan on the Lavergne Property in April\n\n                                              56\n\f2003 through Boulevard, which received an $850 fee for “loan application and\n\nprocessing fees.” Further, Title America was the title company used for five of the six\n\nclosings which led to the recording of the legal documents slandering plaintiffs’ title to\n\nall three of the subject properties. The element of publication against the Koonce\n\ndefendants was proven.\n\n       The Koonce defendants and the Wolf defendants both argue that there was no\n\nevidence that they acted with malice. We will address the trial court’s findings with\n\nregard to the Koonce defendants first.\n\n       The trial court found that Koonce was personally involved with Sal in defrauding\n\nGambino from the outset of the events leading to this trial. At trial, Sal admitted that he\n\nrecorded all the deeds as to the subject properties. As to the Lavergne Property, he\n\nadmitted that he recorded the forged trustee’s deed conveying title from North Star\n\ndirectly to Koonce. As to the Niles Property, the trial court believed the testimony of\n\nFritzshall, Zippershtein’s attorney, that Koonce claimed he was Gambino’s attorney. At\n\ntrial, Koonce denied that he ever represented to anyone that he was Gambino’s attorney\n\nbut the trial court found his testimony not credible.\n\n       The trial court noted that Koonce “refinanced” the Lavergne Property, although\n\nhe did not own it. He submitted a loan application as a “refinance” and signed it as the\n\n“borrower.” Further, the court noted Koonce’s agreement with WW Funding to take an\n\noption to purchase the Kedzie Property, an option for which Koonce admitted he paid\n\nnothing.\n\n       Further, the trial court found that both Boulevard and Title America acted with\n\nmalice. With respect to Boulevard, the court found that Koonce and Sal used Boulevard\n\n                                             57\n\fin various ways for these transactions. Koonce used a Boulevard form to submit an\n\napplication for a $800,000 loan to Washington Mutual on the Niles and Kedzie\n\nProperties. Koonce and Sal used Boulevard to obtain a credit report for Gambino, and\n\nissued a mortgage loan commitment for Gambino from it. Koonce quitclaimed his\n\ninterest in the Lavergne Property to Boulevard.\n\n       The trial court noted that Title America, of which Koonce is the sole shareholder,\n\nwas used as the title company for five of the six contested transactions. The trial court\n\nfound that the reason for this was so scrutiny of the forged documents would remain low.\n\nTitle America accepted the forged deeds and other forged documents. Moneys were paid\n\nfrom the closings to third parties unrelated to the transactions. Large checks and wire\n\ntransfers were issued by Title America to Enzo and Sal, and to creditors of Sal.\n\n       Based on the foregoing, we cannot say that the trial court’s findings that the\n\nKoonce defendants acted with malice was against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n\n       We now address the Wolf defendants argument that the trial court’s findings that\n\nthey acted with malice was against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n\n       The Wolf defendants argue that they did not know nor should they have known\n\nthat the warranty deed WW Funding received from “Joseph J. Gambino” to the Niles\n\nProperty was forged or that the warrantee deed from “Joseph J. Gambino” to Century for\n\nthe Kedzie Property, title to which WW Funding later obtained, was forged. The Wolf\n\ndefendants argue that they, in good faith, believed that they were purchasing the Niles\n\nand Kedzie Properties by paying off the Zippershtein mortgage and the Century loan.\n\n       The trial court found that Wolf was involved with Sal’s defrauding of Gambino\n\nfrom the beginning of the events leading to trial. Sal first approached Wolf with regard\n\n                                             58\n\fto the Niles Property. Wolf referred the loan to Zippershtein, who made a $200,000 loan\n\non the Niles Property. Wolf earned a $5,250 commitment fee from that loan. His son\n\nAdam earned a $4,000 commitment fee. Both Fritzshall and Sal testified that Wolf was\n\npresent for the first closing related to the Niles Property. Wolf denied being present.\n\n       With regard to the Kedzie Property, Wolf referred the loan to Azran who made a\n\nloan through his company Century. Century loaned $200,000, taking title to the property\n\nas security for the loan, and purportedly leased the property back to Gambino; a purchase\n\noption which lapsed in a year’s time was also purportedly given to Gambino. Azran\n\ntestified that it was agreed in advance that in the event Gambino did not exercise his\n\noption to purchase, Wolf, Zippershtein, and Azran would each take a one-third ownership\n\ninterest in the property. Wolf was paid a $6,250 commitment fee for this loan. His son\n\nAdam was also paid a $6,250 loan fee for this loan. When Gambino failed to exercise\n\nthe option to purchase the Kedzie Property, it was Wolf who purchased the property\n\nthrough his company WW Funding. From this closing, WW Funding was paid a $25,000\n\ncommitment fee. As to the Niles Property, after Zippershtein filed the foreclosure suit,\n\nWW Funding purchased the property, obtaining $445,000 in financing from Plaza Bank.\n\nWW Funding held $135,171.38 from closing. Upon WW Funding’s taking title to both\n\nthe Niles and Kedzie Properties, options to purchase were granted to Koonce.\n\n       The trial court “flatly disbelieve[d]” Wolf’s testimony that he personally met with\n\nGambino and that Gambino approved the aforementioned transactions.\n\n       As to WW Funding, the trial court found that Wolf used WW Funding to\n\ncomplete the transactions in which he would finally hold title to the Niles and Kedzie\n\nProperties.\n\n                                             59\n\f       Based upon the foregoing, we cannot say that the trial court’s finding as to the\n\nWolf defendants’ malice was against the manifest weight of the evidence. We recognize\n\nthe fact that large commitment fees are sometimes earned in “hard-money” transactions\n\nlike the ones in the case at bar and that large commitment fees are not necessarily\n\nindicative of illegal transactions. However, it was the trial court’s duty to determine\n\nwhether the Wolf defendants had acted with malice in the case at bar, which it did, and\n\nbased upon the record before us we cannot determine that the opposite conclusion, that\n\nthe Wolf defendants did not act with malice in slandering plaintiffs’ title to the Kedzie\n\nand Niles Properties, was clearly evident.\n\n       Accordingly, the trial court’s findings with respect to plaintiffs’ slander of title\n\nclaims are affirmed.\n\n                                         3. Damages\n\n       The Koonce defendants and the Wolf defendants raise several arguments with\n\nregard to the trial court’s award of compensatory and punitive damages. They argue that\n\nthe trial court abused its discretion in awarding attorney fees in the amount of three times\n\nthe lodestar. They further argue that the trial court’s award of punitive damages was\n\nerror as a matter of law, against the manifest weight of the evidence, an abuse of\n\ndiscretion, and in violation of their constitutional right to due process.\n\n        We begin with the arguments with regard to the trial court’s award of attorney\n\nfees. As noted, the trial court awarded attorney fees to plaintiffs in the form of\n\ncompensatory damages: $595,574 on counts IV and VI of plaintiffs’ complaint, such\n\ndamages imposed jointly and severally against Sal, Enzo, and the Koonce defendants;\n\n$556,485 on counts IV and VI of plaintiffs’ complaint, such damages imposed jointly\n\n                                              60\n\fand severally against Wolf and WW Funding, and $595,574 on count II of plaintiffs’\n\ncomplaint, imposed jointly and severally against Sal, Enzo, and the Koonce defendants.\n\nThe court found that plaintiffs were to have only one recovery of compensatory damages,\n\nand the judgments entered were not cumulative.\n\n       A trial court has broad discretionary powers in awarding attorney fees and its\n\ndiscretion will not be reversed on review unless the court abused its discretion.

Within a short time,\n\nGambino was unable to keep current in paying the attorneys’ fees. Counsels were\n\nunwilling to continue working on an hourly basis when their bills were not being pay and\n\nthey would not agree to deferring payment until conclusion of the case. It was agreed\n\nthat while billing would continue on an hourly basis, all amounts unpaid would be treated\n\nby a contingency fee agreement. Specifically, all unpaid hourly fees would be paid at\n\nthree times the amount billed if and when the case reached successful outcome. Costs\n\nwere to be treated in the same manner.

Because punitive damages are not favored in\n\nthe law they are only available in cases where the wrongful act complained of is\n\ncharacterized by wantonness, malice, oppression, willfulness, or other circumstances of\n\naggravation. Franz, 352 Ill. App. 3d at 1138.\n\n        On appeal from a bench trial, the question of whether punitive damages are\n\navailable as a matter of law for the cause of action is reviewed de novo.

The question of whether the facts prove willfulness or other\n\naggravating factors is a factual determination that is reviewed using the manifest-weight\n\nstandard. Franz, 352 Ill. App. 3d at 1137-38. Whether punitive damages should be\n\nawarded is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. Franz, 352 Ill. App. 3d at 1138. We\n\nreview the computation of the punitive damages award to determine whether the amount\n\nwas excessive or the result of passion, partiality, or corruption. Franz, 352 Ill. App. 3d at\n\n1138.\n\n        “In reviewing [the] determination of the amount of punitive damages, if any, we\n\nwill reverse only if the award was ‘so excessive [as] to indicate passion, partiality, or\n\ncorruption.’ ” Gomez, 369 Ill. App. 3d at 722, quoting Franz, 352 Ill. App. 3d at 1138.\n\nThe assessment of punitive damages is a highly factual decision, which is appropriately\n\nmade at the trial court level. Franz, 352 Ill. App. 3d at 1144. The amount of an award\n\nshould be a reflection of the fact finder’s determination as to the degree of maliciousness\n\nevidenced by a defendant’s actions. Franz, 352 Ill. App. 3d at 1144. In reviewing the\n\nmaliciousness of conduct for purposes of punitive damages awards, a reviewing court is\n\n                                             65\n\fnot in a position to reassess the credibility of the witnesses who testified at trial.

A trial court must evaluate available evidence of a defendant’s\n\nfinancial worth in calculating punitive damages, but an award will not be overturned just\n\nbecause the defendant did not present evidence of financial worth at trial.

They argue that, “to the extent that plaintiff[s]\n\nestablished nothing more than the elements of the tort itself, punitive damages are not\n\nappropriate.” Further, they argue that the trial court’s finding that punitive damages were\n\nwarranted in this case was against the manifest weight of the evidence.

Further, as is apparent from a\n\nreading of the trial court’s memorandum opinions and orders, it found actual malice\n\nwarranting the imposition of punitive damages in this case. The trial court found that the\n\nmalice exhibited by these defendants was beyond that necessary to establish the elements\n\n                                               66\n\fof plaintiffs’ slander of title claims. The trial court found that the Koonce defendants and\n\nthe Wolf defendants participated in a number of transactions by which the subject\n\nproperties were taken from plaintiffs by means of fraudulent, forged legal documents.\n\nAgain, we note that the settlement documents are direct evidence of fraud. The Niles\n\nProperty alone had $25,000 in commitment fees distributed to the Wolfs and\n\nZippershtein; a mortgage escrow of $33,000, which is unusual; a $5,000 appraisal fee;\n\nand a payment to Sal of $25,000 that is questionable on its face. The Kedzie settlement\n\ndisbursements reveal commitment or loan fees of $18,750, a $25,000 payment to\n\n“Norman Trust Account,” and $5,372.72 to a law firm not involved in the process, and\n\nover $50,000 to unknown people and only $10,000 to Gambino. The disbursements on\n\nthe Lavergne Property were just as bizarre with no funds going to Gambino and $120,000\n\nto Enzo with loan fees over $7,000 and an unexplained disbursement to Harris Bank for\n\n$10,000. Further, Wolf, Zippershtein, and Azran, had in place an agreement to share in\n\nthe ownership of the Kedzie Property in the event Gambino should fail to exercise his\n\noption to purchase the property. The trial court’s decision to impose punitive damages in\n\nthis case was neither error as a matter of law, against the manifest weight of the evidence,\n\nor an abuse of its discretion. Again, the assessment of punitive damages is highly factual\n\ndecision that should be a reflection of the fact finder’s determination of maliciousness.\n\nGomez, 369 Ill. App. 3d at 722. We cannot disturb the trial court’s assessment of\n\npunitive damages here.\n\n       We note that no defendant has provided us with any authority of whether the trial\n\ncourt’s assessment of punitive damages before its calculation of compensatory damages\n\nwas error. As a result any contention in this regard is waived. 210 Ill. 2d R. 341(h)(7).\n\n                                             67\n\fWe also were unable to find any authority dictating the reversal of the trial court’s order\n\nunder these circumstances. We also note that the fact that no evidence of defendants’\n\nfinancial status does not require reversal. Kochan, 242 Ill. App. 3d at 798.

Franz, 352\n\nIll. App. 3d at 1147. A constitutional challenge to an award of punitive damages is\n\nseparate from the common-law challenge addressed above. Franz, 352 Ill. App. 3d at\n\n1147. The constitutional question requires a court to consider three factors: (1) the\n\ndegree of reprehensibility of the defendant’s misconduct; (2) the disparity between the\n\nharm suffered by the plaintiff and the punitive damages award; and (3) the difference\n\nbetween the punitive damages awarded and the civil penalties authorized or imposed in\n\ncomparable cases.

It should be presumed a plaintiff has been made whole for his injuries by\n\ncompensatory damages, so punitive damages should only be awarded if the defendant's\n\nculpability, after having paid compensatory damages, is so reprehensible as to warrant\n\nthe imposition of further sanctions to achieve punishment or deterrence.” State Farm\n\nMutual Automobile Insurance Co. v.

As noted,\n\nthe factors to be considered in determining reprehensibility include whether the target of\n\nthe conduct was financially vulnerable, whether the conduct involved repeated actions\n\nand whether the harm was the result of intentional malice, trickery, or deceit. Here, it is\n\nundisputed that Gambino was in serious financial debt in the summer of 2002. He owed\n\nback taxes to the IRS and overdue real estate taxes. Further, the conduct involved\n\nrepeated actions. Over 40 legal documents were used in order to take title to the subject\n\nproperties over the course of six real estate closings. The trial court also found that the\n\n                                             69\n\fharm here was the result of intentional malice, trickery, and deceit. The trial court\n\ndetermined that the Koonce defendants and the Wolf defendants participated in a scheme\n\nto take plaintiffs’ properties through the use of fraudulent, forged legal documents\n\nincluding forged deeds.\n\n        Furthermore, the punitive damages awarded in this case were only a fraction of\n\nthe damages plaintiffs’ suffered as a result of the defendants’ conduct. The trial court’s\n\nimposition of punitive damages in this case did not violate due process.\n\n                                        4. Sanctions\n\n        We finally come to the final issues on appeal; whether the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion by denying two Illinois Supreme Court Rule 137 motions for sanctions (155\n\nIll. 2d R. 137) in its May 2, 2008, order. Plaintiffs filed a cross-appeal from the denial of\n\ntheir motion for sanctions against defendants Plaza Bank and Washington Mutual for\n\nfailing to amend their answer to plaintiffs’ complaint to conform to the proofs of this\n\ncase. Plaza Bank and Washington Mutual filed their own Rule 137 motion in response to\n\nplaintiffs’ motion, which was also denied. Plaza Bank and Washington Mutual appeal\n\nthe denial of their motion for sanctions.\n\n        As noted, plaintiffs’ complaint alleged that Plaza Bank and Washington Mutual\n\nknew or should have known that the trustee’s deeds recorded against the subject\n\nproperties were forged. In response to this allegation both Plaza Bank and Washington\n\nMutual answered that they “lacked knowledge or information sufficient” to form a belief\n\nas to the truth of the allegation.\n\n        Plaintiffs filed a motion for sanctions against Plaza Bank and Washington Mutual\n\non December 12, 2007, after the trial court’s November 30, 2007, order, arguing that\n\n                                             70\n\fPlaza Bank and Washington Mutual had a continuing duty to monitor the accuracy of\n\ntheir answer and that their continued disavowal of the forgeries warranted sanctions.\n\n       Plaza Bank and Washington Mutual responded and filed a cross-motion for\n\nsanctions, contending that the motion for sanctions filed by plaintiffs themselves was not\n\nwell-grounded in fact or law.\n\n       Illinois Supreme Court Rule 137 allows the trial court to award sanctions against\n\nparties who filed frivolous pleadings when a pleading has no basis in fact or law. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> R. 137.

Although the trial court made no specific\n\nfindings as to the denial of this motion for sanctions, the trial court could have found that\n\nplaintiffs’ motion for sanctions was not made for an improper purpose and was a good-\n\nfaith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law to impose a\n\nduty on litigants a continuing duty to amend their pleadings as facts come to light that\n\nwould prove their pleadings mistaken.\n\n\n\n\n                                                72\n\f                                    CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court of Cook\n\nCounty in its entirety.\n\n       Affirmed.\n\n       CAHILL, P.J., and McBRIDE, J., concur.\n\n\n\n\n                                           73\n\f</pre>",
