The Board held a\n15-day hearing, in Anchorage, Alaska, and Falls Church, Virginia. We heard entitlement\nand quantum but because we deny the appeal we do not decide quantum and therefore do\nnot make quantum findings.\n\n                                   FINDINGS OF FACT\n\n       1. On 25 April 2008 GRS issued a request for proposals (RFP) for a negotiated\ndesign/build contract under the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program. The Iraqi Navy\nwas the FMS customer. The RFP sought seawall design and construction; a design to\nminimize dredging; and construction of an \"L-shaped\" pier (\"Pier 1\"), with an option for\na \"T-shaped\" pier (\"Pier 2\") (north of an existing Pier 3) at Umm Qasr, Iraq. The\ncontractor was responsible for project design and was to submit required design\ndocumentation at 35%, 99%, and 100% phases. (R4, tab 103 at 1 of87, at Scope of Work\n(SOW) at 96-97, 101-03 of 113, tab 103 at 5 of 89; tr. 8/80)\n\f       2. The RFP contained the FAR 52.236-27, SITE VISIT (CONSTRUCTION) (FEB\n1995) clause under which offerors are urged and expected to inspect the work site (R4,\ntab 103 at 71 of 89).\n\n       3. The RFP included the FAR 52.236-2, DIFFERING SITE CONDITIONS (APR 1984)\nclause, which states, concerning a \"Type I\" differing site condition, at issue:\n\n                      (a) The Contractor shall promptly, and before the\n              conditions are disturbed, give a written notice to the [CO] of\n              ( 1) subsurface or latent physical conditions at the site which\n              differ materially from those indicated in this contract.. ..\n\n                      (b) The [CO] shall investigate the site conditions\n              promptly after receiving the notice. If [they] do materially so\n              differ and cause an increase .. .in the Contractor's cost of, or\n              the time required for, performing any part of the work under\n              this contract, whether or not changed as a result of the\n              conditions, an equitable adjustment shall be made ....\n\n(R4, tab 103 at 84 of 89)\n\n       4. The RFP also contained the FAR 52.236-3, SITE INVESTIGATION AND\nCONDITIONS AFFECTING THE WORK (APR 1984) clause which provides that the contractor\nacknowledges that it has satisfied itself as to the conditions that can affect the work,\nincluding tide uncertainties; ground conditions; and surface and subsurface conditions\nreasonably ascertainable from a site inspection, the government's exploratory work, and\nthe contract. The clause disclaims government responsibility for the contractor's failure\nto do so or for its conclusions. (R4, tab 103 at 84-85 of 89)\n\n       5. The RFP stated that the \"Contractor/Designer shall research all existing\nconditions\" at the naval base and waterway (R4, tab 103, SOW at 96 of 113).\n\n       6. RFP § 4.1, \"GEOTECHNICAL,\" provided:\n\n              4.1.1   Site Specific Information\n                      Site specific geotechnical information necessary to\n                      design and construct the pile foundations, sea wall\n                      and other geotechnical related items contained in this\n                      project shall be the Contractor's responsibility. The\n                      Contractor shall determine all necessary geotechnical\n                      conditions by appropriate field and laboratory\n                      investigations and supporting calculations ....\n\n\n                                              2\n\f                      Additional explorations may be required to\n                      adequately determine the subsurface conditions if the\n                      soil is highly variable; unusual conditions are\n                      expected and/or to determine ... other geotechnical\n                      related requirements ....\n\n              4.1.2 Existing Geotechnical Information\n                    A geotechnical study of the project site containing 3\n                    borings has been provided in Appendix C. This\n                    exploration's logs and geotechnical report by others\n                    are ''for information only\".\n\n              4.1.3 Geotechnical Report\n                    The Contractor shall produce a detailed geotechnical\n                    report.... Information in the report shall include, but\n                    not be limited to: existing geotechnical (e.g., surface\n                    and subsurface) conditions ....\n\n\n\n              4.1.6 Design Certification\n                    The Contractor shall certifY in writing that the design\n                    of the project has been developed consistent with the\n                    site-specific geotechnical conditions. The certification\n                    shall be stamped by the geotechnical engineer or\n                    geotechnical firm and shall be submitted with the final\n                    design.\n\n(R4, tab 103, SOW at 99-100 of 113) (Emphasis added)\n\n        7. The referenced Appendix C, \"Report on Site Investigation for Dock at Urn\nQasir Port at Basrah Governorate,\" dated May 2007, was prepared by Iraq's Andrea\nEngineering Tests Laboratory for a different contractor \"to explore the subsoil conditions\nof the proposed site to facilitate the foundation design for ... new docks & related\nstructures at Urn Qasir Port\" (R4, tab 103, app'x Cat 1) (Andrea report or AR). The\nreport addressed a field investigation that included three boreholes (BH), an in-situ\nStandard Penetration Test (SPT) and other tests. It contained BH locations and logs; field\ntest results; and a summary of laboratory test results. The SPT measured soil consistency\nat several depths. It was performed in all types of soil, especially in \"sandy clayey layers\"\n(AR at 3). The AR included American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) tests:\nvisual classification; natural moisture content and unit weight; specific gravity; grain size\n\n\n                                              3\n\fdistribution; liquid and plastic limits; shear tests, including unconfirmed and triaxial\ncompression and direct shear; and consolidation compressibility; plus various chemical\nanalyses on soil. (AR at 1-12 and appendices)\n\n       8. The AR stated at § IV, \"DESCRIPTION OF SUBSOIL STRATA\":\n\n                     The subsoil strata consist mainly of a very soft, soft to\n             medium gray to dark gray sandy silty clay layer with black\n             traces of organic matter and white shiny traces ofsoluble\n             salts, overlying medium, dense to very dense layer of gray\n             fine, medium to coarse grained siltY sand, with little gravel.\n\n                    The water table was encountered, as observed at the\n             time of investigation between (0.0-1.0), below the existing\n             ground level (NGL), at [BH] nos 2 & 3, which were in the\n             ebb and tide zone. While at [BH] no. ( 1), which was the more\n             distance from the sea, was between ( l.0-1.5)m ....\n\n                    The fluctuation of water table with the seasons could\n             be observed (rising during spring). The zone immediately\n             above water table is greatly affected as far as strength and\n             compressibility are concerned. As moisture increased the\n             strength decreased and compressibility increased.\n\n(AR at 4) (Emphasis added)\n\n      9. The AR stated at§ VI, \"DISCUSSION OF RESULTS\":\n\n             The site subsoil consists mainly from two layers, the first\n             layer of very soft, soft to medium gray sandy silty clay with\n             amount of soluble salts and organic matter overlying on a\n             layer of medium, dense to very dense gray silty sand.... [T]he\n             majority of the first top soil is classified as ... silt-sand-clay\n             mixtures.\n\n                    The water table was encountered. .. between (0.0-1.0)\n             meter below the existing ground level.... Furthermore, the\n             site was within the ebb and tide zone of the sea.\n\n                   The saturated soil condition below the water table\n             makes the problem ofsettlement significant as consolidation is\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\f             a process of graduated decrease of the water content from\n             saturated soil under constant load.\n\n\n\n                    A laboratory vane shear equipment. .. is used to obtain\n             the undrained shear strength, this method was used due to\n             high disturbance in all samplers that extruded from shelby\n             tubes of the soft clayey layer, also it was found that this soil\n             exudes between the fingers when squeezed in the fist so this\n             could [be] described as very soft to soft sandy clayey soil.\n\n                    The values of undrained shear strength were found to\n             be approximately in the range of about (1 0 to 25) kPa\n             [kilopascals] for soft soil at depth from (0 to 14)m.\n\n                    In the case of the construction on soft soil, three\n             options are available to ensure that there will not be\n             significant problems during the design life of the structure[:]\n\n                           i. Replacement of the soft soil.\n                           ii. Using pile foundation, and\n                           iii. Stabilization or improvement ofsoft soil.\n\n                     Organic matter with presence ofsalts may be found in\n             the soil in many forms. The increase in those contents of the\n             soil may cause some alteration in engineering properties of\n             the soil.\n\n                     The presence of organic matter may cause significant\n             changes in the properties of the soil. The effects on fine\n              grained soils may be more obvious, such alteration could be\n              noticed through color and odor of the clay and .. .suitable\n             remedy without exceeding the proper bound of the safety may\n              be required. Investigation of the site area has produced\n             evidence ofsome kind of collapse due to the reaction between\n             fundamental compounds of the soil (sandy clayey layer) with\n             organic matter....\n\n(AR at 8-9) (Emphasis added) Regarding the kPas, Corps Manual 1110-1-1804-\nGeotechnical Investigations, cited by the Corps and by CCI's fact and expert witness\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\fMike Hartley (below), describes values less than 25 kPa as \"Very soft\" and from 25 to 50\nkPa as \"Soft\" (R4, tab 2 at 15, tab 97 at 13).\n\n        10. The AR contained three BH logs. BH No. 1 was inland from where the crane\npad at issue was to be constructed and the parties have discounted it. BH No.2 was very\nnear the pad site. (AR, app'x A, app'x Bat 1, 2; exs. A-234 at 6, G-24; tr. 2/168-69,\n6/33) Its log described the top 7m of material as \"[v]ery soft to soft gray to dark gray\nsilty CLAY with black spots and/or pocket of organic matter and shiny traces of soluble\nsalts\"; from 7 to 12.5m as \"[s}oft to medium gray silty CLAY with some silty sand pocket\n& shiny spots ofsoluble salts\"; and from 12.5 to 18m as \"[d]ense to very dense gray\ncoarse grained clayey silty SAND with some coarse gravel & cobbles\" (AR, app'x Bat 2)\n(emphasis added).\n\n        11. The BH No.3 log described the upper 7m as \"[v]ery soft to soft gray to dark\ngray silty CLAY with rusty brown pocket of fine sand & black traces of organic matter &\nshiny spots of soluble salts\"; from 7 to 16.5m as \"[s}oft dark gray silty CLAY with white\nshiny traces of soluble salts & yellowish brown line of fine sand\"; from 16.5 to 17 .5m as\n\"[v ]ery dense coarse grained gravelly SAND with some cobbles and boulders\"; and from\n17.5 to 24m as \"[l]oose to medium gray to dark gray medium grained silty SAND with\nshiny traces of soluble salts\" (AR, app'x Bat 3) (emphasis added).\n\n        12. The RFP noted the site was on an estuarine outflow of the Tigris-Euphrates\ndelta system, with current flow predominantly tidal and maximum velocities near four\nknots during spring tide ebb flow. It addressed sedimentation:\n\n              The closest waterfront development to this site is the\n              commercial port of Umm Qasr located immediately\n              \"upstream\". The infrastructure is based upon a continuous\n              dredged quay along the west bank of Khawar Abd Allah ....\n\n              Satellite photos substantiate local reports that Khawr Abd\n              Allah is heavily laden with fine sediments. Although actual\n              situation [sic] rates experienced within the commercial port\n              are not known, ... the marine railway located between the\n              commercial port and the proposed Navy Base is reported to\n              have already silted in. [Emphasis added]\n\n(R4, tab 105 at 1, see tab 106; tr. 2/29-30, 120) The project was largely in an intertidal\nzone, between low tide and high tide, with some of it beyond the low tide line (tr. 6/29).\n\n      13. Iraqi contractor Sada Al-Raneen (SAR) brought the RFP to Poly Earth\nConstruction International, LLC (PCI), for which SAR had been a subcontractor in 2005\n\n\n                                             6\n\fon a Basra airport project with which Lee Nunn was involved. Mr. Nunn and Samuel\nPelant had formed PCI. Mr. Pelant, a project manager, was not an engineer. Mr. Nunn\nwas a registered civil and nuclear engineer. He was with the Corps for 23 years prior to\nretiring. He had many major engineering jobs at the Corps and in the private sector. His\nwork had included several projects in the Middle East. (Ex. G-26, part 1 at 39, part 2 at\n184; tr. 2/138-151, 212; see R4, tab 111 at 4)\n\n       14. Mr. Nunn consulted with Dennis Nottingham, then a principal in Peratrovich\nNottingham, a marine engineering firm also known as PND Engineers (PND), and gave\nhim the RFP. Prior to his retirement in August 2009, Mr. Nottingham, who held a\nmasters degree, apparently in the geotechnical area, had 50 years' experience as a\nprofessional engineer. He held a patent on an \"open cell\" process that was attractive to\nMr. Nunn for pier construction. (Tr. 2/6-8, 77, 104-05, 151-52)\n\n       15. Mr. Nottingham confirmed that the project was immediately downstream of\nthe old port but asserted that, due to dredging, the old port was trapping all sediment. If\nany remained, a gentle curve in the river formed an outside bend, causing scouring that\nwould sweep it away from the project. (Ex. G-2; tr. 2/119-20, 127-31) He interpreted a\nUnited States Agency for International Development (USAID) report included in the RFP\n(below) to mean that sediment deposits were on the inside bends (ex. G-2; tr. 2/41-42,\n119-20, 127-31). That is where he \"expected the weak soils to be\" (tr. 2/42).\nMr. Nottingham's scouring views are supported in part by Dr. Michael Briggs, a research\nhydraulic engineer at the Corps' Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC).\nHe prepared a Navigation Design Review, dated 6 January 2009, post contract award, of a\nrevised CCI submittal, noting that the new piers were on the outside of a slight concave\nbend in the river, so shoaling should not be a problem. Scour and erosion from riverine\ncurrents were more likely. He stated that the \"bottom\" should be considered \"soft.\" He\ndid not do a geotechnical design review or analysis relative to soils. (Ex. A-15 at 174826)\n\n       16. CCI's proposal eliminated a dredging item to be priced on the ground that, by\npushing the pier further into the channel, greater scouring would occur and the flow of\nwater would keep sedimentation down (tr. 2/153, 8/64; see also R4, tab 112 at 3-4).\nHowever, \"Mr. Nunn knew that a dredging contractor was on site; that \"[t]hey were\nspending millions of dollars dredging the naval port\" and \"the other piers were already\nclogged with siltation\" (tr. 21153).\n\n        17. In Mr. Nottingham's experience it is the contractor's choice how to proceed\nwith open cell dock construction. It has been done with barges, including when very soft\nsoils are present, and with combination marine and land-based operations. Most open cell\nprojects with which he had been involved had been built from the land. If it is possible to\nget a good purchase and the ground is substantial enough to hold tlie equipment, a\nland-based approach is normally lower cost. According to Mr. Nunn, PCI considered\n\n\n                                             7\n\fonly land-based construction and saw nothing contrary to that approach. (Ex. G-27 at\n11-12; tr. 2/25-27, 84-85, 154) He acknowledged that open cell work was often done\nfrom barges, but stated that, if it were possible to do it from the land, \"the economics\ndemand that\" (tr. 21155). Mr. Nottingham's involvement with the geotechnical aspects of\nproject design appears to have been limited. CCI did not request a ground investigation\nor hire a geotechnical professional to evaluate its landside crane pad construction efforts\nuntil after slope instability occurred (below). 1\n\n        18. Mr. Nunn consulted with Keith Burke, president of CCI, a subsidiary of\nBristol Bay Native Corporation (BBNC), to see if CCI would be interested in the project.\nMr. Burke, who was not an engineer, and Jim Hutton, eventually CCI's project manager,\nattended a PND briefing, which demonstrated a land-based operation. CCI had very little\nexperience in marine construction and had never been involved in an open cell project,\nbut it wanted to expand its government contracting work and thought it would be an\nopportunity to get its \"foot in the door .. .in the [Middle East]\" (ex. G-27 at 8). At the\nproposal stage Mr. Burke did not receive a copy ofthe RFP. (R4, tab 112 at 5, 17;\ntr. 1150-52, 54-57, 74, 77, 105-07; ex. G-18 at 41, G-27 at 7, 9; see R4, tab 111 at 4) CCI\ndid not do an estimate; PCI and PND did the pric~ng (tr. 11147).\n\n        19. PCI and PND were responsible for project design and engineering. PCI was\nto run it with PND and SAR as its subcontractors. (Ex. G-27 at 16-17; tr. 1157)\n\n       20. The Corps received about 10 proposals. All but CCI proposed \"L&T\" piers\ncalled for in the RFP. At PC I' s request, the RFP was amended to allow for alternative\nconcepts, such as open cell. (Tr. 8/30-31, 34, 43-44)\n\n        21. The site visit was on 17 May 2008. CCI, PCI and PND did not attend. A\nSAR engineer attended. SAR did not have nearshore marine construction experience.\nThe on-site supervisor from Weston Solutions (Weston), which was performing other\nwork at Umm Qsar, attended. Commander Raymond Deck, an engineer, conducted the\nvisit by bus and walking. The tide was high. Low tide photos were in RFP Amendment\nNo.2, but the low tide areas were covered with water during the visit and attendees could\nnot then have walked on them. The visit lasted about 90 minutes but there was no\ndeadline; the attendees determined the time spent. They took photographs and posed\nwritten questions, which Commander Deck gave to the Corps so the questions and\nanswers would be provided to all offerors. During the visit the contractors were told\nabout the need to dredge an area between what was then perceived to be the L&T pier\narea and the shoreline, because there was so much silt vessels would not be able to moor.\nThat day, SAR's engineer reported to Mr. Pelant2 . He forwarded photos, questions he\n\n1\n    For efficiency, we often refer to \"CCI,\" even if other entities were involved.\n2\n    Unless otherwise noted, all cited communications were by email.\n\n                                               8\n\fhad posed and the answers. None of the questions pertained to geographic site conditions\nor CCI' s planned method of dock construction. We have not been directed to any\nevidence that SAR evaluated ground conditions or the site's suitability for land-based\nconstruction. CCI did not attempt a site visit until after contract award. (R4, tab 104 at\n3-4, 10, tab 151; ex. G-26, part 1 at 36-38, part 2 at 184-85, 190; tr. 21155, 157, 229-30,\n81124-25, 129, 139-40, 143-45, 151, 168-70, 172-73, 181-85)\n\n        22. Prior to contract award Mr. Nottingham did most of the work on behalf ofPND\n(tr. 2/97). He designed a one-page concept plan dated 8 May 2008 that was incorporated\ninto CCI's proposal (R4, tab 112 following pg. 17, tab 150). CCI has not rebutted the\nCorps' assertion that the soil conditions and profile shown on his plan did not correspond to\nthe AR data in the RFP (see R4, tab 103c, AR, app'x B-[BH] Logs, tab 150; gov't br. at 20,\nproposed finding (PF) 52, 229-31; gov't reply at 18). Mr. Nottingham also prepared a\ngeneric estimate, dated 21 May 2008, based upon a preliminary design, of the cost of\nbuilding a similar open cell system, from the land, in the United States Gulf or South Coast\nregion, because he had not previously worked in the Middle East (R4, tab 153 at 15868;\ntr. 2/50, 53, 73, 107-08, 137). Mr. Nottingham's concept plan and cost estimate do not\ndiscuss the AR or USAID report or detail means and methods of construction, such as the\ncrane and crane pad at issue.\n\n       23. Mr. Nottingham read the AR and saw,.inconsistencies between descriptors by a\ngeologist(s) that the soils were \"very soft\" and blow count data that indicated \"not a bad\nsoil\" or a \"pretty good soil\" (tr. 2/61, 63). He placed more reliance upon the latter. He\nnoted to CCI' s proposal team that all of the borings were in one place, did not cover the\nlarge project, and they should seek more information. There was general information that\ncould be used but not in any detail. (Tr. 2/35, 44-45, 63-64, 67)\n\n      24. On 22 May 2008 Weston posed several questions to MAJ Joseph Brands, the\ngovernment's point of contact for project questions, including:\n\n              5) Geotechnical Conditions: Will the government be\n              providing any bidding assumptions associated with the\n              existing geotechnical conditions? For bidding purposes,\n              should the contractor assume the three borings provided are\n              representative of the entire site?\n\n              [Current SOW represents undue risk to the contractor based on\n              the unknown conditions. A fair basis for bidding is required.]\n\n(Ex. G-469)\n\n\n\n\n                                             9\n\f       25. RFP Amendment No.2, effective 6 June 2008, included questions posed by\npotential offerors and answers (R4, tab 104 at 1-2). The following are pertinent:\n\n              Question 11: Soil investigation not enough we need more\n              point of locations.\n\n              Answer 11: The best soil investigation data available to the\n              government is provided in Appendix-C Geotechnical\n              Investigation of the SOW [the AR]. The contractor should\n              assume the data provided in Appendix C is representative of\n              the project site.\n\n(R4, tab 104 at 8)\n\n              Question 42: Geotechnical Conditions: Will the\n              government be providing any bidding assumptions\n              associated with the existing geotechnical conditions?\n              For bidding purposes, should the contractor assume the\n              three borings provided are representative of the entire\n              site?\n\n              Answer 42: The contractor should assume the three borings\n              provided are representative of the entire site for the purposes\n              of developing a proposal. However, additional geotechnical\n              information maybe [sic] required during the design phase of\n              this project.\n\n(!d. at 13) Amendment No.2 also added an April2003 report from Stevedoring Services\nof America, BERGER/ABAM Engineers, Inc. to USAID, called Draft Umm Qasr Port\nAssessment (USAID report). The amendment stated: \"DISCLAIMER: The report is\nprovided for information only. The Government cannot guarantee the relevance,\ntimeliness, or accuracy of these materials\" (R4, tab 104 at 2, tab 107) (emphasis added).\n\n       26. USAID report,§ 3.1.5, \"Geology,\" noted that:\n\n              The streams are alluvial and the channels are apparently\n              composed primarily of sand and silt. Clay may be present, but\n              no clay balls were seen in the dredged material disposal areas.\n              There is a thin film of sun-cracked silt or clay at some of the\n              final settlement ponding areas. Boring information shows the\n              materials encountered in the original \"new\" port excavation as\n\n\n\n                                             10\n\f              silty sand with small fine gravel and clay. In fill sediments\n              since then may be of a finer, more silty nature.\n\n(R4, tab 107 at 10)\n\n       27. USAID report,§ 3.1.9, \"Shoaling Patterns and History,\" stated:\n\n              UMM Qasr Port is adjacent to an embayment [that] is the\n              estuary for several small rivers that drain a wetland area north\n              of the Port ....\n\n              The channel downstream ... follows the typical pattern of\n              sediments deposited in bar formations on the insides of the\n              bends. Additionally, as the inlet widens downstream and\n              current velocities are reduced, cross channel bars are\n              deposited that are shaped by upstream and downstream tidal\n              currents into typical ebb-flood pairs.\n\n              The channel bends and the cross channel bars are areas where\n              maintenance dredging will be focused. In the Port, deposition\n              occurs along both sides in the \"old\" port, requiring\n              maintenance dredging along the berths and along the opposite\n              shore ....\n\n              ... Suspended sediments entering the [\"new\" port] cut on the\n              incoming tide settle out in the quiet water primarily at the\n              sides creating the need for maintenance dredging at the berths.\n              The eastern side of the cut is shoaled extensively .... Recently\n              constructed dikes should eliminate this shoaling source ....\n\n              A spit grows from river channel sediments at the entrance of\n              the \"new\" port cut. This spit requires regular maintenance\n              dredging.\n\n              Nearly continuous maintenance dredging of the berths and\n              approach channel from the Pilot Boat Station will be required\n              to keep the Port viable. The existence of a large number of\n              dredge vessels in various states of functionality appear [sic] to\n              confirm that requirement.\n\n(R4, tab 107 at 11)\n\n\n\n                                             11\n\f       28. USAID report§ 3.2.8, \"Past Dredging and Disposal Practices,\" stated:\n\n              There are sizable upland dredged material disposal areas\n              nearby, opposite both the \"old\" and \"new\" ports. A large\n              estuary area behind Berths 13 to 16 has also been utilized as a\n              cutter-suction dredge disposal site. Dike and spillway\n              construction and maintenance .do not appear to be a high\n              priority, with some dredged materials finding their way back\n              to the Port waters.\n\n              The British Military indicate that. .. some of the cutter-suction\n              dredge materials were simply sidecast in the river channel\n              opposite or downstream of the \"old\" port ....\n\n              Hopper dredged disposal was reported to be just downstream\n              of the work areas. There does not appear to have been any\n              consistent effort to haul the dredged materials any distance to\n              insure their non-return to the shoaling locations.\n\n(R4, tab 107 at 13) The report also noted that there were dredged material disposal sites\nnot far from the old and new ports (id., § 3.2.9).\n\n        29. CCI alleges that the USAID report \"explicitly indicates\" that scouring would\noccur at the project site, eliminating all sediment and silt, regardless of any dredging\npractices (app. reply br. at 7). While acknowledging the scouring mentioned by\nMr. Nottingham and Dr. Briggs (finding 20), we find that neither§ 3.1.9 nor any other\nsection of the US AID report suggests that all sediment and silt would be scoured from the\nsite, regardless of dredging (R4, tab 107).\n\n        30. Mr. Nottingham responded affirmatively to questions posed by CCI's counsel\nas to whether he and the \"CCI team\" had relied upon the RFP's answers to questions 11\nand 42 in developing \"your proposal for Umm Qasr.\" \"Yes, that's all we had. And we\nwere instructed to do that. So that's what we did.\" (Tr. 2/45-46 (question 11)) \"Yes.\nWe had nothing else.\" (Tr. 2/47 (question 42)) Mr. Nottingham looked at the three\nborings in helping to prepare the proposal (tr. 2/56) and relied upon blow counts as \"the\nonly really non-subjective information\" (tr. 2/133). He relied upon the borings to\ndetermine whether the project could be built from the land (tr. 2/47), but acknowledged\nthat the data was insufficient for that determination:\n\n                   Q      After receiving that answer [to question 42], did\n             you determine whether or not the data provided in the three\n\n\n\n                                              12\n\f              bore logs was sufficient for the team to determine whether or\n              not this project could be built from the land side?\n\n                     A      It wasn't sufficient, but it was what we had and\n              using those borings, as representative of the whole site, we\n              determined that you could probably buil[d) it from the land\n              side. [Emphasis added]\n\n(Tr. 2/48, see also tr. 2/67 (Based upon Mr. Nottingham's \"preliminary analysis,\" using\navailable data, apparently prior to receipt of the answers to questions 11 and 42, it\n\"looked like\" shore-side construction would be viable. There is no evidence that his\nanalysis was memorialized in writing.))\n\n      31. Mr. Nunn testified credibly that, in the proposal planning meetings, the AR\nwas not the basis of any of the project constructability discussions (tr. 2/213).\n\n       32. At the time of the project, PCI had never been awarded a federal contract and\nMr. Nunn had not been involved as a contractor in an open cell construction project. PCI\nmarketed foam insulation and other things. It was formed to seek work in the Middle\nEast. Mr. Pelant, who had some small scale marine construction experience, did not have\nopen cell experience. With PND, he put together the proposal's technical and\nmanagement approach and the preliminary schedule. Mr. Nottingham was PND's main\nrepresentative. Mr. Hartley, a PND principal, was not involved at the proposal stage and\nMr. Nottingham did not consult him. (Tr. 2/210-12, 4/9, 16-17)\n\n       33. The parties agree that CCI submitted its alternative open cell pier proposal to\nthe Corps on or about 23 June 2008 (app. br. at 16; gov't br. at 8, ~ 13). Mr. Pelant\nprepared its narrative, with input from others at PCI, PND and CCI. He worked with\nMessrs. JeffMekinda and Hutton of CCI on the pricing. He described Mr. Mekinda as a\ntradesman and plumber and Mr. Hutton as an architect who had worked in business\ndevelopment. (Ex. G-26, part 1 at 32-33)\n\n       34. On 23 July 2008, the CO noted that CCI had not submitted a dredging cost.\nHe also stated that its cost proposal was very high compared to the government's estimate\nand asked for a final revised one. (R4, tab 156 at 177701-02; tr. 8/93) On about\n14 August 2008, CCI submitted a revised proposal (ex. A-4). Under \"Schedule\nconstraints specific to Engineering,\" it stated:\n\n             a. Geotechnical and marine/bathymetric surveys. These are\n                hard constraints as it is critical to identify exactly where\n                the proposed port structure will be most advantageously\n                located. The information from the surveys is critical and\n\n\n                                            13\n\f                 drives the design as well as material quantities for\n                 procurement and civil works. We feel that there is not\n                 enough information provided in the RFP and subsequent\n                 amendments to properly ascertain this information to the\n                 required degree of accuracy for quality design and\n                 engineering. [Emphasis added]\n\n(!d. at 8304)\n\n       3 5. CCI does not claim, and there is no evidence of record, that it performed any\ngeological testing of the site prior to contract award. There is no written analysis of\nrecord by Mr. Nottingham, or anyone else from PND, CCI, or PCI, at the time CCI\nsubmitted its initial and amended proposals, of conditions that would allow land-based\nconstruction or any contemporaneous written expression of reliance by CCI upon the AR\nor USAID reports. CCI's proposals did not contain a defined construction plan\nconcerning the earthworks and filling operations or any statement of assumed ground or\nsoil conditions. They did not mention a crane pad or 280-ton crane, a plan to use a\nland-based crane to drive sheet pile, or any land-based construction approach.\n{Tr. 6/110-11, 13/179; see ex. G-16 at 9, 22) However, CCI claims without rebuttal that\nan attached photograph depicted open cell dock construction from the land {app. reply br.\nat 6).\n\n       36. On about 20 August 2008 the Corps requested \"Best and Final\" offers. CCI\nresponded on 26 August 2008. The Corps found that its open cell proposal was the most\nacceptable ofthe proposals. (R4, tab 160; tr. 11150, 8/36, 39, 45-46)\n\n        37. Mr. Burke asked Robert Dyer, a well-known consultant well experienced in\nconstruction management, to perform a risk analysis ofCCI's proposal (tr. 1162-63,\n143-44; ex. G-27 at 93). Mr. Dyer's 3 September 2008 analysis identified several areas\nof significant to severe risk, including that CCI had not done a project estimate or seen\nthe base contract. There was very little estimating breakdown, with much of the material\nfrom Iraqi subcontractors. He acknowledged that CCI wanted its \"foot in the door\" in the\nMiddle East but found profit, overhead, construction and design contingencies, and cash\nflow inadequacies in its proposal. General project site conditions were not discussed. He\ninterpreted the proposal as carrying 5% profit, only about half of which would go to CCI,\nwhereas major foreign and United States construction contractors in Iraq had 30 to 40%\nprofit factors. While he had been told that the proposal included home office overhead,\nhe found the amounts to be unacceptably low and inconsistent with its normal 13.5% rate.\nHe noted that CCI had reduced its price by over $7 million and opined that there could\neasily be a shortfall of over $15,600,000. Citing the tight project schedule, with only 10\nmonths for the base period and liquidated damages of$2,700 per day, he suggested it\ncould be a good decision to step away. (R4, tab 162 at 162753-57)\n\n\n                                            14\n\f        38. According to Mr. Burke, CCI's proposal did not include overhead and profit.\nAccording to him and Messrs. Nunn and Pelant, it expected further negotiations on those\nmatters. (Ex. G-26, part 2 at 244-46; tr. 1159, 2/161-62); but see R4, tab 173 (Hutton\n16 September 2008 email to Burke (\"we may be taking this project at a lower profit in\nanticipation of other work.\")) On 7 September 2008 Mr. Pelant notified the CO that CCI\nexpected to negotiate overhead and profit (ex. A-5 at 12688). On 9 September 2008\nMr. Pelant notified the project team and/or others that CCI would pose questions and\nconcerns to the Corps because \"we feel we can't successfully prosecute this project for\nthe price with the amount of unknowns that still exist\" (R4, tab 163 at 16296).\n\n       39. On 10 September 2008, the CO notified Mr. Pelant that PCI's $38,462,386.58\noffer for the base and option 1 periods had been accepted and attached her signed copy of\nthe contract, which named PCI as the offeror (ex. A-6 at 12019-20, 12036).\n\n       40. Mr. Burke asked the CO about overhead and profit. The Corps does not deny\nthat she said it was out of her control at that point, but there would be contract additions\nand change orders with higher overhead and profit rates. Mr. Burke felt that, under those\ncircumstances, CCI would make money. The Corps never informed CCI that it was\ncompelled to sign the contract; it elected to do so. (Tr. 1/59-60, 61-62, 156-57, 8/51)\n\n        41. The contract, awarded 10 September 2008, incorporated the above RFP\nprovisions and contained clause SCR 4, RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CONTRACTOR FOR\nDESIGN-MAY 2002. It also included the government's exercise of its option for Pier 2,\na floating pier. The contract completion date was 27 September 2009. (R4, tab 3 at 1-2,\n6, 24, 102-05 of 114; tr. 2/79; see R4, tab 19 at 1; tr. 5/124)\n\n       42. On 16 September 2008 Mr. Nottingham sent to PCI's Paul Johnson (tr. 2/91,\n149) a drawing of\"immediate survey and bathymetry needs,\" stated that four soil borings\nwere needed, and specified boring and sampling criteria (R4, tab 171 at 7774). The same\nday Mr. Johnson reported about a meeting with PND:\n\n                 •   The need to get IMMEDIATE efforts on the field work\n                     was emphasized over and over again. It was apparent\n                     that due to a lack of data on soils, bathemetry, etc. [sic]\n                     could really pose design delays ....\n\n\n\n                 •   PND needs to get a copy of the contract between\n                     CCI/PCI and the Corps for the project - so that they\n\n\n\n                                             15\n\f                      can clearly get an idea of the design considerations,\n                      etc.\n                  •   Lee discussed his desire to get spec requirements for\n                      the soils needed for the back-fill from PND. PND\n                      outlined their requirement for gradation and the\n                      threshold requirements for the first 70ft of the\n                      back-fill. It was initially felt that the previously\n                      dredged material should work.... PND stated that after\n                      the first 70ft, ... could essentially use residual material\n                      found on site or other fill. The only gradation\n                      requirement was near the sheet pile.\n\n\n\n                         •   Need 2 150 ton cranes to install sheet pile ....\n                             Back-jill can actually be started prior to receipt\n                             ofsheet piles and will serve as crane staging\n                             point rather than using barge based cranes to\n                             install sheet pile.\n\n(R4, tab 174) (Italics added)\n\n        43. The Corps contends, based upon the foregoing and otherwise, that CCI shifted\nfrom a marine-based to a land-based construction method after contract award (e.g., gov't\nbr. at 36; see tr. 13/164). CCI counters that land-hased construction was always\ncontemplated (app. reply br. at 5). As noted, CCI's proposal did not directly address its\nconstruction method. Mr. Nunn testified credibly that, during the proposal stage, there\nwas no consideration apart from land-based construction of the open cell system (finding\n17; tr. 2/154-55). Mr. Hutton testified at his deposition that construction was intended to\nbe by land-based crane (ex. G-27 at 12). We find that the weight of the evidence is that\nCCI intended to use a land-based construction method for its open cell system.\n\n      44. PCI and SAR apparently entered into a contract dated 10 October 2008 in\nconnection with the project (R4, tab 177). At some point PCI terminated the contract due\nto SAR's alleged failure to perform (ex. G-26, part II at 207-09).\n\n       45. PND and PCI entered into an agreement for professional engineering services\nin connection with the project effective 10 October 2008. Prior to the Corps' contract\naward, PCI did not ask for, and PND did not perform, a constructability analysis or\nevaluate the equipment or materials the contractor would need. Mr. Nottingham did not\nprepare a formal slope stability analysis to determine if the beach could support a crane\npad, but testified that the borings indicated it could. He did not calculate a factor of\n\n                                              16\n\fsafety (FOS) based upon a load on shore. He was not consulted about crane pad design\nand did not do any written analysis of the AR. (R4, tab 178; tr. 21100-04, 240)\n\n       46. The pre-construction meeting occurred on 18 October 2008 (see ex. A-13 at\n19191 ). CCI and PCI entered into an agreement dated 27 October 2008 concerning their\nteaming arrangement (R4, tab 180). The NTP apparently issued in late October or in\nNovember 2008 (see gov't br. at 36, PF 100 (unrebutted as to NTP)).\n\n        47. On 19 November 2008, Carl McNabb, a PND engineer (tr. 2178, 194), wrote\nto Mr. Nunn that, for its pile schedule, PND was making several assumptions about the\nsoil, one of the more significant being that the sand layer was at -11m. He noted that the\nAR's average SPT value from the clay layer in the soil logs was what PND would\nnormally expect from stiff clays but the clay was described as very soft to soft. He asked\nabout more soil borings and a hydrographic survey. (R4, tab 184 at 18918)\n\n       48. On 19 November 2008 Mr. Nunn inquired ofGRS about core drilling by\nWeston that PCI had observed during site investigations. GRS referred him to the AR,\nstating that it had supported a preliminary design analysis by Weston in 2007 for an L&T\npier system at the site. (Ex. A-98; tr. 8/81)\n\n       49. On 20 November 2008, Mr. McNabb informed Mr. Nunn that PND was on\ntrack for a sheet pile order:\n\n              [B]ased on assumptions anticipating the worst case in existing\n              conditions. This is due to the lack ofsoil data with consistent\n              soil parameters and firm vertical control. It's also due to the\n              bathymetry based on a photo that lacks horizontal control.\n\n(R4, tab 185 at 18925) (Emphasis added)\n\n        50. On 22 November 2008 Mr. McNabb informed Mr. Nunn that \"[w]e've been\npouring over the [AR]. .. from the start\" (R4, tab 187 at 18405). Mr. McNabb noted boring\nissues, including that the sand layer location was not clear and \"[t]he clay is described as\n'soft'; the blow counts indicate it's stiff; while the lab results for the cohesion (c) varies\ndrastically\" (id.). He stated that more borings were needed and if reliable information\ncould not be obtained \"now,\" confirmation during construction must be obtained (id.).\nMr. McNabb's reference to \"from the start\" is not clear. There is no deposition testimony\nof his of record and he did not testify at the hearing. The Corps contends without\npersuasive rebuttal, and William Gunderson, PND's Designer of Record, testified at his\ndeposition, that, apart from Mr. Nottingham, PND's design team became involved in the\nproject after contract award. PND did not analyze the contractor's means and methods of\nconstruction. (Ex. A-214 at 12, ex. G-28 at 28, 30-32; gov't br. at 36, PF 100)\n\n\n                                              17\n\f        51. On 23 November 2008 Mr. Pelant expressed concern about a design change\nreducing the cells to 39, 44% fewer than proposed, but increasing steel tonnage and cost\nto the client by about $500,000 (R4, tab 188 at 172448). Mr. McNabb responded:\n\n              The tonnage is high because we don't have solid data on\n              where the requisite sand layer is. During construction, if\n              we're not deep enough and into the sand, we won't meet the\n              req'd safety factors. Plus we don't really know what the\n              cohesion of the clay is. It's probably quite high, which is\n              good, but what if it's not?\n\n(!d. at 172447)\n\n      52. On 24 November 2008 Mr. Pelant expressed concern to Mr. Nunn that the\nSeptember completion date was causing them to rush and the designers to be overly\nconservative, at significant cost (R4, tab 188 at 172446). He responded:\n\n              The Corps knows we are tight on $ and they are working with\n              us.\n\n              We can still work two cranes side-by-side if we need to juice\n              up production ... The Corps will give us some schedule relief,\n              if the boats are not coming until2010, but I don't want more\n              time. I want more Corps/FMS work. Early finish should get\n              us just that.\n\n(R4, tab 188 at 172446)\n\n       53. Mr. McNabb disagreed with Mr. Nunn's 24 November 2008 statement that\none AR BH was \"practically in our Start-Up zone of influence, so we should be very\ncomfortable with the pile design and sheet lengths in this ... area.\" Mr. McNabb referred to\nprior emails \"regarding problems with existing bore logs.\" (R4, tab 189 at 18936)\n\n       54. On 26 November 2008 Mr. McNabb stated that AR problems included:\n\n              1. The cohesive properties of the clay vary widely in the\n              report, from 12 to 34 kpa .... The average SPT ... values in the\n              clay layer range from 4 to ll, ... normally expected from stiff\n              or very stiff clays ( c=50 kpa or larger). Meanwhile, the clay\n              is described in the report as very soft to soft.\n\n\n\n                                              18\n\f              2. No surface elevations for each [BH] location were\n              provided.\n\n              3. Normally, a larger number of [BHs] are provided, typically\n              on a 200-ft. grid.\n\n              I haven't heard back from Andrea Test Laboratories about my\n              inquiries on the report.\n\n(R4, tab 189 at 18934)\n\n        55. Per Mr. Nottingham, PND sought more borings to verify its design. The\nexisting ones showed \"sand, a very hard layer ... a very good foundation\" (tr. 2/49), and it\nwanted to verify that, once it was offshore, it would encounter the same strata. However,\nit learned that it would take four months to obtain more borings and decided to evaluate\nthe strata through the construction response when it drove the sheet piles. (!d.)\n\n       56. At the 3 5% design review on 17-18 December 2008, Mr. Gunderson stated\nthat one reason the open cell concept was right for the project \"is that you have difficult\nsoil conditions here\" and it was easily adaptable (R4, tab 114 at 2; ex. A-12; tr. 8/61-62).\n\n        57. Navy LT Daniel Gutierrez, a civil engineer, was the CO's Representative\n(COR) from just before the 35% design meeting until5 June 2009. Mr. Nunn viewed him\nas the best COR he had worked with in his then 23 years' experience and subsequently.\n(Tr. 2/199, 8/66, 10/6, 7, 16, 67, 74)\n\n       58. PND's DESIGN CALCULATIONS report of January 2009 (R4, tab 116) stated\nthat design soil profiles and properties were based on the AR and that:\n\n              Because of limited geotechnical information available for the\n              site, some significant assumptions are made for the design of\n              the seawall. Most notably, the elevation of the sand layer is\n              assumed to be 11 m throughout the site ....\n\n\n\n              Fill: The material for the fill/embankment layer has not been\n              determined, but is expected to be granular ....\n\n              Clay: The clay layer is overlain by the fill layer and consists\n              of slightly overconsolidated clays and sandy clays. The\n\n\n\n                                             19\n\f              design soil properties are typical for very soft clays, although\n              the blow counts in the logs indicate much stiffer soils ...\n\n              Sand: The sand layer is overlain by the clay layer. The\n              consistency of the soil, based on the blow counts, is dense to\n              very dense ...\n\n\n\n             It should be noted that there appears to be some\n             inconsistencies in the [AR]. Also, none of the [BH] are within\n             1OOm of the proposed seawall face. Thus, the assumed\n             elevations and soil properties based on the [AR] report may\n             differ significantly from the actual site conditions.\n\n(R4, tab 116 at 10-11) (Emphasis added) Design soil properties included in a table in\nPND's report show the cohesion of clay in its undrained state at 20 kPa, which\ncorresponds to \"Very soft\" clays (R4, tab 2 at 15, tab 116 at 11).\n\n       59. On 1 January 2009 CCI had the Basra \"University Lab\" do BH drilling.\n\"North\" borings were attempted in the area of AR BH No.2 but were not successful.\n\"South\" borings were taken about 10 to 12m past the visual toe of the rip rap slope.\n(R4, tab 192 at 62889; tr. 2/167-69; see ex. A-249) In January 2009 the laboratory\nsubmitted a soil investigation report to the \"SAR Group\" (Basra report) which stated that\nthe purpose was to explore the site's subsoils for foundation design for the new port, and\nthat two BH were drilled on the shore at locations selected by the SAR Group (R4, tab 21\nat 4). The soil strata at the Basra report's BH Nos. 1 and 2 were reported to be as\nfollows:\n\n             1. (BHJ)\n                     1-     The top soil layer which extends to a depth of\n                             5.0m consists of fill material (subbase).\n                    11-     The next layer which extends to the end of\n                             boring consists of dense to very dense, red to\n                             brown, poorly graded and sometimes well\n                             graded sand.\n\n             2. (BH2)\n                    1-      The top soil layer which extends to a depth of\n                             l.Om consists offill material (subbase).\n                    11-     The next layer which extends to a depth of\n                             15. Om consists of clayey silt with trace or a\n\n\n                                            20\n\f                             little ofsand with low plasticity. The\n                             consistency of the upper part of this layer is\n                             soft clay (up to depth 12.5m) and then changed\n                             to stiff clay.\n                     111-   The bearing stratum which appears at a depth of\n                             15.0m and extends to the end of boring\n                             consists of dense to very dense, red to brown,\n                             poorly graded and sometimes well graded\n                              sand.\n\n(R4, tab 21 at 10) (Emphasis added) The distance ofthese apparently \"south\" BHs from\nthose in the AR is unclear.\n\n      60. On 5 January 2009, Jim Bates, a professional engineer and PCI quality control\n(QC) manager (R4, tab 209; tr. 21171), summarized the upper strata in the Basra report's\n\"south\" BH for Messrs. McNabb and Nunn:\n\n              0-1 m, access ramp fill\n\n              1.5-5m, grey very soft silty clay with organic material\n\n              6.5-1 Om, grey to black very soft clayey silt to silty clay\n\n(R4, tab 192 at 62889) (Emphasis added) On 12 January 2009 he reiterated that the clay\nwas described as \"very soft\" (R4, tab 196 at 23955).\n\n       61. On 12 January 2009 Hal Dreyer, president ofPCI's subcontractor\nGunderboom, Inc., of Anchorage, Alaska, conveyed his concern to CCI's Mr. Hutton that\nMr. Nunn had underestimated the project work and time (R4, tab 197). Among other\nthings, he noted that the river had \"extreme sedimentation\" (id. at 176333). Gunderboom\nwas owned by several people, including Messrs. Dreyer, Gunderson and Nottingham.\nMr. Dreyer had considerable experience successfully superintending significant open cell\nconstruction projects and Mr. Nottingham trusted his judgment. (Tr. 2/87-89; see R4,\ntab 383 at 161460). Although he tried, Mr. Dreyer was unable to visit the site due to\nadministrative issues (tr. 1/78-79,5/210,9/60-61, 87). Gunderboom's project\nsuperintendent, Dave Robinson, very experienced in open cell construction, sent daily\nreports, which Mr. Dreyer and Kevin Cassidy, Gunderboom's experienced project\nmanager, reviewed. Messrs. Robinson and Cassidy also communicated orally.\nMr. Cassidy visited the site before construction and once after it started. (R4, tab 251 at\n116143; tr. 9/44, 46, 103, 114, 117, 12/22)\n\n\n\n\n                                              21\n\f       62. PCI's time and materials subcontract with Gunderboom, to drive pile and\nbuild the open cell dock structure, was signed effective 20 January 2009. It did not\ninclude building the temporary crane pad and Gunderboom w as not responsible for fill,\nexcept for managing placement of the fill that w ould go into the cells. At the time of\nsubcontracting, Mr. Dreyer did not review the project solicitation or the AR. He had not\nbeen involved with CCI's proposal. (Tr. 9/19-20,30, 42, 81; see R4, tab 383 at 161460)\n\n        63. Throughout the project Mr. Dreyer was highly critical ofPCI, claiming, inter\nalia, that its personnel lacked experience and knowledge and did not appreciate or know\nhow to work with the soil conditions, or understand the need for an engineered fill design\n(R4, tabs 197, 201 at 175506, tab 216 at 20660 ; tab 221 at 8204, tabs 232, 233 at 14427,\ntabs 234, 236 at 36835, tabs 237, 238 at 37316, tabs 239, 248, 250 at 35610, tab 251 at\n116142, tab 272 at 20573-74, tab 370 at 162666, tabs 326, 383 at 161466; tr. 9/47, 50-52,\n57-60, 62-63 , 79). A few of his allegations are set forth below.\n\n        64. Shortly after the 99% design meeting on 10-12 February 2009, construction,\nlate in starting, began (exs. A-19, -20, G-27 at 20).\n\n        65. An open cell schedule must include time for fill to consolidate, which depends\nupon its quality. At a 26 February 2009 contractor meeting, it was noted that, assuming\ncells could be completed in five days each, the project was about two months past the\ncompletion date; it would be necessary to run a double shift; and PCI's schedule did not\nhave an item for \"settlement,\" estimated to take about six weeks. The work plan under\ndiscussion did not include crane pad activities. (R4, tab 203 at 4891 ; tr. 3/54, 9/39)\n\n       66. Although it had contemplated using two 150-ton cranes (see findings 42, 52),\nMr. Nunn concurred with the Corps that CCI's ultimate plan was to construct a crane pad\nabove the tides, 75m into the water, pull a 280-ton crane on to it, and extend the crane' s\narm to open cell one. He acknowledged that PND was not consulted about any crane pad\ndesign prior to work on the beach and there were no design drawings or crane pad\nspecifications at the time, other than a materials requirement. (Tr. 2/258-59) .\n\n       67. On about 25 March 2009 PCI executed a work order for crane pad\nconstruction with subcontractor Ravsan Raheem of Basra. He w as to provide Type C\nmaterial for a crane pad 40m wide and 83m out, at an average depth of 4m. PCI was to\nprovide the design layout. The subcontractor was to push Type C and/or stockpiled\nmaterial over the top of the seawall; grade, w ater and compact it to 95%; grade the pad so\nthe leading edge was 7m above mean lower low water (MIL W); place the fill in .3m lifts;\nand lay geotextile fabric to prevent fill loss . (R4, tab 208)\n\n       68. A 28 March 2009 checklist by QC manager Bates pertained to the work road\nand crane pad, which he called a non-definable work feature. Unclassified fill was to be\n\n\n                                            22\n\fdelivered when work started; the laydown pad would serve as material storage initially;\nthe work road would be built from unclassified material with 7% minimum and 10%\nmaximum fines; material was to be in 30cm lifts and compacted to 95%; water was to be\nadded to get 95% compaction; final grade would be at 6.0 above MLLW; and CCI was\nsetting up an on-site laboratory for sieve and compaction testing. (R4, tab 209)\n\n       69. On 29 March 2009 PCI began placing unclassified fill for its work road and\ncrane pad. It had hired Iraqi subcontractor Noor Alahmed to provide the fill. Mr. Hartley\ndescribed the pad as consisting of imported sand without geosynthetic reinforcement.\n(Ex. A-91 at 36364; see R4, tab 131 at 3/29-31/09, tabs 241 , 253)\n\n        70. Starting on 30 March 2009 the work road and crane pad material suffered\nfrom \"pumping\" silts and weak clays, cracking, and sloughing (R4, tab 17 at B, tab 130,\ntr. 2/172-73, 182-83, 6/48; ex. S-72).\n\n        71. On 1 April2009 QC Bates opined to Mr. Nunn and others:\n\n               As Samuel [Pelant] said, the underlying material is the\n               problem and not the fill. Base[ d] on the borings and my\n               observations, the underlying silt/clay has near zero strength.\n               At first we thought pumping silt was the problem. Now I\n               believe liquefaction occurred due to the placement of fill (i.e.,\n               rapid loading) and vibratory compaction (i.e., earthquake).\n               Most likely it was a combination of the two ....\n\n(R4, tab 212 at 62760)\n                                                     !\n\n               The fill we are bringing in is good. · Let me qualifY that. ...\n               Yesterday (3/31) we received material that wasn't as good as\n               the first two days and we dinged them on price. We also\n               halted the delivery of this material by late morning.\n\n               We constructed the work road as you suggested by making\n               sure the top of the fill was above the high tide line. That is\n               when the problems started. The underlying silty clay/clayey\n               silt [h ]as very little strength (N=2 for this material in the south\n               boring). [3] By placing the fill load on this stuff, I believe we\n               caused liquefaction to occur .... For me this was confirmed by\n               observing the beach in front of the fill this morning at low\n               tide. A classic liquefaction failure with blocks of material\n\n3\n    \"N\" values are the number of blows needed to drive a special sampler 12\" (tr. 6/34).\n\n                                               23\n\f              sloughing and flow of material in the lower portions of the\n              beach. It looked like pictures ofEarthquake Park from 1964 .\n\n              .. .Keep in mind that the south boring had 12.5 m of this loon\n              [poop] (old geotechnical term).\n\n(R4, tab 212 at 62758-59)\n\n       72. The COR was on site shortly after lay down area and work road construction\nbegan. He saw that CCI was using a local borrow pit for fill , rather than an engineered\nfill. He described it as a very gritty, silty soil. (Tr. 10/41, 43-46) Prior to April 2009 CCI\nhad not begun work on an engineered fill for the crane pad; into May 2009 it continued to\nimport fill (R4, tab 132 at 4/2/09 et seq. , tab 134 at 5/2/09 et seq. ; tr. 2/254). The parties\nagree that the supplier was terminated but CCI does not concede that it was due to the\nmaterial's poor quality (gov' t br. at 48, PF 134; app. reply br. at 24). On 7 April 2009\nMr. Gunderson inquired of Mr. Nunn:\n\n              As you have begun placement of the fill out to create a work\n              pad, it would be an appropriate time to do another boring to\n              get a profile of the sediments under the fill you are placing.\n              We are assuming that you are using some fabric under the fill\n              as you move offshore? I know that Hal [Dreyer] has\n              requested an engineered fill where the crane is going to work\n              from. Since we have not heard from PCI can we assume that\n              you are working with your fill contractor on this? ...\n\n(R4, tab 218) Mr. Nunn asked Mr. Gunderson for an engineered fill design. On 12 April\n2009 work road and crane pad activities were suspended to obtain it. (R4, tab 219 at\n10672; app. supp. R4, tab S-2) Gunderboom had sought an engineered fill because it was\nconcerned about the competency of the underlying material, the native soils, and safety\nregarding the 280-ton crane (tr. 9/45-46).\n\n       73. On 10 April 2009 a QC report sketch and photograph showed that, apparently\nbeginning at a 6m elevation, there was \" [c]atastrophic failure (liquefaction) of in-situ silts\nand clays with continual failure of fill from 25 to 50 meters\" (R4, tab 223 at 19954).\n\n        74. On 17 April2009 PCI issued a notice to proceed to Gunderboom. Mr. Dreyer\nstated that his need for appropriate fill to support a 280-ton crane that would be operating\na vibratory hammer, equipment acquisition delays, and work crew composition issues\nwould affect the schedule. (R4, tab 233 at 14427) On 21 April2009 Mr. Gunderson\nstressed the need for a boring where the crane would sit before placing it. Mr. McNabb\nopined that the work pad had to be in place first. (R4, tab 247 at 4566)\n\n\n                                              24\n\f         75. After the slope failure at the end of March 2009, PND was asked to advise\n PCI. Mr. Hartley arrived in Iraq on 25 April2009. As ofthat date CCI was attributi?g\n soil problems to dredge pond leakage and overflow and that the work area was disturbed\n by manmade activities. Mr. Hartley evaluated the soils available for fill for crane pad\n construction by visual classification using ASTM standards. He found sand with 5%\n silica and a small amount of gravel, not unusual for crane pad construction. Rip rap\n would have been better but it was unavailable. He did vane shear tests in the top soil\n surface and used rebar to see how soft the material was. He roughly assessed shear\n strengths for PND's Seattle office to make a soil stability analysis. The field values that\n he obtained were lower than the AR data. (R4, tab 24; tr. 4/18, 20, 42-43, 46-47)\n\n        76. On 27 April 2009 Gunderboom's project manager Cassidy referred to \"the\n mess [PCI] made in the area where the crane [needs] to go\" (R4, tab 251 at 116143).\n Mr. Dreyer worried that PCI might have \"completely ruined the sub base material and\n rendered it useless, which was the concern from the outset\" (id. at 116142).\n\n         77. On 30 April 2009 Mr. Nunn asked for a contract extension due, inter alia, to\n  \"changed conditions\" in the work road location due to excess water and pore pressures\n. from dredge spoils pits (R4, tab 25 at 1). On 3 May 2009 the contractor attributed a\n  \"small mud wave\" to dredge pond seepage (app. supp. R4, tab S-3).\n\n        78. On 1 May 2009 Mr. Hartley wrote that he had recommended to PCI that it get\n BHs out by the cells as soon as possible and that \"we really do no[t] know much about\n soil conditions in these areas\" (R4, tab 259 at 14042).\n\n        79. On 3 May 2009 Mr. Hartley asked for a slope stability analysis under certain\n conditions, seeking an FOS of at least 1.1, preferably 1.3 with the crane loads, based upon\n industry standard for a minimum FOS. On 4 May 2009 Mr. McNabb supplied an\n analysis, showing a 0.99 FOS, indicating failure. (R4, tab 267; tr. 4/175, 178-79, 184-85)\n\n        80. On 7 May 2009 the COR wrote that CCI was behind schedule, stating:\n\n               The main portion of this delay has been caused by an\n               unexpected field condition in placing their crane pad. There\n               is evident soil instability at the 25m mark in the tidal zone that\n               has impeded progress because the fill material begins to\n               creep/slide into the river. The start of pile driving ... has been\n               postponed ... because of the issues with the crane pad and also\n               the pending delivery of the 280Ton Crane from Kuwait.. ..\n\n\n\n\n                                              25\n\f (Ex. A-38 at 23110) He stated that PND' s geotechnical engineer (apparently Mr. Hartley)\n attributed instability to dredging, which increased the deposition of very loose silty\n material with low bearing capacity, and to increased pore water pressure from dredge\n ponds, which increased the effects of liquefaction when compacted or disturbed (id.).\n\n         81. The COR signed an interim satisfactory performance rating dated 7 May 2009\n stating CCI was very cooperative and had effectively tackled \"difficult problems in a\n challenging work environment\" but was behind schedule. Its QC documentation and\n submittals were rated marginal. (R4, tab 30; tr. 101129)\n\n       82. On 13 May 2009 Tim Fisher of PND circulated a crane pad drawing to PND\n and PCI for review (R4, tab 283). CCI has not rebutted the Corps' contention that this\n was PND's first design drawing of record ofthe crane pad.\n\n          83. On 13 May 2009 the COR issued an RFP to CCI under the contract's Changes\n  clause for \"Drainage of Dredge Spoils Ponds\" (R4, tab 32). As Mr. Nunn described it, an\n  Iraqi Ministry of Defense contractor, not on-site during SAR' s visit, was dredging around\n. Pier 3 by the time CCI arrived and dumping the spoils into dredge ponds which came to\n  the edge of CCI' s laydown area and overlapped nearly into the crane pad area. At one\n  time water from an overfilled, breached, dredge pond came near the access road leading\n  to the laydown area. CCI feared flooding. It saw sheet flow across the beach after the\n  tide had gone down and little water \"volcanoes\" below the dikes. It concluded there was\n  no other water source except the dredge pond pits and this 3m of water sitting above its\n  project had adverse effects. (Tr. 21197-98)\n\n          84. On 13 May 2009 the crane arrived in parts (supp. R4, tab S-3 at 5114/09 QC\n report (QCR); see R4, tab 17 at 6). There was no stable crane pad in place at this time or\n later (tr. 10/91-92). Mr. Hartley left the project site on 15 May 2009 (tr. 4/51 ).\n\n        85. The COR prepared a price negotiation memorandum (PNM) dated 22 May\n 2009 about the alleged Pier 3 dredge spoils pond problem. The proposed change was to\n allow CCI to procure pumps to drain excess water from the ponds to relieve excess pore\n water pressure and permit compaction and stabilization of the Pier 1 fill material.\n (Ex. A-41) The PNM stated:\n\n               The crane pad for the construction of Open cell one appears to\n               [rest] on top of a very fine layer of sandy-clay, which is\n               transmitting a flow of water at a greater rate then [sic] other\n               locations alorig the water front... This water is leading to an\n               increase of instability of the shore line at 25m and causing the\n               fill material to creep and slide into the river.\n\n\n\n                                             26\n\f(Ex. A-41 at 52177) The proposed $21,250.37amount included overhead and profit at\n19% and 17.5% (id. at 52178). CCI alleges, without contradiction, that these were the\nrates to which the Corps had agreed for its options 1 through 6 proposals (app. br. at 27).\n\n        86. At some point prior to 23 May 2009, CCI decided to construct six temporary\nshoring cells. In its request for equitable adjustment (REA) (below), CCI attributed the\ndecision to a need to protect soils in the construction zone from continuing silt deposits\nfrom dredging. It stated that dredging and dredge pond seepage had left the soils weaker\nand more slippery than expected. (R4, tab 17 at 6) Mr. Nunn described dredges dumping\nin front of the project instead of south of the border where they were supposed to go,\nresulting in \"loads and loads\" of slime, but stated that the major problem was at the dense\nsand level and concerned efforts to try to stabilize the beach (tr. 2/276-77).\n\n       87. On 1 June 2009 CCI hired John Smithson, an experienced superintendent,\nwith open cell and schedule experience, to be its on-site representative, but left PCI in\ncharge of project management (ex. A-53 ; tr. 1/87-88, 5/107-08, 110-11 , 114-15, 178).\n\n       88. Effective 1 June 2009, bilateral Modification (Mod.) No. P00006 issued, at the\nfirm fixed-price of$21,250.37, for the dredge pond work. It increased the contract price\nto $44,923 ,615.70; kept the 27 September 2009 completion date; and included CCI's\nrelease of the government \"from any and all liability under this contract for further\nequitable adjustments attributable to changes resulting from this modification.\"\n(R4, tab 9 at 2) The Corps has not raised any release defense in this appeal.\n\n       89. Full work on the crane pad began on 3 June 2009, but on 8 June a mud wave\ndeveloped in the pad, sections of the pad slid into the water and the whole pad came apart\n(supp. R4, tab S-4).\n\n       90. On 30 May 2009 the COR had issued a letter of concern to CCI about\nschedule and on 10 June he sought a recovery plan. As of 13 June 2009, inability to build\na crane pad was stopping work in the field. (Ex. f\\ -49 at 11283; tr. 101109-1 0) At some\npoint in June 2009, COR Gutierrez left the project. Kenneth Bright, a supervisory civil\nengineer with the Corps, succeeded him. (See exs. A-48, -49)\n\n       91. The crane was moved onto the pad on about 14 June 2009. On about 21 June\na large mud wave developed and there was a 75m failure in the fill. The fill created\nshelves separated by large tension cracks and the crane pad suffered displacement.\nThrough 21 July 2009 CCI continued to encounter problems with sloughing clay, tension\ncracks, a mud wave and sheared geogrid. (R4, tab 17, ex. Kat 1, ex. L at 1; supp. R4,\ntab S-4, 6/21/09 QCR at 1-2, tab S-5 , 7115/09 QCR at 1, 7116/09 QCR et seq.)\n\n\n\n\n                                             27\n\f        92. In its REA, CCI claimed that another change to its original design caused by\ndiffering site conditions was the construction of \"Circle Cell No. 1,\" or the \"Single Cell\nCrane Pad.\" It was to sit behind and between two temporary shoring cells to protect and\nsupport the beach soils upon which the crane would rest. (R4, tab 17 at 10)\n\n       93. CCI continued into July 2009 to attribute crane pad failures to dredge ponds\nand the discharge and deposit of dredged materials-soft, loose, weak sediments (R4,\ntab 17, ex. P at 2; supp. R4, tab S-4, 6/24/09 QCR at 1; 6/25/09 QCR at 2; ex. A-65).\n\n       94. On 29 June 2009 Mr. Nunn opined to the COR that the dredge spoil dumping\nwas a changed condition. He alleged that, while CCI was well aware of dredging in the\nwaterway and, on a different project, he had been responsible for dredging the North Port,\nthe material had not been dumped back into the waterway in front of the Iraqi Navy Port;\nthe Corps should have alerted offerors of the dredge spoil issues during the solicitation\nphase; and CCI saw the conditions only after mobilization and 99% design completion,\nduring pre-construction activities. (Ex. A-58 at 8867-68)\n\n       95. In June 2009, PCI and PND continued to exchange emails about the need for\nmore BHs (e.g., R4, tab 311 at 18628 (\"plan for confirmation [BHs] , reflecting the\ncurrent access plans,\" \"there is only one old Andrea lab [BH] in the vicinity of our current\nwork, and PND had taken exception to the reliability of that data\")).\n\n         96. On 3 July 2009 Mr. Nunn notified the COR of two alleged changed\nconditions, again pertaining to dredge spoil deposits and dredge pond seepage affecting\nthe fill and crane pad (ex. A-64 at 22155).\n\n        97. Initially CCI was doing visual materials testing that was not certified or\nverified by an appropriate entity. Eventually it had Basra State University do on-site and\noff-site testing. CCI did not establish a Corps-approved on-site laboratory until late June,\nearly July 2009, after COR Bright's arrival. (Tr. 11 /35, 43)\n\n       98. On 6 July 2009 CCI's Mr. Smithson commented on a draft recovery plan:\n\n              [I]t reads that using \"local material\" is the reason the fill\n              failed. I think we should make it clear that the reason was\n              because of the water seepage from the dredge ponds and the\n              dredge spoils sediment are the reason the fill failed. That way\n              we are consistent with what we are saying in our REA ' s.\n\n(R4, tab 353 at 162633)\n\n\n\n\n                                             28\n\f       99. On 7 July 2009 National Laboratory began a site investigation for CCI. On\n8 July PCI discontinued it due to alleged incompetence. (R4, tab 361 at 11877 (\"National\nLab was a joke\"); supp. R4, tab S-5, 7/7-7/8/09 QCRs at 1).\n\n      100. On 9 July 2009 the area in front ofthe crane and parts of the access road\ndropped about 15cm with a massive mud wave forming in the temporary and circle cells.\nCell movement was observed. (Supp. R4, tab S-5 , 7/9/09 QCR at 1-2)\n\n        101. On 14 July 2009 CCI gave another notice of changed conditions pertaining to\n(1) high water levels from the Pier 3 contractor's dredge ponds being over-filled and\nraising the water table on and adjacent to CCI's work area, allowing water to flow around\nand under its work site, and (2) dumped dredge spoils resulting in unstable sediments\nbeing deposited onto CCI's work area (ex. A-86 at 15239).\n\n     102. At least as of 14 July 2009 Mr. Smithson was highly critical ofPCI's project\nmanagement (see R4, tab 370 at 162666).\n\n        103. The COR' s 16 July 2009 letter of concern sought a revised schedule, upon\nthreat of an interim unsatisfactory evaluation, and a recovery plan (ex. A-82).\n\n         104. On 19 July 2009 Bradley West, president of West Construction Company,\nInc. (West), issued a recovery plan based upon marine floating gear, including barges, to\ninstall the sheet pile. West had extensive experience in open cell construction using\nmarine and land-based equipment. (Ex. A-87 at 36425-26) Most of Mr. West's open cell\nprojects were land-based and involved crane pad installation. None used geogrid, had an\nengineer review constructability, or had engineer drawings. However, he had never used\na 280-ton crane. (Tr. 3/7-8, 82) In about August 2009, PCI and West entered into a\ncost-plus-fixed-fee subcontract (see ex. G-18 at 12; tr. 3/43 , 75-76). On 20 July 2009\nCCI submitted a recovery schedule, said to be required by changed conditions due to the\ndredge ponds and spoils. It proposed to use barge-mounted cranes to complete the open\ncell structure from the river. (Ex. A-87 at 36418-24)\n\n        105. On 22 July 2009 CCI submitted to the Corps Mr. Hartley' s 16 July 2009\nreport of conditions during his 25 April-15 May 2009 visit. He had not completed his\nevaluation and had asked CCI for more geotechnical work. (Ex. A-91; tr. 4/60) The\nreport stated that dredging had raised water levels. Cell dikes appeared to consist of silty\nclay soils. He saw water impoundment in three dredge spoil containment cells that\ncaused seepage into the underlying soil, including into the near shore mudflats, that would\nincrease water content and decrease shear strength in the near shore area where fill\nplacemynt had resulted in instability. Mr. Hartley opined that dredging also affected\nsettlement and stability of the construction fill on the mudflats:\n\n\n\n                                            29\n\f              The dredging operation is less than 30m from the north end\n              of the project site. Attempts to obtain shear strength on the\n              surface soils were unsuccessful (undrained shear strength of\n              0.0). A hand-dug hole of0.5 min depth was excavated to\n              attempt additional vane shear strength testing. Soils are so\n              soft in this area that a laborer became stuck up to his knees\n              when attempting to dig into the mudflats. Once the hole was\n              dug undrained shear strength measurements were obtained\n              from vane shear testing and resulted in [low] shear\n              strengths ... less than a third of the value[ in the AR]. A 3 m\n              rebar was also pushed into the ground at this location with\n              little resistance. [Emphasis added]\n\n(Ex. A-91 at 36367) He said that unconsolidated silts and clays with very low shear\nstrength were distributed into the water and deposited in the construction area and that\nslope instability had occurred in the immediate vicinity of the dredge operations. He also\nreported PND's contemporaneous field shear strength assessment, which used data from\nthe AR and Basra reports and his April2009 shallow vane shear tests . PND concluded\nthat the AR indicated an FOS of3.25 at 1m fill depth, but PND found 0.94; at 3m, the\ncomparison was 1.97 to 0.54; and at 5m, it was 1.68 to 0.41. Mr. Hartley stated that the\ncontractor could place a very thin fill lift of about 0.5m but there was a small mud wave\nin front of fill operations and some tension cracks as fill thickness increased, confirmation\nthat near-surface shear strengths were limited. (!d. at 36364, 36369)\n\n       106. On 23 July 2009 the COR approved CCI's recovery plan, noting that the\ngovernment did not consider it to involve acceleration or differing or changed site\nconditions (ex. A-93 at 36392-93; see R4, tab 376).\n\n       107. Navy LT David Daigle (Lieutenant Commander by the hearing) became\ninvolved in the project about the end of July 2009 . On 9 September 2009 he succeeded\nMr. Bright as COR. (R4, tab 61 ; tr. 101131 , 133, 135, 137)\n\n        108. On 25 July 2009 PCI terminated Gunder boom for alleged default. Resulting\nlitigation was settled. (See R4, tabs 379, 383 ; tr. 3/81, 5/211 , 9/76-78, 88)\n\n      109. On 1 August 2009 Gunderboom' s Mr. Dreyer asserted, inter alia, that project\nproblems were due to PCI's failure to understand the soils issues:\n\n                     Some four months into a six-month project the\n              construction of the first Open Cell™ still has not begun due to\n              PCI's inability to solve geotechnical problems, which were\n              apparent to observers on day one. For example, ever since\n\n\n                                             30\n\f              viewing the site photographs when we met to discuss this\n              project in PND 's offices in Seattle, Kevin and I have been\n              concerned about the inter-tidal and offshore sediments. I am\n              sure you will recall our extensive discussions about how\n              unusual it was to see only the very top gun assembly from a\n              Russian Navy Missile launcher vessel sticking out of the muck\n              in the middle ofthejob site, meaning that there is an entire\n              vessel in that soup .... [Emphasis added]\n\n                     ... [O]n site we observed a hopper dredge operation,\n              which may have been depositing fine silt at the project site for\n              many years. This may have contributed to the geotechnical\n              problems PCI has encountered. We are not privy to what\n              precise geotechnical investigations may have been done prior\n              to contracting to design and construct this project. ...\n\n(R4, tab 383 at 161466)\n\n       110. In August 2009 the National Center for Construction Labs. & Researches,\nBasrah Construction Laboratory, apparently the \"National Lab\" CCI hired in July 2009,\nreported upon its investigation. The log of a boring taken at a location from which the\n280-foot crane was visible shows 2m of fill on top and two layers of clay beneath the fill ,\nwith the first 9m described as \"Very soft to soft gray lean to fat CLAY\" and the second\n2.5 mas \"Hard brown lean CLAY.\" (R4, tab 382 at 16352; tr. 61133-36, 138)\n\n         111. CCI submitted an REA in August 2009 for $20,905 ,039.53 and an extension\nbased upon changed or Type II differing site conditions and acceleration. It stated that\nPCI was familiar with the specific project region and that post-award information,\nincluding site re-inspection, had not altered PND' s original opinion that beach soil\nconditions were stable enough to construct the open cells and use heavy equipment,\nincluding a 280-ton crane. The REA alleged that there was no indication that soils within\nthe construction zone had extremely low shear strength; were subject to substantial silting\nfrom dredge spoils; and would make building a work road and crane pad commercially\nimpracticable, if not impossible. It stated that CCI knew that tidal action affected the\nwater table in the naval base's lower reaches, but alleged that, almost immediately, it had\nproblems due to unexpected concentrations of silt and weak clays. It tried compaction,\nlifts, and smaller, lighter equipment, but the pad continued to slough and crack. It stated\nthat some cells were to have been temporary enforcement of the crane pad embankment,\nbut they had to be permanent, due to the changed conditions relating to the dredge spoil\nsediment and dredge pond seepage. (R4, tab 17 at 1-5, 21)\n\n\n\n\n                                             31\n\f        112. Bilateral Mod. No. P00007, effective 28 August 2009, extended the contract\ncompletion date to 1 March 2010; the price remained $44,923,615.70. It stated that it was\nto facilitate authorizations and did not affect any REAs, claims or the construction\ncompletion date. (R4, tab 10)\n\n        113. In August to early October 2009, largely in Dubai, CCI and West engaged in\nequipment procurement efforts to implement the recovery plan (R4, tab 16 at 18, tab 48 at\n1, 66, 67, 73, 74, 80, 81).\n\n       114. On 14 September 2009 the COR issued a fifth letter of concern and GRS\nissued an interim unsatisfactory performance evaluation. CCI disputed it but admitted it\nwould not be able to meet its recovery schedule. (R4, tabs 68-71; ex.A-151 at 6114-15)\n\n        115. MAJ Gerald Himes held a master's degree in civil engineering but was not a\ngeotechnical engineer. In late July-August 2009, LT Daigle became COR and Mr. Bright\nthe alternate. By late August Lt. Daigle and MAJ Himes were doing the contract\nadministration. MAJ Himes visited the site in August 2009 and saw what he described as\nCCI's construction method of pushing fill and whatever was underneath it into the water\n(see also tr. 10/46-47 (COR Gutierrez's description of fill dumping and pushing, or\npulling sediment out into the shoreline)). When CCI submitted its REA, MAJ Himes\ncoordinated the government's technical support, including from ERDC, which gave him a\ndraft report on about 3 September 2009. (Ex. A-126 at 2727, ex. A-135 at 33499; tr.\n91131, 134-35, 137-38, 145-50, 162-63, 179, 200-01, 243-44, 11162-63, 167)\n\n         116. In September 2009 former COR Gutierrez commented to GRS upon the\nREA. He denied a contention by CCI that he had stated that a change order was\nappropriate and alleged several reasons why it was not. He also stated that \"[o]n\nnumerous site visits it was confirmed that there was quite a[ n] interesting phenomenon\noccurring at the 25m near shore line, this is undeniable\" and that \"the problem started and\nis tied to an unforeseen sight [sic] condition.\" (Ex. A-135 at 33494, 33496) He was\nadopting CCI's unforeseen site condition vocabulary but believed contemporaneously that\nits problems were tied to such a condition (tr. 10/122).\n\n        117. On 18 September 2009 ERDC issued its complete report (ERDC report) on\nthe question of whether the Corps-furnished documents for proposals were sufficient to\npredict the crane pad construction difficulties (R4, tab 108 at 1). Referring to the AR and\nBH logs, ERDC stated that \"[c]lays possessing a soft to very soft consistency pose a\nsignificant challenge to any design that requires them to carry any additional loads\" (id. at\n2). Addressing soil strength, ERDC concluded that the AR had not reported the results of\nunconsolidated undrained triaxial (UU) compression tests in the best manner, but it had\nnoted that laboratory vane shear equipment had been used to obtain the undrained shear\nstrength because of high disturbance in all samplers that extruded from Shelby tubes of\n\n\n                                             32\n\fthe soft clay layer. Also, the soil exuded between the fingers when squeezed, which\ncould be described as very soft to soft sandy clayey soil, and the laboratory vane range\nwas within the range for soils with soft to very soft consistency. ERDC interpreted the\nAR to mean that UU tests were to be discounted because of the high degree of\ndisturbance and that the laboratory hand vane tester gave the most reliable results. It\nadopted the vane test data as the basis for undrained shear strengths in its stability\nanalysis. The results ofERDC' s crane pad slope stability analyses, based only upon the\ngeotechnical information the Corps had made available to proposers, were that stability\ndecreased with increasing fill height; the crane pad would be stable for a fill height of 1m,\nmarginally stable for a fill height of 3m, and unstable for a fill height of Sm. ERDC\nstated that PND's 16 July 2009 slope stability analysis indicated that the crane pad would\nbe stable for fill heights up to at least 5m, but noted that the strength of the clay layer in\nPND' s analysis was determined from the UU laboratory tests taken from the highly\ndisturbed samples that the AR had warned against using. (!d. at 2-6) ERDC concluded,\ninter alia, that the \"very soft to soft\" consistency of the foundation clays described in the\nAR should have served notice that dock construction and long-term performance were\ncauses for concern; the high level of disturbance in the soil samples was a direct result of\nthe very soft to soft clay consistency and caused significant uncertainty in determining\nshear strength for slope stability analysis; it was certain that the clay consistency was very\nsoft to soft; and lack of information regarding which samples were tested in the lab vane\ntests or how many tests were performed increased uncertainty (id. at 6-7).\n\n       118. The CO denied CCI's REA on 30 September 2009, summarizing in part:\n\n              The conditions ... were both known and what would typically\n              be found in a sediment laden tidal estuary.... Soil borings\n              indicated that the surface and subsurface soils at the site\n              consisted of unconfined very soft sandy silty clayey mud.\n              Whether it arrived as additional dredged material or as\n              naturally occurring sedimentation; the fact that the soil was\n              saturated silty mud was known or should have been known to\n              an experienced marine contractor. The [AR]. .. put the\n              contractor on notice that the soils at the project site were\n              unstable and subject to soil movement under pressure ....\n\n(R4, tab 19 at 7) She noted that Mr. Hartley called the area a \"mudflat\" (id. at 8).\n\n       119. CCI and West had considerable difficulties procuring barges, cranes and\nsome equipment (R4, tab 16 at 14, tabs 48, 51 at 1, tabs 52, 55, 56, 58, 64, 65 at 2, tab 77;\nex. A-163 at 143973 ; tr. 1/93-95, 3/14-20, 63).\n\n\n\n\n                                             33\n\f       120. On 2 October 2009 Mr. West notified Mr. Burke and the COR of an alleged\nunanticipated need to install wick drains (R4, tab 80 at 1). Mr. West acknowledged that\nusing wick drains to consolidate fill was common, although he had not used them in\nAlaska. He had a \"gut feeling\" they would be necessary (tr. 3/53). During his direct\ntestimony Mr. Hartley, who was not involved in the original project design, stated that he\nhad recommended that wick drains be installed for soil strengthening based upon his\nreview of the AR and the unstable site conditions (tr. 4/65 , 67-68).\n\n       121. Mr. Hartley returned to the site in October 2009 with more sophisticated\nvane shear equipment that would yield more accurate values . He left at the end of\nOctober. His investigation pertained to the crane pad and open cell design. (Tr. 4/60-64,\n69) As of 8 October 2009 CCI was again rebuilding the crane pad. On 11 and\n12 October 2009 Mr. Hartley performed field shear strength tests at low tide. (App. supp.\nR4, tab S-8 at 10/8/09 QCR at 2, 10/11 , 10/12/09 QCRs at 1)\n\n       122. Barges, tugs and cranes arrived on about 18 October, and 1 and 13 November\n2009 (see R4, tab 420 at 29370, 29371; app. supp. R4, tab S-8 at 10/18/09 QCR, tab S-9\nat 1111, 11113, and 11115/09 QCRs).\n\n       123 . On 3 November 2009 GRS' on site Iraqi engineer reported to the COR that\nthere had been a \"big subsidence shear failure (earth collapse)\" between the north and\nsouth cells (ex. A-189 at 5899; tr. 10/156). The 3 November 2009 QCR reported that the\n\"crack and settlement on the beach a day earlier turned into a significant slide of the\nbeach\" (app. supp. R4, tab S-9 at 1113/09 QCR at 1).\n\n        124. On 5 November 2009 Mr. Smithson asserted changed conditions to the CO\nbased upon \"a catastrophic failure of the beach fill\" (R4, tab 93 at 1). He disputed prior\nCorps contentions that fill rate, compaction, and moisture content had contributed to\nfailures and alleged that the ERDC report had stated, based upon the AR, that a stable 3m\nfill could be placed, but CCI's failed fill never reached 3m. He stated that the\n2 November 2009 failure occurred when the fill was at about 2m. (Tr. 5/147-48)\n\n        125. On 18 November 2009 CCI asked the CO for financial relief and for about\n$3M for steel and cargo costs to build north and south open cells on the basis that\ndiffering/changed conditions made it impossible to proceed with its original seawall\ndesign. She responded that her REA determination was unchanged. Although noting that\nCCI was over 57 days past the construction completion date, she agreed to a 2-week\nbilling cycle and partial release and reduction of retainage. (R4, tabs 89, 90)\n\n        126. CCI hired John Snelgrove on 2 November 2009 to lead its project efforts\nwhen Mr. Smithson was unavailable. Messrs. Smithson, Snelgrove and PND were\ncritical ofPCI. (R4, tabs 416-17, 419 ; tr. 11134-35 ; see also R4, tab 420 at 29369) (\"PCI\n\n\n                                             34\n\fhas no clue about any of it as history has shown\" .... \"I agree with that, they obviously are\nnot dirt movers, or contractors as far as that goes\"). However, Mr. West thought PCI\n\"had a good grip on the mechanics of running a construction job\" (tr. 3/79).\n\n        127. Mr. Burke was asked to leave CCI because the project caused parent BBNC\nsignificant financial strain; he left in December 2009. That month CCI also terminated\nPCI's contract and assumed West's contract. (Tr. 1/50, 104,3/77-78, 51194-95)\n\n      128. It seems undisputed that CCI completed the project by an extended June\n2010 due date. In April 2011 it was nominated by the Associated General Contractors of\nAmerica for International Construction Project of the Year and won (tr. 3/38).\n\n         129. CCI submitted a certified CDA claim dated 8 February 2010 to the CO for\n$35,125,036 and a contract extension to 30 June 20 l 0 and asked that its interim\nperformance rating be changed from unsatisfactory to satisfactory. The CO received the\nclaim on 26 February 2010. (R4, tabs 2, 16) CCI incorporated its REA and added a Type\nI differing site conditions contention, to which it narrowed its claim at the hearing (R4,\ntab 16 at 1 n.1, 27-34; tr. 6/31). CCI claimed that it never received notice that the soils\nunder the crane pad could not support the heavy equipment indispensable to driving sheet\npile. Rather, the AR had indicated that the top 2m of soil was consistent with medium to\nstiff soils. Also, CCI had had limited site access prior to its proposal and no chance, or\nneed, based upon the Corps' representations, to conduct a detailed pre-proposal technical\nanalysis. CCI contended that its post-award geotechnical analyses were not to confirm\nthe AR's findings and whether the top 3m of soil were stable enough to support heavy\nequipment, but to confirm the depths to which sheet pile must be driven. CCI contended\nthat all claimed costs would have been avoided if the Corps had performed a timely,\nreasonable geotechnical investigation, rather than instructing potential contractors to rely\nupon an outdated, inaccurate AR. It asserted that, during design, PND had properly\nfocused upon the location of the sheet piles rather than the access road. CCI stated that\nconsiderable attention was mistakenly focused upon dredge ponds as responsible for\n\"causing weak soils to become even weaker\" (R4, tab 16 at 6), but it still alleged that\ndredging was \"the root cause\" of the problems (id. at 24 ). In support of its claim, CCI\nrelied upon Mr. Hartley' s 4 February 2010 expert report, below.\n\n        130. CCI's claim and incorporated REA did not allege that the government had\nacted in bad faith or to deprive CCI of its contract value, and did not include operative\nfacts that were in any respect tantamount to a bad faith claim. It also did not allege\ncontract breach, although CCI averred in its complaint that its claim had so alleged\n(compl. ~ 73).\n\n      131. A new CO was appointed in March-April2010. By final decision of9 July\n2010 she denied CCI' s claim. On 6 August 2010 it timely appealed to the Board. CCI\n\n\n                                             35\n\fultimately increased its claim to $40,064,759. (R4, tab 2; ex. A-232 at 1, ex. A-233 at 1,\nex. A-259 at 16, ex. A-260 at 208, ex. G-18 at 3; tr. 5/ 157, 6/254)\n\n                      Appellant' s Expert Hartley' s Direct Evidence\n\n        132. Mr. Hartley has a master' s degree in geotechnical engineering and is a\nlicensed civil engineer. He was admitted without objection as an expert in civil and\ngeotechnical engineering. He is very familiar with open cell projects and, prior to the one\nat issue, had done geotechnical assessments for them. (Tr. 4/9, 13, 15-16) He prepared\nan expert report dated 4 February 2010 in response to the Corps' rejection ofCCI's REA\n(ex. A-214 at 1). It reflects counsels' input and contains legal conclusions that we do not\naccept as expert evidence, as is true of any legal conclusions by other experts in this\nappeal. Mr. Hartley' s report acknowledged that \" [w]e have not discussed with the\nContractor the interpretation procedures they used in the evaluation of construction means\nand methods for the project\" (id. at 3). No reason is given for this omission. His report\nmerely assumed, without attribution, that CCI relied upon the AR' s subsurface\ninformation in submitting its proposal.\n\n       133. Among other things, Mr. Hartley opined that the AR contained conflicting\ninformation on soil strength and inaccurate data reporting, including discrepancies\nbetween soil consistency descriptions and blow counts. He stated that the reported data,\ninterpreted logically, would lead a contractor to believe that a shore-based fill operation\ncould be achieved with some containment from armor, cells, geotextile wraps, super sacks\nand other means. (Ex. A-214 at 3)\n\n        134. Mr. Hartley cited Corps guidelines for geotechnical reports and interpretation\nof field biow count data obtained in an SPT for the proposition that adjustments should be\nmade to raw field blow counts to provide a normalized data set prior to determining soil\nconsistency and properties. After applying such \"corrections\" to the AR blow counts,\nPND determined that the silty clay encountered from the surface to a depth of 6.5m in BH\nNo. 2 was a medium silty clay rather than a very soft to soft silty clay and the silty clay\nfrom the surface to a depth of3.5m in BH No.3 was a stiff silty clay rather than a very\nsoft to soft silty clay. The Basra report' s BH No.2 indicated that clayey silt ranged from\nvery soft to stiff. Mr. Hartley reported that PND's October 2009 field vane sheer testing\nyielded strength measurements that were, on average, half the value of the AR' s\nlaboratory vane shear strength tests. However, soil conditions, based upon split spoon\nblow counts, appeared to result in shear strengths 2 to 6 times higher than the AR' s\nlaboratory vane shear strengths and indicated that the shear strength was much higher\nthan values in the ERDC report. Mr. Hartley denied that his description of the project\narea as a \"mudflat\" implied that it was obviously unstable and stated that PND had\nconstructed many fill and armor rock projects on riverine and marine mudflats using\nshore-side construction techniques similar to those used by CCI. (Ex. A-214 at 5, 10, 13)\n\n\n                                            36\n\f        135. Mr. Hartley stated that unconsolidated silts and clays from dredging were\ndeposited along the project, yielding very low shear strengths in the upper silt/clay\nformation. While the USAID report indicated that some dredge side casting had occurred\nnear the Old Port, it had not given enough information to analyze quantities, locations, or\nsite and construction impact. He concluded that it was hard to ascertain actual geological\nsite conditions from the AR due to its conflicting statements, data reported, and lack of\ndata that a prudent geological engineer would normally include. (Ex. A-214 at 13-16)\n\n       136. At the hearing Mr. Hartley opined that PND's recommendations for crane\npad stabilization should have worked based upon the AR. Regardless of whether one\nused the AR's laboratory vane shears or the blow count calculated vane shears, they were\nsubstantially higher than field conditions. Shear strength was much lower than anything\ndescribed in the AR. PCI did not follow all ofPND's recommendations but, according to\nMr. Hartley, even if it had, the crane pad would not have stabilized. (Tr. 4/40-41, 105)\n\n        137. Mr. Hartley first testified that, based upon the AR, wick drains might or\nmight not have been called for in the original project design; either way was appropriate\n(tr. 4/68-69). He later testified that they were due to the differing site conditions and the\nneed to change to marine-side construction (tr. 41119-21).\n\n        138. In Mr. Hartley's opinion, field testing data typically provides a more accurate\npicture of soil conditions than lab testing data, because when a sample is transported there\nis a potential for disturbance and there is such a potential with very soft or soft soils when\nShelby tubes used in laboratory vane shear testing are cut into sections. He noted:\n\n              [E]ven in the [AR] they indicated that they had problems\n              taking the sample, extruding the sample out of the Shelby\n              tube. And that 's because they were having issues with soft\n              material. [Emphasis added]\n\n(Tr. 4/73)\n\n        139. When asked if descriptors were superior to or subordinate to blow counts in\ninterpreting BH data, Mr. Hartley responded: \"It's really another piece of information\nthat's provided\" (tr. 4/88). He added that there was a fairly large discrepancy in the AR\ndata between the blow counts in the upper 7m of soil and the descriptors and, in that case,\nconsidering sample transportation and laboratory work, the blow counts would better\ndescribe soil consistency at the site (tr. 4/88-89).\n\n      140. Apparently using AR blow counts adjusted as he earlier described,\nMr. Hartley concluded that the soil should have been stable enough to support a crane pad\n\n\n                                              37\n\fand land-based construction. He opined that, based upon the ERDC report, and his own\nanalysis, an umeinforced crane pad should have been stable at up to 3m of fill height.\n(Ex. A-214 at last pg.; tr. 4/89-93, 96-98, 100, 105, 108)\n\n                   Appellant's Expert Enamul Hoque's Direct Evidence\n\n       141. Enamul Hoque, president of Hoque & Associates, Inc. of Phoenix, Arizona,\nhas a master's degree in civil engineering. He is a licensed civil engineer with extensive\nexperience in geotechnical engineering, having completed thousands of geotechnical\ninvestigations, including of slope failures. He was admitted without objection as a civil\nengineering and geotechnical expert. (Ex. A-236; tr. 5/6-1 0) He supplied an expert\nreport dated 3 September 2010 (ex. A-225).\n\n       142. Mr. Hoque did not read the entire RFP or the contract. He focused upon the\nAR and USAID reports and the answers to questions 11 and 42. He was not present\nduring the crane pad failures but relied upon what CCI told him concerning pad\ncomposition, fill height and crane placement. Mr. Hoque arrived on site on 22 February\n2010 and was there for several weeks. Most of his testing was outside the project so that\nit covered undisturbed areas. He opined that he could about replicate conditions at the\ntime of failure because, based upon his observations and testing, there was a monotonous\ngeology that did not change much--an upper soft soil and competent soil below. He\nperformed dilatancy testing by holding soil in his hands in the field. It was falling\nthrough his fingers, meaning it was very soft and not as depicted in the AR blow counts in\nhis opinion. (Ex. A-225 at 1; tr. 5/11-13,18,20,30-31,34-35, 60-61 , 76,83, 87-90)\n\n        143. Mr. Hoque stated that the moisture content at which a soil starts behaving as\na liquid is the \"liquid limit\" (LL). If that content is at or above LL, the soil will behave\nlike a viscous fluid. Regarding BH No.2, the AR' s \"Summary of Test Results,\" at\nsample Nos. 1 and 3, reported the LL at 48% and 51%. Mr. Hoque found the moisture\ncontent in the field to be about 4 7% up to 70%, essentially liquid. He concluded that, if\nthe AR' s reported moisture content on those two samples were correct, then they had lost\nmoisture during sampling, transportation and handling. He opined that the reported LLs\nand blow counts indicated that the soil should have supported minor construction and\nmost of the equipment. He opined that the cohesion values under the \"Summary of Test\nResults\" for sample Nos. 2 and 4 indicated that the soil would support equipment under\nvirtually all conditions, but cohesion tests in Phoenix yielded much smaller numbers. To\nhim, the AR was, at best, confusing and did not represent actual soil conditions; strength\nvalues were totally different. (AR at next to last pg.; ex. A-225 at 2-3; tr. 5/37-42, 62, 76)\n\n      144. Mr. Hoque opined that the AR excluded vital silt data and that the silt was\n\"abundantly available\" at and/or below the surface throughout the site (ex. A-225 at 4).\n\n\n\n                                              38\n\f       145. In Mr. Hoque's opinion, geotechnical engineers would not make\nrecommendations concerning geotechnical design parameters associated with crane pad\nconstruction and placement of a 280-ton crane on top of it, for a site with competent, stiff\nto hard soil. They would do so when there was soft saturated soil, even if there were a\nmuch smaller crane. Placement of a 6m high fill 1OOm into the shore would require a stiff\nto very stiff soil. (Tr. 5/81-83, 85)\n\n        146. Mr. Hoque would rely upon blow counts as the most reliable representation\nof site conditions and would rely more upon field testing than laboratory testing. In his\nopinion, based upon the AR' s blow counts, there should not have been a failure where the\ncrane pad was attempted. (Tr. 5/24-26)\n\n        147. Part of Mr. Hoque' s work was field observation of surficial geologic site\nconditions using indicator tests described in the ASTM \"Field Identification and\nClassification of Soils.\" Visual soils classification is a recognized and standardized\ntechnique. He acknowledged that his visual classification of the soils as elastic silt\ndiffered from his laboratory's classification of it as clay. Despite his testimony that he\nwould rely more upon field testing, on cross-examination he stated that he deemed visual\nclassification to be an indicator and laboratory classification to be more precise. In his\nopinion, while blow counts were the most reliable factor, visual and laboratory\nclassifications should also be considered and visual classification should not be\ndiscounted. One should look at everything. (Ex. A-225 at 1; tr. 5/48-54, 100-01)\n\n                  Appellant's Expert Tracy J. Lyman' s Direct Evidence\n\n       148. Tracy J. Lyman, senior consultant at Brierley Associates in Denver,\nColorado, submitted an expert report dated 3 January 2011 (ex. A-234; tr. 6/21). He held\na master' s of engineering degree, focusing upon rock and soil engineering, and had been\na geotechnical engineer for 39 years. He held licenses as a professional engineer and\ngeologist. (Tr. 6/5-7) Although the presiding judge sustained the government' s objection\nto CCI's request to admit Mr. Lyman as an expert in design-build contracts and the\nevaluation of bid documents from a reasonable contractor' s perspective, he was admitted\nwithout objection as an expert in geotechnical and soil engineering (tr. 6/12-14).\n\n        149. Mr. Lyman reported that the actual shear strength of the soil was about half\nof that expected based upon the AR and Basra reports. He stated that there might have\nbeen some variability across the Pier 1 area, with weaker soils at the crane access road\nlocation than at the site of the Basra report' s boring 2. He described the ERDC report as\nconcluding, using the AR's most conservative assumptions, that a 3m thick crane access\nroadway fill would be stable, but CCI's experience was starkly different and there was\nsignificantly lower strength in the subsurface soils at the roadway than what was\nanticipated based upon the AR and Basra reports. (Ex. A-234 at 8-1 0; tr. 6/53-56)\n\n\n                                            39\n\f        150. The Lyman report concluded that the dredging activities in close project\nproximity \"most likely produced a thin veneer of highly saturated, unconsolidated, very\nweak soils at and seaward of the intertidal zone ' ground surface\"' and that those soils\nmight have exacerbated crane access road instability (ex. A-234 at 8-9). The dredge\nspoils \"exhibited ' zero' undrained shear strength\" ( id. at 10).\n\n        151. Mr. Lyman concentrated on AR BH Nos. 2 and 3, in the intertidal zone,\nbecause No. 1, up on the land, was not relevant. No.2 was at the location ofthe\ntemporary causeway to be constructed for the crane. In evaluating the BH data he looked\nprimarily at SPT results, the \"N\" values. Blow counts are indicative of clay consistency,\nfor which there is a rigorous industry description system. Blows from an SPT test of 0 up\nto 2 indicate very soft clay; 2 to 4, soft; 4 to 8, medium; 8 to 15, stiff; 15 to 30, very stiff\nand greater than 30, hard. He opined that the AR' s BH log descriptors, which were based\nupon visual classification, did not comport with the rigorous industry system and\ndescribed softer material than the blow counts indicated. He did not agree with the AR' s\ncharacterization of the clay as very soft. (AR, app ' x A, B; tr. 6/33-37, 39, 45 , 70, 76)\n\n       152. Mr. Lyman found nothing in the Basra report to indicate that a contractor\nshould change from land-based construction. He concluded that a blow count of 2 from\nBasra BH No.2, at a depth of9.5m \"was anomalously low\" when compared to blow\ncounts from AR BH Nos. 2 and 3. (Ex. A-234 at 7; tr. 6/45-46, 86, 141-43)\n\n        153. Mr. Lyman considered an acceptable FOS for crane pad stability, once a\nhuman-operated crane were placed upon it and it was operating under a load, to range\nfrom 1.1 to 1.3. The ERDC report' s FOS for a 3m high crane pad was 1.07. Rounding\nthat to 1.1, he opined that a contractor could consider placing a human-operated 280-ton\ncrane onto a crane pad along a shoreline under the conditions the ERDC report described\nbut should not go to any lower safety level. Also, he would look for ways to increase\nstability. (R4, tab 108 at 5, table 3; tr. 6/ 116-18, 120)\n\n        154. Mr. Lyman never visited the project site nor spoke to anyone who was on site\nwhen construction was initiated. He did not see any 2008 project design calculations on\nbehalf of CCI. He did not find any design document related directly to the crane pad, but\nopined that, because it was temporary, a design was not required and would be unusual.\n(Tr. 6/68, 78-79, 81 , 91, 104, 144, 147)\n\n       155. Mr. Lyman was not expert in dredging or sediment transportation but read\nthe USAID report to indicate that, on the project side of the river, erosion would occur\nand, on the other side, sediment deposition would occur (tr. 6/68, 146).\n\n\n\n\n                                              40\n\f       156. Mr. Lyman confirmed that in its January 2009 report, pre-construction, PND\ndescribed the clays' design soil properties as very soft and that CCI did, in fact, encounter\nvery soft clays. He acknowledged that a reasonable contractor should consider all\ninformation in the AR. (Tr. 6/43,71, 80-81)\n\n                Government's Expert Dr. James Apted' s Direct Evidence\n\n        157. Dr. James Apted, employed by WS Atkins International Ltd. and based in\nEngland, is a civil engineer who has specialized in geotechnical engineering for about 3 5\nyears. He obtained a masters ' degree in foundation engineering and a doctorate at the\nImperial College of the University of London, concerning the effects of weathering on the\nproperties of London clay. He is highly experienced in geotechnology and was admitted\nwithout objection as an expert in the area of geotechnical engineering. Following a site\nvisit on 23-25 November 2011 , Dr. Apted submitted his first expert report, dated\nDecember 2011. (Ex. G-16 at 1, 5, 19; tr. 13116-46, 53)\n\n        158. During his visit Dr. Apted saw \"a slightly sandy clayey beach,\" a strip of\n\"more lumpy clay\" and the main foreshore, which had a \"surface of slippery silty clay (or\nmud) with a high degree of sheen\" (ex. G-16 at 19). He considered that the foreshore ' s\ngenerally smooth and sheeny nature was as it would have been in 2008 and typical of\nCCI' s work area. He walked across the slippery clay foreshore but progress was not\npossible within about 1Om because he was getting bogged down into the soft surface. He\nused rebar to probe the upper 2-3m of the foreshore in 3 to 4 places around exposed areas\nsouth and north of the area built by CCI. He was able to push the probe fully into the\nsurface with ease in most places. The river was brown and appeared to be laden with\nsediment. Very soft clay, possibly silty material, was readily apparent. (!d. at 19-21 , 39;\ntr. 13/57-58, 65) It was \"very easy\" for him to determine that the undrained strength of\nthe clay below the foreshore was very low (ex. G-16 at 21). Dr. Apted considered that the\nconditions he observed were not unexpected or atypical for the bottom end of a long river,\ntidal inlet area, or large flat delta, where there was an accumulation of soft sediments and\ngeologically recent materials, as at Umm Qasr (tr. 13/66-67; see ex. G-16 at 24, ~ 6.2.12).\n\n       159. Dr. Apted concluded, among other things that:\n\n              6.2 .3 It appears clear that the soils in the upper 7 to 10 [m] or\n                     so below the foreshore in the area of the new seawall\n                     consist of very soft to soft clay ....\n\n\n\n              6.2.5 From [the AR and Basra] investigations it is considered\n                    that the undrained strength of the upper layer of clay\n\n\n                                              41\n\f                    beneath the site would lie in the range of 10 kPa to 20\n                    kPa, with the possibility of undrained strength values\n                    lower than this. The relatively high SPT N values\n                    reported by the [AR] are clearly an anomalous set of\n                    data indicating a higher undrained strength, but they are\n                    not supported by the descriptions on the [BH] logs, or\n                    the reported vane strengths in the [AR] , or the ... SPT N\n                    values for the University of Basra investigation. In\n                    addition Andrea Laboratories do not seem to rely on\n                    them.\n\n              6.2.6 [PND ' s] vane tests ...gave values of undrained strength\n                    that are below the range of values indicated by Andrea\n                    and University of Basra .. .. [T]he results are not out of\n                    general character with the Andrea and Basra results,\n                    and all the results are commensurate with the\n                    descriptions used in the two reports for the upper\n                    stratum being a very soft clay.\n\n(Ex. G-16 at 23)\n\n        160. Dr. Apted concluded, inter alia, that one reasonably could have foreseen\nfrom the AR that the stratum underlying the site along the foreshore was likely to be very\nsoft or soft clay; it should have been clear that the AR was limited in extent and quality\nand there was a risk of more difficult conditions; and the USAID report conveyed the\nsignificant risk of accumulation of silt and clay from dredging (ex. G-16 at 23-24).\nDr. Apted's overall strong impression from the AR was that one should expect \"pretty\nweak\", very soft, soft-to-medium clay (tr. 131141 ).\n\n\n        161. Dr. Apted opined that Mr. Hartley' s 16 July 2009 stability analysis, while\napplying a low undrained strength to the very near surface soils (upper 3m) in the area of\nthe earthworks, had incorrectly used drained parameters for the remainder of the soft clay\nlayer, which could seriously over estimate the strength of that layer and distort the\nstability analysis (ex. G-16 at 15, 25).\n\n       162. Dr. Apted opined that, regardless that the crane pad was temporary, it had to\nbe designed appropriately; it was key. He opined that the earthworks ' failure was\nconsistent with the ground conditions that could have been expected and with the\noverloading of a layer ofvery soft clay (ex. G-16 at 26; tr. 131176-77). He concluded:\n\n\n\n\n                                             42\n\f              6.2.2 While the actual undrained strength that could have\n                    been identified from the [AR] may not have been as\n                    low as allegedly found by the vane probing carried out\n                    on behalf of CCI, it was sufficiently low to highlight\n                    the risks of instability of constructing earthworks on\n                    the foreshore.\n\n\n\n\n              6.2.5 I consider that the instability that did occur may have\n                    occurred in any case because of the presence of very\n                    soft clay, even if the undrained strength was in the\n                    range of 10 to 20 kPa.\n\n(Ex. G-16 at 28)\n\n                             Mr. Hartley's Rebuttal Evidence\n\n        163. In rebuttal to Dr. Apted, Mr. Hartley prepared a \"Slope Stability Analysis\nSummary\" evaluating FOS'. An FOS of 1 or more represents stability; less than 1,\ninstability. (Ex. A-249 at n.1, at 2, conclusion 3; tr. 4/26-27, 108, 123, 126-28) Based\nupon failure at 25m from the shoreline at no more than 2.5m of fill thickness,\nMr. Hartley's data showed \"conditions were much, much worse than what the [AR] was\nshowing, even at the very most conservative value in the [AR]\" (tr. 41128-29).\n\n                              Mr. Hoque's Rebuttal Evidence\n\n       164. Among other things, in his 27 January 2012 rebuttal report, Mr. Hoque\nasserted that there was no indication that Dr. Apted tried to evaluate the soil's index\nproperties visually and classify it using standardized ASTM procedures (ex. A-241 at 2).\n\n         165. Mr. Hoque stated that the AR did not mention anything about the soft soil's\neffect on foundation performance or construction. He faulted it for not addressing\nbackfill in a marine environment and its complexity, on-site geology, site characteristics\nor past usage that could affect design and construction. He stated that there was no\nreference to saturated very soft and viscous soils at the site in the documents he reviewed\nbut such soil was \"abundantly available at the surface and/or below the surface\nthroughout the site\" (ex. A-241 at 7). He concluded that near surface soils and their\nconditions at the site were materially different than reported in the AR and Apted report\nand that his own findings directly conflicted with the AR, especially in the identification\nof silt and its strength values. (!d. at 2, 5-7)\n\n\n\n                                            43\n\f                  Dr. Apted's Expert Rebuttal and Supplementary Reports\n\n        166. Dr. Apted prepared an expert report dated February 2012, in rebuttal to\nMr. Lyman's 3 January 2011 report, Mr. Hoque' s 3 September 2010 report, and\nMr. Hartley' s expert evaluations (ex. G-19). Dr. Apted concluded, among other things,\nthat there was enough information in the AR and USAID report:\n\n               2.2.9 ... [T]o highlight a significant risk of very soft ground\n                     occurring below the foreshore, to the extent that\n                     unconstrained construction of earthworks over the\n                     foreshore would have been at risk of failure and\n                     disruption.\n\n(Ex. G-19 at 6) He opined that, using a range of FOS that could reasonably be expected\nwhen placing fill over the foreshore, the results clearly demonstrated that earthworks\nfailure could be expected well short of the seawall construction area (id. at 14).\n\n        167. Dr. Apted prepared a supplemental report dated April 2012, after reviewing\nCCI depositions and exhibits and concluding that the fill used, except in the open cells,\nwas general and not selected for its suitability to be placed in or near water (ex. G-23 at 1,\n4-5, 10). Upon review of project information, including manner of fill placement, tide\nlevel, and some heavy rainfall, he concluded that, based upon his experience, it was more\nlikely than not that a water table was established within the fill somewhere between the\nmid and high tide levels. His prior analyses had assumed, conservatively, that the fill was\nentirely dry. He concluded that, while not large, a water table within the fill would reduce\nthe FOS by 5 to 10% and the likelihood of slope failure in light of CCI' s method of\noperation was even more readily apparent than in his prior analysis. (Id . at 5-7, 9-1 0)\n\n                                       DISCUSSION\n\n        I. The Board Lacks Jurisdiction to Entertain Appellant' s Bad Faith Contentions\n\n       CCI contends in briefing that the government acted in bad faith in denying its REA\nand in other respects and seeks its attorney fees and costs in pursuing its claim and appeal,\nin an unspecified amount. 4 Although the government asserted that this was the first time\n\n4\n    CCI cites St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. United States, 4 Cl. Ct. 762 (1984), for the\n       proposition that it can recover attorney fees and costs due to the government's\n       alleged bath faith actions. However, in that case, which involved an award of\n       attorney fees and costs to the government due to the plaintiffs prosecution of its\n       action in bad faith, the court confirmed that monetary awards can be imposed on\n       the United States only when there has been an express waiver of sovereign\n\n                                              44\n\fCCI had so contended, it responded to its allegations on the merits and did not move to\ndismiss them for lack of jurisdiction. However, it is incumbent upon the Board to assure\nthat we have jurisdiction, even if the parties have not raised the issue. See Bender v.\nWilliamsport Area School District, 475 U.S. 534, 541 , 546-47 (1986). Accordingly, we\ngave the parties the opportunity to brief the jurisdictional question. The government\nasserts that CCI never submitted a claim to the CO that it acted in bad faith. CCI\ncounters, inter alia, that it challenged the propriety of the government's conduct in its\nREA and claim and that its bad faith allegations are based upon the same operative facts\nthat it has advanced since the inception of the case.\n\n       A contractor' s submission of a proper CDA claim in writing to the CO for decision\nis one of the prerequisites to the Board's CDAjurisdiction. 41 U.S.C. § 7103; Madison\nLawrence, Inc. , ASBCA No. 56551,09-2 BCA ,-r 34,235 at 169,206. The Board does not\nhave jurisdiction to consider a new claim raised for the first time in a party's pleadings.\nAmerican General Trading & Contracting, WLL, ASBCA No. 56758, 12-1 BCA ,-r 34,905\nat 171,639. As we recently summarized:\n\n             Whether a claim before the Board is new or essentially the\n             same as that presented to the CO depends upon whether the\n             claims derive from common or related operative facts. The\n             assertion of a new legal theory of recovery, when based upon\n             the same operative facts as the original claim, does not\n             constitute a new claim.

The court of appeals recently discussed governmental breach of the duty of\ngood faith and fair dealing in terms of acts or omissions that, while not expressly\nproscribed by the contract, are inconsistent with the contract's purpose and deprive the\nother party of the contemplated value. Metcalf Construction Co. v. United States, 2014\nU.S. App. LEXIS 2515 at* 14 (Fed. Cir. 2014). CCI's claim, including the incorporated\nREA, did not allege that the government had acted in bad faith in any respect, or had\nacted with specific intent to injure CCI or to deprive CCI of its contract value, and it did\nnot include operative facts that were in any respect tantamount to a bad faith claim\n(finding 130).\n\n       In sum, we lack jurisdiction to entertain CCI's bad faith allegations because it did\nnot submit such a claim to the CO for decision. 5\n\n                        II. Appellant's Motions to Exclude or Strike\n\n        CCI moved pre-hearing to exclude Dr. Apted' s expert report and related testimony\nto the extent they contained legal conclusions and addressed American construction\nprojects, Corps-administered projects, United States' construction contract requirements,\nor the FAR (app. mot. at 7). The Board reserved its ruling for the hearing, where CCI\nstated that Dr. Apted should not be allowed to testify about other than his technical\ninterpretation of the AR. The government opposed the motion, citing Dr. Apted' s broad\nexperience and expertise in geotechnical engineering, and stated that he would not offer\nlegal conclusions. (Tr. 13/6-8) The presiding judge denied CCI's motion, noting that its\nown expert reports could be interpreted to advance legal conclusions. The judge stated\nthat she would evaluate all of the reports for their geotechnical information and would not\nrely upon them for any legal conclusions. (Tr. 13/9)\n\n       During Dr. Apted ' s testimony, CCI objected that some of the government' s\nquestions concerning fill placement were beyond the scope of his expert qualifications\nand reports. The government disagreed. The judge allowed the examination over CCI ' s\nobjection, but instructed that the focus be upon soil conditions rather than construction\n\n5\n    CCI addressed its interim performance rating only briefly at the hearing. It alleged in\n       briefing that the government gave it \"an improperly issued and facially\n       unsupported interim performance evaluation\" (app. br. at 57) but did not mention\n       its request for a rating change or brief the jurisdictional and other issues involved.\n       Accordingly, we deem the claim' s rating change request to have been abandoned.\n\n                                              46\n\fmethods and stated that CCI could reserve its objection in post-hearing briefing if it so\nchose. (Tr. 13/223-27) In a footnote in its reply brief, in essence a motion to strike, CCI\nrenewed its objection to Dr. Apted's testimony concerning its means and methods of\nconstruction on the grounds that it was outside his area of expertise, patently prejudicial,\nand raised to cloud the issues before the Board (reply br. at 41 n.3 ).\n\n       Regarding each expert's report and testimony, the Board has considered only\nevidence that is within the expert's accepted area of expertise, and not matters that are\nirrelevant to the differing site conditions claim at hand or in effect legal conclusions,\nwhich are not within an expert's province. Lear Siegler Services, Inc., ASBCA No.\n57264, 12-2 BCA ,-r 35,112 at 172,425.\n\n       Accordingly, CCI's motions to exclude and strike are denied except as reflected in\nthe foregoing ruling.\n\n            III. Appellant Has Not Proved A Type I Differing Site Condition\n\n       Appellant must prove the following to establish a Type I differing site condition:\n\n              ( 1) the contract contained positive indications of the\n              conditions at the site; (2) it reasonably interpreted and relied\n              upon the indicated site conditions; (3) the conditions\n              encountered were materially different from those indicated;\n              (4) the conditions encountered were reasonably unforeseeable\n              based upon all the information available at the time of\n              bidding; and (5) its injury was caused solely by the differing\n              site condition.\n\nNova Group, Inc., ASBCA No. 55408, 10-2 BCA ,-r 34,533 at 170,321.

Cir. 1984).\n\n            ( 1) The Contract Contained Some Indications of Site Conditions\n\n       CCI and its experts have faulted the 2007 Andrea and 2003 USAID reports\ncontained in the contract's incorporated RFP for their lack of or limited site condition\ninformation (findings 23, 30, 42, 54, 58, 78, 135, 144, 165). Nonetheless, the RFP\ncontained some indications of site conditions. While said to be \"for information only\"\n(finding 6), the AR described subsoils at the project site and included three BH logs, two\nof which are relevant (findings 8, 9, 10). Borings are the most significant indication of\n\n\n                                             47\n\fsubsurface conditions. Nova Group, 10-2 BCA ~ 34,533 at 170,322, accord Optimum\nServices, Inc., ASBCA No. 57575, 13 BCA ~ 35,412 at 173 ,720. The \"information only\"\ndisclaimer does not shift the risk to CCI that the information might prove to be inaccurate.\nMe tcalf Construction Co., 2014 U.S . App. LEXIS 2515 at *29. Moreover, in response to\nQuestion 11 posed by potential offerors, the government stated that the best soil\ninvestigation data available to it was in the AR and offerors should assume that its data\nwas representative of the site. In response to Question 42, it stated that they should\nassume the three AR borings were representative of the entire site for the purposes of\ndeveloping a proposal, but that additional geotechnical information might be required\nduring project design. (Finding 25)\n\n       The RFP also had information about sedimentation near the site (finding 12). The\nUSAID report, said to be \"for information only\" (finding 25), contained information\nabout site geology, shoaling patterns, and dredging and disposal practices (findings 26-\n28).\n\n           (2)(a) Any Absolute Reliance upon the Andrea and USAID Reports\n                               Would be Unreasonable\n\n       Any absolute reliance upon the AR and USAID reports would be unreasonable. This\nwas a design/build contract. Regardless of the lack of weight of the disclaimers that the AR\nand USAID reports were for \"information only,\" the RFP and contract provided that site\nspecific geotechnical information necessary to design and construct the project was the\ncontractor' s responsibility (finding 6). Thus, CCI was on notice that it had some\nresponsibility for ascertaining the geological conditions that would affect the project.\nHowever, CCI conducted only a minimal pre-proposal site visit with no follow-up\npre-proposal investigations; it disregarded the warnings and advice of its consultant,\nMr. Dyer, that, among other things, project site conditions had not been addressed and its\nproposal price was much too low; and it proceeded to enter into the contract because it\nwanted its \"foot in the door\" in the Middle East in order to secure other business (findings\n15, 17, 18, 21 , 35, 37, 38, 52).\n\n         (2)(b) CCI Has Not Proved that it Relied upon the Indicated Conditions\n\n        The Andrea report had supported a preliminary design analysis by Weston in 2007\nfor an L&T pier system. When the AR was included in the RFP, the RFP contemplated a\ntraditional L&T pier construction, not CCI's open cell design (see findings 20, 21 , 48).\nRegardless of the AR' s suitability for a land-based open cell pier design, there is no\npersuasive evidence that CCI relied upon it or the USAID report in preparing its proposal.\nPrior to contract award Mr. Nottingham did most of the work on behalf ofPND (finding\n22). He testified that CCI relied upon the answers to Questions 11 and 42 because they\nwere the only things available and it was instructed to do so (finding 30). In support of its\n\n\n                                             48\n\freliance contentions, CCI alleges that it was responsible, at Mr. Nottingham's request, for\nposing those questions (app. br. at 75; app. reply br. at 10). However, while the answers\nto Questions 11 and 42 indeed made statements concerning the AR' s representation of\nsite conditions, none of the questions posed on behalf of CCI pertained to geographic site\nconditions and at least Question 42 is attributable to Weston (findings 21 , 24).\n\n       Mr. Nottingham testified that he looked at the AR' s three borings in helping to\nprepare CCI's proposal and relied upon their blow counts, but then acknowledged that\ntheir data was insufficient to determine whether the project could be constructed from the\nland side. He saw inconsistencies between descriptors that the soils were very soft and\nblow count data that indicated \"not a bad\" or a \"pretty good\" soil (finding 23). He noted\nto CCI that the BH were in one location and advised that it seek more information,\nrecognizing that the general information could not be used in any detail. He designed a\none-page concept plan that was incorporated into CCI ' s proposal but CCI has not rebutted\nthe Corps' assertion that the soil conditions and profile shown on his plan did not\ncorrespond to the AR data in the RFP. His concept plan, along with a generic cost\nestimate he made, did not discuss the AR or USAID report or detail any means or\nmethods of construction, such as the crane and crane pad at issue. (Findings 22, 23 , 30)\n\n       CCI has not directed us to any written statement or analysis by Mr. Nottingham, or\nanyone from PND, CCI, or PCI, at the time CCI submitted its proposals, of project site\nconditions that would allow land-based construction, or any contemporaneous written\nexpression of reliance by CCI upon the AR or USAID reports. CCI's proposals did not\ncontain a defined construction plan concerning the earthworks and filling operations or\nany statement of assumed ground or soil conditions. In fact, CCI did not perform any\ngeological testing of the site prior to contract award and recognized that it lacked soils\ndata. (Findings 35, 58)\n\n       Tellingly, for months, continuing through its REA, CCI blamed its pad failures\nupon dredging and dredge spoils ponds, not upon any alleged misplaced reliance upon the\nAR or USAID report (findings 75, 77, 80, 83, 86, 88, 93 , 94, 96, 98, 101 , 104, 105, 109,\n111). In its claim CCI still alleged that dredging was \"the root cause\" of the project\nproblems (finding 129). In his 4 February 2010 expert report, Mr. Hartley still raised\ndredging issues as contributing to the soil conditions encountered (finding 135).\n\n       Mr. Hartley, a PND principal, was not involved at the proposal stage and\nMr. Nottingham did not consult him (finding 32). His 4 February 2010 expert report\nacknowledged that \" (w]e have not discussed with the Contractor the interpretation\nprocedures they used in the evaluation of construction means and methods for the project\"\n(finding 132). No reason was given for this omission. His report merely assumed\nreliance without any stated basis for the assumption.\n\n\n\n                                            49\n\f       Significantly, PCI's principal, Mr. Nunn, testified credibly that, in the proposal\nplanning meetings, the AR was not the basis of any of the project constructability\ndiscussions (finding 31 ).\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, CCI has not satisfied the reliance requirement necessary\nto support a Type I differing site conditions claim.\n\n               (2)( c) Even if CCI Relied upon Indicated Site Conditions, it\n                            Did Not Interpret them Reasonably\n\n       Assuming, arguendo, that CCI relied upon the AR and USAID reports at the\nproposal stage, it did not interpret the indicated site conditions reasonably. From our own\nreview and the parties ' expert evidence, there were many indications that soft, weak soil\nconditions could be encountered, as summarized in section (4) below.\n\n        Moreover, even CCI's experts found the AR to be inconsistent and incomplete.\nMr. Hartley opined that it contained conflicting information on soil strength and that it\nwas hard to ascertain actual geological site conditions from the AR due to the conflicts\nand lack of data that a prudent geological engineer would include. (Findings 133, 135,\n139) Mr. Hoque found the AR to be confusing and opined that it did not contain\ninformation necessary for design and construction (findings 143 , 165). Mr. Lyman noted\nthat the BH logs described softer material than the blow counts indicated (finding 151 ).\n\n       Dr. Apted reported that the AR' s relatively high SPT N values were anomalous\nand indicated a higher undrained soil strength, unsupported by the BH log descriptions or\nthe AR' s reported vane strengths. He concluded that it should have been clear that the\nAR was limited in extent and quality and there was a risk of more difficult conditions.\n(Findings 159, 160, 166)\n\n       Thus, the Andrea report was contradictory on its face and did not have necessary\ndesign and construction information.\n\n  (3) The Conditions Encountered were Not Materially Different from those Indicated\n\n        In addition to the repeated crane pad material failures, post-award conditions\nincluded: ( 1) Gunderboom' s assessment of geotechnical problems apparent from the\noutset, including that a vessel was stuck in the muck in the middle of the job site, and\ndredging operations that might have deposited fine silt at the site for many years (finding\n109); (2) the National Lab's boring showing 2m of fill and 9m under it of very soft to\nsoft clay (finding 11 0); (3) the \"mudflat\" and dredging deposits observed by expert\nHartley (findings 105, 135); (4) the post-award Basra BH 2 that indicated a clayey silt\nranging from very soft to stiff (findings 59, 60, 134); (5) expert Hoque ' s observation of a\n\n\n                                              50\n\fmonotonous geology with an upper soft soil and competent soil below; his field testing by\nholding soil in his hands, which fell through his fingers, meaning it was very soft; and his\nobservation that silt was abundant at and/or below the surface throughout the site\n(findings 142, 144); (6) PND's January 2009 pre-construction report's description of the\nclays' design soil properties as very soft and expert Lyman's acknowledgement that this is\nwhat was encountered (findings 58, 156); and (7) expert Apted' s observations of a\nslippery, sheeny, silty clay surface or mud, in which he got bogged down, and his rebar\ntesting, indicating very soft soil conditions, which were readily apparent, along with a\nbrown river laden with sediment (finding 158).\n\n       Thus, site conditions were not materially different than indicated in the contract.\n\n    (4) The Conditions Encountered were Not Reasonably Unforeseeable Based upon\n                All the Information Available at the Time of Proposals\n\n       The RFP stated that offerors were expected to inspect the work site. Under the\ndesign/build contract, CCI was responsible for ascertaining conditions that could affect\nthe work, including tides, ground conditions, surface and subsurface conditions\nreasonably ascertainable from a site inspection, the government's exploratory work, and\nthe contract. It was to research all existing conditions at the naval base and waterway.\nSite specific geotechnical information necessary to design and construct the project and\ngeotechnical related items were CCI' s responsibility and it was to determine the\ngeotechnical conditions by field and laboratory investigations. (Findings 2, 4-6)\n\n        No one from CCI, PCI or PND attended the site visit. One SAR engineer attended.\nSAR did not have nearshore marine construction experience. We have not been directed\nto any evidence that the SAR engineer evaluated ground conditions or the suitability of\nthe site for land-based construction. The site visit was at high tide, reducing its scope, but\nnone of the questions the engineer posed pertained to geographic site conditions or CCI's\nmethod of dock construction. CCI did not request a ground investigation or hire a\ngeotechnical professional to evaluate its landside crane pad construction efforts until after\nslope instability occurred. (Findings 17, 21)\n\n        The RFP noted that the project site was on the west bank of a river that was an\nestuarine outflow of the Tigris-Euphrates delta system. A commercial port was\nimmediately upstream and the infrastructure was based on a continuous dredged quay\nalong the west bank. The river was heavily laden with fine sediments and a marine\nrailway between the commercial port and the naval base was reported to have already\nsilted in. Mr. Nunn, who was familiar with the project area due to PCI's work on a Basra\nairport project, knew that a dredging contractor was on site, that millions of dollars were\nbeing spent dredging the naval port, and the other piers were already clogged with\nsiltation. (Findings 12, 13, 16, 111) Indeed, CCI's expert Lyman concluded that\n\n\n                                             51\n\fdredging activities in close project proximity \"most likely produced a thin veneer of\nhighly saturated, unconsolidated, very weak soils,\" which might have exacerbated crane\naccess road instability (finding 150).\n\n        The Andrea report described the subsoil strata as consisting \"mainly of a very soft,\nsoft to medium gray to dark gray sandy silty clay\" layer with organic matter and soluble\nsalts, which overlaid a medium, dense to very dense layer of gray fine, medium to coarse\ngrained silty sand, with little gravel (finding 8). The majority of the first top soil was a\nsilt-sand-clay mixture. The relevant BH Nos. 2 and 3 were in an ebb and tide zone.\n(Findings 8, 9) The water table fluctuated and the zone immediately above it was \"greatly\naffected;\" as moisture increased, strength decreased and compressibility increased\n(finding 8). \"The saturated soil condition below the water table [made] the problem of\nsettlement significant\" (finding 9).\n\n        The AR stated that laboratory vane shear equipment was used to obtain the\nundrained shear strength of the samples due to high disturbance in all samplers that\nextruded from shelby tubes \"of the soft clayey layer, also it was found that this soil\nexudes between the fingers when squeezed in the fist so this could [be] described as very\nsoft to soft sandy clayey soil\" (finding 9). The undrained shear strength values were\nassociated with very soft to soft soils. The AR stated that organic matter with salts could\nbe found in the soil in many forms , which could significantly alter its engineering\nproperties, and that a site investigation had produced evidence of collapse due to the\nreaction between the fundamental soil compounds with organic matter. The AR noted\nthat, for construction on soft soil, the contractor could alleviate problems by replacing the\nsoft soil, using pile foundation or stabilizing or improving the soft soil. (!d.)\n\n        The AR' s log for BH No. 2, very near the pad site, described the top 7m of\nmaterial as very soft to soft silty clay with possible organic matter and shiny traces of\nsoluble salts. From 7 to 12.5m the material was soft to medium gray silty clay with some\nsilty sand pockets and shiny soluble salts. Dense to very dense materials started at 12.5m.\nSimilarly, the BH No. 3 log described the upper 7m as very soft to soft silty clay, with\npockets of fine sand, traces of organic matter and shiny soluble salts, and from 7 to 16.5m\nas soft silty clay with shiny soluble salts and some fine sand. Very dense material started\nat 6.5m, becoming loose to medium grained silty sand, with soluble salts, at 17 .Sm.\n(Findings 10, 11)\n\n       CCI's expert Hartley recognized that the AR indicated that there were problems\nwith extruding a sample from the Shelby tube \"because they were having issues with soft\nmaterial\" (finding 138). Its expert Hoque acknowledged that, even if blow counts gave\nthe most reliable data, visual classification should not be discounted (finding 147).\n\n\n\n\n                                             52\n\f       The USAID report noted the presence of silty sand and, suspended sediments;\nshoaling; dredged materials sidecast into the river channel; and a requirement for\nmaintenance dredging (findings 26-28).\n\n       The post-award ERDC report concluded that the \"very soft to soft\" consistency of\nthe foundation clays described in the AR should have served notice that dock construction\nand long-term performance were causes for concern; the high level of disturbance in the\nsoil samples was a direct result of the very soft to soft clay consistency and caused\nsignificant uncertainty in determining shear strength for slope stability analysis; it was\ncertain that the clay consistency was very soft to soft; and lack of information regarding\nwhich samples were tested in the lab vane tests or how many tests were performed\nincreased uncertainty (finding 117).\n\n        We are also persuaded by Dr. Apted's expert opinion that it reasonably could have\nbeen foreseen from the AR that the stratum underlying the site along the foreshore was\nlikely to be very soft or soft clay and that there was enough information in the AR and\nUS AID report to highlight a significant risk of very soft ground occurring below the\nforeshore, such that unconstrained construction of earthworks over the foreshore was at\nrisk of failure (findings 160, 166).\n\n        (5) CCI has Not Proved that its Claimed Injury was Caused Solely by the\n                          Claimed Differing Site Conditions\n\n        CCI advocated in the quantum portion of this appeal that it had segregated those of\nits alleged extra costs that were not attributable to its claimed differing site conditions\nfrom those that were. The Corps disagreed. Because we do not reach quantum, we only\nnote that even if, arguendo, there were differing site conditions, there are several factors\nundermining ccrs contention that its claimed costs were all attributable to them.\n\n        CCI claims that its proposal did not include profit or overhead (finding 38). Its\nconsultant found profit, overhead, contingencies and cash flow deficiencies in its\nproposal which he assessed could easily result in a shortfall of over $15,600,000 and\ncreate a severe risk to CCI. He reported that it did not do a project estimate or address\nproject conditions. (Finding 37) PCI's subcontractor Gunderboom believed it had\nunderestimated the work and time necessary for the project and was highly critical of\nPCI's perfonnance throughout the project, including its alleged failure to understand soils\nissues (findings 63. 109). CCI's Mr. Smithson was also highly critical ofPCI's project\nmanagement (finding 102). CCI and West had considerable difficulties procuring barges,\ncranes and some equipment (finding 119). Moreover, CCI did not present required proof\nthat all of its claimed differing site condition delays were to work on the critical path. See\nWilner v.

The Board held a\n15-day hearing, in Anchorage, Alaska, and Falls Church, Virginia. We heard entitlement\nand quantum but because we deny the appeal we do not decide quantum and therefore do\nnot make quantum findings.\n\n                                   FINDINGS OF FACT\n\n       1. On 25 April 2008 GRS issued a request for proposals (RFP) for a negotiated\ndesign/build contract under the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program. The Iraqi Navy\nwas the FMS customer. The RFP sought seawall design and construction; a design to\nminimize dredging; and construction of an \"L-shaped\" pier (\"Pier 1\"), with an option for\na \"T-shaped\" pier (\"Pier 2\") (north of an existing Pier 3) at Umm Qasr, Iraq. The\ncontractor was responsible for project design and was to submit required design\ndocumentation at 35%, 99%, and 100% phases. (R4, tab 103 at 1 of87, at Scope of Work\n(SOW) at 96-97, 101-03 of 113, tab 103 at 5 of 89; tr. 8/80)\n\f       2. The RFP contained the FAR 52.236-27, SITE VISIT (CONSTRUCTION) (FEB\n1995) clause under which offerors are urged and expected to inspect the work site (R4,\ntab 103 at 71 of 89).\n\n       3. The RFP included the FAR 52.236-2, DIFFERING SITE CONDITIONS (APR 1984)\nclause, which states, concerning a \"Type I\" differing site condition, at issue:\n\n                      (a) The Contractor shall promptly, and before the\n              conditions are disturbed, give a written notice to the [CO] of\n              ( 1) subsurface or latent physical conditions at the site which\n              differ materially from those indicated in this contract.. ..\n\n                      (b) The [CO] shall investigate the site conditions\n              promptly after receiving the notice. If [they] do materially so\n              differ and cause an increase .. .in the Contractor's cost of, or\n              the time required for, performing any part of the work under\n              this contract, whether or not changed as a result of the\n              conditions, an equitable adjustment shall be made ....\n\n(R4, tab 103 at 84 of 89)\n\n       4. The RFP also contained the FAR 52.236-3, SITE INVESTIGATION AND\nCONDITIONS AFFECTING THE WORK (APR 1984) clause which provides that the contractor\nacknowledges that it has satisfied itself as to the conditions that can affect the work,\nincluding tide uncertainties; ground conditions; and surface and subsurface conditions\nreasonably ascertainable from a site inspection, the government's exploratory work, and\nthe contract. The clause disclaims government responsibility for the contractor's failure\nto do so or for its conclusions. (R4, tab 103 at 84-85 of 89)\n\n       5. The RFP stated that the \"Contractor/Designer shall research all existing\nconditions\" at the naval base and waterway (R4, tab 103, SOW at 96 of 113).\n\n       6.

The referenced Appendix C, \"Report on Site Investigation for Dock at Urn\nQasir Port at Basrah Governorate,\" dated May 2007, was prepared by Iraq's Andrea\nEngineering Tests Laboratory for a different contractor \"to explore the subsoil conditions\nof the proposed site to facilitate the foundation design for ... new docks & related\nstructures at Urn Qasir Port\" (R4, tab 103, app'x Cat 1) (Andrea report or AR). The\nreport addressed a field investigation that included three boreholes (BH), an in-situ\nStandard Penetration Test (SPT) and other tests. It contained BH locations and logs; field\ntest results; and a summary of laboratory test results. The SPT measured soil consistency\nat several depths. It was performed in all types of soil, especially in \"sandy clayey layers\"\n(AR at 3). The AR included American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) tests:\nvisual classification; natural moisture content and unit weight; specific gravity; grain size\n\n\n                                              3\n\fdistribution; liquid and plastic limits; shear tests, including unconfirmed and triaxial\ncompression and direct shear; and consolidation compressibility; plus various chemical\nanalyses on soil. (AR at 1-12 and appendices)\n\n       8. The AR stated at § IV, \"DESCRIPTION OF SUBSOIL STRATA\":\n\n                     The subsoil strata consist mainly of a very soft, soft to\n             medium gray to dark gray sandy silty clay layer with black\n             traces of organic matter and white shiny traces ofsoluble\n             salts, overlying medium, dense to very dense layer of gray\n             fine, medium to coarse grained siltY sand, with little gravel.\n\n                    The water table was encountered, as observed at the\n             time of investigation between (0.0-1.0), below the existing\n             ground level (NGL), at [BH] nos 2 & 3, which were in the\n             ebb and tide zone.

The zone immediately\n             above water table is greatly affected as far as strength and\n             compressibility are concerned. As moisture increased the\n             strength decreased and compressibility increased.\n\n(AR at 4) (Emphasis added)\n\n      9. The AR stated at§ VI, \"DISCUSSION OF RESULTS\":\n\n             The site subsoil consists mainly from two layers, the first\n             layer of very soft, soft to medium gray sandy silty clay with\n             amount of soluble salts and organic matter overlying on a\n             layer of medium, dense to very dense gray silty sand.... [T]he\n             majority of the first top soil is classified as ... silt-sand-clay\n             mixtures.\n\n                    The water table was encountered. .. between (0.0-1.0)\n             meter below the existing ground level.... Furthermore, the\n             site was within the ebb and tide zone of the sea.\n\n                   The saturated soil condition below the water table\n             makes the problem ofsettlement significant as consolidation is\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\f             a process of graduated decrease of the water content from\n             saturated soil under constant load.\n\n\n\n                    A laboratory vane shear equipment. .. is used to obtain\n             the undrained shear strength, this method was used due to\n             high disturbance in all samplers that extruded from shelby\n             tubes of the soft clayey layer, also it was found that this soil\n             exudes between the fingers when squeezed in the fist so this\n             could [be] described as very soft to soft sandy clayey soil.\n\n                    The values of undrained shear strength were found to\n             be approximately in the range of about (1 0 to 25) kPa\n             [kilopascals] for soft soil at depth from (0 to 14)m.\n\n                    In the case of the construction on soft soil, three\n             options are available to ensure that there will not be\n             significant problems during the design life of the structure[:]\n\n                           i. Replacement of the soft soil.\n                           ii. Using pile foundation, and\n                           iii. Stabilization or improvement ofsoft soil.\n\n                     Organic matter with presence ofsalts may be found in\n             the soil in many forms. The increase in those contents of the\n             soil may cause some alteration in engineering properties of\n             the soil.\n\n                     The presence of organic matter may cause significant\n             changes in the properties of the soil. The effects on fine\n              grained soils may be more obvious, such alteration could be\n              noticed through color and odor of the clay and .. .suitable\n             remedy without exceeding the proper bound of the safety may\n              be required. Investigation of the site area has produced\n             evidence ofsome kind of collapse due to the reaction between\n             fundamental compounds of the soil (sandy clayey layer) with\n             organic matter....\n\n(AR at 8-9) (Emphasis added) Regarding the kPas, Corps Manual 1110-1-1804-\nGeotechnical Investigations, cited by the Corps and by CCI's fact and expert witness\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\fMike Hartley (below), describes values less than 25 kPa as \"Very soft\" and from 25 to 50\nkPa as \"Soft\" (R4, tab 2 at 15, tab 97 at 13).\n\n        10. The AR contained three BH logs. BH No. 1 was inland from where the crane\npad at issue was to be constructed and the parties have discounted it. BH No.2 was very\nnear the pad site. (AR, app'x A, app'x Bat 1, 2; exs. A-234 at 6, G-24; tr. 2/168-69,\n6/33) Its log described the top 7m of material as \"[v]ery soft to soft gray to dark gray\nsilty CLAY with black spots and/or pocket of organic matter and shiny traces of soluble\nsalts\"; from 7 to 12.5m as \"[s}oft to medium gray silty CLAY with some silty sand pocket\n& shiny spots ofsoluble salts\"; and from 12.5 to 18m as \"[d]ense to very dense gray\ncoarse grained clayey silty SAND with some coarse gravel & cobbles\" (AR, app'x Bat 2)\n(emphasis added).\n\n        11. The BH No.3 log described the upper 7m as \"[v]ery soft to soft gray to dark\ngray silty CLAY with rusty brown pocket of fine sand & black traces of organic matter &\nshiny spots of soluble salts\"; from 7 to 16.5m as \"[s}oft dark gray silty CLAY with white\nshiny traces of soluble salts & yellowish brown line of fine sand\"; from 16.5 to 17 .5m as\n\"[v ]ery dense coarse grained gravelly SAND with some cobbles and boulders\"; and from\n17.5 to 24m as \"[l]oose to medium gray to dark gray medium grained silty SAND with\nshiny traces of soluble salts\" (AR, app'x Bat 3) (emphasis added).\n\n        12. The RFP noted the site was on an estuarine outflow of the Tigris-Euphrates\ndelta system, with current flow predominantly tidal and maximum velocities near four\nknots during spring tide ebb flow. It addressed sedimentation:\n\n              The closest waterfront development to this site is the\n              commercial port of Umm Qasr located immediately\n              \"upstream\". The infrastructure is based upon a continuous\n              dredged quay along the west bank of Khawar Abd Allah ....\n\n              Satellite photos substantiate local reports that Khawr Abd\n              Allah is heavily laden with fine sediments. Although actual\n              situation [sic] rates experienced within the commercial port\n              are not known, ... the marine railway located between the\n              commercial port and the proposed Navy Base is reported to\n              have already silted in. [Emphasis added]\n\n(R4, tab 105 at 1, see tab 106; tr. 2/29-30, 120) The project was largely in an intertidal\nzone, between low tide and high tide, with some of it beyond the low tide line (tr. 6/29).\n\n      13. Iraqi contractor Sada Al-Raneen (SAR) brought the RFP to Poly Earth\nConstruction International, LLC (PCI), for which SAR had been a subcontractor in 2005\n\n\n                                             6\n\fon a Basra airport project with which Lee Nunn was involved. Mr. Nunn and Samuel\nPelant had formed PCI. Mr. Pelant, a project manager, was not an engineer. Mr. Nunn\nwas a registered civil and nuclear engineer. He was with the Corps for 23 years prior to\nretiring. He had many major engineering jobs at the Corps and in the private sector. His\nwork had included several projects in the Middle East. (Ex. G-26, part 1 at 39, part 2 at\n184; tr. 2/138-151, 212; see R4, tab 111 at 4)\n\n       14. Mr. Nunn consulted with Dennis Nottingham, then a principal in Peratrovich\nNottingham, a marine engineering firm also known as PND Engineers (PND), and gave\nhim the RFP. Prior to his retirement in August 2009, Mr. Nottingham, who held a\nmasters degree, apparently in the geotechnical area, had 50 years' experience as a\nprofessional engineer. He held a patent on an \"open cell\" process that was attractive to\nMr. Nunn for pier construction. (Tr. 2/6-8, 77, 104-05, 151-52)\n\n       15. Mr. Nottingham confirmed that the project was immediately downstream of\nthe old port but asserted that, due to dredging, the old port was trapping all sediment. If\nany remained, a gentle curve in the river formed an outside bend, causing scouring that\nwould sweep it away from the project. (Ex. G-2; tr. 2/119-20, 127-31) He interpreted a\nUnited States Agency for International Development (USAID) report included in the RFP\n(below) to mean that sediment deposits were on the inside bends (ex. G-2; tr. 2/41-42,\n119-20, 127-31). That is where he \"expected the weak soils to be\" (tr. 2/42).\nMr. Nottingham's scouring views are supported in part by Dr. Michael Briggs, a research\nhydraulic engineer at the Corps' Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC).\nHe prepared a Navigation Design Review, dated 6 January 2009, post contract award, of a\nrevised CCI submittal, noting that the new piers were on the outside of a slight concave\nbend in the river, so shoaling should not be a problem. Scour and erosion from riverine\ncurrents were more likely. He stated that the \"bottom\" should be considered \"soft.\" He\ndid not do a geotechnical design review or analysis relative to soils. (Ex. A-15 at 174826)\n\n       16. CCI's proposal eliminated a dredging item to be priced on the ground that, by\npushing the pier further into the channel, greater scouring would occur and the flow of\nwater would keep sedimentation down (tr. 2/153, 8/64; see also R4, tab 112 at 3-4).\nHowever, \"Mr. Nunn knew that a dredging contractor was on site; that \"[t]hey were\nspending millions of dollars dredging the naval port\" and \"the other piers were already\nclogged with siltation\" (tr. 21153).\n\n        17. In Mr. Nottingham's experience it is the contractor's choice how to proceed\nwith open cell dock construction. It has been done with barges, including when very soft\nsoils are present, and with combination marine and land-based operations. Most open cell\nprojects with which he had been involved had been built from the land. If it is possible to\nget a good purchase and the ground is substantial enough to hold tlie equipment, a\nland-based approach is normally lower cost. According to Mr. Nunn, PCI considered\n\n\n                                             7\n\fonly land-based construction and saw nothing contrary to that approach. (Ex. G-27 at\n11-12; tr. 2/25-27, 84-85, 154) He acknowledged that open cell work was often done\nfrom barges, but stated that, if it were possible to do it from the land, \"the economics\ndemand that\" (tr. 21155). Mr. Nottingham's involvement with the geotechnical aspects of\nproject design appears to have been limited. CCI did not request a ground investigation\nor hire a geotechnical professional to evaluate its landside crane pad construction efforts\nuntil after slope instability occurred (below). 1\n\n        18. Mr. Nunn consulted with Keith Burke, president of CCI, a subsidiary of\nBristol Bay Native Corporation (BBNC), to see if CCI would be interested in the project.\nMr. Burke, who was not an engineer, and Jim Hutton, eventually CCI's project manager,\nattended a PND briefing, which demonstrated a land-based operation. CCI had very little\nexperience in marine construction and had never been involved in an open cell project,\nbut it wanted to expand its government contracting work and thought it would be an\nopportunity to get its \"foot in the door .. .in the [Middle East]\" (ex. G-27 at 8). At the\nproposal stage Mr. Burke did not receive a copy ofthe RFP. (R4, tab 112 at 5, 17;\ntr. 1150-52, 54-57, 74, 77, 105-07; ex. G-18 at 41, G-27 at 7, 9; see R4, tab 111 at 4) CCI\ndid not do an estimate; PCI and PND did the pric~ng (tr. 11147).\n\n        19. PCI and PND were responsible for project design and engineering. PCI was\nto run it with PND and SAR as its subcontractors. (Ex. G-27 at 16-17; tr. 1157)\n\n       20. The Corps received about 10 proposals. All but CCI proposed \"L&T\" piers\ncalled for in the RFP. At PC I' s request, the RFP was amended to allow for alternative\nconcepts, such as open cell. (Tr. 8/30-31, 34, 43-44)\n\n        21. The site visit was on 17 May 2008. CCI, PCI and PND did not attend. A\nSAR engineer attended. SAR did not have nearshore marine construction experience.\nThe on-site supervisor from Weston Solutions (Weston), which was performing other\nwork at Umm Qsar, attended. Commander Raymond Deck, an engineer, conducted the\nvisit by bus and walking. The tide was high. Low tide photos were in RFP Amendment\nNo.2, but the low tide areas were covered with water during the visit and attendees could\nnot then have walked on them. The visit lasted about 90 minutes but there was no\ndeadline; the attendees determined the time spent. They took photographs and posed\nwritten questions, which Commander Deck gave to the Corps so the questions and\nanswers would be provided to all offerors. During the visit the contractors were told\nabout the need to dredge an area between what was then perceived to be the L&T pier\narea and the shoreline, because there was so much silt vessels would not be able to moor.\nThat day, SAR's engineer reported to Mr. Pelant2 . He forwarded photos, questions he\n\n1\n    For efficiency, we often refer to \"CCI,\" even if other entities were involved.\n2\n    Unless otherwise noted, all cited communications were by email.\n\n                                               8\n\fhad posed and the answers. None of the questions pertained to geographic site conditions\nor CCI' s planned method of dock construction. We have not been directed to any\nevidence that SAR evaluated ground conditions or the site's suitability for land-based\nconstruction. CCI did not attempt a site visit until after contract award. (R4, tab 104 at\n3-4, 10, tab 151; ex. G-26, part 1 at 36-38, part 2 at 184-85, 190; tr. 21155, 157, 229-30,\n81124-25, 129, 139-40, 143-45, 151, 168-70, 172-73, 181-85)\n\n        22. Prior to contract award Mr. Nottingham did most of the work on behalf ofPND\n(tr. 2/97). He designed a one-page concept plan dated 8 May 2008 that was incorporated\ninto CCI's proposal (R4, tab 112 following pg. 17, tab 150). CCI has not rebutted the\nCorps' assertion that the soil conditions and profile shown on his plan did not correspond to\nthe AR data in the RFP (see R4, tab 103c, AR, app'x B-[BH] Logs, tab 150; gov't br. at 20,\nproposed finding (PF) 52, 229-31; gov't reply at 18). Mr. Nottingham also prepared a\ngeneric estimate, dated 21 May 2008, based upon a preliminary design, of the cost of\nbuilding a similar open cell system, from the land, in the United States Gulf or South Coast\nregion, because he had not previously worked in the Middle East (R4, tab 153 at 15868;\ntr. 2/50, 53, 73, 107-08, 137). Mr. Nottingham's concept plan and cost estimate do not\ndiscuss the AR or USAID report or detail means and methods of construction, such as the\ncrane and crane pad at issue.\n\n       23. Mr. Nottingham read the AR and saw,.inconsistencies between descriptors by a\ngeologist(s) that the soils were \"very soft\" and blow count data that indicated \"not a bad\nsoil\" or a \"pretty good soil\" (tr. 2/61, 63). He placed more reliance upon the latter. He\nnoted to CCI' s proposal team that all of the borings were in one place, did not cover the\nlarge project, and they should seek more information. There was general information that\ncould be used but not in any detail. (Tr. 2/35, 44-45, 63-64, 67)\n\n      24. On 22 May 2008 Weston posed several questions to MAJ Joseph Brands, the\ngovernment's point of contact for project questions, including:\n\n              5) Geotechnical Conditions: Will the government be\n              providing any bidding assumptions associated with the\n              existing geotechnical conditions? For bidding purposes,\n              should the contractor assume the three borings provided are\n              representative of the entire site?\n\n              [Current SOW represents undue risk to the contractor based on\n              the unknown conditions. A fair basis for bidding is required.]\n\n(Ex. G-469)\n\n\n\n\n                                             9\n\f       25. RFP Amendment No.2, effective 6 June 2008, included questions posed by\npotential offerors and answers (R4, tab 104 at 1-2). The following are pertinent:\n\n              Question 11: Soil investigation not enough we need more\n              point of locations.\n\n              Answer 11: The best soil investigation data available to the\n              government is provided in Appendix-C Geotechnical\n              Investigation of the SOW [the AR]. The contractor should\n              assume the data provided in Appendix C is representative of\n              the project site.\n\n(R4, tab 104 at 8)\n\n              Question 42: Geotechnical Conditions: Will the\n              government be providing any bidding assumptions\n              associated with the existing geotechnical conditions?\n              For bidding purposes, should the contractor assume the\n              three borings provided are representative of the entire\n              site?\n\n              Answer 42: The contractor should assume the three borings\n              provided are representative of the entire site for the purposes\n              of developing a proposal. However, additional geotechnical\n              information maybe [sic] required during the design phase of\n              this project.\n\n(!d. at 13) Amendment No.2 also added an April2003 report from Stevedoring Services\nof America, BERGER/ABAM Engineers, Inc. to USAID, called Draft Umm Qasr Port\nAssessment (USAID report). The amendment stated: \"DISCLAIMER: The report is\nprovided for information only. The Government cannot guarantee the relevance,\ntimeliness, or accuracy of these materials\" (R4, tab 104 at 2, tab 107) (emphasis added).\n\n       26. USAID report,§ 3.1.5, \"Geology,\" noted that:\n\n              The streams are alluvial and the channels are apparently\n              composed primarily of sand and silt. Clay may be present, but\n              no clay balls were seen in the dredged material disposal areas.\n              There is a thin film of sun-cracked silt or clay at some of the\n              final settlement ponding areas. Boring information shows the\n              materials encountered in the original \"new\" port excavation as\n\n\n\n                                             10\n\f              silty sand with small fine gravel and clay. In fill sediments\n              since then may be of a finer, more silty nature.\n\n(R4, tab 107 at 10)\n\n       27. USAID report,§ 3.1.9, \"Shoaling Patterns and History,\" stated:\n\n              UMM Qasr Port is adjacent to an embayment [that] is the\n              estuary for several small rivers that drain a wetland area north\n              of the Port ....\n\n              The channel downstream ... follows the typical pattern of\n              sediments deposited in bar formations on the insides of the\n              bends. Additionally, as the inlet widens downstream and\n              current velocities are reduced, cross channel bars are\n              deposited that are shaped by upstream and downstream tidal\n              currents into typical ebb-flood pairs.\n\n              The channel bends and the cross channel bars are areas where\n              maintenance dredging will be focused. In the Port, deposition\n              occurs along both sides in the \"old\" port, requiring\n              maintenance dredging along the berths and along the opposite\n              shore ....\n\n              ... Suspended sediments entering the [\"new\" port] cut on the\n              incoming tide settle out in the quiet water primarily at the\n              sides creating the need for maintenance dredging at the berths.\n              The eastern side of the cut is shoaled extensively .... Recently\n              constructed dikes should eliminate this shoaling source ....\n\n              A spit grows from river channel sediments at the entrance of\n              the \"new\" port cut. This spit requires regular maintenance\n              dredging.\n\n              Nearly continuous maintenance dredging of the berths and\n              approach channel from the Pilot Boat Station will be required\n              to keep the Port viable. The existence of a large number of\n              dredge vessels in various states of functionality appear [sic] to\n              confirm that requirement.\n\n(R4, tab 107 at 11)\n\n\n\n                                             11\n\f       28. USAID report§ 3.2.8, \"Past Dredging and Disposal Practices,\" stated:\n\n              There are sizable upland dredged material disposal areas\n              nearby, opposite both the \"old\" and \"new\" ports. A large\n              estuary area behind Berths 13 to 16 has also been utilized as a\n              cutter-suction dredge disposal site. Dike and spillway\n              construction and maintenance .do not appear to be a high\n              priority, with some dredged materials finding their way back\n              to the Port waters.\n\n              The British Military indicate that. .. some of the cutter-suction\n              dredge materials were simply sidecast in the river channel\n              opposite or downstream of the \"old\" port ....\n\n              Hopper dredged disposal was reported to be just downstream\n              of the work areas. There does not appear to have been any\n              consistent effort to haul the dredged materials any distance to\n              insure their non-return to the shoaling locations.\n\n(R4, tab 107 at 13) The report also noted that there were dredged material disposal sites\nnot far from the old and new ports (id., § 3.2.9).\n\n        29. CCI alleges that the USAID report \"explicitly indicates\" that scouring would\noccur at the project site, eliminating all sediment and silt, regardless of any dredging\npractices (app. reply br. at 7). While acknowledging the scouring mentioned by\nMr. Nottingham and Dr. Briggs (finding 20), we find that neither§ 3.1.9 nor any other\nsection of the US AID report suggests that all sediment and silt would be scoured from the\nsite, regardless of dredging (R4, tab 107).\n\n        30. Mr. Nottingham responded affirmatively to questions posed by CCI's counsel\nas to whether he and the \"CCI team\" had relied upon the RFP's answers to questions 11\nand 42 in developing \"your proposal for Umm Qasr.\" \"Yes, that's all we had. And we\nwere instructed to do that. So that's what we did.\" (Tr. 2/45-46 (question 11)) \"Yes.\nWe had nothing else.\" (Tr. 2/47 (question 42)) Mr. Nottingham looked at the three\nborings in helping to prepare the proposal (tr. 2/56) and relied upon blow counts as \"the\nonly really non-subjective information\" (tr. 2/133). He relied upon the borings to\ndetermine whether the project could be built from the land (tr. 2/47), but acknowledged\nthat the data was insufficient for that determination:\n\n                   Q      After receiving that answer [to question 42], did\n             you determine whether or not the data provided in the three\n\n\n\n                                              12\n\f              bore logs was sufficient for the team to determine whether or\n              not this project could be built from the land side?\n\n                     A      It wasn't sufficient, but it was what we had and\n              using those borings, as representative of the whole site, we\n              determined that you could probably buil[d) it from the land\n              side. [Emphasis added]\n\n(Tr. 2/48, see also tr. 2/67 (Based upon Mr. Nottingham's \"preliminary analysis,\" using\navailable data, apparently prior to receipt of the answers to questions 11 and 42, it\n\"looked like\" shore-side construction would be viable. There is no evidence that his\nanalysis was memorialized in writing.))\n\n      31. Mr. Nunn testified credibly that, in the proposal planning meetings, the AR\nwas not the basis of any of the project constructability discussions (tr. 2/213).\n\n       32. At the time of the project, PCI had never been awarded a federal contract and\nMr. Nunn had not been involved as a contractor in an open cell construction project. PCI\nmarketed foam insulation and other things. It was formed to seek work in the Middle\nEast. Mr. Pelant, who had some small scale marine construction experience, did not have\nopen cell experience. With PND, he put together the proposal's technical and\nmanagement approach and the preliminary schedule. Mr. Nottingham was PND's main\nrepresentative. Mr. Hartley, a PND principal, was not involved at the proposal stage and\nMr. Nottingham did not consult him. (Tr. 2/210-12, 4/9, 16-17)\n\n       33. The parties agree that CCI submitted its alternative open cell pier proposal to\nthe Corps on or about 23 June 2008 (app. br. at 16; gov't br. at 8, ~ 13). Mr. Pelant\nprepared its narrative, with input from others at PCI, PND and CCI. He worked with\nMessrs. JeffMekinda and Hutton of CCI on the pricing. He described Mr. Mekinda as a\ntradesman and plumber and Mr. Hutton as an architect who had worked in business\ndevelopment. (Ex. G-26, part 1 at 32-33)\n\n       34. On 23 July 2008, the CO noted that CCI had not submitted a dredging cost.\nHe also stated that its cost proposal was very high compared to the government's estimate\nand asked for a final revised one. (R4, tab 156 at 177701-02; tr. 8/93) On about\n14 August 2008, CCI submitted a revised proposal (ex. A-4). Under \"Schedule\nconstraints specific to Engineering,\" it stated:\n\n             a. Geotechnical and marine/bathymetric surveys. These are\n                hard constraints as it is critical to identify exactly where\n                the proposed port structure will be most advantageously\n                located. The information from the surveys is critical and\n\n\n                                            13\n\f                 drives the design as well as material quantities for\n                 procurement and civil works. We feel that there is not\n                 enough information provided in the RFP and subsequent\n                 amendments to properly ascertain this information to the\n                 required degree of accuracy for quality design and\n                 engineering. [Emphasis added]\n\n(!d. at 8304)\n\n       3 5. CCI does not claim, and there is no evidence of record, that it performed any\ngeological testing of the site prior to contract award. There is no written analysis of\nrecord by Mr. Nottingham, or anyone else from PND, CCI, or PCI, at the time CCI\nsubmitted its initial and amended proposals, of conditions that would allow land-based\nconstruction or any contemporaneous written expression of reliance by CCI upon the AR\nor USAID reports. CCI's proposals did not contain a defined construction plan\nconcerning the earthworks and filling operations or any statement of assumed ground or\nsoil conditions. They did not mention a crane pad or 280-ton crane, a plan to use a\nland-based crane to drive sheet pile, or any land-based construction approach.\n{Tr. 6/110-11, 13/179; see ex. G-16 at 9, 22) However, CCI claims without rebuttal that\nan attached photograph depicted open cell dock construction from the land {app. reply br.\nat 6).\n\n       36. On about 20 August 2008 the Corps requested \"Best and Final\" offers. CCI\nresponded on 26 August 2008. The Corps found that its open cell proposal was the most\nacceptable ofthe proposals. (R4, tab 160; tr. 11150, 8/36, 39, 45-46)\n\n        37. Mr. Burke asked Robert Dyer, a well-known consultant well experienced in\nconstruction management, to perform a risk analysis ofCCI's proposal (tr. 1162-63,\n143-44; ex. G-27 at 93). Mr. Dyer's 3 September 2008 analysis identified several areas\nof significant to severe risk, including that CCI had not done a project estimate or seen\nthe base contract. There was very little estimating breakdown, with much of the material\nfrom Iraqi subcontractors. He acknowledged that CCI wanted its \"foot in the door\" in the\nMiddle East but found profit, overhead, construction and design contingencies, and cash\nflow inadequacies in its proposal. General project site conditions were not discussed. He\ninterpreted the proposal as carrying 5% profit, only about half of which would go to CCI,\nwhereas major foreign and United States construction contractors in Iraq had 30 to 40%\nprofit factors. While he had been told that the proposal included home office overhead,\nhe found the amounts to be unacceptably low and inconsistent with its normal 13.5% rate.\nHe noted that CCI had reduced its price by over $7 million and opined that there could\neasily be a shortfall of over $15,600,000. Citing the tight project schedule, with only 10\nmonths for the base period and liquidated damages of$2,700 per day, he suggested it\ncould be a good decision to step away. (R4, tab 162 at 162753-57)\n\n\n                                            14\n\f        38. According to Mr. Burke, CCI's proposal did not include overhead and profit.\nAccording to him and Messrs. Nunn and Pelant, it expected further negotiations on those\nmatters. (Ex. G-26, part 2 at 244-46; tr. 1159, 2/161-62); but see R4, tab 173 (Hutton\n16 September 2008 email to Burke (\"we may be taking this project at a lower profit in\nanticipation of other work.\")) On 7 September 2008 Mr. Pelant notified the CO that CCI\nexpected to negotiate overhead and profit (ex. A-5 at 12688). On 9 September 2008\nMr. Pelant notified the project team and/or others that CCI would pose questions and\nconcerns to the Corps because \"we feel we can't successfully prosecute this project for\nthe price with the amount of unknowns that still exist\" (R4, tab 163 at 16296).\n\n       39. On 10 September 2008, the CO notified Mr. Pelant that PCI's $38,462,386.58\noffer for the base and option 1 periods had been accepted and attached her signed copy of\nthe contract, which named PCI as the offeror (ex. A-6 at 12019-20, 12036).\n\n       40. Mr. Burke asked the CO about overhead and profit. The Corps does not deny\nthat she said it was out of her control at that point, but there would be contract additions\nand change orders with higher overhead and profit rates. Mr. Burke felt that, under those\ncircumstances, CCI would make money. The Corps never informed CCI that it was\ncompelled to sign the contract; it elected to do so. (Tr. 1/59-60, 61-62, 156-57, 8/51)\n\n        41. The contract, awarded 10 September 2008, incorporated the above RFP\nprovisions and contained clause SCR 4, RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CONTRACTOR FOR\nDESIGN-MAY 2002. It also included the government's exercise of its option for Pier 2,\na floating pier. The contract completion date was 27 September 2009. (R4, tab 3 at 1-2,\n6, 24, 102-05 of 114; tr. 2/79; see R4, tab 19 at 1; tr. 5/124)\n\n       42. On 16 September 2008 Mr. Nottingham sent to PCI's Paul Johnson (tr. 2/91,\n149) a drawing of\"immediate survey and bathymetry needs,\" stated that four soil borings\nwere needed, and specified boring and sampling criteria (R4, tab 171 at 7774). The same\nday Mr. Johnson reported about a meeting with PND:\n\n                 •   The need to get IMMEDIATE efforts on the field work\n                     was emphasized over and over again. It was apparent\n                     that due to a lack of data on soils, bathemetry, etc. [sic]\n                     could really pose design delays ....\n\n\n\n                 •   PND needs to get a copy of the contract between\n                     CCI/PCI and the Corps for the project - so that they\n\n\n\n                                             15\n\f                      can clearly get an idea of the design considerations,\n                      etc.\n                  •   Lee discussed his desire to get spec requirements for\n                      the soils needed for the back-fill from PND. PND\n                      outlined their requirement for gradation and the\n                      threshold requirements for the first 70ft of the\n                      back-fill. It was initially felt that the previously\n                      dredged material should work.... PND stated that after\n                      the first 70ft, ... could essentially use residual material\n                      found on site or other fill. The only gradation\n                      requirement was near the sheet pile.\n\n\n\n                         •   Need 2 150 ton cranes to install sheet pile ....\n                             Back-jill can actually be started prior to receipt\n                             ofsheet piles and will serve as crane staging\n                             point rather than using barge based cranes to\n                             install sheet pile.\n\n(R4, tab 174) (Italics added)\n\n        43. The Corps contends, based upon the foregoing and otherwise, that CCI shifted\nfrom a marine-based to a land-based construction method after contract award (e.g., gov't\nbr. at 36; see tr. 13/164). CCI counters that land-hased construction was always\ncontemplated (app. reply br. at 5). As noted, CCI's proposal did not directly address its\nconstruction method. Mr. Nunn testified credibly that, during the proposal stage, there\nwas no consideration apart from land-based construction of the open cell system (finding\n17; tr. 2/154-55). Mr. Hutton testified at his deposition that construction was intended to\nbe by land-based crane (ex. G-27 at 12). We find that the weight of the evidence is that\nCCI intended to use a land-based construction method for its open cell system.\n\n      44. PCI and SAR apparently entered into a contract dated 10 October 2008 in\nconnection with the project (R4, tab 177). At some point PCI terminated the contract due\nto SAR's alleged failure to perform (ex. G-26, part II at 207-09).\n\n       45. PND and PCI entered into an agreement for professional engineering services\nin connection with the project effective 10 October 2008. Prior to the Corps' contract\naward, PCI did not ask for, and PND did not perform, a constructability analysis or\nevaluate the equipment or materials the contractor would need. Mr. Nottingham did not\nprepare a formal slope stability analysis to determine if the beach could support a crane\npad, but testified that the borings indicated it could. He did not calculate a factor of\n\n                                              16\n\fsafety (FOS) based upon a load on shore. He was not consulted about crane pad design\nand did not do any written analysis of the AR. (R4, tab 178; tr. 21100-04, 240)\n\n       46. The pre-construction meeting occurred on 18 October 2008 (see ex. A-13 at\n19191 ). CCI and PCI entered into an agreement dated 27 October 2008 concerning their\nteaming arrangement (R4, tab 180). The NTP apparently issued in late October or in\nNovember 2008 (see gov't br. at 36, PF 100 (unrebutted as to NTP)).\n\n        47. On 19 November 2008, Carl McNabb, a PND engineer (tr. 2178, 194), wrote\nto Mr. Nunn that, for its pile schedule, PND was making several assumptions about the\nsoil, one of the more significant being that the sand layer was at -11m. He noted that the\nAR's average SPT value from the clay layer in the soil logs was what PND would\nnormally expect from stiff clays but the clay was described as very soft to soft. He asked\nabout more soil borings and a hydrographic survey. (R4, tab 184 at 18918)\n\n       48. On 19 November 2008 Mr. Nunn inquired ofGRS about core drilling by\nWeston that PCI had observed during site investigations. GRS referred him to the AR,\nstating that it had supported a preliminary design analysis by Weston in 2007 for an L&T\npier system at the site. (Ex. A-98; tr. 8/81)\n\n       49. On 20 November 2008, Mr. McNabb informed Mr. Nunn that PND was on\ntrack for a sheet pile order:\n\n              [B]ased on assumptions anticipating the worst case in existing\n              conditions. This is due to the lack ofsoil data with consistent\n              soil parameters and firm vertical control. It's also due to the\n              bathymetry based on a photo that lacks horizontal control.\n\n(R4, tab 185 at 18925) (Emphasis added)\n\n        50. On 22 November 2008 Mr. McNabb informed Mr. Nunn that \"[w]e've been\npouring over the [AR]. .. from the start\" (R4, tab 187 at 18405). Mr. McNabb noted boring\nissues, including that the sand layer location was not clear and \"[t]he clay is described as\n'soft'; the blow counts indicate it's stiff; while the lab results for the cohesion (c) varies\ndrastically\" (id.). He stated that more borings were needed and if reliable information\ncould not be obtained \"now,\" confirmation during construction must be obtained (id.).\nMr. McNabb's reference to \"from the start\" is not clear. There is no deposition testimony\nof his of record and he did not testify at the hearing. The Corps contends without\npersuasive rebuttal, and William Gunderson, PND's Designer of Record, testified at his\ndeposition, that, apart from Mr. Nottingham, PND's design team became involved in the\nproject after contract award. PND did not analyze the contractor's means and methods of\nconstruction. (Ex. A-214 at 12, ex. G-28 at 28, 30-32; gov't br. at 36, PF 100)\n\n\n                                              17\n\f        51. On 23 November 2008 Mr. Pelant expressed concern about a design change\nreducing the cells to 39, 44% fewer than proposed, but increasing steel tonnage and cost\nto the client by about $500,000 (R4, tab 188 at 172448). Mr. McNabb responded:\n\n              The tonnage is high because we don't have solid data on\n              where the requisite sand layer is. During construction, if\n              we're not deep enough and into the sand, we won't meet the\n              req'd safety factors. Plus we don't really know what the\n              cohesion of the clay is. It's probably quite high, which is\n              good, but what if it's not?\n\n(!d. at 172447)\n\n      52. On 24 November 2008 Mr. Pelant expressed concern to Mr. Nunn that the\nSeptember completion date was causing them to rush and the designers to be overly\nconservative, at significant cost (R4, tab 188 at 172446). He responded:\n\n              The Corps knows we are tight on $ and they are working with\n              us.\n\n              We can still work two cranes side-by-side if we need to juice\n              up production ... The Corps will give us some schedule relief,\n              if the boats are not coming until2010, but I don't want more\n              time. I want more Corps/FMS work. Early finish should get\n              us just that.\n\n(R4, tab 188 at 172446)\n\n       53. Mr. McNabb disagreed with Mr. Nunn's 24 November 2008 statement that\none AR BH was \"practically in our Start-Up zone of influence, so we should be very\ncomfortable with the pile design and sheet lengths in this ... area.\" Mr. McNabb referred to\nprior emails \"regarding problems with existing bore logs.\" (R4, tab 189 at 18936)\n\n       54. On 26 November 2008 Mr. McNabb stated that AR problems included:\n\n              1. The cohesive properties of the clay vary widely in the\n              report, from 12 to 34 kpa .... The average SPT ... values in the\n              clay layer range from 4 to ll, ... normally expected from stiff\n              or very stiff clays ( c=50 kpa or larger). Meanwhile, the clay\n              is described in the report as very soft to soft.\n\n\n\n                                              18\n\f              2. No surface elevations for each [BH] location were\n              provided.\n\n              3. Normally, a larger number of [BHs] are provided, typically\n              on a 200-ft. grid.\n\n              I haven't heard back from Andrea Test Laboratories about my\n              inquiries on the report.\n\n(R4, tab 189 at 18934)\n\n        55. Per Mr. Nottingham, PND sought more borings to verify its design. The\nexisting ones showed \"sand, a very hard layer ... a very good foundation\" (tr. 2/49), and it\nwanted to verify that, once it was offshore, it would encounter the same strata. However,\nit learned that it would take four months to obtain more borings and decided to evaluate\nthe strata through the construction response when it drove the sheet piles. (!d.)\n\n       56. At the 3 5% design review on 17-18 December 2008, Mr. Gunderson stated\nthat one reason the open cell concept was right for the project \"is that you have difficult\nsoil conditions here\" and it was easily adaptable (R4, tab 114 at 2; ex. A-12; tr. 8/61-62).\n\n        57. Navy LT Daniel Gutierrez, a civil engineer, was the CO's Representative\n(COR) from just before the 35% design meeting until5 June 2009. Mr. Nunn viewed him\nas the best COR he had worked with in his then 23 years' experience and subsequently.\n(Tr. 2/199, 8/66, 10/6, 7, 16, 67, 74)\n\n       58. PND's DESIGN CALCULATIONS report of January 2009 (R4, tab 116) stated\nthat design soil profiles and properties were based on the AR and that:\n\n              Because of limited geotechnical information available for the\n              site, some significant assumptions are made for the design of\n              the seawall. Most notably, the elevation of the sand layer is\n              assumed to be 11 m throughout the site ....\n\n\n\n              Fill: The material for the fill/embankment layer has not been\n              determined, but is expected to be granular ....\n\n              Clay: The clay layer is overlain by the fill layer and consists\n              of slightly overconsolidated clays and sandy clays. The\n\n\n\n                                             19\n\f              design soil properties are typical for very soft clays, although\n              the blow counts in the logs indicate much stiffer soils ...\n\n              Sand: The sand layer is overlain by the clay layer. The\n              consistency of the soil, based on the blow counts, is dense to\n              very dense ...\n\n\n\n             It should be noted that there appears to be some\n             inconsistencies in the [AR]. Also, none of the [BH] are within\n             1OOm of the proposed seawall face. Thus, the assumed\n             elevations and soil properties based on the [AR] report may\n             differ significantly from the actual site conditions.\n\n(R4, tab 116 at 10-11) (Emphasis added) Design soil properties included in a table in\nPND's report show the cohesion of clay in its undrained state at 20 kPa, which\ncorresponds to \"Very soft\" clays (R4, tab 2 at 15, tab 116 at 11).\n\n       59. On 1 January 2009 CCI had the Basra \"University Lab\" do BH drilling.\n\"North\" borings were attempted in the area of AR BH No.2 but were not successful.\n\"South\" borings were taken about 10 to 12m past the visual toe of the rip rap slope.\n(R4, tab 192 at 62889; tr. 2/167-69; see ex. A-249) In January 2009 the laboratory\nsubmitted a soil investigation report to the \"SAR Group\" (Basra report) which stated that\nthe purpose was to explore the site's subsoils for foundation design for the new port, and\nthat two BH were drilled on the shore at locations selected by the SAR Group (R4, tab 21\nat 4). The soil strata at the Basra report's BH Nos. 1 and 2 were reported to be as\nfollows:\n\n             1. (BHJ)\n                     1-     The top soil layer which extends to a depth of\n                             5.0m consists of fill material (subbase).\n                    11-     The next layer which extends to the end of\n                             boring consists of dense to very dense, red to\n                             brown, poorly graded and sometimes well\n                             graded sand.\n\n             2. (BH2)\n                    1-      The top soil layer which extends to a depth of\n                             l.Om consists offill material (subbase).\n                    11-     The next layer which extends to a depth of\n                             15. Om consists of clayey silt with trace or a\n\n\n                                            20\n\f                             little ofsand with low plasticity. The\n                             consistency of the upper part of this layer is\n                             soft clay (up to depth 12.5m) and then changed\n                             to stiff clay.\n                     111-   The bearing stratum which appears at a depth of\n                             15.0m and extends to the end of boring\n                             consists of dense to very dense, red to brown,\n                             poorly graded and sometimes well graded\n                              sand.\n\n(R4, tab 21 at 10) (Emphasis added) The distance ofthese apparently \"south\" BHs from\nthose in the AR is unclear.\n\n      60. On 5 January 2009, Jim Bates, a professional engineer and PCI quality control\n(QC) manager (R4, tab 209; tr. 21171), summarized the upper strata in the Basra report's\n\"south\" BH for Messrs. McNabb and Nunn:\n\n              0-1 m, access ramp fill\n\n              1.5-5m, grey very soft silty clay with organic material\n\n              6.5-1 Om, grey to black very soft clayey silt to silty clay\n\n(R4, tab 192 at 62889) (Emphasis added) On 12 January 2009 he reiterated that the clay\nwas described as \"very soft\" (R4, tab 196 at 23955).\n\n       61. On 12 January 2009 Hal Dreyer, president ofPCI's subcontractor\nGunderboom, Inc., of Anchorage, Alaska, conveyed his concern to CCI's Mr. Hutton that\nMr. Nunn had underestimated the project work and time (R4, tab 197). Among other\nthings, he noted that the river had \"extreme sedimentation\" (id. at 176333). Gunderboom\nwas owned by several people, including Messrs. Dreyer, Gunderson and Nottingham.\nMr. Dreyer had considerable experience successfully superintending significant open cell\nconstruction projects and Mr. Nottingham trusted his judgment. (Tr. 2/87-89; see R4,\ntab 383 at 161460). Although he tried, Mr. Dreyer was unable to visit the site due to\nadministrative issues (tr. 1/78-79,5/210,9/60-61, 87). Gunderboom's project\nsuperintendent, Dave Robinson, very experienced in open cell construction, sent daily\nreports, which Mr. Dreyer and Kevin Cassidy, Gunderboom's experienced project\nmanager, reviewed. Messrs. Robinson and Cassidy also communicated orally.\nMr. Cassidy visited the site before construction and once after it started. (R4, tab 251 at\n116143; tr. 9/44, 46, 103, 114, 117, 12/22)\n\n\n\n\n                                              21\n\f       62. PCI's time and materials subcontract with Gunderboom, to drive pile and\nbuild the open cell dock structure, was signed effective 20 January 2009. It did not\ninclude building the temporary crane pad and Gunderboom w as not responsible for fill,\nexcept for managing placement of the fill that w ould go into the cells. At the time of\nsubcontracting, Mr. Dreyer did not review the project solicitation or the AR. He had not\nbeen involved with CCI's proposal. (Tr. 9/19-20,30, 42, 81; see R4, tab 383 at 161460)\n\n        63. Throughout the project Mr. Dreyer was highly critical ofPCI, claiming, inter\nalia, that its personnel lacked experience and knowledge and did not appreciate or know\nhow to work with the soil conditions, or understand the need for an engineered fill design\n(R4, tabs 197, 201 at 175506, tab 216 at 20660 ; tab 221 at 8204, tabs 232, 233 at 14427,\ntabs 234, 236 at 36835, tabs 237, 238 at 37316, tabs 239, 248, 250 at 35610, tab 251 at\n116142, tab 272 at 20573-74, tab 370 at 162666, tabs 326, 383 at 161466; tr. 9/47, 50-52,\n57-60, 62-63 , 79). A few of his allegations are set forth below.\n\n        64. Shortly after the 99% design meeting on 10-12 February 2009, construction,\nlate in starting, began (exs. A-19, -20, G-27 at 20).\n\n        65. An open cell schedule must include time for fill to consolidate, which depends\nupon its quality. At a 26 February 2009 contractor meeting, it was noted that, assuming\ncells could be completed in five days each, the project was about two months past the\ncompletion date; it would be necessary to run a double shift; and PCI's schedule did not\nhave an item for \"settlement,\" estimated to take about six weeks. The work plan under\ndiscussion did not include crane pad activities. (R4, tab 203 at 4891 ; tr. 3/54, 9/39)\n\n       66. Although it had contemplated using two 150-ton cranes (see findings 42, 52),\nMr. Nunn concurred with the Corps that CCI's ultimate plan was to construct a crane pad\nabove the tides, 75m into the water, pull a 280-ton crane on to it, and extend the crane' s\narm to open cell one. He acknowledged that PND was not consulted about any crane pad\ndesign prior to work on the beach and there were no design drawings or crane pad\nspecifications at the time, other than a materials requirement. (Tr. 2/258-59) .\n\n       67. On about 25 March 2009 PCI executed a work order for crane pad\nconstruction with subcontractor Ravsan Raheem of Basra. He w as to provide Type C\nmaterial for a crane pad 40m wide and 83m out, at an average depth of 4m. PCI was to\nprovide the design layout. The subcontractor was to push Type C and/or stockpiled\nmaterial over the top of the seawall; grade, w ater and compact it to 95%; grade the pad so\nthe leading edge was 7m above mean lower low water (MIL W); place the fill in .3m lifts;\nand lay geotextile fabric to prevent fill loss . (R4, tab 208)\n\n       68. A 28 March 2009 checklist by QC manager Bates pertained to the work road\nand crane pad, which he called a non-definable work feature. Unclassified fill was to be\n\n\n                                            22\n\fdelivered when work started; the laydown pad would serve as material storage initially;\nthe work road would be built from unclassified material with 7% minimum and 10%\nmaximum fines; material was to be in 30cm lifts and compacted to 95%; water was to be\nadded to get 95% compaction; final grade would be at 6.0 above MLLW; and CCI was\nsetting up an on-site laboratory for sieve and compaction testing. (R4, tab 209)\n\n       69. On 29 March 2009 PCI began placing unclassified fill for its work road and\ncrane pad. It had hired Iraqi subcontractor Noor Alahmed to provide the fill. Mr. Hartley\ndescribed the pad as consisting of imported sand without geosynthetic reinforcement.\n(Ex. A-91 at 36364; see R4, tab 131 at 3/29-31/09, tabs 241 , 253)\n\n        70. Starting on 30 March 2009 the work road and crane pad material suffered\nfrom \"pumping\" silts and weak clays, cracking, and sloughing (R4, tab 17 at B, tab 130,\ntr. 2/172-73, 182-83, 6/48; ex. S-72).\n\n        71. On 1 April2009 QC Bates opined to Mr. Nunn and others:\n\n               As Samuel [Pelant] said, the underlying material is the\n               problem and not the fill. Base[ d] on the borings and my\n               observations, the underlying silt/clay has near zero strength.\n               At first we thought pumping silt was the problem. Now I\n               believe liquefaction occurred due to the placement of fill (i.e.,\n               rapid loading) and vibratory compaction (i.e., earthquake).\n               Most likely it was a combination of the two ....\n\n(R4, tab 212 at 62760)\n                                                     !\n\n               The fill we are bringing in is good. · Let me qualifY that. ...\n               Yesterday (3/31) we received material that wasn't as good as\n               the first two days and we dinged them on price. We also\n               halted the delivery of this material by late morning.\n\n               We constructed the work road as you suggested by making\n               sure the top of the fill was above the high tide line. That is\n               when the problems started. The underlying silty clay/clayey\n               silt [h ]as very little strength (N=2 for this material in the south\n               boring). [3] By placing the fill load on this stuff, I believe we\n               caused liquefaction to occur .... For me this was confirmed by\n               observing the beach in front of the fill this morning at low\n               tide. A classic liquefaction failure with blocks of material\n\n3\n    \"N\" values are the number of blows needed to drive a special sampler 12\" (tr. 6/34).\n\n                                               23\n\f              sloughing and flow of material in the lower portions of the\n              beach. It looked like pictures ofEarthquake Park from 1964 .\n\n              .. .Keep in mind that the south boring had 12.5 m of this loon\n              [poop] (old geotechnical term).\n\n(R4, tab 212 at 62758-59)\n\n       72. The COR was on site shortly after lay down area and work road construction\nbegan. He saw that CCI was using a local borrow pit for fill , rather than an engineered\nfill. He described it as a very gritty, silty soil. (Tr. 10/41, 43-46) Prior to April 2009 CCI\nhad not begun work on an engineered fill for the crane pad; into May 2009 it continued to\nimport fill (R4, tab 132 at 4/2/09 et seq. , tab 134 at 5/2/09 et seq. ; tr. 2/254). The parties\nagree that the supplier was terminated but CCI does not concede that it was due to the\nmaterial's poor quality (gov' t br. at 48, PF 134; app. reply br. at 24). On 7 April 2009\nMr. Gunderson inquired of Mr. Nunn:\n\n              As you have begun placement of the fill out to create a work\n              pad, it would be an appropriate time to do another boring to\n              get a profile of the sediments under the fill you are placing.\n              We are assuming that you are using some fabric under the fill\n              as you move offshore? I know that Hal [Dreyer] has\n              requested an engineered fill where the crane is going to work\n              from. Since we have not heard from PCI can we assume that\n              you are working with your fill contractor on this? ...\n\n(R4, tab 218) Mr. Nunn asked Mr. Gunderson for an engineered fill design. On 12 April\n2009 work road and crane pad activities were suspended to obtain it. (R4, tab 219 at\n10672; app. supp. R4, tab S-2) Gunderboom had sought an engineered fill because it was\nconcerned about the competency of the underlying material, the native soils, and safety\nregarding the 280-ton crane (tr. 9/45-46).\n\n       73. On 10 April 2009 a QC report sketch and photograph showed that, apparently\nbeginning at a 6m elevation, there was \" [c]atastrophic failure (liquefaction) of in-situ silts\nand clays with continual failure of fill from 25 to 50 meters\" (R4, tab 223 at 19954).\n\n        74. On 17 April2009 PCI issued a notice to proceed to Gunderboom. Mr. Dreyer\nstated that his need for appropriate fill to support a 280-ton crane that would be operating\na vibratory hammer, equipment acquisition delays, and work crew composition issues\nwould affect the schedule. (R4, tab 233 at 14427) On 21 April2009 Mr. Gunderson\nstressed the need for a boring where the crane would sit before placing it. Mr. McNabb\nopined that the work pad had to be in place first. (R4, tab 247 at 4566)\n\n\n                                              24\n\f         75. After the slope failure at the end of March 2009, PND was asked to advise\n PCI. Mr. Hartley arrived in Iraq on 25 April2009. As ofthat date CCI was attributi?g\n soil problems to dredge pond leakage and overflow and that the work area was disturbed\n by manmade activities. Mr. Hartley evaluated the soils available for fill for crane pad\n construction by visual classification using ASTM standards. He found sand with 5%\n silica and a small amount of gravel, not unusual for crane pad construction. Rip rap\n would have been better but it was unavailable. He did vane shear tests in the top soil\n surface and used rebar to see how soft the material was. He roughly assessed shear\n strengths for PND's Seattle office to make a soil stability analysis. The field values that\n he obtained were lower than the AR data. (R4, tab 24; tr. 4/18, 20, 42-43, 46-47)\n\n        76. On 27 April 2009 Gunderboom's project manager Cassidy referred to \"the\n mess [PCI] made in the area where the crane [needs] to go\" (R4, tab 251 at 116143).\n Mr. Dreyer worried that PCI might have \"completely ruined the sub base material and\n rendered it useless, which was the concern from the outset\" (id. at 116142).\n\n         77. On 30 April 2009 Mr. Nunn asked for a contract extension due, inter alia, to\n  \"changed conditions\" in the work road location due to excess water and pore pressures\n. from dredge spoils pits (R4, tab 25 at 1). On 3 May 2009 the contractor attributed a\n  \"small mud wave\" to dredge pond seepage (app. supp. R4, tab S-3).\n\n        78. On 1 May 2009 Mr. Hartley wrote that he had recommended to PCI that it get\n BHs out by the cells as soon as possible and that \"we really do no[t] know much about\n soil conditions in these areas\" (R4, tab 259 at 14042).\n\n        79. On 3 May 2009 Mr. Hartley asked for a slope stability analysis under certain\n conditions, seeking an FOS of at least 1.1, preferably 1.3 with the crane loads, based upon\n industry standard for a minimum FOS. On 4 May 2009 Mr. McNabb supplied an\n analysis, showing a 0.99 FOS, indicating failure. (R4, tab 267; tr. 4/175, 178-79, 184-85)\n\n        80. On 7 May 2009 the COR wrote that CCI was behind schedule, stating:\n\n               The main portion of this delay has been caused by an\n               unexpected field condition in placing their crane pad. There\n               is evident soil instability at the 25m mark in the tidal zone that\n               has impeded progress because the fill material begins to\n               creep/slide into the river. The start of pile driving ... has been\n               postponed ... because of the issues with the crane pad and also\n               the pending delivery of the 280Ton Crane from Kuwait.. ..\n\n\n\n\n                                              25\n\f (Ex. A-38 at 23110) He stated that PND' s geotechnical engineer (apparently Mr. Hartley)\n attributed instability to dredging, which increased the deposition of very loose silty\n material with low bearing capacity, and to increased pore water pressure from dredge\n ponds, which increased the effects of liquefaction when compacted or disturbed (id.).\n\n         81. The COR signed an interim satisfactory performance rating dated 7 May 2009\n stating CCI was very cooperative and had effectively tackled \"difficult problems in a\n challenging work environment\" but was behind schedule. Its QC documentation and\n submittals were rated marginal. (R4, tab 30; tr. 101129)\n\n       82. On 13 May 2009 Tim Fisher of PND circulated a crane pad drawing to PND\n and PCI for review (R4, tab 283). CCI has not rebutted the Corps' contention that this\n was PND's first design drawing of record ofthe crane pad.\n\n          83. On 13 May 2009 the COR issued an RFP to CCI under the contract's Changes\n  clause for \"Drainage of Dredge Spoils Ponds\" (R4, tab 32). As Mr. Nunn described it, an\n  Iraqi Ministry of Defense contractor, not on-site during SAR' s visit, was dredging around\n. Pier 3 by the time CCI arrived and dumping the spoils into dredge ponds which came to\n  the edge of CCI' s laydown area and overlapped nearly into the crane pad area. At one\n  time water from an overfilled, breached, dredge pond came near the access road leading\n  to the laydown area. CCI feared flooding. It saw sheet flow across the beach after the\n  tide had gone down and little water \"volcanoes\" below the dikes. It concluded there was\n  no other water source except the dredge pond pits and this 3m of water sitting above its\n  project had adverse effects. (Tr. 21197-98)\n\n          84. On 13 May 2009 the crane arrived in parts (supp. R4, tab S-3 at 5114/09 QC\n report (QCR); see R4, tab 17 at 6). There was no stable crane pad in place at this time or\n later (tr. 10/91-92). Mr. Hartley left the project site on 15 May 2009 (tr. 4/51 ).\n\n        85. The COR prepared a price negotiation memorandum (PNM) dated 22 May\n 2009 about the alleged Pier 3 dredge spoils pond problem. The proposed change was to\n allow CCI to procure pumps to drain excess water from the ponds to relieve excess pore\n water pressure and permit compaction and stabilization of the Pier 1 fill material.\n (Ex. A-41) The PNM stated:\n\n               The crane pad for the construction of Open cell one appears to\n               [rest] on top of a very fine layer of sandy-clay, which is\n               transmitting a flow of water at a greater rate then [sic] other\n               locations alorig the water front... This water is leading to an\n               increase of instability of the shore line at 25m and causing the\n               fill material to creep and slide into the river.\n\n\n\n                                             26\n\f(Ex. A-41 at 52177) The proposed $21,250.37amount included overhead and profit at\n19% and 17.5% (id. at 52178). CCI alleges, without contradiction, that these were the\nrates to which the Corps had agreed for its options 1 through 6 proposals (app. br. at 27).\n\n        86. At some point prior to 23 May 2009, CCI decided to construct six temporary\nshoring cells. In its request for equitable adjustment (REA) (below), CCI attributed the\ndecision to a need to protect soils in the construction zone from continuing silt deposits\nfrom dredging. It stated that dredging and dredge pond seepage had left the soils weaker\nand more slippery than expected. (R4, tab 17 at 6) Mr. Nunn described dredges dumping\nin front of the project instead of south of the border where they were supposed to go,\nresulting in \"loads and loads\" of slime, but stated that the major problem was at the dense\nsand level and concerned efforts to try to stabilize the beach (tr. 2/276-77).\n\n       87. On 1 June 2009 CCI hired John Smithson, an experienced superintendent,\nwith open cell and schedule experience, to be its on-site representative, but left PCI in\ncharge of project management (ex. A-53 ; tr. 1/87-88, 5/107-08, 110-11 , 114-15, 178).\n\n       88. Effective 1 June 2009, bilateral Modification (Mod.) No. P00006 issued, at the\nfirm fixed-price of$21,250.37, for the dredge pond work. It increased the contract price\nto $44,923 ,615.70; kept the 27 September 2009 completion date; and included CCI's\nrelease of the government \"from any and all liability under this contract for further\nequitable adjustments attributable to changes resulting from this modification.\"\n(R4, tab 9 at 2) The Corps has not raised any release defense in this appeal.\n\n       89. Full work on the crane pad began on 3 June 2009, but on 8 June a mud wave\ndeveloped in the pad, sections of the pad slid into the water and the whole pad came apart\n(supp. R4, tab S-4).\n\n       90. On 30 May 2009 the COR had issued a letter of concern to CCI about\nschedule and on 10 June he sought a recovery plan. As of 13 June 2009, inability to build\na crane pad was stopping work in the field. (Ex. f\\ -49 at 11283; tr. 101109-1 0) At some\npoint in June 2009, COR Gutierrez left the project. Kenneth Bright, a supervisory civil\nengineer with the Corps, succeeded him. (See exs. A-48, -49)\n\n       91. The crane was moved onto the pad on about 14 June 2009. On about 21 June\na large mud wave developed and there was a 75m failure in the fill. The fill created\nshelves separated by large tension cracks and the crane pad suffered displacement.\nThrough 21 July 2009 CCI continued to encounter problems with sloughing clay, tension\ncracks, a mud wave and sheared geogrid. (R4, tab 17, ex. Kat 1, ex. L at 1; supp. R4,\ntab S-4, 6/21/09 QCR at 1-2, tab S-5 , 7115/09 QCR at 1, 7116/09 QCR et seq.)\n\n\n\n\n                                             27\n\f        92. In its REA, CCI claimed that another change to its original design caused by\ndiffering site conditions was the construction of \"Circle Cell No. 1,\" or the \"Single Cell\nCrane Pad.\" It was to sit behind and between two temporary shoring cells to protect and\nsupport the beach soils upon which the crane would rest. (R4, tab 17 at 10)\n\n       93. CCI continued into July 2009 to attribute crane pad failures to dredge ponds\nand the discharge and deposit of dredged materials-soft, loose, weak sediments (R4,\ntab 17, ex. P at 2; supp. R4, tab S-4, 6/24/09 QCR at 1; 6/25/09 QCR at 2; ex. A-65).\n\n       94. On 29 June 2009 Mr. Nunn opined to the COR that the dredge spoil dumping\nwas a changed condition. He alleged that, while CCI was well aware of dredging in the\nwaterway and, on a different project, he had been responsible for dredging the North Port,\nthe material had not been dumped back into the waterway in front of the Iraqi Navy Port;\nthe Corps should have alerted offerors of the dredge spoil issues during the solicitation\nphase; and CCI saw the conditions only after mobilization and 99% design completion,\nduring pre-construction activities. (Ex. A-58 at 8867-68)\n\n       95. In June 2009, PCI and PND continued to exchange emails about the need for\nmore BHs (e.g., R4, tab 311 at 18628 (\"plan for confirmation [BHs] , reflecting the\ncurrent access plans,\" \"there is only one old Andrea lab [BH] in the vicinity of our current\nwork, and PND had taken exception to the reliability of that data\")).\n\n         96. On 3 July 2009 Mr. Nunn notified the COR of two alleged changed\nconditions, again pertaining to dredge spoil deposits and dredge pond seepage affecting\nthe fill and crane pad (ex. A-64 at 22155).\n\n        97. Initially CCI was doing visual materials testing that was not certified or\nverified by an appropriate entity. Eventually it had Basra State University do on-site and\noff-site testing. CCI did not establish a Corps-approved on-site laboratory until late June,\nearly July 2009, after COR Bright's arrival. (Tr. 11 /35, 43)\n\n       98. On 6 July 2009 CCI's Mr. Smithson commented on a draft recovery plan:\n\n              [I]t reads that using \"local material\" is the reason the fill\n              failed. I think we should make it clear that the reason was\n              because of the water seepage from the dredge ponds and the\n              dredge spoils sediment are the reason the fill failed. That way\n              we are consistent with what we are saying in our REA ' s.\n\n(R4, tab 353 at 162633)\n\n\n\n\n                                             28\n\f       99. On 7 July 2009 National Laboratory began a site investigation for CCI. On\n8 July PCI discontinued it due to alleged incompetence. (R4, tab 361 at 11877 (\"National\nLab was a joke\"); supp. R4, tab S-5, 7/7-7/8/09 QCRs at 1).\n\n      100. On 9 July 2009 the area in front ofthe crane and parts of the access road\ndropped about 15cm with a massive mud wave forming in the temporary and circle cells.\nCell movement was observed. (Supp. R4, tab S-5 , 7/9/09 QCR at 1-2)\n\n        101. On 14 July 2009 CCI gave another notice of changed conditions pertaining to\n(1) high water levels from the Pier 3 contractor's dredge ponds being over-filled and\nraising the water table on and adjacent to CCI's work area, allowing water to flow around\nand under its work site, and (2) dumped dredge spoils resulting in unstable sediments\nbeing deposited onto CCI's work area (ex. A-86 at 15239).\n\n     102. At least as of 14 July 2009 Mr. Smithson was highly critical ofPCI's project\nmanagement (see R4, tab 370 at 162666).\n\n        103. The COR' s 16 July 2009 letter of concern sought a revised schedule, upon\nthreat of an interim unsatisfactory evaluation, and a recovery plan (ex. A-82).\n\n         104. On 19 July 2009 Bradley West, president of West Construction Company,\nInc. (West), issued a recovery plan based upon marine floating gear, including barges, to\ninstall the sheet pile. West had extensive experience in open cell construction using\nmarine and land-based equipment. (Ex. A-87 at 36425-26) Most of Mr. West's open cell\nprojects were land-based and involved crane pad installation. None used geogrid, had an\nengineer review constructability, or had engineer drawings. However, he had never used\na 280-ton crane. (Tr. 3/7-8, 82) In about August 2009, PCI and West entered into a\ncost-plus-fixed-fee subcontract (see ex. G-18 at 12; tr. 3/43 , 75-76). On 20 July 2009\nCCI submitted a recovery schedule, said to be required by changed conditions due to the\ndredge ponds and spoils. It proposed to use barge-mounted cranes to complete the open\ncell structure from the river. (Ex. A-87 at 36418-24)\n\n        105. On 22 July 2009 CCI submitted to the Corps Mr. Hartley' s 16 July 2009\nreport of conditions during his 25 April-15 May 2009 visit. He had not completed his\nevaluation and had asked CCI for more geotechnical work. (Ex. A-91; tr. 4/60) The\nreport stated that dredging had raised water levels. Cell dikes appeared to consist of silty\nclay soils. He saw water impoundment in three dredge spoil containment cells that\ncaused seepage into the underlying soil, including into the near shore mudflats, that would\nincrease water content and decrease shear strength in the near shore area where fill\nplacemynt had resulted in instability. Mr. Hartley opined that dredging also affected\nsettlement and stability of the construction fill on the mudflats:\n\n\n\n                                            29\n\f              The dredging operation is less than 30m from the north end\n              of the project site. Attempts to obtain shear strength on the\n              surface soils were unsuccessful (undrained shear strength of\n              0.0). A hand-dug hole of0.5 min depth was excavated to\n              attempt additional vane shear strength testing. Soils are so\n              soft in this area that a laborer became stuck up to his knees\n              when attempting to dig into the mudflats. Once the hole was\n              dug undrained shear strength measurements were obtained\n              from vane shear testing and resulted in [low] shear\n              strengths ... less than a third of the value[ in the AR]. A 3 m\n              rebar was also pushed into the ground at this location with\n              little resistance. [Emphasis added]\n\n(Ex. A-91 at 36367) He said that unconsolidated silts and clays with very low shear\nstrength were distributed into the water and deposited in the construction area and that\nslope instability had occurred in the immediate vicinity of the dredge operations. He also\nreported PND's contemporaneous field shear strength assessment, which used data from\nthe AR and Basra reports and his April2009 shallow vane shear tests . PND concluded\nthat the AR indicated an FOS of3.25 at 1m fill depth, but PND found 0.94; at 3m, the\ncomparison was 1.97 to 0.54; and at 5m, it was 1.68 to 0.41. Mr. Hartley stated that the\ncontractor could place a very thin fill lift of about 0.5m but there was a small mud wave\nin front of fill operations and some tension cracks as fill thickness increased, confirmation\nthat near-surface shear strengths were limited. (!d. at 36364, 36369)\n\n       106. On 23 July 2009 the COR approved CCI's recovery plan, noting that the\ngovernment did not consider it to involve acceleration or differing or changed site\nconditions (ex. A-93 at 36392-93; see R4, tab 376).\n\n       107. Navy LT David Daigle (Lieutenant Commander by the hearing) became\ninvolved in the project about the end of July 2009 . On 9 September 2009 he succeeded\nMr. Bright as COR. (R4, tab 61 ; tr. 101131 , 133, 135, 137)\n\n        108. On 25 July 2009 PCI terminated Gunder boom for alleged default. Resulting\nlitigation was settled. (See R4, tabs 379, 383 ; tr. 3/81, 5/211 , 9/76-78, 88)\n\n      109. On 1 August 2009 Gunderboom' s Mr. Dreyer asserted, inter alia, that project\nproblems were due to PCI's failure to understand the soils issues:\n\n                     Some four months into a six-month project the\n              construction of the first Open Cell™ still has not begun due to\n              PCI's inability to solve geotechnical problems, which were\n              apparent to observers on day one. For example, ever since\n\n\n                                             30\n\f              viewing the site photographs when we met to discuss this\n              project in PND 's offices in Seattle, Kevin and I have been\n              concerned about the inter-tidal and offshore sediments. I am\n              sure you will recall our extensive discussions about how\n              unusual it was to see only the very top gun assembly from a\n              Russian Navy Missile launcher vessel sticking out of the muck\n              in the middle ofthejob site, meaning that there is an entire\n              vessel in that soup .... [Emphasis added]\n\n                     ... [O]n site we observed a hopper dredge operation,\n              which may have been depositing fine silt at the project site for\n              many years. This may have contributed to the geotechnical\n              problems PCI has encountered. We are not privy to what\n              precise geotechnical investigations may have been done prior\n              to contracting to design and construct this project. ...\n\n(R4, tab 383 at 161466)\n\n       110. In August 2009 the National Center for Construction Labs. & Researches,\nBasrah Construction Laboratory, apparently the \"National Lab\" CCI hired in July 2009,\nreported upon its investigation. The log of a boring taken at a location from which the\n280-foot crane was visible shows 2m of fill on top and two layers of clay beneath the fill ,\nwith the first 9m described as \"Very soft to soft gray lean to fat CLAY\" and the second\n2.5 mas \"Hard brown lean CLAY.\" (R4, tab 382 at 16352; tr. 61133-36, 138)\n\n         111. CCI submitted an REA in August 2009 for $20,905 ,039.53 and an extension\nbased upon changed or Type II differing site conditions and acceleration. It stated that\nPCI was familiar with the specific project region and that post-award information,\nincluding site re-inspection, had not altered PND' s original opinion that beach soil\nconditions were stable enough to construct the open cells and use heavy equipment,\nincluding a 280-ton crane. The REA alleged that there was no indication that soils within\nthe construction zone had extremely low shear strength; were subject to substantial silting\nfrom dredge spoils; and would make building a work road and crane pad commercially\nimpracticable, if not impossible. It stated that CCI knew that tidal action affected the\nwater table in the naval base's lower reaches, but alleged that, almost immediately, it had\nproblems due to unexpected concentrations of silt and weak clays. It tried compaction,\nlifts, and smaller, lighter equipment, but the pad continued to slough and crack. It stated\nthat some cells were to have been temporary enforcement of the crane pad embankment,\nbut they had to be permanent, due to the changed conditions relating to the dredge spoil\nsediment and dredge pond seepage. (R4, tab 17 at 1-5, 21)\n\n\n\n\n                                             31\n\f        112. Bilateral Mod. No. P00007, effective 28 August 2009, extended the contract\ncompletion date to 1 March 2010; the price remained $44,923,615.70. It stated that it was\nto facilitate authorizations and did not affect any REAs, claims or the construction\ncompletion date. (R4, tab 10)\n\n        113. In August to early October 2009, largely in Dubai, CCI and West engaged in\nequipment procurement efforts to implement the recovery plan (R4, tab 16 at 18, tab 48 at\n1, 66, 67, 73, 74, 80, 81).\n\n       114. On 14 September 2009 the COR issued a fifth letter of concern and GRS\nissued an interim unsatisfactory performance evaluation. CCI disputed it but admitted it\nwould not be able to meet its recovery schedule. (R4, tabs 68-71; ex.A-151 at 6114-15)\n\n        115. MAJ Gerald Himes held a master's degree in civil engineering but was not a\ngeotechnical engineer. In late July-August 2009, LT Daigle became COR and Mr. Bright\nthe alternate. By late August Lt. Daigle and MAJ Himes were doing the contract\nadministration. MAJ Himes visited the site in August 2009 and saw what he described as\nCCI's construction method of pushing fill and whatever was underneath it into the water\n(see also tr. 10/46-47 (COR Gutierrez's description of fill dumping and pushing, or\npulling sediment out into the shoreline)). When CCI submitted its REA, MAJ Himes\ncoordinated the government's technical support, including from ERDC, which gave him a\ndraft report on about 3 September 2009. (Ex. A-126 at 2727, ex. A-135 at 33499; tr.\n91131, 134-35, 137-38, 145-50, 162-63, 179, 200-01, 243-44, 11162-63, 167)\n\n         116. In September 2009 former COR Gutierrez commented to GRS upon the\nREA. He denied a contention by CCI that he had stated that a change order was\nappropriate and alleged several reasons why it was not. He also stated that \"[o]n\nnumerous site visits it was confirmed that there was quite a[ n] interesting phenomenon\noccurring at the 25m near shore line, this is undeniable\" and that \"the problem started and\nis tied to an unforeseen sight [sic] condition.\" (Ex. A-135 at 33494, 33496) He was\nadopting CCI's unforeseen site condition vocabulary but believed contemporaneously that\nits problems were tied to such a condition (tr. 10/122).\n\n        117. On 18 September 2009 ERDC issued its complete report (ERDC report) on\nthe question of whether the Corps-furnished documents for proposals were sufficient to\npredict the crane pad construction difficulties (R4, tab 108 at 1). Referring to the AR and\nBH logs, ERDC stated that \"[c]lays possessing a soft to very soft consistency pose a\nsignificant challenge to any design that requires them to carry any additional loads\" (id. at\n2). Addressing soil strength, ERDC concluded that the AR had not reported the results of\nunconsolidated undrained triaxial (UU) compression tests in the best manner, but it had\nnoted that laboratory vane shear equipment had been used to obtain the undrained shear\nstrength because of high disturbance in all samplers that extruded from Shelby tubes of\n\n\n                                             32\n\fthe soft clay layer. Also, the soil exuded between the fingers when squeezed, which\ncould be described as very soft to soft sandy clayey soil, and the laboratory vane range\nwas within the range for soils with soft to very soft consistency. ERDC interpreted the\nAR to mean that UU tests were to be discounted because of the high degree of\ndisturbance and that the laboratory hand vane tester gave the most reliable results. It\nadopted the vane test data as the basis for undrained shear strengths in its stability\nanalysis. The results ofERDC' s crane pad slope stability analyses, based only upon the\ngeotechnical information the Corps had made available to proposers, were that stability\ndecreased with increasing fill height; the crane pad would be stable for a fill height of 1m,\nmarginally stable for a fill height of 3m, and unstable for a fill height of Sm. ERDC\nstated that PND's 16 July 2009 slope stability analysis indicated that the crane pad would\nbe stable for fill heights up to at least 5m, but noted that the strength of the clay layer in\nPND' s analysis was determined from the UU laboratory tests taken from the highly\ndisturbed samples that the AR had warned against using. (!d. at 2-6) ERDC concluded,\ninter alia, that the \"very soft to soft\" consistency of the foundation clays described in the\nAR should have served notice that dock construction and long-term performance were\ncauses for concern; the high level of disturbance in the soil samples was a direct result of\nthe very soft to soft clay consistency and caused significant uncertainty in determining\nshear strength for slope stability analysis; it was certain that the clay consistency was very\nsoft to soft; and lack of information regarding which samples were tested in the lab vane\ntests or how many tests were performed increased uncertainty (id. at 6-7).\n\n       118. The CO denied CCI's REA on 30 September 2009, summarizing in part:\n\n              The conditions ... were both known and what would typically\n              be found in a sediment laden tidal estuary.... Soil borings\n              indicated that the surface and subsurface soils at the site\n              consisted of unconfined very soft sandy silty clayey mud.\n              Whether it arrived as additional dredged material or as\n              naturally occurring sedimentation; the fact that the soil was\n              saturated silty mud was known or should have been known to\n              an experienced marine contractor. The [AR]. .. put the\n              contractor on notice that the soils at the project site were\n              unstable and subject to soil movement under pressure ....\n\n(R4, tab 19 at 7) She noted that Mr. Hartley called the area a \"mudflat\" (id. at 8).\n\n       119. CCI and West had considerable difficulties procuring barges, cranes and\nsome equipment (R4, tab 16 at 14, tabs 48, 51 at 1, tabs 52, 55, 56, 58, 64, 65 at 2, tab 77;\nex. A-163 at 143973 ; tr. 1/93-95, 3/14-20, 63).\n\n\n\n\n                                             33\n\f       120. On 2 October 2009 Mr. West notified Mr. Burke and the COR of an alleged\nunanticipated need to install wick drains (R4, tab 80 at 1). Mr. West acknowledged that\nusing wick drains to consolidate fill was common, although he had not used them in\nAlaska. He had a \"gut feeling\" they would be necessary (tr. 3/53). During his direct\ntestimony Mr. Hartley, who was not involved in the original project design, stated that he\nhad recommended that wick drains be installed for soil strengthening based upon his\nreview of the AR and the unstable site conditions (tr. 4/65 , 67-68).\n\n       121. Mr. Hartley returned to the site in October 2009 with more sophisticated\nvane shear equipment that would yield more accurate values . He left at the end of\nOctober. His investigation pertained to the crane pad and open cell design. (Tr. 4/60-64,\n69) As of 8 October 2009 CCI was again rebuilding the crane pad. On 11 and\n12 October 2009 Mr. Hartley performed field shear strength tests at low tide. (App. supp.\nR4, tab S-8 at 10/8/09 QCR at 2, 10/11 , 10/12/09 QCRs at 1)\n\n       122. Barges, tugs and cranes arrived on about 18 October, and 1 and 13 November\n2009 (see R4, tab 420 at 29370, 29371; app. supp. R4, tab S-8 at 10/18/09 QCR, tab S-9\nat 1111, 11113, and 11115/09 QCRs).\n\n       123 . On 3 November 2009 GRS' on site Iraqi engineer reported to the COR that\nthere had been a \"big subsidence shear failure (earth collapse)\" between the north and\nsouth cells (ex. A-189 at 5899; tr. 10/156). The 3 November 2009 QCR reported that the\n\"crack and settlement on the beach a day earlier turned into a significant slide of the\nbeach\" (app. supp. R4, tab S-9 at 1113/09 QCR at 1).\n\n        124. On 5 November 2009 Mr. Smithson asserted changed conditions to the CO\nbased upon \"a catastrophic failure of the beach fill\" (R4, tab 93 at 1). He disputed prior\nCorps contentions that fill rate, compaction, and moisture content had contributed to\nfailures and alleged that the ERDC report had stated, based upon the AR, that a stable 3m\nfill could be placed, but CCI's failed fill never reached 3m. He stated that the\n2 November 2009 failure occurred when the fill was at about 2m. (Tr. 5/147-48)\n\n        125. On 18 November 2009 CCI asked the CO for financial relief and for about\n$3M for steel and cargo costs to build north and south open cells on the basis that\ndiffering/changed conditions made it impossible to proceed with its original seawall\ndesign. She responded that her REA determination was unchanged. Although noting that\nCCI was over 57 days past the construction completion date, she agreed to a 2-week\nbilling cycle and partial release and reduction of retainage. (R4, tabs 89, 90)\n\n        126. CCI hired John Snelgrove on 2 November 2009 to lead its project efforts\nwhen Mr. Smithson was unavailable. Messrs. Smithson, Snelgrove and PND were\ncritical ofPCI. (R4, tabs 416-17, 419 ; tr. 11134-35 ; see also R4, tab 420 at 29369) (\"PCI\n\n\n                                             34\n\fhas no clue about any of it as history has shown\" .... \"I agree with that, they obviously are\nnot dirt movers, or contractors as far as that goes\"). However, Mr. West thought PCI\n\"had a good grip on the mechanics of running a construction job\" (tr. 3/79).\n\n        127. Mr. Burke was asked to leave CCI because the project caused parent BBNC\nsignificant financial strain; he left in December 2009. That month CCI also terminated\nPCI's contract and assumed West's contract. (Tr. 1/50, 104,3/77-78, 51194-95)\n\n      128. It seems undisputed that CCI completed the project by an extended June\n2010 due date. In April 2011 it was nominated by the Associated General Contractors of\nAmerica for International Construction Project of the Year and won (tr. 3/38).\n\n         129. CCI submitted a certified CDA claim dated 8 February 2010 to the CO for\n$35,125,036 and a contract extension to 30 June 20 l 0 and asked that its interim\nperformance rating be changed from unsatisfactory to satisfactory. The CO received the\nclaim on 26 February 2010. (R4, tabs 2, 16) CCI incorporated its REA and added a Type\nI differing site conditions contention, to which it narrowed its claim at the hearing (R4,\ntab 16 at 1 n.1, 27-34; tr. 6/31). CCI claimed that it never received notice that the soils\nunder the crane pad could not support the heavy equipment indispensable to driving sheet\npile. Rather, the AR had indicated that the top 2m of soil was consistent with medium to\nstiff soils. Also, CCI had had limited site access prior to its proposal and no chance, or\nneed, based upon the Corps' representations, to conduct a detailed pre-proposal technical\nanalysis. CCI contended that its post-award geotechnical analyses were not to confirm\nthe AR's findings and whether the top 3m of soil were stable enough to support heavy\nequipment, but to confirm the depths to which sheet pile must be driven. CCI contended\nthat all claimed costs would have been avoided if the Corps had performed a timely,\nreasonable geotechnical investigation, rather than instructing potential contractors to rely\nupon an outdated, inaccurate AR. It asserted that, during design, PND had properly\nfocused upon the location of the sheet piles rather than the access road. CCI stated that\nconsiderable attention was mistakenly focused upon dredge ponds as responsible for\n\"causing weak soils to become even weaker\" (R4, tab 16 at 6), but it still alleged that\ndredging was \"the root cause\" of the problems (id. at 24 ). In support of its claim, CCI\nrelied upon Mr. Hartley' s 4 February 2010 expert report, below.\n\n        130. CCI's claim and incorporated REA did not allege that the government had\nacted in bad faith or to deprive CCI of its contract value, and did not include operative\nfacts that were in any respect tantamount to a bad faith claim. It also did not allege\ncontract breach, although CCI averred in its complaint that its claim had so alleged\n(compl. ~ 73).\n\n      131. A new CO was appointed in March-April2010. By final decision of9 July\n2010 she denied CCI' s claim. On 6 August 2010 it timely appealed to the Board. CCI\n\n\n                                             35\n\fultimately increased its claim to $40,064,759. (R4, tab 2; ex. A-232 at 1, ex. A-233 at 1,\nex. A-259 at 16, ex. A-260 at 208, ex. G-18 at 3; tr. 5/ 157, 6/254)\n\n                      Appellant' s Expert Hartley' s Direct Evidence\n\n        132. Mr. Hartley has a master' s degree in geotechnical engineering and is a\nlicensed civil engineer. He was admitted without objection as an expert in civil and\ngeotechnical engineering. He is very familiar with open cell projects and, prior to the one\nat issue, had done geotechnical assessments for them. (Tr. 4/9, 13, 15-16) He prepared\nan expert report dated 4 February 2010 in response to the Corps' rejection ofCCI's REA\n(ex. A-214 at 1). It reflects counsels' input and contains legal conclusions that we do not\naccept as expert evidence, as is true of any legal conclusions by other experts in this\nappeal. Mr. Hartley' s report acknowledged that \" [w]e have not discussed with the\nContractor the interpretation procedures they used in the evaluation of construction means\nand methods for the project\" (id. at 3). No reason is given for this omission. His report\nmerely assumed, without attribution, that CCI relied upon the AR' s subsurface\ninformation in submitting its proposal.\n\n       133. Among other things, Mr. Hartley opined that the AR contained conflicting\ninformation on soil strength and inaccurate data reporting, including discrepancies\nbetween soil consistency descriptions and blow counts. He stated that the reported data,\ninterpreted logically, would lead a contractor to believe that a shore-based fill operation\ncould be achieved with some containment from armor, cells, geotextile wraps, super sacks\nand other means. (Ex. A-214 at 3)\n\n        134. Mr. Hartley cited Corps guidelines for geotechnical reports and interpretation\nof field biow count data obtained in an SPT for the proposition that adjustments should be\nmade to raw field blow counts to provide a normalized data set prior to determining soil\nconsistency and properties. After applying such \"corrections\" to the AR blow counts,\nPND determined that the silty clay encountered from the surface to a depth of 6.5m in BH\nNo. 2 was a medium silty clay rather than a very soft to soft silty clay and the silty clay\nfrom the surface to a depth of3.5m in BH No.3 was a stiff silty clay rather than a very\nsoft to soft silty clay. The Basra report' s BH No.2 indicated that clayey silt ranged from\nvery soft to stiff. Mr. Hartley reported that PND's October 2009 field vane sheer testing\nyielded strength measurements that were, on average, half the value of the AR' s\nlaboratory vane shear strength tests. However, soil conditions, based upon split spoon\nblow counts, appeared to result in shear strengths 2 to 6 times higher than the AR' s\nlaboratory vane shear strengths and indicated that the shear strength was much higher\nthan values in the ERDC report. Mr. Hartley denied that his description of the project\narea as a \"mudflat\" implied that it was obviously unstable and stated that PND had\nconstructed many fill and armor rock projects on riverine and marine mudflats using\nshore-side construction techniques similar to those used by CCI. (Ex. A-214 at 5, 10, 13)\n\n\n                                            36\n\f        135. Mr. Hartley stated that unconsolidated silts and clays from dredging were\ndeposited along the project, yielding very low shear strengths in the upper silt/clay\nformation. While the USAID report indicated that some dredge side casting had occurred\nnear the Old Port, it had not given enough information to analyze quantities, locations, or\nsite and construction impact. He concluded that it was hard to ascertain actual geological\nsite conditions from the AR due to its conflicting statements, data reported, and lack of\ndata that a prudent geological engineer would normally include. (Ex. A-214 at 13-16)\n\n       136. At the hearing Mr. Hartley opined that PND's recommendations for crane\npad stabilization should have worked based upon the AR. Regardless of whether one\nused the AR's laboratory vane shears or the blow count calculated vane shears, they were\nsubstantially higher than field conditions. Shear strength was much lower than anything\ndescribed in the AR. PCI did not follow all ofPND's recommendations but, according to\nMr. Hartley, even if it had, the crane pad would not have stabilized. (Tr. 4/40-41, 105)\n\n        137. Mr. Hartley first testified that, based upon the AR, wick drains might or\nmight not have been called for in the original project design; either way was appropriate\n(tr. 4/68-69). He later testified that they were due to the differing site conditions and the\nneed to change to marine-side construction (tr. 41119-21).\n\n        138. In Mr. Hartley's opinion, field testing data typically provides a more accurate\npicture of soil conditions than lab testing data, because when a sample is transported there\nis a potential for disturbance and there is such a potential with very soft or soft soils when\nShelby tubes used in laboratory vane shear testing are cut into sections. He noted:\n\n              [E]ven in the [AR] they indicated that they had problems\n              taking the sample, extruding the sample out of the Shelby\n              tube. And that 's because they were having issues with soft\n              material. [Emphasis added]\n\n(Tr. 4/73)\n\n        139. When asked if descriptors were superior to or subordinate to blow counts in\ninterpreting BH data, Mr. Hartley responded: \"It's really another piece of information\nthat's provided\" (tr. 4/88). He added that there was a fairly large discrepancy in the AR\ndata between the blow counts in the upper 7m of soil and the descriptors and, in that case,\nconsidering sample transportation and laboratory work, the blow counts would better\ndescribe soil consistency at the site (tr. 4/88-89).\n\n      140. Apparently using AR blow counts adjusted as he earlier described,\nMr. Hartley concluded that the soil should have been stable enough to support a crane pad\n\n\n                                              37\n\fand land-based construction. He opined that, based upon the ERDC report, and his own\nanalysis, an umeinforced crane pad should have been stable at up to 3m of fill height.\n(Ex. A-214 at last pg.; tr. 4/89-93, 96-98, 100, 105, 108)\n\n                   Appellant's Expert Enamul Hoque's Direct Evidence\n\n       141. Enamul Hoque, president of Hoque & Associates, Inc. of Phoenix, Arizona,\nhas a master's degree in civil engineering. He is a licensed civil engineer with extensive\nexperience in geotechnical engineering, having completed thousands of geotechnical\ninvestigations, including of slope failures. He was admitted without objection as a civil\nengineering and geotechnical expert. (Ex. A-236; tr. 5/6-1 0) He supplied an expert\nreport dated 3 September 2010 (ex. A-225).\n\n       142. Mr. Hoque did not read the entire RFP or the contract. He focused upon the\nAR and USAID reports and the answers to questions 11 and 42. He was not present\nduring the crane pad failures but relied upon what CCI told him concerning pad\ncomposition, fill height and crane placement. Mr. Hoque arrived on site on 22 February\n2010 and was there for several weeks. Most of his testing was outside the project so that\nit covered undisturbed areas. He opined that he could about replicate conditions at the\ntime of failure because, based upon his observations and testing, there was a monotonous\ngeology that did not change much--an upper soft soil and competent soil below. He\nperformed dilatancy testing by holding soil in his hands in the field. It was falling\nthrough his fingers, meaning it was very soft and not as depicted in the AR blow counts in\nhis opinion. (Ex. A-225 at 1; tr. 5/11-13,18,20,30-31,34-35, 60-61 , 76,83, 87-90)\n\n        143. Mr. Hoque stated that the moisture content at which a soil starts behaving as\na liquid is the \"liquid limit\" (LL). If that content is at or above LL, the soil will behave\nlike a viscous fluid. Regarding BH No.2, the AR' s \"Summary of Test Results,\" at\nsample Nos. 1 and 3, reported the LL at 48% and 51%. Mr. Hoque found the moisture\ncontent in the field to be about 4 7% up to 70%, essentially liquid. He concluded that, if\nthe AR' s reported moisture content on those two samples were correct, then they had lost\nmoisture during sampling, transportation and handling. He opined that the reported LLs\nand blow counts indicated that the soil should have supported minor construction and\nmost of the equipment. He opined that the cohesion values under the \"Summary of Test\nResults\" for sample Nos. 2 and 4 indicated that the soil would support equipment under\nvirtually all conditions, but cohesion tests in Phoenix yielded much smaller numbers. To\nhim, the AR was, at best, confusing and did not represent actual soil conditions; strength\nvalues were totally different. (AR at next to last pg.; ex. A-225 at 2-3; tr. 5/37-42, 62, 76)\n\n      144. Mr. Hoque opined that the AR excluded vital silt data and that the silt was\n\"abundantly available\" at and/or below the surface throughout the site (ex. A-225 at 4).\n\n\n\n                                              38\n\f       145. In Mr. Hoque's opinion, geotechnical engineers would not make\nrecommendations concerning geotechnical design parameters associated with crane pad\nconstruction and placement of a 280-ton crane on top of it, for a site with competent, stiff\nto hard soil. They would do so when there was soft saturated soil, even if there were a\nmuch smaller crane. Placement of a 6m high fill 1OOm into the shore would require a stiff\nto very stiff soil. (Tr. 5/81-83, 85)\n\n        146. Mr. Hoque would rely upon blow counts as the most reliable representation\nof site conditions and would rely more upon field testing than laboratory testing. In his\nopinion, based upon the AR' s blow counts, there should not have been a failure where the\ncrane pad was attempted. (Tr. 5/24-26)\n\n        147. Part of Mr. Hoque' s work was field observation of surficial geologic site\nconditions using indicator tests described in the ASTM \"Field Identification and\nClassification of Soils.\" Visual soils classification is a recognized and standardized\ntechnique. He acknowledged that his visual classification of the soils as elastic silt\ndiffered from his laboratory's classification of it as clay. Despite his testimony that he\nwould rely more upon field testing, on cross-examination he stated that he deemed visual\nclassification to be an indicator and laboratory classification to be more precise. In his\nopinion, while blow counts were the most reliable factor, visual and laboratory\nclassifications should also be considered and visual classification should not be\ndiscounted. One should look at everything. (Ex. A-225 at 1; tr. 5/48-54, 100-01)\n\n                  Appellant's Expert Tracy J. Lyman' s Direct Evidence\n\n       148. Tracy J. Lyman, senior consultant at Brierley Associates in Denver,\nColorado, submitted an expert report dated 3 January 2011 (ex. A-234; tr. 6/21). He held\na master' s of engineering degree, focusing upon rock and soil engineering, and had been\na geotechnical engineer for 39 years. He held licenses as a professional engineer and\ngeologist. (Tr. 6/5-7) Although the presiding judge sustained the government' s objection\nto CCI's request to admit Mr. Lyman as an expert in design-build contracts and the\nevaluation of bid documents from a reasonable contractor' s perspective, he was admitted\nwithout objection as an expert in geotechnical and soil engineering (tr. 6/12-14).\n\n        149. Mr. Lyman reported that the actual shear strength of the soil was about half\nof that expected based upon the AR and Basra reports. He stated that there might have\nbeen some variability across the Pier 1 area, with weaker soils at the crane access road\nlocation than at the site of the Basra report' s boring 2. He described the ERDC report as\nconcluding, using the AR's most conservative assumptions, that a 3m thick crane access\nroadway fill would be stable, but CCI's experience was starkly different and there was\nsignificantly lower strength in the subsurface soils at the roadway than what was\nanticipated based upon the AR and Basra reports. (Ex. A-234 at 8-1 0; tr. 6/53-56)\n\n\n                                            39\n\f        150. The Lyman report concluded that the dredging activities in close project\nproximity \"most likely produced a thin veneer of highly saturated, unconsolidated, very\nweak soils at and seaward of the intertidal zone ' ground surface\"' and that those soils\nmight have exacerbated crane access road instability (ex. A-234 at 8-9). The dredge\nspoils \"exhibited ' zero' undrained shear strength\" ( id. at 10).\n\n        151. Mr. Lyman concentrated on AR BH Nos. 2 and 3, in the intertidal zone,\nbecause No. 1, up on the land, was not relevant. No.2 was at the location ofthe\ntemporary causeway to be constructed for the crane. In evaluating the BH data he looked\nprimarily at SPT results, the \"N\" values. Blow counts are indicative of clay consistency,\nfor which there is a rigorous industry description system. Blows from an SPT test of 0 up\nto 2 indicate very soft clay; 2 to 4, soft; 4 to 8, medium; 8 to 15, stiff; 15 to 30, very stiff\nand greater than 30, hard. He opined that the AR' s BH log descriptors, which were based\nupon visual classification, did not comport with the rigorous industry system and\ndescribed softer material than the blow counts indicated. He did not agree with the AR' s\ncharacterization of the clay as very soft. (AR, app ' x A, B; tr. 6/33-37, 39, 45 , 70, 76)\n\n       152. Mr. Lyman found nothing in the Basra report to indicate that a contractor\nshould change from land-based construction. He concluded that a blow count of 2 from\nBasra BH No.2, at a depth of9.5m \"was anomalously low\" when compared to blow\ncounts from AR BH Nos. 2 and 3. (Ex. A-234 at 7; tr. 6/45-46, 86, 141-43)\n\n        153. Mr. Lyman considered an acceptable FOS for crane pad stability, once a\nhuman-operated crane were placed upon it and it was operating under a load, to range\nfrom 1.1 to 1.3. The ERDC report' s FOS for a 3m high crane pad was 1.07. Rounding\nthat to 1.1, he opined that a contractor could consider placing a human-operated 280-ton\ncrane onto a crane pad along a shoreline under the conditions the ERDC report described\nbut should not go to any lower safety level. Also, he would look for ways to increase\nstability. (R4, tab 108 at 5, table 3; tr. 6/ 116-18, 120)\n\n        154. Mr. Lyman never visited the project site nor spoke to anyone who was on site\nwhen construction was initiated. He did not see any 2008 project design calculations on\nbehalf of CCI. He did not find any design document related directly to the crane pad, but\nopined that, because it was temporary, a design was not required and would be unusual.\n(Tr. 6/68, 78-79, 81 , 91, 104, 144, 147)\n\n       155. Mr. Lyman was not expert in dredging or sediment transportation but read\nthe USAID report to indicate that, on the project side of the river, erosion would occur\nand, on the other side, sediment deposition would occur (tr. 6/68, 146).\n\n\n\n\n                                              40\n\f       156. Mr. Lyman confirmed that in its January 2009 report, pre-construction, PND\ndescribed the clays' design soil properties as very soft and that CCI did, in fact, encounter\nvery soft clays. He acknowledged that a reasonable contractor should consider all\ninformation in the AR. (Tr. 6/43,71, 80-81)\n\n                Government's Expert Dr. James Apted' s Direct Evidence\n\n        157. Dr. James Apted, employed by WS Atkins International Ltd. and based in\nEngland, is a civil engineer who has specialized in geotechnical engineering for about 3 5\nyears. He obtained a masters ' degree in foundation engineering and a doctorate at the\nImperial College of the University of London, concerning the effects of weathering on the\nproperties of London clay. He is highly experienced in geotechnology and was admitted\nwithout objection as an expert in the area of geotechnical engineering. Following a site\nvisit on 23-25 November 2011 , Dr. Apted submitted his first expert report, dated\nDecember 2011. (Ex. G-16 at 1, 5, 19; tr. 13116-46, 53)\n\n        158. During his visit Dr. Apted saw \"a slightly sandy clayey beach,\" a strip of\n\"more lumpy clay\" and the main foreshore, which had a \"surface of slippery silty clay (or\nmud) with a high degree of sheen\" (ex. G-16 at 19). He considered that the foreshore ' s\ngenerally smooth and sheeny nature was as it would have been in 2008 and typical of\nCCI' s work area. He walked across the slippery clay foreshore but progress was not\npossible within about 1Om because he was getting bogged down into the soft surface. He\nused rebar to probe the upper 2-3m of the foreshore in 3 to 4 places around exposed areas\nsouth and north of the area built by CCI. He was able to push the probe fully into the\nsurface with ease in most places. The river was brown and appeared to be laden with\nsediment. Very soft clay, possibly silty material, was readily apparent. (!d. at 19-21 , 39;\ntr. 13/57-58, 65) It was \"very easy\" for him to determine that the undrained strength of\nthe clay below the foreshore was very low (ex. G-16 at 21). Dr. Apted considered that the\nconditions he observed were not unexpected or atypical for the bottom end of a long river,\ntidal inlet area, or large flat delta, where there was an accumulation of soft sediments and\ngeologically recent materials, as at Umm Qasr (tr. 13/66-67; see ex. G-16 at 24, ~ 6.2.12).\n\n       159. Dr. Apted concluded, among other things that:\n\n              6.2 .3 It appears clear that the soils in the upper 7 to 10 [m] or\n                     so below the foreshore in the area of the new seawall\n                     consist of very soft to soft clay ....\n\n\n\n              6.2.5 From [the AR and Basra] investigations it is considered\n                    that the undrained strength of the upper layer of clay\n\n\n                                              41\n\f                    beneath the site would lie in the range of 10 kPa to 20\n                    kPa, with the possibility of undrained strength values\n                    lower than this. The relatively high SPT N values\n                    reported by the [AR] are clearly an anomalous set of\n                    data indicating a higher undrained strength, but they are\n                    not supported by the descriptions on the [BH] logs, or\n                    the reported vane strengths in the [AR] , or the ... SPT N\n                    values for the University of Basra investigation. In\n                    addition Andrea Laboratories do not seem to rely on\n                    them.\n\n              6.2.6 [PND ' s] vane tests ...gave values of undrained strength\n                    that are below the range of values indicated by Andrea\n                    and University of Basra .. .. [T]he results are not out of\n                    general character with the Andrea and Basra results,\n                    and all the results are commensurate with the\n                    descriptions used in the two reports for the upper\n                    stratum being a very soft clay.\n\n(Ex. G-16 at 23)\n\n        160. Dr. Apted concluded, inter alia, that one reasonably could have foreseen\nfrom the AR that the stratum underlying the site along the foreshore was likely to be very\nsoft or soft clay; it should have been clear that the AR was limited in extent and quality\nand there was a risk of more difficult conditions; and the USAID report conveyed the\nsignificant risk of accumulation of silt and clay from dredging (ex. G-16 at 23-24).\nDr. Apted's overall strong impression from the AR was that one should expect \"pretty\nweak\", very soft, soft-to-medium clay (tr. 131141 ).\n\n\n        161. Dr. Apted opined that Mr. Hartley' s 16 July 2009 stability analysis, while\napplying a low undrained strength to the very near surface soils (upper 3m) in the area of\nthe earthworks, had incorrectly used drained parameters for the remainder of the soft clay\nlayer, which could seriously over estimate the strength of that layer and distort the\nstability analysis (ex. G-16 at 15, 25).\n\n       162. Dr. Apted opined that, regardless that the crane pad was temporary, it had to\nbe designed appropriately; it was key. He opined that the earthworks ' failure was\nconsistent with the ground conditions that could have been expected and with the\noverloading of a layer ofvery soft clay (ex. G-16 at 26; tr. 131176-77). He concluded:\n\n\n\n\n                                             42\n\f              6.2.2 While the actual undrained strength that could have\n                    been identified from the [AR] may not have been as\n                    low as allegedly found by the vane probing carried out\n                    on behalf of CCI, it was sufficiently low to highlight\n                    the risks of instability of constructing earthworks on\n                    the foreshore.\n\n\n\n\n              6.2.5 I consider that the instability that did occur may have\n                    occurred in any case because of the presence of very\n                    soft clay, even if the undrained strength was in the\n                    range of 10 to 20 kPa.\n\n(Ex. G-16 at 28)\n\n                             Mr. Hartley's Rebuttal Evidence\n\n        163. In rebuttal to Dr. Apted, Mr. Hartley prepared a \"Slope Stability Analysis\nSummary\" evaluating FOS'. An FOS of 1 or more represents stability; less than 1,\ninstability. (Ex. A-249 at n.1, at 2, conclusion 3; tr. 4/26-27, 108, 123, 126-28) Based\nupon failure at 25m from the shoreline at no more than 2.5m of fill thickness,\nMr. Hartley's data showed \"conditions were much, much worse than what the [AR] was\nshowing, even at the very most conservative value in the [AR]\" (tr. 41128-29).\n\n                              Mr. Hoque's Rebuttal Evidence\n\n       164. Among other things, in his 27 January 2012 rebuttal report, Mr. Hoque\nasserted that there was no indication that Dr. Apted tried to evaluate the soil's index\nproperties visually and classify it using standardized ASTM procedures (ex. A-241 at 2).\n\n         165. Mr. Hoque stated that the AR did not mention anything about the soft soil's\neffect on foundation performance or construction. He faulted it for not addressing\nbackfill in a marine environment and its complexity, on-site geology, site characteristics\nor past usage that could affect design and construction. He stated that there was no\nreference to saturated very soft and viscous soils at the site in the documents he reviewed\nbut such soil was \"abundantly available at the surface and/or below the surface\nthroughout the site\" (ex. A-241 at 7). He concluded that near surface soils and their\nconditions at the site were materially different than reported in the AR and Apted report\nand that his own findings directly conflicted with the AR, especially in the identification\nof silt and its strength values. (!d. at 2, 5-7)\n\n\n\n                                            43\n\f                  Dr. Apted's Expert Rebuttal and Supplementary Reports\n\n        166. Dr. Apted prepared an expert report dated February 2012, in rebuttal to\nMr. Lyman's 3 January 2011 report, Mr. Hoque' s 3 September 2010 report, and\nMr. Hartley' s expert evaluations (ex. G-19). Dr. Apted concluded, among other things,\nthat there was enough information in the AR and USAID report:\n\n               2.2.9 ... [T]o highlight a significant risk of very soft ground\n                     occurring below the foreshore, to the extent that\n                     unconstrained construction of earthworks over the\n                     foreshore would have been at risk of failure and\n                     disruption.\n\n(Ex. G-19 at 6) He opined that, using a range of FOS that could reasonably be expected\nwhen placing fill over the foreshore, the results clearly demonstrated that earthworks\nfailure could be expected well short of the seawall construction area (id. at 14).\n\n        167. Dr. Apted prepared a supplemental report dated April 2012, after reviewing\nCCI depositions and exhibits and concluding that the fill used, except in the open cells,\nwas general and not selected for its suitability to be placed in or near water (ex. G-23 at 1,\n4-5, 10). Upon review of project information, including manner of fill placement, tide\nlevel, and some heavy rainfall, he concluded that, based upon his experience, it was more\nlikely than not that a water table was established within the fill somewhere between the\nmid and high tide levels. His prior analyses had assumed, conservatively, that the fill was\nentirely dry. He concluded that, while not large, a water table within the fill would reduce\nthe FOS by 5 to 10% and the likelihood of slope failure in light of CCI' s method of\noperation was even more readily apparent than in his prior analysis.

CCI's claim, including the incorporated\nREA, did not allege that the government had acted in bad faith in any respect, or had\nacted with specific intent to injure CCI or to deprive CCI of its contract value, and it did\nnot include operative facts that were in any respect tantamount to a bad faith claim\n(finding 130).\n\n       In sum, we lack jurisdiction to entertain CCI's bad faith allegations because it did\nnot submit such a claim to the CO for decision. 5\n\n                        II. Appellant's Motions to Exclude or Strike\n\n        CCI moved pre-hearing to exclude Dr. Apted' s expert report and related testimony\nto the extent they contained legal conclusions and addressed American construction\nprojects, Corps-administered projects, United States' construction contract requirements,\nor the FAR (app. mot. at 7). The Board reserved its ruling for the hearing, where CCI\nstated that Dr. Apted should not be allowed to testify about other than his technical\ninterpretation of the AR. The government opposed the motion, citing Dr. Apted' s broad\nexperience and expertise in geotechnical engineering, and stated that he would not offer\nlegal conclusions. (Tr. 13/6-8) The presiding judge denied CCI's motion, noting that its\nown expert reports could be interpreted to advance legal conclusions. The judge stated\nthat she would evaluate all of the reports for their geotechnical information and would not\nrely upon them for any legal conclusions. (Tr. 13/9)\n\n       During Dr. Apted ' s testimony, CCI objected that some of the government' s\nquestions concerning fill placement were beyond the scope of his expert qualifications\nand reports. The government disagreed. The judge allowed the examination over CCI ' s\nobjection, but instructed that the focus be upon soil conditions rather than construction\n\n5\n    CCI addressed its interim performance rating only briefly at the hearing. It alleged in\n       briefing that the government gave it \"an improperly issued and facially\n       unsupported interim performance evaluation\" (app. br. at 57) but did not mention\n       its request for a rating change or brief the jurisdictional and other issues involved.\n       Accordingly, we deem the claim' s rating change request to have been abandoned.\n\n                                              46\n\fmethods and stated that CCI could reserve its objection in post-hearing briefing if it so\nchose. (Tr. 13/223-27) In a footnote in its reply brief, in essence a motion to strike, CCI\nrenewed its objection to Dr. Apted's testimony concerning its means and methods of\nconstruction on the grounds that it was outside his area of expertise, patently prejudicial,\nand raised to cloud the issues before the Board (reply br. at 41 n.3 ).\n\n       Regarding each expert's report and testimony, the Board has considered only\nevidence that is within the expert's accepted area of expertise, and not matters that are\nirrelevant to the differing site conditions claim at hand or in effect legal conclusions,\nwhich are not within an expert's province. Lear Siegler Services, Inc., ASBCA No.\n57264, 12-2 BCA ,-r 35,112 at 172,425.\n\n       Accordingly, CCI's motions to exclude and strike are denied except as reflected in\nthe foregoing ruling.\n\n            III. Appellant Has Not Proved A Type I Differing Site Condition\n\n       Appellant must prove the following to establish a Type I differing site condition:\n\n              ( 1) the contract contained positive indications of the\n              conditions at the site; (2) it reasonably interpreted and relied\n              upon the indicated site conditions; (3) the conditions\n              encountered were materially different from those indicated;\n              (4) the conditions encountered were reasonably unforeseeable\n              based upon all the information available at the time of\n              bidding; and (5) its injury was caused solely by the differing\n              site condition.\n\nNova Group, Inc., ASBCA No. 55408, 10-2 BCA ,-r 34,533 at 170,321.

Nonetheless, the RFP\ncontained some indications of site conditions. While said to be \"for information only\"\n(finding 6), the AR described subsoils at the project site and included three BH logs, two\nof which are relevant (findings 8, 9, 10). Borings are the most significant indication of\n\n\n                                             47\n\fsubsurface conditions.

The \"information only\"\ndisclaimer does not shift the risk to CCI that the information might prove to be inaccurate.\nMe tcalf Construction Co., 2014 U.S . App. LEXIS 2515 at *29. Moreover, in response to\nQuestion 11 posed by potential offerors, the government stated that the best soil\ninvestigation data available to it was in the AR and offerors should assume that its data\nwas representative of the site. In response to Question 42, it stated that they should\nassume the three AR borings were representative of the entire site for the purposes of\ndeveloping a proposal, but that additional geotechnical information might be required\nduring project design. (Finding 25)\n\n       The RFP also had information about sedimentation near the site (finding 12). The\nUSAID report, said to be \"for information only\" (finding 25), contained information\nabout site geology, shoaling patterns, and dredging and disposal practices (findings 26-\n28).\n\n           (2)(a) Any Absolute Reliance upon the Andrea and USAID Reports\n                               Would be Unreasonable\n\n       Any absolute reliance upon the AR and USAID reports would be unreasonable. This\nwas a design/build contract. Regardless of the lack of weight of the disclaimers that the AR\nand USAID reports were for \"information only,\" the RFP and contract provided that site\nspecific geotechnical information necessary to design and construct the project was the\ncontractor' s responsibility (finding 6). Thus, CCI was on notice that it had some\nresponsibility for ascertaining the geological conditions that would affect the project.\nHowever, CCI conducted only a minimal pre-proposal site visit with no follow-up\npre-proposal investigations; it disregarded the warnings and advice of its consultant,\nMr. Dyer, that, among other things, project site conditions had not been addressed and its\nproposal price was much too low; and it proceeded to enter into the contract because it\nwanted its \"foot in the door\" in the Middle East in order to secure other business (findings\n15, 17, 18, 21 , 35, 37, 38, 52).\n\n         (2)(b) CCI Has Not Proved that it Relied upon the Indicated Conditions\n\n        The Andrea report had supported a preliminary design analysis by Weston in 2007\nfor an L&T pier system. When the AR was included in the RFP, the RFP contemplated a\ntraditional L&T pier construction, not CCI's open cell design (see findings 20, 21 , 48).\nRegardless of the AR' s suitability for a land-based open cell pier design, there is no\npersuasive evidence that CCI relied upon it or the USAID report in preparing its proposal.\nPrior to contract award Mr. Nottingham did most of the work on behalf ofPND (finding\n22). He testified that CCI relied upon the answers to Questions 11 and 42 because they\nwere the only things available and it was instructed to do so (finding 30). In support of its\n\n\n                                             48\n\freliance contentions, CCI alleges that it was responsible, at Mr. Nottingham's request, for\nposing those questions (app. br. at 75; app. reply br. at 10). However, while the answers\nto Questions 11 and 42 indeed made statements concerning the AR' s representation of\nsite conditions, none of the questions posed on behalf of CCI pertained to geographic site\nconditions and at least Question 42 is attributable to Weston (findings 21 , 24).\n\n       Mr. Nottingham testified that he looked at the AR' s three borings in helping to\nprepare CCI's proposal and relied upon their blow counts, but then acknowledged that\ntheir data was insufficient to determine whether the project could be constructed from the\nland side. He saw inconsistencies between descriptors that the soils were very soft and\nblow count data that indicated \"not a bad\" or a \"pretty good\" soil (finding 23). He noted\nto CCI that the BH were in one location and advised that it seek more information,\nrecognizing that the general information could not be used in any detail. He designed a\none-page concept plan that was incorporated into CCI ' s proposal but CCI has not rebutted\nthe Corps' assertion that the soil conditions and profile shown on his plan did not\ncorrespond to the AR data in the RFP. His concept plan, along with a generic cost\nestimate he made, did not discuss the AR or USAID report or detail any means or\nmethods of construction, such as the crane and crane pad at issue. (Findings 22, 23 , 30)\n\n       CCI has not directed us to any written statement or analysis by Mr. Nottingham, or\nanyone from PND, CCI, or PCI, at the time CCI submitted its proposals, of project site\nconditions that would allow land-based construction, or any contemporaneous written\nexpression of reliance by CCI upon the AR or USAID reports. CCI's proposals did not\ncontain a defined construction plan concerning the earthworks and filling operations or\nany statement of assumed ground or soil conditions. In fact, CCI did not perform any\ngeological testing of the site prior to contract award and recognized that it lacked soils\ndata. (Findings 35, 58)\n\n       Tellingly, for months, continuing through its REA, CCI blamed its pad failures\nupon dredging and dredge spoils ponds, not upon any alleged misplaced reliance upon the\nAR or USAID report (findings 75, 77, 80, 83, 86, 88, 93 , 94, 96, 98, 101 , 104, 105, 109,\n111). In its claim CCI still alleged that dredging was \"the root cause\" of the project\nproblems (finding 129). In his 4 February 2010 expert report, Mr. Hartley still raised\ndredging issues as contributing to the soil conditions encountered (finding 135).\n\n       Mr. Hartley, a PND principal, was not involved at the proposal stage and\nMr. Nottingham did not consult him (finding 32). His 4 February 2010 expert report\nacknowledged that \" (w]e have not discussed with the Contractor the interpretation\nprocedures they used in the evaluation of construction means and methods for the project\"\n(finding 132). No reason was given for this omission. His report merely assumed\nreliance without any stated basis for the assumption.\n\n\n\n                                            49\n\f       Significantly, PCI's principal, Mr. Nunn, testified credibly that, in the proposal\nplanning meetings, the AR was not the basis of any of the project constructability\ndiscussions (finding 31 ).\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, CCI has not satisfied the reliance requirement necessary\nto support a Type I differing site conditions claim.\n\n               (2)( c) Even if CCI Relied upon Indicated Site Conditions, it\n                            Did Not Interpret them Reasonably\n\n       Assuming, arguendo, that CCI relied upon the AR and USAID reports at the\nproposal stage, it did not interpret the indicated site conditions reasonably. From our own\nreview and the parties ' expert evidence, there were many indications that soft, weak soil\nconditions could be encountered, as summarized in section (4) below.\n\n        Moreover, even CCI's experts found the AR to be inconsistent and incomplete.\nMr. Hartley opined that it contained conflicting information on soil strength and that it\nwas hard to ascertain actual geological site conditions from the AR due to the conflicts\nand lack of data that a prudent geological engineer would include. (Findings 133, 135,\n139) Mr. Hoque found the AR to be confusing and opined that it did not contain\ninformation necessary for design and construction (findings 143 , 165). Mr. Lyman noted\nthat the BH logs described softer material than the blow counts indicated (finding 151 ).\n\n       Dr. Apted reported that the AR' s relatively high SPT N values were anomalous\nand indicated a higher undrained soil strength, unsupported by the BH log descriptions or\nthe AR' s reported vane strengths. He concluded that it should have been clear that the\nAR was limited in extent and quality and there was a risk of more difficult conditions.\n(Findings 159, 160, 166)\n\n       Thus, the Andrea report was contradictory on its face and did not have necessary\ndesign and construction information.\n\n  (3) The Conditions Encountered were Not Materially Different from those Indicated\n\n        In addition to the repeated crane pad material failures, post-award conditions\nincluded: ( 1) Gunderboom' s assessment of geotechnical problems apparent from the\noutset, including that a vessel was stuck in the muck in the middle of the job site, and\ndredging operations that might have deposited fine silt at the site for many years (finding\n109); (2) the National Lab's boring showing 2m of fill and 9m under it of very soft to\nsoft clay (finding 11 0); (3) the \"mudflat\" and dredging deposits observed by expert\nHartley (findings 105, 135); (4) the post-award Basra BH 2 that indicated a clayey silt\nranging from very soft to stiff (findings 59, 60, 134); (5) expert Hoque ' s observation of a\n\n\n                                              50\n\fmonotonous geology with an upper soft soil and competent soil below; his field testing by\nholding soil in his hands, which fell through his fingers, meaning it was very soft; and his\nobservation that silt was abundant at and/or below the surface throughout the site\n(findings 142, 144); (6) PND's January 2009 pre-construction report's description of the\nclays' design soil properties as very soft and expert Lyman's acknowledgement that this is\nwhat was encountered (findings 58, 156); and (7) expert Apted' s observations of a\nslippery, sheeny, silty clay surface or mud, in which he got bogged down, and his rebar\ntesting, indicating very soft soil conditions, which were readily apparent, along with a\nbrown river laden with sediment (finding 158).\n\n       Thus, site conditions were not materially different than indicated in the contract.\n\n    (4) The Conditions Encountered were Not Reasonably Unforeseeable Based upon\n                All the Information Available at the Time of Proposals\n\n       The RFP stated that offerors were expected to inspect the work site. Under the\ndesign/build contract, CCI was responsible for ascertaining conditions that could affect\nthe work, including tides, ground conditions, surface and subsurface conditions\nreasonably ascertainable from a site inspection, the government's exploratory work, and\nthe contract. It was to research all existing conditions at the naval base and waterway.\nSite specific geotechnical information necessary to design and construct the project and\ngeotechnical related items were CCI' s responsibility and it was to determine the\ngeotechnical conditions by field and laboratory investigations. (Findings 2, 4-6)\n\n        No one from CCI, PCI or PND attended the site visit. One SAR engineer attended.\nSAR did not have nearshore marine construction experience. We have not been directed\nto any evidence that the SAR engineer evaluated ground conditions or the suitability of\nthe site for land-based construction. The site visit was at high tide, reducing its scope, but\nnone of the questions the engineer posed pertained to geographic site conditions or CCI's\nmethod of dock construction. CCI did not request a ground investigation or hire a\ngeotechnical professional to evaluate its landside crane pad construction efforts until after\nslope instability occurred. (Findings 17, 21)\n\n        The RFP noted that the project site was on the west bank of a river that was an\nestuarine outflow of the Tigris-Euphrates delta system. A commercial port was\nimmediately upstream and the infrastructure was based on a continuous dredged quay\nalong the west bank. The river was heavily laden with fine sediments and a marine\nrailway between the commercial port and the naval base was reported to have already\nsilted in. Mr. Nunn, who was familiar with the project area due to PCI's work on a Basra\nairport project, knew that a dredging contractor was on site, that millions of dollars were\nbeing spent dredging the naval port, and the other piers were already clogged with\nsiltation. (Findings 12, 13, 16, 111) Indeed, CCI's expert Lyman concluded that\n\n\n                                             51\n\fdredging activities in close project proximity \"most likely produced a thin veneer of\nhighly saturated, unconsolidated, very weak soils,\" which might have exacerbated crane\naccess road instability (finding 150).\n\n        The Andrea report described the subsoil strata as consisting \"mainly of a very soft,\nsoft to medium gray to dark gray sandy silty clay\" layer with organic matter and soluble\nsalts, which overlaid a medium, dense to very dense layer of gray fine, medium to coarse\ngrained silty sand, with little gravel (finding 8). The majority of the first top soil was a\nsilt-sand-clay mixture. The relevant BH Nos. 2 and 3 were in an ebb and tide zone.\n(Findings 8, 9) The water table fluctuated and the zone immediately above it was \"greatly\naffected;\" as moisture increased, strength decreased and compressibility increased\n(finding 8). \"The saturated soil condition below the water table [made] the problem of\nsettlement significant\" (finding 9).\n\n        The AR stated that laboratory vane shear equipment was used to obtain the\nundrained shear strength of the samples due to high disturbance in all samplers that\nextruded from shelby tubes \"of the soft clayey layer, also it was found that this soil\nexudes between the fingers when squeezed in the fist so this could [be] described as very\nsoft to soft sandy clayey soil\" (finding 9). The undrained shear strength values were\nassociated with very soft to soft soils. The AR stated that organic matter with salts could\nbe found in the soil in many forms , which could significantly alter its engineering\nproperties, and that a site investigation had produced evidence of collapse due to the\nreaction between the fundamental soil compounds with organic matter. The AR noted\nthat, for construction on soft soil, the contractor could alleviate problems by replacing the\nsoft soil, using pile foundation or stabilizing or improving the soft soil. (!d.)\n\n        The AR' s log for BH No. 2, very near the pad site, described the top 7m of\nmaterial as very soft to soft silty clay with possible organic matter and shiny traces of\nsoluble salts. From 7 to 12.5m the material was soft to medium gray silty clay with some\nsilty sand pockets and shiny soluble salts. Dense to very dense materials started at 12.5m.\nSimilarly, the BH No. 3 log described the upper 7m as very soft to soft silty clay, with\npockets of fine sand, traces of organic matter and shiny soluble salts, and from 7 to 16.5m\nas soft silty clay with shiny soluble salts and some fine sand. Very dense material started\nat 6.5m, becoming loose to medium grained silty sand, with soluble salts, at 17 .Sm.\n(Findings 10, 11)\n\n       CCI's expert Hartley recognized that the AR indicated that there were problems\nwith extruding a sample from the Shelby tube \"because they were having issues with soft\nmaterial\" (finding 138). Its expert Hoque acknowledged that, even if blow counts gave\nthe most reliable data, visual classification should not be discounted (finding 147).\n\n\n\n\n                                             52\n\f       The USAID report noted the presence of silty sand and, suspended sediments;\nshoaling; dredged materials sidecast into the river channel; and a requirement for\nmaintenance dredging (findings 26-28).\n\n       The post-award ERDC report concluded that the \"very soft to soft\" consistency of\nthe foundation clays described in the AR should have served notice that dock construction\nand long-term performance were causes for concern; the high level of disturbance in the\nsoil samples was a direct result of the very soft to soft clay consistency and caused\nsignificant uncertainty in determining shear strength for slope stability analysis; it was\ncertain that the clay consistency was very soft to soft; and lack of information regarding\nwhich samples were tested in the lab vane tests or how many tests were performed\nincreased uncertainty (finding 117).\n\n        We are also persuaded by Dr. Apted's expert opinion that it reasonably could have\nbeen foreseen from the AR that the stratum underlying the site along the foreshore was\nlikely to be very soft or soft clay and that there was enough information in the AR and\nUS AID report to highlight a significant risk of very soft ground occurring below the\nforeshore, such that unconstrained construction of earthworks over the foreshore was at\nrisk of failure (findings 160, 166).\n\n        (5) CCI has Not Proved that its Claimed Injury was Caused Solely by the\n                          Claimed Differing Site Conditions\n\n        CCI advocated in the quantum portion of this appeal that it had segregated those of\nits alleged extra costs that were not attributable to its claimed differing site conditions\nfrom those that were. The Corps disagreed. Because we do not reach quantum, we only\nnote that even if, arguendo, there were differing site conditions, there are several factors\nundermining ccrs contention that its claimed costs were all attributable to them.\n\n        CCI claims that its proposal did not include profit or overhead (finding 38). Its\nconsultant found profit, overhead, contingencies and cash flow deficiencies in its\nproposal which he assessed could easily result in a shortfall of over $15,600,000 and\ncreate a severe risk to CCI. He reported that it did not do a project estimate or address\nproject conditions. (Finding 37) PCI's subcontractor Gunderboom believed it had\nunderestimated the work and time necessary for the project and was highly critical of\nPCI's perfonnance throughout the project, including its alleged failure to understand soils\nissues (findings 63. 109). CCI's Mr. Smithson was also highly critical ofPCI's project\nmanagement (finding 102). CCI and West had considerable difficulties procuring barges,\ncranes and some equipment (finding 119). Moreover, CCI did not present required proof\nthat all of its claimed differing site condition delays were to work on the critical path. See\nWilner v.
