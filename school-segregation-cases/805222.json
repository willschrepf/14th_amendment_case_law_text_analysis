MANDEVILLE\n\nplacement on contraband watch. The defendants brought a\nmotion for summary judgment, and the district court granted\nthe motion on some of the claims, but denied summary\njudgment with respect to Chappell’s Eighth Amendment and\ndue process claims against defendants R. Mandeville and\nT. Rosario. Mandeville and Rosario appealed. We hold that\nboth Mandeville and Rosario are entitled to qualified\nimmunity because the law at the time Chappell was on\ncontraband watch did not clearly establish that their actions\nwere unconstitutional. We therefore reverse.\n\n     I.   FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n    Rex Chappell was a prisoner in California State Prison,\nSacramento when his fianceé, Philissa Richard, came to visit\nhim on April 28, 2002. When Richard entered the prison\nfacilities she was wearing a ponytail hairpiece; the next day\nthe hairpiece was discovered in a trash can near the visiting\nroom. Prison officials then searched the entire visiting area\nand found spandex undergarments in the women’s bathroom.\nBoth the hairpiece and the undergarments tested positive for\ncocaine residue. Richard admitted that the hairpiece was hers,\nbut an investigation did not conclude whether the\nundergarments also belonged to Richard. A background\ncheck revealed that Richard had a long history of felony\noffenses, including numerous drug offenses.\n\n    Prison staff conducted a search of Chappell and his prison\ncell, during which they notified Chappell that they believed\nthat someone had introduced drugs through a hairpiece. The\nofficials discovered three unlabelled bottles of what appeared\nto be eye drops in Chappell’s cell. The liquid in the bottles\ntested positive for methamphetamine.\n\f                 CHAPPELL V . MANDEVILLE                     5\n\n    On April 30, 2002, Chappell was placed on contraband\nwatch. Under prison regulations, an official who is the rank\nof captain or above can make the decision to place a prisoner\non contraband watch if the official has reasonable cause to\nbelieve that an inmate has ingested or secreted contraband.\nF. Schroder was the acting facility captain at the time, but he\ndid not remember any specific details as to how Chappell was\nplaced on contraband watch or who made the decision.\nR. Mandeville, captain of the Investigative Services Unit, was\nin charge of the investigation but denies that he was the\nofficial who ordered contraband watch. T. Rosario was the\nacting warden and also would have had authority to order the\nwatch.\n\n      Contraband watch, also known as a “body cavity search,”\nis a temporary confinement during which a prisoner is closely\nmonitored and his bowel movements searched to determine\nwhether he has ingested or secreted contraband in his\ndigestive tract. Under prison procedures, the prisoner is first\nsearched and then dressed so as to prevent him from excreting\nany contraband and removing it from his clothing. The\nprisoner is placed in two pairs of underwear, one worn\nnormally and the other backwards, with the underwear taped\nat the waist and thighs. The prisoner is also placed in two\njumpsuits, one worn normally and the other backwards, with\nthe suits taped at the thighs, ankles, waist, and upper arms.\nThe tape on both the underwear and the jump suits is not\nmeant to touch the skin; it is used to close off any openings\nin the clothing. The prisoner is then placed in waist chain\nrestraints, which are handcuffs that are separated and chained\nto the side of the prisoner’s waist. This prevents the prisoner\nfrom being able to reach his rectum. The waist chain\nrestraints are adjustable and can be lengthened if necessary.\nThe prisoner is then placed in a surveillance cell where prison\n\f6                CHAPPELL V . MANDEVILLE\n\nstaff watch the prisoner at all times. The lights are kept on in\nthe cell to allow staff to see the prisoner. To prevent the\ninmate from concealing contraband, the cell does not have\nany furniture other than a bed without a mattress. The\nprisoner is given a blanket, and receives three meals a day\nand beverages. When the prisoner needs to defecate he must\nnotify the prison staff who will bring him a plastic, moveable\ntoilet chair. Once he uses the chair, the staff will search the\nwaste to determine if it contains contraband.\n\n    Chappell generally confirmed that these policies were\napplied to him while he was under contraband watch. In\naddition to these procedures, Chappell claims that he was also\nplaced in ankle shackles, and chained to the bed. He\ncomplains that the waist restraints were not loosened for\nmeals, forcing him to “eat [his] food like a dog; the\ntemperature in the cell was very high; the cell was\nunventilated; and the lights were “very bright.” Chappell\nalleged that the conditions “did in fact torture [him] mentally”\nand he felt like he “deteriorat[ed] mentally” during\ncontraband watch.\n\n   After having three bowel movements that did not reveal\ncontraband, Chappell was released from contraband watch on\nMay 6, 2002.\n\n    Chappell brought an action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983\nnaming various prison officials as defendants, including\nMandeville and Rosario, and alleging numerous\nconstitutional claims. The defendants brought a motion for\nsummary judgment, and the district court, adopting the\nfindings and recommendations of the magistrate judge,\ngranted the motion on some of the claims, but denied\nsummary judgment with respect to two of Chappell’s claims\n\f                   CHAPPELL V . MANDEVILLE                   7\n\nagainst Mandeville and Rosario: (1) that the contraband\nwatch constituted cruel and unusual punishment in violation\nof the Eighth Amendment, and (2) that Chappell’s due\nprocess rights were violated since he was not given notice of\nthe charges against him or an opportunity to be heard prior to\nbeing placed on contraband watch. Mandeville and Rosario\nappealed.\n\n             II.     LEGAL BACKGROUND\n\n    Qualified immunity protects government officials from\ncivil damages “insofar as their conduct does not violate\nclearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which\na reasonable person would have known.” Harlow v.\nFitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982); see also Schwenk v.\nHartford, 204 F.3d 1187, 1195–96 (9th Cir. 2000) (applying\nqualified immunity to prison officials). Whether qualified\nimmunity applies thus “turns on the objective legal\nreasonableness of the action, assessed in light of the legal\nrules that were clearly established at the time it was taken.”\nMesserschmidt v. Millender, 132 S. Ct. 1235, 1245 (2012)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Officials must have “fair\nwarning” that their actions are unconstitutional. Hope v.\nPelzer, 536 U.S. 730, 741 (2002); Porter v. Bowen, 496 F.3d\n1009, 1026–27 (9th Cir. 2007). If an official “reasonably\nbelieves that his or her conduct complies with the law,”\nqualified immunity applies. Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S.\n223, 244 (2009); see also Motley v. Parks, 432 F.3d 1072,\n1077 (9th Cir. 2005) (en banc) (noting that qualified\nimmunity will “shield[] an officer from trial when the officer\nreasonably misapprehends the law governing the\ncircumstances she confronted, even if the officer’s conduct\nwas constitutionally deficient” (internal quotation marks\n\f8                   CHAPPELL V . MANDEVILLE\n\nomitted)), overruled on other grounds by United States v.\nKing, 687 F.3d 1189 (9th Cir. 2012) (en banc).\n\n     To determine whether the law was clearly established, we\nfirst look to our own binding precedent. See Osolinski v.\nKane, 92 F.3d 934, 936 (9th Cir. 1996). If none is on point,\nwe may consider other decisional law. Id.; Drummond ex rel.\nDrummond v. City of Anaheim, 343 F.3d 1052, 1060–61 (9th\nCir. 2003). We need not find that the “very action in question\nhas previously been held unlawful,” Anderson v. Creighton,\n483 U.S. 635, 640 (1987) (internal citation omitted), but,\nrather, we consider whether “a reasonable officer would have\nhad fair notice that [the action] was unlawful, and that any\nmistake to the contrary would have been unreasonable.”\nDrummond, 343 F.3d at 1060; see also Hope, 536 U.S. at 741\n(“[O]fficials can still be on notice that their conduct violates\nestablished law even in novel factual circumstances.”).\n\n   In determining whether a government official should be\ngranted qualified immunity, we view the facts in the light\nmost favorable to the injured party. Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S.\n194, 201 (2001), receded from on other grounds by Pearson,\n355 U.S. at 817–21; see also Bryan v. MacPherson, 630 F.3d\n805, 817 (9th Cir. 2010).\n\n                       III.     DISCUSSION\n\n    On appeal, Mandeville and Rosario argue that they are\nentitled to qualified immunity on Chappell’s Eighth\nAmendment and due process claims.1 We agree. Under\n\n\n    1\n   W e have jurisdiction to consider an interlocutory appeal of a denial of\nqualified immunity. Behrens v. Pelletier, 516 U.S. 299, 307 (1996). W e\nreview a district court’s denial of summary judgment on grounds of\n\f                  CHAPPELL V . MANDEVILLE                       9\n\nChappell’s version of the facts, and assuming that he has\nstated a claim under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments,\nthe law was not clearly established on either of Chappell’s\nclaims at the time the contraband watch took place such that\nMandeville and Rosario would have had fair notice that their\nactions were unconstitutional. Thus, Mandeville and Rosario\nare entitled to qualified immunity.\n\nA. Chappell’s Eighth Amendment Claim\n\n    Chappell argues that the combination of conditions to\nwhich he was subjected, including twenty-four-hour lighting\nand mattress deprivation, violated his Eighth Amendment\nrights. We hold that as of April-May 2002, when Chappell\nwas placed on contraband watch, the law was not clearly\nestablished as to whether the conditions Chappell\nexperienced—either in isolation or combination—violated the\nEighth Amendment, made applicable to the states through the\nFourteenth Amendment.\n\n    1. Continuous lighting\n\n    With regards to continuous lighting, as of April-May\n2002, we had explained generally that sufficient or\n“[a]dequate lighting is one of the fundamental attributes of\n‘adequate shelter’ required by the Eighth Amendment,”\nHoptowit v. Spellman, 753 F.2d 779, 783 (9th Cir. 1985)\n(holding that inadequate lighting violated the Constitution),\nbut we had only addressed constant illumination once in\nKeenan v. Hall, 83 F.3d 1083, 1088, 1090–91 (9th Cir. 1996).\nIn Keenan we held that there was a triable issue of fact on a\n\n\nqualified immunity de novo. See Bryan, 630 F.3d at 823; Sorrels v.\nMcKee, 290 F.3d 965, 969 (9th Cir. 2002).\n\f10                 CHAPPELL V . MANDEVILLE\n\ncontinuous lighting claim where a prisoner was subjected to\ntwo large fluorescent lights that were kept on 24 hours a day\nfor six months, and the prisoner claimed that the lighting\ncaused him “‘grave sleeping problems’ and other and\npsychological problems.” Id. at 1088, 1091. We noted that the\nprison officials in that case had “no legitimate penological\njustification for requiring inmates to suffer physical and\npsychological harm by living in constant illumination,” id. at\n1090 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted),\nrelying on a district court decision, LeMaire v. Maass, 745 F.\nSupp. 623, 636 (D. Or. 1990), vacated, 12 F.3d 1444, 1459\n(9th Cir. 1993) (vacating, in part, because the state agreed to\nchange the lighting).\n\n    Keenan did not clearly establish that Mandeville’s and\nRosario’s actions were unconstitutional because the facts of\nKeenan are distinguishable. In Keenan, the prisoner claimed\nsleep deprivation over a period of six months; Chappell’s\nclaim is based on seven days of contraband watch, and he did\nnot claim that he was sleep deprived.2\n\n    Moreover, Keenan did not clearly establish that constant\nillumination violates the Eighth Amendment when done for\na legitimate penological purpose. Keenan noted that no\nlegitimate penological justification had been offered in that\ncase. Keenan, 83 F.3d at 1090. Furthermore, the district court\ncase on which Keenan relied, LeMaire, acknowledged that a\nneed to see into cells as a security measure could be a\n\n\n  2\n     As Judge Berzon acknowledges in her dissent, Chappell “did not\nexpressly allege” that the contraband watch caused him sleeping\nproblems. Dissent Op. at 35. The only statement relating to sleep in the\nAmended Complaint is that Chappell was “deteriorating mentally” and\nhad to “attempt to sleep that way.”\n\f                    CHAPPELL V . MANDEVILLE                           11\n\nlegitimate penological justification, but concluded that the\npenological justification offered in that case was insufficient\nbecause there was no evidence that the staff “need[ed] to see\ninto the quiet cells for 24 hours per day, or that they [were]\neven near the quiet cells for 24 hours per day.” LeMaire, 745\nF. Supp. at 636.3 In contrast, the record here reflects a clear\npenological purpose. Prison officials suspected that Chappell\nhad secreted contraband in his body and kept the lights on so\nthat they could monitor Chappell 24 hours a day to prevent\nhim from disposing of the contraband. The officers would\nhave been unable to perform contraband watch if they could\nnot see into his cell. Thus, our case law did not clearly\nestablish that in April-May 2002 that the constant\nillumination of Chappell’s cell was unconstitutional.\n\n     In addition, even if Chappell and Mandeville had looked\nto other decisional law for guidance they still would not have\nhad fair notice that their actions were unconstitutional.\nIndeed, one district court case surveying the state of the law\nexplained that there have been “mixed results” on continuous\nlighting claims because “such cases are fact-driven.”\nShepherd v. Ault, 982 F. Supp. 643, 645 (N.D. Iowa 1997). In\nthat case the court held that prisoners raised a genuine issue\nof material fact on their Eighth Amendment claims where two\nprisoners spent 283 days and 550 days, respectively, under\n\n\n  3\n    Judge Berzon points out that Keenan says that “‘there is no legitimate\npenological justification for requiring inmates to suffer physical and\npsychological harm by living in constant illumination.’” Keenan, 83 F.3d\nat 1090 (quoting LeMaire, 745 F. Supp. at 636); see Dissent O p. at 36.\nAlthough Judge Berzon reads Keenan as broadly stating that penological\nreasons cannot justify constant illumination under any circumstances,\nKeenan itself was quoting from LeMaire, in which that court left open the\npossibility that a legitimate penological purpose could justify constant\nillumination. 745 F. Supp. at 636.\n\f12               CHAPPELL V . MANDEVILLE\n\nbright lighting, and one of those two prisoners claimed that he\nhad difficulty sleeping. Id. at 647–49. Under different\ncircumstances, however, other courts had concluded that the\neffects of continuous lighting were not severe enough to\nconstitute a violation of the Eighth Amendment. See, e.g.,\nZatko v. Rowland, 835 F. Supp. 1174, 1181 (N.D. Cal 1993)\n(noting that continuous light depriving a prisoner of sleep\nwould be unconstitutional but dismissing the claim because\nthe officers did not use the light to try to keep the prisoner\nawake); Williams v. Ward, 567 F. Supp. 10, 13, 15 (E.D.N.Y\n1982) (holding that keeping hallway lights on all night did not\nviolate a constitutional right even where plaintiff claimed\ninability to sleep); Cassidy v. Superintendent, 392 F. Supp.\n330, 334 (W.D. Va. 1975) (holding that “flood[ing] a cell\nwith a bright light twenty-four hours a day” was\nconstitutional where the lights allowed guards to check the\ncells, the lights were not bright enough to interfere with the\nprisoners’ sleep, the prisoner chose to stay in that particular\ncell, and the light was not used in a “vindictive manner”),\naff’d in part, rev’d in part and remanded, 529 F.2d 514 (4th\nCir. 1975) (grounds for reversal not provided); Bauer v.\nSielaff, 372 F. Supp. 1104, 1110 (E.D. Pa. 1974) (“[T]he\ndiscomfort of lights at night do[es] not constitute a\nconstitutional deprivation.”).\n\n    Moreover, in a different context—that of pre-trial\ndetainees bringing claims under the Due Process Clause of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment, which protects an even broader\nclass of interests than the Eighth Amendment, see Redman v.\nCnty. of San Diego, 942 F.2d 1435, 1440 n.7 (9th Cir. 1991)\n(explaining that “while the eighth amendment proscribes\ncruel and unusual punishment for convicted inmates, the due\nprocess clause of the fourteenth amendment proscribes any\npunishment of pretrial detainees”); see also Bell v. Wolfish,\n\f                 CHAPPELL V . MANDEVILLE                      13\n\n441 U.S. 520, 535 n.16 (1979),—other courts had held that\nconstant lighting can serve a legitimate penological purpose.\nSee, e.g., Ferguson v. Cape Girardeau County, 88 F.3d 647,\n650 (8th Cir. 1996) (holding where bright lights were on\ncontinuously and the plaintiff was observed sleeping that the\n“totality of the circumstances—which include the relative\nshort duration of the confinement, the necessity to keep the\ndetainee under observation for both his medical condition as\nwell as general safety concerns, and the amount of time that\nhe spent out of the cell—supports the assertion of legitimate\ngovernmental interest,” and thus no constitutional violation\noccurred); O’Donnell v. Thomas, 826 F.2d 788, 790 (8th Cir.\n1987) (“[C]ontinuous lighting in [a] holding cell was not\nunreasonable given the need for jail security and the need to\nmonitor [the prisoner].”); Fillmore v. Ordonez, 829 F. Supp.\n1544, 1568 (D. Kan. 1993) (holding that a continuous low-\nintensity light was “reasonably related to the maintenance of\ninternal security of the Osage County jail”), aff’d, 17 F.3d\n1436 (10th Cir. 1994), abrogated in part on other grounds as\nrecognized by Williams v. Weber, 905 F. Supp. 1502, 1512\nn.13 (D. Kan. 1995).\n\n    Overall, as of April-May 2002, other jurisdictions had\nmade decisions on continuous lighting based on various\nfactors, including whether the lights caused sleep deprivation,\nShepherd, 982 F. Supp. at 647–49; Zatko, 835 F. Supp. at\n1181; Cassidy, 392 F. Supp. at 334; the brightness and\nintensity of the lights, id.; the duration of exposure, Shepherd,\n982 F. Supp. at 648–49; Ferguson, 88 F.3d at 650; whether a\nlegitimate penological justification existed, Cassidy, 392 F.\nSupp. at 334; Ferguson, 88 F.3d at 650; Fillmore, 829 F.\nSupp. at 1568; and whether prison officials were trying to\nkeep the prisoner awake, Zatko, 835 F. Supp. at 1181. The\nresults of these cases were mixed. A large majority of the\n\f14               CHAPPELL V . MANDEVILLE\n\ncourts, however, concluded that the there was no Eighth\nAmendment violation.\n\n    Since, at the time Chappell’s contraband watch took\nplace, no court had ruled on whether contraband watch\nconstitutes a legitimate penological purpose that would justify\ncontinuous lighting, and Chappell was subjected to\ncontinuous lighting for only seven days and did not claim that\nhe was deprived of sleep or intentionally kept awake,\nMandeville and Rosario did not have fair notice that their\nactions were unconstitutional. Given our decision in Keenan\nand the decisional law in other circuits, we have some doubt\nthat the conditions that Chappell experienced under\ncontraband watch even amounted to Eighth Amendment\nviolation, but we do not reach this question since, at a\nminimum, the law was not clearly established that the\ncontraband watch was unconstitutional and thus Chappell’s\nEighth Amendment claim can be resolved on qualified\nimmunity grounds.\n\n     2. Mattress deprivation\n\n    The law was not clearly established as of April-May 2002\nwith regards to mattress deprivation either. We had held that\nmattress deprivation “for only one night [was] insufficient to\nstate an eighth amendment violation,” Hernandez v. Denton,\n861 F.2d 1421, 1424 (9th Cir. 1988), vacated on other\ngrounds, 493 U.S. 801, (1989), but had not made clear\nwhether mattress deprivation for longer could state an Eighth\nAmendment claim. Although we had indicated in an\nunpublished decision that a prisoner who was “forced to sleep\non the floor, without a mattress, next to broken toilets and\noverflowing showers” for an unspecified period of time and\n“had to wear the same clothes for 45 days” might have an\n\f                 CHAPPELL V . MANDEVILLE                     15\n\nEighth Amendment claim, Seagrave v. Hennessey, No. 92-\n17121, 1994 U.S. App. LEXIS 4321, at *4–6 (9th Cir. Mar.\n2, 1994), we had also explained that the Supreme Court’s\nobservation that “a condition of confinement which does not\nviolate the Eighth Amendment when it exists for just a few\ndays may constitute a violation when it exists for ‘weeks or\nmonths,’ . . . [did] not provide clear guidance to prison\nofficials as to how much time must pass before requiring a\nprisoner to sleep on the floor of a cell without a mattress\n[may] constitute an Eighth Amendment violation.” Schroeder\nv. Kaplan, 60 F.3d 834, 1995 WL 398878, at *2 (9th Cir. July\n7, 1995) (unpublished) (quoting Hutto v. Finley, 437 U.S.\n678, 686–87 (1978)). We also held in Schroeder that, where\na prisoner was forced to sleep on a cold concrete floor for\nmost of a month, the law was not clearly established on\nwhether mattress deprivation was an Eighth Amendment\nviolation. Id. at *2–3. We concluded that there was no\nbinding precedent in our circuit, that decisional law in other\njurisdictions was inconsistent, and that those courts that found\na constitutional violation had additional egregious facts\nsupporting an Eighth Amendment claim. Id. at *2 (citing\ncases that included additional factors such as “extreme cold,\nlack of sanitary conditions, solitary confinement, inadequate\nclothing, or improper diet”).\n\n    If Mandeville and Rosario had looked to Schroeder they\nwould not have had notice on whether mattress deprivation\nconstituted an Eighth Amendment violation. This is\nparticularly true because the facts surrounding Chappell’s\nconfinement are much less severe than those in Schroeder.\nNot only was Chappell forced to sleep without a mattress for\nonly seven days, which is significantly less time than the\nprisoner in Schroeder who went a month without a mattress,\nbut Chappell had a bed and a blanket. Mandeville and\n\f16               CHAPPELL V . MANDEVILLE\n\nRosario also submitted evidence that there was a legitimate\npurpose for not allowing Chappell to have a mattress—no\nmattress or furniture was allowed into the cell to prevent the\ninmate from concealing contraband.\n\n    We did not hear any cases on mattress deprivation\nbetween July 1995, when Schroeder was decided, and April-\nMay 2002, when Chappell was placed on contraband watch.\nThe law of other jurisdictions between July 1995 and April-\nMay 2002 would not have provided Chappell and Rosario\nwith any further clarity either. Compare Jones v. Toombs, 77\nF.3d 482, 1996 WL 67750 (6th Cir. Feb. 15, 1996)\n(unpublished) (holding that two weeks without a mattress did\nnot violate the Eighth Amendment), O’Leary v. Iowa State\nMen's Reformatory, 79 F.3d 82, 84 (8th Cir. 1996) (holding\nthat three days without a blanket and a mattress during a\ndisciplinary confinement did not violate the Eighth\nAmendment), Castro v. Chesney, No. CIV. A. 97-4983, 1998\nWL 767467, at *8 (E.D. Pa. Nov. 3, 1998) (holding that two\ndays without a mattress and a blanket would not rise to a\nconstitutional violation), and Johnson v. Zanon, 543 N.W. 2d\n868, 1995 WL 576891, at *1–2 (Wis. Ct. App. Oct. 3, 1995)\n(unpublished) (holding that three days without a mattress did\nnot support an Eighth Amendment claim), with DeSpain v.\nUphoff, 229 F.3d 1162, 2000 WL 1228003 (10th Cir. Aug.\n30, 2000) (unpublished) (holding that three days without a\nmattress, bedding, or clothes in an unheated cell was\nsufficient to withstand summary judgment on prisoner’s\nEighth Amendment claim), Rhoden v. Godinez, No. 95 C\n5085, 1996 WL 559954, at *4 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 30, 1996)\n(unpublished) (holding that several months without bed linen\nand a mattress could sustain an Eighth Amendment claim, but\nnoting that the deprivation could have been “justified by\nlegitimate security concerns”), and Gordon v. Sheahan, No.\n\f                 CHAPPELL V . MANDEVILLE                      17\n\n96 C 1784, 1997 WL 136699, at *7 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 24, 1997)\n(noting that “[r]equiring even a convicted prisoner to sleep\nwithout a mattress for more than a few days could” violate\nthe Eighth Amendment). Thus, our conclusion in Schroeder\nthat the law was not clearly established was still true in April-\nMay 2002. Mandeville and Rosario would not have had fair\nnotice that mattress deprivation alone would have constituted\na constitutional violation.\n\n    3. Combination of conditions\n\n    Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Chappell,\nin addition to the continuous lighting and the mattress\ndeprivation, Chappell alleged that he was taped into two pairs\nof underwear and jumpsuits, placed in a hot cell with no\nventilation, chained to an iron bed, shackled at the ankles and\nwaist so that he could not move his arms, and was forced to\neat like a dog. The district court adopted the magistrate’s\nfinding that these conditions had the “mutually enforcing\neffect of sleep deprivation that any reasonable officer would\nknow comprised unconstitutional conditions of confinement.”\nWe disagree.\n\n    It is true that “[s]ome conditions of confinement may\nestablish an Eighth Amendment violation ‘in combination’\nwhen each would not do so alone.” Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S.\n294, 304 (1991). But this only applies when the conditions\n“have a mutually enforcing effect that produces the\ndeprivation of a single, identifiable human need such as food,\nwarmth, or exercise—for example, a low cell temperature at\nnight combined with a failure to issue blankets.” Id. Chappell\nhas not alleged the deprivation of any such need here. He did\nnot specifically claim that he was sleep deprived during the\n\f18               CHAPPELL V . MANDEVILLE\n\ncontraband watch, but only that he was “deteriorating\nmentally” and had to “attempt to sleep that way.”\n\n    Moreover, the focus of the inquiry under qualified\nimmunity is whether the defendants had fair notice that their\nactions were unconstitutional. In April-May 2002, there were\nno cases in this jurisdiction that involved a contraband watch\nsimilar to the one that occurred here. The only factually\nsimilar case was Mendoza v. Blodgett, which involved a\n“feces watch” where the prisoner was placed in a “dry cell”\nwearing only a pair of shorts and not given a blanket.\nMendoza v. Blodgett, 1990 WL 263527, at *4–5 (E.D. Wash.\nDec. 21, 1990), aff’d on other grounds, 960 F.2d 1425, 1427\nn.3 (9th Cir. 1992) (noting that Mendoza did not renew his\nEighth Amendment Claim). In that case, the district court\nheld that these circumstances did not amount to an Eighth\nAmendment violation, noting that the purpose of these\nconditions was “to insure that [the prisoner was] unable to\nconceal or destroy any contraband passed through a bowel\nmovement.” Id. at *5.\n\n    Case law in other jurisdictions would not have provided\nany further clarity. The Seventh Circuit held similarly that\nplacement of a prisoner into a dry cell for three days, during\nwhich he was unable to wash his hands and denied personal\nhygiene items, did not violate the Eighth Amendment,\nparticularly since the prisoner had been “confined to the dry\ncell to serve a legitimate penological interest.” Jihad v.\nWright, 124 F.3d 204, 1997 WL 471345, at *2 (7th Cir. Aug.\n14, 1997) (unpublished); see also Stewart v. Wright, 101 F.3d\n704, 1996 WL 665978, at *1 (7th Cir. Nov. 14, 1996)\n(unpublished) (holding that a three-day confinement to dry\ncell without toilet paper, toothbrush, toothpaste, in a “filthy\nroach-infested cell” did not violate the Eighth Amendment).\n\f                     CHAPPELL V . MANDEVILLE                             19\n\n    Although the conditions here were more severe than those\nin the feces watch cases, as previously explained, Mandeville\nand Rosario presented evidence that the contraband watch\nconditions were engineered with an eye to accomplishing the\nsame penological purpose as the feces watch\ncases—discovering secreted contraband. Given this important\npenological purpose and the state of the law at the time, the\ncontraband watch was not “such a far cry from what any\nreasonable prison official could have believed was legal that\nthe defendants knew or should have known they were\nbreaking the law.” Sorrels, 290 F.3d at 971; see also\nMesserschmidt, 132 S. Ct. at 1244 (“Qualified immunity\ngives government officials breathing room to make\nreasonable but mistaken judgments, and protects all but the\nplainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.”\n(internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n   Because no court had held that conditions similar to those\nChappell experienced were unconstitutional in the face of the\nimportant penological purpose of discovering contraband, we\nhold that Mandeville and Rosario are entitled to qualified\nimmunity on Chappell’s Eighth Amendment claim.4\n\n\n\n  4\n     Because Mandeville and Rosario are entitled to qualified immunity,\nwe do not consider whether these conditions amounted to an actual Eighth\nAmendment violation. Our holding is limited to a finding that the law was\nnot clearly established as to whether the conditions that Chappell was\nsubjected to, both in isolation and combination, violated the Eighth\nAmendment. See Reichle v. Howards, 132 S. Ct. 2088, 2093 (2012)\n(explaining that a court “may grant qualified immunity on the ground that\na purported right was not ‘clearly established’ by prior case law, without\nresolving the often more difficult question whether the purported right\nexists at all” to avoid deciding constitutional questions unnecessarily); see\nalso Pearson, 555 U.S. at 236–37, 241.\n\f20               CHAPPELL V . MANDEVILLE\n\nB. Chappell’s Due Process Claim\n\n    Chappell also claims that his right to due process was\nviolated because he was not provided with an opportunity to\nbe heard by the official who ordered the contraband watch.\nFor Chappell to be entitled to due process we first must find\nthat he has a liberty interest triggering procedural protections.\nA liberty interest can arise from one of two sources—either\nthe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment or\nstate law. Mendoza, 960 F.2d at 1428. Since Chappell does\nnot make clear whether he bases his claim on the Due Process\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment or whether he claims a\nstate-created liberty interest, we analyze both theories.\n\n     1. Liberty interest under the Fourteenth Amendment\n\n     We conclude that the Due Process Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment does not afford Chappell a liberty\ninterest. “[L]awfully incarcerated persons retain only a\nnarrow range of protected liberty interests.” Hewitt v. Helms,\n459 U.S. 460, 467 (1983). Thus, “[a]s long as the conditions\nor degree of confinement to which the prisoner is subjected\nis within the sentence imposed upon him and is not otherwise\nviolative of the Constitution, the Due Process Clause does not\nin itself subject an inmate’s treatment by prison authorities to\njudicial oversight.” Montanye v. Haymes, 427 U.S. 236, 242\n(1976). Transfer to less amenable quarters for non-punitive\nreasons has been held to be “ordinarily contemplated by a\nprison sentence.” Hewitt, 459 U.S. at 468; see also Wilkinson\nv. Austin, 545 U.S. 209, 221 (2005) (explaining that “[t]he\nConstitution itself does not give rise to a liberty interest in\navoiding transfer to more adverse conditions of\nconfinement”). Indeed, the Due Process Clause does not\nprotect against all changes in conditions of confinement even\n\f                 CHAPPELL V . MANDEVILLE                    21\n\nwhere they “hav[e] a substantial adverse impact on the\nprisoner involved.” Meachum v. Fano, 427 U.S. 215, 224\n(1976).\n\n    An investigative contraband watch is the type of condition\nof confinement that is ordinarily contemplated by the\nsentence imposed. Only the most extreme changes in the\nconditions of confinement have been found to directly invoke\nthe protections of the Due Process Clause, such as\ninvoluntary commitment to a mental institution, see Vitek v.\nJones, 445 U.S. 480, 493–94 (1980), or the forced\nadministration of psychotropic drugs, Washington v. Harper,\n494 U.S. 210, 221–22 (1990). Since a temporary contraband\nwatch does not rise to this level, Chappell cannot directly\nclaim a liberty interest under the Due Process Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment.\n\n   2. State-created liberty interest\n\n    In addition, the claim that Mandeville and Rosario are\nliable to Chappell for damages based on a state-created\nliberty interest also fails. Since the law was not clearly\nestablished on whether a state-created liberty interest existed\nwith regard to the contraband watch when it took place,\nMandeville and Rosario are also entitled to qualified\nimmunity on Chappell’s due process claim, and so cannot be\nliable for damages.\n\n       a. Sandin and the substantive predicates test\n\n    A state may create a liberty interest through statutes,\nprison regulations, and policies. Wilkinson, 545 U.S. at 222;\nNeal v. Shimoda, 131 F.3d 818, 827 (9th Cir. 1997). For\nmany years we analyzed whether a state had created a liberty\n\f22               CHAPPELL V . MANDEVILLE\n\ninterest in its prison regulations under the “substantive\npredicates approach,” based on the Supreme Court’s decision\nin Hewitt v. Helms, 459 U.S. 460. This approach asked\nwhether the state has placed “substantive limitations on\nofficial discretion,” through “adopting regulations which\nestablish ‘substantive predicates’ to govern official\ndecisionmaking,” by using “explicitly mandatory” rather\nthan discretionary language. Mendoza, 960 F.2d at 1428–29;\nsee also Hewitt, 459 U.S. at 471–72.\n\n     Our approach to state-created liberty interests changed,\nhowever, in response to the Court’s decision in Sandin v.\nConner, 515 U.S. 472 (1995). In Sandin, the Court criticized\nits previous “substantive predicates” approach as applied to\nchanges in prison conditions, asserting that “the search for a\nnegative implication from mandatory language in prisoner\nregulations has strayed from the real concerns undergirding\nthe liberty protected by the Due Process Clause.” Id. at\n480–83. Sandin then refocused the inquiry on whether the\naction “imposes [an] atypical and significant hardship on the\ninmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.” Id.\nat 483–84. In applying Sandin, we have concluded that the\ndiscretionary/mandatory substantive predicates approach was\n“abandoned” or “overruled” in Sandin, and our decisions\nhave focused only on the “atypical and significant hardship”\ntest, even in the face of relevant prison regulations. See, e.g.,\nMyron v. Terhune, 476 F.3d 716, 719 (9th Cir. 2007) (noting\nthat Sandin abandoned the mandatory/discretionary\nmethodology for convicted prisoners); McQuillion v. Duncan,\n306 F.3d 895, 903 (9th Cir. 2002) (noting that Sandin\n“abandon[ed] the ‘mandatory language’ framework”); Duffy\nv. Riveland, 98 F.3d 447, 457 (9th Cir. 1996) (explaining that\nthe mandatory language “test for the existence of state-\ncreated liberty interests . . . has been abandoned by the\n\f                    CHAPPELL V . MANDEVILLE                             23\n\nSupreme Court” in Sandin); Mitchell v. Dupnik, 75 F.3d 517,\n522 (9th Cir. 1996) (noting that Sandin criticized the\n“substantive predicates approach” and refocused the test);\nMujahid v. Meyer, 59 F.3d 931, 932 (9th Cir. 1995) (noting\nthat Sandin “overruled” Ninth Circuit cases that have taken\na substantive predicate/mandatory language approach); cf.\nNeal, 131 F.3d at 828–29 (noting, before Wilkinson, that the\nsubstantive predicates test had “likely . . . been disapproved”\nof in Sandin but holding that a state program likely created a\nliberty interest in any event).5\n\n     Sandin and its progeny made this much clear: to find a\nviolation of a state-created liberty interest the hardship\nimposed on the prisoner must be “atypical and significant . .\n. in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.” Sandin,\n515 U.S. at 483–84.\n\n         b. Atypical and significant hardship test\n\n   We conclude that the law did not clearly establish that the\nconditions that Chappell experienced constituted an “atypical\nand significant hardship.” At the time of Chappell’s\n\n\n  5\n      In contrast to the shift regarding prison conditions and discipline\ncases, the “mandatory language” analysis of Greenholtz v. Inmates of\nNeb. Penal & Corr. Complex, 442 U.S. 1 (1979), and Bd. of Pardons v.\nAllen, 482 U.S. 369 (1987), retains continuing vitality in cases concerning\nprisoners’ state-created liberty interest in parole. See Swarthout v. Cooke,\n131 S. Ct. 859, 861–63 (2011) (per curiam) (characterizing our holding\nthat California law creates a liberty interest in parole as “a reasonable\napplication” of Allen and Greenholtz, but holding that prisoners have no\nconstitutionally protected liberty interest in factual support for parole\ndecisions); see also, e.g., Miller v. Or. Bd. of Parole & Post Prison\nSupervision, 642 F.3d 711, 714–16 (9th Cir. 2011); Roberts v. Hartley,\n640 F.3d 1042, 1045 (9th Cir. 2011).\n\f24               CHAPPELL V . MANDEVILLE\n\ncontraband watch, we had explained that the “atypical and\nsignificant hardship” is context-dependent and requires “fact\nby fact consideration,” Keenan, 83 F.3d at 1089. We\nconfirmed this only a year after the contraband watch took\nplace, noting that “[t]here is no single standard for\ndetermining whether a prison hardship is atypical and\nsignificant” and that analysis under this standard requires\n“case by case, fact by fact consideration.” Ramirez v. Galaza,\n334 F.3d 850, 861 (9th Cir. 2003) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Indeed, we had noted prior to April-May 2002 that\nat least three factors from Sandin should be considered in\neach case: (1) whether the conditions of confinement\n“mirrored those conditions imposed upon inmates in\nanalogous discretionary confinement settings, namely\nadministrative segregation and protective custody,” (2) the\nduration and intensity of the conditions of confinement; and\n(3) whether the change in confinement would “inevitably\naffect the duration of [the prisoner’s] sentence.” Pifer v.\nMarshall, 139 F.3d 907, 1998 WL 81335, at *1 n.3 (9th Cir.\nFeb. 24, 1998) (unpublished) (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n\n    We are not aware of any court that, as of April-May 2002,\nhad applied the Sandin test, or similar temporary,\ninvestigatory confinement, to hold that a contraband watch\nwas an “atypical and significant hardship” apart from the\nordinary conditions of prison management. The only similar\ncase in which we had considered a due process claim was\nMendoza, where the prisoner had been placed on “feces\nwatch.” Mendoza, 960 F.2d at 1427–29. That case, however,\nwas pre-Sandin and thus did not apply the “atypical and\nsignificant hardship” test. Id. Moreover, no other jurisdiction\nhad applied the “atypical and significant hardship” test to any\nfactually similar cases before April-May 2002 either.\n\f                 CHAPPELL V . MANDEVILLE                     25\n\n    Because there was no case law holding that contraband\nwatch, or any similar regime, is an “atypical and significant\nhardship,” and the “atypical and significant hardship” test is\nso fact-specific, Mandeville and Rosario did not have fair\nnotice on whether the conditions that Chappell experienced\nviolated a state-created liberty interest that would trigger due\nprocess protections. Thus, Mandeville and Rosario are also\nentitled to qualified immunity on Chappell’s due process\nclaim.\n\n                   IV.    CONCLUSION\n\n    We conclude that, as of April-May 2002, the law was not\nclearly established as to whether the conditions that Chappell\nexperienced in connection with the contraband watch violated\nthe Eighth Amendment. Moreover, we conclude that\nChappell cannot claim a liberty interest under the Due\nProcess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and it was not\nclearly established that Chappell had sustained a violation of\na state-created liberty interest. Therefore, both Mandeville\nand Rosario are entitled to qualified immunity. In light of this\nconclusion, we do not decide whether Chappell’s claims, if\nproven, would violate the Eighth or Fourteenth Amendments.\n\n   REVERSED.\n\n\n\nGRAHAM, Senior District Judge, concurring:\n\n    I join the panel’s opinion with the exception of Section\nIII.B.2. I write separately because I disagree with my\ncolleagues’ interpretation of the Supreme Court’s decision in\nSandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472 (1995), in the context of their\n\f26               CHAPPELL V . MANDEVILLE\n\nanalysis of Chappell’s due process claim based on a state-\ncreated liberty interest.\n\n    I believe that subjecting Chappell to contraband watch did\nnot violate his rights under the Due Process Clause. The due\nprocess analysis should end there because Chappell has\nidentified no state statute or regulation which limits the\ndiscretion of prison officials to subject him to this kind of\ntemporary investigatory confinement. In the absence of such\na state statute or regulation, there can be no state-created\nliberty interest.\n\n    My colleagues apparently believe that Sandin changed\nthis requirement and that post-Sandin any change in\nconditions of confinement which imposes an “atypical and\nsignificant hardship” may give rise to a violation of a state-\ncreated liberty interest. I fail to understand how it could be\nsaid that a state has “created” a liberty interest by imposing\nharsher conditions of confinement. In effect, my colleagues\nhave interpreted Sandin to conflate the state-created liberty\ninterest analysis so as to give a state prisoner direct access to\nthe protections of the Due Process Clause if he can show that\nthe conditions of his confinement impose an “atypical and\nsignificant hardship.” This is a radical change in due process\njurisprudence and a significant departure from previous\nlimitations. See Meachum v. Fano, 427 U.S. 215, 224 (1976)\n(rejecting the proposition that “[a]ny change in the conditions\nof confinement having a substantial adverse impact on the\nprisoner involved is sufficient to invoke the protections of the\nDue Process Clause”). Cases in which the Supreme Court\nhas found that conditions of confinement amounted to a\nviolation of the Due Process Clause have been limited to such\nextremes as involuntary commitment to a mental institution\nand the forced administration of psychotropic drugs. See\n\f                 CHAPPELL V . MANDEVILLE                     27\n\nVitek v. Jones, 445 U.S. 480 (1980) and Washington v.\nHarper, 494 U.S. 210 (1990).\n\n     A state may create a liberty interest through statutes and\nprison regulations and may thereby trigger due process\nprotections. Wilkinson v. Austin, 545 U.S. 209, 222 (2005);\nNeal v. Shimoda, 131 F.3d 818, 827 (9th Cir. 1997). The\ndetermination of whether a state-created liberty interest exists\nis a two-part inquiry. First, there must be a regulation that\nplaces “substantive limitations on official discretion.”\nMendoza v. Blodgett, 960 F.2d. 1425, 1428 (9th Cir. 1992)\n(citing Kentucky Dep’t of Corrections v. Thompson, 490 U.S.\n454, 462 (1989)). In Mendoza, the court explained:\n\n       The most common way a state creates such an\n       interest is by adopting regulations which\n       establish “substantive predicates” to govern\n       official decisionmaking and by mandating the\n       outcome to be reached upon a finding that the\n       relevant criteria have been met. There must be\n       particularized standards or criteria to guide\n       the state’s decisionmakers, and the criteria\n       must serve to limit discretion. If a\n       decisionmaker can make his decision for any\n       constitutionally permissible reason or for no\n       reason at all, the state has not created a liberty\n       interest.\n\n960 F.2d at 1428-1429 (citations omitted).\n\n    The second part of the inquiry asks whether the regulation\nin question concerns a restraint that imposes an “atypical and\nsignificant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary\nincidents of prison life.” Sandin, 515 U.S. at 484. Prior to\n\f28                CHAPPELL V . MANDEVILLE\n\nSandin, prisoners had asserted federal due process claims\nbased on all sorts of prison regulations, such as those\npertaining to visitation, lunch trays, books, electrical outlets\nin cells, prison jobs, etc. Id. at 482–83. In Sandin, the Court\nclarified its earlier decisions on state-created liberty interests\nby making it clear that those interests are protected by the\nDue Process Clause only when state regulations, relating to\nfreedom from restraints, impose “atypical and significant\nhardships on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents\nof prison life.” Id. at 484.\n\n    This two-part inquiry is based on my understanding of the\nstate of the law in the aftermath of Sandin and is the approach\nadopted by the Second Circuit. In Tellier v. Fields, 280 F.3d\n69 (2d Cir. 2001), the Second Circuit described the proper\nanalysis:\n\n        As we have recognized previously, after the\n        Supreme Court’s decision in Sandin, our\n        determination of “whether the plaintiff had a\n        protected liberty interest in not being\n        confined” also requires a two-part analysis.\n        [Sealey v. Giltner, 116 F.3d 47, 51 (2d Cir.\n        1997)] (citing Frazier v. Coughlin, 81 F.3d\n        313, 317 (2d Cir. 1996) (per curiam)). “As a\n        result of Sandin, a prisoner has a liberty\n        interest only if the deprivation . . . is atypical\n        and significant and the state has created the\n        liberty interest by statute or regulation.” Id. at\n        52.\n\n        First, we examine whether the alleged\n        deprivation was atypical and significant. . . .\n        Second, we must examine whether the state\n\f                  CHAPPELL V . MANDEVILLE                 29\n\n       has created a liberty interest by statute or\n       regulation.\n\n280 F.3d at 80.\n\n       After conducting the Hewitt / Sandin analysis\n       . . . we conclude that Section 541.22 creates a\n       liberty interest. Under [Hewitt v. Helms, 459\n       U.S. 460 (1983)], courts considering the\n       existence of an alleged liberty interest must\n       ascertain whether “statutes or regulations\n       require, in ‘language of an unmistakably\n       mandatory character,’ that a prisoner not\n       suffer a particular deprivation absent specified\n       predicates.” Welch v. Bartlett, 196 F.3d 389,\n       392 (2d Cir. 1999) (quoting Hewitt, 459 U.S.\n       at 471–72).\n\n280 F.3d at 81.\n\n       Read together, Sandin, Wolff, and Meachum,\n       all support the proposition that a statute or\n       regulation which involves “state-created\n       right[s],” [Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539,\n       557 (1974)], creates a protectable liberty\n       interest when an official’s failure to adhere to\n       the statute results in an “atypical, significant\n       deprivation,” Sandin, 515 U.S. at 486, of “real\n       substance,” Wolff, 418 U.S. at 557, and not\n       simply “ephemeral and insubstantial”\n       violations. Meachum, 427 U.S. at 228.\n\n280 F.3d at 83.\n\f30                  CHAPPELL V . MANDEVILLE\n\n    Similarly, in Smith v. Cruse, the Northern District of\nCalifornia held that Sandin’s “atypical and significant\nhardship” due process analysis must be triggered by the\nexistence of a state regulation which significantly limits the\ndiscretion of prison officials.

But none of these cases directly address the issue,\nand their statements about the continuing validity of the\nsubstantive predicate approach are dicta, not binding on this\npanel or on district courts within the circuit. Instead, these\ncases simply affirm the uncontroversial proposition that\nSandin created the requirement of an “atypical and significant\nhardship” in order to establish a state-created liberty interest.\n\n    Turning now to the facts of this case, the parties did not\nidentify any prison regulation that puts a limit on an official’s\ndiscretion in order to place a prisoner on contraband watch.\nThe parties seem to have agreed, and certainly did not dispute\nfor purposes of summary judgment, that the contraband watch\nregulations in effect at the relevant time were set forth in\n\n\n\nMitchell v.

Shimoda, 131 F.3d 818, 829–30 (9th Cir. 1997)\n(opining that the substantive predicate test had “likely . . . been\ndisapproved” by Sandin, but concluding that, in any event, the\nclassification of prisoners as sex offenders satisfies that test); Keenan v.\nHall, 83 F.3d 1083, 1088-89 (stating that Sandin “rejected its prior\n[substantive predicate] test” and remanding because the district court had\nnot considered whether the deprivation was atypical and significant).\n\f32                  CHAPPELL V . MANDEVILLE\n\nplaintiff’s exhibit J.3 These regulations deal mainly with the\nconditions of contraband watch, and do not describe any\nlimitations on an official’s discretion. The only provisions\nrelating to the decision to place an inmate on contraband\nwatch are found in the first paragraph of page 1 and the\nsecond paragraph on page 5 of regulation 52050.25:\n\n         The responsible Facility Captain during\n         business hours, and the AOD during non-\n         business hours, (evenings/Saturdays/\n         Sundays/holidays), are delegated the authority\n         to place inmates suspected of concealing\n         contraband items within their body cavities on\n         Body Cavity Surveillance Status. Notification\n         will be made to the respective Associate\n         Warden during business hours.\n\n         ...\n\n         The Watch Commander will only terminate\n         Body Cavity Surveillance with Concurrence\n         of the Facility Captain where the inmate was\n         previously housed or the AOD during non-\n         business hours. If extenuating circumstances\n         exist, the Body Cavity Surveillance may be\n         continued; however, review of each case will\n         be conducted daily by the affected Facility\n         Program Lieutenant to determine whether\n\n\n  3\n     This exhibit was not included in the record of this court and was\nobtained from the district court docket. According to the district court\ndecision, plaintiff offered this excerpt of the CDC Operations Manual as\nproof of the conditions and procedures in effect at the time when he was\non contraband watch, and the defendants have not objected to its accuracy.\n\f                 CHAPPELL V . MANDEVILLE                   33\n\n       termination or continuation of the Body\n       Cavity Surveillance is necessary.\n\n    An inmate may be placed on contraband watch based on\nmere suspicion of concealing contraband within his body\ncavities. Such suspicion does not even have to be reasonable.\nMoreover, it appears from the regulation that it is entirely\nwithin the discretion of the affected Facility Program\nLieutenant to determine whether termination or continuation\nof the Body Cavity Search is necessary. This regulation is\nnot a substantive limitation on official discretion and\ntherefore the regulations do not qualify as a state-created\nliberty interest.\n\n    Because subjecting Chappell to contraband watch did not\nviolate the Due Process Clause, and because he failed to show\nthat he had a state-created liberty interest in avoiding\ncontraband watch, his due process claim fails as a matter of\nlaw.\n\n\n\nBERZON, Circuit Judge, dissenting in part:\n\n    I join Part III.B of the majority opinion, as I agree that\nDefendants Mandeville and Rosario are entitled to qualified\nimmunity on the due process issues. In my view, however,\nthe defendants are not entitled to qualified immunity on\nChappell’s Eighth Amendment claim. As I would affirm the\ndistrict court’s denial of summary judgment on qualified\nimmunity with respect to the Eighth Amendment issue, I\nrespectfully dissent from Part III.A of the majority opinion.\n\f34                CHAPPELL V . MANDEVILLE\n\n                                I\n\n     Our jurisdiction over this collateral order appeal of the\ndistrict court’s denial of summary judgment on qualified\nimmunity grounds is limited to questions of law. See Ortiz v.\nJordan, 131 S. Ct. 884, 891 (2011); Behrens v. Pelletier, 516\nU.S. 299, 312–13 (1996); Johnson v. Jones, 515 U.S. 304,\n319–20 (1995); Alston v. Read, 663 F.3d 1094, 1098 (9th Cir.\n2011). We do not concern ourselves with whether the “pre-\ntrial record sets forth a genuine issue of fact for trial,” but\ninstead examine the “purely legal issue whether the facts\nalleged . . . support a claim of clearly established law.”\nAlston, 663 F.3d at 1098 (alteration in original) (internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n\n    On this record, there are disputed issues of fact\nconcerning: (a) the impact of the lighting, in combination\nwith other conditions (e.g., lack of a mattress, waist restraints,\netc.), on Chappell’s sleep; and (b) the legitimate need for a\ntwenty-four hour bright light in Chappell’s cell (as opposed\nto a dimmed light) for surveillance, given all the other\nrestrictions on his movement. We resolve all factual disputes\nand draw all reasonable inferences in favor of Chappell, the\nnon-moving party, and “look at the purely legal question of\nwhether the defendant[s’] alleged conduct violated\n[Chappell’s] clearly established constitutional rights.”\nCunningham v. City of Wenatchee, 345 F.3d 802, 807–08 (9th\nCir. 2003); accord Mattos v. Agarano, 661 F.3d 433, 439–40\n(9th Cir. 2011), cert. denied, 132 S. Ct. 2681, 2682, 2684\n(2012); Jeffers v. Gomez, 267 F.3d 895, 903 (9th Cir. 2001).\n\n    For purposes of this appeal, the established facts\npertaining to Chappell’s Eighth Amendment claim are as\nfollows:\n\f                 CHAPPELL V . MANDEVILLE                      35\n\n    From April 30, 2002, until May 6, 2002, Chappell was\nconfined to a surveillance cell containing only a bedframe\nwithout a mattress. After being stripped and subjected to a\n“body cavity search,” Chappell was dressed in two pairs of\nunderwear and two jumpsuits, one of each worn facing\nforward and the other worn backwards. The clothing was\ntaped closed at the thighs, ankles, upper arms, and waist. He\nwas then placed in waist chain restraints and ankle shackles,\nand was chained to the bedframe. Chappell’s handcuffs were\nattached to the waist chain, forcing him to keep his hands at\nhis sides at all times, even while eating. The lights in the cell\nwere “very bright” and were kept on constantly throughout\nhis nearly seven-day confinement on contraband watch.\n\n    While Chappell did not expressly allege that the\nconditions of contraband watch caused him “grave sleeping\nproblems,” as did the prisoner in Keenan v. Hall, 83 F.3d\n1083, 1091 (9th Cir. 1996), the statements in Chappell’s\namended complaint permit an inference that his sleep was\ndisturbed. Specifically, he describes how he had to “attempt”\nto sleep on a bare metal cot with bodily restraints, under\nconstant “very bright light,” alleging that the conditions “did\nin fact torture [him] mentally” and that he was “deteriorating\nmentally.”\n\n                               II\n\n    Whether constant illumination violates the Eighth\nAmendment in a particular case is a fact-specific inquiry. But\ncontrary to the majority’s suggestion, Maj. Op. at 10, officials\ndo not enjoy qualified immunity simply because the precise\nfacts at issue in their particular case have not been addressed\npreviously. Officials can “still be on notice that their conduct\nviolates established law even in novel factual circumstances.”\n\f36               CHAPPELL V . MANDEVILLE\n\nHope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730, 741 (2002). If new facts alone\ntriggered qualified immunity, then officials would rarely if\never be held accountable in cases involving “fact-driven”\nclaims, such as the Eighth Amendment claim at issue here.\nCf. Mattos, 661 F.3d at 442 (applying the “clearly\nestablished” rule to a fact-specific Fourth Amendment case).\nWe therefore must begin with what was the clearly\nestablished Eighth Amendment law regarding prison\nconditions at the time of Chappell’s contraband watch, and\nthen proceed to determine whether a reasonable prison\nofficial could have considered the conditions of Chappell’s\ncontraband watch constitutional in light of those precedents.\n\n    In April–May 2002, it was clearly established that it is\nunconstitutional to cause a prisoner harm by subjecting him\nto constant lighting. Keenan pronounced in 1996 that “[t]here\nis no legitimate penological justification for requiring\n[inmates] to suffer physical and psychological harm by living\nin constant illumination.” 83 F.3d at 1090 (alteration in\noriginal) (emphasis added). Thus, contrary to the majority’s\nrepresentation, Keenan did not simply hold that the prison\nofficials in that particular case lacked a legitimate\npenological justification for imposing constant illumination,\nsee Maj. Op. at 9–11 & n.3; it held that if constant\nillumination causes a prisoner physical or psychological\nharm, then no penological purpose can justify it; “[the]\npractice is unconstitutional.” Keenan, 83 F.3d at 1090.\n\n    Moreover, it was clearly established law that conditions\nhaving the mutually reinforcing effect of depriving a prisoner\nof a single basic need, such as sleep, may violate the Eighth\nAmendment. See Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. 294, 304–05\n(1991); see also Keenan, 83 F.3d at 1090 (“Adequate lighting\nis one of the fundamental attributes of adequate shelter\n\f                 CHAPPELL V . MANDEVILLE                      37\n\nrequired by the Eighth Amendment.”) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted); Harper v. Showers, 174 F.3d 716, 720 (5th\nCir. 1999) (“[S]leep undoubtedly counts as one of life’s basic\nneeds.”); Shepherd v. Ault, 982 F. Supp. 643, 648 (N. D. Iowa\n1997) (“Constant illumination can undoubtedly cause sleep\ndeprivation . . . and sleep is certainly an ‘identifiable human\nneed.’”).\n\n    The cases the majority cites in support of its qualified\nimmunity analysis are not to the contrary. See Maj. Op. at\n12–13. Instead, those cases held only that constant\nillumination from dim lights or lights distanced from a\nprisoner’s cell (such as hallway lights) did not amount to\ncruel and unusual punishment, see Fillmore v. Ordonez, 829\nF. Supp. 1544, 1552, 1568 (D. Kan. 1993) (“low-intensity,”\n“soft” lighting); Williams v. Ward, 567 F. Supp. 10, 13\n(E.D.N.Y. 1982) (light in hallway); Cassidy v.\nSuperintendent, 392 F. Supp. 330, 334 (W.D. Va. 1975)\n(“[T]he light is not so bright as to interfere with the inmates’\nrest.”), and that “discomfort of lights at night [does] not\nconstitute a constitutional deprivation” when the prisoner was\nprovided with bedding, not subject to any other bodily\nrestraints in his cell, and not denied sleep, Bauer v. Sielaff,\n372 F. Supp. 1104, 1110 (E.D. Pa. 1974). Those cases are\ninapposite here, where the light was “very bright” and inside\nChappell’s cell, and where the fair inference from the facts on\nsummary judgment, viewed most favorably to the plaintiff, is\nthat the lighting, in combination with the other conditions on\ncontraband watch, interfered with Chappell’s sleep.\n\n   Similarly, the majority’s reliance on Zatko v. Rowland,\n835 F. Supp. 1174 (N. D. Cal. 1993), is misplaced. See Maj.\nOp. at 12, 13. While the court’s observation in Zatko that\nconstant illumination of a jail cell with bright light, depriving\n\f38                CHAPPELL V . MANDEVILLE\n\nthe inmate of normal sleep, “would violate his basic right to\nshelter,” is relevant, id. at 1181, its ultimate ruling on Zatko’s\nEighth Amendment claim has little bearing on the law\napplicable here. Zatko admitted that the officers “tr[ied] to\naccommodate the inmates [and did not] unnecessarily use the\nlight to keep [him] awake.” Id. In contrast, Chappell never\nconceded that the bright light (in combination with other\nconditions) was not intended to interfere with his sleep, or\nthat the defendants did not exhibit deliberate indifference to\nits impact on his sleep.\n\n    Moreover, that some courts—unlike ours—have\nrecognized that there can be a legitimate penological\njustification for constant lighting does not mean that any\nasserted penological purpose will justify such illumination.\nThe Eighth Circuit cases cited by the majority, Ferguson v.\nCape Girardeau County, 88 F.3d 647 (8th Cir. 1996) and\nO’Donnell v. Thomas, 826 F.2d 788 (8th Cir. 1987), see Maj.\nOp. at 13, held that there was a legitimate governmental\ninterest in constant illumination of pretrial inmates’ cells in\nview of the particular circumstances of those\ncases—circumstances distinct enough from those at issue\nhere that a reasonable officer would not have thought that\neither Ferguson or O’Donnell condones the actions taken\nhere.\n\n    In Ferguson, the prisoner’s medical condition and safety\nconcerns, in combination with the amount of time he spent\noutside of the cell, justified constant illumination to enable\ncontinuous surveillance of the prisoner while he was in his\ncell. See Ferguson, 88 F.3d at 650. Moreover, Ferguson was\nobserved sleeping “ninety-three hours of the fourteen days\nspent in the vestibule [cell].” Id. Here, the totality of the\ncircumstances, including the conditions restricting Chappell’s\n\f                 CHAPPELL V . MANDEVILLE                      39\n\nmovement and foreclosing his ability to conceal anything\nwhile on contraband watch, detract from, rather than enhance,\nthe need for the constant, twenty-four-hour bright light:\nChappell was not allowed out of the cell; had no mattress,\nwater, or toilet; was dressed in highly restrictive clothing; and\nwas placed in waist restraints and shackles.\n\n    Nor would O’Donnell lead a reasonable officer to believe\nthat the conditions of Chappell’s confinement on contraband\nwatch were constitutional. The constant illumination of\nO’Donnell’s cell was held “not unreasonable” in view of the\ninmate’s previous suicide attempt, escape concerns, and fear\nthat he would be a danger to himself or others. O’Donnell,\n826 F.2d at 790. Comparable concerns were not present in\nChappell’s case. Moreover, there was no indication that, in\naddition to the lighting, O’Donnell was simultaneously\nsubject to physical restraints in his holding cell, like those\nimposed on Chappell, decreasing the need for illumination as\na safety precaution.\n\n    A reasonable officer would have known that, in\ncombination, the twenty-four-hour bright light, the absence\nof a mattress, and the extensive bodily restraints risked\ndepriving Chappell of sleep, in violation of the Eighth\nAmendment. The district court correctly denied summary\njudgment on this claim on qualified immunity grounds,\naffording Chappell an opportunity to prove that Mandeville\nand Rosario demonstrated deliberate indifference to the risk\nof physical or psychological harm created by the conditions\nof confinement on contraband watch. For these reasons, I\nrespectfully dissent from Part III.A of the majority opinion.\n\f",

Mason, Southwestern Law School, Los Angeles,\nCalifornia, for Plaintiff-Appellee.\n\n\n                         OPINION\n\nBYBEE, Circuit Judge:\n\n    Plaintiff Rex Chappell brought a § 1983 case against\nvarious officials from California State Prison, Sacramento,\nalleging constitutional violations relating to his six-day\n\f4                CHAPPELL V . MANDEVILLE\n\nplacement on contraband watch. The defendants brought a\nmotion for summary judgment, and the district court granted\nthe motion on some of the claims, but denied summary\njudgment with respect to Chappell’s Eighth Amendment and\ndue process claims against defendants R. Mandeville and\nT. Rosario. Mandeville and Rosario appealed. We hold that\nboth Mandeville and Rosario are entitled to qualified\nimmunity because the law at the time Chappell was on\ncontraband watch did not clearly establish that their actions\nwere unconstitutional. We therefore reverse.\n\n     I.   FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n    Rex Chappell was a prisoner in California State Prison,\nSacramento when his fianceé, Philissa Richard, came to visit\nhim on April 28, 2002. When Richard entered the prison\nfacilities she was wearing a ponytail hairpiece; the next day\nthe hairpiece was discovered in a trash can near the visiting\nroom. Prison officials then searched the entire visiting area\nand found spandex undergarments in the women’s bathroom.\nBoth the hairpiece and the undergarments tested positive for\ncocaine residue. Richard admitted that the hairpiece was hers,\nbut an investigation did not conclude whether the\nundergarments also belonged to Richard. A background\ncheck revealed that Richard had a long history of felony\noffenses, including numerous drug offenses.\n\n    Prison staff conducted a search of Chappell and his prison\ncell, during which they notified Chappell that they believed\nthat someone had introduced drugs through a hairpiece. The\nofficials discovered three unlabelled bottles of what appeared\nto be eye drops in Chappell’s cell. The liquid in the bottles\ntested positive for methamphetamine.\n\f                 CHAPPELL V . MANDEVILLE                     5\n\n    On April 30, 2002, Chappell was placed on contraband\nwatch. Under prison regulations, an official who is the rank\nof captain or above can make the decision to place a prisoner\non contraband watch if the official has reasonable cause to\nbelieve that an inmate has ingested or secreted contraband.\nF. Schroder was the acting facility captain at the time, but he\ndid not remember any specific details as to how Chappell was\nplaced on contraband watch or who made the decision.\nR. Mandeville, captain of the Investigative Services Unit, was\nin charge of the investigation but denies that he was the\nofficial who ordered contraband watch. T. Rosario was the\nacting warden and also would have had authority to order the\nwatch.\n\n      Contraband watch, also known as a “body cavity search,”\nis a temporary confinement during which a prisoner is closely\nmonitored and his bowel movements searched to determine\nwhether he has ingested or secreted contraband in his\ndigestive tract. Under prison procedures, the prisoner is first\nsearched and then dressed so as to prevent him from excreting\nany contraband and removing it from his clothing. The\nprisoner is placed in two pairs of underwear, one worn\nnormally and the other backwards, with the underwear taped\nat the waist and thighs. The prisoner is also placed in two\njumpsuits, one worn normally and the other backwards, with\nthe suits taped at the thighs, ankles, waist, and upper arms.\nThe tape on both the underwear and the jump suits is not\nmeant to touch the skin; it is used to close off any openings\nin the clothing. The prisoner is then placed in waist chain\nrestraints, which are handcuffs that are separated and chained\nto the side of the prisoner’s waist. This prevents the prisoner\nfrom being able to reach his rectum. The waist chain\nrestraints are adjustable and can be lengthened if necessary.\nThe prisoner is then placed in a surveillance cell where prison\n\f6                CHAPPELL V . MANDEVILLE\n\nstaff watch the prisoner at all times. The lights are kept on in\nthe cell to allow staff to see the prisoner. To prevent the\ninmate from concealing contraband, the cell does not have\nany furniture other than a bed without a mattress. The\nprisoner is given a blanket, and receives three meals a day\nand beverages. When the prisoner needs to defecate he must\nnotify the prison staff who will bring him a plastic, moveable\ntoilet chair. Once he uses the chair, the staff will search the\nwaste to determine if it contains contraband.\n\n    Chappell generally confirmed that these policies were\napplied to him while he was under contraband watch. In\naddition to these procedures, Chappell claims that he was also\nplaced in ankle shackles, and chained to the bed. He\ncomplains that the waist restraints were not loosened for\nmeals, forcing him to “eat [his] food like a dog; the\ntemperature in the cell was very high; the cell was\nunventilated; and the lights were “very bright.” Chappell\nalleged that the conditions “did in fact torture [him] mentally”\nand he felt like he “deteriorat[ed] mentally” during\ncontraband watch.\n\n   After having three bowel movements that did not reveal\ncontraband, Chappell was released from contraband watch on\nMay 6, 2002.\n\n    Chappell brought an action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983\nnaming various prison officials as defendants, including\nMandeville and Rosario, and alleging numerous\nconstitutional claims. The defendants brought a motion for\nsummary judgment, and the district court, adopting the\nfindings and recommendations of the magistrate judge,\ngranted the motion on some of the claims, but denied\nsummary judgment with respect to two of Chappell’s claims\n\f                   CHAPPELL V . MANDEVILLE                   7\n\nagainst Mandeville and Rosario: (1) that the contraband\nwatch constituted cruel and unusual punishment in violation\nof the Eighth Amendment, and (2) that Chappell’s due\nprocess rights were violated since he was not given notice of\nthe charges against him or an opportunity to be heard prior to\nbeing placed on contraband watch. Mandeville and Rosario\nappealed.\n\n             II.

W e\nreview a district court’s denial of summary judgment on grounds of\n\f                  CHAPPELL V . MANDEVILLE                       9\n\nChappell’s version of the facts, and assuming that he has\nstated a claim under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments,\nthe law was not clearly established on either of Chappell’s\nclaims at the time the contraband watch took place such that\nMandeville and Rosario would have had fair notice that their\nactions were unconstitutional. Thus, Mandeville and Rosario\nare entitled to qualified immunity.\n\nA. Chappell’s Eighth Amendment Claim\n\n    Chappell argues that the combination of conditions to\nwhich he was subjected, including twenty-four-hour lighting\nand mattress deprivation, violated his Eighth Amendment\nrights. We hold that as of April-May 2002, when Chappell\nwas placed on contraband watch, the law was not clearly\nestablished as to whether the conditions Chappell\nexperienced—either in isolation or combination—violated the\nEighth Amendment, made applicable to the states through the\nFourteenth Amendment.\n\n    1. Continuous lighting\n\n    With regards to continuous lighting, as of April-May\n2002, we had explained generally that sufficient or\n“[a]dequate lighting is one of the fundamental attributes of\n‘adequate shelter’ required by the Eighth Amendment,”\nHoptowit v.

In Keenan, the prisoner claimed\nsleep deprivation over a period of six months; Chappell’s\nclaim is based on seven days of contraband watch, and he did\nnot claim that he was sleep deprived.2\n\n    Moreover, Keenan did not clearly establish that constant\nillumination violates the Eighth Amendment when done for\na legitimate penological purpose. Keenan noted that no\nlegitimate penological justification had been offered in that\ncase. Keenan, 83 F.3d at 1090. Furthermore, the district court\ncase on which Keenan relied, LeMaire, acknowledged that a\nneed to see into cells as a security measure could be a\n\n\n  2\n     As Judge Berzon acknowledges in her dissent, Chappell “did not\nexpressly allege” that the contraband watch caused him sleeping\nproblems. Dissent Op. at 35. The only statement relating to sleep in the\nAmended Complaint is that Chappell was “deteriorating mentally” and\nhad to “attempt to sleep that way.”\n\f                    CHAPPELL V . MANDEVILLE                           11\n\nlegitimate penological justification, but concluded that the\npenological justification offered in that case was insufficient\nbecause there was no evidence that the staff “need[ed] to see\ninto the quiet cells for 24 hours per day, or that they [were]\neven near the quiet cells for 24 hours per day.” LeMaire, 745\nF. Supp. at 636.3 In contrast, the record here reflects a clear\npenological purpose. Prison officials suspected that Chappell\nhad secreted contraband in his body and kept the lights on so\nthat they could monitor Chappell 24 hours a day to prevent\nhim from disposing of the contraband. The officers would\nhave been unable to perform contraband watch if they could\nnot see into his cell. Thus, our case law did not clearly\nestablish that in April-May 2002 that the constant\nillumination of Chappell’s cell was unconstitutional.\n\n     In addition, even if Chappell and Mandeville had looked\nto other decisional law for guidance they still would not have\nhad fair notice that their actions were unconstitutional.\nIndeed, one district court case surveying the state of the law\nexplained that there have been “mixed results” on continuous\nlighting claims because “such cases are fact-driven.”\nShepherd v.

Supp. at 636); see Dissent O p. at 36.\nAlthough Judge Berzon reads Keenan as broadly stating that penological\nreasons cannot justify constant illumination under any circumstances,\nKeenan itself was quoting from LeMaire, in which that court left open the\npossibility that a legitimate penological purpose could justify constant\nillumination. 745 F.

Kan. 1995).\n\n    Overall, as of April-May 2002, other jurisdictions had\nmade decisions on continuous lighting based on various\nfactors, including whether the lights caused sleep deprivation,\nShepherd, 982 F. Supp. at 647–49; Zatko, 835 F. Supp. at\n1181; Cassidy, 392 F. Supp. at 334; the brightness and\nintensity of the lights, id.; the duration of exposure, Shepherd,\n982 F.

MANDEVILLE\n\ncourts, however, concluded that the there was no Eighth\nAmendment violation.\n\n    Since, at the time Chappell’s contraband watch took\nplace, no court had ruled on whether contraband watch\nconstitutes a legitimate penological purpose that would justify\ncontinuous lighting, and Chappell was subjected to\ncontinuous lighting for only seven days and did not claim that\nhe was deprived of sleep or intentionally kept awake,\nMandeville and Rosario did not have fair notice that their\nactions were unconstitutional. Given our decision in Keenan\nand the decisional law in other circuits, we have some doubt\nthat the conditions that Chappell experienced under\ncontraband watch even amounted to Eighth Amendment\nviolation, but we do not reach this question since, at a\nminimum, the law was not clearly established that the\ncontraband watch was unconstitutional and thus Chappell’s\nEighth Amendment claim can be resolved on qualified\nimmunity grounds.\n\n     2. Mattress deprivation\n\n    The law was not clearly established as of April-May 2002\nwith regards to mattress deprivation either. We had held that\nmattress deprivation “for only one night [was] insufficient to\nstate an eighth amendment violation,” Hernandez v. Denton,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"514780\"><a href=\"/opinion/514780/mike-hernandez-v-george-f-denton/\"><span class=\"volume\">861</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1421</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1424 (9th Cir. 1988), vacated on other\ngrounds, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">493</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">801</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, (1989), but had not made clear\nwhether mattress deprivation for longer could state an Eighth\nAmendment claim. Although we had indicated in an\nunpublished decision that a prisoner who was “forced to sleep\non the floor, without a mattress, next to broken toilets and\noverflowing showers” for an unspecified period of time and\n“had to wear the same clothes for 45 days” might have an\n\f                 CHAPPELL V .

[did] not provide clear guidance to prison\nofficials as to how much time must pass before requiring a\nprisoner to sleep on the floor of a cell without a mattress\n[may] constitute an Eighth Amendment violation.” Schroeder\nv. Kaplan, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">60</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">834</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1995</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">398878</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2 (9th Cir. July\n7, 1995) (unpublished) (quoting Hutto v.

We also held in Schroeder that, where\na prisoner was forced to sleep on a cold concrete floor for\nmost of a month, the law was not clearly established on\nwhether mattress deprivation was an Eighth Amendment\nviolation. Id. at *2–3. We concluded that there was no\nbinding precedent in our circuit, that decisional law in other\njurisdictions was inconsistent, and that those courts that found\na constitutional violation had additional egregious facts\nsupporting an Eighth Amendment claim. Id. at *2 (citing\ncases that included additional factors such as “extreme cold,\nlack of sanitary conditions, solitary confinement, inadequate\nclothing, or improper diet”).\n\n    If Mandeville and Rosario had looked to Schroeder they\nwould not have had notice on whether mattress deprivation\nconstituted an Eighth Amendment violation. This is\nparticularly true because the facts surrounding Chappell’s\nconfinement are much less severe than those in Schroeder.\nNot only was Chappell forced to sleep without a mattress for\nonly seven days, which is significantly less time than the\nprisoner in Schroeder who went a month without a mattress,\nbut Chappell had a bed and a blanket. Mandeville and\n\f16               CHAPPELL V . MANDEVILLE\n\nRosario also submitted evidence that there was a legitimate\npurpose for not allowing Chappell to have a mattress—no\nmattress or furniture was allowed into the cell to prevent the\ninmate from concealing contraband.\n\n    We did not hear any cases on mattress deprivation\nbetween July 1995, when Schroeder was decided, and April-\nMay 2002, when Chappell was placed on contraband watch.\nThe law of other jurisdictions between July 1995 and April-\nMay 2002 would not have provided Chappell and Rosario\nwith any further clarity either.

Thus, our conclusion in Schroeder\nthat the law was not clearly established was still true in April-\nMay 2002. Mandeville and Rosario would not have had fair\nnotice that mattress deprivation alone would have constituted\na constitutional violation.\n\n    3. Combination of conditions\n\n    Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Chappell,\nin addition to the continuous lighting and the mattress\ndeprivation, Chappell alleged that he was taped into two pairs\nof underwear and jumpsuits, placed in a hot cell with no\nventilation, chained to an iron bed, shackled at the ankles and\nwaist so that he could not move his arms, and was forced to\neat like a dog. The district court adopted the magistrate’s\nfinding that these conditions had the “mutually enforcing\neffect of sleep deprivation that any reasonable officer would\nknow comprised unconstitutional conditions of confinement.”\nWe disagree.\n\n    It is true that “[s]ome conditions of confinement may\nestablish an Eighth Amendment violation ‘in combination’\nwhen each would not do so alone.” Wilson v. Seiter, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112626\"><a href=\"/opinion/112626/wilson-v-seiter/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">294</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 304 (1991). But this only applies when the conditions\n“have a mutually enforcing effect that produces the\ndeprivation of a single, identifiable human need such as food,\nwarmth, or exercise—for example, a low cell temperature at\nnight combined with a failure to issue blankets.” Id. Chappell\nhas not alleged the deprivation of any such need here. He did\nnot specifically claim that he was sleep deprived during the\n\f18               CHAPPELL V . MANDEVILLE\n\ncontraband watch, but only that he was “deteriorating\nmentally” and had to “attempt to sleep that way.”\n\n    Moreover, the focus of the inquiry under qualified\nimmunity is whether the defendants had fair notice that their\nactions were unconstitutional. In April-May 2002, there were\nno cases in this jurisdiction that involved a contraband watch\nsimilar to the one that occurred here. The only factually\nsimilar case was Mendoza v. Blodgett, which involved a\n“feces watch” where the prisoner was placed in a “dry cell”\nwearing only a pair of shorts and not given a blanket.\nMendoza v.

In that case, the district court\nheld that these circumstances did not amount to an Eighth\nAmendment violation, noting that the purpose of these\nconditions was “to insure that [the prisoner was] unable to\nconceal or destroy any contraband passed through a bowel\nmovement.” Id. at *5.\n\n    Case law in other jurisdictions would not have provided\nany further clarity. The Seventh Circuit held similarly that\nplacement of a prisoner into a dry cell for three days, during\nwhich he was unable to wash his hands and denied personal\nhygiene items, did not violate the Eighth Amendment,\nparticularly since the prisoner had been “confined to the dry\ncell to serve a legitimate penological interest.” Jihad v.\nWright, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">204</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1997</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">471345</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2 (7th Cir.

Nov. 14, 1996)\n(unpublished) (holding that a three-day confinement to dry\ncell without toilet paper, toothbrush, toothpaste, in a “filthy\nroach-infested cell” did not violate the Eighth Amendment).\n\f                     CHAPPELL V . MANDEVILLE                             19\n\n    Although the conditions here were more severe than those\nin the feces watch cases, as previously explained, Mandeville\nand Rosario presented evidence that the contraband watch\nconditions were engineered with an eye to accomplishing the\nsame penological purpose as the feces watch\ncases—discovering secreted contraband. Given this important\npenological purpose and the state of the law at the time, the\ncontraband watch was not “such a far cry from what any\nreasonable prison official could have believed was legal that\nthe defendants knew or should have known they were\nbreaking the law.” Sorrels, 290 F.3d at 971; see also\nMesserschmidt, 132 S. Ct. at 1244 (“Qualified immunity\ngives government officials breathing room to make\nreasonable but mistaken judgments, and protects all but the\nplainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.”\n(internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n   Because no court had held that conditions similar to those\nChappell experienced were unconstitutional in the face of the\nimportant penological purpose of discovering contraband, we\nhold that Mandeville and Rosario are entitled to qualified\nimmunity on Chappell’s Eighth Amendment claim.4\n\n\n\n  4\n     Because Mandeville and Rosario are entitled to qualified immunity,\nwe do not consider whether these conditions amounted to an actual Eighth\nAmendment violation. Our holding is limited to a finding that the law was\nnot clearly established as to whether the conditions that Chappell was\nsubjected to, both in isolation and combination, violated the Eighth\nAmendment. See Reichle v. Howards, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"801500\"><a href=\"/opinion/801500/reichle-v-howards/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

MANDEVILLE\n\nB. Chappell’s Due Process Claim\n\n    Chappell also claims that his right to due process was\nviolated because he was not provided with an opportunity to\nbe heard by the official who ordered the contraband watch.\nFor Chappell to be entitled to due process we first must find\nthat he has a liberty interest triggering procedural protections.\nA liberty interest can arise from one of two sources—either\nthe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment or\nstate law. Mendoza, 960 F.2d at 1428. Since Chappell does\nnot make clear whether he bases his claim on the Due Process\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment or whether he claims a\nstate-created liberty interest, we analyze both theories.\n\n     1. Liberty interest under the Fourteenth Amendment\n\n     We conclude that the Due Process Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment does not afford Chappell a liberty\ninterest. “[L]awfully incarcerated persons retain only a\nnarrow range of protected liberty interests.” Hewitt v. Helms,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110829\"><a href=\"/opinion/110829/hewitt-v-helms/\"><span class=\"volume\">459</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">460</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 467 (1983). Thus, “[a]s long as the conditions\nor degree of confinement to which the prisoner is subjected\nis within the sentence imposed upon him and is not otherwise\nviolative of the Constitution, the Due Process Clause does not\nin itself subject an inmate’s treatment by prison authorities to\njudicial oversight.” Montanye v. Haymes, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109511\"><a href=\"/opinion/109511/montanye-v-haymes/\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">236</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 242\n(1976). Transfer to less amenable quarters for non-punitive\nreasons has been held to be “ordinarily contemplated by a\nprison sentence.” Hewitt, 459 U.S. at 468; see also Wilkinson\nv. Austin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799975\"><a href=\"/opinion/799975/wilkinson-v-austin/\"><span class=\"volume\">545</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">209</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 221 (2005) (explaining that “[t]he\nConstitution itself does not give rise to a liberty interest in\navoiding transfer to more adverse conditions of\nconfinement”). Indeed, the Due Process Clause does not\nprotect against all changes in conditions of confinement even\n\f                 CHAPPELL V . MANDEVILLE                    21\n\nwhere they “hav[e] a substantial adverse impact on the\nprisoner involved.” Meachum v. Fano, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109510\"><a href=\"/opinion/109510/meachum-v-fano/\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">215</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 224\n(1976).\n\n    An investigative contraband watch is the type of condition\nof confinement that is ordinarily contemplated by the\nsentence imposed. Only the most extreme changes in the\nconditions of confinement have been found to directly invoke\nthe protections of the Due Process Clause, such as\ninvoluntary commitment to a mental institution, see Vitek v.\nJones, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110231\"><a href=\"/opinion/110231/vitek-v-jones/\"><span class=\"volume\">445</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">480</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 493–94 (1980), or the forced\nadministration of psychotropic drugs, Washington v.

Since a temporary contraband\nwatch does not rise to this level, Chappell cannot directly\nclaim a liberty interest under the Due Process Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment.\n\n   2. State-created liberty interest\n\n    In addition, the claim that Mandeville and Rosario are\nliable to Chappell for damages based on a state-created\nliberty interest also fails. Since the law was not clearly\nestablished on whether a state-created liberty interest existed\nwith regard to the contraband watch when it took place,\nMandeville and Rosario are also entitled to qualified\nimmunity on Chappell’s due process claim, and so cannot be\nliable for damages.\n\n       a. Sandin and the substantive predicates test\n\n    A state may create a liberty interest through statutes,\nprison regulations, and policies. Wilkinson, 545 U.S. at 222;\nNeal v. Shimoda, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"749366\"><a href=\"/opinion/749366/97-cal-daily-op-serv-9274-97-daily-journal-dar-14953-aj-neal-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">818</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 827 (9th Cir. 1997). For\nmany years we analyzed whether a state had created a liberty\n\f22               CHAPPELL V . MANDEVILLE\n\ninterest in its prison regulations under the “substantive\npredicates approach,” based on the Supreme Court’s decision\nin Hewitt v. Helms, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110829\"><a href=\"/opinion/110829/hewitt-v-helms/\"><span class=\"volume\">459</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">460</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. This approach asked\nwhether the state has placed “substantive limitations on\nofficial discretion,” through “adopting regulations which\nestablish ‘substantive predicates’ to govern official\ndecisionmaking,” by using “explicitly mandatory” rather\nthan discretionary language. Mendoza, 960 F.2d at 1428–29;\nsee also Hewitt, 459 U.S. at 471–72.\n\n     Our approach to state-created liberty interests changed,\nhowever, in response to the Court’s decision in Sandin v.\nConner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117957\"><a href=\"/opinion/117957/sandin-v-conner/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">472</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1995). In Sandin, the Court criticized\nits previous “substantive predicates” approach as applied to\nchanges in prison conditions, asserting that “the search for a\nnegative implication from mandatory language in prisoner\nregulations has strayed from the real concerns undergirding\nthe liberty protected by the Due Process Clause.” Id. at\n480–83. Sandin then refocused the inquiry on whether the\naction “imposes [an] atypical and significant hardship on the\ninmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.” Id.\nat 483–84.

The only similar\ncase in which we had considered a due process claim was\nMendoza, where the prisoner had been placed on “feces\nwatch.” Mendoza, 960 F.2d at 1427–29. That case, however,\nwas pre-Sandin and thus did not apply the “atypical and\nsignificant hardship” test. Id.

MANDEVILLE                     25\n\n    Because there was no case law holding that contraband\nwatch, or any similar regime, is an “atypical and significant\nhardship,” and the “atypical and significant hardship” test is\nso fact-specific, Mandeville and Rosario did not have fair\nnotice on whether the conditions that Chappell experienced\nviolated a state-created liberty interest that would trigger due\nprocess protections. Thus, Mandeville and Rosario are also\nentitled to qualified immunity on Chappell’s due process\nclaim.\n\n                   IV.    CONCLUSION\n\n    We conclude that, as of April-May 2002, the law was not\nclearly established as to whether the conditions that Chappell\nexperienced in connection with the contraband watch violated\nthe Eighth Amendment. Moreover, we conclude that\nChappell cannot claim a liberty interest under the Due\nProcess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and it was not\nclearly established that Chappell had sustained a violation of\na state-created liberty interest. Therefore, both Mandeville\nand Rosario are entitled to qualified immunity. In light of this\nconclusion, we do not decide whether Chappell’s claims, if\nproven, would violate the Eighth or Fourteenth Amendments.\n\n   REVERSED.\n\n\n\nGRAHAM, Senior District Judge, concurring:\n\n    I join the panel’s opinion with the exception of Section\nIII.B.2.

MANDEVILLE\n\nanalysis of Chappell’s due process claim based on a state-\ncreated liberty interest.\n\n    I believe that subjecting Chappell to contraband watch did\nnot violate his rights under the Due Process Clause. The due\nprocess analysis should end there because Chappell has\nidentified no state statute or regulation which limits the\ndiscretion of prison officials to subject him to this kind of\ntemporary investigatory confinement. In the absence of such\na state statute or regulation, there can be no state-created\nliberty interest.\n\n    My colleagues apparently believe that Sandin changed\nthis requirement and that post-Sandin any change in\nconditions of confinement which imposes an “atypical and\nsignificant hardship” may give rise to a violation of a state-\ncreated liberty interest. I fail to understand how it could be\nsaid that a state has “created” a liberty interest by imposing\nharsher conditions of confinement. In effect, my colleagues\nhave interpreted Sandin to conflate the state-created liberty\ninterest analysis so as to give a state prisoner direct access to\nthe protections of the Due Process Clause if he can show that\nthe conditions of his confinement impose an “atypical and\nsignificant hardship.” This is a radical change in due process\njurisprudence and a significant departure from previous\nlimitations.

In Mendoza, the court explained:\n\n       The most common way a state creates such an\n       interest is by adopting regulations which\n       establish “substantive predicates” to govern\n       official decisionmaking and by mandating the\n       outcome to be reached upon a finding that the\n       relevant criteria have been met. There must be\n       particularized standards or criteria to guide\n       the state’s decisionmakers, and the criteria\n       must serve to limit discretion. If a\n       decisionmaker can make his decision for any\n       constitutionally permissible reason or for no\n       reason at all, the state has not created a liberty\n       interest.\n\n960 F.2d at 1428-1429 (citations omitted).\n\n    The second part of the inquiry asks whether the regulation\nin question concerns a restraint that imposes an “atypical and\nsignificant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary\nincidents of prison life.” Sandin, 515 U.S. at 484. Prior to\n\f28                CHAPPELL V . MANDEVILLE\n\nSandin, prisoners had asserted federal due process claims\nbased on all sorts of prison regulations, such as those\npertaining to visitation, lunch trays, books, electrical outlets\nin cells, prison jobs, etc. Id. at 482–83. In Sandin, the Court\nclarified its earlier decisions on state-created liberty interests\nby making it clear that those interests are protected by the\nDue Process Clause only when state regulations, relating to\nfreedom from restraints, impose “atypical and significant\nhardships on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents\nof prison life.” Id. at 484.\n\n    This two-part inquiry is based on my understanding of the\nstate of the law in the aftermath of Sandin and is the approach\nadopted by the Second Circuit.

MANDEVILLE\n\nplaintiff’s exhibit J.3 These regulations deal mainly with the\nconditions of contraband watch, and do not describe any\nlimitations on an official’s discretion. The only provisions\nrelating to the decision to place an inmate on contraband\nwatch are found in the first paragraph of page 1 and the\nsecond paragraph on page 5 of regulation 52050.25:\n\n         The responsible Facility Captain during\n         business hours, and the AOD during non-\n         business hours, (evenings/Saturdays/\n         Sundays/holidays), are delegated the authority\n         to place inmates suspected of concealing\n         contraband items within their body cavities on\n         Body Cavity Surveillance Status. Notification\n         will be made to the respective Associate\n         Warden during business hours.\n\n         ...\n\n         The Watch Commander will only terminate\n         Body Cavity Surveillance with Concurrence\n         of the Facility Captain where the inmate was\n         previously housed or the AOD during non-\n         business hours. If extenuating circumstances\n         exist, the Body Cavity Surveillance may be\n         continued; however, review of each case will\n         be conducted daily by the affected Facility\n         Program Lieutenant to determine whether\n\n\n  3\n     This exhibit was not included in the record of this court and was\nobtained from the district court docket. According to the district court\ndecision, plaintiff offered this excerpt of the CDC Operations Manual as\nproof of the conditions and procedures in effect at the time when he was\non contraband watch, and the defendants have not objected to its accuracy.\n\f                 CHAPPELL V . MANDEVILLE                   33\n\n       termination or continuation of the Body\n       Cavity Surveillance is necessary.\n\n    An inmate may be placed on contraband watch based on\nmere suspicion of concealing contraband within his body\ncavities. Such suspicion does not even have to be reasonable.\nMoreover, it appears from the regulation that it is entirely\nwithin the discretion of the affected Facility Program\nLieutenant to determine whether termination or continuation\nof the Body Cavity Search is necessary. This regulation is\nnot a substantive limitation on official discretion and\ntherefore the regulations do not qualify as a state-created\nliberty interest.\n\n    Because subjecting Chappell to contraband watch did not\nviolate the Due Process Clause, and because he failed to show\nthat he had a state-created liberty interest in avoiding\ncontraband watch, his due process claim fails as a matter of\nlaw.\n\n\n\nBERZON, Circuit Judge, dissenting in part:\n\n    I join Part III.B of the majority opinion, as I agree that\nDefendants Mandeville and Rosario are entitled to qualified\nimmunity on the due process issues. In my view, however,\nthe defendants are not entitled to qualified immunity on\nChappell’s Eighth Amendment claim. As I would affirm the\ndistrict court’s denial of summary judgment on qualified\nimmunity with respect to the Eighth Amendment issue, I\nrespectfully dissent from Part III.A of the majority opinion.\n\f34                CHAPPELL V .

MANDEVILLE                      35\n\n    From April 30, 2002, until May 6, 2002, Chappell was\nconfined to a surveillance cell containing only a bedframe\nwithout a mattress. After being stripped and subjected to a\n“body cavity search,” Chappell was dressed in two pairs of\nunderwear and two jumpsuits, one of each worn facing\nforward and the other worn backwards. The clothing was\ntaped closed at the thighs, ankles, upper arms, and waist. He\nwas then placed in waist chain restraints and ankle shackles,\nand was chained to the bedframe. Chappell’s handcuffs were\nattached to the waist chain, forcing him to keep his hands at\nhis sides at all times, even while eating. The lights in the cell\nwere “very bright” and were kept on constantly throughout\nhis nearly seven-day confinement on contraband watch.\n\n    While Chappell did not expressly allege that the\nconditions of contraband watch caused him “grave sleeping\nproblems,” as did the prisoner in Keenan v. Hall, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"718273\"><a href=\"/opinion/718273/96-cal-daily-op-serv-3261-96-daily-journal-dar-5331-charles-m/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1083</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1091 (9th Cir. 1996), the statements in Chappell’s\namended complaint permit an inference that his sleep was\ndisturbed. Specifically, he describes how he had to “attempt”\nto sleep on a bare metal cot with bodily restraints, under\nconstant “very bright light,” alleging that the conditions “did\nin fact torture [him] mentally” and that he was “deteriorating\nmentally.”\n\n                               II\n\n    Whether constant illumination violates the Eighth\nAmendment in a particular case is a fact-specific inquiry. But\ncontrary to the majority’s suggestion, Maj. Op. at 10, officials\ndo not enjoy qualified immunity simply because the precise\nfacts at issue in their particular case have not been addressed\npreviously. Officials can “still be on notice that their conduct\nviolates established law even in novel factual circumstances.”\n\f36               CHAPPELL V . MANDEVILLE\n\nHope v. Pelzer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121169\"><a href=\"/opinion/121169/hope-v-pelzer/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">730</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 741 (2002). If new facts alone\ntriggered qualified immunity, then officials would rarely if\never be held accountable in cases involving “fact-driven”\nclaims, such as the Eighth Amendment claim at issue here.\nCf. Mattos, 661 F.3d at 442 (applying the “clearly\nestablished” rule to a fact-specific Fourth Amendment case).\nWe therefore must begin with what was the clearly\nestablished Eighth Amendment law regarding prison\nconditions at the time of Chappell’s contraband watch, and\nthen proceed to determine whether a reasonable prison\nofficial could have considered the conditions of Chappell’s\ncontraband watch constitutional in light of those precedents.\n\n    In April–May 2002, it was clearly established that it is\nunconstitutional to cause a prisoner harm by subjecting him\nto constant lighting. Keenan pronounced in 1996 that “[t]here\nis no legitimate penological justification for requiring\n[inmates] to suffer physical and psychological harm by living\nin constant illumination.” 83 F.3d at 1090 (alteration in\noriginal) (emphasis added). Thus, contrary to the majority’s\nrepresentation, Keenan did not simply hold that the prison\nofficials in that particular case lacked a legitimate\npenological justification for imposing constant illumination,\nsee Maj. Op. at 9–11 & n.3; it held that if constant\nillumination causes a prisoner physical or psychological\nharm, then no penological purpose can justify it; “[the]\npractice is unconstitutional.” Keenan, 83 F.3d at 1090.\n\n    Moreover, it was clearly established law that conditions\nhaving the mutually reinforcing effect of depriving a prisoner\nof a single basic need, such as sleep, may violate the Eighth\nAmendment. See Wilson v. Seiter, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112626\"><a href=\"/opinion/112626/wilson-v-seiter/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">294</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 304–05\n(1991); see also Keenan, 83 F.3d at 1090 (“Adequate lighting\nis one of the fundamental attributes of adequate shelter\n\f                 CHAPPELL V .

See Maj. Op. at\n12–13. Instead, those cases held only that constant\nillumination from dim lights or lights distanced from a\nprisoner’s cell (such as hallway lights) did not amount to\ncruel and unusual punishment, see Fillmore v.

Those cases are\ninapposite here, where the light was “very bright” and inside\nChappell’s cell, and where the fair inference from the facts on\nsummary judgment, viewed most favorably to the plaintiff, is\nthat the lighting, in combination with the other conditions on\ncontraband watch, interfered with Chappell’s sleep.\n\n   Similarly, the majority’s reliance on Zatko v. Rowland,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1983934\"><a href=\"/opinion/1983934/zatko-v-rowland/\"><span class=\"volume\">835</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1174</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (N. D. Cal. 1993), is misplaced. See Maj.\nOp. at 12, 13. While the court’s observation in Zatko that\nconstant illumination of a jail cell with bright light, depriving\n\f38                CHAPPELL V . MANDEVILLE\n\nthe inmate of normal sleep, “would violate his basic right to\nshelter,” is relevant, id. at 1181, its ultimate ruling on Zatko’s\nEighth Amendment claim has little bearing on the law\napplicable here. Zatko admitted that the officers “tr[ied] to\naccommodate the inmates [and did not] unnecessarily use the\nlight to keep [him] awake.” Id. In contrast, Chappell never\nconceded that the bright light (in combination with other\nconditions) was not intended to interfere with his sleep, or\nthat the defendants did not exhibit deliberate indifference to\nits impact on his sleep.\n\n    Moreover, that some courts—unlike ours—have\nrecognized that there can be a legitimate penological\njustification for constant lighting does not mean that any\nasserted penological purpose will justify such illumination.\nThe Eighth Circuit cases cited by the majority, Ferguson v.\nCape Girardeau County, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"721381\"><a href=\"/opinion/721381/paul-ferguson-v-cape-girardeau-county-norman-copeland-sheriff-cape/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">647</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (8th Cir. 1996) and\nO’Donnell v.

See Ferguson, 88 F.3d at 650. Moreover, Ferguson was\nobserved sleeping “ninety-three hours of the fourteen days\nspent in the vestibule [cell].” Id. Here, the totality of the\ncircumstances, including the conditions restricting Chappell’s\n\f                 CHAPPELL V . MANDEVILLE                      39\n\nmovement and foreclosing his ability to conceal anything\nwhile on contraband watch, detract from, rather than enhance,\nthe need for the constant, twenty-four-hour bright light:\nChappell was not allowed out of the cell; had no mattress,\nwater, or toilet; was dressed in highly restrictive clothing; and\nwas placed in waist restraints and shackles.\n\n    Nor would O’Donnell lead a reasonable officer to believe\nthat the conditions of Chappell’s confinement on contraband\nwatch were constitutional. The constant illumination of\nO’Donnell’s cell was held “not unreasonable” in view of the\ninmate’s previous suicide attempt, escape concerns, and fear\nthat he would be a danger to himself or others. O’Donnell,\n826 F.2d at 790. Comparable concerns were not present in\nChappell’s case. Moreover, there was no indication that, in\naddition to the lighting, O’Donnell was simultaneously\nsubject to physical restraints in his holding cell, like those\nimposed on Chappell, decreasing the need for illumination as\na safety precaution.\n\n    A reasonable officer would have known that, in\ncombination, the twenty-four-hour bright light, the absence\nof a mattress, and the extensive bodily restraints risked\ndepriving Chappell of sleep, in violation of the Eighth\nAmendment. The district court correctly denied summary\njudgment on this claim on qualified immunity grounds,\naffording Chappell an opportunity to prove that Mandeville\nand Rosario demonstrated deliberate indifference to the risk\nof physical or psychological harm created by the conditions\nof confinement on contraband watch. For these reasons, I\nrespectfully dissent from Part III.A of the majority opinion.\n\f</pre>",
